RESIDENT EVIL 2 WALK THRU

Leons First Scenario...
From the starting point, clear a path through the zombies and make
your way to the gun shop. There, you'll find two boxes of handgun
ammunition. Once the zombies break through the glass, you can either
flee in terror or kill the zombies and get the shop owner's bow gun.
Once in the alley behind the shop, make your way to the back of the
van and collect the handgun rounds. The zombies will break through the
gate; take care of them and go to the door on the other side of the
basketball court. From this point, run by the zombies and head to the
bus. Once inside, take the handgun bullets out of the bag and take
care of the flesh eaters. Head for the front door of the bus.
From here, it's only a short distance to the police station, but
beware - many of the undead are waiting.
In the main hall of the police station, pick up the handgun bullets
and ink ribbon. You can save here at the typewriter. Go through the
unlocked door and speak with the wounded officer. He will give you a
key card. Use the key card on the computer in the main hall where you
first entered the station house. It unlocks the other door. Now go
through it, and you'll find a police memo. Head through the door next
to the window. In the hallway you will come across an officer who has
had a slight problem with his head. If you double-check him you will
find that he has some handgun bullets that you might need. Further
down the hall you'll come across a pool of blood. Beware of the
creature that drops down. Simply aim low and shoot until it doesn't
move anymore. Pick up the green herbs to heal yourself now or later.
Enter the door at the end of the hall. Go down the hall and through
the double doors to the right. To your immediate left on a desk you
will find the Operation Report file. Head to the small room to the
left of the chalkboard. There, go to the fireplace and ignite the fire
with the lighter to reveal the first red jewel. Take it and head out
the door and continue down the hallway. When you reach the room with
the zombies, take care of them quickly and head up the stairs to the
left. Now head down the hall until you reach the statue with the
second red jewel in its hand. Push the smaller gray statue over the
square on the floor to the left of the big statue. Push the reddish
statue over the square on the right side of the statue. The red jewel
will be released and is yours for the taking. Head through the door to
the right of the statue and down the hallway. Enter the first door,
which is the S.T.A.R.S. office. On Chris's desk you will find his
diary, and beneath that you will find the Unicorn Medal. Get the
shotgun out of the locker and exit the room.
Take the Unicorn Medal to the fountain in the main hall of the police
station, where you first entered. Place the Unicorn Medal in the front
of the fountain. This will release the spade key. Go back into the
door from which you came and down the hall, and unlock the door to the
file room. There, you'll find the Patrol Report, ink ribbon, and a
crank. To get the crank, push the step stool to the cabinet, climb up,
and get it. Exit the room and head up to the second floor
Go down the hall past the statues and enter the door. Make your way to
the library. From there, head up the stairs to the right and down the
walkway. You will fall through the floor. Look at the picture clue and
push the red button. Approach the face of the bookshelves and push the
red switches to make the bookcases match the picture clue. Once in the
correct position, the picture will fall away and reveal the bishop
plug. Take the plug and exit the double doors. Then make your way to
the other side of the balcony, past the zombies, and through the door
on the far side. Enter the room and pick up the desk key, ink ribbon,
and the Chief Secretary's Diary A. Then exit through the opposite door
and head down the hallway. Exit through the door straight ahead.
Once outside go down the stairs and enter the door. In the hallway,
enter the open doorway on the left. Enter the small room with the open
door to the right. Inside you will find green herbs behind a desk and
a safe in front. To open the safe, use the combo 2236. Inside you will
find acid rounds and the police station map. Exit double doors at far
end of room.
Make your way to the burning helicopter outside the police station. Go
down the stairs and enter the door around the corner, where you'll
find a save point, bow darts, and a valve handle. With valve handle in
hand, return to the burning helicopter. Go behind the open fence next
to the door and use the valve handle on the water-pressure
valve. Water will quench the flames and in the smoke you will find
handgun bullets. Head back to hallway inside the house where the
helicopter was protruding in. Now with the flames out you can enter
the door on the right.
In this room you will find the diamond key and two stone busts
protruding out of the wall. Place a red jewel in each one of the
busts. This will reveal the king plug. Take the plug and head back to
the first floor. Use the diamond key to enter the evidence room on the
first floor to the right of the main staircase. Dispatch the zombies
quickly, and then search for the film and shotgun shells. Exit through
the other door into the room where the officer gave you the key card
at the beginning. This time he won't be so nice. On the desk in the
room where you find him will be the heart key. If you look around the
main room you will find some handgun bullets in the locker and a memo
to Leon on the desk. When you're done poking around, head to the
interrogation room that you can open with the diamond key. Once inside
you'll find the rook plug and cord. Make your way out of the 
roomquickly....
Now go back to the room where you got the memo to Leon. From there, go
down the short hallway to the door you need the heart key for. Use it
and discard. Now head for the stairs, and look out for the dogs. Take
your first right and run to the first door on your right. Inside, pick
up the green herbs and police B1 map, then head for the reserve power
control panel. Once there press up, down, up, down, up. This will
activate the key card lock door. Now head back out, take a right, and
head to the door at the end of the hallway marked parking.
You will now meet up with Ada Wong. Help Ada move the paddy wagon out
of the way. Follow her in and find the cell that Ben is in. After a
brief conversation, look to the shelf on the right for the manhole
opener. Head to the left of the kennels and look for the manhole. Use
the manhole opener and head down. Once there you will become
Ada. Beware of the dogs!
You want to take the first right and head straight for the
door. Inside the room, look to the right to find the sewage-disposal
map hanging on the wall. Hop down to the left of the control panel and
push the boxes in place so they make a bridge. Once they are in place,
hop back up to the water-level control switch and push the button. The
water will raise the boxes and you can walk across and get the club
key. Now head back to the door on the right, where some grenade rounds
are waiting, and head back to where you first became Ada. She will
automatically give Leon the items. Once you are yourself again, head
back up the stairs, open the door using the diamond key, and discard
it. Inside the room, you'll acquire the Magnum, the night watchman's
diary, and ammo. Now go into the only room on the first-floor map you
haven't been in: the middle room on the upper right side. Use the club
key to enter and discard. With lighter in hand, ignite the furnace on
the far side of the room. Then turn the faucets on the wall in this
order: 12, 13, and 11. This will make the golden cogwheel fall out of
the painting. Take it and head to the third floor via the library on
the second floor.
Enter the only other door on the third floor and use the crank in the
square hole in the wall to lower a staircase. Head up the staircase
and use the golden cogwheel on the gears, then press the button to
open the door to the right. Behind the door you will find the knight
plug. Go down the shaft and pick up the mail to the chief. Keep going
and prepare for a fierce fight with the hideous monster waiting for
you. Once he's defeated, make your way to the door at which you need
to place all of the chess piece plugs to enter. From there you can
find the room that contains the ink ribbon, sewer manager file, andsave 
point.
When you exit, you'll run into Ada again. After a brief conversation,
you will be shot and become Ada again. Follow the woman up the ladder
and on into the vent shaft. After you meet up with her, head down the
ladder. Here you'll once again become Leon. Go down the hallway and
find the wolf coin. Follow the sewer until you reach the
equipment. Use the valve handle on the bridge-lowering mechanism. Once
across and on the other side, use it again to raise the bridge back up
(trust me). Head down the corridor until the alligator attacks. Then
run back until you get to the red light on the left. Push the button
to release the gas canister. Let the alligator take the canister into
his mouth, then shoot it! Head down to the door in the direction the
alligator came from. Head up the ladder, go to the left, and get the
eagle medal and sewer manager's diary.
Head to the right and use the valve handle on the lighted machine to
the left of the spinning fan. This will allow you to climb up the
ladder and through the airshaft. Follow the sewer until you reach the
waterfall and use both of the medals on the water-flow control panel
to the right. This will stop the flow of water and allow you access to
the door behind. Make your way to the right side of the trolley and
turn on the power switch on the control panel. This will activate the
trolley. Enter it, but beware of the monster. When he attacks, shoot
up at his arms. Once on the other side, exit, and to the immediate
left, use the lighter on the flare signal to make the weapon-box key
gleam in the light. Pick up the key and head for the door.
Go down the walkway until you reach some zombies and the first
intersection. Go to the left, and search on the dead guy for shotgun
parts, which can be combined with the shotgun to make a super
shotgun. Head to the right and up the ladder. In the room above,
you'll find ink ribbons, Magnum bullets, shotgun rounds, and a save
point. Once all of the items have been collected, head out the
door. Go into the tractor housing sitting on the platform. Inside,
you'll find more ammo and the key to activate the platform. Take the
key out to the control panel in front of the tractor housing, use it,
and press the button to activate. Once inside, William, the creature
(you can't miss him), will attack. Exit the tractor and get ready 
forbattle!
Once William is defeated, go back in the tractor housing. After Ada is
done talking, explore the room for various items, head to the east
area, and go through the frozen door. Get the fuse case off the cart
and use it at table to have it put together by the mechanical
arm. Take the fuse to the junction in between the east and west area,
and use it. Head to the west area and go in the door to the right. Get
the security memo and temporary-user note. Go to the computer and turn
on the anti-B.O.W. sprinklers. Shoot the plant coming out of the
ventilation shaft with flame rounds or the flamethrower found in the
locker. Climb through the vent shaft and pick up the ammo and inkribbon.
Now go to open the door to the right, but beware of the fierce plant
creatures waiting behind the door. Once they have been dealt with,
head through the door and destroy one more. Then head down the ladder
by the big plant. Enter the door and search beneath all of the
monitors for the map. Go through the door and use the weapon-box key
to get the Magnum parts. These can be combined to make a custom
Magnum. Go in and deal with the zombies and pick up the red lab
card. Take it and head to the door with the huge eggs out front. Use
the card to enter, and kill the giant moth. Then move over to the
computer and clear off the keyboard by killing all of the 
littlecreatures on it.
Use the computer and enter in the password "guest." Then head back up
to the east area and use the key card on the door. Enter and kill the
zombies and turn on the light switch. Pick up the first-aid spray,
Magnum rounds, and most importantly the MO disk. When you go outside
you'll run into Annette and receive the G-virus. Head to the large
door to use the MO disk. Ada will confront you. After this, continue
on your way to the MO disk door. Enter and prepare for the final
battle with William. Just make sure you have a lot of herbs and/or
first-aid spray and ammo!
