1.0 INTRODUCTION


  Hello. Welcome to Oddworld. This place is widely known because of the great 
puzzle situations in which the inhabitants are always in. In other words: Want 
help? Here I am!
 Formerly known as the Lost World FAQ maker only, my third FAQ will guide you 
through the perils and enigmas of this awesome PlayStation game. Remember that all 
the FAQ is a spoiler, so if you want to solve the riddle yourself, do not read it 
yet. As your tour guide through this wasteland, I will present you with all the 
cities. So hang in tight and do not eat Scrab Cakes during your travel. Thanks. 
If you have additions, corrections, or comments about the game, please email me at:

E- MAIL: diazducc@sol.racsa.co.cr

 Use the Word " Abe " at the subject line if possible. Thank you. Needless to say, 
you will get full credit if your contribution works
NOTE: For your convenience, I will submit the FAQ with only Rupture Farms covered 
first, then I will update it with the remaining stages. This way you do not have to 
wait until I finish the FAQ ( this FAQ will be LONG, believe me ), and also I will 
not be so pressured to make it fast. If it is done slow, it is done better. But e-
mail me if you feel that I am delaying it too much. Thanks.

@node "5" "Abe's Moves"


5.0 ABE'S MOVES

Although they teach you them in the game, I will include them here.

L or R: Walk in the selected direction
U: Hoist ( like Prince of Persia or Tomb Raider ), enter doors, use platforms and 
BOOM machines. Also used to mount Elum. Also use some switches where he needs to 
use his hand on them ( like directories)And it is used to enter in wells.
D: Duck. Dismount Elum, use platform, hoist down from platforms
S: Use levers
T: Hop forward
C: ( Hold ) throw rock, bomb, or meat
X: Duck
Duck, then L or R: Roll
L1+L2 or any other top button combination: Chant

Hold R1, then L or R: Run
Hold R2, then L or R: Tip toe
As a rookie, you tend to run when you need to tip-toe or viceversa, because the 
buttons are too close. Practice.

While running press T: long jump
While running press X: running roll

5.1: GAMESPEAK:

 Abe talks. Even if his lips are sealed.

Hold L1, then:

T: "Hello": used to start a conversation with a Mudokon.
S: "Follow me": makes the Mudokon to follow you. If you need to make him go down a 
platform, throw yourself first, then insist with this sentence until he comes down 
too
X: "Wait": with this the Mudokon will not follow you, so use it to keep them out of 
danger.
C: Angry: Useless. Unless you want the Sligs to make fun of you

Hold L2, then:

T: Long whistle: used in codes
S: Laugh: useless too
X: Short whistle: Also used in codes
C: Fart: used to finish codes  

You can talk even if you are ducked, or mounted on Elum, but you cannot if you are 
hanging from a platform.

@node "6" "General Info"


6.0 GENERAL INFO


6.1: HOW TO KILL ENEMIES 

 The chant is your only defense. It affects Sligs, Scrabs and Paramytes.

To get rid of Sligs, chant until they are possessed, or use the environment ( pits, 
falling barrels ) 
NOTE: you cannot possess Sligs that are in the same floor than you, even if you are 
in the shadows ( they must not see you ) Also, the Slig must keep running in the 
same screen than you are. 

As the Slig:

S: "What?". Also used to use levers
X: Strike: use it to hit mudokons, so they can duck under your bullets and avoid 
getting shot.
T: " Blah! "
C: Fire weapon. Hold for a continuous burst
R2+ L or R: Run ( like Abe )
L2+R2: Explosion
Slig cannot jump or duck, but he can ride platforms

With the Slig you must kill other enemies, so be trigger happy, or they could kill 
you first. Explore with him to fire as many Sligs as you can. DO NOT KILL ANY 
MUDOKONS. Also be careful not to fire Abe, as you can kill him. 

The Slig can talk too, but many of his phrases are just annoying sounds. Only SOME 
Slogs obey him. 

Hold L1, then:

S: " Here, boy ": used to talk with some Slogs, the equivalent to Abe's " Follow me 
"
X: " Get him " : the attack order for the Slog.
T: " Hi " 
C: " Wait "

Hold L2, then:

S: Laugh
X: Grunt 1
T: Grunt 2
C: " Look out! " : the same use of the strike, but also alerts other Sligs.

Notes about Sligs:

If you want, you can press L2 and C to alert, then you must only release L2 and the 
Slig will fire automatically.
If you hit a mudokon with the strike too much, it will die, so be careful         


The Scrabs and Paramytes can be delayed with the chant, but you cannot possess 
them.

To kill Paramytes, use the environment. You can distract them with meat pieces, but 
they eat fast. If there are two or more together, they will attack you. They also 
attack if you corner them.

To kill Scrabs, make them meet a friend. They will fight until death, letting you 
escape

To kill Slogs, use the environment, or a Slig.

The bees need to be avoided. Elum hates them.

The bats kill you immediately. Avoid them too


6.2 ENDINGS

The game has at least two endings. They change depending on the friends that you 
helped throughout your quest.

Rescue 49 Mudokons or less: Sad ending
Rescue 50 or more Mudokons: Happy ending
Rescue 99 Mudokons: They give you the happy ending, then a brief note and the code 
to see all the movies.

6.3 RESCUING MUDOKONS

 To rescue Mudokons do the following.

Say " Hello " until they say that too. Now ask them to follow you. Go to a bird 
portal and chant. The mudokon will jump through the portal and will be free. Easy, 
right? You can rescue as many mudokons at once as you like. If the mudokon is in a 
room with a bird portal, just chant and he will escape. You cannot talk to two 
different mudokons in the same room. In this case rescue one first, or make him 
wait next to the bird portal. If you or a Slig broke the portal, you need to go 
back a room and then return, and the birds will be there.
Special note about taking mudokons down a ledge:
 You don't have to throw yourself down first. You can stand next to an opening or 
on the otherside and call the Mudokon. The first time won't produce a result but 
every subsequent call will bring him one step closer to you. This can be handy for 
positioning them to go through timing traps and having them walk off ledges.


6.4 USING GRENADES

The grenades can be tricky at first, but it is easy:

Hold C to prepare the grenade. It will bip five times, and at the sixth time it 
will explode. Usually, you will have to throw it immediately after the FIFTH bip. 
The angles are a little like this:

FACING RIGHT:

Press L: throws close and vertical
Press R: throws very far
Press U: throws high and relatively far
Press D: throws close too.
While duck: throws it at a decent range and it goes horizontally. Useful to kill 
Sligs.

When I refer to blowing orbs, you need to prepare the grenade, wait for the fifth 
bip, and then throwing it in the direction that you are facing.

All these commands also apply  to rocks and meat, but they will not explode. 

6.5 USING ELUM

 Who is Elum? Elum is your " pet ". It is like a cross between a dog and a horse. 
You use Elum to make long jumps. Also, Abe's feet can rest while riding him.

To mount Elum: stand in front of him and press U
To dismount Elum: Press D. 

NOTE: Elum understands the " Follow me " and " Wait " commands. Use them to 
position Elum where you need him.

While you are on Elum, press L or R to move, and hold R1 and move to run.
You can use all the Gamespeak sentences, but you cannot chant.
To ride platforms you need to dismount and then ask Elum to follow you. When both 
of you are on the platform, use it.

If Elum spots honey, he will go and eat it. While he is eating, he is useless. He 
will not obey any of your orders. To " wake him up ", you need to find some bees 
and then get close to Elum, so they will attack him.

Elum CANNOT jump straight up, only can do hops forward, so be careful. Also, you 
CANNOT hang from ledges while riding him   

6.6 MONSTER INDEX

 If you do not have the manual, then probably you are having trouble with the 
monster names. I will try to describe them as best as possible

Bat: needless to explain

Bees: Ditto

Elum: the horse that you ride. Almost the only one that does not attack you.

Glukkons: the executives of Rupture Farms. Tall, brown, and smoking cigars. They 
appear only at the end

Mudokons: the guys like you. They are always working. The wild ones can only talk 
with a whistle-fart language and tend to attack you if they have a weapon.
 
Paramites: Small, with many legs. They appear only in Paramonia. They tend to 
attack when they are in groups. Can be distracted with meat pieces.

Scrabs: Big, with a great chest but no arms. They have long jaws. Run very fast. 
Attack their own kind.

Sligs: They have metalic legs, plastic heads with squid faces, and a mean shotgun ( 
that fires like a machine gun ) The most common enemy. Fool, almost blind guards. 
Can be possessed

Slogs: A big pair of jaws with two legs. Attack relentlessly , but obey some Sligs. 
They think of themselves as dogs.

6.7  SECRET CODES

Special sequences that you input to obtain a goodie. I know there is also a level 
select code. Can anybody send the code to me? Thanks.

Movie player.

To see all the movies of the game ( there are some FMVs missing ) press the 
following sequence at the main menu screen ( where a big Abe at the center of the 
screen shows up and says " Hello " )

Hold R1 and keep it pressed during the entire code. 

While holding R1 press:

U, L, R, S, C, T, S, R, L, U, R.

Now release R1 and press U or D to scroll through the movies. Enjoy

@node "7" "Walkthrough"


7.0 WALKTHROUGH

Since the game is too long, I will break this in stages, one stage per update. Why 
I am doing this? I need to live, you know. To make things easier, I will divide the 
rooms in paragraphs, so when the paragraph ends, you will know that you must exit 
that room.
Example:

Run to the left and kill Slig. Go left     ( ROOM 1 )
Mount Elum and jump left                  ( ROOM 2 )


7.1: RUPTURE FARMS

 This is where you work, and also it is the starting point of your adventure.
ENEMIES: Sligs only
EMPLOYEES: 28
NOTE: I will mark some areas with an asterisk ( * ) ,and a number, because you need 
to come here later, when you have rescued 14 or 17 mudokons. Remember all these 
places. 

7.1.1: ESCAPING

  At the beginning*0, follow the onscreen instructions.
 After using the third door, quickly go right before Slig shoots you.
 You will come to an area with some jumps over land mines*1. 
 Now you have arrived to a room with a Mudokon and a sleeping Slig *2 . Now chant 
until you possess the Slig. Go left and use the electricity lever. These kinds of 
levers will turn off the electric barriers near them. Go right.
DO NOT PUSH THE NEXT LEVER. It is a trap, because it will kill the Mudokon. Go 
right. 
You are in a room with a metalic ring*3 . Go right.
At the end of the corridor there is a sleeping Slig. Kill him and explode yourself. 
Now make the mudokons go to the riding platform and go down with them.
Free them and enter the door. 

7.1.2: PACKAGING    

Lead the two mudokons to the portal at the right and free them. Now go up and 
right.
You are in a room with a lever next to you, and a Slig below you*4 . You cannot 
possess it because of the orb, so use the lever to open the floor and let the Slig 
fall. Go right.
Deactivate the bomb carefully. Go up.
Walk a little to wake up both Sligs and quickly pull the lever so the Slig to the 
right falls. If you do this incorrectly, they will kill the mudokon. Now possess 
the remaining Slig and explode him. Now pull the lever to the right and take 
mudokon to the left and free him. Go right past the lever you just pressed.
Stay where you appeared and possess the Slig at the background. Explode him. Now 
roll to the right.
Climb to the platform and use the lever so the meat saw stops.
Go back to the place where you killed the last Slig and take the mudokon to the 
right. Make him stop. Now climb to the platform with the lever and go right.
 Possess Slig and go to the right. Note that THERE ARE MUDOKONS HIDDEN IN THE 
SHADOWS, so do not shoot where you cannot see, except in the place with the Slig. 
Kill him and go right.
Be careful because there are two meat saws. One moves faster than the other. The 
lever in that room alternates the speed of the saws, so use this to your 
advantage.DO NOT USE THE LEVER IN THE NEXT ROOM, it is a trap, too.
Go right, step next to the Slig, say: " Look out! ", and quickly kill Slig. Use the 
lever if you want. It opens the metalic door, but you cannot go there yet.  Explode 
Slig.
Now go and rescue all the mudokons in that floor, including the ones in the 
shadows. When the meter says that you have rescued 14 mudokons ( if you have 
rescued them all ), go to a room with a door at the middle and a threatening sign. 
Enter the door.
Now run to the left until you reach a BOOM machine*5. Get a grenade.
Now run to the right and jump while running to grab to Slig's platform. Climb it 
when he falls to the ground. Now throw the grenade ( wait for the fifth bip, then 
throw it ) to the security orb. Possess the Slig and go to the left.
Ride the platform until you reach the top.
Now run to the right and you will fall on a platform where a Slig was sleeping. 
Kill him and explode your Slig.
Now go left, press the lever so the platform returns and ride it to the top again.
Throw yourself to the place where you killed the last Slig and duck.
Go right into a bonus section. Time the jumps carefully. ( No need to run). Duck at 
the end and go right.
Free the three mudokons and go back.
Now look carefully at the platform to the right. It has some debris falling from 
it. This indicates that you can hang from this platform and go down. Fall and now 
you must return to the * spots.

*0: Go to the first stage of the game and again stand behind the barrel and go 
down.
Jump to the left and pull lever.
Go down where the lone mudokon is. The Slig will wake up. Quickly hang to his 
platform and climb when he falls. Press the lever and kill him. Free mudokon.
Go up and take the two mudokons down. Try not to kill them. Free them too.
Now go up and stand at the right of the middle saw. Hoist and get out

*1: Get a grenade from *2 or *3, now go to the place where you must jump and throw 
while ducking, aiming to the mines at the right side of the screen.
When you destroyed them all, go down and again stand behind the barrel and fall.
Talk to a mudokon and immediately fall, then climb again. This way when you climb 
again, he will be waiting for you safely. Take him down and stop him.
Repeat the procedure and then free them when they are all together.
The lever here is to change the saw's speed. DO NOT PULL IT. It is not neccessary.  

*2: Go to the exact point where the Slig was sleeping. See the barrel at the 
foreground? Stand behind it and press D twice.
You will fall into a secret room. Here you must get a grenade, blow the orb, 
possess the Sligs and then go down using the surviving Slig.
Turn to the left and kill the Slig. Explode yours.
Now simply go down, blow the second orb and free the mudokons

*3: Pull the ring and fall through the hole.
Get a grenade, stand in the left edge of the platform where you are and throw the 
grenade while ducking. BOOM! Get another grenade and go down and right, at the 
opposite side of the mudokon. Duck, throw the grenade, blow the land mine and free 
mudokon.
Get out by jumping through the upper portal. 

*4: Pull the lever and fall through the hole.
Go down staying in shadows so the Slig cannot see you.
Get a grenade, and blow orb. Now possess the Slig, and press the lever. Explode 
him. Now get another grenade, go up to the highest platform, blow that orb and 
possess Slig. Explode him.
Take mudokon down and free them all.
Exit through the other portal.

*5: Now that you have the 28 mudokons, go here and get a grenade. ride the platform 
up and throw a grenade while ducking.
Fall to the left and duck at the end.
Now roll to the left and you are free. Almost.


7.2 STOCKYARD ESCAPE

Enemies: Bats, Scrabs, Sligs, Slogs

Again, I will use the asterisks. This denotes areas where you can rescue mudokons, 
but you do not need to visit them to exit the level.

At the beginning, jump over mines and go left.
Stand where you appear ( in this room )and chant, so the mudokon below you can 
escape ( he is in the shadows, and if you do not act fast, the Scrab will kill him 
). Try not to activate alarm. Just stand still when a laser beam touches you. If 
you activated the alarm anyway, just duck quickly and roll to the left. Exit to the 
left.
Make the jumps and go left.
Here you must jump to the left ledge. To do so, wait for the Scrab to run from LEFT 
to RIGHT, then run and fall from the right ledge. Now run to the left and do a 
running jump to grab the left platform, and climb immediately. If the Scrab stands 
still, then chant and it will move. Go left. If you cannot do the jumps quickly, 
chant so the Scrab stops, giving you some more time.
Make jumps and avoid being detected. Go left.
Jump left and chant at fireflies. They give you clues, so CHANT TO ALL THE 
FIREFLIES YOU ENCOUNTER. Go left.
Jump over mines. Go left.
Jump over mine and grab from the edge, so the Slig cannot see you. Climb when he 
walks to the left and tip toe into shadows. You and the Slig must walk to the left 
at the same time, but you must go behind him, silently.
Hide and wait for him to go right, then get close to the edge and fall when the 
Slig below you goes away. Now go left and duck in shadows. Wait for him to go right 
and go left.
Jump over mine and hang from the ledge. Fall.
If you chant here, you will find a hidden portal*1. Go down and set up bomb. Go 
left slowly.
Here let a Slig follow you and run to the right ( he must say " Wait! " The easiest 
way is to wait until they are facing left. Then walk out of shadows and when they 
see you, run to the right )
Now jump over bomb and climb right ledge. The Slig must run and touch the bomb. 
After he explodes, go right again.
Now walk silently behind the Slig and climb on left ledge. Go left.
Cross the room, avoiding bats.
Here you must jump to the left. Or you can go down from the left ledges*2
Cross the room. Stand in the edge and go down when the Slig goes to the right. 
Quickly set up bomb and climb back. When Slig dies, go to the left. Or if you want 
go to the right*3
Go down.
Here you can go right*4. Go left and grab a rock from the rock sack. Roll to the 
left.
Now do not move and throw the rock at the bomb. Go left.
Advance to the left, always hiding, tip toing and following the Slig. Go left.
Here climb, roll to the left and exit the room.
Fall and grab the rock. Go left if desired*5. Climb to the left ledge and JUMP OVER 
BOMB. Go left.
Say something to the Slog and run to the right, remembering to jump over the bomb.
Jump over bomb and " Slog goes boom ". Climb to the left again.
Cross this room.
Now fall and go left. You can also go to the right*6
Talk to Slog and run to the right.
Jump and climb the right ledge. Run to the left again.
Run to the left and JUMP OVER MINE so Slog can die. Go left.
You can go straight left if desired*7. Now try to throw a rock while pressing U, so 
it explodes a bomb next to Slog. If you think you cannot do it, just stand under 
Slog's platform's edge and talk or chant until Slog falls, then quickly climb up. 
Destroy mines ( throw while ducking ) and jump over remaining bomb. Go left.
Now only do a long jump to the left. ( do not be scared ) and Voil….
Now let's check those * spots

*1: enter through portal.
JUMP IN THE MOMENT YOU APPEAR. Keep grabbed until Slig goes to the right. Follow 
him tip toing. Do a running jump and grab to the platform at the right. Climb when 
the lower Slig goes away. Now climb where the mudokons are and go left following 
the Slig.
Here hide in shadows. From this point on, you must move ONLY when the Slig returns 
from his watch. ( when he is at your left ). Wait until he goes to the right and 
returns, then slowly go right, make a mudokon follow you and hide in shadows again. 
Repeat. Now, when you have both mudokons with you, go right and activate bomb, then 
hide in shadows. When the Slig goes to the right, follow him silently ( to ensure 
he dies ). When he touches the bomb, return left and free mudokons. Now, go right 
and down, making sure the Slig does not spot you. Jump and hang to the left ledge, 
wait for the Slig and follow him. Do a running jump and grab to the left ledge. 
Climb when Slig disappears and exit through portal

*2: You cannot do this yet.

*3 Go to the right after Slig explodes, grab a rock and enter portal. Climb and 
follow Slig.
Remain in shadows. Follow Slig and run right, falling. This could be hard to do 
without being shot. Possess Slig from your current location. Make him go down, 
where two Sligs are guarding. Say: Look out! and kill them. Explode Slig. Free 
mudokons. Go left.
Exit through portal

*4 Grab rocks and go right. Destroy land mines ( all ) and enter portal. 
When you enter, immediately roll to the right and enter pipe. Exit through right's 
end.
Now jump over mines while hiding in shadows. Climb to the left ( where upper Slig 
is ) and jump to the right. Hide there. Now roll and cross pipe. In this corner you 
are safe. Now possess them. The lower Slig will explode. With the surviving Slig go 
to the left.
Kill the Slig next to you, then go down and kill the other Sligs. Explode yours.
Now go to the left and free mudokon. Go to the lower right and exit through portal.

*5 Grab some rocks and go to the left, where it appears to be a wall. You will 
fall.
Now throw rocks where the land mines are and destroy them. Chant to open portal. 
Now run to the right and roll where the bombs were. Run and grab to the right 
ledge. Now wait for the Slog and return to the left, and enter portal.
Go tip toing to the right.
Climb to the left ledge. Go left and chant, so the portal opens. Go right without 
leaving platform.
Chant to free mudokon. Run, fall and grab to right ledge. Wait for the Slog and run 
to the left.
Enter through portal.

*6 Go right and down. Open portal and enter through it ( from left to right ). 
When you appear RUN TO THE RIGHT. ( although the Slog is asleep, it will wake up 
soon and kill you if you tip toe)
Climb on platform and enter door.
Now you are in the background. Free mudokon and go to the left.
Open the portal. Return and enter door.
Now, run to the left and exit through portal.

*7 This is only a trap. Makes you repeat a lot of work.

   
7.3 MONSAIC AWAKENED 

Enemies: Native mudokons, harmless Sligs

Go to the left.

Jump over mine and pull lever. Go right.
Jump past meat saws again, and ride platform down.
Go right. Jump over mines ( Long jump )
Roll under pipe and jump over mines. Go down. Now grab the ring to fall. ( It is in 
the dark, so look carefully )
If you want and/or have time, go left, deactivate all three bombs and rescue 
mudokon. After receiving the Shrykull pull the ring.
Now you are in front of the Glukkons. If you have the Shrykull use it now, then 
pull the lever.

Now you are treated to the ending of the game. Depending on the number of rescued 
mudokons, you will receive one of two endings, and an extra code if you rescued 
them all. Congratulations!
