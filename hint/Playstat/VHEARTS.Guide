GENERAL TIPS:
 1) Listen to the dojo man.  Arrows work VERY well against flying 
     creatures and mages.  Magic works VERY well against heavily armored
     dudes (golems and such).  Swords work VERY well against archers.  

 2) Look for secrets on EVERY board.  I like to tilt the board up 

 3) Save your key battles for the following chapter once you've become
     better equipped EXCEPT for the last one.  The sooner you make Ash 
     into a Demigod (ahem... Vandalier) the better.  He has access to 
     EVERY spell in the game!

 4) Use in-battle saves as needed on the later boards (one's with mages).  
     However, only do it once the enemy has complete its turn.
  
 5) I almost never used any items (maybe 3 or 4 megaherbs and 2 mage gems 
     during the entire game and nothing else).  This is NOT a good idea.  
     Your characters gain experience. Sometimes a lot, especially if you're
     using an item on a higher level character!  

 6) Use your ability to know the enemies range of movement

 7) Avoid exposing characters.  Sticking together and using a phalanx 
    
 8) As soon as you can upgrade a characters equipment DO SO.

LEGEND:

 ATK - Attack Value         
 DEF - Defense Value
 COST/VAL -  Cost of Item or Value of Item (if it can't be bought)
 FFOUND - First Found for purchase (referfect to village numbers below),
   in the case of secrets the chapter and scene are listed.
  

 1 - Captial Shumeria       2 - Village of Yuzu      3 - Remote City
 4 - Irusu Village          5 - Khanos City(?)       6 - Kerachi
 7 - Glasgow City           G - Gift                 S - Secret
 V - Value                  R - Range                F - Field

 
NOTE: Although the Gold Axe is equippable (w/ a +0 ATK) I didn't include it
  with the weapons since it's only good for its monetary value.

KEY #2 (Earth Key): Go back to Bar in Yuzu and give Banana to Young man.  

EARTH KEY BATTLE:
-----------------
Enemy: 2 Hunters (L11 75HP), 2 Hunterimps (L11 75HP), 3 Shooterimps (L11 75HP),
  3 Corsairs (L11 75HP), 2 Grenadiers (L11 75HP), 2 Crimson Archers (L11 75HP)
Chest:  ICE PRISM
Strategy: Just split party and sweep towards chest.  You're archers and 
  spellcasters will have to do most of the work on the last of the enemy.  

Section 4: Castle Ruins
-----------------------
Enemy: 6 Madsoldiers (L11 84HP), 4 Shooterimps (L9 63HP), 2 Evil Statues

  1) Mage Oil 2) Moodring
Secrets: 1
  1) Ironboots (W end of platform in strange tile)
  2) Chain (cross shaped piece of land in NE corner W of moat)
Strategy: Beginning is VERY TOUGH! Split party exactly in half.  Use everything
  you can to your best advantage.  Namely, keep along wall as much as possible,
  heal often and move your characters so they can't be ganged up on.  Keep 
  fighters up front (better arrow defense).  Don't let your hawknight (assuming
  you have one) out in the open since the Shooterimps will waste him/her!!!  
  Carefully take out Madsoldiers as efficiently as possible.  Once they're gone,
  move entire party to elevators.  Get up and kill off Shooterimps.  Grab the 
  chests and send someone to get secret #1. Kill off statues and let rest of
  enemy come to you.  Get secret #2 and move to Ruins entrance.

Section 5: Castle Ruins II (Inside Ruins w/Magnus)
-------------------------- 
Enemy: 4 Madsoldiers (L12 91HP), 3 Bloodghosts (L12 97HP), 3 Shooterimps 
  (L11 75HP), 2 Dark Golems (L12 104HP), 1 Magnus Dark Lord (L15 128HP) -- 4200G
Chests: NONE
Secrets: NONE
Strategy:  Split party in two and bring them up both sets of stairs against the
  wall where they can easily take the Shooterimps & War Ghosts.  Once done,  
  move them back down steps to deal with Madsoldiers then up again for Golems.
  Keep healer near Eleni & Ash at all times.  Nail Magnus.

SCENE: Magnus dying tells of attempt to retrieve magic stone before arrow put
  in him by Kane.  Ash backs down from Dolf & Kane allowing them to take Magnus.
  (Bullied by his own past)  Troops rally around Ash who decides to go after
  Magnus, Eleni & Huxley.  Kira watches from behind tree.

Enemy: 12 Guard Dogs (L1 13HP) -- 3960G

  retreat paths, send archer/hawknight diagonally left & right, send rest up
  middle.  Split middle contingent and converge on dogs in each corner.  Pick
  up secret in final round before killing off rest of dogs.

NEW PARTY MEMBER! 
  Zohar Abu Sa'id (Mage, Level ?)

Section 2: Plain of Sorrow II
-----------------------------
Note: Keep at least one tower safe for 5 rounds.
Enemy:  6 Sparkles (L8 67HP) to start, filling in with Sparkles (L10 82HP) as
  the computer has need. (11 of these showed up for me). GOLD: 410G/Sparkle,
  -100G/Tower Lost
Chests: NONE
Secrets: NONE
Strategy: Pick a tower and surround it with your 4 charachters.  Simple.  I 
  wouldn't suggest trying to defend more than one tower, you'll thin your forces
  and lose.


Section 3: Irusu Village
------------------------
Enemy: 3 Blood Bats (L12 97HP), 3 Grenadiers (L11 75HP), 5 Centurions 
  (L12 91HP),  1 Deacon (L14 75HP), 1 Warlock (L14 82HP), 1 Zoot Gach 
  (L17 126HP) -- 6450G

  1) Megaherb 2) Elixir
Secrets: 2
  1) Unicorn (Crater S of Ash's party)
  2) Bag Of Coin (Dirt Patch on E side of hill Zoot is standing on)
Strategy:  Get secret #1 & hold back Ash's party.  Send Diego to handle bat &
  Clint after chest nearest him.  Slowly advance Ash's party over bridge taking
  out as many Grenadiers as possible.  Send Clint after dirt patch w/coin once
  he's got chest.  Send figter after 2nd chest & kill off everyone else but 
  Deacon (you might need another enemy alive).  Protect last enemy from Clive
  until 2nd chest has been opened.

Section 4: Basil Gate
---------------------
Enemy: 2 Grenadiers (L14 94HP), 4 Centurions (L14 105HP), 2 Blood Bats 
  (L14 112HP), 1 Deacon (L14 75HP), 1 Warlock (L14 82HP) -- 5000G

  1) Megaherb 2) Mage Gem
Secrets: 2
  1) Tarot (Cross-shaped dirt in SE corner of map)
  2) Ironboot (Cross-shaped stone in middle of N. tower)
Strategy: Keep party together.  Move them to their right positioning Ash behind
  boudler.  Make sure everyone is one square back from the little castle so they
  can't get hit in the 1st round.  ROUND 2: push boulder, move fwd & Rolling 
  Fire 3 enemies.  Move mage & use Piercing Light on 3.  Move everyone else 
  behind & next to Ash forming a tight phalanx.  Kill off everyone but the 
  Deacon.  Get the chests and secrets at your leisure then kill the Deacon.

Section 5: Reed Highway
-----------------------
Note: Keep Enemy from Escaping.
Enemy: 4 Guardogs (L18 123HP), 2 Centurions (L15 112HP), 2 Crimson Archers
  (L15 100HP), 1 Lando Hitman (L19 126HP)  -- 5500G
Chests: NONE
Secrets: 1
  1) Magic Staff (Crater @ E. end of map)
Strategy: Wait 4 turns & attack, hitting them as hard as possible (lots of 
  spells with fields).  Let one fighter start moving to E. end of map after 
  secret killing only those left escaping east.  Have Huxley lower bridge and 
  start heading to crate at W. end of map.  Push it onto walkway when he gets 
  there. Bring in party from rear and trap remaining enemy on other side of 
  walkway.  

NEW PARTY MEMBER! 
  Darius (Archer, Level ?)

Section 6: Prison Fortress
--------------------------
Enemy: 8 Juggernauts (L13 112HP), 2 Mimics (L18 123HP)
Chests: 6 
  1) Mimic (nearest - left of entrance) 
  2) Megaherb (by N. gate)
  3) Mimic (1st inside N. Gate heading E)
  4) Spirit Staff (2nd inside N. Gate heading E)
  5) Megaherb (E. side of map, 1st S of NE Gate)
  6) Grimhelm (SE corner)
Secrets: NONE
Switch Pattern:
  1) Middle of map --> SW Gate
  2) SW switch --> N Gate
  3) S switch --> NE & S Gate
  4) NE switch --> Middle Gate
Strategy: Follow swtiches in order staring w/ middle as they're available.  As
  Darius says, it's worthless to hit the Juggernauts anywhere but from behind.
  I like to split up party & play ring around the rosie with entrance stone 
  circle.  Just beware of Juggernauts' movement range.  Don't mix in mimics 
  until the Juggernauts' in the immediate area have been dispatched. Send Darius
  to SW switch and rest of part to N Gate.  Once inside N Gate, let the 
  remaining Juggernauts chase Darius.  Get all the chests and catch up to 
  him in the middle.  Easy!

Section 7: Prison Yard -- Escape of Clint
-----------------------------------------
Enemy: 3 Blood Bats (L16 127HP), 2 Centurions (L14 105HP), 2 Grenadiers
  (L12 81HP), 2 Centurions (L13 98HP), 2 Juggernauts (L14 120HP), 2 Deacons
  (L15 80HP), 2 Warlocks (L15 88HP), 1 Dumas Jailmaster (L18 152HP) -- 11800G
Chests: NONE
Secrets: 2
  1) Bag of Coin (S side of map down stairs in shell)
  2) KEY #3 (Mana Key) (NW corner in cracked hole)
Item: Zen Robe for defeating Dumas!
Strategy: VERY TOUGH!!!  Have Eleni get on platform in middle and cast Phase
  Shift.  Take down Centurion to Clint's left.  ROUND 2: Assuming Eleni 
  survived, bring her a Megaherb! Either park her under Dumas' overhang to
  cast a couple of Roman Fires on Bats & Grenadiers or pull her back to wall
  where Ash & Co. come in.  Move Ash & Co. (The arrive in ROUND 2) around wall,
  keeping Healer to inside wall to take care of people in yard.  Take out 
  Warlock by Ash ASAP.  Split off someone to get secret #1, hit switch to 
  lower wall.  Move Archer/Hawknight to secret #2 as fast as possible cleaning 
  up any enemy descending the stairs.  This should leave Dumas. Play hit and run
  with him if he comes after Clint or back up if he comes after Ash until
  secret #2 is found if he comes after Ash).  Whatever you do, DO NOT corner 
  Dumas.  Make sure he's in the open, then hit him with everything you have.

SCENE: Eleni learns of Magnus' death.  Clive informs of victories.  Hel moving
  to fight resistance on 2 fronts.  Ash is told to go to Kerachi to find out
  about the Royal Ring.  Diego disturbed by this.  Clive heading East.  Ash
  whines about past.

MANA KEY BATTLE: 
----------------
Enemy: 1 Brigand (L18 133HP), 19 Mimics (L18 123HP)
Chest: MANA PRISM
Strategy: The key is to try to get to the SE corner chest ASAP w/o killing ALL
  of your enemies.  If you kill all visible enemies you leave battle w/o your
  prize!  Split party in all directions opening chests and killing Mimics along
  the way.  Have a hawknight get to SE quickly, making a direct thru the chests.
  I like to keep the Brigand for last.  

* Note: MAKE SURE YOU'RE FULLY EQUIPPED  (Steel Armor/Weapons) before leaving
   Khanos City to do battle w/Crimson Guard!!!!
Section 1: Khanos City
----------------------

  [2 Crimson Knights (L19 140HP), 1 Kurtz War Master (L21 143HP)],
  [3 Crimson Knights (L19 140HP), 1 Kane Assassin (L22 161HP),
  1 Crimson Hawk (L18 142HP)], 2 Crimson Knights (L19 140HP),
  [3 Crimson Knights (L19 140HP), 1 Sabrina Valkyrie (L18 119HP),
  1 Crimson Hawk (L18 142HP)] -- 15840G
Chests: 2
  1) Holy H20 2) Aura Gem
Secrets: 1
  1) Gold Axe (Near lampost in NE corner is stone with 3 dimples)
Strategy: This is pretty bad, but NOT if you stick together and heal after 
  every round!!!  Push box to East so Kurtz's men can't come thru.  Move party
  to E. island leaving a Guardsman (or Ash) in middle of each plank bridge.
  You may have to clear a couple of soldiers to position yourself on the island.
  (A couple of Roman Fires & arrows should butter them up enough to take the
  island).  Get 1st chest.  Now, play the waiting game, picking off attackers
  (Let them attack 1st!!!) slowly.  Try to take care of the Crimson Hawks 1st.
  ROUND 5: Phase Shift as much as possible as a large # of attackers should now
  be in range.  After a couple more rounds of winnowing down the enemy w/spells,
  archers & attacks, only a couple bosses & misc. enemies should be left. 
  (You should have taken out Kane when you took the islandl.)  Make sure you
  pick them off one at a time.  Let them come to you, being very aware of their
  attack ranges.  Have a Guardsman take the hits from Dalls & Kurtz then nail
  them in the following rounds.  (NOTE: Ash isn't too good against Dallas).
  Have Hawnknight get secrets and 2nd chest then move party to entrance. 

NOTE: Even after defeating enemy you can't go back to Khanos City!!!

-----------------------------
SCENE: Band meets Xeno (Zohar's pupil)

Chests: NONE
Secrets: 2
  1) Kingfoil (Hole in NE corner of map)
  2) Aura Gem (Shell @top of falls)
Strategy: Relatively easy except for Bugaboos which tend to gang up on a 
  character from a VERY long distance!  Send a small contingent (I sent 3) 
  which contains at least one hightly mobile character to NE bridge.  Send a 
  couple guys to deal w/Bugaboos on little hill SE of start.  Have them join
  rest of party moving over the bridge W. of start.  Get secrets and kill off
  rest of enemy targeting Bugaboos 1st. 
 
Go to Kerachi - to Carlo's Mansion - SCENE: Carlo revealed to be Diego's father.
  Carlo in purchase of Royal Ring.  Diego has forsake family name due to 
  contempt for father.  Exchangefor Ring in Old Town Warehouse

Section 3:  Kerachi: Old Town Warehouse

  (L13 88HP) -- 13760G
Chests: NONE
Secrets: NONE
Strategy: Only beginnning is difficult.  Pick a corner and move entire party
  there. Have mages take out a golem & skeleton.  Continue by keeping part 
  on one side of map (fewer Eggworms in attack range).  Just avoid allowing
  a party member to get ganged up on and its easy.  Let ground enemeis come to
  you.  Hit them hard then clean up the worms.

SCENE: Turns out to be a set-up due to Carlo & Xeno (Surprised?  Yeah - sure 
  you are) Carlo interrupts party getting swallowed by fire.  Carlo's past.
  Ring being taken back to Shumeria by train.  Diego & Carlo make up (sorta.)

Chests: NONE
Secrets: 1
  1) Ramen (grate on head car)
Strategy: EASY.  Just keep moving fwd, keep tight.  Don't let your Hawknight(s)
  get nailed.  MAKE sure you get the secret before defeating Dallas.

NOTE: Go back to tavern in Kerachi & trade Ramen, Macroman & Tarot for 
  KEY #4 (Key of Chaos).

Section 5: Fort Dain
--------------------
(Destroy Devices in 8 turns)
Enemy: 3 Skeletons (L20 147HP), 2 Eggworms (L19 126HP), 4 Acid Ghosts
  (L20 157HP), 2 Deathangels (L19 110HP), 3 Gold Golems (L20 168HP),

Chests: 2
  1) Life Orb 2) L. Mask
Secrets: 1
  1) Mithril (Shell in SE corner)
Strategy: SAVE Battle Often.  Time's NOT as much of a problem as you might
  think, but the Deathangels ARE.  Send all straight ahead to NW corner in 
  1st round.  staying out of range of Deathangels Harmful Wave spell.  Take 
  out skeletons and split party.  Send a couple of people towards the golems (I 
  used Ash, a Sorcerer and a Hawknight).  Don't let these people break the 
  line of sight of far Deathangel until rest of party enters its line of sight
  from opposing corner.  Send everyone else W.  PAUSE @each corner to keep out 
  of Deathangel range.  Make sure an Archer is with you to handle the Death 
  Angels.  Keep tight.  Keys: Hawknights on Skeletons & mages, Eggworms nail 
  Hawknights, magic on Golems.

  1 Mimic (L21 143HP) -- 17100G
Chests: 1 
  1) Plate (NE corner, other chest is a Mimic)
Secrets: NONE
Strategy:  Only the 1st 2 rounds are nast.  Move party to left (W.) side of ship
  putting Sorcerers @front & archers behind.  Only step on 1st plank off ship!
  Next round go in blazing w/a couple of Phase Shifts right in the middle of 
  the enemy.  Concentrate on taking out the Deathangels 1st, Eggworms 2nd.
  Bring up everyone else & cleanup.  Leave one golem alone (the one farthest E.)
  Bring party to land & play keep away from golem as you use your most mobile
  characters to get crate on ship and push and push it all the way to the NE
  corner to get chest. 


NOTE: I saved this one for Sorbo in Chapter V!
CHAOS KEY BATTLE:
-----------------
Enemy: 18 (Clay, Dark & Gold) Golems (L21 176HP)
Chest: CHAOS PRISM
Strategy: NOTE: Need ALL 3 boxed to form bridge to chest.  Golems are easy.
  Just do a bunch of phase shifts and a couple of attacks and you're done.  
  Push the lowest tier box to wall so characters can get up to 2nd level.  
  Leave 3 golems @top alone.  Spend the next couple of rounds pushing 1st tier
  box ALL the wasy around by chest.  The trick is NOT to get the 1st tier box 
  trapped in a corner.  Once you've got the 1st box in place, move a character
  (or 2) w/healing ability (I used Ash) to 3rd tier.  DON'T ATTACK the golems.
  Push the 2nd tier box thru aqueduct on top of 1st box.  Push the 3rd tier
  box to the spot the 2nd one started.  Push it through aqueduct on top of 
  other two and VOILA, instant bridge (Beauty, eh?).  Get Prism & Kill Golems.

  2) Mithril  (W end of map in tracks in snow)
Items: Get Panzer Claws for defeating Kurtz
Strategy: Take out the Armors & Priest behind you (They are VERY susceptible to
  magic).  Get secret #1.  Move about 1/2 way across the bridge & wait for 
  Hawks to get in close.  Take them ALL out before moving everybody across the
  bridge.  Keep your Hawknights close to the hill so they can't be hit by the 
  Shooters.  Have them move towards the Warlock.  As soon as no more than one
  Shooter can hit your Hawknight, have him/her take out the Warlock.  Don't 
  kill Kurtz yet! Hug wall & keep group tight for easy healing.  Get in close
  to hill and nail the Shooters (an Avalance & arrow work perfect!) Don't 
  bother w/the Shooters unless you KNOW you can take one out in one round
  (Damn Priest!) Move your Hawknight(s) around to get secret #2 and to kill 
  Priest.  Finish off Kurtz.

  Send someone to get secret #1.  Taken them out as you can (MUST defeat them 
  in 1 round to be effective) Ignore guards.  ROUND 4: Kane's maen show up &
  all guards now in riverbed.  Flood them by pressing switch.  Clean up 
  surrounding enemies.  Now things get NASTY.  Stick close to house on N. side
  of map & move party together toward Sabrina's group.  Move fighters in 
  phalanx on ground.  DON'T leave Hawknights out in the open!  Once all enemy 
  are drawn together, hit them hard.  This should leave Sabrina & Priest.  
  Get secret #2 and END IT.

  (L26 202HP), 2 Dark Mages (L26 148HP)
Chest: LOGOS PRISM
Strategy: Assuming your fully equipped this is EASY.  It may be easy but its
  also extremely tedious and boring! (around 25 rounds worth of tedium). This
  board is simply a huge spiral staircase tower w/monsters.  Don't waste your
  attack spells until closer to end.  Stay single file against tower wall as
  you climb.  Pause only to put an arrow thru the Mages.

Enemy: 3 Crimson Shooters (L26 170HP), 5 Crimson Knights (L27 196HP),
  5 Crimson Armors (L27 224HP), 3 Crimson Priests (L27 224HP), 
  3 Crimson Warlocks (L26 148HP), 1 Kane Assassin (L29 210HP) who becomes
  AARRRGH!!! 1 Kane Black Knight (L30 217HP) -- 48000G

Secrets: 1
  1) Necklace (grate just S of NE far tower flag) 
Items: Get Caliburn for Kane
Strategy: The beginning is relatively easy.  Take out the Warlock & Priest. 
  Don't leave your Hawknights out in the open.  Have your archers take out the
  Warlock & Priest on the next tower.  Don't move party until they're dead.
  Now.. Here's where life gets interesting.  After clearing all enemy off the
  ground,  take ou the Shooter on top of the wall w/ your archers. DO NOT 
  push the boulders yet.  Once he's dead, position your party tightly against
  the wall leaving one lane open for a boulder (either one, it doesn't matter).
  Make sure all of your are at full health.  Once you're ready to storm the
  castle, push a boulder down into the wall as the FIRST move of your round
  (I recommend a Hawknight).  Move the entire party towards the castle wall. 
  Keep them tight, THINK HEALING ZONES!  Once the wall is down, Xeno pops by to
  turn Kane into a Black Knight.  He now has a TRULY NASTY spell called Plasma
  Wave which, apart from the fact that it has infinite range will RIP your 
  party apart (50-150HP per depending on class!)  This is by far THE nastiest
  spell in the ENTIRE game.  In the next round hit all 
  enemy but Kane HARD (Salamander works well on armour guys).  Make sure you 
  nail that Warlock w/your archers or he will make your lives XTRA miserable!
  Keep tight, heal every turn and hed to the N. stairway.  Hopefully, only Kane
  and that damn Priest will be left.  Once you start up the steps, Kane will 
  give up on the magic and come after you (what a dolt!)  Surround hime w/your
  best fighters.  Dispatch your Hawknights & Archers to take the Priest and get
  the secret.  Now just ... kill... KANE!   

Section 2: Cobalt Beach
-----------------------
Enemy: 4 Blood Bats (L28 217HP), 4 Grenadiers (L28 182HP), 7 Centurions
  (L28 203HP) -- 33000G
Chests: 3
  1) Life Orb (SW Corner)
  2) Holy H20 (E. Plateau)
  3) Ragnarok (NE Corner)
Secrets: NONE
Strategy: What can I say about this board???  PATHETICALLY EASY!

Section 3: Captial Shumeria
---------------------------
(Defeat Xeno)
Enemy: 4 Bahamuts (L29 225HP), 4 Hellknights (L29 210HP), 4 Dark Mages
  (L29 165HP), 2 Mega Cannon (L28 182HP), 2 Mega Guards (L30 248HP),
  1 Xeno (L34 192HP) -- 43200G
Chests: NONE
Secrets: 2
  1) Mojo Robe (Manhole Cover directly in front of party
  2) Gold Axe (Manhole Cover in NE corner)
Items: Get Runewand for killing Xeno
Strategy: Wait a turn.  Then have archers take out 1st Dark Mage.  Pull rest
  of party to SE corner by lampost.  The key is to wait for them to come to
  you, then when a Dark Mage is in range nail him w/long range shots.  The other
  enemies are easy.  Dealing w/more than one mage @ a time is VERY difficult!!!
  It's a good bet to keep Ash & your spellcasters exposed, they can handle it.
  When the 4th Dark Mage is almost in range and Xeno takes his 1st steps toward
  you, start heading up right side of fountain.  Send off a Hawknight to grab
  secret #2. Clean up, Xeno's a pathetic wimp under all those robes.

HEAVEN KEY BATTLE:
------------------
Enemy: 4 Zoot Thief Lords (L29 210HP), 4 Dumas Jailmasters (L29 240HP),
  2 Lando Hitmans (L29 189HP), 4 Kurtz War Masters (L29 195HP),
  4 Sabrina Valkyries (L29 189HP), 4 Dallas Greatarmors (L29 240HP),
  4 Dark Mages (L29 165HP), 2 Evil Statues (L29 165HP) 
Chest: HEAVEN PRISM
Strategy: Talk about your ghosts from Christmas Past!  Pretty easy as long
  as you keep your together.  Keep good fighters (Ash) up front.  Approach
  the Mages carefully and its a walk in the park.

Before leaving the Dojo make sure to advance Ash to a Demigod (uh .. Vandalier)

Section 4: Captial Shumeria 
---------------------------
SCENE: Arris, it turns out, was Dolf's father.  Dolf ticked that the people
  have forgotten him (blah, blah, blah...).  Unclean must be cleansed by fire!
  A really moving litany by Ash...
(Defeat Dolf)
Enemy: 3 Mega Guards (L30 248HP), 3 Bahamuts (L30 232HP), 3 Hellknights
  (L30 217HP), 2 Dark Mages (L30 170HP), 1 Dolf Doom Lord (L34 280HP) who 
  becomes ... 1 Dolf Dark Angel (L32 165HP) -- 45900G (as if it really mattered)
Chests: NONE
Secrets: NONE
Strategy: Wade in and kick their sorry butts!!!  Dolf is REALLY Easy.  If you
  work it right, you can finish him AND kill off his Dark Angel form before 
  your turn ends.

ENDING: Well, I have to leave something... 
  NOTE: The basic ending is the same whether you become Vandalier or not.  
  If you're a Vandalier you get an extra couple screens about how you're 
  a Vandalier genius or some such nonesense
