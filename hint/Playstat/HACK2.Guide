1) BYPASS SONY'S NEWEST FEATURE AGAINST SOFTWARE PIRACY
--------------------------------------------------------

Yes! it's still possible to play PSX copies on the NEWEST US/JAP/EURO PSX's.
The ROM'S of the new PlayStations are once again updated and this time the
PSX will reset/just-not-boot if the BOOT/ORIGINAL CD is removed and replaced
by a copy.

The PSX detects if a CD is removed by the 3 little silver coloured PINS located
in the center of the CD-UNIT. So now they are here for 2 reasons:

1: To keep the CD in PLACE when spinning.
2: To detect if a CD is removed. ( That was already there in the previous ver
   sions of the PSX but it would only stop the CD from spinning when it was
   removed )

The only thing you have to do if you want to run copies on the latest PSX is
to mount 2 wires paralell over the connecter ( which leads to the 3-pin-detec-
tor ) and put a switch between the two wires et VOILA.

If all went well and your PSX is still alive you should do the following:

1: insert an original game
2: wait untill you hear the ( annoying ) boot samples OR see the white screen
   with the logo appear and activate the switch and remove the ORIGINAL.
   ( This has to be done right after eachother )
3: Quickly ( about 3 secs ) insert the COPY and bring the switch back in normal
   ( open ) position.
4: If all went well you are now playing a copy of R.R. Rev. or whatever.

It may sound a bit complicated but after 2 or three tries a blind person can do
it.

I didn't actually test this methode but common sence tells me that it will
work!


2) NEWEST SOFTWARE PROTECTION BYPASS
------------------------------------

Some games ,and rumoured all new games, have a protection against the audio
menu trick. I don't know how to do it but this is a way to bypass it:

1: Insert an original CD and activate the lid closed detection ( by switch or 
   thoothpick, doesn't matter.
2: Switch the PlayStation on ( yes it was off ;) )
3: wait untill you hear the boot sample/see the white screen with logo and
   quickly remove the boot CD and replace it by a copy
4: You're again booting a copied game!

This trick can be mixed with the `2 second-toc-trick' for perfect audio.


3) PLAY COPIES WITH PERFECT CD-AUDIO!

As we all know the Table Of Contents, from now on called TOC, is taken from the
original/boot CD and not of the copy. This will cause the music to be a bit
different than when you would be playing an original. ( with sometimes annoying
short loops in the music )
The TOC _is_ actually on the copy but isn't read from the copy but from the
boot/original CD. The TOC is read right after the protection is read from the
boot CD.
Here is what to do to have perfect AUDIO:

1: goto the audio menu
2: insert an original and switch your `lid open/closed switch'-switch ;)
3: wait 2 seconds and remove your spinning original and quickly insert a
   copy ( you have about 2/3 secs to do it )
4: exit the audio menu and you will now boot with PERFECT music

This is EXTREMELY hard to do but well worth the trouble for excellent games
with fucked up loops! ( It takes me an avarage of 5 mins to do it :( )

Can someone please copy the ROM'S of the developers PSX and upload the BIN file
at your local console BBS please. ( The developers PSX ROM doesn't have any
protection whatsoever ) Or we could wait for the guys at FFE to make a hardware
device to bypass ALL this shit.

4) THE GOOD OLD AUDIO MENU TRICK
--------------------------------

1: go into the audio menu
2: insert an original/boot CD
3: put a toothpick between the LID and the `lid open/closed switch' ( which is
   located at the top right in the PSX )
4: wait untill the CD stops spinning and swap it with a COPY
5: exit the audio menu and your PSX will now boot from a COPY.

This is th trick I used the most so it is wise to mount 2 wires with a switch
paralell over the `lid open/cloded switch' for more convenient swapping.

This trick was brought to us by BamBam ( many thanks to him )

Sorry for my horrible English,
