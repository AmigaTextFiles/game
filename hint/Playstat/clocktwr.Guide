L o c a t i o n s   o f   p e o p l e :
---------------------------------------

Beth - She is in the room with a floor section missing that you can lose
Scissorman in. (NOT the room you start in.)

Harris - He is in the Kitchen...he will come out of the food storage room
and give you the Fireplace key. (Unless you are going for the C ending, 
DO NOT IN ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, USE THE KEY HE GIVES YOU. You will find another
way to get to the area the fireplace key takes you to.

Nolan - He is in a stone coffin, in to the lower right of the stairs. (The
stairs to the right of the locked metal bars you need the Mansion key for.)

Tim - He is in the wine cellar, which is under a hollow floor board in the
room Harris comes out of. (The food storage room next to the kitchen.) There
is a switch in there which opens the floorboard I believe.

Gotts - He is in the room with all the dead children. To get to him, you'll
have to take the "dry path."

Professor Barton - If you kill the fake Scissorman in the church, you'll
find him there. If you don't kill the fake Scissorman in the church, then
he'll be under the fountain.

Kay - She is the only one I haven't found yet. (Not sure if she even can be
found anywhere in the castle...it's strange.)

Edward - In the room under the fountain.

Jennifer - In the church.

I t e m s   y o u   n e e d :
-----------------------------
I THINK these are all the items you pretty much need. (E-mail me if I'm
wrong about this.)

Flashlight (Endings: A, B) - You NEED this to get a A or B ending with
Helen. It is in the locker in Scenario 1, in the room on the second floor
where you get the fax message.

Batteries for Flashlight [Tape Recorder] (Endings: A, B) - In the room you
find Nolan in. You will only be allowed to pick up the batteries if you have
the Flashlight and have been told you need Batteries. (See "Getting Door
Spell.")

Copper Book (Endings: A, B, C, D) - I believe this is under the covers of
the bed in the Servent's quarters. (Where the hand attacks you.)

Lead balls (Endings: A, B, C, D) - Needed to take the "Dry Path." Also in 
the room you find Nolan in.

Castle Map (Endings: A, B, C, D) - Allows you to enter the trap door under
the fountain. Found inside the Cosmetics box in the coat room. (The room
that has that statue in it to the left of the church.)

Cosmetics box (Endings: A, B, C, D) - Contains "Castle Map." Requires 
"Cosmetics key" (Not sure if that's what it's called) to be opened.

Cosmetics box key (Endings: A, B, C, D) - Found in "Unopenable box."

Unopenable box (Endings: A, B, C, D) - Found in the back room of the fire
room. (Same room which leads to the "Dry path" selection room.)

Door Spell (Endings: A, B) - Needed to kill the true Scissorman. (See
"Getting Door Spell.")

Library Key (Endings: A, B, C, D) - Found in same room as Door spell.

Mansion Key (Endings: A, B, C, D) - I THINK (I don't remember) it's in the
drawer of the desk in the Servent's quarters. (Room where you also find
Copper Book.)

---------------------------------------------------
H o w   t o   c o m p l e t e   t h e   l e v e l :
---------------------------------------------------

SECTION 1
GETTING LIBRARY KEY (Endings A, B, C, D):

>From the main hall, go upstairs. On the back wall, where the two symmetrical
doors are, go in the left one. You'll be in a room with two beds, a
fireplace, and other things. Look at the desk/nightstand between the two
beds against the far wall, then go to the right corner of the room. (To the
right of the fireplace) and get the Library Key.

If you are trying to get endings A or B, go to SECTION 2. 
If you are trying to get ending C, go to SECTION 3.
If you are trying to get ending D, go to SECTION 4.

SECTION 2
GETTING THE BATTERIES (Endings A, B only):

Go in the same room as the Library key (Above paragraph) and use the
flashlight on the fireplace. (Be careful not to click on the fireplace 
twice without the flashlight, you die a somewhat creepy death.) After using
the flashlight you'll be told you have no batteries. Go into the room you
find Nolan in (See Characters:Nolan) and on the floor on the right side of
the room is a tape recorder. (Doesn't look like one much ;p) Pick it up
and you'll get batteries for your flashlight. Go back to the room and use
the flashlight again, and you'll receive the door spell.

Go to SECTION 4. 

SECTION 3
GETTING THE FIREPLACE KEY (Ending C only):

Go into the kitchen, and you'll meet Harris. He'll give you the fireplace
key. (If you aren't trying to get ending C, you can still get this, but DO
NOT USE IT.)

Go to SECTION 4.

SECTION 4
GETTING THE LEAD BALLS (Endings A, B, C, D):

Go into the room where you find Nolan, (See Characters:Nolan) and on the
right side of the room there is a chest that has lead balls in it.

Go to SECTION 5.

SECTION 5
THE COPPER BOOK (Endings A, B, C, D)

Go into the Servent's Quarters. (There is a closet with a frock coat in the
room.) Open the desk and get attacked by the hand. Pound on square to get it
off you. Grab the quill on the desk and stab it. Then you'll get the clue
about going in the fireplace. Now go to the bed, and look under the covers
and you'll find the copper book.

If you are trying to get endings A, B, or D, go to SECTION 7.
If you are trying to get ending C, go to SECTION 6.

SECTION 6
THE FIREPLACE AND THE CHURCH (Endings C only)

Go into the room with the locked fireplace. (The upper right door upstairs
in the main hall.) Unlock it with the key Harris gave you. (ONLY IF YOU WANT
THE C OR D ENDINGS!) Then crawl through. Proceed to your right, and you
will enter the church, and see Jennifer get killed. Scissorman will exit.
Then, exit the church to the south, and you'll be back in the main hall.

Go to SECTION 7.

SECTION 7
THE "DRY PATH" (Endings A, B, C, D)

Go into the "Fire room". (From the main hall, go in the far left door up the
stairs.) Go into the back room and examine the scratches on the floor. Then
use the copper book on the bookcase with a missing book. Enter the "Path"
room. Drop the lead balls down the pits. DO NOT GO DOWN THE PITS THAT YOU
HEAR A WATER SOUND. You will die :) Instead, go down the one pit that has
a "dry" sound. Every time I have played it was the middle one. (I'm not
sure if it's random or not.) Then after a little climbing up and down,
you'll find Gotts, who will give you a revolver. Exit the room.

If you are trying to get endings A, B, or D, go to SECTION 8.
If you are trying to get ending C, go to SECTION 11.

SECTION 8
JENNIFER IN THE CHURCH (Endings A, B, D only)

Go back out into the main hall. (SAVE HERE!!!) Use the revolver on the 
locked church door. (The HUGE door at the bottom right area of the screen.)
You'll see a little sequence of Jennifer up on a cross, and Scissorman will
come out...

If you are trying to get ending A, or D go to SECTION 9.
If you are trying to get ending B, go to SECTION 10.

SECTION 9
SAVING JENNIFER (Ending A or D only)

Right when Scissorman comes out to kill Jennifer, you have about 3 seconds
to click on him with the revolver. (If you don't do this right Jennifer will
die and you will NOT BE ABLE TO GET THE A OR D ENDING, so reload your
saved game from SECTION 8 and try again.) If you do it correctly, you'll
hit Scissorman in the back, save Jennifer, and talk to Barton.

Go to SECTION 11.

SECTION 10
LETTING JENNIFER DIE (Ending B only)

You'll see the Jennifer on the Cross sequence. (Rather symbolic isn't it?)
Let her die. (How sad...)

Go to SECTION 11.

SECTION 11
THE MAP (Endings A, B, C, D)

Return to the back room of the Fire room. (Where the moving bookcase that
leads to the "Dry Path" room is.) On the top of one of the bookcases, is a
box. Use the stepladder, and grab it. You now have the "Unopenable box."
Now go back into the main fire room, and throw it into the fire. You'll get
the "Cosmetics keys." Now go back to the Church. Go in the lower left door.
Then in the next hall, go in the far left door. Then in the coat room,
open the "Cosmetics box" and you will get the "Mansion Map." You will
discover that there is a trapdoor in the fountain room. Now proceed there...

Go to SECTION 12.

SECTION 12
THE FOUNTAIN ROOM (Endings A, B, C, D)

Now that you know about the trap door, click on the second tree to the right
of the fountain (or something like that) to use the valve and drain the
fountain...now enter the trap door and descend...

If you are trying to get ending A, go to SECTION 13.
If you are trying to get ending B, go to SECTION 14.
If you are trying to get ending C, go to SECTION 15.
If you are trying to get ending D, go to SECTION 16.

SECTION 13
THE "A" ENDING

You'll descend and enter the passage. Walk to the end of the passage and
enter the room. You'll find Scissorman, and have a small talk with him, and
then he'll chase you. Run accross the bridge to the altar. Put the statue
down on the altar. The "Door" will open and Helen will utter the "Door
Spell." Now kick back, and watch. Everything after that point in time is
part of the A ending. You don't need to do anything to move it along...

GAME FINISH

SECTION 14
THE "B" ENDING

You'll descend and enter the passage. Walk to the end of the passage and
enter the room. You'll find Scissorman, and have a small talk with him, and
then he'll chase you. Run accross the bridge to the altar. Put the statue
down on the altar. The "Door" will open and Helen will utter the "Door
Spell." Now kick back, and watch. Everything after that point in time is
part of the B ending. You don't need to do anything to move it along...

GAME FINISH

SECTION 15
THE "C" ENDING

You'll descend and enter the passage. Now kick back, and watch. Everything
after that point in time is part of the C ending. You don't need to do 
anything to move it along...

GAME FINISH

SECTION 16
THE "D" ENDING

I haven't actually gotten this one myself, but the instructions I gave you
should be good enough to get you to the point near the D ending...so, go on
from here and see what happens...

GAME FINISH

SPECIAL SECTION 
THE "E" ENDING

I haven't actually gotten this one myself either, but from what I hear, you
just have to NOT get the statue in Scenario 2. (I guess by going yourself?)

GAME FINISH

I hope you enjoyed my FAQ. That's all for now. Ciao and good gaming to you :)
