RESIDENT EVIL 2 WALK THRU

Claire First Scenario...
From the starting point, clear a path through the zombies and make
your way to the gun shop. There, you will find two boxes of handgun
ammunition. After the zombies break though the glass, you can either
flee in terror or kill the zombies and get the shop owner's shotgun.
In the alley behind the shop, make your way to the back of the van and
collect the handgun rounds. The zombies will break through the gate;
take care of them and go to the door on the other side of the
basketball court. From this point, run by the zombies and head to the
bus. Once inside, take the handgun bullets out of the bag, take care
of the flesh eaters, and head for the front door of the bus. From
here, it's only a short distance to the police station, but beware -
many of the undead are waiting.
In the main hall of the police station, pick up the handgun bullets
and ink ribbon. You can save here at the typewriter. Go into the
unlocked door and speak with the wounded officer who will give you a
key card. Use the key card on the computer in the main hall where you
first entered the station house. It unlocks the other door. In this
room, you'll find a police memo, and locked inside the desk is a can
of first-aid spray. Head through the door next to the window. In the
hallway, you'll come across an officer who's had a slight problem with
his head. If you double-check him, you'll find that he has some
handgun bullets. Further down the hall, you'll come across a pool of
blood. Beware of the creature that drops down. Simply aim low and
shoot until it doesn't move anymore. Pick up the green herbs to heal
yourself now or later.
Enter the door at the end of the hall. Go down the hall and into the
double doors to the right. To your immediate left on a desk you will
find the Operation Report file. Exit the room and head down the hall
to yet another door. Beware - on the other side of this door is a mess
of zombies. Go to the top of the stairs and head down the hallway
until you reach a statue with a red jewel in its hand. Push the
smaller gray statue over the square on the floor to the left of the
big statue. Push the reddish statue over the square spot on the right
side of the statue. The red jewel will be released and is yours for
the taking. Head through the door to the right of the statue and down
the hallway.Enter the first door to find the S.T.A.R.S. office. On 
Chris's desk
you will find his diary, and beneath that you'll find the Unicorn
Medal. Get the grenade launcher out of the locker and exit the
room. When you try to exit, a fax will come in, which you should
grab. Take the Unicorn Medal to the main hall of the police station
where you first entered, and place it in the front of the
fountain. This will release the spade key. Go back through the door
from which you came and down the hall, and unlock the door to the file
room. There, you'll find the Patrol Report, ink ribbon, and a
crank. To get the crank, push the step stool to the cabinet, climb up,
and get it.Exit the room and head up to the second floor. Go down the 
hall past
the statues and enter the door. Inside, you'll find a little girl in
trouble. Shoot the zombie and talk to Chris. Down the hallway behind
him, you'll find a box of handgun bullets. Down the hall to the right
you'll find a box of flame rounds in the desk. Enter the library to
the left. Head up the stairs to the right and down the walkway, where
you'll fall through the floor. There, look at the picture clue and
push the red button. Approach the face of the leftmost bookshelf, push
the red switch, and move it to the right. Go to the next bookshelf to
the right and move it to the right as well. This will trigger the
picture to move and reveal the serpent stone. Take the stone and exit
the double doors. Then make your way to the other side of the balcony,
past the zombies, and through the door on the far side.
Enter the room and pick up the lighter, ink ribbon, and the Chief
Secretary's Diary A. Return to the first floor via the emergency
ladder and head for the briefing room. Inside, go to the small room in
the back with the fireplace. Use the lighter to light the fire and
burn the painting. This will reveal the second red jewel. Take it and
go back to the second-floor save-point room where you got the
lighter. Then, exit through the opposite door and head down the
hallway. Exit through the door straight ahead. Once outside, go down
the stairs and enter the door. In the hallway, enter the open doorway
on the left.Enter the small room with the open door to the right. Inside 
you'll
find green herbs behind the desk and a safe in front. To open the
safe, use the combo 2236. Inside you will find acid rounds and the
police station map.. Exit the double doors at the far end of
room. Make your way to the burning helicopter outside the police
station. Go down the stairs and enter the door around the corner for a
save point, shells, and a valve handle. With valve handle in hand,
return to the burning helicopter, go behind the open fence next to the
door, and use the valve handle on the water-pressure valve. Water will
quench the flames, and in the smoke you'll find handgun bullets. Head
back to the hallway inside the house where the helicopter was
protruding in. Now, with the flames out, you can enter the door on the
right. Once inside the room you'll find the diamond key, along with
two stone busts protruding out of the wall. Place a red jewel in each
one of the busts. This will reveal part of the blue stone. Take the
stone and head back to the first floor.
Use the diamond key to enter the evidence room on the first floor to
the right of the main staircase. Dispatch of the zombies quickly, and
search for the film and plastic explosive. Exit through the other door
into the room where the officer gave you the key card at the
beginning. This time he won't be so nice. On the desk in the room
where you find him will be the detonator. If you look around the main
room you'll come across some handgun bullets in the locker and a memo
to Leon on the desk.
When you're done poking around, head to the interrogation room that
you can open with the diamond key. Once inside you will find the eagle
stone and cord. Make your way out of the room quickly....
Now go back to the room where you got the memo to Leon. From that
room, go down the short hallway to the door you need the heart key
for. Use it and discard. Now head for the stairs. Look out for the
dogs, take your first right, and run to the first door on your right.
Inside, pick up the green herbs and police B1 map, then head for the
reserve power control panel. There, press up, down, up, down, up. This
will activate the key card lock door. Now head back out and take a
left, pass the first door on your right, and enter the door to the
left. Go down the corridor and enter the door on your left. Here you
can save your progress or get some things out of the storage
chest. Once you exit the room you will run into Sherry. After a brief
talk you'll play as Sherry. Head to the elevator and go up. Beware of
the dogs! You want to take the first right and head straight for the
door. Once inside the room, look to the right - hanging on the wall is
the sewage-disposal map. Grab it, hop down to the left of the control
panel, and push the boxes in place so they make a bridge. Once the
boxes are in place, hop back up to the water-level control switch and
push the button. The water will raise the boxes and you can walk
across and get the club key.
You can head back to the elevator or to the door on the right where
some grenade rounds are waiting. Once back up the elevator, Sherry
will automatically give Claire the items, and you will once again
control Claire. Go back up the manhole ladder and through a set of
doors. Then, use the club key on the autopsy room to the left. Inside,
in the far left of the room in a cabinet, you'll discover the red key
card. Watch out! The moment you pick up the red key card, all of the
zombies in the room spring to life.
Next, go down the hallway to the key-card door and use the key card to
enter. There are two boxes of handgun ammunition, an equipment bag,
and a submachine gun.
Now, head all the way back to the top of the stairs. Follow the
railing to the door immediately to your right, and use the club key to
open it. Inside, you'll find the night watchman's diary and acid
rounds. Now go into the only room on the first-floor map you haven't
been in: the middle room on the upper right side. Use the club key to
enter and discard. Ignite the furnace on the far side of the room
using the lighter. Then turn the faucets on the wall in this order 12,
13, and 11. This will make the golden cogwheel fall out of the
painting. Take it and head to the third floor via the library on the
second floor.
Once there, enter the only other door on the third floor and use the
crank in the square hole in the wall to lower a staircase. Head
upstairs and use the golden cogwheel on the gears, then press the
button to open the door to the right. Behind the door you'll find the
other piece to the blue stone. Combine both pieces to make the 
jaguarstone.
Take all three stones to the chief's office, after saving. Go behind
his desk and press the button beneath the painting. This will cause
the painting to move. Place the three stones in the three slots
provided. This will open a door. Head through it, pick up the mail to
the chief, and then go down the elevator.
Talk to the chief, pick up the rounds, and go down the ladder. Battle
the horrible monster and, once victorious, go back and get
Sherry. Then head to where you fought the monster, and push the button
to lower the ladder.
Head into the sewers with Sherry. She will fall into a floodgate, and
once again you will be forced to play as her. Simply forge ahead,
enter the first room, and exit it through an air vent. Evade some
bats, and pick up a silver coin at the end. After Sherry helplessly
falls, you become Claire once again. Now go further down the sewer and
through the first door, picking up green herbs before entering. This
large room contains a save point, a storage bin, and a memo. If you go
down the ladder first, you'll discover acid rounds and first-aid
spray, as well as a zombie. Or you can just go down the elevator
platform. Once down, grab the map on wall, head into the water, and
search for the flame rounds in the cubbyhole near one end. Then go in
the other direction, take a left, go through the door, and evade or
destroy the spiders. Go into the door to the left of the waterfall.
You'll encounter Annette, Sherry's mother. After a brief discussion,
you'll go your separate ways. Use the valve handle on the
bridge-lowering mechanism. Once across and on the other side, use it
again to raise the bridge back up (trust me). Head down the corridor
until the alligator attacks, then run back until you get to the red
light on the left. Push the button to release the gas canister. Let
the alligator take the canister into his mouth, then shoot it! Head
down to the door in the direction the alligator came from. Open the
doors, and collect the coin and Sherry. Head up the ladder, go left,
and get the golden coin and sewer managerss' memo. Veer right and use
the valve handle on the lighted machine to the left of the spinning
fan. This will allow you to climb up the ladder and through theairshaft.
Once down on the other side, look for the waterfall, and drop both of
the coins into the water-flow control panel. This will stop the flow
of water and allow you access to the door behind. Make your way to the
right side of the trolley and turn on the power switch on the control
panel to activate the trolley. Enter it and take it for a ride. Once
on the other side, exit and use the lighter on the flare signal
(located to the immediate right) to make the weapon-box key gleam in
the light. Pick up the key and head for the door. Go down the walkway
until you reach some zombies and the first intersection. Go to the
left and search the dead guy to find the almighty spark gun.
Head to the right and go through the door. Inside, you'll encounter
some more zombies. To the right, there are two green herbs and to the
left a ladder that leads to the room. It contains a save point, a
storage box, first-aid spray, flame rounds, and grenade rounds. Once
all of the items have been collected, head out the door. Go into the
tractor housing sitting on the platform. Inside, you'll find more ammo
and the key to activate the platform. Take the key out to the control
  panel in front of the tractor housing, use it, and then press the
button to activate. Once inside, William, the creature (you can't miss
him), will attack. Exit the tractor and get ready for battle! The
spark gun works very well against him. Once he's down, head back
inside the tractor housing.
After Sherry gives her speech, head to the west area and go into the
only door accessible. There, find the memo, go to the computer, and
activate the anti-B.O.W. program. Get the other memo on the sofa and
the shells in the locker. Head to the east area and into the
frozen-door room. Get the fuse case off the cart and use at table to
have it put together by the mechanical arm. Take the fuse to the
junction in between the east and west area, and use it. Now the door
in the west area can be opened, but beware of the fierce plant
creatures waiting behind the door. Once they've been dealt with, head
through the door and destroy one more. Then head down the ladder by
the big plant. Enter the door and find the map beneath all of the
monitors. Go through the door and use the weapon-box key to get the
grenade rounds.
Enter the automatic door and pick up the red key card after battling
the zombies. When you exit the room Annette will confront you. After
she's attacked, get the serum instructions from her. Use the red key
card to enter the door by the eggs. Kill the big moth, and then use
the handgun to clear off the creatures on the computer. Enter the
password "guest." Head up to the west area and use flame rounds to
kill the plant in the air shaft, then climb into the air shaft and
grab the ink ribbon and two cases of grenade rounds in the
locker. Enter the east area and use the key card on the door, pick up
the serum canister, shoot the zombies, and turn on the lights. You
will find the MO disk in the corner. Go to the computer and use the
serum canister, then hit the switch on the machine to the right,
return to the computer terminal, and retrieve the processed
serum. Head back down the ladder by the plant, enter the large P4 door
where you picked up the key card, go to the machine on the left, and
use the serum canister. The machine will process it. Then head to the
door that requires the MO disk. Go inside and get ready for the final
battle with William. After defeating him, run for the train. Enjoy 
theride!
The End... for now.
