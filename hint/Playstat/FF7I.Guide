FF7 Materia List v 1.0

This is a list of all the Materia in FF7 and their respective functions. 
The next version of the FAQ will have a list of all the Teki no Waza in 
addition to some other minor updates.  If you find any mistakes here 
please let me know at ikelley@mail.sas.upenn.edu.


COMBINATION MATERIA

NOTE: Combination Materia needs to be paired with another type of 
Materia to work. It alters, adds status, or otherwise reacts with the 
materia it is paired with and affects its powers. To pair Combination 
materia, you need to put them in the two connected slots in the 
weapon/armor you have it in.

Fuiuchi (Surprise Attack)
Whenever a battle starts, before anybody makes a move, this 
Materia makes it so whatever Materia it's paired with will 
automatically activate. For example, if you pair it with the Fire 
materia, you will automatically cast a fire spell on the enemies as 
soon as the battle starts. The higher you build this materia, the 
better the chance that you will excecute the surprise attack.

Zentaika (Affect Everybody)
This materia will allow any magic Materia it is paired with to be cast 
on more than one person. For example, If you pair it with Healing 
materia, you can heal all your characters rather than just one when 
you cast healing spells. The higher you build this materia, the more 
times you can cast spells on multiple targets in a single fight.

Mahou Counter (Magic Counter)
When paired with a magic or summoning Materia, this Materia will 
have the character equipping it cast the spell whenever he/she is 
attacked. If you pair this with Master Mahou or Master Shoukan, it 
will pick a spell/summon at random to counter with.  The higher you 
build this materia, the more often the character using it will counter 
when attacked.  I

MP Kyuushuu (MP absorb)
Whenever you do damage with the Materia paired with MP 
Kyuushuu, you will absorb 1/100 of the damage done in MP to the 
character equipping it.

HP Kyuushuu (HP absorb)
Whenever you do damage with the Materia paired with HP 
Kyuushuu, you will absorb 1/10 of the damage done in HP to the 
character equipping it.

Zokusei (Attribute)
When paired with a magic or Shoukan Materia, it will add that 
Materia's magic type to the weapon or armor it is equipped in. For 
example: If this Materia is paired with the Fire spell Materia in a 
weapon, the weapon will make fire attacks. If this Materia is paired 
with the Alexander summoning spell in a piece of armor, then the 
character wearing it will be stronger against Holy-type attacks. As 
this Materia advances, the defense it provides in an armor changes: 
Level 1, it cuts damage in half, Level 2, it makes the damage type 
totally ineffective, and Level 3, it absorbs the damage type.  Note: 
pairing this with a summoning spell that does multiple types of 
damage will not work!

Tsuikagiri (Additional limit, literally...tough to translate)
Whenever a character uses the Materia combined with this, he/she 
will do a physical attack, too. Don't pair this with a healing materia, 
as you will end up attacking the person you are trying to heal.

Command Counter
This works similar to the Mahou Counter Materia, except that it 
counters with the command it is paired with. It won't work with 
command materia that changes the Attack command though. If you 
pair this with Master Command, it will pick a command at random to 
counter with. The higher you build this materia, the better a chance 
that you will do the counter when attacked.

Mahou Midariuchi (Random Magic Strike, lit.)
When this is paired with a magic spell, it will cast the spell four 
times at random enemies, although the power will be weaker for 
each attack. It works with summon spells too, but you need the MP 
to cast it 4 times.

Tsuika Kouka (Additional Effect)
When paired with certain magics in weapons and armor, it adds the 
properties of that magic to the piece of equipment. For example, if 
you pair "Fuujiru" with this materia in a weapon, it will put the 
monsters to sleep and silence them. Pair the same magic in an armor, 
and you become immune to sleep and silence spells.

Tsuide ni Nusumu (Steal in addition)
When paired with a command, this Materia will make you steal from 
the enemy targeted at the same time. Therefore, pairing it with 
"Steal" doesn't have much purpose.

MP Turbo
This Materia allows you to put more MP into a single spell, making it 
much more powerful. It works for summoning spells too. The more 
powerful you make this materia, the more powerful the magic it is 
paired with will become (and the more MP it will take to use it.)

Final Attack
This Materia will automatically use the Materia it is paired with 
when the character equipping it dies. In addition to making a final 
attack on the enemies, there are also other useful ways to use this 
materia: pair it with the ressurect-spell materia, and the character 
will automatically revive him/herself when they die. The higher you 
build this materia, the more times you can use it in a single battle.

There are a total of 24 techniques you can learn from the enemy. In 
order to learn the techniques, you must have it used on the character 
equipping the Materia. In addition, you have to win the battle you 
learn it in; if you learn a technique and then run away from the 
battle it won't count.

INDEPENDANT MATERIA

NOTE: Independant Materia works by itself to have effects on your 
character or your party, and do not affect your commands at all 
(with one exception)

HP UP
This Materia increases the character who is equipping it's maximum 
HP by a set percentage. The higher you power the materia, the 
higher your HP is boosted.

MP UP
Like HP up, except it increases your maximum MP by a set 
percentage instead. The higher you power the materia, the higher 
your MP is boosted.

Magical
This Materia will increase the magic power of the character who is 
equipping it by a set percentage. The higher you power the Materia, 
the larger a percentage your magic power is boosted.

Lucky
This Materia increases the luck of the character equipping it. The 
higher you build the materia, the greater a percentage your luck is 
boosted.

Speed
This Materia boosts the speed of the character equipping it by a set 
percentage. The higher you build the materia, the higher that 
percentage will be.

Gil Up
When you equip this materia, the Gil that your party finds after 
battle will be increased by a set amount. On Level 1 this materia 
increases the money you find by 1.5.  On Level 2, this materia will 
double the amount of money you will find.

Keikenchi Up (Experience points up)
This materia increases the amount of experience that the character 
equipping it receives. On level 1, your experience will be multiplied 
by 1.5, and on level 2, the experience the character equipping 
receives is doubled.

HPMP Irikae (HP/MP Swap)
This materia swaps amount of HP and MP for the character 
equipping it. You can use this to boost your maximum MP to levels 
over 1000, but in return you will have a maximum HP of 999 at 
most.

Teki Yoke (Enemy Dodge)
This Materia will reduce the amount of enemy attacks on the party. 
At Level 1, enemies will attack only half as much as usual.  At Level 
2, this materia makes it so the number of enemy encounters is 1/4 
as much as normal

Teki Yose (Enemy Collect)
This materia increases the amount of enemy attacks on the party.  At 
level 1, enemy attacks will be 1.5 times normal, and when this 
materia is at Level 2, enemies will attack you twice as often as 
normal.

Chocobo Yose (Chocobo Collect)
This Materia makes it so that Chocobos can attack you. Chocobos can 
be gathered on places on the overworld with Chocobo prints. The 
higher you power this materia, the more likely you are to meet 
Chocobos: 2x, 4x, and 8x, for levels 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

Sensei Kougeki (Advance Attack)
This Materia increases the chance that you will surprise your 
enemies when you meet them. The higher you power this materia, 
the greater the chance you will get a chance to strike first when you 
fight monsters. At its highest level, 48% of the time you will get an 
advance attack.

Enkyori Kougeki (Long Range Attack)
Any character equipping this Materia will be able to fight in the back 
ranks of the party without suffering any penalty to the amount of 
physical damage they can do.

Any character equipping this Materia will be able to cover any allies 
that are being attacked. The higher you power this Materia, the 
greater the chance that you will cover your allies when they are 
attacked. At max, there will be a 100% chance that you will cover 
your allies.

Counter
The character equipping this Materia will automatically 
counterattack their enemies if they are attacked.  The higher you 
build this Materia, the better a chance that you will counterattack 
when attacked. At maximum, you will always counterattack when 
attacked.

"Zentaika" except that it affects every other piece of Materia the
