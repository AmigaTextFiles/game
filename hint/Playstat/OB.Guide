 Now for the walkthrough...

 You are on level B-4F of a scientific research facility. You have awoken 
 from your cryogenic sleep and are freezing. You have until the blue bar 
 at the top right corner of the screen turns completely red to find a way 
 to keep from freezing to death.
1.   Go to the auxiliary power generator in the center of the room(between 
     cryo-pods #3 and 4). Kneel in front of it and inspect it. This will 
     turn the generator on, and the heat will rise to 0 degrees(you are 
     still freezing though). 
2.   Inspect the door with the round object attached to it(not one of the
     two main doors). Your character will push it forward.
3.   Enter the room beyond this door and open the case on the floor(you must
     kneel) in the back right corner. You will find a recording chip inside
     it. Take the recording chip(you use this to save your game). 
4.   Go to the back left corner of the room and open the case on the floor
     there. You will find a vest and a computer chip in this case. As soon
     as you take the vest it automaticaly equips(your character puts it on).
     Equipping the vest stops your character from freezing to death. Take
     the computer chip also.
5.   Go to the front corner of the room where the machinelike object is. 
     Use the computer chip here. The chip is actually the Artificial 
     intelligence chip of a robot, putting it in the robot body will 
     reactivate it.
6.   Go back to the room with the cryogenic sleep chambers. Change characters
     so that you are now controlling the robot. Have the robot interface 
     with the computer between cryo-pod #'s 1 and 2. This will unlock one 
     of the two main doors to this room and give you information about your 
     cryo-sleep.
7.   Inspect the door in front of Cryo-pod # 2, it is now open. You will now
     enter the hallway on the other side of that door.
8.   Using the robot, go to the broken section of the hallway and inspect 
     the wreckage, you will find a security card. After finding the card,
     inspecting the wreckage with the male character will allow you to crawl
     over it and onto the raised section of the hall above. The robot will
     hop up and follow you. Proceed through the door at the end of the hall.
9.   You have now entered the glass bridge over the computer control center,
     proceed to the door at the other end of the bridge and enter it.
10.  You are now in a "T" shaped hallway. There are doors up the hallway
     to the right, left and center, in addition to the one you entered from.
     Go through the center door, straight up the hall from you.
11.  You are now in a small hallway, go through the door at the end of it.
12.  Now you have entered the elevator room of level B-04. Use the terminal
     between the two round doors. This will cause the door to the right to
     open and a dead mutated man to fall out, landing face down on the floor.
     Kneel down next to the creature and inspect him. You will find a slip
     of paper with some numbers written on it. Go back to the "T" shaped 
     hallway.
13.  Upon exiting the small hall after the elevator room take a left(facing
     the door you just came out) and continue through the door at the end. 
14.  You are in a short curved hallway, continue to the end of this hallway.
     At the end of this hall inspect the door and you will find a numbered 
     keypad lock. Enter the # 61891 then press the large orange button on 
     the keypad. This is the bottom # on the paper that you got off the dead
     creature in the elevator room. Go through the now unlocked door. 
15.  You are now in the main hallway to level B-04. There is a giant hole in
     the floor at the end of the hall opposite to you. Enter the door to the
     side of the keypad lock door you came in.
16.  You have entered the storage lab. Push the boxes so that you can reach 
     the back left hand corner of the room. Change characters so that you 
     are controlling the robot when you get there. You will find a box with
     a broken glass faceplate hanging from the wall behind a small box. 
     There are wires showing through the broken glass. Using the robot, 
     inspect the wires. This will cause the robot to reconnect the power, 
     which was shut off. Change characters so you are using the man and go 
     to the green cabinet, just to the right of the power box you just
     repaired. Look for the card slot on the left hand side of it and use 
     your security card in it. This will open the cabinet's front and allow
     you to get the laser knife(you must inspect the open cabinet). Exit 
     back into the main hallway. 
17.  Proceed straight down the main hallway from the storage labratory. Go
     through the door at the far end, to the right of the hole.
18.  You are in the lounge on level B-4F. Stand in front of the floating 
     statue that's just inside the door, and push it over. This is done by 
     the push command. After the statue has fallen, kneel in front of the
     stand it was on and inspect it(the stand). You will find a green chip
     looking object, it is an anti-gravity device. Exit the lounge.
19.  Go to the large hole in the floor of the main hallway, and stand on 
     the edge(not too close). Use the anti-gravity device you took from the
     statue. This will cause the man to be able to jump the distance of the
     hole and land safely on the other side. The robot however must stay 
     behind at this point. Go through the door on the other side of the hole.
20.  You are now in the computer control center. Go to the terminals to the 
     right of the door(facing), and inspect them until you are shown a cinema
     in which it gives you the sequence in which to position switches to 
     activate a door(up, down, up). Now go to the terminals to the left of
     the door and inspect them until you find the switches to activate the
     lighting, doors and air conditioning. Push the switches until you align
     them in this way, lighting-off, doors-on, air conditioning-off. Each
     time you enter a wrong choice you must re-inspect the terminal to make
     another selection. Doing this correctly will unlock the door across
     from the keypad lock door and another door you haven't come to yet, in
     the stairway. Now go to the back of the control center and inspect the 
     computer bank there, you will be given information about a malfunction 
     in the main generator, and that you need to do something to turn the 
     generator back on properly. Leave the control center and use the 
     anti-gravity device to jump back over the hole in the floor to rejoin 
     your robot companion. Proceed to the now unlocked door across from the
     keypad lock door and enter it. 
21.  You are now in a long hallway. Halfway down the hall you will come to
     a grate in the wall, there is a humming sound coming from within. Kneel
     and use the laser knife in front of the grate. This will let you cut it
     open. Change characters so that you are controlling the robot and enter
     open grate. Proceed to the back of the shaft and interface with the 
     generator that is there. Exit the shaft. Switch control back to the 
     male character. 
22.  Exit the hall through the door you came into it from, and go back 
     through the keypad lock door into the curved hallway. Proceed out of 
     the curved hall from the door at the other end into the "T" shaped 
     hallway. Once in the "T" shaped hallway, walk staight from where you 
     just entered from and go out through the door you come to. 
23.  You are now in a hall with a red emergency light flashing. Continue 
     down this hall, turn the corner and exit through the door at the other
     end.
24.  You are now in the stairway. Go to the edge of the ledge to the left
     of where you entered(facing away), you will come to a broken section of
     railing at the end. Stand at the edge of this broken section and use 
     the anti-gravity device once again. You will jump from the ledge to the
     girder to the ledge opposite where you are. The robot will hop across 
     after you. Enter the door you are now at(this is the other door that 
     was unlocked by the switches in the computer control center). Continue
     down the short hallway that follows until you come to a heavy rising
     door.
25.  Inspect the door and it will rise a bit and then fall back down. Use
     the anti-gravity device in front of the door, this will attach it to
     the underside of the door, allowing it to rise halfway. Kneel and 
     crawl forward under the door. When you get directly under the door the 
     anti-gravity device gives out and the door falls down on you. You 
     catch the door with your arms and back, but it is very heavy and you
     are pinned. At this point the blue health bar returns and you are given
     control of the robot. You must find a way to raise the door before the 
     blue health meter runs out and the man is crushed. 
26.  Directly to the left(facing) of the door are 3 levers on the wall,
     have the robot inspect them. You can now position each of the 3 levers
     in an up or down position. Pull levers #1 and #3, so that they are 
     in this sequence: (1)down (2)up (3)down. This is the same sequence
     from the computer control center. This will raise the door enough for
     the man to get out from under the door before it crashes back down.
27.  You are now on a walkway above a large drop, there is an open section
     of railing leading to a wide girder. Walk onto the girder and start 
     towards the other end of it. Halfway across the girder the robot 
     becomes frightened and runs to the end of it. As the man is asking him
     what's wrong, the whole complex begins to shake violently. Soon the 
     girder starts to break off in sections. Your blue health meter returns
     and you have to run to the end of the girder before the sections that
     are breaking off catch up to you and you fall. When you reach the 
     platform at the end of the girder, look at the back right side and you
     will see a large white pipe not too much lower than the platform. 
     Walk off the platform above this pipe and you will drop down onto it.
     Proceed down the pipe towards the dark opening, and enter it. 
28.  You are now on the pipe heading towards the main generator. As soon
     as you come out of the tunnel into the generator room you notice the 
     controls for the generator. Jump down onto the section of the generator
     to your right, from there hop across the gaps in the sections until you
     come to the section underneath the controls. Walk to the back edge of 
     this section(careful you can fall off the back too) and jump up. Your
     character will pull himself up onto the small catwalk with the 
     controls. Inspect the controls to turn the generator on. Doing this 
     causes the sections of the generator to rotate. Jump back down onto
     the sections and proceed to the right(facing the center of the room).
     Hop across the sections until you come to where the robot is on a 
     catwalk above you. Jump up there to rejoin the robot. Exit through the
     door at the back of the catwalk.
29.  You are now in a dark carpeted hallway, go through it to the door at 
     the other end and exit. This takes you back to the hall where you cut
     the grate open. Go through this hall and the next few halls to return
     to the elevator room. 
30.  When you get to the elevator room a cinema will run, showing your male
     character noticing some kind of infection on his arm, and connecting it
     to the mutated creature on the floor. They then get in the elevator and
     proceed to level B-3F.
31.  When the elevator stops you are in the B-3F elevator room. Exit through
     the door in front of you.
32.  You are now in a long hallway with a door at the other end. There is a
     control box on the wall to your right. Change characters so that you are
     controlling the robot and have him interface with the control box. This
     will raise the door at the end of the hallway. As soon as the door
     raises the control is switched to the man. Have the man walk through the
     door, the control then switches back to the robot as the door reshuts.
     Have the robot press the control box again, this will raise the door 
     again. Afterthe door raises the second time the control switches once
     again to the man, switch quickly to the robot and run through the slowly
     closing door. 
33.  You are now in another "T" shaped hallway. There are doors up the hall
     to the right and left. Go through the door up the hall to the right.
34.  You are now in an "S" shaped hall, there are dead bodies on the floor.
     A cinema of you finding the bodies is shown. There is a valve on the 
     wall near the first body, ignore it for now. Towards the end of the 
     cinema you hear a woman scream, you are then given back control of 
     your characters. Proceed to the other end of the hall. Towards the 
     3rd body a mutated creature will jump down from the ceiling and attack
     you. The fight between your characters and the creature plays out in a
     cinema. The man is knocked backwards down the hall and your robot jumps
     at the creature, grabbing it by the neck. The creature proves too strong
     for the little robot and he is smashed against a wall. The man gets back
     to his feet and pulls out the laser knife, stabbing the creature in the
     chest. The creature screams and falls backwards dead. The man then goes
     to help the robot, but it is too late, he is dying. With a few long 
     blinks, the light in his eye goes out. The man then takes the memory 
     chip out of the robot's body(the one you used to activate him). You 
     are then given back control. When you inspect the door at the end of
     the hallway you find that it is locked. Go back out of this hall by the
     door you came in and proceed to the door down the "T" shaped hall in 
     front of you. Go through this door.
35.  You are now in the chemical storage area. There is an open air vent on
     the wall to your right(ignore everything else here for now). Stand 
     under the vent and jump, this will cause your character to climb into
     the air vent. Proceed through the air vent to the other end of it. There
     are twists and turns, but no breakoffs in the passage. At one point you
     will have to jump down a hole into a lower section of the vent in order
     to proceed. Remember to crouch again after doing this or you won't be 
     able to fit into the shaft below. Before the final turn in the shaft 
     you will hear a woman scream again. Turn the final corner and proceed 
     to the light at the end of the shaft, this will cause you to jump into
     the room below. 
36.  When you land in the room, you will see another mutated creature is
     terrorizing a woman. The blue health bar now reappears and you must
     fight, hand to hand with the creature. After you defeat the creature,
     kneel and inspect the woman. This will cause her to regain consiousness.
     She has a sample tube that will now be added to your inventory. Look
     on the shelf next to the fire extinguisher(on the floor) to find a 
     silver key. Go to the back of the room and look on the desk to find a
     detonator device. Exit the room by the door(it unlocks when you inspect
     it). Proceed back through the "S" and "T" shaped hallways to re-enter
     the chemical storage area. 
37.  When you are back in the chemical storage area, have both characters
     stand on the lift. It will then lower them to the bottom section of
     this room. Go to the back left hand side of this section and use the
     silver key on the grey box ontop of the other two grey boxes. It will
     unlock and open. Take the chemical explosives that are inside (red 
     tube). Now, kneel in front of the crate with the brown tarp covering
     it(just to the left of the boxes with the explosives) and inspect it.
     You will find a can of oil there. Next, kneel in front of the crate 
     with the white tarp covering it(behind the large glass container), and
     inspect that. You will find a first aid spray. After that, walk to the
     device to the right of the lift and inspect it. This will cause the 
     lift to rise. Go to the hydraulics that are now exposed under the lift
     and use the oil on them. This will make the lift ride smoother(so as
     not to jostle the chemical explosives... That would be bad :). Go back
     to the lift control device and lower the lift. Move both your characters
     onto the lift and ride back to the upper section of the room, then 
     exit through the door on the wall with the air vent.  
38.  You are now in the underground subway. Jump down onto the empty tracks
     on one side of the platform and proceed down them towards the crashed 
     subway car. There will be a hole in the wall above the ledge to your
     right. Place the detonator device on the ground under this hole. Now
     place the chemical explosives into the detonator. At this point your 
     blue health meter makes another appearance and you now have 9 seconds
     to get back up onto the platform at the begining of the tracks before
     the blast occurs(press inspect at the platform to jump up onto it).
     After the explosion, go back down to where the blast occured and 
     inspect the hole you created, this will allow you to jump up onto the
     divider between the two sections of track. Jump down onto the tracks
     on the other side. You are now in front of the parked subway car that
     was at the platform. Walk down the tracks away from the car. When you
     reach a certain point in the tracks, the cars brakes let go and the car
     comes rushing towards you. At this point(very quickly) hit the inspect
     button to make your characters dive onto the tracks so that the car 
     passes over them and crashes into the wall at the far end of the tracks.
     The back door of the car opens upon impact. Have your characters enter
     the car by this door. There is a box on the right hand wall of the car,
     inspect it to find a gun and the red security card. Exit the car through
     the front and climb onto the platform that is there. Enter the door that
     is on this platform.
39.  You are now in the computer room for the air vents. If the man uses the
     computer here, you will see a map of these three things, Central
     ventilation, Freight transportation and the Chemical storage area. Use
     the red security card on the door opposite the one you entered this 
     room from to unlock it, then exit through it.
40.  You are now in a "Y" shaped hallway. Proceed to the door to the left
     (the one to the right is locked) and enter it. 
41.  You are now in a room with a grated floor, large banks of lights to one
     side and a large window to the other. Attempt to open the door at the 
     back of the room. This will trigger a cinema in which your characters
     decide to split up to see what's in the room on the other side of the 
     window. After the cinema you regain control of your characters, but
     the woman no longer follows the man automatically. 
42.  Using just the man, leave this room and go back to the air vent in the
     computer room. Stand under it and jump, this will let him crawl into the
     vent. Crawl to the blocked passage to the left(after the passage splits)
     and inspect the door blocking your way. This will cause the door right
     before where the shaft splits to close, you are now trapped in the air
     vent. Switch control to the woman and have her go to the computer room.
     Have her use the computer, this will bring up the maps of the vents. 
     You will now have the ability to open the closed doors inside the air 
     vents. Use the D-pad to choose a door to try and press "O" to open. It
     will randomly open a door or more. Try different doors until you have
     opened the 3 lowest doors on the ventilation map(all but the one that
     closed when you inspected the first door in the shaft). Press "X" to 
     exit the computer and switch control back to the man. Continue down the
     now open shaft until you come to a bright light, this is the end of the
     shaft. Go towards the light and he will jump into the room below the 
     vent's exit. (*Note: if you come to a jet of steam that you cannot pass
     proceed to step 42B, otherwise, continue to step 43.)
42B. This happened because you turned the red valve in the "S" shaped hallway
     where the robot died. You need to switch control to the woman and then
     use the computer again, it will alert you that there is trouble in the
     vent. Go back to the "S" shaped hall and turn the valve again, this will
     shut the jet of steam off. Switch control back to the man, you should 
     now be able to proceed as noted above.
43.  You are now in a room with 2 giant fans, one blowing towards you from 
     the front of the room and the other sucking you backwards from the rear
     of the room. Immediatly kneel and crawl forward to the front of the 
     room. Kneeling puts you under the air current. Go to the control panel
     in front of the giant blowing fan, and inspect it. This will turn the 
     2 fans in this room off and also one other fan in the floor of a room
     between 2 sections of air vents to the right when the shaft split. Go
     back to the ladder that you jumped down when you entered the room and
     inspect it, you will climb back up into the air vents. Go back through
     the air vents until you reach the other exit(you will have to stand
     and jump up at one point to proceed to a higher section of the vents).
     There will be a giant fan in the floor here, you shut it off when you 
     shut down the others,walk over it and inspect the vent on the other 
     side of it to proceed down the shaft. Jump down out of the vent and 
     into the room below.
44.  You are now in the research lab. Kneel in front of the red tank and 
     you will find a first aid spray. Use the DNA sample from your inventory
     in the sample device on the end of the desk in front of the large 
     window. You will learn about the DNA stran they are developing and a 
     long cinema will follow in which your characters are attacked by another
     mutated creature. The man breaks the window and jumps through to help
     the woman defend herself from the creature. The man is hurt in the fight
     and the woman drags him through the back door of the room with the large
     bank of lights after the computer unlocks the door. 
45.  That door leads to an atrium filled with trees. After the cinema is
     complete, the man regains conciousness. Push the red button on the light
     colored steel panel(says warning in the top corner). This will drain
     the small pool of water in the center of hte atrium. Inspect the 
     machinery on the wall to the left of the doorway(facing). You will find
     a clip of bullets. Climb down the ladder in the hole in the now empty
     pool. 
46.  You are now in a hallway, knee high filled with water. Walk to the 
     opposite end of hte hall and kneel and inspect the broken grate there.
     You will crawl under it into the next room.
47.  You are in a room with a broken water pipe. Go to the valve behind the
     outpouring of water and attampt to turn it. You will find out that it
     is stuck. Use your oil can on the valve. After using the oil try and 
     turn the valve again, this time it will turn, raising the door in the 
     rear of the room. Go through the door.
48.  Now your in a long hallway that bends at a corner. After the bend,
     halfway to the end of the hall you hear a rumbling. All of a sudden a 
     giant object rushes towards your characters. As soon as you regain 
     control of your characters, jump, this will cause your characters to
     grab onto an open grate above them and pull themselves up out of harms
     way.
49.  They pull themselves up into a short hallway. As you approach the door
     out of this hall, another mutated creature jumps from the ceiling. As
     the man you must fight the creature. After defeating the creature, go
     through the door and exit this hall.
50.  You have now entered the elevator room for this level. Use the elevator
     controls, this will start a cinema of your characters entering the
     elevator. Then another cinema shows what happens to them on their ride
     to level B-2F.
51.  Exit the elevator room(you are now on level B-2F), and you will now be
     in an intersection type hallway. There are lasers going across the 
     hallway blocking your way past in that direction. The lasers can be shut
     off by going to the control box next to them and entering the number
     91861(this is the first set of #'s from the paper you got off the 
     creature from the first level). Turning around, the hall to the right of
     the elevator room door(facing) goes to an unlocked door(remember the
     sound of rushing water in this hall). 
52.  Going through this door brings you to a lounge with a computer. If you
     look out the window in this room you will see an underground cave. If 
     you kneel in front of one of the coffeetables you will find another clip
     of bullets. Exit this room through the door you came in.
53.  Go back to the door after where the lasers were and enter it.
54.  You are now on a short bridge. The bridge has been destroyed, there is
     a broken section in the middle of it. While using the man, run and jump
     over the gap in the bridge. He will start to fall, but he'll grab the 
     other edge and pull himself up. Leaving the woman to stay on the other
     side, go through the door on your side of the bridge. 
55.  You are now in the hallways of the personel quarters. A mutated creature
     will attack you here. After defeating the creature, go down the 
     righthand hallway and enter the first door(room R38-2).
56.  In this room you will find a laptop computer and view the report on it.
     In this report you learn of the cloning project going on at this 
     facility. After the report ends, kneel and grab the metal rods in the 
     middle of the floor. Next go to the grey dresser and kneel and inspect
     it to find the stun gun. Exit the room.
57.  Go into the room across the hallway, this is room R38-6. Kneel in front
     of the bed to find another clip of bullets. Exit this room.
58.  Go down the hall a bit further and enter room R38-5. Pick up the metal
     grating on the floor in the back of this room. Exit this room.
59.  Return to the broken bridge and lay the 2 metal rods across the gap. 
     Next, lay the grating on top of the metal rods. You have made a small
     bridge so the woman may now cross the gap. A cinema follows in which
     your characters go back to room R38-2 and talk about the report. Exit
     the room.
60.  Go to the kitchen(room at the end of the hall, opposite the door to the
     broken bridge), and check the strawberry dispenser on the left side of
     the room a few times. You will find a first aid spray. Exit the kitchen.
61.  Go back to room R38-5 and jump down the hole in the back of the room,
     behind where you found the grating. 
62.  You are now in a dark set of tunnels. Through exploring these tunnels,
     you find that there are 2 open grates in the ceilings(other than the 
     one you jumped down), one sealed vent on a wall and a broken section
     of floor with a large pipe sticking out of it. Go to the open grate in
     the ceiling directly down the tunnel from where you entered. Stand 
     directly underneath it and jump, this will allow you to pull yourself
     up into the room above.
63.  You are now in room R38-1. There is a steel box on a wooden shelf. Use
     the stun gun to open it, then get the lasercutter from the box. You 
     can unlock the door to this room from inside it. Go back into the 
     tunnels.
64.  Jump up the other open grate in the tunnels(not the 2 you've used).
     You will now be in room R38-7. Go through the door(not to the hallway)
     into the smaller room connected to it and inspect the laptop computer
     in the back a few times. This will allow you to get the computer CD rom.
     Exit these 2 connected rooms from the front door of room R38-7 into the
     hallway.
65.  Go back to the hallway with the elevator room door and go into the hall
     to the right(towards the lounge). You will hear rushing water from this
     hall. Kneel and inspect the grated floor, you will see that there is a 
     card underneath it. Use the lasercutter on the grated floor while still
     kneeling and you will cut a section of the floor away. 
66.  Jump down the hole , then kneel and retrieve the yellow key card. In 
     this underground cavern, there is a clip on the rock to the right of
     the water(facing). Kneel and inspect the rock to find it. Jump back up
     the hole you cut in the floor, to exit this cavern. 
67.  Start towards the hallway across from where you just cut the grating. 
     As soon as you get to the intersection, the man under your control will
     mutate into a demonic creature. A cinema follows that shows the woman
     run to the end of the hall, use the yellow key card to unlock the door
     and enter the next room. The now mutated man will follow her, but she
     uses the stun gun to render him unconscious. She then brings him into 
     medlab and heals him. At this point you will regain control of your 
     characters.
68.  Leave medlab and go into the operating room(through the automatic 
     sliding door). Look on the basin(box) to find the crowbar. Exit the 
     operating room into the hallway near the elevator. 
69.  Go back into the tunnels under the private quarters.
70.  Use the crowbar on the vent that was on the side wall of one of the
     tunnels. This will remove the vent and allow you to enter the hole.
71.  You are now on the girders that were below the broken bridge. Walk 
     forward and take your first right, continue down that girder, take 
     your next right(you have made a large "U" turn). Continue to the end
     of this girder and enter the hole in the wall at the end of it.
72.  You are now in room R38-3, enter the door on the side of this room.
73.  In this next room, push the cabinet to the left, so that it falls into
     the hole in the other doorway. Walk across the top of the cabinet(now
     level with the floor) and enter the door you can now reach.
74.  You are now in a control room. Kneel in front of the machine to the
     right of the door(facing) to find a clip of bullets. Kneel in front of
     the panel at the back right corner of the room to find a first aid
     spray. Walk up the steps to the main computer and use the CD-rom at the
     center of it. A cinema will follow. Leave the control room and go back
     to the locked door at the end of the hallway, next to room R38-5. 
75.  Inspect the door and you will now find it unlocked. Enter the door.
76.  You are now in the suit hanger. Check the suits, the one near the box
     on the wall has a clip of bullets inside it. Go through the door with 
     the round windows at the back of the room.
77.  You have now entered a cavernous tunnel. Inspect the machine in this
     tunnel and you will find a clip of bullets. Continue to the end of the
     tunnel and step into the darkness. 
78.  You are now at the skimmer launching area. Walk onto the platform near
     where you entered and inspect the water skimmer there(#03). Doing this 
     will allow you to find and remove the dead battery. Go back across to 
     the tunnel and exit this area by the door to the rear.
79.  You have entered the skimmer storage area. As soon as you enter this 
     area, you are attacked by another creature. After defeating it, check
     water skimmer # 01 by kneeling behind it and inspecting. You will find
     the live battery here. Exit by the door you entered.
80.  Go back onto the platform where skimmer # 03 is, and use the live 
     battery(lighter) on it, this will put the battery in the skimmer. You
     are then given another cinema of your characters escaping into the
     water on the skimmer.
81.  You are now riding the skimmer, and have control of it. You can move
     left or right, pushing up will allow you to go forward, while pulling
     down will slow you down and pull you back into the foreground. There
     are rocks sticking out of the water at numorous places. The object of
     this section of the game is to steer the skimmer through the rocky 
     water for a set distance. Your blue health bar appears at this point,
     and for every rock you hit, you lose a portion of the health bar. After
     you navigate the rocks for a while, you get a cinema of your characters
     crash landing the skimmer. 
82.  You are now at the skimmer landing pad. Exit through the door to the 
     next room.
83.  You are now on a walkway above some giant cables. As soon as you enter
     this walkway, you are attacked by another creature. After defeating
     him, continue down the hallway and round the corner to get to the 
     elevator door. Inspect the door. This will trigger a cinema in which 
     the creature you fought when you entered the walkway, comes back and 
     grabs the woman. As you're about to help her, the elevator door opens 
     behind you and you are clubbed into unconsiousness. When you come to,
     you are alone. Enter the elevator and ride up to level B-1F. As you 
     ride the elevator, you are given another cinema in which the woman is 
     restrained and seems to be being examined. 
84.  When you arrive at level B-1F, proceed down the hall in front of you
     to the door in the dome shaped section(you may have to kneel to enter
     the door area the first time you come to it). Enter the door.
85.  You are now in a large cryogenic chamber. Proceed to the exit at the 
     other side of this room and enter it.
86.  You have come to another hallway. Enter the door to the left side.
87.  You have entered the briefing room from the cinemas. Inspect the man
     hunched over at the the left hand wall twice and you will find a clip
     of bullets. There is also a first aid spray under the table. Inspect the
     man lying dead on the floor to get the ID passcard(the picture on it
     looks like you). Go back out into the hallway.
88.  Go to the door at the end of the hallway. Show the red robots guarding
     the door the ID passcard that you took off the dead man in the breifing
     room, they will move and let you pass. Enter the door there.
89.  You have now entered the room the woman is being held in. You confront
     the man responsible, and in a cinema you learn of the fact that you are
     a clone. The scientist then mutates and you take control of your male
     character to fight him(don't forget to equip the gun). After defeating
     the scientist, inspect the computer in the back of the room. After 
     inspecting the computer, use the robot's memory chip from your inventory
     on it. Doing this will let the robot infiltrate the system and destroy
     the facility. He will also unlock the door to the right so you can 
     exit. A timer will start to count down, letting you know how long until
     the blast that will destroy the facility. Exit through the door the
     robot unlocked for you.
90.  You are now in a freight elevator going up. An old friend shows up to
     shake up your ride. At the top you exit the elevator.
91.  You are now in the hanger bay. There is an aircraft there. Go to the 
     left side of the aircrafts cockpit and inspect it. At this point the 
     mutated scientist makes another appearance. You must fight him once 
     again, but after defeating him this time he will get back to his feet 
     and come at you again. Lure him to the rear of the aircraft, the 
     woman has gotten into the cockpit and wants you to lead him there. 
     When you get him behind the aircraft, the woman turns on the engine
     and the mutated scientist is engulfed in flames from the aircrafts 
     exhaust where he is killed.
92.  Your characters escape in the aircraft, and you see the facility 
     explode from the sky.
