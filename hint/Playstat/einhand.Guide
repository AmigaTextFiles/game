2. SP Bonuses
  Each stage has 3 SP Bonuses to earn...they all require you to perform a
certain task to earn and get you some easy points. Earning all 3 Bonuses on a stage allows you to stage  select that stage in Free Play mode. We aren't sure of any other significance
yet. Anyway's if you're missing some of them here they are. 
Stage 1
Sp Bonus 1-Shoot all the neon signs (helps to turn your speed up)
Sp Bonus 2-completly destroy all weapon carriers on the stage till after the
neon signs, the first weapon carrier to appear near the bottom right of the screen, after
the neon signs is the second Sp Bonus enemy
Sp Bonus 3-Destory only the bottom saucer section of the blue police robot
midboss.
Stage 2
Sp Bonus 1-You need to quickly destroy the weapon carriers that appear on the
ground at the very beginning of the stage until a red Weapon carrier appears. Kill it for Sp
Bonus 1.
Sp Bonus 2+3-at two points in the stage, there are gun pods rising out of the
train and the screen will not advance until you destroy the command tower on the far right.  Do not destroy the tower and instead continue to kill the gun pods after killing about 6 of the gun pods you will earn the Bonus.
Stage 3
Sp Bonus 1-Kill all the spinning top weapon carriers until a red one appears.
Sp Bonus 2-During second part of midboss destroy 4 or more of the red reflector trucks.
Sp Bonus 3-Destroy the Saucer at the top f the screen after the midboss and
then destroy EVERY dead enemy that falls from it. Helps to use Juno or Vulcan (or both :P)
Stage 4
Sp Bonus 1-When the large boat pops out of the water destroy only the body
section. The control tower will fly of and fire a lot of bullets, kill it before it leaves
for the Bonus.
Sp Bonus 2-After fighting the midboss, you need to navigate through the
tunnels, taking the downward most path, at the elevator go straight. you will come to an incline with a robot you usually don't see sliding down the hill. completely destroy him for the Bonus.
Sp Bonus 3-After exiting the tunnel/elevator section (background turns blue)
there will be some piping on the ground destroy it with a downward angled weapon for the bonus. (note: if you got the first 2 bonuses there will be an enemy flying above the pipes. Just wing him and he will fall into the pipes and destroy them for you!)
Stage 5
Sp Bonus 1-Destroy all the girders that move up and down before the midboss.
Sp Bonus 2-Destroy parts off the midboss without killing him until you earn
the Bonus.
Sp Bonus 3-Near the end of the stage you can see three enemies take off from a
building. One of the is red. If you have wasp, gun the button and waste 'em. If not you have to kill all the enemies that come out after the red enemy fly's by the foreground to make him appear on screen.
Stage 6
Sp Bonus 1+2-After destroying the first booster rocket 3 missile pods start to
pop out. they have 3 attacks, missiles, mines, and enemy release. Sp Bonus 1 is earned by
killing a red enemy release RANDOMLY by the pods. Sp Bonus 2 is earned by destroying 3 of the pods. Note that these two Bonuses can be earned in either order and sometimes twice for more points.
Sp Bonus 3-On the stage boss you need to destroy the little cap that pops out
the top, the center most piece visible when it does the yellow laser attack, and then the
main saucer section. The boss will crash and jettison a tiny Jellyfish looking guy with
really spiffy lighting effects. Kill 'em for the Bonus.
Stage 7
Sp Bonus 1,2,+3-kill all 3 red enemies...helps to use wasp a lot.


3. Secret Weapons.
The secret weapons require a little more work than usual to earn and are
easily missed... here they are.
Juno-A really powerful version of the Vulcan.
Stage 1-at the boss (if you of all 3 Sp Bonuses) destroy the y shaped part on
top. Then the boss will start to attack in sidescrolling view. sometimes a pod will pop out
of his back.  Sometimes its the Juno.
Stage 4-Earning Sp Bonus 1 will get you Juno as well.
Stage 7-We've seen Juno appear here once.
Flash-A really powerful version of the cannon, kills almost everything in one
or two shots
Stage 3-Sp Bonus 3 rewards you a Flash.
Stage 5-Sp Bonus 2 rewards you a Flash.
Mosquito-A guided missile that is very strong. Moving the controller around
steers the missiles
Stage 4-On the path to Sp Bonus 2, aquire a rear firing weapon (spread works
great here).  Right after going down the first 2 levels there will be an enemy and a set of
barrels behind you. The barrels have the mosquito inside.
Python-Strong mines that are linked by lasers. A weird weapon to get used to.
Stage 5-destroy the Jawa Transport looking thing in the background with Wasp
near the first part of the stage to earn the python.


4. Extra Ships
To Earn the Sodom. Beat the Game on Easy without using continues....the Sodom
ship is the little police car enemy that you see in the beginning of the game. you can
power up the weapon 20 times...it makes it a different game almost.
To Earn the Silene. Beat the Game on Hard....without continuing( I think continuing once will work too)....The Silene Ship holds two weapons and holds 9999 rounds for each weapon every time you grab a weapon. Put two Flash weapons on it and watch your score go through the roof.


5. Miscellaneous
The Blade weapon can stretch further if you do fireballs. Try doing a fireball then switching the Blade from top to bottom. It will swipe the whole screen!
Gallery Pictures
	Gallery pictures are earned by difficulty and grade. you need to get lots of
A's on your stats to get all the pictures (we think) Work on Sp Bonuses, x16 Combos (easy with Silene), top scores and not dying or continuing at all. So far we've got up to 79 with a few missing.
Special Gallery
    There is an option in the configuration menu called special  gallery that shows around five rendered images of the ships that  can be zoomed (not that much, anyway). I've been able to do this only with an Action Replay, so...
