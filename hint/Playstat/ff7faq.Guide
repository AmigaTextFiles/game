Final Fanatsy 7 Character, Storyline, and level 
descriptions.(All that are presentl known that is).

Storyline:  
	Shin-Ra, a corporation that has taken over the 
worlds governments and total power supply.  The company 
is rapidly taking over the entire world and using it to 
serve its needs.  Cloud, a former Shin-Ra mercanary met 
Bullet the leader of Avalanche and one of the only 
people he was withstanding resitance from the ruthless 
power of Shin-Ra, at a bar and was offered a  large 
amount of money to help his cause.  Then Aerith runs in 
to Cloud be chance and then takes a major role in there 
quest to stop Shin-Ra.  

Characters:
	Cloud(Gaio in Japan):  This 21 year-old spiked haired 
hero is battling to save his planet from Shin-Ra, a 
company that controls the worlds governments and power 
supply.  As once a member of the Shin-Ra elite army, 
Cloud now is just a wandering mercanarie.  He is now 
under the employ of Avanlanche, an anti-Shin-Ra 
terrorist group.  After accepting a main job with 
Avalanche, he leaps in to battle to determine the very 
fate of his planet.  Cloud weilds the longest sword in 
video gaming history and uses it in many different ways 
to make his rivals suffer.  
	Bullet(formerly known as Barret):  This monster
(he is really a human)is the 35 year-old leader of 
Avalanche.  He was married until his wife was killed in 
an accident several years ago.  He is currently living 
with a woman named Marin while plotting his resistance 
to Shin-Ra.  Bullet’s right arm just happened to be a 
chain gun which he uses to sacrifice animals, humans and 
any other being that tries to stop his mission.
	Aerith:  Aerith is 22 years-old and has a very 
mysterious past.  She currently runs Midgar’s flower 
shop.  But after meeting Cloud in a chance encounter, 
she ends up playing a major role helping him and Bullet 
resist the wrath of Shin-Ra.  Rumors are spreading that 
she and Cloud may be in love with each other.  Aerith 
has a long, metal cepter in which she uses to whack 
opponents senseless.
	Red XIII :  Little is known(in real life) about 
Red XIII.  He is actually a member of Avalanche!  Red is
a ferocious wolf/lion creature that uses sharp claws to 
shred opposers of the Avalanche campaign.  Despite his 
beastly appearence, Red is actually very intelligent.  
His intelligence level exceeds that of a human by a long
way.  
	Cid:  Cid’s back for some for Final Fantasy 
action.  Although he is much younger (only 32)than Cids 
in the previous Final Fantasy quests, he still shares 
the same atributes of his past selves.  Cid is still 
kind-hearted, has a high knowledge of mechanics and 
exploratory excitement.  Cid carries a long metal spear 
in which he uses to inflict massive amounts of pain in 
opponents.
	Tifa:  Tifa is the youngest of the Avalanche 
members(20 years-old), but is equally as dangerous.  
Tifa is brave and good to the communities, but behind 
the cute face lays the spirit of a fighter.  She fights 
with only her bare fists and still manages to mash 
opponents.  Tifa was a childhood friend of Clouds and 
although she acts otherwise, is believed to have 
feelings for him

Levels(World):
	The Machine Tower:  
		This level includes over a dozen floors 
to explore and houses the reators used to power the 
world.  This structure is one of the most prized by 
Shin-Ra and plays a critical part in the story.
	The Church:
		The Church is a giant cathedral that has
many stairs to climb and objects to find.  Cloud will 
need to search this place inside out to find a crucial 
piece in the puzzle of stopping Shin-Ra.
	The Farm:  
		Odd.  A farm in the middle of a world of
towers, slums, and giant cannons.  The Farm is complete 
with a couch, milking stool and a fridge full of fresh 
dairy products.  This stage is small and takes only a 
little amount of time to explore.
	Junon:
		Little is known about this level.  In 
fact, pretty much nothing is known about it.  It has a 
giant(gotta see it to believe it)gun pointing out in to 
the sea that sits on the top of it.  There is also a 
banner on the front of this huge vessel that clearly 
states "Rufus".
	The Slums:
		These are fairly high quality slums<g>. 
They have electricity, phones and TV.  There are also 
some cool ruins there to mess around in and explore.
  
	*Note*When exploring, you will see only Cloud, 
but in the heat of the battle you will be able to use 
numerous characters.

Thanks for reading me paper.  I will continue to make
