                             WALKTHRU V 1.1


                          
This as a walkthrough for Discworld 2.. it's pretty much a bare bones
walkthrough; if you want a more explanatory guide, you should try
Psygnosis' Discworld 2 Hint Book, which should be out shortly. Unless
told otherwise, all objects in this game should be put straight into
the luggage. Should you have any further problems, queries, etc, you
can e-mail me on C.S.McMullen@cms.salford.ac.uk. Or check out the
Discworld Game Faq, and the Discworld Web Page, which I spookily also
write... http://www.lspace.org/games/discworld is a good place to start.

And also, feel free to propagate this, stick it on web sites, etc,
just as long as you let me know where you've put it. If there are any
magazines that want to publish all or part of this, consult me first.
