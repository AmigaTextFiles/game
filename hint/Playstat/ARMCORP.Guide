TRANSLATOR'S NOTES:  This is a literal translation of the user's manual
that comes with Armored Core, and it is intended to help owners of this
wonder game who cannot understand Japanese.  Since it is a literal 
translation, nearly all of the original Japanese grammatical structures 
is kept intact, leaving some of the translated sentences sounding awkward.
In the FAQ, the notes for positions of picture panels refers to the 
pictures that you see in the pages of the manual. 

     I will attempt to update this FAQ with additional translated 
information directly from the game itself (such as mission contents).  
Any suggestions to the form and content of this FAQ are welcome:  
I can be contacted at the E-mail address listed above.  I hope
this translation will help you understand and enjoy the game more.  HJ

A SHORT GUIDE TO ABBREVIATIONS:  CB = Circle Button, TB = Triangle

ARMORED CORE

STORY

Mankind disappeared from earth's surface on account of the last 
international war, known as " The Great Destruction".  The few who 
survived the disaster abandoned life on the devastated surface and 
moved their dwellings underground.  Built at various locations and 
designed to support a growing population, the underground cities became 
the only places left for mankind.  When that began, man lost his 
earthly paradise because of his own fault.

Half a century later.  Mankind again welcomed prosperity.  People
lost the concept of "nations" and came to be guided and controlled by
"corporations".  The principle of free enterprise generated severe
 corporate competition and swiftly made the world recover, and the 
strains that accompanied that increased as well.  Differences between
rich and poor, the raging of terrorism, racial discrimination...  The 
"walls" mankind had built still would not be extinguished.  The 
"corporations" that became rulers sought more power and 
money, and conflicts would not die out.

A world in which corporations hold all power.
With one exception.

Mercenary soldiers that execute requests for a fee whiling maintaining 
neutrality They are called "Ravens".


Organization Data

* CHROME -  A conglomerate with its headquarter in Isaac City.  
It is the top- class corporation in the world.  The conglomerate does 
not hesitate in publicly declaring its aim to further strengthen  
its monopoly on city administrative system, and few would publicly
 recite objections because of its powerful influences.  
It has a cooperate relationship with the first-class  "Chemicaldyne",
 the pharmaceutical research/development division.

* MURAKUMO MILLENIUM-   A large corporation which focuses on heavy 
industries.  Its armored core-related products is especially publicly
acknowledged, and its technical strength is said to surpass even 
that of Chrome's.  It is one of the few corporations that clearly opposes
Chrome's plot of more and more monopolized control.  Because of that,
armed clashes around Isaac City is becoming frequent.
 
* GUARD-  Police organizations that every corporate entity possesses.
It is responsible for maintaining the public peace and order in the 
territory which the respective corporation controls.  The class of
armament varies somewhat depending on the parent corporation, and the
guards are a bit pressed against the terrorist organizations that
has gained prominent strengths in recent years.

* RAVEN'S NEST-  An organization of mercenary soldiers who carry out 
ill sorts of legal and illegal missions in exchange for rewards.  It 
is entirely unconcerned with the content of the mission request or the
requester, and its managers and the particulars of its organization are
completely unknown.

* RAVEN-  The men who are posted in the nest.  For men enrolled in 
the nest as a Raven, arrangements for requests and the purchase/sale of 
Armored Core parts are conducted through personal computer networks.
Although Ravens are posted in the nest, the nest does not impose any 
restrictions on them.

* MUSCLE TRACER (MT)/ ARMORED CORE (AC)-  Accompanying mankind's move to 
the underground, the corporations' pressing need was the development
of high efficiency, high fidelity industrial machines.  Robot 
technology rapidly developed and arrived in one extreme.  Known as 
Muscle Tracers (MT), the robot technology promptly penetrated 
corporations.  MT technology steadily progressed and accomplished even 
greater developments because of the establishment of a standard known 
as the "Core Plan".  This plan involved a standardized system of 
manufacturing  in which the various body parts are attached to the 
core (the chest portion), and this allowed the core to be used in 
various circumstance. Places where MT's were used increased more 
and more, and there are military types, of course.

Competing corporations possess Core MT (CMT) and upgrade them with 
armaments.  People call a MT that is armored and modified 
occasionally for specific 
environment an Armored Core (AC).

(upper panel)  Except for the opening mission, the screen with income and
expenditure results is displayed when the mission ends, no matter if 
the mission is a success or a failure.  The repairs on damaged sections
of the AC and ammunition used during the mission are necessary expenses

EXPLANATION OF PARTS
The parts that form an AC are classified into 10 types.

 FCS are equipped in the core.  Missile ambush attack capability is
 also equipped here.

2.  HEAD-  Special capabilities such as bio-sensors and radar load 
are hidden inside.

3.  ARMS-  There are 2 types of weapon arms- the ones that are weapons 
themselves and the average arms that can be equipped with guns or laser
 blades.

4.  LEGS-  There are 4 varieties:  two legs, reversed joints, 
four-legged hover, and catapillar type.  Decision on this part depend 
on weight and mobility requirement.

5.  GENERATOR-  It influences the AC's energy gauge and thus the 
assembly of parts.

6.  BOOSTERS-  It influences the dash and aerial flight.  The bigger
 the output, the higher the speed capability.

7.  BACK WEAPON R/L-  Aside from heavy weapons such as missile and 
rockets, it includes the auxiliary equipment such as radar.

8.  ARM WEAPONS R- It includes rifle-style guns that threatens with
 single fires and the machine gun-style weapon that threatens with
 unlimited, continuous fire capability.

9.  ARM WEAPON L-  It is the laser blade that is advantageous in close
