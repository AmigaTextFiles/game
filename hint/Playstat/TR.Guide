 Jumping Strategies.
 -------------------
 Tomb Raider is based on square blocks, jumps are either 1,2 or 3 blocks apart. 
 This is how to jump them. X denotes Laras position.

 1 Block apart.
 ==============
  +-------+       +-------+  
  |       |       |       |  WALK to the edge and do a Standing Jump.

 ==============
                  +-------+  
                  |       |  Use the WALK button to position Lara corner
                  |       |  of the block nearest the platform you jumping 
                  |       |  to. Use LOOK to line Lara up and then tap back
                  +-------+  Run forward and press Jump before Lara reaches 
                             edge.

                                    |       | Quite tricky this. The trick
                                    |       | use the LOOK button to line  
                                    |       | up with the opposite block 
  +-------+                         +-------+ a RJG. Line Lara up so that

  |       | ----->  ----->  ----->            possible.
  |       |   1       2       3               A jump like this can be found 
  +-------+                                   the Sanctuary Of The Scion.

 Things to remember.

 1. Lara can move slightly to the left or right whilst jumping.
 2. If you hold down the Jump button while jumping, Lara will land take a step 
   and then jump again. This can be done to jump 3 1 block spaced platforms.
 ================================================================================
 Monster Strategies.
 -------------------
 Bats       - Easy, aim, fire.
 Wolves     - Mostly attack in packs. Either run around shooting OR backflip 
              and sideflip whilst shooting.
 Bear       - Quite fast. Shoot from high up or use Wolf strategy.
 Red Raptor - Fast and vicious but can be seen from miles away giving plenty of 
              time to shoot. Also stops to roar at you.
 T. Rex     - Fast, big and eats you whole. Run away and find a safe place to 
              shoot it from.
 Lion       - Slow but very lethal. Hunt in prides so can surround you like 
              Wolves. Find a safe place to shoot from or a large area.
 Crocodile  - Can be either on land or in water(but not both). Suprisingly slow 
              in the water and so easily avoided, suprisingly fast on land. 
              Takes few shots so can be taken one to one. BEWARE, sometimes they 
              play dead and Lara doesn't lock onto them.
 Gorilla    - Can jump up ledges so you can't hide(except on high ledges). 
              Shows off, leaving plenty of time to shoot it. Shoot with Shotgun.
 Rats       - Irritating. Fast and nibble alot. Sometimes attacks in groups of 
              3-4. Use Shotgun or Pistols from high up, or close and dirty with 
              Uzi(only available after completing game):)
 Panther    - Fast and very lethal. Rarely attacks in groups. Find high ground to
             shoot from. If you go one on one then use shotgun.
 Mummy Horus- NASTY!, fast and lethal. Fires fireballs which take alot of 
              energy. Either find a large area and use the Wolf strategy or 
              find higher ground than usual to fire from. Explodes when killed, 
              which takes energy.
 Horseman   - Slow but fires alot of fireballs. Rarely attacks head on so you can
              sideflip from side to side avoiding the fireballs whilst shooting.
              Explodes.
 Demon Bat  - Usually attacks by coming directly down at you. Wait for Lara to 
             aim high and then back off firing. Try to hide in corridors as they
             rarely follow. Explodes.
 
 The monsters found in Atlantis onwards are variations of the monsters 
 found in the Egyptian levels so use the same strategies.

 To kill the Men that shoot at Lara either just stand and fire and heal 
 when low OR find a safe place to shoot them. They will leave after they 
 have been shot a few times, don't chase them as you cannot kill them 
 before the Natlas Mine level(except Pierre, who you can kill in the Tomb
 Of Tihocan, and Larson at the end of the Qualopec/Sanctuary of the Scion 
 levels). 

 If Lara locks onto an enemy and it hides behind a pillar, Lara will 
 continue to lock onto the enemy even though it can't be shot at(but Lara
 doesn't fire). This is a good way to kill things if they are hiding and
 appear now and again. For this to happen you must hold down the fire 
 button and Lara will fire when she can see the enemy.

 The many deaths of Lara Croft.

 Tips for finding secrets.
 -------------------------
1. Look for oddly coloured patterns that don't fit in with others.
2. Look for Pressure Plates(usually grey). These usually open doors somewhere 
   else which you have to find(see above).
3. Listen for sounds. Sometimes it's a piece of music or a door opening sound.
4. Retrace your steps and try to take a different path.
5. Remember what has happened in a level(water lowered, etc) and try to think 
   how it would effect other parts. 
6. Look in dark areas or behind statues.
7. Use moveable blocks to get to higher areas(even push through doors), even see
   how far you can push them around in a level.
8. Look for dead ends or places that seem WEIRD.
================================================================================
                       TOMB RAIDER - LEVEL BY LEVEL GUIDE
================================================================================
The first 2 levels are easy and therefor don't need a guide. If you're stuck on 
Level 2, remember you can push things(use action button on the grey block in 
the room Lara gets trapped in), and either RTFM :) or buy the original >( 
================================================================================
Level 3 - Lost Valley. 5/5 secrets found.
----------------------
The Shotgun is located near the Cog Mechanism, which is near the source of the 
river.

The way forward is to go through the gap opposite the waterfall and climb up the
rocks directly ahead(use look button to find the ledge). The other way is a 
dead end. 

To kill the Tyrannosaurus Rex, find an entrance in the cliffs and shoot from 
safety. To do it in style run to the place where the 2nd Cog is located(on the 
broken bridge) and shoot it at leisure.

You now need 3 cogs. Here is where they are situated:

1st Cog - Go into the Temple entrance(at the end of the valley). Dive down to 
          the bottom of the waterfall, on the righthand side.
2nd Cog - Climb up to the entrance located to the left of the temple entrance. 
          Do a RJG to get to the other side of the broken bridge.
3rd Cog - Find the waterfall which has water at the base. Swim underneath and 
          then climb up to the highest platform.

Secret 1 - Find climbable rocks located to the right of the temple entrance. 
           Climb to the highest point and then jump onto the temple entrance 
           roof. To get down slide down the slopes on the lefthand side of the 
           temple roof.
Secret 2 - By the 3rd Cog waterfall, in the corner of the rocks.
Secret 3 - By the 3rd Cog, instead of swimming underneath the waterfall find 
           the climbable rocks on the lefthand side. Climb up and then shimmy 
           across the crack, you will be at the top of the waterfall.
Secret 4 - By the Cog Mechanism. Drop off the lefthand side of the bridge and 
           shimmy across the crack to the rivers source.
Secret 5 - Use the 3 cogs on the Mechanism and swim to the end of the redirected
           water. Don't forget to collect the Shotgun.

The entrance to the Tomb is behind the Waterfall at the beginning.
================================================================================
Level 4 - Tomb Of Qualopec. 3/3
---------------------------
Easy, just operate the switches and make the jumps. The switch next to the 
collapsing platform(in the middle room past the first save point) cannot be 
switched(it's a trap but you must go down). 

To make the jump back over the collapsed platform(right of first save point), 
stand at the edge and do a SJG.

Look out for the boulder trap located straight ahead as you enter/exit the main 
Tomb entrance.

Secret 1 - After switching all the switches and opening all the 3 doors head 
           over to the area where there are poison darts. Sideflip over the 
           darts until you get to the steps. On the left side climb up to the 
           statue and a door will open in front of you. Run over the collapsing 
           platforms and get the item.

Secret 2 - Right underneath the 1st secret. Jump back to the doorway. This 
           next jump is TRICKY. At the entrance Walk right up to the edge and 
           then sidestep left until you are next to the wall, now sidestep right
           ONCE and turn to face the item under the platform. Still holding the 
           Walk button take 1 STEP backwards. Now do a SJ towards the object, if
           you've done it right then Lara will land JUST after the spikes. To 
           get out Walk(DON'T run) through the spikes and jump to the exit.  

Secret 3 - As you come out of the waterfall entrance dive down and swim to the 
           small tunnel on the right.

AMAZING!, Lara walks on air(bug).SATURN Version
-----------------------------------------------
After getting both secrets go back to the room with the 2 tall moving 
blocks(left of the first save point) and go through the doorway next to the 
switch. Carry on over the blocks and Lara will walk on air!!. You see the 
collision detection has been reset but the graphics haven't. Crazy!. 

As you come out of the Waterfall entrance you will be shot at, if you carry on 
and climb over the rocks as if you were going to the Lost Valley you will find 
another MediKit. This isn't a secret.

You must shoot Larson.
================================================================================
Level 5 - St Francis Folly. 4/4
---------------------------
To open the doors either side of the big room push the block onto the Ankh 
switches.

To reach the opposite door to the Gorilla Door push block to the far end(as 
you come in when you start) of the hole it's in and SJG to the right hand 
pillar.

Secret 1 - Door above block and switches. To reach the higher ledge position 
           Lara with her feet next to the bottom of the sloped block on her
           immediate left as she walks through the door. Jump onto the slope and
           she will backflip onto another sloped block, she will now jump 
           forwards towards the ledge, hold down the Action button to grab hold.
           Watch out for the weak platform at the top.

Secret 2 - When you have opened the second locked door carefully walk around 
           the corner and slide down the slope. Just before you reach the 
           bottom jump so that Lara hits her head and falls onto the sloped 
           platform, wait for Lara to reach the bottom of the slope and JG to 
           the opposite door.

Secret 3 - Instead of operating the switch to drain the water(right after 
           Secret 2), fall into the water and find the other room in the 
           ceiling.

Secret 4 - Behind the door at the very bottom of the Gods Hall, in the dark 
           corner. It's quite hard to get to but once you know how to do it, 
           it's easy. This is how...
           Above one of the God doors(Atlas) is a pressure pad. This opens the 
           door at the very bottom of the Gods Hall. Make your way to this 
           pad, step on it and then turn left and walk to the end of the 
           platform. Look down to look at the door open, keep looking until it 
           closes(it's very small and to see it you have to see it close).  
           Turn right around and run over the pad and keep on running forward 
           to the edge ahead. Just as you get to the edge use the roll button 
           so that Lara rolls and faces the other way just before the edge. 
           Lara will flip over and fall. Use the Action button to grab the edge 
           as you are falling and then let go as soon as she's grabbed the 
           edge, this will lessen the damage when you fall. As soon as you 
           land flip over and run forward, do the same movement(roll before 
           edge, grab, fall) on the next edge. You will now be directly 
           facing the secret door(albeit on a higher level). Run forwards and 
           then run over the edge ahead, it's a long fall which takes energy 
           but it's the only way. You will now be right in front of the door, 
           if you did everything quickly then the door will be open long enough 
           for you to get through.
            
The next part has Lara climbing down a tall room(Gods Hall), don't walk off any 
platforms without looking first, it's a long drop to the bottom!.

Occassionally Bats will attack Lara, hold down the Walk button to prevent her 
from walking of a ledge whilst shooting them. Flick all the switches on the way 
down and they will open the doors to 4 sections. These are:

Damocles - As soon as you collect the key the Swords will be activated. Either 
           walk slowly through the columns(walk one step, STOP, and repeat). 
           or run and heal quickly any damage, be careful though as 1 sword can 
           take 3/4 of your health if it hits you perfectly. Don't forget to 
           collect the items above the Damocles Key and the Medikit located 
           above the Damocles doorway.

Thor     - Run straight through the electricity. Stand on the switch until you 
           hear a click, and then MOVE. Push the blocks to reach the high door.

If you do these 2 first then Pierre will appear and try to shoot you. make your 
way to the bottom again to shoot him.

Atlas    - After killing the Gorilla walk through the gate. If you walk close to
           the boulder it will roll towards you. Quickly flip over and run the 
           opposite way, as you see the edge coming towards you flip just 
           before it(so that you fall over the edge facing the other way) and 
           hold the action button. Lara should now be hanging and the boulder 
           will roll over the top of you. 

Neptune  - Dive down and operate the switch, you cannot return to the surface 
           without doing this. After operating the switch return to the 
           surface for more air, and then collect the key from the end of the 
           underwater corridor.

Put all the keys in the locks at the bottom of the main room. 
================================================================================
Level 6 - Colosseum. 3/3
--------------------
To get into the Main Colosseum, go to the back of the Entrance Building on the 
left side and then climb up the 2 balconies.

Secret 1 - Instead of going through the entrance to the Crocodile Pit jump over 
           to the right of it(to the left of the water). The jumping is very 
           tricky and one wrong jump will send you right back to the beginning.

Shimmy across the crack above the Crocodiles to get past.

Secret 2 - Climb up in the middle of the crack above the Crocodile Pit.

Lions Den Puzzle - Timing is the key to this. The plate at the back opens the 
                   2 gates. As soon as you walk over this RUN to the left gate 
                   and quickly pull the switch, turn around and quickly run to 
                   the next room. Timing is very tight so cut every corner. If 
                   the door is closing then try and jam yourself in it, it will 
                   reopen if you get caught in it.

To avoid the rolling boulder fall into the hole.

Secret 3 - In the room where there are lots of pillars where you have to get 
           to the top to operate a switch(that opens the door to the area that 
           holds the key behind the moveable block). It's very tricky, this is 
           what you have to do.
           If you walk right up to one of the columns you will hear a door 
           opening. If you look up you can see it on a 2 block platform. You now
           have to jump forwards onto the smallest block, sideflip right, 
           backflip, sideflip left, jump forwards  and then run through the 
           door. It takes a bit of practise, so don't be put off. Thanks to 
           Mark Bradley for correcting me on this one.
 
The KEY to the gates is hidden behind the moveable block, near the switch which 
opened the door at the end of the Gorilla Room(the one you thought was going to 
contain the KEY:)
================================================================================
Level 7 - Palace Midas. 2/3
-----------------------
Objective is to get 3 Lead(Gold) Bars, from 3 of the 4 rooms detailed below.

Don't step on Midas's hand, it will turn you to Gold(hint).

The doors by the 5 switches can be opened by matching the symbols above the 
door to the switches. Y means ON(down) and the Ankh means OFF.

YOOOO - This room is VERY tricky. The objective is to jump across the platforms 
        and collect the Lead Bar at the end. The first 3 platforms can be made 
        easily by running and holding down the Jump button. The last platform 
        requires a RJG and this takes time to do. The flames will reignite 
        when you grab the edge, pull yourself up(you will be taking damage) 
        and QUICKLY turn right around, now backflip and you will flip over the 
        flame and not be on fire. I haven't tried sideflipping yet.  

YOOOY - Save point. This is where you must take the 3 GOLD bars to.

OOYYO - (Above this door is an item, use the pillars to get to it)
        Pull block(with purple dots) and return to the room before. The roof 
        will have collapsed making a slope. 

        An easy way to get onto the pillar in the middle is to jump onto the 
        steep slope next to the pillar and slide to the bottom of the pillar. 
        Face the pillar and backflip, you will now jump forwards towards the 
        pillar, hold down the Action button to grab onto the pillar.

        Make your way across the slope to the exit. Jump across to the T-Shaped 
        water area.

Secret 1 - Below you as you enter the T-Shaped water area.

Secret 2 - Swim down the centre of the T-shaped water area and swim under the 
           ledge. The item can be obtained by going down the right side of the 
           room. Position Lara at the bottom of the first V-shape(at the bottom 
           of the first steep block) and then jump forward twice. It takes a bit
           of practise!.

           The next lead bar is located by going down the gap between the 
           doorway and the T-shaped pool. 

After killing the 3 Gorillas in the arches(look for the Medikit) you will have 
to do a RJG to the opposite side. Look for the lowest point of the crack and 
aim for it. Look out for the weak platforms ahead.

OOYOY - Pull back the block to find the switch. Carefully check every jump you 
        make. The last jump is tricky, take 2 STEPS backwards and then do a SJG.

Find MIDAS by going to the Garden Area and find the entrance above the Sundial.

Secret 3 - ???????
================================================================================
Level 8 - The Cistern. 3/3
----------------------
1st Key - On the HIGHER platform in the corner of the main room(above the bit 
          where you have to shimmy across the crack).

2nd Key - In the room next to the Cistern(located off the Main room). Dive down 
          through the grill floor and climb up to the top of the next room.

Secret 1 - Look in the dark areas of the pool in the middle of the Main room.

Secret 2 - Climb up to the top of the Cistern room.

Magnums - In the room where you first meet Pierre(and 2 Gorillas), jump across 
the platforms until you reach the end platform. Instead of jumping for the crack
WALK to the edge and take 2 STEPS back, now do a SJ forward and you should land 
right next to the Magnums.

1st & 2nd Grey Key - Located in the rooms found by going through the entrance in
                     the pool in the Main room.

To get the 2nd Grey Key the water level MUST be low. Go through the room where 
you first met Pierre(first door on left as you first came into the main 
room), go through the level and then climb to the top of one of the tall rooms.

Use the Cistern to change the height of the water. This will help you to get to 
the room containing the Gold Key.

Lara presents... The Amazing Levitating Crocodile(and Rat) Trick!!!
-------------------------------------------------------------------
When you first start the level don't kill the 2 crocodiles in the pool. Go 
through the level as normal and find the switch that changes the water level. 
Now go back to the main room and shoot the crocodiles. Do it so that they die 
in the middle of the room, but not over the pool area as they will fall into 
the water. Now lower the water level(with the switch) and the crocodiles will 
be exactly where you killed them, ie floating high in the air!!. This can also 
be done with the Rats to really make the room look a mess!. Also, if you kill a 
Rat and it lands on stone when you lower the water level, it looks like an 
alive Rat but it doesn't move.

Use the Switch to open the gate to the 2nd Key.

Secret 3 - After going through the Gold Key door push the moveable block through
           the doorway(opened by operating the switch). Use this block to climb 
           up to the high ledge.

Exit by falling down the hole by the moveable block.
================================================================================
Level 9 - Tomb Of Tihocan. 1/? 
--------------------------
Go through the LEFT door at the top of the second tall room, timing the Swinging
Blade.

Find the way forward by pulling the switch(after shimmying across crack) and 
then falling into the water and swimming right. Look out for the Crocodile.

Gold Key - Find the switch(behind the room with the spikes) and then go through 
           the door. Jump for the crack not the door, when exiting do a SJ.

The doors in the next section are opened by pushing the moveable block over the 
floorplates. Climb onto the block after pushing it, as Gorillas and Rats are 
released.

Look out for the Double Boulder Trap in one of the rooms(look for the room with 
a MediKit near the doorway). Collect the Key.

Collect the other Key by going through the high door. Walk slowly until the 
Metal Teeth start, walk as close as you can(1 STEP away is enough) and run when 
the teeth are withdrawing(right after they've snapped shut).

Use the Keys on the 2 locks and slide down the slope(look to the right through 
the door to see an unused switch texture map).

Kill the Crocodile by climbing onto the nearest platform. Continue forward from 
this platform to find an important Switch.

To find the door opened by this Switch swim directly underneath the Main 
Entrance to the Tomb(look for the lit area).

As soon as the Main Door to the Tomb is opened a Stone Statue will come to life 
and attack you with Fireballs. Run into the Tomb to protect yourself, try and 
shoot it from inside the Tomb. If you've already completed the game then 2 
Stone Statues will attack.

Shoot Pierre to get the Scion and a Gold Key.

Secret 1 - It's at the bottom of the corridor in which you met Pierre and had to
           go through the metal teeth. It's on the right as you enter the 
           crocodile pit, in the corner.
           Don't know how to open it though:( It may have something to do with 
           running down the Metal Teeth corridor, running through the Teeth. 
           If you run from the top and not hit any walls on the way down you 
           always make it through the teeth but the door isn't open???. 

Secret 2 - ??????
================================================================================
Level 10 - City Of Khamoon. 1/?
---------------------------
Use the lower moveable block as a bridge to drag the other across.

Find Key behind Sphinx Head.

Look out for the Boulder Trap, it rolls down the slope by the Cat Statue(where 
you first meet a Crocodile).

The way forward is through the underwater corridor, in the pool by the Cat 
Statue.

Use the moveable block to reach the higher platforms. Find 2 switches.

SECRET 1 - Long fall(by the switch that operates the floor under the Cat 
           Statue). Back off and grab the ledge to lessen the fall.

Look out for the Spike Trap underneath the Cat Statue(CERTAIN DEATH!). Look for 
some steps leading down, if you step on them they turn to slopes and you slide 
into spikes. Ouch!.

SECRET 2 - ?.

SECRET 3 - ?.
           
Use the Switch to operate a Trapdoor which lets sand through a hole revealing 
the exit. Careful entering the sand room as there is now a big drop, jump off or
lower yourself down.
================================================================================
Level 11 - Obelisk Of Khamoon. 2/3
------------------------------
Quite easy this one. There are lots of surprise attacks, so tread carefully.

As you come through the doorway, by the Keyhole, there will be 2 doorways(behind
blocks) on Lara's left. The left door holds a Key and the right is a red 
herring. The doors straight ahead as you come through the door are both dead 
ends. The one on the right holds a Panther and a MediKit.

The Key opens both the door next to the Keyhole and the high doorway.

The objective of this level is to find 4 switches which operate the bridges in 
the Central room. These bridges enable you to collect 4 artifacts(Eye Of Horus, 
Scarab, Seal Of Anubis and an Ankh), these artifacts are to be taken to the 
Obelisk(reached by swimming down the long tunnel under the bridges), which is 
next to the Sphinx(seen on the previous level).

Bridge Switches
1. In the first room, climb up to the higher exit(by moving a block and climbing
   on it).
2. Find the entrance in the Bridge Room(which is next to the first room with 
   moveable blocks)that leads to a high room. Climb to the very top and the 
   switch is at the top.
3. After 2nd switch there's a hole in the ground which leads to a slide. Slide 
   down to the bottom and then flick the various switches to change the slopes 
   to steps to get to the next switch.
4. Go to the switch that switched the second slope to steps(in the Bridge Room) 
   and go to the other exit(by the bridge you haven't dropped). Explore this 
   level and the switch is at the end(got to by going round the side of the 
   room and doing lots of shimmying along edges), as well as a Save Diamond.

The best weapon to use is the Shotgun or Magnums.

A good diving position is by the bridge switch 2. For fun only.

To get to the last 2 items you have to get to the very top of the 4 bridge room 
and fall through a hole which leads to a long slide a slope.

Use switches to change the slopes to steps.

Secret 1 - At the top of the room in which there a 2 Mummies below and there's 
           a doorway leading to the switch that brings down the 4th bridge(and 
           a Save Diamond)

Secret 2 - Go through the other entrance(in the bridge room) by falling in 
           water and climbing up. Climb the high room to the very top and then 
           look for the Bridge 2 switch, right by it are 3 pillars and a 
           platform sticking. Get on this platform and do a RJG to the top of 
           the pillar in the middle of the bridge room.

Secret 3 - ???
================================================================================
Level 12 - Santuary Of The Scion. 0/1
---------------------------------
Find the 2 Ankhs and put them into the slots in the Sphinx's head.

Go high up on the Sphinxes head to get a good view of the walls each side so 
that you know where you're going.

Look out for Winged Demons whilst finding the important switches located up the 
sides of the rocks. Take care when jumping, it's a long way down.

To enter the Underwater Statues, go to the statue on the right and swim between 
the feet, and operate the switch(a lever switch right next to the door NOT the 
Gold one) which will suck you in.

Mysterious Bit.(maybe only Saturn version).
---------------
After you've pulled the lever and been sucked through the statue, come out again
onto the statues. Now jump over to the statue which had that lever and walk by 
it's ears. Walk inbetween the ears, in the middle, facing the wall. Now turn to 
Laras left and walk towards the ear until you get to the bottom of the slope. 
If you move the camera around, the graphics gliche a little revealing a MediKit 
which appears to be INSIDE the ear. You cannot pick up the MediKit normally but 
if you jump towards the ear Lara will stop mid jump and go a tiny bit further 
into the ear. If you keep pressing the Action button then Lara will retrieve it.
I was expecting the game to bug after this but it carried on as normal, there's 
no way of getting this another way, so why??.

Secret 1? - Maybe it's a difficult jump to a hidden place in the Sphinx room or 
            maybe has something to do with draining the water.

VERY long drop(Lara screams TWICE!!)
--------------
Go up the winding corridor in the left statue, collect the Scarab, but instead 
of putting it in the door go up the middle again and climb out of the Sphinx.
Now go to the middle door again and jump down. Since the jump was high anyway 
it's even higher now because the water level has been lowered. 

Leave Larson `sucking wind' and get the Scion.
================================================================================
Level 13 - Natlas Mines. 1/?
------------------------
The switch to operate the door behind the moveable block is located behind the 
waterfall.

A secret entrance is located on top of one of the cabins. Push the moveable 
block directly underneath the hole in the ceiling to be able to jump to the roof
of the cabin.

After operating the switch to move the boat, use the boat to jump over to a new 
area. Find the moveable NATLA blocks.

Find the batteries to operate the crane which lowers the cabin which contains a 
gun.

Battery 1 - On the conveyor belt. Find switch to open the door which leads to 
            the switch which turns on the conveyor belt. The switch is located 
            by the "nothin personal" boss, above the block you just pushed 
            through the door.
 
Battery 2 - By the "it ain't nothin' personal" boss. 

Battery 3 - In the boulder trap area, by the cabin with the secret entrance. 
            If you don't make it, then climb up to where the boulder came from 
            and return to the beginning.

Drag the TNT block to the next room and then operate the switch beyond to blow 
it up. revealing a new area.

Look out for the Triple Boulder Trap after the Skateboard boss. 1 comes down the
middle, the other comes down the right and the other comes from the left at the 
top.

Move the sandstone blocks to make room to push other blocks around.

Climb up the Pyramid entrance(using the not so steep platforms) to find the 
switch which operates the door to the Pyramid key.

Secret 1 - In a room where there are lots of jumps to do(over lava). There is a 
           moveable block that has to be moved QUICKLY before a boulder kills 
           you.

Secret 2 - ????
================================================================================
Level 14 - Atlantis. 1/?
--------------------
The rounds objects smash open revealing monsters in the first area. If you hear 
gurgling and see the tubes at the sides of the globes moving then if you go 
close to it something will come out.

You have to go right next to the first door(left of the middle door) for it to 
open.

Look out for the Steel Jaws Trap by the jump in the very tall room(where you 
first meet a Demon Bat). STOP as soon as you land on the other platform. 

Use the crack to find the switch which operates the door after the long jump.

To do this jump do a RJG.

Use the pushable block to block the rolling boulder that blocks the door.

Secret 1 - Just before the Trap(below), I'm not sure what you have to do, but 
           I think it's a timing puzzle linked with the second switch(by the 
           area where there are lots of jumps and Lava at the bottom). A door 
           opens just before the trap, look for a green stripe(maybe just 
           Saturn gliche). 

Boulder/Dart/Steel Jaws Trap.
----------------------------- 
Tricky this, if you run straight up the slope a boulder will crush you. The 
best way to do it is to face the slope and then sidestep right, now run up to 
the wall avoiding the darts(be careful of the first dart as it can catch you 
and take all your energy). Still facing the wall turn left so you are facing 
the side of the slope. Now hold down the Action button and climb up onto the 
the slope and quickly walk forward until you drop of the other side. The 
boulder will now roll down the slope and you'll be safe. Now just turn around 
and climb onto the slope again and go through the jaws, which are now 
deactivated.

In the Throne Room, one of the blocks can be pushed. There are switches on 
either side of a door, as soon as you operate a switch the floor underneath you 
will open. ONLY operate the left switch. The easiest way of doing this is to 
backflip IMMEDIATELY after you pull the switch and then, with your back to the 
door, walk backwards off the ledge and grab hold as you fall. When you land at 
the bottom immediately jump forward to jump over the spikes. Easy:)

Clone Puzzle.
-------------
When you come into this room you will notice a monster ahead, DO NOT SHOOT. The 
monster is a mirror image of you and will do everything you do, in mirror image.
To do the puzzle you have to find a switch that opens a trapdoor, now run to the
opposite side of the room to where the trapdoor is mirrored. On this side there 
isn't a trapdoor so you are safe. However, your clone will fall down the 
trapdoor. Remember to do it quickly as the trapdoor closes after awhile.

Later you will find a nasty timing puzzle. On one side is a switch to open the 
door and on the other is one to operate a bridge to that door. Operate the Door 
switch(right) first and then operate the Bridge switch and then RUN, because it 
is timed.
================================================================================
Level 15 - The Great Pyramid. 0/?
-----------------------------
This levels contains no nasty problems to solve but it has plenty of tricky 
jumps, timing problems and hard to get to secrets.

How to kill Monster.
--------------------
The easiest(!) way to kill this monster is to run around it. If you get the 
right angle then Lara will shoot with one hand at the monster while running.
It takes a while but I find this is the best way.

After killing the monster the way forward is to jump off the bridge(through the 
door) and negotiate the tricky timing jumps ahead.

After dying many times I've perfected the few traps after the save point(at the 
bottom of the sloped platforms). Also there is secret above the save but it is 
very hard to get to, requiring a perfectly timed JG off one of the sloped 
platforms.

Look out for the bits of lava shooting out of, um, the lava.

How to do the traps after the Save Point.
-----------------------------------------
After jumping to the next platform after the save point, edge slowly to the edge
of the collapsing platforms(careful as you can walk onto them). Face the door 
way(use the look button to aim)with the swinging blade.

Press Forward as soon as the blade is vertical with the doorway and swinging 
away from you. With a bit of luck you should make it. DON'T STOP!.

As soon as you go through the doorway run down the slope and turn right, 
ignoring the MediKit. Once the boulder has finished rolling you can jump over 
the boulder to collect the MediKit.

Stand at the very top of the next slope facing the swinging blade, use the walk 
button to get to the edge. As soon as the Swinging Blade is at it's highest 
point swinging left, press forwards. At the bottom of the slope jump over to 
safety, avoiding the boulder.

The next bit is a pain. As you go through the doorway STOP, as soon as you walk 
forwards Lava will start pouring into the room. You have to run down the centre 
and avoid it. The last 2 Lava flows are tricky because the easiest way to get 
through is down the middle but the entrance is on the right. The best way to do 
it is to jump while you are inbetween the last 2 Lava flows.

The next bit is also a bit tricky. It's a double Boulder Trap.

Run straight forward to the edge ahead and STOP right at the edge. The first 
boulder will have rolled over the top of you. The next is easy, just stand at 
the edge and do a SJG, you will jump and grab the opposite ledge, the boulder 
will then roll over you(r fingers!!).

There are a few more boulder traps but they are quite easy(except for one).

The NASTY Boulder trap!.
------------------------
 You'll know this one when you meet it!. The problem with this one is that it is 
activated very late leaving you little time to avoid it, and adding to that is 
the minimal room available. I find the best way is to walk slowly untill the 
boulder activates and then flip over and RUN for the doorway. It takes a few 
practises but you can do it with millimeters to spare.
Go up to the Scion and shoot it.

             At the end you get infinite ammo and the next time you
           play the game it gets harder(more monsters in some areas).
                    This FAQ is based on the Saturn version.
