Notes:
  - This move list is completely based on the PSX version of the 
    game; I've been told that there is an arcade version, but I 
    have never seen it in any of the arcades I go to (could be 
    because down here in Australia we don't get arcade games 
    until they are obsolete...)

@node "3" "Gameplay"
Gameplay:
  - The game combines elements of both Tekken and Virtua Fighter; 
    having the PPK combos of Virtua Fighter and the special move 
    styles of Tekken.
  - Gameplay takes place inside a ring, although the fighting itself 
    is 2 dimensional (some characters, however, have moves which 
    move them into and out of the screen).

X+Y:		Button X and button Y
running		While running (f, F obviously)

@node "5" "Common Moves"
Common moves:
f, f		Dash forward
f, F		Run
b, b		Dash backward
d, D		Low crouch (will stay for about 1 sec.)
P+K		Throw (opponent standing)
d+P+K		Throw (opponent crouching)
P+K (in air)	Land on feet if floated
u+P/K/B	(beast)	Pounce (opponent on ground)

Air attacks:
f+P/b+P 	(in air) Descending mid slam (KD)
f+K		(in air) Double foot kick & backward roll (KD)
b+K		(in air) Back double foot kick & forward roll
d+P		(just before landing) Rushing low punch (KD)
d+K		(just before landing) Sweep

While getting up:
direction	Roll in direction pressed
K		Kick-up attack

Beast mode:
  - Underneath the stamina bar is the "beast bar" (again, I have no 
    idea what the proper name of this is).  When there is a "B" at 
    the end of the bar, then by pressing the "B" button, the 
    character transforms into its beast form.  A little energy is 
    healed when this happens.
  - Any combos in the movelist with a "B" can only be used when your
    character is in beast mode (otherwise you'll turn into a beast if
    you can).
  - In the beast form, the moves do more damage, but the character is
    slightly slower.
  - Also, in this mode, it is possible to jump off the walls.

Counter-attacks:
  - Bloody Roar does not have reversals in the Tekken sense, but it
    is possible to dodge an attack and execute it almost immediately.
    This is true even if the attack is blocked; the delay time is 
    dramatically reduced and your counter-attack will come out almost 
    immediately.
  - To counter an attack, you have a fraction of a second AFTER the
    opponent's attack has taken place, to press FORWARD.  The 
    opponent's attack may or may not be blocked, as long as it 
    doesn't hit you.  If it is executed correctly, you will flash and 
    step to the side.  You can then enter into your favourite combo
    immediately.

Combos:
  - The combos are arranged with a starting combo (eg. P, P, P,)
    followed by possible combinations.  In most groups, there are 
    four combos: two combos which are mirror images of each other, 
    a normal finishing move and a beast finishing move.  The finishing 
    moves are listed at the end of the combos.
  - The finishing moves are split into two main types: 
	(i)  normal finishing moves (marked as "finishing")
	(ii) beast finishing moves (marked as "beast finishing")
    Obviously, the latter can only be performed in beast mode.  Also,
    the beast finishing moves need slightly more precise timing.
  - Under every mid chain (ie. after the starting combo), it is 
    possible to break the combo at any time and execute a finishing 
    move (or "B, beast finishing move" if in beast mode).
