                                     Introduction

Welcome to Lara's newest adventure. If you thought her first adventure was exciting,
wait until  you see what she has planned for you this time. There are 16 massive
levels and a final battle what you won't believe.


As you might expect, there are plenty of puzzles to solve and SECRET AREAS to find 
during your adventure. All of them are explained in the following text. For those of
you playing the Playstation version, you will be glad to know that you can now save 
your game whenever you want

- a much needed improvement over those Save Gems from the first game.


Finally; we aren't going to explain how to play the game or control Lara. That is what 
your manual and the excellent tutorial back at Lara's mansion is for. By the way; her
mansion is incredible in this sequel. The obstacle course (now with stopwatch timer)
has been moved outside and there is now gardens and an orchard to explore. Many new
rooms are available to explore inside the main house including her Bedroom, Kitchen,
Bathroom, and all the old favorites from the first game.
She's even added a diving platform to her swimming pool so you can practice her swan 
dive.

@node "2" "Combat Tips"


                                      Combat Tips


There are now lots more human enemies in Tomb Raider. These guys fight back and 
sometimes with some pretty impressive firepower. While it is important to save your 
more powerful weapons for the more powerful enemies, always use the best weapon to take
out a given enemy in the least amount of time. Watch out for those Rig Workers 
(the guys with wrenches) as they can climb just like Lara and follow you almost anywhere.

Save the Big Guns (M-16's and Uzi's) for the Big Bad Guys. When firing at groups of 
enemies, always make sure to release the action button after each kill so you can
acquire a new target; otherwise you will continue to pump lead into the fallen corpse.
Watch for the shadows of enemies who attack from the air.

Lara's adventure now includes many underwater areas to explore. Of course these areas 
are populated with underwater enemies. While Lara has some underwater combat ability,
it is always best to fight from dry land. Use the harpoon to slow down your enemies 
while you retreat to dry land, then break out the serious hardware. It takes time for
Lara to reload her harpoon gun,so if you are being attacked by a group of enemies it 
is often better to retreat than persist in a losing battle.

@node "3" "Hardware List"

                                     Hardware List


                                       Stopwatch

Lara has traded in her compass for a stopwatch. This allows you to check your level
completion time and find out if you've missed any secrets. It also makes it impossible
for me to use directions like N,S,E, & W in this solve.


                                        Flares
You can't do any damage with these handy items, but they will be invaluable as they 
illuminate your surrounding area, revealing traps, switches and Core's new dynamic
lighting engine.

                                        Pistols
These are Lara's trusty sidearms she brought with her from the first game. Use them 
"John Woo-style" to take out your basic baddies. They will auto-aim each time you press
the fire button.

                                        Shotgun
Another trusty weapon from the first game; use it on groups of enemies for wide spread 
damage or when at close range to inflict serious damage on a single opponent.


                                       Auto-Mags
More powerful than the pistols; these auto-firing weapons are great for long range 
targets and groups of enemies.

                                      Harpoon Gun
The reload time on this weapon makes it good for usually one a single shot. Use it to 
stall your enemy so you can swim to the safety of dry land. Ammo is also hard to find so
conserve every harpoon you find until you absolutely need it.

                                         Uzi's
Another favorite from the first game; this weapon is very powerful and should be saved
for the bigger enemies and bosses.

                                   Grenade Launcher
This weapon provides some serious destruction. Grenades will explode only after they are
armed and they must travel about 50 feet before they arm. This makes this weapons a
range weapon which is good because you don't want to get caught in your own blast.
Do not fire then run forward until after the explosion and resulting deaths.


                                         M-16
The M-16 is to Tomb Raider 2 as the Uzi's were to the original Tomb Raider. This is the
most powerful weapon you can get. It is so powerful that you will be tempted to use it 
early on, but DON'T! Save it for the final levels and the larger enemies you encounter
there. So if we are finished with all the preliminary info; let's get on with the game..

@node "4" "The Great Wall"

                                    The Great Wall

Our journey begins in a valley very near the Great Wall. Enter the water and go to the 
left of the big rock. A Tiger should appear so get on the rock and kill the Tiger then
jump forward to continue down the path. When you reach the gap, pull up, pivot,
then jump and grab and pull up.
Kill the Tiger that is approaching then jump the gap and take the path to the 

Stone Dragon which is also Secret #1.

Continue the climb by climbing up twice then pulling up to the ledge. Turn and jump to
the left and grab and pull up to get across another gap then pull up again to reach the 
building.

Enter the guardhouse and drop through the grate in the upper area to fall into the water.
Then run forward and jump and pull up to access the switch. Flip the switch and proceed
to the Great Wall.
A threesome of crows attack when you reach the top of the wall. Kill them with your guns,
taking evasive action if necessary. Proceed to the gap in the wall. The guardhouse on the
other side is locked so drop to the water below to obtain the key for the guardhouse.
Kill the Tiger who is arriving as you exit the pool. A green section of the ground will
get you high enough so you can jump and pull up to the top of the wall. Continue to the
guardhouse and open the door

Kill the spiders that swarm out the door then enter. A single spider remains to guard 
the Rusty Key above that ladder. Kill the spider and take the key and use it on the lock
next to the door. Continue forward until you reach a room with a skeleton. Shotgun shells
and a medkit are here as well as another swarm of spider plus a big spider coming in from
behind. Take out the big one first then finish off the swarm before collecting your
items. Pull out the block and slide down the slope to arrive at a pool of water.
Jump in and head left to the wall. Jump up and grab and shimmy to the right avoiding the
darts. Swim underwater to the exit and surface in the corner avoiding even more darts.
Climb up and exit into the hallway.

This hall has a collapsing floor with spikes beneath. Run across and through the door
which shuts behind you. Two boulders start rolling towards you from the left. Turn and
run to the right. As the passage narrows, jump the spikes and land on the ramp.
Slide down into the wall then jump to the left and get some ammo.
Run forward and pull up to the ledge to avoid the spiked walls closing in.

This next hall has more collapsing floors and sharp swinging blades. Run down the hall 
and jump the blades. As you approach the final blade jump and turn to the left in midair.
You should land right next to 

Secret #2; the Jade Dragon.

Pick it up and move into the hall before the spiked walls close in on you. Cross the 
collapsing floor while staying to the right. The left wall will stop before it can hurt
you.
At the end of the hall, stop at the top of the ramp and turn so you can slide down
backwards.Hang from the bottom and drop then jump to the right to land on another
collapsing floor which you fall through as more spikes close in above. Enter the cavern
and continue forward. Take the medkit then head to the left and run past the blades.
There is a rope slide and lots of spiders in this next room. Kill all of the spiders then
go get 

Secret #3 

which is located below the rope slide. To get the Gold Dragon you need
to look down into the canyon and locate the tan rock with the moss. Stand above the tan
rock and with yourback to the canyon, drop off, hang then drop. Jump and grab the ledge
and shimmy right until you can pull up. Continue along the path and collect some flares
along the way.

Take the ladder down and continue until you reach the canyon floor.
Those tremors you should now be feeling are the early warning signs of an advancing
T-Rex. Return to the hall and kill the T-Rex from the safety of the passage. When he is
dead, you can cross the canyon and get the Gold Dragon. This causes a second T-Rex to
appear so kill him then make your way back to the top of the canyon. Use the rope to
slide across the canyon and land on the ledge on the opposite side. Kill the 2 Tigers
which are waiting for you, then proceed to the exit.

@node "5" "Venice"


                                        Venice



Lara arrives in Venice and finds herself in a dead end alley. Exit to the courtyard and
take out the Doberman as he charges. You will need to do some side-jumping and shooting
to take out the guard on the balcony who will drop a key after you kill him.
Continue down the alley until you hear approaching footsteps then start firing and
backflipping back down the alley to take out more dogs and henchmen.


When all is safe, exit the alley and you will be next to the canal. Dive into the canal
and swim under the large door to get inside the boathouse. Checkout your cool new ride
then flip the switch to open a door somewhere else. Return to the dock and enter the hut.
Grab the flares from the table then start climbing the ladders.


Climb each of the ladders after pressing the appropriate switch to open the trapdoor.
When you reach the roof, shoot out the windows then drop into the hall. Climb through
the second window you just shot out and jump over to the awning. Then make another jump
to the balcony and retrieve the Boathouse Key from the dead guard you shot earlier.
Return to the hall and head right to the door you opened from the Boathouse.


Kill the attacking Doberman then continue across hall and flip the switch to open a door
high on the wall on the opposite side of the canal. Head back to the dead Doberman and
shoot out the window. Run and jump and grab the awning. Pull up and then start jumping
from awning to awning until you reach the ledge near the door. Jump inside and flip the
switch at the end to open a canal door.


Dive back into the canal and return to the Boathouse and unlock the door. Swim back out
and make your way to the ledge by the hut. Climb out and kill the henchman.
Take his Auto-Mags before you return to the Boathouse. Climb in the boat and head for the
now-open canal door. When you pass through the door, stop the boat and light a flare to
reveal a passage to the right.


Secret #1 

is waiting for you at the end of this passage. Take the Stone Dragon then jump
down and kill some rats below you. Turn and face the ladder then turn and head right.
Turn right at the end and jump in the water. Continue on past the left channel until you
reach some Uzi Ammo. Grab it, then retrace your steps back to your speedboat.


Light another flare and continue down the dark canal. At the bottom of the falls you can
dive into the pool and retrieve 

Secret #2; the Gold Dragon.


Continue on until you reach a large underground chamber with lots of columns. Keep the
boat over towards the left until you see a ledge. Hop out and kill the rat nearby then
shoot out the window and finally kill the henchmen who arrives to investigate all the
noise.Grab the ammo then get back in your boat and head through the large metal doors 
and stop.

Jump out of the boat and swim back to the dock and go through the broken window. Enter
the room and flip the switch and take the shotgun shells. Return to the dock and climb
the ladder making a mental note of the doors which are now closed. The water level and
your boat have risen to the top so dive in and flip the underwater switch to open the
next set of doors then get in your boat and continue.


Keep to your left to avoid the enemy gunfire and bring your boat to a stop by the 
gondolas. Exit the boat and get on the dock. Climb on the box then jump and grab to
reach the awning and pull yourself up. Walk to the right edge of the awning and jump to
the walkway above. A Doberman and a henchman come running at you so backflip off the
ledge and kill them both before jumping backup. Retrieve the medkit. Another guy is 
guarding another speedboat further down the canal.
You can kill him from up here then turn right and head for the courtyard.

A gun crazed baddie comes running at you so kill him with your guns, taking evasive 
action when necessary. Retrieve the Steel Key from his fallen corpse and unlock the 
courtyard door. Go through the door and drop into a hole to flip a switch. A gate opens
somewhere else in this level and you hear approaching footsteps. Climb out of the hole
and kill the henchman and take his ammo. Return to your speedboat and use it to ram the
gondolas.

Underwater mines hinder your progress. These mines can only be triggered by a boat.
Lucky for you, you have two at your disposal. Line your current boat up with the mines 
and build up some speed. Jump out of the boat at the last minute and swim to the dock 
as your boat continue down the canal and sweeps the mines for you. Grab the M-16 ammo 
from the fallen guard. The Iron Door is locked so we need to find a key. Get in your 
new speedboat and return to the section of the canal that raised your boat to this level.


A bad guy is waiting around the left corner, so hop out of the boat and kill him when 
you get on the dock. Grab all his ammo. Get back in the boat and continue along the canal
until you reach a clothesline on the right and a smaller canal on the left. Ram the two
gondolas tied up at the dock and exit your boat. A henchman with a bat come out of a
door but you can kill him before he even gets close. Enter the dark room and kill some
rats and flip the switch to open a door somewhere else in this level.
Return to your dock.

Before getting in the boat look up. There are some windows above. Jump and grab the 
ledge and pull up so you can shoot out the windows. Climb through and take 

Secret #3;

the Jade Dragon from the bed. Now you can get in the boat, turn around and take the
narrow canal you passed earlier. Keep to the left and the canal will intersect with a
larger canal and you will find the door you opened a few minutes ago with that switch.


Enter the door which shuts promptly behind you. Take the Iron Key from the pool of water
and climb the ladder to go up and kill a Doberman and his master. Take the medkit and 
flip the switch. A really nasty guard arrives on the scene and is blocking your escape
to the boat. You can either kill him by shooting through the gap between the door and 
the wall or if you want to impress your friends, try doing a backflip from the ledge
and killing him before you splash into the canal.


Either way, when he is dead, get back in the boat and retrace you path back to where you
got your second speedboat. You now have the key to open that door and kill another nasty
badguy. Flip the switch by the window to open the second gate which is blocking your
exit. Return to the boat and head back up the canal going under that walkway where you
snipered the guy who was guarding this boat earlier in the game. Keep to the left until
you reach an open door on the right. Go just past this door then back the boat up to the
door so that it is lined up with the ramp to the left.


Jump out of the boat and enter the door until you can stand. Shoot the henchman and grab
his ammo when he is dead. Flip the switch to open the final obstacle in your escape of 
this level. This is a timed sequence of events and the clock starts ticking once you get
back in your boat. Anything less than a perfect performance and you will be redoing this
segment so save your game.

Ready.....set......GO!


Accelerate your boat and jump the ramp, braking immediately when you land so you can make
the sharp turn at the second left into the large canal, then make a sharp right into the
smaller canal with the open gates. Make another right at the intersection and speed down
the canal to the exit...

@node "6" "Bartoli's Hideout"



                                   Bartoli's Hideout

Exit at the dock and kill some rats. Go around the building to the left, killing the
guard and his rats before flipping the switch. Another guard arrive so kill him too,
taking the medkits from both your victims. Enter the now open front door and kill the
guard on the balcony and his friend who appears on the ground floor. Grab the shells
from your second kill then shoot out the window and kill the Dobermans who jump through
when you get too close. Go to the back of the courtyard and take the medkit, flares and
ammo.

Now you need to proceed down the heavily guarded hallway. Several statues will begin
hacking at you with huge blades when you get too close. Keep to the right and time your
short running bursts so you pass by when their blades are in the upright position. Don't
overshoot and run into the next blade. When you get to the dark end of the passage,
light a flare to reveal a switch which opens a door back out by the canal.

Run past the guards in a single continuous run this time. They will swing but they will
be too late. Back out in the big room find the sloped wooden box. Stand with your back
to the slope then jump back and then forward and grab the ledge and pull up. Walk around
to the left and pull the block then drop down to the floor. Get below the ledge to the
left of the block you just pulled and jump and pull up. You can now turn and do a
running leap to the opposite balcony where you killed that first henchman. Take his ammo
then move to the textured wall and climb on and across to the window.

Climb out onto the ledge and turn to the right and dispatch the gunman on the balcony
across from you. Now you can turn and do a running jump off the end of the balcony over
to an awning. You'll start sliding backward so grab as you fall then shimmy to the left
and pull up and do a backflip to a ledge across the canal. Turn left and do another
running jump, grab and pull up maneuver. You should now be standing on a rather small 
ledge. Turn and do an angled jump to the awning across the canal. You can stand on this
awning so turn and face that open door and do a standing jump and press the grab while
in midair so you enter the door instead of hitting the wall above it.

A pair of Dobermans should charge you when you land so take them out before they even
get close. Make sure you don't back up or backflip out of the door into the canal or you
will be doing that last paragraph all over again. Head upstair and take out the first of
many attacking gunmen.

Enter the room where the first henchman came from and look in the left corner for a
switch hidden in the wall. Flip it to open a door in the previous room which leads to
that outside balcony where you killed that one guy. He dropped some shells and 

Secret #1;

the Stone Dragon when he died. After you collect all of this, return to the room with 
the switch and shoot out the window.

A guard patrols the landing outside this window. You can probably kill him as he passes 
or you can climb out and do the deed face-to-face. Continue down the landing and shoot
out the next window and climb in. The door opens and a guy with a bat enters along with
his dog and another guy shows up behind you on the ledge. These guys are pretty slow so
as long as you keep moving and firing you should be okay. The dog is faster to take him
out first if possible. Do a lot of flipping and use the larger room on the other side of
those doors if you need space to maneuver. You can even retreat back to the stairs if
necessary. When everyone is dead, return to the last room and push the back of the
fireplace twice to access a concealed passage.

Kill the rat after you climb up then proceed to the slope. Blades start slicing at you 
as you approach so stand back and jump out and turn to the right and drop into the water.
Climb out to the safety of the wooden ledge in the corner to survey the next deadly trap.

You need to make a quick series of jumps and the flames are on a timer. They will go out
when you jump off the ledge you are standing on, so when ready, get your back to the wall
and start running. Jump from the edge and land on the next platform. Do two STANDING
jump for the next two ledges to arrive at the other end of this trap. If you miss a
ledge or catch on fire you will land (or can jump) in the water and try again.

The door open as you approach and a gunman and his dogs attack. Kill them all then jump 
to the slope box and jump and grab and pull up onto the lowest chandelier. Do a running 
jump to the right to grab the ledge. Pull up and flip the switch to open a door behind
the fire in the fireplace.

Jump back to the chandelier then turn and jump to the next highest chandelier. Do another
running jump to the ledge on the right to flip another switch which opens a painting on
the wall which conceals the Library Key.

Return to the chandelier then turn right and jump to the next highest light and finally 
to the ledge above. Kill the approaching rats then continue in their direction and jump
and grab and shimmy to the right until you can pull up. You should now be on the highest
rafter so run and jump to the wood floor by some bricks. Kill the henchman behind the 
bricks and take the medkit. Be careful not to fall off as any fall from this height is
instant death.

Climb on the bricks and head left and jump to reach another switch. Flip it to adjust 
the chandelier height so you can access the Library Key. Jump back to the bricks then go
down to the chandelier and jump until you reach the light next to the Library Key. Do a
running jump to grab and pull up and get the key then repeat to get back out on the 
chandelier. Jump all the chandeliers until you are on the other side then do a running
jump and grab to the ledge. You won't grab but you will land on the ledge and this saves
you from having to return to that last switch to adjust the chandelier heights.

Exit to the window sill and go right. You should see the fire below, so hang and drop 
down to land in the water and not the fire. You should now be outside the Library door.
Flip the underwater switch and swim through the door that opens as a result. Head to the
right and surface. You should see a gap in the floor to your left. It's dark down there
so light a flare and head into the opening. This turns into a maze rather quickly so 
follow these directions.

As you swim into the hole turn to the right and go around the corner. Swim into the 
large opening then go through the smaller opening near the top of the wall. Turn right
after entering the smaller passage then find the small opening to the lower-bottom-left
of the wall. Enter and immediately turn left to find some grenades before continuing 
back to the right to find

Secret #2; the Gold

Dragon. Flip the nearby switch then head straight up to the newly opened door where you 
can finally take a breath. Do NOT climb out here or you will burn to death. Instead,
retrace your path through the maze back to the library door.

Enter the Library and kill the gunman across the room. Go through the large doors and 
climb up the bookcase on the left. You can kill a pair of rats from the small area above
before jumping over to flip the switch which opens another guarded doorway.

After you kill this guard, go through the door and climb the books on the left. Jump 
towards the window then turn left and climb up. Shoot the window then jump to the sill.
Turn and exit the window backwards so you slide down the awning. Grab the end the pull 
up so you backflip to a ledge behind you. Run and jump to the roof across from your new 
position, then turn left and jump to the TOP of the brick wall.

This next sequence is extremely difficult (at least it was for me) so SAVE frequently.

While standing ON the wall, walk to the end to the top of the slope. Turn so you are 
facing the building across the canal and do a running jump to grab the lowest section of
the roof. Pull yourself up and head for the smoke stack. Stand a few steps back from the
edge of the roof and jump toward the ledge. Grab on and shimmy left until you can pull
up. Go behind the wall to find a pool of water and a pair of Uzi's.

Drop down next to the shack and kill the henchman, taking the ammo he leaves behind.
Take the Detonator Key from the table then step towards the door and it will 
automatically open. Kill the gunman on the other side, taking evasive action if 
necessary. Take his medkit before returning to the main room of the Library. There is a
switch on the wall so flip it to open the door. Enter and kill 2 more gunmen who 
approach from the left. Relieve them of their shells and Uzi ammo before continuing.

Don't use the key in the Detonator box just yet. Instead, climb to the top of the brick
wall and go to the left end of the wall. Pull up twice so that you are now standing on
the sloped roof. Shoot out the glass and take Secret #3; the Jade Dragon from the table.
Jump into the water and swim over to the low brick wall with the Detonator Box. Use the
key to blow up the building, then kill that gunman that is above and behind you.

Climb onto the brick wall to gain access to the demolished building. Begin the long 
ascent to the top of the rubble. After much jumping, grabbing and pulling up, you will
reach the top and can take the path which leads to a dark hall and the end of this level.

@node "7" "Opera House"


                                      Opera House



This level starts off with a rather challenging gunfight. You can run around taking 
random shots at the gunman on the platform below until he finally dies. Then take his
ammo and jump into the water from where he was standing moments ago. Swim left around 
the building and climb the ladder, getting off on the small ledge. Walk to the edge of 
the landing and while facing the canal, jump and grab so you can pull up to the top.
Flip the switch to open a door in the roof then continue climbing the ladder to the 
ledge above. Run and jump to the ledge across the canal then turn to the left and do a 
running jump to the ledge with the swinging box. Pull up and continue along the canal 
performing a running jump to the slanted rooftop. Grab onto the edge and shimmy to the 
left until you reach a small ledge.

Do a running jump and a grab in midair so you arc through the opening in the roof. Draw 
your guns in midair to take out the guard, then take the Ornate Key. Start up the stairs
and kill the gunman when he comes through the door. Take his medkit and go to the top of
the stairs. Make your way back to the previous ledge with the swinging box and position
yourself so you are looking at a ledge with a small building to the left. Do NOT try to 
jump through the opening in the center of that building. The floor below the opening in 
the roof is lined with broken glass and you will die.

Instead, do a running jump to land on the slope next to the right wall. Grab and shimmy 
to the left until you are at the flat section in the corner. Standing with your back to
the wall, jump to the slanted roof and slide down and grab. You should be hanging in 
front of the window. Drop and instantly grab again to catch the edge of the sill. Now 
pull up and shoot out the glass and carefully enter the room. The glass is just like the
spikes in the original Tomb Raider so simply WALK to pass by unharmed. Cross the room 
and climb the ladder and use the Ornate Key to unlock the door at the end of the hall.

Now we have a very unstable roof to deal with. Position Lara so she is at the edge of a
solid piece of roof and facing the wall on the other side of the three collapsing
pieces. Do a Standing Jump and begin running when you hit the first panel. When you 
cross the 3rd panel do a running jump, and when you finally cross the last set of 
collapsing panels do a running jump to grab and pull up onto the ledge. Draw your guns 
and proceed to the top of the Opera House.

Shoot the guard patrolling the roof then turn and lower down. While hanging onto the
edge, quickly pull back up and draw your weapons again. Your short dangle off the edge 
should have attracted the attention of another guard and a couple of Dobermans. Kill
them all, then do a running jump to the roof and continue left to kill four more guards
below. Take the medkits, shells and ammo from the dead guards then return to your 
previous location to check out the swinging box.

Do a running jump and grab and pull up to a small area to the right of the swinging box 
and light a flare. Drop down and flip the switch to the left of the box. Three rooftop
doors open and two gunmen show up looking for trouble. Climb up and kill these guys then
drop through the newly opened door in the roof.

A pair of switches awaits you below. The right switch is useless for now so flip the 
left one to open a grate, then exit through that grate. Run by the hall to trigger a
boulder. Stand by the wall switch to avoid the deadly rock then flip the switch to close 
the grate and climb up the ladder. Continue climbing up the grate until you are across 
from an opening which would have been blocked if you hadn't so cleverly lowered the 
grate before climbing up.

Drop down to the floor and kill the gunman to the left making a special effort NOT to go
underneath the sandbag. Take his medkit then head towards the doors to the right. Making
extra sure to stay out from underneath that sandbag, kill the advancing Doberman and 
henchman. Turn back towards the first gunman and continue until you reach another pair
of Dobermans which you can feel free to kill. There is a switch here which is missing a 
Relay Box so make a note of its position - you will be back later.

Head around the upper walkway towards the open doors. A sandbag will smash through the 
floor allowing you to look down into the hole. Take a few steps back and do a running 
jump so you reach the small ledge below. Two Dobermans and a gunman appear on the ground 
floor, so kill them before dropping to the floor below. Kill the gunman hiding in the 
dark on the second level from the top so he won't snipe you when you reach the floor. 
Make your way to the floor and climb onto the box near the wall opposite the stage. Jump 
and pull up to the walkway. Get past the broken floor until you reach the wall with the 
curtains.

Go to the edge and jump forward and pull up to kill another gunman and relieve him of 
his ammo. Return to the ground floor and run along the back wall to trigger two rolling 
boulders. Take the medkit from the gunman you killed from above then go into the water.
Another gunman comes out on stage and his performance is less than acceptable. Kill him 
and take his Uzi ammo after you kill the Doberman coming in from the left and another 
gunman sneaking in from behind. Off to the side where the Doberman originated is a small
alcove with a switch. Flip the switch to open a grate at the other end of the stage.

As you approach the grate some more bad guys arrive for target practice. After you have 
killed them and taken the medkit, jump and pull up to the ledge where the grating was.
Walk - do not run - through the glass then turn left and do a running jump and grab onto
the crevice in the wall so you can shimmy to the left until you can pull up and flip the 
switch which lowers the plank.

Run and jump back to the previous walkway and stop before your momentum takes you into 
the deadly glass. Continue down the walkway and do a running jump to grab and pull up to
the ledge on the left. Jump and pull up once more then turn and run and jump and pull up 
again to continue your upward journey. Kill the rat then get the timing down on the 
swinging sandbag. Do a standing jump when the first sandbag is at the end of its swing.
Jump past the second one to the ledge and flip the switch to send another sandbag 
hurtling through the stage floor.

Walk carefully towards the sloped ledge then turn around and slide down backwards,
grabbing on to the edge when you fall. Pull up and backflip through the hole in the floor
and light one of your flares. Follow the passage to the left staying along the left wall.
You will enter a larger room with a ledge and a switch to your left.

To your right is a tiny underwater passage. Swim into this passage to find

Secret #1; the Stone

Dragon, then return to the ledge and flip the switch to open a door back up above the 
right side of the stage. No go back so you are once again under the hole in the stage 
and take the large passage at the end of the room. Swim up and keep to the right and you 
will find the missing Relay Box. Climb the ladder up through the door you recently 
opened. Return to the top floor of the Opera House and kill two more Dobermans as you 
make your way back to the switch where you needed the Relay Box. Insert the box and flip
the switch to activate the elevator.

This is a tricky secret. Do not get in the elevator. Instead, wait for it to go down 
then get ON the elevator and quickly jump to the ladder and climb up into the hidden
opening. WALK through the deadly glass and pick up 

Secret #2; the Gold Dragon,

then flip the switch to your left. Continue through the glass making sure to grab that 
Uzi ammo in the second alcove to the left before entering the door you just opened with
the switch. Return to the elevator switch and flip it so you can take the elevator down.

Two gunman are waiting as the elevator doors open so kill them quickly and add their 
shells to your ammo collection. Flip the switch to send the elevator back up and to also
give you access to a hidden pool of water which the elevator was concealing. Jump in and
head for the grating then turn left and follow some stairs to an underwater area. Take
the Circuit Board which is lying in the corner of this room then return to the grating
you swam past a minute ago.

Go to the left and around the grate to find and flip a switch which opens a side of the
cage letting Lara surface and catch her breath. Climb out and kill some rats then turn 
and jump to grab and pull up to the next level. Kill the quickly advancing gunman then
jump and pull up again to kill another rat and a Doberman. Continue along the hall until
you reach some windows. Shoot out the glass then drop into the room below and use the 
switch to open the door.

Slide down the sloped passage jumping over the deadly fan at the last possible second.
You should land on a ledge with the Ornate Key. After you take the key, pull up to the 
tallest block and jump to the slope and head for the duct. Jump in and kill the rat.
Continue along until you reach the edge of the duct then jump the gap. Turn and jump back
to avoid another deadly fan and repeat once more for the final fan.

Look up at the dark area without any fan. Jump forward from the edge of the duct you are
standing on to grab and pull up to get 

Secret #3; the Jade Dragon.

There is a deadly fan behind the dragon so if you can either light a flare or just
carefully WALK forward until you get the statue. Return and hang and drop to get back to
the duct below.

Head down the hall until you reach a moveable box. Pull it to gain access to a switch 
which you can flip to open a door. Pull the box once more then push it all the way into 
the dressing room under the first windows. Get on the box and shoot out any windows that
still have glass in them then jump into the first windows. Another box is in here so 
push it out the windows so it lands on top of the previous box. Jump and grab the top 
box and pull up. Now you can reach the top row of windows so jump in and kill the guard
who has been waiting patiently for your return.

Now begin the long trek back to the Control Room using the shaft next to the elevator.
Jump and pull up until you finally reach the lock. Use the key to open the doors then 
continue forward. If you failed to trigger the boulders your first time through this 
area, then you need to avoid them now. Stay along the wall and head towards the switch
to open the door at the top of the ladder.

Enter the Control Room and use the Circuit Board before flipping the switch to raise 
the backdrop on stage.

Return to the stage and kill the 3 gunmen and the Doberman. Get the medkit and shells 
from your fallen enemies then go through the hole in the wall to find many stacked boxes.
One of the smaller ones can be pulled out so find it and pull it twice to gain access to
a hidden passage. Enter and use the switch to lower the backdrop then exit this area and
kill another guard who should be just arriving.

Start climbing the boxes until you reach the white ledge above the stage. Kill the
henchman down below and try to avoid any sandbags which will kill you on impact. When he
is dead, look around and find the opening above. Jump forward and pull up into this area
to flip another switch that opens a door by a swinging sandbag.

Now stand at the edge of the opening and do an angled jump to the slope on the right.
Slide down and stay along the right to do a timed dash past the swinging sandbag. Hang
and drop to get past the swinging box and arrive at the floor. Bartoli should arrive
shortly and he seems to be particularly vulnerable to shotgun blasts. Two Dobermans will
also attack your when you reach the floor but should fall quickly to the power of the
shotgun. When you finally kill Bartoli, take all the grenades and kill off the two 
remaining henchmen. Take the medkit and Uzi clips from these two fellows then go to the 
other side of the room and climb on the box to make your way back to the room with the 
stacked boxes next to the entrance. There should be a button next to the entry which 
will open the exit. Get onboard the airplane and take off for the next level...

@node "8" "Offshore Rig"


                                     Offshore Rig


What a way to start a level - Stripped of all your possessions and locked up! First we 
need to get Lara out of this jail cell then find her weapons. There is a switch which
opens the cell door but it's on a timer so before you go flipping it you had better 
clear an escape route. When you have pushed and pulled the crates so you have a clear
path to the door, go pull the switch (which I hope you have found by now).

Once you escape the alarm will sound and the bad guys start to show up. The first one 
to worry about is coming from your left. Head off to meet him, and get past him so you 
can lead him back to his starting location. Dodge his gunfire and also the blows of his
friend who is also waiting here. Try to draw his gunfire so he blows out the nearby 
windows which you can promptly escape through. Head right along the narrow ledge and 
press the button on the wall to open the bay doors beneath the plane. Swim inside and 
go over to press another button to kill the plane's engines then return back through 
the broken window and do a running jump and pull up to the top of the engine. Drop into 
the trapdoor on top of the plane to find your lost Pistols.

Go back and kill those two bullies who were giving you a hard time earlier and take the 
Yellow Key Card. Go back through the broken window and head left this time to a room 
with some water. Dive in the water and flip the switch beneath the tunnel opening which
grants you access to the upcoming 

Secret #1; the Jade Dragon.

Resurface and fill those lungs for a long dive. Enter the tunnel and follow it left 
then right and then a sharp right then take the downward passage staying near the top so
you can get behind the underwater fan. Grab the dragon statue and swim back to the 
surface to catch your breath before heading back to the door with the Yellow Key Lock.

Enter the next room and press the button on the far wall to kill the alarm. Go up the 
stairs to the right and spin the wheel to open the door. Kill the rig worker and take 
his medkit then proceed into the next room and kill another workman who is coming down a
ramp and through a door which locks as you near it. Spin the wheel to open the next door
and kill a guard and get some ammo and your first batch of harpoons.

Enter the bunk area and reclaim your Auto-Mags from the right top-center bunk then go to
the end and get the Harpoon Gun from the last bunk on the left. Go back to the entrance
of the bunk area and press the button above the top-left bunk to open a door in the 
ceiling at the opposite end. Run to the top right bunk and climb on and jump and grab to
the opening to gain access to the passage above.

Continue down the hall and slide backwards down the ramp so you can grab on and use the 
ladder to climb down to the floor. We need to use those boxes to get past the 4 burners 
and reach the ladder on the other side. Pull the first one to the left all the way past
the other box then go push the second box towards the burners. Now you can do a running
jump and grab onto the ladder.

When you reach the top of the ladder, head to the right and kill another guard who also 
happens to have the Red Key Card on him. Climb the ladder to get 

Secret #2; the Stone Dragon.

Go up the stairs and return to the room with the water from earlier in the game. Now 
that you know where you are; return to the room with the button that turned off the alarm
and go up the stairs to the left of the button. Kill the guard and his dog and take the
Uzi clips. The door with the Red Key Lock is at the top of the ramp so jump out of the
way of the rolling barrels to make your way to this door.

Enter the door and head left to kill another Rig Worker as another sneaks up behind you 
and another climbs in from the right. Take the shells, medkit and flares from the 
resulting casualties then return to the landing near the entrance. Push the box once 
then go around it and pull it once then go around and push it once more. Now you can go 
to the opposite landing and do a running jump and grab to pull up onto the box and 
access the opening in the wall.

Take the shells from the guard you kill in this passage and go to the door with the 
Green Key Lock. There is also a switch and a trapdoor in this area. Flip the switch to 
see that empty tank behind you being filled with water. Return and drop down to the floor
then swing across the water tank and head right. Go over the pipes then head left until
you find a switch on the wall which opens the trap door back near the door with the 
Green Key Lock. Go all the way back and drop into the trapdoor and slide down the ramp.

Deadly Frogmen are lurking in the water so run to the right and see if you can catch one
on the surface and blast him. If you miss him or he's not there, just return to the other
end and dive in and get ready for action. Swim toward the pillars quickly as you are 
being pursued by a deadly frogman. Climb up on the closest pillar using one of the two 
sides with the yellow stripes and wait for the frogman to surface. Finish him off with
your favorite weapon.

The next closest pillar has a ladder which leads to the catwalk above. Before you climb 
up it, go get 

Secret #3; the Gold Dragon

which is sitting at the base of the pillar at the end of that catwalk where you ran to 
try and shoot the first frogman. When you claim your prize, two guards will arrive. You 
can either fight them here to snipe them from the catwalk above.

When you are up the ladder you need to follow the catwalk and do a running jump when you
reach the gap. Grab on and pull up and kill the gunman who just happens to have your 
Shotgun. Take back your weapon then go right and when you reach the central wall, go left
and follow the catwalks. You should spot a hole in the wall up above (the Exit) and 
another bad buy up ahead guards the Green Key Card which is inside a box. Kill him, then
jump into the box. You will break through and can now take the card.

Follow the catwalk up to the hole in the wall and return to the room with the door with 
the Green Key Lock, making sure to kill the guard you meet on the way. Once the door is 
open you need to flip that switch on the wall to drain the water from the one tank and
pump it into the other. Now you can swim through the opening and flip the underwater
switch to open the grate. Climb up and head down the passage to the exit...

@node "9" "Diving Area"


                                      Diving Area



Jump from the ledge over to the ladder and press the button in the hall to stop the 
deadly fan. Now you can safely dive in and get the grenades beneath the fan. Now go flip
the switch near the walkway to open the sealed door and continue down the hall.
A Doberman and two guards attack from the left so finish them off before continuing. Get
the shells and Uzi's if needed then use the pillars to get across the vat. Make sure to
avoid the swinging hooks, but if you "go for a swim" you can use the tunnel under the 
water to make your way back and try again.

Kill two more guards and take their flares and the medkit. Now you should be at the top 
of a long slide which dumps you right into a vat of toxic waste. About halfway down the 
slope is a hole which contains 

Secret #1; the Stone Dragon.

You can slide forward and into the hole where you can claim your statue before climbing 
out and continuing your slide towards the toxic waste. When you reach the bottom you can
jump across the waste to the other side.

Climb up the ladder and grab some ammo then check out the slope beneath the hole. Jump 
in the hole and grab the ledge as you slide off backwards. There is a guard on duty 
below so get ready. Drop down and grab and pull up while drawing your guns to kill the 
guard. Take all that ammo he leaves behind. The door with the Blue Key Lock is near your
present location and the Blue Key Card is in a hole on the other side of the room. Jump
into the small opening from the catwalk. You will slide down the slope and into the hole
where you can take the card then follow the tunnel back around and up the ladder and to 
the door with the Blue Key Lock.

Get ready for action as you enter this next room. Four Dobermans and a guy with a
flamethrower are just waiting to take you on. Dispose of the dogs while keeping a safe
distance from the guy with the fire. Take him out QUICK with the biggest gun you have.
It's best to kill these guys before they ever get off a shot. If they do manage to 
"flame-on" then just backup and wait until it is safe to move in and finish them off.

There should be four doors; two of which have wheels you can spin to open them with. One
door leads to stairs going up and the other has stairs going down. Go down these stairs
and eliminate the workman then push the box out of the way to reveal a control panel
with a missing Chip. Make a note of the circular saw as you will be coming back shortly.

Before you jump into the water make sure you have found the only place that you can get
back out. Now dive in and tease the frogman so he follows you to the surface. Climb out
and fill him with lead then dive back in and explore the tunnel he was guarding. You
should find two switches inside the tunnel - flip them both and continue along this 
passage making a series of right turns. A door should open as your get near, so go 
through and turn left to arrive back at the large pool. Go up the stairs and take care 
of the two guards and the workman who are guarding a helicopter.

Grab the medkit, ammo and shells when the shootout is over.

Cross the large room and enter the smaller room with some burners in the floor, a
trapdoor, a switch and a button. Flip the switch on the right and head forward and drop
through the trapdoor to collect the M-16 and some clips. Quickly climb out and return to
the button before the burner turns back on. Flip the switch again then jump to the left
and push the button then make a dash across the room, jumping OVER the trap door and 
grab the Chip. Quickly do a reverse roll and head back out of this room and to the 
control panel where you can use the Chip.

After you insert the Chip, the door open. Run down the ramp and shoot the workman across
the pool from the safety of the hallway, then run across to the medkit he dropped. A
flamethrower is to your left and he opens fire as you run past. Take care of him from
the opposite side of the pool then go to the right of the orange tank to open a secret
panel. Go inside and press the button, then return and dive into the pool to obtain 

Secret #2; the Jade Dragon

from the now-opened grate at the bottom.

Exit the pool and grab the Harpoon Gun which is next to the scuba gear then dive back in
and head down the underwater tunnel. When you hear the breathing of approaching frogmen,
retreat back to dry land and kill both of them from the safety of the shore. Now jump 
back in and swim through the passage to emerge in another room. Exit on the low ledge on
the right and take care of those two workmen. Now you can jump up to the top of the wall
and flip the switch to open a door back in the previous room.

Return to the previous room where a frogman and two workers are waiting for you. Kill 
them all and take the medkit and Uzi clips as your reward. Go through the door you just 
opened and use the switch the crane will move allowing you to climb up and over to the
other side of the pool.

Head for the corner and jump over the boxes and press the button to get a view of the 
room with the door you "unsealed" earlier. Head for that room now killing the two guards 
and their dogs. When you arrive, drop down and enter the tunnel and arrive at the central
chamber. A guard tries to distract you from his friend with the Flamethrower who is
sneaking around the corner so take out the flamethrower guy first then finish off his 
friend. Grab the second Chip which we need for that circular saw we passed by earlier.
Return there now.

Insert the Chip and the blade disengages and you can now take the Red Key Card before
returning to the central chamber. Use your new key card and drop down to take care of 
the Rig Boss. Continue into the room with the water and take care of the remaining Rig 
Workers. Take the medkit and also the harpoons which are over by the scuba tanks.
Continue through the door until you enter a large room.

Kill the Rig Boss and the guard from above then enter the open door to the small room to
obtain

Secret #3; the Gold Dragon.

If for some reason this door is shut, you will need to return to the room where you used
the Red Key Card and flip the switch. The switch toggles this door open and closed, but 
the door should be already open assuming you didn't go flipping switches earlier without
me telling you to. Once you have the statue you can approach the body in the middle of
the room to take a submarine ride and exit this level...

@node "A" "40 Fathoms"


                                      40 Fathoms



Not only do you need to find some air - you also need to out-swim a Great White Shark 
who has selected you as its next meal. Spin around and start swimming behind you,
following all the junk on the ocean floor. When you arrive at the ship, swim into the
hole where the anchor is protruding and find the air-pocket so you can breath. The shark
is still coming so when your lungs are filled dive down and swim into the hole below and
angle off to the right.

Head up and into the large room then enter the opening on the left and continue on into 
a smaller area and take the next opening on the left. You should now be in a room with a
patterned floor so head left and swim down towards the metal girder and flip the switch
to open a door in the floor behind you. Swim through this door and go left and follow
the passage until you see a hole above. Surface to finally catch your breath and climb
on the box that is floating here.

Head for the pile of boxes on the right and swim into the small opening in the middle.
Climb out and head to your right. At the end of the dark hall is a switch so flip it then
return to the stack of boxes and climb them to enter the next room. Drop down to the
floor and kill the workman who tries a sneak-attack from behind one of the boxes. Grab
the shells from your enemy being extra careful not to step on the dark area of the floor
which is a giant trapdoor.

Secret #1; the Stone Dragon

is just sitting there for the taking, so go get it while 
avoiding that trapdoor. Once you have the statue you can jump over the door which will
cause it to open. Now you can kill off all the bad guys from up here before dropping down
to the closest box to pick up your spoils; a medkit and harpoons. Now climb on the box in
the middle of the room and jump to the higher box along the wall so you can climb into
the opening and enter the next area.

When you enter this next room flip the switch to your immediate left to open a timed door
near the windows. Run and jump and enter the door (the timer will stop when you are in).
Dive down to get 

Secret #2; the Jade Dragon 

while avoiding those pesky underwater creatures who would try and stop you.

Lara now needs to get past a long row of timed burners which line the hall. Here are 
explicit directions for getting past the hardest puzzle encountered so far. Start down
the hall and turn into the dark passage and climb up into the hole in the ceiling. Flip
the switch to open the door next to the hall with the burners. Enter that door and get
ready for the race of your life. Saving wouldn't be such a bad idea.

HINT: When racing through this puzzle make sure you jump over the beams and even the 
short walls which lead to the rooms with the switches. If you try to climb or even
stumble, you will lose precious seconds that you don't have.

Flip the switch to turn off the first set of burners which lets you run as far as the 
next switch. Flip that to open the other door then run and enter that room to flip
another switch. All burners are off for the moment so run all the way back to the first
switch to turn off the first set of burners. You should now have plenty of time
(or about 10 seconds) to run the entire gauntlet of burners and arrive at your next
puzzle.

Go into the water and kill the Barracuda. Now get ready for a puzzle almost as 
challenging as the last - only this time it's UNDERWATER! To sum it up; you need to swim
through several underwater rooms, flip a switch in the third room then swim to the bottom
to flip another switch which opens the hatch up above. Secret #3; the Gold Dragon is also
at the bottom in a tunnel by the switch. And if your running out of air wasn't enough
- let's throw in a mess of Barracudas with an attitude which swarm in when you touch
that statue. Sound like fun?

Good - Go for it!

HINT: Always slow down when making underwater turns, and always do the Reverse Roll to 
back away from switches after using them. You can also skip the mini-movies by pressing 
Lara's "look" button to save valuable seconds. And if you just can't manage to get that
statue, you can always surface and fill-up on air before diving back down to get it.

Drop down into the next area and survey all the rocks and junk in this room. Find and 
drop through the hole in the floor then find and pull the box so it is under the opening.
Now you can climb up and use the switch which will dump all the rocks from above down to
this level. You can now reach two new opening and a door opposite the switch. Make your
way to the opening on the right and climb up to reach the previous level. You can only
grab the ledge that faces center of the room below to do this.

Staying along the left wall and go into the opening above. Use the switch to open a door
somewhere else in this level then drop all the way down to the lower level and this time
climb up into the left opening. Keep along the right wall until you can climb up to a
flat ledge. Do a running jump to land on another ledge on the left. Climb up into the
opening above to find and flip another switch to flood an upcoming room.

Once again, return to the lower level and this time enter the door and follow the 
passage to the room you just flooded. There is a door below and a frogman in the water
so dive in and kill him with the harpoon gun. After you eliminate this obstacle,
continue through the passage and get out of the water fast. A workman and a Rig Boss are
moving in for the kill.

When they are dead you can take their medkit, shells and 2 packs of harpoons over in the
corner. Use the switch on the wall to open the door and exit this level...

@node "B" "Wreck Of The Maria Doria"


                               Wreck of the Maria Doria




Kill the frogman before attempt to get those harpoons. Then you can proceed down the
underwater tunnel until you can climb out onto a ledge and take the medkit. Slide down 
the slope then hang and drop to the floor which breaks away dropping you even further.

Kill the workman and guard in this next area and claim their medkits and Uzi clips. Pull
out the moveable box in this area to uncover a few more moveable boxes. Continue to move
the first box until it is in the hallway. Now you can push and pull the remaining two
boxes until you reveal two concealed passages.

Look for a hole in the ceiling on the other side of the room. Climb up and kill a
patrolling guard up ahead and the other who sneaks in from the rear. Take 

Secret #1; the Stone

Dragon from the hole then return to the two passages.

The left passage goes to a locked bathroom so take the right passage to the Ballroom and
kill the workman and the guard on your way. Feel free to take their medkit and flares 
before entering the Ballroom. Watch out for the deadly glass as you take out the guard on
the second level. Move around to the side of the hole where there is no glass then step
back and run into the hole letting your momentum carry you to the ledge below.

You should easily find the Bathroom Key nearby before making a return jump to the side
of the hole without the glass where you can pull back up to the Ballroom. Return to the 
left passage which leads to the bathroom and use your key on the lock behind the chair.

Push the button to open the double doors and kill the workman who comes charging out. Go
through these doors to find and push another button to open the door on the second level
of the Ballroom. Go back and press the other button to shut these doors before leaving.

Back in the Ballroom, drop off and shimmy to the left to reach the open door. Now you
can take the ramp to the right of the door up to the second level. Take the ammo from the
guard you shot earlier then continue on until you can do a running jump to grab a ledge
which has Circuit Breaker #1. Take it then return to the door.

You should now be in a hall with several doors. The first door on the left leads to an
empty room but open it anyway. The only other door you can open (right now) is the door
on the right with the wheel. Spin it to open the door then enter and drop to the floor.
Move the box until you can reach the switch then use it to open the door above. Move the
box up there so you can reach the door.

Continue through the next room and up the ramp to deal with another guard, then head for
the next room which has a box in it.

Move this box so you can reach the switch above and take the Rusty Key that was under 
the box. You can now return to the hall and use the key in the door opposite the open 
door to the empty room. Enter and drop to the floor and move the box so you can pull out
the box above. After you pull the first box and push the second one, you should find a 
passage to the right. The floor will break away here and there are also barrels which 
will roll over you if you try to simply dart across the collapsing floor. Instead, run a
sweeping arc to collapse all the panels while avoiding the barrels. You should end up
where you started.

Heavy breathing should tip you off that another bad guy is lurking in the vicinity. Head
around the left corner and take care of the guard then return to the tiles where the 
barrels came from and go get 

Secret #2; the Jade Dragon.

This is tricky as a lone barrel is waiting to crush you. Jump up to the sloping passage
and as you pull up you should hear the approaching barrel. Jump back then to the left to
sidestep the barrel then you can proceed up the passage to claim your statue.

When you arrive at the room with the grate floor and a boat below you need to drop down 
to the boat and flip the underwater switch over by the ladder. This opens a timed door 
up above so get back on the boat and pull up to the floor above and run through the door.

Flip the switch you find in here to permanently keep the door open, then begin a series
of jumps between the two sloped areas. Keeping jumping until the pit below closes then
you can stand and pull yourself up into the opening. Flip the switch to open up a section
of the wall back past the area with the boat.

Return to the newly exposed area and kill the workman and the guard then push the button
on the left to open a timed trapdoor. Run around the pool and dash through the trapdoor
before it shuts. Go get Circuit Breaker #2 which is down to your right. Taking this item
opens the exit which is also on a timer. Grab the medkit then go and press the button on
the wall to drain the water where the boat is. Trip the exit open again and return back
to the area with the boat. Jump down onto the boat then spin the wheel to open the door.

The passage leads off to the left where there is a trapdoor to the Bathroom. The double 
doors should form a bridge for you to cross over and get Circuit Breaker #3. If the doors
are open you will need to go past the trapdoor to find the button which shuts them. Now
with all three Circuit Breakers, drop down into the Bathroom and kill the guard and 
workman and take their ammo and harpoons.

Return to the pool room from the beginning of this level and get the medkit from the 
corner of the room. Take a deep breath and swim through the passage and flip the switch
at the bottom of the tall shaft which will open the door up top. Now swim up and out 
through that door and kill the worker, guard and boss. Use your M-16 to kill them quickly
then take their medkit, shells, and Uzi clips. Plug in those breakers into their slots 
then move the box under the opening above and climb up. Take care of another workman
then flip the switch to flood the room up ahead. Jump across the overhead ducts to reach
this area.

Follow the passage and kill the Barracuda when you wade into the water. Grab those 
harpoons over to your right then head through the exit to the dark passage on the left 
where you can kill another worker. Make a note of the Cabin Door then continue left to
find some ammo. In the room with the windows you need to spin the wheel to open the door.
Enter and flip the switch then run to the other side of the room through the timed door 
to get some flares. Push the box and use the switch to open the trapdoor at the end of
the hall.

Go to the trapdoor and jump into the ocean. Climb out and wait for all of those dangerous
underwater obstacles to start swimming towards you. Wait for most of them to appear 
below you - which means they aren't guarding the key - then jump in and begin the race
for the key. The fish are fast swimmers so try not to make and drastic course changes.
Swim through the opening up ahead and turn right. The windows should now be on your right
and the Cabin Key lies behind the rocks on the left.

Dodge the shark while getting the key then make a sweeping circle back around toward the
opening you swam through a minute ago. The pack of fish should still be pursuing so head
for the opening. As you exit through the opening look for a cave opening across from 
where you exit. Swim into the cave and stay along the right wall until you can see a 
small opening above you. Swim to the surface and breath and take 

Secret #3; the Gold Dragon

while you rest for the final race back to the ship. When you are ready, dive down and 
exit the cave and return to the trap door dodging the fish as needed.

Climb up through the trap door and turn left and return to the Cabin Door and use that 
key. Enter and flip the switch to open a trapdoor outside. Now go push the box to flip
another switch before returning to the cabin where an opening in the ceiling should be
waiting. Climb up and proceed down the passage until you drop into the next room. Make
your way around to the right to the hole in the floor. Turn and run into the pool room 
and stop before you go in the water. Kill the guard and the boss and take the M-16 ammo.
Dodge the shots of the frogmen from below and if you need it, go get the M-16 from the 
dark passage.

Kill the frogmen then jump into the water. If they refuse to make good targets then jump
in and tease them then climb out and shoot them when they eventually surface. When both
are gone dive in and move the barrel to reveal the passage which leads to the exit....

                                    Living Quarters



Hang a left as you being this next underwater level and pull the lever to open the 
trapdoors ahead. Enter and cross the next room taking care of the crewman on the way.
Jump to the flat area to find a switch up above. Go to the other side of the room and
out through the opening. Continue down the passage and eliminate the workman and the 
guard and take the harpoons for your efforts.

As you exit the passage you will need to backflip to avoid some barrels then kill the 
crewman who arrives on the scene. At the top of the ramp, grab onto the ledge and shimmy
over to the switch and use it to turn off those burners. Head to the left and enter the
next passage to find and use another switch. Drop through the hole to arrive back at the
piston room.

Jump and grab to reach the first piston then begin to cross over the rest of them. Kill 
the guard up ahead then turn right to do a running jump to get to the ledge with

Secret #1; the Stone

Dragon. Once you have your prize, do another running jump and grab and pull up to 
continue. Follow the winding hall until you reach a box which you can push to open the 
way to a second box.Push the first box two more times then you can move in to push the
second box. Drop down through the hole to flip the switch then jump back up and grab and
pull back up to the box area.

Return to the pistons and climb back across to the other side. With the pistons in their
new position you can now reach the ledge to the right. A running jump with a grab should
let you pull up and flip the switch to flood the room with the burners.

Return to that room and pull the lever which opens the door. Swim through the door and 
kill the frogman on the other side from the safety of the room to the left. When he is 
dead and your lungs are filled you need to open that trapdoor in the ceiling of the 
large room. Swim into the cave and head left. Try to keep to the left side of the cave
and the Giant Moray Eel may just not kill you.

Flip the switch then head for the trapdoor. Stay out of the moss or you will get tangled
and drown.

Kill the guard up above as you exit the trapdoor. Use the switch to open the door on the
opposite side of the catwalk then enter that door to find two switches. Flip the switch
on the right then immediately flip the left switch to raise some metal devices behind
you. Flip the first switch and jump right then left then throw the left switch. Reverse
roll, then run and jump forward and grab to shimmy to the right until you reach the ledge
with the switch to open the trapdoors.

Head for the corner where the trapdoor is. Facing the lower slope, do a series of jumps
between the slopes to grab and pull up to the top ledge. Cross over on the ducts and move
the box out of the way. Shimmy past it and continue along to the large metal beam in the
center of the room. Continue along the ducts until you can jump into the opening in the
wall on the other side. A workman is to your right so take care of him before proceeding.
At the end of the hall go to the area where the workman came from. Below is

Secret #2; the Gold

Dragon which is protected by deadly glass, so jump over and pull up into the upper area 
and fall through the floor. Take the statue and walk through the deadly glass until you 
can pull yourself back up to the hall.

Continue on and slide down the ramp and shoot the Barracuda which waits in the pool 
below. In the corner is a collapsing panel which leads to Secret #3; the Jade Dragon.
Stand on it just long enough to have it start to break then pull up and kill another
pesky fish before swimming through the opening to collect this level's final secret.

Use the pillars to make your way to the top of the slope. Watch out for the collapsing
floor between the two pillars by the window. Immediately jump to the taller pillar 
before you fall through. Shimmy across to the right and pull up. Continue up the slope
and drop into the hall and kill the guard up ahead on the right. Proceed down the 
walkway and kill another guard to your left. Pull the box at the end of the room to open
the way to the Theater.Head back and jump over the balcony.

Kill the crewman and the guard who appear below the balcony. Drop into the pit where 
these bad guys used to be and move the box to reveal the Theater Key. Push the box back 
to climb out and kill the boss who has just arrived. Head for the Theater and kill the
crewman who is to the right of the theater door. Enter the theater and kill another
crewman to the right unless he was already waiting behind the door in which case; kill
him where he stands.

A boss and crewman are on the right balcony so kill them and flip the switch nearby.
Then go pull the curtain on the stage and kill the workman. You may want to light a flare
to find the button across the pit of glass. Press it to flood the pit back in the
previous room where you found the Theater Key. Return to that area, killing another boss
on the way. With the pit full of water, you can now make it across and enter the passage
and exit this level...

@node "D" "The Deck"


                                       The Deck



You start this level under immediate attack from a Flamethrower and a workmen to the 
right. Take care of them quickly then continue around to the right and add the Grenade
Launcher to your arsenal. Now head back to where you started and dive in the water to the
right. Exit on the left landing to avoid the circling barracuda and kill them from their.
Then proceed across the ledges to your left to obtain the Stern Key.

Jump back in and facing the hull, turn left and head down to the opening in the rocks.
Enter then head right and finally left before going up to the hole. Exit the water firing
at the approaching workman. The giant propeller is blocking your exit so keep going
until you find and kill another Flamethrower standing by a trapdoor. There is a dead end
below so head for that stack of crates. Push the first one then climb on top and push the
top box. Drop down and pull the first box then go behind it and push it over to the ledge
where the Flamethrower was. Now you can go and move a third box to reveal a door. Use the
Stern Key.

Enter then swim down and head for the switch on the right wall. Use it to open the dead 
end from the previous paragraph Return to the trapdoor and flip the switch to drain the 
room behind the Stern Key door. You will need to kill another boss along the way. Now you
can move the box to find the passage leading past the propeller.

You should arrive at the raft so jump in the water and head left and exit quickly to 
dispatch another workman on shore before dealing with two more frogmen in the water.
Facing the raft, you can jump in and swim down and to the left to find 

Secret #1; the Stone

Dragon hidden in the plants by the rocks.

Take the statue then turn around and head left around the rocks to the tunnel. Watch out
for the approaching Barracuda and kill him from the safety of dry land. Continue down the
tunnel, ignoring the left fork, and get the medkit by the hole in the floor and use it to
totally heal yourself. Hang from the lowest end of the ledge to reduce your damage before
dropping into the hole and land on the box. Take the Cabin Key and go on a shark hunt.

Kill the first two sharks then kill a third shark who is lurking over by where you got 
the dragon statue. Now return to the tunnel and this time take the left fork. Continue
up the winding passage until you reach the upper deck. Explore the area a bit before
dropping down to the deck by the pool and kill the Flamethrower and a few friends before
approaching the strange looking panel on the wall of the pool. A frogman swims out as you
approach so kill him then take 

Secret #2; the Gold Dragon 

that he was guarding.

Some Uzi and M-16 ammo is partially hidden by those boxes near the pool. Scarf it all up
then head over to where you can see the area where you found the Grenade Launcher
earlier. Do a running jump to the flat ledge then do another running jump to grab and
pull up to the walkway. Continue forward and do another running jump to the orange sloped
surface. Head right until you can see the stacked boxes below you. Hang here and drop
then grab immediately so you can shimmy left and pull up. Now do a running jump in the
crack in the wall.

Continue down the tunnel jumping across the platforms. Take care of the workmen who 
would try and stop you. Exit the cave and do a running jump to grab and pull up to the 
roof. Head across the roof and to the left and jump over the alley to find and enter the
trapdoor. Kill the workman and load up on ammo. Head for the door which will open 
automatically and pull the box to reveal a switch. Flip it to open a door on the upper
deck. Go out and up and to the right to the door you just opened to find M-16 ammo and 
the lock which happens to match your Cabin Key.

Fall through the collapsing floor and press the button you find there to open the final 
door on the upper deck. Follow the cave to the hole in the floor and retrieve the Storage
Shed Key. Now you can go to the Storage Shed which is by the propeller. As you head back
along the walkway by the orange sloped surface 

Secret #3; the Jade Dragon

waits for you in a small cave. Jump to the left of the cave entrance then shimmy right
until you can pull up and take your prize. Watch for the glass when you leave. Jump over
the glass and get ready for a big fight when you land.

Two Flamethrower guys are guarding the Storage Shed. Take care of these deadly enemies
quickly (I recommend the M-16) then open the shed with your key to claim the first 
Artifact of the game - the Seraph.

@node "E" "Tibetan Foothills"


                                   Tibetan Foothills




Follow the trail at the start of this level. Take care of the Eagle as you proceed down 
the trail and down the slope to a large area with even larger snow boulders ready to 
crush you. Jump past the first ones then run to the left passage to avoid the rest. Jump
through the ice then as you hit the icy slope, jump again to land on the path to the
right. Follow the path to a large canyon with a hut and a snowmobile. Kill the attacking
eagle before proceeding.

Turn and hang down and drop to start sliding down a slope. Grab again so you hang from 
the bottom edge then drop again to the cave entrance. If you miss the ledge you can 
always try again by climbing the ladder then jumping back to the slope to slide and
repeat the grab and drop.

Follow the cave until you can jump in the pool and cross over. As you exit the water all
those sharp icicles will fall on you. Drop back into the water to avoid them before 
climbing out onto the textured surface and up to a hole in the wall.

Take the left passage from here until you arrive back outside where you can do a running
jump to the next ledge followed by another running jump to the ledge by the hut. Nab the
medkit then climb up the cliff to the hut. Kill the two mercenaries who are guarding the
snowmobile then go get 

Secret #1; the Stone Dragon 

from the ledge to the right of the cave entrance.

Now you can proceed down the passage and kill any enemies you encounter. When you arrive
in the open area with the ramps you need to perform a series of jump until you are ready
to enter the cave with the large stone blocking the way. Jump over the wall on the first
ramp. When you reach the long ramp leading towards the wall, you will want to kill the
leopards lurking to the left. Jump the gap and hop on the snowmobile and jump it across
staying to the left. Another jump should take you to a fork in the trail where you can
park and proceed on foot.

Head to the right and grab the grenades before climbing the ladder to flip a switch 
which opens the gate up ahead. Kill some more mercenaries before getting back on the
snowmobile and heading through the gate you just opened killing another mercenary along
the way. Leave the snowmobile behind in the large cave, and kill two more advancing
mercenaries.

Head out onto the ledge and do a running jump over to the ledge on the right to obtain 

Secret #2; the Jade Dragon,

then return to the snowmobile. Two leopards will be milling around the area so kill them
before making the big jump. Continue left while avoiding more of those giant snowballs
until you reach a cave. Dismount and enter the cave.

A short exploration of the caves reveals a passage to the left as well as a switch by a
gate and a ladder. The ladder is what's important now, so return outside and head for the
ladder. Jump over it then grab the ledge as you slide back down. Now climb down to the
cave and get the Drawbridge Key and continue on until you reach the ice walls. Kill the
mercenary behind the ice then head for the hole to get some grenades and kill three
leopards. Return to the ladder area by doing a running jump then a grab and pull up to 
get back to the snowmobile.

Now you can use the key to lower the bridge so you can ride over to the warning sign.
Dislodge all those giant snowballs before attempting to ride across this area. At the
bottom of the avalanche is the Hut Key which is guarded by a mercenary riding a 
snowmobile equipped with machine guns - not a factory option! Kill him from relative
safety of the area to the left of the key. You can take his snowmobile when he is dead
but it won't make the jump you need to make on your way back so you may as well leave it
behind. Take the Hut Key and begin the long trek back to the hut.

Back at the hut, enter to find the M-16, ammo for the Uzi and some medkits. Flip the 
switch then dash for the door to kill the advancing enemy. Keep above the enemy and pick
them off one at a time. When the battle is over you should have a new snowmobile complete
with machine guns. A nearby ladder leads down to Secret #3; the Gold Dragon. Avoid the
rolling snowball by jumping left before claiming your prize. Climb back up and get on
your new snowmobile.

Two more guys on snowmobiles are waiting up ahead. Let them come to you and take them on
one at a time. When they are dead, continue to the other end of the valley and push the 
stone to continue. At the edge of the abyss you can shoot the guy below to your right.
Now ride your snowmobile right off the cliff and watch as Lara leaps to safety as the
snowmobile is consumed in a fireball below. Pull up onto the ledge and take the trail to
exit this level...

@node "F" "Barkhang Monastery"



                                  Barkhang Monastery




A gang of mercenaries greets you as you arrive at the Monastery. Start fighting them 
best you can until a Priest and two Monks arrive. Monks hate mercenaries and will fight
them whenever they see each other. Monks will not attack Lara unless she attacks them
first, so watch out for "friendly fire". When all the "enemies" are dead you can climb
the ladder across from the double doors. Watch out for the birds who attack while you
climb then jump to the ledge to the right and finally jump to a slope to slide down to
grab the crank.

Drop and hang then drop and grab the ledge below to shimmy left and enter the Monastery
through the window. A Monk should pass by to your left so follow him until you reach the
locked door to the Strongroom. A mercenary should break through a nearby window so grab
the grenades from the ledge outside then return to the hall and head for the door on the
left.

If you haven't already kill the mercenary then he should be following you, so lead him
past the Monk and let him do your dirty work. Now you can climb the ladder to the
walkway above the Monastery's main room where you will find the Main Hall Key being
guarded by a Monk. Walk around the walkway then follow the path past the rolling 
boulders.

Find the box where the second boulder came to rest and push it. Then go to the pool and 
jump in. The current is strong and you will be pulled to the bottom so find the 
underwater tunnel to escape the current. Follow the tunnel until you take a tremendous
plunge into a pool and darkness. Use a flare to light the passage and begin the dangerous
journey past the deadly doors. These doors are similar to the swordsmen guards back in
Bartoli's Hideout. Inch up as close as you can get then run past them.

When you reach the ladder you can climb to the room above and team up with a Monk to kick
some butt. Move the boxes to reveal the exit then take Prayer Wheel #1 from the dark
area. Taking the wheel trips the burners so hug the right wall and jump from the where
you tool the wheel to the edge closest to the first burners. One more jump should take
you over the second row then you can return back to the Main Hall and use that key.

Past the door is a Priest and two more Monks. They will assist you in combat if you lead
them over to the railing. Enter the door on the right and continue through the room to 
the passage on the other side to the left. Do a running jump over some blades then head
down a long hall and enter the left door to acquire the Strongroom Key from a Monk.

Return to the Strongroom and obtain the Rooftop Key. Now return to the hall where you 
first saw the Monk after coming in through the window. This time take the door on the
right to enter a room with a locked door which just happens to fit your new key exactly.
Hug the left wall to get safely past the rolling blades and continue to the next passage.

Behind the gold statue is a switch to turn off the burners in the upcoming hall. Flip 
the switch and make a run for the door on the left about halfway down the hall. Enter
the room, running past two Monks and climb up the ladder. The Monks will take care of
the mercenaries but feel free to help if you want. Head for the courtyard to find and
flip another switch which opens a pair of trapdoors. Break the glass to obtain the 
Gemstones needed to open some upcoming doors.

Around the corner is a switch so use it and then use a Gemstone between the gold statues
to open a door. Enter and pull the box two times to get Prayer Wheel #2. Now return to
the area where you got the Strongroom Key and climb the ladder. Do a running jump to pull
up onto the hand of the statue then you can climb to the higher hand and finally do a
running jump to the statue's head. Go across the head to reach the next hand so you can
use a Gemstone in the socket up above to open a trapdoor below.

Before you jump into the trapdoor, head for the hall by the base of the statue and 
circle around and jump to the ramp and pull up to get 

Secret #1; the Gold Dragon 

which is waiting behind the statue. Back in the hall you should pass another Monk on your
way to the room on the right. Pull the box to the left out and put in between the
barrels. Now you can move the next box to get the ammo out from under it. Now you can 
push the next box so you can get behind it and push it next to the door.

Now move the boxes so that one is in front of the door and the other is next to the 
stack of boxes. This should allow you to pull the top box out to reveal some harpoons.
Return to the hall and head right to pass by three Monks on your way to the room on your
left. The room is filled with water which needs to be drained before proceeding.

Before you drain the room you will want to get 

Secret #2; the Stone Dragon.

Swim to the far side of the room and into the small opening past the ladder to obtain the
statue. Now you can return to the previous room with the trapdoor you opened earlier.
Drop down and follow the passage until you find a switch. Flip it to open a door then 
enter that room and push the box to drain the room you just got the dragon from. With 
the water drained you are unable to reach the opening which previously housed the dragon,
but you can push the box on the ledge to obtain Prayer Wheel #3.

Now you can head for the passage leading from the room at the end of the large hall.
Take care of the mercenaries then get ready for a truly evil puzzle. Head for the burner
which extinguishes as you approach. Jump and dive over the burner and into the tunnel
beyond avoiding the deadly spikes swinging back and forth. Turn and climb up to the ledge
and wait for the blades to roll past to the left then jump over the hole. The next burner
should turn off and you can run to the next passage. Climb up to the right ledge to spot
the door with the rolling blades between it and you.

Do a timed run into the door and obtain the Trapdoor Key then return to the hall with 
the rolling blades. Dodge the blades as you make your way to a small passage on your left
and trigger a blade trap. Make your way past both of the deadly blade traps to obtain

Secret #3; the Jade

Dragon before returning to the room where you obtained the last key. 

You should now be back in the room you drained earlier so use the Trapdoor Key to open
and enter. Climb up to find a switch which opens the double doors back near the statue
and lets in some mercenaries. Outside, you need to follow the trail until you find the
ladder behind the rocks to the left. Climb up and head for the bridge shooting the eagle
coming in from behind and the mercenary up ahead. Kill some crows after you go across the
bridge then make your way to the top of the building by using the well spaced ledges.
Enter to obtain Prayer Wheel #4. 

Now Lara needs to get back to the room where you obtained all the ammo by moving the 
boxes. You will pass by those double doors you opening a few minute ago so watch out for
the mercenaries you let in. You may get some assistance from the nearby Monks during this
fight. Enter the room with the boxes and take the passage. Grab when you start to fall 
in the trapdoor and you will catch onto a ladder. Climb up and continue down the passage
taking a right then a left then head up the stairs towards the window.

Mercenaries swarm in behind you so leap out of the window. Another Priest and two more 
Monks are down below so flip the switch on the wall to open the door. The Priest and 
Monks will go fight the mercenaries. Go help them out as they are seriously outnumbered.
When everyone is dead you can then climb the ladders up to Prayer Wheel #5.

Now that you have all five of the Prayer Wheels you can return to the statue room and go
to the room on the left. Use the Prayer Wheels on the sides of the large double door to
open a small door to a ramp which leads to the area where you can use the Seraph to open
the final door and exit this level.

                                Catacombs of the Talion




Head to the side of the stairs and grab the crack in the left wall and shimmy right until
you can pull up to obtain 

Secret #1; the Stone Dragon 

and some flares. Climb down the 
ladder and kill your first Yeti then flip the switch to open the door above. Climb back
up the ladder and slide then backflip to the ledge and kill the leopard.

Kill a pair of mercenaries as you head down the stairs and more leopards attack as you 
explore the area. Grab the medkit after you go through the open door. Your next quest is
sitting in that cage up above so run up the slope to trigger the snowballs. Dodge them as
you make your way to the ledge on the right then run across the floor which crumbles
beneath you and climb the ladder above the deadly spikes. Climb to the top and backflip
over to the switch which raises the cage and lets you take the Mask. The pool will now
drain and the floor opens up.

Go back down and jump the pit with the spikes and use the Mask next to the gate. As soon
as you arrive on the next slope, more snowballs start rolling towards you. Climb onto the
left wall to avoid the snowballs. Four leopards will now arrive to add to your 
excitement. There are more snowballs waiting to crush you should you decide to return to
the slope. Find the ladder which is to the right of the snowballs starting position and
climb it to reach a ledge with some grenades. You will need another Mask to continue up
here so instead return to the crack in the wall.

Four leopards surround you when you venture into the area past the crack. Continue
towards the glacier where more leopards challenge you. Climb the rocks to the left to 
discover a pool in which the second Mask lies. Mercenaries will be waiting for you as you
make your way back to the ledge where you obtained the grenades. Use the Mask and enter.

Four yeti are locked up in this room - that is until you flip the switch on the wall
which turns on the lights and opens the cages. These guys take a lot of ammo so just keep
plugging them with everything you've got. Use the stairs to your strategic advantage.
When they are all dead you can use the block to keep the bars open over by the switch.
Flip the switch and grab the grenades from the hall before returning to the crack in the
wall. More mercenaries are waiting. 

Head through the open door as more snowballs roll toward you. Make your way to the safe
zone over to the left of the rope bridge and the snowballs will roll past. Now you can
continue up and do a running jump to grab onto the ladder and climb to the top of the
glacier. Dive into the pool below and exit to the shore to avoid the barracuda and
frostbite. Continue into the next room and head left.

When you are standing on a ledge and getting ready to jump to the next turn and find the
ladder. Climb up and go right to drop onto a sliding ledge. Do a double jump to land on
a flat ledge where you can obtain 

Secret #2; the Jade Dragon. 

Jump to grab the ladder to return to the mission at hand. Continue across the pool and 
climb up the block near the door. Do a running jump to grab the bottom of the ladder and
climb to the top where you can jump back to land on a ledge with a switch. Flip it to 
open the door below then return to the ground and enter the door.

Dodge and attack the leopard which pounces from the left. When he is dead you can flip 
the switch to open the doors back where you used the first Mask. Now you need to go all 
the way back to those doors and enter. After you enter, do a running jump over the pit
and kill the leopards before you drop down to their former location. Flip the switch you
find here to open the doors and kill the last leopard when he arrives. Grab the items
from the corner before you head back up.

More snowballs lie ahead. Jump forward to send them rolling your way. Jump back then 
forward again to land on the other side of this minor trap. Another slope and more 
snowballs, but this time after you trigger them they will break through the door at the
bottom allowing you to enter. Stand on the left floor panel to open a door and carefully
enter this room.

This room is full of spikes so WALK when you enter. Right after you enter turn to the 
left and climb the textured wall surface to reach the ledge above which has 

Secret #3; the Gold Dragon.

Return to the floor and walk towards the door leading to the previous room. When it 
opens you need to jump through and land on the ramp. Jump forward over the snowballs to
trigger a floor panel which opens the door to the exit. Immediately jump back and do a
reverse roll and jump back into the room with the spikes. Make your way to the exit door
then do a running jump to reach the ladder which you can them climb down and enter the 
tunnel which leaves this level...

@node "H" "Ice Palace"



                                      Ice Palace




Shoot the bell to open the door which leads to several Yeti in cages. The floor has 
several springboards which will catapult Lara towards the ceiling. The small springboard
over to the right will launch Lara up to a ledge where you can obtain a medkit. Return to
the floor and line up with the springboard and the bell opening in the ceiling. Start
shooting as you leave the ground and hit the bell in midair top open one of the nearby
gates. When you land, you can grab the ledge to stop your slide.

Now run towards the open gate and hit the larger springboard. Grab in midair to hang onto
the ledge where you can pull up and grab the Uzi ammo before flipping the switch. This 
frees the Yeti which you can dispose of before continuing. A hole should be accessible 
now that the cages are down. Inside you can get a medkit and kill another Yeti before
flipping the nearby switch. In the narrow cage, find and pull the moveable block out 
then push it to once side. 

Secret #1; the Gold Dragon 

sits on a pillar if you have the nerve to take it. Don't bother trying to jump over to it
- a handy invisible bridge is already there. All you have to do is walk over and take it.

Return to the main cage room to find a new ledge which the last switch created. A small
springboard below will shoot you to the ledge so you can grab on and pull up. Another 
bell is up here and you need to jump and shoot it to open the remaining gate. Return
to the main floor by sliding down the ledge and hanging before you drop to avoid taking
damage. Go through the two open gates and spot the next springboard and the ledge above.

Head to the left so you can line up your approach to the springboard with the ledge.
When you launch you can grab the ledge and pull up and backflip over to a sliding ledge.
Continue to jump as Lara jumps back and forth between the two sloped ledges. Now make 
Lara jump to the right and continue jumping until you see another bell. Shoot the bell 
then start jumping to the left to return back to the flat area to the left.

to the locked door to find it is now open. Head up the ladder and get off on your left 
to do a running jump over to the walkway. Kill the Yeti that attacks from the left then
take the flares and continue until you reach some tigers. Kill them then light a flare to
locate 

Secret #2; the Stone Dragon,

which is hiding in the darkness. You can jump over the ramp to get it. Follow the ramp 
to the locked door on the right and head down the cave. Take the medkit on the left and 
follow the tunnel killing some more tigers before you finally obtain the Mask. Return
back to the previously locked door to find it is now open. Continue along the path and 
kill the Yeti when you drop down. Another Yeti waits for you below and you must shoot 
him through one of the holes.

Spikes line the floor over in the dark area so head over to the opposite end of the room
and grab the medkit. Now you need to examine the beams for one with a different texture.
When you find it, you need to hang and drop down into the center of that hole. Light a
flare to reveal a medkit and some ammo and there's even a place for your Mask over by the
window, outside on the ledge. With the Mask in place, head off to the right to find the
door that just opened in the dark area.

Head across the bridge and take the flares on your way up to the ledge with the switch.
Flip the switch to melt the ice and uncover the Gong Hammer. As you head towards the 
pool, two tigers attack. Kill them then go get the shells by the glacier and the Uzi
clips from the pool. Taking the hammer will release the barracuda so swim past it and 
into the next room where you can kill another Yeti then return to take the Gong Hammer.

Return to the area where you previously killed the three Yeti and kill a forth one 
approaching from the left. You can disarm the icicle by the door by pulling up and
dropping down from the side of the ramp. Kill another Yeti beyond that door and take the
Grenade Launcher if needed. Now you can head down the right passage to the Ice Palace.

There are some more snowballs beyond the opening ahead. The first two waves will roll 
past as you near the opening but you will need to jump back to avoid the third set after
you trigger it. Go through the opening and head off to the left as more snowballs coming
rolling toward you. Over to the right is a block which you can jump to and avoid the
snowballs.

Continue to a steep slope then slide down backwards so you can grab the edge and shimmy 
to the left until you are lined up with a ledge behind you. Pull up and jump back to 
land on the ledge then proceed to the next obstacle. The wall of ice can be climbed so
get a running start and jump and grab on then climb up to the cave above. Slide down the
steep slope which leads to the Palace. Make sure to hang before you drop to reduce the 
damage from the fall. The Gong awaits so get out your Gong Hammer and give it your best
shot.

The Palace doors should now be open, but before you enter, go get 

Secret #3; the Jade Dragon.

Head to the left of the Ice Palace and find the ladder. Climb down and head left. You'll
want to light a flare to see where you are going. Continue down to the second ledge and
flip the switch to open the hut which is just outside the Ice Palace. Climb back up the
ladder and return to the hut to get the final secret for this level.

You can now enter the Ice Palace and claim the big prize for this level - the Talion. Of
course every big prize has equally dangerous consequences and this one comes in the form
of the Guardian of the Talion; a giant wingless Eagle creature who appears after you have
claimed the Talion and try to leave the Palace.

This guy is pretty hard to kill. A dozen grenades should do the job nicely if you have 
that many and can aim them well. You can also use the hut for shelter if you need to 
heal yourself or something. If you are feeling "lucky" there are Uzi clips and a medkit
inside the Guardian's cave. Once the Guardian is dead your adventure continues....

@node "I" "Temple Of Xian"


                                    Temple of Xian




After you jump over the swinging blade you will find yourself sliding down a slope 
towards a waterfall. As you slide you need to jump and turn so you land and continue to 
slide backwards. Grab the ledge as you fall then shimmy to the left and pull up to claim

Secret #1; the Gold Dragon.

Don't ask me how you would have figured that out on your own. 

Now you can jump, dive or drop into the pool below. Eliminate the fish before you begin 
your exploration of the area. A medkit waits for you in a short underwater passage - 
everything else must wait. Exit the water over by the Temple Doors and claim the shells
on the left then go on a Tiger hunt as two of them are waiting to jump you over by the
stairs.

Head up the stairs and use the springboard to launch yourself to the room of the temple.
Go flip the switch on the other side of the roof to open a trapdoor above the ladder and
summon an Eagle. Kill the Eagle as you head for the trapdoor. Make sure to hang and drop
when leaving the roof to avoid unnecessary damage. Now you can climb the ladder and kill
that Spider before he gets too close.

Enter the large room and take the ladder down. At the bottom, drop and grab to cling to 
the ledge. Pull up and look down to see 

Secret #2; the Stone Dragon. 

Find and use the crack in the wall to shimmy right to get the dragon, then shimmy back 
to continue the adventure. Kill another spider as you near the red liquid then jump to
the ladder and climb up. You should soon arrive in a room with a pit full of spikes.

Go to the wall opposite the pit and climb up and over to the right. When you are against
the right wall do a backflip to land on a ramp then jump immediately to land on top of
the wall. Continue along the top of the wall until you can see the plank on the other
side. It's going to break away when you hit it so make sure to be standing on the portion
furthest from the wall when it does. Grab some shells from the block below then do a
running jump from the left of that block to land on a sliding slope. Jump again before
you hit the spikes to land on another ramp then jump again and turn to the right to land
on another slope which you can slide down to safety. Grab those grenades while your here
then climb up the large block and then onto the second before grabbing the ledge above.
Now shimmy along that ledge to the left until you can pull up and flip the switch to open
the main Temple Doors. The nearby path should lead you back to the waterfall and the
doors you just opened.

Only four of the eight statues in this room will attack and those are on proximity
triggers so if you keep your distance you won't have to mess with them. Grab the M-16 
ammo and head for the open door. You should now be on a ledge overlooking the room below
with the red liquid. Do a running jump and land on the first ledge and slide forward,
jumping when you reach the bottom to land on the next ramp. Slide and jump again then 
two more jumps to grab onto the ledge and pull up. Now you can climb the blocks and
continue around the top of the room doing one last running jump to grab and pull up to
reach the exit.

Continue down the short hall towards the switch. A trapdoor will open and you will fall 
in. After you get back up, immediately start running toward the switch as the walls start
to close in. Flip the switch to open the door behind you then do a reverse roll and head
for the door before the spiked wall gets you.

Continue down the passage until the first red rock comes rolling towards you. A quick 
jump back then to the left will send it rolling harmlessly past you. The second rock is
triggered when you near the top left corner of the ramp. The third blocks your way to the
ladder so you need to trigger it then avoid it before continuing up the ladder. At the 
top of the ladder is a very dark room so light a flare to check it out.

Flip the switch to the right of the exit then reverse roll to kill the tiger which is 
pounces from behind. Climb up into the open passage and head towards the blades. Face
away from the blades and go to the far left then drop and grab then drop again to land
out of striking range of the blades. More rolling blades block your way to the exit in 
the opposite corner so wait for them to leave you a gap then make a run for door.

You should now be up in some rafters and two Eagles aren't happy about that. Kill them 
then head for the button on the left wall. Pushing the button opens the doors at the
opposite end - but only for a short time so you need to push the button then do a
reverse roll then do a flawless series of running jumps across the rafters to get inside
before the door slams shut.

This next trap isn't too bad if you take your time. Simply follow the passage while 
staying on one side and watch the shadows of the swinging spikes. Get the timing down and
it's pretty easy. When you reach the other side you will be in a new hall with buttons on
either side. Press the right button which raises the floor then jump left and push that
button which opens the door. Start running to the right into the hall and keep on running
as the floor collapses. When you enter the next area a red metal ball drops down behind
you so keep on running to the end of the walkway and jump to grab and pull up to the 
ledge. On the platform beneath the statue is the Dragon Seal which opens the door back 
in the first room of this temple.

Now you can jump to the ledge to the right and climb the blocks to get some ammo and kill
another spider hiding in the dark room. You should find some more ammo and a switch,
which creates a bridge across that red liquid. Exit this area by going to the other side
of the statue's head. Jump across the series of ledges above the red liquid then do a
running jump to the sloped ledge in the center of the room. Jump and grab to hang from 
the block then pull up and slide down the other side and jump to the flat pillar. From 
here you can do another running jump to grab the ledge to the right near the wall. Pull 
up then do a running jump to the ledge next to the springboard.

Move to the center of the platform you are standing on and jump to the springboard to 
launch yourself to the high platform on the side of the tall structure. A boulder starts
heading your way as you land so jump back and grab the edge of the platform so the 
boulder rolls harmlessly overhead. Now you can make the climb to the top of the structure
by going from platform to platform. When another boulder comes headed your way just run 
to the white bricks and wait for it to pass.

From the white bricks, slide down and land on the springboard to launch up to the ledge
in the rafters. Do a running jump to grab and pull up to the next ledge which has

Secret #3; the Jade Dragon. 

Simply jump back to the structure from this ledge to resume the mission at hand.

Climb up to the platform where an Eagle attacks. Kill it, then jump and pull up to the 
next level then do a running jump to put yourself just one standing jump from the door.
Pull the box out two times and continue to the next room where you can flip the switch
to open the trapdoor and drop down to a long slope. The red metal ball from earlier is
now chasing you so head down and turn left until you reach the slide. The ball stops but
you don't as you slide down to the rafters above that first temple room. Below are some 
tigers, so kill them all before you drop down to use your Dragon Seal.

Follow the passage past this door avoiding the rolling blade until you arrive at a slide
which deposits you in a room with some switches. Only the green switches matter and all
three need to be flipped to open the door before the spiked ceiling impales you. Continue
on across the platforms until you reach the ledge above the pool with the fish. Kill them
from up here before you dive in.

Flip the underwater switch to raise the water level then head to the surface and enter 
the tunnel which was previously out or reach. Leave the lever on the left alone and 
continue down the right passage. You can take the medkit if you want, but unless you are
an expert at swimming you will have to return to the surface and catch your breath before
coming back. Since you probably already have several medkits, leave this one alone and 
continue down the tunnel until you can pull the lever. Swim back out and fill your lungs
before swimming back to the tunnel and go through the open door to find and pull another
level which opens a door back out in the main pool. Refill those lungs once more then 
dive down and go through the door you just opened and pull that lever. This opens the 
door above, behind which are M-16 clips and two boxes of shells.

Wade into the next room and flip the switch. Keep ahead of the moving spiked wall and 
fall through the trapdoor. The current should take you right to the Gold Key and the 
gate should open as you near it. You should end up back in the starting room at the base
of the falls. The key you just obtained fits the lock at the top of the ladder in this
room and opens the underwater gate also in this area.

Once the gate is open, continue down this passage heading right then take the right 
branch of the fork. Swim through the grating and head for the left wall. The lever you
seek is behind the second pillar so pull it to open the exit to this area and clear the
path to the Silver Key. A Fighting Fish should be attacking now (or very soon). Kill him
but don't waste too much air as you can always out-swim him. Continue around the pillar
to find the exit and head that way. When you reach the fork, take the other passage this
time and swim up into the door you just opened and into the cave. Climb onto the ledge
and if you haven't done so already - kill that fish!

This area is infested with spiders so eliminate all you encounter. Some Uzi clips are 
near that giant spider web, as are more spiders. When you reach the large cave there are
even more giant spiders to deal with. Kill them all then start making your way up the
ledges until you can do a running jump to the pillar in the center of the cave. Now you 
can do another running jump to grab and pull up to the pillar by the door. Jump and grab
and pull up to the passage and follow it to the next area. From that end of the passage,
do a running jump and grab and pull up to the pillar in the center of the rocks. The 
Silver Key rests on the tallest rock. Get the key then return to the water and swim back
to the main Temple doors. You key opens the only remaining door in this area.

Continue through this last door an jump and pull up to continue up the slope. Dodge the 
red balls as they roll down the slope. When you reach the top, get the ammo then head
left and cross the bridge killing a Tiger and an Eagle along the way. A second Tiger
waits on the other side of the bridge so kill him before climbing up onto the sloped 
pillar. Jump back onto the next taller ledge and a fork in the path. Take the path with
the rolling blade by doing a double jump as the blade starts heading for the opposite end
of the platform above. Then go left and slide down the slope backwards so you can grab 
on as you fall off. Get on the ladder and climb down to the next ledge and hang and drop
down to the next one to get some Uzi clips before dropping through the nearby hole to 
return to the front of the Temple.

Return to the fork and get past the rolling blade once more and head for the room with a
bridge and another rolling blade. Get some Uzi clips and the medkit then run across the 
bridge with the blade in hot pursuit. Head towards the button on the left once you get
across to avoid the blade. Press the button to open a door at the end of the passage you
haven't been to yet leading from the fork. Now get the timing down on the rolling blade
and make another run across the bridge, through the room and back to the fork and take 
the other direction.

This passage has a some springboards which must be done in a certain sequence. Stand with
your back to the first and do a backflip onto it to launch up to the rest of the 
springboards. When the ride is over you need to kill another Eagle before jumping and
pulling up to the ledge in front of you. The doors should be open so enter.

Continue until you can jump to the square ledge near the lock. Jump to the left box then
quickly climb up the ladder as the spiked wall closes in. Drop down to the ledge on the
right then start running and jump from the ledge over to the ladder and climb up to avoid
another spiked wall. Continue until you find a switch which opens one of the gratings you
walked past only moments ago. Return to the opening to see the Main Chamber Key resting
on top of a pillar. Get the key then begin a somewhat fun slide down the curving slope
around this pillar to the floor.

Continue on to end up on a pillar near the door you opened with the button earlier. Jump
over to the lock and use the key which will raise a metal grating next to a pillar. Turn
and do a running jump and grab and pull up to go in that direction. Climb the ladder and
exit towards the spikes on the right. Jump over the spikes and keep climbing the ladder
and ignore the switch on the right. You should now be back in the area where you found
the Main Chamber Key. A second grating is now open and there is a second and taller
pillar you need to reach, so go through the open grate and head left to do a running jump
and grab and pull up to get on the ledge. You'll reach a slope that sends you sliding 
toward the pillar with the serpent so jump as you begin to slide to reach the pillar.
After a short slide down the serpent you will reach a flat area next to a ladder.

Climb the ladder until you reach the blade then do a jump back to the sloped surface then
forward again to regain another ladder above the blade. Climb this until you reach
another blade. A ladder is behind you this time so you need to jump back and twist in
midair and grab onto the new ladder. Continue the climb and make a short sideways jog to
the right to finish the trip to the top where you can finally exit this level...

@node "J" "Floating Island"



                                   Floating Islands



This is it - the final level of the game. The enemies get tougher so load your weapons 
and let's get started. You are greeted by a Warrior who is flying in from the right.
Warriors are very dangerous when they get close enough to fight you, but the catch is
they are super-slow in getting close to you. Use this to your advantage and kill them 
before they ever get close enough to fight.

In fact, you can usually use your pistols to kill these slow moving targets and save 
your bigger and better ammo for those who deserve it.

Kill the Warrior then get the medkit over to the left then head for the other end of the
island. The first of two Mystic Plaques you need to advance is below you on another small
island. Step back and do a running jump to the slope on the next island. When you land
you will slide forward so go about halfway down the slope then jump again to reach the
next slope and follow up with another jump to the next island. Grab onto the edge of the
opening by the large gold structure and pull up to find a switch which opens a trapdoor
on another island.

Continue along the hall and slide down the ramp, jumping from the bottom to land on 
another slope on the next island with that trapdoor you just opened. Three Xian Guards
are on duty. The first attacks when you arrive. It's best to only have to fight these 
guys one at a time so try not to wake up the next one until the first is dead. These guys
are fast and deadly so kill them quick and dodge their attacks. The second guard wake up
when you advance towards the front of the island.

Jump and pull up through the trapdoor to wake the third guard below when you step on the
raised platform inside. You can try to kill him through the trap door but it may take 
awhile. Get the first Mystic Plaque, some flares, Uzi clips and a medkit before dropping
back down to finish off the last guard (if you already didn't). Now look for a flat rock
over by the tree. Jump and pull up to the roof to get 

Secret #1; the Jade Dragon. 

Head for the other side of the island opposite where you arrived and do a hang, drop and
grab to reach the ledge below which has a switch that opens the exit.

Do a running jump to the exit then another running jump to the next island. Head to the 
other end of that island and jump to the left to reach the rocks above. You should be
able to see an island that resembles some stairs so head off in that direction and do a
running jump to grab and pull up. Pull up two more times to reach the first step then 
climb all the steps to the top. Head right and do another running jump to another 
stairway. Turn and go up the stairs killing the Warrior you meet about halfway up. His 
friend comes to life when you reach the top of the steps so kill him too.

When the steps end head to the left above the door and jump to the first slope you landed
on when you jumped from the first island. This time do a running jump and slide and grab
to hang from the bottom of the slope. Drop to the ledge below then do a running jump to 
reach the island with the second Mystic Plaque. Another running jump should having you
grabbing on to the right of the crest on the nearby island where you can do another jump
to the large island where you obtained the other Plaque. Continue back to the foot of 
the green stairs by the door where you use the two Plaques.

You need to jump to the platform in front of the doors you open with the Plaques. You 
start this jump from a sloped ledge with a tricky "take off" point. As you do the
running jump and grab manuever you've done hundreds of times before, make sure you are 
angled to the left otherwise you will run right off the ledge and into oblivion. When you
do land in front of the doors, grab the Uzi ammo and use the Plaques and enter the door.

A Warrior approaches from below and to the left. Take evasive action as necessary and
pelt this guy with pistol fire until he dies. You should be able to spot 

Secret #2; the Stone Dragon 

from the bridge. It is on the left in a small opening behind the tree on the other side 
of the bridge. If you stand with your back to that opening then step to the left as far
as you can then step back as far as you can then jump backwards you will land in the
tunnel that takes you to your prize. Getting back out of here is just as tough. Stand on
the flat surface to the right of the opening and with your back to the wall and jump to 
land just above the sloped surface. One last jump should take you out of the tunnel and 
back to the tree by the bridge.

Stand one step away from the green boulder and face away. Backflip onto the rock and do
another backflip to end up sliding so grab on and hang from the edge as the boulder goes
rolling by Drop down and get the medkit and kill another Warrior. Enter the building and
climb onto the sloped green block then jump from the high part of the slope to grab and
pull up to the roof. Keep going until you can pull up into a passage in the sandy rock 
and follow it to return to the bridge.

Now return to the slope where you triggered the green boulder and slide down again - 
this time forward so you can jump to the slope across the gap. Continue up that ramp 
until you can see some bricks. Head right and do a running jump and grab to pull up onto 
the next island. The rope slide begins here so begin the ride but make sure to drop off
as you pass over the lower bridge.

Another Xian Guard comes to life when you enter the building on the lower level. Two more
guard the switch which opens the door at the end of the rope slide. Kill all three then 
flip the switch then enter the next room and take the rope slide to the other wall. Make
sure you grab as you leave the slide or you will be up to your ponytail in hot lava.
Climb up then across the gold structure and continue to the right. Grab onto the green
ledge and shimmy left and drop down.

Now your path should be clear, so follow it back to the top of the first rope slide 
which has conveniently reset itself. Grab and don't let go until the entire ride is over.

You are now in a hall with two rooms leading off. Both rooms are death traps so stick to
the hall. From one side of the hall, jump to the area to the right of the room where you
can see a block. Touching the block summons a Warrior who appears near the open door you
just slid through. Kill him then move the block so you can jump up then climb up to the
ledge. A switch which creates a bridge over the lava is waiting to be flipped on that
pillar, then you can pull up to the stone wall by the lava and get some M-16 clips.

To avoid those blades, hang and drop down the two steps in the right corner then jump to
the bridge and flip the switch to open the trapdoor. Return to the wall and get ready for
a tricky jump. Do a running jump towards the trapdoor and grab while in midair. Grabbing
will change the arc of your jump so you can sail right into the trapdoor. Stock up on
shotgun shells when you land then continue to the end of the room and flip the switch to
open a trapdoor back in the main room.

Return to the pool and dive down to find a tunnel leading off to the left. Follow it 
into the larger room and surface to one side to avoid the blades overhead. There is a
switch above the passage here which turns off the swinging blades allowing your to get
back to the large lava room and go through that door you just opened. Push the box over
to the pillar by that door then climb up and jump into the door. You will have to alter
your arc again as the ceiling is quite low here.

In this hall is a door and the switch is above the room with the spikes in the floor.
Jump forward and grab to catch the crack and shimmy left to pull up. When you are done a
running jump towards the left edge of the opening will bring you back to the hall. Now
you can enter the room to find two more sealed doors and another Xian Guard who doesn't
even wake up. Drop into the hole in the floor and grab on at the bottom to slow yourself.

Things turn nasty when you drop into a cage with four Xian Guards and four Ninja. Flip 
the switch then reverse roll and head back to the ledge and pull up on either side of
the pillar. Behind the pillar go either right or left until you can see the cage then 
start taking shots at the Ninja below. When they return your fire, use the pillar for 
cover and attack from the opposite side. All four will eventually die leaving you with 
only Xian Guards to deal with. Since they only wake up when you get too close, you can 
fight these guys one at a time. After you wake each guard, return to the top of the wall
and take care of them from there. They can't reach you so they can't hurt you. Repeat 
until all guards are dead then drop down to collect your booty; shells, Uzi clips, and
medkits of various sizes.

Finally, flip the two switches which open the exit out of here and unseals one of the 
doors above.

When you enter that opened door above, you are attacked by a Ninja hiding in the dark 
stairway. When he is no longer a problem, continue up the stairs to a closed door and a
switch. The switch opens the door and awakens two more Xian Guards. When all is clear,
head through the door and climb to the top of the latticework. Jump off and twist in 
midair to grab the latticework behind you. Climb up and then pull up to the slope and 
jump backwards. Continue to jump as you bounce back from side to side. Start moving to 
the left as you jump to end up on a flat area with a Ninja. Kill him then find the 
moveable box.

Pull out the box and climb on and jump over to the rocks on the left. Head over to the 
ledge on the right and jump across the lava into the square depression. Turn and do a
running jump into the tunnel under the ledge to claim 

Secret #3; the Gold Dragon

and final secret of Tomb Raider 2.

Another running jump will take you out of this tunnel and leave you grabbing the edge 
next to that square depression. Pull up and jump back to the ledge then return to the box
and push it so you can reach the rope slide. Grab on and ride to the final battle...

@node "K" "The Dragon's Lair"


                                   The Dragon's Lair




When you land, snatch up the medkit and Uzi clips before advancing past a non-active 
Xian to take on the first of several active Xian Guards. When he is dead you may proceed
to the next room where two more Xian Guards stand in complete stillness. There are two
switches by the first inactive guard. The one next to him opens the door and activate the
two guards in that room while the one opposite his position is a trap and does nothing
other than wake him up. Flip the exit switch and take care of the two guards on your way
out.

In the next room is a small army of Ninja hiding behind the pillars. Tease them so they
follow your out into the previous room where you can dispose of them at your discretion.
The Ninja in the rear of this room are not as easily fooled and you will have to fight 
them on their turf. When all are dead you should find a Mystic Plaque that one of them 
was carrying. Use it to open the large sealed door and enter to meet the Dragon.

This Dragon is pretty hard to kill but if you take your time and plug away at him and 
take plenty of evasive action it shouldn't be anymore challenging that some other parts
of this game. Here are some strategic tips which may prove useful:


   Use your most powerful weapons first and work your way down - duh.
   If he "lights you up" use the water to extinguish the flames.
   Lots of ammo and medkits are underwater. Use as needed.
   Use the pillars to slow down the dragon and provide cover.
   Make reversing strafing runs on the dragon. He can't turn very fast.

Once the Dragon is down you need to run up to him and take the Dagger from his belly.
With the dagger in your possession, the Dragon is defeated and in the grand tradition of
all big endings, his lair begins to self-destruct. Run through the open gate and out the
tunnel to the end of the level. The adventure is over and it's time to head for home...

                                      Conclusion




Well, you thought the adventure was over. Seems some
bad buys have come to pay you a visit - or maybe they
just wanted to use your obstacle course. Either way,
they're trespassing so use the Gun Cabinet Key on the
lock by your bed to arm yourself then go start
eliminating the bad guys. When you've cleaned up the
house head outside and clean up the yard. Find anyone
lurking in the shadows by eliminating the shadows with
some flares. You'll eventually kill the boss then return
to your house for a nice hot shower.


Here are some links to the text above which will assist you in locating and
solving those Secret Areas.
