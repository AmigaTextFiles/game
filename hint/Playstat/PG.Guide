 9) Blitzkrieg questions

 1) NORWAY
 main tip #1 - consolidate your navy to the west
 Immediately! and move it north.  hit and run, just
 like the nazi's did in real life
 main tip #2 - don't buy bombers, buy fighters!.  you should
 be starting with enough prestige to
 buy two or three fighters the first turn

 tip #3 - land on the beach south of oslo and south of
 the airfield in the SW corner of norway.  take these ASAP!
 you'll need oslo for prestige and the airfield to
 establish air superority.

 That's the thing, you must have 3 or 4 fighters and make wait
 your JU88's until the BF109's have cleared their bombers.

  Also the cities in the south/center are easy to take. The one in the
 north is the problem because of the ship's fire. Hit the units around
 this city with tanks, because the ship's make on them much less hurt
 than to the artillery/infantry.

 In my opinion, your air force is the key in this battle.  Spend most or 
 all of your prestige on level bombers and fighters.  Bring the ships you 
 have up top down to join with the rest of your navy.  You need your whole 
 navy and a couple of level bombers to defeat the allied navy.  

 I didnt use any air force units agains the allied navy.
 At the beginning I used only two ground unit to conquer the city in the
 upper left. Here I build a air defense unit as soon as possible to shoot
 down allied aircrafts which will attack.
 I retreat with my navy slowly in direction to this city (hit and run).
 I am losing all my large ships at the beginning but in most cases youll 
 keep some destroyers (important) and most important your submarines.
 Always attack destroyers first (only threat for submarines).
 I try to join the rest of the navy as fast as possible. 
 Nevertheless, air supremacy is the key to victory in this scenario.
 I use my bombers and fighters in the south: first destroy norwegian
 fighters and then protect my bombers from incoming british fighters and
 shoot down incoming british bombers. I always try to get the fighters
 first.
 I used my paratroopers to get the first two undefended cities in 
 the valley.

 Remember that the AI is using its prestige to create new units to defend
 strategic goals or (too rarely) to mount counterattacks, same as you do.
 In the example, the AI used a non-objective city that was not under attack
 to stage forces for a counterattack on units it was a able to see. Perhaps
 the first time you had taken that city, or the AI hadn't spotted your
 units. IOW, the AI will react differently depending on what you do, and
 plays by the same rules you do.
 
 Strategy tips/spoilers follow:

 I've found it fairly easy to blow through Norway and get a major victory 
 by initially placing all my core units in the Northern placement area and 
 taking the Northern cities first.  Use the Luftwaffe airborne to capture 
 one city down south (they start unoccupied) and build a couple HW infantry 
 to take the Southern objective and then cruise with those units to the 
 West to take the Western objective.  You'll find you can land all your 
 ground units in the first two turns taking minimal losses up North from 
 planes and take the Northern objectives without suffering too badly.

 As for the British Navy, move all your ships (except maybe the furthest 
 removed) Cruiser and Destroyer which can come in handy taking the southern
 objectives) North as fast as you can without stopping along the way.  
 Especially your Battleship which typically arives just about in time to 
 see the last of your navy totally wiped out but all the Britsh ships 
 damaged to the point where they don't pose much of a threat to your 
 Battleship.

2) FRANCE

  1) What is a feasible strategy for gaining a major in France? Remember,
     it needs to be accomplished in 13 turns.
     I have yet to get a major there, so I can't respond to this question.

 You CAN get a major in France, and without too much difficulty.  Paris
 seems to be the key.  Blow away the French airforce while moving all your
 ground units to Paris (SAVE YOUR PRESTIGE) Once you take Paris use the
 prestige to buy any new units you would like and split in to 3 main battle
 groups.  The largest group (by far) should take the two easternmost cities
 while the other groups take two cities apiece.  Pound the French with your
 tac especially the tanks and you should come out with a Major.

 1) Make sure you go in with with your core maxed out, even if it is
 with PzJags.
 2) Attack in three groups, one down the coast, one towards Paris and
 one on the extreme southern flank. This latter group has to drive
 forward like crazy, bypassing resistance at every opportunity to
 press on.
 3) Use your paras/airmobile infantry to seize airfields and cities
 in-land.
 4) Gain air-superiority ASAP.
 5) Guard your initial victory city from sneaky British counter-attacks.

 In other words, pretty much what you do in all the other Blitzkrieg

 Getting major in France is not that hard. Get yourself 4 fighters, 4 tac 
 bombers, 5 PzIVD tanks, 4 15sFH 18 Artilleries on halftracks, 2-3 bridge 
 engineers, anyone should be able to do it. The key is focusing on the 
 objectives and keep moving. Use the main force to take Paris first. Send 
 2 tanks, 1 bridge, 1 artl, 1-2 tac bomber to the coastal objectives, 
 while the main force is attacking Paris. Use your tac to attack French 
 heavy tanks. Use your tank to protect other units from being attacked by 
 those tanks. Use your 3-range powerful artilleries to the full extent. 
 You will get your majors.

 I found it _really_ helped to use paratroopers and/or air transport in
 this one. Send them deep into the rear cities, and land them in close
 to objective cities.  They don't conquer anything (although, if they can,
 it's really nice if they can conquer an airfield), they just 'pin' the city
 and keep it from getting reinforcements until the cavalry arrived.
 This really helps keep the French from making huge defensive positions 
 around those rear cities.
  
 How do you keep the Hurricanes and assorted French fighters from tearing
 your level bombers to shreds in the first two-three rounds? I was
 doing ok until I hit Paris, now I can't win for losing...
  
 Keep your bombers adjacent to your fighters, and send two fighters after
 every enemy plane until none are left. Then your bombers can range at
 will.

 3) EMBARK/DEBARK TROOPS AND PARATROOPERS

 Assuming they're paratroopers, just click on the same icon you used to
 embark them on the plane in the first place (the one with the ship on it).
 The hexes that they can land on are now highlighted on the map. Click on a
 hex and they'll try to jump onto it (but they might drift).

 If they're not actual paratroopers (other infantry or light artillery
 units), you have to land on an unoccupied airfield and disembark on the
 next turn.

 ======================
 4) TROOP REPLACEMENTS

 While playing a campaign and finishing a battle, if a unit is not at full 
 strength, the unit gets at full strength for the beginning of the next 
 battle. My question is whether
 the unit is filled with elite or normal replacements? That is, there is 
 no reason for me to waste my prestige in getting elite replacements at 
 the end if the game will give me elite replacements equivalent for the 
 beginning of the next seige.

 If you are bringing rear line units up to normal strength near the end
 of a scenario, you are wasting prestige.  These units will come up to full
 strength with elite troops at the end of the scenario for free.  Now, if
 you're trying to go overstrength, that's a different story.

 This is a correct analysis.  If you purchase units in one campaign and 
 don't have any core units left, then this unit will be made up of auxillary
 units which will not continue to the next campaign with you. Somewhat 
 dissapointing I know, but that is the way it is!  Just keep an eye on the 
 available core units and buy units (unless desperate) only when you have
 enough core points. My experience is that it takes just one core
 point/unit.

 5) DISBANDING UNITS

 Nothing is wrong.  When you disband a unit their gone, they don't give 
 you any money for it.
 You don't get the prestige back!  The only reasons I can think of for
 disbanding a unit are to create room in your core for something else 
 (assuming your core is maxed out) or to eliminate a 1 or 2 strength unit
 that will face certain elimination, thus denying the prestige gains to 
 the enemy.  But I always choose to let the low stength unit die I'd rather
 let the enemy waste their time killing that crippled unit than have them
 take a full crack at a nearby full-strength unit.

 No you don't get prestige when you disband units.  But, don't feel bad.
 A number of people got the same impression when reading that portion of 
 the rule book.  I believe it says something about disbanding units allows
 you to get new units, which a lot of people assumed meant that you get 
 prestige to do so. What this statement actually meant was that, if you 
 were already at the max allowable number of units, and you disband a unit,
 you will now be at less than the max allowable number and can therefore 
 buy more.
   The only real advantage to disbanding a unit is to prevent the opponent 
 from getting the prestige from destroying it.


6) BOMBERS

 Level bombers are great. You need one or two. Use them when you 
 take victory hexes. Start the turn with the level bomber. It will
 probably only reduce the garrason with one, but the rest will stay
 supressed for the rest of the turn. After the level bomber, a few 
 artillery shots and one or two infantry atacks will do the job.
 Last nigth I got France in 13 turns using this technique.

 Also very useful to destroy enemy ships and to weaken
 fortifications, because suppressed units remain supressed for
 one turn. If you bomb a fortification and then attack with a ground
 unit the fortification will surrender (very often).

 7) JETS

 I just won my first camaign after winning a victory in hungary, This was 
 somtime in 1945. What I'm wondering is why did i never recieve any of 
 the jet fighters? At the end of my campaign the newest figter availabe to 
 me was the fw190 dora-9 according to the manual i believe the first  jets 
 are supposed to come out in 1944 but they never showed up in my game.Does 
 any one know what might have caused this? Is there Something specific you 
 must achieve before getting the advanced tech units?

8) BEST PBEM SCENARIO

 I would rate the scenarios that I've played PBEM like this:
 Husky         (favors Allies)
 
 I see we differ on how we would rate the Husky scenario. In my
 game the Allied player completely dominated and was able to win the
 game several turns early. With massive use of airpower & seapower 
 the German player was never able to mount much resistance. How did 
 your game go?
 
 In the scenario I played the German player opted for a strong northern 
 defense of the mainland, using his starting prestige to purchase a couple 
 of extra FW-190a fighters that were able to combine with the 3 he already 
 had to establish air superiority in the north since the Allies never had 
 a northern base from which to operate their more numerous but shorter 
 range and less effective fighters. 

 I think this is the key to this scenario. I've only played against the
 computer, which isn't saying much, but if the the Axis can get air
 superiority in the North he's in good shape. I sent my two Italian planes
 up North to help out. Also made sure the Allies couldn't get the Northern
 airbase and sent a JU88a against his fleet. As for the ground war, I just
 bought a dozen of those 12 point Italian tank destroyers and clogged up all
 of Sicily with them, though I don't know if this'll work against a human
 player.

9) BLITZKREIG QUESTIONS

 In France and Kiev (at least), the scenario instructions tell me
 that the sooner I win, the better, with respect to future battles.
 
 APART from having to win fast enough to get a Major victory, is there
 any benefit to winning even quicker? If I have to win by turn 10, say,
 to get a Major, is there any benefit to winning on turn 6 instead of
 turn 9?

 I think you'd actually be better off waiting until the last turn that you 
 can still get a major.  You can build up more prestige as well as pumping 
 up your units to overstrength and dinking away at some of the last 
 computer units to get some more experience for your rookies.
