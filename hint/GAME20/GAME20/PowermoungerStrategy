     POWERMOUNGER  -  STRATEGY TIPS  (Amiga Action & World magazines)

OBTAINING PROVISIONS

    After each victory, remember to search the village or town you have just
taken, as more often than not, suplies are bountiful. Sheep can be found
wandering the hillside and once caught, can be used to feed your hungry 
troops.
	Apart from that, the only other way to collect provisions is to farm the
land. First off, equip your men with the likes of ploughs and boats. Once
this is done, some will grow crops while the others will take to the water
and fish. Remember to keep stocks high during the winter or after long
force-marches.

ATTACKING VILLAGES

    One obvious strategy to adopt is to have more men in your army than your
opponent! This means that massed crowds could make easy meat of the unskilled
warriors and the village would soon be won. However, what do you do if the
enemy's numbers are greater or more skilled than yours?
    A good option is to first form an alliance with the town tou are about to
attack. This then allows you to walk freely about the town without arousing
suspicion. Assemble your men in the square before attacking. This will catch
your opponent off guard and, if all goes well, he won't be able to react with
his guards quick enough. Attack too soon, and his troops will have time to
rally and meet your offensive.
   Both cannons and catapults are useful engines of war, as they enable your
forces to aattack from a greater distance. However, they are rather bulky and
will therefore considerably reduce your marching speed.

BUILDING EQUIPMENT

   It is all very well inventing new weapons or equipment, but the process
is slow and sometimes the results are poor. Some objects require metal to be
mined, so a mine must be constructed first of all. Once again, this can
prove to be quite a lengthy ordeal before the effects become beneficial.
   It is a good idea to attack a village that already has a mine and then
use the forging facilities for your own use, to manufacture swords and the
like.

ALLIANCES

   In the early stages of the game, the enemy leaders will consist of
Harold II, Jos XVIII and Jayne III. These Powermoungers are very warlike,
and will often attack each other, leaving their force weak after a battle
and open to attack. However, it is also highly possible that they will
choose to form an alliance against your army, especially if you are more
powerful.
   Providing you choose the correct moment (when you are strong and he is
short of men), an enemy will be pleased to form an alliance with you, 
allowing you to share his supplies. More likely than not, he'll take goods
from your stocks in return, and the alliance will remain until either side
takes on a hostile act.

SPYING MISSIONS

   Only leaders can participate in these missions, and it is very dangerous
trying to infiltrate an opponent you are already at war with. It is much
better to use a second expendable leader to do the mission. Once accepted he
will relay information on the enemy.

RECRUITING

   If you wish to employ more men in your army, try to locate a band of
discontented people searching for military service.
   Before an attack, it is best to switch to passive posture. During the
attack, your men will wander around aimlessly, slaying people anybody nearby.
After a few seconds of skirmishing, change to aggresive. Your troops will
try to kill the remaining survivors as quickly as possible.
   Now highlight the GET Men icon. Your troops should now search the sur-
rounding areas for hidden villagers. If necessary, leave this command select
for a minute or two, as the recruits further away will take longer to
regroup.

POSTURE

   The posture rating will detwermine how your troops will react to given
situations. In combat, a passive posture will have your men attempt to 
capture the enemies rather than mindlessly slay them. Using an aggresive
posture will probably kill every opponent outright, whereas a neutral
position will fall somewhere between the two.
   A passive posture will allow your troops to invent harmless items such
as pots, ploughs, even boats. However, if aggresive is selected, they'll
create powerful weapons of war: bows, pikes, cannons and catapults being
the most common.
______________________________________________________________________

   The territories in the upper-right and lower-left corners of the initial
selection screen call for a different strategy from the usual village
pillaging. In the upper-right land, you're overmatched from the start by
aggresive bowmen from a neighboring island. Fight, and you're breakfast.
Hang around and you're lunch. Time to wage guerilla war. Conquer the village
to the south, if only to get your hands on their supply of food and man-
power. (If you don't your enemy will.) Equip the three boats you'll find
around the town.
   Run. (Do not, however, derank your army.) Head for the big island with
your two men. Find stray sheep to suplement your diet, and as many boats
that you can carry, and you'll find that somehow your stranded army is
migrating to you in drips and drabs. You're still outgunned. Hit the
village in the southwest corner of the island and use it to build weapons-
just in case you happen to encounter the enemy army (which will be hunting
you). Once you are satisfied, move northeast to take the main town. That
will enable you to build a catapult. At this point you have won the arms
race: you can handle the deatils from there.
   The trouble in the lower-left land isn't so much enemy aggression as
that there's no easy mark nearby that you can exploit without interruption.
The island is wholly occupied by Blue Suits, the towns are closely spaced,
and they come to each other's defense with dispatch. You take a town only
to be attacked without pause. Watch troop movements and find a town that
isn't going to be visited soon. (Arrange to arrive once the homeboys are
out of sight.) I used the northernmost town, so as to have my back to the
sea. Make bows for as long as you can. Eventually the enmy will show up -
ton of them - but you'll be ready to mow them down. Then you can capture
the island at your leisure.
