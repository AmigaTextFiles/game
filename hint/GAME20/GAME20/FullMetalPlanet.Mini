                          FULL METAL PLANET


   The object of the game is to take off the planet with the most points.
Each piece of ore returned to the frieghter is worth 2 points and each unit
is worth 1 point.  Ore can be loaded onto barges, crabs, and weather
hens(the units that can build other units with the ore).  You only get one
weather hen and cannot build any more.  At the beginning of the game you
place your frieghter on the map and on the second turn you deploy the units
you want to at that time.

    On the third turn press the colored bar under the clock three times to
display your options.  The second number is the amount of movement turns you
have left.  After turn 5 all players recieve 15 points per turn unless they
have captured another frieghter, when they get 5 bonus points added to thier
regular income.

Barges   - can carry units or ore and load and unload.
Crabs    - can carry two things at one time.
Hens     - can carry one thing at a time.
Pontoons - cannot move on thier own, used to cross water or marshes.

Destroying units - To destroy an enemy unit you need to have two of your
armed units within two spaces(tanks, boats and freighters).  Press the
lightning bolt icon and then on one of your units and on the one you want to
hit and then your other unit and then on the enemy unit again.  Supertanks
can fire three spaces and tanks and boats two.  Tanks on mountains can fire
three spaces.  If two tanks next to each other and both of them are on
mountains you will be penalized.  Units cannot move into the fire zones of
two enemy units.  If they are caught there they may be neutralized.  Use the
bottom right icon to retreat if possible.

Capturing units - two of your units must be next to the enemy unit to
capture it.  Use the left icon in the middle row to capture it.

The top middle icon is used to pick up ore and to drop things in the
freighter and to take them out of the freighter.

The left icon in the top row is used to move.  Press it on your unit and
then move the mouse to view the available directions to move.

The bottom left icon is used to repair the turrents on captured freighters.

To end your turn press twice on the timer.

Hold down the r key to view the score.

At turn 21 you will be asked if you want to take off.  If you don't you will
have to wait until turn 25.

Before you take off move your ore and units back to your freighter to bring
them along.
