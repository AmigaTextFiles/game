                   Original manual supplied by DJW.


NOTE: This document contains the full key guide, most of the technical
supplement and a players guide, including setting up the car.  This is
all you need to play the game 100%, although the maps of the tracks
would be useful also, watch out for those from LSD soon!

The Technical Supplement Bit.
-----------------------------

        Installation on Floppy Disks.
It is recommended that you copy the 4 disks supplied in the package
before play. Copies are for your personal use only. (So no copying, you
naughty pirates out there!).

        Pirates note: the first disk of the 4 is an intro only, so you
can throw it away and boot from disk 2!  Look out for the 2 disk
version from TFC!

        Installation on a Hard Disk.
Boot up your hard disk as normal and insert disk 4. Open this disk and
double-click on the "INSTALL" icon. Please follow any on-screen
prompts. A drawer called "Grand Prix" will be created on your hard
disk containing all necessary files.

        Loading from Floppy Disks.
If your computer has Kickstart in ROM, insert Disk 1 into the internal
drive and power up the computer. The program will then auto-load.
If your computer does not have Kickstart in Rom, load Kickstart as
normal, then insert Disk1 into the internal drive. The program will
then auto-load.

        Loading from a Hard Disk.
Boot up your hard disk as normal. Open the "Grand Prix" drawer and
double-click on the "Game" icon.

        Saved Games.
You may save games currently underway and recontinue them at a later
date. Follow any on-screen prompts. If the game was booted from floppy
disk, you will be asked to insert your previously formatted Save Game
disk before selecting a lost to save to. If the game was booted from
hard disk, you will simply be asked to choose a slot to save to.
Whenever you quit the game you will be invited to save your current
position.

        Loading a Save Game.
Saved games can only be loaded during the pre-game options. To load a
saved game choose "Load a Saved Game" option when you start the game.
Please follow the on-screen prompts.



        The Playing the Game bit.
        -------------------------

        Setting the Car Up.

You begin any practice or timed/qualifying session in the pit lane.
From here you can choose to drive straight away with the current Set-
Up, or change any of the car settings. You can also drive into the
pits at any time during practice to change your car Set-Up.

For the Rookie driver the car Set-Up will seem very complex at first.
Do not worry! Accept the current Set-Up, learn to drive fast around
the circuits, then return to this section and adjust the settings. Do
not adjust more than one setting at a time before trying it out in a
practice session. That is when you will notice the difference in
performance!

Each of the 16 circuits is unique so it's necessary to Set-Up your
Formula One car with the correct combination of Wing, Gear Ratios,
Brake Balance and Tyres. You are advised to study the track layouts in
this manual (pages 67 to 99) and take note of all the track notes and
summaries; these will give you an indication of the type of car Set-Up
required but there is no substitute for experience. Try a few laps
with various settings, get an idea of how the car is running thru
corners and along straights. Compare your performance with other cars
in practice, go into the pits and adjust a setting then try again.

If you are having problems with your car Set-Up and are finding it
difficult, for example, to drive into corners please consult the Set-
Up Problem chart at the end of this chapter.

    Front/Rear Wing Downforce Adjust.
In general terms the wings on a Formula One racer push the car down on
the track. This achieves more grip and less roll giving better control
in corners but less speed on the straights because of drag.
You can adjust the amount of front and rear wing used by the car. This
is on a scale from 1 to 64. The higher the number, the more Downforce.
Adjust the wing front and back by selecting +/-.

    Front/Rear Brake Balance.
Grand Prix cars have a low centre of gravity, centred just behind the
driver. If you brake hard at speed the weight shifts onto the front of
the car. Therefore brakes must be balanced to cope with the transfer
of weight during deceleration (slowing down).
You can change the brake balance of your car by altering the way in
which the front and rear brakes are applied. It's always best to have
more brake bias at the front than the rear. Ideally, as soon as the
front wheels begin to feel the effect of the brakes, the rear wheels
should just be beginning to slow down.
The scale goes from 32 at the Rear to Zero in the middle to 32 at the
Front. Move the slider to give the correct degree of balance.

    Gear Ratios.
You must set the gear ratios of your gearbox to suit each circuit.
This is usually done by setting the 6th gear for the fastest poccible
speed along the longest straight; then setting the lowest gear for the
slowest corner. The rest of the gears are ranged somewhere between the
two.
Gear ration selection is very important. Different cogs can be fitted
to the gearbox which can have a major effect on the car's
acceleration, performance in bends and top speed.
Twisty circuits with few long straights and plenty of chicanes demand
'short' gaering for quick acceleration.
Other circuits with long straights require 'long' gearing to give the
car the top speed it will need to keep up with the opposition.
The gearbox has a range from 1 to 64. Move the slider to set the ratio
for each gear.
The nearer the cogs are to each other, the less work the lower gear
has to do to get to the higher gear (short gearing).
The further away the cogs are from each other the more work it has to
do to get up to the highest gears but the faster the speed at the top
gear (long gearing).

    Tyre Choice.
You can choose from a variety of tyres when you are in racing trim and
you can choose qualifying tyres when you are participating in a timed
practice. Remember you are limited to 4 sets of Qualifiers.

        Save the Car Set-Up.

You can save the Set-Up you have chosen for your car when you are in
the Pits, by pulling back on your controller, to access the Set-Up
options.

If, whilst your'e driving about and come up to the pit lane and find
yourself being dragged in, with nothing you do making any difference,
it's because you've been called in. You can tell wether your pit crew
think you should stop by the lighting of the cross symbol on the
dashboard to the colour yellow. If you don't agree with the pit crew
then press 'Return' to cancel the pit request. They usually want to
drag you in after a crash if your still going, or if your tyres are
losing grip.

If the sky is grey and not the usual bluish colour it means that it's
wet and the pit crew will already have put on wet tyres.
