                        General Manager/Owner Disk


Important Note:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	To show you how lame MicroLeague Sports is, this original 
contained IBM xeroxed docs which were incomplete as they chose to withhold
installation information which pertained to IBM & compatibles, but forgot that
other pertinent information was on the other side of these pages.  We suspect
that all of the Amiga versions were shipped this way, so hopefully they may
correct this in a future version, but for the sake of the docs, we regret that
the following information is lacking herein: the rest of the info on Initial-
ing a New League, information on Trading Players, and information on Copying
Teams.  In addition the Amiga loading and installation instructions are absent
as well, but this should not trouble you very much.  One final note, not only
were the docs a complete bust, but my `original' disk had a new label pasted
over the top of an old Microleague Sports IBM Football game.  You would think
that they could have at least taken off the old labels?!?!


General Information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The purpose of the GM/O program is to allow you to fully control your team
rosters, and give you access to each player's statistics if you wish to update
them. You can use current box score information in your Manager's Challenge
game by updating stats thru the GM/O. You can create new players yourself.
And you can change team rosters by trading your own players, any players
included in The Manager's Challenge game, or in any of the auxiliary disks
available from MicroLeague Sports.

To use the GM/O functions with your Manager's Challenge game, you must have
the teams you want to use for trading or editing in league files. The league
name is equivalent of the file name, needed by the program to locate your
teams.  Leaues may be set up using either the Stat Compiler program, which
is included with The Manager's Challenge game, this GM/O program, or the
Enhanced Stat Compiler...

The GM/O program functions are:

	* Update Existing Team: Change statistics for existing players
	* Create New Team: Enter new player and set up teams from scratch
	* Initialize a New League: Set up leagues and divisions
	* Trade Players: Move existing players between teams
	* Copy Teams: Copy existing teams to a new league
	* Print Roster: Print and view team stats
	* Verify Team: Checks teams changed with the GM/O to be sure the teams
		       are complete and will operate with the game.

The Graphic Interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One of the major improvements to The Manager's Challenge game and auxiliary 
disks is the use of a graphic interface. It's easier than ever to make your
trades and keep track of your teams, especially if you use a mouse to point
and click. You can click anywhere on a box to select it. At the top of each
screen is a close box that takes you back to the previous screen (equivalent
to using the ESC key). For screens where more teams or players are available
than can be shown at one time, there is a scroll bar that you can click on to
move up or down the list.

If you don't use a mouse, each selection is marked with a letter, a number, or
a Function key, so it's easy to make your selections by entering them with the
keyboard. The ESC key takes you back to the previous screen. You use the down
and up arrows to scroll thru the lists that won't fit onto one screen.

Updating An Existing Team
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To change stats for a team that already exists, use F1 Update Existing Team.
(NOTE: If you have not yet set up one or more leagues, and assigned teams to
them, you will not be able to update any teams. Go to the section of this
manual on Initializing Leagues, to set up your leagues.)

The first screen is Select a League File. After selecting the drawer where
your league files are stored, the names of your leagues will appear in the
nine lines on the screen. If you have set up more than nine leagues, use the
down arrow key or the scroll bar to scroll down to the remainder of the league
names. Select the league containing the team you want to update by entering
the number shown beside the league name or by clicking the mouse on the line.

Next, the Select Team screen shows all the teams in the league you selected.
Choose the team you wish to change.

Next, the Edit Team screen shows your team name and abbreviation (used on the
stadium scoreboard and the Stat Compiler). Using this screen, you may change
the Team Name, the Team Abbreviation, or the Team Divivsion (if your league
contains more than one division.)

To change player information, enter F2 Edit Roster. You may enter the Team
Roster screen which shows your selected team name at the top. All the players
on the team roster and their positions are shown. Batters are on the left side
and pitchers are on the right. Select the player to be modified.

Depending upon the position of the player you select, the next screen will be
either Edit Batter or Edit Pitcher. Both types of screens are used in the same
way, the difference is only in the stats accumulated for each type of player.
The cursor is indicated by the flashing box in the window which is active. Use
the down arrow key, or mouse to move to the boxes you wish to change. The 
large window under the player's name shows an explanation of the entry
required in the active box.

F3 Delete Player will allow you to delete any number of players from your
roster. When you've made all your changes, press F1 Save, or F2 Cancel.

Where there are stat boxes on both the right and left side of the stat
descriptions, the left side box is for left handed pitching/batting. The right
side box is for right handed pitching/batting. If stats are not available
separately for right and left handed pitching, use the combined stats on both
sides. The F1 Calc % function will calculate the percentages in the center
column for you.  You do not have to enter them, if you have completed the
first column.  When you have finished making all the changes you wish to this
player, click on the close box at the top of the screen, or press the ESC key.
You will go back to rest of the team roster. To change other players, select
them form the Team Roster screen and repeat the above procedures.

When you are done making changes to a team, exit with the ESC key, or click
on the close box. Press the ESC key again to exit past the team name screen.
The Exit screen allows you to Save your changes with the F1 key, or F2 Cancel
and leave the roster as it was before.

Batter Statistics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Following are the statistics for Batters used by The Manager's Challenge game.
In addition to statistics, there are also ratings required for some areas of
player ability. You have the opportunity to rate players using your assessment
of their talent in comparison with other players. You may also develop your
ratings based on your interpretation of their records from reference books.

Creating A New Team
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Create A New team section of the GM/O Disk allows you to build a new team
by imputting all player information yourself. (If you haven't set up any
leagues yet, you must first create one with the Initialize A New League in 
this program, or with the Stat Compiler program in the game.)

First, in the Select a League File, you select the drive/drawer which you 
have already setup. If there is more than one division in the league you 
selected, your next screen will be Select Division. Select the division for
your new team. Then, in the Create Team screen, enter the new team's name and
the abbreviation for the team (which shows in the scoreboard window and the
stat roster.)

Then, to build your team, press F2 Edit Roster. You will see a blank roster
notebook that you can begin to fill up as you put together your team. All
batters are entered in the left side in lines A thru O. All pitchers are on
the right side in P thru 5. Select a letter to begin with your first new
player. Selecting a pitching position takes you to the Edit Pitchers screen;
selecting a batter takes you to the Edit Batters screen.

The Edit Pitchers and Edit Batters screens are exactly like the screens for
Pitchers and Batters in the section Update Existing Team, with the exception
that all boxes are completely empty. You will make all the entries for players
yourself. (See the Update Existing Team section of this manual for the des-
criptions of the statistics and abbreviations used. Follow those procedures to
enter players names and stats in creating a new team.)

Depending upon what your desired team roster is, you may find it easier to
copy an existing team, and make changes with the Update Existing Team or Trade
Players menu, than to start from scratch and enter all of the data yourself.
However, you may not have teams that contain the players you want. In that
case, you can build any team using Create a New Team.


Initializing a New League
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Whether or not you are actually using league files for a competitive play, to
trade players or edit stats, you must have any teams that you want to edit or
trade between assigned to a league. New leagues can be initialized either from
the GM/O program, the Stat Compiler, or the Enhanced Stat Compiler.


Printing Team Rosters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using the Print Roster section, you can view or print out the roster and
statistics for you teams before or after you have made changes. Enter F6
Print Roster from the main menu. In the Choose League screen, select the drive
and league file where your desired team is located.

Next, in the Print Stats section, select the team you wish to view or print.
You will see, and be able to print, Combined Batting Stats, Batting Versus
Left Hand Pitching, Batting Versus Right Handed Pitching, Combined Pitching
Stats, Pitching Versus Left Handed Batting, Pitching Versus Right Handed 
Batting. These are roster stats, not the compiled stats from your league play
that are maintained in your Stat Compiler.


Verifying A Team
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After you have edited or created a team, you should use the F7 Verify A Team
section to ensure that the new version of the team has all of the information
necessary to play the game properly.

First, press F7, then select the league file for the team you want to verify.
Then select the team. After you have selected the team, verify will run auto-
matically and tell you if there is a problem with a player's stats or ratings
will affect the game play.

You should go to the Update Existing Team section of the GM/O, and make the
necessary corrections. To ensure that there are no other errors in the team,
you must verify the team again. If there is more than one error in a team, the
program only locates the first one, others are found by rerunning the verifi-
cation and correcting the errors until the entire team is correct.


Using the Teams You Create or Edit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To use your new teams, load the MicroLeague Baseball, the Manager's Challenge
game as usual. The game automatically shows the All Time Greats teams included
with the disk. Select F1 or click on Choose League to access your other league
files. In the Choose League screen, select the drive where your league files
are located.  You will select the league for the Visiting Team first. After 
selecting the team you want, select the Home Team in the same way. You can go
back to the game disk teams for the Home Team, or play against teams in any
leagues on other disks you have set up, or on auxiliary disks.

You play and accumulate stats, as you usually do, with your new leagues and 
your Stat Compiler. Then return to the GM/O program anytime you want to make
further roster changes or edit player stats.
