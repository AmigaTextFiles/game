RAVE AND MIDI

RAVE is the musical equivalent of a word processor - it allows you to
record music and change details of it in a number of ways before
saving it to disc or printing it out - or, simply playing it back.

RAVE records exactly when and where you play notes on your MIDI
keyboard, and then, when you press the Play button, RAVE will instruct
your keyboard to replay exactly the sequence of notes you played.

A BRIEF WORD ABOUT MIDI
 
MIDI stands for Musical Instruments Digital Interface. in short, MIDI is
the term given to the waay in wich electronic instruments, such as
keyboards, talk to one another. MIDI is not just restricted to musical
intruments, it can be used to control a great number of other things,
such as special effects and samplers.

Do not confuse 'tracks' with 'MIDI Channels'. Tracks are for recording
your music on; the 16 MIDI channels determine what sounds will be
used when you hear your music played back. For example, you could
have your drum sounds on your keyboard set to MIDI channel 10, your drum
sounds will be heard (to set MIDI channels on your MIDI keyboard refer
to your instrument's manual).

USING RAVE

The purpose of this manual is to show you, in very easy steps, how to
create music with RAVE, By the time you have completed the following
examples you will have used most of the major funtions of RAVE

Although RAVE can be used with any MIDI instrument, the best results
will be obtained with a keyboard/synthesiser that is the multi-timbral,
that is to say, a keyboard that can play more than one soundat the time via
different MIDI channels. There are 16 MIDI channels (1-16) and it is
possible to get a keyboard that play 16 different sounds (one for
each MIDI channel) at the same time. In effect, this is equal to having 
16 different keyboards all set on different sounds. Most budget
keyboards are what is said to be 8-part multi-trimbal (8 different sounds
when used on a 8 different MIDI channels). A good example of this kind

                                     2

of keyboard is the KAWAI K1-2. RAVE can also be used to good effect
with single channel keyboards.

GETTING GOING
 
CONNECTING UP

connect the MIDI-in of your computer to the MIDI-out of your MIDI
keyboard, and the MIDI-out of your computer to the MIDI-in of your
MIDI keyboard, using MIDI leads.

AMIGA NOTE: Connect your MIDI interface to the serial port of your
-----------
Amiga according to the instructions supplied with your MIDI interface.
Connect the MIDI-out of your MIDI KEYBOARD to the MIDI-in of the
interface, and the interface MIDI-out to the keyboard MIDI-in Any other
MIDI equiptment can be linked into the system using MIDI- thrus. MIDI-
thru is usually available on MIDI devices as well as the Amiga MIDI
keyboard MIDI-thru to the first additional divice, then via the first
devices MIDI-thru to the second device etc. This will allow the Amiga to
control all devices in the system.

If possible, turn the local keyboard control of your keyboard to OFF.
This is usually referred to as LOCAL OFF. Cosult your equipment
manual if you are unsure of how to do this.

Insert the RAVE program disc into the disc drive of your computer and
then switchon all your external equipment, followed by your computer.
Boot up RAVE as normal (With the AMIGA, insert RAVE into the
computer before switching it on; RAVE wil then load and run).


Once the program has been fully loaded you will be presented with the
TRACKLIST page. If you press keys on your MIDI keyboard you will
see the Velocity column for track 1 show a greenbar, indecating
incoming MIDI data. If this does not happen then check your MIDI
connections and leads carefully.

                                     3

Rave's Tracklist Page

RAVE TUTORIAL

Press the asterisk (*) key on the number pad of your computer or click
on the button marked REC with the left mouse button. You will hear a
metronome sound coming from your monitor. There will be count-in
of 8 beats (2 bars). Anytime after the 8 count-in beats play any note on
your MIDI keyboard. Now press '0' button on your computer's
number pad twice, or click on the button marked STOP with the
left mouse button. The metronome will stop and you have just made
your first recording!

To hear what you just have recorded press 'ENTER' (on numeric pad)
or click on PLAY and RAVE will play your note in the exact time and
place that you recorded it. Now press the '0' button (numeric pad) on
your computer twice or click twice on STOP. Now select a new sound
on your MIDI keyboard. Now press the ENTER button (numeric pad) on
your computer or click on PLAY. The previously recorded note will
play, but this time it plays with the new sound that you just selected.
This is because when you record with RAVE you are not recording
sound at all. You are, in fact, recording digital information giving the
note pitch, its lenght and position in your music.

                                     4

On your MIDI keyboard set a bass sound on MIDI channel 1, a piano
sound on MIDI channel 2, and a drum sound on MIDI channel 10.
Make sure your MIDI keyboard is set to multiple mode (See:'Set-up for
use with external sequencers', in your MIDI keyboard manual, or,
'multi-timbral Set-up).

Play a note on your MIDI keyboard; you should hear your bass sound
coming trough. If not then re-read your MIDI keyboard manual to
make sure that you have set it up correctly. If you are getting more
than one sound, such as bass and strings together, then this also
means that you are not set up correctly, refer to the part in your MIDI
keyboard manual about OMNI ON and OMNI OFF.

You should now be at the stage of hearing just the bass sound when
you play your keyboard. Down the left side of your screen you will see
the numbers 1 to 16. Press the down arrow on your computer and hold
it down. The numbers 17-32 will then scroll through. These make up
your 32 recording tracks. Now press the up arrow and this will return
you to the first 16 tracks. Note that track 1 is highlighted, this means
that the track is 'active' and ready to record your music.

To the right of the words NEW NAME (in track 1) is another column
with the number 1 in, above it is the word CHAN, this stands for MIDI
CHANNEL. Click on the number 1 with your right mouse button and
inrease this to number 10, You have just set track number 1 to send,
and recieve MIDI data on MIDI channel number 10 (drum channel).
NBow play your MIDI keyboard and you should now be hearing drum
sounds and no longer hearing a bass sound.

Now move the mouse pointer to the top right hand corner of your
screen. You will see HRS MIN SEC, This will tell you the time span of
your music. Below this is TIME SIGNATURE, you can change the time
signature by clicking on the 4/4 sign with nleft mouse button to decrease
and right button to increase the values.

Below the TIME SIGNATURE is the Current Position Marker, BAR BTS
CLKS. This will tell you at what bar, beat and part of the beat you are at
any given moment. Part of a beat is measured in clocks (CLKS).
You can move your Current Position within a song by clicking with the
left or right butons, moving you backwards or forwards through your
song.

                                     5

Below the current Position Marker  are the POSITION MARKERS.
These 2 boxes looks like the current position marker except that they
have an L and R next to them. L=Left and R=Right. These are used to
define specific areas in your song witch can cycle around (repeat). For
example: Let's say that you had composed a song that happened to be
16 bars long, with bars 1-8 being your introduction and bars 9-16 your
verse. You are not happy with the bass line in the verse section and
you want to change it, you would do this as follows:
 
Set up the left marker to 9, like this:

                            BAR    BTS    CLKS
                            009:    01:    000       L=Left

and your right marker like this:

                            BAR    BTS    CLKS
                            017:    01:    000       R=Right

Now, if you highlight the CYCLE button (next to the scroll arrows on the
screen) and press RECORD, RAVE will cycle between bar 9 and the
end of bar 16 for as long as you want it. With each cycle you can re-
record your bass line. RAVE will save the last complete cycle, so don't
worry if you fluff it the first couple of times, just keep RAVE in record
mode and it will rub over your mistakes, and, when you get it right, just
stop the program by pressing STOP (or '0' on the computer keyboard)
and you will have saved the last full cycle you recorded.

RECORDING

Now, lets record something.

1. Hit the '0' button on the computer twice. This will reset RAVE to bar
1, beat 1.

2. Go to the right position marker and, by pressing the Left mouse
button, reduce the number 009 (bars) down to 005

3. Click on the CYCLY button. This means that all the recording you do
will be over 4 bars.

                                     6

4. Go to track 1 and make sure that its MIDI channel is set to 10 (drum
sounds).

5. Make sure that the monitor volume control is switched on, so you
can hear the count-in from your monitor speaker.

6. Click on the RECORD button (or press * on the computer keyboard).
You will hear a 2 bar count-in (8 beats). After the count-in play 4 bass
drum beats in time with the metronome, then stop the program.

7. Go to the parameters value and click on the word OFF next to the
word QUANTISE. Change it to the number 4 (with the right mouse
button) this will correct the timing of the bass drum, it will now play
back spot on the beat.

8. Now click with both mouse buttons on the area marked NEW
TRACK and type in the name BASSDRUM.

CREATING A NEW TRACK

1. To create a new track, click with both mouse buttons in the name
area of the track 2. This willhighlight track 2,calling it NEW TRACK. Click
with both mouse buttons here again, and call it SNAREDRUM.

2. Set the MIDI channel to 10. and, following the instructions above 
record your snare drum. Whilst you are doing this you will be able to
hear the bass drum part you recorded. Rememer to quantise the
snare drum, (time recorded). Each time you start a new track the
parameters are reset to the 'OFF' position for the new track.

THE NEXT STEP

1. Create a new track and name it Piano and select MIDI channel 2.

2. Record the chords C and then F with an 8th (semi-quavers) feel to
them (something like ( and 2 and F and 2). If you don't follow this,
don't worry, just play what you can.

3. Stop RAVE and set the QUANTISE number to 8.

4. Create a new track and call it bass, select MIDI channel 1. Record
as above and set QUANTISE to 8.

                                     7

well done, you have just composed your 4 bars of music. Now
let's make that into a longer piece of music without playing another
note:

COPY ON

If you have not already done so press '0' on your computer twice.

1. De-select the CYCLE button.

2. To the left of the position markers are 2 reset buttons. Please note
carefully what we do next; in order to get this right you must press the
correct mouse button at this point.

With the RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON, click on the RIGHT position
marker's RESET BUTTON (that is, the bottom position marker).

Note that the CURRENT POSITION MARKER now shows 005:01:00.

3. What you are about to do is copy all of your music between bar 1
and the ned of bar 4 (last bar), om all of the tracks you have recorded,
to the currrent position at bar 5(first beat). Now click on the button
marked COPY/PASTE. The screen will change. Click on COPY (top of
the page). It will now be highlighted. Now click on DO SELECTED
TRACKS. You have now extended your 4 bars of music to 8 bars!

This short peice of music you have just created is the basic building
block of RAVE. Creating an entire song is simply an extension of this,
using more of RAVE's features. Following is a full description of the
various elements of RAVE.

THE RAVE PROGRAM CONTROLS

At all times you will see on-screen the page menu along the bottom of
your screen and the control panel on the right of the screen, so you
should firstly familiarise yourslef with these.

                                     8

THE PAGE MENU

This runs along the bottom of the screen and is visible at all times.
Clicking on any of the buttons calls up the particular page of the
program asked for. You can also change pages from the computer
keyboard by pressing the first letter of the page name (except the
Score Edit & Sampler pages; 'S' is used for Set-Up page. 'N' for
Notation calls up the Score Edit page, 'R' calls up the Sampler
page). There are the following pages shown in this menu: Tracklist,
Cut/Paste, Score, Event, Grid, Set-Up, Sampler - a further page, the
Disc page is accessed by clicking on the green block to the right of the
page menu.

THE CONTROL PANEL

The Control Panel runs down the right side of the screen and is
visible at all times. 

REAL TIME CLOCK

This is a clock showing, in hours, minutes and seconds the play time of 
any pice of music you play or record.

                                     9

TIME SIGNATURE

This shows the time signature you have selected for your piece of
music. As with allmost all number values in RAVE you can change
these settings by clicking on the number with the mouse buttons.
Pressing the left button decreases the value and pressing with the right
button increases the value.

THE CURRENT POSTION MARKER

This shows you, in bars, beats and clocks exactly where you are in
your piece of music at any time (there are 120 clocks per beat). You
can jump to any position you set up in this window by clicking on the
values. Clicking with the left button decreases the avlue and the right
button increases the value.

POSITION MARKERS

There are many operations in RAVE that can affect a particular section
of music. For example, you may wish to copy a section you have
already recorded to another part of music. You select the section
required by stating its Start Point (Left Position Marker) and its End
point (Right Position Marker).  You change the position markers by
clicking on the bar, beats and clock numbers. This right position marker
must always have a higher value than the left position marker.
Clicking on the little button to the left of the number values re-sets to
bar 1, beat 1; clicking with the right button automaticaly sets up the
Current Position Marker to be the same as the left or right position
marker value.

TRACK WINDOW

This shows you which track you are working with. The name shown
here is thename you have given to your track. Clicking the small
arrows to the left of the window allows you to change tracks. The right
mouse button scrolls down, and the left button scrolls up your tracklist.

You can change the track name from the track window by clicking with
both mouse buttons at the same time on the track naem.  A cursor will
appear enabling you to type in a new track name.  If there is a name
there already, backspacing on the computer keyboard will erase that
name. Hit return after typing your naem to enter it. NAmes entered
here are also shown on the tracklist.

                                    10

THE BLOCK WINDOW

This is the name box for your piece of music or block.  Your block can
contain up to 32 tracks of varying lenght.

THE SCROLLING ARROWS

Usually, clicking on these arrows will advace or rewind your current
position within a track.  On the Tracklist page these buttons scroll
through the list of tracks. On the score page the up/down arrows scroll
the display. On the Disc and Sampler pages the up/down arrows scroll
through the directory list.

INFO

Clicking on this calls up general information including the amount of
free memory available.

PANIC!

Occasionally you may find that your MIDI instrument plays a note and
then does not switch it off. When this happens click on the panic button
to clear the note.

CYCLE

When this is highlighted RAVE will cycle between the Left and Right
position markers, either in Record or Play mode.

THE CONTROL BUTTONS

These act just like tape recorder controls. Click once on PLAY to set
your music playing. One click on STOP will stop play nad a second
click on STOP will reset the music back to the beginning. Clicking on
RECORD will give a 2 bar count-in before recording starts.

DROP

Allows you to Drop-in record i.e. to record only between the Left and
Right position markers. So, you can arrange to record, say, omly two
bars in the middle of an already-recorded piece of music.

TEMPO

You can change the tempo of your music by clicking on the numbers
here. Maximum temp is 240 beats per minute.

                                    11

THE GRID PAGE

Click on the button marked GRID at the bottom of the screen. When
the page changes you will see a piano keyboard at the top of the page.
The numbers down the left side represent bar numbers. The horizontal
lines represent 16th beats. The highlighted horizontal lines represent
4th beats. Press '0' on your computer keyboard twice, then press
'ENTER'. Your music will play and you will see your music scroll up to
bar 9. After bar 9 the grid will be empty.

If you still hear the music after the first 9 bars and the grid still shows
music scrolling, you have left the CYCLE mode on.

CHANGING NOTES IN THE GRID PAGE

At the moment you are only looking at one track. To viez a different
track click up or down on the small arrows to the left of the track naem
bos (on the right of your screen just below the Left & Right Markers).
You can also rename your track by clicking with both mouse buttons on
the track naem area and typing in your new name.

ADDING NOTED INTO THE GRID

After pressing STOP twice, click on the box named ADD located
towards the bottom of the screen.

                                    12

Using the piano keyboard display at the top of the screen, point your
mouse at the note on the piano keybaord that you wish to insert. Then
move your mouse down the grid until it is in line with the number 2
located to the left of the screen. Click with the left mouse button. You
have just inserted your chosen note on bar 2, beat 1.

CHANGING THE LENGHT OF THE NOTE BEING ADDED

The note lenght must be decided before you insert a note.  You can do
this by changing the number in the box below the ADD box. A '1'
means a whole note, a '4' a quarter note and so on. 'T' stands for
Triplet.

MIDI ADD

To add notes via your MIDI keyboard, highlight EXT in the panel,
select your note lenght and then play-in your notes. The grid display
steps on with each note played, so, to see what you have played you
will need to scroll back.

The Note Information Box, which is the panel on the left below the
scroll window, gives you detailed information on any note selected (by
clicking on the note with the left mouse button), but this information
cannot be edited via this window. The values will change in the box if
you click on them, however the program will ignore them. Detailed
editing should be carried out on the EVENT page.

THE TRACKLIST PAGE

Creating a Track
To create a new track, simply click with both mouse buttons in the
Name area of an empty track. Each track can be named:; to do this
click with both mouse buttons on the name area where it currently says
NEW TRACK. After naming the tracks press return on your computer
keyboard to set the name.

                                    13

MIDI CHANNEL

Each track must be assigned a MIDI channel to recieve and send MIDI
data (see your MIDI keyboard's manual). You set the MIDI channel by
pressing on the number 1 in the CHAN column to increase the channel
number, or the left mouse button to decrease the number.

STATUS

Each track can independently, be switched ON or OFF (affects
copy/past funtions), as well as set to MUTE or SOLO. To switch OFF
a track click with the right mouse button in the Status column. To
SOLO a track click with both mouse buttons in the Status column.
When in SOLO mode clicking with the right mouse button in the
column MUTES the track. A further click with both mouse buttons
returns to ON/OFF mode.

DELETING A SINGLE TRACK

move the pointer to the track number and hold down both mouse
buttons and move cursor to the far right of the screen then release.
This will delete all of your track information including your track name,
MIDI channel settings and the parameter settings. If you only wish to
delete your music but still wish to keep the track name, MIDI channel,
and parameters then just drag your track to the parameter section.
Putting RAVE in RECORD will automatically delete any musical data
already on the track (or everything between the left and the right position
markers if in cycle mode). Deleting can also be done in the
CUT/PASTE page.

MOVING A TRACK

Move the pionter to a track number then holddown the left button and
drag to any empty track nuber, and release.

COPYING A TRACK

Move the pointer to a track number then hold down the right button and
drag to an empty track and release.

PARAMETERS AND VALUES.

QUANTISE

this will correct the timming of your music. Select the value with left or
right button.

                                    14

PROGRAM

Program is the name that is given to the individual sounds in your
keyboard, program number is the number that any on of the sounds
are assigned to. An example wouold be as follows: Program number
one on your MIDI keyboard might represent the Electric Piano sounds. If
you change the program nymber you will see the names of all sounds
on your MIDI keyboard also change as you do so. All program
numbers, as well as the other parameters, will be saved to disc when
you save your song. So, When you load your song up the next day,
RAVE will automatically find all the sounds that you used.

Programs are sometimes refered to as PATCHES.

There is another way of using program change; for more information
on this please refer to the section below; 'TIPS FOR SINGLE-SOUND
KEYBOARDS'. The right and left mouse buttons will increase and
decrease the program patch number on your MIDI keyboard. Your
keyboard must be set up to recieve program change.

(TIP FOR SINGLE_SOUND KEYBOARDS: Splitting the
Keyboard

Most single-sound keyboards have the capability of allocating one
sound to the lower half of its keyboard and another to the top half.
Althought it is usual for both sounds to share the same MIDI channel,
sometimes you can allocate them to separate MIDI channels when
using a sequencer such as RAVE. It would be wothwhile spending
some time with your keyboard manual to make sure you are getting the
best out of it.)


VOLUME

The right and left mouse buttons will alter the volume for each MIDI
channel. NOTE: if you have 3 recorded tracks, all on the same MIDI
channel, altering the volume or pan value will have the same effect on
the other two tracks.

PAN
This can only be used when you have a stereo output.

                                    15

THE TRACKLIST SUB MENU

This is to be found at the bottom of the tracklist page, underneath the
list of tracks.

TRACK LIST

On entering the Tracklist page first this button is highlighted. Whenever
one of the other buttons in this little menu is pressed clicking on the
Track List button will return you to this display.

BLOCK INFO

Clicking on this button brings up a display which gives you information
about the blocks and tracks you are working with. In this display is a
NEW/DEL button which, when clicked, will delete the set of track you
had on the Tracklist page.

DRUM LOOP

This is an overdub facility between pre-defined position markers. When
this is selected RAVE will cycle between your locators, recording
everything you play on each cycle without wiping out what was
recorded on previous cycles. This is great for building up drum tracks,
but make sure you set a quantise befor you start recording. Although
we will call it drum loop it is worth saying that this facility can be used for
any MIDI sound.

TUNE

This will emit a pitch of 440, middle C.

THE CUT AND PASTE PAGE

All operations in the Cut/Past page affect data found between the left 
and right markers.

COPY

will copy the section of music defined by the left and right markers, and
will copy it to the position given by the Current Position Marker.

WIPE

will wipe all data between left and right markers leaving a space for
new data to be placed in to if required.

REMOVE

will cut data between markers and close up the cap that is left.

INSERT

will insert the music that lies between the left and right position
markers into the current play position. In doing this it will automatically
make a space for atself by 'pushing' all information after the current
play position along the track.

Clicking on 'Do current track' will affect only that track shown on the
tracklist page as being the current selected track. Clicking on 'DO
selected tracks' will affect all those tracks which are switched ON in
the tracklist page.

                                    17

UNDO

will undo the last operation performed in this page. RESTORE will
return your piece of music to the state it was when you first entered the
Cut/Paste page.

THE SCORE PAGE

From this page you can see your music, one track at a time, in the
form of written music.

THE SCROLL ICON

The current position of the score is selected by the main indicators.
The Main Control Panel scroll icon can be used to fast-forward and
fast-rewind trough the data. Notes can be heard whilst scrolling the
score.

SUB MENU

Immediately below the stave, when the page is not in FULL mode, is
the sub menu.A

                                    18

To select items on the sub menu click on the required button with
either mouse button. When highlighed the button appears as white on
black and the relevant information is displayed.

CHANGING CLEFS

To chqnge clefs click on the button marked CONTROL/INFO until it
changes to CLEFS then simply click on the clef on the stave to be
changed and then select the desired new clef from the clef menu by
clicking on it. The new clef automaticaly replaces the old clef on the
stave. A number 8 above or below the clef indicates that the notes will
be played an octave higher or lower.

KEYS

Highlight the keys button in the sub menu by mousing on it. The
window below the sub menu will then display the selection of keys.
Select the required key by mousing on it; the key signature is then
automatically inserted on the stave. 

INSERTING NOTES

Highlight the Notes and Insert buttons on the sub menu, then select the
value of the note required from the choise displayed in the window
when the Note button is highlighted (the note selected is framed by a
box).

There are two ways to insert notes:

1. SPOT INSERT
To place notes on the stave at the cursor position (the tip of the arrow)
simply click with the right mouse button. Whilst holding down the
button and moving the cursor vertically the note's pitch can be changed
(you can hear pitch changes if a MIDI is connected) and
moving the cursor from left to right will change its position on the
stave. Releasing the button will insert the note at the cursor position.
As you move the cursor the changing time and position can be seen in 
the NOte Information Box underneath the sub menu.

2. STEP INSERT
To enter a note onto the stave at the current time, as given in the Note
Information Box, fisrt point the cursor to the pitch required and then

                                    19

click with the left mouse button. Before releasing the button the pitch
can be changed by moving the cursor vertically on the stave (and can
be seen in the Note Information Box), and by moving the cursor from
left to right you can alter the velocity - again reflected in the Note
Information Box.

BE CAREFUL : NOTES INSERTED THIS WAY DO NOT APPEAR
WHERE THE CURSOR IS POSITIONED ON THE STAVE. To enter
notes on the stave where the cursor is positioned you should use Spot
insert.

REST INSERT

To insert a rest selected the note value equal to the rest value (just as if
you were going to insert a note) then mouse on the right insert arrow
(>). The current time, as shown in the Note Information Box, will
advance by the value of the rest inserted.
Note : rests will not be displayed until a ful bar of information is
created.

UNDO/RESTORE

Clicking on Undo will undo the last action.
Each time you leave the Tracklist PAge the number block is saved in a
buffer. If you make changes which end up sounding disastrous,
selecting Restore will replace the edited block with the original in the
buffer, re-setting the block as it was when you left the Tracklist page. If
you then return to the Tracklist page from the Score edit page the
buffer from the original block is lost, making all changes permanent. If
you return to the Score Edit page a new buffer is created.

NOTE EDIT

This mode is used to edit data which is already in memory as displayed
on the stave.

Clicking on any note with the left mouse button will select that note for
editing. The note's parameters are displayed in the Note
Informatiom Box. To change data, enter the Note Information Box.
All the above operations can be performed using the left or right mouse 
buttons on the appropriate field in the Note Information Box.

Whatever changes are made in the Note Information Box are reflected
on the score.

                                    20

DRAGGING NOTES

simply click and hold down the left mouse button on the note you wish
to move; the cursor arrow will change to a pointing finger. Point the tip
of the finger to where you wish to re-position the note. The note will
only move after you have released the mouse button.
As you move the finger the note's pitch and timing is displayed in the
Note Information Box. If a MIDI sound source is connected you will
hear the note being dragged.

DELETE

Whilst in edit mode clicking with the right mouse button on any note
will delete it.

DISPLAY EDIT BOX

This is located on the right hand side of the screen below the sub
menu.

To change informatiom in this box simply mouse on the values to be
changed. The left mouse button decrements the value whereas
mousing with the right mouse button increments the value.

DISPLAY QUANTISE

The display of notes is governed by the value of the display quantise.
For example, a display quantise of 8 would display notes of greater
value than, or equal to, quavers (crochets, minims, etc.) and would not
display 16th notes.

SPLIT

This function allows you to selected whether notes appear in the upper or
lower clef. For example, if you select C3 all notes of a higher pitch will
appear on the top stave and all notes of a lower pitc on the lower
stave. The left mouse button will lower the pitch and the right mouse
button will increase the pitch.

                                    21

PRINTING

You can print out your music to Epson-compatible printers, one track at
a time.

By pressing F10 on your computer keyboard you can print out all music
on the currently selected track that falls between the left and right
position markers, so you must first set the markers to the position that
define the section of music you want to print. The program will
automaticaly space your music to print onto A4 paper.

On the SCORE page you can also use the function keys instead of
clicking on CONTROL/INFO (F1-F6) and FULL (F7).

THE EVENT PAGE

This is the nost powerfull editing page in the program. The black line
tells you the event that is currently playing. The note time, length,
velocity and pitch can be altered by clicking with the left or right
buttons. Try clicking on the DATA column and see how the note
changes. Try clicking on the number beside the note, this is the
velocity. Try changing the event's time.

Events can be any MIDI CONTROLLER data, such as pitch bend,
program change, etc., as well as notes.

                                    22

To make it easy for you to see what you are doing whe have put a visual
filter in. If you highlight the type of event at the bottom of the page it
will visually eliminate those events from the event list. To demonstrate
this, you may have noticed that one of two of the boxes are already
black - Note Off, for instance. If you click on it with the right mouse 
button so that it turns white, you will notice that the event list has
changed it in order to show you Note Off information.

PITCH BEND INFORMATION

If you have a pitch bend on your keyboard, then stay on this page.
Press zero twice to reset, then record something using your bend.
Then make sure the Pitch Bend button is white and then you will see
your pitch bend data on the list. Now highlight Pitch Bend and you will
see the data disappear from the event list, but you will still be able to
hear it when you play your music.

CHORD MODE

If you have played chords then selecting this will change the way in 
which the Event list is displayed so that the chords can be seen in the list.

EVENT FILTERS

The lower two rows of buttons, above the Page menu, are event filters.
The filters do not alter the data in memory, or the way that it is played;
they just alter the display of that data. An event list full of notes and
controller messages would look very clutterd and confusing if you only
wanted to view and edit progam change events, so by filtering from
the display this events you do not wish to see you can find the
specific data you want to edit immediately.

Black text on white indecates that the filter os off and that the named
data is displayed. Clicking on one of the filter buttons with the left
mouse button will switch the filter ON, removing that type of data
from the display, and highlighting the button in black with white text. A
further press turns the filter off again.

The filters act on note-on, note-off, pich bend, modulation wheel,
channel aftertouch, polyphonic aftertouch, program change, and
controller messages, and any combination of filters can be used at any
time.

                                    23

DELETING EVENTS

To delete an event from the list, select DELETE from the submenu
and click on the event to be deleted.

SHOW DEFAULTS

Clicking on the SHOW DEFAULTS button will open a window in wich
can be set the default insert values for notes and controllers. For
inserting notes ythere are default values for MIDI channel velocity, and
note length, while for controllers only default value is the controller
number. The window can be closed by using the close icon in the top
left hand corner of the window, or by clicking again on the defaults
button.

INSERTING EVENTS

To add events to the list, click on the apropriate event filter button
with the right mouse button. When selected with the right button
the event filter buttons, instead of selecting the display filters, become
event insert buttons. A right mouse button press on any event label will
insert a default event of that type into the display at the current position
as shown by the current position marker on the main panel. Only one
type of event may be selected at one time.
The event time, channel and data fields can then be directly edited
with the mouse to set the disired parameters for the event. If you
insert a controller, two items of data are listed in the data column, the
first value is the controller number and the second is the level of that
controller. Once inserted both the level and controller type can then 
be edited to the presice values required.
Note-off events cannot be inserted on their own, but they are
automatically entered when a note-on is inserted, the point at wich
they are added depending on the note lenght set in the defaults
window.

                                    24

PROGRAM CHANGE IN THE EVENT EDIT PAGE

IMPORTANT: First read the section "PARAMETERS AND VALUES".

You can insert program Changes anywhere in your track via the 
EVENT PAGE. Try this:

1. Record 3 bars of music with a piano sound then stop RAVE and
make usre that program change on the track parameter list is turned to
OFF.
2. Select the event page and press '0' on your computer twice.

3. Select the program change and insert as described in the above
section on the Event page. After you have made your insert be sure
that the program filer butten is white.

4. Go to the VALUES column and change the number until it
corresponds with the number needed for your piano sound. You will
see your program changing in your MIDI keyboard. Now move down
your event list to the fourth bar, first beat. You can use the down arrow
on the computer to scroll through the events. Now insert another 
program change and select a new mumber. Pres zero twice, then play.
RAVE will now change the sound of your MIDI keyboard at bar 4 to
your new sound.

RESTORE

Each time you leave the Tracklist page a safety copy of your work is
saved in a buffer. If you make changes which end up sounding
disastrous, selecting restore will replace the edited piece with the
safety copy. When you next return to the Tracklist page the safety copy
is deleted, making all changes you have made since you left the 
Tracklist page permanent, and a new copy is then created.

UNDO

The UNDO menu option can be used to go back one step if u have
made a mistake while editing. The UNDO function can be toggled back
and forth to try out an edit and compare it with teh unedited version, as
long as no further editing functions are performed.
The function keys F1-F6 cab be used to select DELETE MODE,
CHORD MODE, SHOW DEFAULTS, RESTORE, UNDO & HEX.

                                    25
THE DISC PAGE

To acces the disc page press d on your computer or click
on the small green square next to the Tempo display and then click on
Disc.

AMIGA NOTE: When accessing the disc page there will be a pause
before and after any disk operation, this is normal. RAVE uses its own
multi-tasking operating system to speed up MIDI communication.
However we use Amigados file system handling to ensure maximum
compatibility with the Amiga file system.. The pauses occur when the
AmigaDos is enabled and has to re-sync itself before use.

SAVING

Before you save anything make sure you have a blank formatted disk
in your drive (if working with floppy disks).

Now select whether you wish to save a SONG or TRACK by clicking on 
the appropriate button.
If you choose SONG, RAVE will save every part of your song, that is:
all tracks in your song, or block of music, and all information about the
data on those tracks. If you choose TRACK it will save only the track
currently selected. Click on SAVE and, if it is a song without a name,
you will be asked to give it a name. Type in the name and press return. If
you have already saved a song to disc you will find that when you

                                    26

come to save again, the name will already be there. If you want to
keep both pieces of work (thepiece you allready have on disc, plus the
work you have just done) then you must rename the song you are
about to save. Otherwise your work on disc will be replaced by the
work you are about to save. To rename the song use backspace, then
type in the new name.

Saving a track works in the same way.

LOADING

To re-load click on the SONG or TRACK you wish to load and click on
LOAD.
The Song file you load is not put into the current memory when loaded,
and you must acces it via the Block Window.  Click on this window
once with the right mouse button to access the file loaded. If you load
in a number of files you can scroll through them by clicking on the 
Block Window.

AMIGA NOTE: SWAPPING DISKS

To load/save from a disc other then the disc you booted up with, you
first must 'log' the disc into the drive:
There are two ways to do this:
From the disc page take out the program disc, then, with the left mouse
button, click on the drive in operation (df0, usually), this will instruct the
program to re-read the directory (empty in this cae as there is no disc
in the drive). Now put in the disc you want to read from or save to, and
then click again on the current drive name. This will read the directory
from the disc and then you can operate as usual.

If you are not in the disc page, you can short-cut this operation by
taking the program disc out of the drive before going to the disc page.
The program automaticaly reads the disc's directory on entering the
disc page, so you will find a blank direcotry window when you enter the
disc page. Insert the disc with the file you want to load and then click 
on Song or Track file type, the program will then read the disc's
directory, you can then load as usual.

WARNING!

DO NOT USE YOUR PROGRAM DISC FOR SAVING

                                    27

THE SAMPLING PAGE

To access the Sampler page select it from the page menu or press R
on your computer keyboard.

AMIGA NOTE: When accessing the Sampler page there will be a
pause before and after any disk operation, this is normal. RAVE uses
its own multi-tasking operating system to speed up MIDI 
communication. However we use Amigados for file handling to ensure
maximum compatibility with the Amiga file system. The pauses
occur when the AmigaDos is enabled and has to re-sync itself before use.

You can use any of the first 16 tracks in RAVE to store samples. Select
which track you require by clicking on it in the left hand screen window.
You may also select whether the required track will have sampled
sound or MIDI. It is also possible to delete a sample using a similar
methoed to that in the tracklist page.

To load a sample select the required file from the directory window and
choose load.

                                    28

SAMPLE TYPES:

AMIGA RAVE uses Amiga RAW samples taken at 12.4 KHz for middle
C. If you wish to use any other type of sample it must be converted
using a sample editor of which there are many available for the Amiga.
Noet that you can load any file into RAVE and play it out as a sample.

ATARI RAVE: The Atari uses .AVR samples.

PLAYING A SAMPLE

On loading the sample will play at once. To include it within your music
first return to the Tracklist page. Now move the mouse pointer to the
MIDI channel display for the track on which you have loaded your
sample and click both buttons. You will see and exclamation mark !
This means that RAVE will now play samples on this track. Click again
with both buttons to trun sample playing off.

Provied that there is note information in your selected track and an 
exclamation mark next to the MIDI channel number you will hear
samples next time you play this track.

Note:- For reasons of speed the sample playing facility only uses obe
sound channel. Thus it is only possible to play back one sample at a
time, any overlap of samples will cut off the first one when the second
is triggered.

AMIGA NOTE: The Amiga RAVE program allows you to play your
sample at different pitches. By playing your MIDI keyboard you will hear
your sample at different pitch values for about 1 octave either side of
Middle C. There is a point at which pitch ceases to increase, but with
bass pitches, after about an octave the sound begins to beak up and
sound 'dirty', which may be of interest to users.

                                    29

THE SET-UP PAGE

The Set-Up page allows you to customise some of the features of
RAVE.

USER NAME

You can enter your name here and it will be saved with your block of
music.

TIMING CLOCK

This option sets RAVE to run either from its internal clock, or
synchronised with an extrernal MIDI clock. To run RAVE from a MIDI
clock source, click in the box named "EXT".

MIDI ECHO

When switched to ON this function, often called software thru, echoe
any data sent to the computer's MIDI-im port to its MIDI-out port. This
allows you to hear the part you are playing on another synth or
expander that is connected to the MIDI out socked, without havin gto
use a complicated system of MIDI wiring to cope with the sequencer's
recording and playback modes. In most cases you will want to set this
to 'ON' and that is its default value. If set to 'OFF' MIDI ECHO echoes
all MIDI channels. This should be used if the keyboard you are using to
play in your MIDI data does not have a 'local off' switch, to stop that
keyboard being triggered twice - by its won keyboard and also by MIDI

                                    30

returning through the computer. Set the loop filter to the same MIDI
channel as your keyboard, and that MIDI channel will not re-trigger the
synth when it is played (but MIDI data on that channel that has been
recored into the sequencer will still be sent when RAVE is played).

CLOCK SEND

When switched 'ON' RAVE sends MIDI start, stop, clocks and song
pointer messages, to allow external MIDI devices to be synchronised,
using RAVE as the master. The default setting is 'OK', but, if you are
not synchronising any external equipment to RAVE it may be best to
switch to 'OFF', to make more space in the MIDI data stream.

LOOP FILTER

When selected the 'LOOP FILTER' switches off MIDI ECHO for one
channel only. The required channel is set in the value box next to the
'loop filter' label.

We hope you have gun with RAVE. .......  SO DOES GLOBAL OVER DOSE 8-)
