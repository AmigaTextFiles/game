Ok well I'm no craker and my name is probably like an ant compared to 
the Grates such as IBM and FFC but I just thougt some people might 
like to know how to edit the roster in Gunship 2000...


This is what I'v figured out.....


The Codes in the Light green box 
02020202 020200202   These represent how many And what meddles you 
have.....

The Code the the Dark Green Box
0900 This represents your rank...

The Code in the Yellow box
100 this represents you status i.e. Active inactive dead shit like    
that. All you have to know is that ...100... = Active...



If you figure anything else out leave me a message on Beyond Paridise 
at +212-888-4773 in the USA... Cool ok   



Xelsed out.
