                            REQUIRED EQUIPMENT
                            ------------------

 COMPUTER - This simulation requires a Commodore Amiga with at least 1 MB of
 Ram.   If  you  intend to install the simulation onto a hard disk 1.5 MB of
 Ram is required.
 
 CONTROLS  -  Gunship 2000 can be run entirely from the keyboard, with mouse
 and  keyboard  or  with  joystick and keyborad.  An analog joystick greatly
 improves the feel and realism, and is therefore strongly recommended.
 
 DISK  DRIVES  -  Gunship 2000 can be installed onto 3.5" floppy disks.  You
 will  need  a  set of four blank disks for this.  However, it works best if
 installed onto a hard disk drive.
 
                           INSTALLATION CONCEPTS
                           ---------------------
 
 Important:  Gunship 2000 should not be played from the original disks.  You
 must  either  copy  the  original disks onto backup floppy disks or use the
 install program to create a subdirectory on your hard disk.  If you attempt
 to  play  from  the  original disks they will become permanently altered as
 they   are  updated  as  the  simulation  runs.   Please  do  not  use  any
 commercially  ( or otherwise) available copy program - use the one provided
  for  you on the disk.  No other copy program will work, and Microprose will
 not  accept responsibility for any damage caused by copying programs except
 the one provided.
 
 INSTALLING  ON  FLOPPY  DISKS  -  Gunship 2000 has no disk copy protection.
 Insert  yuor  original  Disk  1 and switch on your computer.  A screen will
 appear  which  allows  you  to copy your original disks.  Please follow any
 on-screen prompts.  You will need a set of four blank disks.
 
 INSTALLING  ON HARD DISK - Boot up your hard disk as normal and insert disk
 1.   Open  this disk and double-click on the "Install" icon.  Please follow
 any  on-screen prompts.  A drawer labelled "GS2000" will be created on your
 hard disk, containing all necessary files.
 
                            RUNNING GUNSHIP 2000
                            --------------------
 
 LOADING  FROM FLOPPY DISK - If your computer has Kickstart in ROM, turn off
 your  computer  and  insert your backup disk 1.  Power up the computer, and
 the  program  will  auto-load.  If your computer does not have Kickstart in
 ROM,  load  the  Kickstart  as  normal,  insert  your  backup disk 1 at the
 workbench  prompt,  and  the  program  will  auto-load,  Please  follow any
 on-screen prompts requesting disk changes.
 
 HARD DISK - Boot up your hard disk as normal.  Open the "GS2000" drawer and
 double click on the Gunship icon.
 
                                SAVING GAMES
                                ------------
 
 HARD DISK - Your games will be saved to the drawer containing Gunship 2000.
 FLOPPY  DISK - Your games are saved onto your backup game disks.  You don`t
 need an additional save-game disk.
 
                                   REPLAYS
                                   -------
 In  programming  the Amiga version we were faced with difficult choices; we
 knew  that  it would be very difficult to include all the features from the
 IBM  PC  version  and  maintain  the  speed  of  the 3D and include all the
 features.   We  are pleased to sat that we have kept the screen update rate
 very  high;  unfortunately,  memory  restrictions  have  meant  loss of the
 "REPLAY" facility.
 
 Later  in  the manual it explains events after the completion of a mission.
 After  receiving any decorations you have earned you will return to brigade
 headquarters.  Please ignore reference to "Mission Replays" in the manual.
 
                            CONFIGURATION SCREEN
                            --------------------
 
 When  in  flight,  pause the game and press "C" to access the configuration
 screen.   This  allows  you to alter your method of control, and to set the
 detail  level.   Increasing detail may delay screen updates, aand initially
 set  on  "medium  detail"  which  is  fine for basic Amigas.  If you have a
 powerfull  machine,  increase  the detail level, if you want a faster game,
 reduce the detail level.
 
                               VERSION UPDATE
                               --------------
 
 The  latest  notes regarding this program,additions, revisions etc.  can be
 found  on  disk 1, in an ASCII file named "READ.ME".  You can read the file
 using  standard  AmigaDOS  commands, eg.  "Type".  "More" ( These utilities
 can be found on the Workbenck disk ).

                                  --------
 
 A NOTE ABOUT SELECTORS - Throughout the manual and technical supplement you
 will  find references to selectors. A selector is a button or key which you
 must  press  to  make a choice or initiate an action, and vary according to
 the method of control being used.
 
                   KEYBOARD             JOYSTICK           MOUSE
 
 Selector 1        Return key           Fire button        Left button 
 Selector 2        Backspace key        Backspace key      Right button
 
 A  NOTE ABOUT KEYBOARDS - If you need to hold down the "Alt" or "Shift" key
 with  another  key, make sure to press the "Alt" or "Shift" first.  Keep it
 down  while  pressing  the other key, then release the "Alt" or "Shift" key
 last.  Otherwise, you may get erratic keyboard results.

                                INTRODUCTION
                                ------------
 
                                THE MISSION
                                -----------
 
 All around you in the TOC sit the other squadron flight commanders; tension
 covers  the  the  area  like  a  blanket.  As you rip open your orders, the
 anticipation  grabs at your gut, but you already know the score.  No breaks
 here; your flight always pulls the tough assignments.  Another SEAD mission
 deep  into  enemy  territiry,  Those  fast movers need you to clear the way
 again.   Doesn't  the TF know that your luck can't hold out forever?  Sure,
 your success rate is the highest in the squadron, but.....
 
 You  gaze at the mission map.  The primary is 20 klicks behind enemy lines-
 they must be kidding.  Your boys best be sharp tonight.  Better get over to
 the  armourer's  tent.  At least you'll get first choice on ordnance; being
 number  one  does  have  benefits.   Apaches  and Kiowa Warriors are on tap
 tonight.   Plenty  of  Hellfires and Mark 261 MPSM rockets to go round.  No
 need  for  any  AA  loads this trip.  Is the opposition the only ones smart
 enough  not to fly during these conditions?  The S2 better be right on this
 one.
 
 You climb into the rear seat of your Apache.  You've never quite understood
 the  feeling,  but  the closeness and tight fit is somehow comforting.  You
 pre-flight the cockpit switches.  You could run through this in your sleep,
 but  SOP says otherwise - everything must be by the book.  As you light off
 the APU your CP/G gives the thumbs-up.  The other four pilots in the flight
 are  looking to you for the sign.  Although it's pitch black, you can still
 read the concern on their faces; but they're good to go.  Time to get these
 birds airborne.  You key the commo switch, "Wind 'em up!"
 
 Three-quarters  of the way there and no sightings.  Just a milk run so far;
 lady  luck  must  still  be  along for the ride.  This is too good to last.
 You"re  getting  a bit green-eyed from the glow of the FLIR's eyepiece, but
 without  it  you'dquickly  get  close  and  personal  with  some unforeseen
 hillside.  Skimming the treetops at 120 knots is quite a rush, but any kind
 of altitude spells nothing but bad news.
 
 The  MFD  indicates  that  waypoint  3 is just ahead; time to assume attack
 positions.  Captain Arthur in Zulu-4 will lead the light section; as usual,
 the  heavy  section is with you -Zulu-1.  Your call goes out "Light section
 break right, heavy section left on me, weapons free." "Roger breaking now,"
 replies Zulu-4.
 
 The  APR-39  is  starting  to  chirp, and those blips on the threat display
 definitely  aren't  friendlies.   "Jack,  select  MPSM,"  you  call to your
 front-seater  over the ICS.  "All units, prepare to unmask.  Engage as they
 bear."
 
 As  you come up the TADS paints a pretty picture of the target.  There they
 are,  big as you please - SA-13's and 'Zoo'.  But this is no time to admire
 the  scenery,  there's work to be done.  "Targets bearing 335!", calls Jack
 not all too calmly.  "Weapons in constraints, MPSM away!:  you respond with
 equal gusto.
 
 The rocket sub-munitions burst on the target with a tremendous white flash,
 followed  by a series of secondary explosions.  "Those guys are toast!" you
 hear Jack call out to no-one in particular.  So much for radio integrity.
 
 You've  certainly  got  their  attention  now.  The threat display is going
 wild;  enemy units are popping up at every clock position.  The apr's radar
 warning  indicator light turns a solid, glaring red as the klaxon blares in
 your headset.  You're being tracked!
 
 "Jammer  active,  chaff  out!   Peg  him  Jack!" you call out while quickly
 pushing  the  Apache  down  and  to the right.  You glance over just as the
 enemy  missile  explodes  harmlessly  in  the  chaff  cloud.   "I'm on him.
 Swiching  to  Hellfire,"  Jack  responds.   A short flash, and the Hellfire
 reaches  out  to  find  its  target.   Jack's head is glued to his display.
 He'll  keep  the  target locked in the sight until the Hellfire impacts.  A
 bright  light  blooms  off  to the left as the target evaporates from view.
 Scratch another one!
 
 The ground explodes as rockets and Hellfires slam into the hapless targets.
 You  know that it's only a matter of time.  There's no hope for those guys;
 the surprise was too perfect.
 
 Minutes  later,  not  a  single target is active.  And, a good thing too as
 you've expended most of your ordnance.  Its time to pull pitch and head for
 home.  "Zulu's form on me.  Let's get out of here.  Well done!"
 
 Back  at  the TOC you and the other flight commanders are preparing for the
 debrief.   As you sit and wait your turn, a smile slowly cracks across your
 face, just another successful mission.
 
 You knew it all the time.

                                  OVERVIEW
                                  --------
 
 Gunship  2000  is  a  detailed  presentation of the art of present and near
 future  helicopter  combat  operations.   You can control just one or up to
 five  distinct  helicopters.   The current and planned versions of the most
 prevalent  U.S.  Army helicopters are available for the choosing.  Not just
 a bystander, you actually pilot one of the Army's top helicopters.
 
 You  start  out  as  a Warrant Officer Candidate (WOC) at the Army Aviation
 Centre,  Fort  Ruckner, Alabama.  Here you select your squadron and provide
 its  nickname.  More importantly, you get the necessary training to prepare
 you  for  the  difficult challenge of helicopter combat.  You determine the
 reality  or  difficulty of the training.  It can be as simple or as hard as
 you  desire;  the  advantage  here,  you  can  take  your time and can't be
 damaged.   Plus  you  can  return  to training any time to brush up on your
 skills.
 
 Upon  completion, you are promoted to Warrant Officer (WO1), and move on to
 single  helicopter missions.  Here you command and fly a single helicopter,
 in  one  of two theaters, against opposing forces in a variety of missions.
 The  rank  of  commissioned officer awaits your success; and upon receiving
 your  commission,  the  door  opens to the endless variety and challenge of
 Flight and Campaign missions.
 
 In  the Flight missions you are not only an active member of, but command a
 flight  of  five  helicopters.   You  determine  the mix of helicopters and
 ordnance  required  to  complete the mission.  How well you employ your own
 helicopter,  plus command the other four helicopters determines the success
 or failure of the missions.
 
 The  Campaign  Mission places you in a situation of continuous combat where
