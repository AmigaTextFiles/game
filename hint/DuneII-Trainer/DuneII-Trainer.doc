			DuneII-Trainer
			~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This little programm runs in multitasking and allows to increase your amount
of credits and to pinch the credits of your enemies.

 Installation:
 - All what you have to do is to start my programm; it will wait in the
 background until DuneII has been started and then open a window.
 - If you have no harddisc you can copy my programm and the file "run" from
 your workbench-disk on the disc named "DuneII_1" and insert:
 "run DuneII-Trainer" in the first line of the startup-sequence of the disc.

I take no responsibility for any damages caused while using this program.

Question: Does somebody know if a verion of Command and Conquer for the Amiga
exists?
=> I can't understand why nobody makes a version of WarcraftII which runs
on the Amiga. O.K., C&C needs a PowerMac but WarcraftII can also be used
with a 68040. Why do I first have to run a Mac-emulator if I want play
WarcraftII ?
