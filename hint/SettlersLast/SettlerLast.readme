This is a save file for the very end of the last level for 'The Settlers'.
Just copy the files SettlerArchive and SettlerSave0 to your Settlers game
drawer, and load up the save game in 'Settlers'.  Just attack the 2 nearest
Guard Rooms, and when you have taken them you will get the end of game
sequence.
