We  are  proud  to  bring you this upgrade of our classic gome F-19 Stealth
Fighter.   That  game  has  been  one  of the most successful combat flight
simulators ever developed.  It has won just about every award that is given
for  entertainment  software, and we think we know why:  F-19 had excellent
game-play it was FUN!

Because  of this, F-117A keeps that same great game-play and brings you the
very  latest  in flight simulation technology and graphics.  We've upgraded
the  entire  package from head to toe, but we've kept the basic features of
F-19 intact

So if you're already familiar with F-19 Stealth Fighter, you should be able
to jump right into the cockpit and start flying stealthy sorties right away

But  be  careful,  the  enemy  is  smarter,  your  plane  is  a little more
responsive,  you  fly  almost all your sorties at night, and there are more
new missions than you hope to complete in a lifetime of flying.

We hope you enjoy it!

INTRODUCTION: F-117A NIGHTHAWK
------------------------------

Target Iraq

BAGHDAD,  January  17,  1991.  The still darkness of early morning suddenly
gave  way  to  the  flash  and roar of exploding bombs, Iraqi anti-aircraft
artillery  (AAA)  batteries  began  firing wildly into the sky, not knowing
what or where their targets were.

Operation Desert Storm had begun.

Within  a  few  short moments, key Iraqi early warning radar sites, control
centres  and  communication  links were destroyed by unseen attackers.  The
attackers  -  US  F-117A  "stealth"  fighters had flown through hundreds of
miles  of heavily defended Iraqi airspace undetected, and hit their targets
with  precise  timing and pinpoint accuracy Almost instantly, the Iraqi air
defense command found itself deaf dumb and blind

The performance of "stealth" fighters during the first day of the war alone
was enough to vindicate the "block" (secret) progroms that had led to their
development  and  construction.   On  the  first  day:   the  F-117As which
comprised  only two and a half percent of the coalition's combat air forces
accounted  for  31  percent  of the Iraqi targets hit.  The impact of these
raids  assured  the air supremacy of the allied air forces and allowed them
to strike with impunity anywhere within Iraq and Kuwait

That   a   single   type   of  aircraft,  unremarkable  in  its  speed  and
maneuverability  and  built  almost  in  direct conflict with the long-held
conventions  of  aircraft  design  could have such a decisive effect on the
outcome of a war is almost unbelievable.  Other technological breakthroughs
have  proven  decisive  in war:  the machine gun, the tank and the airplane
are  all examples.  But advantages gained by these advances were so quickly
cancelled  by  other  breakthroughs  that  they had little time to make any
significant  impact.   The Norden bombsight, for example, was an impressive
technological   achievement   that  was  quickly  made  obsolete  by  other
technology - like the atom bomb

Radar Wars

In  the  1920s  and  early 1930s, the bomber was believed by many to be the
ultimate  weapon.   Theorists  like  Italy's General Guilio Douhet believed
that  massed  bomber raids would be unstoppable - bombers would be overhead
and  dropping  their  bombs before they were sighted, and well on their way
home before fighters could be scrambled to intercept them.

But  in  the  late  1930s,  the  work  of  Sir Robert Watson-Watt and other
researchers  resulted  in  a practical method of detecting aircraft well in
advance  of  their  arrival  radio detection and ranging, or "radar." Radar
allowed  defenders  to  not  only  detect  enemy  aircraft,  but  to obtain
information on the strength of a raid, its speed and its course.

Radar  detects  objects  by  transmitting  a  high-energy radio pulse.  The
signal  bounces off the object, and the reflected signal is detected by the
radars  antenna.   The  direction from which the reflected signal comes and
the  time  difference between when the pulse was transmitted and the return
of  the reflected signal are used to determine the bearing and range of the
object.

Early  ground  radar  installations proved to be a decisive factor in World
War  II  notably  during  the Battle of Britain (1940-1941).  The Royal Air
Force  was  able  to effectively scramble interceptor fighters to meet Nazi
bombing  raids  and turn the tide of the air war because of the information
provided by early warning radar sites.  Soon, radar systems became accurate
enough  to  be used to control ground based anti- aircraft artillery (AAA),
and  compact  enough to be used aboard aircraft.  Within a few years, night
fighters  were able to engage and shoot down enemy aircraft that they never
saw.

Targeting  radar  systems used a constant wave rather than a pulse to track
the  target,  and  used  two  antennas  a  transmitter and a receiver.  The
targetting  radar  tracked  its quarry by centering the signal reflected by
the  target  in  its beam, and "locked on" to it, constantly correcting its
beam  to  follow the targets movement.  Since the wave was constant, shifts
in the signal's frequency caused by the movement of the target the "Doppler
effect"  could  be detected by the receiver antenna.  The wavelength of the
radio  wave  is  compressed  by  an  object  moving  toward  the radar, and
stretched  out  by  an  object  moving away - like the sound waves from the
whistle  of  a  passing  train  A  "Doppler  shift" of the returning radar,
therefore, could be used for moving target indication (MTI).  Modern search
radar systems also have this capability

Surface-to  air  missiles  were  quickly  developed  that  could follow the
targetting  radar beam to their intended target.  These "beam riders" sense
the  reflection of the targeting radar off the enemy aircraft, and homed in
like  bloodhounds.   The sky was quickly becoming an increasingly dangerous
place.

Stealthy Planes

Since  the  Second  World  War,  evading  or  negating radar has been a top
priority  of  aircraft  designers  and  air forces.  Most efforts relied on
active  countermeasures jamming of radar signals, use of "chaff" (strips of
aluminum  or  fibreglass to create false radar returns, and the use of anti
radar  weapons  to  eliminate  the  threat  of enemy air defense radar.  In
addition  to  these active methods, many aircraft (like the FB-111,B-1, and
the British Tornado) were designed specifically to fly close to the ground,
using terrain features and the curvature of the earth to avoid detection by
radar.

Still,  the  increasing  sophistication  and  sensitivity of radar systems,
radar  guided  missiles and air defense systems continued to complicate the
lives  of  pilots.   The development of digitally controlled radar systems,
like the "phased- array" radar systems used in the Navy's Aegis system, the
Patriot  missile system and many other modern air defense systems, has made
it  difficult  to  jam  or  otherwise  neutralize the effectiveness of such
systems.   These  radars  can  increase  signal  strength to "burn through"
jamming,  change the frequency of their pulses randomly to counteract chaff
and  other  electronic  countermeasures,  and  digitally  enhance  returned
signals

Evasion  of radar by flying close to the terrain was made more difficult by
the  development  of  airborne early warning systems (AEWS) like the US air
Forces  AWACS  system,  and  by  the  development  of "look-down" radar for
fighter  interceptions.  These airborne radar platforms can detect aircraft
flying  at  very low altitudes, and have a much longer detection range than
ground-based systems simply because they are in the air.

In  addition  to  the improvements in radar technology, the introduction of
computers  into  air  defense  systems  made  the latter more efficient and
effective.  Computers and information technology have increased the flow of
information through command structures and have decreased the reaction time
of defensive system to incoming attacks.

Today,  "electronic  warfare"  has  become  as important as the delivery of
weapons      Electronic      countermeasures     are     pitted     against
counter-countermeasures  as  both  defender  and attacker attempt to render
each  other's  electronic systems impotent Attack aircraft must be escorted
by  specialized  electronic  warfare  aircraft  and  must  carry  their own
countermeasures as well.

"Stealth" technology takes another approach to reducing the threat posed by
enemy  radar.  Rather than depending on electronics, the physical design of
the  "stealth"  aircraft  is its main radar countermeasure.  Two factors in
the  design  of an aircraft play a part in how well it can be detected by a
radar  the  amount  of  surface  area  it  presents  to  the radar, and the
reflectivity  of  that  surface.   The  range  at which an aircraft (or any
object)  can  be detected is in part determined by the amount of reflective
surface  it  presents to the radar, or its "radar cross section" (RCS).  As
the  radar  cross  section of an object is decreased, the range at which it
can  be detected is decreased.  By decreasing the RCS of an aircraft, it is
made  less vulnerable to detection by enemy radar.  The main design barrier
to  reducing  the  RCS  of aircraft has been the difficulty in modeling the
design to predict it.

In  addition  to  decreasing  the  cross  section  of  an  aircraft design,
designers can decrease the aircraft's probability of detection by making it
less  reflective  of  radar.   By using special materials that absorb radio
waves,  an  aircraft  can  reduce its radar reflection.  In this way, radar
absorbent  materials (RAMs) effectively reduce the aircrafts RCS, making it
less detectable.

RAMs were developed during the Second World War on both sides - the Germans
used  one type of RAM on the snorkel tubes of their U-Boats to prevent them
from  being  detected  by  airborne  radars.   Still,  RAMs  alone are only
partially  effective  in  reducing  reflected  radar  signals,  and may not
appreciably change the RCS of an object by themselves.

"Stealth"  technology  relies  on  a  combination  of  these  two methods -
reducing  RCS  by  design  and  reducing  reflectivity  by RAMs.  The first
marriage  of  the two came in the form of an experimental aircraft produced
by  Lockheed's top-secret "Skunk Works" in the early 1960s.  That aircraft,
the A-12, became the prototype for the premier reconnais- sance aircraft of
the 20th Century - the SR-71 Blackbird.

The  A-12 came in response to a call from the CIA for a replacement for the
U-2  spy  plane.   To  reduce  its  radar cross-section, the A12 featured a
slender  profile,  the  elimination  of  vertical flat surfaces, and flared
sides.   Saw-toothed  indentations  in the leading edge of the A-12's wings
were  designed  to  deflect  radar  waves  away  from  the transmitter.  In
addition,  the  entire  aircraft  was  painted with a radar absorbant paint
called "iron ball."

The  radar  cross-section  of the A-12 was only 0.015 square meters - about
one  thirtieth  the RCS of a conventional fighter.  Still, the A-12 was far
from  being  invisible  to  radar.  While the A-12 had a fairly small radar
cross-section  head  on  it presented a huge radar and infrared target from
behind.   It  had  large,  open  titanium and steel jet exhaust nozzles and
afterburning  engines.   This  did not pose much of a problem though, since
the  A-12  could  outrun anything fired at it from behind - it flew at Mach
3.5  at  an  altitude  of 95,000 feet.  By the time it could be detected by
radar,  there  was  little  time left for any reaction, and by the time air
defenses could be brought to bear, the A-12 would be long gone.

F-117A Nighthawk

Lockheed  built  upon  its  experience  with the A-12 and its offspring the
SR-71  in  the  development  of the F-117.  In the mid 1970s, the "stealth"
concept  was  revieved in reac- tion to the world political climate and the
need  for a "special operations aircraft.  Key to the success of the design
was  the concept of a "faceted" surface with no curved surfaces anywhere on
the aircraft.

The  reason  for  the  faceted design of the F-117 lies in the equations of
James  Clerk Maxwell, a Scottish physicist, Maxwell's equations can predict
how  a  body  of  a  given  shape  will  scatter or reflect electromagnetic
radiation  (such  as  radio  waves).   With  relatively  simple shapes, the
results are relatively easy to calculate.

In an aircraft with an "aerodynamic," curved surface, the complex shape and
gradual  curves  of  the  aircraft  make applying Maxwell's equation a feat
which  even  the most powerful supercomputer may balk.  However, if all the
curves  are removed from the design and replaced with geometric facets, the
reflection   pattern  becomes  much  easier  to  predict.   Using  computer
modeling,  aircraft designers were able to create a design with practically
no  radar  cross-section.   The  combination  of its shape and RAM give the
F-117  an  RCS  of  between  0.01  square  meters  and  0.001 square meters
depending  on  the radar.  (This is roughly the same RCS as a small bird or
insect).

With the flat surfaces of a faceted design, radar pulses are only reflected
back  to  the  radar when they strike the surfaces dead on (at 90° angles).
All  of  the F-117s surfaces are tilted at least 30° away from vertical, so
almost  all  radar  signals  will  be  bounced upward or downward.  While a
look-down  radar  may  detect the aircraft if it is 30° above it, the radar
would have to be at extremely close range at that angle

While  the faceted surface of the F-117 makes it nearly invisible to radar,
it  also  makes  the aircraft extremely difficult to fly.  In fact, without
the aircrafts computerized control system, it would be impossible to fly at
all.   Rather  than being directly connected to the control surfaces of the
aircraft, the pilot's controls are connected to four computer ers, which in
turn  move  the  control surfaces.  This type of control system is commonly
referred to as a "fly-by-wire" system.

The  design  of the F-117 not only minimizes the aircrafts detectability by
radar,  but  by  all other means as well infrared, optical, and electronic.
Surveillance.    The   aircraft  is  painted  flat  black  it  is  designed
specifically for night operations - and its engine exhausts are shielded to
minimize  their  heat signature.  And the aircraft has no radar of its own,
so it cannot be detected by electromagnetic sensors.

Since  it  has  no  radar,  the  F-117  relies  heavily  upon  its inertial
navigation  system  and  its  infrared sensing equipment to get it over the
target  and  deliver weapons on target.  The F-117 uses a laser designator,
its  forward-looking and downward looking infrared (FLIR ond DLIR) to guide
its "smart bombs" to their targets.  With the assistance of AWACS aircraft,
the  F-117  can use its FLIR to target hostile aircraft as well through its
anti-air  capability  is  somewhat  limited without radar-guided air to air
missiles

All  of  the F-117's weapons are carried internally, in twin bays along its
centre line This is necessary to maintain the constant RCS of the aircraft.
While  this  limits  the  weapons  load of the F-117, it makes up for it in
accuracy and surprise.

The  Air  Force  already is planning significant upgrades to the F-117.  If
the  budget  allows, 40 new aircraft may be added to the existing 56 planes
in  service.   One of the possible additions to the new F-117 is a stealthy
radar  system,  which  may give the F-117 similar radar capabilities to the
F-15.  Another possible sensor for the upgraded F-117 is an Infrared Search
and  Track  (IRS7)  system  a  wide scanning infrared sensor that can track
targets much like radar, but without any emissions to detect.

What Next?

There  are no clear answers to the "stealth" problem for air defense system
designers.   If  there  are  any  solutions already tested, they are highly
classified.  While highly speculative, these are some of the possible "next
steps" for air defense systems in reaction to stealth technology within the
limits  of  present  technology,  the  best way to detect aircraft like the
F-117 is from above.  Look down radar systems have a much higher likelihood
of  detecting stealth aircraft than ground-based radar, simply be- cause of
their angle of attack.

Still,  stealth  aircraft are high-altitude flyers by nature, and a counter
stealth  look-  down  system  would have to be at a fairly high altitude to
have much of a chance at long range detection of them.

One  possibility  is an airborne early warning system based on aerostats or
blimps.   Aerostat radar systems are alreody used by the US as regional AEW
platforms  for drug interdiction in the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean; while
these  systems operate at comparatively low altitudes, the technology might
be adapted to the high altitude AEW role.

Another  possibility  is  a sort of radar "trip wire" system.  While ground
based  radar  signals  may  be bounced away from their origin by the angled
surfaces  of  the  F-117  a ring of secondary radar receivers at long range
from  the main radar might be able to pick up such deflected signals.  Such
a  receiver  would not be able to give altitude or course information about
an  aircraft, but it might give air defense commanders a fair approximation
of  bearing  and range from the main radar and some warning of an impending
"stealth"  attack.   Other  sensors  could  then  be brought to bear on the
suspected aircraft and, in the worst case, backup systems could be prepared
to come on line.

While  stealth  aircraft are designed to deflect or absorb radio waves they
are  not  designed  to  do  the  same  to laser beams.  There has been much
discussion  of  possible  LADAR  (loser  detection and raging) systems that
operate  in a fashion similar to search radars, scanning the sky with loser
energy  and  looking  for  laser light bouncing off of objects to determine
their  direction,  range  and speed.  Such a system in an air early warning
role  would  require  a huge amount of energy and would probably incinerate
anything  that  got  too  close to it (though that may be a positive effect
too).

Clearly,  though,  stealth  technology  will  force air defense planners to
seriously  rethink  their strategies.  It has already made nearly every air
early warning system in the world obsolete, and has permanently changed the
complexion  of  air  strike doctrine Already, designers are struggling with
this  new  problem.   Who knows what will come next?  Perhaps the people at
Lockheed's "Skunk Works" do.

F-117A TUTORIAL
---------------

Flying To The Targets And Back

This  tutorial  guides  you through your first stealth mission.  You`ll fly
from  an  aircraft  carrier  in the Mediterranean Sea into Libyan airspace.
There  you`ll  destroy  a  surface to air missile (SAM) radar installation.
This  mission is a practise run, and flying it is not required; it's purely
a  convenient  way  to help you learn to use your F-117A.  If you prefer to
study the aircraft before you fly, go directly to Chapter 2 page 27.

Before  you start, install the game onto either floppy disks or a hard disk
(see  "Installation" in the Technical Supplement for details).  You can run
the  game  without installation, but no information is saved.  Now load the
installed   game  into  your  computer  (see  "Loading"  in  the  Technical
Supplement for details).

Terminology

Each  key control has a name in italics, and is followed by a parenthesized
label,  indicating  which  key  is referred to by the name.  The italicized
names used in this manual also appear on the keyboard overlay.

Controller  refers to the pointing device you use.  This may be a joystick,
mouse  or cursor keys.  We strongly recommend you use a joystick to fly the
aircraft,  and  a  mouse  to make selections on the string screens.  Only a
joystick  or  the keyboard may be used to fly the airplane; however, any of
the above may be used to make selections from the starting screens.

Selector  refers  to the Left Mouse Button, Joystick Trigger, Return key or
Enter key, depending on your hardware setup.  When the manual says to press
the  Selector,  this  means to press the button (or Return key) of whatever
hardware you`re using.

Preflight Briefing Options

Answer  the  Aircraft  Identification  Quiz:   Check  pages 164-172 of this
manual to See which aircraft is illustrated.

Pilot  Roster:   After  answering the quiz, you are shown the Pilot Roster,
where  you  must enter a name.  Use the Controller to move the arrow cursor
over  the  name  you  want  to  erase (note that the names highlight as the
cursor  moves over them).  Press the Backspace key to erase the highlighted
name, type your own name, and press the Selector

A  form  now  appears to the right of the screen, on which you can set some
difficulty  level  options.   Since  this is your first mission, accept the
default  options,  by selecting "Form Complete" at the bottom.  Then select
"Exit" from the lower right of the screen.

Ready  Room:   You  now  find  yourself in the pilot s' Ready Room, you are
automatically  to  be  given  orders.   Notice that there are several doors
which  you  can  enter.   But for now simply move the arrow to the Briefing
Room door and tap the Selector.

Intelligence   Briefing:   When  you  enter  the  Briefing  Room,  you  are
automatically  assigned  a  mission.   The  briefing  map shows the general
topography  of  the  area  your  takeoff  point  (T),  your primary (P) and
secondary  (S) targets, and your landing point (L).  To the right is a menu
of  options.  Select "Mission Brief" to read a detailed description of what
you  are  expected to accomplish.  Then press the Selector again to see the
remainder of the summary, which describes your flight plan and the rules of
engagement  under which you are operating.  Now press the Selector again to
return to the briefing map.

You  may  wish  to  investigote  the other options on this map.  If so, see
"Briefing  Room"  on  page  33 for details.  When you are finished studying
your mission assignment, choose "Select Weapons" from the menu.

Arming  Room:   Next you are shown the weapons your crew chief suggests you
use  for this mission.  You could override his decisions and take different
weapons  but  For this training exercise, take his advice and choose "Go To
Hangar" from the menu at lower right.

Hangar:   You're  now  in the Hangar, where your F-117A is being fueled and
loaded  for  the  mission.   Select  "Yes"  from the requestor that asks if
you're ready.

Select  Target  (B):   Cycles  through  all standard targets in the current
direction

Designate  New  Targ (N):  Aims forward camera at nearest target (any type)
ahead

For more information on the target tracking-camera system, see page 45.

The  HUD:   The  upper  half  of your screen represents the transparent HUD
(heads  up  display),  through  which  you  can  see the world beyond.  The
various symbols and numbers are described in Chapter 2, on pages 40-44.

The  HUD  has  three  operating  modes:  NAV for navigation, AIR for aerial
combat,  and  GND  for ground attacks.  Tap HUD Modes (F2) to cycle through
the  three  settings Note that in AIR and GND modes the symbols that appear
depend  on the currently selected weapon.  Tap Select Weapon (Space Bar) to
cycle  through  your weapons.  If you're unsure of what weapons you have on
board,  tap  Weapons  (F5)  to see a display of your four weapons bays, and
what they contain.

Hints

To get the most out of this tutorial, remember three things:

There  is  no  danger:  Since this is a training mission, enemy weapons are
harmless  You`ve chosen the "No Crash" option.  So you can`t crash into the
ground.  Furthur you have an automatic radar altimeter that keeps you above
200'.   However,  it  only  makes mild corrections, and is helpless against
truly wild maneuvers.

Use  the  "Pause"  Key:   To  best  use this tutorial, pause the game - tap
pause.   (alt/P) and read the next few paragraphs, then "un-pause" (tap any
key)  and  resume  the action.  Whenever you're confused, pause and consult
the manual for help.

Resupply  if  you  need  it:  In training missions, you can get an infinite
supply  of  fuel  and ammunition.  Each time you tap Resupply (Alt/R), your
fuel  tank  is  filled  and  your  ammunition  is  increased to the maximum
possible level.

Preflight Checklist

Check  the  Inertial  Navigation System (INS).  Tap Maps (F3) until the sat
ellite/radar  map  is  displayed  on your left MFD.  Next tap Select Way Pt
(F7)  to  display  the INS waypoints list on the right MFD.  Look up on the
HUD and note on the horizontal heading scale (along the top of the HUD) the
location  of  the INS cursor (blue triangle) You must fly in this direction
to reach the first waypoint (see page 53 for details)

Check  Armament:   Tap  Weapons (F5) to display the weapons in your bays on
the  right MFD.  As you use Select Weapons (Space Bar) to cycle through the
weapons,  note  the  active  weapon message in the lower left corner of the
HUD.

Extend  the Flaps:  Tap Flaps (9).  Note the "FLAPS" indicator light in the
upper  right  section  of  the  console.   Flaps  give you more lift during
takeoff.

Check  the  Catapult:   When launching from an aircraft carrier, as you are
now  the  brakes must be set.  This represents the aircraft's attachment to
the  carriers  catapult system.  If the "BRAKE" light is not illuminated on
the console, tap Brake (0) to set the brakes and engage the catapult.

Start  the  Engines:   Turn  on  your engines by tapping Max Pwr (Shift +).
Notice  the  digital  throttle  power  readout increase to 100 in the lower
right of the console (this represents 100% power).

Activate  Catapult:   When the throttle readout shows 100% power, tap Brake
(0) to release the brakes and catapult your F-117A off the deck.

Accelerate  Past  Stall  Speed:  As you zoom down the deck, watch the speed
scale (left side of the HUD) carefully.  A bar on that scale will gradually
drop  down.   This  is  the  Stall  Speed  Indicator.  When the Stall Speed
Indicator  bar  drops  below the cetre tick on the scale your plane is past
stall speed and you're travelling fast enough to climb into the sky.

Climb:   Once  you're  flying  more  than  10 knots (kts) faster than stall
speed,  pull back on the stick to point your nose skyward, then release the
stick.  watch the altitude scale on the right side of the HUD; you'll start
climbing.  Don't climb so steeply you lose sight of the horizon because you
may  stall.   You  must start climbing by the time you reach the end of the
carrier deck, or you may get wet.

Retract  Landing  Gear:  Once airborne, immediately tap Gear (6) to retract
your landing gear.  Don't leave the gear down high speeds can rip it off.

Retract  Flaps:   Tap  Flaps (9) to retract your flaps.  You no longer need
extra lift.

Flight To The Primary Target

A  Light  touch:   Use a light touch on the Control Stick.  The most common
pilot  error is a "ham fist" on the stick, throwing the plane wildly around
the sky.  Use small motions on the stick; the F-117A is very responsive.

Chasing  the  Gauges:  When you roll an aircraft left or right, pitch it up
or  down  change  the throttle, the flaps, or the brakes, it takes a moment
for  the  planes  new situation to be reflected by the gauges.  Good pilots
fly  by making a change then wait a few seconds to see the results.  If you
don't, you'll just "chase gauges" that are still changing

Level  Flight:   Once  airborne.   try  to  achieve level flight.  Push the
control  stick forward or back until the horizon is level across the middle
of  the  HUD  and  the  Flight  Path  Indicator  (see page 42) rests on the
horizon.   Then  make  fine  adjustments  until  you're neither gaining nor
losing altitude.

Since  this  is a stealth mission, you want to fly between 500` and 1,000`.
Look  at  the  altimeter (vertical scale on the right side of the HUD).  If
you`re  above  the  "1k"  mark 1,000') you`re too high.  Push the nose down
into  a  gentle  dive until you reach the desired altitude.  Then level out
and again place the Flight Path Indicator on the horizon.

Flying  on  Course:   Look at the heading scale across the top of your HUD,
find  the  INS  cursor  (the small bright triangle above the top), and turn
towards  it.   As you turn the triangle will move towards the centre of the
heading  scale;  when  the triangle is in the centre of the scale you`re on
course to the first waypoint.

To  turn,  gently  pull  the  stick  left  or  right.  The plane will bank.
Release  (centre)  the stick when the bank angle is about 45o.  To increase
the  rate of turn you can pull back on the stick a little.  As you do this,
watch  your  speed (on the left of the HUD) and altitude (on the right).  A
turn  with back pressure can slow your plane and cause it to lose altitude,
so  don't  pull  back  too  much.   Minimum  safe  altitude  is about 200`.
however, in this training mission stay at 500`.

Minimum  safe  speed  varies with the current status of your aircraft.  The
Stall Speed Indicator Bar rises from the bottom of the speed scale when you
travel  too slowly.  If this bar reaches the centre tick mark of the scale,
your  plane  is  stalling  (the "Stall" light will flash and you`ll hear an
alarm).   A  stall  causes  the plane to fall out of control, so try not to
stall  the plane.  If you do lower your nose again to regain airspeed, then
pull out into level flight.

Autopilot:   If you're confused about which direction to fly, and how to do
it,  tap  Autopilot  (7).   It takes over immediately, turning you onto the
correct  course.   If  you`re  below  500` the autopilot will climb to that
altitude.  If you touch the control stick the autopilot automatically turns
off.

Enjoy  Yourself:   Once  on  course,  enjoy  yourself by trying out all the
views.

You can see out the front, rear, and sides of the cockpit canopy using View
Ahead  (Shift  /)  View Rear (Shift >), View Left (Shift <), and View Right
(Shift M).  These views assume you are inside the cockpit looking out.

You  can  also  "step  outside"  your aircraft and watch it using Slot view
(Shift  F1),  Chase  Plane  (shift F2), and Side View (shift F3).  Bank the
plane  left and right to observe the difference between the chase plane and
slot  views.   Missile  View  (Shift  F4), Tacti View (Shift F5), and Invrs
Tacti  View (Shift F6) are used in combat situations.  See page 36 for more
detailed description of these options.

You can return to the cockpit at any time; just tap Cockpit (F1)

Passing  the  First  Waypoint:  When you reach the first waypoint a message
appears  on  the  HUD:   "Waypoint  1 Reached." Your INS system immediately
switches  to  the  next waypoint (the INS cursor jumps to the new heading),
which is your primary target.  If you have changed the waypoints, tap Reset
Way Pt (Shift F8) to reset the waypoints to the default settings.

Extra  Fuel:   You'll notice that one of the four items in your weapons bay
is  an  extra  fuel  tank.  This is because the mission from CV America, to
Tripoli, and then to Sigonella in Sicily, is a very long trip.

To  see your fuel status, tap Select Way Pt (F7).  The bar gauge across the
bottom  shows  the  fuel  on hand.  The black area at right represents fuel
already  consumed.   the four color-coded bands in the middle represent the
amount of fuel needed to reach each of the four waypoints (fuel calculation
is  based  on your current altitude and speed).  The final band to the left
represents the amount of reserve fuel available.

Your  engines cannot draw fuel directly from the extra tank in your bay, so
you  must  pump  it  from the extra tank into the main tank.  To accomplish
this,  tap  Select  Weapons  (Space  Bar)  until  extra fuel is the current
"weapon"  ("EXTRA  FUEL" appears in the lower left corner of the HUD).  Now
tap  Fire  Weapons  (Return key) to "fire" the fuel from the spare into the
main tank.  If you tap Select Way Pt (F7) again, you`ll see the fuel status
has changed.

Accelerated  time:  You can speed the passing of time by tapping Accel Time
(Shift  Z).   This  doubles  the  rate  at which time passes.  To return to
normal  time,  tap  Norm Time (Shift X).  If you forget to return to normal
time,  don't  worry;  combat  activity or lowering your gear returns you to
normal time automatically.

Attacking The Target

Once  you're  well past the first waypoint and the coast of Libya is on the
horizon, it`s time to start thinking about hitting your primary target.

Check the tactical Situation:  Switch your left MFD to the gridded tactical
map by tapping Maps (F3).  Your target is a radar site, so look for a radar
symbol on this map.

Acquire  the  target:   Switch your HUD to GND (Air-Ground) mode by tapping
HUD  Modes (F2) until the GND light below the HUD illuminates, then tap Cam
Ahead  (/).   If  your target does not appear in the right MFD.  tap Select
Target  (B)  until  it does.  If you cycle through all possible targets and
still  don't  see  the  primary target, you`re either too far away for your
targeting  system  to  see  it,  or  you're  somehow  flying  in  the wrong
direction.

Select  your  Weapon:   Tap Select Weapons (Space Bar) until the message "2
Maverick" appears in the lower left of the HUD.

Wait  for  Missile Lock:  When you've acquired the target, you`ll see a box
on the HUD.  This is the "Tracking Box;" the radar site that appears on the
right MFD is in the center of this box.

Missile  Lock:  When you get within missile launch range, this box, changes
to  an  oval;  in  addition,  the  red  "LOCK" light on your console begins
flashing,  and  a  box  (the "Lock Box") appears in the middle of the right
MFD.

Optimal  Missile Lock:  If you wait longer, the Tracking Oval turns red and
the  "LOCK"  light  ceases  flashing and becomes solid; the Lock Box in the
right  MFD will begin to collapse repeatedly.  These indicators signal that
"Optimal  Launch  Range"  has  been  reached and that the missile should be
launched immediately.

Launch  Altitude:   If you launch a weapon while flying too low, you may be
caught  in the blast area, or a missile may hit the ground before its motor
can  power  it  up  and  away.   A  simple  rule to get you started is that
missiles  and  retarded bombs require at least 500` altitude, free fall and
laser bombs 3,000`.

Launch:   When  you  reach "Optimal Launch Range".  open the weapons bay by
tapping  BayDoors  (8),  then  launch  the  missile  by tapping Fire Weapon
(Return),  After  lauching  turn  away  slightly,  since  flying through an
exploding target could damage your aircraft.

Shortly  thereafter  the  missile  should hit the target.  A successful hit
causes a fire and sends a cloud of smoke up into the sky.  You get a report
on your HUD (sent from an observing AWACS) about the success of the attack.

The Secondary target:  You can now fly to the secondary target (use the INS
cursor  as a guide) and attack it as well, using the same procedure.  Or if
you wish, call it quits and head for home.

The return Trip

Setting  the  INS  to  the  Landing  Point:  Tap Reset Way Pt (Shift F8) to
insure  the  default  waypoints are loaded in your INS (inertial navigation
system)  then tap Select Way Pt (F7).  Now examine the list of waypoints on
the  right MFD.  There are four waypoints listed.  If the fourth one is not
highlighted, tap Next Point (Keypad Shift 3) until it is highlighted.  This
switches  the  INS  to  that  point.  The last point on the default list is
always your return base.

Flying  Home:   You  can either use the autopilot or manually fly home.  As
before  guide  yourself using the INS cursor.  When the INS cursor is lined
up on the centre of the leading scale, you're on course.

If  you  look at the map (Tap Maps (F3)) until the Satellite map appears on
the  left  MFD), you'll notice there`s a small island (Malta) just south of
Sicily.   You  should steer just east (to the right) of Malta.  As you near
Malta, tap HUD Mode (F2) to change your HUD to NAV mode, then tap Cam Ahead
(/).   If  the  Sigonella airbase, comes up on the right MFD, fine; this is
your  destination!  However, it's likely that Halfar airfield on Malta will
appear  instead  (it's  closer).   Tap  Select  Target  (B) until Sigonella
appears.

Landing At Sigonella Airbase

Level  Flight:   About  50  km from Sigonella, start lining up your landing
approach by achieving level flight at 500` to 1,000` altitude.

ILS:   Turn  on the Instrument Landing System (ILS) by tapping ILS (F9).  a
horizontal  and vertical bar appear on your HUD, representing your position
relative  to  the  "glide  slope.   "The  glide  slope is an imaginary line
extending  out  and  up from the runway.  First you'll line up beneath this
glide  slope  then  follow it down onto the airbase.  For more details, see
page 54.

Line  Up  Your Approach:  If the vertical bar is left or right of your Nose
indicator.   turn  in that direction until the bar starts moving toward the
center.   You  want  to  get  back  onto  a heading of 000° just as the bar
centers  on  the  Nose  Indicator.   Don`t worry if the bar is a little off
center;  as long as Sigonella is dead ahead the vertical bar will gradually
creep toward the center.  If the bar moves away from centre, however you`re
travelling  away  from  the  glide slope turn the other way to correct your
course.

Reduce  Speed:  Now cut your throttle back to about 50% by tapping Decr Pwr
(-)  a  few  times.   To  maintain level flight while your speed decreases,
pitch  your  nose  up slightly but watch the altimeter on the right side of
the HUD, you don't want to gain altitude).

Extend  Flaps:  When your speed reaches about 300 kts, extend your flaps by
tapping Flaps (9).  This slows you further by giving you more lift.  You`ll
have to readjust the nose a little to maintain level flight.

Lower  Gear & Reduce Speed Again:  Tap Gear (8) to lower your landing gear,
and cut the throttle to about 40% power.  As your speed gradually decreases
you`ll  have  to raise the nose to maintain level flight.  By this time you
should  be  close  to  the glide slope, and travelling about 200 to 250 kts
with your speed still decreasing.

If  you're  moving too fast, tap Brakes (0) to extend your airbrakes then a
few  seconds later, tap it again to close them.  Do not leave the airbrakes
open, as this may cause you to stall and crash.

Intercept  the  Glide  Slope:  As you get near the airfield, the horizontal
ILS  bar  on  the HUD begins to move downward.  When the bar approaches the
Nose  Indicator,  pitch  your  nose down a little.  Your objective is to go
into  a gradual descent that keeps the bar aligned with the Nose indicator.
Watch the Angle of Attack Approach Indicator to determine how much to raise
or  lower your nose:  if the up-arrow is illuminated, pitch up a little; if
the  down-arrow  is lit pitch down (the goal is to have the green circle in
the  center  lit).  To avoid gaining speed in the descent, tap Decr Pwr (-)
again to reduce your power.

If  your speed is too slow, look at the Stall Speed indicator (the coloured
bar  rising  from  the  bottom of the airspeed scale).  If the stall bar is
close to the middle of the scale you're getting into trouble.  Tap Incr Pwr
(+) key once or twice.

As  the  airstrip  comes  up,  check  your speed.  You should be travelling
between  150  and  200 kts.  or decreasing from 250 kts toward 200 kts.  If
your speed is above 250 kts, you're coming in too fast.  Tap Max Pwr (Shift
+),  raise  your  landing  gear,  and retract flaps; you try again.  Fly to
Malta, turn around, and start over.

Touchdown:   If  your  speed  is  correct (150-200 kts), start watching the
altimeter.   It  should  be  at  100'  to  300' and decreasing.  Make small
adjustments with the control stick to keep the descent rate steady, but not
too  fast.  The runway is at 0` altitude.  When you hear the squeal of your
wheels on the pavement, tap Brakes (0) instantly, then shut off the engines
by tapping No pwr (Shift -).  You've made a safe landing.

YOUR SECOND MISSION

Dealing With The Enemy

On  your  second  practice mission you'll learn about enemy radar, aircraft
and  missiles.   When you get back to the ready room, go straight back into
the briefing room.

You'll  be  assigned  the identical strike against a Tripoli radar station,
but this time you're going to worry about the enemy too.

Mission  Planning:   Before takeoff, check out the intelligence briefing in
more  detail.   Highlight the Radar Sites option on the menu and select it.
Now  use  your  controller  to move the arrow around the map.  As it passes
over  radar  site  icons,  information  about  missile defenses at the site
appears.  If you select one of the icons, the effective range of the search
radar  at  that site appears as a circle.  you can select any or all of the
sites  at  will  and  turn  the range of each site on and off individually.
Each solid circle is a Doppler radar, each dotted circle a pulse radar.

This  screen  helps  you  plan  a  route to Tripoli and back.  Remember the
waypoints  set  in your F-117A's INS outline the default route shown on the
map.   You may wish to fly a better route, to evade enemy detection as much
as possible

Basically,  you  avoid  detection by Doppler radars if you arc around them,
keeping a constant range to the radar.  You avoid detection by pulse radars
if  you  fly directly toward or away from them.  For more information about
radar, see page 74.

When  you're finished, you should have a mental "map" of where enemy radars
are,  how  you'll  fly  through  them  to avoid detection, and what weapons
you`ll use to achieve your objectives.

Adjusting  Waypoints:   When  you are on the carrier deck awaiting takeoff,
you  may  wish  to  adjust the waypoints to fit your own mission plan.  The
first  waypoint  by default, is half-way between your takeoff point and the
primary target.  Most pilots adjust this point.

To  make  adjustments, tap Maps (F2) until the satellite map appears on the
left MFD.  Then tap Change Way Pt (F8) to display the waypoints list on the
right  MFD  and  the  plotted  flight plan on the left MFD.  Use the Adjust
Waypoints  keys  (Keypad  Shift 2,4,6, and 8) to move Waypoint 1 around the
satellite  map.   Notice the course line automatically cally "snaps" to the
new waypoint as you move it.  If you don't like your adjustments, tap Reset
Way Pt (Shift F8) to reset all the waypoints to the initial default.

Flying  to  the target:  After takeoff, as you fly to the target, watch the
radar patterns on the left MFD satellite map.

Enemy  radar  signals  are  displayed  as  arcs  on  this map.  Dotted arcs
represent pulse radar; solid arcs, Doppler.  Ground search and AWACS radars
are expanding circles, while all aircraft radars and ground tracking radars
are short arcs.

Missiles  and  aircraft appear on the Left MFD satellite map as color coded
dots;  red  dots  represent  aircraft,  black  dots are ground radar sites,
yellow dots are enemy missiles.

You'll  notice  that  enemy  aircraft  with their forward facing radars may
complicate  your  original plan for penetrating enemy air defenses.  You'll
have to sneak behind or beneath them.

Flying  Stealthy:   Now  that  you  understand  the  situation,  watch  the
electromag  netic  Visibility  (EMV)  scale  (below  the  Left  MFD).   The
"visibility"  of  your  plane  to  enemy  radar appears as a thick, red bar
extending  from  the  right  of  the scale.  Your visibility increases with
altitude,  higher  speed, open bay doors.  lower gear, or use of jammers To
keep  your  EMV  small, you should fly low (about 200'), keep your gear up,
bays  closed and jammers off; you should also fly toward or away from pulse
radars, and at a constant distance (arcing around) from Doppler radars.

The  thinner  bars  extending from the left of the scale represent incoming
enemy  radar signals.  Enemy ground-based radar (EGR) signals appear on the
top,  enemy aircraft radars (EAR) on the bottom.  The color of a particular
bar   signifies  whether  that  radar  signal  has  detected  you  or  not.
Basically,  yellow,  pink, or white bars indicate you've been detected (see
page  48,  for a complete explanation).  Bar colours match radar arc colors
on  the  satellite map.  In addition, whenever you're detected by a signal,
the EMV light illuminates briefly, and you hear a warning beep.

Warnings

Eventually,  you'll make a mistake.  or a previously silent enemy radar may
suddenly  turn  on, and you'll be detected.  Even if you are never detected
by  radar  on  your approach to a target, when you destroy the target.  the
enemy will certainly be alerted

Search Warning:  Enemy search radar detects your plane when the enemy radar
strength  bar  overlaps  your  EMV  bar.  Search detection means that enemy
fighters  may  be  vectored  toward  your location, and that surface to-air
missile (SAM) batteries in the area may start tracking you.

Tracking  Warning:   Long  and  medium-range  SAMs must track a target with
radar  before firing.  Tracking radar appears as a short, narrow arc on the
Left  MFD Satellite map When the enemy tracks you, the "TRAK" warning light
on your console begins flashing.

Missile  Warning Lights:  if a radar-homing missile is launched toward you,
the "RAD" missile warning light flashes; if an IR (infrared) homing missile
is launched, the "IR" missile warning light flashes.

The  warning  light  continues  flashing  as  long  as  any  missile of the
appropriate  type  homes  on  your  plane.  Missile warning lights are very
important  because  they`re  the only indication of what kind of missile is
attacking, and therefore, of what defensive measures should be taken.

Missile  Proximity  Klaxon:  When a missile approaches within a few seconds
of  your  plane,  the  Missile  Proximity  Klaxon  sounds.  This very loud,
repeating  tone  means  you  must  do  something  immediately,  or  be hit.
Typically  you`ll drop a chaff or flare cartridge, depending on the type of
threat  (chaff  for  radar missiles, flares for IR missiles).  However, you
can also attempt some last-second maneuvering.

Missile Defenses

When  the  "TRAK" or a missile light begins flashing, get ready to use your
defenses an attack is coming.

Understand  the Attack:The first step is to check out the attack.  Tap maps
(F3)  to  switch  the  left  MFD to the tactical display.  Use Zoom (Z) and
Unzoom  (X) to find a useful scale.  Missiles are small color coded lines -
IR missiles are red and radar missiles are yellow.

Disappearing:   if  you're attacked by a radar missile (the "TRAK" or "RAD"
light  or both is flashing), you can evade the attack by reducing your EMV.
if the enemy radar loses sight of you, the missile loses guidance and flies
on blindly.

Jammers:   You can use the ECM jammer against radar missiles (missiles that
light the "RAD" warning).  Tap ECM (4) to toggle the ECM jammer on and off.
Use  the  IR  jammer against IR-guided missiles (those which light the "IR"
warning).  Tap IR Jammer (3) to toggle it on and off.

After  you turn on the jammer, change course and get away from the missile.
If  you  don't,  when  you turn off the jammer (or when an advanced missile
gets  close  enough).   the  missile  starts homing on you again!  Advanced
missiles  that  "burn  through" jamming include semi-active radar missiles,
command guidance radar missiles, and second generation iR missiles.

Don't  leave  your jammers running.  The ECM jammer increases your EMV; the
IR jammer reduces your speed and can overheat (see page 80 for details).

Chaff  and  Flares:  A chaff or flare cartridge lures a missiles for two or
more  seconds,  causing  it  to fly toward the chaff (radar missile) or the
flare (IR missile)

Fire  a  chaff cartridge, tap Chaff (2), when a radar missile ("RAD" light)
causes the klaxon to sound.  Fire a chaff cartridge, tap Flare (1), when an
infrared missile ("IR light") sets off the klaxon.

Decoys:   Your  F-117A  carries  three decoys that will lure everything for
several seconds.  To launch a decoy, tap Decoy (5).  The Decoy light in the
cockpit  turns  on, and remains lit while the decoy is running (see page 80
for more).

Maneuvering:  Missiles have only a 45o forward "view." If you`re outside of
this  arc.   the  missile  cannot track you.  Therefore, if you "blind" the
missile  with  a  decoy, jammer, chaff, or flare, then fly outside its arc,
the  missile may lose you and fly away Missiles also have very wide turning
circles.  You can out turn a missile (see page 83 for more details).

Ending The Second Mission

Use  the  instructions  in  the first mission to aid you in destroying your
targets  and  returning  to base.  But this time practice evading radar and
missiles.   You may want to fly this same mission a few more times for more
practice before trying a "real" mission.

Good luck!

OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS
----------------------

Preflight Briefing

F-117A  Stealth  Fighter  2.0 has many options.  To make a choice, move the
Controller  joystick,  mouse, or keyboard to position the arrow cursor over
the  option you want, then press the Selector (Button 1, Left Mouse Button,
or  Return/Enter).  Note that pressing Button 2, the Right Mouse Button, or
the Escape key, always returns you to the ready Room (see page 30).

Hardware Options

You may be asked questions about your equipment.  See the technical Supple-
ment for details, including advantageous trade-offs.

Aircraft Identification

To  be  allowed  to  choose your own mission assignment, you must correctly
identify  an aircraft.  Flip to the Warplanes section of this manual (pages
164-172)  and  find  the  drawing  which  matches  the screen illustration.
Observe  carefully  the  shape of the wings, fuselage, nose and cockpit for
accurate identification.  Then select the correct name.

If  your  identification  is  wrong,  you  are  automatically  assigned  to
training.   if  the  identification  is  correct,  you  have your choice of
assignments.

Pilot Roster

Here  you can start a new career or continue an existing one.  Note that if
you  erase  a  pilot's  name  here the results are permanent.  Do not erase
pilot names unless you're sure!  You will not be able to save pilot records
unless you are playing from a copy of the game.

Selecting An Existing Pilot

You  can highlight any one of the various names on the roster by moving the
arrow  cursor  (with  your  Controller) over the name you want.  Select the
name by tapping Selector.

Creating A New Pilot

To  create  a  new  pilot,  you  must highlight an existing one and tap the
Backspace  or  Delete  key.  You may then type in a new name for the pilot.
When you`ve completed the new name tap the return key to enter the new name
into  the  roster.  You may then select that pilot as usual by highlighting
his name then pressing the selector.

When you've selected a pilot from the Roster a form appears that allows you
to indicate some levels of skill for that pilot.

Opponent Quality

The  quality  of  your opponents controls the difficulty of the simulation.
the  better  your  opponents,  the more difficult your job, but the greater
your  rewards.   Your  score  is  significantly  affected  by  this option.
Selecting  regnlar or green opponents reduces your score, making promotions
slower and putting the highest medals out of your reach.  Selecting veteran
or  elite opponents increases your score, speeding up promotions and making
medals easier to obtain.

Green  Opponents:   Here  the enemy has older aircraft and SAMs.  His radar
sets  are  poorly  maintained and frequently out of order.  Radar operators
only  understand  the  rudiments, and therefore are very bad at reading the
sometimes-strange  signals  given  off  by  your  plane.  Enemy pilots have
virtually no skill in aerobatics and dogfighting.

Regular Opponents:  Here the enemy has aircraft and SAMs appropriate to the
region:   older  equipment  for  Third  World and client states more modern
equipment when you face a superpower directly.  Radar operators are trained
and  drilled,  but  lack  experience.   Enemy  pilots  have  practiced mock
dogfights  and  areobatics,  but  lack the quyick perception and aggressive
maneuvering of a combat veteran.

Veteran opponents:  Here the enemy has aircraft and SAMs appropriate to the
region,  like  regulars,  but  tend  to  use  only the better equippment in
combat.   Radar  operators are experience and have good sense of judgement.
enemy  pilots  have dogfighting experience and perhaps a few kills to their
credit.

Elite  Opponents:  Here you face the enemy`s best.  Elite troops always get
the  best available equipment.  Radar operators know their equipment inside
and  out  and  can  interpret  your faint, confusing returns only too well.
Enemy  pilots  are  often  aces who know every trick in the book and aren`t
above inventing new ones.

Landing Skills

This  option  determines  how  difficult  and  dangerous  it is to fly your
F-117A.   Your  choice  here  also  affects scoring; the more difficult the
flight,  the higher your scores will be and the easier to obtain medals and
promotions.

No  Crashes:   This  is  the ideal choice when learning to fly.  In a crash
situation  your F-117A rights itself and keeps going.  When landing you can
safely  hit  the  ground as hard as you like.  Unless you have your landing
gear  down,  an automatic barometric altimeter keeps your plane above 200',
simplifying  low level flying.  However, enemy weapons are not affected and
are  still  deadly.  Your score is significantly reduced if you select this
option, making promotions and medals hard to get.

Easy  Landings:   This choice is preferred by casual, weekend flyers.  safe
landing  parameters  are  relaxed  considerably,  which  makes  one  of the
toughest  jobs  much  easier.   To  avoid  a crash you must touch down on a
runway, aircraft carrier, or prepared landing strip.  Hitting the ground or
water  anywhere  else destroys the plane.  As in "no Crashes," an automatic
barometric  altimeter  keeps your plane above 200` unless your landing gear
is  down.   Your  score  is only slightly reduced if you select this option
Promotions  are  not  materially  affected, and you qualify for all but the
highest medals.

Realistic  Landings:   You  must be skilled to be successful with realistic
land-  ings.   Coming  down too fast can mean instant death.  Your score is
full  value  if  you  select  this  option.  If all other selections are of
similar  difficulty,  you  can  be promoted quickly and have a fair shot at
every medal.

F-117A Realism

This  determines  whether  you'll be flying a "real" Lockheed F-117A or the
Micro-  Prose  enhanced version.  The Lockheed F-117A is more restricted in
what it can do than the MicroProse F-117A.

Lockheed  F-117A:   if you choose the Lockheed F-117A you`ll have 2 weapons
bays  instead  of 4, not be able to carry air-to-air weapons (including the
cannon)  nor  fly  air-to-air  missions,  you will fly only at night, never
launch from carriers, and you'll bo much less visible to enemy radar.

MicroProse  F-117A:   The  MicroProse  F-117A  sacrifices  a  little of the
stealthi-  ness  of the Lockheed model for more weapons, more mission types
and  day  and night- time flying (though day missions are still very rare).
It's your choice!

Form  Complete:  When you're finished making selections on the form, select
form  complete.   If you're finished with the Roster.  select Exit from the
lower right corner.

Ready Room

This  is the pilot's Ready Room, where pilots await orders.  From this room
you  can go to any other room to choose various game options.  You can also
see  a  summary  of  all options currently selected, or return to the Pilot
Roster.

To  enter  another  room, move the arrow cursor to the door of the room you
want to enter and press the Selector.

To return to the Pilot Roster, select the bulletin board on the far wall of
the Ready Room.

Commanding Officers Office

You go into the CO's office to request transfer to a different theater or a
different  duty  assignment.   Here  you select the region of the world for
your  new  assignment,  the level of political and military tension in that
region, and the types of missions you`ll be flying there.

Regions Of The World

There  are nine different areas of the world in which to operate.  Each one
takes  you to a different time period of contemporary history, and each has
its  own  set  of unique challenges and missions.  Some areas are much more
dangerous  than  others and you are rewarded more lavishly for operating in
these areas.

Persian  Gulf, 1984:  This is a complex and moderately dangerous situation.
Iran is a radical, revolutionary state involved in a long war with Iraq, as
well as numerous shooting incidents with the US Navy.

North Cape, 1985:  You face the full strength and power of the Soviet Union
during  the  height  of the Cold War.  This region contains many large USSR
military complexes and navel bases.  This is dangerous area.

Libya,  1986:  A client state of the Soviet Union Libya is one of the prime
supporters of international terrorism, and on the recieving end of American
air and naval air attacks.  this a relatively easy situation.

Training  missions in Libya are fixed.  Strike training is always a mission
from  the  USS  America  to  Tripoli;  air  to  air  training  is always an
interception of fighters patrolling the skies over Benghazi.

Central  Europe, 1986:  As in the North Cape, you face first line forces of
the   Soviet   Union   and  the  Warsaw  Pact.   Numerically  inferior  but
qualitatively  superior  NATO  forces  (including  meet  this huge military
power.  Should super power skirmishing or a full-blown World War III occur,
victory  and  defeat  would hinge on events in this region.  This is one of
the most dangerous areas

Middle East, 1989:  The Middle East is a complex web of confusing alliances
and  rivalries.   You'll  face both Soviet and Western equipment as you fly
missions  against  Syria, Iraq, and other terrorist-support states.  This a
dangerous area.

Desert  Storm  -  Iraq,  1991:   The  vast  military might of the US, Great
Britian  France,  and their Arab allies oppose the Baathist dictatorship of
Saddam  Hussain and the Iraqi military, in the Kuwait and iraqi Theaters of
Operations.  This is a moderately challenging situation.

Vietnam, 1994:  The US military has sent air units back into southeast Asia
to  oppose  Vietnamese  expansionism and to settle an old score.  This is a
very dangerous arena.

Cuba,  1995:   Cuba  is  determined to expand the communist revolution into
Central  America and the eastern Caribbean.  Washington has decided to stop
it before it spreads.  This is a dangerous situation.

Korea,  1997:   The Chinese and North koreans have finally had enough of US
dominated  democracy  in  Asia.   They  are  planning  to carry out attacks
against  US  and  South  korean installations.  Washington, of course, will
defend  its  foothold  in  the Far East.  This is one of the most dangerous
situations.

Level Of Conflict

The  level  of conflict in the region has a dramatic effect on how you must
fly  your  missions.   Each  type  of  conflict has its own challenges.  No
choice is easier than another in general, the hotter the war situation, the
more  violent  and  dangerous  the  mission, while Cold War demands careful
planning and good judgement - different skills, but no less important ones!

Cold War means clandestine missions.  Flying without being detected is key.
Fortunately,  enemy  radars  and SAMs aren't expecting trouble.  They often
confirm  a  contact  many times before attacking.  If you are detected, you
must  destroy  the plane or radar which saw you.  However, the more you use
weapons, especially against any other targets, the greater the scandal, and
the  less  successful your mission.  In fact, many missions in the Cold War
involve  photo  reconnaissance,  flying secret materials in or out of enemy
territory, or surgically "removing" a single, specific target.

Limited  War  missions  are also clandestine.  It is still important to fly
without being seen, but since warfare is ongoing, military targets are fair
game  now.   However  be  careful  to  avoid hitting civilians.  Attack and
strike missions are common, but so are photo reconnaissance and clandestine
spy  missions.   In  limited war enemy radar operators expect some trouble.
Their reactions are slightly faster.

Conventional  War  is all-out conflict.  Inflicting the maximum destruction
upon  the  enemy  is  the  main  objective here.  Avoiding detection has no
political importance but is useful if you want to survive the mission!  Any
target  in  enemy  territory  is fair game, military or civilian.  However,
enemy  air  defense  operators  rarely  confirm  their  targets  in wartime
everybody shoots first and asks questions afterward!

Mission Type

You  may  select  from  two  types  of  "real"  missions  and  two types of
"training" missions.  Training missions represent flying a flight simulator
instead of flying a real aircraft

Air-to-Air  Missions  have an enemy aircraft as your primary objective.  If
you`re  a  hotshot  with air to air missiles (AAMs) and dogfighting,this is
your  cup  of  tea.   However,  the  secondary  objective is often a ground
target.

Strike Missions assign ground targets as both objectives

Training   Missions  generate  normal  air-to-air  or  strike  missions  as
appropriate ate.  with three exceptions:  you cannot be hurt by enemy fire;
you  are  not  scored  for  the  mission  you  receive no rating points, no
decorations,  no  promotions  (after  all,  the  mission wasn't real!); you
receive fixed mission orders.  For example if you selected Libya (as in the
tutorial),  strike  missions are always against a ground target in Tripoli,
air  to  air missions are always against fighters over Benghazi.  If you`re
just  learning  to fly and fight the F-117A, this feature allows you to try
the  same  mission  over  and  over,  until  you  understand  fully  what's
happening.

Briefing Room

This  screen  shows a detailed map of the regions of the world you chose in
the  COs  Office.  On this map is the flight plan of your proposed mission.
Your  takeoff  point  (T)  primary  target  (P),  secondary target (S), and
landing  point  (L)  are  always  visible on the briefing map, as reference
points.

Also  shown on this map are important sites such as airfields and radar and
SAM sites.  You can learn important information about these sites by moving
the  cursor  over them and reading the text that appears.  In addition, you
can  see the range of various enemy radars and missiles.  This screen, with
its  great  variety  of  information,  is  the  perfect  place to plan your
mission.   You may wish to take notes about particularly dangerous enemies,
or the route you have in mind.

Mission Brief

This  presents  a  detailed  description  of  your operational orders, with
specific  information  about  the  primary and secondary objectives.  After
you`ve read this, and you tap the Return key, you'll read about your flight
plan,  describing your take-off and landing sites, estimated fuel required,
and a summary of the Rules of Engage- ment (ROE).

Radar And Missile Ranges

If  you  move  the  arrow around the briefing map, information boxes appear
that  tell  you important facts about the various sites on the map.  If you
select  one  of  the site icons, a circle appears that indicates either the
radar range of that site or the missile range.  depending upon which of the
menu  items is seleced.  You can select any or all of the sites at will and
turn the range of each site on and off individually.  if you choose "Select
All"  from  the  menu,  all ranges are shown, if you select "Clear All" all
ranges currently shown are erased.

Radar  Ranges:   if you select Radar Ranges from the menu at right, you are
shown  radar ranges when you select a site.  The initial range shown is the
site's  effective  radar  range; if you then tap the Space Bar, the display
switches to maximum radar ranges.

Missile  Ranges:   If you select Missile Ranges from the menu at right, you
are shown missile ranges when you select a site.  The range shown is always
the SAM's maximum range.

Enemy Troops

Selecting  this  option  shows you the location of known enemy ground force
concentrations.   These  locations  are boxed on the map and indicate areas
where there are likely to be large numbers of shoulder-launched SAMs.

Decline Mission

If  you  select  this  option, the current mission is cancelled and you are
given a new one immediately.  This may be handy if you want to be selective
in the missions you fly.

Select Weapons

This  option  places  you in the Maintenance Room where you can examine the
weapons  your  crew  chief has deemed appropriate for your assigned mission
and change them if you desire.

Maintenance Room

Here you select the weaponary and equipment you desire for your mission.

To  place  a weapon into a bay, use the controller to move the arrow to the
bay  you  want  to affect, then select the bay using the Selector.  Now use
the  Controller to highlight the weapon you wish to place into the selected
bay and then the selector to place it there.

Note  that  your estimated fuel required, and current fuel carried, appear;
make sure you have enough fuel to complete the mission!

Default  Armaments:   The  initial weapons loaded in Bays 1 and 2 represent
your  crew  chiefs  choice of weapons for the mission.  The weapon in bay 1
(upper  left)  is for the primary target, the weapon in bay 2 (upper right)
is  for  the  secondary.   If  extra  fuel  appears in one of the bays it`s
because the crew chief has determined you`ll need it.

Choosing  Armaments:  See pages 139-141 for details about each weapon.  The
"weapon  effectiveness"  chart,  page 139, rates all weapons against common
targets.   Its  wise  to  carry  at  least  one 7 or 6 rated weapon for the
primary and secondary objectives.

The Hangar

Here  you  see your F-117A being topped off with fuel for the mission.  you
are given the choice to go ahead and fly the mission or return to the ready
room.   Of curse if you go ahead and fly theres no turning back; but if you
return  to  the ready room, you can go to any of the above rooms and change
your assignments at will.

Simulation Controls

Viewing Controls

The  following views are from inside the cockpit of the F-117A.  They allow
you  to  look  in four different directions and change the cone of view out
the front of the cockpit

From-the-Cockpit Views

Cockpit:   Tap  Cockpit  (F1)  for  the  standard view, looking out of your
cockpit through the HUD.

Wide Angle View:  The Wide Angle key (C) toggles between a standard viewing
arc  (about  6O°)  and  a  wide-angle  viewing arc (about 12O°).  This view
places  your point of view farther back in the cockpit, showing more of the
cockpit  structure  and  a  wider angle view of the world outside.  This is
excellent for spotting and tracking enemies in a fast-moving dogfight.

Forward:   Tap  View  Ahead (Shift /) to turn off the HUD and look over the
cockpit control panel, giving you maximum visibility forward.

Rear:  Tap View Rear (Shift >) to look through the back of your cockpit.

View  Right:   Tap  View Right (Shift <) to look out the right side of your
aircraft

View  Left:   Tap  View  Left  (Shift  M) to look out the left side of your
aircraft

Out-of-Plane Views

As  an  aid  to  learning flight maneuvers and providing some very dramatic
cinema-  tography, a variety of out-of-plane views are available.  In these
views you`re outside of your aircraft, looking at it and/or the enemy.

In  all  but  the Chase Plane view, Zoom and UnZoom (Z and X) are operable,
moving your viewpoint closer to or farther away from the F-117A.

Slot  View:   Press  Slot  View  (Shift  Fl).  This view is named after the
famous  "in  the  slot"  position  used  by aerial acrobatic teams.  You're
positioned directly behind the

F-117A.   The  viewpoint remains level with the ground, to clearly show the
degree  of  pitch and roll of the F-1 17A as you maneuver it.  This view is
excellent for learning efficient flight.

Chase  Plane  View:   Press  Chase  Plane  (Shift  F2).  You're in a "chase
aircraft"  following  a  short  distance  behind the F-117A.  As the F-117A
accelerates,  it will tend to "run away" from you, while when it slows down
it  tends  to  "fall  back" toward you.  Zoom and UnZoom does not work with
this view

Side  View:   Press  Side View (Shift F3).  You`re to the right side of the
F-117A.   This  view  can  provide  a useful reference point.  It`s also an
excellent  way  to  check the state of your landing gear.  missile launches
are most dramatic when seen from this viewpoint.

Missile  View:   (Shift  F4).   Here  you`re positioned directly behind the
F-117As  active weapon.  If ordnance is in flight, you`re positioned behind
the  weapon  launched  most  recently.  If no ordnance is in flight, you're
positioned  behind  the plane,and will follow the first item launched, this
view  lets you follow the weapon switching to this view after launch may be
educational.

Tactical  View:   Press  Tacti View (Shift F5).  You're directly behind the
F-117A, looking past it at whatever target you're currently tracking.  This
view  automatically rotates and pans to keep both the F-117A and its target
in  view.   This  view  is  invaluable  in  combat situations; it helps you
outmaneuver  and line up onan opponent or return for second or third attack
run on a ground target.

Inverse  Tactical  Vigw:   Press  Invis  Tacti (Shift F6).  You're directly
behind  the  F-117A's  current  target.  looking past it toward the F-117A.
You  see the target in the foreground, and the F-117A often is no more than
a dot in the sky) far away.  The very dramatic view when making attack runs
on ground targets.

The  Movie  Director:   An experienced pilot.  flying in training mode, can
use  these  views  to  good  effect.   By switching between the cockpit and
various  views,  you  can  llustrate  what's  happening  and impress casual
bystanders.

For  example,  you can use the Chase Plane view and autopilot to watch your
plane  launching  from the carrier and turning onto course.  Then switch to
Slot  View  and  show  off loops.  rolls.  split-S turns and immelmans (see
pages  89-92).   Fird an enemy aircraft and use the Tacti View to show your
plane  maneuvering  against  his.   Then switch to Invrs Tacti to watch his
responses.   Before  launching  a missile go to the Side View, to watch the
weapon  dropping away.  Then jump to the Missile View to follow it into the
target.  The possibilities are as endless as your imagination

Other Controls

Pause  (Alt/P)  immediately  freezes  the action.  To resume, press any key
Some  computers have a special key labeled "pause" or "hold".  Depending on
the internal design of your machine.  This key may also work.  Pause may be
very useful when you are first learning to fly.

Accelarated Time

Accel  Time  (Shift Z) doubles the rate at which time passes, and is useful
when  flying long distances without encountering significant threats.  When
in accelerated time node, "ACCEL" appears on the HUD.

Norm  Time  (Shift  X)  returns  the  simulation to normal time.  Since its
almost  impossible  to control and fight your craft in accelerated time, in
combat and landing situations you're automatically returned to normal time.
Accelerated  time  automatically  cally  stops  if you're detected by enemy
radar, you open the weapons bay, or lower the landing gear.

Detail Adjust

Detail  Adjust  (Alt/D) allows you to change the amount and depth of ground
detail  invisible  through  the  cockpit,  speeding computer execution; the
slower your computer the lower the level of detail you should use.

Volume Adjust

Volume  Adjust  (Alt/V) allows you to change the type and variety of sounds
used  in  the  simulation.   When  you press the key, the new sound setting
appears briefly on the HUD

Training

Training  (Alt/T)  allows  you switch into training mode at any time during
play.   This  may be useful if things get particularly confusing, or if you
decide  to  just  go  sightseeing Remember though you don't get rewards for
training missions.

Resupply

Resupply  (Alt/R)  is  available  only  in training missions.  It fills the
planes  fuel  tanks  and  gives it extra weapons.  Resupply is designed for
sightseeing  and  target practise Needless to say, those who prefer realism
in simulations should never touch this option.

Hide Game

"Boss"  Hide  Game (Alt/B) immediately pauses the simulation and clears the
screen,  effectively  making the computer appear to be idle.  To resume the
simulation  you  press "Boss" Hide Game again.  This key is not only useful
at  the office, but also to forestall irate parents, children, spouses, and
relatives who complain about the time you spend at the computer!

Quit

Quit  (Alt/Q)  immediately  ends the simulation and returns the computer to
DOS.   It  does  not save information to disk, so any accomplishments since
the last pilot roster will be lost.

Save

There  is  no  "save"  key  in  F-117A  Stealth  Fighter  2.0.  Instead the
simulation  auto- matically saves your pilot record whenever your leave the
pilot roster during the preflight briefing.

This  "automatic  save"  feature  requires  you  to  be using a copy of the
program  (a copy on either a floppy or hard disk), rather than the original
MicroProse  disk  from  the  box.   If  you're using the original disk, you
cannot save data, although you can otherwise run the simulation normally.

Displays And Aircraft Controls
------------------------------

Terminology

Each  control has a name in italics, which is used on the keyboard overlay;
in  addition,  the actual key used in the IBM version of the game appear in
parentheses.   A  master  list  of  all  names and keys also appears im the
Appendix

Controller  refers  to the pointing device used by your computer.  This may
be a mouse, joystick.  or cursor keys, depending on your hardware.  See the
Technical Supplement for details.

Heads Up Display (HUD)

The  HUD  is  designed  to  provide  all  the  crucial  flying  and  Weapon
information  in  a graphic format.  HUD data is projected onto a wide angle
clear  pane in the front of the cockpit.  You look "through" the HUD to the
situation  outside.  As a result, valuable information is right in front of
your eyes, where it is most useful.

Because  the F-117A is a night fighter.  the text displayed on your HUD can
be  switched from white to green for ease of reading.  At night it is green
automatically; if you are assigned a rare daytime mission, the text appears
white  on  your  HUD.  If for some reason you are forced to stay in the air
past  daylight.   you  may  wish  to  switch the text color back to daytime
colors.  To do so tap day/Night HUD (F4)

In addition, you can customize your HUD to some extent using the De-clutter
key  (V).   These  modes condense some of the information to single digital
readouts; experi- ment to find the setting you like best.

HUD Modes

Your  HUD  has  three  modes Navigation (NAV), Air to Air (AIR), and Air to
Ground (GND).  You switch between modes using HUD Modes (F2).  The HUD Mode
Indicator Lights.  directly below the HUD, indicate the HUD's current mode.
Each  mode  has specific uses and affects not only the types of information
displayed  on  the  HUD but also what types of information are available on
your right-side Multi-Function Display (MFD)

NAV  mode  helps you navigate between airbases by restricting your tracking
system to friendly and neutral airbases and aircraft carriers.  AIR mode is
for  attacking  aircraft,  so  your tracking system is restricted to flying
targets.   GND  mode is for attacking ground targets.  Your tracking system
is restricted to these targets.

Universal HUD Information and Symbology

Some  HUD  information  is universal across all modes.  This information is
displayed or available, regardless of your HUD's current mode.

Airspeed:   Your  airspeed (in knots) is indicated on the left side of your
HUD  on  a  vertical scale; a digital readout of your current speed appears
beside the centre tick mark.

Stall  Speed  Indicator:   The Stall Speed indicator is a colored bar which
rises  from  the  bottom  of  the airspeed scale.  If it extends beyond the
centre  tick mark, your plane has stalled, and falls out of control briefly
until  the  automated recovery system takes over.  A low-altitude stall can
be fatal.

Altitude:   Your altitude (in feet) is indicated on the right-side vertical
scale;  a  digital  readout  of  your  current altitude appears next to the
scale`s  centre  tick  mark.   At 1,000` the scale changes to thousand-foot
increments (2K is 2,000`, etc).

Vertical Velocity Indicator (VVI):  The small, colored bar extending upward
or  downward from the altitude scale's center tick mark is the VVI.  If the
bar  extends  upward,  you're  gaining altitude; If it extends down, you're
losing  altitude.   Each  tick  mark represents 100 feet per minute, so the
longer the bar, the faster you`re gaining or losing altitude.

Landing Speed Indicator:  This colored arrow appears only when your landing
gear  is  down  and  marks  the  safe  maximum VVI for landing.  If the VVI
extends below this mark, landing is unsafe.

Angle  of  Attack (AOA) Approach Indexer:  The AOA Approach Indexer becomes
operational  when  your  landing gear is down.  It assists you in obtaining
optimal  pitch of the plane's nose as you approach a landing.  If the green
circle  in the center of the display is lit, your angle of attack is 0K; if
the yellow up arrow is lit, you need to pitch your nose up; if the red down
arrow is lit pitch your nose down slightly.

Heading:   The  horizontal scale across the top is your heading scale shows
is 000°, East is 090°, South is 180°, and West is 270°

INS  (Waypoint) Cursor:  The colored triangle above the heading scale shows
the direction to the currently selected INS "waypoint".  To get "On course"
turn until the marker is above the middle tick-mark on the heading scale.

Nose Indicator:  Fixed in the middle of the HUD.  this cross hair indicates
the direction your plane`s nose is currently pointing.

Flight  Path  Indicator:  This indicator shows the direction you are flying
(which  may be different from the Nose Indicator).  It is available only in
NAV and GND modes.

The  plane  is geometrically level when the nose and Flight Path Indicators
overlap  (rare  in an aircraft).  Further, level flight (constant altitude)
often  requires  the nose to be pitched slightly above the flight path (see
Techniques and Tactics, 59)

G-Indicator:   This  readout  in the upper left corner of the HUD indicates
the  current  G-forces  on  your plane`s airframe.  The plane can withstand
more G stress than the pilot, whose limits are between 3 and +9.  depending
on training and experience

Pitch  Lines:   These  lines  appear  on  the  HUD if you`re in NAV mode or
pitched  so  far  up  or  down  that  the  horizon is invisible.  Each line
represents  10o of pitch up or down If you`re perfectly level, pitch is 0°;
when climbing straight up or diving straight down, pitch is 90°.

Current  Armament:   In  the  lower  left the HUD indicates which weapon is
currently  selected,  and  the  number  currently  available,  such  as  "3
Sidewinders" or "2 Slicks," etc

On  the  lower  right  is  the  word "Gun" followed by the number of rounds
currently  available.   This  refers  to your 20mm cannon and its remaining
ammunition

Radio Messages:  You are Sent coded burst transmissions periodically, which
are  decoded by your onboard computers and displayed as text across the top
of the HUD.

Tracking  Box:   the tracking Box appears on your HUD whenever your F-117As
tracking  system  is locked onto a target and the target is visible through
the  HUD;  the  Tracking  Box  frames the target.  In addition.  the target
appears  in your right hand side MFD.  The current HUD mode determines what
targets can be tracked.

The Cam Ahead (/), Cam Rear (>), Cam Left (<)and Cam Right (M) keys set the
tracking  camera  to "look" in the direction indicated.  Once locked onto a
target,  it follows that target, even if the target moves from one quadrant
to another.

Missile  Tracking  Boxes:  A Missile tracking Box appears on your HUD when-
ever  a  missile  is  visible  through  your HUD.  If the box is green, the
missile  it  frames is one that you launched.  If it is yellow, the missile
is  an  enemy missile.  There may be several Missile tracking Boxes visible
in your HUD simultaneously.

Air-To-Air Indicators

To set the HUD to AIR mode, tap HUD Modes (F2).

Gunsight:  The Gunsight circle replaces the Flight Path Indicator and shows
where your shells would hit if you'd fired six seconds earlier (the time it
takes  them to travel the 6 kilometer maximum range).  If you're tracking a
target, it shows where the shells would land if you'd fired the proper time
in the past for them to travel that range See page 68, for details.

Missile  Targeting  Envelope:  This large, faint circle represents the area
in which an air to air missile can be aimed and "locked onto" a target.

Tracking  Box  and Oval:  the tracking Box appears on your HUD whenever our
F-117As  optical tracking/targeting system is locked onto a target which is
in  front  of  the  plane  and  visible through the HUD; the Tracking Boxes
visible in your HUD simultaneously.

Air-To-Ground Mode Indicators

To set the HUD to GND mode,tap HUD.Modes (F2).

Tracking  Box and Oval:  the tracking Box appears on your HUD whenever your
F-117A's  optical tracking system is locked onto a target which is in front
of  the plane; the Tracking Box frames the target.  In addition, the target
appears  in  your  right  side MFD.  In GND mode, the tracking system locks
onto airbourne targets only.

The tracking Box is color coded to inform you if your curently armed weapon
is  appropriate for use against the current target.  If the tracking Box is
white,  the  weapon is appropriate for the current target.  The size of the
Tracking  Box  indicates  how  effective  the current weapon is against the
current  target  the  larger  the  box  the more effective the weapon.  Tap
Select Weapon (space bar), to arm a different weapon.

When  using self-guided weapons, the box turns into an Oval when the target
is  within  firing  range and the missile is "locked on." When the tracking
oval  turns  red  the  shot  is  a  "sure  thing," with nearly no chance of
missing.

Bombsights:   When free-fall and/or retarded bombs are armed, a special set
of  bombsight  aids  appears on the HUD.  If your current course, speed and
altitude  will  place  you within a bomb blast, the HUD bombsight symbology
(descibed below) flashes.  You can still drop a bomb in this situation, but
you should take appropriate action to escape the resulting blast.

Bombsight  Flightpath  Guide:   This  indicates  the  "path in the sky" you
should  fly  for a perfect bombing run.  Keeping your Flight Path Indicator
centered within this symbol means you`re "on course."

Bombsight  Ranging  Bar:   this indicates when to release a bomb based upon
range  to  the  target.   As  you  get  closer  to  the drop point, the bar
compresses.  When it becomes a single vertical line (or dot) drop the bomb.

Bombsight Fall-line and Bullseye:  This appears only if free fall bombs are
armed.   A  line  extends from your flight path towards the ground.  At the
end of this line is a circle (bullseye).  Your bomb will land in the middle
of this circle.

Camera  Sight  Lens:   If  your current armament is the 135mm/IR camera the
camera  lens  sight  (a  small  +)  appears  on  the HUD.  It indicates the
direction your camera lens aims.

Multi-Function Displays (MFDS)

This MFD appears on the left side of the cockpit and displays two different
types  of  map; the Satellite/Radar Map tactical Display Map.  The Maps Key
(F3) toggles between them.  Either map may be expanded or contracted, using
the Zoom and UnZoom keys (Z and X).

Left Side Multi Function Display (MFD)

The  Satellite/Radar  Map:   this map displays the geographical features of
the region, and is oriented so north is toward the top.  When the Satellite
map is on the display, the "MAP" light is illuminated.

Enemy radar signals are displayed on this map; dotted lines represent pulse
radar;  solid  line  are  Doppler  radar.  Ground search and airborne early
warning  and  control  (AEW&C)  radars  are displayed as expanding circles,
while ground fire control and aircraft radars appear as short arcs.

Missiles, aircraft, and important ground targets also appear on this map as
colour  coded  dots.   Your  aircraft is white, other aircraft are red, and
missiles  are  yellow.   Your mission targets, flash and glow; ground radar
installations are black.

The  Tactical Display Map:  This map portrays the local tactical situation.
It  is  oriented  so the top corresponds to your current heading.  When the
Tactical Map is on the display, the "TAC" light is illuminated.

The  map  graphically  depicts  aircraft,  missiles,  ground radar sources,
airfields,  and  incidental  ground  targets.   A  16  km  square  grid  is
superimposed for range referencing

Color-coding:  Aircraft and missiles are colorcoded; dark red planes are at
a  lower  altitude  than you are, light red ones are at about the same, and
yellow  planes  are above you; red missiles are IR seekers, and yellow ones
are radar homers or visually guided.

Right Side Multi Function Display (MFD)

This  MFD  appears  on  the  right  side  of the cockpit and has four basic
functions:   to  display  images  from  your  tracking  system,  provide an
interface with your inertial navigation system INS, or to display sum- mary
information during flight (there are two types of summary information
 weapons  and  orders).   Tap  the  appropriate key to activate the desired
function.

Tracking  Camera:   Your  F-117A  is equipped with a TV and forward-looking
infrared  (FLIR) camera, capable of scanning 360o to a range of about 80 to
100 kilometers in daytime and slightly less at night To switch between your
TV  camera  and  FLIR  tap  FLIR  (F6).  When you are flying in deep night,
you'll probably have to use the FLIR to identify what you are seeing in the
right MFD.

On-board  computers  are programmed with target data that allows the camera
to  lock  onto targets within its current field of view, providing a Zoomed
TV/FLIR  view  of  the  target  along  with  its  name, range, and bearing.
Primary  and  sceonary targets are indicated when the system locks onto one
of  these.   For  a  more  detailed explanation of the uses of the Tracking
Camera and how it relates to the targeting system, see pages 68-73

Activating  and  Moving  the  Camera:  You can activate the camera (FLIR or
optical) or change its current field of view by tapping Cam Ahead (/).  Cam
Rear  (>),  Cam Left (<) or Cam Right(M).  Switch your tracking camera from
optical to FLIR using the FLIR key (F6)

When  your  tracking  Camera  is  active, the "TC" light is illuminated; if
you`re  using  the  FLIR,  the "FLIR" Iight is lit; the direction indicator
tells what direction the camera is currently pointing.

Selecting and Designating Targets:  the onboard computer contains a list of
important  targets in the area.  Tap Select Target (B) to move the tracking
camera  to  the next nearest target within 80-100 kilometers.  In addition,
you  can  reprogram the tracking camera to aim at any target on the ground.
Simply  aim  your nose at the target and tap Designate New Target (N):  the
camera will find the nearest new target.

Waypoints:   Displays waypoint data for each of the four INS waypoints (F7,
F8 and shift F8) (See page 53, for details).  When waypoints are displayed,
the "WAY" light is illuminated.

Weapons:   Displays  weapons  currently  on  board  your  F-117 (F5).  When
weapons are displayed, the "WPN" light is illuminated.

Mission  Orders:   Displays a summary of your current mission orders.  When
you  have  accomplished  your  primary or secondary mission, the summary is
updated  appropriately.  When your orders are displayed, the "ORD" light is
illuminated

Aircraft Controls - Control Stick

The  F-117A  has  a  standard  aircraft  control  stick.  Pushing the stick
forward  pitches the nose down, pulling it back pitches it up.  Pushing the
stick  left  rolls the plane to the left.  While pushing it right rolls the
it right.

The  more  you push the stick, the more the aircraft pitches or or rolls in
that  direction  When  you  release  the  stick  (center  it)  the aircraft
maintains its attitude

The control stick may be represented by a physical joystick, numeric cursor
keypad,  or  some other device.  See "Controls Summary" in the Appendix for
details.

Throttle And Fuel

The  throttle  controls the power output of your engines.  Maximum throttle
gives  maxi-  mum  speed  but  uses  up  fuel  faster  and  increases  your
electromagnetic visibility (EMV)

Thrust  Controls:  The Max Pwr key (Shift +) immediately opens the throttle
giving  you  maximum  thrust.  The No Pwr key (Shift -) immeddiately closes
the  throttle,  shutting  down the engines.  The increase key (=) opens the
throttle  a small amount.  The decrease key (-) closes the throttle a small
amount.

Thrust  Indicator:   In  the  lower right side of the cockpit is the Thrust
Indicator  a  digital  readout of throttle, expressed as a percent of total
potential.  "100" is maximum power; "50" is half power, and so on.

Fuel  Remaining:   When  your onboard fuel tank is full the digital readout
reads  "999"  as  you fly, the number decreases, showing the amount of fuel
you have remaining in your tank.

Fuel  Warning:   The  warning  light to the right of the fuel gauge flashes
whenever your fuel tanks are dangerously low.

Extra  Fuel:   If  you are carrying extra fuel in your weapons bay, you can
pump  that  fuel  from  the bay into the main tank by tapping Select Weapon
until  "EXTRA  FUEL"  appears  on the lower left of the HUD.  Then tap Fire
Weapon (Return) to move the fuel rom the bay into your main tanks.

Equipment Controls

Artificial Horizon:  This instrument indicates your current pitch and roll.
It  is particularly useful when flying in deepest night when the horizon is
difficult to see.

Landing Gear:  The Gear key (6) toggles your landing gear up and down.  The
"GEAR"  light  illuminates  when the gear is down; If the light flashes you
are  going  too  fast for the gear to be down, and there is danger that the
gear will be ripped off.

Autopilot:   the  Autopilot key (7) toggles the automatic pilot on and off.
Autopilot  sets  at a minimum altitude of 500 and flies you toward the next
INS  waypoint (it does not, however, avoid hills and mountains!).  When the
autopilot  is  on,  the  "AUTO"  light  is illuminated.  turn off autopilot
simply  by  touching  the  control  stick.   Note that if your avionics are
damaged (the "AV" damage light is on), the autopilot doesn`t function.

Weapons  Bay Doors:  Before using any weapon in your bays you must open the
weapons  bay  doors,  using the Bay Doors key (8).  The "BAY" light flashes
when  the  bay oors are open.  After launching the weapon you should toggle
the  doores  closed again Note that damage to you bay doors (the "BD" light
is lit) jams the doors open.

Flaps:   the  Flaps  key  (9)  toggles  the wing flaps between extended and
retracted When the flaps are extended the "FLAPS" light illuminates and the
aircraft  slows and gains lift.  High speeds (in excess of 300 kts) can rip
off the flaps.  causing serious damage

Brakes:  the Brake key (0) toggles the airbrake in and out.  When the brake
is  extended  the  "BRAKE"  light  illuminates and the aircraft slows down.
When  on  the ground.  The Brake key toggles the landing gear brakes on and
off

Ejection  Seat:   Tap  Eject  (ShiftF10) to "punchout" of your plane.  Your
F-117A  has  an  ACES  II  ejection seat, one of the safestm, most flexible
designs  available.  Your best chance of surviving a bailout exists if your
altitude  is  between  2.000`  and  14,000`  while flying level or climbing
slightly.

Evasion and Defense Systems

Electromagnetic Visibility (EMV) Scale

This gauge shows the current "stealthiness" of your aircraft.

Your  EMV:  The "visibility" of your plane to enemy radars appears as a bar
extending  from the left of this gauge.  Your EMV increases as you climb to
a higher altitude, increase speed, open your bay doors, lower your gear, or
use your jammers.

Enemy  Radars:   The  bars that extend intermittently from the right of the
scale  represent  incoming enemny radar signals.  Enemy ground based (EGRs)
appear  on  the  top, enemy aircraft radars (EARs) on the bottom.  The bars
are colour coded to give additional detection information.

Detection:   If  an  incoming signal overlaps your EMV bar, it has detected
you  (the  Detection Warning Light flashes and you hear a warning beep).  A
pink  incoming signal means that a ground radar has faintly detected you; a
yellow  bar  means  you have been fully detected.  If an incoming air radar
signal appears white on the gauge an enemy aircraft has detected you.

The  colors  of  search radar signals that appear on your Satellite map and
HUD  are  colored  identically  to those on the EMV gauge.  So that you can
easily  locate  the  radar  that  has  detected  you  (see  "Display Colors
Summary," in the Appendix).

Warning Devices

Search  Warning:   Frequently  a  single search detection does not give the
enemy sufficient data to recognize your plane, but when you have definitely
been  seen,  a message appears on your HUD to indicate the enemy has "seen"
your plane.

Radar  Tracking  Warning:   Long-range  and  medium-  range  Surface to Air
Missiles  (SAMs)  must  track you for a time before firing.  Tracking radar
appears as a short, narrow arc on the Satellite/Radar map.

When  enemy  tracking  radar  tracks you, the "TRAK" warning light flashes.
Note,  however,  that  some short-range enemy missiles (some IR-homers, see
page  82)  do  not use a radar tracking system.  Therefore, "TRAK" is not a
foolproof warning of impending attack.

Missile  Warning  Lights:   If  a  radar-guided  missile  is homing on your
aircraft  the  "RAD"  light flashes.  If an IR (infrared homing) missile is
homing on you, the "IR" light flashes.

The  appropriate  light  continues  to flash as long as any missile of that
type  is  pursuing  you.   If  jammers  or  some  other  device confuse the
missille,  the  light  goes off.  If the missile later finds you, the light
flashes again.

Missile  Proximity  Klaxon:   When  a  missile  is  within a few seconds of
hitting  your  plane, the Missile Proximity Klaxon sounds, signaling you to
react quickly or be hit!  Typically you'll drop chaff or a flare, depending
on the type of threat (chaff for radar missiles, flares for IR missiles).

Defenses

Flare:  this is a small, finely tuned heat decoy.  Tap Flare (1) to release
a flare cartridge behind your plane.  The flare light illuminates while the
flare  is  active  and  the  digital  readout indicates the number you have
remaining.   For  the  next  2-5 seconds the intense heat of the flare will
cause  all  enemy  infrared guided missiles to home on the flare instead of
your aircraft.

Chaff:   Tap Chaff (2) to release a chaff cartridge behind your plane.  The
chaff  light  illuminates while the chaff is active and the digital readout
indicates  the number you have remaining.  For the next two or more seconds
the  aluminum  sheets  of  the chaff cartridge will confuse all enemy radar
guided  missiles,  causing  them  to  home  on  the  chaff  instead of your
aircraft.

Important  Exception:  Enemy Doppler radar-guided missiles will not home on
chaff  unless your course is perpendicular to that of the missile.  As long
as  the  missile  chases you from the rear, or attacks from straight ahead,
chaff has no effect.

Decoys;  Your  F-117A  carries  three decoys.  To launch a decoy, tap Decoy
(5).   The  "decoy"  light  illuminates while the decoy is running, and the
digital readout indicates the number you have remaining.

Each  decoy  is  a  computer-controlled  radar  emitter/reflector and an IR
source.   To  enemy  radar  and  infrared  it  looks  like  your plane, but
stronger.  The decoy gradually floats down via parachute and self destructs
betore  landing.   Enemy missiles, aircraft and ground radars are fooled by
decoys,  although the amount of time depends on the experience and skill of
the opposition (typically trom 20 to 60 seconds) During this time the enemy
chases the decoy instead of you.

Infrared (IR) Jammer:  the IR hammer key (3) toggles ths device on and off.
When  the jammer is running the "IRJ" light illuminates.  This device emits
heat  pulses  to  confuse  a  missile's guidance system.  The missile stops
homing  on  your  plane  and  flies  straight  ahead.  The jammer is highly
effective against first generation IR missiles, but good only at long range
against  second  generation  missiles  (see  page 83).  Using the IR jammer
reduces your speed, and it shuts down automatically to avoid overheating.

ECM  Radar  Jammer:   The ECM key (4) toggles this device on and off.  When
the  jammer  is  running the "ECM" light illuminates.  This jammer "blinds"
radar  guided  missiles.  The jammer is particulary effective against older
"beam  rider"  missiles,  but good only at long range against "semi-active"
radar  homers  (see  page 79).  The only drawback to using ECM is that your
EMV is increased

Damage

The upper left of the cockpit has a bank of "telltale" lights that indicate
which systems (if any) are damaged.

Missile  Warnings  (MW):   When  the  "MW" damage light is illuminated, the
Missile  Warning system is inoperative.  The "RAD" and "IR" missile warning
lights no longer work.

Engine  (ENG):   When  the  "ENG"  light  is illuminated, engine damage has
reduced the maximum thrust possible.  Any additional damage further reduces
thrust

Flight  Control  (FC):   When  the "FC" damage light is illuminated, flight
control computer damage makes the F-117A more difficult to control.

Avionics  (AV):   When  the  "AV" light is illuminated, avionics damage has
disabled your Inertial Navigation System (INS) and autopilot.

Bay  Doors  (BD):   When  the  "BD" light is lit, the weapons bay doors are
damaged and jammed open, permanently increasing your EMV.

Jammers  (JAM):   When  the  "JAM"  light  is  illuminated, your ECM and IR
jammers no Ionger function.

Fuel  Tank  (Fuel):   When  the  "FUEL" light illuminates damage and stress
breakage  is  causing fuel to leak.  Once a leak starts, any furthur damage
increases the rate of fuel loss.

Fire  Control  (FIRE):  When the "FIRE" light illuminates your fire control
systems are damaged.

Random  Malfunctions:   Your  F-117A  is  an extremely complicated piece of
equippment.   Random malfunctions are possible in any of the systems at any
time.  The malfunction may include the reporting systems onboard the craft.
If  so you wont know that something has malfunctioned until you discover it
doesnt work!

Malfunctions are more likely in intense combat situations, due to the heavy
burden that places on your sophisticated electronic systems.

Weaponry

These  instructions  give  the  bare  rudiments of weapons operation.  Many
important  considerations  and tactical tricks are described in "Chapter 3,
Techniques  and  Tac-  tics."  See "Weapons Effectiveness," page 139, for a
chart showing weapon effective ness against various targets.

Selecting Weapons

The  name of the weapon currently armed and ready for use always appears in
the lower left corner of the HUD.

Weapon:   Tap  Weapon  (F5) to display the contents of your weapons bays on
the  right MFD.  The bay currently selected is highlighted, and the current
armament appears in the lower left corner of the HUD.

Tap  Select  Weapon  (Space Bar) to change the currently-selected weapon in
your fire control system.  Each key press switches to the next weapons bay,
and  the  change  is  indicated both on the HUD and in the Right MFD Weapon
display.

Cannon:   Your 20mm cannon is always available for use (Unless it is out of
ammo or damaged).

Firing Weapons

Launching  Weapons:   Tap  Fire  Weapon  (Return) to launch a weapon.  This
fires  one missile or drops one bomb.  The currently selected weapon is the
one  used.   See  pages  68-73, for more specific instructions on launching
weapons.

The Reconnaissance Camera (135mm/FlIR Camera) is "fired" like a weapon from
an open weapons bay.  Each "shot" takes one picture

Special  Equipment can be air-dropped by opening the bay doors and "firing"
it  out.   It  floats  to  the ground on a parachute.  It is also loaded or
unloaded  on  the  ground at appropriate airstrips automatically (a message
appears on your HUD when loading or unloading is complete).

Cannon:  Fire Cannon (Backspace or Button 2) tires one burst.

Navigational Systems

Concept:   The  INS has up to four programmable "waypoints" to map a flight
plan.  The default waypoint setup puts the first point halfway between your
starting  base  and  primary  target the second is the "primary target" the
third is the secondary target, and the last is your landing point.

Waypoints  Display:   The  Select  Way  Pt (F7) and Change Way Pt (F8) keys
display  list  of  INS  waypoints on the right side MFD, and your projected
flight path from waypoint to waypoint on the Satellite Map on the left.

The  waypoints list display shows the current time at top.  The ETA to each
waypoint  and  a  fuel  gauge  across  the bottom.  The fuel gauge is a bar
graph,  predicting  fuel  consumption  based  upon  your  current speed and
altitude.   The  far  right  side  of  the bar black region) indicates fuel
already consumed, the center parts (white for current waypoint and blue for
others) indicates fuel needed to reach each waypoint, and the far left side
(green region) indicates fuel reserves.

Selecting  Waypoints:   The  waypoints  list  has one point highlighted (in
white).   This  is the waypoint currently indicated by the INS cursor above
the Heading Scale on your HUD.

To  select a new waypoint, tap Select Way Pt (F7).  Then use the Last Point
(keypad 9) and Next Point (keypad 3) keys to move the highlight up and down
the   list.   As  you  move  the  highlight  the  HUD's  INS  cursor  moves
accordingly.

Changing Waypoints:  To change a waypoint to a new location, tap Change Way
pt (F8).  Then use the Last Point (keypad 9) and Next Point (keypad 3) keys
to  select  the  waypoint  you  wish  to  change.   Finally, use the keypad
waypoint  keys to actually move the waypoint.  You can watch the results in
the left MFD on Satellite Map.

Tap  Reset  Way  Pt  (Shift  F8)  to  reset  all  waypoints to the original
waypoints.

Instrument Landing System (ILS)

The  ILS key (F9) toggles the ILS display on and off.  When the ILS is on a
vertical  and  horizontal bar appear on the HUD to guide you to the nearest
friendly airbase.

Principles of Operation:  the ILS is designed to aid you on final approach,
steering  you  down  a  descending "glide slope" to the runway.  If you are
flying  a  pattern  to  land, use the ILS to guide you to the airport, then
turn  it off until you are "on final".  The ILS guides you to the runway or
carrier deck, but ends there.  Rather than produce inaccurate readings over
the runway, the ILS automatically turns off before it degrades to useless.

Vertical  "Course" Bar:  to use the ILS, fly the plane so that the vertical
bar  lines  up with with vertical ticks of your Nose Indicator.  This means
you`re on course towards the airbase.

Horizontal "Glide Slope" Bar:  The horizontal bar of the ILS represents the
"glide  slope,"  an  imaginary sloping line extending from the airbase into
the  sky.  If the bar is above the horizontal ticks of your Nose Indicator.
You are beneath the glide slope You can either fly straight ahead until you
"intercept"  it,  or climb to get to the glide slope faster.  If the bar is
beneath  your  Nose  Indicator,  you  are  above the glide slope and should
descend until the bar aligns directly with the Nose Indicator.

Postflight Debriefing

After  the mission you are debriefed.  Your commander goes over the mission
step  by step, evaluating each event as it occurs and assigning a numerical
score.   Basically  if  you  accomplish the mission and follow the Rules of
Engagement  (see  below),  you`ll  do  very  well.   The more difficult the
opposition, the more credit you`ll get.

Ending A Mission

When  you  land, stop, and turn off your engines, the mission is over.  You
cannot  refuel  or  rearm  to  continue  the mission.  Stealth missions are
carefully  planned  "one  shot" operations.  If a mission fails, higher-ups
will decide later whether to try again, and if so, when, where and how.

Crashes

If you're using Easy or Realistic landings, crashing the airccraft ends the
mission  and your career.  To remain alive, you must eject before the plane
hits the ground.  Of course, selecting "No Crash" eliminates this problem -
but greatly reduces your potential score.

Bailing out

If  you  survive  a  bailout, you now have to worry about where you did it.
Ejecting  over  the  sea, far from an enemy coastline, is ideal because the
aircraft sinks out of sight and you can be rescued.  The next best location
is  over  friendly  territory.  Again, you can be rescued, but fragments of
the  wreckage  may  be  found by the public or by enemy spies.  Bailing out
over  enemy  territory is bad:  even though your F-117A has a self destruct
mechanism.   Fragments  of  the  plane will certainly be found by the enemy
teaching  them  valuable  secrets  of  US stealth technology.  In addition,
you`ll  probably  be  captured  and  suffer  a public trial and humiliation
before the USAF manages to get you back

Scoring

Above  all  follow  the  Rules  of  Engagement  and  accomplish the primary
objective  it's  hard  to  do  badly if you achieve this.  Failing that, at
least accomplish the secondary objective.  If you fail both of these, it is
difficult to gain any credit.

Cold  War:   It's  important  that  nobody detect you.  Visual sightings by
enemy  aircraft  do the most damage Enemy radars that positively track your
plane are also bad

Needless  to  say, random destruction is also unacceptable in Cold War, and
destroying  friendly  planes and ground installations is the worst possible
event.   However,  destruction  of neutral or civilian targets is almost as
bad.   The  least  embarr- rassing events are destruction of enemy military
targets,  although  even that should be avoided.  In fact, the only time it
is  "permissible"  to  destroy target is if your mission orders require it,
the enemy has sighted or tracked you, or if the enemy fired first.

Limited  War:   It's also important to avoid detection during a Limited War
although  the  penalties  aren't  as  great.  Your commander wholeheartedly
approves  of  attacks  on  enemy  forces,  including  military aircraft and
obvious  military  installations put civilian targets (passenger airliners,
oil  wells,  refineries,  bridges, etc.) cause political problems and lower
your Score.

Conventional  War:  In this situation your commander doesnt care if you are
detected.   unless  of  course your plane is damaged by enemy fire (F-117As
are very expensive).

You  gain  credit for destroying anything in enemy territory, even civilian
targets  although  military  ones are worth more).  In fact, your commander
rather expects that you`ll do a bit more than just hit the objectives.  The
only   possible  negatives  come  from  the  destruction  of  neutrals  and
friendlies.

Reputation

If  your rating on a mission is high, your commander will recommend you for
a  Decoration.   The  five  possible  decorations,  from  easiest  to  most
difficult to achieve are;

AM:   Airman`s Medal. recognizing good performance.
DFC:  Distinguished Flying Cross. for superior performance in combat.
SS:   Silver Star for Valor. for heroism in combat.
AFC:  Air Force Cross, for extreme heroism.
CMOH: Congressional Medal of Honor. America`s highest military decoration

You  must be outstandingly successful against the toughest opposition to be
nominated for the Congressional Medal of Honor

Other Decorations

The  Purple  Heart is awarded to pilots who come home wounded.  Surviving a
mission with a badly damaged aircraft frequently yields this award.

The  Combat Readiness Medal is awarded to almost everyone in a combat unit.
Beyond  this,  the  number  of  missions  you survive determines what other
ribbons you may receive:  5 missions for the Overseas Ribbon Short Tour, 15
missions  for the Overseas Ribbon Lang Tour.  30 missions for the Longevity
Service  Ribbon, and 60 missions for the Langevity Service Ribbon with Gold
Cluster

Promotions

Your  starting  rank  is 2nd lieutenant.  Promotions are based both on your
total score and on your average score per mission.  Therefore, if you "goof
up"  and  do  badly in a mission.  You may need extra high-scoring missions
before you qualify for promotion.

In addition, you can`t get promoted without sufficient experience.

Ranks available, from lowest to highest, include:

2nd Lt:   Second lieutenant
1st Lt:   First lieutenant
Capt:     Captain
Maj:      Major
Lt.Col:   Lieutenant Colonel
Col:      Colonel
B.Gen:    Brigadier General

Brigadier General is not a flying rank.  You don't have a chance of earning
that  rank  until you're retired from active duty.  No pilot is expected to
fly  more  than  99  missions  After  that  the Air Force decides:  are you
promoted  to Brigadier General, are you simply given a Washington desk job,
or  do they suggest you leave the service and seek your fortune in civilian
life?   Very  few  pilots  survive 99 missions with a record good enough to
earn their "star."

Incidentally,  don't  feel  bad  about  a middling rank.  In active fighter
squadrons  most pilots are First lieutenants and Captains.  Majors serve as
flight   leaders,  Lieutenant  Colonels  as  higher  squadron  officers  or
commanders, and full Colonels as squadron or wing commanders.  Promotion to
Major  or above is increasingly difficult.  A Lieutenant Colonel or Colonel
still flying active combat missions is rare in the USAF.

TECHNIQUES AND TACTICS
---------------------

How To Fly

This  discussion  of  lift  and  flight  is  not  rigorous  or precise in a
scientific  sense.  It only provides a rudimentary portrayal of the physics
of flight and its practical effect on aircraft handling.

Lift:   Aircraft  fly  because  of  a  pressure  difference  created by the
difference  in  the  speed  of  the air flowing over the top of the wing as
opposed  to  the bottom.  Air moves faster over the top of the wing than it
does  over  the  bottom,  creating  high  pressure beneath the wing and low
pressure  above  it.   The wing is pushed upward to compen- sate, providing
lift.   When  the pressure difference becomes great enough, the upward lift
is greater than the plane's weight and the aircraft flies

Speed  and  Lift:   The  amount  of  lift generated by the wing varies with
airspeed.   The  faster  the plane flies, the faster the air flows over the
wings,  and the greater the pressure difference.  If your plane is in level
flight  at  a  certain  speed,  reducing  the speed reduces lift, causing a
descent (without nosing down).

Angle  of  Attack  and Lift:  the amount of lift generated also varies with
the  angle  between  the  wings  and  the  airflow.   If you pitch up a few
degrees, you increase the pressure difference and, therefore, the lift.  If
you  pitch  the  nose down, the reverse occurs.  The difference between the
airflow  direction  and a horizontal line through the wing is the "angle of
attack"  (AOA).   Angle  of  attack  is  visible on your HUD in NAV and CND
modes.   Whenever  your Nose Indicator is above your Flight Path Indicator,
the difference between the two is the Angle of Attack.

Level  Flight:  To achieve "level" flight at a given power setting, a pilot
raises or lowers the nose until his vertical velocity is zero (no ascent or
descent  appears on the "VVI").  Note that a pitch of 0o may show ascent or
descent.   Nosing  up  or down to a new "angle of attack" adds or subtracts
lift as needed to achieve level flight.

To  achieve  "level"  flight  at  a  given speed, the pilot gets into level
flight, adjusts his throttle to achieve the desired speed, then adjusts his
pitch to find level flight for that airspeed.

The Effect Of Roll

The force of lift is always perpendicular to the wing.  So if the wings are
banked,  the  lift  force  is no longer straight up relative to the ground.
Instead  it has two components, one moving the aircraft sideways, the other
straight  up.   This  causes the plane to turn, and, since upward lift (the
force opposing gravity) is diminished to lose altitude.

During  a  turn  the  pilot can adjust the angle of attack by control stick
"back pressure," that is, by pulling back slightly on the stick, the amount
of  adjustment  is  very  small.   Over  correcting is a common error among
beginner pilots.

Special Situations

Stalls:   An  aerodynamic  stall  occurs  when  the  wing's angle of attack
becomes  too  large.   The  air  stops  flowing smoothly over the wing, and
instead  part  breaks  away  onto  an  independent  path.   This erases the
pressure  difference, vastly reduces lift, and generally causes the nose to
drop.   Stall  speed  varies considerably depending on many factors.  Tight
turns  increase  the  stall  speed.   Note  that  simultaneously the act of
turning  tends  to  decrease  your airspeed.  As a result, stalls are quite
common  in  tight  turns.  The F-117A has an audible stall warning horn.  A
Stall  Warning  light  in  the upper left of the console, and a colored bar
showing stall speed on the HUD`s Airspeed Indicator.

The  F-117A  includes a computerized stall recovery governor that instantly
reconfigures  the  wing  edges for automatic recovery, making your job much
easier.   To  recover  from  a stall, first level the wings, then bring the
pitch  back  to normal.  A stall invariably costs you altitude.  So a stall
at low altitude can be fatal!

Flaps:   Lowering flaps extends the wing surface and increases the pressure
Difference.   Adding  more  lift they also increase drag, which lowers your
speed.  However, flaps are only useful at low speeds (under 350 knots).

Flying The F-117A

The  F-117A  is  unflyable.   The design is one of the most surprising ever
seen  - many experts said it wouldn't fly when they first saw it.  In fact,
a  pilot would find it very Difficult maybe impossible - to fly without the
aid of sophisticated onboard flight control computers.  This aircraft, like
some others, is said to "fly by wire"

The pilot uses a normal control stick (much like your joystick) and uses it
just  like  pilot  of  a  normal  civilian  aircraft.  But the pilot is not
communicating  with  the  control  surfaces of the aircraft:  instead he is
talking  to  the computer, and it is talking to the control surfaces.  When
the  pilots  says "bank," the computer interprets his command and makes the
wings  bank,  all  the  while  correcting  this  and that to keep the plane
airborne

Remember,  when  you  are  flying this aircraft, you are interfacing with a
computer that is flying the aircraft!

Taking Off

While sitting on the runway, the following pre flight check-out:

Check Your INS.  Tap Maps (F3) until the satellite map is displayed on your
left MFD.  Now tap Select Way Pt (F7) to show the INS waypoints list on the
right MFD.  the INS cursor above the heading scale on the HUD indicates the
direction  in  which you must fly to reach the first waypoint listed on the
right MFD; by using the Next and Previous Waypoint keys (Shift/keypad 3 and
9)  you  can  cycle through all the waypoints currently assigned.  Advanced
pilots may way want to change the location of one or more waypoints at this
time.

Check  armament:   Tap Weapons (F5) to check your weapons on the right MFD.
Use  Select  Weapons  (Space  Bar)  to cycle through the weapons.  Note the
active weapon appears in the lower left corner of the HUD.

Extend  the  Flaps:   Tap  Flaps  (9).  Note the "FLAPS" light in the upper
right corner of the console.  Flaps increase lift during takeoff.

Check the Catapult System (Carriers only):  When launching from an aircraft
carrier, the brakes will be set.  The "BRAKE" light will be illuminated

Start the Engines:  Start your engines by tapping Max Pwr (Shift +)

Activate  Catapult  (Carriers  only):  Tap Brakes (0) to release the brakes
and catapult, hurling you off the deck.

Accelerate  Past Stall Speed:  As you move down the runway or carrier deck,
watch  the  speed  scale  (left  side of the HUD) carefully.  A colored bar
(stall  speed  Indicator)  will gradually go down.  When it drops below the
center tick-mark, your plane is past stall speed.

Climb into the Sky:  Pull back gently on the stick.  As you start climbing,
watch the altitude scale on the right side of the HUD.

Retract Landing Gear:  Tap Gear (6) to raise your landing gear.  Dont leave
the  gear  down  both it and your plane can be damaged if left down at high
speeds.

Retract  Flaps:   Tap Flaps (9) to retract flaps.  You no longer need extra
lift.

Turn  onto  Course:   Pull  the stick left or right until the INS cursor is
aligned  with the center tick on the heading scale.  Alternatively, you can
simply  tap  Autopilot  and  let  your  autopilot turn you onto the correct
course to the first waypoint.  Since this is a stealth mission, you'll want
to stay low.  About 200" to 500` is ideal.

Smooth Flying Techniques

A  Light  Touch:   Use a light touch on the Control Stick.  The most common
error  "ham  fist"  on the stick, throwing the plane around the sky in wild
abandon.  Unless an emergency never push the stick to the limit.

Chasing  the  Gauges:  When you change an aircraft`s operating regime (move
stick,  change  the throttle, and so on), the effects of the change takes a
second or two settle out" and show on the gauges.  For smooth flying.  make
a  change  then observe effects before making another.  Constant adjustment
and  correction  should  be  avoided,  because  all you'll do is "chase the
gauges" overcorrecting every move.

Straight  and  Level  Flight:   To be a good combat pilot.  you must master
level flight.  Do this in a training scenario, rather than real life.

Climb  to an altitude of about 2,000' and level the aircraft so the nose of
the  plane  points at the horizon.  Now reduce the throttle to about 75% to
achieve  an economical cruising speed.  Although the Nose Indicator appears
level  with the horizon, the HUDs altimeter and VVI probably show the plane
is climbing or descending.  If you`re climbing, push forward on the Control
Stick, then let go and observe the effects.  If you`re descending pull back
a bit instead.  Your objective is to keep the altimeter rock steady

You`ll notice that your Flight Path indicator aims at the horizon, but your
Nose  Indicator  may be pointed above Or below it, depending on your speed.
Generally the slower you're travelling.  The higher you must pitch the nose
to achieve level flight.

Now experiment a little Tap Brakes (0).  This slows down your plane.  Watch
the  HUD and notice how the Flight Path Indicator drops.  Meanwhile, on the
sides  of  the  HUD,  your  speed  is dropping and so is your altitude.  To
achieve level flight at this new lower speed pitch up until the Flight Path
Indicator is level with the horizon.

Turns:   As  you pull the stick right or left and your roll angle increases
beyond  45o, the stall speed rises from the normal 120 knots (kts) range to
over  200  kts (in a 90o roll) Tight turns "bleed off" airspeed, so a long,
tight  turn  may  cause  a stall.  Keeping an eye on the airspeed and stall
speed  is  particularly  important when making tight turns at low altitude,
because stalls cause you to lose altitude rather quickly.

In  extremely  tight  turns (where you roll 80o, 85o, or even 90o), you can
tighten  your turn rate by pulling back on the stick.  However, this bleeds
airspeed even faster a close eye on the Stall Speed Indicator bar.

Loops  are  easy  in the F-117A, but ballistic ("straightup") climbs can be
maintained only for short periods.

Remember  that  any  prolonged  vertical maneuver greatly reduces airspeed,
which  risks  a stall if you didn`t start the maneuver with a lot of speed.
However,  going  vertical  is very handy for changing direction.  Since you
can  roll  while  vertical,  quickly  pointing  your  nose  in  the desired
direction, then push down into level flight again.

Low  Altitude  Flying:   At  altitudes under 500', expect increased buffets
downdrafts,  and  other  irregularities  that  make flying difficult.  Also
beware  of  low  ridges and mountains.  It`s easy to fly into a mountain if
you're  not  looking.   Good  pilots  develop  a  "cross  check" routine of
scanning the entire HUD periodically, to make sure everything is okay

In  "No  Crash"  and  "Easy"  flight  modes  you  have a barometric / laser
altimeter.   If  you drop below 200'.  This device automatically but gently
pushes  your  plane back up.  Be warned, the device automatically turns off
when  the  landing  gear is down, or when the gun is firing.  The device is
not  proof  against  power  dives,  stalls, or other radical maneuvers, but
works  fine  in  normal  flight  regimes.   In  fully  realistic flight the
automatic  altimeter  is  turned off, allowing skillful pilots to cruise at
even lower altitudes.
