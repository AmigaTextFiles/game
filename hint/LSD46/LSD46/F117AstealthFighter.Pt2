             F117A STEALTH FIGHTER FULL MANUAL   By SHaRD!/N&B

			     PART 2

Landing The F-117A

Airbases:   All airstrips have a north-south orientation and a centre strip
down  their middle On approach, a course of 000o (if coming from the south)
or 180o (if coming from the north) will align you with the runway.

Airbases  are  more than twice as long as your safe landing distance at 200
kts  -  a large safety margin.  Aircraft carriers have arrestor cables near
the  stern.  You must touch down before or on these cables in order to stop
before  rolling  off  the  deck.   Do  not attempt to land on the bow of an
aircraft  carrier  because there are no arrestor cables here.  Furthermore,
regular  aircraft  spotted  for  launching may be positioned there, and you
certainly don`t want to crash into them!

Aborted Landings:  If you get in trouble landing, open the throttle to full
power  and  retract the flaps and landing gear.  Climb away and come around
for  another  try Do not make sudden movements with the control stick while
landing or aborting.  Wait or your airspeed to exceed 300 kts before making
any  big  turns  or  similar maneuvers Until then, gross maneuvers with the
control stick may stall the plane, causing a fatal crash.

Using The Instrument Landing System (ILS)

To  use  the  ILS, tap HUD Modes (F2) as necessary to switch the HUD to NAV
mode,  tap  Cam Ahead (/) to activate the Tracking Camera, and tap ILS (F9)
to  activate  the  ILS.   The  ILS  and camera will automatically track the
nearest  friendly  or  neutral  landing  site.   It  will  not  track rough
airstrips behind enemy lines.

Line  Up Your Approach:  The first step is to line up on the correct course
to the airbase (or aircraft carrier).  To do this, fly at 500' to 1,000' to
a  point about 40 to 50 kilometers (km) north or south of the base and turn
until the ILS vertical bar is centred on your Nose Indicator.

Intercept  the  Glide  Slope:  Once you're on course, you want to intercept
the  glide  slope  represented  by  the  horizontal bar.  Descend until the
horizontal  bar  is  slightly  above  the  horizontal  ticks  of  your Nose
indicator.   The  horizontal  bar  gradually drops until it aligns with the
horizontal  ticks  of  the  Nose  indicator.   When  this  occurs,  you are
intercepting (flying through) the glide slope.

Descent:   Once  you've  intercepted  the  glide slope, begin your descent.
Keep  the  horizontal  bar  centered, which means making a gradual descent.
You  must manage the descent like a normal landing (see "Descend on Final."
below).

Touch  down:   The ILS will not guide you to touchdown.  It is not accurate
in  the  immediate vicinity of the base.  It turns off automatically before
you reach the runway.

ILS and Landing Patterns:  The ILS is designed to guide you to the airbase.
It does not control your plane through a landing pattern.

Straight In Landings

Line  Up  Your  Approach:   Use  the  ILS  to  line  up a correct approach.
Beginners  intercept  the  glide  slope  about  40  50  km from the runway.
Attempting  to  find  the  approach and make a landing less than 20 km from
base is not advised for the beginner.

Throttle at 7O%:  Fly your approach at 500' to 1,000'.  Reduce the throttle
to about 70%, which should reduced your speed to about 300 kts.  Eventually
you`ll need to pitch up (raise the nose) a little to maintain level flight.

Flaps  Out,  Throttle  5O%, Gear Down:  Now extend the flaps and reduce the
throttle  to  about  50%.   This  slows the plane to about 230 kts.  As you
reach  this  speed  lower  your  landing  gear.  If you`re moving too fast,
extend the brakes - tap Brake (0) for a brief period.

Descend  On  Final:   When the ILS horizontal bar reaches the middle of the
HUD Nose Indicator, you should start descending down the glide slope.

Reduce  the  throttle  slightly.   If  you  were  in level flight, you will
gradually descend with your Nose indicator above the Flight Path indicator

Use  the  ILS  horizontal  bar to control your rate of descent.  Adjust the
throttle to keep the bar in the middle of the Nose Indicator.

Finally,  keep  an  eye on your airspeed and Stall Speed Indicator.  If the
stall  bar  indicator  gets  within  25  kts of your current airspeed, your
throttle  is too low.  Conversely, if your airspeed is over 250 kts, extend
the brakes for a brief period.

Touch  Down:   Your  altimeter reads 0 on a runway, and 125' on an aircraft
carrier  These are your "touchdown" altitudes.  The safe touchdown vertical
velocity  is  shown  by  an arrow on the VVI of your altimeter.  A vertical
velocity  of 400`/minute or less (4 ticks on the scale) is always safe.  In
certain conditions a higher vertical velocity is allowable.  Once you're on
the  runway,  cut  the  power  by  tapping No Pwr (Shift -), and engage the
brakes by tapping Brakes (0).

Aircraft  Carriers:  Landing on a carrier is slightly more difficult, since
you must touch down in the arrestor cables area.  To avoid overshooting the
cables,  increase  your  descent by lowering the nose a little, then at the
last second extend the air brake by tapping Brakes (0) as you pull the nose
up.

If  you  miss  the  carriers  arrestor cables, don`t bother trying to touch
down.  Instead close the brakes tap the Max Pwr (Shift +).

Offensive Actions

This section provides a short primer on how to use your weapons.  Also, see
page  139,  for  a  chart  indicating  your  various weapon's effectiveness
against various targets

Finding And Hitting A Target

1.  Find the Target:  Your primary and secondary targets are stored in your
INS,  initially as waypoint 2 and 3.  If you've moved the waypoint, you can
reset them by pressing Reset Way Pt (Shift F8).

To  reach the target, call up the waypoints by pressing Select Way Pt (F7),
select  the  appropriate  waypoint  by tapping Next Point (Shift/keypad 3),
then steer toward it following the INS cursor above the HUD Heading Scale.

2.   Check  HUD  Mode:   Change the HUD to the correct mode.  Use HUD modes
(F2)  to  select the right mode:  AIR (for firing at aircraft), or GND (for
firing at ground targets)

3.   Use  Tracking  Camera:   Lock  your tracking/targeting system onto the
nearest  target ahead, by tapping Cam Ahead (/).  The display remains blank
if there are no targets ahead within 80 to 100 km.

To  track  other  targets,  tap  Select 7arget (B).  The tracking/targeting
system  is  limited  to  targets  stored in your onboard computer database.
This  group  of  course always includes your primary and secondary targets.
To  find  the  right  target, you may have to tap Select Target (B) several
times.   When  the  primary  or secondary target is located, your right MFD
informs you

To  track  a  target  not stored in your onboard computer tap Designate New
Target (N).  The nearest potential target ahead is temporarily added to the
computers database.  Once you've added a target to the database, it remains
in the computer and becomes part of the group that Select Target (B) cycles
through.  You can store only one new target in the database at a time.

4.   Select  Weapon:   Tap  Select  Weapon (Space Bar) to cycle through the
weapons in your bays (Your cannon is always available.)

Make sure you have the correct weapon selected.  The size and colour of the
Tracking  Box  on  the  HUD  indicates  how effective the current weapon is
against the target (see Display Colors Summary in the Appendix).

5.  Aim and Fire:  Different weapons are aimed in different ways, described
below.   Depending  on the weapon selected, make sure it is correctly aimed
at the target before you fire.

6.  Observe Results:  Friendly AWACS aircraft observing your mission report
the  results.   Sometimes  a  hit  damages  a target without destroying it,
sometimes  you  miss  entirely,  and  other times a hit may be ineffective.
Ineffective  hits  are  caused  by  using  the wrong weapon, or because the
weapon malfunctioned.

All  your missiles are self guided (fire and-forget) weapons, and there are
several  available to you.  Some are used against enemy aircraft and others
are  used  against  ground targets.  All fire-and forget missiles are aimed
and fired in a similar fashion (described below).

Missile  Targeting  Envelope:   If the HUD is in Air mode and an air to air
missile  is  your current weapon, the Missile Targeting Envelope appears on
the  HUD  outlining  the  limits of your missile's seeker head; though your
Tracking  Camera  can lock-on to a target any where, the air-to air missile
itself  can lock on to in range enemy aircraft only within this circle.  In
CND  mode,  no targeting envelope appears, but a missile cannot lock onto a
target that is not currently visible through your HUD.

Oval  Lock-on:   When  the Tracking Box turns oval (and the "LOCK" light on
the  console  begins  flashing), the missile is locked on to the target and
has  a  good  chance  of  hitting.  When the oval turns red (and the "LOCK"
light  stops  flashing)  the  missile has superior accuracy.  Additionally,
when  the  missile locks-on, a box (the "Lock Box") appears in the Tracking
Camera  display, and when you have attained superior accuracy, the Lock Box
begins repeatedly contracting.

To  fire,  open  the weapons bay by tapping Bay Doors (8) and then tap Fire
Weapon (Return/Enter).

Restrictions and Suggestions:  Missiles drop about 300-400` - with whatever
airspeed,  climb  rate,  or dive rate your plane has before their own power
carries  them  away.   As a general rule, launching below 500 or in a power
dive  is  not a good idea, and may even be dangerous.  It is also unwise to
launch  while  in  a tight turn or inverted, as the missile may tumble when
leaving  the  bay,  losing guidance or even smashing into your plane.  Once
the  missile  is  launched  you can change to new targets, new weapons, and
maneuver as you wish.

Your  cannon  has a maximum range of 6 km and an effective range of about 3
km.

Air-to-Air  Anticipation  Firing:  Your cannon's fire control system uses a
"historical  gunsight"  that  shows  where your shells would be landing, if
you`d  fired  a few seconds ago.  Unless you're tracking a target, the fire
control  system  assumes  the  range to be 6 km, and places the gunsight to
show where the shells would be had

If  you  are  tracking  a  target, the system uses the current range to the
target to calculate where to place the sight on your HUD.  The Tracking Box
shows  the  targeted  enemy airplane and the range to the target appears in
the right MFD.

To  fire, you must "anticipate" when the enemy and your gunsight will meet.
For example, if the enemy and your gunsight are converging and the range to
the  target  is  6  km.   You  should open fire about 6 seconds before they
converge.   If  you  estimated  correctly,  they will converge just as your
gunsight moves onto them.

Air-to-Ground  Walking Fire:  Attacking ground targets is much easier since
they  don`t  move.   The  easiest  way  is  by "walking" your fire over the
target.   Do  this by flying low (about 500'), opening fire about 6 km from
the target and observing where the shells hit the ground.  Guide your plane
to  "push"  the  advancing explosions onto the target.  Unfortunately, this
technique consumes ammo rapidly unless you fire short, well-spaced bursts

Bombing

Laser  guided bombs are essentially motorless missiles that glide from your
plane  to  a target "painted" by the PAVE TACK laser mounted on your plane.
Operating  these weapons is a lot like launching self guided missiles.  You
use the tracking / targeting system in exactly the same way with only a few
exceptions.

Oval  and  MFD lock-on:  The Tracking Box on the HUD frames your target and
the  Tracking  Camera is locked onto it.  When the Tracking Box turns oval,
the bomb is locked onto the reflected laser energy and has a good chance of
hitting.  When the oval turns red, the bomb has superior accuracy.

However,  because  you  must  release  the bomb so close to the target, you
often  can`t  see the Tracking Oval when it turns red; for this reason, you
must rely upon the console "LOCK" light and Lock Box in the Tracking Camera
to tell you when the optimal release time is.

The  Lock Box appears on the right MFD and the "LOCK" light begins flashing
when  the  Tracking  Box  turns  oval.   When  the  optimal release time is
reached,  the  "LOCK"  light ceases flashing, and the Lock Box on the right
MFD begins repeatedly contracting.

Toss  Bombing:  Glide bombs travel as fast as your plane, so if you release
at  low  altitude,  they  hit  the target when your plane is about directly
overhead; if you`re not careful the explosion can destroy you.

The  standard attack technique is called "toss bombing".  Approach fast and
level  at  about  500.   When 3-6 km from the target pitch up into a 30-40o
climb,  tap  Bay  Doors (8) to open the bay, and watch the right MFD.  When
optimal  release  time  is reached (the Lock Box begins contracting and the
"LOCK"  light  stops flashing), tap Fire Weapon (Return / Enter) to release
the bomb and turn away.

Level  Bombing:   You  can  also level bomb with glide bombs.  As a general
rule  though, you'll need to attack from at least 2,000 altitude.  Here you
can  lock onto the target at 4 km range.  Attack immediately and turn away.
Needless to say, however, high altitude attacks make you a sitting duck for
enemy radar and SAMs.

Restrictions and Suggestions:  You must keep the underside of your aircraft
facing  the  target until the bomb hits.  If not, the laser guidance breaks
and  the bomb will almost surely miss.  You can fly over the target instead
of  flying  past  at  an  angle,  but you must rise above 3,000` to do this
safely.   However,  the  blast  has a danger zone of roughly 3,000`, so you
must gain enough distance or altitude to avoid the blast.

Retarded Bombs

Retarded  bombs  are  unguided  but have parachutes or special fins to slow
them  down  very quickly as they fall.  As a result, you can be far away by
the time they impact, allowing safe low altitude bombing runs

Level  Bombing:  Dive bombing and toss bombing don`t produce useful results
with  retarded  bombs,  so  you  must  use  level  bombing in this standard
technique  for low altitude runs with retarded bombs, fly straight and fast
over  the  target at 600-800`, releasing the bomb(s) according to cues from
the Flightpath Guide and Ranging Bar on the HUD.

Flightpath   Guide:    When  using  retarded  bombs,  the  diamond-  shaped
Flightpath  Guide  appears  on  your  HUD.   Turn  to  align the Flightpath
indicator  to  the  Flightpath  Guide.   You  can  be  above  or  below the
Flightpath Guide without losing accuracy, but being left or right of it may
cause a miss.

Ranging  Bar:   As  you approach the target, the Ranging Bar appears on the
HUD.   As  you  near  the  target,  the  bar begins to collapse; the cue to
release is when the line becomes a single dot.  You may wish to extend your
brakes to make the bombing run more manageable

To  Release  the  Bomb, tap Bay Doors (8) to open the bay, then Fire Weapon
(Return)  to  release  the weapon if your brakes are extended, retract them
immediately after launch to escape the blast area.

Restrictions  and  Suggestions:   Retarded bombs are the easiest and safest
weapons to use, and one of the most popular among USAF pilots.  If you keep
up speed in your bombing run, you can safely release from 600`, even though
the  blast  area  is 3,000`.  The Ranging Bar and Flightpath Guide flash if
you're  too  low for safe release However, the targeting system predictions
assume  you'll  continue  to  fly  "as  is".   If  you drop the bomb.  then
immediately  turn  up  and  away,  you could drop a bomb within the "danger
area" and escape.

Free Fall Bombs

These  are traditional bombs that arc down at high speed toward the target.
In level bombing.  The techniques for using them are identical to those for
retarded  bombs  except  that you need to be considerably higher to release
them  safely.   A  safe  minimum altitude for releasing a free fall bomb in
level bombing is 3,000` as opposed to 600` for retarded bombs

Level Bombing:  You use the Flightpath Guide and Ranging Bar just as you do
or retarded bombs, but you have one additional HUD cue:  the Bombsight Fall
line and Bullseye.  In level bombing this indicator may be ignored

Bombsight  Fall-line and Bullseye:  This indicator appears on your HUD as a
line  extending from your Flightpath Indicator to the place on the ground a
bomb would hit were it released now.  At that point is a red oval bullseye.
In  level bombing the fall line indicator usually extends off the bottom of
the  HUD,  with the bullseye out of sight below.  But in dive bombing it is
indispensable.

Dive  Bombing:  To make a dive bombing at tack, start by flying low to ward
the  target.   Switch your HUD to GND mode, make sure the correct weapon is
selected (Mk82-0 Slick or Mk 122 Fireye), and put your Tracking Camera onto
the target.  Now follow these steps:

1.   Guide  on  the  Bomb sight Flight Path:  Approach the target by flying
straight  at  the diamond shaped bombing flight path indi cator.  It`s okay
if  the  indica  tor is above or below your flight path, but make sure it`s
not to the left or right.

2.Climb  to Attack Point:  When the target is about 6 km away (you can tell
by  looking  at  the right MFD), zoom up into a 55o climb to an altitude of
8.000'  opening  your  bay  doors  as  you climb (tap Bay Doors (8)).  Your
objective is to reach 8,000` about 1.5-2 km from the target.

3.Dive  on to the Target:  Level out, flick open the brakes (tapBrakes (0).
At  just  under  1 km away, push down into a steep (80o) dive and align the
Bomb  Bullseye  with  the target box.  Keep an eye on your altitude because
you  must release the bomb before reaching 3.000.  If you can`t line up the
Bullseye and Tracking Box before reaching 3,000` pull out and try again.

4.   Release Bomb and Turn Away:  If you manage to keep the bullseye steady
within  the  target  box before reaching 3,000`, release a bomb immediately
(tap  Fire  Weapon  (Return)), then another if possible.  After the release
pull up sharply and roll away in a 90o turn.  Close the brake (0) as you do
this.   To  maintain maximum speed into the turn.  Then close the bay doors
(8)

Suggestions:   The  zoom  climb to 8,000` is the most critical phase of the
attack.   If  performed  flawlessly, a 55o climb will cover 4 km of ground,
assuming  you  start  at  maximum level speed at 200` and wish to arrive at
8,000`.   Some  pilots  prefer to use a slightly shallower zoom climb up to
10,000`, but this exposes you longer to enemy detection

Climbing to a dive bombing position usually broadcasts your presence to the
opposition.   Therefore, once you`re turning away from the target after the
bombing run look over and check the missile warning lights for an attack

The  most common mistake when dive bombing is forgetting to open the brakes
at  the  top of the climb.  With the brakes closed you plummet so fast it`s
almost  impossible  to  line  up  the  target  and  release the bomb before
reaching 3,000`.

Restrictions:   The  HUD  bombing  symbols flash if you're within the blast
area  of the bomb (within 3,000` of the predicted drop point).  Do not drop
the bomb unless you`re confident you can escape the blast

Photos And Special Equipment

The  135mm/IR  Camera  is a reconnaissance camera mounted in a weapons bay.
It  is  fixed forward (unlike your target Tracking Camera, which moves) and
looks down.

Camera Operation:  To configure your HUD and cockpit for camera operations:

1 Switch the HUD to GND mode by tapping HUD mode (F2)

2.   Select  the bay containing the camera by tapping Select Weapons (Space
Bar).

3.   Aim  the  Tracking  Camera at the target by tapping Cam Ahead (/); tap
Select Target (B) if necessary.

4.  Tap Bay Doors (8) to open the bay doors.

Taking  Pictures:  When you open the bay, you see the ground below and just
ahead of your plane in the right MFD, which is now viewing through the lens
of  the  camera.  Fly so that the cross symbol ("+") in the lower center of
the  HUD passes through the center of the Tracking Box.  When this happens,
you`ll  see the target pass through the lens on the right MFD.  As it does,
hit  Fire  Weapon  (Return) one or more times to take the pictures.  You'll
see  a  message  on  the HUD indicating a good picture (when and if you get
one).

Special Equipment

Delivering or Picking up Equipment:  As a stealth pilot, you`ll be required
to make deliveries of highly classified materials; you may also be asked to
pick  up top secret items.  Finding a secret airbase and landing there is a
major  challenge.   They have no ILS system just a few flares at either end
of  the  runway!  Furthurmore, the runway is very short; it's only half the
length of a runway at a major airbase

To  pick  up or deliver equipment at a secret airbase, you must safely land
at  the  airbase.   Equipment  is  unloaded  or  materials delivered to you
automatically.   A mes sage in the HUD indicates when this has occurred and
you can take off again.

Dropping  Equipment:   To  drop  equipment,  tap Select Weapons (Space Bar)
until "EQUIP" appears in the lower left corner of the HUD Tap Bay Doors (8)
to  open  the  bay,  then,  as  you  pass over the radio beacon, launch the
equipment by tapping Fire Weapons (Return/Enter).

The minimum safe altitude to drop equipment is 500`.  Try to avoid dropping
it  from altitudes above 1,000`, since the bigher you are the less accurate
the drop.

Defensive Actions

Radar And Stealth Tactics

Radar  sends high frequency electromagnetic waves through the atmosphere at
virtually  light speed.  These waves are reflected from solid object - some
return  to  the  radar  set,  which  includes a receiver.  By measuring the
strength  and angles of returning waves, and time it took to return, radars
estimate the range, position, heading, and size of an object.

Radar  waves  bounce  best from solid, dense, flat, perpendicular surfaces.
Tradi-  tional  aircraft  shapes,  especially  aircraft  engine intakes and
vertical tail fins make excellent radar reflectors.

Radar  Effectiveness:   The  effectiveness  of  radar  varies with terrain,
range, and ype (pulse or Doppler).  Radar is most effective over open water
or  flat  countryside.   In wooded and rolling hills radar effectiveness is
less,  while  in  mountainous country it is greatly reduced.  The lower the
radar  effectiveness,  the  weaker  the  signal on your EMV scale; the bars
representing enemy radar signals become shorter.

Radar  Range:   Radar  effectiveness is dramatically affected by range; the
closer  you  are  to  a  radar, the stronger its signal Maximum range for a
radar varies dramati- cally with the set.  As enemy radars emit signals you
can graphically see their ranges on the Satellite/Radar map on the left MFD
(Maps, F3)

Pulse  Radar:   Pulse radar is represented by dotted arcs on your satellite
map.   It  is least effective when your nose or tail is pointing toward it,
and  most effective when you fly at right angles to it.  Therefore a common
tactic  is  to  fly  directly  at a pulse radar, then just after it emits a
signal make a tight turn and fly away from it again.

Doppler  Radar:   Doppler  radar  is  represented  by  solid  arcs  on your
satellite  map; it is generally more powerful than pulse.  Doppler radar is
most  effective  when  you`re  flying  toward  or  away  from it, and least
effective when you fly at right angles to it.  Therefore a common tactic is
to fly toward a Doppler until just before it detects you, then turn and fly
in an arc around it, keeping a constant distance.

Stealth Technology

The  radar  reflections  of  an  object  are  greatly  reduced if its shape
minimizes  the  returning  waves.  This does not make the object invisible,
but  does  make it very hard to "see." For example, if a normal airplane is
visible  to radar at 200 km, a carefully shaped airplane might be invisible
be-  yond  50  km!   Creating this shape in a form that is also aerodynamic
requires  ex  tremely  complex computer modeling.  As the world's leader in
computer  applica tions, it's inevitable that the US would be first in this
field.   The  SR-71  spyplane  is an early example of such shapes in aerody
namics;  the  redesign of the B-1 bomber fuselage is another example.  Both
these  aircraft,  though,  have curved fuselages that tend to scatter radar
energy   equally   in  all  directions,  and  therefore  aren't  en  tirely
successful.

In  addition  to shape, certain rubber and ceramic compounds "absorb" radar
waves,  making  the  return  signal  weaker.   Known  generically  as Radar
Absorbent Material (RAM), it can be incorporated into paints, or planted in
"wedges" along the surface of a wing or fuselage.

Finally,  an airplane's heat signature is an important consideration.  Many
air-  plane  killing  missiles  (IR  guided ones) home on heat sources like
friction  heated  parts  of  the craft, such as leading edges of the wings,
tail,  and  air  intakes.  The main defense against heat seekers is heat-re
sistant materials, and masking and dis persal of hot engine exhaust.

The  F-117A  is  a  combination  of  all  these  design considerations.  It
sacrifices  speed,  maneuverability,  and payload for maximum stealth.  The
fuselage  is made up entirely of flat "facets" that scatter radar energy in
a  controlled.   predictable  pattern, which, under most circumstances will
not  reflect radar transmissions back to the transmitter Even if the energy
does  strike  one  of  the  plane's flat surfaces, the effect is transitory
because  the  angle  of  incidence is constantly changing due to the planes
motion  relative  to the transmitter.  The tail is twinned, does not extend
vertically,  and  is  swept  back  like  the wings themselves so that radar
energy  is  reflected  45o  left and right into the sky behind the aircraft
(there  is  no  other  reason  for  the  subsonic F-117A to have near delta
wings).   All  vertical  surfaces  on the F-117A are angled at least 30o so
that, in level flight, no truly vertical surfaces are present.

The  air  intakes  of  the engines are masked upper and lower hull and wing
surfaces  are  covered with RAM.  All weapons are carried internally, since
external  pylons and armaments are excellent radar reflectors.  All leading
edges incorporate heat resistant surfaces and are as sharp as possible both
to  reduce  air  friction  and  to  reflect  radar  energy  away  from  the
transmitter.

Stealth  also demands a new approach to combat operations.  For decades jet
aircraft  have  carried  radars  of  increasing  power,  using  them to aim
weapons,  check  altitude,  and  fly  low  at  high speeds.  All this radar
broadcasting  reveals  a  plane  long  before  enemy radars discover it.  A
stealth  aircraft must fly without active radar emissions.  The F-117A uses
visual, thermal, and laser systems instead of radars.  In addition.  It has
a  radio  burst  decoder  that  is  compatible with other USAF transmission
equipment.   On an active mission the F-117A constantly receices data burst
from friendly AWACS planes and ground radars.

Overall,  the  F-117A  is  most  difficult to detect at very low altitudes.
Even  at  higher  altitudes  (over 10,000`) it is far less visible on radar
than  a  normal aircraft.  This not only allows the F-117A to "sneak up" on
the enemy.  It also reduces the range and accuracy of enemy weapons

Stealth Tactics

EMV:   The  F-117A`s  stealth  configuration  is most effective when flying
level  at  low  altitudes (at 500` or less and preferably about 200').  The
EMV  is  further  reduced if the engines are throttled back to cruise speed
(70%  power).   Level flight, which presents a horizontal profile, is best.
The steeper the turn, the more topside or underside surface is presented as
a radar reflector, and thus your EMV rises.

With  respect  to Doppler radar, your flight path is of crucial importance.
Changing  distance  relative  to  a  Dop  pler  radar increases the risk of
detection  many  fold.  If you remain at a constant distance, arcing around
the radar, Doppler detection ability drops dramatically.

Opening  the  bay doors, firing a weapon, or using the ECM jammer all raise
your  EMV, making the plane more visible.  On the plus side, if you want to
deliberately  lure the enemy to a certain location without wasting a decoy,
then  turning  on your jammer, opening the bay, and spi ralling upward in a
tight  turn  often raises the EMV enough to make you visible.  You can then
close up, dive down to 200` again, and zoom away while they chase phantoms.

Threading the Needle:  As a stealth pilot, you must plan carefully, seeking
the best route through en emy radar defenses.  You must find a route in and
out  that  either  makes  you  invisible,  or visible for the shortest time
possible.

Penetrating  enemy  radar  umbrellas  is  tricky.   Re member to arc around
Doppler  radars,  but fly directly toward (or away from) pulse radars.  The
plotting  of  paths  through radar areas is sometimes termed "threading the
needle."

Pulse  radars  are  shorter  ranged and less efficient so Dopplers are your
biggest  problem.   If you must fly into a pulse radar's effective range to
avoid  a  Doppler,  you can arc around just inside and hope your EMV is low
enough, and their crews sleepy enough that they don`t see you.

Even  the  best  of  plans must be modified once the mission starts.  Enemy
fighters  patrols  and  IL-76  Mainstays can force you to change your plan,
while  the  periodic  shut  downs  of  enemy  radars  can suddenly open new
opportunities.  You must be flexible

Low  Altitude Tactics:  On long missions with flight legs outside effective
enemy  radar  range  it's perfectly safe to use the autopilot and cruise at
500`.   When  within enemy radar range, get as low as you can.  Fly through
valleys - between hills and mountains if possible.  Although coming up over
ridge  lines  is  fun,  every  time  you crest a ridge you take a chance of
detection.

One  especially  sneaky  tactic  is to fly extremely low (200` or less) and
throttle  back  your  engine to about 30%.  You'll need to extend flaps and
pitch up to stay airbourne, but your EMV gets extremely low.

Decoys:In  Cold or Limited War, you must avoid leaving a positive radar ID.
If your flight path takes you too close to enemy radar, you can try leaving
one  or  two  decoys behind.  This can prevent them from getting a positive
radar ID on you.

Dash:   Many  radars  turn  off  periodically if you see a critical Doppler
radar  station stop broadcasting.  That may give you just the time you need
to  get past without being seen.  Dashing through a radar`s area while he`s
off  the  air  is  always risky; you never know if he`ll "wake up" and find
you, but sometimes there's no other way.

Blast:  If you can't think of any better way to get through the enemy radar
screen  a  final  device  is  to open a gap in the radar defenses.  Using a
Maverick  or  HARM  missile  to destroy a radar at some critical sites.  Of
course.   you`ve  got  to dash through the gap and get away quickly.  Since
enemy  aircraft are drawn like flies to the site of an attack.  Other radar
stations  will  "wake  up" and stay on the air after an attack.  One way to
"set  up  "a  blast attack is show yourself briefly in one location drawing
enemy fighters away from the area you plan to fly through and/or attack

Disappearing:   If  you  are detected and attacked by radar guided missiles
(either  the  "TRAK" light is on, or the "RAD" missile warning is lighted),
you  can  evade  the attack by reducing your EMV.  If the enemy radar loses
sight  of  you  the  missile  loses  guidance  and  flies  blindly ahead it
continues  until  either  the  enemy finds you again and steers the missile
back on course, or the missile runs out of fuel.

Dealing With Surface To Air Missiles (SAMs)

To  cope  with  enemy  SAMs,  you should understand the principles of their
opera tion.  Then you can intelligently apply ap propriate defenses.

Radar-Controlled SAMs

Concept:   Medium-  and  long  ranged SAMs are controlled by radar.  Radar-
guided missiles appear as yellow lines on your Tactical Display (left MFD).
There  are three types of radar guided SAMs:  beam riders, semi active, and
command guid- ance.  All use the same three-step process to engage targets:

1  Radar  search:   Search  radar  scans  the sky for alien planes.  Search
radars  scan an entire 360∞ area periodically (watch your EMV and satellite
map for this).

2  Radar  tracking:   When a search ra dar finds your plane, it "hands off"
the prospective target to a narrow beam fire control radar, usually running
on  a  differ  ent frequency, which locks onto your craft (the "TRAK" light
illuminates).

3.   Radar  control:   When  the  operators  are  sure the beam is tracking
correctly they launch a missile (The "RAD" light illuminates).

The narrow beam radar continues tracking your plane so the missile's course
can  be updated and corrected.  There are two common methods of doing this.
The  older  "beam rider" (or "command guid- ance") technique, and the newer
"semi active homing" technique.

Beam  Rider  SAMs:  While the narrow beam radar continues tracking you, the
SAM  guides  along  the beam.  As long as the tracking beam remains on your
plane, the SAM will hit.

Semi-Active  SAMs:   Semi active SAMs have radar receivers and computers on
board.   The  tracking radar on the ground "paints" the target with a radar
beam and the missiles nose receiver "catches" the reflections.  The missile
homes on these reflections until it hits you.

Command  Guidance  SAMs:   These modern missiles use semi active guid ance,
but  the firer has a command link to the missile, as well, which he can use
to override the semi active guidance.  This means that if the missile loses
guidance  or  is  otherwise  confused,  the  ground controller can turn the
missile around and try again.

Evading Radar-Guided SAMs

Reduce  EMV:  The basic way to evade radar-guided SAMs is to disappear from
their  radar.   If  their signals are just barely overlapping your EMV, you
should find a way to simply "disappear." Obviously the further you are from
the  enemy  radar, the weaker the signal.  Therefore you may wish to simply
turn  and run until the signal is too weak to "see" you.  If the enemy is a
Doppler  radar,  at  various  points you should turn parallel to the radar.
When you do his signal weakens.  Also reducing your altitude, lowering your
engine  power, and levelling out your flight will help.  Make sure your bay
is closed, your gear up, and the ECM jammer is off.

Decoys:   A  decoy  will fool enemy radar for 20 to 60 seconds depending on
the  skill  of  the  enemy.   During this time missiles (and aircraft) will
pursue  the  decoy instead of you.  This gives you a perfect opportunity to
outmaneuver the missile by escaping its 45o field of view

ECM:   Your  ECM (electronic counter measures) radar jammer is an excellent
defense  against  beam  riders.   As  long  as it's running they are flying
blind,  and  therefore  unable  to hit you.  ECM jammers are useful only at
long  range against semi active SAMs.  Remember that if you continue flying
toward  a jammed semi active missile, eventually it will "burn through" and
start homing on you.

Caution:   ECM jamming makes a lot of noise.  Therefore, don`t use a jammer
against semi active SAMs unless you're going to turn away.

Chaff:   Each  chaff cartridge deploys a cloud of tiny tin-foil strips that
reflect  enemy radar.  For two or more seconds the strips form a huge radar
reflector, effectively blinding the missile, like a smoke screen Therefore,
the  classic  chaff technique is to wait until the missile is just a couple
seconds away (i.e., when the Missile Proximity Klaxon sounds).

At  that  instant,  tap  Chaff (1) to fire a chaff cartridge and turn away.
The  blinded missile will fly straight into the chaff.  Warning:  Chaff may
not  fool a Doppler guided missile such as SA-10, SA-12, SA-N-6, or AA-10).
In   this   case   you   must   turn  perpendicular  to  the  missile  (see
"Outmaneuvering Missiles" below).

Warnings  and Responses:  Your F-117A gives you four separate warnings that
you are under missile attack:

1.   Your first warning of a radar SAM attack appears on your EMV scale and
your HUD when enemy search radar finds you:  you'll notice the search radar
signal  overlap your EMV, the EMV light illuminates briefly, a warning beep
sounds, and a message appears on the HUD.

2.   Your  second warning is when the narrow beam tracking radar locks onto
your  plane,  setting  off the "TRAK" light on your console, and initiating
another  warning  tone.   During these stages reducing the EMV is your best
response

3.   Your  third  and  most important warning comes when a missile has been
launched  and  is  tracking  you:   the  "RAD" missile warning light begins
flashing  and  another message stating the type of missile launched appears
on  your HUD.  Reducing your EMV at this point may derail the enemy attack,
but  if you.re too close to the radar you must use other defenses.  Against
a  beam-rider  turn  on  the  ECM  jammer  (tap ECM (4)) and change course.
Against  a  semi-active  missile  either jam with ECM or drop a decoy, then
change  course  (some  pilots  use  both - decoy first, then the jammer for
insurance).  However, this technique only makes sense if you can escape the
missiles 45o field of view before the decoy and/or ECM effects end.

4.   Your final warning is the Missile Proximity Klaxon.  which sounds when
the  missile is just a few of seconds away.  Check the console if the "RAD"
light  is  flashing  then  a  radar missile is inbound.  Immediately drop a
chaff cartridge and turn away.

Infrared (IR) Homing SAMs

Concept:   Short range SAMs are usually IR homing IR missiles appear as red
lines  on  your  Tactical  Display  (left MFD).  Like radar guided SAMs the
largest and most powerful use a three step process to find and engage you:

1.  Radar search:  A search radar finds your aircraft (watch the EMV scale)

2.   Radar  tracking:   A  tracking radar follows your aircraft (the "TRAK"
light)

3 Missile launch:  The IR homing missile is launched (the "IR" light)

For  the  remainder  of  the  flight  to  the  target,  tracking  radar  is
unnecessary, because the missile guides itself.

Some shorter ranged IR SAMs use a much simpler method:

1  Search:   The  enemy  detects  you  either  with  search radar or simple
eyesight.

2 Missile lock on:  The missile "locks on" to hot surfaces of your plane

3 Missile launch:  The missile is launched and guides itself to the target.

Shoulder-Launched  IR  SAMs:   The  existence of man portable IR SAMs makes
your life difficult.  The enemy frequently waits until point blank range to
launch  these missiles, the preferred technique being to launch them during
your attack run.

Carried  by  infantrymen, in trucks and jeeps, or stacked inside a building
door,  they  are  virtually undetectable until fired.  Wherever significant
enemy military ground forces are deployed you can expect to encounter these
weapons.   This  includes  rear  area  headquarters  and  depots as well as
front-line  troops (you`ll know where these concentrations are expectted to
be from your intelligence briefing).

First-generation  IR Homers:  Early IR homing systems required a large heat
signature  to  "lock-on"  to.   The  only  area of a jet hot enough was the
engine  exhaust,  so the missile wouldn't "lock on" until aimed at the rear
of  the  plane.  Furthur, the homing head wasn`t sophisticated or sensitive
enough to distinguish between the jet exhaust and the sun or even hot rocks
on the ground

Your  IR jammer is almost guaranteed to confuse first generation IR homers.
As  long  as  you leave the jammer on, the missile will be unable to follow
your plane Remember, though, that the jammer slows you down, and eventually
overheats, which shuts it off automatically

You  can  even  outmaneuver first-generation IR missiles by turning tightly
toward  them  This "rotates" your hot exhaust away from the missile's view.
The  missile  may  try  to  turn  and follow but a tight enough turn always
outmaneuvers it (see "Outmaneu-

Second-generation  IR  Homers:   Modern  IR  homing  systems  are  far more
effective.   They  are  fine  tuned  to  "recognize" temperature variations
typical  of  aircraft,  including  not  only  the exhaust, but all surfaces
heated  by  air  friction.  This heating typically occurs at the nose, wing
roots,  and  across  the  upper  surfaces  of the plane.  Your IR jammer is
effective only at long ranges against second generation IR homers.

Evading IR SAMs

Reduce  EMV:   Unfortunately,  reducing your EMV has no effect upon IR SAMs
already  launched,  but  if  you  become  invisible to search radar, it can
prevent  the  enemy  from  launching others.  EMV reduction methods are the
same as described above.

Decoys:  A decoy will fool enemy IR missiles for 15 to 6O seconds.  Tactics
are  therefore  like  those  for  decoys  against radar guided missiles get
outside the missiles view before the decoy expires.

IR  Jammers:   This device is a heat strobe that sends out heat pulses that
confuse  a missile's guidance system.  Unfortunately this equipment employs
a  generator  to provide power.  reducing your airspeed by roughly 15%.  In
addition, it shuts down before it overheats and melts and will not function
again until sufficiently cooled.

First generation IR missiles are easily confused at almost any range by the
IR  jammer, but second generation IR missiles are more "intelligent".  They
are  "fooled" by IR jammers only at long ranges (in fact, at closer ranges,
some  second  generation  IR  seekers actually lock onto the jammer) It is,
therefore,  unwise - and sometimes dangerous to leave a jammer running when
second generation IR missiles are close

Flares:   Although  called  "flares,"  these  are  small, finely tuned heat
decoys.   A  flare  lures  IR  missiles  toward  it, but only during the 25
seconds  it  burns.   After  that  the  flare  dies and the missile resumes
seeking.   Therefore,  wait for the Missile Proximity Klaxon, drop a flare.
then turn away.

Warnings  and Responses:  Your first warning of an IR missile attack may be
identical  to  that  of  a  radar  guided  one:  your EMV light illuminates
briefly,  you  hear  a  warning beep, and a message appears on the HUD.  At
that  point  its  immpossible to tell whether the detecting radar site will
launch  an  IR or radar guided SAM.  However, when the missile is launched,
the "IR" missile warning light begins flashing and you receive a message on
the HUD announcing the type of missile launched.

In  many  cases,  however,  your  first warning of an IR attack is the "IR"
missile  warning  light,  because  many IR SAMs don`t use search radar just
eyesight searching

If  you  know  the missile is a first generation, (which you will if you`ve
studied up on enemy SAMs), you can turn on the IR jammer and change course.
Otherwise you`ll have to wait for the Missile Proximity Klaxon which may be
a  very  short  time  because  many  IR  missiles are fired from very short
ranges.   Often, the flashing, "IR" light is followed almost immediately by
the klaxon.  When you hear the klaxon and see the "IR" light flashing, your
first act must be to drop a flare and dodge!

Alternatively,  of course, you can outmaneuver the missile if you`re really
good.

Outmaneuvering Missiles

It`s  important  to  remember  that  defense  devices aren't perfect.  Some
missiles  can  "burn through" ECM, all continue seeking after your decoy or
chaff  expires,  and  Doppler  missiles  will ignore chaff if you're on the
wrong  course.   Therefore  it`s important to maneuver out of the missile's
field  of  view when the defense expires.  if you don't, the missile may re
acquire  you  and resume tracking!  (A truly skillful pilot may outmaneuver
an  enemy  missile  without  any mechanical aid.  Smart pilots normally use
both their equipment and their skills.)

Techniques   for   outmaneuvering   IR  missiles  and  radar  missiles  are
essentially  the  same.   But since IR missiles tend to be smaller and more
maneuverable - second generation IRs are often the most maneuverable you`re
best off relying on decoys, jammers and/or flares against them.

Evading  the  Missile's  View:   SAMs can only "home" on targets within the
acquisition  arc of their seeker.  This arc is a bare 45o directly in front
of  the  missile.   If  decoys,  jammers, or whatever temporarily confuse a
missile.  You can evade attack by moving outside this 45o arc.  Usually the
quickest escape course is one perpendicular to the missile's heading.

Turning inside a Missile:  When a missile is close, you still have a chance
to  outmaneuver  it, because you can turn faster than it can.  If a missile
is  trying  to fly up your tail, roll over onto a wingtip for a tight turn,
then pull straight back on the control stick.  Keep an eye on your airspeed
because  the plane will soon the plane will stall in this attitude, but the
missile makes a wider turn, causing it to zoom past harmlessly

Turning toward a Missile:  If a SAM approaches you from the side, gradually
turn toward it.  Increasing the tightness of your turn as it comes closer

The   objective   is   to   keep  the  missile's  course  at  right  angles
(perpendicular) to your own.  This tactic works because the missile can not
turn with you.  Instead it gradually falls behind zooming past your tail.

Evading  Frontal  Attacks:   If  a  SAM approaches you from the front, wait
until  its  between  8 and 12 km away (about two thirds of a grid square on
the  tactical display).  Then make a quick 90o turn.  This puts the missile
facing your side.  Now roll over 180o and turn toward the missile.

Doppler  Missiles:   Enemy  missiles  with  Doppler  guidance systems are a
special  danger.   These missiles will not home on chaff unless your course
is  perpendicular  (at right angles to) the missile.  If the missile chases
you  from  the  rear  or  attacks from straight ahead, chaff has no effect.
Only  three  SAMs  currently  have  Doppler guidance:  the SA-10 SA-12, and
SA-N-6.  Only one air to air missile has Doppler guidance the AA-10.

AIR-TO-AIR DUELS

Using Air To Air Missiles (AAMs)

The  MicroProse  F-117A  (with  "enhanced capability") carries two types of
AAMs;  the AIM-120 AMRAAM and the AIM-9M "Sidewinder." (The Lockheed F-117A
carries  no  to-air weapons at all; it's never expected to be seen by enemy
fighters,  much  less  go out looking for a fight with them.) Like all your
missiles,  these  AAMs  are self guided, "fire and-forget" weapons that are
easy  to  use  and possibly the world`s best.  The techniques for targeting
and  firing  these  weapons  are  identical  to those for other self guided
missiles (see page 68)

AIM-120  AMRAAMS:   Your  AIM  120  AMRAAM  missile  is  one  of  the  best
medium-range  weapons in the world.  It is the only "fire and forget" radar
guided  missile  in US inventory.  It has sufficient circuitry to penetrate
most  defenses,  and  maneuver-  ability  enough  to  chase down most enemy
fighters,  not  to mention bombers and transports.  Because the AIM-120 has
roughly  twice  the  range of the Sidewinder pilots typically open with the
AIM-120,  then  switch to Sidewinders if any enemy aircraft survive to that
range.

AIM-9M Sidewinders:  The short range AIM-9M Sidewinder is probably the best
dogfighting missile in the world.  It is more maneuverable than the AMRAAM,
giving  it  a  better chance of "hanging on" to a twisting, turning target.
Since  it  is  IR  guided.  The best place to fire the Sidewinder is up the
enemy's tailpipes.  Next is from above, diving down onto the top (hot side)
of  the  enemy plane.  The third best position is directly into the enemy's
nose.   Shots  against  an enemy plane as it crosses in front of you, or at
its underside (the cold side) have very little chance of hitting.  The main
weakness of the Sidewinder is its limited range

Missile  Ranges:   The  maximum  range of a missile depends not only on its
motor,  but  your  plane's  speed  at  launch  and  the  direction of enemy
movement.  The initial "lock on" range corresponds to missile maximum range
if  you're  at  maximum  speed.  However, if you're moving more slowly, the
missile may not get the extra boost needed to reach the target.

A much more important consideration is the enemy's heading relative to you.
If  he`s flying toward you.  Even a maximum range launch is likely to reach
him.   However,  if  the  target is flying away the missile may have a long
"stern  chase"  ahead  of it.  You should probably wait for optimal lock on
before launching.

Technique:   When  firing  a missile, always remember to open the bay doors
and  wait  for the lock-on.  If you don't wait for the target box to become
oval shaped, you`re firing without lock-on, and will almost certainly miss.
Then  look at your airspeed.  If you're moving fast (around 500 kts) or the
target  is  closing,  a  maximum  range  lock  on  shot  will probably hit.
However, if, your speed is low or the target is flying away from you should
wait until the range closes, ideally until the oval turns red.

Missile  accuracy  doesn't  take  into account enemy defensive equipment or
evasive  naneuvering.  First-line and elite fighter aircraft may prove more
difficult to hit.  although the "Mainstay" AEW&C craft maneuvers poorly, it
haa  superior  defensive  equipment.   You may find that guns are necessary
against Mainstays flown by a capable crew.

Firing  Attitude:   Also  remember that AAMs, like other missiles will fall
300-400`  before  their  motor can guide them away.  Until then the missile
has your speed and VVI if you're diving at the ground, the missile may slam
into  the  ground before it can fly away.  Firing in a tight turn, or while
inverted,  can  cause  the  missile to tumble as it leaves the weapons bay.
The wisest method is to fire only when you`re level and above 500 feet.

Target  Discrimination:   Sidewinders  and  AMRAAMs always home on the most
prominent  target,  which  is usually the nearest.  They will do so even if
you  were  tracking  someone else.  In Cold and Limited War, beware of this
limited  "brain  power" in your missiles.  You may be tracking a primary or
secondary  target,  fire  a  missile,  and  discover it goes for one of the
closer fighter escorts!

Notes:   Your  F-117A  uses  a  Tracking  Camera instead of weapon guidance
radars This system "downloads" appropriate launch parameters to the AIM-120
AMRAAM.   Although the AIM 120 itself uses radar, it is not activated until
the  missile  is  launched As a result, missile targeting does not increase
your  EMV.   Of  course  opening  the  bay  doors to fire does.  A skillful
stealth  pilot  opens  the  bay  doors  just  before  a launch, or during a
dogfight.

Using The 20mm Vulcan

The  Lockheed  F-117A  does  not have a cannon of any sort because it`s not
expected to need one; so if you prefer flying the Lockheed version, you can
ignore the following.  The MicroProse F-117A will definitely need a cannon,
and does, of course, carry a good one

Jet  aircraft  travel  so  fast  that  conventional machine guns and cannon
cannot  guarantee  a  hit:  a plane could literally fly between the shells.
Therefore,  modern  aircraft cannon are either a group of guns (such as the
twin 23mm cannons in many Russian MIGs) or a multi barrel Gatling gun (such
as  the six barrel 20mm M61A1 on most American jets).  Aircraft cannon have
an  effective  range of about 0.5-3 km and a maximum range of 6 km.  Inside
0.5 km there is a significant danger of "collateral damage."

More  About  the Historical Gunsight :  Your F-117A has the most modern and
advanced  gunsight available:  a "historical" gunsight with automatic laser
range  finding.   If  you're not tracking a target, this gunsight "assumes"
you  are  firing  at  maximum  range  (6  km).  If you're tracking a closer
target, the shorter range is used for gunsight calculations

The  gunsight  computer  constantly  calculates  range,  flight  path,  and
ballistics and displays where your shells would be if they were hitting the
target  now.   The  gunsight  continually  calculates  firing,  delays  the
appropriate   time  and  displays  potential  hits  as  they  would  occur.
Therefore,  the  sight  is  "assuming" you fired at the correct time in the
past.

The  gunsight  on  your  F-117A  uses  a  laser  range-finder sleved to the
Tracking Camera, rather than the traditional ranging radar.  This means you
can  use  your  gun  without  increasing  your EMV; however, when you begin
firing, of course, you create heat and this makes you more detectable.

Anticipation  Firing in Air-to-Air Engagements:  It takes about six seconds
for  M61A1 20mm shells to travel the maximum 6 kilometer range.  Therefore,
to hit a target you must judge the speed at which the target and your sight
coverage.   You  should  fire  about  six seconds before they meet.  If the
range  is  less  than  6 km, wait a little less.  For example, at 3 km wait
until target and sight are three seconds apart; at 1.5 km wait until target
and sight are one second apart, and so on.

You  can  use  this  sight like an old fashioned predicting sight.  That is
wait  until  the  sight  is  on  the target, then shoot.  But at 6 km range
you'll  have to hope the target stays on the same course for six seconds to
insure a hit.

In  short,  the  key to using a historical gunsight is anticipation.  Don`t
wait  for  the sight to reach the target.  Instead, learn to anticipate the
meeting of sight and target then shoot

Dealing With The Enemy

The best way to meet the enemy is to surprise him by sliding up behind him.
Enemy aircraft have only forward facing radars (except the IL-76 "Mainstay"
AEW&C  craft)  and will probably be unaware of your approach it you come up
from behind.

Traditionally  fighter pilots prefer to attack from above.  This gives them
an energy advantage in any dogfight, but missile tactics and the importance
of secrecy make height less valuable for a stealth pilot.  Gaining altitude
makes  you  visible  to  enemy  radar, which in turn may warn your targets.
Therefore,  approaching  low  and from behind is often wiser.  Only if your
missile  attacks  fail and the enemy discovers you should you begin to seek
an altitude advantage.

If  you're  surprised or "bounced" (attacked from above) by enemy fighters,
immedi  ately  look  for  incoming  missiles and take appropriate defensive
action.   Missiles  arrive  faster  than  aircraft,  and  therefore must be
avoided first.  Only then can you begin dogfighting or attempt to escape.

Missile Exchange

Often  an  air  to-air battle begins soon after you've de stroyed a target,
and  enemy fighters are vectored to intercept The result, quite frequently,
is a head-to-head face-off

In  this  Old West-style showdown each side starts with an exchange of long
to  medium  ranged  radar  guided missiles.  Be prepared to decoy, jam, and
possibly  chaff the "incoming." Once your radar missile is away switch to a
Sidewinder.   You  may  get a second close range missile shot if the AMRAAM
fails.

The  Early turn:  One of the most difficult, but useful maneuvers in a head
to  head  match is the early turn.  Against inexperienced pilots it's easy,
since  green horns usually keep boring in, hoping for a cannon shot Against
experienced  opponents an early turn requires fine timing; if you turn more
than  a  second  or  two  ahead  of  the  enemy  you're  telegraphing  your
intentions.  If you wait too long, you get no advantage.

Dealing with Enemy AAMs

Radar-Homing  AAMs:  The Russian AA-10 Alamo is a "fire and forget" missile
just  like your AIM-120 AMRAAM.  All other Russian radar-guided weapons are
semi active homers, which means that the firer must continue to "paint" you
with radar, because the missile homes on the reflected radar energy

You avoid radar-homing AAMs just like SAMs (see "Evading Radar Guided SAMs"
page  80).   That  is,  use reduced EMV, ECM jamming, and ultimately chaff.
Decoys  can  be  very  effective.   Note  that  the MiG-25 and MiG-31 carry
extremely  long  ranged  radar  AAMs.   Low  EMV, ECM and decoy tactics are
especially effective against these weapons.

IR-Homing  AAMs:   All  IR  homing  AAMs are self guided, "fire and forget"
weapons  Of  these  the  AA-8  is  the most dangerous because of its second
generation  IR seeker and great maneuverability.  If enemy MiGs and Sukhois
close to AA-8 range (8 km) you're often in big trouble.

Techniques to evade IR AAMs are the same as those used against IR SAMs (see
"Evading  IR  Guided  SAMs"  page  82).  That is, use the IR jammer at long
range, flares at short range; decoys also work.

In  practice,  many  IR homers are fired at short ranges during a dogfight.
This  means  you've  got  to  leap onto the IR jammer when you get a launch
warning, then dodge out of the missile`s 45∞ field of view immediately.  At
dogfighting  ranges missile flight times are very short you don't have time
to  fool  around!   If  this  fails,  or  you  delay  too long, the Missile
Proximity  Klaxon will go off.  Now you've got bare seconds to react:  dump
a flare immediately and dodge.

The  older  AA-2.  AA-6.  and AA-7 use first generation seekers.  The enemy
must  get  on  your  tail before these missiles lock on.  Keep him off your
tail and you avoid this entire class of weaponry.

Dogfighting Maneuvers

The  essential  rule  in dogfighting is to get on the enemy's tail.  On all
fighter  aircraft  guns and missile guidance systems only face forward.  If
you're  on  the enemies tail you can shoot and he cannot.  If you can't get
on  his  tail,  at  least try to place his aircraft ahead of you as much as
possible.    So  you  have  the  maximum  number  of  firing  opportunities
Maintaining  higher  speed  or altitude is valuable in a dogfight.  A plane
slower  and  lower  can  only  dodge attacks.  A plane faster or higher can
attack  or retreat as desired.  Having a higher speed or altitude is termed
the "energy advantage".

If  the  enemy  is  behind you, there are various classic escape maneuvers:
Turning  Inside,  the Scissors, the Immelmann, the Split-S.  and the Yo Yo.
Not only should you master them, but also learn to recognize them.

Turning  inside:   The simplest solution to an enemy plane coming up behind
you is turn toward him.  If you're turning faster than he, you'll gradually
circle  around  and  get  on  his  tail.   This  kind  of a "turn match" is
frequently seen when greenhorns dogfight Of course, if the enemy is turning
faster  than  you,  he  will  eventually  come  around behind you.  If this
happens  try  something else immediately.  The longer you wait the worse it
gets, until he lines up a shot and toasts you.

Scissors:  A more complex way to out turn an enemy aircraft is the scissors
maneuver.   Begin  a  turn toward him, but once he begins to turn with you,
quickly roll over to turn in the other direction.  This opens the scissors.
As  the  enemy  realizes you've turned away and turns toward you again, you
reverse  the  procedure and roll back toward him again.  If your turns were
quicker  and  tighter  than  his,  and  / or you're a slower plane, he will
eventually pass in front of you.  This allows you to get onto his tail.

Novice  pilots  trying  to  turn with you can be lured into a scissors with
ease.   Even  if  their  planes  turn  better, their slow reactions to each
scissor  opening  and  closing  will  quickly  give  you  the  edge.   More
experienced  enemies  may  avoid this tactic by anticipating your next turn
and blasting you (if they`re less maneuver- able),or by pulling up and over
in a Yo-Yo (if they're faster).

Immelmann  Turn:   This  maneuver  is an excellent way to reverse direction
quickly.  First you perform a half loop up wards to reverse direction, then
a half roll to right your aircraft.  If an enemy aircraft is behind you, an
Immelmann  can  bring  you  nose  to-nose with him.  Note that an Immelmann
gives  you  to  an  altitude gain but costs speed, since a half-loop upward
slows you down significantly.

Split-S  turn:   This maneuver complements the Immelmann.  Begin by rolling
inverted,  then  pull  the  stick  back to half loop downward.  Many pilots
begin  the  loop  before  the  roll  is completed, roll ing the plane while
looping.   The  Split-S  causes  you  to lose considerable altitude so it's
often  wise to reduce throttle and/or use speed brakes to minimize altitude
loss.

The  Split-S  complements  the  Immel  mann because you gain speed and lose
altitude.   Unwary  fighter  pilots have sometimes tried to Split-S into or
away  from the enemy without remembering their altitude.  The result can be
a Split-S right into the ground!

Yo-Yo  turn:   This  maneuver  is  used mainly by higher speed jets against
slower opponents.  Therefore the relatively slow F-117A has little occasion
to  use  it.   However,  you may see enemy MiGs at tempting it against you!
This turn also re quires excellent cockpit visibility, something the F-117A
definitely lacks.

In  a Yo Yo turn you climb and roll toward the enemy until he`s visible out
the  top  of  your canopy.  Then pull over into a dive while still turning.
During  the  dive you roll the plane to help line up your shot.  Very often
you'll take that shot while inverted

Because  a  Yo Yo requires good spatial perception, first practise it using
the  Slot View (if alone) or Tacti View.  In combat conditions switching to
a  wide  angle view is extremely helpful in pulling the HUD around onto the
enemy after you come over the top.  Then you can switch back to normal view
again.

In effect a Yo Yo is a very big turn in three dimensions.  Most of the turn
radius  is "consumed" with the climbing and diving, allowing a faster plane
to  travel  farther  and  turn wider, yet still come out on the tail of the
more  maneuverable  plane.  American F- 4 Phantom pilots used this maneuver
with  great success against slower but more maneuverable MiG 21s over North
Vietnam during the Vietnam war.

Note  that  the best defense against a Yo-Yo is to reverse your turn or use
the third dimension yourself (usually by going into a split-S).

Enemy Guns

The  enemy  has cannon equivalent to yours in range and power.  However the
enemy  still uses old "predicting" gunsights.  This means they are required
to get behind you before they can make a decent shot.  In addition, all but
the  most  elite  pilots  will  be  slow to fire, since they must place the
gunsight on the target and keep it there to score a hit.

If  you  sense  the enemy is behind you and ready to fire cannons "jinking"
(small violent moves in random directions) can throw off his aim.

MISSION BRIEFING

Mission Types

Rules  of  Engagement (ROE) set forth guidelines restricting what targets a
pilot can and cannot attack and to what extent you may expose your fighter.
In Cold and Limited War situations it is imperative that the enemy not know
exactly  who  or what performed the attack.  This allows the politicians to
say whatever they want

In  Cold  War  situations  the State Department must have "deniability" for
every  mission.   If  the  mission  is successful and the political climate
good,  the  US  may  claim  credit  for the deed.  In other cases, however,
America may not wish to attach its name to the action

You  may  attack  and  destroy specified targets only.  Engagement of other
targets  is  prohibited  unless  if  they  fire first, or have spotted your
plane.   You must avoid visual detection by the enemy.  Enemy air or ground
forces  that  do  detect  you  should be destroyed, to prevent embarrassing
disclosures.  Neutrals are considered friendly at all times, and you should
avoid detection by them at all costs.

You are warned when enemy radar returns are good enough to spot your craft,
or  when  enemy aircraft come close enough to visually identify you.  These
enemies  should  be destroyed, although the effort can be counterproductive
if the attack generates lots of additional sightings!

The  State  Department  may  require deniability, since American aid to the
combatants  may  need  to  be  secret.   However, since there is a war, and
military  targets  are being destroyed, you will be rewarded for destroying
enemy military targets.

Conventional War

You  may  attack  and  destroy  specified targets only.  Other targets with
active  weaponry  (i.e..   which  could attack your craft) may be attacked.
You  may  attack  these military targets even if they haven't seen you yet.
You  must  never  attack  non-military  targets  unless required by orders.
Neutrals  are  considered  friendly  at  all  times,  and  you should avoid
detection by them.

In  a Conventional War you are allowed unrestricted conventional attacks on
enemy  territory.   This  includes  civilian  targets  formerly  forbidden.
However,  targets  that  represent  an  immediate  military threat are most
important.   Therefore  destroying  enemy aircraft, airbases, SAMs, radars,
depots, HQs, etc, gives more reward than bridges, oil refineries, oil wells
and platforms, etc.  Even conventional wars are fought for short term goals
(such  as  the  Grenada invasion in 1983, the Falklands Islands campaign of
1984, and Desert Storm of 1991).

You  must  attack  and  destroy  all  targets specifically required by your
orders.   In  addition,  any  other  targets  in  enemy  territory  may  be
destroyed,  including  civilian  targets.   If  able  to  select additional
targets,  select  those with immediate military capability first.  Neutrals
are  considered  friendly  at  all times, and you should avoid detection by
them.

Air-To-Air Missions

Here  an  important  personage  is travelling by planes your job is to make
sure  he  doesn't  arrive!  The plane takes off about the same time as your
own.   Remember  that his plane, your objective, is the flashing dot on the
satellite map (left MFD)

Although  it`s  possible  to  just  fly to his destination and wait, roving
fighter  patrols  or  local  air  defenses  will  eventually  spot you.  In
general,  the  wiser  approach  is  to find the best way to "sneak through"
enemy patrols and SAM radars to intercept him en-route

In Limited or Conventional War you can take down his plane and escourt with
AMRAAMs.   In  a  Cold  War  situation  you'll  need  to  close for a clean
Sidewinder  or gun shot.  Remember, though, that if the fighter escorts get
a visual ID on your plane you must "zap" them too.  If your attack location
is  well  away  from any ground radars or Mainstay AEW & C planes.  You can
attack from above, hit your man, drop a decoy to confuse them and zoom away
with maximum speed at low altitude (say 200').

Intercepting Terrorists or Commandos

In  this mission you know a transport plane.  accompanied by fighters, will
head  for  friendly  territory.  Your objective is to eliminate them before
they arrive.  The problem is you don't know their destination

As  you take off, watch the enemy aircraft carefully.  Circle around a bit,
observing  their course until you can guess their objective.  Once you know
their goal, it`s easy pick a nice quiet spot to ambush them.  Often you can
stay in friendly territory all the way!

Eliminating a Fighter Patrol

Enemy fighter groups usually patrol near their own air defense systems, and
are  supported  by  Mainstay AEW&C planes, so going in after them can cause
quite  a  battle One trick to avoid this mess is to publicize your presence
in  a  nearby  area  with  little  or  no  SAM coverage, and with no nearby
airbases.   If you can lure the fighter patrol to this spot, the battle may
be much easier.

Once  you've "dangled the lure," take a low profile.  so you can ambush the
enemy fighters as they arrive.  As in many other aspects of modern warfare,
getting the first shot is a big advantage.

Destroying a Recon Bomber

In  most  cases  you  must chase an enemy plane on its way home.  Catch and
attack  him  as  quickly  as possible.  The longer you delay, the closer he
gets to SAM cover and fighter aid.  This is one mission where climbing to a
higher  altitude  can  be  rewarding  you travel faster and farther at high
altitude.

Attacking a Cruise Missile Bomber

These  aircraft  cruise  deep  behind  their own lines, guarded by SAMs and
closely  escorted  by fighters.  Given the defenses, attacking these planes
is  like  hitting  a  ground  target.   You need to sneak or punch your way
through  defenses,  elude counterattacks and blast the primary, just like a
strike mission.

Taking Down The Mainstay

The  IL-76  "Mainstay"  AEW&C  plane is the most difficult aircraft target.
Sooner  or  later  its  radar  will  see  you, forcing you to fight through
fighters and SAMs to reach it.  Make your approach as stealthy as possible.
Destroying  one or two crucial SAM radar sites on your way in can be useful
it opens a radar free corridor to the target, and at the same time may draw
off enemy interceptors, perhaps even some of the Mainstays fighter escort

Strike Missions

Dropping  off  or picking up items deep behind enemy territory seems rather
straightforward.  After all, you don't have to fly into SAM batteries or go
head to head with fighter patrols.

Secret Airstrips

Instead, a secret airstrip challenges your flying skill.  You must manage a
landing  without  an  ILS  to guide you.  Worse, the strip is only half the
length of a normal runway You must land gently at low speed (under 160 kts,
preferably),and  touch  down near the start.  Otherwise you`ll roll off the
other  end  and  crash!  To make matters worse, the strip's lights are only
for  a  limited  time.   Make  a  note  of the time the lights go off, then
periodically  check  the  Waypoints screen on the right MFD to see how much
time you`ve got.  Once the lights are out landing is virtually impossible.

Airdrops

In  these  missions  your  job is to avoid action and just fly over a radio
beacon that`s quite clear on your HUD.  The only real worry is reaching the
beacon  before  it  is  turned  off.   Make note of the "turn off" time and
periodically check the Waypoints screen.  Once the beacon turns off there`s
no way to find the drop site

Photo Recon Runs

Photo  runs over enemy troop concentrations and/or near SAMs are especially
nerve-wracking.   You may need to take out a SAM before making the run.  If
shoulder  fired  SAMs  infest  the  area, your only hope is to dump a decoy
before  you  start,  run  your  IR  jammer  as  long  as  you  can,  and/or
periodically dump flares.

Striking SAMs

Destroying  a  SAM battery requires that you "sneak up" on it , as best you
can, then nail the radar first with a Maverick or HARM.  With the radar out
of  action,  the missiles are helpless.  Unless there are other SAMs nearby
you can have a strafing "picnic" until a fighter patrol shows up.

Remember  that  the safest place around a SAM battery is directly above it.
The  radar cannot look straight up, and the longer-ranged missiles (such as
the SA-2, -5, -10 and 12) have a minimum range of 4 to 5 km.

Hitting the Sub Pens at Severomorsk

The  Severomorsk  submarine pens in the North Cape are a unique and special
target.   These  must  be  attacked by toss bombing from the north you must
place  an  FAE  through  the  sea doors.  This means flying straight at the
mountain and pulling up at the last second.

Beware of the Krivak class frigates patrolling to seaward of this base

Sinking Ships

Don't underestimate enemy warships, especially those of the Soviet Northern
Fleet.   The  larger  ships have exceptionally good radar and very powerful
SAMs.   Patrol  ships  can be knocked out with a single missile, but a task
force  has  so  many  ships that any close approach means you'll be dodging
missiles left and right.

When  fighting  a  Conventional  War with Libya, or in the Persian Gulf, be
careful  about  attacking  merchant ships.  Avoid those on the high seas or
near  friendly  coast  lines:   only  attack  ships cfose to enemy ports or
shore.  Otherwise you could end up hitting a neutral ship by accident.

AREAS OF CONFLICT

The Persian Gulf:  1984

Since  the  overthrow  of  the  pro US Shah in 1979, Iran has been ruled by
Shi`ite  radicals.   In  September,  1980,  Iraq attacked Iran, beginning a
costly  war.   Both combat ants are viewed with distrust by the Arah states
along  the Persian Gulf.  Irans use of international terrorism as a tool of
foreign policy has not improved the nations image

Level of Conflict

Cold  War:   Iran's  use  of  terrorism  has  been  very effective to date.
Americas confused response to the hostage crisis in the early 1980s created
a dangerous rift between the two nations.

Limited  War:   Iran  and Iraq have been fighting a limited war since 1980.
US  forces may eventually become involved in assuring the continued flow of
oil through the Straits of Hormuz.

Conventional  War:   The  Soviets could invade Iran as part of a wider NATO
Warsaw  Pact  conflict,  or as a counter to the Shi'ite radicals, who would
like to spread their revolution to the USSR's Moslem population.

Iranian Military Forces

Under  the  Shah,  Iran's  oil  rich  finances were invested in US military
equipment  Since  the  revolution many of these complex weapons have failed
for  lack  of spare parts and maintenance, while many of the rest have been
damaged or destroyed in the Iraq war

Air  Defenses:   MIM  23B  "Hawk"  batteries are Iran's longest ranged SAMs
Rapier  batteries.   Sold by Britain to Iran, are fast, but shorter ranged,
and  hindered  by  a  fire  control  system  that is primarily visual.  The
Tigercat,  an  antiquated  British  design appears in less important areas.
Many  Tigercat sites have little or no radar, since the missile is designed
for visual control.  The Seacat is a naval version of the Tigercat found on
Iranian Vosper Mark 5 type frigates.

Air  Force:   This  service  arm is composed primarily of US built aircraft
acquired  during the Shah's rule.  Before the outbreak of the Iran Iraq war
the Air Force had a nominal strength of 75 F-14 Tomcats, about 200 F-4D and
F-4E  Phantom  IIs,  and 140 F-5E Tiger IIs.  Iranian fighters are equipped
with AIM 9H Sidewinders, one of the best first generation IR AAMs.  The F 4
Phantoms  are  designed to carry the AIM-7F Sparrow long-range radar homing
missile.

Iran  has  few  naval  reconnaissance  bombers,  and most of those are P-3C
Orions  with inoperative electronic gear.  However, it's possible that long
range  Soviet  Tu-95  "Bear"  bombers  may  make an appearance, flying from
Afghanistan or Yemen.  

Iran has a variety of small, medium and large air transports, including the
American C-130 Hercules and Boeing 707 and 747 transports.  The exact types
available  vary  greatly,  depending  on  the supply of spare parts and the
presence  of  knowledge  able  mechanics  Given Iran's dislike of the West.
Some  consider  it  likely  that  she  will  shop  in  Russia  for the next
transports bought.  Perhaps the new and very flexible An-72 "Coaler".

Naval  Forces:  The Iranian Navy has suffered greatly in the Iran-Iraq war,
since  most  resources  go  into  the  army and air force.  Many ships were
damaged  in the fighting and remain in disrepair:  others have deteriorated
badly for lack of maintainence

It  is  believed  that  one  or more of the four Vosper Mark 5 frigates are
still functional These 1,100-ton ships include a surface-to surface missile
(SSM),  Seacat  SAMs and a 4.5" gun turret.  Occasional patrols by these or
smaller  ships  can  be  expected  in  the region of Kharg Island or in the
Straits of Hormuz

Iran's  Shi`ite "Guards" also man a large number of fast motor boats called
"Mosqui-  toes."  The  crews  carry  rocket-propelled  grenades  to  attack
shipping  and  shoulder launched IR SAMs to protect themselves from air and
helicopter  attack.   These  boats  are  based all along the Iranian coast,
especially at Bandar 'Abbas, and at a variety of offshore oil platforms.

Iranian Cities and Targets

Upper  Khuzestan  Triangle  - Dezful, Masjed Soleyman, Ahvaz:  These cities
are  the  main  "rear areas" behind the Iraq-Iran battlefront.  They have a
variety  of  SAMs.   Although  all originally had airbase facilities, it is
believed that only Masjed Soleyman`s is still intact.

Abadan:   This  city  is  located  at  the final junction of the Tigris and
Euphrates  Rivers.  Numerous battles in and around this area have destroyed
a  large part of the city The surrounding countryside is now reverting to a
poisonous  marshland in the aftermath of heavy fighting, which included the
use of chemical weapons.

Bandar  Khomenyi:   This  is  the  main  Iranian  military  base behind the
southern  part  of  the Iran Iraq front.  A major staging base for military
supplies  and munitions of all sorts.  It has a large airbase, powerful SAM
batteries, and a major military HQ.

Kharg  lsland:   This  oil  rich island is covered with refineries, storage
tanks,  and  port  facilities.  Until the Iran-Iraq war it was the greatest
oil  terminal  in  the  world.   Repeated  attacks  have ruined many of the
facilities.  Now protected by SAM batteries and missile boats.  It is still
Iran`s  main outlet for oil.  Beware that some offshore plat- forms in this
vicinity are now used by Shi`ite "Guards" as military bases.

Bushehr:   This important coastal city was once a major oil port but is now
completely  overshadowed  by neighboring Kharg Island.  The military forces
on its airbase and SAM batteries are not always first rate.  But it is home
port for frigates and missile boats

Shiraz:   This  inland  city  is  one  of  the  largest Iranian cities:  It
contains  the  nerve center for Iran's southern military command.  There is
an  exceptionally large airbase here, and it is protected by a powerful SAM
battery.

Esfahan:  Nestled in a a large pass of the Zagros Mountains, Esfahan is the
"gateway" to north western Iran.  As a transportation and population centre
it naturally boasts an airfield, and SAM sites protecting it.

Bandar-e  Lengeh:   This  western city on the Straits of Hormuz has a minor
military base, including an airfield and SAM battery.  However, its primary
function is civilian, serving the large oil fields in this area.

Bandar  'Abbas:   This city is Iran's major military base on the Straits of
Hormuz  Major  Iranian  Navy elements are based here, as well as the latest
SAMs and a large, well-equipped airbase.

Friendly Bases

CVN  at Sea:  This huge 80,000 ton nuclear carrier is the class ship of the
latest  and  most powerful program of aircraft carriers.  Normally assigned
to the Pacific Fleet, it is prepared to visit the Indian Ocean at any time.

Ras  as  Saffaniyah:  This is Saudi Arabia's northern most oil terminal and
port  along  the  Gulf.   Its  airfield  is in a useful strategic location.
Basing privileges for a secret stealth mission can be arranged with the pro
American Saudi monarchy

Dhahran  and  Al  Hufuf:   Dhahran  is  Saudi  Arabia`s largest city on the
Persian  Gulf,  making  its  airfield an unwise choice for stealth aircraft
operations.    However,   the  Al  Hufuf  airfield  slightly  inland  is  a
strategically useful and less public position for basing missions

As  Salamiyah:   This small airbase outside of the capital Riyadh is a nice
quiet location where clandestine missions can be organized easily.

Bahrain:   This  small  island  nation  is strongly pro American, providing
large naval and airbase facilities for US military forces.

Neutral Bases

Kuwait  City:   Iranian  threats  and attacks have caused Kuwait to seek US
military  support.   The  Kuwait City airport can be used to stage missions
that  demonstrate  US  support  of  Kuwait, or for emergency landings, but,
fearful  of  increased  Iranian  hostility  Kuwait will not grant US basing
rights.

Qatar:   This  small  independent nation works hard at neutrality, probably
because  it  has  strong  pro US and strong pro Iranian factions.  Although
missions  are`nt  regularly  staged  from  here,  it  is possible to launch
specific clandestine missions or carry out emergency landings

Ruweiss  and  Tarif  in the United Arab Emirates:  These small oil ports of
the  UAE are not especially friendly to the American cause.  But the UAE is
a decentral ized government, and US pressure in the right places can permit
clandestine missions or emergency landings.

Abu  Dhabi  and  Khafi  in the UAE:  Abu Dhabi is the major city of the UAE
where neutrality is most important.  Staging missions or emergency landings
from  here  s  very  difficult,  but not impossible.  The large airfield at
Khafi  is  the  most  strategically  useful  of all UAe airfields it is the
closest base to south-central Iran.  But political problems make the use of
this base difficult to impossible.

Muscat  in  Oman:  Oman is careful to remain neutral in all affairs, but it
is  strongly  pro  Western.   For  example, much of its army is trained and
officered by "retired" British military personnel.  The military portion of
the  Muscat  airfield  is  available  for  missions and emergency landings,
provided everything remains secret and politically "deniable"

Europes North Cape:  1985

The North Cape area is shared by four nations:  Norway, Sweden, Finland and
the  Soviet  Union.  their political orientations parallel their geographic
locations:   Norway  belongs  to  NATO,  Sweden  is  a pro-Western neutral,
Finland is a pro-Eastern neutral and the USSR, of course, leads the eastern
Bloc.

Cold  War:   Because  of  the  threat  to  the Atlantic posed by the Soviet
Northern  Fleet  NATO  and  Soviet forces are constantly sparring with each
other,  testing  the  others  responses  and  jockeying for position should
hostilities  erupt.   Officially  at  peace  the  two  sides  wage a covert
conflict  of  intelligence gathering and military that could turn deadly in
an instant.

Level of Conflict

Limited  War:   If  US-Soviet  foreign  policy  were conducted with greater
hostility the North Cape would be ideal for raids or retaliations.

Conventional  War:  If the balloon goes up, the Soviet Northern Fleet would
make  sorties  into  the  Atlantic:  Soviet troops would cross into Norway;
Mainstays  and  MiGs  would  cloud the skies.  Getting in and out with your
skin intact would be very very tricky!

Regional Military Forces

In  terms  of  global politics, the North Cape is the single most important
military  region in the Soviet Union.  Murmansk is its only year round open
sea  access to the Atlantic Ocean.  Soviet SSBNs (ballistic missile nuclear
submarines),  the  heart  of  nuclear  deterrence,  sail from here into the
Atlantic  and  Arctic  Oceans.   The  Soviet  Northern Fleet protects these
invaluable  weapons,  as  well  as  maintaining a credible threat to NATO`s
Atlantic lifelines

Norway fields a large, well equipped force tailored for a dogged defense of
its  cold  mountainous  homeland.   The  northern  bases  have  only  token
Norwegian  garrisons  but  NATO  plans  to  strongly  reinforce the lightly
defended  northern  areas  with  air,  naval  and  marine forces should the
shooting start.

Sweden's armed forces are designed to make the USSR (or anyone) think twice
about  violating its neutrality.  Swedish forces are well equipped and well
trained,  and  boast a nationwide reserve system that makes a large part of
the citizenry part time soldiers.

Finland  fields  a  much  smaller  and  less  sophisticated  force than its
neighbors Although fiercely independent, Finland has learned to accommodate
the  desires  of  its  powerful  neighbor,  the  Soviet Union.  The Soviets
maintain  this  "friendly" attitude by garrisoning powerful military forces
near  the  Finnish  border,  and  strongly encoraging Finland to buy Soviet
military equipment.

Soviet Air Defenses

The Kola peninsula is vital to the USSR because it provides access to NATOs
lines  of  communications.  However, its close proximity to Russia makes it
particularly  vulnerable  to  NATO  counterstrokes.  Consequently, the Kola
peninsula  is  likely  to  prove  one of the most challenging anti aircraft
environments in the world

Long-rangeSAMs:   the  older SA-2s and SA-5s have been undergoing continual
upgrade  to  SA-10 and SA-12 quality.  The entire system is enhanced by the
LPAR early warning radar system at Kirovsk.

Light SAMs:  Soviet ground forces in this area are outfitted with the usual
battlefield  SAMs, including the older SA-9 and SA- 13 IR missiles, as well
as  the  newer  SA-8 and SA-11 radar guided ones.  Mobile infantry carrying
SA-7  and SA-14 shoulder launched IR SAMs are a significant threat as well.
Check out your Intelligence Briefing for "enemy troops."

The PVO and Naval Aviation

Fighters:   This  region  is  defended partly by PVO (National Air Defense)
units  with  MiG-25  and  MiG-31 interceptors using long-range radar homing
AAMs.   Naval  aviation  fighters  operating  from  carriers or land strips
include  the  Yak  38  V/STOL  jet and the new Su-27 multi purpose fighter.
During  wartime  shorter-ranged units may arrive including MiG 29 and Su-27
dogfighters  with  short-range  IR  missiles  as  well  as long range radar
weapons.

Reconnaissance  Bombers:   Many long range Tu-95D "Bears" are based in this
area.   To  keep  tabs  on  NATO  naval  activity in the North Atlantic.  A
nuisance  in  peacetime,  these  planes  pose  a more serious threat in war
eliminating  them - and thus blinding the Soviet high command - is always a
high priority in NATO war plans.

Transports:   The  Soviet  Union  possesses numerous air transports for its
huge  force  of  airborne  units.   The  most  modern  of  these is the jet
propelled  An-72  "Coaler"  which  is  particularly  suited  to  fast, high
priority  missions  like  inserting commando teams or transporting critical
command personnel.

AEW&C  Aircraft:  The Soviets routinely deploy IL-76 "Mainstay" aircraft in
the  region.   The  300+  mile  radars  on  these  planes  may be your most
formidable enemy.

The Soviet Red Banner Northern Fleet

The  USSR's  Northern  Fleet offers both tempting targets and a significant
threat.   Its  modern  Sovremennyy-class  destroyers carry SA-N-7 missiles.
While  Krivak  class  fig  ates  sport  the  SA N 4.  the larger Kiev class
carrier  has  the  powerful  SA-N-6,  a  sea going equivalent of the SA-10.
These  warships  are  more than capable of defending themselves.  Stationed
off the northern coast, they significantly extend the Soviet anti- aircraft
umbrella.

In addition to these ships' SAMs, Kiev-class carriers mount a complement of
Yak-38 "jump jet" fighters.  While less capable than ground based fighters,
the British Harriers in the Falklands taught the world not to underestimate
the capabilities of such planes.

An  upcoming  addition  to  the  Northern Fleet is a class of huge aircraft
carriers  fitting out in the Crimea.  Tentatively titled the Kremlin-class,
these ships are expected to join the fleet soon

Soviet Cities and Targets

Murmansk:   This  major  city is the Soviet Union`s only ice free port with
access  to the Atlantic Ocean.  Its great piers and depots support not only
a  steady stream of merchant shipping, but the powerful Red Banner Northern
Fleet.  Murmansk is literally 'at the end of the line." In this case a long
railway line that runs southward 700 miles to Leningrad.

Murmansk  is  the nerve center of the USSR's powerful air forces, including
both  air  defense  planes  and  naval  aviation  of  the  Northern  Fleet.
Satellite airfields surround the city, including large bases at Kildenstroy
and Kilpyaur.  The great Severomorsk submarine pens are also near Murmansk.
This  underground base is the home port for the new Typhoon class ballistic
missile submarine.

The  Northern Fleet includes, roughly, one aircraft carrier, 75 other major
surface  warships,  one  marine  brigade,  133  submarines,  and  446 naval
aircraft.   The  protection of its bases is the duty of 12 divisions of the
Red  Army (about 300,000 men) and 150 planes of Frontal Aviation (air force
planes  supporting  the  army) and the PVO (air force interceptors guarding
the border).

Pechenga:   This  town  is the USSR's forward most military base in the far
north  and  the  inevitable  staging  point  for  any  invasion  into  NATO
territory.   Although  it  has  an  airbase  and  strong SAM defenses.  The
Polyarnyy airbase complex to the east is somewhat larger

Monchegorsk and Olenegorsk:  Near the base of the Kola peninsula, these two
towns  are major airbases for long-range naval aviation bombers, as well as
providing  fighter  and SAM cover to the railroad link between Murmansk and
the south.

Kandalaksha:   This  small  port  city is the main population centre at the
base  of the Kola peninsula.  South of the city lies the Loukhi air defense
complex,  including  a  large  SAM  battery that covers this section of the
Murmansk-Leningrad rail line

Arkhangel'sk:   Although closed by ice during the winter, Arkhangel`sk (the
USSR's   largest   city  on  the  Atlantic)  has  excellent  transportation
connections  to  the interior of Russia, and is almost totally invulnerable
to  enemy  attack.   In  addition  to  large  port  facilities, the city is
surrounded  by  military  defenses, the most notable being the complexes at
Severodvinsk  and Kushkushara, and units of the Northern Fleet which patrol
offshore in the White Sea.

Friendly Bases

Kautokeino:   Located  in  the  barren  tundra  of  the  Finnmarksvidda the
Kautokeino airfield is well suited for operations across the top of Finland
to  Murmansk.   The  population  is  very  small  and  the entire area well
defended  by  tundra  swamps  and  bogs in summer, or sub zero blizzards in
winter.

Lakselv:   Located  at  the  base  of  the  Porsangen Fjord, Lakselv has an
airfield  ideally  suited to operations into Russia.  It is far enough from
the  border to survive the first few days of fighting, but close enough for
easy access.

CV  Kennedy  at  Sea:   Just  recently,  the Navy Secretary announced a new
wartime policy of sending aircraft carriers deep into the Norwegian Sea, to
challenge  the  USSRs fleet near its home.  Although considered suicidal by
some, this policy is certainly useful for launching stealth missions.  Here
CV67,  one of the conventional carriers with the US Atlantic Fleet, makes a
quick dash to the North Cape to launch your mission

Neutral Bases

Available neutral bases in this region are all Swedish.  Sweden is strictly
neutral  in  international  politics,  but economically closely tied to the
Western  Bloc.   Given  recent events and aggressive Soviet moves, it's not
unlikely  that  a  few clandestine stealth missions, or emergency landings,
would be allowed at northern Swedish airbases

Kiruna:   the  northernmost airfield in Sweden, this base is located in the
nearly unpopulated foothills of the Esrange Mountains.

Gallivare:   Although  this airfield is also far north in Sweden, Gallivare
is  a  junction  of  rails and roads.  In the summer months it is a popular
tourist  area,  with  the  Muddus  National  Park  a few miles to the west.
Stealth missions operating from this base must be very discreet.

Lulea:   This fairly populous city is the main Swedish military base in the
Northern  Region.   It  is also a port on the Culf of Bothnia, the northern
most arm of the Baltic Sea.

Libya: 1986

Libya  is  ruled  by  Col.  Mu'ammar al-Qadhaffi, leader of the secret army
organiza  tion  that  deposed the former king in 1969.  The capital city is
Tripoli  and  the  nations  chief  source  of wealth is oil sold to western
nations

Level of Conflict

Cold  War:   At  times  Libya  has  enthusiastically  backed  international
terrorism  The  US  has  already  attacked  tactical  military  targets  in
retaliation   for  Libyas  role  in  numerous  incidents  of  international
terrorism in Europe and the Mediterranean

Limited War:  The Libyan army has fought minor border clashes against Egypt
a  US  ally,  that so far has proved considerably superior.  Future limited
wars between Libya and any of her neighbors are possible.

Conventional  War:   In  the  event  of  NATO-Warsaw Pact conflict Libya is
expected to provide bases for Soviet aircraft and warships operating in the
Mediterranean.   These  bases  could  become  the  western most outposts of
Soviet forces in the Mediterranean

Libyan Military Forces

The  Libyan  Army  has approximately 60,000 men.  The Navy has 53 ships and
6,500  men, while the Air Force has about 530 planes, 30 combat helicopters
and  8,500  men.   A paramilitary "Pan-African Legion" of about 10,000 also
exists.   In  addition  Libya has built and supported a variety of training
camps for terrorist groups.

Libya  buys  most  of its armaments from the Soviet Union with money earned
from  selling  its vast oil reserves to the West.  Personnel are trained by
Soviet Military advisors, but national pride has prohibited any significant
Soviet presence

Air  Defenses:   Libyan  air  defenses  use  Soviet  built equipment.  SA-2
"Guideline"  and  SA-5  "Gammon"  SAMs have been the backbone of Libyan air
defenses,  but  are being replaced by SA-10 "Grumble" and SA-12 "Gladiator"
systems.

Local  ground forces use the SA-7 and SA-14 shoulder fired missiles.  These
are  also popular terrorist weapons, and can be expected in the vicinity of
terrorist  camps.   Libyan  army  units also use various medium-range SAMs,
including the SA-8, -9, -11 and -13.

Air  Forces:  The Libyan Air Force is composed of 140 MiG-23MF "Floggers" a
small  number  of  MiG  25 "Foxbats" and old MiG-21s, and various Mirage 5D
fighter  bombers.  Your primary opponents will be MiG 23s and 25s, although
in  Conventional  War,  or against higher quality pilots, you may encounter
MiG-29 "Fulcrums" flown by Soviet pilots.

Libya's  antiquated  C-130H  and C-47 air transports (built in the US) will
probably be replaced by the new Soviet An-72 "Coaler" jet transport.

Naval  Forces:   The Libyan Navy is primarily composed of missile corvettes
and  patrol  boats.   The  largest  of  these are the 770 ton Russian built
Nanuchka  II  class  armed  with  Styx  surface-to  surface missiles, SA-N4
surface  to-air  missiles,  and  a  twin  57mm gun turret.  The other boats
include  the  Soviet  Osa-class,  Italian  built  Wadi M`ragh class and the
French  built La Combattante II types:  these have poorer missiles and SA N
5 SAMs, or no SAMs at all.

Libyan Cities and Targets

Tripoli:   the  capital city of Libya has a large military civilian airbase
at  Idris,  and  is  well protected by SAM batteries.  Until recently these
were  long  range  SA-5  "Gammons,"  but  there are indications that Soviet
military  advisors  have  replaced  them with SA-12 Gladiators.  Tripoli is
also  the  site  of  a  major army HQ, various military depots, oil storage
areas,  and  terrorist  training camps.  Missile boats often cruise off the
coast.

Sabha:   This  southern  town  is  the main military base supporting Libyas
southerly border expansion.  The most important military installations here
are the large airbase and the SAM battery protecting it.

Misratah  and  Sirt:  These two coastal towns harbor low level military HQs
and oil storage tanks for refueling ships.  Sirt is a secondary naval base,
supporting  missile  boats  that  cruise  the  western side of the "Line of
Death."

Ras  Lanuf  and  Port  Brega:   Ras Lanuf is Libya's largest and newest oil
facility  Port  Brega is an older facility.  still in operation despite the
completion  of Ras Lanuf.  A number of SAM batteries support the Port Brega
airfield, west of the town

Benghazi:  This is the site of Libya's second largest military base and the
Benina airfield.  It boasts a military HQ and small oil storage facilities.
Terrorists train in the western hills.

Al  Badya:   This sleepy coastal town in the mountainous Jabal al Akbar has
major  military  significance.   It overlooks the narrow lonian Sea between
Libya  and Greece making it an ideal site for anti ship missiles.  There is
a small airstrip and SAM site as well

Oil  Fields:   The  great  oil  fields  of Libya are in the southeast where
thousands  of  wells  pump  crude to Ras Lanuf and Port Brega.  Most of the
great  fields  have  a  few  storage  tanks  on  site,  to  hold  crude oil
temporarily.

Friendly Bases

Sigonella  on  Sicily:   The  US maintains a military base at Trapani.  The
Sigonella  military  field in southeastern Sicily is the main staging point
for air attacks against the North African coast

Neutral Bases

CV  America  at  Sea:   this  60,000-ton  "Kitty  Hawk"  class conventional
aircraft  carrier, designated CV66, often serves with the US Sixth Fleet in
the Med.  A participant in recent raids against Tripoli and Benghazi, it is
ideally  positioned  for  strikes  against  Benghazi, the Gulf of Sirte, or
targets deep in the Libyan desert.

These  airbases  are  in neutral territory.  You should not use these bases
unless specifically so ordered, or if you must make an emergency landing.

Suda  Bay  on  Crete:   This airfield, near the city of Khania, is not a US
base although it has been a major NATO air and naval base.

Halfar  on Malta:  On the island of Malta, and once a critical position for
the  British Commonwealth in the Mediterranean.  This base is now a neutral
port and sometime tourist haven.

Central Europe:  1986

Since  World War II Europe has been divided into two hostile blocs.  On one
side are the communist East European nations, created in the wake of Soviet
armies  at  the  end of WWII.  On the other side are the democratic Western
European  nations.   Since  1949 the West has been linked by NATO:  In 1955
the East formalized an equivalent organization the Warsaw Pact dominated by
the USSR.  From then to now the two geatest military organizations on earth
have eyed each other along the East-West German border.

Levels of Conflict

Cold  War:   This  is  the  situation  of the last 40 years.  The two sides
maintain  a  wary  posture,  generally  trying to avoid overt provocations.
Probing  each  other  to  gain  information,  stir  discontent in the enemy
population,  and  gain psychological advan tages.  The F-117A, designed for
clandestine  penetration, is the perfect aircraft for the secret operations
common in this situation.

Limited  War:  Now the conflict is at the brink of open warfare, but armies
have not yet crossed borders.  As hostilities escalate, the opportunity for
stealth  missions  increases Conventional War:  Warsaw Pact tanks pour over
the  West  German  border  While NATO forces scramble to stem the onrushing
tide.   On  one hand lies the specter of conventional defeat.  On the other
the  disaster  of  thermonuclear  war.   Stealth aircraft airmobile raiding
groups,  and  long-range "smart" munitions make the dangerous crossing over
the  front  to  hammer  Soviet rear echelons.  If they can isolate the Pact
spearheads from their base, they may give the politicians an OPportunity to
avert disaster

Military Forces

The  Warsaw Pact can deploy almost three million men, about 80,000 armoured
fighting  vehicles, and 6,000 combat aircraft.  Against this juggernaut the
Western  powers  can  field  around two million men, 40,000 AFVs, and 4,000
combat aircraft.  The numerical imbalance is partially offset by the higher
quality  of  the  Western  troops  and equipment, presumably along with the
traditional advantages of the defense

Together,  the  two  sides  have  almost  ten  thousand battlefield nuclear
weapons in Europe.  These range from small.  sub kiloton shells designed to
wipe out troop concent trations, to multi megaton city busters.  Artillery,
planes.   and  missiles  of all types and ranges can deliver these weapons.
At  one  time  NATO  felt  it  had to use nuclear weapons to compensate for
numerical inferiority.  Today it has an alternative plan; "Air-land battle,
2000." In this NATO uses superior technology, including its stealth planes,
to  attack  deep  in  the rear of the Warsaw Pact armies.  Destroying their
logistical  support  If  this  innovative strategy works, NATO need not use
nuclear weapons to stem the Red tide.  However, failure would mean a choice
between nuclear holocaust and the loss of Europe to the Soviet Union.

Air Defenses

Equipment:  Since the "Central Front" forms the focal point of the war, the
anti  aircraft  defenses on both sides are the most intensive in the world.
The  Soviets  are  certain  to deploy large quantities of their most modern
weapons, Sa-10s and Sa-12s for area defense.  In some areas the older, less
effective SA-5 long-range systems may still be in place.

Radar  guided  SA-8s  and  SA1-11s  are  most  commonly used for more local
defenses  especially  near important military concentrations or objectives.
A  few  are  even sited near larger SAM batteries to provide local defense.
The  shorter ranged infrared SA-9s and especially SA-13s may appear instead
if  radar -guided weapons are not available At sea the Baltic missile boats
typically  have either SA N-5 or SA-N-7 systems although Krivaks and larger
ships with SA N 4s can be expected in wartime

Pact Air Forces

The  Soviet  Air  Force  is  the  largest in the world, and one of the most
modern.   It  deploys  a  wide  variety of interceptor, bomber, and support
aircraft.   The  Soviets know the value of air superiority and will give it
high priority.

Fighters:   With 6,000 combat aircraft to choose from.  You can bet the Red
Air  Force  will  find a few to spare for you.  If you're lucky, you`ll see
only  second  line MiG-23s but more likely quality dogfighters like the MiG
29  and Su 27 will be flying.  In rear areas you're more likely to see long
range interceptors like MiG-25s and MiG-31s

Bombers:  One of the most troublesome enemy bombers you`ll encounter is the
Tu-95 "Bear" modified to carry cruise missiles.  A number of these craft in
orbit  deep behind enemy lines gives them an "untouchable" airborne nuclear
force

AEW&C:   The  Soviet  IL-76  "Mainstay" AEW&C was designed for work in this
kind of environment.  Flying "racetrack" orbits deep behind friendly lines,
its  powerful  radars  can  see  NATO  air  operations  develop  and  radio
appropriate  orders  to  various  fighter squadrons.  The effort to develop
these  planes has been long and costly; the size weight, and expense of the
electronic gear is gigantic.  Each plane is precious eliminating them would
cripple Soviet air operations

Transports:   Thousands  of  air  transports will shuttle back and forth on
both  sides of the front line, carrying troops, raiding parties, munitions.
staff  officers,  etc.   The  new  Soviet workhorse that flies anywhere and
carries almost anything is the An-72 "Coaler"

Naval Forces

The  Soviet Baltic fleet, headquartered at Baltiysk outside of Kaliningrad,
controls  4  cruisers,  16  destroyers,  7  Krivak class large frigates, 22
missile boats and other light warships, 21 amphibious assault ships, and 45
submarines.  It also controls the East German and Polish navies, which have
numerous  additional frigates and missile boats.  This force has two goals:
to  cover  the  northern  flank  of the Warsaw Pact from air attack, and to
invade Denmark in the event of war.

Stealth  missions  will  generally deal with the former, your problem being
how  to  penetrate the warship screen in the Baltic.  The SA-N 5 is a first
generation  IR  homer  and  no serious threat.  The SA-N-4 uses older pulse
radar guidance, but the new SA-N- 7 is a more serious problem.  Fortunately
very few Baltic warships carry the powerful long ranged SA N-10.

Pact Cities and Targets

East  Germany:   During  a Limited or Conventional War the main strength of
the Warsaw Pact forces will travel through here, surging into West Germany.
The  greatest  natural  barrier  in East Germany is the Elbe River, running
from  the  Czechoslovakian  mountains northward to Hamburg.  Destroying its
bridges would be cut off from the pact`s forward troops from their bases.

Covering  the  Pact's forward areas are two main air defense complexes, one
in  the north near Wittstock and Wittenburg, another in the south just east
of  Leipzig  and  Magdeburg.   including  the big radars at Mittenwalde and
Grossenhaim

Poland:   In  a  NAtO-Pact conflict Poland is the "rear area" through which
Soviet  troops  and  supplies  would  flow  toward  the  front lines.  Many
important  HQs  and  depots are situated in the central and western part of
the  nation.   The  Wista-Vistula river system divides Poland in half, from
north  to south.  Destroying the road and rail bridges can seriously damage
Pact  operations.   Polish defense complexes include a powerful system west
of  Gdansk  at Stupsk, and south of Lodz at Radom.  In addition Warsaw is a
major  transportation  hub, so active SAM batteries can be expected in that
area during wartime.

Czechoslovakia:   This Pact nation.  separated from Germany by the Ore Moun
tains  and the rugged highlands of the Bohemian Forest, is likely to play a
secondary  role  in  wartime.   Czechoslovakian  defenses are also somewhat
lighter  than  East  Germany  and  Poland.   Tabor  is the most significant
installation.   Far  to  the  east,  guarding  the  entrance to Hungary and
southern Poland, is another defense complex at Konmarno.

Kaliningrad:   This  region  of  the USSR, named after the major seaport of
Kaliningrad  (renamed  from Konigsberg in 1945), is the Soviet "front-line"
on  the  Baltic.  It includes a major over-the horizon (OTH) radar station,
as well as the Klaipeda Airbase.

Friendly Bases

West  Germany,  Holland,  and Denmark are studded with airfields that could
serve  as bases for stealth raids into Eastern Europe.  They form a gentle,
north south cresent bulging west in the middle.  Which is the most suitable
starting point for a particular airstrike depends mainly on the location of
the  target.   However,  the  F-117A  unique  characteristics  will be most
effective  in the areas only thinly covered by radar to the north and south
of  the  main  arena.  Therefore, deep penetration raids will usually start
from  Denmark  or southern Germany.  Shorter tactical strikes, however must
fly directly into the mouth of the tiger.

Jutland  Peninsula  - Vandel and Leck:  These far northern bases make ideal
jump-off points for raids out across the Baltic.  Often it's easier to deal
with  missile  boats  in  the  Baltic than the heavier SAM defenses in East
Germany and Poland

Nothern  Germany  (Hanover)  - Ahlhorn and Gutersloh:  These bases directly
behind  British  Army  Of  The  Rhine  (BAOR)  face  across the flat densly
populated  North  German  plain, the most likely axis of advance should the
Warsar  Pact  attack NATO.  therefore, they represent the most direct route
to one of the greatest concentrations of hostiles in the world.

Central  Germany  (Westphalia)  - Rhein-Main and Ramstein:  These bases are
the great, famous bases of American air power in Europe.  Rhein Main is one
of  the largest military bases in the world, while Ramstein is headquarters
for the 4th Tactical Air Force, America's combat air arm in Europe.

Southern  Germany  (Bavaria) - Neuberg Leipheim and Memmingen:  These bases
are  all  Luftwaffe (air force of the Federal Republic of Germany) but like
many  German  bases,  are  entirely  willing  to  host American aircraft as
needed.   Any of these bases makes an excellent jump off point for missions
into Czechoslovakia

The Middle East: 1989

The  Middle  East  has  been  the  scene  of constant tension and recurring
warfare  since  the United Nations formed the nation of Israel in 1948.  In
the crucible of this conflict, the Israelis have forged a superior army and
air  force  that  has consistantly outmatched its opponents.  The threat to
Israel today comes from Syria and Iraq although Iraq has been significantly
worn down by eight years of warfare with Iran The Jordanians have adopted a
near-neutral policy and are not expected to take an active part in any near
future conflict.  Lebanon has been torn apart by civil war and invasions by
Israel, Syria, and Palestinian refugees

The  Syrians  and  Iraqis  are  supported  financially largely by the Saudi
Arabians  out receive their weapons and training from the USSR.  Jordan and
Saudi Arabia act independently and have relatively strong ties to the West.

Level of Conflict

Cold  War:   For many years, Syria has engaged in the trainig and supplying
of  various  terrorist organizations, including the PLO, which has proved a
never  ending  source  of  annoyance to the Israelis.  In addition, several
Western hostages are rumoured to be held somewhere in Syria.

Iraq  is  in  the  process  of  building the region's most formidable armed
force.  The Iraqi military is working furiously to develop nuclear weapons,
and  already  has  large stores of chemical and biological devices.  Saddam
Hussein,  Iraqs  leader,  ordered the use of these during the war with Iraq
and is rumored to have used them against Kurdish rebels in his own country.

Limited War:  An Iraqi-backed Syrian invasion of Israel is underway and the
Israelis have called upon the US for support.  The Jordanians, as expected,
are  staying  out  of this fight for fear of losing what little armed force
they have to defend themselves against their powerful neighbors

Conventional  War:   In  response to US air intervention in the Middle East
the  USSR  has  sent  air  forces into the region to support its Syrian and
Iraqi  allies.  No superpower can keep its hands off all the oil that comes
from  this  vast desert region.  This war could quickly flare into a global
superpower confrontation

Syrian Forces

Air  Defenses:   The  Syrians use Soviet built equipment and are trained by
Soviet advisers.  They possess over 75 batteries of surface to-air missiles
mostly  SA-2  "Guidelines"  and SA 5 "Gammons".  Ground forces are equipped
with SA-7 and SA-14 shoulder fired missiles, and these can also be expected
in the vicinity of terrorist camps in Lebanon and Syria

Air  Forces:   The  Syrian  Arab  Air  Force is composed of over 450 combat
aircraft  and  50,000  men.   The  majority  of  the  interceptor  aircraft
available  are  MiG-21s and MiG 23s, with one squadron of MiG-25s.  The MiG
25 squadron is reportedly serviced and manned by East Germans and Russians.
Intelligence  expects  that  MiG-21s  and  MiG-  23s  will  be your primary
opponents,  although  you  may  encounter  MiG-25s and possibly new MiG-29s
flown by Soviet personnel.

Syrian Cities and Targets

Damascus:   This  ancient city, the capital of Syria, is situated east of a
gap  in  the coastal mountain ranges and was founded on the east west trade
route.  Damascus is the major military base in Syria and home to a majority
of  the  Syrian  Arab  Air  force.   Sub stantial SAM batteries and a major
airbase are located west and southwest of the city.

Dayr  As  Zawr  Hims  and Palmyre:  These towns support airbases that guard
Syria's  northern  and western border with turkey.  Dayr Az Zawr is located
at  an  ancient crossing point on the Euphrates River.  Palmyre is a desert
oasis town near the centre of Syria.  Hims is northeast of Lebanon, helping
to surround that country.  All of these cities are protected by substantial
air defense facilities.

Halab:   Previously  known  as Aleppo, this city is located in the northern
hills  of  Syria  near  the  turkish border.  Aircraft based here cover the
Tuurkish border and can reach south to Israel or into the Mediterranean

Al  Ladhiqyah:   This  town  north of Lebanon on the Mediterranean coast is
near  the Turkish border and supports the airbase closest to Cyprus.  It is
not a shipping port but is a vacation spot and fishing center.

Iraqi Forces

Air  Defenses:   Iraq  is  just  beginning to invest large resources in air
defense,  but  currently  has  only  10,000  men  assigned  to this branch.
Largely  separated  from  enemies  to the west and north, and just ending a
bloody,  protracted  war with Iran, it has concentrated most of its defense
against  air  attacks  in the east.  SAM batteries deployed are either SA 2
"Guidelines" or SA-5 "Gammons"

Air  Forces:   The  Iraqi  air  force  has  modern  equipment,  but did not
demonstrate a high degree of training or skill during the war against Iran.
The  main  air defense aircraft are MiG 21s and Mirage F 1s, although a few
MiG 25s and MiG-29s are known to be in service.

Iraqi Cities and Targets

Baghdad:   The  capital  city  of  Iraq  is  located between the Tigris and
Euphrates  Rivers.   Although  low  in  strength  due  to war losses, major
elements  of  the  Iraqi  air  force are based here.  Outside the city is a
nuclear  power  plant  that many believe is producing materials for nuclear
weapons

Mosul:   The  second largest city in Iraq also has heavy air defenses and a
nuclear  facility  is  thought to be operating nearby.  Probably because of
this and the close proximity to turkey, Mosul has heavy SAM protection.

Kirkuk,  Habbabiyah,  and  H3:  At these locations the Iraqis have airbases
ringing their country.  Kirkuk faces Iran and H3 is an outpost at a pumping
station in the desert along a major oil pipeline to Syria.

Jordanian Forces

Air  Defenses:   Jordanian  air defense is obsolete, relying primarily upon
the  antiquated MIM 23B, "Hawk" missile system, a good weapon for the 1970s
but not for the late 1980s.

Air  Forces:   Jordanian  air  power, too, is limited to a couple of types.
The  main  type  of  aircraft  is  the  US-built F-5, an inexpensive strike
fighter  that  is  obsolete  by  todays standards.  The other is the French
Mirage F-1, an outdated fighter bomber

Jordanian Cities and Targets

Amman:   Amman  is the capital of Jordan and home for the major elements of
the Royal Jordanian Air Force.

Ma'  An:  Outside this city is the Prince Hassan Airbase, where half of the
air  forces  combat  planes are deployed.  Planes were placed here to reach
the  Sinai  Peninsula but now that the Israelis have made peace with Egypt,
air elements here may be moved further north to cover the West Bank areas.

Friendly Bases

Akrotiri  on  Cyprus:   Aircraft  from  this British airbase are capable of
reaching  targets  along  the  Mediterranean coast.  US or Israeli aircraft
would  not  normally  base  there,  but  would  use  the  facilities  in an
emergency.

CVN  Eisenhower at Sea:  This 80,000 ton Nimitz class nuclear carrier often
serves  with  the US Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean.  Here it cruises off
the  coast of Lebanon, positioned to strike anywhere along the Mediterranen
coast.   Carrying a complement of approximately 85 aircraft, the Eisenhower
is constantly guarded by a combat air patrol of fighter planes.

Ramat  David,  Tel Nof, Lod, and Hatzerim:  These Israeli airbases are home
for  the  fighters and fighter bombers of the air force many consider to be
the  best  in  the  world.   Backed  up  against  the  sea  by  enemies  or
non-friendly  neutrals, the Israelis must be prepared to launch air defense
or  attack  missions  in any of three directions.  A long standing US ally,
Israel's bases would be shared freely with US forces during wartime

Malatya  in  Turkey:  Turkey is a NATO ally and no friend of Iraq or Syria.
This  airbase  is  home  for aircraft assigned to defend Turkey's southeast
border and from here planes can reach the capitals and other targets within
both Iraq and Syria

Tabuk in Saudi Arabia:  This minor airbase serves as a defensive post along
the  Saudi  Arabian  frontier.   In  any  armed  conflict in the region, US
aircraft  would  only  be  allowed  to  land  here  in an emergency, unless
circumstances  clearly  called for Saudi Arabian support of US interests or
vice versa

Desert Storm:  1991

The  western  end of the Persian Gulf protrudes into the center of the map,
and around it lie the region's three most powerful nations:  Iran, north of
the  Gulf;  to  the west Iraqi and Saudi Arabia to the south.  Between them
all,  sitting  astride  the  most valuable oil fields on Earth, is the tiny
Arab sheikdom of Kuwait.

Iran,  the  successor  state  to  ancient  Persia,  is  ruled  by a radical
fundamentalist Shi'ite Moslem regime, a brutal government that has actively
tried to spread revolu tionary fundamentalism to its neighbors.  Iran has a
large  population  and  oil revenues to support a powerful military (though
obtaining  modern military equipment has been difficult since 1979, when it
basically declared war on the world

Iraq  is  a  populous  Arab  country  centered  on  the  fertile Tigris and
Euphrates  river valleys.  It has a Shi'ite Moslem majority but is ruled by
Saddam Husseins Baath Party which is dominated by Sunni Moslems Wealth from
oil revenues has enabled presi dent Saddam to build a well-equipped, modern
military,  outfitted  mainly with Soviet built equipment and trained by Red
Army  advisers.   In  1980, sensing potential weakness to the east.  Saddam
ordered  an  invasion  of  Iran.   For  eight long years, the two countries
fought  a  savage and debilitating war of attrition.  When a cease fire was
finally  signed  in 1988 neither side had gained anything except the deaths
of hundreds of thousands

The  kingdom  of  Saudi  Arabia is a vast, underpopulated desert ruled by a
conser  native  royal  family.   Like its neighbors, Saudi Arabia has spent
much  of  its considerable oil wealth on modern arms, purchased mainly from
the  West.   Like  other  Gulf  states  Saudi  Arabia  fears Iran's Islamic
fundamentalism  will incite rebellion among its own populace.  Accordingly,
Saudi Arabia lent monetary support to Saddams Iraq during the Iran Iraq war

Arrogant, oil rich Kuwait, with the highest per capita income in the world,
is  disliked  by  all  three  Gulf giants.  Kuwait has also spent freely on
armaments,  but  it  is  so  small  that  it cannot really rely on arms for
protection.   Instead,  it  trusts  its  staggering  wealth  to pay for its
troubles.   Despite  its  longstanding  border  disputes  with  Iraq  (over
ownership  of some of the richest oil producing terrain known), Kuwait also
supported Iraq with cash during the Iran Iraq war.

1990  found  Saddam  Hussein  in  a  bind.   He had nothing to show for his
disasterous  eight  year war with Iran except staggering foreign debt.  His
economy  was  depressed  and  his  personal  myth as a great Arab leader in
doubt.

To  Saddam,  it  was  clear that only a major move on the world stage could
recoup  his  losses  and put his regime back on the road to glory.  Kuwait,
virtually  undefended the richest piece of real estate in the world, seemed
like  an  easy mark.  Who would come to the aid of unloved Kuwait?  If Iraq
absorbed  Kuwait  in  a  lightning  invasion, Saddam was confident that the
nations of the world will bluster for a few weeks take note of his powerful
military, then accept it.

It was to be a costly mistake

Within  days  following  the  invasion,  US  air,  ground, and naval forces
gathered  in the area, and prepared to meet what was believed to be Saddams
next  move:   an  invasion of Saudi Arabia.  For several weeks the build up
continued  and  US  forces dug in to the desert in Operation Desert Shield.
Almost  unbelievably,  the  Iraqis  did  nothing  but  wait  for the forces
opposing  them  to  get  stronger.  Soon, US forces were joined by soldiers
from Great Britain, France, Egypt, Syria, and a host of others

While  the  build  up  continued  Allied leaders demanded the "complete and
unconditional   withdrawal   of  Iraqi  forces  from  Kuwait."  Saddam  was
recalcitrant.  Soon the US-led coalition had achieved an irresistible force
of men and equipment, airpower and seapower ..but Saddam refused to move

On  January  16,  1991 US air forces led by F-117A stealth fighters began a
long withering bombardment of Iraqi strategic targets .  .  .

Levels of Conflict

Cold  War:   During  the build up, the F-117A is used to fly reconnaissance
sorties  over  Iraq  and  occupied  Kuwait  to  determine  the strength and
dispositions of Iraqi forces

Limited  War:   During  the  first  few  weeks  of the aerial bombardments,
Coalition  forces  are  very  careful to restrict their sorties to surgical
strikes.   The  tense  political  environment  of  the  Gulf  makes  wanton
destruction unwise.

Conventional  War:   As  the  bombardment  continues the the target list is
expanded  until, when the ground troops finally go in, all military targets
are fair game.

Iraqi Military Forces

Iraq  has  the  world's  fourth  largest standing army, deploying around 50
divisions  with nearly a million troops under arms.  Many of these soldiers
are poorly trained poorly motivated, and poorly led, but at the core of the
Iraqi  army  are  the  eight elite divisions of the Republican Guard, whose
morale is high and whose equipment is first rate.

Air  Defenses:   Iraq  has  invested  heavily  in  surface  to air missiles
especially  SA-2 "Guidelines" SA 6 "Gainfuls" and SA9 "Gaskins" but you may
face  almost any Soviet made SAM in the catalog.  Older SAMs like the SA 2s
have  been considerably improved by Iraq's domestic missile industry, which
has  added  enhancements  like  modern  infrared terminal guidance systems.
Iraq  also  has a vast array of antiaircraft artillery ("triple-A"), but it
lacks  modern  fire  control.   It  offers  little  threat,  and  isnt even
represented in the game.

Air Forces:  The Al Quwwat al Jawwiya al lraquiya, the Iraqi Air force, has
over  500  modern  combat  planes,  including  a  number of very formidable
fighters  and interceptors.  The types you are most likely to encounter are
the MiG-29 "Fulcrum" MiG 23 "Flogger" and the Mirage F-1E The F-1E is built
by   the  French  Dassault  Aviation  company,  and  is  a  multi-role  air
superiority/ground  attack fighter with modern avion ics and the ability to
carry  Exocet  anti-ship missiles.  Normally the F-1 is configured to carry
French  Matra  550  air to air missiles, but the Iraqi planes may have been
altered to enable carriage of Soviet AAMs.

Kuwait Cities and Targets

Kuwait City:  At the head of the Gulf is Kuwait City, capital of Kuwait and
home  to  nearly all the country's population.  Occupying Iraqi troops have
made  the  city  an  armed  camp,  within  which the Baathist secret police
conduct a reign of terror

Sea  Island:   The  pumping station here gushes crude oil directly into the
Gulf, an act of Iraqi environmental terrorism.

Kuwait,Saudi  Border:   Look  closely  and  you'll  see Iraqi armored units
awaiting  the  Coalition  invasion, or orders to attack Saudi Arabia to the
South

Iraqi Cities and Targets

Basra:   Iraq`s  second-largest  city  boasts  an  oil refinery and a major
airbase.  Fixed Scud launching sites are located to the west.

Jalibah  and  Amarah:   These  are major Iraqi airbases.  Capturing Jalibah
west  of Basra, will be a goal of Coalition troops when the ground war gets
underway

Baghdad:   Iraq's  capital  and largest city, Baghdad is also the country`s
military  command  center.   Targets here include the Defense Ministry, the
Presidential Palace a nuclear weapons research plant, an oil refinery and a
major airbase

Samarra and Qaim:  Biological weapons plants are located in these towns

Salman Pak:  This is iraq's most important chemical weapons plant

Habbaniyah and Hadithah:  Iraqi Air Force bases.

Mosul:   Targets  at this important northern city include a nuclear weapons
research facility and an airbase.

Kirkuk:  Another major city, defended by an Iraqi airbase.

Samarra:  This town is the home of another major chemical weapons plant

Irbil:   The research facility here is an important part of Saddams nuclear
weapons project.

Friendly Bases

Tabuk, Ha'il, Buraydah, Shagra:  These desert airstrips have been ex panded
for the use of Coalition planes making strikes into Iraq

Riyadh:   The  capital  of Saudi Arabia, and equipped with a large airbase.
Riyadh is a frequent target of Iraqi Scud missile attacks.

Dhahran  and  Huffuf:   Dhahran is perhaps the largest, most modern airbase
serving the Coalition

CV  Constellation in the Gulf:  Of course, Air Force (Lockheed) F-117As did
not  actually  fly from Navy carriers in the Gulf War, but naval air played
such  an  important part in the air campaign that we thought they shouldn`t
be  overlooked.   (And  besides, the MicroProse F-117A is fully equipped to
launch from carriers.)

Vietnam:  1994

Now  roughly  20  years  since  the end of the Vietnam war.  The Vietnamese
military  is  expanding  its  hold  in  Southeast Asia, seeking to become a
regional  superpower.   Their first move was to officially absorb Laos into
Vietnam,  and  divide it into several provinces under direct Hanoi control.
Secondly.  they pushed back into Cambodia under the pretense of solving the
confusing political situation there, and ousting once and for all Pol Pot's
threat of resurfacing as a tyrannical leader.

In  the  Soviet  Union,  meanwhile,  the  conservatives have had, enough of
reform  and  decadence, and have reasserted their dominance over the course
of  the  nations future They are now fueling regional communist states into
expansion  and inciting revolution just like "the good old days." Now, only
pro-Western  Thailand  remains  to  stand  against Soviet-backed Vietnamese
expansion  in  Southeast  Asia  -  looks like the "domino theory" should be
dusted off again.

Level of Conflict

Cold  War:   As  soon as it is clear that Vietnam has aggressive designs on
her  neighbors,  F-117A  sorties  are initiated over the area for recon and
selective strikes

Limited  War:   With  the  annexation  of Laos and invasion of Cambodia, US
response  intensifies.   Ground  troops  are  sent  into  the  theater  and
aggresive air activity is initiated

Conventional  War:   The Vietnamese invasion of Thailand initiates outright
war  between  US  forces and the Vietnamese army.  The full power of the US
military machine is again in action in Southeast Asia.

Vietnamese Military Forces

AirDefenses:   The  North  Vietnamese  use  Soviet  built equipment and are
trained  by  Soviet  advisors.  The majority of the SAMs deployed are SA 10
"Grumble"  and  SA-11  "Gadfly"  Vietnamese ground forces are also equipped
with  good  Soviet  equipment  they  carry  SA 7B "Grail" shoulder launched
missiles, and some units are equipped with SA 9B "Gaskin."

Air  Force:   The  majority  of  the fighter aircraft in the Vietnamese Air
Force are MiG 21s and MiG 23s some what out dated but still effective.  The
soviets  have  also  sold  a  substantial  number  of  MiG 25s, a few MiG29
"Fulcrum"  and  intelligence  reports  sightings  of the Su 27 as well; the
MiG29s and Su 27s are probably being operated by Soviet personnel.

Navy:  the Vietnamese Navy consists only of a few torpedo boats transferred
to  it  from  the navies of Communist China and the Soviet Union.  From the
Soviets came 190-ton SO 1 class boats and from the Chinese came Shanghai II
class  boats.   Both  these boats are antiquated compared to a modern navy.
but their crews may carry SA 7B "Grails".
