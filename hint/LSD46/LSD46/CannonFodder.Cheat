                           CANNON FODDER CHEAT MODE

We were playing Cannon Fodder, one of the best games to come out since
Syndicate, and the best war simulator yet when we stumbled upon a cheat
mode. Here it is:

You must have a save game disk prepared:

1: At Boot Hill, click on SAVE icon in the upper right corner
2: Click on SAVE, and then OK when you insert your save disk
3: When it prompts you for a filename, enter 'JOOLS'
4: Below the EXIT button, 'CHEAT MODE ACTIVE' will flash

There, now your current troop leader is instantly a 4 Star General. This
makes him run faster and have a more rapid fire rate. There may be other
benefits not discovered. He might be able to take more hits before dying
but I'm not sure so I didn't say so.

                             Enjoy the Game!
