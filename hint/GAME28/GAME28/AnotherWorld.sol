COMPLETION GUIDE!

Ok, you start in the water sitting at your desk, so obviously push up!! Then
run to the right, squishing all the slugs (but not the beatle!) until the
Lion attacks. Then run to the left, until you come to the cliff, where you
jump onto the vine. This will snap and send you flying to the right, where
you run to where you originaly met the Lion. At the edge of this screen 2
aliens will appear, one will kill the lion, the other will pick you up,
and eventually after a disk change, you end up captive with another friend.
You must swing the cage left and right until it falls down on the guard.Your
friend will tap you, and you should pick up the gun and run right. Kill any
guards and make sure you and your friend reach the doors at the same time.
While the other guy starts to fiddle with the door switch you should keep
building sheilds to protect both the friend and the doors, as if one door
blows up the others won't open. Once the guy opens the door, it will close
after him, but you can run through and it will open for you... Now take the
lift up and look at the nice pitcure in the window... Then go to the
bottom stop on the lift, walk left and shoot the switch. This makes the
door in the above lift stop unoperational. Goto the stop above and blow away
the 1st door with a megablast! Then stand over the hole and pull down; RUN
left before the guard breaks out, and when you're under the whole, push up!
Your friend follows you, and after you blow the next door, an alien appears!
Your friend will open the manhole which you should drop down!... In the pipes
... well you can work out the way around the small maze type thing as I've
forgotten it now!!... Anyway you fall out from the hole to the left is a
gun recharge chamber. If you need it go in there... if not, blow away the
doors to the right, and then get the gun changed. Walk to the right until you
meat a guard,and guess what! Kill the bastard!... You should also see your
friend run past followed by lazers and guards. Do a long jump (fire + up)
from the edge of the platform, and ya should either land on a spike, or on
a small platform. If your luck, ya can get cool thrills from that large,
lubricated spike, if not, oh well, ya can always blast the wall to the right
and get into the cave!!...From here keep going down, till you cant go down no
more! Then run right, and jump over the spikes. The next screen to the right
has lots of rocks falling... You can simply keep doing long jumps from the
moment you enter. On the next one however ya should stop, and wait until the
rock nearest you is just starting to fall, then piss bolt to the right, until
you're close to the slimy tenticles!! You can walk up to the right a little,
till youre in light with the tenticles. Then blast em away with a big shot
(ya have to wait for them to lower after youve energized). Then walk right.
Using carefully placed normal jumps you can jump past/over all of the things
in this room. To the right, you should blast away all three tenticles, and
small jump the 1st pit monster, and long jump the remaining two. Now you
come to a pit which must be jumped so you land just before the pit monster.
Jump over him and continue right till you get to the wall. Which you blast.
Now go back left till you get to the rightmost falling rocks room. Go up
from here till you see the small flying thingy. Wait for it to take off,
and then walk to the left. Now wait at the top of the cliff until the bird
is eaten by the tenticles. Once its eaten, you can jump to the 1st
stalactite (or stalagmite?), then to the next and keep movin along until
you've back ontop of the wierd rock formation. Ya now drop to the left of it,
and blast it in the middle. It will topple over, and you can jump along it 
to get above it. Now run right, jumping the 3 pits allong the way till you 
get to the water above the cave. Blast the cave and run like SHIT!! to the 
left, jumping the 3 pits you past, and over where you jumped up, to land on 
the little platform!...The water will push this up, and you can go right to 
get to the door which you should blast it, and go right. Don't go up the 
stairs, but instead keep going right, past the X-waterfall, and into the 
building. If there is a guard, kill him in the usual way. Then shoot the 
longest chandelier from on top of the stairs... This allows your friend to 
escape by losening the roof above. Now go right, killing all guards, until
you find the water pool. Jump into this and go down. You'll realise this is 
the wall you blasted a while back. Go through the wall, and to the left, 
past the pit monster, and then up the passage above and to the left of the 
pit monster. At the top is some air!... Once you have the air, go down, past
the pit monster, and swim right to get out of the water!. Shoot the power 
cabel, and then swin directly out of the water pool. Go left, accros the 
waterfall, and up the stairs. Now go right across the higher waterfall, and 
into the bulding.
You may see your friend sliding past. Go right and dispose of the guard,
jump the steps, and you'll find yourself in a room with a guard behind a
door. 1st stand near the door (but dont open it!) and make a sheild or two!,
then walk nearer the door to open it, and quickly walk back behind you
sheilds. The guard should have thrown a grenade, which will come back to him
off the closed door... Now you simply walk right, blast the door, and after
recharging your gun (if you like) go right again. On this room DO NOT FIRE
A SHOT!! Crouch down ready to fire at the light's cable. You should be
able to see the reflection of the asshole guard below who you cant kill
normally. Hell keep walking in this pattern: left to right, right to left,
left to middle, middle to left. And repeat. When he is in the middle fire
and the light will fall on him! Now go back to the left, recharge your gun,
and go left until you are at the stairs. Go down and down through the
teleporter thingy!! and then right, across the water pool, past the dead
guard, and jump down the hole... Now things get a little HOT! Quickly blast
the wall to your right, and RUN right!!! Keep going through the doors
which will be blasted away behind you by an endless supply of guards! If
youve done it all right your friend should be crawling above you... When
you get to the dead end, keep making sheilds to your left and killing anyone
who gets in the way!... Wait until you friend opens the trap door, and after
making a final sheild, run and jump to his hand. He'll pull you up and you
both get into the wierd vehicle which drives itself left into some sort of
arena... In the left top corner of the screen youll get a image of your
hand!... Keep pressing all the different buttons until you and friend are
shot out!...   You'll be transfered to a nice peacefull bathing pool...
well peaceful till you crash through the roof!! Run right jumping lazers
and once on the next screen, make sheilds and stay standing (don't worry,
lazers from the left are not harmful to you, only your sheild!). Kill the
4 guards that will come after you and run right till you meat your friend
who crashes throgh the window...  Run right again... and you'll be standing
in the middle of a platform which is blasted away and you fall down... to
be grabbed by a guy that looks like your friend... he'll kick you right, and
your friend will come to the rescue... In the next room, while the two are
fighting, you have to crawl right till your next to the levers.. then wait
until the friend is pushed off. Once the bad one walks in line with the
1st blue line, press fire to blow him up with some kind of lazer... then
fire again to open the roof!... Crawl left and if you get there before being
shot you'll be sucked up the hole, and into a scene with you lying near a
bird. Crawl a little to the right, until your friend comes an helps you!

 GAME OVER (Phew and all that off the top of my head!!)
