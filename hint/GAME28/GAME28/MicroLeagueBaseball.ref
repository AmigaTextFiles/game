Game Controls 
 
If you have a mouse all input can be done by pointing to your selection and 
pressing the mouse button.  With or without the mouse, the keyboard can be 
used to select an option by pressing the left/number appearing to the left 
of the option. 
 
In a two-player game, you can alternately use the mouse, or the visiting 
team can input their selections using the number keys (top of keyboard), 
while the home team uses the numeric keypad (right of keyboard).
