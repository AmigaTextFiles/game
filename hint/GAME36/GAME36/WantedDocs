		  * W A N T E D *   D O C S    L I S T (2/10/93)

    The game docs on this list are requested for the completeness of my Game
    Player's Docs Disk series. Obviously docs aren't needed to play many of
    the simple shoot-em-up or hack & slash style games. Other games, however
    those marked with an * are definitely needed to play properly and are
    important to this disk set. Often a game appears simple, but there are
    often things that you don't know about in the game. Sometimes an object
    collected has a hidden use and requires knowing there is a hidden key
    stroke required to use. Sometimes you just need to know your objective.
     
    The disk set is getting wide distribution, but NOBODY IS CONTRIBUTING. 
    Some of my friends in the Los Angeles area who collect everything and 
    occasionally find obscure European docs disks have helped considerably.
    Some are dilligent in pulling docs from various BBS, but most people
    claim it is a waste of time because I have docs to nearly everything.
    Yes it is true that my set has docs to probably 80% of all Amiga games,
    but I PUBLISH THIS LIST BECAUSE THESE ARE THE MISSING 20% and I find
    less than 50% of the docs to the newest games within four weeks of
    release. I know some of the users have bought the games on this list or
    know someone who has. Some readers even obtain docs compilations from
    Europe or Australia. If you have the files on a disk, send it, otherwise
    Xerox the manual and send it to:

     POSTCARD MAN  VENICE POSTCARD CO. 3710 PACIFIC AVE #16 VENICE, CA. 90291

          VOICE TELEPHONE ONLY (310) 821-2425   *NO ANSWERING MACHINE*


     NOTE: * Symbol means docs are either necessary or helpful to play game.

        ************* Total = 350 missing game docs ********

	NOTE: LSD set (1-36 & SPR 1-8) from England has been helpful but 
              I'm missing several of the disks. I've added a note to the
              file name; ex: Moonmist - solution (on LSD 02) in my list
              to make it easier for some of my readers who have this
              complete set to send me a compliation of the 10 missing files.
