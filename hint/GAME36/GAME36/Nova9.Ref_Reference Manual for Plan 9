Passwords

You receive a four-character password everytime you die in the game.
It appears in the title bar of the high score screen.  This password 
will let you start the game at the world you just died on.  To use the
password: Choose to play the introduction.  When the Nova 9 title screen
appears, press P, and then type in the password for the world you wish
to return to.

Installation

The following are instructions for installing Nova 9 onto a hard disk
and booting the system.  Both can be done from either the Workbench or
the CLI.  In the instructions we assume that you are using floppy drive
DF0: and hard drive DH0:.  If your drives go by different names, replace
the drive label in the example with the correct one.  For example, if you
have an Amiga 3000, you will probably need to replace DH0: with WORK:.

Copying Nova 9 to a Hard Disk

1. Boot your system.
2. Insert Nova 9 disk #1 into the first internal floppy disk drive.
3. From Workbench, double click on the Nova1 icon and then on the Install
   icon.
4. From the CLI, type CD NOVA1: and press the return key.  Then type
   INSTALL and press the return key.  The Dynamix Install Utility 
   window will appear.
5. Choose which drive and directory you wish to install the program to.
   (The installer will automatically detect all hard disk partitions
   with enough room to install Nova 9.  If you have several partitions
   with room, click on the Drive gadget to select between them.)  To
   change the path, click on the Destination string gadget box and type
   in the new path.  The default directory is: DH0:NOVA9.
6. Click on the INSTALL button.
7. At the prompt, click on CONTINUE to install the program files.  To
   cancel the installation process, click on ABORT.

Loading Instructions

From Floppy Disks

Note: You may run the Nova 9 program from multiple floppy drives.

Self-Booting

1. Insert Nova 9 Disk #1 into drive DF0:.
2. Turn on the system.

From a Hard Disk

From Workbench

1. Load Workbench.
2. Double click on the hard disk icon.
3. Double click on the Nova9 drawer.
4. Double click on the Nova9 icon.
   
From the CLI

1. Open a CLI window.
2. Type CD DH0:NOVA9, then press the return key.
3. Type NOVA, then press the return key.

Notes

1. Nova 9 does not multitask with other programs.  For best performance,
make sure no other programs are running when you start Nova 9.

2. Although your system may have one megabyte of memory, you still may
not have enough available memory to run Nova 9.  Selfbooting the program
from disk should provide you with enough free memory to run the program.
Note; Memory allocated for hard disk partitions or resident programs
will reduce the amount available for running programs.
