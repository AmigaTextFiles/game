	   Bridge Ball by Rod Mack		
	   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~		

Bridge Ball is a rather uninspired name for a fast addictive
puzzle game that requires quick thinking and even quicker
actions.

The game consists of a number of pipes and platforms dotted
around above some water and somewhere to the right, a piece
of dry land. As the game begins, a ball will fall from the
left towards the water, but will travel horizontally from
left to right when it is in a pipe or on a platform.


	The Objective
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The objective of the game is to move the pipes and platforms
into the path of the ball so that it can be carried safely
across the water and dropped onto dry land. If the ball falls
into the water then the game is up.


	The Control
	~~~~~~~~~~~

The pipes and platforms are moved in the same way as an icon
on the workbench, i.e. when the cursor is placed over the
object and the left mouse button is held, the object can be
moved. When you wish to place the object you simply release
the left mouse button.


	Playing Bridge Ball
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bridge Ball must be loaded from the CLI and is completely
mouse controlled.

All pipes and platforms can only be picked up and moved a
certain number of times, and this varies for different objects
on different levels. When you are holding an object the cursor
will change to a number which represents the remaining number
of times the object can be picked up and moved.

If you try to pick up an object which has no more uses
remaining, a buzz sound will be heard. Some objects start with
no uses available and in this case it is up to you to build a
bridge which will make use of them, otherwise there may not be
enough pipes and platforms to carry the ball to dry land.

The ball will not travel on a pipe or platform which you are
currently holding and likewise, you can't pick up a pipe or
platform which the ball is currently on.

When the game is over, there is a ten count continue option
which will allow you to restart on the level you were on. The
left mouse button restarts the game.

Your score is mainly geared to how far you progress, but making
use of the fixed pipes will help to boost your score a little.

The first level is very simple and should make all of the above
a lot clearer to you. It will also get you used to how the pipes
and platforms should be connected together.


** Warning **	Bridge Ball can be immensely frustrating -
		especially the faster levels. If you find
		yourself getting into a state, DO NOT hit
		your keyboard, throw your mouse or thump
		your monitor. DO take a deep breath, count
		to ten and start again.

Note that if you count to more than ten you will be starting
again from level 1.
