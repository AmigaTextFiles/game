NOTE: Although the manual talks about entering inn rooms, this is (at least
      according to my observations) impossible. Even if you pay for your room,
      the door still remains locked. So don't trust inns, only use healers to
      regain your health!

First, visit Larkspur. Take the rope from the girl in the extreme upper right
corner. Then travel to the Lothian castle, where you should go along the
central corridor leading to King Lothian, but go through the door that leads
to the brig instead.
  Talk to the prisoner standing right next to the bars, and he will give you a
key. Leave the castle and go to Rastun, where you get a lantern from a man in
the upper left corner area (in the mountains). Next go to Asraela, and take
the axe in the hut.
  Go to the Forlorn castle (enter with the key), and first go to the garden in
the very center of the first floor. Take the rose. Now you could use the key
to go into the dungeon (the treasure there is the Orb of Sight), but you need
only go to the second floor and take the compass from the man in the
observatory. Use it to get to know coordinates.
  Finally, talk to Lord Forlorn and say Yes. Leave the castle and go to
Wenhea, where you must give the rose to the pretty girl. She will give you her
mirror in return. Go to the ruins of Heslon (kill the Medusa with the mirror
before entering), and grab the unicorn with the rope.
  If your inventory seems full, go back to the Forlorn castle and say Yes to
Lord Forlorn. This will take away the mirror. Otherwise just go to Marlot,
where you should show your gemstone to the man selling ships (unless you've
got 5000 gold to spare!), and he will give you a ship.
  Enter the ship. There's no need to visit Trubly, but you should go to the
mountain cave instead. Enter with the lantern and find the wizard. Talk to him
and he will give you an amulet. Use it.
  Then go to the magic tree, possibly visiting any shrines along the way. The
chant for the Shrine of Protection is "SUKANG" and the one for the Shrine of
Might is "JINSOM". You can now safely walk along the marsh, thanks to the
amulet. Chop the tree with the axe, and go to the Forlorn castle one last
time.
  Give Lord Forlorn all he wants, and he will give you a horn. Go back to your
ship and go to the evil castle, which you enter with the horn. Now take a good
look at a map (or draw one of your own) and memorise the traps. They take away
1...7 health points a time if you set them off. To progress, you must set
at least some traps off. NEVER SAVE A GAME WHEN YOU ARE ON A TRAP!
  Find the stairs and descend. Now find the potion and get it, but don't drink
it yet. Instead go to the evil sorcerer. Drink the potion (this will cure all
your wounds) and talk to the sorcerer. Kill him and take the spellbook that is
left.
  Go back to your ship, sail to the Lothian castle and enter. Go to King
Lothian and use the spellbook on him.

    THE END!
