                LEGEND OF LOTHIAN - CHARACTER EDITOR
                ====================================
                    The instruction manual
            (Legend of Lothian is (C) David W. Meny 1991)


Well, the program LothianCharEd (as it is known) is a very straightforward
program. But let's walk through it anyway.

When you start the program, you will see the main screen. This is where all
options and functions are performed. The screen is divided into two parts: the
control console and the main edit screen.
  The control console consists of five buttons. They are, from left to right:
- Load a Character. Loads ".save" file from disk, and tests if it really is a
  LOL character file. If it is, its contents are displayed in the main edit
  screen.
- Save a Character. Saves the edit screen's contents to a ".save" file to
  disk.
- Default Character. Changes all values back to their normal default values.
- Information. A nice little text message - try it, you'll like it!
- Quit. This button actually launches a really neat "Break-Out" type game,
  which has 1000's of levels and gorgeous AGA graphics! ;-)

Take care, since there are absolutely no "Are you sure?" -type requesters in
LothianCharEd. If you press a button, its function will immediately be carried
out.

The main edit screen has a multitude of interesting-looking buttons. Let's
discuss them, now.
  A black or white bar is displayed under some options. A white bar means the
option is on, a black one means that it is off.
- Location. Click on the numbers and edit the degree ratings, or click on the
  W/E or N/S buttons to change between W and E or N and S. Take care, the
  program doesn't check if you put yourself on water, mountains, etc. or even
  off the map!
- Health and Stamina. Clicking on the numbers lets you edit them. If you make
  the current ratings greater than the maximum ratings, the maximums will
  simply adapt to the new current ratings. Obviously you don't want to set
  maximum health to 0.
- Sex. Click on M(ale) or F(emale).
- Gold and Food. Just click on the numbers and type the new values.
- Indoors and "<>". When Indoors is off, your character is out in the land of
  Mercia. When it is on, your character is in the building/city displayed in
  the green box next to the "<>". Clicking on "<" or ">" will change the
  building/city. If you click on the green box with the name of the building/
  city, your location will change to its default entrance coordinates.
- Experience and Level. Just click'n'type. Level cannot be set to 0.
- Weapon and Armour. Click on the little buttons to set your weapon and
  armour. The numbers are progressive, "-" means none, "M" means Magical.
- Marsh Immune. Set to on if you wish to walk among the marsh safely. Note
  that you don't have to be carrying an amulet.
- Using Compass. Set to on if you wish to see your coordinates while playing.
  Note that you don't have to be carrying a compass.
- Inventory. A bit complex, really. To change the contents of your inventory,
  first select an item from the green box (its light will be lit). Then click
  on a location in the blue inventory box and the item will appear there.
- Ship Present. Self explanatory. If this is set to off, "Ship Location" and
  "Character in Ship" will have no effect.
- Character in Ship. Self explanatory again. Take care, the program will not
  automatically correct the coordinates so that the character indeed is in the
  ship.
- Ship Location. Edit in the same way as your own Location. There's no sense
  in putting the ship on land or in the sea out of your character's reach.

That's it. I hope you have a splendid time with LothianCharEd. And do indeed
play Legend of Lothian, as it is a marvellous little game. I just hope old
uncle David would make another RPG game.

I won't include David's address. To see it, complete Legend of Lothian or look
at its instructions.

    THE END.
