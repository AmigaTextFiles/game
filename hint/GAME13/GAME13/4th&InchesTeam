                      4th & Inches Team Construction

The IBM, Tandy Manual

Create America's Team

With the 4th & Inches Team Construction Disk you can modify six existing
teams, or create your own.  You're the ultimate General Manager: choose
the name of your team, and build your roster.  You select your players'
names, stats and skills.  And when you're all through, you can test your
picks on the 4th & Inches gridiron.  So now you're player, coach and owner
- there's no more excuses.

HOW TO GET STARTED

1  Plug in your joystick if you're going to use one.

2  Insert your DOS disk (2.0 or higher for IBM, System DOS for Tandy) into
   Drive A, close the drive door, and switch on your computer.

3  When the A> prompt appears, replace the DOS disk in Drive A with your
   4th & Inches Team Construction Disk, label side up, and close the door.

4  Type Team and press Enter. The game best suited to your system's
   graphics adaptor loads automatically.  (Adaptors include: EGA 16-color,
   CGA or Tandy 4-color, Hercules MGA, and Tandy 16-color)  And the main
   command screen appears.

Main Command Screen (Make Ten Choices)

Use the joystick or keyboard arrows to move the selection bar to any of
these ten options, then press the fire button or Enter to select it.

I/II     Select Visitors / Select Home

Both of these options make six permanent teams appear on screen - the All
Pros, Champs, AccoLads, LacoMites, Angels, and Wildcats - as well as any of
the teams that you create.  To select one, move the selection bar to a team
and press Enter or the fire button.  Your team appears at the top of the
screen in the Visitors or Home column.

                         TEAM CONSTRUCTION

In addition to being able to modify the Disk's six original teams, you can
create your own teams by selecting Blanks.  Blanks appears in the Visitors
or Home column, and now you can create your own team name, names for all
your players, and all stats and skills (for more details see Modify
Visitors / Modify Home.

III/IV  Save Visitors / Save home

After you've created or modified a team, and you're ready to place them on
the field of battle, select this option and press Enter or the fire button.
This saves the team that's displayed in the Visitors of Home slot on the
Main Command screen.  By the way: you don't have to save teams on the Team
Construction Disk.  Any formatted disk will do.  Just replace the Team
Construction Disk with another disk and choose this command.

V/VI    Modify Visitors / Modify Home

You've selected your teams, now you want to change them.  Select either
option to make that team's roster appear on screen.  Whether you're
modifying one of the original sex teams or creating a brand new one, the
changeable information is the same.  Here's a sample:

Team=Angels	Color			QUIT

Position	Name	Height	Weight	  Experience	Attributes

QB1	  Passe, Willie	6'1"	205 lbs.  4th year	Solid
QB2	  Bolle, Bob    6'2"    195 lbs.  2nd year	Quick

To change your team's name: move the selection bar to the Team option and
type in up to eight letters.  But only the first seven will appear on your
4th & Inches playing screen.  By the way: you can't use the six original
names for new teams; the computer won't save them.

To change your jersey color: move the selection bar to the Color option,
then repeatedly press Enter or the fire button to cycle through the 13
different colors.  Whatever background color you choose becomes your jersey
color.  This option, by the way, is available only in the EGA and Tandy
16-color versions of the Team Construction Disk.  In the CGA and

				2

Hercules versions the option doesn't even appear on your screen.

Note:  If two competing teams share the same color, the computer
automatically chooses another one for the Visitors.

To return to the Main Command screen: move the selection bar to QUIT and
press Enter or the fire button.

To switch first and second-string players at every position: move the
selection bar to any position (i.e. QB1) in the position column, the press
Enter or the fire button.  The first-stringer (the one the computer
defaults to) becomes the second, and vice versa.  Press again, and it
changes back to the original order.

To change a player's name: move the selection bar to any name in the name
column (i.e. Passe, Willie), then type the last name first, followed by a
comma, then the first name.  You can create any name up to 13 characters.

To change a player's height and weight: move the selection bar to any row
in the height or weight columns (i.e. 6'2" and 195), then type in new
numbers.  Note: heights must fall between 4'0" and 6'9", weights must fall
between 0 and 399, and only numbers will work.

To change a player's experience: move the selection bar to any row (i.e.
4th year) in the experience column, then type in any combination of letters
or numbers that add up to six.  Examples include: Rookie, Leader, 2nd year.

To select a player's attribute: move the selection bar to any word (i.e.
Quick) in the attribute column, then press Enter or the fire button to
cycle through that player's available skills.  The chart on page 4 tells
you how the different skills affect each position.

VII     Team Disk Directory

This option displays a list of all of the original and newly-created teams.
Press any key or the fire button to return to the Main Command screen.

VIII    Delete Team

This option also displays a list of all the teams, but now you can erase
them (except for the originals; they can't be erased.)  Select a team, and
press Enter or the fire button.  After the erasure, you automatically
return to the Main Command screen.

IX      Play 4th & Inches

When you choose this option, you are prompted to: "Insert 4th & Inches
diskette; enter any key when ready or ESC to abort."  If you insert the
game disk and press a key, 4th & Inches loads and the game will feature the
Visitors and Home teams that you created. If you press ESC, you exit to
DOS.

Note to Tandy owners: it's a good idea to install your COMMAND.COM file
from your Tandy DOS disk onto your Team Construction Disk.

				4

X       Quit

If you select this option, you exit to DOS, and save whatever modifications
you have made on your Visitors or Home teams.  However, it's a good idea to
use the Save Visitors / Save Home commands to save your handiwork before
you quit.

THE AMIGA MANUAL

Create America's Team

With the 4th & Inches Team Construction Disk you can modify six existing
teams, or create your own.  You're the ultimate General Manager: choose the
name of your team, and build your roster.  You select your players' names,
stats and skills.  And when you're all through, you can test your picks on
the 4th & Inches gridiron.  So now you're player, coach and owner - there's
no more excuses.

How to Get Started

1  Plug in your joystick if you're using one.
2  Kickstart your computer with Kickstart version 1.2 (if necessary)
3  Insert your 4th & Inches Team Construction Disk into the disk drive, 
   label side up.
4  Turn on your computer and the program loads automatically.  After the
   title screen, the Main Command screen appears.

Main Command Screen (Make Ten Choices)

Use the joystick or mouse to move the arrow cursor to any of these ten
options, then press the fire button or left mouse button to select it. 
(Note: to make things less cumbersome, fire button = left mouse button for
the rest of these instructions.)

				5

                 T E A M   C O N S T R U C T I O N

I/II    Select Visitors / Select Home

Both of these options make six permanent teams appear on screen - the All
Pros, Champs, AccoLads, LacoMites, Angels, and Wildcats - as well as any of
the teams that you create.  To select one, move the arrow cursor to a team,
press the fire button to highlight it.

Then move the arrow cursor to the Load Team option and press the fire
button.  The name of your selection appears at the top of the screen in the
Visitors or Home column.

In addition to being able to modify the Disk's six original teams, you can
create your own Visitors or Home teams by selecting the "team" in the list
called -blanks-.  With this selection, you create a name for your team, as
well as all the players' names and statistics (see Modify Visitors / Modify
Home).

To return to the Main Command screen, move the cursor to DONE and press the
fire button.

III/IV   Save Visitors / Save Home

After you've created or modified a team, and you're ready to place them on
the field of battle, select this option and press the fire button.  This
saves the team that's displayed in the Visitors or Home slot on the Main
Command screen.  By the way: you don't have to save teams on your Team
Construction Disk.  Any formatted disk will do - just replace the Team
Construction Disk with another disk and choose this command.

V/VI     Modify Visitors / Modify Home

You've selected your teams, now you want to change them.  Select either
option to make that team's roster appear on screen.  Whether you're
modifying one of the original six teams or creating a brand new one, the
changeable information is the same.  Here's a sample:

Team = Angels             Color               QUIT

Position	Name	   Height	Weight	  Experience   Attributes

QB1	   Passe, Willie    6'1"	205 lbs.   4th year     Solid
QB2        Bolle, Bob       6'2"        195 lbs.   2nd year     Quick

				6

To change your team's name: move the arrow cursor to the name of the team
(i.e. Angels) and press the fire button to highlight it.  Then you can type
in up to eight letters.  But only the first seven will appear on your 4th &
Inches playing screen.  After you type in the name, you must press Return
to enter it.  By the way: you can't use the six original names for new
teams; the computer won't save them.

To change your uniform colors: move the arrow cursor to the Color option,
press the fire button, and the following screen appears.  (Only the mouse
and joystick work on this screen.)

1  Move the cursor arrow to any of the four color choices - Shirts, Pants,
   Skin, or Flash - then press the fire button to highlight it.

2  Now move the cursor arrow to any of the six arrows on either side of the
   three color bars.

3  Press the fire button repeatedly on a Right arrow to increase the
   intensity of a color; press repeatedly on a Left arrow to decrease it.
   The change is reflected in two places:  first, on the two football
   players (whatever option you "highlight" changes colors), and secondly,
   on the Visitors or Home columns where the team names are listed (the
   background color is the shirt color and the letters are the pants
   color).

				7

4  Use the three color bars to "mix" colors for your highlighted selection.

5  When you choose the Flash Color option, you can select a second set of
   colors for your team.  Both sets will appear on your flashing player -
   the one you control.

6  Move the cursor arrow to DONE and press the fire button to return to the
   Main Command screen.

To return to the Main Command screen: move the arrow cursor to DONE and
press the fire button.

To switch first and second-string player's at every position: move the
arrow cursor to any position (i.e. QB1) in the position column, press the
fire button to highlight it, then press the space bar.  The first-stringer
(the one the computer defaults to) becomes the second, and vice versa. 
Press again, and it changes back to the original order.

To change a player's name: move the arrow cursor to any name in the name
column (i.e. Passe, Willie), press the fire button to highlight it, then
type the last name first, followed by a comma, then the first name.  You
can create any name up to 13 characters.

To change a player's height and weight: move the arrow cursor to any height
or weight in the center two columns (i.e. 6'2" and 195), press the fire
button to highlight it, then type in new numbers.  Note: heights must fall
between 4' 0" and 6' 9", weights must fall between 0 and 399, and only
numbers will work.

To change a player's experience: move the arrow cursor to any row (i.3.,
4th year) in the experience column, press the fire button to highlight it,
then type in any combination of letters of numbers that add up to six. 
Examples include: Rookie, Leader, 2nd year.

To select a player's attribute: move the arrow cursor to any word (i.e.
Quick) in the attribute column, press the fire button to highlight it, then
press the space bar to cycle through the different skills.  See the chart
on page 6 to see how the different skills change the playing style of each
position.

VII     Team Disk Directory

This option displays a list of the original and newly-created teams.  If
you save more teams than can appear on screen at one time, move the arrow
cursor to either arrow icon and press the fire button to scroll through the
list.  Move the arrow cursor to DONE and press the fire button to return to
the Main Command screen.

VIII    Delete Team

This option also displays a list of all the teams, but now you can erase
them (except for the originals; they can't be erased).  Select a team, and
press the fire button to highlight it.  Then move the arrow cursor to
Delete Team and press the fire button - that team is history.  Once again,
move the cursor to DONE and press the fire button to return to the Main
Command screen.

IX      Play 4th & Inches

If you select this option, a prompt appears telling you to "Please insert
volume ACCOLADE Fourth & Inches in any drive."  If you do that, 4th &
Inches loads automatically, and the game will feature the Visitors and Home
teams you created.

X       Quit

If you select this option, you exit to DOS.  Be sure to use the Save
Visitors or Save Home commands before you quit if you want to save any
changes that you've made to your teams.
