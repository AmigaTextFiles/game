                     Wayne Gretzky precis by DR.FREQUENCY

                --      TEAM QUALITY LEVELS      --

     There are four different quality levels which you can play at. They
are,  as follows:

        .High School
        .College
        .Junior
        .Pro

     You tell will perform the best at the pro level and obviously the
worst at the High School level. The default settings are you, Pro and the
computer High School level to get you used to the game. Nice aren't they?

                --      GAME SPEEDS             --

     Two game speeds are offered to you: normal and slow. The default
setting is NORMAL. Slow speed is rougly 25% of normal speed - you figure it
out!

                --      GAME TYPES              --

     You can choose either PRACTICE, NORMAL, or PLAYOFF modes of play.
During a practice game you are reduced to three players and a goalie.
Penalties  will be called in a practice game, but you won't go to the
penalty box. In normal game mode, you play as normal hockey and have a 5
minute overtime in the event of a  occurs. At the end of the overtime if
the score isn't altered, the game will remain a tie. In playoff mode, you
play as normal, save overtime. If there is a tie at the end of overtime you
will play to  the end - SUDDEN DEATH!

                --      FIGHTS                  --

     Because fights are a very real part of hockey and Wayne wanted to
learn how to fight, they have been included in the game. Selecting fights
from  the main menu allows occasional brawls to occur with players who have
rough contact. (You can also get the player down on the ice and beat the
shit out of him 'till the refs jump on you!)

                --      TEAM CONSTRUCTION MENUS: EDIT ROSTER     --

     Clicking on the EDIT ROSTER brings up a list of the team's players
along with their numbers, name, position, and individual player ratings for
11 characteristics. These, ranking from 1 to 9 are:

        . AGGRESSION    . QUICKNESS     . POWER
        . FATIGUE       . PENALTY       . INJURY
        . SKATING       . PASSING       . PUCK CONTROL
        . CHECKING      . SHOOTING

     Assigning individual ratings for each of these characteristics allows
you to influence a team's playing style. For example, an aggressive team
would be composed of players with high aggression (really?). 
     To change a player's characteristic, place the cursor over the number
you want to change. Notice that the entire line is highlighted while the
background of the said characteristic is black. Use the keyboard to change
the player's name. With the mouse, hold the left button down and move up to
increase the stat. With the joystick, hold the fire button down and move
the stick down.
     The exit gets you back to the EDITing menu. Also in the upper right of
the screen is a team strength number. This allows you to measure the teams
strength against another team's. For example CALGARY or MONTREAL would have
a team strength around 1450-1650, while a weaker team like MINNESOTA would
have a total around 1000-1200.

                --      PICK LINES              --

     The menus brings up three columns of stats for, EVEN LINES (5-5),
POWER PLAYS (5-4, 5-3), PENALTY KILLING (4-5, 3-5) allowing you to custom
create your lines for specialty teams. For the easist part, let Wayne set
up the  lines and then play.

                --      TEAMDOS MENUS           --

     There are three types of DOS menus:

                . TEAM DOS menus - loads teams on and off data disk.
                . GAME DOS menus - saves games for continuation later.
                . STATS DOS menus - saves stats for use league play.

     When selecting a DOS menu, your computer will attempt to locate a 
BETHESDA SOFTWARE formatted data disk in one of your floppy disk drives. If
you have a secondary drive attached to your system, it will be checked 
first. 

     IMPORTANT: You can only save to BETHESDA SOFTWORKS formatted data
disks. If you do not have one, you can create one with FORMAT DISK option.
You  cannot save files to your Wayne Gretzky boot disk. If you try to save
data to a non WGH formatted disk, the TEAMDOS menu will not recognize that
disk.
     When the program has found a properly formatted disk in the drive, all 
available files for that DOS menu will be listed.

                --      PASSING AND SHOOTING THE PUCK   --

     To pass the puck with the mouse, position the cursor over the player
you want the puck to go to. With the joystick, move the stick in the
direction of the player and the puck will go that way. If you position the
stick to- wards the goal, the player will do a slapshot at the goal. With
the mouse, put the cursor in the net and double-click.

                --      GAINING CONTROL OF THE PUCK     --
        
     There are a few methods of getting the puck away from the other team.
You can move next to him, and, if your player is strong in checking,
skating and puck-handling skills, steal the puck from him. It's an OK   
method but doesn't always work especially at the PRO level.

     Another method is to skate fast into the puck-carrier and press the 
button in attempt to knock him down. You need to be a fast skater, have
lots of power and the above skills as well. You also have a greater chance
at of getting a penalty this way - it's not good when you just got control
of the puck!

     Finally, grab that player with the puck! Skate along side him and hold
 your button down. Don't hold it down too long though because you will get
a penalty for sure! It slows him down and eventually he will fall.. a risky
move but works when he's on a breakaway...

     'Demand'ing a pass. If you are using the mouse, place the cursor over
your position and click a few times. This will cause the first player on
your team, when he gets the puck, to pass it directly to you. Be sure there
is no-one else in your way though 'cause your players don't look where they
pass it, they just pass it to you!. If you are using the joystick, let go
of the stick and press your button a few times. The same caution applys!

                --      SCOREBOARDS     --

     There are two scoreboards on the screen all of the time. The upper
scoreboard is your typical scoreboard, displaying information like:
score, team names, period, and time left in the game.

     The lower score board is more for coaching and stuff. The coaching
status displays the current line on the ice, the current play, and current
player being controlled. Next to the coaching status is the ENERGY status
and we  can all figure this out, can't we? The higher percentage, the more
fresh our players are on the ice. If you are coaching, don't let your
players get  below 65%.. if you've every played hockey - you'll know why!

                --      KEYBOARD COMMANDS       --

     You can do three di ferent things with the keyboard during the game.
You can select the play, change lines, and control a different player. In
the  coaching status display there will either be: P L C, relating to
current play (P), current line (L), and current player control (C).

                --      SELECTING PLAYS         --

    To select a play press the ALT key and one of the following for the 
corresponding play;

        F1 for play 1 (HOME)            F6 for play 1 (VISITORS)
        F2 for play 2                   F7 for play 2
        F3 for play 3                   F8 for play 3
        F4 for play 4                   F9 for play 4
        F5 for play 5                   F0 for play 5

   Play 1 - The forwards spread out across the entire attacking zone.
   Play 2 - The left wing and centre cross over.
   Play 3 - The right wing and centre cross over.
   Play 4 - The forwards flood the left side of the attacking zone.
   Play 5 - The forwards flood the right side of the attacking zone.fensive 
            for the short team and play 5 is the most aggressive for the 
            short team.

                --      SELECTING LINES         --

     There are three lines available to you at any time of the game. To
select a line, press the AMIGA key and either F1, F2, or F3, for the
appropriate  line.

                --      SELECTING CONTROL PLAYER        --

     You can either control the centreman, left wing, right wing, left
defense, or right defense - you can't conrol the goalie (too bad!). To

        F1 - Left defense (HOME)        F6 - Left Defense (lISITORS)
        F2 - Left wing                  F7 - Left wing

        F5 - Right defense              F0 - Right defense

                --      PULLING THE GOALIE!     --

     If you really get deperate and Wayne isn't coaching, you can pull your
goalie to get that extra man on the ice. Your goalie will be pulled for you
automatically when there is a delayed whistle on a penalty to the other
team.
  
   For the HOME TEAM press, "Z" to pull your goalie. The "/" for the
VISITORS.

   To pause the game press, "P". When you have paused the game you can move
the rink around by the cursor keys on the keyboard.

   The rest of the manual has hints on play and the origins of hockey, but
as any good Canadian knows, we already know this stuff!

   This was brought to you by, Dr.Frequency. Enjoy the game.. it's awesome,
eh.
