                              4th & Inches

KICKOFF AND GAMEPLAY

The play screen: Divided into four sections-the field, offensive play
selection box, defensive play selection box, and the time-to-go, yards-
to-score box.

The line of scrimmage: Displayed in the center of your field of vision
with about ten yards showing in either direction. An arrow at the bottom
of the field marks the 1st down yard line.

Choosing plays: Offensive and defensive selection boxes are seperated by
a series of arrows which correspond to the joystick positions. To make a
selection, move the joystick to the indicated position, then press the
fire button. Seletions are highlighted in one player mode, but not with
two players-that way, your opponent can't see your selections. To make a
selection with a mouse, move the mouse in the direction of the arrow beside
the desired play, then press the left mouse button.

Selection boxes: For most plays, three successive actions are needed to
select a team formation, the play itself, and the position you want to
take. But only one action is required for kickoffs and extra points.
Refer to the sections marked The Plays and Playbook for a list of the
possible selections and a description of the positions and plays.

The snap: The players move to the line of scrimmage after offense and
defense formations are chosen. After you select the play and position,
the action starts automatically. In a few seconds, a player on each side
blinks. These are the players you control.
If you've elected to pass, the quarterback throws the ball when you press
the fire button. After the throw, the play "zooms" to the receiver. If he
catches it, he blinks, and you now control his running.
Important note:When you use the mouse to control a player, he will
continue to run in the direction the mouse moves until you press the left
mouse button-the equivalent of centering the joystick.

Defense: You also control the blinking defender. When a zoom shifts the
action to another display, you may automatically control a different
player.

Kicks: To punt, press the fire button after the punter receives the ball
and begins to blink. To kick off, or to boot field goals and extra points,
press the fire button as the kicker approaches the holder. Timing is
critical and practice makes perfect.

TIMEOUTS

To call a timeout (you get three per half), press the spacebar to go to
the Coach's Screen. Then move the joystick up to highlight the TIMEOUT
line, and press the fire button.

PENALTIES

Because there are no referees in 4th & Inches, there are no penalties.
But there are some limits. In the one-player game, you can go to the
Coach's Screen only once per quarter after you've selected a formation.
Do it more than once, and you're penalized five yards.
However, you can go to the Coach's Screen after a formation is set if you
call a timeout. And, of course, you can go to the Coach's Screen as often
as you like before you select a formation.

THE COACH'S SCREEN

Press the spacebar to go to the Coach's Screen, where you can view the
scoreboard, call timeouts, substitute players, and check player statistics.
To return to the play field, press the space bar again.

Selecting players: For each position, there is a first and scond-string
player. The computer automatically selects the first-string players at the
beginning of each game. But you can select second-stringers by moving the
joystick or mouse up or down until the player's name is highlighted, then
press the fire button.
For some plays (double tight end plays, for example), both first and second-
string players are automatically substituted into the lineup. Special teams
are usually composed of second-stringers. However, your first-string
wingback returns all punts and kickoffs.

Player stats: Statistics for each highlighted player are shown at the
bottom of the screen. These include height, weight, and years played, as
well as a qualitative assessment of speed and strength such as: SPEED!,
FAST, QUICK, STEADY, SOLID, STRONG, TOUGH, BIG!.
SPEED! is used for the fastest players and BIG! for the slowest and
strongest. In general, the bigger and stronger, the slower they are.

THE PLAYS

Formations: Five formations from the following list are displayed, and
one can be selected for each play.

       OFFENSE                               DEFENSE
Field Goal & Extra Points           3-4 (good against the run)
Punt                                4-3 (good against the pass)
Short Yardage                       Flex (fairly good against both)
Double Tight End                    Nickel (very good vs. the pass)
Pro Set                             Short (Yardage)(very good vs. run)
Stongside Back
Weakside Back
Double Wing
Spread
Shotgun w/Back
Shotgun w/o Back

Offensive selections are always made at the bottom of the Field Screen
in the larger of the two boxes. Defensive picks are made in the smaller
one. The background color of the boxes tells you which team is on offense
and which is on defense.

THE PLAYBOOK

The key to successful offense is knowing what play to call in a given
situation and executing that play to perfection. You're the on-field
general. When you call a play in the huddle, you must be confident that
everyone knows where to go and what to do when they get there.

HINTS, TIPS AND STARTEGY

*If a game ends in a tie, you can play an unlimited number of "sudden death"
 overtime quarters.

*From time to time, the Coach's Screen appears automatically to show the
 results of a play just run.

*Receivers are human, so of course they occasionally won't execute their
 pass routes to perfection. Remember, when going down the middle, these guys
 are sometimes intimidated by defensive backs.

*In general, longer passes have a lower percentage of success than short
 ones.

*If you select a pass play, you don't have to pass-just don't press the
 fire button and you can run. However, it doesn't work the other way
 around; call a run and you have to run because the fire button won't
 work. No "audibles" at the line of scrimmage on a run.

*Once the play starts, the quarterback cannot run up, down or out of the
 display field area until he first crosses the line of scrimmage.
