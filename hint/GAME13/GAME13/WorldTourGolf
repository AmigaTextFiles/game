Aiming Your Shot
On the left-hand side of the screen,a crosshair indicates the direction
your shot is currently aimed. World Tour Golf automatically positions
the crosshair on a straight line between the ball and the hole. At
times, though, you won't want to hit your ball straight towards the
hole. To adjust your aim, use the mouse to click on the spot on the
overhead view window where you want to target your shot. The point of
view window will change to show your new target direction. Always
factor the wind direction and speed into your adjustment. If the wind
is blowing more than 2 or 3 miles per hour, you may need to aim into
the wind to compensate. Note: Some holes may be displayed in the
overhead view with the tee at the top. The wind direction is relative
to the overhead view - not to the point-of-view window.

Hitting the Ball
When you are ready to hit a shot, position the pointer on the golfer's
point of view window. Next, press the Button, and the swing meter
appears in the lower right-hand corner of your screen. Press the Button
a second time to start your backswing. Press a third time to decide
the strength of the shot and begin your downswing. To hit the ball
full strength, press the Button when the meter reaches the 100%
position. To hit the ball a shorter distance, press the button before
the 100% point. You can also overswing , which may hit the ball farther
than the club's maximum range, or cause an erratic shot. Press a fourth
time to hit the ball. To hit the ball straight, press the Button when
the swing meter is pointing straight down.
