 Concept
 *******

The concept of `Cheat`
======================

   
   A lot of programs are quite difficult (e.g. games). Some guys say that it
isn`t hard to  finsh a game, but have they really played it to the end. The
common opinion should be `No!`. Most games appear easy in the beginning, but
end in a horrorscenario. The easiest thing should be to `train` the game and
make it simpler. But this would end in modifying the initial original code and
it works only at this only one.


Here comes the time of `Cheat`, because it is only used in memory and not in
the original code of the program.  Advantage:    No copyright-violence is
caused. Disadvantage: Both (Cheat and programm) have to be in memory and the
program has to work in multitasking.

 Systemrequirements
 ==================

  `Cheat` requires OS 2.04 or higher and runs under every MC680x0 processor.
With MC68020 and above odd addresses can also be changed and one can search in
word- and longword operation.
   Minimal memory requirement is 512kByte, but the more the better, because
both the Cheat AND the program have to be in memory.

The `reqtools.library` of Nico François is needed.

 Installation
 ============

   Cheat comes with Commodore`s installer, therefor it`s quite easy to install
on your harddisk or disks. Just click twice on the install-icon in your
language.

Otherwise just copy Cheat to your desired place and copy your
language-catalogue into the LOCALE:xxx directory (xxx stands for your own
language).

 What do I need a `Cheat` for?
 *****************************

Overview
 ========

   Sometimes you have the problem that you need some more lives to finish a
game or in other games (e.g. Civilization or SimCity) some more money to solve
tha game.

   Cheat was made for those guys who want to play a game to the really end.

 Main-window
 ===========

   The main-window is splitted into three areas. In the top there is a
message-window. Under that there are some gadgets for adjustment and
confuguration and at the bottom are the action-buttons.

   When `Cheat` is started your processor and memoy type are displayed
(chip-, fast- and even virtuell memory).


   In the beginning following adjustment-gadgets are enabled:

- Searchvalue:
    Here the searchvalue has to be typed in (e.g. `100`).
  If the `Hunt Mem`-gadget has been pressed and an address in the
  `Address`-gadget has been chosen (works only if the number of found
  addresses is smaller than 100), then you can type in the `Edit-value`,
  which is written to the address when you press `Edit`.

- Cheatlevel:
     With this gadget you can change different addresses at the same time 
   by selecting the Cheat-level number (1-5).

- Hunt size:
     Here you can change between byte-, word-, longword-operation mode.

- Pass through:
     If there is any FAST-RAM in your Amiga, you can choose between CHIP-, 
   FAST- and CHIP&FAST-RAM searchmode.
   Without FAST-RAM this gadget will stay disabled.

- Adresses: (right bottom corner)
     With MC68020 or higher you can choose odd addresses in word- and
   longword operations. 

   Following adjustment-gadgets are disabled and get enabled if you choose an
address and has just been edited, because only then you can start the `Trace
Mode`.

- Seconds
     Whith this value you choose the time of delay `Cheat` looks for the
   desired address and edits it automatically.

- Trace Mode:
     You can choose between `Minimum`, `Maximum` and `None`.

   `Minimum` : After the chosen time in `Seconds`, `Cheat` checks if the
               address-value is less than the `Trace Mode`-value.
   `Maximum` : After the chosen time in `Seconds`, `Cheat` checks if the
               address-value is higher than the `Trace Mode`-value.
   `None`    : After the chosen time in `Seconds`, `Cheat` will always write
               the `Trace Mode`-value in the selected address.


   At the bottom are the action-buttons

- Hunt Mem
     Memory is searched for the address-value in the selected memory with the
   chosen `Hunt Size`.
   Found addresses are saved in a dynamic memory-list.

- Search Adds (Is enabled after you have selected the `Hunt Mem`-gadget.)
     Searches in memory-list for the search-value.

- Edit (Is enabled after you have chosen an address in the `Address`-gadget.)
     Writes the edit-value in the selected address. Now you able to start the
   `Trace Mode`.

- Trace (Is enabled after you have selected the `Edit`-gadget.)
     `Trace Mode` is enabled and `Cheat` looks automatically in the chosen
    address if the search-value has changed.

 System
 ======

   `Cheat` was written in pure assembler and is therefor really fast. It is
system-conform, because it doesn`t use any `hacks`.

 Acknoledgement
 ==============

   Thanks must go to the following friends...

   - Matthias Scheurich ... always no time, but he gave me some very useful
                            hints and designed the GUI.

   - Michael Illig ... helped me at the translation to english (You can
                       see(read) the result) and tested `Cheat` on an A3000

   - Sascha Bader ... Cray-worker at Opel. Panic rulez !

   - Michael Grünewald ... has tested the `Cheat` in extreme ways.
                           He is the game player and not that intelligent.

   - Sibille Neumann ... she is the best girl-friend in the world

 Discussion
 ==========

Q:	I made an input in the searchvalue-gadget but `Cheat` is hunting for `0`. Why ?

A:	Just press `CR` or `Tab` to signal `Cheat` that you have changed the value.


Q:	Why does the `Trace-Mode` takes so long to deactivate ?
	Because of the seconds-gadget. `Cheat` is using this time to wait via Delay().
	Just decrease the value to shorten the time, but you will have a little bit more idle.

 History
 =======


Version 1.00	12.03.95

	- First publiv release
	  In may `96 upload to Aminet.


Version 1.01	01.06.96 (More than one year later)

	- Error in `Hunt-Mem` corrected.

	- Added versionsstring.


Version 1.05	02.06.96 (Ups, only one day later)

	- Instead clearing 28*100+12 Bytes for the `ListView-Gadget`, Cheat cleared 28*100 langwords.
	  That caused sometimes a `Mem Corrupt Error`


Version 1.1	03.06.96

	- Removed two Enforcer Hits.
