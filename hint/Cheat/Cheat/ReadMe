Cheat Version 1.1


Cheat is able to manupulate all areas of memory, e.g. for games or utils.
All memorysegments are hunted for a special value and a special size (Longword, word, bytes)
The GUI ist fontsensitive and doesn`t use MUI !!!  The memoryusage is for that and assembler
only about 22 KB.


New:

- Removed the two enforcer hits.
- Nor more `MemCorruptError`


Bonus:
 To show the evolution history of Cheat, thre old versions of Cheat were added.
 These versions ONLY work if 2MB chip and 4MB fast-memory are installed.
 The 4MB have to be just behind the 2MB chip. So any `normal` memory expansion will work with them.

			 ---> These versions are really OLD !!! <---

 - CW:		Hunt for words. Only one address can be edited.
 - CheatBytes:	Hunt for bytes. Look CW.
 - CheatAll:	Hunt for bytes. All addresses will be manipulated.
