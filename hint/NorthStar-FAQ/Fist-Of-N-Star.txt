I.Story
           If you've been watching the anime of this game on your cable
 channel network then you'll be familiar with this.But anyway here's a
 brief synopsis:
     In the tradition of the movie MAD MAX:THE ROAD WARRIOR comes FIST
OF 
THE NORTHSTAR,an action-packed kung fu epic adventure set on a
savage,postapocalyptic earth.Ken Shido of the NORTH STAR has been
entrusted with the sacred martial art of the Great Bear,otherwise known
as the Fist of the Northstar.Can the Fist protect innocent people from
the bloodthirsty gangs that terrorize earth's few survivors?

IV.Help Wanted

1.Anime Translation Dialogue (anybody knows what they're saying?)
2.Slightly wanted FAQ:How to beat the last level boss?(damn impossible
if you ask me)
3.Most wanted FAQ:The Ending Scene Password(I really neeeeed this!!!)

I never actually finished the game because for some strange reason I
could'nt seem to beat the last level boss because of his invulnerability
.If this becomes impossible to do so,try hacking the ending scene
password,and please do so anybody out there who does know how to just
add it to this FAQ.I'm at the end of my rope here.

P.S. 
NEXT WEEK I'll be adding thelist of possibly translated fighting moves
for this game.Until then,CIAO.
