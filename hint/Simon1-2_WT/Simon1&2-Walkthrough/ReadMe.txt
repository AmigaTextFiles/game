            Some notes about Simon The Sorcerer 1 & 2 Walkthroughs
         ------------------------------------------------------------

  - Simon The Sorcerer 1 -

I found the solution to Simon The Sorcerer on an old disk I once had. I don't
remember what this disk was called since I don't have it any more, but I think
it was a compilation of various text files of some sort. I haven't got a clue
about who wrote it because the authors name was not included in the solution.

Since I have not followed it straight through when playing the game, I can't
guarantee that all information is correct.



  - Simon The Sorcerer 2 -

This walkthrough was downloaded from the internet after I got totally stuck in
the game. I don't exactly remember from where I got it, but it was a site that
contains cheats and walkthroughs for various games.

It is based on the PC version of Simon the Sorcerer 2, I don't know if there
are any differences between the Amiga and PC versions, but I'll suggest that
you have this in mind, if you decide to use it.
As with the Simon 1 solution, I did not follow it straight through when I
played the game, I only used it when I was totally stuck.

This walkthrough was written by: Beowulf [RAZOR/DOD]



  - Legal Stuff -

Since I'm not the author of any of these files, I can't claim any copyright
over them. This means that as far as I'm concerned, you can do what ever
you want with them, and you don't even have to ask my first either.
You can include them in your own cheat-compilation if you want to, and you
don't even have to include this ReadMe file in it.



  - Simon The Sorcerer notes -

This has to be said about Simon The Sorcerer, it is one of the most system
friendly games I have ever come across in my entire life as an Amiga owner.
I start it from my Workbench (which has a lot of patches and stuff running)
and it WORKS!!! There are no crashes or anything else.  I find this to be
really amazing when considering the age of the game.

The only thing I have come across so far is a bug in the Tower of Doom. There
should be a mouse there, but it will not appear when I have started the game
from my Workbench. In this case, I have to start Simon The Sorcerer without
having Workbench loaded in order to catch the mouse.

But still, hats off to the programmers of Simon The Sorcerer for doing an
excellent job with the game all those years ago.

Please Note!  I have the ECS version of Simon The Sorcerer which I run on my
A1200 with a 040 processor & 32 MB of extra RAM, it's this version I'm talking
about here. I mention this because I have heard that there are other problems
with the CD32 version of the game (not when playing it on a CD32 though :-)
