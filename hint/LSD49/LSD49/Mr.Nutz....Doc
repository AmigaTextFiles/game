THE MAP

The Map Shows Peanut Planet, Mr.Nutz's Holiday Home. The Background Shows The
Continents Of The Planet And Focuses On Mr.Nutz's Island. Mr Nutz Moves On
The Paths That Can Be Found Everywhere On The Islands. To Reach A Different
Island He Can Use Rafts And Transporters. Some Of The Transporters Have Been
Deactivated By The Chickens, So You'll Have To Activate Them During The
Game. On Each Continent There Are 5 Important Bases. Mr.Nutz Must Chase Away
The Chickens From These Bases. An Important Base Can Be Recognized By A Red
Pennant Or A Cave Entrance. Blue Pennants Mark Less Important Bases. You
Don't Have To Clear The Chickens From Them. To Enter A Base Simply Walk Into
A Cave Entrance Or Push The Fire Button When Standing Next To A Pennant. 
There Is Also One Huge Techno City On Every Continent. This Techno City Is 
Protected By A Big Gate Which Will Not Open Before You Succeed In Liberating 
All Important Bases. The Exit Of A Techno City Leads To A Tunnel System, 
Bringing You To The Vacuum Machine. There You Will Have To Defeat A Truly 
Tough End-Of-Level Sentry. Destroying This Sentry Will Bring You Automatically 
To The Next Continent And The Surviving Chickens Will Also Flee There From 
The One You're Currently On. It's Your Task To Free All Four Continents And To 
Save The Planet. On The Map Mr.Nutz Will Talk With Many Inhabitants, Some Of 
Them Giving Useful Hints. But You Should Be Careful Because Many Of Them, 
Especially Chickens, Will Tell You Lies!. 

Chests

Chests With Useful Things Inside Them Can Be Found Everywhere On The
Islands. Often The Chickens Hide Treasures In Them. Sometimes They Contain
Messages From The Seagull. 

Rocks

There Are Many Rocks Blocking The Paths. The Chickens Have Put Them There In
Order To Stop Mr.Nutz. You Can Blow Up These Rocks With A Bomb By Simply
Pushing The Fire Button When Standing In Front Of A Rock (Of Course That
Won't Work If You Don't Have Any Bombs Left!) 

Transporters

Transporters Can Be Used To Travel Long Distances In Short
Time. Unfortunately The Chickens Have Deactivated Many Of Them, And These Are
Marked With A Red Dot. The Transporters Lead From The Transporter Control
Area To The Different Bases And Vice Versa, And Remain Deactivated Until You
Have Liberated All The Bases On The Continent. There Are The Ordinary Grey
Transporters And Coloured Ones That Can Beam You From Continent To Continent. 
The Intercontinental Transporters Open Whenever You Free A Continent. 
The Red Transporters Are Used By The Peanut Planet Security Service. 

Rafts

Many Of The Islands Are Connected With Rafts. Use The Landing Stages To
Travel With One Of Them. The Rafts Make Their Way From Island To Island
Automatically. 

Mushrooms

There Are Several Red Mushrooms On The Islands. Simply Jump On Them To Gain
Height. 

The Status Display

During The Game There Is A Status Display At The Corner Of The Screen. The
Number On The Top Left Informs You How Many Lifes Mr.Nutz Has Left. To The
Right Of That You Can See The Current Number Of Continues.  (If You Lose All
Your Lifes You Can Use A Continue To Have Another Try. ) Below You Can See
Mr.Nutz's Hit Points. The Numbers At The Bottom Of The Screen Stand For The
Number Of Gems And The Number Of Bombs Mr.Nutz Is Currently Carrying. There
Is One Item On Every Island That Enhances Mr.Nutz's Skills. The Bottom Line
Shows Which Of The Different Skills Mr.Nutz Owns: 

Feather   - The Feather Means That Mr.Nutz Can Fly. A Crossed Out Feather
            Means That Mr.Nutz Can't Fly Because He Doesn't Have Enough 
            Hitpoints.  (You Need At Least Five Hit Points. ) 

Diving Goggles - With The Diving Goggles You Can Stay Underwater As Long As
                 You Wish Without Them Mr.Nutz Will Turn Blue After A
                 While. When He Does, You Must Bring Him Out Of The Water To
                 Catch His Breath Or He Will Start To Lose Hitpoints. The
                 Flash Means Mr.Nutz Can Turn Himself Into A Bolt Of
                 Lightning. The Number Appearing Instead Of The Symbol
                 Informs You How Many Spells You Have Got Left. Press The
                 Space Bar To Cast A Flash Spell. Now Mr.Nutz Is
                 Invulnerable And He's A Deadly Threat To Every Chicken  (He
                 Can Even Destroy Doors. )     

Fist   - The Fist Gives Mr.Nutz The Ability Of Defeating Small And Medium
         Enemies During A Jump. Hold The Fire Button And Push The Joystick
         Down.  While The Map Is Active You Also Can See The Number Of Stars 
         You Own. 

Controlling Mr.Nutz

Mr.Nutz Can Be Played With A Joystick Or Joypad. Moving The Joystick/Pad To
The Left Or To The Right Lets Mr.Nutz Accelerate. He Won't Get Any Faster
After The Maximum Speed Is Reached. If You Stop Running Mr.Nutz Will Get Slower
Again. Moving The Joystick/Pad The Opposite Direction To Which He Is Going, 
His Speed Will Decrease More Quickly. Running Up A Hill Will Decrease Your 
Speed. Running Down A Hill Will Increase It Again. If The Hill Is Very
Steep It Might Be Useful To Take A Run-Up. If You Want To Jump, You'll Have
To Push The Fire Button (B) On The Joypad Or Up When Using A Joystick. To
Defeat Your Enemies Simply Jump Upon Them. (Guess Why Mr.Nutz Is So Strong?
Right! Because Of All The Curd Cheese Turnovers. . . Maybe He Will Tell You A
Little More About It Later On. ) When An Enemy Hits Mr.Nutz He Will Lose One
Hitpoint. The Hitpoint Is Then Set Free And Bounces Around. You Can Try Catch
It Again. If An Enemy Hits Mr.Nutz And He Has No Hitpoints He'll Lose One
Life. If You Lose All Your Lifes You Can Use A Continue Or The Game Will Be
Over. It Is Always Possible To Leave A Base By Means Of Pressing The Esc Key, 
But This Means You Will Lose Everything You Have Collected In This Base. 

Flying

During The Game Mr.Nutz Will Find Magic Feathers. Those Feathers Will Turn
Him Into A Real Flying Squirrel. The First Feather Allows You Him To
Guide. Take A Run-Up And Jump. Now Push The Fire Button And Push The Joystick
Up. This Will Allow Mr.Nutz To Glide Over Canyons And Other Dangerous Places. 
The Second Feather Will Give You Control Over The Direction Of Your
Flight. If You Push The Joystick In The Same Direction You're Flying Mr.Nutz
Will Fly Towards The Ground And Gain Speed. Pushing The Joystick In The
Opposite Direction Will Let Mr.Nutz Fly Up Again. If You're Fast Enough You
Can Even Reach Higher Places By Means Of Flying. The Third Feather Turns
Mr.Nutz Into A Perfect Flying Squirrel. Now He Can Fly Complete Loops And
Change The Direction Of His Flight By Means Of Pressing The Firebutton And
Pushing The Joystick In The Opposite Direction. 

Special Items

During His Adventures Mr.Nutz Will Find Many Items. He Can Use Them To
Liberate Peanut Planet. 

Hitpoints:  There Are Many Hitpoints Living On Peanut Planet. They Are Like
Guardian Angels. Mr.Nutz Can Catch Them And Carry Them With Him In His
Pockets. You Start With 4 Pockets And There's One Additional Pocket On Each
Continent. 

Gems:  You Can Collect Gems And Exchange Them Against Hitpoints, Bombs And
Stars At The End Of Each Level. On Hitpoint Costs 25 Gems, One Bomb Costs 50
Gems, A Star Costs 99 Gems. 

1Up:  This An Extra Life. They Are Well Hidden Within The Levels. 

Heart:  A Heart Brings Back All Your Hitpoints. 

Green Shield:  The Green Shield Will Protect You Until An Enemy Hits
You. Then You're On Your Own Again. 

Red Shield:  The Red Shield Will Protect Mr.Nutz For A While. Just Before The
Protection Runs Out The Shield Will Start To Flash. 

Bomb:  You Can Use Bombs To Blow Up Rocks That Block Your Way While The Map
Is Active. You Will Get A Bomb If You Have Collected More Than 50 Gems At
The End Of The A Level. Sometimes Bombs Can Be Found In Hidden Bonus
Chambers. 

Stars:  Many Of The Animals Want Mr.Nutz To Give Them Stars. With Stars You
Can Buy Trips To The Clouds And To The Warp Zone  Amongst Other Things!

The Four Continents Of Peanut Planet

Nature World: The Adventure Starts In The Nature World With The Chickens
First Bases. They Are Well Designed And Guarded As The Chickens Want To Defeat 
Mr.Nutz As Early As Possible. They Want To Keep Him Under Control. Be
Careful;  The Chickens Know How To Do Great Damage With Their Eggs And They
Often Hide Behind Bushes And Try To Attack Mr.Nutz With The Element Of
Surprise. Try Not To Miss Any Special Flowers As Often There Are Valuable
Treasures Inside. 

Underground World: This Is The Next World Mr.Nutz Has To Liberate. It's Even
More Dangerous Than The First One Because All The Defeated Chickens From
Nature World Are Here. The Chickens Have Filled The Bases With Highly Lethal
Acid. If You Fall Into It You Must Jump Back Out As Quickly As Possible. The
Old Caves Are Full Of Ghosts And According To Some Rumours There Are Even
Giant Fire-Breathing Dragons Down There. Mr.Nutz Has To Destroy Chests And
Chandeliers In Order To Find All The Valuable Treasures. 

Water World: The Most Important Thing When Arriving At Water World Is To Get
Diving Goggles, Because All Chickens Bases Are Underwater. Mr.Nutz Will Get
Short Of Air Without Them. Down Here There Are Many Sawfishes, Spiky Sea
Urchins, Slimy Worms And, Of Course, Chickens Protectimng Themselves With
Helmets. Mr.Nutz Can Use The Currents To Move Quickly Though The Bases. Once
He Has Got Caught Up In Such A Current It Is Very Difficult To Leave It. The
Chickens Of The Water World Have Hidden Their Most Valuable Treasures In
Antique Vases And Pillars. 

Incaworld:  The Last World And Also More Dangerous. There Are Traps And
Spears Around Every Corner. Rolling Rocks And Subterranean Lava Streams With
Exploding Fireballs Are The Ultimate Test Of Mr.Nutz's Skills. The Chickens
Here Have Hidden There Treasures In Old Totem Poles, Carved Out Of Cherry
Wood. 

Things To Do,  Places To Go

Warp Zone: People On Peanut Planet Love To Travel Into Space. Sometimes There 
Are Ghosts On The Map Offering Trips To The Warp Zone And When You Buy Such
A Trip It Will Give You The Chance Of Exploiting The Enormous Treasures To
Space. Once You're Far Enough Away From The Planet You'll See Mr.Nutz In The
Middle Of The Screen. You Can Turn Yourself By Means Of Pressing The Joystick 
To The Left Or To The Right. On The Left You Can Read Important Information. 
Right At The Top There Is A Hour-Glass, And The Numbers Below
Show How Many Seconds Remain. Below That You Can See If Your Current Speed
Is High Or Low And You Can See How Many Seconds It Will Take For You To
Drop Back To Normal Speed. The Next Display Shows How Many Rubies (Red) And
Diamonds (Grey-Blue) You Have Collected. A Big Gem Has The Same Value As
Three Small Ones. There Are Several Useful But Also Dangerous Items You Can
Collect. They Influence The Time Limit Or Speed: 

Hour-Glass:  Increases The Remaining Time By 10 Seconds. 

Anit Hour-Glass:  Decreases The Remaining Time By 10 Seconds. 

Wings:  Increases Your Speed During The Next 15 Seconds. 

Anti Wings:  Decreases Your Speed During The Next 15 Seconds. 

From Time To Time An Arrow Appears On The Screen. This Arrow Shows The Way
To One Of The Four Exits. Each Of These Exits Will Bring Mr.Nutz To A
Different Place On The Planet's Surface And Some Of Them Will Even Bring
Him To Unexplored Islands. If Time Gets Short And You Think That You Have
Collected Enough Treasures, You Should Try And Find An Exit. Always Fly To
The Same Direction As The Arrow. If You're Close To An Exit The Arrow Will
Start To Rotate. Press The Fire Button To Use This Exit. When You Leave, You
Can Exchange Your Treasures. One Hitpoint Costs 25 Gems, One Bomb Costs 50
Gems, A Star Costs 99 Gems. If You Don't Reach An Exit Within The Time Limit
You Will Be Thrown Back To Where You Came From. The Clouds The Clouds Are 
Even More Fashionable Than The Warp Zone. You Can Buy A Ticket From Many 
Ghosts On The Map. The Most Important Thing Is To Follow The Signs - The 
Arrows Show The Way To The Exit. There Are Chickens Flying Up There, Some Of 
Them Carrying Pennants. They Burst Whenever You Jump Between Two Of Them. 
If There Are No Chickens Left By The Time You Reach The Exit, You Will Get 
One Continue. 

The Tunnel

The Tunnel Connects The Vacuum Machine To The Sentry's Space Ship. In The
Middle Of The Screen There's Mr.Nutz, Whilst The Walls Of The Tunnel Can Be
Seen Above And Below Him. Pushing The Joystick Up Or Down Controls Mr.Nutz
Flight, Pushing The Fire Button Will Accelerate Him. On Your Way To The Exit
From The Tunnel You Will Find Several Bonus Items And There Are Arrows
Showing The Way To The Exit. 

Tricks And Hints

* There Are Secret Rooms And Passageways In Every Level. There You Can Find
Gems, Shields, Extra Lifes, Hitpoints. Hearts And Bombs. 

* If You See Something Interesting And You Have No Idea How To Reach It, You
Should Try To Find Permeable Walls Or Platforms That Could Bring You There. 

* It Is Possible To Use The Speed And Momentum Of The Platform You're
Currently Riding On. Be Careful: If The Platform Stops It's Too Late. 

* You Can Use The Hills For A Similar Trick: If You Jump After Running Up A
Hill, You'll Jump Higher. 

* Flying Is Better Than Jumping, Of Course. If You're Good At Flying, You'll
See More Of The Game. There Are Bonus Rooms That Can Only Be Reached By
Means Of Flying. (Visit The Levels Of Nature World To Practice. ) 

* Once You Have Learned How To Fly You Should Try To Defeat Your Enemies 
While You're Airborne. During A Flight Yoou Can Defeat Them With One Of Your
Hit Of Your Fists. 

* All Enemies Can Be Used To Jump On And You Can Then Jump Even Higher By
Pressing The Fire Button. This Often Allows You To Reach Platforms Far
Above. 

Some Enemies Are So Clumsy That They Hurt Themselves When Trying To Attack
You. If You're Skilful Enough You Will Be Able To Cause Wasps To Bumb
Against Walls, For Example.
