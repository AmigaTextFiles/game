            AddBuffers(V1.3,2.x,3.x in C:)

PaRt OnE

            NAME 

            AddBuffers - Increase the sector cache for system 
        disk drives.

            SYNOPSIS

            AddBuffers DRIVE/A BUFFERS/A D2 B2 D3 B3 D4 B4

            DESCRIPTION

            This command increases the number of disk buffers 
        used by the system for disk drive access. By increasing 
        the number of buffers, you can reduce disk access time at 
        the cost of losing memory to the sector cache (exactly 
        512 kilo-bytes per buffer). The buffers specified are 
        used for a specific drive, and do not affect the 
        performance of the other drives in the system.

            Commodore recommends not using more than 25-30 
        buffers with the standard filesystem, because more than 
        this does not improve system performance by much.  With 
        the new FastFileSystem (and a hard drive), more buffers 
        may increase performance, so more than 30 may be used to 
        good effect if you have the memory.

            Starting with version 1.3 of AddBuffers allows you to 
        set buffers for up to four disk drives with a single 
        command line.

            The default number of buffers are 5 for floppy and 30 
        for hard drives.

            Those formatting using the Fast File System (2.x and 
        above) will always benefit from more disk buffers. More 
        likely than not, the buffers are allocated during the 
        partitioning, and it is stored in the Rigid Disk Blocks 
        (RDB).

            With buffer space more information will be read from 
        the disk into memory, thereby making disk searches and 
        transfers much quicker. So, you are sacrificing memory 
        for programs in exchange for quicker disk access.


            For 2.x and 3.x ONLY: You can use this command to 
        find out how many buffers are assigned to a drive. You 
        can also subtract buffers to free up some memory.



            EXAMPLE
          1. To add 15 buffers to the sector cache for drive df0 
        do:

             AddBuffers DF0: 15

          2. To add 10 more buffers to df0:, and 20 to hard drive 
        dh0:

             AddBuffers DF0: 10 dh0: 20



		   For 2.x and 3.x ONLY:
          3. To subtract 10 buffers from df0:, and 20 to hard 
        drive dh0:

		     AddBuffers DF0: -10 dh0: -20

          4. To Return the numbers of buffers assigned to df0:

			 AddBuffers DF0:






		AddDataTypes (3.x Only in C:)


	NAME
            AddDataTypes - Adds additional data types after 
        booting.

	SYNOPSIS
		AddDataTypes {files} [Quiet] [Refresh]

	DESCRIPTION
            This command is used to support the object oriented 
        Data Type process used by MultiView. All data files that 
        are processed by multiview are passed to system-standard 
        libraries for that kind of data (for instance, a .gif is 
        sent to a system-standard library that is coded for 
        .gif). In order to be passed to a system-standard library 
        (all of which are located in L: directory).  If a library 
        is added after boot-time, it can be used immediatly with 
        the help of this command. This save you the hassle from 
        having to reboot after adding new datatypes.

    EXAMPLES
		
            1. To add a gif displayer for multiview

			AddDataTypes sys:Devs/Datatypes/GIF 

            2. To add a gif datatype without printing any output 
        to the screen (useful in writing scripts)

			AddDataTypes sys:Devs/Datatypes/GIF Quiet	

            3. To scan the DEVS:DataTypes for new or updated 
        entries
	
			AddDataTypes AddDataTypes Refresh



			
			Alias (1.x,2.x,3.x Internal Command)

	NAME
            Alias - Create short names for longer command 
        strings.

	SYNOPSIS
		Alias [alias [string] ]

	DESCRIPTION
            This command lets you make short names (aliases) for 
        longer command strings. When a word is typed on the CLI, 
        AmigaDOS will subsitute a longer string for it. This 
        longer string may also contain arguments as well as 
        commands. It can also display a list of alias 
        assignments.

            For an alias to become global it MUST be entered in 
        the s:shell-startup script. Otherwise, it can only be 
        used by the shell that created it or through the NewCLI 
        command called from the same shell it was created.

	EXAMPLES

            1. To shorten the Delete command to DL

			Alias DL Delete

            2. To copy df0: to df1: using cop

			Alias cop Sys:System/Diskcopy df0: to df1:

            3. To copy an entire directory (empty or not)

			Alias cp copy [] ALL
			(When you type  cp directory 
				it gets expanded to:
		    	 copy directory All






                    Ask(V1.3 in C:) (v 2.x & 3.x internal)



     NAME
          Ask - Query user interactively.

     SYNOPSIS
          Ask Prompt WARN OK TIMEOUT

     DESCRIPTION
            Ask is a program that allows you to get a simple form 
        of input from a user.  It is most useful in Execute 
        scripts.

            You may specify a Prompt string, which will be 
        displayed to the user, and you may also specify a string 
        to match on for both YES and NO responses, as well as 
        specifying a time limit on the users response in seconds.  
        All of these strings have default values, the default for 
        the WARN string is 'Y', the default for the OK string is 
        'N', and the default for the Prompt is a single question 
        mark.

            If the user enters a string which matches the WARN 
        string, Ask will exit with a return code that will cause 
        an IF WARN statement to succeed.  If the user enters a 
        string which matches the OK string, exceeds the value 
        given in TIMEOUT, or simply hits RETURN then Ask will 
        exit with a ZERO return, suitable for the ELSE portion of 
        such an IF statement.

            More simply: A 'yes' returns a 5. A 'no' returns a 0.

            If the user enters a string other than those 
        specified in WARN and OK, then ASK will redisplay the 
        prompt, urging the user to give a better answer.

     EXAMPLE
            Here is an example of an Ask command which will 
        return a WARNING if the user types "Amiga", and an OK if 
        the user types "BigBlue", or waits longer than 10 seconds 
        to respond:

          Ask "Amiga or BigBlue?" "Amiga" "BigBlue" Timeout 10
          IF WARN  ; typed amiga!
          Echo "Obviously a person of quality"
          ELSE ; typed big blue? or couldn't decide
          Echo "You seem to be misguided"
          ENDIF






                 Assign(V1.3, 2.x, 3.x in C:)



     NAME
            Assign - Binds a device name to a directory or file.

     SYNOPSIS
		1.3
          Assign Name Dir Etc/... LIST EXISTS REMOVE
	
    	2.x/3.x
    	  Assign Name Dir Etc/... LIST EXISTS DISMOUNT
			DEFER PATH ADD REMOVE VOLS DIRS DEVICES

     DESCRIPTION
            Assign causes NAME: to be a synonym for a directory 
        or a pathname.  This is referred to as a "logical" 
        device, since it appears to the Amiga and the user as a 
        device, but is in fact a directory. You can use this as a 
        convenient shorthand to refer to lengthy pathnames, or to 
        refer to a variety of different directories by the same 
        name (just change the assignment when you want the 
        program to change directories).
          
            You can remove assignments by giving only NAME:, or 
        by giving a single minus ('-') as the directory or device 
        name.  There are also specifice keywords to remove 
        assigns which will be covered later. In any case, all 
        assigns are lost when the system is shut off or rebooted.	

            In 2.x/3.x you can assign a single device name to 
        many directories by simply listing all of the directories 
        after the device name.

            S:, L:, C:, FONTS:, DEVS:, LIBS:, T:, and SYS: are 
        all made during normal startups. All these assigns 
        directly relate with system operation. Therefor, they 
        should not be tampered with for any reason.

            If there is already a directory with an assignment, 
        any new assignment will replace it. You cannot, however, 
        assign the same name to a device that already exists. So 
        an assign to device Work: if a disk whose name Work: is 
        already mounted. 
          


     OPTIONS
          LIST 
            Lists the current assignments. Under 1.3, if you 
        specify a single already assigned name on the command 
        line with LIST, it will be removed from the device list. 
        Under 2.x/ 3.x you can either make or remove assignments 
        along with listing them.

          EXISTS
            Takes a logical device name as an argument.  If the 
        name exists, the device name and its assignment are 
        displayed.  If the name does not exist, then the 
        condition flag is set to WARN (return flag 5).  This will 
        cause an IF WARN batch file statement to succeed.

          REMOVE
            For 1.3: Takes a logical device name as an argument, 
        and removes it from the device list.  This is useful 
        largely to individuals writing handlers, careless use of 
        this option can easily crash the Amiga. It will not, 
        however free up the memory that was taken up with the 
        assign.
				
            For 2.x/3.x: It can be used to delete one directory 
        from a list of assigns. Opposite of ADD (see below).

		  DISMOUNT
            2.X/3.X ONLY: Used exactly like the REMOVE keyword 
        for 1.3 to remove a device from a list of mounted 
        devices.

		  DEFER
            2.x/3.x Only: Postpones the assign until a command 
        tries to access that device. Defer will not throw out an 
        error if it searches for a directory and it does not 
        exist.
        

          PATH
            2.x/3.x Only: This expands on the DEFER keyword. 
        Whereas DEFER eventually binds the assign, PATH keeps the 
        assign non-binding.  Not only will it wait for a command 
        to access that device, but it will reevaluate the assign 
        every other time that device is requested for. (NB: This 
        is very convenient if you are a floppy only user. You 
        will not have to replace the Workbench each time FONTS: 
        is requested. Instead, you can insert different floppy 
        named fonts: each time that device is scanned for.)

            PATH will not accept multi directory assigns.

          ADD
            2.x/3.x Only: Let's you add new directories to an 
        existing assign.  For instance, if you assign a device 
        that is alread assigned you will lose your old assign. If 
        you use the ADD keyword, you will add the new assign to 
        the old assign.

          VOLS
		  DIRS
		  DEVICES
            2.x/3.x Only: Limits the information that is 
        displayed when you list your assigns. VOLS shows you only 
        which volumes are assigned, DIRS shows you only which 
        directories are assigned. DEVICES shows you only which 
        devices are assigned. If none of these keywords are used 
        then all three kind of information are displayed.
          
     CAUTIONS
            Random or careless assignments of the Amiga's 
        pre-assigned devices can cause mass confusion.

            Random or careless use of the REMOVE option can cause 
        a GURU.

     SEE ALSO
          Execute

     EXAMPLES
  
        1.
             ASSIGN DICTIONARY: df1:usr/lib/dictionary

            DICTIONARY: may now be used as a synonym for the 
        complete path df1:usr/lib/dictionary. If a program uses 
        the logical device DICTIONARY: rather than a hardcoded 
        directory name, then changing the DICTIONARY: assignment 
        will change the dictionary that the program will use.

            Assign allows a practically infinite number of 
        assignments or deletions to be made on one command line.  
        You may remove an assignment by using a minus '-' sign 
        instead of a logical directory or filename to subtract 
        this assignment from the device list.

        2. To return all the assignments made to your system 
        just enter:

			Assign
		  
        3. 1.3 Only:

            To assign POOF: to the disk in DF0:, remove the 
        assignments for PUF: and DUF: and assigns CRUFT: to HD0:.

            ASSIGN POOF: DF0: PUF: - DUF: - CRUFT: HD0:


        4.2.x/3.x Only:

		  To assign multiple paths to one device:

			Assign Music: Work:DeliTracker/Mods Work:OctaMed/Meds 


		  To assign Fonts: to df0:Fonts only when a program tries to
		  access Fonts:

			Assign Fonts: Df0:Fonts DEFER









           Avail(V1.3, 2.x,3.x in C:)



     NAME
          Avail - Report memory statistics.

     SYNOPSIS
          1.3
          Avail CHIP/s FAST/s TOTAL/s
 
		  2.x/3.x	
          Avail CHIP/s FAST/s TOTAL/s FLUSH/s

     DESCRIPTION
            Avail reports on the amount of memory available in 
        the system, its type, how much of each type is in use and 
        is free, and the largest single block of memory of each 
        type (also known as contiguous memory).
          
            This command is useful with shell scripts to 
        determine if there is enough memory available to load a 
        program, file or graphic before you actually perform the 
        load.

     OPTIONS
          CHIP 
            Reports the total amount of free chip memory

          FAST 
            Reports the total amount of free fast memory

          TOTAL
            Reports the total of all free memory, both fast and 
        chip.

          FLUSH
            2.x/3.x Only: This option will force all unused 
        devices, libraries and other resources out of the system, 
        which gives the most accurate report of available memory.  
        This will free you as much memory as possible by killing 
        all information in your memory not being used by any 
        program. This is useful to kill off all the resedue of 
        processes that exited but did not give you all your 
        memory back.

     EXAMPLES
		 1. To get all available system ram:

			Avail

         2. Show only Fast Memory

			Avail Fast



              BackTick (2.x/3.x ONLY) (CLI Function)


        NAME
 
            BackTick- Allows you to include the text output of 
        one command to be the input of another command.

        SYNOPSIS
            SomeCLICommand `AnotherCommand`

        DESCRIPTION
            This is a new and important feature of 2.x/3.x. 
        BackTick lets you insert the text output of one command 
        to be the input of another command. For instance, if you 
        wanted to print the contents of the Work:ESCOM directory 
        with an informative header you would type this:

            ECHO >prt: "The directories in work are:" `Dir 
        Work:ESCOM`

            It's a good idea to know where this key is, so I'll 
        tell you. It is the key right above the Tab key. The 
        unshifted version of that key is the BackTick (`), the 
        shifted version is the Tilde (~).  If you try to use the 
        parenthesis key (') your command will fail. There is a 
        difference between those two keys even though they look 
        similar on the screen.

            The backtick command always evaluates itself at the 
        time it is issued. If you wish to have the backtick 
        command evaluated after several other commands have been 
        issued you must place the asterix (*) escape character 
        before each backtick.

            For instance, lets say you want to create an alias 
        which displays the contents of the Gould:Loser directory. 
        You would type:

Alias grovel Echo "Contents of the Loser directory is: *`dir Gould:Loser*`

            Now, whenever you want to see what is in that 
        directory you merely type 'grovel' and it will be shown.  
        But, if you don't include the asterixes then any changes 
        made to the Gould:Loser directory will not be reflected. 
        You will only see what was in that directory when the 
        Alias was first made.

            With some experimentation you will find this DOS 
        function to be one of the most useful.






              BaseName(V1.3- arp component))



     NAME
            BaseName - Display the Base (filename) of a pathname.

     SYNOPSIS
          BaseName Path/a Suffix

     DESCRIPTION
            Basename extracts the filename from a long pathname, 
        displaying it to the standard output.  You can also give 
        BaseName a suffix to delete.  The most common use for 
        BaseName is in scripts, where it is used to generate new 
        filenames from old.  This command is most useful with a 
        shell that supports command substitution and piping.

     EXAMPLE
            BaseName "DF0:Scoobie/Doobie/Foobar"
            Foobar

            BaseName "DF0:Scoobie/Doobie/Foobar.c" .c
            Foobar


     OTHER
            This command is new with V1.3 of Arp, it is not 
        available with the Commodore distribution.

            It has been replaced by several internal calls in 
        v2.x/3.x.




			Binddrivers (1.3,2.x,3.x) (location: C)



	NAME
            Binddrivers - Mounts device drivers residing in your 
        Expansion Drawer.

	SYNOPSIS
		Binddrivers

	DESCRIPTION
            Locates device drivers reisiding in the Expansion 
        drawer of your Workbench: disk. It then activates those 
        drivers for use. This is useful to add devices to your 
        system harddrives that are not mounted by the operating 
        system.

            You will also find binddrivers in your 
        startup-sequence.  This way, it can mount any external 
        devices during startup. If you don't have a device in 
        your expansion drawer or if you want those devices 
        mounted when you are ready for them, then you can remove 
        this command from your startup-sequence.

            NB: This is not part of 1.2.

	EXAMPLE

            1. To load the device drivers in the Expansion 
        directory of sys:

		Binddrivers
	
	





      Break(V1.3, 2.x, 3.x: internal command)



     NAME
          Break - Send a signal to a background process.

     SYNOPSIS
          Break Process=T=Task/a A=ALL/s C/s D/s E/s F/s 

     DESCRIPTION
            Many programs which run from the CLI will respond to 
        the typing of one of the control characters C D E or F. 
        By far the most common is control-C which usually causes 
        a process to terminate.  If you execute a task in the 
        background (by using Run or ARun), you will not be able 
        to send it a break signal from the keyboard, and that is 
        where Break comes in.  Once you know the CLI number of 
        the process you wish to signal (available immediately 
        after you run the process or by using the Status 
        program), you can send one of these control signals to 
        the background process. It simulates selecting a CLI 
        process with the mouse and pressing the specified 
        CTRL-key keystrokes.

            You may trigger up to four breaks at a time.

     EXAMPLE
            1. To send a control C to background process number 
        2:

          Break 2 C or Break 2 (Break defaults to control C)

            2. To send ALL control signals to background process 
        number 3: 

          Break 3 C D E F or Break 3 ALL

            3. 2.x/3.x Only: To signal a break to a program 
        running under the WAIT command:

		  Break 'STATUS Com=Wait'

     CONSIDERATIONS
          Not all programs respond to break requests.

     CD(V1.3 in C:) (2.x/3.x Internal)



     NAME
          CD - Report or change the current directory.

     SYNOPSIS
          CD Dir ROOT

     DESCRIPTION
            CD when given a valid directory name, makes that 
        directory the current or default working directory. To 
        display the current directory, type CD without any 
        arguments.

            It's also supplied with the switch ROOT. By using 
        ROOT in place of an actual directory name, an assignment 
        to the root of the filing system will be made. This is 
        the device you booted from, rather than a specific disk.  
        For example, if you booted from Drive Df0:, CD ROOT will 
        permanently assign your directory to any disk in drive 
        Df0:.

            It also has a simple pattern matching capability.  
        You may use a wildcard specification as an argument to 
        CD, CD will make the first directory it finds that 
        matches the pattern the current directory. Pattern 
        matching is utilized with the Amiga wildcards).

            You can also move up one directory by using multiple 
        slashes (/). For instance, if the current directory is: 
        Work:Art/AGA by typing CD // you will change to the Work: 
        directory. 

            2.x/3.x only: You can also change directories by 
        simply typing the path name at the shell prompt. The CD 
        command is only needed if there are any spaces in the 
        path name. In this case you must place the entire path in 
        quotes.

            NB: AmigaDOS handles default drives unlike any other 
        personal computer. Let's say you insert a disk named 
        Stuff: in df0: and type CD df0:. Then, you remove the 
        disk and insert a disk named Things: and type dir df0:, 
        you will be requested to insert Stuff: in df0:.  To get 
        around this, merely type Cd df0: whenever a new disk is 
        inserted. This makes your Amiga read the new volume label 
        and it forgets all about the old disk.

         

      EXAMPLE
          1. To change directory to df0:libs

              CD DF0:LIBS
          
          2. To report current directory

              CD 


          3. To make any disk in Drive 0 the current directory

               CD ROOT  


	      4. To change back to your root directory (2.x/3/x only)

               CD :      


          5. To move back up two directories (2.x/3.x only)    

               CD //

     ChangeTaskPri(V1.3,2.x,3.x) Location: C:)    


     NAME
            ChangeTaskPri - Change a tasks execution priority.

     SYNOPSIS
            ChangeTaskPri P=Pri,T=TASK=PROCESS

     DESCRIPTION
            By increasing/decreasing the priority of various 
        tasks in the system, you can increase/decrease the amount 
        of CPU time each task is allocated.  The ARP version of 
        this command checks the value of your priority, and also 
        allows you to change task priorities of currently running 
        tasks.  This should be performed with care.  If no task 
        number is entered, this command uses the currently 
        executing task.

            If executed with no arguments, ChangeTaskPri will 
        return the priority of the currently executing process.  
        This is useful in shell scripts.

            Your Amiga's operating system was created where each 
        task that is running gets assigned a priority from -128 
        to 127. The processor asses this number and prioritises 
        the tasks. The higher the number the more processing time 
        will be alloted to it by the processor.

            WARNING: Never raise a task priority higher than 5 or 
        less than -5. If you raise it above 5 you will override 
        important system tasks such as the input handler (which 
        checks the keyboard and the mouse). If the priority is 
        below -5 it will be completely shut out of the CPU by the 
        most trivial of instruction.

     EXAMPLE
         
            1. To change task 3's priority to -5

        ChangeTaskPri -5 Process 3 
				                                   
            2. To Change current CLI's priority

          ChangeTaskPri 5 


            3.  2.x/3.x ONLY: To utilize the backtick feature to 
        change the priority of the C:CONCLIP task to 5

           ChangeTaskPri 5 Process 'Status com=c:conclip'






     Cmp(V1.3 ARP Only)               


     NAME
          Cmp - Compare files and report differences.

     SYNOPSIS
          Cmp From With FULL QUICK ALL

     DESCRIPTION
            Use Cmp to display differences between binary or text 
        files.  When comparing single files, the return code will 
        be set to WARN if the files do not match. This is useful 
        in scripts with IF statements.  The return code on 
        complex pattern matches with more than one file will 
        always be zero. When specifying directories as either the 
        From or With arguments, you may use a dot which means 
        "current directory".

            You can use either C-e (Control E) or C-f (Control F) 
        to abort the comparison of the current files and move on 
        to the next.  This is most useful with multiple input 
        files and the FULL (see below) option.  As usual, a C-c 
        (Control C) will abort the program all together.

     INPUT FILES
            You can specify the file or files to be compared 
        quite easily and naturally with Cmp using simple 
        pathnames or wildcard patterns or even directory names. 
        When you specify wildcards and/or directories to be 
        compared, Cmp will compare files with the same names in 
        each directory.  Cmp will not abort if it cannot find the 
        second file, it will simply print an informative message 
        and go on to the next file.  If you need to compare files 
        with different names, then you must specify each name in 
        full as the With name and the From name.  A more detailed 
        explanation follows:

            If From is a file, then With may be either a 
        directory or another file.  If a directory is supplied, 
        then Cmp looks for a file with the same name as the From 
        file in that directory:

            So, to a compare File with RAD:Dir/File2 

              Cmp File RAD:dir/File2  


            And to compare File with DirName/File

              Cmp File DirName   


            You may also use a wildcard pattern as the From file.  
        In this case, the With name must be a directory.  Cmp 
        expands the wildcard specification and tries to find 
        files with that name in the With directory:

            Cmp File RAD:Foo/$?.c DF0:c


            Finally, you can also use two directory names as the 
        From and With specification. This will compare all the 
        files of the same name in the From directory with all the 
        files of the same name in the With directory:

            Cmp Dir1 Dir2


      OPTIONS
          FULL 
            This will display all points at which the two files 
        differ.  The display is of the form "Offset: Byte1 Byte2" 
        where Offset is in decimal and Byte1 Byte2 are in hex. 
        Use C-e or C-f to move to the next file in the series, or 
        C-c to abort.

          QUICK
            The QUICK option will check to see if the two files 
        appear to be identical, by first comparing the date 
        stamps and file lengths, and if these are the same the 
        file comparison is skipped saving some time.

          ALL
            If there are subdirectories within the directories 
        you are comparing, the ALL switch will force Cmp to 
        recursively descend these directories, comparing files as 
        appropriate.

     NOTE
            This command is new with V1.3 of ARP, it is not 
        available with the Commodore distribution.



		CONCLIP (2.X/3.X only)  (location: C:)


	NAME
            Conclip- Directs console device to use the clipboard 
        for cutting-and-pasting. 

	SYNOPSIS
		CONCLIP [UNIT clipnum] [OFF]

	DESCRIPTION
            By default, the Amiga's console device only uses its 
        own internal buffer for copying and pasting. This command 
        directs the console device to use the clipboard for its 
        copying and pasting.

            Copy-and-Paste lets you copy a block of text from a 
        console window by drag-selecting it with the mouse then 
        pressing RightAmiga-C. You can then paste this into 
        another console window by activating that console and 
        pressing the RightAMiga- V. 

            Conclip not only lets you paste into other consoles 
        but also into the window of any other application which 
        supports the clipboard. 

            It's an extremely good idea to make sure it is in 
        your Startup-Sequence. This way, you will not have to 
        worry about it.

            Note: Conclip requires the iffparse.library to be in 
        your LIBS: drawer and the clipboard.device file to be in 
        your DEVS: drawer.

	KEYWORDS
		UNIT
            Lets you specify the device unit number from 0 to 
        255.  This designates the clipboard device number you 
        wish to paste to. You do not have to add the word 'UNIT', 
        you can merely specify the number.

		OFF
            Lets you turn off the clipboard device for that 
        console.  There is really no need to do this as it will 
        never effect the operation of anything else.

	EXAMPLES

            1. To direct the console to use the clipboard to 
        copy-and-paste:

			Conclip

            2. To change the clipboard unit number used by the 
        console device to unit 3:

			Conclip 3

            (By the way, the console device is utilized to accept 
        keyboard and mouse strokes and print them to the screen. 
        The output goes to a console window. The CLI has its very 
        own console window.)






            Copy(V1.3,2.x,3.x) (in the C: directory))



     NAME
          Copy - Copy files.

     SYNOPSIS
          Copy From To ALL QUIET BUF=BUFFER CLONE DATES
               NOPRO COM FLAGS QUICK

     DESCRIPTION
            COPY duplicates the contents of the file or files (if 
        wildcards or a directory is given) of its FROM argument 
        to the file or directory specified in its TO argument, 
        overwriting any existing file or files of the same names.

     FILE SPECIFICATION
            The From argument may be a file, a directory or a 
        wildcard pattern.  You can use a dot '.' as either the 
        From or To directory to indicate the current directory. 
        Double quotes "" can be used  to refer to the current 
        directory.

            If you copy a file, you may give that file the same 
        name or a different name as the original. If the 
        destination has the same name as the original then the 
        new copy will replace it.

            Copy can duplicate many copies of a file to the same 
        directory if dirrerent names are used. It can also 
        duplicate files to many different directories.

            If the From argument is a directory or a pattern, the 
        To argument is assumed to be a directory or destination 
        replacement pattern.  If the directory specified in the 
        To argument does not exist, it will be created for you.

            If you include wildcard characters in the To 
        argument, these are taken to be a request to use a 
        pattern substitution for the destination filename.  The 
        expected syntax is:

          <optional_prefix>|<optional_postfix>

            You may specify neither, one, or both of these 
        optional tags.  If you exceed the length of an AmigaDOS 
        filename (30 characters as of this writing) the name will 
        be silently truncated.  You can also indicate which 
        portion of the From filename you want to be replaced by 
        using the wildcard characters in the source pattern.  The 
        rule followed is that any constant (i.e., non-wildcarded) 
        portion of the source pattern is discarded.  As an 
        example, the command:

             Copy l#? start#?end

            will copy all files beginning with an 'l'.  The 
        destination names these will be copied to will be formed 
        by removing the 'l', and sticking 'start' on the front, 
        and 'end' on the back.  So, for example, the file 'LXXX' 
        would be copied to the file 'startXXXend'. If the start 
        or end patterns are omitted, these are regarded as null 
        strings.

            In 1.3 you CANNOT use wildcards for Directory names, 
        only file names. 2.x/3.x allows this.

            1.3 will not let you copy a file to a directory that 
        does not exist. In 2.x/3.x COPY will create a directory 
        if one does not exist.

            If you copy a file to the same directory it cannot 
        have a file with that same name of the protection bit is 
        set on the file being copied to. 

            The from statement is not needed as long as the 
        source and target files are in the appropriate order. If 
        the orders are changed (Copy To filename FROM filename), 
        the FROM is required.

            If you don't specify a directory, but the TO keyword 
        is used, then the current directory is copied to the 
        destination.  For instance, COPY TO Work: will copy the 
        entire contents of the current directory to Work:.
		  
            Devices such as PRT: and SPEAK: can be designated as 
        the destination of any file being copied.

            2.x/3.x Only: You can chose multiple FROM files as 
        well as multiple TO files. 


     OPTIONS
          ALL 
            Copies ALL the files from the source directory to the 
        destination directory or device.  This will recursively 
        descend all subdirectories found in the From directory, 
        and create them (if they do not already exist) in the To 
        directory.  Without this switch, only the first level of 
        the directory hierarchy will be duplicated.

          QUIET
            Performs a Copy without reporting what it is doing.  
        This is useful for doing copies in the background, when 
        you do not wish to be disturbed by informative messages.  
        Note that errors will still be reported.

          BUF=BUFFER
            This allows you to specify the number of 512 byte 
        buffers used during the copy. Unlike the Commodore Copy, 
        which uses a fixed number of buffers if this option is 
        not specified (currently, 200 buffers), the ARP Copy sets 
        its internal buffer size intelligently as a function of 
        how much memory your system contains and the size of the 
        file to be copied.  Using this option overrides this 
        intelligent behavior.

          CLONE
            This instructs Copy to duplicate the date, comments 
        and protection bits (except the archive bit) of the 
        original file.  The default is to Copy only the 
        protection bits. (also see Environment, below).  This is 
        the same as using both the DATE and COM keywords.

          DATE
            This option instructs Copy to duplicate the datestamp 
        (also see Environment, below).

          NOPRO
            By default, Copy duplicates the protection bits of 
        the file(s) (except the archive bit).  Using this option 
        will override this behavior, and cause the file to be 
        created with the current system default protection (also 
        see Environment, below).

          COM  
            This forces Copy to duplicate the comment for the 
        file.  The default is not to duplicate the comment (also 
        see Environment, below).

          QUICK
            This ARP addition is a highly useful option which 
        will duplicate files only if the destination file does 
        not exist or is not the same. Copy uses the Datestamp, 
        Filesize, Protect bits, and also the Filenote (but only 
        if you have enabled copying filenotes) to determine 
        whether or not the file is the same. Since a byte by byte 
        compare is not done, it is possible to fool Copy.  
        However, in normal operation of the Amiga, this 
        dramatically speeds up Copies between directories and is 
        perfectly safe (also see Environment, below).

          FLAGS

            You can override the current setting of your 
        environment flags using this keyword.  Any option 
        specified on the command line overrides the default 
        settings specified by the copyflags environment variable. 
        This keyword takes a string of the same type used for the 
        copyflags variable.  For a discussion of these flags, see 
        Environment, below.

		  NOREQ

            Normally, whenever you try to copy to a directory 
        that does not exist a requestor will pop up asking you to 
        insert it.  If you do not want that little requestor, 
        then use this keyword. This is useful for when you want 
        to write a script for someone else who does not have a 
        device you want to try to copy to (such as a printer or a 
        speech device- speech devices were removed from the 
        Workbench with 2.0). 

     ENVIRONMENT
            If you prefer a behavior for copy other than the 
        default, you can specify this behavior permanently by 
        setting a value for the copyflags environment variable.  
        This variable takes a string of characters composed of 
        the following:

          N    Always copy filenotes (see COM, above).

          C    Always copy original datestamp (see DATES, above).

          Q    Always copy QUICK (see QUICK, above).

          P    Never copy protection flags (see NOPRO, above).

          O    This flag does not correspond to any command line
               arguments.  When this flag is set, Copy will only
               duplicate files which already exist in the destination
               directory, it stands for 'OLD', and essentially
               performs an update operation.  This is extremely useful
               when trying to update old software with new software.

            These flags can be overridden by using a command line 
        option, or by using the FLAGS keyword to specify new 
        ones.  Note also that case is not significant.  You can 
        set the copyflags variable using Set, SetEnv, or directly 
        from the command line if you are using the Shell instead
        of the CLI.

             Set copyflags=CQ
             SetEnv copyflags=CQ
             copyflags=CQ		; This only works in ASH

            The settings shown above is perhaps the most common: 
        it enables copying datestamps, protection bits, and the 
        QUICK option.

     EXAMPLE
            1. To perform an update from one directory to another 
        without using copyflags, use:

          Copy NewDir OldDir FLAGS=O

          
            2. To copy a file called TheFile to OtherFile in the 
        same dir:

          Copy TheFile Otherfile
			or
		  Copy TheFile to Otherfile
		    or
		  Copy To Otherfile From TheFile


		    3. To copy all the files from Df0: to Work:

		  Copy Work: df0:


            4. To copy all files and subdirectories from df0: to 
        Work:

		  Copy Df0: Work: ALL


            5. Copy all the files in the current directory to 
        Ram:

          Copy "" Ram:

		
            6. To Copy a file called Dudes in the current 
        directory to a file with the same name to a directory 
        called :WildWest/Cowboys, which is on the same disk:

          Copy Dudes :WildWest/Cowboys


            7. To Copy selected files from the current directory 
        to the Stuff: directory.

		  Copy "" (ThisFile|ThatFile|AnyFile|PickaFile) Stuff:

            Noinstcache ExternalCache NoExternalCache CopyBack 
            NoCopyBack:

            These are used to control the cache features of all 
        Motorola processors over 68010. These higher end 
        processors all have higher end instruction caches, which 
        stores processes inside the CPU itself. This allows those 
        internal functions to perform lightening fast because 
        they are inherant to the CPU and do not have to be 
        retrieved from memory. Instcache/NoInstcache turns these 
        functions on or off. 

            The 68030 & 68040 have a data cache in addition to 
        the instruction cache. These allow data to be retried 
        from memory in one grand instruction, thereby lowering 
        your CPU's overhead. DATACACHE / NODATACACHE turns this 
        on or off.

            CACHE / NOCACHE can turn on or off all the caches. In 
        1.3 caches are off by default and should be turned on 
        with the CPU command in your startup-sequence. 2.x/3.x 
        has them turned on as a default. 

            Some older programs (games mostly) that have problems 
        running with the higher end processors. These problems 
        may sometimes be solved by turning all the caches off.

            2.1 has added the CopyBack and NoCopyBack flags. 
        These help you manage the datacache on the 68040 which 
        does not automatically update the cache as changes are 
        made to the data. By default, this is off because it 
        conflicts with too many programs to be of any use.

            In addition to internal caches, there are also 
        external caches which can be turned on or off with the 
        ExternalCache or NoExternalCache flags.
			


            Burst NoBurst InstBurst NoInstburst
			DataBurst NoDataBurst:

            If your Amiga's memory is configured to accept a 
        special processor mode which feeds data at a superduper 
        fast speed you can utilize the Burst mode. 

            InstBurst and NoInstBurst turn on or off the 
        instruction mode in databursts.

            DataBurst and NoDataBurst turn on or off the data 
        mode in databursts.

            Burst and NoBurst control both the instruction and 
        data modes.



			Trap/NoTrap:

            This is a programmer's debugging flag. These will set 
        or clear the memory access trap which warns you if your 
        program is trying to access the lower 256 bytes of memory 
        or any memory above the 16 megabyte address (this 16 
        megabye hit is only noticed in the 68000 processor, 68010 
        and above allow higher end memory to be addressed).

            This illegal entry information is sent via the serial 
        port.  To use this function there must be a 9600 bps 
        terminal hooked up to your serial port as well as the 
        higher end processor.


			FastROM / NoFastROM:
            The 68000 processor is a 32-bit processor that is 
        accessed 16-bits at a time. If you add an accelerator 
        that has a full 32-bit processor and an MMU, you can 
        remap the kickstart into that 32-bit RAM and the MMU will 
        make it appear as though that is where the Kickstart 
        really lives. The FastROM command moves the ROM image 
        there, while the NoFastROM removes it from that area.

			
			NoMMUTest:

            Lets you remap kickstart to 32-bit ram without 
        actually checking to see if it is being used. This is a 
        function of the MMU (Memory Management Unit).

			
			Check 68010|68020|68030|68040|68881|68882|FPU|MMU

            This is used to check for the existence of why type 
        of processor or co-processor you have installed. For 
        example, if you type: "CPU Check 68000" and you have a 
        68000 installed, it will return a 1. If you have any 
        other processor installed a 0 will be returned.


	EXAMPLE

            1. To turn off the instruction cache, turn the data 
        cache of, and move the Kickstart ROM image to protected 
        32-bit memory:

            Date(V1.3, 2.x, 3.x) (Locatin C:))             


     NAME
            DATE - Set or display the system date.

     SYNOPSIS
          DATE Date Time TO=VER/k

     DESCRIPTION
            Date is used to set the systems idea of the current 
        date and time, or to display the systems idea of the 
        current date and time.

            To display the current system time simply use Date 
        with no arguments.  You may specify a TO or verification 
        file to send the date to, if no TO file is specified, the 
        date is displayed in the current window.

            To set the time you use the format HH:MM:SS where H 
        stands for hours, M stands for minutes, and S stands for 
        seconds.  Leading zeroes are optional for all versions 
        except 1.2.  1.2 requires that you include a leading zero 
        before the 10th month.

            Both the display of the date and the setting of the 
        date are determined by the 1.3 environment variable 
        'dateformat'. Under 2.x/3.x it is stored simply as 
        'name'. This veriable can be a file or an actual device 
        such as a printer. This determines one of several 
        international formats for displaying and setting the 
        date. If 'dateformat' is not set or if its value is zero, 
        the AmigaDOS format is used.  Here is a list of the legal 
        values for dateformat, and the corresponding input and 
        output formats:

            0    This is the default AmigaDOS format, DD-MMM-YY 
                 is used for both input and output.  Note that 
                 if datetime is undefined, or the value is 
                 illegal, this will be the default option.

            1    International format, YY-MM-DD is the format.

            2    USA format, MM-DD-YY is the format.

            3    Canadian format, DD-MM-YY is the format.

            Note that dateformat controls the format for the 
        input string as well as the output display.  You never 
        have to enter leading zeros, and you may always use words 
        like SATURDAY, YESTERDAY, TOMORROW, etc.

            Saturday, Sunday, Monday, and the rest of the days of 
        the week can be used as flags. The system will evaluate 
        the day then advance the system date to match the 
        specified day of the week. So, if it is Monday and you 
        specify Thursday, the system clock will advance by three 
        days.

            FOR 1.3 Only:  SETCLOCK is used in the 
        startup-sequence to automatically read the system's 
        hardware clock (if present).  The A1000 and A500 did not 
        come with a clock installed.  Therefor, AmigaDOS would 
        check the boot disk for the date of most recent file and 
        sets the system date according to that.  The Date command 
        is then used to set the proper date and time.  This was 
        lost anytime you rebooted the computer or utilized the 
        SETCLOCK SAVE command.

            FOR 2.x/3.x: The clock is read automatically by the 
        system without utilizing the SETCLOCK command. Therefor, 
        you will never see it listed anywhere.



     EXAMPLES
            1. To use default AmigaDOS format.

                 SET dateformat=0   

            2. To set the date, using AmigaDOS format

                 Date 1-jan-88  


            3. To set the date to the next day's date and the 
        time to 12:00

                  Date Tomorrow 12:00 







              Delete(V1.3, 2.x, 3.x...in C: directory))



     NAME
          Delete - Delete any number of files or directories.

     SYNOPSIS
          Delete Files ALL Q=QUIET A=ASK

     DESCRIPTION
            Under 1.3 you can only delete up to ten files or 
        directories with a single Delete command. Wildcards are 
        acceptable.
		  
            Under 2.x/3.x you can specify any number of files to 
        delete on the command line, and you can also use wildcard 
        patterns for any or all of these files.

     OPTIONS
          ALL 
            By default, you can only Delete empty directories.  
        If you wish to Delete a directory and everything it 
        contains, you can specify this option on the command 
        line.  Note that directories may contain other 
        directories, which themselves may contain directories or 
        files: This option will delete that entire branch of the 
        directory tree, including these additional directories 
        and files.

          Q=QUIET
            If you use the ALL switch, or if you specify wildcard 
        patterns, Delete displays a message with each file that 
        it deletes.  This option causes Delete to do its work 
        silently, though error messages are still reported.

          A=ASK
            This enters interactive mode, where Delete will 
        display the name of the file to Delete, and prompt you 
        with a question mark.  If you answer 'Y' or 'y', and then 
        press return, the file will be deleted.  Any other answer 
        will preserve the file.  Used with the ALL switch, ASK 
        will ask you if you wish to enter any directories it 
        encounters in its search. Again, typing a 'Y' or 'y' will 
        enter these directories, any other character will proceed 
        to the next entry in the current directory.

		  FORCE
            If the 'd' protection bit is set for a file or 
        directory then that file is protected from deletion. But, 
        by using the FORCE keyword, any file will be deleted 
        including the ones that are 'protected'.


     EXAMPLE
            1. Delete all files in the current directory

                 Delete #?


            2.  Ask about deleting each file and directory in the 
        current directory, and each subdirectory and file.

                  Delete #? ASK ALL

       
            3.  Deletes all files in the directory which start 
        with this or that.

           		  Delete (This|that)#?






            Dir(V1.3, 2.x/3.x) (located in the C: directory)



     NAME
            Dir - Pretty display of files and directories.

     SYNOPSIS
            DIR Dir OPT [ADFHIS] SIZE INTER HILITE FILES DIRS ALL

     DESCRIPTION
            Dir by itself displays any files and directories in 
        the current directory.  By default, Dir will display any 
        subdirectories, one per line, and then any files, in two 
        columns, in sorted order.  Directories are followed by 
        the string "(dir)".

            You can specify an alternate directory to display as 
        an argument, and you may also use wildcards.  If you use 
        wildcards, Dir will display all files that match that 
        wildcard pattern.  If it encounters a directory during 
        the course of its search for matching patterns, it will 
        display the name of the directory, and also its contents.

     OPTIONS
          OPT 
            This flag along with a single letter can represent 
        the option you desire, or you may use the clearer keyword 
        equivalents supplied.  The options and their keyword 
        equivalents are described below:

		  SIZE or OPT S
            This ARP option displays the names of the files and 
        their sizes in two columns on the display device.  If a 
        directory is encountered, it is identified as usual with 
        a "(dir)".

          HILITE or OPT H
            This ARP option enables pretty printing of Dirs 
        output.  All directory names will be displayed in inverse 
        video.

          FILES or OPT F
            This displays only files, any directories found will 
        will not be displayed.

          DIRS or OPT D
            This displays only directories, any files found will 
        not be displayed.

          ALL or Opt A
            This option displays the complete contents of that 
        branch of the directory tree.  As Dir descends a level, 
        the indentation is increased to make the organization of 
        the disk clearer to the eye.  You may use some of the 
        other options or keywords along with ALL to generate the 
        display you need.

          INTER or OPT I
            This allows interactive file browsing through a 
        directory or a disk.  Using this option, you will be 
        presented with a file or directory name, followed by a 
        question mark. You can find out what additional options 
        are available to you at this point by typing another 
        question mark '?', and pressing return.  These are:

          B=BACK
            Moves backwards, up the directory tree.  If you are 
        at the top, this will exit the listing.

          DEL=DELETE
            This will delete the current file.

          E=ENTER
            This will enter a directory.  Note that you must be 
        at a directory entry in order for this option to be 
        valid.

          Q=QUIT
            This will quit Dir.

          T=TYPE
            This will type the current file.

          C=COM
            This takes any command as an argument, and sends it 
        to a subshell.  Any shell command can be used here, 
        including the IO Redirection operators (<, >, and >>).  
        If you do not specify a command as an argument, you will 
        be prompted for one.

     EXAMPLES
            1. To get a listing of all directories on drive DF1:

             DIR DF1: ALL DIRS
             or
             DIR DF1: OPT AD

            2. To get a listing of all directories and files and 
        the sizes of the files on drive df0:, as well as 
        displaying the directories in inverse video do:

             DIR DF1: ALL SIZES HILITE
             or
             DF1: OPT ASH






            DiskChange(V1.3, 2.x, 3.x) (located C:))



     NAME
            DiskChange - Inform AmigaDOS that a 5 1/4 disk has 
        been changed.

     SYNOPSIS
          DiskChange Dev

     DESCRIPTION
            5 1/4 inch disk drives do not detect when there has 
        been a disk swap, and therefore cannot inform AmigaDOS.  
        After changing disks in the 5 1/4 inch disk drive, you 
        must issue this command. You will also need to do this if 
        you make a change to the disk's name using Relabel and 
        you want the Workbench to hear about it.

            Note that DiskChange may also be useful with other 
        types of media, such as removable media hard disks, or if 
        you are running FFS on floppy drives.


	 EXAMPLE
            1. To inform AmigaDOS that you have changed a disk in 
        an external 5 1/4 inch drive.

	            Diskchange df1:

            2. To inform AmigaDOS that you have changed a disk in 
        an external 5 1/4 inch disk drive that is mounted right 
        behind a 3 1/2 inch external drive:

                Diskchange df2:





            DiskCopy (1.2 in C: Directory) (1.3, 2.x, 3.x 
        internal)


	NAME
            Diskcopy - Copies entire diskettes.

	SYNOPSIS
		DiskCopy FROM (source drive) TO (Destination drive)
			NAME (VolumeName) VERIFY MULTI


            Other computer systems require you to format a disk 
        before you make copies of old data. The Amiga lets you 
        copy to a disk that has information already stored on it. 
        All that old information will be lost though. This lets 
        you make backups of all important disk while helping you 
        dispose of files that you no longer use.

            DiskCopy is very useful because it takes just as much 
        time to format a blank disk as it does to perform a 
        diskcopy. But, if you only have a few files you wish to 
        copy, it may be quicker to just delete the files on the 
        destination disk you don't need using the delete command 
        then using the Copy command to transfer the ones you 
        want.

            DiskCopy can also be used devices of different types. 
        For instance you can copy between Ram: and Rad:. Or, df2: 
        and Ram. But, for it to work with Rad:, Rad: must contain 
        the same number of tracks (80) and blocks per track (11) 
        as a floppy device.


	KEYWORDS
	
	FROM
            This is the source, or the device you are copying 
        from.  If you only have one disk drive, this will be df0: 
        or the actual name of the disk mounted there (eg 
        MyDisk:). It can also be df1:, df2:, df3:, or df4: (if 
        you actually have these optional drives). OR, it can be 
        the RAD: or RAM: drive as stated before. Remember you 
        RAD: must be created in the same nature as a regular disk 
        drive for this to work.

	TO
		This is the desitination, or the device you are copying
	to. If you have only one diskdrive the copy may take quite
	a few disk swaps. This is because the contents of the source
	disk gets buffered into ram: before getting transferred to 
	the destination disk. If you have an original 256K A1000,
	this may take up to eight swaps. If you have an unexpanded
	A500, you're looking at about three swaps. If you have one
	meg of ram, you should not need to swap more than once.
	If you have two diskdrives you are the lucky one. This is
	because you will not have to make any swaps either because
	the data is passed straight through between the drives.

		If you have 1.3 the TO keyword is mandetory! The command
	will not function without it. But, under 2.x/3.x you do not
	need to put this keyword.

	NAME
		This is the name you are giving to the new copy. If you
	don't give a name, then the new volume will have the same
	name as the original. Despite the names being the same,
	there is some 'hidden' information on the disk which will
	distinguish the two disks from each other. 


	When diskcopy is stared, and the disks are being copied
	a neat little status bar opens up on your window showing
	you the progress as all 80 tracks are copied. YOu can
	cancel this process at any time by hitting 	the control
	break keys: Ctrl-C and then Return. If you hit these keys
	after the copying has already started, all information on
	the destination disk will be lost. The destination disk
	will also be rendered useless until it is formatted or
	diskcopied again.

	NOVERIFY
		As AmigaDOS copies a disk, it verifies each sector
	after it formats it. If you don't want AmigaDOS to check
	its steps, then use this keyword.

		There is no point in using this keyword. It is better
	to be safe than sorry. And a few seconds of time spent
	verifying your copying will save you tons of hearache later.

	MULTI
		Lets you load the entire disk into memory (if there is
	at least 880k of free memory). You can then insert as many
	destination disks as you want making multiple copies. The
	system will prompt you when it is ready for the next disk.


	EXAMPLES

	1. To make a copy from df0: to df1:

	Diskcopy from df0: to df1:   ; for any version of AmigaDOS.

	Diskcopy from df0: df1:		 ; for 2.x/3.x only

	Diskcopy df0: df1:    		 ; for 2.x/3.x only





            DiskDoctor (V 1.3 and 2.04. Omitted after 2.04) (in 
        C: directory)


    NAME
            DiskDoctor - Reconstructs the file structure of 
        corrupted disks.

	SYNOPSIS
		DiskDoctor (drivename)

	DESCRIPTION
            This can be described in two words: it sucks. It is 
        useless.  It has no purpose on any computer. That is why 
        it was removed after 2.04. 

            The concept was to repair directory and file 
        structures that were destroyed for any number of reasons. 
        These reasons can be anything from removing the disk 
        while it is still being accessed to a nuclear explosion. 
        When any type of magnetism comes in contact with your 
        floppy the data is scrambled and AmigaDOS can't read 
        anything there. You will get a variety of errors such as 
        'Volume is not validated', 'Not a DOS disk', 'Disk is 
        unreadable', or the ever so present 'Checksum Error' if 
        such damage occured. 

            Diskdoctor attempts to correct the damaged data on 
        the disk and save as much of it as it can.  DiskDoctor 
        can only attempt to repair FFS disks if the DEVS: 
        Mountlist is set to 0x444F5301 under the DOSTYPE keyword. 

            DiskDoctor is quite reckless when it repairs your 
        disk. You see, after it retrieves what data it can 
        salvage overwriting other information that may still be 
        used on the disk. It does this over- writing 
        indescriminatly without recognition of importance or 
        existence. 

            Therefor, if you ever use DiskDoctor, make sure you 
        are trying to repair a copy of your disk.  There is no 
        reason to use this when there are so many fabulous 
        disksalvage programs. The most notible is DiskSalv 
        created by David Haynie (former Commodore engineer and 
        all around Amiga Demi-God).  His program along with the 
        many other USEFUL salvage programs that actually work are 
        listed in the 'Replacements' selection of this reference 
        program. Quarterback Tools (no longer being developed) 
        and AmiBack Tools by Intelligent Designs are both running 
        close second to DiskSalv. 


    EXAMPLES

            I'M NOT GIVING ANY. THIS PROGRAM IS TOO STUPID AND 
        USELESS TO EVEN ACKNOWLEDGE IT WITH AN EXAMPLE.



            




                  Echo(V1.3 in C:) (2.x/3.x internal))



     NAME
            Echo - Echo a string to the terminal.

     SYNOPSIS
          Echo [string] NOLINE FIRST LEN

     DESCRIPTION
            Echo displays its argument to the current output, 
        this can be the printer, a file or the terminal. Echo is 
        typically used in scripts, but it can also be used (and 
        useful) to send escape sequences to things like printers.
	
            2.x/3.x only: You can use echo to output a file to 
        the environment. This is shown in the example below.


            Note that with the added keywords, you MUST use 
        double quotes to delimit a line to echo under 1.3. Under 
        2.x/3.x you don't need the quotes ONLY if it appears last 
        on the command line. 

            If you want to add a line feed, use the *N character. 
        But, if you use this option in either 1.3, 2.x, or 3.x 
        then quotes must be used.

     OPTIONS

          NOLINE
            This suppresses the newline which Echo automatically 
        adds at the end of its argument. This is useful in that 
        it allows you to build a single line of text using the 
        output of two or more commands.

          FIRST
            This option takes a numeric argument, which indicates 
        which character position to begin output at. Any 
        character before FIRST will not be displayed. This is 
        useful with LEN (see below).

          LEN 
            This option takes a numeric argument, which indicates 
        how many characters to output.  If you also supply a 
        FIRST argument (see above), character output will begin 
        with that character, for LEN characters. If LEN is used 
        without the FIRST keyword, then the final LEN characters 
        will be displayed.

     EXAMPLES

            1. To display "Hello World" on the terminal.

          Echo "Hello World!"

            2. To advance the printer paper, and displays Hello 
        World! on the printer. Note that you must have set your 
        escape character to \ for this example to work.

          Echo >PRT: "\FHello World!" 

            3. To display "ello World!".

          Echo First 2 "Hello World!" 


            4. To display "rld!".

          Echo Len 4 "Hello World!"


            5. To display "World!".

          Echo First 7 Len 6 "Hello World!" 

            6. To print the text file Ram:This.text to your 
        screen.

          Echo Ram:This.text





            Ed (1.3, 2.x, 3.x located in C:)


	SYNOPSIS
            The Amiga's built in full-screen text editor.
        
            Ed is a complete text editor. Due to the huge scope 
        of the available commands you should consult your Amiga 
        System manual on how to exactly use Ed.

            If enough people contact me to include a full 
        tutorial in DOSMan, I will write one.
		

            FORMAT
		1.3:
			ED FROM (name) [SIZE (numchars)]

		2.x/3.x:
			ED [FROM] name] [SIZE numchars] [WITH comfile] 
			   [TABS interval] [WINDOW device] [WIDTH columns]
			   [HEIGHT rows]

	

	KEYWORDS
		FROM
			This is the name of the file you wish to edit.
		If the file does not exist, Ed will create it. This keyword
	    is optional as long as it is the first arguement in the
		Ed statement.

		SIZE
			This sets the size of the buffer which ED uses. If
		this is the second arguement in the command line, then
		the keyword is optional, you only need to type the number.
		SIZE defaults to 40,000 bytes. If your buffer is not big
		enough to hold the file you are editing, then you will
		get a warning message informing you of this from Ed.

		WITH
			2.x/3.x Only: This lets you make an Ed command file
		to execute automatically. This is a command file that
		contains a list of extended instructions for Ed that
		will execute when the file is run. This exists in the 
		form of a script. See your Amiga's manual on how to set
		up this command script.			

		TABS
			2.x/3.x Only: This lets you set how many spaces will
	    be skipped when	you hit the Tab key. The default Tab is
	    three spaces.

		WINDOW, WIDTH, HEIGHT
			2.x/3.x Only: The combination of these three commands
		would allow you to open Ed on a remote terminal. Window
		lets you specify this device (for example, AUX:). The
		Width and Height lets you set the demensions of the new
		window.

			2.x/3.x Only: You can also edit binary files, not just
		plain ASCI text.

	EXAMPLE

            1. To edit a text file called ThisText in the 
        Work:TextFiles directory.

			Ed Work:TextFiles/ThisText


            2. To edit a really big file of 75,000 kbytes in the 
        Work:TextFiles

			Ed Work:TextFiles/ReallyBig.txt SIZE 80000





		EDIT (1.3, 2.x, 3.x) (Located in the C: Directory)

	SYNOPSIS
		An AmigaDOS line editor.

	FORMAT
            EDIT [FROM] fromname [TO] toname [WITH] withname 
        [VER] vername [OPT W chars or WIDTH chars] [OPT P lines 
        or PREVIOUS lines]



	EXPLANATION 

            Unless you grew up with UNIX and really dig line 
        editors you should really try a different program (even 
        Ed) before you dive into Edit. 


            What does set Edit apart from Ed (and most other text 
        editors) is that it is able to edit binary files and it 
        can execute a predefined list of line editor commands.

            Please note that starting with version 2 of Ed you 
        can do the same thing, so there is really no need to keep 
        both of these programs hanging around on your system 
        disk.

	
	KEYWORDS

		FROM
            EDIT requires the FROM keyword. This will tell EDIT 
        which file to edit. This filename must exist. EDIT will 
        not create the file for you like Ed will.

		TO
            This will tell edit where to save the file to once 
        you decide to finish. If this is the second command in 
        your arguement, you do not need the TO keyword.
	
            EDIT is limited in the fact that it will not 
        overwrite a file that already exists. If the TO filename 
        is the same as the FROM filename then instead of 
        overwriting the FROM filename it will be save the 
        original as :t/edit.backup. The file you are working on 
        then gets named and saved as the FROM filename.

		WITH
            This specifies a file which will be used as input to 
        EDIT's command options. The contents of WITH must be a 
        series of valid options for it to work.  If WITH is the 
        third argument in an EDIT command line, the keyword is 
        optional. If you don't use this keyword you must manually 
        input your parameters.

            Due to the huge scope of available commands you 
        should consult your Amiga System manual on how to 
        configure EDIT. 

            If there is enough of an interest I will write a full 
        tutorial on how to configure EDIT.

		VER
            This lets you specify where to send the output of 
        EDIT to. You can send the output to any logical device 
        including PRT: to print it.

		OPT W  or WIDTH
		OPT P  or PREVIOUS
            This lets you set the actual physical size of EDIT. 
        WIDTH lets you set the actual line length.  PREVIOUS lets 
        you designate how many lines will be kept in EDIT's 
        history buffer. 

            The default for line length is 120 characters and the 
        default history buffer is 40 lines. If you multiply the 
        WIDTH by the PREVIOUS you will get the exact amount of 
        RAM you need to reserve as a work buffer. This amount can 
        be set with the STACK command. 

            If you set the OPT W and OPT P options, you must use 
        the OPT keyword with the W or P letters.



	EXAMPLES

            1. To edit a file called MyText in the default 
        directory:

		EDIT MyText

            2. To edit a file called MyText and to save it under 
        a file called YourText that is 5000 lines long:

		EDIT FROM MyText TO YourText OPT P5000

            3. To edit a file called MyText and to use the editor 
        commands located in the edit.prefs file (which you 
        created earlier). The data will then be saved as 
        YourText. And, to send all the messages and verifications 
        from EDIT to your printer while setting the number of 
        lines to 50 and a line width as 175:

		EDIT FROM MyText TO YourText WITH edit.prefs VER
			PRT: OPT W175 OPT P50

             Else (1.3 in C:) (2.x/3.x internal)



     NAME
          Else - FALSE clause of IF conditional.

     SYNOPSIS
          Else

     DESCRIPTION
            Else is used in combination with IF to perform 
        conditional testing.  If the IF conditional fails, 
        control will be passed to the commands following the 
        ELSE.  If the IF conditional succeeds, then the commands 
        following the ELSE (up to the concluding ENDIF) will be 
        skipped.

            Note that Workbench 2.x and above contains a builtin 
        version of this command.  The 1.3 of Else cannot be 
        executed outside of a script, while the 2.x/3.x version 
        of Else can be executed inside or out of a script file.

     SEE ALSO
          IF ENDIF Execute





           EndCLI (V1.3 in C:) (2.x/3.x internal)



     NAME
          EndCLI - Terminate a CLI or Shell.

     SYNOPSIS
          EndCLI

     DESCRIPTION
            EndCLI causes a shell process to terminate.  The 
        shell will shutdown, freeing all of its resources and 
        closing its window (if it is interactive).

            Note that if another program is still using the 
        console for a CLI, you may not be able to close a console 
        CLI window even after running ENDCLI until you terminate 
        that command.  This is most likely to occur if you have 
        "RUN" some command from the CLI and it is still executing 
        when you try to EndCLI.

            2.x/3.x Shell contains this command as a builtin. 
        Also, you can press the CTRL-\ or click on the close 
        button to exit your shell.

     SEE ALSO
          NewCLI NewSHELL






             EndIf(V1.3 in C:) (v 2.x/3.x internal)



     NAME
          EndIf - Show end of IF ELSE Conditional.

     SYNOPSIS
          EndIf

     DESCRIPTION
            This is used to mark the end of a conditional block 
        in a script. Note that in 2.x/3.x this command is 
        builtin.

            If the tested condition proves false then all 
        commands after ELSE and before ENDIF are executed. If the 
        tested condition is true, then all commands after the IF 
        and before the ELSE keywords are executed.

     SEE ALSO
          IF ELSE Execute





			ENDSHELL  (1.3: Alias) (2.x/3.x Internal)


	NAME
            ENDSHELL - Exactly like ENDCLI except it can close 
        the CLI or Shell window.

	SYNOPSIS
		ENDSHELL

	DESCRIPTION
            This terminates the CLI or Shell window just like the 
        ENDCLI command does. 

            Under 1.3 this command does not actually exist.  It 
        is created in the startup-sequence with the Alias 
        command. But, it acts exactly like ENDCLI.

	SEE ALSO
		ENDCLI







               EndSkip(V1.3 in C:) (2.x/3.x internal)



     NAME
          EndSkip - Unconditionally abort a SKIP in progress.

     SYNOPSIS
          EndSkip

     DESCRIPTION
            If EndSkip is encountered after executing a Skip 
        command in a Script, the Skip will be aborted, and the 
        fail level will be set to WARN.

            Note that in 2.x and 3.x this command is builtin.

     SEE ALSO
          Execute Skip Lab






                   Eval(V1.3, 2.x, and 3.x in C:)



     NAME
            Eval - evaluate arithmetic and logical expressions.

     SYNOPSIS
            Eval Value1/a Op Value2 TO/k L=LFORMAT/k

     DESCRIPTION
            Eval computes the results of simple arithmetic and 
        logical expressions as applied to two arguments, and 
        displays the result on its standard output. Numeric 
        arguments may be input as:

          Decimal
            This is the default, no extra qualifiers needed.

          Hexadecimal
            Enter hexadecimal numbers as 0x<number> or 
        #x<number>, for example:  0x1A or #x1A.

          Octal
            Enter octal numbers as 0<number> or #<number>, for 
        example: 0777 or #777.

          Binary
            Binary numbers (in ARP eval only) may be entered with 
        #B, for example:  B1111

          Character
            Characters are supported only by the Commodore Eval.

          The operations supported are given below:

          addition        +         not                    ~
          subtraction     -         left shift            <<
          multiplication  *         right shift           >>
          division        /         negation               -
          mod            mod        exclusive or          xor
          and             &         bitwise equivalence   eqv
          or              |

            Any fractional amounts that result from this process 
        are discarded.

     OPTIONS
          TO  
            You can send the output of Eval to a file which is 
        indicated in the path with this keyword.

          L=LFORMAT
            You can control the output format of Eval using this 
        keyword. 

            There are four formats you specify: hexadecimal (%X) 
        Octal (%O), Decimal (%N), or ASCII (%C). The hex and 
        octal formats require a number after the letter to 
        indicate how many letters you want to print.	For 
        example, to display a hexadecimal number in a field of 8, 
        you can do LFORMAT="%08lx".  You can also include escape 
        characters (such as *n for a newline) inside your LFORMAT 
        string.  For this release of Eval, you also need to 
        always use the 'l' (for long) format character with all 
        format commands.  The default is set to Decimal. 
			
            You can also include any text you desire in the 
        format string by using quotes. For example:

				LFORMAT = "There are %N widgets sold."
     EXAMPLE
         
            1. To find the sum of 2 + 2 and print the answer as 2 
        octal digits followed by a new line character.

			EVAL 2 + 2 LFORMAT = "%O2*N"







             Execute(V1.3, 2.x, and 3.x in C:)



     NAME
            Execute - Cause the shell to execute commands from a 
        file.

     SYNOPSIS
            Execute [Filename] [ARGS...]

     DESCRIPTION
            Execute causes the shell or CLI to read the commands 
        from the filename specified as Execute's input argument.  
        When the end of the file is reached, control returns to 
        the keyboard.  You can force the Shell to abort any 
        script file processing by typing a C-d (Control D) 
        sequence while the script is being executed.

            You can even include nest an Execute inside your 
        script to cause one script to call another one during its 
        execution.

            In AmigaDOS 1.3 and above, you can execute a script 
        without typing EXECUTE and just typing name of the script 
        if the 'S' bit is set.

         
	 KEYWORDS
		  FILENAME
            The name of the script to execute.

		  ARGS
            Any arguments to be passed to the file. These may be 
        any valid AmigaDOS string (including filenames and all 
        sorts of devices.	

     DIRECTIVES
            Execute recognizes several special commands known as 
        Directives.  Each of these Directives begins with a DOT 
        '.', but this character can be redefined if needed.  
        Execute is reasonably flexible in allowing you to 
        redefine its special characters, which is quite 
        fortunate, as you will soon see.

            In order for Execute to recognize these directives, 
        the DOT character must be placed at the beginning of the 
        line, and the directive name must follow immediately, 
        with no intervening whitespace.  You can also use the DOT 
        (again, at the beginning of a line only) to introduce a 
        comment. This usage is ".<whitespace>Anything" where 
        whitespace is any of space, tab or newline.

            Many of these directives deal with passing arguments 
        to scripts and establishing defaults for arguments.  
        These are described below:

     .KEY and PARAMETERS
            The .KEY directive (which may be abbreviated as .K) 
        is used to declare the names of parameters which will be 
        used in the course of the script file. Note that these 
        are not environment variables.  If you intend to pass 
        arguments to a script file, it is wise to use this 
        directive as the first line of a file. If the first 
        non-empty line (i.e., a line which contains anything 
        other than a newline) does not contain a dot command 
        (directive), then the arguments will not be processed.

            The .KEY directive accepts any legal template.  These 
        are the same kinds of templates you see all the time in 
        the AmigaDOS commands. Note that currently, there is no 
        support for multiargs (the /... template type) in 
        scripts, and so you should not use this in your 
        templates.  All the usual processing associated with 
        templates is active in scripts, including the '?' display 
        of the template, and position independent arguments.

            When you use the .KEY directive, Execute matches up 
        the users arguments with your template keywords, and if 
        no error occurred, scans the file for any items 
        surrounded with the BRA KET characters.  These are 
        initially '<' and '>', which is quite unfortunate, since 
        these tend to conflict with the IO redirection operators.  
        It is wise to change these to another character using the 
        .BRA and .KET operators (see below).

            When a BRAKET sequence is encountered, Execute 
        replaces the keyword inside the BRAKET with the users 
        argument.  If the user did not enter an argument for that 
        keyword, and there is no default setting for this 
        keyword, then Execute removes the argument all together, 
        resulting in a NULL string.  Arguments that do not take 
        an argument, for example, switches (template type /S), 
        are handled somewhat differently.  If the user supplied 
        the switch on the command line, then the braket sequence 
        is replaced by the actual name of the switch, otherwise, 
        it is null.

     DEFAULT VALUES FOR PARAMETERS
            This assigns the value string to all occurrences of 
        the substitution argument described below.

            You can set default values for your variables in two 
        ways.  The first way is to use the .DEFAULT directive.  
        .DEFAULT (which may be abbreviated as .DEF) takes a 
        template keyword and a default value.  If that keyword 
        does not have a value at the time the .DEFAULT statement 
        is scanned, then Execute binds the value to that keyword.  
        Here is an example of its use:

            .DEFAULT Foobar "Testing123"


            Another way to set default values is by using the 
        DOLLAR (initially each time the parameter is used, it 
        does not set it permanently:

            Echo "<Foobar$Testing123>"

            Note that a .DEFAULT statement will override all 
        following DOLLAR defaults. The decision as to which to 
        use is usually based on how many times you use that 
        parameter.  If you only use it once, then either will do. 
        If you use it many times, then .DEFAULT is probably the 
        simplest.  Also note that there is not a conflict between 
        this use of the DOLLAR and the use of the dollar during 
        Shell environment expansion: The DOLLAR is special to 
        Execute only inside of BRAKETS, and the shell expands the 
        environment variables only after Execute has parsed the 
        file.  Unless you use environment variables inside of 
        BRAKETs, there should be no need to change your .DOLLAR 
        character.

            You can also use a double DOLLAR inside of brackets. 
        This will be replaced by the current CLI number.

     CHANGING THE META CHARACTERS
            The following directives are used to change the 
        default meta characters used by Execute.  Each take a 
        single character as their argument.

          .BRA and .KET
            These change the bracket characters (initially '<' 
        and '>', respectively) to something else.  It is highly 
        recommended you make a habit of doing this, whether you 
        think you need to or not.  Good characters to use instead 
        are the curly braces ('{' '}') since these are not needed 
        for anything else, currently.

          .DOT 
            This changes the DOT character (initially '.').

          .DOL or .DOLLAR
            This changes the DOLLAR character (initially '$').

     MISCELLANEOUS
            Execute may be nested, i.e., you may include Execute 
        commands in scripts, which can also contain Execute 
        commands.

            Execute will sometimes need to write a temporary 
        file.  If you have assigned a directory or device to T:, 
        then this location will be used.  If not, and there is a 
        :T directory for the current directory, then Execute will 
        create the assignment, and use this directory.  
        Otherwise, it will attempt to create both the directory 
        and the assignment in the current directory. EXECUTE uses 
        <$$> with the task number of the CLI from which it is run 
        to create this.

     EXAMPLES

            1. To execute a script named RunThis located on Df0:

			EXECUTE df0:RunThis

            2. Here is an example of a KEY directive which 
        contains a switch.  This illustrates a good way to handle 
        and use /s style arguments in script files.

             .KEY MySwitch/s

             IF "<MySwitch>" EQ "MySwitch"
                Echo "The switch is on!"
             ELSE
                Echo "The switch is off!"
             ENDIF

          If the user doesn't supply MySwitch as an argument on the
          command line, then the comparison will fail (the first
          argument will be ""), otherwise, the comparison will succeed
          (the switch is "on").

           Failat(V1.3 in C:) (2.x, 3.x internal)



     NAME
            Failat - To set a fail level for a batch file.

     SYNOPSIS
            Failat RCLim

     DESCRIPTION
            When using Execute to run scripts, any command that 
        returns an error greater than the current value of the 
        Fail level will cause the shell to abort the script with 
        an error message.  You can use Failat to increase or 
        decrease this level to whatever you need.  The shell will 
        reset the Fail level (usually 5, 10, 20 but can be any 
        number) at the end of every script execution, so scripts 
        always start out in a known state.

            Under 2.x/3.x the result code is stored int the 
        environment variable RC, which is represented by $rc. The 
        bigger the return code, the bigger the error. If the 
        severity of the error is higher than the number you set 
        then the script stops running.

            Once your FAILAT has been run in the script, the 
        FAILAT level returns to 10.

            You can use FAILAT to a very high number and test the 
        return codes that any of your IF statements return.
			
		
     EXAMPLE
            1. To temporarily set the failure level to 30

          Failat 30 

          This now makes it possible to execute commands that return
          error codes greater than 20, which would ordinarily cause
          Execute to stop with an error message.

            2. To display the current failure level threshold.

               Fault(V1.3 in C:) (V2.x/3.x internal)



     NAME
            Fault - translate numeric error codes to ascii text.

     SYNOPSIS
            Fault Fault/...

     DESCRIPTION
            Normally when your Amiga has an error it returns a 
        requestor telling you what you need to do. Many errors do 
        not bother to open up this requestor, only a number (for 
        example, 'Last command failed with error 330). This 
        command accepts numeric those error codes and turns them 
        into system error messages, or if the error code is not 
        defined the numeric code is again displayed.

            Translates all the faults into English-lanuage 
        explanations.

            The CLI and Shells (and many programs) call on Fault 
        to report their errors for them.  

            In 2.x/3.x this fault code is stored into the 
        variable 'result 2'.

            The AmigaDOS command also  does this but may not root 
        out the exact problem. If the AmigaDOS command WHY does 
        not satisfy your quiriosity of what the error was about, 
        then using Fault directly after it will expound on it.
          

      EXAMPLE
            1. To display the error message associated with fault 
        code 220:

			FAULT 220



            2. To display the error messages with fault codes 
        216, 220, and 330:

            FF (ONLY in 1.3) (DOES NOT exist in 2.x/3.x)


	SYNOPSIS
            FF - Speeds up the text display.

	FORMAT
            FF [-O] [-N] [fontname]

	EXPLANATION
            This only exists in 1.3 because 2.x/3.x have fast 
        text routines that are inherit with those systems. If you 
        are using a standard 8x8 or 10x9 font FF will speed up 
        the display of the text on 1.3 machines. 

            Not only that, but you can use FF to replace the 
        format system font as long as it is of the proper size 
        and is fixed width. 2.x/3.x uses the Font Prefrences in 
        the Prefrences drawer to perform this same task.

	
	KEYWORDS

		-O
            This tells FF to speed up the text. It is on by 
        default.

		-N
            This tells FF to turn off the fast text routines and 
        can be turned back on by reissuing the command.

		[fontname]
            This tells FF to replace the system default fonts 
        (TOPAZ80 and TOPAZ60). The font you use to replace it 
        must have the NewFont.font file as well a drawer which is 
        associated with that font file containing the data for 8 
        or 9 size fonts, or both. 

            If you designate a font that does not have those 
        files available, the default Topaz fonts will be used.


	EXAMPLES

            1. To turn on fast text routines:

            FF

               or

            FF -O

            2. To turn on fast text routines while replacing the 
        system fonts with the Neat.font:

          	FF Neat.font






            Filenote(V1.3, 2.x, 3.x in C:)



     NAME
            Filenote - Sets a comment for a file.

     SYNOPSIS
            Filenote [File]filename Comment

     DESCRIPTION
            You can set a comment for a file of up to 79 
        characters using this command.  You can also remove the 
        comment for a file using this command by specifying a 
        null comment string.  Comments may be viewed with the 
        list command.

            When you COPY a file, the note does not get copied 
        with it.  When you RENAME a file, the note stays attached 
        to that file.  If you change the file in any way, except 
        COPYing it, the file note does not get effected. If you 
        add another filenote to a a file that already has one, 
        then the old one gets deleted and the new one replaces 
        it.

            If you LIST a directory, these filenotes are 
        displayed. The notes will appear right below the file 
        name with a : in front of it.  If there is an icon 
        attached to that file, then you can read or a note 
        through that icon's information window.

            These filenotes do not effect the file they are 
        attached to in anyway what so ever.

     KEYWORDS
		FILE filename
			This is the file the note is to be attached to. If this is 
		the first argument in the command string then the FILE keyword is
		optional. 

            1.3 only: Only one file can be annotated at a time.

            2.x/3.x only: Wildcards are completely acceptable. 
        You can also annotate as many files as you like at the 
        same time.


        COMMENT string
			If this is the second argument in the command string then the
		COMMENT keyword is optional. This defines the note that is to be
		attached to it. The string must be enclosed in quotation.

		ALL
			2.x/3.x only: Lets you add the same note to all the files in
		the specified directory and all its subdirectories.

		QUIET
			2.x/3.x only: Does not list the files as the notes are being
		added.

     EXAMPLE
          
            1. To attach a note that says "Here it is!" to your 
        file ThisFile

	      Filenote FILE ThisFile COMMENT "Here it is!" 

            2. To attach a note that says "Don't delete this no 
        matter what!" to the File Important.text

          Filenote Important.text "Don't delete this no matter what!"

            FORMAT (1.3, 2.x, 3.x in SYS:System)

	NAME
            Format- Initializes a disk as being blank.

	SYNOPSIS
            FORMAT DRIVE drivename NAME string NOICONS QUICK FFS

 
	DESCRIPTION
            FORMAT takes a disk and initialises it to make it 
        empty. You can also specify a name for it, but it you 
        don't it will name it 'empty.

            WARNING: All information on the disk will be erased 
        while using this command.

            After typing FORMAT, you are prompted to insert a 
        disk and hit the RETURN key. After you hit RETURN you 
        cannot turn back. It can be interrupted by hitting the 
        CTRL-C and then RETURN. But, some data will be lost.

            As the format occurs, the status of the format is 
        displayed.  Each cylinder number (0-79 for a double 
        density floppy) clicks by on the screen until every 
        cylinder is initialized then verified. After this entire 
        process the volume name is assigned.

            If you are copying one disk to another DISKCOPY is a 
        much faster command. This is because you must first 
        FORMAT, then INSTALL, then COPY ALL the from between the 
        disks. If you are using DISKCOPY all these steps are 
        performed by the DISKCOPY command. 

            The only time the FORMAT-COPY ALL routine is better 
        than the DISKCOPY is when the information on the source 
        disk have been deleted and rewritten so many times that 
        the contents of the disk have become scattered. By 
        formating the disk then copying all the files over, you 
        are consolidating them. By consolidating them you will 
        greatly speed up your disk accessing time. The only time 
        DISKCOPY will be better on a scattered disk is if you 
        optimize the disk first using one of the many optimizing 
        programs available.

    KEYWORDS

		DRIVE drivename
            The drive which contains the disk to be formatted. 
        The valid entries are df0: df1: df2: and df3:. 

            FORMAT can be used on any logical device. These 
        devices include harddrives, recoverable ram drives, or 
        even removable media which is readable/writeable.

            WARNING: Make sure you are typing the write device 
        name.  By typing DH0: instead of DF0: my cause you lose 
        the entire contents of your harddrive when you just 
        wanted to format a floppy disk. 


		NAME string
            This is the name you are giving to the disk you are 
        formatting.  The NAME keyword is absolutly mandatory. The 
        NAME can be up to 31 characters long and if it contains 
        spaces must be contained in quotes.

		NOICONS
            With this keyword prevents the Trashcan from getting 
        created during the format process.

		QUICK
            This keyword makes FORMAT initialize only write over 
        the root-block, the boot block, and the bitmap block, 
        without formating the rest of the disk. This is good to 
        do whenever you are formatting a disk that already has 
        been formated before because it is many times faster. 
        But, this keyword will not work if the disk has never 
        been formatted before.

		FFS
            This keyword forces the disk to be formatted with the 
        Fast File System (FFS). FFS lets you keept much more 
        information on the disk than the OFS (Old File System).  
        WB 1.3 cannot boot from FFS and may have trouble reading 
        them. 2.x/3.x use this by default.


		EXAMPLES

            1. To format a disk in Df1: and naming it My_Disk:

		FORMAT DRIVE df1: NAME My_Disk:


	GET (2.x/3.x Only) (Internal Command)

	
	NAME
            GET - Shows the contents of a local environment 
        variable.

	SYNOPSIS
            GET varname
		
	DESCRIPTION
            A named text string that is stored in an environment 
        space is a local environment variable. It can only be 
        accessed through the shell it was created in or from a 
        shell that was spawned from the shell it was created in.

            OK... so what's the difference between GET and 
        SETENV. Well, SETENV is stored in the RAM disk and is 
        global to all system functions. GET resides in some 
        private (reserved) memory that may only be accessed as 
        described above.

            By placing a dollar sign before the name, you can 
        swap the value of a local environment variable on the 
        command line. In other words, if you type 'ECHO $Peter' 
        you are creating the same local environment variable as 
        GET Peter.

	
	KEYWORDS
		varname  
            This is the name of the environment variable to get. 

            There are many local environment variables which are 
        already created by the 2.x/3.x operating systems. The 
        proper use of these makes AmigaDOS a very flexible and 
        powerful scripting language. The more important and 
        useful of these variables are:

		Process
            The process number of the current Shell

            Echo
            Decides whether or not the Shell will repeat each of 
        the commands as they are executed. If 'SET Echo on', then 
        the commands are repeated and displayed.  Anyother use of 
        Echo will not allow any commands to be repeated. Turning 
        Echo on helps you to debug any scripts that you are 
        having problems with, since there is no other way to tell 
        how they failed. With Echo on, you can tell which line in 
        the script failed to work.

		RC
            The return code of the last command that was 
        executed. You can manipulate this return code instead of 
        using IF WARN or IF FAIL commands structures. This is a 
        more efficient programming algorythm routine.

		Result2
            The error number of why the last command failed. You 
        can use the FAULT and/or WHY commands to try to figure 
        out the exact nature of the error.


	EXAMPLES

            1. To print the contents of an environment variable 
        named StupidMahedi:

         	GET StupidMahedi





               GetEnv(V1.3, 2.x, 3.x)



     NAME
            GetEnv - display value of environment variable.

     SYNOPSIS
            GetEnv Name

     DESCRIPTION
            GetEnv displays the values of Environment variables. 
        These variables are accessible to all tasks (unlike GET 
        which is only accessible to the environment which created 
        it).

            GetEnv searches both the older Environment variables 
        and the new ENV:  handler if it exists. (Note that ENV: 
        is currently just a directory in RAM:, it is not a true 
        handler).

            GetEnv prints the contents of this file.

	 KEYWORDS
		  varname
            The name of the environmental variable to get. This 
        is the name of the file that is found in the ENV: 
        direrectory located in RAM:.           

		  Kickstart/Workbench
		2.x/3.x Only:	
            These are created during startup. They contain the 
        version of your Kickstart and Workbench that is currently 
        being used by your system.

		  Editor
		2.x/3.x Only:
            Some Workbench programs such as MORE are able to 
        recognize the environmental variables. If you set this 
        variable to the pathname of your favorite text editor, 
        then MORE allows you to bring up the program to edit the 
        current file by pressing Shift-E.

     NAME
            IF - Add intelligent branching to scripts.

     SYNOPSIS
            IF NOT WARN ERROR FAIL string1EQstring2 
        string1GTstring2 string1GEstring2 VAL EXISTS
			

     DESCRIPTION
            If the condition tested by IF evaluates to TRUE, then 
        the commands immediately following the IF, up to the 
        following ELSE or ENDIF, are executed. If the condition 
        tested by IF evaluates to FALSE, it moves the execution 
        of the file ahead to the command following the next ELSE 
        command (if there is one), or to ENDIF, if there is no 
        intervening ELSE.

            The ELSE command (if used) must show up between the 
        IF and ENDIF statements.

     CONDITIONS
            Each of the following will evaluate to true or false:

          WARN 
            This will be true if the return code value set by the 
        last command is greater than or equal to 5.

          ERROR
            This will be true if the return code value set by the 
        last command is greater than or equal to 10.

          FAIL
            This will be true if the return code value set by the 
        last command is greater than or equal to 20.  Note that 
        you will have to use a Failat command to raise the 
        default fail limit from 10 to above 20 if you wish to use 
        this test.

          string1EQstring2
            This takes two strings, and will be true if both 
        arguments are the same (i.e., EQUAL).  The default is a 
        string comparison, but see VAL, below. The comparison is 
        not case sensitive. The test can be reversed by using the 
        NOT keyword with it. It can be a numberic comparison if 
        you utilize the VAR keyword. Strings 1 & 2 are normally 
        text, if there are spaces in the strings then quotes must 
        be placed around it. 

            Environmental variables may also substitute a string 
        by using a dollar sign ($) directly before the the 
        variable name (so, $Amount represents the variable 
        Amount).

          string1GEstring2 
            Takes two arguments. This will be true if the first 
        argument is Greater than or Equal to the second argument.  
        This may be combined with NOT (see below) to perform a LT 
        (less than) test. The default comparison is a string 
        compare, use VAL to compare numbers.  Strings 1 & 2 are 
        normally text, if there are spaces in the strings then 
        quotes must be placed around it. 

            Environmental variables may also substitute a string 
        by using a dollar sign ($) directly before the the 
        variable name (so, $Amount represents the variable 
        Amount).

          string1GTstring2
            Takes two arguments. This will be true if the first 
        argument is Greater than the second.  This may be 
        combined with NOT (see below) to construct a LE (less 
        than or equal to) test.  The default comparison is a 
        string compare, but use VAL to compare numbers. Case 
        sensitivity does not matter. Strings 1 & 2 are normally 
        text, if there are spaces in the strings then quotes must 
        be placed around it. 

            Environmental variables may also substitute a string 
        by using a dollar sign ($) directly before the the 
        variable name (so, $Amount represents the variable 
        Amount).

          EXISTS
            This takes one argument, which should be a device, 
        file or directory.  This will be TRUE if the device, file 
        or directory exists. 

     MODIFIERS
            The following options to IF modify the meaning of the 
        above tests:

          NOT  
            Inverts the sense of the test.  This is always used 
        in combination with another keyword. As an example, the 
        line: "If NOT EQ" will be TRUE if the EQ is false. This 
        modifier combines with any of the others.

          VAL 
            This affects the type of compare done by the EQ GT 
        and GE keywords. By default, the comparison is a string 
        compare.  However, if you specify this keyword, the 
        comparison performed is numeric.

            If you don't use the VAL keyword then the string will 
        be compared one numeral at a time from left to right.  
        For instance the string 22 will be shown to be greater 
        than 011 since the first character is 0 in the second
	    string which is smaller than 2 in the first.

     OTHER
            2.x/3.x contains this command is internal. The only 
        other difference between the 1.3 & 2.x/3.x version is 
        that the 2.x/3.x version can be executed directly from 
        the command line, while the diskbased version cannot.

          
     EXAMPLE
            1. If you are running Workbench 3.0, the CLI will say 
        "An Execellent decsion. If you are running any other OS 
        then you get a message saying "Why not?"

          IF EXISTS Workbench3.0
              Echo "An excellent decision!"
          ELSE
              Echo "Why not?"

     NAME
            Info - report information about mounted file 
        system(s).

     SYNOPSIS
          Info NAME DATES

     DESCRIPTION
            This command displays important and useful 
        information about each disk unit. INFO displays what disk 
        volumes are in use and the amount of strorage they have.

            INFO also will display the name of all the disks 
        residing in any physical disk drive. This is helpful if 
        you in helping you remember what volumes are mounted 
        where. You also get a list of available volumes is also 
        listed (those mounted and unmounted).

            The 3 1/2 inch disk has 880k of space available to 
        them. After you format it under OFS (Old File System) you 
        only have 837k left. If you use FFS (Fast File System) 
        you have a full 879k to use. If you are fortunate enough 
        to have a high density drive, then you can use 1759k of 
        disk space. 

            The entire disk format is stored in sectors. There 
        are 1758 usable sectors on the Amiga disk. OFS's divide 
        each sector into 488 bytes whereas FFS has a full 512 
        bytes per sector. High Density disks use 3518 bytes per 
        sector. INFO will report the number of sectors already 
        used on the disk and how many are available for use. RAM: 
        is dynamic.  That means, it will always be reported as 
        100% full (even if it is empty) and will expand as needed 
        until it is full.

            INFO will also report if there are any 'soft' errors 
        on your disk.  So, what is a soft error? Well, it is a 
        temporary error. For example, an error reading 
        information from a disk. If the system cannot read the 
        information off the disk, it will retry a couple times. 
        If all reads fail then you have a hard error. If one of 
        your reads is successful then the original read that 
        failed is flagged as a soft error.

            It also reports whether or not disk disk is write 
        protected. If it is listed as 'Read Only' then your write 
        protection tab is set.  If it is listed as 'Read/Write' 
        then it can be written to as well as read. The RAM: disk 
        cannot be protected from reading or writing, but the 
        files you put in there can be protected from deletion 
        with the use of the PROTECT command.

             Install(V1.3, 2.x, 3.x in C:)



     NAME
            Install - Do the magic which makes a disk bootable.

     SYNOPSIS
            Install Drive NOBOOT CHECK

     DESCRIPTION
            This command should be used on all formatted floppy 
        disks that you might wish to startup the system with.  

            INSTALL adds the minimum amount of information to 
        make that disk bootable. If a blank disk is INSTALLed it 
        will bring up the AmigaDOS prompt, but that's it. To 
        invoke any AmigaDOS commands the entire path to that file 
        must be included.

            If you boot with the INSTALLed disk, it becomes the 
        Sys: directory.

            If you use INSTALL on a non-Amiga formatted disk, or 
        one with a custom boot-block, you will probably destroy 
        that disk. So, be careful how you use this command.

            The drive specified may be one of DF0:, DF1:, DF2: or 
        DF3:.

     OPTIONS
          CHECK
            This option checks to see if a disk is bootable, and 
        if standard bootblock code is installed on the disk.  For 
        use in script files, if the disk is bootable and contains 
        standard bootblock code, the error code is set to zero, 
        otherwise, the error code is set to WARN.

          NOBOOT
            This option removes any bootblock from a DOS disk, 
        and may also be used to make a non-DOS diskette readable 
        as a DOS diskette. This can be used to get rid of 
        unwanted information (aka Virus's) that may be hanging 
        out on your diskette.

		  FFS
            The disk will usually be given the boot block 
        associated with that particular file system (OFS- Old 
        File System for 1.3 or FFS- Fast File System for 
        2.x/3.x). This will force your system to install an FFS 
        disk in Workbenches under 2.1. After and including 2.1 
        you are unable to force an FFS disk on an OFS only 
        system.


		  SINGLE DISK DRIVE WARNING!!!

            If you're not careful with your this program you can 
        ruin your Workbench disk. Here's how to INSTALL a disk on 
        a single drive system.

            You will not be prompted to enter the disk after you 
        type INSTALL. So, this makes using INSTALL on single disk 
        systems very dangerous. Normally, your C: directory will 
        be assigned to the Sys: disk in df0:. So, if you insert 
        the Workbench disk in df0: then type INSTALL ?, you will 
        then get a command template that looks like this: 
        DRIVE/A. Now, eject your Workbench disk then put in the 
        one you wish to install and  then type DF0: after the 
        template then return. Now, the disk you wanted to install 
        will be installed. 


		  EXAMPLES

            1. To install a boot file on the disk in df2:

				INSTALL DRIVE df2:
            




            IPREFS (ONLY in 2.x/3.x) (located in C: directory)


	    NAME

            IPREFS - Managages the Preferences scheme in 2.x/3.x.

       	SYNOPSIS

            IPREFS QUIT

    	DESCRIPTION

            This command will read all the preference settings in 
        the ENV:Sys directory and puts those settings into 
        effect. IPREFS hangs out in memory and looks out for 
        changes made to the preference settings.

            For IPREFS updating functions to work you must have 
        all the windows of any process running closed that have 
        opened up on the Workbench. You willknow if you have 
        something open when you try to reset a Preference setting 
        and get a message saying: 'Intuition is attempting to 
        reset the Workbench screen. Please close all windows 
        except drawers.' If you get this during bootup then you 
        probably entered a command in the startup-sequence before 
        IPREFS was run. This is a good reason why you should not 
        alter your startup-sequence and make any extra programs 
        run from your user-startup script. But, if you absolutly 
        must enter a command before IPREFS, then run its output 
        to NIL:. So, to run 'NeatProgram Keywords Arguments'	
        before IPREFS, then you should enter it as 'NeatProgram 
        >NIL: Keywords Arguments'.

    	KEYWORDS

	    	QUIT
            Under 2.x only: This lets you quit IPREFS while not 
        keeping all the Prefrences intact. This keeps anything 
        from changing the preferences as they are updated. This 
        was removed under 3.x.

            NOTE: IPREFS is started during system startup. If you 
        try to run it again you will get an error message saying 
        that you already have it runnig and that you can't run it 
        again.






            Join(V1.3, 2.x, 3.x in C:)



     NAME
            Join - Combines (joins) many files into one larger 
        file.

     SYNOPSIS
            Join name1 name2.... AS or TO destname

     DESCRIPTION
            This program combines several files into one larger 
        file, which may also be a device such as a printer or 
        modem.  It accepts wildcards as its arguments. Wildcards 
        are only supported under 2.x/3.x. 1.3 MUST have more than 
        one name.

            This command will alphabetize the wildcarded 
        filenames before using them. If you specify only one 
        name, then a simple Copy will result. Any number of files 
        may be specified in the command line, and each one may be 
        a wildcard specification.

	 KEYWORDS
		  name1 name2...
            These are the files you will combine. Under 1.3 you 
        must place at least two names here, with a space between 
        each name (up to 15). 


          AS or TO
            This is the name of the new file into which the 
        contents of the other files are placed. This can be a new 
        file or an old file, but it can't be any of the files 
        which precede the AS or TO keyword. 

     ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS
            You may prefer to use TYPE for joining files rath 
        than JOIN.  JOIN is included for backward's compatibility 
        with batch scripts. The one advantage of Join is that it 
        runs a bit faster than TYPE concatenating large files.

     EXAMPLE

            1. To combine the three files File1 File2 and File3 
        into one large file named FILES1-3.  Note that the 
        original files are unharmed.

            Join File1 File2 File3 AS FILES1-3






            Lab(V1.3 in C:) (2.x, 3.x in C:)



     NAME
            Lab - Define a label for Skip.

     SYNOPSIS
            Lab label_name

     DESCRIPTION
            Lab is used to define a label for use with skip.  Lab 
        by itself defines a null label. Note that if an EndSkip 
        is encountered by Skip before the Label Skip is searching 
        for is found, the search will be aborted at that point.

         
     EXAMPLE

            1. In this example, only "But this will" will display 
        on the CLI. Just type this script out and run it to see 
        exactly how it works:

          Skip DODAH
          Echo "This will not display"
          Lab DODAH
          Echo "But this will"

     SEE ALSO
          Skip EndSkip

     CAUTION
	  With the V1.3 version of SKIP, you should NOT
	  indent a LAB statement or that label will not be found.






                  List(V1.3, 2.x, 3.x in C:)



     NAME
          List - List contents of a directory.

     SYNOPSIS
          List listname Dir P=PAT/k KEYS/s DATES/s NODATES/s SUB/k
               SINCE/k SORT/s TO/k UPTO/k QUICK/s BLOCK=BLOCKS/s
               NOHEAD/s FILES/s DIRS/s LFORMAT/k

     DESCRIPTION
            List displays the contents of a given directory.  By 
        contents, we mean the names of the subordinate files and 
        directories, not the file data.  Typing the List command 
        by itself with no parameters generates a listing of the 
        current directory. It also lists any comments attached by 
        a FILENOTE command.

     THE LISTING DISPLAY
            List displays your files and directories one per 
        line, with all the protection flags currently turned on 
        right next to the filename.  The fields which may appear 
        in a Listed file are

          name [KEY] size/type protection date time
          :comment

            Methods are provided for getting a selective listing 
        of files, as well as suppressing/adding most of the above 
        display elements.  

            A description of each one of the above elements is 
        given below:

          Name 
            The name of the file or directory. This can be a 
        device or volume name. AmigaDOS wildcards are supported 
        100%.  The inclusion of wildcards eliminates the need for 
        the P (or PAT) keyword. PAT is retained to keep 
        compatiblility with older versions of AmigaDOS.

          KEY
            This is the actual block number of the file or 
        directory block header.  This is not displayed by 
        default, you must use the KEYS switch to generate this 
        element of the listing.

          size/type
            This element gives the size of the file in bytes, or 
        the string "empty" if the file is empty. If this is a 
        directory and not a file, then the directory indicator 
        ("Dir") will appear here.

          protection
            The protection bits of the current file, in the order 
        hsparwed.  If any of these is disabled, a dash (-) will 
        appear in its place. The protection bits stand for 
        "hidden, script, pure, archived, read, write, execute and 
        delete", respectively.

          date time
            The date and time of the last modification to the 
        file or directory.  The format of the date display is 
        determined by the value of the environment variable 
        dateformat.  These elements of the listing appear by 
        default, but may be selectively added or subtracted by 
        using the DATES or NODATES keywords.

          comment
            The comment as set by Filenote.  If no comment 
        exists, this field will not be displayed.  Note that it 
        is displayed on a line by itself, preceded by a colon.


     SELECTIVE LISTING OF FILES
            The methods described in this section allow you to 
        list a portion of the files and directories on your 
        disks. Ways exist to generate a list of files that 
        conform to a certain pattern, or that were 
        created/modified before or after a certain date.  You may 
        also combine these options, for example, you may get a 
        list of all files which end in .c and were created or 
        modified since a certain date. These options are 
        described below:

          Dir  
            List this directory instead of the current directory.  
        This parameter may be a filename, in which case the 
        single file is shown.  You may also use any legal 
        AmigaDos pattern in this position, in which case the 
        files and directories listed will be those which match 
        the pattern, if any.  (This feature was added to the BCPL 
        List in the V1.3 enhancer.)

          PAT 
            List only files and directories which match the 
        pattern. You must specify the keyword PAT or its 
        abbreviation P.  This is no longer truly necessary with 
        the expanded capabilities of AmigaDOS wildcards, since it 
        is usually more convenient to simply include the pattern 
        in the directory specification as described above.  It is 
        included for BCPL compatibility.

          SUB  
            In this option the SUB keyword must come before the 
        string. If spaces are in the string, it must be enclosed 
        in quotes. With the inclusion of AmigaDOS wildcards, this 
        keyword is really not needed. It searches for an 
        occurence of the substring anywhere within the directory 
        name or filename.  Think of this as a short form of "List 
        PAT *substring*" or a long form of "List *substring*".  
        List will reject any attempts to combine the use of PAT 
        and S.  Wildcards in the initial DIR argument are matched 
        and then checked again to match against the substring.

          SINCE
            While the pattern matching options above filter files 
        and directories on the basis of their names, this option, 
        and the following UPTO option, filter out files based on 
        their last modification date. SINCE displays only files 
        which have been created or modified on or later than the 
        specified date.  All older files are not displayed.  You 
        may specify the date in the currently defined dateformat 
        (see Environment Variables) or you may use a word such as 
        SUNDAY, TODAY, YESTERDAY, etc.

          UPTO 
            The inverse of SINCE, this option displays only files 
        and directories which have been modified or created on or 
        before the specified date.  Files younger than this date 
        are not displayed. See SINCE for a description of the 
        date format list expects.

          FILES
            Display only files, and not the directories.

          DIRS
            Display only directories, and not the files.

     CONTROLLING THE DISPLAY
            The options below allow you to alter the format of 
        the display listing, or to send it to another file or 
        output display device (that's usually a printer).

          TO   
            You can specify a file or a device you wish the 
        listing to be sent to using this keyword.  If not 
        specified, the default of the current screen will be 
        used. If the file already exists then the old file will 
        be replaced (and gone forever) while being replaced with 
        this new file. If the protection bit is set on the old 
        file LIST will not work. It is very useful to LIST TO 
        prt: to get a hard copy of your disk listing.

          DATES
            Forces the date and time of creation to be displayed 
        in the current dateformat. This keyword does not have to 
        be used unless you are using the QUICK or NODATES 
        keywords. 

          NODATES
            Will not display time and date information, only the 
        filename, size, protection and comment fields will be 
        displayed. Using DATES with this will force the creation 
        dates and times to display.

          QUICK
            Displays only the filename field, one filename per 
        line, with no trailing spaces. You can LIST just the 
        files or direcotries by using the FILES or DIR options.  
        You can combine this with other options such as DATES and 
        KEYS to selectively enable these fields.  Under 2.x/3.x 
        KEYS no longer works with this keyword.

          KEYS 
            Displays the block number of each file header or 
        directory header. All files are assigned using block 
        numbers. This is how AmigaDOS keeps track of your files.  
        Each file has a unique block number assigned to it.  This 
        is its address on the disk. The block number appears to 
        the left of the file length.

          SORT 
            Sorts the file and directory names into ascending 
        alphabetical order.  Case is disregarded. Note that this 
        is an option available only with the ARP list.  Sorts by 
        DATE if you include the DATES keyword.

          BLOCK=BLOCKS
            Displays filesizes in blocks, rather than bytes.

          NOHEAD
            Suppresses the default "Directory..." header and the 
        "x files -x directories -x blocks used" footer display.

          LFORMAT
            LFORMAT can be used to control the output of list, 
        and especially to generate command lines to be fed to the 
        shell. LFORMAT can is most useful when you want to 
        generate a script file. To send the LIST output to a 
        script file, you can either redirect LIST's output using 
        the ">" or "TO" keywords. LFORMAT takes a string as an 
        argument which can be any ascii string.  

            The LFORMAT substring can be used multiple times. 
        This allows you to use the listing name more than once 
        per line. The second time you use the string the first 
        relative path will be replaced by %S, and the path of the 
        second argument will be used (BTW, a relative path is 
        merely the list of directories you must traverse to get 
        from the specified directory to the current one.) If you 
        use three substrings, then the first will be replaced by 
        the relative path, while the second and third will be the 
        file or subdirectory names. If you use it four times, the 
        first and third will be the relative paths, and the 
        second and fourth will be the subdirectory or file names.

            To include the output of List in this string, you can 
        use the "%S" sequence under 1.3 or 2.x/3.x as follows:

                  "%S"       Filename
                  "%S%S"     Pathname/Filename
                  "%S%S%S"   Pathname/FilenamePathname
                  "%S%S%S%S" Pathname/FilenamePathname/Filename

            The following information may be substituted for the 
        string as output and is for 2.x/3.x Only:

				%A   :Attributes (protection flags)
				%B	 :Size of file in blocks
				%C	 :Comments attached to the file
				%D	 :Date of file creation or last update
				%F	 :The complete absolute path (starting with the 
					  volume name)
				%K	 :Key block number
				%L	 :Length of the file in bytes
				%N	 :Name of the file
				%P	 :The relative path(starting at the current directory)
				%T	 :Time of creation or last update

            The following information may be substituted for the 
        string as output and is for 2.1/3.x Only:

				%E	 :Extension only (the part of the filename after the
					  last period)
				%M	 :Filename minus the extension (everything up to
				      the last period)
				ALL  :Lists the contents of all the subdirectories of the
				      specified directory, as well as the directory itself.

            The %S's may be separated by spaces, other ascii text 
        or nothing, as above.  Here is an example of LFORMAT that 
        will create a script to Type each file:

               List LFORMAT="Type %S%S"

            Of course, to use this, you must save it in a file 
        using TO or one of the IO Redirection operators ('>', 
        '>>').  If you are using 2.x/3.x, you can also pipe the 
        output of List directly into the Execute command.  

     ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
            The List uses the same dateformat variable as used by 
        the Date command, and in essentially the same way.  If it 
        is not defined, or if it has an illegal value, the 
        default AmigaDOS display and input is used.  Otherwise, 
        the display and the input of dates is determined as 
        follows:

          0    AmigaDOS format DD-MMM-YY.

          1    International format YY-MM-DD.

          2    U.S. format MM-DD-YY.

          3    Canada DD-MM-YY

            If you prefix the above numbers with a dash, then the 
        display of names like TODAY, MONDAY, FUTURE, etc., will 
        be disabled and the format string as defined above will 
        be used exclusively. Note that this governs the format 
        that List expects as input as well as the format List 
        uses for display.

     EXAMPLES
          
            1. To display all files in df1: ending with the 
        characters "#?.c" which were modified later than TUESDAY 
        at 00:00 hours.

			List df1:#?.c SINCE WEDNESDAY

            2. To output just the names and dates for items in 
        the current directory beginning with the letters 'stuff' 
        that were created or last updated on or before April 16, 
        1967. Sent the output out to a file called 'StuffOut' in 
        the Ram:T directory.

			LIST stuff#? QUICK DATES UPTO 16-Nov-67 TO Ram:T/StuffOut


            3. To list the information about the contents of the 
        current CLI directory.

			LIST


            4. To print the block number of all the files in the 
        current directory.

			LIST KEYS to PRT:

				or

			LIST > PRT: KEYS


            5. To display the information about the files in the 
        directory art/adult whose names contain the string 
        'girls'

			LIST art/adult/#?girls#?

			(note: Information about both 'Really Ugly Girls' and 
  			PrettyGirls would be displayed)


            6. To set the pure bit of every file in the stuff: 
        directory.

			LIST >RAM:ThisFile stuff:#? LFORMAT "protect %S +p"
	
			(now you have a file called Ram:ThisFile which contains
			the commands to set the PROTECT bit on all the files in the
			stuff: directory. Now, just EXECUTE RAM:ThisFile






              LoadLib(V1.3 only)



     NAME
            LoadLib -- Explicitly load an Amiga library.

     SYNOPSIS
            LoadLib dev:dir/library-name

     DESCRIPTION

            THIS COMMAND IS NOT NEEDED BY 2.x/3.x. 

            UNDER 1.3 ONLY: This is a new command which is 
        occasionally very useful.  If you should happen to boot 
        from a disk that does not have arp.library in its libs 
        directory you will not be able to use the ARP commands 
        directly.  This is an unusual situation, but it can 
        happen.  LoadLib presents the solution to this problem by 
        allowing you to load the library directly from whatever 
        directory you want.  After a successful LoadLib of 
        arp.library, you may use any ARP command you like.

            Note that you are not confined to loading 
        arp.library, any diskloadable library may be brought into 
        memory in this way, this can help a lot when your 
        bootdisk gets too crowded.

     EXAMPLE
            1. To boot from a disk without arp.library on it, and 
        then insert your boot disk in drive 1, then type:

               LoadLib df1:libs/arp.library

            This will allow you to execute any ARP command.  Note 
        that LoadLib cannot use arp.library, and therefore it is 
        missing some features, such as the advanced argument 
        parsing, that most ARP supplied commands have.

     OTHER
            This command was donated to ARP by William Hawes. The 
        founder of AREXX.







              LoadWB (V1.3, 2.X, 3.X in C:)



     NAME
            LoadWb -- To start the the WorkBench.

     SYNOPSIS
		  1.x:
		  LoadWB DELAY -DEBUG          

		  2.x/3.X:
		  LoadWB DELAY -DEBUG CLEANUP NEWPATH

     DESCRIPTION

            Normally it is found in your statup-sequence so that 
        your Workbench will be loaded when you start your Amiga. 
        The Workbench will set and keep track of all search paths 
        in effect as well as set the paths for each CLI or Shell 
        started from a Workbench icon.

            Under 1.x the Workbench will reinitialize whenever 
        you issue the LoadWB command. Under 2.x/3.x the Workbench 
        is reinit- ialized after selecting 'Update All' from the 
        Workbench menu. If you run LoadWB after it was already 
        loaded under 2.x/3.x then you will get an error message 
        saying that the Workbench is already loaded.		  

  	 KEYWORDS

		  DELAY
            This makes a three second pause before the program is 
        loaded.  This lets all the disk activity to stop before 
        going onto the next program in your startup-sequence to 
        start. If there is not a pause, then both commands will 
        try to access the floppy disk, this causes your floppy 
        drive to make a thrashing noise and slows down you disk 
        access tremendously.
			

		  -DEBUG
            This adds a brand new menu item to your Workbench bar 
        which is not normally displayed. There are two items on 
        this menu.  Debug (called ROMWack on 2.x/3.x) and 
        Flushlibs. Debug (ROMWack) loads the ROMWACK debugger. 
        This is a developer's tool which communicates to your 
        Amiga via a 9600-baud terminal connection to the serial 
        port. If this terminal is not connected, your Amiga will 
        appear to lock up, since nothing will work until the 
        remote terminal sends commands. Flushlibs lets the 
        Workbench flush out all the libraries from memory that 
        are not in use.  This frees up a good deal of resources. 
        This is useful for the programmer to check if his program 
        exited cleanly and freed all memory that they allocated.

            1.x ONLY: DELAY or -DEBUG may be used, but not at the 
        same time.


		  CLEANUP
            2.x/3.x Only: This performs a 'CleanUp' of the 
        Workbench window, making all your icons all neat and 
        orderly. This may also be done via the Window/CleanUp 
        while having the Workbench screen activated.

         NEWPATH
            2.x/3.x Only: This lets you change the path that the 
        Workbench uses. The Workbench usually remembers the CLI 
        or Shell path that issued the LoadWB command. This path 
        is automatically assigned to any Shell or CLI started 
        from an icon. This path can be changed by using the 
        NEWPATH keyword. The Workbench will then use the path 
        associated with the Shell window from which the command 
        was issued.


	EXAMPLES

            1. Load the Workbench and close the CLI:

			LOADWB DELAY
			ENDCLI >NIL:

            2. Load the Workbench with the DEBUG menu activated:

			LOADWB -DEBUG

            3. Add the SYS:File directory to the path that the 
        Workbench assigns to new Shell windows opened from icon:

			PATH SYS:File ADD
			LOADWB NEWPATH




            LOCK (1.X, 2.X, 3.X located in C:)



	NAME
            LOCK - Enables or disables the write protection of a 
        harddrive partition formatted under the Fast File System 
        (FFS).

	SYNOPSIS
		LOCK drive ON/OFF PASSWORD

	DESCRIPTION
            1.x only lets you enable or disable the write 
        protection of a FFS. 2.x/3.x it also enables or disables 
        the write protection of every kind of disk including 
        floppies. The drive is unlocked only when another LOCK 
        command is sent or reboot the computer.

	KEYWORDS

		DRIVE
            The name of the disk or partition. For 1.x, it can 
        only be a hard drive formatted with the FFS. 2.x/3.x lets 
        you LOCK floppy disks too. LOCK works a little 
        differently on floppies than other commands.  Normally, 
        when a command is set onto a floppy drive (eg. df0:) it 
        will only effect that particular disk. But, with LOCK, it 
        effects any and every disk inserted into the drive.

		ON/OFF
            This keyword lets you protect the disk (LOCK ON) or 
        write enable (LOCK OFF). The default is for the disk to 
        be write enabled.

		PASSWORD
            Under 1.2, this password had to be four characters 
        long. On Operating Systems 1.3 and above it can be of any 
        length.The password is considered to be a text string. 
        Therefor, if there are spaces in it, it must be enclosed 
        in quotes. If a a password was included in the LOCK ON 
        command, the same password keyword must be used in the 
        LOCK OFF command for the disk to be write enabled.


	EXAMPLES
            1.To protect harddrive partition Dh1: with a password 
        of saturn:

		LOCK DH1: ON saturn


            2. To turn off the same:

		LOCK DH1: OFF saturn

			or

		LOCK DH1: saturn






		MAGTAPE (2.x/3.x Only) (Located in C:)

	
	NAME
		MAGTAPE [DEVICE devicename] [UNIT unitname] [RET or
				 RETENSION] [REW or REWIND] [SKIP numfiles]

	SYNOPSIS
            MAGTAPE was added in 2.x to specifically control the 
        A3070 tape backup unit. Computer tape drives are 
        sequential. In other words, All computer tape drives, 
        like video or audio tapes, must be manually "fast 
        forward" or "rewind" to get to a particular file. 
        Random-access devices such as floppy drives, harddrives, 
        CDRoms, etc directly acess the information.

	KEYWORDS
		DEVICE devicename
            The devicename of unit to manipulate.

		UNIT unitname
			By default, MAGTAPE accesses SCSI unit four and
		utilizes the Commodore scsi.device. This is used because
		it is the factory defaults of the A3070. To change the
		SCSI unit number of the tape drive, or use a controlling
		device other than the scsi.device, you must specify both
		the device name of the SCSI controller (eg gvpscsi.device)
		as well as the unit number of the tape drive using both the
		DEVICE and UNIT keywords. There are usually dip switches
		in your unit that can be changed to correspond to any unit
		number you like. If you are unsure of the SCSI device driver
		your unit uses, then you should call the manufacturer. All
		SCSI drivers end in the extension: .device.

		RET or RETENSION
			This re-tensions the tape by fast-forwarding to the end
		then rewinding it.

		REW or REWIND
			Runs the tape to the beginning.

		SKIP numfiles
			Unit will run forward past a given number of files. 
		The variable 'numfiles' tells how many files to skip.


		EXAMPLE

            1. To rewind a scsi tapedrive attached to a GVP 
        controller whose unit number is set to two:

			MAGTAPE DEVICE gvpscsi.device UNIT 2 REW

		






             MakeDir(V1.3, 2.x, 3.x in C:)



     NAME
          MakeDir - Create any number of directories.

     SYNOPSIS
          MakeDir Dir/...

     DESCRIPTION
            MakeDir creates a new directory with the name you 
        give.  There is no limit to the number of directories you 
        may create with this command.  The directories will be 
        created in the order in which you supply them.  Note that 
        you cannot duplicate directories at the same level of the 
        directory tree, nor can you create a subdirectory until 
        its parent directory has been created.
		
            MakeDir allows you to create multi-tiered filing 
        systems on the same disk volume. To delete the 
        directories, you will use the DELETE command.

     EXAMPLE
            1. To make a directory named Jim:

          makedir Jim

            2. To make a directory named Mailbag inside the Jim 
        directory and the directories Jan and Feb which will 
        reside in the Mailbag directory of Jim that you just 
        created with the first part of the template.

          makedir Jim/Mailbag Jim/MailBag/Jan Jim/MailBag/Feb




	
			MAKELINK (2.x and 3.x only) (located in C:)

	NAME
            MakeLink - Creates links which point to other files.

	SYNOPSIS
            MakeLink [FROM fromname] [TO toname] [HARD] [FORCE]

	DESCRIPTION
            When a program asks for a file, they will get the 
        file linked to instead of that file itself. These links 
        are handy whenever you have different programs who want 
        to reference the same file in several different 
        directories. Let's say you like to read your docs with 
        ppmore. Well, many icons are configured to use More, Much 
        More, Multiview, or any other text viewer. Well, to use 
        your favorite reader (ppmore) you can make links that 
        direct all other readers to access ppmore instead.

            The only problem with MakeLink is that you cannot 
        make a link accross a devcice. Your link must reside on 
        the same volume or partition.

	KEYWORDS

		FROM fromname
			The name of the link file to create. You only need to include
		the FROM keyword if you have the fromname and toname reversed.

		TO toname
			The name of the file which will be linked to. This must be on
		the same volume as fromname, and cannot be a directory name unless
		you use the FORCE option is used.

		HARD
			An optional keyword is used to indicate that the link and its
		target are on the same volume. A soft link is when the link is on
		a different volume. This is currently not supported.

		FORCE
			This is to create a directory link. This is where the link file
		will look for a particular directory instead of file. This is certain
		to cause confusion within your file system, especially if the target
		directory contains linked files. It will also cause havoc if you 
		create a link to the parent directory of a target of another link.
		Even though MakeLink keeps you from making certain kinds of confusing
		links, you should be extra cautious when FORCING a link.


	EXAMPLES

            1. To make a file run the program c:ppmore instead of 
        C:more or C:muchmore

		MAKELINK c:ppmore c:more
		MAKELINK c:ppmore c:muchmore





           Mount(V1.3, 2.x, 3.x in C:)



     NAME
          Mount - Make a new device known to AmigaDOS.

     SYNOPSIS
          1.3:
          MOUNT Dev [FROM filename] STARTPROC


		  2.x/3.x:
		  MOUNT Devs [FROM filename]

     DESCRIPTION
            When AmigaDOS starts up, only a few devices are known 
        to it.  You can add new devices with the Mount command, 
        which are then used just like any standard device.  The 
        devices might be actual hardware units, or they might be 
        logical devices, such as a SPEAK: device, or a PIPE:  
        device, or a buffered serial device SER:, or even a 
        non-buffered serial device such as AUX:.  The Assign 
        command allows you to view or remove these added devices, 
        as well as the standard system devices.

            Before using this command to Mount the device, you 
        will need to create an entry for it in a file (this is 
        referred to as a MountList entry).  The details of doing 
        this vary from device to device, but there should be 
        documentation accompanying each device you intend to add 
        that describes exactly how to do this.  Ordinarily, you 
        will make this entry in the file called DEVS:Mountlist on 
        your system, but the FROM keyword gives you the option to 
        specify another file to obtain the mountlist entry from. 
        The 1.3 disk has a sample Mountlist file in the Devs: 
        directory. This will form a good example of how to 
        structure any mountlists you write.

            The size of the device is determined by the Surface, 
        LowCyl, HighCyl, and BlocksPerTrack entries. Merely 
        multiply these values together to get the available 
        storage. For example, if you had a device with a 
        Surface=2 (double sided), LowCyl= 0 and HighCyl=39 (40 
        tracks per side: 39 - 0 + 1), and with a 
        BlocksPerTrack=11 (11 sectors, each sector being 512 
        bytes) you would end up with a 440k drive (.5k X 2 X 11 X 
        40= 440K).

            For non-memory devices such as SPEAK:, AUX:, SER:, or 
        PIPE: the list simply shows where to find the handler. A 
        handler is a program similar to a device driver.

            The CLI commands FORMAT and DISKCOPY work with all 
        similar mounted devices. For instance, you can FORMAT or 
        DISKCOPY between two 3.5 inch drives and two 5.25 inch 
        drives, but not DISKCOPY between a 5.25-inch drive to a 
        3.5-inch drive.  If you try, you will get an "Object Not 
        Of Required Type" message.

            The MOUNT command looks for this Mountlist in the 
        DEVS: directory. This file is a text file that shares 
        some of the characteristics of the C programming 
        language. For instance, hexadecimal numbers must start 
        with the characters 0x. Semicolons must seperate multiple 
        descriptions on a line. Comments must appear like in all 
        AmigaDOS script comments, that is beginning with /* and 
        ending with */. The Mountlist must end with the pound 
        sign (ei #).

            2.X/3.X Only:

            There is a completely new and user-friendly way to 
        handle devices! There is a new drawer in your Workbench 
        called "DOSDrivers" inside your DEVS: directory. These 
        files are different from old mountlists in three ways: 1) 
        They don't end in a pound sign, 2) They contain only one 
        device name per file, and 3) the device name of the file 
        is not specified in the list. To mount the device, you 
        simply drag it into the DOSDrivers drawer and it will be 
        mounted automatically when the Workbench is loaded.  If 
        you don't want the mountlist loaded automatically at 
        startup, then simply place the mountlist in the 
        DOSDrivers drawer of the Storage directory.

      KEYWORDS FOUND IN THE MOUNT LIST
		  Handler= 
            The name of the device handler file. Found in you l 
        or devs directory of your workbench.

		  EHandler=
            2.x/3.x only: The name of the environment handler 
        file found in your prefs/env-arc directory of your 
        workbench.

		  FileSystem= 
            The name of the file system file. Usually found in 
        your Devs or l directory of your Workbench.

		  Device=  
            The name of your device driver file found in the Devs 
        drawer of your workbench. You can also specify a path to 
        another device location if you to locate the  driver in 
        another drawer.

		  Priority= 
            The task priority of the process; 5 is typical of 
        handlers, 10 is typical of file systems.

		  Unit= 
            The unit number of the device (ei 0 for df0: and 1 
        for df1:).

		  Flags=  
            Flags setting for the OpenDevice call (usually 0).

		  Surfaces= 
            Number of write surfaces.

		  BlocksPerTrack:
            The number of disk blocks (eg sectors) per track (eg 
        cylinder).

		  Reserved= 
            The number of blocks used for the boot block; 2 is 
        the standard here.

		  PreAlloc= 
            The number of blocks reserved at the end of a 
        partition; used with a few IBM-style (yuk!) hard drives. 
        This is usually 0.

		  Interleave=
            This value controls the AmigaDOS interleave, not the 
        physical hard drive interleave.

          LowCyl=
            Starting cylinder to use for this device.

		  HighCyl= 
            Ending cylinder for this device. Total number of 
        cylinders= HighCyl - LowCyl +1. 

		  StackSize=
            The amount of working memory to allocate to the 
        process.

		  Buffers=
            Number of cache buffers to use with the device.

		  BufMem Type=
            Type of memory to use for cache buffers. Values are 
        as follows: 
							0 or 1 = Any
							2 or 3 = CHIP
						    4 or 5 = FAST

		  Mount=
            If this value is positive, MOUNT loads the handler or 
        driver software as soon as the device is MOUNTed, rather 
        than the first time the device is accessed.  2.1/3.x 
        utilizes the word ACTIVE as a synonym for this keyword.

		  MaxTransfer=
            The maximum number of blocks transfered at one time; 
        used with the Fast File System only.

		  Mask= 
            Address mask that specifies the memory range that can 
        be used for DMA transfers; used only with the Fast File 
        System.

		  GlobVec= 
            If the handler is written in BCPL, it needs a global 
        vecotr. A value of 0 sets up a private global vector; 
        anything else indicates that the handler is written in C 
        or assembly language, and no global vector is needed.  If 
        this keyword isn't used, the shared AmigaDOS global 
        vector is used.

		  Startup=
            A string passed to the handler, device, or file 
        system on startup. This string is passed as a BPTR to a 
        BSTR.

		  BootPri=
            The boot priority of a bootable device, expressed as 
        a number between -129 and 127. A value of -129 indicates 
        that the device is not bootable, as is appropriate for 
        use with the recoverable RAM disk if you don't want to 
        boot from that device on reset.

		  DosType=
            Indicates the format of the file system used. If the 
        Fast File System is used, this value should be set to 
        0x444F5301 (DOS/1). Other types introduced in 2.1 include 
        0x444F5302 (DOS/2), an international version of the old 
        file system that allows mixed-case accented characters in 
        filenames, and 0x444F5303 (DOS/3), an international 
        version of the Fast File System.

		  Baud=    
            Serial device speed (in bits per second).

              Control=  
            Serial device control parameters- word length, 
        parity, and stop bits (eg 8N1, 7E1).

		  ForceLoad=
            A new 2.1 option. When this value is 0 (default), the 
        system will check the resource list to see if the file 
        system named in the entry has already been loaded. If it 
        has, the system will use that one, instead of loading a 
        new one.		
		  

            Under 1.3 you can only MOUNT one device at a time 
        with one MOUNT command.
		
            The 2.x/3.x version of Mount allows you to mount any 
        number of devices with one Mount command, which can speed 
        up the startup-sequence somewhat.


     OPTIONS
          FROM
            This takes one argument, which should be a filename.  
        This filename will be used to obtain the Mountlist entry 
        for the device you are adding. If this keyword is not 
        used, the file DEVS:Mountlist will be used instead.

          STARTPROC
            Ordinarily, a mounted device will have its handler 
        loaded when it is first accessed, not when mounted.  This 
        switch allows you to override the default action, which 
        will load the handler at Mount time.  Reasons for doing 
        this could include having a few handlers on an alternate 
        disk that you don't want to keep in a drive for the 
        duration of your session.

	MOUNT KEYWORDS
		
	DEV
            The actual AmigaDOS device name, such as DF2:, DH0:, 
        or SER:.  This refers to either a hardware device like a 
        disk drive or serial port, or a logical device such as a 
        RAD or harddrive partition. The keyword must be the same 
        as the label given in the Mountlist entry. The device 
        mounted should also be available to the system. 

            In 1.3 you can only specify one device per command. 
        Under 2.x/3.x you can specify multiple devices with one 
        command call. Wildcards may be used when specifying 
        multiple devices.

	FROM
            Lets you specify a file other than DEVS:Mounlist as 
        the place to look for the description of the device being 
        MOUNTed.
 
     EXAMPLE
           1. Assuming you have a mountlist for a device named 
        FRANKIE:

               Mount FRANKIE:

      CAUTIONS

            Please note the following two differences between the 
        V2.x/3.x Mount and the Commodore V1.3 Mount, which can 
        cause problems in some cases if you are not aware of the 
        differences.

            If you want to reboot from RAD: using the 2.x/3.x 
        Mount, you must insert an explicit "BOOTPRI = 0" 
        statement into the mountlist entry for RAD:, as compared 
        with the Commodore Mount which automatically will reboot 
        from RAD:.

            If you have a "MASK = nnnnn" statement in your 
        mountlist, MAKE SURE THE MASK VALUE IS AN EVEN NUMBER.  
        The 1.3 Mount automatically converts the mask value to an 
        even value, but the 2.x/3.x Mount will pass through an 
        odd value which can cause problems.  You will probably 
        only have a "MASK=nnnnnn" statement if you have memory 
        that cannot be accessed by a DMA device, such as with a 
        RONIN 68020 card.
