LONGBALL
--------
STYLE           Attacking
SHAPE           4-2-4
DESCRIPTION
        Longball is aimed at providing a good service to the front two
players 9 & 10.
It employs two wingers no`s 7 & 11, these wingers are not placed to wide so
that they can easily back up the front men.
In defence no`s 5 & 6 hang back just behind the 2 full backs no`s 2 & 3.
These full backs are positioned quite wide out so that they can serve the
wingers as well as cut out the opposing wingers.

PRESSURE
--------
STYLE           DEFENSIVE
SHAPE           5-4-1
DESCRIPTION
        Pressure is aimed at putting the opponent under pressure when they
have the ball. It employs a sweeper at no 4. Two full backs at no`s 2 & 3
and also two centre backs at no`s 5 & 6. When the opposition has
possession, everybody except you striker is back behind the ball. Once
possession has been gained, no 9 will race up to join the lone striker, no
10. No`s 7 & 11 will then move out to take up wing positions.

SWINGERS
--------
STYLE           ATTACKING
SHAPE           3-2-5
DESCRIPTION
        Swingers revolves around the theory that the more service is
provided to the front men. More goals they are likely to score. There are
three strikers at no`s 8,9, & 10, supported by no`s 7 & 11 acting as
wingers. No`s 2 & 3 also take up very wide positions.
Most defensive opereations will revolve around your sweeper no 5. At times
he will be under great pressure so a cool head is needed. The two mid
fielders no`s 4 & 6 are positioned half way between the defence and the
front line and then can therefore easily move between them.
If played well this can be a very exciting and effective tactic.

SMOTHER
--------
STYLE           DEFENSIVE
SHAPE           5-4-1
DESCRIPTION
        aimed at smothering any attack mounted by the oppostion. This
tactic should prove very hard to break down indeed. A sweeper is employed
at no 5 with no`s 4 & 6 being full backs and no`s 2 & 3 being centre backs.
The midfield is positioned deep, just in front of this defensive line,
making it very difficult to breach. The lone striker is at no 10 and he
will have the thankless task of taking on the opposition single handed, but
you woundnt play this tactic if you wanted to score anyway.

DESPERADO
---------
STYLE           ATTACKING
SHAPE           3-1-6
DESCRIPTION
        To be used in desperate situations only. It leaves you woefully
exposed at the back with two very wide wingers, two out and out strikers
and two more attackers set just behind and to the side of these, its
always going to cause even the most well organised defence a problem or
two.

MIDFIELD
----------
STYLE           NEUTRAL/DEFENSIVE
SHAPE           4-5-1
DESCRIPTION
        This tactic is adopted when the offside option is being used.
Without offside option, your defense will be next to useless as it relies
heavily on the offside trap. Once agian there is just one lone striker at
no 10. Numbers 4 & 8 , & 9 make up the heart of the midfield, with no`s 7 &
11 as left and right midfielders. There arent too many attacking options
available with these tactics. Long mazy runs from deep in the midfield are
the key to these tactics for scoring goals.

SPREAD
-------
STYLE           NEUTRAL/ATTACKING
SHAPE           4-3-3
DESCRIPTION
        Aimed at those of you who think they can really pass the ball. All
your players are positioned all over the pitch, there is no bunching at
all. You can really spread the play from side to side and it proves to be,
if played well, a nightmare to defend against. The back four play quite
flat so you can even have a quite effective offside trap at times. With
players 3,4 and 11 acting wide out on the left, and numbers 2,8 and 7 out
on the right there is a lot of scope for attacking down the wings.

COUNTER
-------
STYLE           NEUTRAL/DEFENSIVE
SHAPE           5-2-3
DESCRIPTION
        These tactics change from defence to attack quickly. If the
opposition is in possession, these tactics will get as many of your players
back behind the ball as quick as possible, but when possession is gained
no`s 11 & 7 will run out wide to become wingers, and no 10 will race
forward, closely followed by no`s 8 & 9 from midfield. At all times a basic
5 man defence will be in opperation with no 4 as sweeper.

OFFSIDE
-------
STYLE           NEUTRAL/ATTACKING
SHAPE           4-2-4
DESCRIPTION
        This is another formation that relies heavily on the offside rule,
so if offside is not selected then don`t use this tactic. Basically it`s
the standard 4-2-4 formation with a very strict back 4 who will try to stay
on the halfway line, but if advanced upon will retreat back to the edge of
the penalty area and no further. No`s 9 & 10 are pushed forward so that
they may benefit from the long ball, but also they have wingers at no`s 7 &
11 who play quite wide and should be able to give a good service.

OVERLAP
-------
STYLE           ATTACKING
SHAPE           5-3-2 TO 3-5-2
DESCRIPTION
        This tactic changes from being 5-3-2 in defensive mode to 3-5-2 in
attacking mode. This is achieved by pushing the two fullbacks no`s 2 & 3 up
past the wingers no`s 7 & 11, giving even greater width to an impressive
looking formation. No`s 9 & 10 play as out and out strikers and no 8 as a
roving midfielder. The sweeper system is used again, and no`s 5 & 6 being
the centrebacks and no 4 the sweeper.
If played well this tactic can be devastating and also very exciting to
watch.

FORT KNOX
---------
STYLE           DEFENSIVE
SHAPE           7-2-1
SUMMARY
        This tactic is aimed at denying the opposition any time on the ball
anywere near the goal. No 10 plays as the lone striker with no`s 8 & 9 in
midfield. The defense spreads out from the sweeper at no 5 with no`s 4 & 6
playing as centrebacks, no`s 2 & 3 outside these and no`s 7 & 11 outside
these as fullbacks.

GASP
----
STYLE           ATTACKING
SHAPE           3-2-5
SUMMARY
        This tactic is for use in extreme emergencies only as it leaves
your defence wide-open and prone to attack. No 5 plays as a sweeper with
no`s 2 & 3 as fullbacks.
The midfield consists of no`s 4 & 6, no`s 7 & 11 adopt very wide positions
with no 8 playing just in behind the two front men no`s 9 & 10.

SHUFFLE
-------
STYLE           NEUTRAL/ATTACKING
SHAPE           5-2-3
SUMMARY
        This tactic is a little strange in that throughout the time this
tactic is employed the fullback no 2 and the winger no 7 and also the
fullback no 3 & the winger no 11 (thats what it says here !!!?????!!! N & Z)
continually swap positions. This can lead to some very effective
overlapping by the fullbacks. A sweeper system is once again employed with
no 5 assuming this role. No`s 4 &6 are the centre backs with no`s 8 & 9 in
midfield and number 10 as the striker.

WIDEBOY
--------
STYLE           NEUTRAL/ATTACKING
SHAPE           4-2-4
SUMMARY
        This tactic is for those of you who like using wingers or maybe
those of you who dislike playing against wingers as no`s 2 & 3 play as very
wide fullbacks, effectively snuffing out the opponents wide men. No`s 5 & 6
are centrebacks with no`s 4 & 8 in midfield. No`s 7 & 11 act as the wingers
with numbers 9 & 10 being the strikers.

BREAK
------
STYLE           NEUTRAL
SHAPE           4-3-3 TO 4-2-4
SUMMARY
        This tactic has been mainly designed for use in PLAYER MANAGER but
also works well in KICK OFF 2 . It employs two centrebacks numbers 5 & 6
and two fullbacks numbers 2 & 3. The midfield comprises of numbers 4 ,8 and
sometimes 9 who also does his fair share of attacking duties. Two wingers
are used at numbers 7 & 11 , but these are not overly wide and the striker
is at number 10. this is a very well balanced tactic.

DYNAMIC
---------
STYLE           ATTACKING
SHAPE           4-2-4
SUMMARY
        This another tactic designed with PLAYER MANAGER very much in mind,
but also as with BREAK it works well in KICK OFF. Dynamic is a more attacking
variation of BREAK with the number 9 moving upto play as the second
striker. again this is a well balanced tactic, that should be able to
defend as well as it attacks.

STRIKER
-------
STYLE           ATTACKING
SHAPE           3-2-5
SUMMARY
        This is yet again another tactic that has been designed for use in
PLAYER MANAGER as a very attackin option. Number 5 is a sweeper and numbers
2 & 3 act as fullbacks. Numbers 4 6 and 8 run the midfield and numbers 7
and 11 play out very wide on the wings.Numbers 9 and 10 play as strikers.
This tactic has been tryed and tested by STEVE SCREECH in his PLAYER
MANAGER side

SWEEPER
-------
STYLE           DEFENSIVE
SHAPE           5-3-2
SUMMARY
        This is a new sweeper formation which should also snuff out the
opposition wing play as well as there forwards. Numbers 2 & 3 play out very
wide as fullbacks and numbers 4 & 6 play as centrebacks next to number 5 -
the sweeper. Numbers 7,8 and 11 are in the midfield with numbers 9 & 10 up
front.

THRILLER
--------
STYLE           ATTACKING
SHAPE           5-2-3
SUMMARY
        This tactic is a very attacking sweeper formation. It works
particulary well if you employ "LONG BALL" method of playing KICK OFF 2.
Both fullbacks numbers 2 & 3 and wingers 7 & 11 play out very wide are
difficult to defend against. Numbers 8 & 9 play as midfielders with number
10 as the striker and number 5 as the sweeper.

COMPACT
-------
STYLE           NEUTRAL/DEFENSIVE
SHAPE           4-4-2
SUMMARY
        This tactic is aimed at packing the midfield and stopping the
opposition playing. Numbers 4,7,8, and 11 take on the midfield duties with
numbers 2,3,5 and 6 playing very flat across the back. Numbers 9 & 10 play
up front and will have to work hard to break down the opposition, but you
should not play this formation if you are losing.

End.
