1 INSTALLATION


To load the action just type 'action' from cli or use the original

Hacker Ethic version on this disk which will load automatically

the action replay file version will be loaded in the highest 

location of the ram ( slow motion function is not possible )


------------------------------------------------------------------


2 FREEZER


This version features a freezer option ( both mouse batons and 'F' 

key pressed together ) this will halt the program in operation 

and take you to the action replay main function menu .

 
Freeze function will work on majority of programs but you can 

find some programs can not be frozzen dew to their construction.


Pressing 'HELP' will produce an on screen list of all the commands

available 'SHIFT' will pose the listing .

 
FREEZER COMMANDS 


F1 			clears the actual picture
F2 			puts cursor in the top lefthand corner
F9			Keyboard setting US/German
F10			switch screens
HELP		short help listing (shift to pause)
DEL			clears the char at cursor position
Back Space	clear the char. in front of the cursor position
TAB			inserts a space in front of the cursor
KEYS

X 			will return to the program in memory
XX			switches out the catrige ( to return to AR is to 				loaded it again)


------------------------------------------------------------------

3 SAVING THE PROGRAM


Since AR uses FDOS it is necessary to format the disk which you 

wish use

SF"DISK NAME"

will format the disk i FDOS mode

SA"NAME"

saves the program in memory 

SD"NAME"

deletes the selected program

SM"NAME",START END

saves part of the memory ( dont EXCEED 940 KB )

SS"NAME",channel list ( 1 - 4 ) 

save sound sample in one of four channels 


------------------------------------------------------------------

4 RE LOADING A PROGRAM

LD

shows dir of FDOS disk

LR"NAME"

reloads and runs selected program

LA"NAME"

reloads program but it will not run it

LM"NAME",START

reload saved memory at start address


__________________________________________________________________


5 TRAINER

TS value

starts trainer and searches for the first value eg lives TS4 or TS!4 for dec value then go back to the game get killed and freeze the program and then do this

! dec 
% binary
nothing in front for hex

T value

continues trainer with notified value ( after the kill eg T3 or T!3 for dec value "

TX 

will exit the trainer

if the trainer is successful you will receive address to change the live or what ever you are looking for 

M address

eg  14444  03 00 66 77 88 55 78 87 ghfdt p;,jmn

change the firs two bytes so it looks like that 

14444 FF 00 66 77 88 55 78 87 ghft p,jmn

now you have 256 lives 

some programs use binary coded decimal for representation so dont be fulled

others like Interceptor (use no fast mem) use hex 24 to store 2 sidewinders

and 4 mavricks that was a pain to find. (13 places foward is the acceleration

factor 7f maximum 80 reverse it is fun try it!!) Look close to the adress 

for energy or other weapons. You can use FA - find adress but make sure that 

it is even this will give you all the adresses dealing that adress and by

changing them you can make unlimited lifes EVEN LAMER can do it with some

knowledge of 68000.

------------------------------------------------------------------

7 APPENDIX

- "DANGER RESIDENT PROGRAM ALLOCATED (VIRUS)"
		
		a reset fixed program or data module is recognized
		you can say it is a virus but it also could be a reset 			fixed RAM-d
                with file version it thinks it is a virus because it
