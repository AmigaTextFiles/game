Typed in by ???. Edited by PARASITE.


HOW TO PLAY
        You are one of the Bloodwych. You must take on the persona of one
of the last sixteen champions of  Trazere. You must first explore Treidwyl,
recruting more champions, and gathering items to aid your task. Once you
are prepared you must get the four crystals of storing fron the towers.
Take them to the fifth tower and there destroy Zenddick, and banish the
Lord of Enthropy to the realm of chaos. To do this you will have to defeat
the agents of Zendick. The Lord of Entropy has transformed many of the
citzens of Tazere into weird monsters, and twisted the minds of many into
those of psychotic killers.
some of these citizens may aid you, but many will try to destroy you. Good
luck in your mission, and remember the spirit of the Bloodwych is always
with you.

                your level is, the more competent you are at everything.

STRENGTH:       This affects how easily you hit during combat and how much
                damage you will inflict on your opponent.

AGILITY:        This also affects your skill in combat, as well as your
                ability to dodge attacks.

INTELLIGENCE:   This limits the number of spell points you have.

                points can be restored with appropriate potions, spells, or
                by resting. The first figure shows your current hit points,
                while the second shows the maximum number of hit points you
                can reach.

VITALITY:       This is an indication of how much energy you have. if your

                recovered.

        The cost of the spell selected may be altered by clicking on the
arrows on either side of the current value. Raising the cost of a spell will
improve its power and cast percentage. Your current maximum spell points are
shown beneath the spell. Successful use of a spell will increase your
proficiency at that spell which will make the spell cheaper and / or more
powerful for future casts. A spell whitch has been prepared will remain so
until it is cast or another spell is selected or the party sleeps.

CASTING SPELLS
        A spell is cast by clicking on the star icons ether side of the
spell name. If the spell book is closed before a prepared spell is cast then
the door icon will be replaced by a star icon, whitch may also be used to

then the spell will automatically be cast first. It is not possible for a
character to cast a spell which requires more spell points than he or she
currently has available. A spell with a low cast percentage may fial and
this will be indicated by a appropriate message. After casting a spell the
castor will endure a temporary penalty on all spells while he recovers from
the efforts of casting. This recovery time is longer for higher level
spells.

SPELL EFFECT
        All spells have a variable effect which is a combination of your
ability as a magic user, the energy you expend on a spell,your experience in
the spell being cast, and luck. the cast percentage bar gives a clear
indication of whether you are likly to cast the spell successfully. Once
your ability to cast the spell reaches 100% the effects of the spell begin
to grow stronger.

        Some spell have a continuing effect. When these are cast an icon,
representing the spell,replaces the door icon. The spell can be cancelled by
clicking on theis icon. No other spells can be cast while a continuous
spell is in use. If another spell is cast from the spell book while a
continuous spell is in use,then this will also cancel the continuous spell.
 You may have another spellprepared while a continous spell is running. The
prepared spell may either be cast from the spell book , or by cancelling
the continuous spell to reveal the star icon on the main panel.

SPECIALISATION
        All characters are specialised in one of the colours of migic
according to their alignment. This is indicated by the colour of the Suit
icon and Shield. Spells of natural colour are easier to cast, easier to
develop proficiency in, and more effective than the spells of another
colour. Each colour of magic represent a different sphere of influence:

        Blue            Moon Magic      represents the mind and illusion
        Red             Dragon Magic    is the use of fire and energy
        Yellow          Chaos Magic     effects the very nature of magic
                                        and life.
