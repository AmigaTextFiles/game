        The solution to the first part of the game:

DE PROFUNDIS
         Click and wait from the column of icons to the right and the
platform will sink a little. A verticle colomn will also come dowm
from the celing.
        Select the rope from your possesions and lasso the vertical
column. Wait twice and the granate monster will appear again. Click on
him, and choose jump on. Wait again, and he'll take you to the exit
and you'll recieve a skull as you leave

THE NOOSE
        Activate the psi-power of solar eyes so that you can see what
you're doing. Click on the left rope beneath the poormouth and grab
hold of it (the right rope is slippery).
        Push the lever to bring the poormouths life to an and. Click
on the rope that is supporting him and choose to take it.
        In the platform there's a hollow which you must click on.
Inspect it and you'll find another skull. Leave the room and continue
your quest.

THE WALL
        Click on the third arrow on the floor and the panels will
slide across halfway. Click on the left door and the panels will slide
fully across to close off the centre of the room.
        Inside the door you'll find a panel. Click on the step and
choose climb on (if you don't, you'll die!). Select the dagger and put
it in the slot in the figure to the left.
        There will be two passages visible, left and straight on.
Click on the left passage and then click on the deep cavity in the
floor. Stick in your hand to find yet another skull.
        Click on the floor when the word "passage" is visible and
you'll have a choice of left or straight on. This time go straight on.

THE TWINS
        Click on each of the serpants in turn and open their mouths.
Enter the source room by clicking on the relevant door and inspect the
fountain.
        Press the eye in the fountain and water will fill the bath.
Select the goblet from your possesions and choose fill goblet. Go back
into the twins room.
        Click on the goblet and choose empty. Position the mouse
pointer over the left serpant, and click the button. A die will float
to the top, and you must take it immediatly, or it will sink down the
serpants throat again.
        Put the die into the right serpant amnd the door "who shall be
saved?" can now be opened. Go through the door for the final stage of
the problem.
        Click on each hand, lift them all and then click on the
serpants head. Choose press and there will be a sound from the source
room. Enter it and stand on cube two. Click on cube two and lift it to
obtain the fourth skull.

SCORPOINS PRESENCE
        Click on the square bit of the statue, and select pray. You'll
now be able to enter. Click on the webbed floor, and select crawl, and
you'll be in front of the mistress. When she asks you for a presence,
give her the fly and she will then ask you to feed the tarantula. Feed
a blue one, and she'll give you a red one. Click on the door to leave
again. Put the red scorpion in the mouth of the statue, and a trap
door will open. Enter it and you'll be given a skull.
        Take all five skulls to the guard, and you will become a divo
and will be allowed to advance to the next stage of the game.
