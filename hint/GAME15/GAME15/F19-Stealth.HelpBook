ATTACK TECHNIQUES : --------------------------------------------------------
MISSILES : -----------------------------------------------------------------
MISSILE RANGES:The maximum range of a missile depends not only on its motor,
but your plane's  speed at launch  and the direction  of enemy movement. The
initial "lock-on" range  corresponds to missile  maximum range if  you're at
maximum speed. However, if you're moving slower the missile may not get that
extra boost needed to reach the target.

A much more important consideration is the enemy's flight path.If the target
plane is  flying toward you, even a maximum  range launch is likely to reach
him.However, if the target plane is flying away the missie has a long "stern
chase" ahead of it. In such a situation you should wait until the oval turns
red before launching.

RADAR GUIDED MISSILES:Your AIM-120 AMRAAM missile is one of the best medium-
range weapons in the world.It is the only "fire and forget" radar-guided mis
sile in American inventory.It has sufficient circuitry to penetrate most de-
fenses, and sufficient  maneuverability to chase  down most fighters, not to
mention nailing bombers and transports.Because the AIM-120 has greater range
than the Sidewinder (32 km -> 17 km),pilots typically open fire with the AIM
120,then switch to Sidewinders if any enemy aircraft  survive to that range.

IR GUIDED MISSILES: The short-range  AIM-9M  Sidewinder is probably the best
dogfighting  missile in the world. It is more maneuverable  than the AMRAAM,
giving it a better chance of "hanging on" to a twisting, turning target. The
most advantageous firing position for the Sidewinder is up the enemy's tail-
pipes. The next  best position  is from above, diving down onto the top (hot
side) of the enemy plane.The third best position is directly into the enemys
nose. Shots against the enemy as it crosses in front of you,or at its under-
side (the cold side) have very little chance of hitting.The main weakness of
the Sidewinder is its limited range.

TECHNIQUE: When firing a missile, always remember to (1) open the bay doors,
and (2) wait for the lock-on. If you don't wait for the target box to become
oval-shaped, you're firing without a lock-on,and will almost certainly miss.
Then look at your airspeed.If you're moving fast (around 500kts) or the tar-
get is closing,a maximum range lock-on shot`ll probably hit. However,if your
speed is low or the target flying away  you should wait until the range clo-
ses,ideally until the oval turns red.

Missile accuracy doesn't take into account enemy defensive equipment or eva-
sive maneuvering. First line and elite fighter aircraft may prove more diff-
icult to hit. Although  the "Mainstay" AEW&C craft  maneuvers poorly, it has
superior  defensive equipment. You may find  that guns are necessary against
Mainstays flown by a capable crew.

FIRING ATTITUDE : Also remember that AAMs,like other missiles,will fall 300'
to 400' before their motor is powerful enough to guide them away to the tar-
get.Until then the  missile has your speed  and VVI. If you're diving at the
ground,the missile may slam into the ground before it can fly away.Firing in
a tight turn, or while inverted,can cause the missile to tumble as it leaves
the weapons bay. Best method is to fire only when you're level + above 500'.

TARGET DISCRIMINATION : Sidewinders and AMRAAMs always home on the most pro-
minent target, which is usually the nearest.They will do so even if you were
tracking someone else. In Cold  War and Limited War, beware of  this limited
"brainpower" in your missiles.You may be tracking a primary / secondary tar-
get,fire a missile, and then discover it goes for one of the fighter escorts
that happens to be closer!

NOTES : Your F-19 uses a tracking  camera instead of weapon guidance radars.
This system "downloads" appropriate launch parameters to the AIM-120 AMRAAM.
Although the AIM-120 itself uses radar,the set switches on  when the missile
is launched. As a result, missile  targeting does not  increase your EMV. Of
course,opening the bay doors to fire does increase your EMV.A skillful stea-
lth pilot only opens the bay doors just before launch, or during a dogfight.

GUNS : ---------------------------------------------------------------------
Jet aircraft travel so quickly that conventional machine guns/cannons cannot
fire fast enough to guarantee a hit: a plane could literally fly between the
shells. Therefore,modern aircraft cannon are either a group of guns (such as
the twin 23mm  cannons in  many Russian MiGs) or  a multi-barrel gatling gun
(such as the six-barrel 20mm M61A1 on  most American jets). Cannons are used
because they fire explosive shells (machine guns fire less destructive solid
lead slugs).Small 20mm to 30mm cannons are used because large weapons cannot
fire fast enough. Aircraft cannons have an effective range of 0.5 to 3 km, a
maximum range of 6 kilometers. Inside  0.5 kilometers there is a significant
danger that a piece from a disintegrating target might hit you.

THE HISTORICAL GUNSIGHT: Your F-19 has the most modern and advanced gunsight
available:a "historical" gunsight with automatic laser rangefinder.In normal
operation this gunsight "assumes" you are firing at maximum range (6 km).Ho-
wever,if your tracking box is on a closer target, that shorter range is used
instead for gunsight calculations. The gunsight computer constantly calcula-
tes range,flight path,and ballistics for you.It then displays where your sh-
ells would be if they  were hitting the target now. The gunsight continually
calculates firing, delays the appropriate time and display potential hits as
they would occur.Therefore,the sight is "assuming" that you fired at the cor
rect time in the past (hence the term "historical" gunsight).

ANTICIPATION FIRING : It takes about 2 seconds for M61A1 20mm shells to tra-
vel the maximum 6 kilometer range. Therefore, to hit a target you must judge
the speed at which the target and your sight converge. You should fire about
2 sec.  before they meet.If the range is less than 6 km, wait a little less.
For example,at 3 km wait until target and sight are one second apart; at 1.5
km wait until target and sight are a half second apart,etc. You can use this
sight like an old fashioned predicting sight.That is,wait until the sight is
on the target,then shoot. But at 6 km  range you'll  have to hope the target
stays on the same course for 2 secs to insure a hit. Airplane targets aren't
always so obliging! In short,the key to using a historical gunsight is anti-
cipation.Don't wait for the sight to reach the target.Instead,learn to anti-
cipate the meeting of sight and target,then shoot ahead of time.

PERFORMANCE LIMITATIONS : Although the maximum range of your M61A1 20mm Vul-
can cannon is 6 km,this is not the recommended engagement range.At ranges be
yond 3 km  accuracy falls off  considerably. Beware of firing at ranges less
than 0.5 km. If the enemy is closer, you could be hit by pieces of wreckage.
Your 20mm cannon has a large ammunition supply,but the huge rate of fire me-
ans it goes quickly.Fire short bursts instead of long ones,especially again-
st aircraft."Hosing down" a target is extremely wasteful.If the shot is that
difficult to achieve, you're crazy to waste ammo on it. In air combat cannon
shots are usually  very good or very bad, with very few  intermediate cases.
NOTES : The historical gunsight requires conscious "retraining" to use well,
since it doesn't require you to "place the sight on the target".However,this
weakness is more than compensated for by the advantages of anticipation fir-
ing.The sight allows you to fire sooner, and more accurately, than any other
sight in existence. The historial gunsight is the device of choice among "in
the know" fighter jocks. The gunsight on this model uses a laser rangefinder
slaved to the tracking camera,rather than the traditional ranging radar.This
means you can use your gun without increasing your EMV.

AIR-TO-AIR DUELS : ---------------------------------------------------------
THE AMBUSH : ---------------------------------------------------------------
Best way to start air-to-air combat is to surprise your opponent. Enemy air-
craft have only forward-facing radars(except the Il-76 "Mainstay" AEW&C).The
best way to ambush an  enemy plane is  to slide up behind him. Traditionally
fighter pilots prefer to attack from above.This gives them an energy advant-
age in any dogfight.However,missile tactics + the importance of secrecy make
height advantage less valuable for a stealth pilot. Gaining height makes you
visible to enemy radar,which in turn will certainly warn your targets.There-
fore,approaching low and from behind is often wiser.Only if your missile at-
tacks fail and the enemy discovers  you should you begin to seek an altitude
advantage.If you're surprised or "bounced"(attacked from above) by the enemy
immediately look for incoming  missiles + take appropriate defensive action.
Missiles arrive faster than aircraft,and therefore must be avoided first.On-
ly then can you begin dogfighting or attempt to escape.

THE MISSILE EXCHANGE : -----------------------------------------------------
Often an air-to-air battle starts because the  enemy has discovered you, and
vectors fighters in your direction.The result,quite frequently,is a head-to-
head face-off,you against him.In this westernstyle showdown each side starts
with an exchange of long- to medium-ranged radar missiles.Be prepared to de-
coy,jam,and possibly chaff the "incoming".Once your radar missile is away,sw
itch to an AIM-9M Sidewinder.You may get a second closerange missile shot if
the AMRAAM fails.Scoring with a head-to-head cannon shot is much more diffi-
cult,and not worth the ammo unless either (a) you're out of missiles, or (b)
you're an incredibly good marksman.Naturally,if you can get off a second mis
sile shot,so can the enemy if he carries  second-generation IR missiles (the
AA-8 or AA-10 IR version).These nasties show up frequently on MiG-29s and Su
27s,but aren't unknown on other craft flown by Veteran or Elite pilots.

THE EARLY TURN : -----------------------------------------------------------
One of the most difficult,but most useful tactics in a head-to-head match is
making an early turn. This is a maneuver where  you make a tight 180 degrees
turn so that you come out of the turn already  closing on the incoming MiG's
tail.Against inexperienced pilots this trick`s easy,since greenhorns usually
keep boring in,hoping for a cannon shot,and only thinking about a turn after
they've passed you.Against vets an early turn requires fine timing.If you tu
rn more than a sec or two ahead  of the enemy you're  just telegraphing your
intentions.If you wait too long,you get no advantage at all.

ENEMY MISSILES : -----------------------------------------------------------
RADAR-HOMING AAMS : The  Russian AA-10 Alamo  is a "fire and forget" missile
just like your AIM-120 AMRAAM.All other Russian radar-guided weapons are se-
mi-active homers.Here the launching aircarft must continue to paint you with
its radar -the missile homes on the "paint".You avoid radar-homing AAMs just
like SAMs.That is,use reduced EMV,ECM jamming + ultimately chaff. Decoys can
be very effective.Note that the MiG-25 and MiG-31 carry extremely longranged
radar AAMs. Low EMV,ECM and decoy tactics  are especially  effective against
these weapons.Consider yourself fortunate that none of the Iranian F-14s ha-
ve operational Phoenix missiles.These long-range killers are especially dif-
ficult to evade.

INFRARED (IR) HOMING AAMS :All IR homing AAMs are "fire and forget" weapons.
Of these the AA-8 is the most dangerous because of  its second generation IR
seeker and great maneuverability. If enemy  MiGs/Sukhois close to AA-8 range
(8 km) you're often in trouble. Techniques to evade  IR AAMs are the same as
those used against IR SAMs. That is, use the IR jammer at long range, flares
at short range.The decoy also works. In practice,many IR homers are fired at
short ranges  during a dogfight. This means that you've got to leap onto the
IR jammer when you get a launch warning, then  dodge out of the missile's 45
degree field of view immediately. At dogfighting ranges missile flight times
are very short ! If this fails, or you  delay too long, the missile approach
klaxon will go off. Now you've got bare seconds to react: dump a flare imme-
diately and dodge,or you're history. One nice thing about IRAAMs is that the
older AA-2,AA-6 and AA-7 designs  all use first generation seekers.The enemy
must get on your tail before these  missiles lock on. Keep him off your tail
and you avoid this entire  class of weaponry. Of course, doing that requires
dogfighting skills.

DOGFIGHTING : --------------------------------------------------------------
The essential rule in dogfighting is to get on the enemy's tail. On all figh
ter aircraft,guns and missile guidance  systems only face forward. If you're
on the enemy's tail,you can shoot and he can`t. If you can't get on his tail
at least try to place his aircraft ahead  of you as much as possible, so you
have the maximum number of firing opportunities. Maintaining higher speed or
altitude is valuable in a dogfight. A plane slower  and lower can only dodge
attacks.A plane faster or higher can attack or  retreat as desired. Having a
higher  speed or altitude is termed  the "energy advantage". If the enemy is
behind you, there are various classic escape maneuvers : Turning Inside, the
Scissors, the Immelmann,the Split-S,and the Yo-Yo. Not only should you learn
them, but also learn to recognize these maneuvers so you can apply the appro
priate counter-maneuver.

TURNING INSIDE : The simplest solution to  an enemy plane  coming up  behind
you is -turn toward him (i.e.,turn in the  direction of the enemy aircraft).
If you're turning faster than he, you'll gradually circle  around + get onto
his tail.This kind of a "turn match" is frequently  seen when greenhorns dog
fight.Of course,if the enemy is turning  faster than you, he will eventually
come around behind you. If this  happens try something else immediately. The
longer you wait the worse it gets, until he lines up a shot  and toasts you.

SCISSORS : A more complex way to out-turn an  enemy aircraft is the scissors
maneuver.Begin a turn toward him, but once he begins to turn with you,quick-
ly roll over to turn in the other direction. This opens the scissors. As the
enemy realizes you've turned  away + turns toward you again, you reverse the
procedure and roll back toward him again. If your turns were quicker + tigh-
ter than his,and/or you're  a slower plane, he will eventually pass in front
of you. This allows you  to get onto his tail. Novice pilots  trying to turn
with you can be lured into a  scissors  with ease. Even if their planes turn
better, their slow reactions to  each scissor opening and closing`ll quickly
give you the edge. More experienced enemies may avoid this tactic by antici-
pating your next turn and blasting  you (if they're less maneuverable),or by
pulling up and over in a yo-yo (if they're faster).

IMMELMANN TURN : This maneuver is an excellent way  to reverse direction qu-
ickly.First you perform a halfloop to reverse direction, then a half roll to
right your  aircraft. If an  enemy aircraft  is behind you, an Immelmann can
bring you nose-to-nose with him. The original Immelmann,a German WWI fighter
pilot,reputedly rolled while vertical, allowing him to finish the loop in wh
atever direction he desired. He still finished the half-loop inverted - it's
aerodynamically more efficient that way. Note that an Immelmann gives you an
altitude gain but costs speed, since a  half-loop upward slows you down sig-
nificantly.

SPLIT-S TURN : This maneuver complements the Immelmann. Begin by rolling in-
verted,then pull the stick back to half-loop downward. Many pilots begin the
loop before the roll is completed,rolling the plane while looping. The split
S causes you to lose considerable altitude, so it's often wise to reduce thr
ottle and/or use speed brakes to minimize altitude loss. The Split-S comple-
ments the Immelmann because you gain speed and lose altitude. Unwary fighter
pilots have sometimes tried to  Split-S into or  away from the enemy without
remembering their  altitude. Result can be a Split-S  right into the ground!

YO-YO TURN : This maneuver is used  mainly by higher speed jets against slo-
wer opponents.Therefore the relatively  slow F-19 has little occasion to use
it dogfighting. However, you may see enemy MiGs  attempting it against you !
This turn also requires excellent cockpitvisibility, something that both the
F-19 and early MiGs lack.In a Yo-Yo turn you  climb and roll toward the ene-
my -until he's visible out the top of  your canopy. Then pull over into dive
while still turning. During the dive you roll the plane to help line up your
shot.Very often you will take that shot  while inverted. Don't let it bother
you.Because a YoYo requires good spacial perception, first practice it using
the Slot View (if alone) or  Tacti  View (if you've got a target). In combat
conditions  switching to a wide  angle view is extremely  helpful in pulling
the HUD around onto the enemy after you  come over the top. Then you can swi-
tch back to normal view again. In effect a Yo-Yo plane makes a very big turn
in three dimensions. Most of the turn radius is "consumed" with the climbing
and diving,allowing a faster plane  to travel further and turn wider,yet st-
ill come out on the tail of the more maneuverable plane. American F4 Phantom
pilots used the maneuver  with great success  against slower but more maneu-
verable MiG21s over North Vietnam during the Vietnam war. Note that the best
defense against a Yo-Yo is to  reverse your turn, or to use the third dimen-
sion yourself,usually by going into a Split-S).

ENEMY GUNS : ---------------------------------------------------------------
The enemy has cannons equivalent to yours in range and power. However,the en
emy still uses old predicting gunsights. This means they are virtually requi
red to get behind you before they  can make a good shot. In addition,all but
the most elite pilots will be slow to fire, since they must place the gunsi-
ght on the target and keep it there to score a hit. If you sense the enemy`s
behind you and ready to fire cannons,"jinking" (small  violent moves in ran-
dom directions) can throw  off his aim. Finally, Russian-built aircraft with
the older GSh-23 cannon  may not always hit, since the lower volume of fire-
power increases the chances  of you "flying between the shells" and escaping
serious injury. Don't rely on this! Not every 23mm shell is  an unlucky one!

PART 4	MISSION BRIEFINGS : ------------------------------------------------
RULES OF ENGAGEMENT : ------------------------------------------------------
Rules of Engagement(ROE) outline what targets a pilot can and cannot attack.
In an age of nuclear weapons  unrestricted warfare  would destroy the planet
within 24 hours.Therefore,all wars are limited to some degree. If warfare is
limited to just a local area with specific goals,ROEs are much more restric-
tive.If an official state of war does not exist then the rules will be extr-
emely restrictive.In stealth missions,ROEs also determine what "exposure" of
your aircraft is allowed. In cold and limited war situations it is important
that the enemy not know exactly who or what performed the attack.This allows
the politicians to say whatever they want.

COLD WAR SITUATIONS : ------------------------------------------------------
ROE : You may attack and destroy a target only if it`s specifically required
by your mission orders.You may engage other targets only if they fire first,
or if they have spotted your plane.The mission is completely clandestine.You
must avoid detection,especially visual detection by enemy aircraft.Enemy air
or ground forces that do detect you should be destroyed,to prevent embarass-
ing disclosures.Neutrals and civilians must be considered friendlies,and ab-
ove all you should avoid detection by neutral aircraft and radars.Background
Notes: In cold war situations the State Department must have deniability for
every mission. If the mission is successful and the  political climate seems
good,the USA may claim credit for the deed. In other cases, however, America
may not wish to attach its name to the action.You are warned when enemy rad-
ar returns are  good enough to  spot your craft, or when enemy aircraft come
close enough to visually identify you. These enemies should be destroyed,al-
though the effort can  be counterproductive if the  attack generates lots of
additional sightings! Gratuitous  or wanton destruction of all other targets
is very bad in cold war.Hitting targets of value to the civilian sector,such
as bridges,oil wells and tanks,refineries,etc.,is especially bad.Your record
will rapidly accumulate black marks if you  act like "Rambo" during the Cold
War.After all,Rambo is fiction,this is reality!

LIMITED WAR SITUATIONS : ---------------------------------------------------
ROE : You will engage, attack, and destroy all targets specifically required
by your orders.In addition,all other targets with active weaponry(i.e.,which
could fire on your craft) may be attacked.You may engage these military tar-
gets even if they haven't seen you yet.You may never attack non-military tar
gets unless so required by orders. Neutrals must be considered friendlies at
all times,and in addition you should avoid detection by neutral aircraft and
radars at all costs.Background Notes:In limited war the State Department may
require deniability,since American aid to the contestants may need to be sec
ret.However,since there is a war, and military targets get destroyed in war,
you can attack military targets of opportunity and  be rewarded (rather than
penalized) for your efforts.However,hitting noncombatant targets of value to
the civilian sector (unless ordered to) is forbidden.

CONVENTIONAL WAR SITUATIONS : ----------------------------------------------
ROE : You`ll engage, attack,and destroy all targets specifically required by
your orders. In addition,any and all other targets in enemy territory may be
attacked,including civilian targets.If able to select additional targets,se-
lect those with immediate military capability first.Neutrals must be consid-
ered friendlies at all times, and in addition you should avoid  detection by
neutral aircraft and radars at all costs.Background Notes: In a conventional
war you are allowed unrestricted conventional attacks on enemy territory.Th-
is includes civilian targets formerly forbidden.However,targets with immedi-
ate military capability are more important.Therefore,destroying enemy aircr-
aft,airbases,SAMs,radars,depots,headquarters,etc.,gives more reward than br-
idges,oil refineries,oil wells and platforms,etc., whose importance is long-
term.This is because even conventional wars are  fought for short-term goals
(such as the Grenada invasion in 1983,or the Falkland Islands campaign of 19
84).However,from a pilot's  point of view,conventional  war is "fun" because
anything in enemy territory is fair game.Of course, the disadvantage is that
the enemy are prepared and alert for intruders.

ONC MAP COORDINATES : ------------------------------------------------------
ONC maps use the standard USArmy military grid system for locating positions
anywhere on the globe.The maps are divided into large squares.Each square is
identified by a two-letter code,such as WX,JC,etc.Within each square are sm-
aller rows and columns,ruled into smaller squares. These smaller squares are
identified by a column and row number from 0 to 9. Following the "read right
and up" rule,the column number appears first,then the row number.This is the
same as basic algebra,where the "x" horizontal value is given first,then the
"y" vertical value.For example,coordinate JC79 means large map square JC,co-
lumn 7,row 9.

MISSIONS : -----------------------------------------------------------------
AIR-AIR MISSIONS : ---------------------------------------------------------
SELECTING ARMAMENTS : In limited or conventional war situations the AIM-120A
AMRAAM is the missile of choice. You can lob these at enemies from a full 30
km range.If you're firing at a plane with close escorts,space the shots 5 to
10 seconds apart (the higher their altitude,the longer the spacing). This is
because a burning,exploding plane is a prominent target to the missile's se-
eker.If your missiles arrive right behind one another,those following may ho
me on the plane hit by the first. Worse,the terminal homing of the AMRAAM is
somewhat questionable-it tends to take the closest target at the time,rather
than the target you  originally designated ! Therefore, when shooting into a
group you can't count on which plane will be hit.Finally,if the enemy is ve-
teran or elite,don't be surprised if  the enemy manages to  outmaneuver your
missile by turning inside it.In cold war,guns are the weapons of choice.With
these you can insure the proper target`s hit,and no others.Unfortunately,get
ting close enough for a shot may  reveal your presence. A good compromise is
the AIM-9M Sidewinder,a fast-turning close-in dogfighting missile.It's usua-
lly easy to line up a 5 to 8 km shot,where the Sidewinder has a clear run at
the target and nobody else is likely to get in the way.

AMBUSHING A LEADER : Here an important personage is travelling by plane;your
job is to make sure he doesn't arrive!The plane takes off about the same ti-
me as your own.Remember that his plane is NOT the flashing dot on the satel-
lite/radar map (on your left-side cockpit CRT).That is his destination.Alth-
ough it's possible  to just fly to his  destination and wait, roving fighter
patrols or local air defenses eventually will spot you. In general,the wiser
approach is to find the best way to "sneak through" enemy patrols + SAM rad-
ars to intercept him en route. In limited/conventional war you can take down
his plane and escort with AMRAAMs.In a cold war situation you'll need to cl-
ose for a clean Sidewinder or gun shot.Remember, though, that if the fighter
escorts get a visual  ID on your plane you must zap them too. If your attack
location is well away from any ground radars or MainstayAEW&C planes,you can
attack from above, hit your man, drop a decoy to confuse them, and zoom away
with maximum speed at low altitude.

INTERCEPTING TERRORISTS OR COMMANDOS : In this  mission you know a transport
plane,accompanied by fighters,`ll head for friendly territory.Your objective
is to eliminate them before they arrive.The problem is, you don't know their
destination.As you take off,watch the enemy aircraft carefully.Circle around
a bit,observing their course until you can guess their objective.Once you kn
ow their goal, it's easy to pick a nice quiet spot to ambush them. Often you
can stay in friendly territory all the way!Properly executed,this mission is
a nice,easy milk run.

ELIMINATING A FIGHTER PATROL : Enemy fighter  patrols have a  nasty habit of
lurking near their own air defense systems,and/or being supported by Mainst-
ay AEW&C planes.Going in after them can cause quite a battle.One trick to a-
void the mess is to publicize your presence in a nearby area.You should pick
an area with little / no SAM coverage,and with no nearby airbases.If you can
lure the fighterpatrol to you,at this spot,the battle may be much easier.The
typical way to accomplish the lure is to raise your EMV (by flying high,tur-
ning on the ECM,and opening the bay doors). If that doesn't work, clobbering
a thing or two on the ground may catch  their interest. Once you've "dangled
the lure",it's wise to take a low profile again, so you can ambush the enemy
fighters as they arrive. As in many other aspects of modern warfare, getting
the first shot is a big advantage.

DESTROYING A RECON BOMBER : In most  cases you must  chase an enemy plane on
its way home.Catch + attack him as quickly as possible.The longer you delay,
the closer  he gets to SAM cover  and fighter aid. This is one mission where
climbing to a higher altitude can be rewarding-you travel faster, farther at
high altitude than low.Of course,don't go so high that you wake up the enemy
and attract lots of fighters and missiles.

ATTACKING A CRUISE MISSILE : These aircraft are most unobliging targets.They
cruise around deep behind their own lines,guarded by SAMs and closely escor-
ted by fighters. Given the defenses,attacking these planes is like hitting a
ground target.You need to sneak or punch your way through defenses,elude co-
unterattacks,and blast the primary,just like a strike mission.

TAKING DOWN THE MAINSTAY : The Il-76 "Mainstay" AEW&C plane is the most dif-
ficult aircraft target.Sooner or later its radar will see you,forcing you to
fight through fighters + SAMs to reach it. Make your approach as stealthy as
possible: it postpones this hour of reckoning. Destroying one or two crucial
SAM radar sites on your way in can be useful -it opens a radar-free corridor
to the target, and at the same time may draw off enemy interceptors, perhaps
even some of the Mainstay's fighter escort.

STRIKE MISSIONS : ----------------------------------------------------------
CHOOSING YOUR WEAPONS : Selecting armaments for ground attacks is always di-
fficult.The favorite weapon is the AGM-65D Maverick missile. It's your long-
est-ranged ground attack weapon (30 km;the Harpoon fires farther but is only
good against warships).The Maverick's also an accurate "fire and forget" wea
pon.Its weakness is that one missile can't always do the job.Fortunately,Ma-
vericks are just fine against radar installations. Most pilots carry as many
as they can afford, and fear the day when the crew chief  tells them no more
are available.Choosing between laserguided bombs,retarded bombs,and freefall
bombs is often a matter of personal preference.Many times more than one wea-
pon will do the job,so you can pick a type whose attack run suits your style
Other times you may be forced  to use a certain weapon  because nothing else
does the job right.When choosing weapons,don't expect much from a weapon ra-
ted C or D against a target.Scoring a hit with such always requires a lot of
luck.Certainly don't rely on such to take out your primary target.Weapons ra
ted A or B can be relied upon,provided you deliver them accurately.

SECRET AIRSTRIPS : Dropping off or picking up items deep behind enemy terri-
tory seems rather straightforward. After all, you don't have to fly into SAM
batteries or go head-to-head with fighter patrols.Instead, a secret airstrip
challenges your flying skill.You must manage a landing without an ILS to gu-
ide you.Worse,the strip is only half the length of a normal runway. You must
land gently,at low speed (under 160 kts, preferably), and touchdown near the
start.Otherwise you'll roll off the other end + crash!To make matters worse,
the strip's lights are only on for limited time. Make a note of the time the
lights go off,then periodically check the Waypoints screen on the right-side
CRT see how much time you've got.Once the lights are out landing`s virtually
impossible.If your opponents are skillful,their intelligence may have dange-
rous information about this mission.You could find enemy fighter patrols un-
comfortably close to your objective,or bouncing you just as you're trying to
land!

AIRDROPS: These missions are  usually milk runs. Your job is to avoid action
and just fly over a radiobeacon that's quite clear on your HUD.The only real
worry is reaching the beacon before it is turned off.Make a note of the turn
off time and periodically check the  Waypoints screen on the right-side CRT.
Once the beacon is off there's no way  to find the drop site. Be warned that
skillful opponents may have intelligence about this mission from their spies
You could find enemy fighter patrols lurking around the objective.If so, you
could attempt to lure them away,or blow them away,depending on your ROE.

PHOTO RECON RUNS : There are two hard things about photographic missions: u-
sing the camera,and keeping a low profile while you're doing it! Because the
135mm/IR camera is on a  fixed mounting, you must steer the plane to aim the
camera.This is more difficult than it seems, since the target swims into and
out of view all too fast.Experienced pilots advise you to line up on the ta-
rget 8 to 10 km away. Set up a perfectly straight course and keep to it.At 2
km to 4 km hit the bay doors and brakes,then pull the nose gradually up,bri-
nging the cameras aim onto the target.Keep in this regime,using subtle pitch
changes to keep the target in the camera,while snapping pictures. You've got
plenty of film: don't be afraid to take plenty of extras! Success is announ-
ced right on the CRT.As soon as you have it,close the doors and brakes, then
dive low for escape.Don't be surprised if the enemy spots you during the ph-
oto run.Photo runs over enemy troop concentrations and/or near SAMs are esp-
ecially nervewracking.You may need to take out a SAM radar before making the
run.If shoulder-fired SAMs infest the area,your only hope is to dump a decoy
before you start, run your IR jammer as long as you can, and/or periodically
dump flares.

FLYING AGAINST SAMS : Destroying a SAM  battery requires that you "sneak up"
on them as best you can, then nail his radar first  with a Maverick or HARM.
With the radar out of action,the missiles are helpless.Unless there are oth-
er SAMs nearby you can have  a strafing "picnic" with  the missile launchers
until a fighter patrol shows up. Remember that the safest place around a SAM
battery is directly above it.Radar cannot look straight up,and the longer-ra
nged missies (such as the SA-2,-5,-10 and -12) have  minimum range of 4 to 5
km.Of course, getting to this point can be rather tricky. It doesn't hurt to
run over the litany of defense techniques before going after a SAM: disappe-
aring,decoys,ECM,chaff and manuevering.

HITTING THE SUB PENS : The Severomorsk submarine  pens in the North Cape are
a unique and special target. These must be attacked by toss bombing from the
north:you must place an FAE through the sea doors.This means flying straight
at the mountain,pulling up at the last minute. You may wish to make your run
at 500' to 1,000',instead of 200'.This lets you begin the toss sooner (about
3 to 4 km away),giving you more leeway to clear the mountainside. Beware the
Krivak-class frigates that patrol seaward of this submarine base. Their rad-
ars and SAMs cannot be ignored! You'll want to bring along a couple of Peng-
uin-3 ASMs to eliminate these fellows.Even in Cold War,chances are good a Kr
ivak will get a radar "make" on you,forcing you to hit him.

SINKING SHIPS : The ideal ship-killer is the AGM-84A Harpoon. This heavy mi-
ssile is your longestranged weapon.It has a superb targetingsystem that hits
the ship you target,even a carrier with a ring of escorts.However,don't und-
erestimate enemy warships,especially those of the Russian Northern Fleet.The
larger ships have exceptionally good radars and very powerful SAMs.Patrol sh
ips can be knocked out with a single missile,but a task force has so many sh
ips that any close approach means you'll be dodging missiles left and right.
Most enemy ships stay close to friendly shorelines,with fighter cover nearby
(if not overhead already).Don't forget that enemy aircraft carriers have th-
eir own fighters: you can count on a few flying CAP (combat air patrol).When
fighting a conventional war with Libya,or in the Persian Gulf,be careful ab-
out attacking merchant ships. Avoid those on the high seas  or near friendly
coastlines ; only attack ships close to enemy ports or shore. Otherwise, you
could end up hitting a neutral ship by accident.

BOMBING RUNS : When attacking with  laser or free-fall bombs, you'll have to
rise above minimum altitude during the attack run.This,combined with the op-
en bay doors, raises your EMV considerably. Try to minimize this exposure as
much as possible.Remember,the higher your EMV, the better target you are for
enemy missiles.The longer you're a big target,the more chances the enemy has
to launch + hit you. The most frightening prospect is a bombing run directly
over enemy troop concentrations. There's nothing worse than a host of shoul-
der-fired SAMs rising up at you. These are on the one missile site you can't
knock out.Fortunately, they have a very short range. Still, flying through a
barrage of SA-14s,dumping a flare every two seconds, while trying to line up
a bomb,will turn your hair prematurely white.

LIBYA : --------------------------------------------------------------------
INTRODUCTION/POLITICS : Libya is ruled by Col.Mu'ammar al-Qadhaffi,leader of
the secret army organization that deposed the former king in `69.The capital
city is Tripoli and the nation's chief source of wealth is oil sold to west-
ern nations.

MILITARY FORCES: Rich by third world standards,Libya buys most of its armam-
ents from the Soviet Union.Personnel are trained by Soviet military advisors
but national pride has  prohibited (so far) any significant Soviet presence.
Soviet advisors are not invited on combat operations.The Libyan Army has ap-
proximately 60,000 men, Navy has 53 ships and 6,500 men, while the Air Force
has about 530 planes,30 combat helicopters,and 8,500 men.A paramilitary "Pan
African Legion" of about 10,000 also exists.In addition, Libya has built and
supported a variety of training camps for terrorist groups.

GEOGRAPHY : Libya`s a desert nation.Along the coast it has only one mountain
region that is visually distinctive: the Jabal al Akbar to the east of Beng-
hazi. These mountains greatly restrict the capabilities of Benghazi + Benina
radars.Deep in the desert, east of Sabha, are the more desolate and isolated
mountains of the Al Haruj al Aswad,while to the west are the great sandseas.

LEVEL OF CONFLICT : --------------------------------------------------------
COLD WAR : At times Libya has been enthusiastic backer of international ter-
rorist organizations.It provides funds,arms,military training, and base camp
sites for a variety of  Arab and other terrorist groups. America has already
attacked tactical military targets in retaliation for Libya's role in numer-
ous incidents of international terrorism in Europe and the Mediterranean.

LIMITED WAR : The Libyan army has fought minor  border clashes against Egypt
to the east.Egypt is an American ally,and so far has proved considerably su-
perior,militarily,to Libya.The Libyan army has also attempted an invasion of
Chad to the south.After a protracted campaign against Chad and her ally Fra-
nce, Libyan supply lines through the Sahara desert were cut,forcing a Libyan
retreat.Future limited wars between Libya and any of her neighbours are pos-
sible.

CONVENTIONAL WAR : In the even of NATO-Warsaw Pact conflict in the Mediterr-
anean and/or Europe, Libya is expected  to provide bases for Soviet aircraft
and warships operating in the Mediterranean.These bases could become the wes
ternmost outposts of Russian forces contesting the Mediterranean.

FRIENDLY BASES : -----------------------------------------------------------
SIGONELLA ON SICILY (UD15): The USA maintains a military base at Trapani, on
western Sicily,and the Sigonella military field in south-eastern Sicily.Sig-
onella runway  is the main staging point  for air attacks against  the North
African coast,especially Libya.Unfortunately, the flight distances are quite
long.Using this base virtually requires that your F-19 carry extra fuel.

CV AMERICA AT SEA (UD70): This  60,000-ton "Kitty Hawk"  class  conventional
aircraft carrier, designated CV66, often serves with the US 6th fleet in the
Mediterranean.It participated in the 1986  raids against Tripoli + Benghazi.
The carrier is ideally positioned for launching and recovering strikes agai-
nst Benghazi, the Gulf of Sirte, or targets deep in  the Libyan desert. Here
it cruises on a southerly course with its traditional ring of close escorts.
The carrier remains well north of the Gulf of Sirte to avoid SSM attacks fr-
om enemy ships and aircraft.It is surrounded by escorts and regularly reple-
nishes the CAP (combat air patrol) with F-18 launches.

NEUTRAL BASES : ------------------------------------------------------------
These airbases are in neutral territory.You shouldn`t use these bases unless
specifically so ordered,or if you must make an emergency landing.

SUDA BAY ON CRETE (VD41): This airfield,near the city of Khania,isn`t an Am-
erican base,although in years past it was a major NATO air and naval base.It
has the advantage of being both closer and less public than equivalent airf-
ields in Greece or Egypt.

HALFAR ON MALTA (UD13): This airfield is on the island of Malta.Once a crit-
ical strength position for  the British Commonwealth in the Mediterranean,it
is now a neutral port and sometime tourist haven.

SEEING THE SIGHTS IN LIBYA : -----------------------------------------------
Flying over Libya is a unique experience.It is a truly desert nation, a land
of red and brown hardscrabble with patches of tan sand and gray boulder fie-
lds.Water is all underground,seeping to the surface in occasional patches of
green oasis or mountain valley.Mountain ranges are low,undulating areas full
of small hillocks and short peaks. From the air  it's often hard to tell the
difference between again roadways and the dark wadis(gullies) in the desert.
But some works of man stand out, particularly the rust red  of oil wells and
pipelines,or the distinctive star-pattern of SAM batteries.

LIBYA : --------------------------------------------------------------------
TRIPOLI (TC87): The capital city of Libya has a large military-civilian air-
base at Idris,and is well protected by SAM batteries.Until recently these we
re long-range SA-5 Gammons, but there are indications  that Russian military
advisors may replace these with the formidable SA-12 Gladiator.Tripoli`s al-
so the site of a major army headquarters,various military depots,oil storage
areas, and sometimes terrorist training camps.Missile boats often cruise off
the coast.

SABHA (UB17): This southern town`s the main military base supporting Libya's
southerly border expansion.It was the major depot for the Chad war,and still
extremely important to Libyan trans-Saharan ambitions.The most important mi-
litary installations here are the large airbase and the SAM battery protect-
ing it.

MISRATAH (UC26) & SIRT (UC43): These two coastal towns are much smaller are-
as,with lower level military headquarters.The ports include oilstorage tanks
for refueling ships.Sirt is a secondary naval base, supporting missile boats
that cruise the western side of the "Line of Death".

RAS LANUF (UC82) & PORT BREGA (UC92): Ras Lanuf  is Libya's largest + newest
oil facility. The majority of all oil for export is stored here, and a large
number of oil tankers are usually coming and going at all times.There`s also
a refinery,vast "farms" of oil tanks,and a major military headquarters. Port
Brega is an older oil facility, still in operation despite the completion of
Ras Lanuf.SAM batteries are sited in this strategically vital area. In addi-
tion the Port Brega airfield,west of the town,serves both ports.

BENGHAZI (VC16): This city is the site of Libya's second-largest military ba
se, including the Benina airfield and powerful protective SAM batteries. The
city itself is large, with a military headquarters + a few small oil storage
facilites to serve the ancient port.Terrorist training camps aren`t uncommon
in the hills to the west.

AL BADYA (VC37): This sleepy coastal town in the mountainous  Jabal al Akbar
has major military significance. It overlooks the narrow  Ionian sea between
Libya and Greece, making it an ideal site for anti-ship missiles. There is a
small airstrip and SAM site as well.

OIL FIELDS : The great oilfields of Libya are in the southeast,where litera-
lly thousands of wells pump crude from the ground,which is piped to RasLanuf
and Port Brega. The great producing fields can be found  near Raguba (UC90),
Waha (VB18),Amal (VC30),Jalo Oasis (VC40),and Gialo (VB49).Most of the great
fields have a few storage tanks on site, to hold crude  temporarily until it
can be piped to the port. However, the majority  of storage tanks are at the
ports,not here on the fields.

SECRET BASES : Western intelligence  operatives in  Libya are  preparing two
secret,hardpack surfaces suitable for aircraft landings.One is at AlMukhayli
(ONC VC43),the other is on the edge of the great ergs, at Yafran (ONC TC93).

AIR DEFENSES : Libyan air defenses use Russian-built equipment. Russian adv-
isors train native Libyan crews, who then operate the equipment. SA-2 Guide-
line and SA-5 Gammon SAMs have been the backbone of Libyan air defenses, but
there are rumors of upgrades to the new SA-10 Grumble + SA-12 Gladiator sys-
tems.Local military forces make use of the SA-7 and SA-14 shoulder-fired mis
siles.These are also popular  terrorist weapons, and can  be expected in the
vicinity of terrorist camps,Libyan army units use various medium-range SAMs,
including the SA-8,-9,-11,and -13. However, these are not always in the best
state of repair.

AIR FORCE : ----------------------------------------------------------------
FIGHTERS : The Libyan Air Force is primarily  composed of MiG-23MF "Flogger"
fighters,with over 140 craft.It also has a smaller number of MiG-25"Foxbats"
for reconnaissance and  long-range interception, as well as  some antiquated
MiG-21s. The Air Force also has various Mirage 5D fighter-bombers for ground
attack missions.Intelligence expects that MiG-23s and 25s will be your prim-
ary air-to-air opponents,although in Conventional War, or against higher qu-
ality pilots,you may encounter the new MiG-29 "Fulcrum" flown by Soviet per-
sonnel.

RECONNAISSANCE BOMBERS: Although Libya does not possess any Tu-95 "Bear" re-
connaissance  bombers, Russian  planes of this type  frequently operate from
Libyan bases.

AIRBORNE EARLY WARNING & CONTROL: Libya has no AEW&C craft. No Russian Il-76
"Mainstays" are expected to use Libyan bases,since they are too precious. In
wartime Libya is a distant outpost in the middle of NATO's great strength in
the Western Mediterranean.Aircraft losses would be high - too high to permit
risking the rare and costly AEW&C craft.

AIR TRANSPORTS: It is suspected that Libya's antiquated  fleet of C-130H and
C-47 air transports (built in America) will be  replaced  with russian-built
equipment,perhaps including the new An-72 "Coaler" jet transport.

NAVY : ---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Libyan Navy is primarily  composed of Missile Corvettes + Missile Patrol
Boats. The largest of these are the 770-ton Russian-built  Nanuchka II class
armed with Styx surface-to-surface missiles, SA-N-4 surface-to-air missiles,
and a twin 57mm gun turret.The other boats include the Russian Osa-class,It-
alian-built Wadi M'ragh class and the French-built La  Combattante II types;
these have poorer missiles and SA-N-5 SAMs, or no SAMs at all. The Nanuchkas
are the best boats in the Libyan Navy. They perform the most aggressive pat-
rols,making them the primary threat. Patrols occur frequently in the Gulf of
Sirte,south of the "Line of Death".Sometimes the Libyan air force flies fig-
hter missions in support of the patrols.

THE PERSIAN GULF : ---------------------------------------------------------
INTRODUCTION/POLITICS : Iran has been ruled by Shi'ite (a Moslem sect) radi-
cals since their overthrow of the pro-American Shah in 1979.In September1980
Iraq attacked Iran, beginning a long, costly war between those nations. Both
contestants are viewed with  distrust by the Arab states  along the south of
the Persin Gulf. Iran's use of international terrorism as a  tool of foreign
policy has not improved the nation's image.Iran also calls for a Shi'ite re-
ligious revolution throughout  the Islamic world. This naturally bothers the
leadership of the Arab states,since their governments are Sunni (another Mo-
slem sect).However,Iran is populated by Persians,not Arabs.So far this cult-
ural and linguistic barrier has hindered the spread of Iranian Shi'ite radi-
calism across the Persian Gulf to the Arab states.

MILITARY FORCES : Under the Shah, Iran's oil-rich finances permitted massive
investment in military forces, mostly from the USA.Since the revolution many
complex weapons have failed for lack of spare parts and maintenance,while mo
st of the rest were damaged or destroyed in the war with Iraq. Iran has some
sophisticated aircraft and missiles remaining,but these are deployed to pro-
tect key cities in the interior,rather than as a border defense.

GEOGRAPHY : Iran is a large nation with varied geography.The Elbruz and Zag-
ros mountain ranges run from the northwest corner (where Iran touches Turkey
and the Soviet trans-Caucasus) diagonally southeast,along the border with I-
raq,and then parallel to the Persian Gulf.South of these mountains,at the he
ad of the Gulf,are Iran's oilfields.North of the mountains the nation is di-
vided into two regions.The western part,near Iraq, Turkey,and trans-Caucasus
Russia,is fertile,heavily populated, + includes most of the major cities and
industrial plants. The eastern part, bordering Pakistan,Afghanistan, and So-
viet Central Asia,is mostly barren deserts and mountains with a small,impov-
erished,undereducated population.

LEVEL OF CONFLICT : --------------------------------------------------------
COLD WAR : Iran's use of terrorism has been very effective to data.America's
confused policy respons, culminating in the Iran-Contra scandal,is one exam-
ple.However,eventually the continue violence may provoke a military response
from the Western nations.

LIMITED WAR : Iran and Iraq have been fighting a limited war since 1980. The
cities of Abadan and Basra,on the national border where the Tigris-Euphrates
rivers empty into the Gulf,are largely ruined by the fighting.Running north-
ward are two opposing lines  of trenches  and bunkers with a "no-man's land"
between. Each side attempted to discourage Persian Gulf shipping from aiding
the opposition, resulting in missile + rocket attacks on many freighters and
tankers. In 1987 and 1988 American fleet units  escorting oil tankers became
involved in surface battles with Iranian ships and boats,as well as an unfo-
rtunate civilian airliner that flew through a battle  area and was shot down
by the somewhat inept crew of the missile cruiser USS Vincennes.

CONVENTIONAL WAR : Russia could  invade Iran as part  of a wider NATO-Warsaw
Pact conflict,or as a counter to the Shi'ite radicals,who would like to spr-
ead their revolution to the USSR's Moslem population.America may be drawn in
to invading Iran by its confused  foreign policy. The vast and often hostile
geography,not to mention a large and hostile population,argue against tradi-
tional military invasions.Instead,a gradual escalation from limited war,inc-
luding bigger and deeper air attacks,is more probable.

FRIENDLY BASES : -----------------------------------------------------------
America's strongest allies in the Persian Gulf are Saudi Arabia and the tiny
island kingdom of Bahrain.

CV NIMITZ AT SEA (KY83) : This huge  80,000-ton nuclear carrier is the class
ship of the latest and most powerful program  of aircraft carriers. Normally
assigned to the Pacific Fleet,it`s prepared to visit the Indian Ocean at any
time.Here it sails with a close escort of destroyes,and has its F-18s on re-
gular rotation in CAP (combat air patrol). American aircraft carriers do not
sail into the restricted waters of the Persian Gulf,where they would be sit-
ting ducks for land-based air and missile attacks.Carrier task forces remain
in the Indian Ocean, although the Nimitz and her ring of  close escorts have
sailed deep into the Gulf of Oman, to provide a base as close as possible to
Persian Gulf targets.If threatened the ship can always sail to the southeast
and escape into the vast expanses of the Indian Ocean.

RAS AS SAFFANIYAH (JY19) : This is Saudi Arabia's northenmost oil terminal +
port along the Gulf. Its airfield is in a useful  strategic location. Basing
privileges for a secret "stealth" mission can be arranged with the pro-Amer-
ican Saudi monarchy.

DHAHRAM (JY54) & AL HUFUF (JY44): Dhahram is Saudi Arabias largest port city
on the Persian Gulf, making its airfield and  unwise choice for stealth air-
craft operations. However,the Al Hufuf airfield slightly inland is a strate-
gically useful and less public position for basing missions and raids.Either
can be used for stealth missions,but Al Hufuf is preferable.

AS SALAMIYAH (JY00) : This small airbase outside of  the capital Riyadh is a
nice, quite location where clandestine missions can be organized easily. Un-
fortunately,the gulf coast is far away.

BAHRAIN (JY65) : This small island nation is strongly pro-American,providing
large naval and air base facilities for American military forces.It`s fairly
easy to operate stealth missions from here.

NEUTRAL BASES : ------------------------------------------------------------
Kuwait is a friendly neutral nation,Oman is neutral but pro-Western, and the
UAE are studiously neutral.(At the time of writing/typing this,Iraq has just
invaded Kuwait,but America is being amazingly limp-wristed about it,and have
not offered military assistance, though Kuwait has requested it.USS Indepen-
dence is steaming towards the Gulf,but is unlikely to actually do anything!)

KUWAIT CITY IN KUWAIT (JZ12) : Originally neutral, Iranian threats + attacks
caused Kuwait to seek US military aid and support. The Kuwait airport can be
used to occasionally stage missions that demonstrate America's support to Ku
wait,or for emergency landings. However, Kuwait is fearful of provoking more
Iranian hostility,and therefore will not grant America basing rights.Kuwaits
great oil fields are south of the city,in ONC JZ20 and JZ30.

QATAR (JY75) : This small independent nation works hard at the appearance of
neutrality,probably because it has  strong pro-American + strong pro-Iranian
factions.Although missions can`t be staged regularly from here,it`s possible
to use the pro-American groups to aid in specific clandestine missions or em
ergency landing situations.

RUWEISS (KY01) & TARIF (KY11) : These small oil ports of the United Arab Em-
irates are not especially friendly to the American cause. Because the UAE is
a decentralized government,pressure and money in the right places could per-
mit a clandestine mission or emergency landing.Some of the largest oilfields
of the UAE are in this area (ONC KY22-23).

ABU DHABI (KY31) : Abu Dhabi is the major  city of the  United Arab Emirates
(UAE),where the appearance of neutrality is most important. Staging missions
or emergency landings from this base is very difficult,but not impossible if
Iranian diplomacy succeeds in making yet more enemies.

AL KHAFI AT DUBAI (KY65) : This large airfield, outside the city of Dubai,is
the most strategically useful of all UAE airfields.It is the base closest to
south-central Iran,and as such an important launching or retrieval point for
deep missions. However, as at Abu Dhabi, political  problems make the use of
this base difficult to impossible.

MUSCAT IN OMAN (KY90) : Oman is careful to remain neutral in all affairs,but
is strongly pro-Western. For example,much of its army is trained + officered
by "retired" British military personnel. The military  portion of the Muscat
airfield is available for missions and emergency landings,provided everythi-
ng remains secret and politically "deniable".

THE SIGHTS IN THE PERSIAN GULF : -------------------------------------------
The Persian Gulf is a desert region, not unlike Libya, except for the large,
high spine of mountains that runs diagonally through Iran from the northwest
to the southeast. However,water is more plentiful,especially in Iran,result-
ing in increased agriculture and a large number of local irrigation works to
control the seasonal run-off  from the mountain highlands. The Gulf has many
interesting + exceptional areas, such as the Tigris-Euphrates watershed that
reaches the head of the gulf around Abadan. Once a great seaport and teaming
metropolis,the destruction of the Iran-Iraq war has reduced the area to a ru
in of small towns and villages.Kharg Island,despite wartime attacks, remains
one of the great wonders of the world.Surrounded by oil platforms and super-
tankers,guarded by missile boats and fighter patrols, it remains the site of
numerous refineries + oil storage tanks.There are also great oilfields south
of Kuwait City,north of Bushehr in the Bandar-e-Rig,on Bahrain and Qatar,and
along the UAE coastline near Ruweiss + Tarif, as well as assorted individual
platforms along the Arabian Gulf coast.Another interesting region of Iran is
the great valley of Bandar-e-Lengeh and Bandar 'Abbas. Seasonal rivers, flo-
wing from the mountains,have formed a fertile valley floor that empties into
the Straits of Hormuz, the strategic doorway to the Persian Gulf. On the op-
posite side of the straits,the mountainous peninsula of Musandam knifes into
the straits,creating a narrow choke-point of naval traffic.

IRAN : ---------------------------------------------------------------------
UPPER KHUZESTAN TRIANGLE - DEZFUL (JZ38),MASJED SOLEYMAN (JZ47),AHVAZ (JZ37)
These cities are the main "rear areas" behind the Iraq-Iran battlefront.They
have a variety of SAMs. Although all originally had airbase facilities,it is
believed that only Masjed Soleyman's is still intact.

ABADAN (JZ24) : This city is located at the final junction of the Tigris and
Euphrates Rivers, just before they empty into the Persian Gulf.Numerous bat-
tles in and around this area have destroyed a large part of the city.The su-
rrounding countryside, once contained with dikes and irrigation projects, is
now reverting to a  poisonous marshland in the  aftermath of heavy fighting,
which included the use of poison gas.

BANDAR KHOMENYI (JZ44) : This is the  main Iranian military  base behind the
southern part of the Iran-Iraq front, and a major staging base  for military
supplies + munitions of all sorts.It has a large airbase,powerful SAM batte-
ries,and a major military headquarters.

BANDAR-E-RIG OIL FIELDS : These oil fields,clustered along the coast and in-
land hills (JZ61 and JZ71) are a key source of Iran's oil wealth.

KHARG ISLAND (JZ60) : This island is covered with refineries,oil storage ta-
nks, and port facilities for oil tankers. Until the Iran-Iraq war it was the
greatest oil terminal in the world. Repeated attacks have ruined many of the
facilities,but never all of them.Now protected by SAM batteries, and missile
boat patrols, it is still Iran's main port for oil export.Much of Iran's oil
wealth is slightly offshore. One of the heaviest concentrations of oil plat-
forms exists in the vicinity of Kharg Island. Beware that some platforms are
now used by Iranian Shi'ite "Guards" as military bases.

BUSHEHR (JZ80) : This important coastal city  was once a major oil port, but
is now completely overshadowed by neighboring Kharg Island.The military for-
ces on its airbase + the SAM batteries aren`t always first rate.However,it`s
home port for many Iranian frigates and missile boats that patrol the gulf.

SHIRAZ (KZ03) : This inland city, sited on a highland plateau, is one of the
largest Iranian cities.It is also the nerve center and main headquarters for
Iran's southern  military command - the forces  responsible  for the Persian
Gulf.There is an exceptionally large military airbase here,and it is usually
protected by a powerful SAM battery.

ESFAHAN (JZ89) : This inland city,nestled in a large col of the Zagros Moun-
tains,is the classic "gateway" to northwestern Iran. As a transportation and
population center it naturally boasts an  airfield, and SAM sites protecting
it.The current state of the Iran-Iraq war has a powerful effect on what sor-
ts of aircraft are based here.

YAZD (KZ38) AND KERMAN (KZ84) : These two cities are distant population cen-
ters on the edge of the Iranian deserts. Both cities are dominated by a str-
ong traditionalist sentiment, which in recent years has translted into ferv-
ent Shi'ite extremism. However,the huge war losses are causing many families
to reconsider their support for the Jihad.

BANDAR-E-LENGEH (KY57) : This western  city  on the Straits of  Hormuz has a
minor military base,including an airfield + SAM battery.However, its primary
function is civilian,serving the large oil fields in this area.Seasonal riv-
ers running from the mountains to the west  down into Bandar-e-Lengeh have a
variety of interesting road + rail bridges over them. Offshore Oil Platforms
are especially common in KY35-45.

BANDAR 'ABBAS (KY68) : This city is Irans major military base on the Straits
of Hormuz. Major Iranian Navy elements are based here, as well as the latest
SAMs and a large,well equipped military airbase.

SECRET BASES : Western intelligence operatives  in Iran are preparing 2 sec-
ret,hardpack surfaces suitable for aircraft landings.One is in the Shalamzar
valley(JZ67) in the Zagros Mountains,the other in the mountains south of Ke-
rman,at KZ82.

AIR DEFENSES : HAWK batteries are Iran's longest ranged surface-to-air miss-
iles.Nearly exhausted in fighting with Iraq,these weapons are formidable de-
fenders of Iran  once more. The reason? A large  shipment of parts and spare
missiles by Lt.Colonel Oliver North,USMC.He hoped to trade them for American
hostages in Lebanon.Iran got the missiles, the hostages remained in Lebanon,
and North resigned from the Marines Corps.Think about that when one fires at
you! Rapier batteries, sold by Britain to Iran, are fast,but shorter ranged,
and hindered by a fire controlsystem that is primarily visual,with the radar
intended originally as backup. The Rapier radar system  never approached the
quality or sophistication of the HAWK.In fact,in the Falkland Islands fight-
ing,the Rapier was surprisingly ineffective.The Tigercat, an antiquated Bri-
tish design,appears in less-important areas. Many Tigercat sites have little
or no radar,since the missile is designed for visual control.The Seacat is a
naval version of the Tigercat,found on Iranian Vosper Mk 5 type frigates. It
is somewhat more dangerous because the frigates have decent radar search sy-
stems.

IRANIAN AIR FORCE : --------------------------------------------------------
This service arm is composed  primarily of American-built  aircraft acquired
during the Shah's rule.Before the outbreak of the Iran-Iraq war the AirForce
had a nominal strength of 75 F-14 Tomcats,about 200 F-4D + F-4E Phantom IIs,
140 F-5E Tiger IIs,plus various other planes and helicopters,including C-130
Hercules transports and P-3F Orion reconnaissance bombers.

FIGHTERS : Iran lacks the sophisticated technicians + parts to keep its F-14
operational.Within a year after the revolution fewer than 5 were functional.
No missiles or parts exist  for the long-range  Phoenix AAM system, but some
F-14s still have functional longrange radars.F-14s can carry AIM-7F Sparrows
or AIMN-9H Sidewinders.The older but less effective F-4s and F-5s are easier
to maintain.These planes are the backbone of the Iranian fighting air force,
interaepting Iraqi raids,guarding rear areas and ships from attack, and occ-
asionally attempting a raid into Iraqi territory.Iranian fighters are equip-
ped with AIM-9H Sidewinders,one of the last + best first-generation IR AAMs.
The F-4 Phantoms (but  not the F-5 Tigers) are  designed to carry the AIM-7F
Sparrow,a long range radar-homing missile.

RECONNAISSANCE BOMBERS : Iran has few naval reconnaissance bombers, and most
of those are P-3C Orions  with inoperative  electronic gear. Such planes are
reduced to making visual patrols only - a waste of aviation fuel in a modern
warfare environment !  However, it's possible that long-range  Russian Tu-95
"Bear" bombers may make an appearance,flying from Afghanistan or Yemen.

AIRBORNE EARLY WARNING & CONTROL : Iran has no "AWACS" or other AEW&C aircr-
aft.Instead, the few operational F-14s are used in this role, since the F-14
has an extremely powerful air search radar.

AIR TRANSPORTS : Iran has a variety of small, medium + large air transports,
including  the American C-130 Hercules, German Fokker F.27, French Dassault-
Breguet Falcon 20, and Boeing 707  and 747 transport models. The exact types
available vary greatly,depending on the supply of spare parts + the presence
of knowledgeable mechanics.Given Iran's dislike of the West,some consider it
likely that she will shop in Russia for the  next transports bought, perhaps
the new and very flexible An-72 Coaler.

NAVY : ---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Iranian Navy has suffered greatly in the Iran-Iraq war,since most resour
ces go into the army  and air force. Many ships were damaged in the fighting
and remain unrepaired;others have deteriorated badly for lack of maintenance
The great naval base at Khorramshahr, near Abadan,was destroyed early in the
war + remains a ruin in no-man's land.It is believed that one or more of the
four Vosper Mark 5 frigates are still functional. These 1,100-ton ships inc-
lude a Seacat SAM surface-to-air missile system and a 4.5" gun turret. Occa-
sional patrols by  these or smaller  ships can be expected in  the region of
Kharg Island or in the Straits of Hormuz. If functional, the Vosper frigates
pose a significant military threat. Iran's Shi'ite "Guards" also man a large
number of fast motorboats.The crew carry rocket-propelled grenades to attack
shipping,and shoulder-launched IR SAMs to protect themselves from air + hel-
icopter attack.Virtually invisible,these "mosquitos" are a threat only to un
armed merchant shipping,or an aircraft unlucky enough to pass over the area.
These boats are based all along the Iranian coast,especially at Bandar 'Abb-
as,and from a variety of offshore oil platforms.

THE NORTH CAPE : -----------------------------------------------------------
INTRODUCTION/POLITICS : The North Cape area  is shared by four nations. West
to east,they are Norway,Sweden,Finland,and the Soviet Union. Their political
orientation parallel their geographic locations: Norway belongs to NATO,Swe-
den is a pro-Western neutral,neutral Finland accomodates the Soviets,and the
Soviet Union,of course,leads the Eastern bloc.

MILITARY FORCES : In terms of global politics, the North  Cape is the single
most important military region in the Soviet Union.Murmansk is Russia's only
year-round  open-sea access to  the Atlantic ocean. Russian SSBNs (ballastic
missile nuclear submarines), the heart of nuclear deterrence, sail from here
into the Atlantic and Arctic oceans.The Soviet Northern Fleet protects these
invaluable weapons,as well as maintaining a credible threat to NATO's Atlan-
tic lifelines.Norway fields a large,tough force tailored  for dogged defense
of its mountainous homeland.Reasonably well-equipped,the majority of the for
ces guard the populous  southern regions. The northern bases have only token
garrisons.Northern Norway seems more important to NATO than it is to the Nor
wegians, since important NATO air, naval and marine troop assets are planned
to reinforce this area in time of war. Sweden's armed forces are designed to
make the Russians (or anyone) think twice about violating that country's neu
trality.The forces are well equipped and well trained,with a nationwide res-
erve system that makes a large part of the citizenry part-time soldiers.How-
ever,the northern part of Sweden is almost unpopulated,so the defenses there
are considerably lighter.Recently Sweden has been greatly irritated by Russ-
ian midget submarines literally crawling around  inside her fleet bases, and
by a Russian dieselsub that ran aground in a harbour entrance while carrying
a nuclear-tipped torpedo (a serious insult to anti-nuclear Sweden). As a re-
sult,Sweden may be willing to support NATO  clandestine operations as a form
of revenge. Finland fields a much  smaller and less sophisticated force than
its neighbours. Although fiercly independent, Finland has learned to accomo-
date the desires of its powerful neighbour,the Soviet Union.The Soviets main
tain this "friendly"  attitude by garrisoning  powerful military forces near
the Finnish border, and strongly encouraging Finland  to buy Soviet military
equipment. So even if Finland could detect  F-19 overflights in its northern
regions, it's unclear whether it would bother  informing its "friend" Russia
immediately.

GEOGRAPHY : This entire region is a harshly cold climate. Northern Norway is
a long,mountainous country with a harsh climate and "iron" (rocky) seacoast.
In this terrain a small group of determined defenders could stop an army for
years. The "open" areas  of Finland and Sweden  are deceptive. On the map it
may appear to be an open plain, perfect for attack. In reality it's a frigid
wilderness in the winter and a vast,marshy bog in the summer.

LEVEL OF CONFLICT : --------------------------------------------------------
COLD WAR : Because of the potential threat posed by the Northern Fleet's sh-
ips and aircraft to the shipping lanes in the Atlantic,NATO and Russian for-
ces are constantly sparring with each other, testing the other's responses +
jockeying for position should hostilities break out. Officially at peace,the
two sides wage a covert conflict of intelligence gathering and military pos-
turing that can turn deadly at any instant.

LIMITED WAR : If Russian or American foreign policy was conducted with grea-
ter hostilty, the North Cape would  make an ideal place for Western raids of
retaliations against the Soviets. Similarly,their air and sea defences could
get excessively "trigger happy" and shoot before asking questions.Even among
men of good faith,there`s always a temptation to send in a secret mission to
"take out" something that really bothers you.Israel and South Africa,for ex-
ample,have surrendered to this temptation from time to time.

CONVENTIONAL WAR : The baloon's gone up.NATO and the Warsaw Pact are offici-
ally shooting at each other in this part  of Europe (perhaps elsewhere too).
The Northern Fleet is making a sortie  into the Atlantic, Soviet troops have
crossed the border into Norway,Mainstays and MiGs are clouding the skies.Now
missions are no joke at all.Getting in and out with your skin intact will be
very,very tricky!

FRIENDLY BASES : -----------------------------------------------------------
The two Norwegian land bases here are civilian airfields,but both are closer
to the Russian border than the NATO bases at Banak and Bardu. It is easy and
wise to stage stealth missions through  either Lakselv or Kautokeino, rather
than flying longer distances from more rearward fields.Such staging could be
just a quick landing and refueling both inbound and outbound. In effect, the
fields can function as grounded refueling tankers.

KAUTOKEINO (WX11) : Located in the barren tundra of the Finnmarksvidda,Kaut-
okeino airfield is well suited  for operations across  the top of Finland to
Murmansk. The population is very small and the  entire area well defended by
tundra swamps and bogs in the summer,or sub-zero blizzards in the winter.

LAKSELV (WX34) : Located at the inland  end of  the Porsangen Fjord, Lakselv
town has an airfield ideally suited to operations into Russia.It is far eno-
ugh from the border to survive the first few days of fighting,but close eno-
ugh for easy flying.

CV KENNEDY AT SEA (WX67) : In the middle 1980s the Secretary of the Navy an-
nounced a new policy -a wartime policy of sending aircraft carriers deep in-
to the Norwegian Sea,to challenge Russias fleet near its home ports.Although
considered  suicidal by some, this policy is certainly  useful for launching
stealth missions.Here CV67,one of the conventional carriers with the US Atla
ntic Fleet,makes a quick dash to the North Cape to launch your mission.As al
ways,the carrier is accompanied by a screen of escorts,and is constantly la-
unching and recovering a CAP of F-18s.

NEUTRAL BASES : ------------------------------------------------------------
Available neutral  bases in this region  are all Swedish. Sweden is strictly
neutral in international politics,but economically closely tied to the West-
ern bloc.Given recent events and aggressive Russian moves, it's not unlikely
that a few clandestine stealth missions, or emergency landings, would be al-
lowed at northern Swedish airbases.

KIRUNA (WW28) : The northernmost airfield in Sweden, this base is located in
the nearly unpopulated foothills of the  Esrange mountains. Stealth missions
could operate easily from this area, with nobody but reindeer to observe the
events.

GALLIVARE (WW26) : Although this airfield is also far north in Sweden,Galli-
vare town is a junction of rails and roads.In the summer months it is also a
popular tourist area,with the Muddus National Park  a few miles to the west.
Stealth missions operating from this base must be very discreet.

LULEA (WW13) : This fairly populous  city is the main Swedish  military base
in the Northern Region.It is also a port on the Gulf of Bothnia,the northern
most arm of the Baltic sea.

THE LAND OF THE MIDNIGHT SUN : ---------------------------------------------
North Cape is a  realm of extremes. In summer the sun  shines throughout the
night,while in winter  it never rises above  the horizon. The most northerly
areas are realms of tundra and permafrost - ground that remains frozen thou-
ghout the year,save for the top few inches in the summer. Only moss + coarse
grass grows here, although it can turn brilliant  green on good summer days.
The majority of the region is taiga,vast pine forests that are home to rein-
deer,artic fox,+ rock ptarmigan.The southerly lowlands are a deep watershed,
full of small lakes,marshes and bogs.The White Sea coastline is almost enti-
rely marsh as the land blends gradually into sea.The interior of the Kola Pe
ninsula has the characteristic mountains of a  tundra-taiga borderland: low,
rolling,rocky and bare,with pockets of snow even in summer.The Norwegian co-
ast has more dramatic terrain.Here is the topmost end of the spine of mount-
ains  that divides Norway from  Sweden. Even here they are still steep, bare
rock with clinging patches of ice and snow.Amid this monotonous,desolute te-
rrain are impressive human works,especially the city of Murmansk with its sp
rawling military complexes.Hideously expensive to build and maintain through
the long,deep winter, this region is surely the  most valuable military real
estate in the world,judging by money invested per acre!

NORTHWESTERN RUSSIA : ------------------------------------------------------
Murmansk (XX11) : This major city  is Russia's  only year-round  port on the
Atlantic ocean. Its great piers + depots support not only a steady stream of
merchant shipping,but the powerful Red Banner Northern fleet.Murmansk is li-
terally "at the end of the line", in this case a long railway line that runs
southward 700 miles to Leningrad.Murmansk is also the nerve centre of Russi-
as powerful airforces,including both PVO air defence planes and Naval Aviat-
ion of the Northern fleet. Satellite airfields  surround the city, including
large bases at Kildenstroy (XX10) and Kilpyaur (XX00).The Northern fleet in-
cludes,roughly,one aircraft carrier,75 other major surface warships,one mar-
ine brigade,133 submarines,and 446 naval aircraft.The protection of its bas-
es is the duty of 12 Divisions of  army troops (about 300,000 men total) and
150 planes of Tactical  Aviation (airforce planes supporting the army) + the
PVO (airforce interceptors guarding the border).The great Severomorsk (XX31)
submarine pens are also just outside of Murmansk.This underground base`s the
homeport for the new Typhoon class of ballistic missile subs,as well as many
other diesel and nuclear undersea craft.

PECHENGA (WX91) : This town is Russia's forwardmost military base in the far
north. Just a few miles from the Norwegian border,Pechenga is the inevitably
staging point for any invasion into NATO territory. Although it has an airb-
ase and strong SAM defenses,the Polyarnyy airbase complex to the east (in WX
80) is somewhat larger.

MONCHEGORSK (XW18) & OLENEGORSK (XW19) : These  two towns, near  the base of
the Kola peninsula,are major airbases for long-range naval aviation bombers,
as well as providing fighter and SAM cover to the railroad link between Mur-
mansk and the south.

KANDALAKSHA (XW16) : This small city is the main population centre at the ba
se of the Kola peninsula.It is primarily a transportation hub,with raillines
and a naval port that  faces eastward, into the White Sea. South of the city
lies the Loukhi(XW04) air defense complex,including a large SAM battery that
covers this section of the Murmansk-Leningrad rail line.

KEM (XW21) : South of Kandalaksha,Kem is the next significant city along the
Murmansk-Leningrad line.It too is a small port facing onto the White Sea. It
is also the starting point for the Voknavolok railline that runs westward to
the Finnish border. This is a  purely military line, intended to support the
Russian military presence on the Finnish border.

ARKHANGEL'SK (XW71) : This city is Russia's largest port on the Atlantic.Al-
though closed by ice during the winter,it has much better rail and road con-
nections to the interior of Russia,and is almost totally invulnerable to en-
emy attack. In addition to large port  facilities, the city is surrounded by
military defenses,the most notable being the complexes at Severodvinsk(XW51)
and Kushkushara (XW84).In addition,units of the Northern Fleet patrol offsh-
ore in the White Sea.

SECRET BASES : Western  intelligence  operatives in this area  have secretly
created two hardfrozen airstrips suitable for landings,one at XW57,the other
at XX20.

AIR DEFENSES : The Kola peninsula is vital to the SovietUnion because of the
access it affords to NATO's  lines of communications, but its very proximity
also makes it particularly vulnerable to  NATO counterstrokes. Consequently,
the Kola Peninsula is likely to prove one of the most challenging anti-airc-
raft environments in the  world today. In clandestine  missions it may prove
impossible to penetrate + escape this area  without eliminating at least one
radar system.However,you get lucky - the systems often shut down for varying
periods of time due to maintenance difficulties in this most rigorous of cli
mates.

LONG RANGE SAMS : These are area defense  weapons that, along with fighters,
are your primary opposition. The older SA-2s and SA-5s  have been undergoing
continual upgrade to SA-10 and  SA-12 quality. The entire system is enhanced
by the LPAR early warning system at Kirovsk.

LIGHT SAMS : Soviet ground forces in this area are  outfitted with the usual
battlefield SAMs, including the older SA-9 and SA-13 IR missiles, as well as
the newer SA-8 and SA-11 radar guided missiles.Mobile infantry carrying SA-7
and SA-14 shoulder-launched IR SAMs are a  significant threat as well. Check
out your intelligence briefing (preflight) for "special event" areas showing
the latest enemy troop concentrations.

THE PVO AND NAVAL AVIATION : -----------------------------------------------
FIGHTERS : This region is defended partly by the  PVO units, with long-range
MiG-25 and MiG-31 interceptors using long-range radar-homing AAMs.Naval avi-
ation fighters operating from either carriers or land strips include the Yak
38 V/STOL jet and the new Su-27 multi-purpose fighter.During wartime shorter
ranged units may arrive,including MiG-29 and SU-27 fighters with short-range
IR missiles as well as long-range radar weapons.All these planes but the Yak
38 are worthy opponents.The Yak can only carry IR homing missiles (generally
AA-8 Aphids).It`s considerably slower+less flexible than the other fighters.

RECONNAISSANCE BOMBERS : Many long-range Tu-95D "Bears" are based in this a-
rea,to keep tabs on NATO naval activity in the North Atlantic. A nuisance in
peacetime, these planes pose a serious threat  in a war. Eliminating them is
always a high priority in NATO war plans. That would  blind the Russian high
command to activities in the Atlantic and Norwegian seas.

TRANSPORTS : Russia possesses numerous air transports for  its huge force of
airborne units.The most modern of these is the jet propelled An-72 "Coaler",
which is particularly suited  to fast, high priority missions like inserting
commando teams or transporting critical command personnel.

AEW & C AIRCRAFT : The Soviets routinely deploy Il-76 "Mainstay" aircraft in
this region. The 300+ mile radars on this plane may be  your most formidable
enemy.If you're spotted and can't discover how or by whom,chances are it's a
Mainstay.

THE RED BANNER NORTHERN : --------------------------------------------------
Russia's Northern Fleet offers both tempting targets + a significant threat.
Its modern  Sovremennyy-class  destroyers carry  SA-N-7  missiles, while the
numerous Krivak-class  frigates carry SA-N-4. The  larger Kiev-class carrier
has the powerful SA-N-6, a sea-going equivalent to the SA-10. These warships
are more than capable of defending themselves.Stationed off the northern co-
ast, they significantly extend the Soviet anti-aircraft umbrella.In addition
to these ships' SAMs,the Kiev carries a complement of Yak-38 "jump-jet" figh
ter aircraft.While less capable than ground-based fighters, the British Har-
riers in the Falklands  taught the world not  to underestimate the capabili-
ties of such planes.An upcoming addition to the northern fleet is a class of
huge  aircraft  carriers fitting out  in the Crimea. Tentatively  titled the
"Kremlin" class, these ships are  expected to  join the Northern Fleet soon.

CENTRAL EUROPE : -----------------------------------------------------------
INTRODUCTION/POLITICS : Central Europe is where the full force of East +West
meet.Since World WarII Europe has been two hostile Blocs,with a few neutrals
balanced between.On one side are the communist East European nations,created
in the wake of Soviet armies at the end of WWII.On the other side are democ-
ratic Western European nations,created by the USA and Britain in the wake of
their armies during WWII.Since 1949 the West has been linked by NATO.In 1955
the East formalized an equivalent organization, the Warsaw Pact,dominated by
the USSR. From then to now the two  greatest military organizations on earth
have uneasily eyed each other along the German border.

MILITARY FORCES : The Warsaw Pact can deploy almost three million men, about
80,000 armored fighting vehicles,and 6,000 combat aircraft.Against this Jug-
gernaut, the Western powers can field around  two million men, 40,000 AFV's,
and 4,000 combat aircraft.The numerical imbalance is partially offset by the
higher quality of the Western troops and equipment,presumably along with the
traditional advantages of being the defender.Together,the two sides have al-
most ten thousand nuclear weapons for battlefield use in Europe. These range
from small, sub-kiloton shells designed to wipe out troop concentrations, up
to multi-megaton city busters.Artillery,planes,and missiles of all types and
ranges can deliver these weapons.At one time NATO felt it had to use nuclear
weapons to compensate for numerical inferiority. Today it has an alternative
plan: Air-land battle,2000. In this NATO uses superior technology, including
its stealth planes,to attack deep in the rear of the Warsaw Pact armies,des-
troying their logistical support.If this innovative strategy works NATO need
not use nuclear weapons to stem the Red tide.However,if this fails,NATO must
choose between a  nuclear holocaust and the conquest of Europe by the Soviet
Union.

GEOGRAPHY : The Central Front stretches 1000km through the middle of Germany
bordered on the north by the Baltic Sea,and on the south by the Alps.The in-
itial strategic  objective of a  Russian invasion would almost  certainly be
the Rhine river,only 150 km from the frontier (at the closest point).West Ge
rman terrain is mildly favourable to the defender,especially in the forested
and hilly southern half.The broad,flat North German Plain is the traditional
invasion route.But every few kilometers there is a new town,village or city.
Each could become a new defensive bastion.One often neglected geographic co-
nsideration is the terrain to the east of the frontier. With the development
of the "Air-land battle" this  region takes on a new significance. The North
German plain broadens vowards the east,encompassing most of East Germany and
Poland.It is crossed by a number of major rivers flowing northward, channel-
ing road and rail traffic into a variety of bridges.This combination of open
countryside and numerous "choke points" is well suited to air operations.

LEVEL OF CONFLICT : --------------------------------------------------------
COLD WAR : This is the situation of the last 40 years.The two sides maintain
a wary posture,generally trying to avoid overt provocations,probing each ot-
her to gain information,stir discontent in the enemy population,and gain ps-
ychological advantages.The stealth fighter,designed for clandestine penetra-
tion,is the perfect aircraft for the secret operations common in this situa-
tion.

LIMITED WAR : Now the conflict is  at the brink of  open warfare, but armies
have not yet crossed any borders. As military acts escalate, the opportunity
for stealthmissions increases as well.Military actions are political signals
that urge the other to back away in forceful terms. Unfortunately, sometimes
fighting just escalates.This technique was successful for America on Grenada
and against Libya,but it failed in Vietnam.Well,you're just a stealth pilot,
carrying out orders.

CONVENTIONAL WAR : This is it!Russian tanks pour over the West German border
while NATO forces scramble to stem the onrushing tide.On one side lies conv-
entional defeat,on the other the disaster of thermonuclear war.Air-land bat-
tle,2000 goes into effect.Stealth aircraft,airmobile raiding groups,and long
range smart munitions make the  dangerous crossing over  the front to hammer
Soviet rear echelons. If they can isolate the Russian  spearheads from their
base,they may give the politicians an opportunity to avert disaster.

FRIENDLY BASES : -----------------------------------------------------------
West Germany,Holland,and Denmark are studded with airfields that could serve
as bases for stealthraids into Eastern Europe.They form a gentle,north-south
crescent bulging west in the middle.Which is the most suitable startingpoint
for a particular airstrike depends mainly on the location of the target.How-
ever, the stealth fighter's unique characteristics will be most affective in
the areas only thinly  covered by radar  to the north  and south of the main
arena.Therefore,deep penetration raids`ll usually start from Denmark or Sou-
thern Germany. Shorter tactical strikes, however, must fly directly into the
mouth of the tiger.

JUTLAND PENINSULA - VANDEL (CC52) & LECK (CB59): These  far  northern  bases
make ideal jump-off points for raids out across the Baltic.Often it's easier
to deal with missileboats in the Baltic than the heavier SAMdefenses in East
Germany and Poland.

NORTHERN GERMANY (Hanover) - AHLHORN (CB37) & GUTERSLOH (CB53): These bases,
directly behind BAOR(British Army Of The Rhine),face across the flat,densely
populated North German Plain,the most likely axis of advance should the War-
saw Pact attack NATO. Therefore, they represent the most direct route to one
of the greatest concentrationq of hostiles in the world.

CENTRAL GERMANY(Westphalia) - RHEIN-MAIN(CB52) & RAMSTEIN(CB50): These bases
are the great,famous bases of American air power in Europe.Rhein-Main is one
of the largest  military  bases in the world, while Ramstein is headquarters
for the 4th Tactical Air Force.

SOUTHERN GERMANY(Bavaria) - NEUBERG(CA68),LEIPHEIM(CA57) & MEMMINGEN (CA65):
These bases are all Luftwaffe (air force of the Federal Republic of Germany)
but like many German bases,are entirely willing to host American circraft as
needed.Any of these bases makes an excellent jumpoff point for missions into
Czechoslovakia.

SIGHTSEEING FROM THE BALTIC TO BOHEMIA : -----------------------------------
Without doubt, the most impressive sights in this region are  the vast urban
metroplexes,from the northern ports of Hamburg(CB67) and Lubeck(CB77) to the
old cities of Leipzig(CB82) or Warsaw(DB95),or the industrial sprawl of Pra-
gue(DB30) and Krakow(DB90).Those northern areas not covered with cities,tow-
ns or villages are ditided into small plots of farmland. Much of the area is
watered by extensive river systems flowing northward.Bridges large and small
are common near cities.An especially impressive suspension bridge can be fo-
und on the southwestern outskirts of Hamburg(CB67).The southern part of this
region is dominated by low mountains that virtually surround the Czechoslov-
akian lowlands of Bohemia(to the west) and Moravia(to the east). The valleys
and passes amid the mountains provide numerous natural routes, and not c few
flying challenges.Although much of the highland areas were once forested, in
the last few decades  acid rain has  denuded many areas and  started rampant
erosion.The once green mountains are now more frequently brown,gray,and bla-
ck.The much higher Alps, capped by perpetual snow, are generally obscured by
haze to the southwest.

THE EASTERN BLOC : ---------------------------------------------------------
EAST GERMANY : During a limited or conventional war the main strength of the
Warsaw Pact forces will travel  through here, surging into West Germany. The
greates natural  barrier in East Germany is the Elbe River, running from the
Czechoslovakian mountains northward to Hamburg.Destroying these riverbridges
would cut off the Pact's forward troops from their supply lines.Covering the
Pact's forward areas are two main airdefense complexes,one in the north near
Wittstock(CB97) and Wittenburg(CB87),another in the south just east of Leip-
zig and Magdeburg,including the big radars at Mittenwalde(CB93) and Grossen-
haim(CB92).

POLAND : In a NATO-Pact confict Poland is the "rear area" through which Rus-
sian troops and supplies would flow toward the front lines.Many important he
adquarters and depots are situated in the central and western part of the na
tion.The Wista-Vistula river system divides Poland in half,from north to so-
uth.Destroying the road and rail bridges can seriously damage Pact operatio-
ns.Polish defense complexes include a powerful system west of Gdansk at Stu-
psk(DB48),and south of Lodz at"Radom(DB83).In addition,Warsaw(DB95) is a ma-
jor transportation hub, so active SAM batteries can be expected in that area
during wartime.

CZECHOSLOVAKIA : This Pact nation, seperated from Germany by the mountains +
the rugged highlands of the BohemianForest,is likely to play a secondary ro-
le in wartime. Czechoslovakian defenses are also somewhat lighter than those
of East Germany and Poland.Tabor(DA38) is the most significant installation.
Far to the east,guarding the entrance to Hungary and southern Pmland,is ano-
ther defense complex at Konmamo(DA87).

KALINGRAD : This region of Russia,named after the major seaport of Kalingrad
renamed from Konigsberg in 1945,at DB89,is the Soviet front line on the Bal-
tic. It includes a major OTH (over-the-horizon) radarstation at EB09,as well
as the Klaipeda airbase(EC02).

AIR DEFENSES : Since the Central Front forms the focal point of the war, the
anti-aircraft defenses on both sides are the most intensive in the world.The
Soviets are certain to deploy large quantkties of their most modern weapons,
SA-10s + SA-12s,for area defense.In some areas the older,less effective SA-5
long range systems may still be in place.Radar guided SA-8s + SA-11s are the
most commonly used for more local defenses,especially near important milita-
ry concentrations or objectives.A few are even sited near the larger SAM bat
teries to provide local defense.The shorter-ranged infrared SA-9s and espec-
ially SA-13s may appear instead if the radar-guided weapons are not availab-
le.At sea the @altic  missile boats  typically have  either SA-N-5 or SA-N-7
systems,although Krivaks and larger ships with the SA-N-4 can be expected in
wartime.The whole region is alive with lethal metal.The most dangerous areas
will undoubtedly be on or  near the front lines in West Germany, and perhaps
at any invasion sites in Denmark.Also beware of reserve troop concentrations
in East Germany or Poland. But these are relative assessments, not absolute.
Let down your guard anywhere and your aircraft will undoubtedly follow.

AIR FORCES : ---------------------------------------------------------------
The Soviet Air Force is the largest in the world,and one of the most modern.
It deploys a wide variety of interceptor, bomber, and support aircraft. Some
are obsolescent,but many can meet the best of the West. The Soviets know the
value of air superiority.They'll give high priority to that goal in any Euro
pean war.

FIGHTERS : As always,the primary foe is another pilot.With 6,000 combat air-
craft to chose from,you can bet that the Red AirForce`ll find a few to spare
for you.They'll also have the hot new models.If you're lucky,you'll only see
second-line MiG23s,but more likely you'll encounter quality dogfighters like
the MiG-29 and Su-27. In the rear areas you're more likely to see long-range
interceptors like the MiG-25 and MiG-31.

BOMBERS : The Russians have many  different bomber aircraft. One of the most
troublesome is the Tu-95 "Bear" modified to carry cruise missiles. Keeping a
number of these craft in orbit deep behind Russian lines gives them an unto-
uchable airborne nuclear force.Your job as an F-19 attacker is to prove that
this nuclear weapon can be hurt too.

AIRBORNE EARLY WARNING & CONTROL : The Soviet Il-76 "Mainstay" AEW&C was de-
signed for work in this kind of  environment. Flying "racetrack" orbits deep
behind friendly lines,its powerful radars can see NATO airoperations develop
and radio appropriate orders to various fighter squadrons.The effort to dev-
elop these planes has been long and costly; the sixe,weight + expense of the
electronic gear  is gigantic. Each plane is precious. Eliminating them would
cripple Soviet air operations. Pact appreciates this too, so getting to them
won't be an easy job.

TRANSPORTS : Thousands of air transports will shuttle back and forth on both
sides of the front line,carrying troops,raiding parties,munitions,staff off-
icers,etc. The new Russian  workhorse that flies anywhere and carries almost
anything is the An-72"Coaler".Its high speed and short-field capability make
it the natural choice for secret missions,and a natural target for your ste-

NAVAL FORCES : -------------------------------------------------------------
The Russian Baltic fleet,headquartered at Baltiysk outside of Kalingrad,con-
trols 4 cruisers,16 destroyers,7 Krivak-class large frigates,22 missileboats
and other light warships,and 21 amphibious assault ships,as well as 45 subs.
It also controls the East German and Polish navies,which have numerous addi-
tional frigates and missile boats.Tjis force has two goals:to cover the nor-
thern flank of the Warsaw Pact from air attack, and to invade Denmark in the
event of war.Stealth missions will generally deal with the former,your prob-
lem being how to penetrate the  warship screen in the Baltic. Because of the
many confusing classes of Russian, Polish  and East German missile boats and
frigates,it's always wise to check the  data on a ship. The SA-N-5 is just a
first generation IR homer,and no serious threat. The SA-N-4 uses older pulse
radar gukdance,but the new SA-N-7 is a more serious problem.Fortunately very
few Baltic warships carry the powerful,long-ranged SA-N-10.

KEY TO USAF ORDNANCE SUMMARY : ---------------------------------------------
The M61A1 cannon is fixed in the nose and always available.
QTY              : The number of weapons of this type the aircraft can carry
                   in one of the bay positions (you have four).
WEAPON           : The name of the weapon.
MAX RANGE        : Maximum range at which the weapon can be launched / fired
                   most effectively. A 0km range means the weapon is a free-
                   fall/retarded bomb  that must be dropped onto the target.
MAX SPEED        : The speed at which the weapon reaches the target. This is
                   given in knots so you can compare it with your own flight
                   speed.GLIDES means the weapon 'flies' without power.There
                   fore your speed, at the time of launch, becomes the speed
                   of the weapon.RETARDED means the weapon is a retardedbomb
                   that falls away behind the craft,decelerating as it drops
                   Some retarded weapons even  open a parachute during their
                   descent,to stabilize the fall and line up the warhead(s).
                   FREE FALL means the weapon is a traditional freefall bomb
                   that arcs downward to the target.
GUIDANCE SYSTEM  : If the weapon has an onboard targeting system,it`s menti-
                   oned here for general intereqt.
ATTACK ALTITUDE  : The recommended altitude for the typical attackmethod.The
                   "500+" entry means any altitude above 500feet is fine.The
                   "500'c" entry means that a toss-bombing technique is used
                   where the bomb is launched while  the plane climbs to 500
                   feet.
ATTACK TECHNIQUES: This references the appropriate attack technique. Techni-
                   ques noted in second place (e.g. toss/level; level is the
                   one we mean here) are  alternate attack  methods that are
                   either more dangerous or more difficult to learn.See "How
                   to Fight" earlier and "Air-to-Ground Tactics" for more de
                   tails.

KEY TO AIR-TO-AIR MISSILES (AAMs) : ----------------------------------------
SYSVEM NAME     : The name of the missile system.
PLANE           : Type of plane which  can carry  the missile. If a specific
                  plane is listed, only those planes can carry that missile.
                  Aircraft listed are restricted to those commonly encounte-
                  red.ANY USA means any plane of the USAirForce,but not cur-
                  rent or former American allies.ANY WESTERN means planes of
                  a western-allied nation, including former  American allies
                  such as Iran,or neutrals such as Sweden.ANY USSR means any
                  plane of a USSR-allied nation,including such Soviet allies
                  as Libya,Finland,Iraq,East Germany,Czecholslovakia,Poland.
GUIDANCE SYSTEM : How the missile  finds its  target. SAPR means Semi-active
                  Pulse Radar.This requires that the launching plane contin-
                  ues to paint the target with radar until the missile hits.
                  ADR means Active Doppler Radar.The missile has its own ra-
                  dar set,allowing the plane to fire and forget.In addition,
                  the missile's doppler radar is only fooled by chaff if the
                  target plane generates a small doppler (by running perpen-
                  dicular to the missile's course).IR1 means Infra-Red(First
                  generation). Missile is a first generation infrared homer.
                  It chases the hot engine exhaust only,and is easily fooled
                  by jammers and flares.IR2 means Infra-Red (Second generat-
                  ion).The missile is a second generation infrared homer. It
                  aims at any hot part of a plane, including the nose, wings
                  and tail as well as the engineexhausts.It can recover from
                  jamming and continue seeking a target.
EFFECTIVE RANGE : Maximum range at which the missile can lock on to a target
MAXIMUM SPEED   : Launching speed of the missile. Mach 1 is about 660 knots.

KEY TO SURFACE-TO-AIR MISSILES (SAMs) : ------------------------------------
NAME            : The commonly used name of the system.
MOUNTING        : How the system operates when seen.Site means fixed missile
                  launchers are positioned around a central radar station in
                  a "star" pattern. Vehicles means the missile launchers and
                  radars are mounted on vehicles.Vehicles are usually parked
                  on open ground in an irregular pattern. Radars and missile
                  launchers are on  seperate vehicles, so they remain fairly
                  close together. Vehicles sometimes have both radars + mis-
                  siles.Although a battery usually has 2 to 4 vehicles,often
                  widely dispersed.Warship means the radar and missile laun-
                  cher are mounted on a warship.Infantry means the missile`s
                  man-packed,and therefore carried by ground military units,
                  including installation guards, as well as by well-equipped
                  terrorists.
SEARCH GUIDANCE : The type and quality of search  radar used by the missile.
                  Eyesight is a very poor search method.Doppler Radar measu-
                  res the change in range; it is most effective when you fly
                  toward or away from it,least effective when you arc around
                  it at a constant distance. Pulse Radar bounces signals off
                  a surface;it is most effective when you fly sideways to it
                  least affective when you fly straight at it.
SEARCH RANGE    : The theoretical maximum range of the search radar.However,
                  against your F-19 radar performance is greatly reduced.The
                  quality of the radar + local conditions determine its real
                  effective range.
FIRING GUIDANCE : The way the missile finds your aircraft. Pulse and doppler
                  radars have varying effectiveness depending on your flight
                  path in relation to the missile.BRPR means BeamRider pulse
                  radar;the missile uses pulse radar guidance,with the radar
                  receiver at the launching site.It cannot "burn through" ja
                  mming at close range.SAPR means SemiActive pulse radar;the
                  missile uses pulse radar guidance, with the radar receiver
                  in the missile. Therefore it may "burn through" jamming at
                  close range.SADR means Semi-Active doppler radar; the mis-
                  sile uses doppler  radar guidance, with the radar receiver
                  in the missile. It too can "burn through" jamming at close
                  range.SACGDR means SemiActive with CommandGuidance doppler
                  radar;the missile uses doppler radar guidance,with the ra-
                  dar receiver in the missile. It can "burn through" jamming
                  at close range. In addition it  has  command guidance that
                  permits multiple attacks should the first attack miss. IR1
                  means IR homing (first gen.);the missile uses infrared ho-
                  ming that seeks hot exhausts.It is very vulnerable to both
                  jamming and flares. IR2 means IR homing (second gen.); the
                  missile uses infrared homing  that seeks  any hot surface,
                  including nose,wing  edges,tail,etc. It has logic circuits
                  that help it recover from  jamming or flares. Visual means
                  the missile is guided by a controller on the ground,who mu
                  st watch your plane and react to your maneuvering.
FIRING RANGE    : Maximum range at which the missile is fired.
MAX SPEED       : Maximum speed in flight of the missile. Mach 1 is 660 kts.
MAX ALT         : Maximum altitude the missile can reach.
MANEUVERABILITY : The turning ability of the missile in flight.

PURPOSE          : Very short range general purpose gun
QUANTITY         : 1 fixed internally
EFFECTIVE RANGE  : 3 km
MAXIMUM RANGE    : 6 km
ATTACK TECHNIQUE : Tracking camera/laser historical gunsight

NOTES : This six-barrel gatling-gun type cannon is the  standard internal ar
mament of most US fighters today,including the F4,F14,F15,F16 and F18.It can
fire 6000 rounds a minute,a high rate of fire that increases the chance that
a shell will be in the "same piece of sky" as the target aircraft.Of course,
this rate of fire also means that a wise pilot must fire in short bursts (o-
therwise he'll quickly exhaust all his ammunition).
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME             : AIM-9M "Sidewinder"
PURPOSE          : Short range air-to-air missile with infrared homing

MANEUVERABILITY  : Very good
ATTACK TECHNIQUE : Air-to-Air "fire and forget"

NOTES : This is the West's first radar-guided fire + forget missile.The AMR-
AAM(advanced medium range air-to-air missile) has its own internal guidance,
onboard TrackWhileScanning radar,and computerized target discrimination.Pre-
production + early production models are becoming available to Stealth units

ENEMY CANNONS : ============================================================
NAME             : M61A1 20mm "Vulcan"
PURPOSE          : Very short range general purpose gun
EFFECTIVE RANGE  : 3 km
MAXIMUM RANGE    : 6 km
ATTACK TECHNIQUE : Radar predicting gunsight

NOTES : This gun is carried  by  Iranian F4 Phantom and F14 Tomcat fighters,
which were purchased from the USA in the 1970s, when Iran was still an Amer-
ican ally.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME             : GSh-23 23mm Cannon
PURPOSE          : Very short range general purpose gun
EFFECTIVE RANGE  : 3 km
MAXIMUM RANGE    : 6 km
ATTACK TECHNIQUE : Radar predicting gunsight

NOTES : This is the standard aerial cannon of USSR built aircraft.It`s a tw-
in-barrel design that fires about 3000 rds/min.Range is equivalent to the US
weapon.The slow rate of fire (compared to the American M61) makes  it a less
effective weapon.A 6-barrel version with a rate of fire equivalent to the Am
erican weapon may arm the MiG-29 and/or Su-27.

ENEMY IR AAMS : ============================================================
NAME             : AIM-9H "Sidewinder"
PURPOSE          : Short range air-to-air missile with infrared homing
EFFECTIVE RANGE  : 12 km
MISSILE SPEED    : Mach 3+
MANEUVERABILITY  : Excellent
ATTACK TECHNIQUE : Locks onto tail exhaust,then "fire and forget"

NOTES : This was the most advanced model Sidewinder sold by America to Iran.
The missile is solid, reliable and easy to maintain. Admirable features that
unfortunately means it must be taken seriously by American planes flying ag-
ainst Iran.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME             : AA-2 "Atoll"
PURPOSE          : Shopt range air-to-air missile with infrared homing
GUIDANCE         : First generation infrared seeker
EFFECTIVE RANGE  : 14 km
MISSILE SPEED    : Mach 2.5
MANEUVERABILITY  : Very good
ATTACK TECHNIQUE : Locks onto tail exhaust,then "fire and forget"

NOTES : This early 1960s vintage IR missile is  now obsolete. However,it was
produced in vast quantities and sold throughout the world to Soviet clients.
As a result,it is still carried by aircraft of poorer nations,as well as the
second-line planes of larger and richer nations.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME             : AA-6 "Acrid" (IR)
PURPOSE          : Medium range air-to-air missile with infrared homing
GUIDANCE         : First generation infrared seeker
EFFECTIVE RANGE  : 50 km
MISSILE SPEED    : Mach 4
MANEUVERABILITY  : Poor
ATTACK TECHNIQUE : Locks onto tail exhaust,then "fire and forget"

NOTES : Designed exclusively for the MiG25 interceptor,this missile is an IR
version of the powerful AA-6 radar homer.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME             : AA-7 "Apex" (IR)
PURPOSE          : Medium range air-to-air missile with infrared homing
GUIDANCE         : First generation infrared seeker
EFFECTIVE RANGE  : 34 km
MISSILE SPEED    : Mach 3
MANEUVERABILITY  : Fair
ATTACK TECHNIQUE : Locks onto tail exhaust,then "fire and forget"

NOTES : This Missile is an IR version of the AA-7 radar guided AAM.It is mo-
st commonly found on MiG-23s.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME             : AA-8 "Aphid"
PURPOSE          : Short range air-to-air missile with infrared homing
GUIDANCE         : Early second generation infrared seeker
EFFECTIVE RANGE  : 12 km
MISSILE SPEED    : Mach 3
MANEUVERABILITY  : Excellent
ATTACK TECHNIQUE : All-aspect lock on,then "fire and forget"

NOTES : This small,lightweight missile is a pure dogfighting missile. Altho-
ugh its IR seeker may be inferior to the AIM9M it`s considerably superior to
earlier Soviet designs.This missile is replacing the now obsolete AA2,and is
carried by just about every Soviet-built fighter,interceptor and combat hel-
icopter now in service.Soviet clients within Europe have the weapon,as do an
increcsing number of client states and customers around the world.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME             : AA-10 "Alamo" (IR)
PURPOSE          : Medium range air-to-air missile with infrared homing
GUIDANCE         : Second generation infrared seeker
EFFECTIVE RANGE  : about 64 km
MISSILE SPEED    : Mach 3+
MANEUVERABILITY  : Good
ATTACK TECHNIQUE : All-aspect lock on,then "fire and forget"

NOTES : This missile is the IR  version of the AA-10. It may be the longest-
ranged second-generation IR missile in the Soviet inventory today.

ENEMY RADAR AAMS : =========================================================
NAME             : AIM-7E "Sparrow"
PURPOSE          : Medium range air-to-air missile, semi-active radar homing
GUIDANCE         : Semi-active radar homing (radar guidance from plane)
EFFECTIVE RANGE  : 44 km
MISSILE SPEED    : Mach 3.7
MANEUVERABILITY  : Very good
ATTACK TECHNIQUE : Semi-active radar guided from launching aircraft

NOTES : Nicknamed "The Great White Hope"  because of its  prominent exhaust-
plume,this missile was Americas standard radar AAM in the 1960s + 1970s. The
missile is not especially accurate,and depends on a close match with the fi-
ring aircraft's radar.Both the missile and radar demand regular and exacting
maintenance.Although Iranian F-4s have this weapon,all these drawbacks grea-
tly compromise its effective ness.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME             : AA-6 "Acrid" (Radar)
PURPOSE          : Long range air-to-air missile,semi-active radar homing
GUIDANCE         : Semi-active radar homing (radar guidance from plane)
EFFECTIVE RANGE  : 50 km
MISSILE SPEED    : Mach 4
MANEUVERABILITY  : Poor
ATTACK TECHNIQUE : Semi-active radar guided from launching aircraft

NOTES : This huge missile is the standard  long-range armament of PVO MiG-25
interceptors, and is roughly equivalent (though technically inferior) to the
Phoenix AAM on the F-14.The missile  is matched  purely to  the MiG-25;other
aircraft cannot control it.MiG-25Rs sold to Soviet client states aren`t nor-
mally equipped with this weapon.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME             : AA-7 "Apex" (Radar)
PURPOSE          : Medium range air-to-air missile,semi-active radar homing
GUIDANCE         : Semi-active radar homing (radar guidance from plane)
EFFECTIVE RANGE  : 34 km
MISSILE SPEED    : Mach 3
MANEUVERABILITY  : Poor
ATTACK TECHNIQUE : Semi-active radar guided from launching aircraft

NOTES : Was the standard USSR radar homing missile of the 1970s, the Russian
equivalent of the AIM7 "Sparrow".It requires a matching aircraft radar,found
in MiG-23s of the USSR + Warsaw Pact.Many MiG-23s sold to smaller Soviet cli
ents outside of Europe had inferior radars incapable of controlling this mis
sile.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME             : AA-9 "Amos"
PURPOSE          : Long range air-to-air missile,semi-active radar homing
GUIDANCE         : Semi-active radar homing (radar guidance from plane)
EFFECTIVE RANGE  : 82 km
MISSILE SPEED    : Mach 3.5
MANEUVERABILITY  : Fair
ATTACK TECHNIQUE : Semi-active radar guided from launching aircraft

NOTES : This new,large missile is a revision or redesign of the AA-6 "Acrid"
and is designed exclusively for the MiG31 interceptor.There are some reports
that the missile is an active radar homer (i.e.,has its own radar), allowing
fire and forget launching. There is even speculation  that the missile could
receive mid-course corrections from the launching aircraft or a ground radar
station,but it is unlikely that Russian computer electronics  are capable of
successfully implementing this yet.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME             : AA-10 "Alamo"
PURPOSE          : Medium range air-to-air missile,active radar homing
GUIDANCE         : Active radar homing"(has its own radar in nose)
EFFECTIVE RANGE  : 64 km
MISSILE SPEED    : Mach 3+
MANEUVERABILITY  : Good
ATTACK TECHNIQUE : Active radar homing independent of launching aircraft

NOTES : This new,medium-sized radar AAM is strongly believed to be an active
radar homer,that is,it carries its own onboard radar for "fire + forget use,
like the AIM-120 AMRAAM.It`s commonly found on the new MiG-29 and Su-27.

AIR-TO-GROUND ARMAMENT : ===================================================
CANNON : -------------------------------------------------------------------
M61A1 20mm Cannon   : 20mm cannon listed in  the air-to-air armament section
                      can be used against ground targets as well.

GUIDED MISSILES : ==========================================================
NAME                : Penguin-3 ASM
PURPOSE             : Medium-altitude infrared-homing anti-ship missile
QUANTITY PER BAY    : 2
ACCEPTABLE TARGETS  : Grade B,Ships at sea
EFFECTIVE RANGE     : 32 km
MAXIMUM SPEED       : Mach 0.8
ATTACK TECHNIQUE    : Air-Ground fire+forget launch against any warship
MIN LAUNCH ALTITUDE : 500'
MAX LAUNCH ALTITUDE : 40,000'

NOTES : Designed by Norway, this modestly-sized + priced missile is aimed at
a point on the surface + flies there under its own inertial guidance.At this
pre-designated point the missile switches on infrared homer,seeking the heat
of a ship against the ocean background.The missile is not a sea-skimmer, and
is therefore easier to shoot down. However, the missiles guidance system are
entirely passive unlike the Harpoon,which broadcasts its presence with radar
signals.Although maximum range in highaltitude launch is supposedly 80km,the
range used here is appropriate to a lower  altitude attack. Supplies of this
weapon are limited because the USgovernment is reluctant to purchase weapons
from the same source that sold  important military technology to the USSR in
the year 1981.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME                : AGM-84A "Harpoon"
PURPOSE             : Seas-kimming radar&inertial-guided anti-ship missile
QUANTITY PER BAY    : 1
OPTIMUM TARGETS     : Grade A,Ships at sea
EFFECTIVE RANGE     : 60 km
MAXIMUM SPEED       : Mach 0.8
ATTACK TECHNIQUE    : Air-Ground fire+forget launch against any warship
MIN LAUNCH ALTITUDE : 500'
MAX LAUNCH ALTITUDE : 40,000'

NOTES : The Harpoon is the standard antiship missile  of the American Navy +
Air Force.This weapon is more powerful,longer ranged and harder to stop than
the Penguin.It`s launched under inertial guidance with considerable computer
assistance,lying at sea-skimming altitudes to avoid detection.At a preprogr-
ammed point it turns on its radar,to find and home in on the target. Depend-
ing on the terminal guidance package  installed it will either pop up + dive
on the target,or fly straight in.Like most anti-shipping missiles,the remai-
ning rocket fuel is almost as destructive as the warhead itself.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME                : AGM-88A HARM
PURPOSE             : High speed anti-radiation (Homes on radar) missile
QUANTITY PER BAY    : 1
OPTIMUM TARGETS     : Grade A,Ground radar stations
ACCEPTABLE TARGETS  : Grade B,Warship radars
EFFECTIVE RANGE     : 20 km
MAXIMUM SPEED       : Mach 2+
ATTACK TECHNIQUE    : Air-Ground fire+forget launch against any radar
MIN LAUNCH ALTITUDE : 500'
MAX LAUNCH ALTITUDE : 60,000'

NOTES : This is America's most advanced anti-radar missile.It locks and hom-
es on hostile radars even if they jump frequencies or switch off.The US Def-
ense Department has hinted that it can even home on radarset components that
are still warm,even if the set itself is turned off ! The missile also has a
"loiter" mode where it`s fired blind and circles,waiting for a hostile radar
to appear so it can attack it. The "loiter" attack mode  is not available to
HARMs carried on the F-19.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME                : AGM-65D "Maverick"
PURPOSE             : Thermal-imaging air-to-ground guided missile
QUANTITY PER BAY    : 2
ACCEPTABLE TARGETS  : Grade B, Bridges,bunkers,sites,oil facilities,ships
POOR TARGETS        : Grade C,Airbase hangars,ground planes,buildings,depots
EFFECTIVE RANGE     : 32 km
MAXIMUM SPEED       : Mach 1+
ATTACK TECHNIQUE    : Air-Ground fire-and-forget launch
MIN LAUNCH ALTITUDE : 500'
MAX LAUNCH ALTITUDE : 40,000'

NOTES : The Maverick is America's standard air-to-ground guided missile, and
has a wide variety of guidancesystems.The original design put a simple video
camera in the missiles nose.While the missile remained attached to the plane
the pilot used a miniature stick and screen to aim the bomb at the target be
low,locked it in,and released the weapon.Once in flight the bomb steered to-
ward the image locked into its computer brain.Later versions added zoom-len-
ses,PAVETACK lasers,and ultimately,in the "D" model, a FLIR (forward-looking
infrared) thermal imaging system that can "see" through clouds,smoke,and ni-
ght.The missile usually  carries a shaped-charge  warhead for maximum effect
against hardened targets impervious to normal bombing attacks. However, high
explosive warheads can be fitted instead for maximum destructive effect aga-
inst unarmored targets.

LASER-GUIDED BOMBS : =======================================================
NAME                   : GBU-12 "Paveway"
PURPOSE                : Laser-guided glide bmmb
QUANTITY PER BAY       : 2
ACCEPTABLE TARGETS     : Grade B,Hangars,buildings,bridges, bunkers, depots,
                         missile sites, radar sites, oil facilities
POOR TARGETS           : Grade C,Ships
EFFECTIVE RANGE        : 2 kilometers per 1K' of altitude
MAXIMUM SPEED          : Glide bomb
ATTACK TECHNIQUE       : Toss bombing or level bombing
TOSS BOMBING ALTITUDE  : 500' and climb
LEVEL BOMBING ALTITUDE : 2,000' and turn away

NOTES : The GBU-12 is one of the standard laser-guided bombs in the US armo-
ry.Large fighter-bombers like the F-111 favor heavier 1,000lb and 2,000lb mo
dels, but the F-19 must carry lighter weight munitions in its small bays.The
PaveTack guidance system is the most accurate way of placing a bomb on a tar
get(short of using a guided missile like the Maverick).The advantage of usi-
ng a bomb is that the weapon weight is almost entirely explosive,while guid-
ed missiles must, of necessity,use some of their weight for the rocket motor
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME                   : CBU-72 FAE
PURPOSE                : Laser-guided triple fuel-air explosive bomb
QUANTITY PER BAY       : 2
OPTIMUM TARGETS        : Grade A,Buildings
ACCEPTABLE TARGETS     : Grade B,Submarine pens,hangars,bunkers,oilplatforms
POOR TARGETS           : Grade C,Ships
EFFECTIVE RANGE        : 2 kilometers per 1K' of altitude
MAXIMUM SPEED          : Glide bomb
ATTACK TECHNIQUE       : Toss bombing or level bombing
TOSS BOMBING ALTITUDE  : 500' and climb
LEVEL BOMBING ALTITUDE : 2,000' and turn away

NOTES : This weapon contains a mixture of three heavier-than-air gases. When
the bomb lands,the gases are released into the air,forming an explosive mix-
ture.A delayed-action fuse ignites the mixture,which causes the contaminated
air to burn.As well as incinerating everything,the burning gas expands inst-
antly. In the open air this is sufficient to set  off mines and flatten soft
objects (such as men).However,in an enclosed space the effect is vastly mag-
nified,with the walls,floor and roof of the structure broken and blown apart
The result in underground  structures (submarine pens) is total destruction.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME                   : Mk 20 "Rockeye" II
PURPOSE                : Laser-guided high-explosive cluster bomb
QUANTITY PER BAY       : 2
ACCEPTABLE TARGETS     : Grade B, Grounded planes, buildings,depots, missile
                         sites,radar sites,oil facilities,ships
EFFECTIVE RANGE        : 2 kilometers per 1K' of altitude
MAXIMUM SPEED          : Glide bomb
ATTACK TECHNIQUE       : Toss bombing or level bombing
TOSS BOMBING ALTITUDE  : 500' and climb
LEVEL BOMBING ALTITUDE : 2,000' and turn away

NOTES : This weapon marries a  laser-guided  glide-bomb  system with a Mk 20
Rockeye cluster munition.The laser guidance allows for earlier release + gre
ater bomblet release accuracy.With an area weapon like a cluster bomb the fo
rmer is more important,since it gives an increased safety margin to the laun
ching aircraft.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME                   : Mk 20 "Rockeye
PURPOSE                : Retarded fragmentation cluster bomb
QUANTITY PER BAY       : 2
ACCEPTABLE TARGETS     : Grade B,Grounded planes, buildings, depots, missile
                         sites,radar sites,oil facilities
POOR TARGETS           : Grade C,Ships
EFFECTIVE RANGE        : Nil
MAXIMUM SPEED          : Retarded bomb
ATTACK TECHNIQUE       : Low-altitude level bombing
LEVEL BOMBING ALTITUDE : 500'

NOTES : This cluster bomb breaks open about 100' above the surface, spinning
out 247 shaped-charge bomblets that can destroy buildings, armored vehicles,
and people.The opening height  and pattern can be pre-set  for various types
of targets.The U.S. Navy discovered these bombs were effective against small
warships when a single cluster bomb  wrecked a Libyan Nanuchka-class missile
boat in 1986.Of course,not all warships are as vulnerable.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME                   : Durandal Bomb
PURPOSE                : Parachute-deployed runway-penetration bomb
QUANTITY PER BAY       : 2
OPTIMUM TARGETS        : Grade A,Runways
POOR TARGETS           : Grade C,Bridges
EFFECTIVE RANGE        : Nil
MAXIMUM SPEED          : Retarded bomb
ATTACK TECHNIQUE       : Low-altitude level bombing
LEVEL BOMBING ALTITUDE : 500'

NOTES : This is the standard antirunway weapon in the US arsenal,even though
it's French made.When the Durandal is released over target it deploys a para
chute.This causes it to float nose-down and roughly stationary over the run-
way surface.Then its rocket motor ignites,blasting the warhead straight down
through the concrete,where a delayed action fuse explodes it. This heaves up
large sections of runway surface, while smaller  shards fly hundreds of feet
through the air.The result is a thoroughly ruined surface + tons of wreckage
that requires both heavy equipment and considerable time to repair.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME                   : ISC B-1 Minelets
PURPOSE                : Parachute-deployed minelet dispenser
QUANTITY PER BAY       : 1
OPTIMUM TARGETS        : Grade A,Runways
POOR TARGETS           : Grade C,Buildings,depots,SAM sites,oil facilities
EFFECTIVE RANGE        : Nil
MAXIMUM SPEED          : Retarded bomb
ATTACK TECHNIQUE       : Low altitude level bombing
LEVEL BOMBING ALTITUDE : 500'

NOTES : This new weapon breaks  open at altitude  and dispenses a variety of
small anti-personnel, anti-vehicle and delayed fuse mines. Used on airfields
they prevent flight operations until cleared.They can also cause problems a-
round open-air structures such as refineries,oilwells etc.Clearing the mines
is complicated by the variety of types, as well as random delayed-fuse bombs
(i.e.,you'll never know when another will explode!).
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME                   : Mk 82-1 "Snakeye"
PURPOSE                : Retarded high-explosive ("iron") bomb
QUANTITY PER BAY       : 3
ACCEPTABLE TARGETS     : Grade B,Grounded planes,buildings,depots,oil facil.
POOR TARGETS           : Grade C,Radar sites
EFFECTIVE RANGE        : Nil
MAXIMUM SPEED          : Retarded bomb
ATTACK TECHNIQUE       : Low altitude level bombing
LEVEL BOMBING ALTITUDE : 500'

NOTES : Retarded bombs use parachutes as vanes to slow their descent, allow-
ing the plane to clear the area before they land + explode. As a result they
can be dropped from a lower altitude than free-fall bombs. However, they are
less accurate, making them unsuitable against small targets.For the most ac-
curate release,retarded bombs should be dropped in level flight. The Snakeye
is the standard vane-type retarder  unit for many US bombs, here attached to
the Mk 82 500 lb. high-explosive bomb.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME                   : Mk 35 IN Cluster
PURPOSE                : Retarded incendiary cluster bomb
QUANTITY PER BAY       : 2
OPTIMUM TARGETS        : Grade A,Grounded planes,depots,missile sites,oil f.
ACCEPTABLE TARGETS     : Grade B,Buildings
POOR TARGETS           : Grade C,Radar sites,ships
EFFECTIVE RANGE        : Nil
MAXIMUM SPEED          : Retarded bomb
ATTACK TECHNIQUE       : Low-altitude level bombing
LEVEL BOMBING ALTITUDE : 500'

NOTES : This cluster bomb is similar to the Rockeye,but filled with 57 incen
diary bomblets.The cluster breaks apart in mid-air,spreading the bomblets o-
ver an area of several hundred yards.Then each bomblet spreads a burning li-
quid wherever it lands. The result is a raging fire that completely covers a
wide area.

FREE-FALL BOMBS : ==========================================================
NAME                   : MK 82-0 "Slick"
PURPOSE                : Free fall high explosive ("iron") bomb
QUANTITY PER BAY       : 3
ACCEPTABLE TARGETS     : Grade B,Buildings,depots,oil facilities on land
POOR TARGETS           : Grade C,Hangars,grounded planes,missile sites,radar
                         sites,oil platforms,ships.
EFFECTIVE RANGE        : Nil
MAXIMUM SPEED          : Free-fall bomb
ATTACK TECHNIQUE       : Level bombing or dive bombing
LEVEL BOMBING ALTITUDE : 3,000'
DIVE BOMBING ALTITUDE  : Dive from 8,000',release at 3,000'

NOTES : This weapon is the traditional 500 lb high explosive bomb, virtually
unchanged in concept since WWII.The effectiveness of this bomb depends almo-
st entirely on the skill of the bomber.The most important considerction when
using "iron" bombs is that  releases below 2000' don't give the bomb time to
arm in flight,causing "dud" hits.This occurred in the Falklands war of 1982,
when Argentine pilots repeatedly  hit British ships  with bombs dropped from
50' to 100'.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME                   : MK 122 "Fireye"
PURPOSE                : Free fall incendiary ("fire") bomb
QUANTITY PER BAY       : 2
ACCEPTABLE TARGETS     : Grade B,Grounded planes,buildings,depots,oil facil.
POOR TARGETS           : Grade C, Hangars,bunkers,missile sites,radar sites,
                         oil platforms, ships.
EFFECTIVE RANGE        : Nil
MAXIMUM SPEED          : Free-fall bomb
ATTACK TECHNIQUE       : Level bombing or dive bombing
LEVEL BOMBING ALTITUDE : 3,000'
DIVE BOMBING ALTITUDE  : Dive from 8,000',release at 3,000'

NOTES : This weapon contains an incendiary gel that spreads a burning liquid
over a wide area. The liquid can flow into vents, grates,weapon slits, etc.,
makine it effective against vehicles and  fortifications as well as open-air
targets. Of course, the bomb must be placed on the target with some accuracy
to achieve this effect.Bombing skill`s extremely important with this weapon.

OTHER EQUIPMENT : ==========================================================

NOTES : This pallette contains a 135mm high resolution camera for use in vis
ible light,and a second camera for infrared thermal photography.Both photogr
aphs are taken simultaneously under pilot control.When this camera is deplo-
yed through the bomb bay,the F-19's tracking  camera is "frozen" into a pre-
programmed  position,allowing it to function as a viewer for the 135mm lens.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME               : 1900 lbs Fuel
PURPOSE            : Additional fuel for extended range flying
QUANTITY PER BAY   : 1
EFFECTIVE RANGE    : Improves flight range by 19% per tank

NOTES : This fuel container gives extra range with the mininum container wei
ght.It replaces the weapons mounting in one bay. The fuel can be transferred
into the main tanks by the flip of a switch because the F-19 turbofan engine
fuel lines run only to the main tanks.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME               : Special Airdropping Secret Equipment
QUANTITY PER BAY   : 1
ATTACK TECHNIQUE   : Airdrop from level flight or land at airstrip
AIRDROP ALTITUDE   : 500' to 1000'

NOTES : Airdropped equipment in the F19 uses a simple ripcord-and-chute des-
ign.The equipment package is released from the weapons bay,a long ripcord re
mains attached.Within a second the cord draws taught + pulls open the chute.

SURFACE-TO-AIR MISSILE SYSTEMS : ===========================================
RADAR RATINGS : Pulse radars are generally less effective than dopplerradars
Obsolescent radars of either type are greatly inferior to modern radars.As a
result,modern doppler radars are the most dangerous, while obsolescent pulse
radars are the least dangerous.Ranges are given in km.Note that a maximum fi
ring range is often less than the maximum search range,due to the limited fu
el carried by most missiles.
GUIDANCE SYSTEMS : Radar guided missiles, with/without command guidance, are
confused by your ECM jammer unless they are very close.If they are close,ch-
aff is needed instead.Infrared guided missiles  are confused by your IR jam-
mer unless very close,where flares are used instead.A decoy is effective ag-
ainst any type of missile.Visually guided missiles cannot be fooled, but are
usually slow reacting,allowing you to outmaneuver them fairly easily.Maximum
speed is a useful measure  of whether you can outrun a missile, and how much
reaction time you have if one is fired. Mach 1 or 2 missiles are fairly slow
and easier to deal with. Mach 3 or faster missiles  are much more formidable
opponents.Maximum altitude is also a useful measure, since in some cases you
can fly above the missile's ceiling.Maneuverability indicates how easy it is
to outmaneuver the missile.The less maneuverable the missile,the better your
chance of turning perpendicular to its course and outmaneuvering it.

RADAR-CONTROLLED SAMS : ====================================================
The standard long-range SAM is controlled by radar.First the search radar sc
ans the sky to find your plane.Searchradars are graphically portrayed in the
pre-flight briefing,and on your cockpit CRTmaps.When the search system finds
your plane,it will "hand off" the  prospective target to a  narrow beam fire
control radar,usually running on a different frequency.The "TRAK" warning li
ght in the cockpit alerts you whenever a narrow-beam tracking radar "paints"
your craft.Tracking continues while the missile is airborne.Beam Rider radar
guided missiles are the least flexible.They "ride" the controlling radars be
am.They can be easily jammed,have poor maneuverability,and cannot "turn aro-
und" for a second attack if they miss. Semi-Active radar guided missiles are
more flexible.They can burn through jamming as they approach the target, and
often have better maneuverability.However,like beam-riders,they cannot "turn
around" for a second attack if they miss. Command Guidance radar-guided mis-
siles are the most flexible.Like semi-active missiles, they can burn through
jamming at short distances + have good maneuverability. In addition,they can
be commanded to turn around and try again if they miss on the first pass.

NAME                  : SA-2 "Guideline"
PURPOSE               : Long-range fixed-site radar-homing SAM.
BATTERY CONFIGURATION : Radar bunker with missile emplacements
SEARCH SYSTEM         : Obsolescent pulse radar
MAXIMUM SEARCH RANGE  : 200 km
GUIDANCE SYSTEM       : Obsolescent pulse radar "beam-rider"
MAXIMUM FIRING RANGE  : 125 km
MAXIMUM SPEED         : Mach 3+
MAXIMUM ALTITUDE      : 55,000'
MANEUVERABILITY       : Very poor

NOTES : This very old system is used  by many third world  nations outfitted
with Soviet equipment.Although the radar systems have been upgraded over the
last two decades,they are still inferior to modern systems.The last time SA2
were used effectively was the air defense of North Vietnam in the early 70s.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME                  : SA-5 "Gammon"
PURPOSE               : Long-range fixed-site radar-homing SAM.
BATTERY CONFIGURATION : Radar bunker with missile emplacements
SEARCH SYSTEM         : Obsolescent pulse radar
MAXIMUM SEARCH RANGE  : 350 km
GUIDANCE SYSTEM       : Obsolescent pulse radar "beam-rider"
MAXIMUM FIRING RANGE  : 150 km
MAXIMUM SPEED         : Mach 3
MAXIMUM ALTITUDE      : 95,000'
MANEUVERABILITY       : Poor

NOTES : The SA5 is the largest + longest ranged SAM in the world today.Howe-
ver,bigger is not always better. Missile accuracy at extreme ranges is poor,
its radar control system mediocre,and the huge missile has very poor maneuv-
erability.Still,the extreme range poses a formidable threat.In its 1986 exc-
hanges with Libya,the US Navy's first priority was disabling the SA-5 Gammon
batteries with HARM missiles.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME                  : SA-10 "Grumble"
PURPOSE               : Long-range fixed-site or vehicular radar-homing SAM.
BATTERY CONFIGURATION : Radar bunker or armored vehicle with missile emplace
                        ments or armored vehicle missile launchers.
SEARCH SYSTEM         : Phased-array doppler radar
MAXIMUM SEARCH Range  : 320 km
GUIDANCE SYSTEM       : Modern doppler radar and command guidance
MAXIMUM FIRING RANGE  : 125 km
MAXIMUM SPEED         : Mach 3
MAXIMUM ALTITUDE      : Over 70,000'
MANEUVERABILITY       : Fair

NOTES : This semi-mobile all-altitude defense system was originally designed
to defend the borders of the USSR from both cruise missiles and aircraft.How
ever,recent failures  to detect and engage  low-flying aircraft suggest this
system is less than perfect.The SA-10 is a new generation long range air def
ense weapon designed to replace the obsolgscent SA-5 Gammon.Because this wea
pon is new, details may be innaccurate.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME                  : SA-4 "Ganef"
PURPOSE               : Medium-range fixed-site/vehicular  radar-homing SAM.
BATTERY CONFIGURATION : Radar bunker with missile emplacements, or radar and
                        launcher on tracked vehicles
SEARCH SYSTEM         : Obsolescent pulse radar
MAXIMUM SEARCH RANGE  : 100 km
GUIDANCE SYSTEM       : Obsolescent pulse radar & semi-active radar homing
MAXIMUM FIRING RANGE  : 70 km
MAXIMUM SPEED         : Mach 2.5
MAXIMUM ALTITUDE      : 75,000'
MANEUVERABILITY       : Very poor

NOTES : The SA-4 was Russia's first mobile,battlefield SAM,designed to accom
pany large military formations as they maneuver on the battlefield.It opera-
tes in the rear areas of the front lines,attacking aircraft that IR SAMs fa-
il to hit.The SA-4 entered service in the 1960s. It is now obsolescent,found
only in 2nd and 3rd line Russian units.It has been sold extensively to Russ-
ian allies and client states.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME                  : SA-12 "Gladiator"
PURPOSE               : Medium/long-range site / vehicular radar-homing SAM.
BATTERY CONFIGURATION : Temporary site with radar  and missile launchers, or
                        dispersed radar and launcher vehicles
SEARCH SYSTEM         : Phased-array doppler radar
MAXIMUM SEARCH RANGE  : 290 km
GUIDANCE SYSTEM       : Modern doppler radar and command guidance
MAXIMUM FIRING RANGE  : 150 km
MAXIMUM SPEED         : Mach 3+
MAXIMUM ALTITUDE      : Over 70,000'
MANEUVERABILITY       : Fair

NOTES : This very new system is believed to be a semi-mobile SAM designed to
accompany armies,deploying far rear.From that position the missile can prov-
ide a wide umbrella of defense  against both air raids  and missile attacks.
Because this weapon is quite new,the details may be innaccurate.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME                  : SA-6 "Gainful"
PURPOSE               : Medium-range vehicular radar-homing SAM.
BATTERY CONFIGURATION : Radar and launcher on tracked vehicles
SEARCH SYSTEM         : Obsolescent pulse radar
MAXIMUM SEARCH Range  : 80 km
GUIDANCE SYSTEM       : Obsolescent pulse radar and command guidance
MAXIMUM FIRING RANGE  : 30 km
MAXIMUM SPEED         : Mach 2.8
MAXIMUM ALTITUDE      : 60,000'
MANEUVERABILITY       : Fair

NOTES : This medium ranged battlefield SAM is also obsolescent in the Russi-
an army, but extensively used by the first-line  forces of Soviet allies and
client states.It is designed to accompany combat troops,protecting them from
positions only a short distance behind the front lines. The missile was very
effective in the first few days of the 1973 Arab-Israeli War,but soon succum
bed to advanced ECM jammers.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME                  : SA-8 "Gecko"
PURPOSE               : Medium-range vehicular radar-homing SAM.
BATTERY CONFIGURATION : Radar and launcher on a single vehicle
SEARCH SYSTEM         : Modern pulse radar
MAXIMUM SEARCH RANGE  : 125 km
GUIDANCE SYSTEM       : Modern pulse radar,semi-active with video backup
MAXIMUM FIRING RANGE  : 65 km
MAXIMUM SPEED         : Mach 2
MAXIMUM ALTITUDE      : 25,000'
MANEUVERABILITY       : Good

NOTES : This shorter-ranged but higher quality successor to the SA-6 was the
standard "up front" radar SAM of the Soviet Army in the 1970s + early 1980s.
Now being replaced  by the SA-11, it is likely to appear among the armies of
Russia's allies and client states soon.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME                  : SA-11 "Gadfly"
PURPOSE               : Medium-range vehicular radar-homing SAM.
BATTERY CONFIGURATION : Radar and launcher on a single vehicle
SEARCH SYSTEM         : Modern doppler radar
MAXIMUM SEARCH RANGE  : 200 km
GUIDANCE SYSTEM       : Modern pulse radar,backup unknown
MAXIMUM FIRING RANGE  : 100 km
MAXIMUM SPEED         : Mach 2.5
MAXIMUM ALTITUDE      : 45,000'
MANEUVERABILITY       : Good

NOTES : This weapon is the "next generation"  battlefield radar SAM designed
to replace the SA-6 and SA-8.The weapon is very new, and details may well be
inaccurate.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME                  : MIM-23B "Hawk"
PURPOSE               : Medium-range fixed-site radar-homing SAM.
BATTERY CONFIGURATION : Radar bunker or trailer with missile launcher empla-
                        cements or trailers
SEARCH SYSTEM         : Modern pulse radar
MAXIMUM SEARCH RANGE  : 175 km
GUIDANCE SYSTEM       : Modern pulse radar and command guidance
MAXIMUM FIRING RANGE  : 125 km
MAXIMUM SPEED         : Mach 1.5
MAXIMUM ALTITUDE      : 52,000'
MANEUVERABILITY       : Good

NOTES : The HAWK has long been the standard SAM of the USA, with various mo-
dels exported to allies, including Iran. Lt.Colonel North's famous arms deal
to Iran included extra parts and missiles for HAWK batteries,then Irans most
powerful air defense system. This missile was adequate for the 1970s, but is
no longer "state of the art" against first-line 1980s aircraft.The US Army's
replacement,the MIM-104 "Patriot" has not been sold to any other nation.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME                  : "Rapier"
PURPOSE               : Short-range fixed-site visual/radar-homing SAM.
BATTERY CONFIGURATION : Combined radar+launcher pedestal,or tracked vehicle.
SEARCH SYSTEM         : Modern pulse radar
MAXIMUM SEARCH RANGE  : 75 km
GUIDANCE SYSTEM       : Optical command guidance with semi-active pulse rad-
                        ar backup system.
MAXIMUM FIRING RANGE  : 65 km
MAXIMUM SPEED         : Mach 2+
MAXIMUM ALTITUDE      : 24,000'
MANEUVERABILITY       : Very good

NOTES : This is a British high-precision,high-speed SAM for general battlef-
ield defense (roughly equivalent to the SA-8).However it is greatly hampered
by its short range,and was not very effective in the Falklands for this rea-
son.Pedestal versions were sold to the Iranian air force for airbase defense
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME                  : SA-N-4
PURPOSE               : Medium-range area-defense naval SAM.
BATTERY CONFIGURATION : Integral to warship
SEARCH SYSTEM         : Depends on the ship,usually some type of pulse radar
MAXIMUM SEARCH RANGE  : Depends on the ship.Typically 100-200 km
GUIDANCE SYSTEM       : Modern pulse radar with video backup
MAXIMUM FIRING RANGE  : 30 km
MAXIMUM SPEED         : Mach 2
MAXIMUM ALTITUDE      : 25,000'
MANEUVERABILITY       : Good

NOTES : This missile is the naval version of the SA8 Gecko,used on some cru-
isers,frigates,newer missile boats (including the Nanuchka class),and amphi-
bious warfare ships. The twin missile launcher  pops up from an armored silo
when ready to fire. The missiles can be  fired against surface ships as well
as airplanes, but are ineffective against  modern anti-ship cruise missiles.
This is a serious drawback,since many cruisers have a longer range than this
SAM-System.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME                  : SA-N-6
PURPOSE               : Medium-range area-defense naval SAM.
BATTERY CONFIGURATION : Integral to warship
SEARCH SYSTEM         : Phased array doppler radar
MAXIMUM SEARCH RANGE  : 300+ km
GUIDANCE SYSTEM       : Modern doppler radar and command guidance
MAXIMUM FIRING RANGE  : 125 km
MAXIMUM SPEED         : Mach 3
MAXIMUM ALTITUDE      : over 70,000'
MANEUVERABILITY       : Average

NOTES : This is the naval version of the SA10 Grumble long-range air-defense
SAM,mounted on the Kiev-class aircraft carriers and Kirov-class battlecruis-
ers.It is an excellent all-altitude weapon capable of reaching out long dis-
tances to intercept incoming airstrikes before they launch their own missil-
es,as well as planes that approach more closely.It is also designed to shoot
down incoming cruise missiles,should a hostile aircraft manage to launch one
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME                  : SA-N-7
PURPOSE               : Medium-range area-defense naval SAM.
BATTERY CONFIGURATION : Integral to warship
SEARCH SYSTEM         : Depends on ship,usually modern doppler radar
MAXIMUM SEARCH RANGE  : Depends on the ship,50 to 200 km
GUIDANCE SYSTEM       : Modern pulse radar,backup unknown
MAXIMUM FIRING RANGE  : 100 km
MAXIMUM SPEED         : Mach 2.5
MAXIMUM ALTITUDE      : 45,000'
MANEUVERABILITY       : Good

NOTES : This is the naval equivalent of the SA11 Gadfly,found on Sovremennyy
class and later destroyers.It is a good self-defense weapon against air att-
acks that fly near or  over the ship, but lacks the range to  engage distant
planes launching anti ship cruisemissiles.This missile is not good enough to
shoot down anti-ship cruise missiles,but the Sovremennyys carry 30mm gatling
guns for that job.

SHORT RANGE IR & VISUAL SAMS : =============================================
Expensive,sophisticated short range SAMs rely on search radars, but the less
expensive designs use simple eyesight.Once acquired,the target may be track-
ed by eyesight,cameras or radar.If the missile is an IR homer,it is aimed a-
long the tracking line,and its infrared seeker turned on.When the seeker lo-
cks onto the target the missile is launched.From that point onward the miss-
ile steers itself,using its seeker.Infrared seekers home on heat sources."Fi
rst generation" seekers were easily confused by the sun,common distress fla-
res,even greenhouses or sun-heated rocks.More modern "second generation" se-
ekers have filters,improved technology and  computer logic, making them more
difficult to "fool" with  jammers or flares. Visually guided weapons require
that the controller guide the  missile to the target in sight. Early designs
such as the Tigercat and Seacat required the  controller to actually fly the
missile like a plane,later designs such as the Rapier requier the the contr-
oller just keep the target in his crosshairs - the missile automatically gu-
ides itself in whateter direction the crosshair sight indicates,visually gu-
ided systems cannot be jammed,have trouble tracking wildly maneuvering targ-
ets,or even finding a target in bad visibility.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME                  : SA-7B "Grail"
PURPOSE               : Short-range shoulder-launched infrared-homing SAM.
BATTERY CONFIGURATION : Carried by infantrymen, or in any light vehicle.
SEARCH SYSTEM         : Eyesight
MAXIMUM SEARCH RANGE  : Eyesight
GUIDANCE SYSTEM       : Infrared homing (first generation)
MAXIMUM FIRING RANGE  : 10 km
MAXIMUM SPEED         : Mach 1.5
MAXIMUM ALTITUDE      : 20,000'+
MANEUVERABILITY       : Good

NOTES : One of the first shoulder fired SAMs,this missile has good speed and
range but a very weak warhead.The IR seeker has been improved in the B model
but even more upgrades appeared in the SA-14.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME                  : FIM-43A "Redeye"
PURPOSE               : Short-range shoulder-launched infrared-homing SAM.
BATTERY CONFIGURATION : Carried by infantrymen,or in any light vehicle.
SEARCH SYSTEM         : Eyesight
MAXIMUM SEARCH RANGE  : Eyesight
GUIDANCE SYSTEM       : Infrared homing (first generation)
MAXIMUM FIRING RANGE  : No more that 7 km
MAXIMUM SPEED         : Mach 1.5
MAXIMUM ALTITUDE      : 10,000'+
MANEUVERABILITY       : Very good

NOTES : Was America's first shoulder-fired SAM,and was never really very ef-
fective.Its IR seeker was very simple,the warhead small,and the range and sp
eed barely adequate.However,during the 1970s the US Army had nothing better,
and a few NATO allies were loyal enough to buy it.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME                  : SA-14 & SA-16
PURPOSE               : Short-range shoulder-launched infrared-homing SAM.
BATTERY CONFIGURATION : Carried by infantrymen,or in any light vehicle.
SEARCH SYSTEM         : Eyesight
MAXIMUM SEARCH RANGE  : Eyesight
GUIDANCE SYSTEM       : Infrared homing (second generation all-aspect)
MAXIMUM FIRING RANGE  : About 16 km
MAXIMUM SPEED         : Mach 1.5+
MAXIMUM ALTITUDE      : 20,000'+
MANEUVERABILITY       : Excellent

NOTES : This is a completely upgraded version of the SA7,with greater speed,
range, and a much improved seeker. Even further improvements and refinements
will appear with the upcoming SA-16.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME                  : FIM-92A "Stinger"
PURPOSE               : Short-range shoulder-launched infrared-homing SAM.
BATTERY CONFIGURATION : Carried by infantrymen,or in any light vehicle.
SEARCH SYSTEM         : Eyesight
MAXIMUM SEARCH RANGE  : Eyesight
GUIDANCE SYSTEM       : Infrared homing (second generation all-aspect)
MAXIMUM SPEED         : Mach 2
MAXIMUM FIRING RANGE  : About 10 km
MAXIMUM ALTITUDE      : About 20,000'
MANEUVERABILITY       : Excellent

NOTES : Entering production in 1981, this  was a much-needed replacement for
the Redeye.The Stinger is much more effective missile,largely because of its
excellent and quite intelligent IR seeker.The CIA has been supplying quanti-
ties of this missile to guerilla movements, who in turn have traded or given
this to groups hostile to America,including the Iranian Shi'ite militia.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME                  : SA-9B "Gaskin"
PURPOSE               : Short-range vehicle mounted infrared-homing SAM.
BATTERY CONFIGURATION : Radar and launcher on same armored vehicle
SEARCH SYSTEM         : Eyesight
MAXIMUM SEARCH RANGE  : Eyesight
GUIDANCE SYSTEM       : Pulse radar aiming and infrared (IR) homing
MAXIMUM SPEED         : Mach 1.5
MAXIMUM FIRING RANGE  : 30 km
MAXIMUM ALTITUDE      : 20,000'
MANEUVERABILITY       : Very good

NOTES : This is an upgraded version of the SA-9 missile vehicle.The original
design did very poorly in the Bekaa Valley against Israeli aircraft in 1981.
The SA-9 is designed to  accompany front-line  combat units and provide low-
level defense against strike aircraft and helicopters. The missile itself is
fairly small and not especially destructive.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME                  : SA-13 "Gopher"
PURPOSE               : Short-range vehicle mounted infrared-homing SAM.
BATTERY CONFIGURATION : Radar and launcher on same armored vehicle
SEARCH SYSTEM         : Obsolescent pulse radars or eyesight
MAXIMUM SEARCH RANGE  : Visual or 30-60 km pulse radar
GUIDANCE SYSTEM       : Pulse radar aiming and infrared (IR) homing
MAXIMUM SPEED         : Mach 1.5
MAXIMUM FIRING RANGE  : 65 km
MAXIMUM ALTITUDE      : 30,000'
MANEUVERABILITY       : Very good

NOTES : This is an improved SA9 with a new launcher,better radar,and an imp-
roved missile.Unlike the SA-9, it can be linked with a seperate search radar
system,including other obsolescent systems from older radar-guided SAMs.A nu
mber of third world nations have received this with the SA9B missiles on the
new tracked launcher.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME                  : "Tigercat"
PURPOSE               : Short-range fixed site visual SAM.
BATTERY CONFIGURATION : Emplacements + controller position,trailer laucher
SEARCH SYSTEM         : Visual or obsolescent pulse radar
MAXIMUM SEARCH RANGE  : Eyesight or 65 km pulse radar
GUIDANCE SYSTEM       : Joystick (visual) command guidance
MAXIMUM SPEED         : Mach 1.5
MAXIMUM FIRING RANGE  : 30 km
MAXIMUM ALTITUDE      : 12,000'
MANEUVERABILITY       : Good

NOTES : This inexpensive land  version of the Seacat missile  is only useful
for protecting installations from direct air raids. It is very short ranged,
cannot reach high altitudes,and has a primitive "operator must fly the miss-
ile" control system.Missiles are heavy, and mounted on trailers that must be
deployed well to rear of any battlefield frontline.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME                  : SA-N-5
PURPOSE               : Short-range point defense naval SAM.
BATTERY CONFIGURATION : Integral to warship
SEARCH SYSTEM         : Naval pulse radar of varying quality
MAXIMUM SEARCH RANGE  : Varies with ship,50-150 km
GUIDANCE SYSTEM       : Infrared (IR) homing
MAXIMUM SPEED         : Mach 1.5
MAXIMUM FIRING RANGE  : 30 km
MAXIMUM ALTITUDE      : 20,000'
MANEUVERABILITY       : Very good

NOTES : This is vhe naval version of the SA-7 Grail.Older frigates and miss-
ile boats including the very common  Osa class use this system. The missiles
are aimed visually,their IR locked on,and then fired.Larger launcher systems
have four launching tubes and an  operator position. The system is effective
only against aircraft that fly close to the boat or ship.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME                  : "Seacat"
PURPOSE               : Short-range point defense naval SAM.
BATTERY CONFIGURATION : Integral to"warship
SEARCH SYSTEM         : Obsolescent pulse radar (on Vosper Mk 5 Frigates)
MAXIMUM SEARCH RANGE  : 200 km (on Vosper Mk 5 Frigates)
GUIDANCE SYSTEM       : Joystick (visual) command guidance
MAXIMUM SPEED         : Mach 1.5
MAXIMUM FIRING RANGE  : 30 km
MAXIMUM ALTITUDE      : 12,000'
MANEUVERABILITY       : Good

NOTES : The missile is the naval version of the Tigercat,with the same prim-
itive control system and short range.It is the anti-aircraft defense of Mark
5 frigates,built by Vosper/England for export. Iran bought a number of these
ships.The Vosper's search radar is the obsolescent AWS-1,whose maximum range
is 200 km.Its effective range against a stealth aircraft would be much less.

WARPLANES/KEY TO AIRCRAFT : ================================================
ROLES : A fighter plane specializes in air-to-air combat,where the objective
is destroying enemy aircraft.An interceptor is a fighter designed to fly lo-
ng distances + attack distant enemy aircraft.Many interceptors are poor dog-
fighters.A strike plane is designed to hit surface targets in enemy territo-
ry.Close support strikes are against enemy front-line troops,interdiction st
rikes are against military rear areas (headquarters,supply dumps, columns on
roads,etc.),while deep strikes attack enemy installations far behind the fr-
ont line (railroad yards,bridges,airbases,etc.). Strike aircraft designed to
function against warships are sometimes  termed attack aircraft. Bombers are
designed for knterdiction,deep strike,and/or naval attack,aswell as carrying
nuclear weapons and/or reconnaissance gear.Transports carry personnel and e-
quipment.They are not designed to fight,and almost never carry and armament.
AEW&C (Airborne Early Warning & Control) planes carry  powerful search radar
and communications gear, designed to watch friendly + hostile aircraft while
simultaneously controlling friendly air operations.

CREW : If a plane has a crew of one man,cockpit aids are important:the work-
load for one man in a jet warplane is quite high.

MISSION WEIGHT : This is the typical total  weight of the plane, with fuel +
weapons,at takeoff.If the plane can serve in both fighter + strike role, the
fighter (air-to-air) weight is given. In a strike role a plane often carries
15-35% additional weight.

ENGINES : The total thrust of the  engines (on afterburners if available) is
important.Airplanes with greater thrust than weight can fly "ballistically",
a useful advantage in aircombat.A high thrust/weight ratio is desired by all
fighter pilots.

RANGE : This is the combat radius  of the plane when  loaded for action, but
using only internal tanks (no extra fuel tanks).Often the figure is an appr-
oximation.

CEILING : Maximum altitude of the plane,using afterburners if available.

MAXIMUM SPEED AT 0' : Sea-level maximum  speed is often much less  than high
altitude maximum speed,especially in high-speed jets.

MAXIMUM SPEED AT 36,000': This altitude level is an importcnt benchmark bec-
ause above it Mach 1 is a constant 573 knots.Although this speed is importa-
nt,note that the optimum turning speed for most aircraft is Mach 0.75 - 0.90
(i.e.,550-650 knots,depending on the  plane and altitude); higher speeds are
only good for chasing opponents,escaping from them, or quick dashes into and
out of enemy airspace.

ARMAMENT: Often weapons pylons can  be fitted to carry multiple bombs/light-
weight missiles.Number of pylons need not limit the number of ordnance items

AIR-TO-AIR RADAR QUALITY : As a  stealth pilot, you are naturally interested
in the range and quality of enemy airborne search radar.

MANEUVERABILITY : This is a comparative rating of how well the plane can ma-
neuver in a dogfight.All aircraft are rated on the same standard: via superb
maneuverability of the F-16 Falcon.

NOTES : This all-purpose plane served the US Navy + Air Force as both a fig-
hter and strike fighter throughout the 1960s and early 1970s. In the USAF it
is now obsolescent, serving mainly for reconnaissance and electronic warfare
("Wild Weasel").However,hundreds were sold to western nations worldwide,inc-
luding Iran under the Shah.For air-to-air combat the plane can carry four AI
M-9 Sidewinders + four AIM-7 Sparrows.

NAME                  : F-14D Tomcat
DESIGNER/MANUFACTURER : Grumman, USA
ROLE                  : Fighter & interceptor
CREW                  : 2
MISSION WEIGHT        : 35 t
ENGINE(S)             : Originally 2 Pratt & Whitney TF30-412A turbofans for
                        41,800 lbs thrust,upgraded in D model to two General
                        Electric F110-400 turbofans for 54-58,000 lbs thrust
RANGE                 : 1280 km
CEILING               : over 56,000'
MAXIMUM SPEED AT 0'   : 800 kts with TF30,higher with F110
MAXIMUM SPEED 36,000' : 1350 kts with TF30,higher with F110
ARMAMENT              : 6-barrel 20mm cannon,4 weapons pallets,2 pylons
AIR-AIR RADAR QUALITY : Excellent range,high quality doppler radar
MANEUVERABILITY       : Good

NOTES : This heavy,longrange interceptor has extremely powerful avionics for
use with the AIM-54 Phoenix semi-active radar-homing missile,which has a 200
km effective range.The aircraft is the US Navy's long-range defender of car-
rier battle groups.Standard USN armament is 4 Phoenix + 4 Sidewinder missil-
es. The swinging wings are computer  controlled for maximum performance, but
their swing also shows the plane's energy state to the enemy. In 87 the Navy
began a program that upgraded the original TF30 engines with the newer, more
powerful F110s.About 80 TF30-engined F-14s were supplied to Iran, but engine
troubles,complexities in the avionics system,and the delicacy of the Phoenix
missiles have greatly reduced their militaryvalue.They are often used as ra-
dar-warning patrol aircraft.

                        FAST pallet points (extra fuel)
AIR-AIR RADAR QUALITY : Medium range,high quality doppler radar
MANEUVERABILITY       : Very good

NOTES : This large,powerful dogfighter is the dream plane of many USAFpilots
Although not as nimble as the lightweight F-16,it has longer ranged avionics
plus a brute size and power unmatched by any fighter until the new Su-27 ap-
peared.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME                  : F-16C Falcon
DESIGNER/MANUFACTURER : General Dynamics, USA

CEILING               : Over 50,000'
MAXIMUM SPEED AT 0'   : 800 kts
MAXIMUM SPEED 36,000' : 1190 kts
ARMAMENT              : 6-barrel 20mm cannon,7 weapon pylons
AIR-AIR RADAR QUALITY : Medium range,high quality doppler radar
MANEUVERABILITY       : Excellent

NOTES : The latest production fighter added to the US Air Force, the F-16 is
the most maneuverable dogfighter in the world possibly excepting the MiG-29.
The inherently unstable airframe that gives this agility  would be unflyable
except for the computerized electronic controls,hence its nickname "Electric
Jet".Advanced air-ground avionics and anti-missile defenses are extras,maki-
ng the basic aircraft  relatively cheap. Many western nations have purchased
F-16s.However,until the AIM-120 AMRAAM it had no long-range AAM.

AIR-AIR RADAR QUALITY : Medium range,high quality doppler radar
MANEUVERABILITY       : Good to very good

NOTES : Although not as maneuverable as the F-16,this heavier multi-role fi-
ghter has numerous avionic and defensive  aids built in. These were required
by the US Navy,its main user,who needed an all-purpose fighter + attack bom-
ber able to fire a variety of sophisticated weapons.Like the F-16,it also is
sold to western nations.

MAXIMUM SPEED 36,000' : 540 kts
ARMAMENT              : 5 weapons pylons
AIR-AIR RADAR QUALITY : Poor,but superb air-to-ground weapons radars
MANEUVERABILITY       : Fair to poor

NOTES : Designed at the end of the 1950s as a lowlevel attack bomber for use
in bad weather/at night,this plane remains an unqualified success.Avionics +
weapons have been rebuilt more than once to maintain the "state of the art",
with upgrades under development.Electronic warfare (EA-6 and EA-6B) + aerial
tanker (KA-6D) versions exist.

NAME                  : AV-8B Harrier II
DESIGNER/MANAFACTURER : British Aerospace,UK (original design) and McDonnell
                        Douglas,USA (American version)
ROLE                  : S/VTOL Fighter & strike fighter
CREW                  : 1
MISSION WEIGHT        : 15 t STOVL,10 t VTOL
ENGINE(S)             : One Rolls Royce Pegasus 11-21E for 22,000 lbs vecto-
                        red thrust (no afterburner)
RANGE                 : 240 km
CEILING               : 55,000'
MAXIMUM SPEED AT 0'   : 585 kts
MAXIMUM SPEED 36,000' : 520 kts
ARMAMENT              : 1 * 25mm cannon,7 weapon pylons
AIR-AIR RADAR QUALITY : Poor,target acquisition is usually visual
MANEUVERABILITY       : Very good

NOTES : Originally designed as a strike fighter,the British-American corede-
sign greatly enhanced maneuverability. The avionics  are designed for ground
attack rather than air-to-air combat. Despite this, Harriers were successful
as interceptors and combat air patrol in the 1982 Falklands War. The Harrier
is the primary fighter of the US Marines,the British Royal Navy,and frontli-
ne squadrons of the British Royal Air Force (RAF) in Germany.Usually it uses
short segments of roadway or a "skijump" deck for rolling takeoffs,and later
lands vertically,like a helicopter.

NAME                  : A-10A Thunderbolt II
DESIGNER/MANAFACTURER : Fairchild Republic,USA
ROLE                  : Close support aircraft
CREW                  : 1
MISSION WEIGHT        : 20 t
ENGINE(S)             : 2 GeneralElectric TF34100 turbofans/18,130lbs thrust
RANGE                 : 960 km
CEILING               : Under 40,000'
MAXIMUM SPEED AT 0'   : 370 kts
MAXIMUM SPEED 36,000' : Unknown,probably less than 370 kts
ARMAMENT              : 7-barrel 30mm cannon,11 weapon pylons
AIR-AIR RADAR QUALITY : Poor,air-to-ground avionics quite basic
MANEUVERABILITY       : Very good

NOTES : This slow, heavily-armored  plane was designed  purely for frontline
ground attack with tank busting its speciality.This role (unglamorous to the
USAF), along with its peculiar  appearance, earns it the unofficial nickname
Warthog.Although intended for combat in Europe where low clouds and bad wea-
ther are frequent,the A-10 is a fair-weather day-only plane.The manafacturer
hopes to interest the USAF in a night-flying variant, currently without suc-
cess.Unless protected by good fighters (F-15s + F-16s), this plane is doomed
if sent into airspace  contested by USSR fighters. The USAF is now gradually
getting rid of the A-10.Numerous accidents may have had something to do with
this.

RANGE                 : 1,900 km
CEILING               : 54,700'
MAXIMUM SPEED AT 0'   : 700 kts
MAXIMUM SPEED 36,000' : 1020 kts
ARMAMENT              : ALQ-99E electronic warfare system,no other weapons
AIR-AIR RADAR QUALITY : Medium-long range,high quality pulse & doppler
MANOUVERABILITY       : Fair

NOTES : Specially built electronic warfare version of the  F-111 "Aardvaark"
strike and interdiction bomber.The original concept of the F-111 was a high-
speed bomber for deep strikes at high and/or low altitude,especially at nig-
ht or in bad weather.The EF-111 is popularly known as the "Electric Fox", or
"Spark Vark".It is designed to accompany deep strike and interdiction missi-
ons,providing electronic screening and jamming,it is the fastest,most power-
ful such craft in the world.

CREW                  : 4
MISSION WEIGHT        : 225 t with internal load only
ENGINE(S)             : 4 GeneralElectric F101102 turbofans/120,000 lbs
RANGE                 : 5,900 km
CEILING               : Unknown,probably under 50,000'
MAXIMUM SPEED AT 0'   : 530 kts
MAXIMUM SPEED 36,000' : 727 kts
ARMAMENT              : 37.5 t capacity bomb bay,plus 29.5 t external mounts
AIR-AIR RADAR QUALITY : Medium range,high quality doppler radar
MANEUVERABILITY       : Poor

NOTES : This redesign of the B1A emphasizes low-level attack + minimal radar
signature.The aircraft is now seriously overloaded by the numerous revisions
+ often unreliable electronic defensive gear. Despite the usual carping from
the US press, in combat against first-line  Russian aircraft this bomber has
some hope of survival.The obsolescent B-52s it replaces would have no chance
whatsoever.

NAME                  : E-3C Sentry "AWACS"
DESIGNER/MANAFACTURER : Boeing,USA
ROLE                  : Airborne Early Warning & Control
CREW                  : 15 to 17
MISSION WEIGHT        : 162.5 t
ENGINE(S)             : 4 Pratt&Whitney TF33-100/100A turbofans/84,000 lbs
RANGE                 : 3,000 km (11 hours unrefueled endurance)
CEILING               : Over 29,000'
CRUISE SPEED          : Over 350 kts
MAXIMUM SPEED         : 460 kts
ARMAMENT              : Surveillance radar,communications,airtraffic control
                        and electronic defenses; weapons pylons may be added
AIR-AIR RADAR QUALITY : Excellent range and quality radars
MANEUVERABILITY       : Poor

NOTES : This 707 airliner frame holds the most sophisticated + effective air
borne radar in the world.No other nation has a plane of equivalent effective
ness.Flying "racetrack" circles behind friendly lines at 25-30,000',this AW-
ACS can watch and direct aircraft out to 300 miles range.Until the "C" model
upgrade,too many aircraft and limited computer power caused temporary "blind
spots".In wartime weapons pylons carrying AIM-9 Sidewinders or AIM-120 AMRA-
AMS could be added.In addition each Sentry carries various electronic defen-
ses and always has a fighter escort.

RUSSIAN-BUILT WARPLANES : ==================================================
NAME                  : MiG-21 Fishbed
DESIGNER/MANAFACTURER : Mikoyan-Gurevich,USSR
ROLE                  : Fighter
CREW                  : 1
MISSION WEIGHT        : 9 t
ENGINE(S)             : 1 Tumansky R-11F2S-300 turbofan/14,500 lbs thrust
RANGE                 : 630 km
CEILING               : 59,000' (often only 50,000')
MAXIMUM SPEED AT 0'   : 700 kts
MAXIMUM SPEED 36,000' : 1220 kts
ARMAMENT              : 2 *  23mm cannon,4 weapons pylons,1 fuel tank pylon
AIR-AIR RADAR QUALITY : Very short range,low quality pulse radar
MANEUVERABILITY       : Good

NOTES : This agile, maneuverable,easy-flying fighter was the premier dogfig-
hting plane of the 1960s and early 1970s.It has simple avionics + a standard
armament of 2 or 4 AA-2s (now often replaced by AA-8s),making it inexpensive
to buy,arm and maintain.However,it has little or no HUD,weak radars, and low
quality defenses,making it obsolete as a fighter. Unfortunately, its limited
carrying capacity makes it poor as a strike fighter.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME                  : MiG-23 Flogger
DESIGNER/MANAFACTURER : Mikoyan-Gurevich,USSR
ROLE                  : Fighter

MAXIMUM SPEED AT 0'   : 740 kts
MAXIMUM SPEED 36,000' : 1190 kts
ARMAMENT              : 2 * 23mm cannon,4 weapon pylons,1 fuel tank pylon
AIR-AIR RADAR QUALITY : Very poor,short range pulse radar
MANEUVERABILITY       : Fair

NOTES : This swing-wing fighter replacement for the MiG21 originally had few
avionics and a 22,485 lb. R-27 engine.This variant,incapable of firing soph-
isticated weapons and with serious  performance flaws, is often sold abroad.
The more advanced models,listed above, are mediocre performers. All commonly
carry AA-2 and/or AA-8 missiles,most USSR and East European versions use the
AA-7 radar homing missile also. With its MiG-27 brother, this plane has huge
production runs, making it the cheapest  fighter available today. This alone
makes it one of the world's most popular aircraft.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME                  : MiG-27 Flogger (Physical appearance equivalent to Mi
                        G-23,but slimmer 'duck-nose')

CEILING               : 52,000'
MAXIMUM SPEED AT 0'   : 635 kts
MAXIMUM SPEED 36,000' : 925 kts
ARMAMENT              : 1 * 6-barrel 23mm cannon,5 weapon pylons,2 bombracks
AIR-AIR RADAR QUALITY : Very poor,very short range pulse radar
MANEUVERABILITY       : Fair

NOTES : This is the ground-attack variant of the MiG-23.In Russian frontline
units it includes a laser  designator for laser-guided  munitions and simple
terrainavoidance radars for lowlevel attacks.Improved jammers and decoys are
added as well.Many sophisticated attack aids common on western strike fight-
ers are not present.Presumably the MiG-27s compensate for this with quantity
as huge production runs greatly lower its cost.

CEILING               : 80,000'
MAXIMUM SPEED AT 0'   : 570 kts
MAXIMUM SPEED 36,000' : 1860 kts
ARMAMENT              : 4 weapons pylons
AIR-AIR RADAR QUALITY : Medium quality,medium range pulse radar
MANEUVERABILITY       : Poor

NOTES : This plane was originally designed to defend  the distant borders of
the USSR from air attack, working with special ground radars to attack enemy
bombers with a special long-ranged AAM (the AA-6). It is extremely fast, but
quite unmaneuverable. A few are bought  by client states for status reasons,
but the reconnaissance version (MiG25R) is more popular - it's 88,000' ceil-
ing makes it immune to normal SAM or fighter interception.

NOTES : Originally designed to outfight the F-15,this plane is a modern,lig
htweight dogfighter with superlative agility. It has engine power in excess
of its weight. Common armament is AA10 "fire and forget" radar-homers along
with some AA-8 and/or AA-10 IR missiles.The degree of sophistication in the
avionics is unknown,but unlikely to match west  models. Considerable debate
exists regarding the relative superiority of this plane versus the F-16.

AIR-AIR RADAR QUALITY : Nil,avionics designed purely for air-ground role
MANEUVERABILITY       : Fair

NOTES : This is the most advanced air-ground attack plane built by the USSR.
Externally it appears similar to the F111,including the side-by-side seating
in the cockpit.However,its armament and avionics are designed for front-line
and rear-area strikes, into the teeth of enemy air defenses. Western air and
ground commanders fear the Su-24 more than any other Soviet aircraft.The air
craft may carry a few AA-8s for self-defense,but it is not designed for air-
to-air combat.

ARMAMENT              : Probably a cannon,6 weapons pylons
AIR-AIR RADAR QUALITY : Above average quality and range doppler radar
MANEUVERABILITY       : Very good to excellent

NOTES : This aircraft was designed to dedeat the F-14 and F-15 fighters.It`s
a large, powerful dogfighter whose usual armament  is probably four AA-8 and
four AA-10 missiles.In comparison to the MiG-29,the Su27 is a larger,heavier
plane.If its avionics and flight controls are truly modern, the Su-27 may be
the superior plane.However,in dogfighting maneuverability the MiG-29 and F16
probably have the edge.

MANEUVERABILITY       : Fair

NOTES : Originally known as the Yak-36MP,this vertical take-off fighter oper
ates from the Kiev-class aircraft carriers.These lack the equipment and deck
space for conventional jets. Initially thought to be a Russian equivalent of
the Harrier,the Yak38 is considerably inferior.It has a limited interception
ability and very limited strike capacity.However,until this plane the Russi-
an navy had nothing bigger than helicopters for its warships at sea.

AIR-TO-AIR RADAR QUALITY  : Fair,with excellent air-to-surface avionics
MANEUVERABILITY           : Very poor

NOTES : Many of these swing-wing bombers are in service with the Soviet nav-
al air arm,carrying longrange missiles to attack hostile warships up to 3000
km out to sea.The Backfire's exceptionally long range + high speed, plus its
powerful missiles make it a mortal threat to USN aircraft carriers.With aer-
ial refueling it has sufficient range to get within curise-missile-launch po
sition of the USA.As a gesture to arms control,the USSR has removed air ref-
ueling equipment from its Air Force Backfires.

ARMAMENT                  : Unarmed
AIR-TO-AIR RADAR QUALITY  : Very good long-range pulse radars
MANEUVERABILITY           : Terrible

NOTES : The Tu95 has been the worlds most sophisticated turbopropbomber for
over thirty years (it entered service in 1955). It is primarily used for lo
ng-range reconnaissance,electronic intelligence,electronic warfare(jamming)
anti-ship missiles,and cruise-missiles.The "D" model is a reconnaissance ve
rsion,the "H" model (on a slightly modified airframe) a cruise-missile car-
rier.(Believe it or not, this plane's design ancestry can be traced back to
the WW2 American Flying Fortress..)

ARMAMENT                  : Possibly twin 23mm tailcannon, 2-4 weapon pylons
AIR-TO-AIR RADAR QUALITY  : Excellent long-range doppler radars
MANEUVERABILITY           : Terrible
NOTES : The "Mainstay" is a conversion of the huge Il-76 Candid transport pl
ane to "AWACS" duties.Its purpose is to detect enemy aircraft  and low-flyi-
ng missiles,and act as a mobile,airborne command post that controls friendly
aircraft engaging such threats. The earlier Tu-126  "Moss" AEW&C with turbo-
props was a disastrous failure.Like many AEW&C planes, the Il-76 could carry
a few AAMs (AA-8s or AA-10s) for  self defense,as well as extensive jammers,
decoys,etc.

AIR-TO-AIR RADAR QUALITY  : Navigational only
MANEUVERABILITY           : Terrible for a fighter,but good for a transport
NOTES : This is the latest general purpose medium air transport of the Sovi-
et Union.Its jet  engines and short-takeoff performance make in an outstand-
ing utility craft for transporting  all types of personnel and cargo between
remote airfields.

EVASIVE ACTION AGAINST MISSILES : ==========================================
JAMMERS : Jammers are so-called ECM-equipment (Electronic Counter Measures).
They try to electronically interfere incoming IR- and Radar-guided missiles.
They work just fine against IR1-classed missiles, but the IR2 type is guided
by a seeker with advanced computer logic, and once recognizing the seeker of
the jammer,actually homes on the jammer,instead of being confused by it.The-
refore,it's unwise and sometimes downright  dangerous to leave a jammer run-
ning when  second-generation IR  missiles are  getting close (not to mention
the jammer overheating and shutting off at an inconvenient time).

FLARES : Although called "flares", these are really small, finely tuned heat
decoys. A flare lures an IR missile toward it  (and away from you), but only
during the 2 to 3 seconds it burns.After that the flare dies and the missile
resumes seeking.Therefore,like chaff,the standard technique is to wait until
the missile is a couple of seconds away(the klaxon sounds),then drop a flare
while you turn away.

MANEUVERING : Maneuvering techniques against IR missiles are the same as th-
ose used against radar guided missiles.The only difference is that IR missi-
les tend to be smaller and more maneuverable. Second generation missiles are
often the most maneuverable,so you're best odf relying on decoy, jammer and/
or flares against them.Unlike radar guided SAMs,most IR SAMs are very maneu-
verable,with the ability to turn toward their target almost immediately aft-
er launch. As a result, flying low and close to a battery of maneuverable IR
SAMs is very dangerous!

WARNINGS & RESPONSES : Your first  warning of an IR missile attack can occur
at any time.A search or tracking radar may alert you,just like a radarguided
SAM attack.In fact,at that point you can't tell that an IR missile attack is
coming. However, when the missile is launched, the "I" missile warning light
goes on (rather  than the "R" light). In many cases your first warning of an
attack is the "I" missile warning light.This is because lots of cheap IRSAMs
have no search radar - just eyesight  searching. Your first warning is their
launch. If you know the missile is a first-generation homer, you can turn on
the IR jammer,change course and laugh it off. However,it pays to be wary.Ag-
ainst second generation  missiles the IR jcmmer may  still work - if you can
get outside its 45 degree field of view before it gets too close,or the jam-
mer overheats.The reduced airspeed due to using the jammer doesn't help,eit-
her.Otherwise, you'll have to  wait for the proximity  alarm klaxon. Many IR
missiles are fired from very short ranges,so short that the "I" light is al-
most immediately followed by the proximity alarm klaxon.When you hear the kl
axon and see the "I" light burning, your first act must be to drop a flare +
then dodge!

OUTMANEUVERING A MISSILE : -------------------------------------------------
Whether you're using jammers,decoys,or just plain guts, the basic principles
of outmaneuvering a missile remain the same.

EVADING THE MISSILE'S VIEW : SAMs can only home on targets within the acqui-
sition arc of their seeker.This arc is a bare 45 degrees ahea.If decoys,jam-
mers, or whatever temporarily  confuse a missile, you evade attack by moving
outside this 45 degree arc.Usually the quickest escape course is one perpen-
diculap to the missile's flight path.

TURNING INSIDE A MISSILE : When a missile  is close, you still have a chance
to outmaneuver him.Its turning arc is larger than yours.If the missile is tr
ying to fly up your tail,roll over onto a wingtip for a tight turn,then pull
back hard on the controlstick to tighten the turn further.Keep an eye on the
airspeed,since you can't stay long in this kind of a turn -soon the plane`ll
stall.But meanwhile,the missile is making a wider,faster turn that causes it
to zoom past harmlessly.

TURNING TOWARD A MISSILE : If a SAM approaches you  from the side, gradually
turn toward it,increasing the tightness of your turn as it comes closer. The
objective is to keep the missile's course at right angles (perpendicular) to
your own.This tactic works because the missile cannot turn with you. Instead
it gradually falls behind,zooming past your tail.

EVADING FRONTAL ATTACKS : If a SAM approaches you from the front, wait until
it's about  8 to 12 km away  (about 2/3rds of a grid square on  the tactical
display).Then make a quick 90 degree turn. This puts the missile facing your
side.Now roll over 180 degrees and turn toward the missile.Now you're set up
for a turning battle (see "Turning toward a Missile" above).

MISSILE MINIMUM RANGE : Large less-maneuverable missiles fire straight up wh
en first launched.This means that they can't begin homing until they're bey-
ond a certain distance (in range and altitude) from their launchers.As a re-
sult, circling right over a battery of low-maneuverability SAMs can actually
be very safe.

DOPPLER MISSILES : Enemy missiles with doppler guidancesystems are a special
danger.These missiles`ll not home on the chaff unless your course is perpen-
dicular (at right angles to) the missile. If the missile chases you from the
rear or attacks from straight ahead,chaff has no effect.Only three SAMs cur-
rently have doppler guidance:SA-10,SA-12,and SA-N-6.Only one AAM has doppler
guidance: the AA-10.

THE "DOPPLER CROSS" MISSILE EVASION: The F19 observes an enemy dopplerguided
SAM approaching, and until his course is  perpendicular (at right angles to)
the missile,Then the F-19 drops chaff or a decoy,and continues on a perpend-
icular course,keeping the missile at a constant range. Flying on a different
course can be disastrous, as the missile will "see" the doppler shift as you
change range.

STAR             : As in "getting your star".Refers to the much coveted pro-
                   motion from Colonel to General,where your rank insignia`s
                   now a single gold star.
VVI              : Vertical Velocity Indicator. A gauge  that indicates  how
                   fast a plane is ascending or descending.
WHISKEY DELTA    : Military expansion of the letters WD,which in turn refers
                   to weakness in a  certain male  organ rarely discussed in
                   polite company.The term is an especially derogatory + in-
                   sulting description of a fighter pilot (e,g."that Whiskey
                   Delta couldn't even find his own airbase,much less hit it
                   with a bomb.").
WING WEENIE      : Administrative staff off icer attached to a fighter unit,
                   but with no combat or  flying duties. A mildly derogatory
                   term.
ZERO-ZERO        : Nickname for  the zero-zero  type ejection seat. So named
                   because, in theory, a pilot can eject safely from a plane
                   with zero speed and zero altitude  (i.e.sitting on a run-
                   way).

HINTS,TIPS AND BUG REPORTS : ===============================================
In this game,the most commonly encountered SAMs are the SA14, SA10 and HAWK.
The SA14 is an IR SAM,and all you  have to do is stick the  IR jammer on! In
fact,sometimes you don't  even need to do that, as it often runs out of fuel
before it gets anywhere near you! The HAWK is also a bit of a loser.Just put
the ECM jammer on and it`ll fly blindly past. The SA10,however,is a bit more
dangerous.The best strategy is to dump a decoy,fly at right angles to the mi
ssile (use tactical map) and dump chaff if it gets close.And prcy...

Next,what weapons to choose... if you know that you are going to encounter a
lot of enemy aircraft,load up with Sidewinders.In fact,if you are on air-to-
air missions and the secondary target is a strike mission (not a recon miss-
ion),then take nothing but Sidewinders, unless you need extra fuel. Why take
no air-to-ground weapons? Because you have a very good gun! The gun can take
out just about anything, as long as you hit target in  the right place. When
strafing a ground target, it often helps to aim  slightly below target. This
definitely works when strafing SAM batteries.

Sidewinders are preferable to AMRAAMs most of the time,because you can carry
four Sidewinders in one bay,and only three AMRAAMs.And the Sidewinders actu-
ally seem to have the same range as an AMRAAM,over 35 kilometers! Never mind
that they should run out of fuel after 15-20 km, these are SuperSidewinders!
Against an aircraft flying towards you,you could probably get away with fir-
ing a Sidewinder at 40 km!

The gun also has a"longer range than the manual says.I've splashed MiGs that
were 18 km away,on numerous occasions.And it is VERY powerful! For instance,
I have destroyed the following targets with the gun... USS America (whoops),
Missile Boats,Oil Rigs,SAM Radars,Tank farms.I think just about anything can
be destroyed by the gun if your aim is true.

Dogfighting is EASY.First,the enemy doesn't use guns on you.Second,they har-
dly ever fire missiles when up close.And third,they have this great habit of
flying in straight lines (even Veterans).I don't know much about Elite enemy
pilots;I've only engaged them with AMRAAMs, and never got up close. But I do
know that Elite pilots seem to have a knack of avoiding Sidewinders that are
fired at long range (i.e. above 15 km).

What planes are friendly and what ones are hostile? Well,all Boeings are ci-
vilian airliners and the only other friendlies are the F18,so shoot anything
else flying into your path ...

Taking off is so easy I won't mention it. Landing is also surprisingly easy,
even on Realistic Landings you can come down very fast indeed and still come
out without a scratch.Carrier landings are tougher.If you don't hit the rear
quarter of the deck,then the arrestor wires won't catch you.If they do catch
you,you stop almost immediately,so you're ok! If you do miss them,then it IS
possible to stop just by using the brakes and shutting  down the engine, but
it will look very scary- the nosewheel will  hang over the edge of the deck!
Maybe even the main wheels too, so it'll look likg  you're hovering in front
of the carrier... this is because  the deck is a bit longer than it actually
is on screen.

Next is fuel.If you fly with the throttle around the half-way mark, you will
use fuel at a VERY  low rate. So low that you can  loiter for up to 1/2 hour
(real time) in any area, waiting for bad  guys to show  up (so you can shoot
them down!).Two disadvantages with  this throttle  setting are that you will
have to put down the flaps to stay in the air, and your airspeed`ll probably
be as low as 200 knots.Accelerated time is a good idea!

RADARS.I hate 'em! Damn things! Pulse radars aren't too worrying,but Doppler
ones are very dangerous - if  there are any near your flight path, take them
out with a Maverick,or you could risk going in and strafing the radar,but th
at means risking SAM launches against you.Missile boats are also best destr-
oyed if any are near your flight path. In mountainous areas, radars are less
of a problem;it's quite easy to zoom in and strafe one before it even reali-
qes you exist!

BUGS.The major one is that sometimes the plane flips upside down for no rea-
son! This can cause a crash if you are using autopilot at the time,as the du
mb autopilot tries  to correct by  rolling over and diving into the ground !
When the plane does this little party trick,it sometimes does an instant 180
degree turn as well! Another bug I've noticed is that when your plane is hea
vily damaged (8 out of the 9 damagelights were on),then selecting the damage
display (F6) locked up the game.Buv I only saw it do that once,because norm-
ally I'm so brilliant at the game that I don't get damaged (ego!). The final
bug I have had happen to me twice now;in Libya,for no apparent reason,it cra
shes out,displaying the  registers,exception type,etc. A little bit annoying
when I had spent half an hour sneaking around  mountains avoiding detection.
Oh well,at least it isn't as buggy as v1.01 (the version released on the con
tinent.That's Europe to you Americans!).
