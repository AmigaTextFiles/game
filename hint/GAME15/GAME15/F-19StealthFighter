The Red Banner Northern
 Russia's Northern Fleet offers both tempting targets and a significant threat.
Its modern Sovremennyy-class destroyers carry SA-N-7 missiles, while the
numerous Krivak-class frigates sport the SA-N-4. The larger Kiev-class carrier
has the powerful SA-N-6, a sea-going equivalent to the SA-10. These warships
are more than capable of defending themselves. Stationed off the northern
coast, they significantly extend the Soviet anti-aircraft umbrella.
 In addition to these ships' SAMs, the Kiev carries a complement of Yak-38
"jump-jet" fighter aircraft. While less capable than ground-based fighters, the
British Harriers in the Falklands taught the world not to underestimate the
capabilities of such planes.
 An upcoming addition to the northern fleet is a class of huge aircraft
carriers fitting out in the Crimea. Tentatively titled the "Kremlin" class,
these ships are expected to join the Northern Fleet soon.





Central Europe-----------------------------------------------------------------
Introduction
 Politics: Central Europe is where the full force of East and West meet. Since
World War II Europe has been two hostile Blocs, with a few neutrals balanced
between. On one side are the communist East European nations, created in the
wake of Soviet armies at the end of WWII. On the other side are democratic
Western European nations, created by the USA and Britain in the wake of their
armies during WWII. Since 1949 the West has been linked by NATO. In 1955 the
East formalized an equivalent organization, the Warsaw Pact, dominated by the
USSR. From then to now the two greatest military organizations on earth have
uneasily eyed each other along the German border.
(Bit out of date aren't we Microprose?)
 Military Forces: The Warsaw Pact can deploy almost three million men, about
80,000 armored fighting vehicles, and 6,000 combat aircraft. Against this
Juggernaut, the Western powers can field around two million men, 40,000 AFV's,
and 4,000 combat aircraft. The numerical imbalance is partially offset by the
higher quality of the Western troops and equipment, presumably along with the
traditional advantages of being the defender.
(Of course, the commies are bound to attack us, aren't they?)
 Together, the two sides have almost ten thousand nuclear weapons for
battlefield use in Europe. These range from small, sub-kiloton shells designed
to wipe out troop concentrations, up to multi-megaton city busters. Artillery,
planes, and missiles of all types and ranges can deliver these weapons. At one
time NATO felt it had to use nuclear weapons to compensate for numerical
inferiority. Today it has an alternative plan: "Air-land battle, 2000". In this
NATO uses superior technology, including its stealth planes, to attack deep in
the rear of the Warsaw Pact armies, destroying their logistical support. If
this innovative strategy works NATO need not use nuclear weapons to stem the
Red tide. However, if this fails, NATO must choose between a nuclear holocaust
and the conquest of Europe by the Soviet Union.
(Hello Comrade, have a beer! Better red than dead...)
 Geography: The "Central Front" stretches 1000 kilometers through the middle of
Germany, bordered on the north by the Baltic Sea, and on the south by the Alps.
The initial strategic objective of a Russian invasion would almost certainly be
the Rhine river, only 150 kilometers from the frontier (at the closest point).
West German terrain is mildly favourable to the defender, especially in the
forested and hilly southern half. The broad, flat North German Plain is the
traditional invasion route. But every few kilometers there is a new town,
village or city. Each could become a new defensive bastion.
 One often neglected geographic consideration is the terrain to the east of the
frontier. With the development of the "Air-land battle" this region takes on a
new significance. The North German plain broadens towards the east,
encompassing most of East Germany and Poland. It is crossed by a number of
major rivers flowing northward, channeling road and rail traffic into a variety
of bridges. This combination of open countryside and numerous "choke points" is
well suited to air operations.
_______________________________________________________________________________
Level of Conflict
 Cold War: This is the situation of the last 40 years. The two sides maintain a
wary posture, generally trying to avoid overt provocations, probing each other
to gain information, stir discontent in the enemy population, and gain
psychological advantages. The stealth fighter, designed for clandestine
penetration, is the perfect aircraft for the secret operations common in this
situation.
(If this is what the Americans are really up to, I think Britain should join
the far more sane Warsaw Pact!!)
 Limited War: Now the conflict is at the brink of open warfare, but armies
have not yet crossed any borders. As military acts escalate, the opportunity
for stealth missions increases as well. Military actions are political signals
that urge the other to back away in forceful terms. Unfortunately, sometimes
fighting just escalates. This technique was successful for America on Grenada
and against Libya, but it failed in Vietnam. Well, you're just a stealth pilot,
carrying out orders.
(Nazi soldiers were just "carrying out orders"...)
 Conventional War: This is it! Russian tanks pour over the West German border
while NATO forces scramble to stem the onrushing tide. On one side lies
conventional defeat, on the other the disaster of thermonuclear war. "Air-land
battle, 2000" goes into effect. Stealth aircraft, airmobile raiding groups, and
long range "smart" munitions make the dangerous crossing over the front to
hammer Soviet rear echelons. If they can isolate the Russian spearheads from
their base, they may give the politicians an opportunity to avert disaster.
(Microprose sound like they want World War 3!!)
_______________________________________________________________________________
Friendly Bases
 West Germany, Holland, and Denmark are studded with airfields that could serve
as bases for stealth raids into Eastern Europe. They form a gentle, north-south
crescent bulging west in the middle. Which is the most suitable starting point
for a particular airstrike depends mainly on the location of the target.
However, the stealth fighter's unique characteristics will be most affective in
the areas only thinly covered by radar to the north and south of the main
arena. Therefore, deep penetration raids will usually start from Denmark or
Southern Germany. Shorter tactical strikes, however, must fly directly into the
mouth of the tiger.
 Jutland Peninsula - Vandel (CC52) & Leck (CB59): These far northern bases make
ideal jump-off points for raids out across the Baltic. Often it's easier to
deal with missile boats in the Baltic than the heavier SAM defenses in East
Germany and Poland.
 Northern Germany (Hanover) - Ahlhorn (CB37) & Gutersloh (CB53): These bases,
directly behind BAOR (British Army Of The Rhine), face across the flat, densely
populated North German Plain, the most likely axis of advance should the Warsaw
Pact attack NATO. Therefore, they represent the most direct route to one of the
greatest concentrations of hostiles in the world.
(In 1990... I doubt it. Maybe Microprose missed the bit where all those heathen
commie states turned into nice clean wholesome democracies?)
 Central Germany (Westphalia) - Rhein-main (CB52) & Ramstein (CB50): These
bases are the great, famous bases of American air power in Europe. Rhein-main
is one of the largest military bases in the world, while Ramstein is
headquarters for the 4th Tactical Air Force.
 Southern Germany (Bavaria) - Neuberg (CA68), Leipheim (CA57) & Memmingen
(CA65): These bases are all Luftwaffe (air force of the Federal Republic of
Germany), but like many German bases, are entirely willing to host American
aircraft as needed. Any of these bases makes an excellent jump-off point for
missions into Czechoslovakia.
_______________________________________________________________________________
Sightseeing from the Baltic to Bohemia
 Without doubt, the most impressive sights in this region are the vast urban
metroplexes, from the northern ports of Hamburg (CB67) and Lubeck (CB77) to the
old cities of Leipzig (CB82) or Warsaw (DB95), or the industrial sprawl of
Prague (DB30) and Krakow (DB90). Those northern areas not covered with cities,
towns or villages are divided into small plots of farmland. Much of the area is
watered by extensive river systems flowing northward. Bridges large and small
are common near cities. An especially impressive suspension bridge can be found
on the southwestern outskirts of Hamburg (CB67). The southern part of this
region is dominated by low mountains that virtually surround the
Czechoslovakian lowlands of Bohemia (to the west) and Moravia (to the east).
The valleys and passes amid the mountains provide numerous natural routes, and
not a few flying challenges. Although much of the highland areas were once
forested, in the last few decades acid rain has denuded many areas and started
rampant erosion. The once green mountains are now more frequently brown, gray,
and black. The much higher Alps, capped by perpetual snow, are generally
obscured by haze to the southwest.
_______________________________________________________________________________
The Eastern Bloc
 East Germany: During a limited or conventional war the main strength of the
Warsaw Pact forces will travel through here, surging into West Germany. The
greates natural barrier in East Germany is the Elbe River, running from the
Czechoslovakian mountains northward to Hamburg. Destroying these river bridges
would cut off the Pact's forward troops from their supply lines.
 Covering the Pact's forward areas are two main air defense complexes, one in
the north near Wittstock (CB97) and Wittenburg (CB87), another in the south
just east of Leipzig and Magdeburg, including the big radars at Mittenwalde
(CB93) and Grossenhaim (CB92).
 Poland: In a NATO-Pact confict Poland is the "rear area" through which Russian
troops and supplies would flow toward the front lines. Many important
headquarters and depots are situated in the central and western part of the
nation. The Wista-Vistula river system divides Poland in half, from north to
south. Destroying the road and rail bridges can seriously damage Pact
operations. Polish defense complexes include a powerful system west of Gdansk
at Stupsk (DB48), and south of Lodz at Radom (DB83). In addition, Warsaw (DB95)
is a major transportation hub, so active SAM batteries can be expected in that
area during wartime.
 Czechoslovakia: This Pact nation, seperated from Germany by the mountains and
the rugged highlands of the Bohemian Forest, is likely to play a secondary role
in wartime. Czechoslovakian defenses are also somewhat lighter than those of
East Germany and Poland. Tabor (DA38) is the most significant installation. Far
to the east, guarding the entrance to Hungary and southern Poland, is another
defense complex at Konmamo (DA87).
 Kalingrad: This region of Russia, named after the major seaport of Kalingrad
(renamed from Konigsberg in 1945) at DB89, is the Soviet "front line" on the
Baltic. It includes a major OTH (over-the-horizon) radar station at EB09, as
well as the Klaipeda airbase (EC02).
_______________________________________________________________________________
Air Defenses
 Equipment: Since the "Central Front" forms the focal point of the war, the
anti-aircraft defenses on both sides are the most intensive in the world. The
Soviets are certain to deploy large quantities of their most modern weapons,
SA-10s and SA-12s, for area defense. In some areas the older, less effective
SA-5 long range systems may still be in place.
 Radar guided SA-8s and SA-11s are the most commonly used for more local
defenses, especially near important military concentrations or objectives. A
few are even sited near the larger SAM batteries to provide local defense. The
shorter-ranged infrared SA-9s and especially SA-13s may appear instead if the
radar-guided weapons are not available.
 At sea the Baltic missile boats typically have either SA-N-5 or SA-N-7
systems, although Krivaks and larger ships with the SA-N-4 can be expected in
wartime.
 Defended Areas: The whole region is alive with lethal metal. The most
dangerous areas will undoubtedly be on or near the front lines in West Germany,
and perhaps at any invasion sites in Denmark. Also beware of reserve troop
concentrations in East Germany or Poland. But these are relative assessments,
not absolute. Let down your guard anywhere and your aircraft will undoubtedly
follow.
_______________________________________________________________________________
Air Forces
 The Soviet Air Force is the largest in the world, and one of the most modern.
It deploys a wide variety of interceptor, bomber, and support aircraft. Some
are obsolescent, but many can meet the best of the West. The Soviets know the
value of air superiority. They'll give high priority to that goal in any
European war.
 Fighters: As always, the primary foe is another pilot. With 6,000 combat
aircraft to chose from, you can bet that the Red Air Force will find a few to
spare for you. They'll also have the hot new models. If you're lucky, you'll
only see second-line MiG-23s, but more likely you'll encounter quality
dogfighters like the MiG-29 and Su-27. In the rear areas you're more likely to
see long-range interceptors like the MiG-25 and MiG-31.
 Bombers: The Russians have many different bomber aircraft. One of the most
troublesome is the Tu-95 "Bear" modified to carry cruise missiles. Keeping a
number of these craft in orbit deep behind Russian lines gives them an
"untouchable" airborne nuclear force. Your job as an F-19 attacker is to prove
that this nuclear weapon can be hurt too.
 Airborne Early Warning & Control: The Soviet Il-76 "Mainstay" AEW&C was
designed for work in this kind of environment. Flying "racetrack" orbits deep
behind friendly lines, its powerful radars can see NATO air operations develop
and radio appropriate orders to various fighter squadrons. The effort to
develop these planes has been long and costly; the size, weight and expense of
the electronic gear is gigantic. Each plane is precious. Eliminating them would
cripple Soviet air operations. The Pact appreciates this too, so getting to
them won't be an easy job.
 Transports: Thousands of air transports will shuttle back and forth on both
sides of the front line, carrying troops, raiding parties, munitions, staff
officers, etc. The new Russian workhorse that flies anywhere and carries almost
anything is the An-72 "Coaler". Its high speed and short-field capability make
it the natural choice for secret missions, and a natural target for your
stealth fighter.
_______________________________________________________________________________
Naval Forces
 The Russian Baltic fleet, headquartered at Baltiysk outside of Kalingrad,
controls 4 cruisers, 16 destroyers (many of them obsolescent), 7 Krivak-class
large frigates, 22 missile boats and other light warships, and 21 amphibious
assault ships, as well as 45 submarines (mostly older diesel-electric models).
It also controls the East German and Polish navies, which have numerous
additional frigates and missile boats. This force has two goals: to cover the
northern flank of the Warsaw Pact from air attack, and to invade Denmark in
the event of war.
 Stealth missions will generally deal with the former, your problem being how
to penetrate the warship screen in the Baltic. Because of the many confusing
classes of Russian, Polish and East German missile boats and frigates, it's
always wise to check the data on a ship. The SA-N-5 is just a first generation
IR homer, and no serious threat. The SA-N-4 uses older pulse radar guidance,
but the new SA-N-7 is a more serious problem. Fortunately very few Baltic
warships carry the powerful, long-ranged SA-N-10.

Key to USAF Ordnance Summary

 Qty: The number of weapons of this type you can carry in one of your bay
positions (you have four weapons positions). The M61A1 cannon is fixed in the
nose and always available.
 Weapon: The name of the weapon.
 Max Range: The maximum range at which the weapon can be launched or fired
effectively.
 A 0km range means the weapon is a free-fall or retarded bomb that must be
dropped onto the target.
 Max Speed: The speed at which the weapon reaches the target. This is given in
knots so you can compare it with your own flight speed.
 glides means the weapon 'flies' without power. Therefore your speed, at the
time of launch, becomes the speed of the weapon.
 retarded means the weapon is a retarded bomb that falls away behind your
craft, decelerating as it drops. Some retarded weapons even open a parachute
during their descent, to stabilize the fall and line up the warhead(s).
 free fall means the weapon is a traditional free-fall bomb that arcs downward
to the target.
 Guidance System: If the weapon has an onboard targeting system, it is
mentioned here for general interest.
 Attack Altitude: The recommended altitude for the typical attack method. The
"500'+" entry means any altitude above 500 feet is fine. The "500'c" entry
means that a toss-bombing technique is used where the bomb is launched while
the plane climbs from 500 feet.
 Attack Techniques: This references the appropriate attack technique.
Techniques noted in second place (e.g. toss/level; level is the one we mean
here) are alternate attack methods that are either more dangerous or more
difficult to learn. See "How to Fight" earlier and "Air-to-Ground Tactics" for
more details.

Results Abbreviations
 The effectiveness of results is graded like a report card; the higher the
grade, the more effective the weapon.
 A+, A and A- means the weapons are especially effective against this target.
 B+, B and B- means the weapons are of normal accuracy and effectiveness
against this target.
 C+, C and C- means the weapons are not very effective against this target,
but may do damage if either you're skillful or lucky (or both).
 D means the weapon has marginal effectiveness against this target. You have
to be very skillful or very lucky to achieve an effective hit.
 F means the weapon is totally useless against this target. Any attacks will
be a complete waste of time and ordnance.

_______________________________________________________________________________
Key to Air-to-Air Missiles (AAMs)
 System Name: The name of the missile system.
 Plane: The type of plane which can carry the missile. If a specific plane is
listed, only those planes can carry that missile. Aircraft listed are
restricted to those commonly encountered.
  any USA means any plane of the US Air Force, but not current or former
American allies (and therefore not Iran).
  any Western means any plane of a western-allied nation, including former
American allies such as Iran, or neutrals such as Sweden.
  any USSR means any plane of a USSR-allied nation, including such Soviet
allies as Libya, Finland, Iraq, East Germany, Czecholslovakia, Poland, etc.
 Guidance System: How the missile finds its target.
  SAPR means Semi-active Pulse Radar. This requires that the launching plane
continue to "paint" the target with radar until the missile hits.
  ADR means Active Doppler Radar. The missile has its own radar set, allowing
the plane to "fire and forget". In addition, the missile's doppler radar is
only fooled by chaff if the target plane generates a small doppler (by running
perpendicular to the missile's course).
  IR1 means Infra-Red (First generation). The missile is a first generation
infrared homer. It chases the hot engine exhaust only, and is easily fooled by
jammers and flares.
  IR2 means Infra-Red (Second generation). The missile is a second generation
infrared homer. It aims at any hot part of a plane, including the nose, wings
and tail as well as the engine exhausts. It can recover from jamming and
continue seeking a target.
 Effective Range: The maximum range at which the missile can "lock on" to a
target.
 Maximum Speed: The launching speed of the missile. Mach 1 is about 660 knots
at sea level.

Key to Surface-to-Air Missiles (SAMs)

 Name: The commonly used name of the system.
 Mounting: How the system operates when seen.
  Site means fixed missile launchers are positioned around a central radar
station in a "star" pattern.
  Vehicles (plural) means the missile launchers and radars are mounted on
vehicles. The vehicles are usually parked on open ground in an irregular
pattern. Radars and missile launchers are on seperate vehicles, so they remain
fairly close together.
  Vehicle (singular) means each vehicle has both radars and missiles. Although
a battery usually has 2 to 4 vehicles, often widely dispersed.
  Warship means the radar and missile launcher are mounted on a warship.
  Infantry means the missile is man-packed, and therefore carried by ground
military units, including installation guards, as well as by well-equipped
terrorists.
 Search Guidance: The type and quality of search radar used by the missile.
Eyesight is a very poor search method.
  Doppler Radar measures the change in range; it is most effective when you
fly toward or away from it, least effective when you arc around it at a
constant distance.
  Pulse Radar bounces signals off a surface; it is most effective when you fly
sideways to it, least effective when you fly straight at it.
 Search Range: The theoretical maximum range of the search radar. However,
against your F-19 radar performance is greatly reduced. The quality of the
radar and local conditions determine its real, effective range.
 Firing Guidance: The way the missile finds your aircraft. Pulse and doppler
radars have varying effectiveness depending on your flight path in relation to
the missile (see search guidance, above, for details).
  BRPR means Beam-Rider pulse radar; the missile uses pulse radar guidance,
with the radar receiver at the launching site. It cannot "burn through" jamming
at close range.
  SAPR means Semi-Active pulse radar; the missile uses pulse radar guidance,
with the radar receiver in the missile. Therefore it may "burn through" jamming
at close range.
  SADR means Semi-Active doppler radar; the missile uses doppler radar
guidance, with the radar receiver in the missile. It too can "burn through"
jamming at close range.
  SACGDR means Semi-Active with Command Guidance doppler radar; the missile
uses doppler radar guidance, with the radar receiver in the missile. It can
"burn through" jamming at close range. In addition it has command guidance that
permits multiple attacks (should the first attack miss).
  IR1 means IR homing (first gen.); the missile uses infrared homing that
seeks hot exhausts. It is very vulnerable to both jamming and flares.
  IR2 means IR homing (second gen.); the missile uses infrared homing that
seeks any hot surface, including nose, wing edges, tail, etc. It has logic
circuits that help it recover from jamming or flares.
  Visual means the missile is guided by a controller on the ground, who must
watch your plane and react to your maneuvering.
 Firing Range: Maximum range at which the missile is fired.
 Max Speed: Maximum speed in flight of the missile. Mach 1 is about 520 to 660
kts.
 Max Alt: Maximum altitude the missile can reach.
 Maneuverability (M.): The turning ability of the missile in flight.





Air-to-Air Armament------------------------------------------------------------
F-19 Weaponry

M61A1 20mm "Vulcan"
Very short range general purpose gun
  Quantity: 1 fixed internally
  Effective Range: 3 km
  Maximum Range: 6 km
  Attack Technique: Tracking camera/laser historical gunsight
  Notes: This six-barrel gatling-gun type cannon is the standard internal
armament of most US fighters today, including the F-4, F-14, F-15, F-16 and
F-18. It can fire 6,000 rounds a minute, a high rate of fire that increases the
chance that a shell will be in the "same piece of sky" as the target aircraft.
Of course, this rate of fire also means that a wise pilot must fire in short
bursts (otherwise he'll quickly exhaust all his ammunition).
_______________________________________________________________________________
AIM-9M "Sidewinder"
Short range air-to-air missile with infrared homing
  Quantity on rack: 4
  Guidance: Second generation ("all aspect") infrared seeker
  Effective Range: 17 km
  Missile Speed: Mach 3+
  Missile Maneuverability: Excellent
  Attack Technique: Air-to-Air "fire and forget"
  Notes: Almost every aspect of this missile has been redesigned and upgraded
numerous times. The "M" model is the latest, with a greatly improved all-aspect
seeker head, a new warhead and an improved rocket engine. Although an "N" model
exists, it represents rebuilds of early "B" and "E" models and is less
reliable.
_______________________________________________________________________________
AIM-120A AMRAAM
Medium range air-to-air missile with active radar homing
  Quantity on rack: 3
  Guidance: Active radar homing (has its own radar in nose)
  Effective Range: 32 km
  Missile Speed: Mach 4
  Missile Maneuverability: Very good
  Attack Technique: Air-to-Air "fire and forget"
  Notes: This is the West's first radar-guided "fire and forget" missile. The
AMRAAM (advanced medium range air-to-air missile) has its own inertial
guidance, onboard track-while-scanning radar, and computerized target
discrimination. Pre-production and early production models are becoming
available to Stealth units.
_______________________________________________________________________________
Enemy Cannons

M61A1 20mm "Vulcan"
Very short range general purpose gun
  Effective Range: 3 km
  Maximum Range: 6 km
  Attack Technique: Radar predicting gunsight
  Notes: This gun is carried by Iranian F-4 Phantom and F-14 Tomcat fighters,
which were purchased from the USA in the 1970s (when Iran was still an American
ally).
_______________________________________________________________________________
GSh-23 23mm Cannon
Very short range general purpose gun
  Effective Range: 3 km
  Maximum Range: 6 km
  Attack Technique: Radar predicting gunsight
  Notes: This is the standard aerial cannon of USSR-built aircraft. It is a
twin-barrel design that fires about 3000 rds/minute. Range is equivalent to the
US weapon. The slow rate of fire (compared to the American M61) makes it a less
effective weapon. A six-barrel version with a rate of fire equivalent to the
American weapon may arm the MiG-29 and/or Su-27.
_______________________________________________________________________________
Enemy IR AAMs

AIM-9H "Sidewinder"
Short range air-to-air missile with infrared homing
  Effective Range: 12 km
  Missile Speed: Mach 3+
  Missile Maneuverability: Excellent
  Attack Technique: Locks onto tail exhaust, then "fire and forget"
  Notes: This was the most advanced model Sidewinder sold by America to Iran.
The missile is solid, reliable and easy to maintain - admirable features that
unfortunately means it must be taken seriously by American planes flying
against Iran.
_______________________________________________________________________________
AA-2 "Atoll"
Short range air-to-air missile with infrared homing
  Guidance: First generation infrared seeker
  Effective range: 14 km
  Missile Speed: Mach 2.5
  Missile Maneuverability: Very good
  Attack Technique: Locks onto tail exhaust, then "fire and forget"
  Notes: This early 1960s vintage IR missile is now obsolete. However, it was
produced in vast quantities and sold throughout the world to Soviet clients. As
a result, it is still carried by aircraft of poorer nations, as well as the
second-line planes of larger and richer nations.
_______________________________________________________________________________
AA-6 "Acrid" (IR)
Medium range air-to-air missile with infrared homing
  Guidance: First generation infrared seeker
  Effective range: 50 km
  Missile Speed: Mach 4
  Missile Maneuverability: Poor
  Attack Technique: Locks onto tail exhaust, then "fire and forget"
  Notes: Designed exclusively for the MiG-25 interceptor, this missile is an
IR version of the powerful AA-6 radar homer (see below).
_______________________________________________________________________________
AA-7 "Apex" (IR)
Medium range air-to-air missile with infrared homing
  Guidance: First generation infrared seeker
  Effective range: 34 km
  Missile Speed: Mach 3
  Missile Maneuverability: Fair
  Attack Technique: Locks onto tail exhaust, then "fire and forget"
  Notes: This missile is an IR version of the AA-7 radar guided AAM (see
below). It is most commonly found on MiG-23s.
_______________________________________________________________________________
AA-8 "Aphid"
Short range air-to-air missile with infrared homing
  Guidance: Early second generation infrared seeker
  Effective range: 12 km
  Missile Speed: Mach 3
  Missile Maneuverability: Excellent
  Attack Technique: All-aspect lock on, then "fire and forget"
  Notes: This small, lightweight missile is a pure dogfighting missile.
Although its IR seeker may be inferior to the AIM-9M, it is considerably
superior to earlier Soviet designs. This missile is replacing the now obsolete
AA-2, and is carried by just about every Soviet-built fighter, interceptor and
combat helicopter now in service. Soviet clients within Europe have the weapon,
as do an increasing number of client states and customers around the world.
_______________________________________________________________________________
AA-10 "Alamo" (IR)
Medium range air-to-air missile with infrared homing
  Guidance: Second generation infrared seeker
  Effective range: about 64 km
  Missile Speed: Mach 3+
  Missile Maneuverability: Good
  Attack Technique: All-aspect lock on, then "fire and forget"
  Notes: This missile is the IR version of the AA-10. It may be the longest-
ranged second-generation IR missile in the Soviet inventory today.
_______________________________________________________________________________
Enemy Radar AAMs

AIM-7E "Sparrow"
Medium range air-to-air missile with semi-active radar homing
  Guidance: Semi-active radar homing (requires radar guidance from plane)
  Effective range: 44 km
  Missile Speed: Mach 3.7
  Missile Maneuverability: Very good
  Attack Technique: Semi-active radar guided from launching aircraft
  Notes: Nicknamed "The Great White Hope" because of its prominent exhaust
plume, this missile was America's standard radar AAM in the 1960s and 1970s.
The missile is not especially accurate, and depends on a close match with the
firing aircraft's radar. Both the missile and radar demand regular and exacting
maintenance. Although Iranian F-4s have this weapon, all these drawbacks
greatly compromise its effectiveness.
_______________________________________________________________________________
AA-6 "Acrid" (Radar)
Long range air-to-air missile with semi-active radar homing
  Guidance: Semi-active radar homing (requires radar guidance from plane)
  Effective range: 50 km
  Missile Speed: Mach 4
  Missile Maneuverability: Poor
  Attack Technique: Semi-active radar guided from launching aircraft
  Notes: This huge missile is the standard long-range armament of PVO MiG-25
interceptors, and is roughly equivalent (though technically inferior) to the
Phoenix AAM on the F-14. The missile is matched purely to the MiG-25; other
aircraft cannot control it. MiG-25Rs sold to Soviet client states are not
normally equipped with this weapon.
_______________________________________________________________________________
AA-7 "Apex" (Radar)
Medium range air-to-air missile with semi-active radar homing
  Guidance: Semi-active radar homing (requires radar guidance from plane)
  Effective range: 34 km
  Missile Speed: Mach 3
  Missile Maneuverability: Poor
  Attack Technique: Semi-active radar guided from launching aircraft
  Notes: This was the standard USSR radar homing missile of the 1970s, the
Russian equivalent of the AIM-7 "Sparrow". It requires a matching aircraft
radar, found in MiG-23s of the USSR and Warsaw Pact. Many MiG-23s sold to
smaller Soviet clients outside of Europe had inferior radars incapable of
controlling this missile.
_______________________________________________________________________________
AA-9 "Amos"
Long range air-to-air missile with semi-active radar homing
  Guidance: Semi-active radar homing (requires radar guidance from plane)
  Effective range: 82 km
  Missile Speed: Mach 3.5
  Missile Maneuverability: Fair
  Attack Technique: Semi-active radar guided from launching aircraft
  Notes: This new, large missile is a revision or redesign of the AA-6 "Acrid"
and is designed exclusively for the MiG-31 interceptor. There are some reports
that the missile is an active radar homer (i.e., has its own radar), allowing
"fire and forget" launching. There is even speculation that the missile could
receive mid-course corrections from the launching aircraft or a ground radar
station, but it is unlikely that Russian computer electronics are capable of
successfully implementing this yet.
_______________________________________________________________________________
AA-10 "Alamo"
Medium range air-to-air missile with active radar homing
  Guidance: Active radar homing (has its own radar in nose)
  Effective range: 64 km
  Missile Speed: Mach 3+
  Missile Maneuverability: Good
  Attack Technique: Active radar homing independent of launching aircraft
  Notes: This new, medium-sized radar AAM is strongly believed to be an active
radar homer, that is, it carries its own onboard radar for "fire and forget"
use, like the AIM-120 AMRAAM. It is commonly found on the new MiG-29 and Su-27.
_______________________________________________________________________________

Air-to-Ground Armament---------------------------------------------------------

M61A1 20mm Cannon
 The 20mm cannon listed in the air-to-air armament section can be used against
ground targets as well.

_______________________________________________________________________________
Guided Missiles

Penguin-3 ASM
Medium-altitude infrared-homing anti-ship missile
  Quantity per bay: 2
  Acceptable (grade B) Targets: Ships at sea
  Effective Range: 32 kilometers
  Maximum Speed: Mach 0.8
  Attack Technique: Air-Ground fire-and-forget launch against any worship
  Minimum Launch Altitude: 500'
  Maximum Launch Altitude: 40,000'
  Notes: Designed by Norway, this modestly-sized and priced missile is aimed
at a point on the surface, and flies there under its own inertial guidance. At
this pre-designated point the missile switches on an infrared homer, seeking
out the heat of a ship against the cool ocean background. The missile is not a
sea-skimmer, and is therefore easier to shoot down. However, the missile's
guidance system are entirely passive (unlike the Harpoon, which broadcasts its
presence with radar signals). Although maximum range in high altitude launch
is supposedly 80 kilometers, the range used here is appropriate to a lower
altitude attack. Supplies of this weapon are limited because the US government
is reluctant to purchase weapons from the same source that sold important
military technology to the USSR in 1981.
_______________________________________________________________________________
AGM-84A "Harpoon"
Sea-skimming radar & inertial-guided anti-ship missile
  Quantity per bay: 1
  Optimum (grade A) Targets: Ships at sea
  Effective Range: 60 kilometers
  Maximum Speed: Mach 0.8
  Attack Technique: Air-Ground fire-and-forget launch against any worship
  Minimum Launch Altitude: 500'
  Maximum Launch Altitude: 40,000'
  Notes: The Harpoon is the standard anti-ship missile of the American Navy
and Air Force. This weapon is more powerful, longer ranged and harder to stop
than the Penguin. It is launched under inertial guidance with considerable
computer assistance, flying at sea-skimming altitudes to avoid detection. At a
pre-programmed point it turns on its radar, to find and home in on the target.
Depending on the terminal guidance package installed it will either pop up and
dive on the target, or fly straight in. Like most anti-shipping missiles, the
remaining rocket fuel is almost as destructive as the warhead itself.
(At this point, I think PP Sledgehammer would like me to say that the Harpoon
is a piece of garbage, and Seawolf beats the crap out of it...)
_______________________________________________________________________________
AGM-88A HARM
High speed anti-radiation ("homes on radar") missile
  Quantity per bay: 1
  Optimum (grade A) Targets: Ground radar stations
  Acceptable (grade B) Targets: Warship radars
  Effective Range: 20 kilometers
  Maximum Speed: Mach 2+
  Attack Technique: Air-Ground fire-and-forget launch against any radar
  Minimum Launch Altitude: 500'
  Maximum Launch Altitude: 60,000'
  Notes: This is America's most advanced anti-radar missile. It can lock and
home on hostile radars even if they jump frequencies or switch off. The US
Defense Department has hinted that it can even home on radar set components
that are still warm, even if the set itself is turned off! The missile also has
a "loiter" mode where it is fired blind and circles, waiting for a hostile
radar to appear so it can attack it. The "loiter" attack mode is not available
to HARMs carried on the F-19.
(Sledge... is ALARM better than this one?!)
_______________________________________________________________________________
AGM-65D "Maverick"
Thermal-imaging air-to-ground guided missile
  Quantity per bay: 2
  Acceptable (grade B) Targets: Bridges, bunkers, radar sites, oil facilities,
ships
  Poor (grade C) Targets: Airbase hangars, ground planes, buildings, depots,
missile sites
  Effective Range: 32 kilometers
  Maximum Speed: Mach 1+
  Attack Technique: Air-Ground fire-and-forget launch
  Minimum Launch Altitude: 500'
  Maximum Launch Altitude: 40,000'
  Notes: The Maverick is America's standard air-to-ground guided missile, and
has a wide variety of guidance systems. The original design put a simple video
camera in the missile's nose. While the missile remained attached to the plane
the pilot used a miniature stick and screen to aim the bomb at the target
below, locked it in, and released the weapon. Once in flight the bomb steered
toward the image locked into its computer brain. Later versions added zoom-
lenses, PAVE TACK lasers, and ultimately, in the "D" model, a FLIR (forward-
looking infrared) thermal imaging system that can "see" through clouds, smoke,
and night. The missile usually carries a shaped-charge warhead for maximum
effect against hardened targets impervious to normal bombing attacks. However,
high explosive warheads can be fitted instead for maximum destructive effect
against unarmored targets.
_______________________________________________________________________________
Laser-Guided Bombs

GBU-12 Paveway
Laser-guided glide bomb
  Quantity per bay: 2
  Acceptable (grade B) Targets: Hangars, buildings, bridges, bunkers, depots,
missile sites, radar sites, oil facilities
  Poor (grade C) Targets: Ships
  Effective Range: 2 kilometers per 1K' of altitude
  Maximum Speed: Glide bomb
  Attack Technique: Toss bombing or level bombing
  Toss Bombing Attack Altitude: 500' and climb
  Level Bombing Attack Altitude: 2,000' and turn away
  Notes: The GBU-12 is one of the standard laser-guided bombs in the US
armory. Large fighter-bombers like the F-111 favor heavier 1,000lb and 2,000lb
models, but the F-19 must carry lighter weight munitions in its small bays. The
Pave Tack guidance system is the most accurate way of placing a bomb on a
target (short of using a guided missile like the Maverick). The advantage of
using a bomb is that the weapon weight is almost entirely explosive, while
guided missiles must, of necessity, use some of their weight for the rocket
motor.
_______________________________________________________________________________
CBU-72 FAE
Laser-guided triple fuel-air explosive ("overpressure") bomb
  Quantity per bay: 2
  Optimum (grade A) Targets: Buildings
  Acceptable (grade B) Targets: Submarine pens, hangars, bunkers, oil
platforms
  Poor (grade C) Targets: Ships
  Effective Range: 2 kilometers per 1K' of altitude
  Maximum Speed: Glide bomb
  Attack Technique: Toss bombing or level bombing
  Toss Bombing Attack Altitude: 500' and climb
  Level Bombing Attack Altitude: 2,000' and turn away
  Notes: This weapon contains a mixture of three heavier-than-air gases. When
the bomb lands, the gases are released into the air, forming an explosive
mixture. A delayed-action fuse ignites the mixture, which causes the
contaminated air to burn. As well as incinerating everything, the burning gas
expands instantly. In the open air this is sufficient to set off mines and
flatten soft objects (such as men). However, in an enclosed space the effect is
vastly magnified, with the walls, floor and roof of the structure broken and
blown apart. The result in underground structures, like submarine pens, is
total destruction.
_______________________________________________________________________________
Mk 20 "Rockeye" II
Laser-guided high-explosive cluster bomb
  Quantity per bay: 2
  Acceptable (grade B) Targets: Grounded planes, buildings, depots, missile
sites, radar sites, oil facilities, ships
  Effective Range: 2 kilometers per 1K' of altitude
  Maximum Speed: Glide bomb
  Attack Technique: Toss bombing or level bombing
  Toss Bombing Attack Altitude: 500' and climb
  Level Bombing Attack Altitude: 2,000' and turn away
  Notes: This weapon marries a laser-guided glide-bomb system with a Mk 20
Rockeye cluster munition (see below). The laser guidance allows for earlier
release and greater bomblet release accuracy. With an area weapon like a
cluster bomb the former is more important, since it gives an increased safety
margin to the launching aircraft.
_______________________________________________________________________________
Mk 20 "Rockeye"
Retarded fragmentation cluster bomb
  Quantity per bay: 2
  Acceptable (grade B) Targets: Grounded planes, buildings, depots, missile
sites, radar sites, oil facilities
  Poor (grade C) Targets: Ships
  Effective Range: Nil
  Maximum Speed: Retarded bomb
  Attack Technique: Low-altitude level bombing
  Level Bombing Attack Altitude: 500'
  Notes: This cluster bomb breaks open about 100' above the surface, spinning
out 247 shaped-charge bomblets that can destroy buildings, armored vehicles,
and people. The opening height and pattern can be pre-set for various types of
targets. The U.S. Navy discovered these bombs were effective against small
warships when a single cluster bomb wrecked a Libyan Nanuchka-class missile
boat in 1986. Of course, not all warships are as vulnerable.
_______________________________________________________________________________
Durandal Bomb
Parachute-deployed runway-penetration bomb
  Quantity per bay: 2
  Optimum (grade A) Targets: Runways
  Poor (grade C) Targets: Bridges
  Effective Range: Nil
  Maximum Speed: Retarded bomb
  Attack Technique: Low-altitude level bombing
  Level Bombing Attack Altitude: 500'
  Notes: This is the standard anti-runway weapon in the USAF arsenal, even
though it's French made. When the Durandal is released over target it deploys
a parachute. This causes it to float nose-down and roughly stationary over the
runway surface. Then its rocket motor ignites, blasting the warhead straight
down through the concrete, where a delayed action fuse explodes it. This heaves
up large sections of runway surface, while smaller shards fly hundreds of feet
through the air. The result is a thoroughly ruined surface and tons of wreckage
that requires both heavy equipment and considerable time to repair.
_______________________________________________________________________________
ISC B-1 Minelets
Parachute-deployed minelet dispenser
  Quantity per bay: 1
  Optimum (Grade A) Targets: Runways
  Poor (Grade C) Targets: Buildings, depots, missile sites, oil facilities on
land
  Effective Range: Nil
  Maximum Speed: Retarded bomb
  Attack Technique: Low altitude level bombing
  Level bombing attack altitude: 500'
  Notes: This new weapon breaks open at altitude and dispenses a variety of
small anti-personnel, anti-vehicle and delayed fuse mines. Used on airfields
they prevent flight operations until cleared. They can also cause problems
around open-air structures such as refineries, oil wells etc. Clearing the
mines is complicated by the variety of types, as well as random delayed-fuse
bombs (i.e., you'll never know when another will explode!).
_______________________________________________________________________________
Mk 82-1 "Snakeye"
Retarded high-explosive ("iron") bomb
  Quantity per bay: 3
  Acceptable (Grade B) Targets: Grounded planes, buildings, depots, oil
facilities on land
  Poor (Grade C) Targets: Radar sites
  Effective Range: Nil
  Maximum Speed: Retarded bomb
  Attack Technique: Low altitude level bombing
  Level bombing attack altitude: 500'
  Notes: Retarded bombs use parachutes ar vanes to slow their descent, allowing
the plane to clear the area before they land and explode. As a result they can
be dropped from a lower altitude than free-fall bombs. However, they are less
accurate, making them unsuitable against small targets. For the most accurate
release, retarded bombs should be dropped in level flight. The Snakeye is the
standard vane-type retarder unit for many US bombs, here attached to the Mk 82
500 lb. high-explosive bomb.
_______________________________________________________________________________
Mk 35 IN Cluster
Retarded incendiary cluster bomb
  Quantity per bay: 2
  Optimum (Grade A) Targets: Grounded planes, depots, missile sites, oil
facilities
  Acceptable (Grade B) Targets: Buildings
  Poor (Grade C) Targets: Radar sites, ships
  Effective Range: Nil
  Maximum Speed: Retarded bomb
  Attack Technique: Low-altitude level bombing
  Level bombing attack altitude: 500'
  Notes: This cluster bomb is similar to the Rockeye, but filled with 57
incendiary bomblets. The cluster breaks apart in mid-air, spreading the
bomblets over an area of several hundred yards. Then each bomblet spreads a
burning liquid wherever it lands. The result is a raging fire that completely
covers a wide area.
_______________________________________________________________________________
Free-Fall Bombs

MK 82-0 "Slick"
Free fall high explosive ("iron") bomb
  Quantity per bay: 3
  Acceptable (Grade B) Targets: Buildings, depots, oil facilities on land
  Poor (Grade C) Targets: Hangars, grounded planes, missile sites, radar
sites, oil platforms, ships.
  Effective Range: Nil
  Maximum Speed: Free-fall bomb
  Attack Technique: Level bombing or dive bombing
  Level bombing attack altitude: 3,000'
  Dive bombing attack altitude: Dive from 8,000', release at 3,000'
  Notes: This weapon is the traditional 500 lb high explosive bomb, virtually
unchanged in concept since WWII. The effectiveness of this bomb depends almost
entirely on the skill of the bomber. The most important consideration when
using "iron" bombs is that releases below 2000' don't give the bomb time to arm
in flight, causing "dud" hits. This occurred in the Falklands war of 1982, when
Argentine pilots repeatedly hit British ships with bombs dropped from 50' to
100'. Not one bomb exploded.
(Yeah, more than one exploded!)
_______________________________________________________________________________
MK 122 "Fireye"
  Free fall incendiary ("fire") bomb
  Quantity per bay: 2
  Acceptable (Grade B) Targets: Grounded planes, buildings, depots, oil
facilities on land.
  Poor (Grade C) Targets: Hangars, bunkers, missile sites, radar sites, oil
platforms, ships.
  Effective Range: Nil
  Maximum Speed: Free-fall bomb
  Attack Technique: Level bombing or dive bombing
  Level bombing attack altitude: 3,000'
  Dive bombing attack altitude: Dive from 8,000', release at 3,000'
  Notes: This weapon contains an incendiary gel that spreads a burning liquid
over a wide area. The liquid can flow into vents, grates, weapon slits, etc.,
making it effective against vehicles and fortifications as well as open-air
targets. Of course, the bomb must be placed on the target with some accuracy to
achieve this effect. Bombing skill is extremely important with this weapon.
_______________________________________________________________________________
Other Equipment

135mm/IR Camera
Visual and Infrared photographic reconnaissance camera
  Quantity per bay: 1
  Targets: Any
  Effective Range: Not Applicable
  Maximum Speed: Not Applicable
  Attack Technique: Level low-altitude photographic run
  Photo run altitude: 200'
  Notes:@5 This pallette contains a 135mm high resolution camera for use in
visible light and, and a second camera for infrared (IR) thermal photography.
Both photographs are taken simultaneously under pilot control. When this camera
is deployed through the bomb bay, the F-19's tracking camera is "frozen" into a
pre-programmed position, allowing it to function as a viewer for the big 135mm
lens.

  Maximum Speed: Not Applicable
  Attack Technique: Airdrop from level flight or land at airstrip
  Airdrop altitude: 500' to 1000'
  Notes:@5 Airdropped equipment in the F-19 uses a simple ripcord-and-chute
design. When the equipment package is released from the weapons bay, a long
ripcord remains attached. Within a second the cord draws taught and pulls open
the chute.





Surface-to-Air Missile Systems-------------------------------------------------
SAM Technical Specifications
 Radar Ratings: Pulse radars are generally less effective than doppler radars.
Obsolescent radars of either type are greatly inferior to modern radars. As a
result, modern doppler radars are the most dangerous, while obsolescent pulse
radars are the least dangerous.
 Ranges are given in kilometers. Note that a maximum firing range is often less
than the maximum search range, due to the limited fuel carried by most
missiles.
 Guidance Systems: Radar guided missiles, with or without command guidance, are
confused by your ECM jammer unless they are very close. If they are close,
chaff is needed instead. Infrared guided missiles are confused by your IR
jammer unless very close, where flares are used instead. A decoy is effective
against any type of missile.
 Visually guided missiles cannot be fooled, but are usually slow reacting,
allowing you to outmaneuver them fairly easily.
 Maximum speed is a useful measure of whether you can outrun a missile, and how
much reaction time you have if one is fired. Mach 1 or 2 missiles are fairly
slow and easier to deal with. Mach 3 or faster missiles are much more
formidable opponents.
 Maximum altitude is also a useful measure, since in some cases you can fly
above the missile's ceiling.
 Maneuverability indicates how easy it is to outmaneuver the missile. The less
maneuverable the missile, the better your chance of turning perpendicular to
its course and outmaneuvering it.
_______________________________________________________________________________
Radar-Controlled SAMs
 The standard long-range SAM is controlled by radar. First the search radar
scans the sky to find your plane. Search radars are graphically portrayed in
the pre-flight briefing, and on your cockpit CRT maps.
 When the search system finds your plane, it will "hand off" the prospective
target to a narrow beam fire control radar, usually running on a different
frequency. The "TRAK" warning light in the cockpit alerts you whenever a
narrow-beam tracking radar "paints" your craft. Tracking continues while the
missile is airborne.
 Beam Rider radar guided missiles are the least flexible. They "ride" the
controlling radar's beam. They can be easily jammed, have poor maneuverability,
and cannot "turn around" for a second attack if they miss.
 Semi-Active radar guided missiles are more flexible. They can "burn through"
jamming as they approach the target, and often have better maneuverability.
However, like beam-riders, they cannot "turn around" for a second attack if
they miss.
 Command Guidance radar-guided missiles are the most flexible. Like semi-active
missiles, they can burn through jamming at short distances and have good
maneuverability. In addition, they can be commanded to turn around and try
again if they miss on the first pass.

SA-2 Guideline
Long-range fixed-site radar-homing SAM.
  Battery configuration: Radar bunker with missile emplacements
  Search System: Obsolescent pulse radar
  Maximum Search Range: 200 kilometers
  Guidance System: Obsolescent pulse radar "beam-rider"
  Maximum Firing Range: 125 kilometers
  Maximum Speed: Mach 3+
  Maximum Altitude: 55,000'
  Maneuverability: Very poor
  Notes: This very old system is used by many third world nations outfitted
with Soviet equipment. Although the radar systems have been upgraded over the
last two decades, they are still inferior to modern systems. The last time
SA-2s were used effectively was in the air defense of North Vietnam in the
early 70s. Today it is almost worthless.
_______________________________________________________________________________
SA-5 Gammon
Long-range fixed-site radar-homing SAM.
  Battery configuration: Radar bunker with missile emplacements
  Search System: Obsolescent pulse radar
  Maximum Search Range: 350 kilometers
  Guidance System: Obsolescent pulse radar "beam-rider"
  Maximum Firing Range: 150 kilometers
  Maximum Speed: Mach 3
  Maximum Altitude: 95,000'
  Maneuverability: Poor
  Notes: The SA-5 is the largest and longest ranged SAM in the world today.
However, bigger is not always better. Missile accuracy at extreme ranges is
poor, its radar control system mediocre, and the huge missile has very poor
maneuverability. Still, the extreme range poses a formidable threat. In its
1986 exchanges with Libya, the US Navy's first priority was disabling the SA-5
Gammon batteries with HARM missiles.
_______________________________________________________________________________
SA-10 Grumble
Long-range fixed-site or vehicular radar-homing SAM.
  Battery configuration: Radar bunker or armored vehicle with missile
emplacements or armored vehicle missile launchers.
  Search System: Phased-array doppler radar
  Maximum Search Range: 320 kilometers
  Guidance System: Modern doppler radar and command guidance
  Maximum Firing Range: 125 kilometers
  Maximum Speed: Mach 3
  Maximum Altitude: Over 70,000'
  Maneuverability: Fair
  Notes: This semi-mobile all-altitude defense system was originally
designed to defend the borders of the USSR from both cruise missiles and
aircraft. However, recent failures to detect and engage low-flying aircraft
suggest this system is less than perfect. The SA-10 is a "new generation" long
range air defense weapon designed to replace the obsolescent SA-5 Gammon.
Because this weapon is new, details may be innaccurate.
_______________________________________________________________________________
SA-4 Ganef
Medium-range fixed-site or vehicular radar-homing SAM.
  Battery configuration: Radar bunker with missile emplacements, or radar and
launcher on tracked vehicles
  Search System: Obsolescent pulse radar
  Maximum Search Range: 100 kilometers
  Guidance System: Obsolescent pulse radar & semi-active radar homing
  Maximum Firing Range: 70 kilometers
  Maximum Speed: Mach 2.5
  Maximum Altitude: 75,000'
  Maneuverability: Very poor
  Notes: The SA-4 was Russia's first mobile, battlefield SAM, designed to
accompany large military formations as they maneuver on the battlefield. It
operates in the rear areas of the front lines, attacking aircraft that IR SAMs
fail to hit. The SA-4 entered service in the 1960s. It is now obsolescent,
found only in 2nd and 3rd line Russian units. It has been sold extensively to
Russian allies and client states.
_______________________________________________________________________________
SA-12 Gladiator
Medium/long-range site or vehicular radar-homing SAM.
  Battery configuration: Temporary site with radar and missile launchers, or
dispersed radar and launcher vehicles
  Search System: Phased-array doppler radar
  Maximum Search Range: 290 kilometers
  Guidance System: Modern doppler radar and command guidance
  Maximum Firing Range: 150 kilometers
  Maximum Speed: Mach 3+
  Maximum Altitude: Over 70,000'
  Maneuverability: Fair
  Notes: This very new system is believed to be a semi-mobile SAM designed to
accompany armies, deploying far to the rear. From that position the missile can
provide a wide umbrella of defense against both air raids and missile attacks.
Because this weapon is quite new, the details may be innaccurate.
_______________________________________________________________________________
SA-6 Gainful
Medium-range vehicular radar-homing SAM.
  Battery configuration: Radar and launcher on tracked vehicles
  Search System: Obsolescent pulse radar
  Maximum Search Range: 80 kilometers
  Guidance System: Obsolescent pulse radar and command guidance
  Maximum Firing Range: 30 kilometers
  Maximum Speed: Mach 2.8
  Maximum Altitude: 60,000'
  Maneuverability: Fair
  Notes: This medium ranged battlefield SAM is also obsolescent in the
Russian army, but extensively used by the first-line forces of Soviet allies
and client states. It is designed to accompany combat troops, protecting them
from positions only a short distance behind the front lines. The missile was
very effective in the first few days of the 1973 Arab-Israeli War, but soon
succumbed to advanced ECM jammers.
_______________________________________________________________________________
SA-8 Gecko
Medium-range vehicular radar-homing SAM.
  Battery configuration: Radar and launcher on a single vehicle
  Search System: Modern pulse radar
  Maximum Search Range: 125 kilometers
  Guidance System: Modern pulse radar, semi-active with video backup
  Maximum Firing Range: 65 kilometers
  Maximum Speed: Mach 2
  Maximum Altitude: 25,000'
  Maneuverability: Good
  Notes: This shorter-ranged but higher quality successor to the SA-6 was the
standard "up front" radar SAM of the Soviet Army in the 1970s and early 1980s.
Now being replaced by the SA-11, it is likely to appear among the armies of
Russia's allies and client states soon.
_______________________________________________________________________________
SA-11 Gadfly
Medium-range vehicular radar-homing SAM.
  Battery configuration: Radar and launcher on a single vehicle
  Search System: Modern doppler radar
  Maximum Search Range: 200 kilometers
  Guidance System: Modern pulse radar, backup unknown
  Maximum Firing Range: 100 kilometers
  Maximum Speed: Mach 2.5
  Maximum Altitude: 45,000'
  Maneuverability: Good
  Notes: This weapon is the "next generation" battlefield radar SAM designed
to replace the SA-6 and SA-8. The weapon is very new, and details may well be
inaccurate.
_______________________________________________________________________________
MIM-23B Hawk
Medium-range fixed-site radar-homing SAM.
  Battery configuration: Radar bunker or trailer with missile launcher
emplacements or trailers
  Search System: Moder pulse radar
  Maximum Search Range: 175 kilometers
  Guidance System: Modern pulse radar and command guidance
  Maximum Firing Range: 125 kilometers
  Maximum Speed: Mach 1.5
  Maximum Altitude: 52,000'
  Maneuverability: Good
  Notes: The HAWK has long been the standard SAM of the USA, with various
models exported to allies, including Iran. Lt.Colonel North's famous arms deal
to Iran included extra parts and missiles for HAWK batteries, then Iran's most
powerful air defense system. This missile was adequate for the 1970s, but is no
longer "state of the art" against first-line 1980s aircraft. The US Army's
replacement, the MIM-104 "Patriot" has not been sold to any other nation.
_______________________________________________________________________________
Rapier
Short-range fixed-site visual/radar-homing SAM.
  Battery configuration: Combined radar and launcher pedestal, or on tracked
vehicle.
  Search System: Modern pulse radar
  Maximum Search Range: 75 km
  Guidance System: Optical command guidance with semi-active pulse radar backup
  Maximum Firing Range: 65 km
  Maximum Speed: Mach 2+
  Maximum Altitude: 24,000'
  Maneuverability: Very good
  Notes: This is a British high-precision, high-speed SAM for general
battlefield defense (roughly equivalent to the SA-8). However it is greatly
hampered by its short range, and was not very effective in the Falklands for
this reason. Fixed pedestal versions were sold to the Iranian air force for
airbase defense.
_______________________________________________________________________________
SA-N-4
Medium-range area-defense naval SAM.
  Battery configuration: Integral to warship
  Search System: depends on the ship, usually some type of pulse radar
  Maximum Search Range: Depends on the ship. Typically 100-200 km
  Guidance System: Modern pulse radar with video backup
  Maximum Firing Range: 30 kilometers
  Maximum Speed: Mach 2
  Maximum Altitude: 25,000'
  Maneuverability: Good
  Notes: This missile is the naval version of the SA-8 Gecko, used on some
cruisers, frigates, newer missile boats (including the Nanuchka class), and
amphibious warfare ships. The twin missile launcher pops up from an armored
silo when ready to fire. The missiles can be fired against surface ships as
well as airplanes, but are ineffective against modern anti-ship cruise
missiles. This is a serious drawback, since many cruisers have a longer range
than this SAM.
_______________________________________________________________________________
SA-N-6
Medium-range area-defense naval SAM.
  Battery configuration: Integral to warship
  Search System: Phased array doppler radar
  Maximum Search Range: 300+ kilometers
  Guidance System: Modern doppler radar and command guidance
  Maximum Firing Range: 125 kilometers
  Maximum Speed: Mach 3
  Maximum Altitude: over 70,000'
  Maneuverability: Average
  Notes: This is the naval version of the SA-10 Grumble long-range air-defense
SAM, mounted on the Kiev-class aircraft carriers and Kirov-class
battlecruisers. It is an excellent all-altitude weapon capable of reaching out
long distances to intercept incoming airstrikes before they launch their own
missiles, as well as planes that approach more closely. It is also designed to
shoot down incoming cruise missiles, should a hostile aircraft manage to launch
one.
_______________________________________________________________________________
SA-N-7
Medium-range area-defense naval SAM.
  Battery configuration: Integral to warship
  Search System: depends on ship, usually modern doppler radar
  Maximum Search Range: depends on the ship, 50 to 200 kilometers
  Guidance System: Modern pulse radar, backup unknown
  Maximum Firing Range: 100 kilometers
  Maximum Speed: Mach 2.5
  Maximum Altitude: 45,000'
  Maneuverability: Good
  Notes: This is the naval equivalent of the SA-11 Gadfly, found on Sovremennyy
class and later destroyers. It is a good self-defense weapon against air
attacks that fly near or over the ship, but lacks the range to engage distant
planes launching anti-ship cruise missiles. This missile is not good enough to
shoot down anti-ship cruise missiles, but the Sovremennyys carry 30mm gatling
guns for that job.
_______________________________________________________________________________
Short Range IR & Visual SAMs
 Expensive, sophisticated short range SAMs rely on search radars, but the less
expensive designs use simple eyesight. Once acquired, the target may be tracked
by eyesight, cameras or radar.
 If the missile is an IR homer, it is aimed along the tracking line, and its
infrared seeker turned on. When the seeker locks onto the target the missile is
launched. From that point onward the missile steers itself, using its seeker.
 Infrared seekers home on heat sources. "First generation" seekers were easily
confused by the sun, common distress flares, even greenhouses or sun-heated
rocks. More modern "second generation" seekers have filters, improved
technology and computer logic, making them more difficult to "fool" with
jammers or flares.
 Visually guided weapons require that the controller guide the missile to the
target in sight. Early designs (such as the Tigercat and Seacat) required the
controller to actually fly the missile like a plane, later designs (such as the
Rapier) requier the the controller just keep the target in his crosshairs - the
missile automatically guides itself in whatever direction the crosshair sight
indicates, Visually guided systems cannot be jammed, have trouble tracking
wildly maneuvering targets, or even finding a target in bad visibility.

SA-7B Grail
Short-range shoulder-launched infrared-homing SAM.
  Battery configuration: Carried by infantrymen, or in any light vehicle.
  Search System: Eyesight
  Maximum Search Range: Eyesight
  Guidance System: Infrared homing (first generation)
  Maximum Firing Range: 10 kilometers
  Maximum Speed: Mach 1.5
  Maximum Altitude: 20,000'+
  Maneuverability: Good
  Notes: One of the first shoulder fired SAMs, this missile has good speed and
range but a very weak warhead. The IR seeker has been improved in the B model,
but even more upgrades appeared in the SA-14 (see below).
_______________________________________________________________________________
FIM-43A Redeye
Short-range shoulder-launched infrared-homing SAM.
  Battery configuration: Carried by infantrymen, or in any light vehicle.
  Search System: Eyesight
  Maximum Search Range: Eyesight
  Guidance System: Infrared homing (first generation)
  Maximum Firing Range: No more that 7 kilometers
  Maximum Speed: Mach 1.5
  Maximum Altitude: 10,000'+
  Maneuverability: Very good
  Notes: This was America's first shoulder-fired SAM, and was never really very
effective. Its IR seeker was very simple, the warhead small, and the range and
speed barely adequate. However, during the 1970s the US Army had nothing
better, and a few NATO allies were loyal enough to buy it.
_______________________________________________________________________________
SA-14 & SA-16
Short-range shoulder-launched infrared-homing SAM.
  Battery configuration: Carried by infantrymen, or in any light vehicle.
  Search System: Eyesight
  Maximum Search Range: Eyesight
  Guidance System: Infrared homing (second generation all-aspect)
  Maximum Firing Range: About 16 kilometers
  Maximum Speed: Mach 1.5+
  Maximum Altitude: 20,000'+
  Maneuverability: Excellent
  Notes: This is a completely upgraded version of the SA-7, with greater speed,
range, and a much improved seeker. Even further improvements and refinements
will appear with the upcoming SA-16.
_______________________________________________________________________________
FIM-92A Stinger
Short-range shoulder-launched infrared-homing SAM.
  Battery Configuration: Carried by infantrymen, or in any light vehicle.
  Search System: Eyesight
  Maximum Search Range: Eyesight
  Guidance System: Infrared homing (second generation all-aspect)
  Maximum Speed: Mach 2
  Maximum Firing Range: about 10 kilometers
  Maximum Altitude: about 20,000'
  Maneuverability: Excellent
  Notes: Entering production in 1981, this was a much-needed replacement
for the Redeye. The Stinger is much more effective missile, largely because of
its excellent and quite "intelligent" IR seeker. The CIA has been supplying
quantities of this missile to guerilla movements, who in turn have traded or
given this weapon to groups hostile to America, including the Iranian Shi'ite
militia.
_______________________________________________________________________________
SA-9B Gaskin
Short-range vehicle mounted infrared-homing SAM.
  Battery Configuration: Radar and launcher on same armored vehicle
  Search System: Eyesight
  Maximum Search Range: Eyesight
  Guidance System: Pulse radar aiming and infrared (IR) homing
  Maximum Speed: Mach 1.5
  Maximum Firing Range: 30 kilometers
  Maximum Altitude: 20,000'
  Maneuverability: Very good
  Notes: This is an upgraded version of the SA-9 missile vehicle. The original
design did very poorly in the Bekaa Valley against Israeli aircraft in 1981.
The SA-9 is designed to accompany front-line combat units and provide low-level
defense against strike aircraft and helicopters. The missile itself is fairly
small and not especially destructive.
_______________________________________________________________________________
SA-13 Gopher
Short-range vehicle mounted infrared-homing SAM.
  Battery Configuration: Radar and launcher on same armored vehicle
  Search System: Obsolescent pulse radars or eyesight
  Maximum Search Range: visual or 30-60 kilometer pulse radar
  Guidance System: Pulse radar aiming and infrared (IR) homing
  Maximum Speed: Mach 1.5
  Maximum Firing Range: 65 kilometers
  Maximum Altitude: 30,000'
  Maneuverability: Very good
  Notes: This is an improved SA-9 with a new launcher, better radar, and an
improved missile. Unlike the SA-9, it can be linked with a seperate search
radar system, including other obsolescent systems from older radar-guided SAMs.
A number of third world nations have received this with the SA-9B missiles on
the new tracked launcher.
_______________________________________________________________________________
Tigercat
Short-range fixed site visual SAM.
  Battery Configuration: Emplacements with controller position, trailer
laucher(s).
  Search System: Visual or obsolescent pulse radar
  Maximum Search Range: Eyesight or 65 kilometer pulse radar
  Guidance System: Joystick (visual) command guidance
  Maximum Speed: Mach 1.5
  Maximum Firing Range: 30 kilometers
  Maximum Altitude: 12,000'
  Maneuverability: Good
  Notes: This inexpensive land version of the Seacat missile is only useful
for protecting installations from direct air raids. It is very short ranged,
cannot reach high altitudes, and has a primitive "operator must fly the
missile" control system. Missiles are heavy, and mounted on trailers that must
be deployed well to the rear of any battlefield frontline. It's hard to take
this missile seriously.
_______________________________________________________________________________
SA-N-5
Short-range point defense naval SAM.
  Battery Configuration: Integral to warship
  Search System: Naval pulse radar of varying quality
  Maximum Search Range: Varies with ship, 50-150 kilometers
  Guidance System: Infrared (IR) homing
  Maximum Speed: Mach 1.5
  Maximum Firing Range: 30 kilometers
  Maximum Altitude: 20,000'
  Maneuverability: Very good
  Notes: This is the naval version of the SA-7 Grail. Older frigates and
missile boats (including the very common Osa class) use this system. The
missiles are aimed visually, their IR locked on, and then fired. Larger
launcher systems have four launching tubes and an operator position. The system
is effective only against aircraft that fly close to the boat or ship.
_______________________________________________________________________________
Seacat
Short-range point defense naval SAM.
  Battery Configuration: Integral to warship
  Search System: Obsolescent pulse radar (on Vosper Mk 5 Frigates)
  Maximum Search Range: 200 kilometers (on Vosper Mk 5 Frigates)
  Guidance System: Joystick (visual) command guidance
  Maximum Speed: Mach 1.5
  Maximum Firing Range: 30 kilometers
  Maximum Altitude: 12,000'
  Maneuverability: Good
  Notes: The Seacat missile is the naval version of the Tigercat, with the
same primitive control system and short range. It is the anti-aircraft defense
of Mark 5 frigates, built by Vosper in England for export. Iran bought a number
of these ships. The Vosper's search radar is the obsolescent AWS-1, whose
maximum range is 200 kilometers. Its effective range against a stealth aircraft
would be much, much less.


Warplanes----------------------------------------------------------------------
Key to Aircraft

Roles
 A fighter plane specializes in air-to-air combat, where the objective is
destroying enemy aircraft.
 An interceptor is a fighter designed to fly long distances and attack distant
enemy aircraft. Many interceptors are poor dogfighters.
 A strike plane is designed to hit surface targets in enemy territory. Close
support strikes are against enemy front-line troops, interdiction strikes are
against military rear areas (headquarters, supply dumps, columns on roads,
etc.), while deep strikes attack enemy installations far behind the front
line (railroad yards, bridges, airbases, etc.). Strike aircraft designed to
function against warships are sometimes termed attack aircraft.
 Bombers are designed for interdiction, deep strike, and/or naval attack, as
well as carrying nuclear weapons and/or reconnaissance gear.
 Transports carry personnel and equipment. They are not designed to fight, and
almost never carry and armament.
 AEW&C (Airborne Early Warning & Control) planes carry powerful search radar
and communications gear, designed to watch friendly and hostile aircraft while
simultaneously controlling friendly air operations.
_______________________________________________________________________________
Crew
 If a plane has a crew of one man, cockpit aids are important: the workload for
one man in a jet warplane is quite high.
_______________________________________________________________________________
Mission Weight
 This is the typical total weight of the plane, with fuel and weapons, at
takeoff. If the plane can serve in both fighter and strike role, the fighter
(air-to-air) weight is given. In a strike role a plane often carries 15-35%
additional weight.
_______________________________________________________________________________
Engines
 The total thrust of the engines (on afterburners if available) is important.
Airplanes with greater thrust than weight can fly "ballistically", a useful
advantage in air combat. A high thrust/weight ratio is desired by all fighter
pilots.
_______________________________________________________________________________
Range
 This is the combat radius of the plane when loaded for action, but using only
internal tanks (no extra fuel tanks). Often the figure is an approximation.
_______________________________________________________________________________
Ceiling
 Maximum altitude of the plane, using afterburners if available.
_______________________________________________________________________________
Maximum Speed at 0'
 Sea-level maximum speed is often much less than high altitude maximum speed,
especially in high-speed jets.
_______________________________________________________________________________
Maximum Speed at 36,000'
 This altitude level is an important benchmark because above it Mach 1 is a
constant 573 knots. Although this speed is important, note that the optimum
turning speed for most aircraft is Mach 0.75 to 0.90 (i.e., 550-650 knots,
depending on the plane and altitude); higher speeds are only good for chasing
opponents, escaping from them, or quick dashes into and out of enemy airspace.
_______________________________________________________________________________
Armament
 Often weapons pylons can be fitted to carry multiple bombs or lightweight
missiles. The number of pylons need not limit the number of ordnance items.
_______________________________________________________________________________
Air-to-Air Radar Quality
 As a stealth pilot, you are naturally interested in the range and quality of
enemy airborne search radar.
_______________________________________________________________________________
Maneuverability
 This is a comparative rating of how well the plane can maneuver in a dogfight.
All aircraft are rated on the same standard: the superb maneuverability of the
F-16 Falcon.

American-Built Warplanes

F-4E Phantom II
  Designer/Manafacturer: McDonnell Douglas, USA
  Role: Fighter & strike fighter
  Crew: Two
  Mission Weight at Takeoff: 27 tons
  Engine(s): Two General Electric J79-17 turbojets for 35,800 lbs thrust.
  Range: 830 kilometers
  Ceiling: 58,750'
  Maximum Speed at 0': 800 kts
  Maximum Speed at 36,000': 1260 kts
  Armament: 6-barrel 20mm cannon, 4 missile recesses, 5 weapon pylons
  Air-to-Air Radar Quality: Fair quality and range pulse radar
  Maneuverability: Fair to good
  Notes: This all-purpose plane served the US Navy and Air Force as both a
fighter and strike fighter throughout the 1960s and early 1970s. In the USAF it
is now obsolescent, serving mainly for reconnaissance and electronic warfare
("Wild Weasel"). However, hundreds were sold to western nations worldwide,
including Iran under the Shah. For air-to-air combat the plane can carry four
AIM-9 Sidewinders and four AIM-7 Sparrows.
_______________________________________________________________________________
F-5E Tiger II
  Designer/Manafacturer: Northrop, USA
  Role: Fighter & strike fighter
  Crew: One
  Mission Weight at Takeoff: 12 tons
  Engine(s): Two General Electric J85-GE-21B turbojets for 10,000 lbs thrust
  Range: 220 kilometers
  Ceiling: 51,000'
  Maximum Speed at 0': Not available, probably 500-600 kts
  Maximum Speed at 36,000': 950 kts
  Armament: Two 20mm cannon, 5 weapon pylons
  Air-to-Air Radar Quality: Poor quality and range pulse radar
  Maneuverability: Fair
  Notes: This inexpensive and unsophisticated fighter was never adopted by US
combat arms, but has been widely sold abroad, including 138 to Iran.
Underpowered, with poor avionics, it is useful only against obsolete opponents.
It can carry AIM-9 Sidewinders, but not AIM-7 Sparrows.
(Microprose get it wrong again... The American Aggressor squadron used F-5s...
even dummies know that... TopGun anyone? And radar? It actually has one?!)
_______________________________________________________________________________
F-14D Tomcat
  Designer/Manafacturer: Grumman, USA
  Role: Fighter & interceptor
  Crew: Two
  Mission Weight at Takeoff: 35 tons
  Engine(s): originally two Pratt & Whitney TF30-412A turbofans for 41,800 lbs
thrust, upgraded in D model to two General Electric F110-400 turbofans for 54-
58,000 lbs thrust
  Range: 1280 kilometers
  Ceiling: over 56,000'
  Maximum Speed at 0': 800 kts with TF30, higher with F110
  Maximum Speed at 36,000': 1350 kts with TF30, higher with F110
  Armament: 6-barrel 20mm cannon, 4 weapons pallets, 2 weapons pylons
  Air-to-Air Radar Quality: Excellent range, high quality doppler radar
  Maneuverability: Good
  Notes: This heavy, long-range interceptor has extremely powerful avionics for
use with the AIM-54 Phoenix semi-active radar-homing missile, which has a 200
km effective range. The aircraft is the US Navy's long-range defender of
carrier battle groups. Standard USN armament is four Phoenix and four
Sidewinder missiles (two per pylon). The swinging wings are computer controlled
for maximum performance, but their swing also shows the plane's energy state to
the enemy. In 1987 the Navy began a program that upgraded the original TF30
engines with the newer, more powerful F110s. About 80 TF30-engined F-14s were
supplied to Iran, but engine troubles, complexities in the avionics system,
and the delicacy of the Phoenix missiles have greatly reduced their military
value. They are often used as radar-warning patrol aircraft.

F-15C Eagle
  Designer/Manafacturer: McDonnell Douglas, USA
  Role: Fighter
  Crew: One
  Mission Weight at Takeoff: 22 tons
  Engine(s): Two Pratt & Whitney F100-100 turbofans for 47,660 lbs thrust
  Range: 1200 kilometers
  Ceiling: 63,000'
  Maximum Speed at 0': 810 kts
  Maximum Speed at 36,000': 1260 kts or greater
  Armament: 6-barrel 20mm cannon, 4 missile ejectors, 4 weapons pylons, 2
FAST pallet points (extra fuel, not the federation!)
  Air-to-Air Radar Quality: Medium range, high quality doppler radar
  Maneuverability: Very good
  Notes: This large, powerful dogfighter is the dream plane of many USAF
pilots. Although not as nimble as the lightweight F-16, it has longer ranged
avionics, plus a brute size and power unmatched by any fighter until the new
Su-27 appeared.

F-16C Falcon
  Designer/Manafacturer: General Dynamics, USA
  Role: Fighter & strike fighter
  Crew: One
  Mission Weight at Takeoff: 540 kilometers
  Engine(s): One Pratt & Whitney F100-200 turbofan for 23,830 lbs thrust
  Range: 12.5 tons
  Ceiling: over 50,000'
  Maximum Speed at 0': 800 kts
  Maximum Speed at 36,000': 1190 kts
  Armament: 6-barrel 20mm cannon, 7 weapon pylons
  Air-to-Air Radar Quality: Medium range, high quality doppler radar
  Maneuverability: Excellent
  Notes: The latest production fighter added to the US Air Force, the F-16 is
the most maneuverable dogfighter in the world (possibly excepting the MiG-29).
The inherently unstable airframe that gives this agility would be unflyable
except for the computerized electronic controls, hence its nickname "Electric
Jet". Advanced air-ground avionics and anti-missile defenses are "extras",
making the basic aircraft relatively cheap. Many western nations have purchased
F-16s. However, until the AIM-120 AMRAAM it had no long-range AAM.

F/A-18A Hornet
  Designer/Manafacturer: McDonnell Douglas/Northrop, USA
  Role: Fighter & strike fighter
  Crew: One
  Mission Weight at Takeoff: 18 tons
  Engine(s): Two General Electric F404-400 turbofans for 32,000 lbs thrust
  Range: 740 kilometers
  Ceiling: 50,000'
  Maximum Speed at 0': less than 660 kts
  Maximum Speed at 36,000': 1050 kts
  Armament: 6-barrel 20mm cannon, 9 weapons pylons
  Air-to-Air Radar Quality: Medium range, high quality doppler radar
  Maneuverability: Good to very good (see note below)
  Notes: Although not as maneuverable as the F-16 (see note below), this
heavier multi-role fighter has numerous avionic and defensive aids built in.
These were required by the US Navy, its main user, who needed an all-purpose
fighter and attack bomber able to fire a variety of sophisticated weapons. Like
the F-16, it also is sold to western nations.
(Alien here... dunno what Microprose are on about with this 'not as good as the
F-16' business! The F-18 is actually reputed to be far superior to the F-16,
and in numerous mock dogfights the F-18 consistently came out the winner.
Combine that with it's far superior range of ordnance, and I think the F-16 is
just cheap junk compared to this baby...)

A-6E Intruder
  Designer/Manafacturer: Grumman, USA
  Role: Attack & interdiction bomber
  Crew: Two
  Mission Weight at Takeoff: 13 tons
  Engine(s): Two Pratt & Whitney J52-8A turbojets for 18,600 lbs thrust
  Range: 870 kilometers
  Ceiling: 44,600'
  Maximum Speed at 0': 570 kts
  Maximum Speed at 36,000': 540 kts
  Armament: 5 weapons pylons
  Air-to-Air Radar Quality: Poor, but superb air-to-ground weapons radars
  Maneuverability: Fair to poor
  Notes: Designed at the end of the 1950s as a low-level attack bomber for use
in bad weather or at night, this plane remains an unqualified success. Avionics
and weapons have been rebuilt more than once to maintain the "state of the
art", with upgrades under development. Electronic warfare (EA-6 and EA-6B) and
aerial tanker (KA-6D) versions exist.

AV-8B Harrier II
  Designer/Manafacturer: British Aerospace, UK (original design) and McDonnell
Douglas, USA (American version)
  Role: S/VTOL Fighter & strike fighter
  Crew: One
  Mission Weight at Takeoff: 15 tons STOVL, 10 tons VTOL
  Engine(s): One Rolls Royce Pegasus 11-21E for 22,000 lbs vectored thrust
(no afterburner)
  Range: 240 kilometers
  Ceiling: 55,000'
  Maximum Speed at 0': 585 kts
  Maximum Speed at 36,000': 520 kts
  Armament: one 25mm cannon, 7 weapon pylons
  Air-to-Air Radar Quality: Poor, target acquisition is usually visual
  Maneuverability: Very good
  Notes: Originally designed as a strike fighter, the British-American co-
redesign greatly enhanced maneuverability. The avionics are designed for ground
attack rather than air-to-air combat. Despite this, Harriers were successful
as interceptors and combat air patrol in the 1982 Falklands War. The Harrier is
the primary fighter of the US Marines, the British Royal Navy, and frontline
squadrons of the British Royal Air Force (RAF) in Germany. Usually it uses
short segments of roadway or a "ski-jump" deck for rolling takeoffs, and later
lands vertically, like a helicopter.
(Oh dear... Royal Navy harriers are primarily fighters, which would explain
their success at doing that job in the Falklands, would it not? And the latest
Harriers have great radars, AMRAAMs, all sorts of nice kit. The RAF uses them
for ground attack, as does the USMC. And one cannon? I think not. Two slung
under the belly is a bit more like it!)

A-10A Thunderbolt II
  Designer/Manafacturer: Fairchild Republic, USA
  Role: Close support aircraft
  Crew: One
  Mission Weight at Takeoff: 20 tons
  Engine(s): Two General Electric TF34-100 turbofans for 18,130 lbs thrust
  Range: 960 kilometers
  Ceiling: under 40,000'
  Maximum Speed at 0': 370 kts
  Maximum Speed at 36,000': Unknown, probably less than 370 kts
  Armament: 7-barrel 30mm cannon, 11 weapon pylons
  Air-to-Air Radar Quality: Poor, air-to-ground avionics quite basic
  Maneuverability: Very good
  Notes: This slow, heavily-armored plane was designed purely for frontline
ground attack with "tank busting" its speciality. This role (unglamorous to the
USAF), along with its peculiar appearance, earns it the unofficial nickname
"Warthog". Although intended for combat in Europe where low clouds and bad
weather are frequent, the A-10 is a fair-weather day-only plane. The
manafacturer hopes to interest the USAF in a night-flying variant, currently
without success. Unless protected by good fighters (F-15s and F-16s), this
plane is doomed if sent into airspace contested by USSR fighters.
(The USAF is now gradually getting rid of the A-10... numerous accidents may
have had something to do with this.)

EF-111A Raven
  Designer/Manafacturer: General Dynamics, USA
  Role: Electronic warfare escort
  Crew: Two
  Mission Weight at Takeoff: 43.5 tons
  Engine(s): Two Pratt & Whitney TF30-3 turbofans for 37,000 lbs thrust (with
afterburners)
  Range: 1,900 kilometers
  Ceiling: 54,700'
  Maximum Speed at 0': 700 kts
  Maximum Speed at 36,000': 1020 kts
  Armament: ALQ-99E electronic warfare system, no other weapons
  Air-to-Air Radar Quality: Medium-long range, high quality pulse & doppler
  Maneuverability: Fair
  Notes: This is a specially built electronic warfare version of the F-111
strike and interdiction bomber. The original concept of the F-111 was a high-
speed bomber for deep strikes at high and/or low altitude, especially at night
or in bad weather. The EF-111 is popularly known as the "Electric Fox", or
"Spark Vark" (the unofficial nickname of the F-111 is "Aardvark" or "Vark"). It
is designed to accompany deep strike and interdiction missions, providing
electronic screening and jamming. It is the fastest, most powerful such craft
in the world.

B-1B Bomber
  Designer/Manafacturer: Rockwell International, USA
  Role: Strategic bomber
  Crew: Four
  Mission Weight at Takeoff: 225 tons with internal load only
  Engine(s): Four General Electric F101-102 turbofans for 120,000 lbs thrust
  Range: 5,900 kilometers
  Ceiling: Unknown, probably under 50,000'
  Maximum Speed at 0': 530 kts
  Maximum Speed at 36,000': 725 kts
  Armament: 37.5 ton capacity bomb bay, 29.5 tons additional on external mounts
if desired
  Air-to-Air Radar Quality: Medium range, high quality doppler radar
  Maneuverability: Poor
  Notes: This redesign of the B-1A (cancelled in the late 1960s) emphasizes
low-level attack and minimal radar signature. The aircraft is now seriously
overloaded by the numerous revisions and often unreliable electronic defensive
gear. Despite the usual carping from the US press, in combat against first-line
Russian aircraft this bomber has some hope of survival. The obsolescent B-52s
it replaces would have no chance whatsoever.

E-3C Sentry "AWACS"
  Designer/Manafacturer: Boeing, USA
  Role: Airborne Early Warning & Control
  Crew: 15 to 17
  Mission Weight at Takeoff: 162.5 tons
  Engine(s): Four Pratt & Whitney TF33-100/100A turbofans for 84,000 lbs
thrust
  Range: 3,000 kilometers (11 hours unrefueled endurance)
  Ceiling: over 29,000'
  Cruise Speed at altitude: over 350 kts
  Maximum Speed at altitude: 460 kts
  Armament: Surveillance radar, communications, air traffic control, and
electronic defenses; weapons pylons may be added
  Air-to-Air Radar Quality: Excellent range and quality radars
  Maneuverability: Poor
  Notes: This 707 airliner frame holds the most sophisticated and effective
airborne radar in the world. No other nation has a plane of equivalent
effectiveness (the British Nimrod and Russian Moss are failures, the new
Russian Mainstay is stil unproven). Flying "racetrack" circles behind friendly
lines at 25-30,000', this AWACS can watch and direct aircraft out to 300 miles
range. Until the "C" model upgrade, too many aircraft and limited computer
power caused temporary "blind spots". In wartime weapons pylons carrying AIM-9
Sidewinders or AIM-120 AMRAAMS could be added. In addition each Sentry carries
various electronic defenses and always has a fighter escort.

Russian-built Warplanes

MiG-21 Fishbed
  Designer/Manafacturer: Mikoyan-Gurevich, USSR
  Role: Fighter
  Crew: one
  Mission Weight at Takeoff: 9 tons
  Engine(s): One Tumansky R-11F2S-300 turbofan for 14,500 lbs thrust
  Range: 630 kilometers
  Ceiling: 59,000' (often only 50,000')
  Maximum Speed at 0': 700 kts
  Maximum Speed at 36,000': 1220 kts
  Armament: Two 23mm cannon, 4 weapons pylons, 1 fuel tank pylon
  Air-to-Air Radar Quality: Very short range, low quality pulse radar
  Maneuverability: Good
  Notes: This agile, maneuverable, easy-flying fighter waas the premier
dogfighting plane of the 1960s and early 1970s. It has simple avionics and a
standard armament of 2 or 4 AA-2s (now often replaced by AA-8s), making it
inexpensive to buy, arm and maintain. However, it has little or no HUD, weak
radars, and low quality defenses, making it obsolete as a fighter.
Unfortunately, its limited carrying capacity makes it poor as a strike fighter.

MiG-23 Flogger
  Designer/Manafacturer: Mikoyan-Gurevich, USSR
  Role: Fighter
  Crew: One
  Mission Weight at Takeoff: 16 tons
  Engine(s): One Tumansky R-29B turbofan for 27,500 lbs thrust
  Range: 900 kilometers
  Ceiling: 61,000'
  Maximum Speed at 0': 740 kts
  Maximum Speed at 36,000': 1190 kts
  Armament: Two 23mm cannon, 4 weapon pylons, 1 fuel tank pylon
  Air-to-Air Radar Quality: Very poor, short range pulse radar
  Maneuverability: Fair
  Notes: This swing-wing fighter replacement for the MiG-21 originally had few
avionics and a 22,485 lb. R-27 engine. This variant, incapable of firing
sophisticated weapons and with serious performance flaws, is often sold abroad.
The more advanced models, listed above, are mediocre performers. All commonly
carry AA-2 and/or AA-8 missiles, most USSR and East European versions use the
AA-7 radar homing missile also. With its MiG-27 brother, this plane has huge
production runs, making it the cheapest fighter available today. This alone
makes it one of the world's most popular aircraft.

MiG-27 Flogger
[Physical appearance equivalent to MiG-23, but slimmer 'duck-nose']
  Designer/Manafacturer: Mikoyan-Gurevich, USSR
  Role: Strike Fighter
  Crew: One
  Mission Weight at Takeoff: 22 tons
  Engine(s): One Tumansky R-29 turbofan for 25,353 lbs thrust
  Range: 400 kilometers
  Ceiling: 52,000'
  Maximum Speed at 0': 635 kts
  Maximum Speed at 36,000': 925 kts
  Armament: One 6-barrel 23mm cannon, 5 weapon pylons, 2 bomb racks
  Air-to-Air Radar Quality: Very poor, very short range pulse radar
  Maneuverability: Fair
  Notes: This is the ground-attack variant of the MiG-23. In Russian frontline
units it includes a laser designator for laser-guided munitions and simple
terrain-avoidance radars for low-level attacks. Improved jammers and decoys are
added as well. However, many sophisticated attack aids common on western strike
fighters are not present. Presumably the MiG-27s compensate for this with
quantity, as huge production runs greatly lower its cost.

MiG-25 Foxbat
  Designer/Manafacturer: Mikoyan-Gurevich, USSR
  Role: PVO Interceptor
  Crew: One
  Mission Weight at Takeoff: 40 tons
  Engine(s): Two Tumansky R-31 turbofans for 48,500 lbs thrust
  Range: 1,100 kilometers
  Ceiling: 80,000'
  Maximum Speed at 0': 570 kts
  Maximum Speed at 36,000': 1860 kts
  Armament: 4 weapons pylons
  Air-to-Air Radar Quality: Medium quality, medium range pulse radar
  Maneuverability: Poor
  Notes: This plane was originally designed to defend the distant borders of
the USSR from air attack, working with special ground radars to attack enemy
bombers with a special long-ranged AAM (the AA-6). It is extremely fast, but
quite unmaneuverable. A few are bought by client states for status reasons, but
the reconnaissance version (MiG-25R) is more popular - it's 88,000' ceiling
makes it immune to normal SAM or fighter interception.
_______________________________________________________________________________
MiG-29 Fulcrum
  Designer/Manafacturer: Mikoyan-Gurevich, USSR
  Role: Fighter
  Crew: One
  Mission Weight at Takeoff: 18 tons
  Engine(s): Two Tumansky R-33D turbofans for 36,600 lbs thrust
  Range: 650 kilometers
  Ceiling: Probably 55-65,000'
  Maximum Speed at 0': 700 kts
  Maximum Speed at 36,000': 1260 kts
  Armament: One multi-barrel cannon, 6 weapons pylons
  Air-to-Air Radar Quality: Medium quality and range doppler radar
  Maneuverability: Very good to excellent
  Notes: Originally designed to outfight the F-15, this plane is a modern,
lightweight dogfighter with superlative agility. It has engine power in excess
of its weight. Common armament is AA-10 "fire and forget" radar-homers along
with some AA-8 and/or AA-10 IR missiles. The degree of sophistication in the
avionics is unknown, but unlikely to match western models. Considerable debate
exists regarding the relative superiority of this plane versus the F-16.

MiG-31 Foxhound
  Designer/Manafacturer: Mikoyan-Gurevich, USSR
  Role: PVO Interceptor
  Crew: One
  Mission Weight at Takeoff: 45 tons
  Engine(s): Two turbofans or turbojets, estimated thrust 50-60,000 lbs
  Range: 1,500 kilometers
  Ceiling: 75,500'
  Maximum Speed at 0': 790 kts
  Maximum Speed at 36,000': 1400 kts
  Armament: Cannon possible, 4 missile recesses, 4 weapons pylons
  Air-to-Air Radar Quality: Superior quality and range doppler radar
  Maneuverability: Fair
  Notes: This aircraft is a redesigned MiG-25. Although slightly slower, it is
improved in all other categories, especially low-altitude interceptions against
planes and cruise missiles. The new AA-9 long-range missile is designed for
look-down attacks on low-level cruise missiles. It also has AA-8s and AA-10s.

Su-24 Fencer
  Designer/Manafacturer: Sukhoi, USSR
  Role: Strike Fighter & Interdictor
  Crew: Two
  Mission Weight at Takeoff: 43.5 tons
  Engine(s): Two Tumansky R-29B turbofans for 50,700 lbs thrust
  Range: 300 to 1,800 kilometers (varies with mission profile and load)
  Ceiling: 57,400'
  Maximum Speed at 0': 765 kts
  Maximum Speed at 36,000': 1400 kts
  Armament: 6-barrel 23mm cannon, 8 weapon pylons
  Air-to-Air Radar Quality: nil, avionics designed purely for air-ground role
  Maneuverability: Fair
  Notes: This is the most advanced air-ground attack plane built by the USSR.
Externally it appears similar to the F-111, including the side-by-side seating
in the cockpit. However, its armament and avionics are designed for front-line
and rear-area strikes, into the teeth of enemy air defenses. Western air and
ground commanders fear the Su-24 more than any other Soviet aircraft. The
aircraft may carry a few AA-8s for self-defense, but it is not designed for
air-to-air combat.
_______________________________________________________________________________
Su-27 Flanker
  Designer/Manafacturer: Sukhoi, USSR
  Role: Fighter
  Crew: One
  Mission Weight at Takeoff: 25 tons
  Engine(s): Two unknown turbojets for estimated 60,000 lbs thrust
  Range: 1,150 kilometers
  Ceiling: probably 60,000' or more
  Maximum Speed at 0': 725 kts
  Maximum Speed at 36,000': 1350 kts
  Armament: Probably a cannon, 6 weapons pylons
  Air-to-Air Radar Quality: Above average quality and range doppler radar
  Maneuverability: Very good to excellent
  Notes: This aircraft was designed to defeat the F-14 and F-15 fighters. It is
a large, powerful dogfighter whose usual armament is probably four AA-8 and
four AA-10 missiles. In comparison to the MiG-29, the Su-27 is a larger,
heavier plane. If its avionics and flight controls are truly modern, the Su-27
may be the superior plane. However, in dogfighting maneuverability the MiG-29
and F-16 probably have the edge.
_______________________________________________________________________________
Yak-38 Forger
  Designer/Manafacturer: Yakovlev, USSR
  Role: VTOL Fighter
  Crew: One
  Mission Weight at Takeoff: 12 tons
  Engine(s): One Lyulka AL-21 vectored-thrust turbojet for 17,985 lbs thrust
(no afterburner), plus two Koliesov lift engines
  Range: 370 kilometers
  Ceiling: 39,370'
  Maximum Speed at 0': 535 kts
  Maximum Speed at 36,000': 550 kts
  Armament: 4 weapons pylons
  Air-to-Air Radar Quality: Poor quality and range pulse radar
  Maneuverability: Fair
  Notes: Originally known as the Yak-36MP, this vertical take-off fighter
operates from the Kiev-class aircraft carriers. These lack the equipment and
deck space for conventional jets. Initially thought to be a Russian equivalent
of the Harrier, the Yak-38 is considerably inferior. It has a limited
interception ability and very limited strike capacity. However, until this
plane the Russian navy had nothing bigger than helicopters for its warships at
sea.
_______________________________________________________________________________
Tu-26 Backfire
  Designer/Manafacturer: Tupolev, USSR
  Role: Bomber
  Crew: Four
  Mission Weight at Takeoff: 61 tons
  Engine(s): Two uprated Kuznetsov NK-144 turbofans for 88,180 lbs thrust
  Range: 5,500 kilometers
  Ceiling: 55,000'
  Maximum Speed at 0': 525 kts
  Maximum Speed at 36,000': 970 kts
  Armament: Three heavy Air-Surface missiles or 13 tons of bombs
  Air-to-Air Radar Quality: Fair, with excellent air-to-surface avionics
  Maneuverability: Very poor
  Notes: Many of these swing-wing bombers are in service with the Soviet naval
air arm, carrying long-range missiles to attack hostile warships up to 3,000
kilometers out to sea. The Backfire's exceptionally long range and high speed,
plus its powerful missiles make it a mortal threat to USN aircraft carriers.
With aerial refueling it has sufficient range to get within curise-missile-
launch position of the USA. As a gesture to arms control, the USSR has removed
air refueling equipment from its Air Force Backfires.
_______________________________________________________________________________
Tu-95D Bear
  Designer/Manafacturer: Tupolev, USSR
  Role: Reconnaissance bomber
  Crew: 7-12
  Mission Weight at Takeoff: unknown, about 145-165 tons
  Engine(s): four Kuznetsov NK-12MV turboprops
  Range: 8,250 kilometers (7 hours endurance)
  Ceiling: 41,000'
  Maximum Speed at 0': 410 kts
  Maximum Speed at 36,000': 475 kts
  Armament: Unarmed
  Air-to-Air Radar Quality: Very good long-range pulse radars
  Maneuverability: Terrible
  Notes: The Tu-95 has been the world's most sophisticated turboprop bomber
for over thirty years (it entered service in 1955). It is primarily used for
long-range reconnaissance, electronic intelligence, electronic warfare
(jamming), anti-ship missiles, and cruise-missiles. The "D" model is a
reconnaissance version, the "H" model (on a slightly modified airframe) a
cruise-missile carrier.
(Believe it or not, this plane's design ancestry can be traced back to the WW2
American Flying Fortress...)
_______________________________________________________________________________
Il-76 Mainstay
  Designer/Manafacturer: Ilyushin, USSR
  Role: Airborne Early Warning & Control (AEW&C)
  Crew: Estimated at 15 to 20
  Mission Weight at Takeoff: About 150 tons
  Engine(s): four Soloview D-30KP turbofans for 106,000 lbs thrust
  Range: About 6,400 kilometers (7 hours endurance)
  Ceiling: About 40-50,000'
  Maximum Speed at 0': 400 kts
  Maximum Speed at 36,000': 460 kts
  Armament: Possibly twin 23mm tail cannon, 2-4 weapons pylons
  Air-to-Air Radar Quality: Excellent long-range doppler radars
  Maneuverability: Terrible
  Notes: The "Mainstay" is a conversion of the huge Il-76 Candid transport
plane to "AWACS" duties. Its purpose is to detect enemy aircraft and low-flying
missiles, and act as a mobile, airborne command post that controls friendly
aircraft engaging such threats. The earlier Tu-126 "Moss" AEW&C with turboprops
was a disastrous failure. Like many AEW&C planes, the Il-76 could carry a few
AAMs (AA-8s or AA-10s) for self defense, as well as extensive jammers, decoys,
etc.

An-72 Coaler
  Designer/Manafacturer: Antonov, USSR
  Role: Air transport
  Crew: 3
  Mission Weight at Takeoff: 28 tons
  Engine(s): Two Lotarev D-36 turbofans for 28,660 lbs thrust
  Range: 1000 kilometers (max cargo) to 3,800 kilometers (no cargo)
  Ceiling: 36,100'
  Maximum Speed at 0': 350 kts
  Maximum Speed at 36,000': 410 kts
  Armament: unarmed; can carry 32 passengers or 11 tons cargo
  Air-to-Air Radar Quality: Navigational only
  Maneuverability: Terrible for a fighter, but good for a transport
  Notes: This is the latest general-purpose medium air transport of the Soviet
Union. Its jet engines and short-takeoff performance make in an outstanding
utility craft for transporting all types of personnel and cargo between remote
airfields.

Glossary
  AAM: Air-to-air missile.
  Ace: Pilot with five or more confirmed kills of enemy aircraft.
  Ace-of-the-Base: Best flyer in the squadron.
  AFV: Armored Fighting Vehicle, and armored vehicle designed for front line
combat. This includes tanks, armored personnel carriers, anti-aircraft tanks,

  Bravo Sierra: Military words for BS, which in turn is an abbreviation for a
common expletive, here indicating something especially unpleasant or
unbelievable. For example: "Doing the bunny hop down the runway to a bellyflop
landing, then complaining about wind sheer, is true Bravo Sierra!"
  BVR: Beyond Visual Range. Any engagement where you cannot visually
distinguish the target. During peacetime pilots are often prohibited from
firing BVR, for fear of hitting the wrong target.
  CAP: Combat Air Patrol. Aircraft patrolling over friendly forces. Originally
it meant fighters launched from aircraft carriers, and assigned to patrol over
those carriers, protecting them from air attack.
  Check your Six: Watch your tail; literally, watch the six o'clock position of
your aircraft.
  Colors: Silk neck scarf worn by fighter pilots.
  Ditch: Bail out, esp. over water.
  Driver: Pilot.
  ECM: Electronic Counter-measures. Devices designed to jam or fool ("spoof")
enemy electronic sensors, notably radar.
  ECCM: Electronic Counter-counter-measures. Devices designed to protect
against jamming or "spoofing" by enemy ECM.
  Electric Jet: F-16 Falcon.

the outside while getting detailed information. Some HUDs have become so
complex they defeat their designed purpose (and are equipped with a
"de-clutter" switch!).
  Knife Fight: Dogfight to the death - what happens when you go "fangs out".
This situation is advantageous to low-speed, highly manueverable planes and
disadvantageous to higher speed but less maneuverable planes. However, either

hypothetical glide path.
  INS: Inertial Navigation System. A device that keeps track of an airplane's
position (using a gyroscope) and displays that position and a desired
destination. There are many different types of INS systems; those which use
cockpit CRT maps and HUD pointers are the most sophisticated.
  IR: Infrared. A portion of the electro-magnetic spectrum where the intensity
of the signal is directly related to the heat of the object.
  Mike Mike: Military words for "mm", generally referring to 20mm cannon
shells. Ex: "Then I placed some Mike Mike right up his tail".
  MiG: Mikoyan-Gurevich design bureau, which specializes in the design and
construction of jet fighters for the Soviet Union. Often used as a generic name
for all Soviet-built fighter aircraft (even though other bureaus contribute
fighter designs).
  Niner: Reference to the AIM-9 Sidewinder missile. The 9L version is known as
the "Niner Lima", the 9M version used by the F-19 is a "Niner Mike".
  Obsolescent: Outdated but not yet useless; not quite obsolete.
  Promo: Promotion.
  Pucker Factor: Level of fear (e.g., "When those 20 Flankers jumped us, the
pucker factor sure went up!").
  Punch His Ticket: To shoot down an enemy fighter plane.
  Punch Out: Specifically to bail out using an ejection seat, but generally
applied to a departure ("Let's punch out of here!").
  SAM: Surface-to-Air Missile.
  Sierra Hotel: Military expansion of the letters "SH", here an abbreviation
for heated excrement. Curiously, the expression denotes admiration and
excitement. For example, "Sierra Hotel, look at that guy smoke MiGs!".
  Skunk Works: Quasi-official nickname of the Lockheed plant in Burbank,
California that designs and builds top-secret aircraft.
  Smoke: To destroy, as in "Smoked that MiG!". Originally from the smoke plume
emitted by burning aircraft as they fall to earth.
  Star: As in, "getting your star". Refers to the much coveted promotion from
Colonel to General, where your rank insignia is now a single gold star.
  VVI: Vertical Velocity Indicator. A gauge that indicates how fast a plane is
ascending or descending.
  Whiskey Delta: Military expansion of the letters WD, which in turn refers to
weakness in a certain male organ rarely discussed in polite company. The term
is an especially derogatory and insulting description of a fighter pilot (e.g.,
"that Whiskey Delta couldn't even find his own airbase, much less hit it with a
bomb.").
  Wing Weenie: Administrative staff officer attached to a fighter unit, but
with no combat or flying duties. A mildly derogatory term.
  Zero-Zero: Nickname for the zero-zero type ejection seat. So named because,
in theory, a pilot can eject safely from a plane with zero speed and zero
altitude (i.e., sitting on a runway).





THE END------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Actually, there were a couple more pages of self-congratulatory rubbish from
Microprose, but if you want to read them you better buy the original...





Hints, tips and bug reports from The Alien!------------------------------------

I'll start with SAMs... in this game, the most commonly encountered SAMs are
the SA-14, SA-10 and HAWK. The SA-14 is an IR SAM, and all you have to do is
stick the IR jammer on! In fact, sometimes you don't even need to do that, as
it often runs out of fuel before it gets anywhere near you! The HAWK is also
a bit of a loser- just put the ECM jammer on and it will fly blindly past.
The SA-10, however, is a bit more dangerous. The best strategy is to dump a
decoy, fly at right angles to the missile (use tactical map) and dump chaff
if it gets close. And pray...

Next, what weapons to choose... if you know that you are going to encounter
a lot of enemy aircraft, load up with Sidewinders. In fact, if you are on
air-to-air missions and the secondary target is a strike mission (not a recon
mission), then take nothing but Sidewinders, unless you need extra fuel. Why
take no air-to-ground weapons? Because you have a very good gun!! The gun can
take out just about anything, as long as you hit the target in the right place.
When strafing a ground target, it often helps to aim slightly below the
target- this definitely works when strafing SAM batteries anyway.

Sidewinders are preferable to AMRAAMs most of the time, because you can carry
four Sidewinders in one bay, and only three AMRAAMs. And the Sidewinders
actually seem to have the same range as an AMRAAM- over 35 kilometers! Never
mind that they should run out of fuel after 15-20 km... these are Super-
Sidewinders! Against an aircraft flying towards you, you could probably get
away with firing a Sidewinder at 40 km!

The gun also has a longer range than the manual says- I've splashed MiGs that
were 18 km away, on numerous occasions. And it is VERY powerful! For instance,
I have destroyed the following targets with the gun... USS America (whoops),
Missile Boats, Oil Rigs, SAM Radars, Tank farms... I think just about anything
can be destroyed by the gun if your aim is true.

Dogfighting is EASY... first, the enemy doesn't use guns on you. Second, they
hardly ever fire missiles when up close. And third, they have this great habit
of flying in straight lines (even Veterans!). I don't know much about Elite
enemy pilots; I've only engaged them with AMRAAMs, and never got up close. But
I do know that Elite pilots seem to have a knack of avoiding Sidewinders that
are fired at long range (i.e. above 15 km).

What planes are friendly and what ones are hostile? Well, all Boeings are
civilian airliners and the only other friendlies are the F-18s, so shoot
anything else...

Taking off is so easy I won't mention it. Landing is also surprisingly easy,
even on Realistic Landings you can come down very fast indeed and still come
out without a scratch. Carrier landings are tougher... if you don't hit the
rear quarter of the deck, then the arrestor wires won't catch you. If they
do catch you, you stop almost immediately, so you're ok! If you do miss them,
then it IS possible to stop just by using the brakes and shutting down the
engine, but it will look very scary- the nosewheel will hang over the edge of
the deck! And maybe even the main wheels too, so it'll look like you're
hovering in front of the carrier... this is because the deck is a bit longer
than it actually is on screen.

Ok, next is fuel. If you fly with the throttle around the half-way mark, you
will use fuel at a VERY low rate- so low that you can loiter for up to half
and hour (real time) in any area, waiting for bad guys to show up (so you can
shoot them down!). Two disadvantages with this throttle setting are that you
will have to put down the flaps to stay in the air, and your airspeed will
probably be as low as 200 knots- accelerated time is a good idea!

To finish off with... radars. I hate 'em! Damn things! Pulse radars aren't
too worrying, but Doppler ones are very dangerous - if there are any near your
flight path, take them out with a Maverick, or you could risk going in and
strafing the radar, but that means risking SAM launches against you. Missile
boats are also best destroyed if any are near your flight path. In mountainous
areas, radars are less of a problem; it's quite easy to zoom in and strafe
one before it even realises you exist!


Now... bugs. The major one is that sometimes the plane flips upside down for no
reason! This can cause a crash if you are using autopilot at the time, as the
dumb autopilot tries to correct by rolling over and diving into the ground!
When the plane does this little party trick, it sometimes does an instant 180
degree turn as well! Another bug I've noticed is that when your plane is
heavily damaged (8 out of the 9 damage lights were on), then selecting the
damage display (F6) locked up the game. But I only saw it do that once, because
normally I'm so brilliant at the game that I don't get damaged (ego!)... The
final bug I have had happen to me twice now; in Libya, for no apparent reason,
it crashes out, displaying the registers, exception type, etc. A little bit
annoying when I had spent half an hour sneaking around mountains avoiding
detection... oh well, at least it isn't as buggy as v1.01 (the version released
on the continent. That's Europe to you Americans!).

zed by a seeker with
advanced computer logic, and once recognized the seeker actually homes on the
jammer, instead of being confused by it.
 Therefore, it's unwise and sometimes downright dangerous to leave a jammer
running when second-generation IR missiles are getting close (not to mention
the jammer overheating and shutting off at an inconvenient time).
 Flares: Although called "flares", these are really small, finely tuned heat
decoys. A flare lures an IR missile toward it (and away from you), but only
during the 2 to 3 seconds it burns. After that the flare dies and the missile
resumes seeking. Therefore, like chaff, the standard technique is to wait until
the missile is a couple of seconds away (the klaxon sounds), then drop a flare
while you turn away.
 Maneuvering: Maneuvering techniques against IR missiles are the same as those
used against radar guided missiles. The only difference is that IR missiles
tend to be smaller and more maneuverable. Second generation missiles are often
the most maneuverable, so you're best off relying on decoy, jammer and/or
flares against them.
 Unlike radar guided SAMs, most IR SAMs are very maneuverable, with the ability
to turn toward their target almost immediately after launch. As a result,
flying low and close to a battery of maneuverable IR SAMs is very dangerous!
 Warnings & Responses: Your first warning of an IR missile attack can occur at
any time. A search or tracking radar may alert you, just like a radar-guided
SAM attack. In fact, at that point you can't tell that an IR missile attack is
coming. However, when the missile is launched, the "I" missile warning light
goes on (rather than the "R" light).
 In many cases your first warning of an attack is the "I" missile warning
light. This is because lots of cheap IR SAMs have no search radar - just
eyesight searching. Your first warning is their launch.
 If you know the missile is a first-generation homer, you can turn on the IR
jammer, change course and laugh it off. However, it pays to be wary. Against
second generation missiles the IR jammer may still work - if you can get
outside its 45 degree field of view before it gets too close, or the jammer
overheats. The reduced airspeed due to using the jammer doesn't help, either.
Otherwise, you'll have to wait for the proximity alarm klaxon.
 Many IR missiles are fired from very short ranges, so short that the "I" light
is almost immediately followed by the proximity alarm klaxon. When you hear the
klaxon and see the "I" light burning, your first act must be to drop a flare
and then dodge!

_______________________________________________________________________________
Outmaneuvering a Missile
 Whether you're using jammers, decoys, or just plain guts, the basic principles
of outmaneuvering a missile remain the same.
 Evading the Missile's View: SAMs can only "home" on targets within the
acquisition arc of their seeker. This arc is a bare 45 degrees ahea. If decoys,
jammers, or whatever temporarily confuse a missile, you evade attack by moving
outside this 45 degree arc. Usually the quickest escape course is one
perpendicular to the missile's flight path.
 Turning inside a Missile: When a missile is close, you still have a chance to
outmaneuver him. Its turning arc is larger than yours.
 If the missile is trying to fly up your tail, roll over onto a wingtip for a
tight turn, then pull back hard on the control stick to tighten the turn
further. Keep an eye on the airspeed, since you can't stay long in this kind of
a turn - soon the plane will stall. But meanwhile, the missile is making a
wider, faster turn that causes it to zoom past harmlessly.
 Turning toward a Missile: If a SAM approaches you from the side, gradually
turn toward it, increasing the tightness of your turn as it comes closer. The
objective is to keep the missile's course at right angles (perpendicular) to
your own.
 This tactic works because the missile cannot turn with you. Instead it
gradually falls behind, zooming past your tail.
 Evading Frontal Attacks: If a SAM approaches you from the front, wait until
it's about 8 to 12 kilometers away (about 2/3rds of a grid square on the
tactical display).
 Then make a quick 90 degree turn. This puts the missile facing your side. Now
roll over 180 degrees and turn toward the missile. Now you're set up for a
turning battle (see "Turning toward a Missile" above).

_______________________________________________________________________________
Special Tactics & Problems
 Missile Minimum Range: Large less-maneuverable missiles fire straight up when
first launched. This means that they can't begin homing until they're beyond a
certain distance (in range and altitude) from their launchers. As a result,
circling right over a battery of low-maneuverability SAMs can actually be very
safe.
 Doppler Missiles: Enemy missiles with doppler guidance systems are a special
danger. These missiles will not home on the chaff unless your course is
perpendicular (at right angles to) the missile. If the missile chases you from
the rear or attacks from straight ahead, chaff has no effect.
 Only three SAMs (Surface-to-Air missiles) currently have doppler guidance:
the SA-10, SA-12, and SA-N-6. Only one AAM (air-to-air missile) has doppler
guidance: the AA-10.
 The "Doppler Cross" Missile Evasion: The F-19 observes an enemy doppler-
guided SAM approaching (SA-10, SA-12 or SA-N-6), and until his course is
perpendicular (at right angles to) the missile, Then the F-19 drops chaff or a
decoy, and continues on a perpendicular course, keeping the missile at a
constant range. Flying on a different course can be disastrous, as the missile
will "see" the doppler shift as you change range.

Attack Techniques

Missiles
AIM-9M Sidewinder
AIM-120A AMRAAM

 Missile Ranges: The maximum range of a missile depends not only on its motor,
but your plane's speed at launch and the direction of enemy movement. The
initial "lock-on" range corresponds to missile maximum range if you're at
maximum speed. However, if you're moving slower the missile may not get that
extra boost needed to reach the target.
 A much more important consideration is the enemy's flight path. If the target
plane is flying toward you, even a maximum range launch is likely to reach him.
However, if the target plane is flying away the missie has a long "stern chase"
ahead of it. In such a situation you should wait until the oval turns red
before launching.
 Radar Guided Missiles: Your AIM-120 AMRAAM missile is one of the best medium-
range weapons in the world. It is the only "fire and forget" radar-guided
missile in American inventory. It has sufficient circuitry to penetrate most
defenses, and sufficient maneuverability to chase down most fighters, not to
mention nailing bombers and transports. Because the AIM-120 has greater range
than the Sidewinder (32 km compared to 17 km), pilots typically open fire with
the AIM-120, then switch to Sidewinders if any enemy aircraft survive to that
range.
 IR Guided Missiles: The short-range AIM-9M Sidewinder is probably the best
dogfighting missile in the world. It is more maneuverable than the AMRAAM,
giving it a better chance of "hanging on" to a twisting, turning target. The
most advantageous firing position for the Sidewinder is up the enemy's
tailpipes. The next best position is from above, diving down onto the top (hot
side) of the enemy plane. The third best position is directly into the enemy's
nose. Shots against the enemy as it crosses in front of you, or at its
underside (the cold side) have very little chance of hitting.
 The main weakness of the Sidewinder is its limited range.
 Technique: When firing a missile, always remember to (1) open the bay doors,
and (2) wait for the lock-on. If you don't wait for the target box to become
oval-shaped, you're firing without a lock-on, and will almost certainly miss.
Then look at your airspeed. If you're moving fast (around 500 kts) or the
target is closing, a maximum range lock-on shot will probably hit. However, if
your speed is low or the target flying away you should wait until the range
closes, ideally until the oval turns red.
 Missile accuracy doesn't take into account enemy defensive equipment or
evasive maneuvering. First line and elite fighter aircraft may prove more
difficult to hit. Although the "Mainstay" AEW&C craft maneuvers poorly, it has
superior defensive equipment. You may find that guns are necessary against
Mainstays flown by a capable crew.
 Firing Attitude: Also remember that AAMs, like other missiles, will fall 300'
to 400' before their motor is powerful enough to guide them away to the target.
Until then the missile has your speed and VVI. If you're diving at the ground,
the missile may slam into the ground before it can fly away. Firing in a tight
turn, or while inverted, can cause the missile to tumble as it leaves the
weapons bay. The wisest method is to fire only when you're level and above
500'.
 Target Discrimination: Sidewinders and AMRAAMs always home on the most
prominent target, which is usually the nearest. They will do so even if you
were tracking someone else. In Cold War and Limited War, beware of this limited
"brainpower" in your missiles. You may be tracking a primary or secondary
target, fire a missile, and then discover it goes for one of the fighter
escorts that happens to be closer!
 Notes: Your F-19 uses a tracking camera instead of weapon guidance radars.
This system "downloads" appropriate launch parameters to the AIM-120 AMRAAM.
Although the AIM-120 itself uses radar, the set switches on when the missile
is launched. As a result, missile targeting does not increase your EMV. Of
course, opening the bay doors to fire does increase your EMV. A skillful
stealth pilot only opens the bay doors just before a launch, or during a
dogfight.

_______________________________________________________________________________
Guns
 Jet aircraft travel so quickly that conventional machine guns and cannons
cannot fire fast enough to guarantee a hit: a plane could literally fly
between the shells. Therefore, modern aircraft cannon are either a group of
guns (such as the twin 23mm cannons in many Russian MiGs) or a multi-barrel
gatling gun (such as the six-barrel 20mm M61A1 on most American jets). Cannons
are used because they fire explosive shells (machine guns fire less destructive
solid lead slugs). Small 20mm to 30mm cannons are used because large weapons
cannot fire fast enough.
 Aircraft cannons have an effective range of 0.5 to 3 kilometers, a maximum
range of 6 kilometers. Inside 0.5 kilometers there is a significant danger that
a piece from a disintegrating target might hit you.
 The Historical Gunsight: Your F-19 has the most modern and advanced gunsight
available: a "historical" gunsight with automatic laser rangefinder. In normal
operation this gunsight "assumes" you are firing at maximum range (6
kilometers). However, if your tracking box is on a closer target, that shorter
range is used instead for gunsight calculations.
 The gunsight computer constantly calculates range, flight path, and ballistics
for you. It then displays where your shells would be if they were hitting the
target now. The gunsight continually calculates firing, delays the appropriate
time and display potential hits as they would occur. Therefore, the sight is
"assuming" that you fired at the correct time in the past (hence the term
"historical" gunsight).
 Anticipation Firing: It takes about two seconds for M61A1 20mm shells to
travel the maximum 6 kilometer range. Therefore, to hit a target you must judge
the speed at which the target and your sight converge. You should fire about
two seconds before they meet. If the range is less than 6 km, wait a little
less. For example, at 3 km wait until target and sight are one second apart; at
1.5 km wait until target and sight are a half second apart, etc.
 You can use this sight like an old fashioned predicting sight. That is, wait
until the sight is on the target, then shoot. But at 6 km range you'll have to
hope the target stays on the same course for two seconds to insure a hit.
Airplane targets aren't always so obliging!
 In short, the key to using a historical gunsight is anticipation. Don't wait
for the sight to reach the target. Instead, learn to anticipate the meeting of
sight and target, then shoot ahead of time.
 Performance Limitations: Although the maximum range of your M61A1 20mm Vulcan
cannon is 6 kilometers, this is not the recommended engagement range. At ranges
beyond 3 kilometers accuracy falls off considerably. Also beware of firing at
ranges less than 0.5 kilometers. If the enemy is any closer, you could be hit
by pieces of wreckage.
 Your 20mm cannon has a large ammunition supply, bu the huge rate of fire means
it goes quickly. Fire short bursts instead of long ones, especially against
aircraft. "Hosing down" a target is extremely wasteful. If the shot is that
difficult to achieve, you're crazy to waste ammo on it. In air combat cannon
shots are usually very good or very bad, with very few intermediate cases.
 Notes: The historical gunsight requires conscious "retraining" to use well,
since it doesn't require you to "place the sight on the target". However, this
weakness is more than compensated for by the advantages of anticipation firing.
The sight allows you to fire sooner, and more accurately, than any other sight
in existence. The historial gunsight is the device of choice among "in the
know" fighter jocks.
 The gunsight on this model uses a laser rangefinder slaved to the tracking
camera, rather than the traditional ranging radar. This means you can use your
gun without increasing your EMV.

_______________________________________________________________________________
Air-to-Air Duels
The Ambush

 The best way to start air-to-air combat is to surprise your opponent. Enemy
aircraft have only forward-facing radars (except the Il-76 "Mainstay" AEW&C
craft). The best way to ambush an enemy plane is to slide up behind him.
 Traditionally fighter pilots prefer to attack from above. This gives them an
energy advantage in any dogfight. However, missile tactics and the importance
of secrecy make a height advantage less valuable for a stealth pilot. Gaining
height makes you visible to enemy radar, which in turn will certainly warn your
targets. Therefore, approaching low and from behind is often wiser. Only if
your missile attacks fail and the enemy discovers you should you begin to seek
an altitude advantage.
 If you're surprised or "bounced" (attacked from above) by the enemy,
immediately look for incoming missiles and take appropriate defensive action.
Missiles arrive faster than aircraft, and therefore must be avoided first. Only
then can you begin dogfighting or attempt to escape.
_______________________________________________________________________________
The Missile Exchange
 Often an air-to-air battle starts because the enemy has discovered you, and
vectors fighters in your direction. The result, quite frequently, is a head-to-
head face-off, you against him.
 In this western-style showdown each side starts with an exchange of long- to
medium-ranged radar missiles. Be prepared to decoy, jam, and possibly chaff
the "incoming". Once your radar missile is away, switch to an AIM-9M
Sidewinder. You may get a second close-range missile shot if the AMRAAM fails.
Scoring with a head-to-head cannon shot is much more difficult, and not worth
the ammo unless either (a) you're out of missiles, or (b) you're an incredibly
good marksman.
 Naturally, if you can get off a second missile shot, so can the enemy if he
carries second-generation IR missiles (the AA-8 or AA-10 IR version). These
nasties show up frequently on MiG-29s and Su-27s, but aren't unknown on other
craft flown by Veteran or Elite pilots.
 The Early Turn: One of the most difficult, but most useful tactics in a head-
to-head match is making an early turn. This is a maneuver where you make a
tight 180 degrees turn so that you come out of the turn already closing on the
incoming MiG's tail. Against inexperienced pilots this trick is easy, since
greenhorns usually keep boring in, hoping for a cannon shot, and only thinking
about a turn after they've passed you. Against vets and better an early turn
requires fine timing. If you turn more than a second or two ahead of the enemy
you're just telegraphing your intentions. If you wait too long, you get no
advantage at all.

_______________________________________________________________________________
Enemy Missiles
 Radar-Homing AAMs: The Russian AA-10 Alamo is a "fire and forget" missile
just like your AIM-120 AMRAAM. All other Russian radar-guided weapons are semi-
active homers. Here the launching aircarft must continue to "paint" you with
its radar - the missile homes on the "paint".
 You avoid radar-homing AAMs just like SAMs (see Air-Ground Tactics, Defensive
Tactics Against SAMs, earlier). That is, use reduced EMV, ECM jamming and
ultimately chaff. Decoys can be very effective. Note that the MiG-25 and MiG-31
carry extremely long-ranged radar AAMs. Low EMV, ECM and decoy tactics are
especially effective against these weapons.
 Consider yourself fortunate that none of the Iranian F-14s have operational
Phoenix missiles. These long-range killers are especially difficult to evade.
 Infrared (IR) Homing AAMs: All IR homing AAMs are "fire and forget" weapons.
Of these the AA-8 is the most dangerous because of its second generation IR
seeker and great maneuverability. If enemy MiGs and Sukhois close to AA-8
range (8 kilometers) you're often in trouble.
 Techniques to evade IR AAMs are the same as those used against IR SAMs (see
Air-Ground Tactics, Defensive Tactics Against SAMs, earlier). That is, use the
IR jammer at long range, flares at short range. The decoy also works.
 In practice, many IR homers are fired at short ranges during a dogfight. This
means that you've got to leap onto the IR jammer when you get a launch warning,
then dodge out of the missile's 45 degree field of view immediately. At
dogfighting ranges missile flight times are very short - you don't have time to
fool around! If this fails, or you delay too long, the missile approach klaxon
will go off. Now you've got bare seconds to react: dump a flare immediately and
dodge, or you're history.
 One nice thing about IR AAMs is that the older AA-2, AA-6 and AA-7 designs all
use first generation seekers. The enemy must get on your tail before these
missiles lock on. Keep him off your tail and you avoid this entire class of
weaponry. Of course, doing that requires dogfighting skills.

_______________________________________________________________________________
Dogfighting
 The essential rule in dogfighting is to get on the enemy's tail. On all
fighter aircraft, guns and missile guidance systems only face forward. If
you're on the enemy's tail, you can shoot and he cannot. If you can't get on
his tail, at least try to place his aircraft ahead of you as much as possible,
so you have the maximum number of firing opportunities.
 Maintaining higher speed or altitude is valuable in a dogfight. A plane
slower and lower can only dodge attacks. A plane faster or higher can attack or
retreat as desired. Having a higher speed or altitude is termed the "energy
advantage".
 If the enemy is behind you, there are various classic escape maneuvers:
Turning Inside, the Scissors, the Immelmann, the Split-S, and the Yo-Yo. Not
only should you learn them, but also learn to recognize these maneuvers so you
can apply the appropriate counter-maneuver.
 Turning Inside: The simplest solution to an enemy plane coming up behind you
is - turn toward him (i.e., turn in the direction of the enemy aircraft). If
you're turning faster than he, you'll gradually circle around and get onto his
tail. This kind of a "turn match" is frequently seen when greenhorns dogfight.
 Of course, if the enemy is turning faster than you, he will eventually come
around behind you. If this happens try something else immediately. The longer
you wait the worse it gets, until he lines up a shot and toasts you.
 Scissors: A more complex way to out-turn an enemy aircraft is the scissors
maneuver. Begin a turn toward him, but once he begins to turn with you,
quickly roll over to turn in the other direction. This opens the scissors. As
the enemy realizes you've turned away and turns toward you again, you reverse
the procedure and roll back toward him again. If your turns were quicker and
tighter than his, and/or you're a slower plane, he will eventually pass in
front of you. This allows you to get onto his tail.
 Novice pilots trying to turn with you can be lured into a scissors with ease.
Even if their planes turn better, their slow reactions to each scissor opening
and closing will quickly give you the edge. More experienced enemies may avoid
this tactic by anticipating your next turn and blasting you (if they're less
maneuverable), or by pulling up and over in a yo-yo (if they're faster).
 Immelmann Turn: This maneuver is an excellent way to reverse direction
quickly. First you perform a half loop to reverse direction, then a half roll
to right your aircraft. If an enemy aircraft is behind you, an Immelmann can
bring you nose-to-nose with him.
 The original Immelmann, a German WWI fighter pilot, reputedly rolled while
vertical, allowing him to finish the loop in whatever direction he desired. He
still finished the half-loop inverted - it's aerodynamically more efficient
that way.
 Note that an Immelmann gives you an altitude gain but costs speed, since a
half-loop upward slows you down significantly.
 Split-S Turn: This maneuver complements the Immelmann. Begin by rolling
inverted, then pull the stick back to half-loop downward. Many pilots begin
the loop before the roll is completed, rolling the plane while looping. The
split-S causes you to lose considerable altitude, so it's often wise to reduce
throttle and/or use speed brakes to minimize altitude loss.
 The Split-S complements the Immelmann because you gain speed and lose
altitude. Unwary fighter pilots have sometimes tried to Split-S into or away
from the enemy without remembering their altitude. The result can be a Split-S
right into the ground!
 Yo-Yo Turn: This maneuver is used mainly by higher speed jets against slower
opponents. Therefore the relatively slow F-19 has little occasion to use it
dogfighting. However, you may see enemy MiGs attempting it against you! This
turn also requires excellent cockpit visibility, something that both the F-19
and early MiGs lack.
 In a Yo-Yo turn you climb and roll toward the enemy - until he's visible out
the top of your canopy. Then pull over into a dive while still turning. During
the dive you roll the plane to help line up your shot. Very often you'll take
that shot while inverted. Don't let it bother you.
 Because a Yo-Yo requires good spacial perception, first practice it using the
Slot View (if alone) or Tacti View (if you've got a target). In combat
conditions switching to a wide angle view is extremely helpful in pulling the
HUD around onto the enemy after you come over the top. Then you can switch back
to normal view again.
 In effect a Yo-Yo plane makes a very big turn in three dimensions. Most of the
turn radius is "consumed" with the climbing and diving, allowing a faster plane
to travel further and turn wider, yet still come out on the tail of the more
maneuverable plane. American F-4 Phantom pilots used the maneuver with great
success against slower but more maneuverable MiG-21's over North Vietnam during
the Vietnam war.
 Note that the best defense against a Yo-Yo is to reverse your turn, or to use
the third dimension yourself, usually by going into a split-S).

_______________________________________________________________________________
Enemy Guns
 The enemy has cannons equivalent to yours in range and power. However, the
enemy still uses old predicting gunsights. This means they are virtually
required to get behind you before they can make a decent shot. In addition, all
but the most elite pilots will be slow to fire, since they must place the
gunsight on the target and keep it there to score a hit.
 If you sense the enemy is behind you and ready to fire cannons, "jinking"
(small violent moves in random directions) can throw off his aim.
 Finally, Russian-built aircraft with the older GSh-23 cannon may not always
hit, since the lower volume of firepower increases the chances of you "flying
between the shells" and escaping serious injury. Don't rely on this, though -
not every 23mm shell is an unlucky one!





PART 4	MISSION BRIEFINGS------------------------------------------------------
Rules of Engagement
 Rules of Engagement (ROE) outline what targets a pilot can and cannot attack.
In an age of nuclear weapons unrestricted warfare would destroy the planet
within 24 hours. Therefore, all wars are limited to some degree. If warfare is
limited to just a local area with specific goals, ROEs are much more
restrictive. If an official state of war does not exist then the rules will be
extremely restrictive.
 In stealth missions, ROEs also determine what "exposure" of your aircraft is
allowed. In cold and limited war situations it is important that the enemy not
know exactly who or what performed the attack. This allows the politicians to
say whatever they want.

_______________________________________________________________________________
Cold War Situations
 ROE: "You may attack and destroy a target only if it is specifically required
by your mission orders. You may engage other targets only if they fire first,
or if they have spotted your plane. The mission is completely clandestine. You
must avoid detection, especially visual detection by enemy aircraft. Enemy air
or ground forces that do detect your should be destroyed, to prevent
embarassing disclosures. Neutrals and civilians must be considered friendlies,
and above all you should avoid detection by neutral aircraft and radars."
 Background Notes: In cold war situations the State Department must have
"deniability" for every mission. If the mission is successful and the political
climate seems good, the USA may claim credit for the deed. In other cases,
however, American may not wish to attach its name to the action.
 You are warned when enemy radar returns are good enough to spot your craft, or
when enemy aircraft come close enough to visually identify you. These enemies
should be destroyed, although the effort can be counterproductive if the attack
generates lots of additional sightings!
 Gratuitous or wanton destruction of all other targets is very bad in cold war.
Hitting targets of value to the civilian sector, such as bridges, oil wells and
tanks, refineries, etc., is especially bad. Your record will rapidly accumulate
black marks if you act like "Rambo" during the Cold War. After all, Rambo is
fiction, this is reality!

_______________________________________________________________________________
Limited War Situations
 ROE: "You will engage, attack, and destroy all targets specifically required
by your orders. In addition, all other targets with active weaponry (i.e.,
which could fire on your craft) may be attacked. You may engage these military
targets even if they haven't seen you yet. You may never attack non-military
targets unless so required by your orders. Neutrals must be considered
friendlies at all times, and in addition you should avoid detection by neutral
aircraft and radars at all costs."
 Background Notes: In limited war the State Department may require
deniability, since American aid to the contestants may need to be secret.
However, since there is a war, and military targets get destroyed in war, you
can attack military targets of opportunity and be rewarded (rather than
penalized) for your efforts. However, hitting non-combatant targets of value to
the civilian sector (unless ordered to) is forbidden.

_______________________________________________________________________________
Conventional War Situations
 ROE: "You will engage, attack, and destroy all targets specifically required
by your orders. In addition, any and all other targets in enemy territory may
be attacked, including civilian targets. If able to select additional targets,
select those with immediate military capability first. Neutrals must be
considered friendlies at all times, and in addition you should avoid detection
by neutral aircraft and radars at all costs.
 Background Notes: In a conventional war you are allowed unrestricted
conventional attacks on enemy territory. This includes civilian targets
formerly forbidden. However, targets with immediate military capability are
more important. Therefore, destroying enemy aircraft, airbases, SAMs, radars,
depots, headquarters, etc., gives more reward than bridges, oil refineries,
oil wells and platforms, etc., whose importance is long-term. This is because
even conventional wars are fought for short-term goals (such as the Grenada
invasion in 1983, or the Falkland Islands campaign of 1984).
 However, from a pilot's point of view, conventional war is "fun" because
anything in enemy territory is fair game. Of course, the disadvantage is that
the enemy are prepared and alert for intruders.

_______________________________________________________________________________
ONC Map Coordinates
 ONC maps use the standard US Army military grid system for locating positions
anywhere on the globe.
 The maps are divided into large squares. Each square is identified by a two-
letter code, such as WX, JC, etc. Within each square are smaller rows and
columns, ruled into smaller squares. These smaller squares are identified by a
column and row number from 0 to 9. Following the "read right and up" rule, the
column number appears first, then the row number. This is the same as basic
algebra, where the "x" horizontal value is given first, then the "y" vertical
value. (Algebra? American algebra obviously...)
 For example, coordinate JC79 means large map square JC, column 7, row 9.
 Unfortunately, we didn't have the time, inclination, or diskspace to fit the
four maps in... possibly they will appear on a future menu.





Missions-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Air-Air Missions

Selecting Armaments
 In limited or conventional war situations the AIM-120A AMRAAM is the missile
of choice. You can lob these at the enemy from a full 30 kilometers range. If
you're firing at a plane with close escorts, space the shots 5 to 10 seconds
apart (the higher their altitude, the longer the spacing). This is because a
burning, exploding plane is a prominent target to the missile's seeker. If your
missiles arrive right behind one another, those following may home on the plane
hit by the first. Worse, the terminal homing of the AMRAAM is somewhat
questionable - it tends to take the closest target at the time, rather than the
target you originally designated! Therefore, when shooting into a group you
can't count on which plane will be hit. Finally, if the enemy is veteran or
elite, don't be surprised if the enemy manages to outmaneuver your missile by
turning inside it.
 In cold war, guns are the weapons of choice. With these you can insure the
proper target is hit, and no others. Unfortunately, getting close enough for a
shot may reveal your presence. A good compromise is the AIM-9M Sidewinder, a
fast-turning close-in dogfighting missile. It's usually easy to line up a 5 to
8 km shot, where the Sidewinder has a clear run at the target and nobody else
is likely to get in the way.

_______________________________________________________________________________
Ambushing a Leader
 Here an important personage is travelling by plane; your job is to make sure
he doesn't arrive! The plane takes off about the same time as your own.
Remember that his plane, your objective, is NOT the flashing dot on the
satellite/radar map (on your left-side cockpit CRT). That is his destination.
 Although it's possible to just fly to his destination and wait, roving fighter
patrols or local air defenses eventually will spot you. In general, the wiser
approach is to find the best way to "sneak through" enemy patrols and SAM
radars to intercept him en route.
 In limited or conventional war you can take down his plane and escort with
AMRAAMs. In a cold war situation you'll need to close for a clean Sidewinder
or gun shot. Remember, though, that if the fighter escorts get a visual ID on
your plane you must "zap" them too. If your attack location is well away from
any ground radars or Mainstay AEW&C planes, you can attack from above, hit your
man, drop a decoy to confuse them, and zoom away with maximum speed at low
altitude (say 200').

_______________________________________________________________________________
Intercepting Terrorists or Commandos
 In this mission you know a transport plane, accompanied by fighters, will head
for friendly territory. Your objective is to eliminate them before they arrive.
The problem is, you don't know their destination.
 As you take off, watch the enemy aircraft carefully. Circle around a bit,
observing their course until you can guess their objective. Once you know their
goal, it's easy to pick a nice quiet spot to ambush them. Often you can stay in
friendly territory all the way! Properly executed, this mission is a nice, easy
milk run.

_______________________________________________________________________________
Eliminating a Fighter Patrol
 Enemy fighter patrols have a nasty habit of lurking near their own air
defense systems, and/or being supported by Mainstay AEW&C planes. Going in
after them can cause quite a battle.
 One trick to avoid this mess is to publicize your presence in a nearby area.
You should pick an area with little or no SAM coverage, and with no nearby
airbases. If you can lure the fighter patrol to you, at this spot, the battle
may be much easier. The typical way to accomplish the lure is to raise your
EMV (by flying high, turning on the ECM, and opening the bay doors). If that
doesn't work, clobbering a thing or two on the ground may catch their interest.
 Once you've "dangled the lure", it's wise to take a low profile again, so you
can ambush the enemy fighters as they arrive. As in many other aspects of
modern warfare, getting the first shot is a big advantage.

_______________________________________________________________________________
Destroying a Recon Bomber
 In most cases you must chase an enemy plane on its way home. Catch and attack
him as quickly as possible. The longer you delay, the closer he gets to SAM
cover and fighter aid. This is one mission where climbing to a higher altitude
can be rewarding - you travel faster, farther at high altitude than low. Of
course, don't go so high that you wake up the enemy and attract lots of
fighters and missiles.

_______________________________________________________________________________
Attacking a Cruise Missile
 These aircraft are most unobliging targets. They cruise around deep behind
their own lines, guarded by SAMs and closely escorted by fighters. Given the
defenses, attacking these planes is like hitting a ground target. You need to
sneak or punch your way through defenses, elude counterattacks, and blast the
primary, just like a strike mission.

_______________________________________________________________________________
Taking Down the Mainstay
 The Il-76 "Mainstay" AEW&C plane is the most difficult aircraft target. Sooner
or later its radar will see you, forcing you to fight through fighters and SAMs
to reach it. Make your approach as stealthy as possible: it postpones this hour
of reckoning. Destroying one or two crucial SAM radar sites on your way in can
be useful - it opens a radar-free corridor to the target, and at the same time
may draw off enemy interceptors, perhaps even some of the Mainstay's fighter
escort.


_______________________________________________________________________________
Strike Missions
Choosing Your Weapons
 Selecting armaments for ground attacks is always difficult. The favorite
weapon is the AGM-65D Maverick missile. It's your longest-ranged ground attack
weapon (30 km; the Harpoon fires farther but is only good against warships).
The Maverick's also an accurate "fire and forget" weapon. Its only weakness is
that one missile can't always do the job (see the Weapon Effectiveness Chart
at the end of this doc - ratings below B- mean the missile may not destroy the
target). Fortunately, Mavericks are just fine against radar installations. Most
pilots carry as many as they can afford, and fear the day when the crew chief
tells them no more are available.
 Choosing between laser-guided bombs, retarded bombs, and free-fall bombs is
often a matter of personal preference. Many times more than one weapon will do
the job, so you can pick a type whose attack run suits your style. Other times
you may be forced to use a certain weapon because nothing else does the job
right.
 When choosing weapons, don't expect much from a weapon rated C or D against a
target. Scoring a hit with such always requires a lot of luck. Certainly don't
rely on such to take out your primary target. Weapons rated A or B can be
relied upon, provided you deliver them accurately.

_______________________________________________________________________________
Secret Airstrips
 Dropping off or picking up items deep behind enemy territory seems rather
straightforward. After all, you don't have to fly into SAM batteries or go
head-to-head with fighter patrols.
 Instead, a secret airstrip challenges your flying skill. You must manage a
landing without an ILS to guide you. Worse, the strip is only half the length
of a normal runway. You must land gently, at low speed (under 160 kts,
preferably), and touchdown near the start. Otherwise you'll roll off the other
end and crash! To make matters worse, the strip's lights are only on for a
limited time. Make a note of the time the lights go off, then periodically
check the Waypoints screen on the right-side CRT (tap Select Way Pt key) to
see how much time you've got. Once the lights are out landing is virtually
impossible.
 If your opponents are skillful, their intelligence may have dangerous
information about this mission. You could find enemy fighter patrols
uncomfortably close to your objective, or bouncing you just as you're trying to
land!

_______________________________________________________________________________
Airdrops
 These missions are usually "milk runs". Your job is to avoid action and just
fly over a radio beacon that's quite clear on your HUD. The only real worry is
reaching the beacon before it is turned off. Make a note of the "turn off" time
and periodically check the Waypoints screen on the right-side CRT (tap Select
Way Pt key). Once the beacon turns off there's no way to find the drop site.
 Be warned that skillful opponents may have intelligence about this mission
from their spies. You could find enemy fighter patrols lurking around the
objective. If so, you could attempt to lure them away, or blow them away,
depending on your ROE (rules of engagement).

_______________________________________________________________________________
Photo Recon Runs
 There are two hard things about photographic missions: using the camera, and
keeping a low profile while you're doing it!
 Because the 135mm/IR camera is on a fixed mounting, you must steer the plane
to aim the camera. This is more difficult than it seems, since the target swims
into and out of view all too fast. Experienced pilots advise you to line up on
the target 8 to 10 km away. Set up a perfectly straight course and keep to it.
At 2 km to 4 km hit the bay doors and brakes, then pull the nose gradually up,
bringing the camera's aim onto the target. Keep in this regime, using subtle
pitch changes to keep the target in the camera, while snapping pictures. You've
got plenty of film: don't be afraid to take plenty of extras!
 Success is announced right on the CRT. As soon as you have it, close the doors
and brakes, then dive low for your escape. Don't be surprised if the enemy
spots you during the photo run.
 Photo runs over enemy troop concentrations and/or near SAMs are especially
nerve-wracking. You may need to take out a SAM radar before making the run. If
shoulder-fired SAMs infest the area, your only hope is to dump a decoy before
you start, run your IR jammer as long as you can, and/or periodically dump
flares.

_______________________________________________________________________________
Flying against SAMs
 Destroying a SAM battery requires that you "sneak up" on them as best you can,
then nail his radar first with a Maverick or HARM. With the radar out of
action, the missiles are helpless. Unless there are other SAMs nearby you can
have a strafing "picnic" with the missile launchers until a fighter patrol
shows up.
 Remember that the safest place around a SAM battery is directly above it. The
radar cannot look straight up, and the longer-ranged missies (such as the SA-2,
-5,-10 and -12) have a minimum range of 4 to 5 km. Of course, getting to this
point can be rather tricky. It doesn't hurt to run over the litany of defense
techniques before going after a SAM: disappearing, decoys, ECM, chaff and
manuevering.

_______________________________________________________________________________
Hitting the Sub Pens
 The Severomorsk submarine pens in the North Cape are a unique and special
target. These must be attacked by toss bombing from the north: you must place
an FAE through the sea doors. This means flying straight at the mountain,
pulling up at the last minute. You may wish to make your run at 500' to 1,000',
instead of 200'. This lets you begin the toss sooner (about 3 to 4 km away),
giving you more leeway to clear the mountainside.
 Beware the Krivak-class frigates that patrol seaward of this submarine base.
Their radars and SAMs cannot be ignored! You'll want to bring along a couple of
Penguin-3 ASMs to eliminate these fellows. Even in Cold War, chances are good a
Krivak will get a radar "make" on you, forcing you to hit him.

_______________________________________________________________________________
Sinking Ships
 The ideal ship-killer is the AGM-84A Harpoon. This heavy missile is your
longest-ranged weapon. It has a superb targeting system that hits the ship you
target, even a carrier with a ring of escorts.
 However, don't underestimate enemy warships, especially those of the Russian
Northern Fleet. The larger ships have exceptionally good radars and very
powerful SAMs. Patrol ships can be knocked out with a single missile, but a
task force has so many ships that any close approach means you'll be dodging
missiles left and right.
 Most enemy ships stay close to friendly shorelines, with fighter cover nearby
(if not overhead already). Don't forget that enemy aircraft carriers have their
own fighters: you can count on a few flying CAP (combat air patrol).
 When fighting a conventional war with Libya, or in the Persian Gulf, be
careful about attacking merchant ships. Avoid those on the high seas or near
friendly coastlines; only attack ships close to enemy ports or shore.
Otherwise, you could end up hitting a neutral ship by accident.

_______________________________________________________________________________
Bombing Runs
 When attacking with laser or free-fall bombs, you'll have to rise above
minimum altitude during the attack run. This, combined with the open bay doors,
raises your EMV considerably. Try to minimize this exposure as much as
possible. Remember, the higher your EMV, the better target you are for enemy
missiles. The longer you're a big target, the more chances the enemy has to
launch and hit you.
 The most frightening prospect is a bombing run directly over enemy troop
concentrations. There's nothing worse than a host of shoulder-fired SAMs rising
up at you. These are on the one missile site you can't knock out. Fortunately,
they have a very short range. Still, flying through a barrage of SA-14s,
dumping a flare every two seconds, while trying to line up a bomb, will turn
your hair prematurely white.





Libya--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Introduction

 Politics: Libya is ruled by Col. Mu'ammar al-Qadhaffi, leader of the secret
army organization that deposed the former king in 1969. The capital city is
Tripoli and the nation's cjief source of wealth is oil sold to western nations.
 Military Forces: Rich by third world standards, Libya buys most of its
armaments from the Soviet Union. Personnel are trained by Soviet military
advisors, but national pride has prohibited (so far) any significant Soviet
presence. Soviet advisors are not invited on combat operations.
 The Libyan Army has approximately 60,000 men, the Navy has 53 ships and 6,500
men, while the Air Force has about 530 planes, 30 combat helicopters, and 8,500
men. A paramilitary "Pan-African Legion" of about 10,000 also exists.
 In addition, Libya has built and supported a variety of training camps for
terrorist groups.
 Geography: Libya is a desert nation. Along the coast it has only one mountain
region that is visually distinctive: the Jabal al Akbar to the east of
Benghazi. These mountains greatly restrict the capabilities of Benghazi and
Benina radars. Deep in the desert, east of Sabha, are the more desolate and
isolated mountains of the Al Haruj al Aswad, while to the west are the great
sand seas (ergs).

_______________________________________________________________________________
Level of Conflict
 Cold War: At times Libya has been enthusiastic backer of international
terrorist organizations. It provides funds, arms, military training, and base
camp sites for a variety of Arab and other terrorist groups. America has
already attacked tactical military targets in retaliation for Libya's role in
numerous incidents of international terrorism in Europe and the Mediterranean.
 Limited War: The Libyan army has fought minor border clashes against Egypt to
the east. Egypt is an American ally, and so far has proved considerably
superior, militarily, to Libya. The Libyan army has also attempted an invasion
of Chad to the south. After a protracted campaign against Chad and her ally
France, Libyan supply lines through the Sahara desert were cut, forcing a
Libyan retreat. Future limited wars between Libya and any of her neighbours are
possible.
 Conventional War: In the even of NATO-Warsaw Pact conflict in the
Mediterranean and/or Europe, Libya is expected to provide bases for Soviet
aircraft and warships operating in the Mediterranean. These bases could become
the westernmost outposts of Russian forces contesting the Mediterranean.

_______________________________________________________________________________
Friendly Bases
 Sigonella on Sicily (UD15): The USA maintains a military base at Trapani, on
western Sicily, and the Sigonella military field in southeastern Sicily. The
Sigonella runway is the main staging point for air attacks against the North
African coast, especially Libya. Unfortunately, the flight distances are quite
long. Using this base virtually requires that your F-19 carry extra fuel.
 CV America at Sea (UD70): This 60,000-ton "Kitty Hawk" class conventional
aircraft carrier, designated CV66, often serves with the US 6th fleet in the
Mediterranean. It participated in the 1986 raids against Tripoli and Benghazi.
The carrier is ideally positioned for launching and recovering strikes against
Benghazi, the Gulf of Sirte, or targets deep in the Libyan desert. Here it
cruises on a southerly course with its traditional ring of close escorts. The
carrier remains well north of the Gulf of Sirte to avoid SSM attacks from
enemy ships and aircraft. It is surrounded by escorts and regularly replenishes
the CAP (combat air patrol) with F-18 launches.

_______________________________________________________________________________
Neutral Bases
 These airbases are in neutral territory. You should not use these bases unless
specifically so ordered, or if you must make an emergency landing.
 Suda Bay on Crete (VD41): This airfield, near the city of Khania, is not an
American base, although in years past it was a major NATO air and naval base.
It has the advantage of being both closer and less public than equivalent
airfields in Greece or Egypt.
 Halfar on Malta (UD13): This airfield is on the island of Malta. Once a
critical strength position for the British Commonwealth in the Mediterranean,
it is now a neutral port and sometime tourist haven.

_______________________________________________________________________________
Seeing the Sights in Libya
 Flying over Libya is a unique experience. It is a truly desert nation, a land
of red and brown hardscrabble with patches of tan sand and gray boulder fields.
Water is all underground, seeping to the surface in occasional patches of green
oasis or mountain valley. Mountain ranges are low, undulating areas full of
small hillocks and short peaks. From the air it's often hard to tell the
difference between again roadways and the dark wadis (gullies) in the desert.
But some works of man stand out, particularly the rust red of oil wells and
pipelines, or the distinctive star-pattern of SAM batteries.

_______________________________________________________________________________
Libya
 Tripoli (TC87): The capital city of Libya has a large military-civilian
airbase at Idris, and is well protected by SAM batteries. Until recently these
were long-range SA-5 Gammons, but there are indications that Russian military
advisors may replace these with the formidable SA-12 Gladiator.
 Tripoli is also the site of a major army headquarters, various military
depots, oil storage areas, and sometimes terrorist training camps. Missile
boats often cruise off the coast.
 Sabha (UB17): This southern town is the main military base supporting Libya's
southerly border expansion. It was the major depot for the Chad war, and is
still extremely important to Libyan trans-Saharan ambitions. The most
important military installations here are the large airbase and the SAM battery
protecting it.
 Misratah (UC26) & Sirt (UC43): These two coastal towns are much smaller
areas, with lower level military headquarters. The ports include oil storage
tanks for refueling ships. Sirt is a secondary naval base, supporting missile
boats that cruise the western side of the "Line of Death".
 Ras Lanuf (UC82) & Port Brega (UC92): Ras Lanuf is Libya's largest and newest
oil facility. The majority of all oil for export is stored here, and a large
number of oil tankers are usually coming and going at all times. There is also
a refinery, vast "farms" of oil tanks, and a major military headquarters. Port
Brega is an older oil facility, still in operation despite the completion of
Ras Lanuf.
 A number of SAM batteries are sited in this strategically vital area. In
addition the Port Brega airfield, west of the town, serves both ports.
 Benghazi (VC16): This city is the site of Libya's second-largest military
base, including the Benina airfield and powerful protective SAM batteries. The
city itself is large, with a military headquarters and a few small oil storage
facilites to serve the ancient port. Terrorist training camps are not uncommon
in the hills to the west.
 Al Badya (VC37): This sleepy coastal town in the mountainous Jabal al Akbar
has major military significance. It overlooks the narrow Ionian sea between
Libya and Greece, making it an ideal site for anti-ship missiles. There is a
small airstrip and SAM site as well.
 Oil Fields: The great oil fields of Libya are in the southeast, where
literally thousands of wells pump crude from the ground, which is piped to Ras
Lanuf and Port Brega. The great producing fields can be found near Raguba
(UC90), Waha (VB18), Amal (VC30), Jalo Oasis (VC40), and Gialo (VB49). Most of
the great fields have a few storage tanks on site, to hold crude temporarily
until it can be piped to the port. However, the majority of storage tanks are
at the ports, not here on the fields.
 Secret Bases: Western intelligence operatives in Libya are preparing two
secret, hard-pack surfaces suitable for aircraft landings. One is at Al
Mukhayli (ONC VC43), the other is on the edge of the great ergs, at Yafran
(ONC TC93).

_______________________________________________________________________________
Air Defenses
 Libyan air defenses use Russian-built equipment. Russian advisors train native
Libyan crews, who then operate the equipment. SA-2 Guideline and SA-5 Gammon
SAMs have been the backbone of Libyan air defenses, but there are rumors of
upgrades to the new SA-10 Grumble and SA-12 Gladiator systems.
 Local military forces make use of the SA-7 and SA-14 shoulder-fired missiles.
These are also popular terrorist weapons, and can be expected in the vicinity
of terrorist camps, Libyan army units use various medium-range SAMs, including
the SA-8, -9, -11, and -13. However, these are not always in the best state of
repair.

_______________________________________________________________________________
Air Force
 Fighters: The Libyan Air Force is primarily composed of MiG-23MF "Flogger"
fighters, with over 140 craft in inventory. It also has a smaller number of
MiG-25 "Foxbats" for reconnaissance and long-range interception, as well as
some antiquated MiG-21s. The Air Force also has various Mirage 5D fighter-
bombers for ground attack missions.
 Intelligence expects that MiG-23s and 25s will be your primary air-to-air
opponents, although in Conventional War, or against higher quality pilots, you
may encounter the new MiG-29 "Fulcrum" flown by Soviet personnel.
 Reconnaissance Bombers: Although Libya does not possess any Tu-95 "Bear"
reconnaissance bombers, Russian planes of this type frequently operate from
Libyan bases.
 Airborne Early Warning & Control: Libya has no AEW&C craft. No Russian
Il-76 "Mainstays" are expected to use Libyan bases, since they are too
precious. In wartime Libya is a distant outpost in the middle of NATO's great
strength in the Western Mediterranean. Aircraft losses would be high - too
high to permit risking the rare and costly AEW&C craft.
 Air Transports: It is suspected that Libya's antiquated fleet of C-130H and
C-47 air transports (built in America) will be replaced with Russian
equipment, perhaps including the new An-72 "Coaler" jet transport.

_______________________________________________________________________________
Navy
 The Libyan Navy is primarily composed of Missile Corvettes and Missile Patrol
Boats. The largest of these are the 770-ton Russian-built Nanuchka II class
armed with Styx surface-to-surface missiles, SA-N-4 surface-to-air missiles,
and a twin 57mm gun turret. The other boats include the Russian Osa-class,
Italian-built Wadi M'ragh class and the French-built La Combattante II types;
these have poorer missiles and SA-N-5 SAMs, or no SAMs at all.
 The Nanuchkas are the best boats in the Libyan Navy. They perform the most
aggressive patrols, making them the primary threat. Patrols occur frequently
in the Gulf of Sirte, south of the "Line of Death". Sometimes the Libyan air
force flies fighter missions in support of the patrols.





The Persian Gulf---------------------------------------------------------------
Introduction
 Politics: Iran has been ruled by Shi'ite (a Moslem sect) radicals since their
overthrow of the pro-American Shah in 1979. In September, 1980 Iraq attacked
Iran, beginning a long, costly war between those nations. Both contestants are
viewed with distrust by the Arab states along the south of the Persin Gulf.
Iran's use of international terrorism as a tool of foreign policy has not
improved the nation's image.
 Iran also calls for a Shi'ite religious revolution throughout the Islamic
world. This naturally bothers the leadership of the Arab states, since their
governments are Sunni (another Moslem sect). However, Iran is populated by
Persians, not Arabs. So far this cultural and linguistic barrier has hindered
the spread of Iranian Shi'ite radicalism across the Persian Gulf to the Arab
states.
 Military Forces: Under the Shah, Iran's oil-rich finances permitted massive
investment in military forces, mostly from the USA. Since the revolution many
complex weapons have failed for lack of spare parts and maintenance, while most
of the rest were damaged or destroyed in the war with Iraq. Iran has some
sophisticated aircraft and missiles remaining, but these are deployed to
protect key cities in the interior, rather than as a border defense.
 Geography: Iran is a large nation with varied geography. The Elbruz and
Zagros mountain ranges run from the northwest corner (where Iran touches
Turkey and the Soviet trans-Caucasus) diagonally southeast, along the border
with Iraq, and then parallel to the Persian Gulf. South of these mountains, at
the head of the Gulf, are Iran's oilfields. North of the mountains the nation
is divided into two regions. The western part, near Iraq, Turkey, and trans-
Caucasus Russia, is fertile, heavily populated, and includes most of the major
cities and industrial plants. The eastern part, bordering Pakistan,
Afghanistan, and Soviet Central Asia, is mostly barren deserts and mountains
with a small, impoverished, undereducated population.

_______________________________________________________________________________
Level of Conflight
 Cold War: Iran's use of terrorism has been very effective to data. America's
confused policy respons, culminating in the Iran-Contra scandal, is one
example. However, eventually the continue violence may provoke a military
response from the Western nations.
 Limited War: Iran and Iraq have been fighting a limited war since 1980. The
cities of Abadan and Basra, on the national border where the Tigris-Euphrates
rivers empty into the Gulf, are largely ruined by the fighting. Running
northward are two opposing lines of trenches and bunkers with a "no-man's land"
between.
 Each side attempted to discourage Persian Gulf shipping from aiding the
opposition, resulting in missile and rocket attacks on many freighters and
tankers. In 1987 and 1988 American fleet units escorting oil tankers became
involved in surface battles with Iranian ships and boats, as well as an
unfortunate civilian airliner that flew through a battle area and was shot down
by the somewhat inept crew of the missile cruiser USS Vincennes.
 Conventional War: Russia could invade Iran as part of a wider NATO-Warsaw
Pact conflict, or as a counter to the Shi'ite radicals, who would like to
spread their revolution to the USSR's Moslem population. America may be drawn
into invading Iran by its confused foreign policy. The vast and often hostile
geography, not to mention a large and hostile population, argue against
traditional military invasions. Instead, a gradual escalation from limited war,
including bigger and deeper air attacks, is more probable.

_______________________________________________________________________________
Friendly Bases
 America's strongest allies in the Persian Gulf are Saudi Arabia and the tiny
island kingdom of Bahrain.
 CV Nimitz at Sea (KY83): This huge 80,000-ton nuclear carrier is the class
ship of the latest and most powerful program of aircraft carriers. Normally
assigned to the Pacific Fleet, it is prepared to visit the Indian Ocean at any
time. Here it sails with a close escort of destroyes, and has its F-18s on
regular rotation in CAP (combat air patrol).
 American aircraft carriers do not sail into the restricted waters of the
Persian Gulf, where they would be "sitting ducks" for land-based air and
missile attacks. Carrier task forces remain in the Indian Ocean, although the
Nimitz and her ring of close escorts have sailed deep into the Gulf of Oman, to
provide a base as close as possible to Persian Gulf targets. If threatened the
ship can always sail to the southeast and escape into the vast expanses of the
Indian Ocean.
 Ras as Saffaniyah (JY19): This is Saudi Arabia's northenmost oil terminal and
port along the Gulf. Its airfield is in a useful strategic location. Basing
privileges for a secret "stealth" mission can be arranged with the pro-American
Saudi monarchy.
 Dhahram (JY54) & Al Hufuf (JY44): Dhahram is Saudi Arabia's largest port city
on the Persian Gulf, making its airfield and unwise choice for stealth
aircraft operations. However, the Al Hufuf airfield slightly inland is a
strategically useful and less public position for basing missions and raids.
Either can be used for stealth missions, although Al Hufuf is preferable.
 As Salamiyah (JY00): This small airbase outside of the capital Riyadh is a
nice, quite location where clandestine missions can be organized easily.
Unfortunately, the gulf coast is far away.
 Bahrain (JY65): This small island nation is strongly pro-American, providing
large naval and air base facilities for American military forces. It is fairly
easy to operate stealth missions from here.

_______________________________________________________________________________
Neutral Bases
 Kuwait is a friendly neutral nation, Oman is neutral but pro-Western, and the
UAE are studiously neutral. (At the time of writing/typing this, Iraq has just
invaded Kuwait, but America is being amazingly limp-wristed about it, and have
not offered military assistance, though Kuwait has requested it. USS
Independence is steaming towards the Gulf, but is unlikely to actually do
anything!)
 Kuwait City in Kuwait (JZ12): Originally neutral, Iranian threats and attacks
caused Kuwait to seek US military aid and support. The Kuwait airport can be
used to occasionally stage missions that demonstrate America's support to
Kuwait, or for emergency landings. However, Kuwait is fearful of provoking more
Iranian hostility, and therefore will not grant America basing rights. Besides,
they'd like to stay on the good side of the Soviet Union too!
 Kuwaits great oil fields are south of the city, in ONC JZ20 and JZ30.
 Qatar (JY75): This small independent nation works hard at the appearance of
neutrality, probably because it has strong pro-American and strong pro-Iranian
factions. Although missions cannot be staged regularly from here, it is
possible to use the pro-American groups to aid in specific clandestine
missions or emergency landing situations.
 Ruweiss (KY01) & Tarif (KY11): These small oil ports of the United Arab
Emirates are not especially friendly to the American cause. Because the UAE is
a decentralized government, pressure and money in the right places could permit
a clandestine mission or emergency landing.
 Some of the largest oil fields of the UAE are in this area (ONC KY22-23).
 Abu Dhabi (KY31): Abu Dhabi is the major city of the United Arab Emirates
(UAE), where the appearance of neutrality is most important. Staging missions
or emergency landings from this base is very difficult, but not impossible if
Iranian diplomacy succeeds in making yet more enemies.
 Al Khafi at Dubai (KY65): This large airfield, outside the city of Dubai, is
the most strategically useful of all UAE airfields. It is the base closest to
south-central Iran, and as such an important launching or retrieval point for
deep missions. However, as at Abu Dhabi, political problems make the use of
this base difficult to impossible.
 Muscat in Oman (KY90): Oman is careful to remain neutral in all affairs, but
is strongly pro-Western. For example, much of its army is trained and officered
by "retired" British military personnel. The military portion of the Muscat
airfield is available for missions and emergency landings, provided everything
remains secret and politically "deniable".

_______________________________________________________________________________
The Sights in the Persian Gulf
 The Persian Gulf is a desert region, not unlike Libya, except for the large,
high spine of mountains that runs diagonally through Iran from the northwest to
the southeast. However, water is more plentiful, especially in Iran, resulting
in increased agriculture and a large number of local irrigation works to
control the seasonal run-off from the mountain highlands.
 The Gulf has many interesting and exceptional areas, such as the Tigris-
Euphrates watershed that reaches the head of the gulf around Abadan. Once a
great seaport and teaming metropolis, the destruction of the Iran-Iraq war has
reduced the area to a ruin of small towns and villages.
 Kharg Island, despite wartime attacks, remains one of the great wonders of the
world. Surrounded by oil platforms and supertankers, guarded by missile boats
and fighter patrols, it remains the site of numerous refineries and oil
storage tanks. There are also great oilfields south of Kuwait City, north of
Bushehr in the Bandar-e-Rig, on Bahrain and Qatar, and along the UAE coastline
near Ruweiss and Tarif, as well as assorted individual platforms along the
Arabian Gulf coast.
 Another interesting region of Iran is the great valley of Bandar-e-Lengeh and
Bandar 'Abbas. Seasonal rivers, flowing from the mountains, have formed a
fertile valley floor that empties into the Straits of Hormuz, the strategic
doorway to the Persian Gulf. On the opposite side (the southern side) of the
straits, the mountainous peninsula of Musandam knifes into the straits,
creating a narrow choke-point of naval traffic.

_______________________________________________________________________________
Iran
 Upper Khuzestan Triangle - Dezful (JZ38), Masjed Soleyman (JZ47), Ahvaz
(JZ37): These cities are the main "rear areas" behind the Iraq-Iran
battlefront. They have a variety of SAMs. Although all originally had airbase
facilities, it is believed that only Masjed Soleyman's is still intact.
 Abadan (JZ24): This city is located at the final junction of the Tigris and
Euphrates Rivers, just before they empty into the Persian Gulf. Numerous
battles in and around this area have destroyed a large part of the city. The
surrounding countryside, once contained with dikes and irrigation projects, is
now reverting to a poisonous marshland in the aftermath of heavy fighting,
which included the use of poison gas.
 Bandar Khomenyi (JZ44): This is the main Iranian military base behind the
southern part of the Iran-Iraq front, and a major staging base for military
supplies and munitions of all sorts. It has a large airbase, powerful SAM
batteries, and a major military headquarters.
 Bandar-e-Rig Oil Fields: These oil fields, clustered along the coast and
inland hills (JZ61 and JZ71) are a key source of Iran's oil wealth.
 Kharg Island (JZ60): This island is covered with refineries, oil storage
tanks, and port facilities for oil tankers. Until the Iran-Iraq war it was the
greatest oil terminal in the world. Repeated attacks have ruined many of the
facilities, but never all of them. Now protected by SAM batteries, and missile
boat patrols, it is still Iran's main port for oil export.
 Much of Iran's oil wealth is slightly offshore. One of the heaviest
concentrations of oil platforms exists in the vicinity of Kharg Island. Beware
that some platforms are now used by Iranian Shi'ite "Guards" as military bases.
 Bushehr (JZ80): This important coastal city was once a major oil port, but is
now completely overshadowed by neighboring Kharg Island. The military forces on
its airbase, and the SAM batteries, are not always first rate. However, it is
home port for many Iranian frigates and missile boats that patrol the gulf.
 Shiraz (KZ03): This inland city, sited on a highland plateau, is one of
the largest Iranian cities. It is also the nerve center and main headquarters
for Iran's southern military command - the forces responsible for the Persian
Gulf. There is an exceptionally large military airbase here, and it is usually
protected by a powerful SAM battery.
 Esfahan (JZ89): This inland city, nestled in a large col of the Zagros
Mountains, is the classic "gateway" to northwestern Iran. As a transportation
and population center it naturally boasts an airfield, and SAM sites protecting
it. The current state of the Iran-Iraq war has a powerful effect on what sorts
of aircraft are based here.
 Yazd (KZ38) and Kerman (KZ84): These two cities are distant population
centers on the edge of the Iranian deserts. Both cities are dominated by a
strong traditionalist sentiment, which in recent years has translted into
fervent Shi'ite extremism. However, the huge war losses are causing many
families to reconsider their support for the Jihad.
 Bandar-e Lengeh (KY57): This western city on the Straits of Hormuz has a
minor military base, including an airfield and SAM battery. However, its
primary function is civilian, serving the large oil fields in this area.
 Seasonal rivers running from the mountains to the west down into Bandar-e
Lengeh have a variety of interesting road and rail bridges over them.
 Offshore Oil Platforms are especially common in KY35-45.
 Bandar 'Abbas (KY68): This city is Iran's major military base on the Straits
of Hormuz. Major Iranian Navy elements are based here, as well as the latest
SAMs and a large, well equipped military airbase.
 Secret Bases: Western intelligence operatives in Iran are preparing two
secret, hard-pack surfaces suitable for aircraft landings. One is in the
Shalamzar valley (JZ67) in the Zagros Mountains, the other in the mountains
south of Kerman, at KZ82.

_______________________________________________________________________________
Air Defenses
 HAWK batteries are Iran's longest ranged surface-to-air missiles. Nearly
exhausted in fighting with Iraq, these weapons are formidable defenders of
Iran once more. The reason? A large shipment of parts and spare missiles by
Lt. Colonel Oliver North, USMC. He hoped to trade them for American hostages in
Lebanon. Iran got the missiles, the hostages remained in Lebanon, and North
resigned from the Marines Corps. Think about that when one fires at you!
 Rapier batteries, sold by Britain to Iran, are fast, but shorter ranged, and
hindered by a fire control system that is primarily visual, with the radar
intended originally as backup. The Rapier radar system never approached the
quality or sophistication of the HAWK (MicroProse must have shares in the
company that makes HAWKs!). In fact, in the Falkland Islands fighting, the
Rapier was surprisingly ineffective. (It was?!)
 The Tigercat, an antiquated British design, appears in less-important areas.
Many Tigercat sites have little or no radar, since the missile is designed for
visual control. The Seacat is a naval version of the Tigercat, found on
Iranian Vosper Mk 5 type frigates. It is somewhat more dangerous because the
frigates have decent radar search systems.

_______________________________________________________________________________
Iranian Air Force
 This service arm is composed primarily of American-built aircraft acquired
during the Shah's rule. Before the outbreak of the Iran-Iraq war the Air Force
had a nominal strength of 75 F-14 Tomcats, about 200 F-4D and F-4E Phantom IIs,
140 F-5E Tiger IIs, plus various other planes and helicopters, including C-130
Hercules transports and P-3F Orion reconnaissance bombers.
 Fighters: Iran lacks the sophisticated technicians and parts to keep its
F-14s operational. Within a year after the revolution fewer than five were
functional. No missiles or parts exist for the long-range Phoenix AAM system,
but some F-14s still have functional long-range radars. F-14s can carry AIM-7F
Sparrows or AIMN-9H Sidewinders.
 The older but less effective F-4s and F-5s are easier to maintain. These
planes are the backbone of the Iranian fighting air force, intercepting Iraqi
raids, guarding rear areas and ships from attack, and occasionally attempting
a raid into Iraqi territory.
 Iranian fighters are equipped with AIM-9H Sidewinders, one of the last and
best first-generation IR AAMs. The F-4 Phantoms (but not the F-5 Tigers) are
designed to carry the AIM-7F Sparrow, a long range radar-homing missile.
 Reconnaissance Bombers: Iran has few naval reconnaissance bombers, and
most of those are P-3C Orions with inoperative electronic gear. Such planes
are reduced to making visual patrols only - a waste of aviation fuel in a
modern warfare environment!
 However, it's possible that long-range Russian Tu-95 "Bear" bombers may make
an appearance, flying from Afghanistan or Yemen.
 Airborne Early Warning & Control: Iran has no "AWACS" or other AEW&C
aircraft. Instead, the few operational F-14s are used in this role, since the
F-14 has an extremely powerful air search radar.
 Air Transports: Iran has a variety of small, medium and large air transports,
including the American C-130 Hercules, German Fokker F.27, French Dassault-
Breguet Falcon 20, and Boeing 707 and 747 transport models. The exact types
available vary greatly, depending on the supply of spare parts and the presence
of knowledgeable mechanics. Given Iran's dislike of the West, some consider it
likely that she will shop in Russia for the next transports bought, perhaps the
new and very flexible An-72 Coaler.

_______________________________________________________________________________
Navy
 The Iranian Navy has suffered greatly in the Iran-Iraq war, since most
resources go into the army and air force. Many ships were damaged in the
fighting and remain unrepaired; others have deteriorated badly for lack of
maintenance. The great naval base at Khorramshahr, near Abadan, was destroyed
early in the war and remains a ruin in no-man's land.
 It is believed that one or more of the four Vosper Mark 5 frigates are still
functional. These 1,100-ton ships include a Seacat SAM surface-to-air missile
system and a 4.5" gun turret. Occasional patrols by these or smaller ships can
be expected in the region of Kharg Island or in the Straits of Hormuz. If
functional, the Vosper frigates pose a significant military threat.
 Iran's Shi'ite "Guards" also man a large number of fast motorboats. The crew
carry rocket-propelled grenades to attack shipping, and shoulder-launched IR
SAMs to protect themselves from air and helicopter attack. Virtually invisible,
these "mosquitos" are a threat only to unarmed merchant shipping, or an
aircraft unlucky enough to pass over the area. These boats are based all along
the Iranian coast, especially at Bandar 'Abbas, and from a variety of offshore
oil platforms.





The North Cape-----------------------------------------------------------------
Introduction

Politics: The North Cape area is shared by four nations. West to east, they
are Norway, Sweden, Finland, and the Soviet Union. Their political orientation
parallel their geographic locations: Norway belongs to NATO, Sweden is a pro-
Western neutral, neutral Finland accomodates the Soviets, and the Soviet Union,
of course, leads the Eastern bloc.
Military Forces: In terms of global politics, the North Cape is the single
most important military region in the Soviet Union. Murmansk is Russia's only
year-round open-sea access to the Atlantic ocean. Russian SSBNs (ballastic
missile nuclear submarines), the heart of nuclear deterrence, sail from here
into the Atlantic and Arctic oceans. The Soviet Northern Fleet protects these
invaluable weapons, as well as maintaining a credible threat to NATO's Atlantic
lifelines.
 Norway fields a large, tough force tailored for a dogged defense of its
mountainous homeland. Reasonably well-equipped, the majority of the forces
guard the populous southern regions. The northern bases have only token
garrisons. Northern Norway seems more important to NATO than it is to the
Norwegians, since important NATO air, naval and marine troop assets are planned
to reinforce this area in time of war.
 Sweden's armed forces are designed to make the Russians (or anyone) think
twice about violating that country's neutrality. The forces are well equipped
and well trained, with a nationwide reserve system that makes a large part of
the citizenry part-time soldiers. However, the northern part of Sweden is
almost unpopulated, so the defenses there are considerably lighter.
 Recently Sweden has been greatly irritated by Russian midget submarines
literally crawling around inside her fleet bases, and by a Russian diesel sub
that ran aground in a harbour entrance while carrying a nuclear-tipped torpedo
(a serious insult to anti-nuclear Sweden). As a result, Sweden may be willing
to support NATO clandestine operations as a form of revenge.
 Finland fields a much smaller and less sophisticated force than its
neighbours. Although fiercly independent, Finland has learned to accomodate the
desires of its powerful neighbour, the Soviet Union. The Soviets maintain this
"friendly" attitude by garrisoning powerful military forces near the Finnish
border, and strongly encouraging Finland to buy Soviet military equipment. So
even if Finland could detect F-19 overflights in its northern regions, it's
unclear whether it would bother informing its "friend" Russia immediately.
 Geography: This entire region is a harshly cold climate. Northern Norway is a
long, mountainous country with a harsh climate and "iron" (rocky) seacoast. In
this terrain a small group of determined defenders could stop an army for
years. The "open" areas of Finland and Sweden are deceptive. On the map it may
appear to be an open plain, perfect for attack. In reality it's a frigid
wilderness in the winter and a vast, marshy bog in the summer.
_______________________________________________________________________________
Level of Conflict
 Cold war: Because of the potential threat posed by the Northern Fleet's ships
and aircraft to the shipping lanes in the Atlantic, NATO and Russian forces are
constantly sparring with each other, testing the other's responses and
jockeying for position should hostilities break out. Officially at peace, the
two sides wage a covert conflict of intelligence gathering and military
posturing that can turn deadly at any instant.
 Limited War: If Russian or American foreign policy was conducted with
greater hostilty, the North Cape would make an ideal place for Western raids of
retaliations against the Soviets. Similarly, their air and sea defences could
get excessively "trigger happy" and shoot before asking questions. Even among
men of good faith, there is always a temptation to send in a secret mission to
"take out" something that really bothers you. Israel and South Africa, for
example, have surrendered to this temptation from time to time.
 Conventional War: The baloon's gone up. NATO and the Warsaw Pact are
officially shooting at each other in this part of Europe (perhaps elsewhere
too). The Northern Fleet is making a sortie into the Atlantic, Soviet troops
have crossed the border into Norway, Mainstays and MiGs are clouding the skies.
Now missions are no joke at all. Getting in and out with your skin intact will
be very, very tricky!
_______________________________________________________________________________
Friendly Bases
 The two Norwegian land bases here are civilian airfields, but both are closer
to the Russian border than the NATO bases at Banak and Bardu. It is easy and
wise to stage stealth missions through either Lakselv or Kautokeino, rather
than flying longer distances from more rearward fields. Such staging could be
just a quick landing and refueling both inbound and outbound. In effect, the
fields can function as grounded refueling tankers.
 Kautokeino (WX11): Located in the barren tundra of the Finnmarksvidda,
Kautokeino airfield is well suited for operations across the top of Finland to
Murmansk. The population is very small and the entire area well defended by
tundra swamps and bogs in the summer, or sub-zero blizzards in the winter.
 Lakselv (WX34): Located at the inland end of the Porsangen Fjord, Lakselv
town has an airfield ideally suited to operations into Russia. It is far enough
from the border to survive the first few days of fighting, but close enough for
easy flying.
CV Kennedy at Sea (WX67): In the middle 1980s the Secretary of the Navy
announced a new policy - a wartime policy of sending aircraft carriers deep
into the Norwegian Sea, to challenge Russia's fleet near its home ports.
Although considered suicidal by some, this policy is certainly useful for
launching stealth missions. Here CV67, one of the conventional carriers with
the US Atlantic Fleet, makes a quick dash to the North Cape to launch your
mission. As always, the carrier is accompanied by a screen of escorts, and is
constantly launching and recovering a CAP of F-18s.
_______________________________________________________________________________
Neutral Bases
 Available neutral bases in this region are all Swedish. Sweden is strictly
neutral in international politics, but economically closely tied to the Western
bloc. Given recent events and aggressive Russian moves, it's not unlikely that
a few clandestine stealth missions, or emergency landings, would be allowed at
northern Swedish airbases.
 Kiruna (WW28): The northernmost airfield in Sweden, this base is located in
the nearly unpopulated foothills of the Esrange mountains. Stealth missions
could operate easily from this area, with nobody but reindeer to observe the
events.
 Gallivare (WW26): Although this airfield is also far north in Sweden,
Gallivare town is a junction of rails and roads. In the summer months it is
also a popular tourist area, with the Muddus National Park a few miles to the
west. Stealth missions operating from this base must be very discreet.
 Lulea (WW13): This fairly populous city is the main Swedish military base in
the Northern Region. It is also a port on the Gulf of Bothnia, the northernmost
arm of the Baltic sea.
_______________________________________________________________________________
The Land of the Midnight Sun
 The North Cape (Nordkapp in Norwegian) is a realm of extremes. In summer the
sun shines throughout the night, while in winter it never rises above the
horizon.
 The most northerly areas are realms of tundra and permafrost - ground that
remains frozen thoughout the year, save for the top few inches in the summer.
Only moss and coarse grass grows here, although it can turn brilliant green on
good summer days.
 The majority of the region is taiga, vast pine forests that are home to
reindeer, artic fox, and rock ptarmigan. The southerly lowlands are a deep
watershed, full of small lakes, marshes and bogs. The White Sea coastline is
almost entirely marsh as the land blends gradually into sea.
 The interior of the Kola Peninsula has the characteristic mountains of a
tundra-taiga borderland: low, rolling, rocky and bare, with pockets of snow
even in summer. The Norwegian coast has more dramatic terrain. Here is the
topmost end of the spine of mountains that divides Norway from Sweden. Even
here they are still steep, bare rock with clinging patches of ice and snow.
 Amid this monotonous, desolute terrain are impressive human works, especially
the city of Murmansk with its sprawling military complexes. Hideously expensive
to build and maintain through the long, deep winter, this region is surely the
most valuable military real estate in the world, judging by money invested per
acre!
_______________________________________________________________________________
Northwestern Russia
 Murmansk (XX11): This major city is Russia's only year-round port on the
Atlantic ocean. Its great piers and depots support not only a steady stream of
merchant shipping, but the powerful Red Banner Northern fleet. Murmansk is
literally "at the end of the line", in this case a long railway line that runs
southward 700 miles to Leningrad.
 Murmansk is also the nerve centre of Russia's powerful airforces, including
both PVO air defence planes and Naval Aviation of the Northern fleet. Satellite
airfields surround the city, including large bases at Kildenstroy (XX10) and
Kilpyaur (XX00). The Northern fleet includes, roughly, one aircraft carrier, 75
other major surface warships, one marine brigade, 133 submarines, and 446 naval
aircraft. The protection of its bases is the duty of 12 Divisions of army
troops (about 300,000 men total) and 150 planes of Tactical Aviation (airforce
planes supporting the army) and the PVO (airforce interceptors guarding the
border).
 The great Severomorsk (XX31) submarine pens are also just outside of Murmansk.
This underground base is the home port for the new Typhoon class of ballistic
missile subs, as well as many other diesel and nuclear undersea craft.
 Pechenga (WX91): This town is Russia's forwardmost military base in the far
north. Just a few miles from the Norwegian border, Pechenga is the inevitably
staging point for any invasion into NATO territory. Although it has an airbase
and strong SAM defenses, the Polyarnyy airbase complex to the east (in WX80) is
somewhat larger.
 Monchegorsk (XW18) & Olenegorsk (XW19): These two towns, near the base of the
Kola peninsula, are major airbases for long-range naval aviation bombers, as
well as providing fighter and SAM cover to the railroad link between Murmansk
and the south.
 Kandalaksha (XW16): This small city is the main population centre at the base
of the Kola peninsula. It is primarily a transportation hub, with rail lines
and a naval port that faces eastward, into the White Sea.
 South of the city lies the Loukhi (XW04) air defense complex, including a
large SAM battery that covers this section of the Murmansk-Leningrad rail line.
 Kem (XW21): South of Kandalaksha, Kem is the next significant city along the
Murmansk-Leningrad line. It too is a small port facing onto the White Sea. It
is also the starting point for the Voknavolok rail line that runs westward to
the Finnish border. This is a purely military line, intended to support the
Russian military presence on the Finnish border.
 Arkhangel'sk (XW71): This city is Russia's largest port on the Atlantic.
Although closed by ice during the winter, it has much better rail and road
connections to the interior of Russia, and is almost totally invulnerable to
enemy attack. In addition to large port facilities, the city is surrounded by
military defenses, the most notable being the complexes at Severodvinsk
(XW51) and Kushkushara (XW84). In addition, units of the Northern Fleet patrol
offshore in the White Sea.
 Secret Bases: Western intelligence operatives in this area have secretly
created two hard-frozen airstrips suitable for landings, one at XW57, the other
at XX20.
_______________________________________________________________________________
Air Defenses
 The Kola peninsula is vital to the Soviet Union because of the access it
affords to NATO's lines of communications, but its very proximity also makes it
particularly vulnerable to NATO counterstrokes. Consequently, the Kola
Peninsula is likely to prove one of the most challenging anti-aircraft
environments in the world today.
 In clandestine missions it may prove impossible to penetrate and escape this
area without eliminating at least one radar system. However, you get lucky -
the systems often shut down for varying periods of time due to maintenance
difficulties in this most rigorous of climates.
 Long Range SAMs: These are area defense weapons that, along with fighters, are
your primary opposition. The older SA-2s and SA-5s have been undergoing
continual upgrade to SA-10 and SA-12 quality. The entire system is enhanced by
the LPAR early warning system at Kirovsk.
 Light SAMs: Soviet ground forces in this area are outfitted with the usual
battlefield SAMs, including the older SA-9 and SA-13 IR missiles, as well as
the newer SA-8 and SA-11 radar guided missiles. Mobile infantry carrying SA-7
and SA-14 shoulder-launched IR SAMs are a significant threat as well. Check out
your intelligence briefing (preflight) for "special event" areas showing the
latest enemy troop concentrations.
_______________________________________________________________________________
The PVO and Naval Aviation
 Fighters: This region is defended partly by the PVO units, with long-range
MiG-25 and MiG-31 interceptors using long-range radar-homing AAMs. Naval
aviation fighters operating from either carriers or land strips include the
Yak-38 V/STOL jet and the new Su-27 multi-purpose fighter. During wartime
shorter-ranged units may arrive, including MiG-29 and SU-27 dogfighters with
short-range IR missiles as well as long-range radar weapons.
 All these planes but the Yak-38 are worthy opponents. The Yak can only carry
IR homing missiles (generally AA-8 Aphids). It is considerably slower and less
flexible than the other fighters.
 Reconnaissance Bombers: Many long-range Tu-95D "Bears" are based in this area,
to keep tabs on NATO naval activity in the North Atlantic. A nuisance in
peacetime, these planes pose a serious threat in a war. Eliminating them is
always a high priority in NATO war plans. That would blind the Russian high
command to activities in the Atlantic and Norwegian seas.
 Transports: Russia possesses numerous air transports for its huge force of
airborne units. The most modern of these is the jet propelled An-72 "Coaler",
which is particularly suited to fast, high priority missions like inserting
commando teams or transporting critical command personnel.
 AEW & C Aircraft: The Soviets routinely deploy Il-76 "Mainstay" aircraft in
this region. The 300+ mile radars on this plane may be your most formidable
enemy. If you're spotted and can't discover how or by whom, chances are it's a
Mainstay.
