                              ACTION FIGHTER

Special Codes:
In the beginning of the game, there is a name entry screen.
Using the steps found on page 7 of your ACTION FIGHTER manual,
enter the desired special code.  You will begin the game with the
features associated with that code.

1: HANG(space)ON.  (the period is part of the code!)
The game will begin with the letters ABC and D already collected.
Your vehicle is a car as described on page 3 of the manual.

2: c SEGA.  (the period is part of the code!)
The game will begin with the player being invincible to enemy
bullets.

3: GP(space)WORLD
The game will begin with the player receiving three extra lives
after the timer has run out.

4: SPECIAL,  (the comma is part of the code!)
The game will begin with the features found in 1 and 2.

5: DOKI(space)PEN
The game will begin with features found in 1, 2, and 3. Your
vehicle also has all the "extra capabilities" found on page 11 of
the manual, these features are usually obtained by docking with
the truck.

Game Strategies:
To collect the power ups (P's), attack the planes flying in
formation.

If you collect enough red flags, one of two cats will appear (one
cat is yellow, one is spotted black and white.  These cats are
just part of the graphics.  They will do nothing for you, so it's
not worth dying trying to get the flags to get the cats.

                                AFTERBURNER

CONTINUE:  You can continue two times.  When it says "Game Over"
on the screen, press the directional pad UP, and then press
BUTTONS 1 and 2 at the same time.  This function cannot be used
after the eighth level.

CONTINUE AFTER EIGHTH LEVEL:  On the title screen, press the
pause button 100 times before the DEMO SCREEN starts, and then
start the game.  This is a very hard code to do, and requires
much practice.  This code will let you continue up to the 17th
round.  You cannot continue beyond on the 18th round.

GAME STRATEGIES
In rounds 1-12, press the LOWER LEFT hand corner of the
directional pad, and you will not die.

DOCKING WITH THE REFUELING SHIP:  When the refueling ship appears
in the center of the screen, level up with it.  Move your
directional pad across the top of the ship, then press down and
both buttons.

FLYING FORTRESS:  To shoot down the Flying Fortress faster, keep
it above your plane, and fire missiles continuously.

                         ALEX KIDD : SHINOBI WORLD

ROUND 1:  KABUTO
Scene 1-1:
Continue right, picking up all the chests.

Scene 1-2:
Proceed right, and kill the two green ninjas.  Climb the stairs,
all the way to the top.  Then, go right and all the way down.  To
the left, there are two walls that are close to each other.  Use
the jumping technique (p. 8 of instruction manual) to get to the
top.  Then, go down and to the right and you will see a bar.
Stand under it and jump while holding up on the Control Pad.
Then, press and hold Button #1 to use your fire magic.  Once at
the top, you will see the exit.

Scene 1-3:  Kabuto
To defeat Kabuto, continuously shoot darts at him until he turns
small.  Then, duck down and shoot him some more!

ROUND 2:  RAID OF HELICOPTERS
Round 2-1:
Continue right, killing all the green and yellow ninjas.  When
you come to a door with a red dot over it, enter.  Follow the
pathway, using the fire magic to the two chests at top.  Then,
head back to the door.  Once out, proceed right to the door, and
follow the passageway to the exit.

Round 2-2:
Move right.  For first time players, it will probably be easier
to stay at the top of the water by jumping on it.  For more
advanced players, try killing all the Barracudas (this does take
a lot of practice).  Then, when you come to two chests, either
continue right or drop down the hole.  If you choose to go right,
follow right until you see a door, and enter it.  If you drop
down the hole, continue right.  On the next screen, the middle
passageway leads to the exit, and the passage on the right leads
to a chest.

SECRET ROOM:
Before exiting, head to the door on the left (the same door you
would have taken if you went right), jump up on the ledge and
head to the right.  There will be a secret room with a chest.

Round 2-3: Heli
Stand on the left hand side of the screen and continuously shoot
until the helicopter pictures at the top of the screen all
disappear.

ROUND 3:  THE JUNGLE
Scene 3-1:
SECRET ROOM #1:
>From the entrance, go right and drop down the hole.  Get the
chest on the left first.  Then, get the one on the right (Ninja's
Crystal Ball) and go up through the hole.

SECRET ROOM #2:
Continue up the ropes until you see an opening on the left hand
side.  Position Alex to the right of the opening, and use your
fire magic into the opening.  A secret screen with three chests
will appear!

In this round, it is easiest to walk on the logs and kill the
birds.  But, be sure to remember which logs fall and which don't!

After all the secret rooms have been found, continue all the way
up to the top, and exit to the right.  Then, when on the next
screen continue all the way to the right to the exit door.

Scene 3-2
SECRET PASSAGE:
When you first start this round, jump on the first ledge and jump
towards the left.  if done correctly, you will land behind the
scene, and can bypass all of the enemies on the ground.  After
you get the two chests, you can go back to the left, back to the
original starting position.  Continue to the right, and the
Bamboo spikes will have disappeared!  Then, after you get the
chest, you can either go back to the beginning, or continue to
the right.

SECRET ROOM:
Continue to the right until you see four fire droplets.  Go past
them, and get on the rope.  Move to the top of the rope and use
the fire magic to the right, and you will be in a secret room.

If you fall down the rope to the next level, jump on the orange
carts and proceed all the way to the right and drop down the
hole.  Wait for the rock to come out of the lava, then jump on
it.  Wait for the rock to drop until it's almost in the lave,
then jump to the next one.  If the next one isn't out of the lave
yet, jump straight up when the rock is almost all the way in the
lava.  If timed correctly, you will land on the rock again,
without getting hit by the lava.  Keep moving all the way to the
right to find the exit.

Scene 3-3:  Robster
Wait for him to jump.  Right after he jumps, jump and shoot him
with the darts.  If you don't have the darts, wait for him to
come down a little, then run and hit him.  Continue these
procedures to defeat him.

ROUND 4:  BATTLE WITH THE DARK NINJA
Scene 4-1
Move all the way to the right.  If you drop down, continue right
and watch out for the spikes overhead.  When you reach the guy on
the ledge, jump and hit him until he dies.  Then, continue right
to the bar.

SECRET ROOM:
Drop down the bar, and duck down while moving to the right.  You
will walk behind the scene, and be in a room with a bar.  Use the
fire magic on the bar, and go to the left.

Once back at the bar, use the fire magic and go up.  The door is
right there.  Once on the other side, jump to the right, killing
the birds (this takes a lot of practice).  If you fall down,
continue all the way to the right.

GETTING THE CHESTS IN THE AIR:
If you manage to stay on the top part (with the logs), you will
come across two chests that seem to be impossible to get.  To get
them, jump to the left of them and you will walk on air!  Then,
continue to the right until you see two more chests in a similar
position.  Do the same thing to get these.

Then, continue right to the exit.

Scene 4-2:
Go right and wait for the arrows to come out.  Then, climb the
stairs and wait for the arrows to come out again and drop down.
Enter the door, and you will be faced with Kabuto.  To beat him,
hit him four times, while avoiding his fireballs.  Then, when he
turns small, duck and hit him three more times.  Continue right
and enter the door.  Proceed right and wait for the block to get
almost all the way up.  Then, jump to the right, get the chests
and wait for the block to go almost all the way up again.  Enter
the door and you will be faced with Robster.  To defeat Robster,
wait for him to jump, run underneath him and hit him.  Repeat
this until he is defeated.  Enter the door and you will be in a
room with blue pyramids floating in the air.  Jump over them and
wait for the red ledge to appear on the far right.  When it
appears, jump up on it and follow the red ledges that appear.
When the ledge appears in the upper right hand corner, next to
the door, jump to it to exit.

Scene 4-3:  Hanzo
The first guy you face is the Glowing Ninja.  To defeat him,
perfect timing is necessary.  When he jumps, get so you are
almost touching him, then wait approximately three seconds, and
stab him.  Repeat this four times.  Then, once he is defeated, he
will turn into Tornado Ninja.  To defeat him, stand in the same
place, waiting for him to come to you.  When he comes to you,
stab him and he will back off.  Repeat this until he is defeated.
Once he is defeated, he will turn into Jumping Ninja.  When he
jumps, he will leave a white shadow, so kill it, then jump in his
direction and hit him.

                          ALEX KIDD :  LOST STARS

Rounds 1 & 8:  Toy world
If you walk on the ground (instead of using the trolley line),
you will save time and life.  Try to keep the Jump Star as it
will help you get through the round!
TO GET PAST THE GIANT TEDDY BEAR:  Time your jumps on the spring
blocks to avoid the notes.

Rounds 2 & 9:  Machine world
Be careful in timing your jumps, one wrong jump, and you could
die.
TO GET PAST THE ELECTRICITY BARS:  Study their pattern, then jump
when they are turned off.

Rounds 3 & 10:  World of Make Believe
Try to stay on top of the pods, it saves life and time.
TO GET PAST THE JUMPING FACES: try to have the Jump Star and when
they land, jump over them.

Rounds 4 & 11:  Water World
Use the Cloud shots sparingly in these rounds, because the
special star "S" seldom shows up.  Try to stay at the top or
bottom of the screen because most of the enemies are in the
middle.
TO GET PAST THE JELLYFISH:  Stay at the top of the screen and try
to avoid them.

Rounds 5 & 12:  Monster World
Just before the cave, when you are on the floating blocks, let
them carry you to the top.  Then, jump from them to the top of
the cave.
TO GET PAST THE VOLCANO:  Run and jump over it.

Rounds 6 & 13:  Giant's Body
Timing is everything in this round!

Rounds 7 & 14:  The Shrine of Jiggarat
Avoid the enemies, instead of shooting them.  Keep in mind that
you can jump longer and higher now.
TO GET PAST JIGGARAT:  When you see Jiggarat, immediately run
past him.  If you try to fight him, you will be most likely be
unsuccessful!

MISCELLANEOUS TIPS:
While the graphics are identical in the repeated rounds, the game
play is not.  The special Stars and special items found in the
first seven rounds may show up in different places-or not at all
the second time around.  Also, there will be more enemies that
you will need to get by.  Therefore, you will need to be more
cautious in rounds eight through fourteen and conserve your life
meter.

The game has a continue feature that can be used throughout the
entire game.  Those of you looking for a little more challenge
might try limiting yourselves to three continues!

                                    ALF

GET ALL THE ITEMS:
Go to the left, to the kitchen.  Get the SALAMI FIRST, then jump
up and get the cat.  Then, continue left to the next screen with
three doors in it.  Enter the first door, and you will be in the
childrens bedroom.  Once in here, press the PAUSE BUTTON, then
hold the UPPER LEFT corner on Control Pad #1, and press BOTH
BUTTONS.

NOTE:  In order to get the space suit, you will need to sell the
pearl.


HELPFUL HINTS:
When in the kitchen, jump up and get the CAT.  Open the
refrigerator (press Button #2) and get the SALAMI.  Proceed to
the left to the hallway with three doors.  Open the middle door
and proceed down the stairs.  Release the cat and he will kill
the rat.  Jump and turn the light on and proceed left to the
cave.

While going through the cave, beware of rats on the floor and
stay on the top as much as possible.  Use the Salami to ward off
the bats.  Hit them when they are at elbow height.  At the end of
the cave there is a shack containing a GOLD NUGGET worth $50.00.

Work your way out of the cave and go to the street.  Beware of
the Alien Task Force and the bicycle riders.  Notice that only
one Alien Task Force member can appear on the screen at a time.
Therefore, the best technique for walking the street, is to stay
on the sidewalk and allow the Task Force member to follow you
closely.
Proceed to the general store and buy a KEY for $50.00.

Return to the house with the key and open the closets.  One
closet contains a killer bug and the other contains a SWIMSUIT.
Be careful because the objects are not always in the same place.
Now go to the living room and go through the door on the right.
This door will lead to the lake.

Jump into the lake and proceed down to the bottom.  The water is
treacherous; try alternating sides while swimming down to avoid
the Frogmen floating about.  On the way down you will find a
TREASURE CHEST with $100.00.  At the bottom, you will find a
GIANT OYSTER. When the oyster's mouth is open, get the PEARL.

Proceed back up to the surface and return to the store.  Sell the
PEARL for $200.00 and buy the LADDER (in the General Store) and
LANTERN (in the Five & Dime).  Return to the cave.  Go through
the cave, it will be about twice the length as the first time.
At the end will be a shack with the FUEL.

Again, work your way out of the cave to the beginning screen.
Climb the Trellis to the SCOOTER and press button #1 to
accelerate up into the sky.  Proceed up through the various
atmospheres, while avoiding the planes, until the spaceport
appears.  Accelerate the scooter to the top of the screen and
release button #1.  A shop will appear where the SPACESUIT can be
purchased for $100.00.

Continue up through outer space until the moon appears.  When the
moon appears, avoid the green things and space ships and when his
mouth opens, jump in it to receive the REPAIR KIT.

additional 500 points.

ROUND 1: CALLIOPE - SQUIME BOSS
Using the fireball, aim for the red area below the creatures

right portion of the screen, shoot diagonally up from the lower
corner, while avoiding the fireballs he spits at you.

ROUND 2: CLIO - AARGH BOSS
Shoot at him when the back portion of his body is straight.
Using the fireball take out the two gold spiralling objects
first. Then, stay at the bottom of the screen and shoot up at the
creature.

ROUND 3: ERATO - TACAPY BOSS
Using the fireball, aim for the eyes and the worms that come from
them.  You can move faster than he can, so use that to your
advantage.

ROUND 4: EUTERPE - MASHER BOSS

released.  Shoot when his front legs are open.  Try moving along
the outer perimeter of the screen continuously firing.  He spits
in sets of three, so watch out!

ROUND 5: MELPOMENE - HAGGAH BOSS
Using the fireball, aim for the spot right below his mouth.  Keep
firing from the bottom center of the screen.  Avoid the fire that
comes from his mouth and the three balls that come from the left
side of his head.

ROUND 6: THALIA - MINOSAR BOSS
Using the fireball, aim for the green face.  The best place to
stand is either in the upper or lower right corners.  He will
shoot three balls at you for a while and then he will spit at
you.

ROUND 7: URANIA - MR. MIMI
Using the fireball, shoot at his mouth when it's open.  Avoid the
spiraling objects coming from his mouth and the balls that come
from his ears.

Extra Hints:
Throughout the ships there are green faces on the floors.  Shoot
the faces until they become white, then they will be safe to walk
on.

In Round 3, watch out for the holes in the floor and be careful
going along the catwalks.  Try to remember where the fireball
appears before entering the bosses room.  If you have the
fireball, when going against the bosses, it will help out
greatly.

                               ASTRO WARRIOR


GET YOUR OPTIONS:
When the screen says, Galaxy Zone, Asteroid Zone, or Nebula Zone,
rapidly alternate BUTTONS 1 and 2.  This will allow you to start
with the two red companions.  This must be done just right to
make it work.  Keep practicing.

GAME STRATEGIES:
Shoot at everything.  You will notice there will be ships coming
straight down the center of the screen that you cannot destroy.
These are weapon supply ships. If you fly over them, they will
increase your firepower or speed.  You will also notice sometimes
little purple spheres that you also cannot destroy.  If you fly
over these, they will join your ship in fighting against the
powers of evil.  These helpers will not die until you do.

When attacking the Mother Ship, you must attack and destroy the
outer defenses first. There is a time limit of about 45 seconds
to destroy the Mother Ship.  If you don't destroy it in that
amount of time, the ship will dive at you until you are
destroyed.

On the title screen, when the scroll containing the words "Aztec
Adventure" is closed, press the Directional Pad UP five times.
Then, when Nino throws money to the other characters, press the
Directional Pad to the RIGHT, three times.  Then, when Nino walks
to the left, and is followed by the other characters (so everyone

once, and DOWN once.  If this procedure is done correctly, a mini
version of Nino's face will appear next to the Aztec Adventure
scroll.  Below Nino is a square containing two numbers, choose
your rounds by moving your Directional Pad.  As soon as you do
so, you will advance to the round selected.

SOUND TEST:
Press the START button.  You will then see a screen with a
rainbow and names, as well as faces of the characters in the
game.  Here is where you will access the sound test.  When the
faces are on the screen, press the Directional Pad to the LEFT
once, and twenty times to the RIGHT.  Be sure you do this
accurately, because if you don't do it just right, it will not
work.  When done correctly, a mini version of Nino's face will
appear on the screen to the right of the Rainbow.  Above Nino's
head is a square with numbers in it. To listen to the music,
choose a number from 1-7, and then press BUTTON #1.  To exit,
choose 00, and press BUTTON #2.

Push BUTTON #1 to begin the game.  The red screen showing the
number of players you have will appear.  On this screen, press
and hold BUTTON #1, until a blank screen appears. On this screen,
press and hold down the RESET BUTTON until you see Riki appear in

Seventh Level:
After you defeat Wang and the princess is saved, but before the

ONE  and TWO, and you will enter the secret seventh level.

DEFEATING THE BOSSES:

RYU:
Jump and land on him while using repeated punches to the face and
the body.  Do not attempt to high jump.

HAWK:
Avoid the stars he throws, and kick repeatedly in the face until
he dies.

GONTA:
Wait until he attacks, then make a high jump to the right.  Then,
force him into a corner with kicks to the face.  Don't kick him
while he is in the air, because he will sit on you if you do.

CHAPTER IV:
To defeat the red character with the whip, use repeated jump
kicks to the head.  Avoid letting him hit you with his whip as
you will be unable to get away.

ONI:
Back up against the left wall and kick him every time he punches
you.  It may look as if he will beat you because he gets in the
first hit but he won't so keep at it.

RITA:
The only way to defeat Rita, is to kick in the air while she is
descending at an angle towards you.  When you kick her in the
air, she will stay suspended above the floor for a few seconds.
Then, punch her (you should be able to get in five or six punches
before she returns to the ground).  You will need to repeat this
process several times before you defeat her.

WANG:
Right after you kill Rita, the screen will change and you will be
attacked by Wang.  Get in the left corner and squat down.  He
will jump in the air and land on top of you.  Punch until his
power meter goes down as far as it can.  Then, stand up and give
him one more punch to the face.

NOTE:  THE RED FLYING SIGNS WILL RENDER YOU INVINCIBLE FOR TEN
HITS.  THE FLYING SUSHI IS AN ENERGY BOOSTER, USE THE SUPER JUMP
TO CATCH IT.

ROUND SELECT:
On the Title Screen, using Control Pad 2, press and hold the
UPPER LEFT corner of the Directional Pad, and BOTH BUTTONS.  On
Control Pad 1, press BUTTON 1 or 2 twice.  After completing this
procedure, you will be able to select missions 1-5.

ROUND SELECT (alternative - not tested):
A bit like the above but only use paddle 2 and press Up+Left+A+B at the
same time, start the game as normal.

ROUND ONE:
Shoot as quickly as possible, staying in the center of the ship.
If you do not have a powerful gun, use the Cluster Bombs.

ROUND TWO:
Once you defeat the first tank, there is a second small tank.
Use your Cluster Bombs.

ROUND THREE:
Guns on the small ships are not flexible.  You can avoid them
without killing the whole ship.

Shoot the big bomber in the center.

ROUND FOUR:
Use the Cluster Bombs at the two main bosses.

ROUND FIVE:
The main boss is in the Aircraft Carrier, just keep shooting.
Make sure you have several power ups.

TIPS ON THE GAME:
You cannot continue until you have passed the first round.  That
is where the big battleship is.

Make sure you pick up all the power you can.  The more power you
pick up, the fewer shots it will take to destroy an enemy.

Don't pick up too much speed.  You do not want to pick up anymore
thAn 5, because your plane will be too hard to control.

The best formation to use is number 3, except when you get to
round four.  In that round you will want to use either the
Sideways Shots or the shots that shoot down and diagonally.

Cluster Bombs are more effective if you have more than one plane
flying with you.

The Phoenix is the most powerful weapon you can pick up, not even
bullets can penetrate it.

Game Hints:
Any items you pick up, like bombs, psycho power, and life power,
will reappear when you enter and leave an elevator.  So when you
are low on power, go back to area A, go in the first elevator in
the middle of the area that leads to levels 2 & 3.  On level 2,
you'll find psycho power to the right of the elevator.  On level
3, life power is to the left.  You can continuously enter and
exit the elevator (you don't have to change floors), grabbing the
power-ups until you're at full strength.  You'll have no problem
beating the game this way.

In Area C, you can use the Ray Gun, but not on the boss creature.

In Area C, the light gun acts like a Flare Gun (Lights up the
area).

Jet Pack:
Use the Jet Pack to fly across the top of the levels.  This way,
you can skip the un-important creatures, and save your energy for
the boss creatures.

The number of main guys left in the game appears on the screen in
white numbers.

ROUND 1: RESCUE LITTLE CINDY!
Walk to the right, while ducking and shooting the enemies.

BOSS 1: Stand up, so he'll shoot fire at you.  Then, when he's
shooting fire, duck down and hit him.  Do this until he starts
spinning.  Once he does, jump over him and continue this
procedure.  He takes 11 shots to destroy.

Continue to the right, shooting the guys above and to the right.

BOSS 2: Jump and time your shot so that you hit your enemy in the
head but miss the girl.  You can duck under the boomerang.  He
takes 6 shots to destroy.

ROUND 2: ENTER THE ENEMY ZONE!
Go right, shooting all the enemies.

BOSS 1: Stand up and shoot.  Once you shoot, duck down and avoid
this fire (sometimes, he will shoot low).  If you can save the
special weapon and use it to beat this guy quickly.  After you
beat him continue to the right.  If you fall of the edge you will
die so be careful.

BOSS 2: Pick up the special weapon from the previous part, and
use it on him.  When he gets close, jump over him.   Move to the
other side of the screen then shoot at him again.

ROUND 3: PERIL AT PIER 36!
When you reach the cars go quickly to the right.  Do not stop to
shoot the Air bikes and they will not hit you.  Continue to the
right past the ship and you will face several ninja's.  Stop only
to shoot at them as you continue to the right.

BOSS 1: Use your special weapon on it to take out the majority of
things firing at you.  Once you have done that continue to hit
him until he explodes.

Take the next part very slowly.  Alot of stuff will come at you
at once.  Keep an eye out for the gun turrets in the ground, they
will pop out and shoot at you.

BOSS 2: Use your special weapon on him.  Other wise, shoot and
then jump over him.

ROUND 4: UNFRIENDLY CONFINES!
Look out for the things above you.  They will shoot at you, it's
a good idea to take these out as soon as you can.

BOSS 1: Shoot at the head, use your special weapon.  Don't use
all of your special weapon because you'll have a hard time
defeating the second boss if you do.  Each head takes 10 to 15
shots to defeat.

Walk to the right taking out everything in your path.  There will
be plenty of Ninja's and air enemies.

BOSS 2: Shoot at the guy until he gets close to you.  Then jump
over him and continue the process.  After you've hit him with
about 8 shots he will turn into a green jumping guy.  You'll need
to keep shooting, while avoiding his missiles, until he dies.
There are two of these bosses to defeat.

ROUND 5: (FINAL ROUND)
Walk to the right taking out all of the enemies in your path.

BOSS 1: Use the special weapon on this boss right at the
beginning of the fight.  Then take out everything that is
shooting at you.

BOSS 2: Take out the green balls first with regular shots.  Then
the final boss will appear.  The final boss will have a shield
around him, to take out the shield use your special weapon.  Once
the shield is gone shoot him while standing then when he shoots
duck, then stand and shoot again (continue this until you defeat
the boss).

@NODE GHHOU

                                GHOST HOUSE

THE FOLLOWING IS THE FORMULA FOR KILLING THE DRACULA'S:

Round 1: Punch him 5 times or stab 3 times.

Round 2: Punch him 7 times or stab him 5 times.

Round 3: Punch him 9 times or stab him 7 times.

Round 4: Punch him 11 times or stab him 9 times.

Round 5: Punch him 13 times or stab him 11 times.

Round 6: Punch him 15 times or stab him 13 times.

NOTE:  If you use the formula and Dracula comes back to life, you
have punched or stabbed him too many times.

After you have killed all the Dracula's in the round, look for a
glowing fireplace.  Stand in front of it with Mickey facing
towards the wall.  This will allow you to go to the next round.

KILLING DRACULA:
On Round 1, there are five Dracula's to be killed.  Each one has
a jewel hidden in his coffin.  In order to open the coffin, find
a key by killing the various monsters.  Once a key is used, find
another one to open the next coffin.

FREEZE THE ACTION:
At various places in the corridors, there are overhead lamps that
can be touched by Mickey's head.  When he jumps up and hits the
lamp, it will cause all the monsters and Dracula to "freeze" for
about four seconds.  Since Dracula can only be destroyed in human
form, it is best to "freeze" the action when he is in bat form
flying through the corridor.  Then, maneuver close to him and
begin your attack after the flashing ends.

GETTING THE KNIVES:
If you jump up and hit the candles on the walls, a knife will
come out.

EXTRA POINTS/POWER BOOSTER:
Located throughout the mansion are small red and gold glowing
question boxes.  These boxes will boost your energy and give you
extra points when you run over them.

RECOMMENDED TOOLS:       Ghost Bait                    $400
                         High capacity trap            $2,500

                         Super ghost vacuum            $3,200

ROUND ONE:
Once you have finished your shopping, the next screen  you will
encounter is the map screen.  There are three main points of
interest on this screen; Zule, the Shop, and GHQ.  Locate those
places on the map and remember where they are.  It is necessary
to return to GHQ to restore slimmed men to duty, to empty traps,
to restore the Ion beam and to obtain "extra" men.

Stay away from the Gatekeeper and the Master of the Key, they
take money from your account.  When a building starts to flash,
go to the side and press towards the building while pushing
Button #1.  This will allow you to enter the street.  Avoid the
obstacles and trap the ghosts.  The number on the bottom corner
of the screen is the distance from the building.  The lower the
number gets the closer you are to the building.  Once at the
building, you will see your guys.  Use the Anion beam to trap the
ghosts.

ROUND TWO:
After the city's energy reaches maximum, and you have $10,000 in
your account, you will be sucked into Zule, where you have to get
past the MARSHMALLOW MAN.  To get past him, you need to get your
character over on the right side of him and sneak him past when
he moves to the left.  You need to sneak two of them past him.

ROUND THREE:
The roamers are pretty easy to beat.  Watch out for the slimmers,
you must anticipate their moves.  If they look like they are
going to attack, shoot.

ROUND FOUR: GORZA
The best way to fight Gorza is to stay on the opposite side of
the creature and to continue firing as you cross over.  It takes
5 to 6 shots to kill him.

Helpful Hints:
The game is easier if you use two Control Pads.  To play with two
Control Pads, press and hold right on Control Pad #2, and press
Button #2 twice.  Playing with two Control Pads is very difficult
at first, but once you get used to it, it will boost your scores
greatly!

Offensive Halves:
Stay about in the middle of the screen, only moving to pick up
the "P's" and avoid the enemies coming at you.

Defensive Halves:
Shoot as many of the missiles that you can when they are little
blue dots in the background.  The more you shoot there, the less
you have to fend off.  They are harder to hit once they are white
arrows.

When on the hidden planet, concentrate on surviving when you have
the yellow "P".  There is only 1 in this round!

MISCELLANEOUS HINTS:
Day 1:  The Forest
Kill all of the creatures until you see a ledge.  Jump up on that
ledge, and wait for the Amazonian Warrior on the Sweep Dragon to
hop up on the ledge.  Then, hit her, and get on the Dragon.  Use
the dragon to defeat the two guys.  Then, go to the right and hit
the dwarf to get a Magic Power bag.  Then, jump down from the
ledge, and hit the other dwarf several times.  Continue to the
right until you get to the two green Hammer Giants.  Fight these
guys one at a time and don't let them get on both sides of you.
The run and Shoulder block works well on these guys.

Day 2:  Proceeding to Turtle Island
Move to the right and fall down off the ledge to the next level.
Be careful, because if you fall off towards the bottom of the
screen, you will die.  Then, stand right in front of the ledge
and continue to swing your sword.  You will hit the guy above
you.  Continue to the right and shoulder block the Amazonian
Warrior on the Fire Dragon.  Then, use the fire creature on all
the remaining guys.  There is no real boss on this round, only a
Skeleton and an Amazonian Warrior

Day 3:  Leaving Turtle Island
When you see the Amazonian Warrior on the Fire Dragon, knock her
off.  This dragon is very hard to use, so it is best to let her
get back on and knock her off until the Dragon runs away.
Continue right until you reach a hole in the ledge.

Getting over the ledge:
Getting over this ledge takes a lot of practice.  In order to get
over it, run and at the last second, jump.  You will land on the
other side of the hole and be faced with two green Hammer Giants.

Killing the Hammer Giants, made easy:
Get up on the ledge that you landed on, and wait for one of the
Giants to jump up with you.  Move to the right, so that he is on
your left.  Then, either run and shoulder block him, or hit him.
If done correctly, he will fall off the ledge and die!  Be
careful though, because they can do the same to you!

After you have killed them, there will be two dwarves, so be
ready for them to stock up on the Magic Power bags.  Continue to
the right, and you will be faced with an Armored Knight and an
Amazonian Warrior.  To kill the Armored Knight, run and do
shoulder blocks into him (he is almost defenseless against them).
If you try to attack him with your sword, he will kill you.

Day 4:  Proceeding to Eagle Island
Move to the right and jump up on the ledge.  Stand there and
constantly swing your sword.  They guys on the left will jump up
and you will hit them every time.  They take a little longer to
kill this way, but they will not be able to harm you!  Once
you've killed the three guys, continue to the right and you will
be faced with two Skeleton Soldiers.  Try to get them on the
lower ledge.  Wait for them to jump up.   When they jump up, run
and do a shoulder block to knock them down again.  Repeat this
until they are dead.  Continue to the right and fight the three
guys (2 Skeleton Warriors, and 1 Club Swinging Attacker).  These
guys are very difficult, so try to take them one at a time.  When
you hit one, move so you don't get boxed in by the other ones.
There are two sets of these to defeat.

Day 5:  To the Temple Balcony
Use the jumping and slashing technique on the two Skeleton
Warriors at the beginning.  Then, continue to the right and you
will fight 2 sets of 2 Club Swinging Attackers.  After defeating
them, there will be two Armored Knights.  To defeat them, run and
do a shoulder block.  When they start hitting you, change to the
jumping and slashing technique.  After them, you will be able to
receive Magic Power bags.  Then, you will be faced with a green
Hammer Giant and Club Swinging Attacker.  Use the jumping attack
on both of these guys.  After them, you will be faced with 2
Skeleton Warriors.  Use the jumping attack on these guys also.
Then, the final confrontation with one Skeleton Warrior and Death
Adder.

BEATING DEATH ADDER:
Right when you come on the screen, the Skeleton Warrior will
appear.  Death Adder is not on the screen yet, so take advantage
of this time.  Get in as many hits on the Warrior as possible.
Then, when Death Adder comes on the screen, start moving around
the screen.  When you come close to him, hit him, then move.
Continue this procedure until he dies.

MISCELLANEOUS HINTS:
When on the Dragons, hit and move.  This way, you won't get boxed
in.  When faced with two enemies, hit one at the top of the screen,
then move to the bottom of the screen and hit the other one.
Then, alternate between the two.

When faced with three enemies continually hit one, then move.
This will make it so you don't get boxed in.  When you get a
chance to attack an enemy more than once (there is only one enemy
standing), hit it until the other enemies get up and come after
you.

When you knock down an enemy, run and do a shoulder block.  If
you time it just right, you will hit it right as it gets up, and
it won't be able to harm you.

There are places that you can throw or hit an enemy off a ledge!

Move to the right slowly when you see the Go! arrow. Sometimes
instead of facing two or three enemies at once, you can take on
one or two!

need all seven crystals, the green and purple meas, all eighteen
life potions, the pendants, swords, and shields.  To destroy him,
keep running around him so he follows you, while hitting him with
your sword.


MISCELLANEOUS HINTS:
If you hold the attack button longer, you will do more damage to
the enemy you are attaking.  For example, if you are fighting a
character that will take four sword stabs to defeat normally, it
would only take 2 extra long sword stabs to beat it.

When your Life is low, learn the screen before you enter (go back
and forth between screens).  That way, you will be able to get
through the screen without having many monsters appear.

@NODE GRGOLF

                                GREAT GOLF

TO PUTT:
Look at the flag, there's a person standing right next to the
dots on the flag pole.  Count the number of dots from the
person's head up (3 or 4), then use that number to gauge the
number on the power grid.  EG:  If there are three points above
the person's head, use a power of three on the power grid!

When you land on the green, the game says "nice shot".

Hole 6:  Use between a 5 or a 7 iron to chip to the islands.  To
get to the last island, use a 3 or lower iron, and aim for the
sand trap.

                                JOE MONTANA

DEFENSE:
The computer mainly passes and your front line can pick up
running plays, so concentrate on pass defenses

To tackle, run into the player you want to tackle, and you will
automatically tackle them.

PASS DEFENSE:
When you determine what receiver is going to get the ball, press
button #1 to get your closest player right on him, and then press
toward the receiver to tackle him!

To intercept, get your player between the ball and the receiver
and as the ball gets to you, push the Directional Pad towards the
line of scrimmage.  With a little bit of practice, you will be
able to perfect intercepting!

OFFENSE:
RUNNING PLAYS:
When choosing a running play, the running back will have a
marker, and you should look for it.  Make sure he is reasonable
close to you before you pitch it.  Once he's got the ball, follow
your blockers for the maximum yardage!

PASS PLAYS:
Choose the receiver quickly, and throw to him as quickly as
possible, or else, you'll get sacked before you get a chance to
throw!

KICK-OFF'S:
When kicking off, wait until your players get close to the ball
carrier, then press the Directional Pad towards him, and press
button #1.

PREPARING TO FIGHT:
This game offers training sessions (Rounds 5, 6, 8, etc.).  Use
these sessions before you begin to battle the levels.  If you are
able to get through these, you will not only be ready to fight
the Warlocks, but you'll receive a lot of energy, and possibly an
additional life!

HIDDEN ITEMS:
To enter the secret room in the round 2, make your way to the
room with the Buddha. Jump up to his head, and press up and then
jump.  In this room, you will find a Gourd of Life.  Once
received, exit the room, and proceed left.  When on the Balcony,
use the red steps towards the left.  Keep moving left to another
balcony, enter the door here, and proceed as before to the
Buddah's room.  Here too, there is a secret room containing a
Gourd of Life.

corner platform, and you will find Kokeshi (a Wooden Doll) on the
platform.  She will give you one additional life.

you, and move to the right side of the screen.

When it is destroyed, you will receive the High Jump technique.

Benkei:
Move your character to about the middle of the word "power", on
the top of the screen, kneel down and use sword attacks to his
knees 9-10 times.  He carries a club, so watch out!!

When he is destroyed, you will receive the Helmet Splitting Sword
(with this sword, you can use it without jumping).

Larva Fly:
When she flies, stay in the left corner.  Kneel down and use the
Helmet Splitting Sword towards the tail area 9-11 times.

When it is destroyed, you will receive the second Helmet
Splitting Sword.

Two Headed Creature:
Use the Helmet Splitting Sword, and attack the lower head first.
It takes 6-7 shots to kill the first head.  After that is
destroyed, use jumping attacks with the Helmet Splitting Sword to
finish it off.  It takes 7-8 hits to kill the second head.

When it is destroyed, you will receive the Air-Cutting Sword
(will let you walk and swing the sword).

Putrid Eye:
Jump and use the Helmet Splitting Sword at the center of the Eye
6-8 times, while avoiding the Acid Tears.

When it is destroyed, you will receive the Wild Wheel Sword.

Death Head:
Use the Wild Wheel Sword and attack 15-16 times, while in the
large form.  Try to stay on the other side of the screen, when he
changes to the Swarm.

When it is destroyed, you will receive the Sword of the Dragon.

YONENSAI, THE MASTER - THREE STAGES:
A.  When you enter the castle, go up staircase number four.  When
    you are at the top of the stairs, there is a Warlock,
    throwing Fire Balls.  Use the Helmet Splitting Sword to slash
    downward toward the Fire Balls.  There are about 5 to 6 sets of
    Fire Balls.  Once they are all taken care of, the Warlock will
    vanish.  They take about 6-7 shots each.

B.  Next is the Warlock in Armor.  Hit him in the head 6-7 times,
    using the Helmet Splitting Sword.  Jump up and slash down at
    his face.  Hit him enough times, and his face will turn into
    a skull.  If it doesn't turn into a Skull, his meter will not
    go down.  Watch out for the falling rocks.  This time, when
    you have beaten him, his face will change to a blue color.

C.  The Final Battle!  When he has changed to a Skull face, use
    the Helmet Splitting Sword, 10-12 times, to his face.  This guy's
    meter will start to go down right away (the two prior stages,
    his meter didn't move).  When defeated, he will blow up.

                             MIRACLE WARRIORS

You begin the game at the castle of Arasia, on the continent of
Arukas.  In order to collect your three companions, you must
visit the ancient Sage Kosama.  He is located on the continent of
Arukas, above the mountains, in the Austel Providence.  He will
let you begin your quest.

COMPANION ONE: GUY
Guy is your first companion.  To awaken him you will need the
SWORD OF WARRIOR.  This is found in the forest, south of the city
of Orcho, on the continent of Marula, in a hidden castle.  You
will also need the spell "AWAKE GIANT".  This is also found on
the continent of Marula.  If you head to the south-west corner of
the Baton providence, you will find a city that is not on the
map.  It is here that you will buy the Spell and get your first
companion.

NOTE:  Buy the spell (Awake Giant) in the shop that sells
Healings, Spells and Herbs.

SPECIAL WEAPONS:
Guy's special weapons are located on two continents, Marula and
Apheidas.

The TUROS SWORD is located in a castle, in the mountains,
surrounded by the forest, to the left of the Dirke providence.

The ARMOR OF TITAN is located on the peninsula of Kadmos, off the
continent of Marula, in the mountains.

While on the peninsula of Kadmos, go to the village, and you will
be able to purchase the first ship for $30,000.

NOTE:  This ship will NOT cross the Stormy Seas.

The SHIELD OF HECTOR is located on the continent of Apheidas.  It
is in the forest, in the Idmon desert.

COMPANION TWO: MEDI
Medi is your second companion.  She is located on the continent
of Eratos in the city of Doris.  To get Medi you must have the
ARMOR OF LEGEND, which is located in a cave in the mountains, on
the continent of Apheidas.

SPECIAL WEAPONS:
Medi's special weapons are located on the continents of Eratos
and Arukas.

The EROS SWORD is located in the castle of Elatoria, on the west
side of Eratos.


The ARMOR OF ATHENA is located in a cave that is in the forest,
next to the mountains, on the continent of Eratos.

The SHIELD OF CELENE is located in the mountains, to the left of
the city of Galia, on the continent of Arukas.

COMPANION THREE: TREO
Treo is your third companion.  He is located on the island in the
middle of the peninsula of Iphis.  To get Treo, you must have the
SHIELD OF ULYSSES, which is located on the island of Ikaros.

SPECIAL WEAPONS:
The HALBERD OF BABEL, ARMOR OF KASO, and SHIELD OF KIMAIRA are
all located in the monument on the northern tip of Iphis.

NOTE:  To get into this monument, use the spell "TREO HAS COME".
In order to use the spells, when the spell screen comes up, pull
down on the Directional Pad until the arrow on the left is next
to the correct spell.

Now that you have Treo, your party is complete.  You should have
all of their weapons and spells by now.  From here, venture to
the island above the Gorphonos desert, on the continent of
Apheidas. This is where you will get the ship that will cross the
Stormy Seas.

>From here, venture South and sail through the Stormy Seas, to the
continent of Areos.  This is the continent where you will find
the keys needed to enter the Gorkis shrine.

THE KEYS:
The keys are hidden in three secret shrines on the continent of
Areas.  To find them start from the town of Tegea.  Move 16
spaces South, press BUTTON TWO, and use the spell "COME, IASON"
NOTE:  This procedure will be the same for all keys.
Proceed through the maze and you will find the KEY TO HEAVEN.
>From there, move 16 spaces West, and enter the shrine to find the
KEY TO EARTH.  From there, move 10 spaces North, enter the
shrine, and you will find the KEY TO HELL.  Finally, move 6
spaces West, and you will enter the GORKIS SHRINE.  Proceed
through this three level shrine with care, because if you take a
wrong door, you will end up in a different shrine, in a different
area, and you will have to find the Gorkis Shrine again. If you
make it through the shrine, you will find the stairs that lead to
TERRARIN, THE DARK LORD.

TERRARIN, THE DARK LORD:
To defeat Terrarin, you will need to be at full power, and have
the following items:

THE WHITE SPHERE:
This is found in the middle of the Kithairon Desert, in a
village.

THE STAFF OF EARTHQUAKES:
This is found South of Eratos, on the island of Karme.

THE SACRED NUTS:
You will get the nuts by killing the Liphants, in the forests, on
the continent of Marula.

RESURRECTION POTIONS:
To get these, you will need to kill the Sea Dragons, off the
coast of Areos.

To fight Terrarin, use your magical items first, then attack
until your power bar is almost gone.  Then, use the Resurrection
Potion, and continue to fight.  Use the Potion only when the need
is dire.

OTHER ITEMS OF INTEREST:
The VILLAGE OF RESTORATION is located in the mountains,
surrounded by a forest, above the Penteus providence.

The MANTLE and CRYSTAL are located in a monument, in the Silvius
desert, on the continent of Eratos.

The HELM is located in a monument, in the Julus forest, on the
continent of Marula.

The STONE OF PROTECTION is located in a village, on the eastern
tip of the Iphis peninsula.

ADDITIONAL HINTS:

They have a lot of money, and are easy to kill.

DO NOT attack the Villagers, Travelers or White Monks, talk to
them, and they will help you with your quest.

Return to the villages frequently to replenish your strength.

Save the game often.

go left and continue to find a blue and red key, plus 2 white
keys (which you should have gotten in the beginning).  Once you
fine one blue and red key the proceed back to the area with the 2
spiders.  From that screen advance 2 screens right, go up one
screen and 2 screens right.  You should now be in a screen that
has a giant gap.  Run and jump from the middle of the floor (not
from the edge) and you'll land one screen down on the right side
of the screen.

                                   NINJA

EXTRA MEN:
The first screen in Level one has a round tree on the right
portion of the screen.  Kill the first Ninja you come upon.  Then
get as close as you can to the tree.  Shoot the tree for about 15
minutes (the Genesis Arcade Power Stick helps greatly).  Then go
on to play the level.  If you achieve 0% at the bottom right of
your score screen, you'll receive 10 extra men and thousands of
points.  NOTE:  This is very difficult, so if it doesn't work,
keep trying.

SCROLLS:
Blue Scrolls:  Enable you to move faster.
Red scrolls:  Give you stars and weapons.

FINDING THE SCROLLS:
FIRST SCROLL:  Located on screen #1.  Kill the transforming
Ninja.

SECOND SCROLL:  Located on screen #4.  Shoot the Dog Statue on
the far left, 5 times.

THIRD SCROLL:  Located on screen #6.  Go to the first Samurai
House surrounded by a Moat, on the left hand side of the screen.

corner (to the left of the bush) of the house.

FOURTH SCROLL:  Located on screen #8.  Go through the entry way
to the open field.  Shoot the last bush towards the back wall.

FIFTH SCROLL:  Located on screen #9.  Crawl up the wall
(disappearing really helps), staying on the right side as you
make your way up.  When you reach the falling rocks, you can stop
them from falling, by shooting the rock hole at the far right
side 46 times (this is not necessary to find the scroll).  Go up,
past the rock holes, and start fighting the main boss of the
round, but do not kill him.  Leave him and go to the far right
side of the screen (on the same walkway the main boss is on) to
get the scroll.  Once you have received the scroll, go back and
kill the boss.

SCREEN TEN:
Walk along the middle of the stone grey walkway to the stairs.
This will place you onto another walkway.  There will be bushes
on your right, and bushes with round grey statues on your left.
Go up to the last grey statue and punch it three times, then
disappear three times.  A message will appear, and you will move
on to the Maze Round.

MAZE ROUND:
When you first enter the maze, go left.  Make a right at the
first passageway.  Shoot and disappear a lot here, allow the bad
guys to chase you.  Be sure to watch your back.  Stay along the
right until you reach the first opening.  Make a right between

                               PHANTASY STAR

HOW TO GET STARTED:
The cave in the upper right-hand corner contains a treasure chest
with 50 Mesetas.  (This cave is also called a warehouse.)

TRANSFERS:
You need to have a transfer, when you go to fight Lassic.  That
way, you don't have to worry about Myau dying.

LACONIAN POT:
You can get the Laconian Pot in the house in the upper-left
corner. (It will automatically be given to you.)

ROAD PASS:
If you have attained 200 Mesetas (by killing Sworms and
Scorpions), head for the town of Scion, which is right of
Camineet. Go to the secondhand shop that sells secrets, and try
to purchase secrets three times.  The third time, you will
receive the ROAD PASS.

Return to Camineet, and replenish your hit points (HP) in the
rest house.  Remember, the rest house is where you can be
replenished for free.

PASSPORT:
Head left to the spaceport, and purchase a PASSPORT for 100
Mesetas.

MYAU / ALSULIN:
Fly to Motavia and find the shop that sells rare secrets.  When
asked if you want to buy a rare animal, say "No", you will then
be asked if you want to trade.  Say "Yes", and you will receive
MYAU in trade for the Laconian Pot.  Myau has the ALSULIN around
her neck (check her item screen).

ODIN / COMPASS:
Return to Palma, and exit Camineet.  South of the fortress is a
cave where you will find ODIN (he is turned to stone).  Use the
Alsulin on him, and he will awaken.  Also in this cave, you will
find a treasure chest with the COMPASS.  The Compass will allow
you to enter the Eppi Forest (South of the cave).  Note: "Use"
Flash.

DUNGEON KEY:
Talk to the leader in the Eppi Forest and he will tell you where
to find the dungeon key which enables you to enter locked
dungeons.  To find the dungeon key, go back to the "Warehouse"
(the same cave you found the original 50 Mesetas).  There will be
another chest with the DUNGEON KEY.

SWEETCAKE:
Exit Camineet and head North to the coast line (far North of
Scion), and enter the cave.  Four levels down you will buy a
SWEETCAKE for 1,000 Mesetas.

GOVERNOR / LETTER:
Return to the city of Paseo on Motavia.  Enter the cave guarded
by the 2 guards.  Give the larger one the Sweetcake, and he will
let you pass to see the GOVERNOR (Follow the Gold hallway to the
Governor's Mansion.)  The GOVERNOR will give you the LETTER.

NOAH:
Return to Paseo and exit the city in the upper left corner.  Walk
around the Antlions to the left, and follow the mountains,
eventually, you will arrive at the Mahara Cave, in the upper left
of the mountains.  There you will find NOAH.  If you give her the
Letter, she will go with you.

GOTHIC:
Return to the spaceport.  In the lower left corner, go down the
orange manhole.  On the other side of the tunnel, you will arrive
in GOTHIC.

DR. LUVENO:
Exit Gothic and head south to the Prison in the mountains.  Here
you will find DR. LUVENO whom you will need to see several times
before he agrees to accompany your group.

ASSISTANT:
Return to the tunnel connecting Gothic and the spaceport.  Take
the branch to the right, in the tunnel, and on the other side of
the door is Dr. Luveno's ASSISTANT.  If you have the Doctor, the
Assistant will accompany you.

POLYMYTRL / LACONIAN POT:
Return to Gothic, and exit to the right.  Head down to the
coastline, and go left and up around the mountains.  Cross the
Lava pit on the sides (be quick, don't stop and fight!)
Immediately to the left is the Bortevo Junkyard.  Above Bortevo,
is a tunnel that will take you to the other side of the water.
Follow the coastline around to the right, and you will find the
City of Loar (Replenish yourself after the Lava pits.)  Proceed
up to the left and around the mountains.  There you will find the
City of Abion.  In Abion, you will find the POLYMYTRL in the
first Food shop.  Also, on the left side of the city, there is a
cave (like the one in Camineet.)  Go in and kill Dr. Mad, and you
will receive the LACONIAN POT for the second time.

HAPSBY THE ROBOT:
Return to Bortevo Junkyard, and go to the house with the blue
door.  Use the Polymytrl in front of the junkpile, and you will
receive HAPSBY THE ROBOT.

SPACESHIP:
Return to Gothic.  The two houses in the middle (not destroyed)
of Gothic have Dr. Luveno and his assistant.  See Dr. Luveno 3
times, and the third time he will have built the Spaceship.  To
the left of Dr. Luveno's lab is a Monk.  He will now let you by,
and to his left, you will see the completed SPACESHIP.

AMBER EYE / LANDROVER / HOVERCRAFT / FLUTE:
Fly to Uzo on Motavia and head southeast.  There you will find
the Casba Cave.  Enter and kill the Casba Dragon, and you will
receive the AMBER EYE.  On the other side is the City of Casba.
There you can buy the LANDROVER and you will talk to a villager,
who will ask you if you have ever heard of the HOVERCRAFT.  You
must tell him "Yes," and he will tell you where it is.  Return to
Uzo, and talk to the villagers, one will tell you where the FLUTE
is buried.  Return to Bortevo Junkyard, and enter the very first
house on Alis' left.  Go in and "Search", and you will
automatically receive the HOVERCRAFT.  Return to Gothic.  Go to
the bottom left corner and at the dead end with one tree, use
"Search", and you will receive the FLUTE.

GAS SHIELD:
Return to Palma.  Go down and to the right from Scion, using the
Hovercraft.  You will find a floating island.  Enter the city on
the island, and find the Dungeon.  In the dungeon, you will find
a shop where you can buy the GAS SHIELD.

MIRROR SHIELD:
Return to Motavia.  Head up and to the left, to the Poison Gas
field.  In the middle, is the city of Sopia.  The leader will
tell you about the MIRROR SHIELD, which is used against Medusa.
To find it, leave Sopia, and head left to the lake.

In the middle of the lake, you will find an island with one
Antlion, and a few cacti.  Head down from the Antlion, to the
first cactus, and use "Search."  You will then receive the MIRROR
SHIELD.

LACONIAN AXE:
Return to Palma and go to Gothic.  Exit Gothic, and head down to
the mountains.  Left of where you found Dr. Luveno is Medusa's
Tower (red inside).  At the top of the tower, fight Medusa.  Once
she is killed, you will receive the LACONIAN AXE.

LACONIAN SWORD:
Return to Scion, using the Hovercraft.  Directly to the right of
Scion, there is a floating tower.  Kill all the Red Dragons you
come upon, and when you kill the correct dragon, he will leave
you a chest with the LACONIAN SWORD in it.

ICE DIGGER:
Go to Skure on Dezoris.  Make your way through the three tunnels,
directly to the left of Skure.  Once the last one is exited,
proceed right, to find another tunnel.  Go through it, and once
you have exited, you will come upon a Dezorian Village.  There
you can buy the ICE DIGGER.  The Ice Digger can only be used in 2
places.  One is to get to the Altiplano Plateau (Laerma Nut
Tree), the other is to get to the Prism.

PRISM:
Go through the three tunnels that lead away from Skure.  Proceed
left.  You will find a place, all the way to the left, where you
can use your Ice Digger to dig South through the mountains to a
lone cave.  Make your way through the cave, killing all the
Titans. When you kill the correct one, there will be a Chest
containing the PRISM.

TORCH:
Exit the cave, proceed North, and you will find the tunnel
leading to the Corona Tower (dark red inside).  Make your way
through the Tower, and eventually, you will find a Dezorian, who
will ask you if you want to trade the Amber Eye for the Torch.
Tell him "Yes," and you will receive the TORCH.

LACONIAN ARMOR:
Proceed back through the tunnel.  Exit the tunnel, head North,
and you will find the Guaron Morgue (everything you fight in here
is Zombies!)  Make your way through the Guaron Morgue, using
Noah's "Tele" spell.  There is a pit trap in front of one of the
doors.  Stand before it and use Myau's "Trap" spell to disarm the
trap. Enter the door to find the Chest, which contains the
LACONIAN ARMOR.

LACONINA SHIELD:
Head down around the mountains to the left, from the Morgue and
you will find another tunnel.  Go through the tunnel and find the
LACONAIN SHIELD.

LAERMA NUTS:
Go back to where you exited the third cave (from Skure), facing
North.  Turn left, and move a few spaces, then turn left.  Then
use your Ice Digger.  A whole will open, which you can follow to
a tree that is all by itself in a circular clearing.  Use the
Torch on the tree, and you will receive the LAERMA NUTS.

FRAD MANTLE:
Return to Motavia.  In the mountains, South of the lake where you
previously obtained the Mirror Shield, is a cave (pink inside).
Find Tajima and fight him.  Once he is beaten, you will receive
the FRAD MANTLE.

CRYSTAL / MIRACLE KEY:
Return to Scion.  North of Scion is the Baya Malay Tower,
surrounded by a wall.  Enter the tower with Noah's "Open" magic.
Answer "No" when the Robot Cop asks you if you have your pass,
then kill him.  When you exit the tower, you will be on the other
side of the wall.  Head left and up to the cave.  Go through the
cave and you will be at a Lava Pit.  Use the Hovercraft to cross
the Lava Pit, and down to the Left will be the Baya Malay Tower
(Refer to map for instructions.)
On the first level, there are two sets of stairs that head up.
If you take the back stairs and go up three more levels, you will
find, behind a door, Damor, The Soothsayer.  Answer "Yes" to all
his questions, until he asks you if you believe everything he has
said, then say "No."  Then he will ask you if you are calling him
a liar, say "No," and he will give you the CRYSTAL.
NOTE:  You can't actually use the Crystal.  It will protect you
without using it.  Head back to Level one, and take the stairs
heading up in the lower right corner.  Follow the instructions on
the enclosed map.  If you explore the levels, you will come upon
the MIRACLE KEY.

Once you have gone through Level thirteen, you will be on the
roof of the Baya Malay Tower (You'll see blue skies, forest,
etc.)  Use the Prism, and then use the Laerma Nuts, and Myau will
fly to Lassic's Castle.

Find and defeat Lassic (when you find Lassic's Shadow, you are
very close!)  Once you have beaten Lassic, you will be instructed
to go to the Governor's Mansion.  In order to do this, Myau must
be alive, or you must have a Transfer, to return to Palma.

When you enter the Mansion, you will fall through a Pit Trap.
Follow the corridors, and you will eventually fall through two
more Pit Traps.  You will find yourself facing a two-way hall.
Go right and go around two corners.  Take three steps and face
the wall on the left- a secret door will be revealed.  Enter and
follow the corridor to a Magical Door.  At this time, heal
yourself with Burgers.

When you enter the door, you will be faced with the last enemy,
Dark Falz!  To beat him, we suggest this technique:

                         ALIS - "Fire"
                         MYAU - "Help" to Noah
                         ODIN - Attack with Laser Gun
                                (found in Skure)
                         NOAH - "Wind"

this procedure until only his head is left.

ROUND 2:  ROBO FLY

ROUND 5:  MAD TUMBLER II
He is easiest to beat as the Monkey.
Jump to the right, onto the gun.  Then, when his body parts start

jump to the right.  Then, continue the previous procedure until
destroyed.

ROUND 6:  DORAMARU II
Repeat the same procedure as Doramaru.

Go towards the right, staying at the top.  The clock is located a
ways down on the bottom of one of the platforms.  Get the clock,
and proceed to the warp door, guarded by the Snail.  Jump and
shoot the Snail, until he dies.  Enter the warp door.  Go to the
left, to a wall, guarded by a moving Skull.  On the other side of
the wall, you will find the Jet Pack.  To get to it, shoot the
top portion of the wall, and then enter.  Then shoot both sides
of the den.  A Star will appear, five bricks down from the top.
Get the star, and keep flying on the top portion, going left.
Fight the creature located all the way down to the left just
above the exit door.  Shoot the creature twelve to fourteen times
(you know you have scored a hit, because you will hear a "ding").
After beating him, make your way to the exit door.  You will need
to shoot out the bricks then enter it.

BONUS ROUND:
When you are in the surface world, shoot under the block which is
located at the right and down from the warp door.  You will find
a spot where your bullet hits something.  Keep shooting this
spot, until your bullet goes through.  When it does, enter the
above warp door.  If it should happen not to work, don't worry,
go back through the warp door, and try again!

ROUND 6:
HOW TO GET THROUGH THE ROUND:
Make your way to the right.  Get the Jet Pack, which is in mid-
air.  Continue going right, to find the warp door.  Once entered,
proceed left, flying along the bottom of the screen.  Find and
beat the gold creature that flies in a circle.  After beating
him, proceed left, to the warp door.  Once entered, shoot the
colorful creatures, to get the key. If you need it, an extra Jet
Pack is located to the right of the warp door.  Proceed left, to
the warp door in the lower left hand corner.  Once entered, you
are in the Generator room.  In this room, there are five main
points that need to be hit, concentrate on them one at a time.
If you need it, there is an extra Jet Pack to the right of the
points.  Once you have taken them out, a passageway shall be
revealed!

USING NINJA MAGIC:
To use the Ninja Magic, press and hold BUTTON #2, then press
BUTTON #1 twice.

BEATING THE BOSSES

MISSION ONE:  KEN OH
Stay on the left hand side of the screen and continuously jump.
When the fireballs get close to you, stop jumping and move to the
right.  Then, jump and shoot him, in the face.  When the
fireballs disappear, he will throw another set of them.  Continue
over to the left of the screen and follow the previous procedure.

MISSION TWO:
NOTE:  The exit for mission 2-2 (the red room), is at the very
top of the room on the left-hand side.

BLACK TURTLE:
Jump and shoot the Helicopter, in the Nose, eight times.  Try to
hit him five or six times, before the Ninjas come out.  That way
you don't have to worry about the Ninjas too much.  When they
start coming, just avoid them, and always remember, your main
objective is to hit the Helicopter in the Nose.

MISSION THREE:  MANDARA
Get as close to the rows of statues as you can and start shooting
and backing up.  Each statue will take four hits to be destroyed.
When you have taken out all of the statues, you will come up
against a face on a wall shooting fireballs.  Jump and shoot the
Red "eye", eight times, while avoiding the fireballs.

MISSION FOUR:  LOBSTER
Jump and shoot his head, when his sword is down.  Do this as
quickly as you can because once he comes after you, you may not
get another chance!

MISSION FIVE:  MASKED NINJA
There are four forms of the Masked Ninja.

GLOWING NINJA:
Shoot him three times when his glowing defense is gone.

TORNADO (WHIRLWIND) NINJA:  Crouch down and let him come to you.
When he comes close enough, kick him.  He will back away.  Repeat
this procedure three times.

JUMPING NINJA:
Every time he jumps and lands, he leaves a "White Shadow," that
will also attack you.  When he jumps, you jump and shoot him in
the air.  He will land (he won't leave a shadow, if you hit him
in mid-air), and jump again.  Repeat this procedure three times.

MASKED NINJA:
This guy runs real fast.  Let him run past you once (this will
drain your life meter a little, so be sure you have enough), then
turn and face him, and shoot him as fast as you can.  Keep
shooting until he is destroyed.

ADDITIONAL HINT:
The Green Ninja's are easiest to kill by hitting them in the feet
twice.

@NODE SLAPSHOT

                                 SLAP SHOT

SCORING GOALS:
The best way to score a goal is to skate across the top of the
rink, avoiding the other team.  When you reach the goal line,
press button #2 to pass to a skater closer to the goal, then when
that skater gets the puck, quickly press button #1 and angle the
shot towards the goal, away from the goalie.

There are other ways to score also!  Sometimes, you can catch the
goalie off guard by shooting the puck from half court (this is
the best way to score in a two-player game).  The most effective
way to do this is to pay attention to where you are when you
shoot the puck.   Depending on where you are shooting from, the
goalie will be standing in different places in the net.  After a
while, you'll be able to make him stand in a certain corner, and
then shoot around him!

DEFENDING YOUR GOAL:
Once the other team has the puck, hit button #2 to select the
closest player to the puck.  Bump the player with the puck until
either you fall down, or you steal the puck.  If your player
falls down, press button #2 again to choose the next closest
player, and repeat the procedure.

If all else fails, and the player gets past your guys, let the
computer control all the other guys, and concentrate on your
goalie.

GETTING IN A FIGHT:
To make your player get into a fight, keep bumping the guy with
the puck, and eventually, the screen will change and you will be
fighting.  The fights are very hard to win, so keep practicing.

1ST FIGHT (COMPUTER VS. YOU):
To beat Black Spy in first fight, press both BUTTONS #1 and 2
quickly, while pressing the Directional Pad in the direction of
the enemy.

TO GET THE OBJECTS:
Face furniture (tables, dresser, pictures, desks, etc.) that you
wish to get, and press BUTTON #2.  The object (if there is one)
will appear in your Spy's left hand, and on your item screen to
the right and below your trap items.  The object in the Spy's
hand looks like a $ bag.  It will keep flashing on your item
screen until you find the bag to place the items in.  So, your
first priority is to find the bag quickly before your opponent
does.  Then the object will stay solid on the item screen.

TO OPEN DOORS:
Stand in front of the door, and press BUTTON #2.

AIRPORT:
Do you want to be able to see the airport door location during
your game play?  Or, do you want to only see it when you have
collected all the items, and are heading for the airport?  This
choice can be made by pressing the START BUTTON, while on the
Title Screen.  This will bring up another screen listing:

3.  Hide Airport

If you want to see the airport, select No.

TO SET TRAPS:
Approach the object you want the trap set at (Tables, chests,
etc.), and press BUTTON #2.  Take whatever may be hidden there.
This will appear in the form of $ bag, as mentioned before.  This
does not apply to doorways.  Keep facing the object you took the
items from, or face the doorway.  Press BUTTON #1, and an arrow
will appear next to the bomb on the right.  When the arrow is
next to the trap you want, press BUTTON #2.  The trap will appear
in your Spy's hand.  Press BUTTON #2 again, and you'll notice the
object in your Spy's hand is now gone.  Your trap is now set.
Later, when you or your opponent touches the door, a large "?"
mark will appear over the Spy's head, and the Spy will be killed.
So Remember where you set your traps!

HELPFUL HINTS:
To serve the ball "in" on easy levels, continuously press Button
1.

On the harder levels, press Button 1 a few seconds after it is
thrown.

If you serve, and the computer runs up to the net, hit the ball
deep, and run up to the net to smash his return.

If the computer hits the ball short, and starts to run up to the
net, get close to the net, and smash the ball.  If he hits it
deep, hit it back deep, otherwise he will smash it.

On a smash, you can control where the ball goes.  If you hit the
ball late, it will go to the left.  Hit the ball early, and it
will go towards the right.  Hit the ball in between there, and
you will smash the ball straight.

Never give up on the ball (expecially in the easy rounds).  You
should be able to get two swings at the ball.  If you miss it the
first time, run back to take another swing at it.

INSTRUCTION BOOK CORRECTION:
Page 6, under "Continue Game" indicates that if there are two
players playing at the same time, a player will always be
revived, as long as the other player remains alive.  However,
this is not true.  Once the two continues are used, the game
ends, and the remaining player continues alone.

CONTINUE IN ONE PLAYER MODE:
When Player 1 is down to his last life, have Player 2 join in
(Directions on Page 5).  If Player 1 dies, the game can be
continued on by playing Player 2.

BEATING THE MIDDLE BOSSES:
Though not as powerful as the Big Bosses, they can be worse,
because they aim right for you.  Take out these bosses as quickly
as possible, using the weapon you have available (try to use a
special weapon).

BEATING THE BOSSES:
WORLD WAR II ERA:  LARGE TANK
Aim for the Tank's Turret Gun, on the top portion of the tank.

PRIMITIVE ERA:  TYRASAURUS
Move quickly to the top left portion of the screen.  Slowly move
across the top of the head, and aim downward.  Alternately aim

FUTURE WORLD ERA:  GORUGO
Move quickly to the top left portion of the screen.  Slowly move
across the top of the head, and aim downward.  Alternately aim
for the left and right hand sides of his head.

MEDIEVAL JAPAN ERA (AGE OF WARS):  KABUKI
The face of this guy is his weak spot, so constantly aim for the
face and the surrounding area, staying at the top of the screen.
An Energy Gun is a must.

GYLEND'S WORLD:  GYLEND
Stay at the top left of the screen, and aim for the red pointed
portion of the face.  Try for accuracy and speed!  The Energy Gun
is a must.

                             CARMEN SAN DIEGO

GAME STRATEGIES:
Check the hints in the user's manual.

Keep track of the last city you were in, just in case you have to
back track in order to pick up the trail again.

Certain clues refer to more than one country, so be careful not
to jump to early conclusions.  An extra clue is sometimes needed.

You need both country clues and criminal clues to catch the
perpetrator.

Do not wait too long in the chase to get a warrant.  If you
arrive in the last city and you do not have a warrant, the
criminal will get away.

To avoid the knives and bullets, move to the opposite side of the
screen when the criminal appears.

To capture Carmen, you need to take her lead and have her follow
your moves.

You will need the following information to get the warrant:
Sex:        FEMALE
Hobby:      TENNIS
Hair:       BROWN
Feature:    JEWELRY
Auto:       CONVERTIBLE

As you move up in rank, you will go through more cities.

If you choose to be ACE DETECTIVE, you have to continually solve
the cases until you get to Carmen.

swords.  Go left and enter the door at the end.

To defeat the MEKA DRAGON, stand all the way in the left corner, wait
for him to come close to you then run and jump and stab him in the
nose.

He changes you into Lizard-Man.

Once back in the hallway, proceed all the way to the right.  Kill the

bottom of the tower.  Drop down the well and go right.  Open the
treasure chest and receive a HEART.  Go into the door beneath the shop
door.  Fall into the well and proceed to the right (Area 2).  Once out
of the sewer, proceed right over the islands (Area 3) and go to the
building (Area 4).  Get the key from the treasure chest behind the
left door.

RETURN TO AREA ONE

Enter the door on the second floor of the tower.  Continue up the

To defeat the MUMMY DRAGON, stay on the left hand side of the screen
and when he comes close, jump and hit it in the nose (you should be
able to hit him three or four times before you can't reach him
anymore).  Then, duck down, and wait for it to back off.  If it goes

you.  If it stays low, back to the left, and repeat the previous
instructions.

is a hospital, and the other door, lets you buy the DRAGON MAIL ARMOR
(Equip with this immediately, because it will make lava not harm you).

the top.  Enter the door to fight the CAPTAIN DRAGON.

up and you will find a secret door.  Enter the room and open the
treasure chest.  Return to the first door to find the DAIMYO DRAGON.

To defeat the Daimyo Dragon, stand on the left side of the screen, run
and hit him in the nose when his sword is up, then move to the left
and avoid the blue balls that come out of the sword.

RETURN TO AREA ONE.

HAWK-MAN / MAGICAL SABER / LEGENDARY ITEMS / VAMPIRE DRAGON /
SALAMANDER CROSS:
Turn into Mouse-Man.  Go back to the bridge made of destructible
blocks.  Stand on the left hand side of the Mouse blocks.  Break the
block, and proceed down the wall, to the wells.  Drop down the first
well and bounce back up to the ceiling, while holding up on the
Control Pad.  Once on the ceiling, proceed left to the fourth well and
drop down (Area 17).  Enter the door at the bottom and proceed through
the maze.  Go to the one destructible block by itself on the left of
the screen.  Break the block and enter the door that appears.  Open
the treasure chest and receive the MAGICAL SABER. Use the Magical
Saber to create a staircase to the door, leave the room and return to
area one.

Turn back into Hawk-Man.  Fly all the way over to the right hand side
of the screen.  As you are flying, you will see the broken castle
(where you came from in the beginning).  By exploring the castle, you
will find the LEGENDARY SWORD, and LEGENDARY ARMOR.  Exit the castle
and immediately fall down the well.  Push forward on the Directional
Pad to find a secret shop where you can buy the LEGENDARY SHIELD.  Fly
up and to the left of the tower (Area 18).  Break the blocks in the
sky and enter the door.  Use the Magical Saber to create blocks in the
stars on the screen.  Then, proceed to break the blocks and enter the
door that appears.  This is the entrance to the last dragon's castle.
Enter the castle door and go right.  Fly up the opening in the ceiling
at the end of the hall.  Proceed up through the maze and enter the
door to find a transforming room.  Change into Mouse-Man.  Move to the
blue area to the right of the door and proceed on through the maze.
At the end of the maze, drop into the hallway.  Enter the door on the
right and get the HEART.  Proceed left and continue through the maze.
At the end, drop down into the water and enter the transforming room.
Change into Piranha-Man.  Swim to the door in the upper right corner.
Enter the door and proceed right through the hallway.  At the end of
the hallway, enter the transforming room and change into Lion-Man.
Break the destructible blocks and proceed through the maze.  Drop into
the darkened hallway and continue to the right.  Drop down until you
find a door, enter the door and you will be in a gold room with a
square hole in the bottom of it.  Drop into the hole, and press up to
find a hidden door.  Transform into Hawk-Man and fly to the upper
right corner.  Proceed through the maze until you reach a door.  Enter
the door and you will be faced with the VAMPIRE DRAGON.

To defeat the Vampire Dragon, stay at the bottom middle of the screen
and wait for him to come level with you.  When he comes close, jump
and hit his cape.  When he goes down, below the screen, fly up so he
won't come up and hit you!  Repeat this procedure until he is
destroyed.  You will get the SALAMANDER CROSS and be able to change
into Human-Man.

General Hints:

While going through the areas of the game, take note, as to what kind
of blocks are there (Mouse Blocks, Destructible, etc.).  This will be
important for later in the game.

Treasure chests will refill themselves, each time you use a password
(except for heart chests, they will be empty).
Collect weapons, Charm Stones, and money, by going between two
screens, and killing the enemies that re-appear.  EG.:  In the Mouse
Man maze (Area 8), the top-left Spark will continue to re-appear, if
you go back and forth, between the Jungle screen, and the Maze screen.
There are several places that are good to do this in, including Area 6-Keep
killing the creature in front of the Sphinx;  Area 9-Keep going from the
water up, and then head down to kill the two green creatures;  and Area
3-Lots and Lots of monsters to kill!

Towards the end of the game, you will receive the HEAVENLY SHIELD, and
the HADES ARMOR (The armor is found at random.  You find it by killing
a monster in the Daimyo Castle, or buying it after you kill the Daimyo
Dragon).  Equipping with these will act as a life-potion, that will
heal you indefinitely.

The Crystal items can be found in the tall tower in Area 1.  Just
follow the Mouse Blocks.

What you are equipped with, may change the treasures you receive from
killing the enemies, and opening the chests!

There are transforming rooms in Areas 2, 10, and 18.

Returns are found in Areas 6, 9, and 18.

Thunder Saber (to break blocks), found in Area 10.

Magical Saber (to create blocks), found in Area 17.

the two chests that are there.  One contains the HAMMER and the other
contains the fourth BOOK OF Y'S.

SILVER SHIELD:

of the ninth floor is a room surrounded by four stone statues.  When
you enter the room and touch the chest, you will receive the SILVER
SHIELD.  The statues will also come to life.  Now is a good time to
use the mirror.  Once they are frozen, leave the room.  On the right
side of the ninth floor are the stairs that lead to the tenth floor.
The tenth floor has two sets of stairs.  The stairs on the right lead
to the eleventh floor.  When you enter these stairs, your life meter

Talk to the man in there and exit.  Go back to the left and out the
door you came in.  Go back down to the tenth floor and take the stairs
on the left side of the floor.  When out on the ledge, go five pillars
to the right, equip the hammer and break the pillar.  This will make
the poisonous room harmless.  Before going back to the poisonous room,
continue to the right and enter the very next door.  In this room, you
will find LUTHER JEMMA.

NOTE:  Remember where Luther Jemma is, because you will need to come
back to him later.

Return to the poisonous room and continue to the right, past the room

locations throughout the area.  Follow the mirrors and doorways, and
you will find a chest containing the SILVER ARMOR.  To get out of the
mirror room look for a room with mirrors side by side, touch the
mirror on the right and you will be transported to room with one
mirror in front of you.  Touch that mirror and you will be able to
find the stairs out of this maze.

BATTLE SHIELD:

tower.

After reading the books go back to Luther Jemma on the eleventh floor
and he will give you the AMULET.

POTION:
Proceed up the floors from Luther Jemma to the fifteenth floor. Take

the eighteenth floor and take the stairs on the left to the twentieth
floor.

FLAME SWORD:
Go left through the twentieth floor.  A hole will appear in the wall,
go through the hole and you will see a chest with two guards.  The
guards are very hard to beat, so try using different rings, and taking
them on one-by-one.  Once they are defeated, open the chest to receive
the FLAME SWORD.  From the hole in the wall, continue to the left to
the stairs leading to the twenty-first floor.

The twenty-first floor is another mirror maze.  When you find three
doorways, take the middle one.  Follow the passage until you see two
mirrors next to each other.  Take the mirror on the right, and follow
the passageway to the right.  The stairs will be found at the end of
the passageway.

HEADY:
The twenty-second floor is also filled with mirrors.  Touch the
mirrors and come to a green door.  This is where you will meet HEADY.
To beat Heady, run up to the white face.  Then, when the heads are
close together, run back and forth between the faces.  Try to stand on
top of the faces, because they will not hurt you, and with a little
bit of practice, you will be able to avoid the fireballs also.  You
will know he is losing power, because the fireballs floating around
his heads will disappear one by one, as his life meter gets lower.
After you defeat Heady proceed left and up all the flights of stairs
to the green door.  If you have the amulet you will be allowed to
enter.

DULK DEKT / BOOK OF Y'S:
Enter the room and equip all of the silver items.  Walk up and touch
DARK DEKT.  When you do this, the platform will take off and start
flying through space.  Chase him around the platform, constantly
keeping your sword stuck in him, while avoiding the fireballs.
Everytime you touch him, a square will disappear on the floor, so you
want to chase him around the outside first.  Eventually, he will die.
After he is destroyed you will get the sixth BOOK OF Y'S.

                       ZILLION II: THE TRI-FORMATION

CONTINUE FEATURE:
When the Game Over screen appears, press the control pad UP and
BUTTON ONE. This will allow you to continue three times.

EXTRA MEN:
When in the narrow corridor in stages 1,3,5,and 7 pick up the A
and change into the ARMORATOR carefully ease J.J. into one of the
bottomless pits. Line his shoulders up with the top of the pit.
Slowly press up on the control pad and fire at the on coming
flying creatures. You will reach a level where you are even with
the creatures and you can maintain this position as long as you
do not move or re-adjust your control pad. Just keep firing you
will get free guys at 30,000, 70,000, 120,000. You can have a
maximum of four.

LEVEL ONE:
Always keep shooting!  You can get many Norsa Warriors before
they shoot.

Learn how and when to jump.

If you jump and move in a diagonal direction, you can jump
higher.  When you have the three Zillion laser pieces, you will
be able to take down many enemies quicker., and with less shots.

The pulsating areas on the floor will decrease your life meter,
so watch out!

LEVEL TWO:
When on this or any other even-numbered level, you must watch
out for Noza Noza.  Get as close to the edge of the pits as
possible, and shoot any Norsa Warriors, and Noza Noza before
jumping across.

When fighting the Olivian Platoon Captain, stay where you start
and just shoot.  be ready to turn quickly when he appears behind
you.

LEVEL THREE:
This level is much like Level One, except things move faster.
Sometimes, there will be a multi-level floors.  There is likely
to be less fighting on the tops of these levels.

When fighting the Norsa Raker (With the Armorator), shoot a
couple shots, that are level with him.  Then move up or down, so
he doesn't hit you.

Fighting the Norsa Raker (Without the Armorator), shoot as much
as you can, and when he fires at you, jump over it.

If you complete fighting the Norsa Rakers (Without the
Armorator), go as far to the front as you can, duck down in the
Turbo Cycle, and shoot.

LEVEL FOUR:
The Black Noza Noza takes two shots to destroy.  If you don't
have enough room to get two shots off, jump or dodge him.

When the Jet Soldiers attack, duck down, and they can't hit
you.

When fighting the Radjian Defense Leader, stay in the middle of
the screen.  When he is on the ground, duck and shoot.  When he
jumps, turn towards where he is going to land, and repeat the
same procedure.

LEVEL FIVE:
Change to Armorator, when you first start this level.

Learn to dodge the Gun Batteries.

There will be two sets of Norsa Rakers.  After you destroy
them, there will be two or three Norsa Warriors on Aerobats
coming from behind you, so be prepared!

LEVEL SIX:
Notice the blocks on the ceiling.  Norsa Warriors will drop out
of them and attack you.  To get by the Warriors, shoot them as
quickly as you can.

When the Norsa Mini Rakers come at you, duck and dodge their
fire.

Fighting Alleevia Suprese is tricky.  The best way to attack,
is to dodge his missiles, and shoot continuously.  When he comes
very close, jump over him, turn around and keep firing.

LEVEL SEVEN:
This is the hardest level, although having a complete Zillion
Laser will help you tremendously.  Learn to dodge the various
enemies coming at you.  Change to the Armorator immediately.

The pulsating areas on the floors will not hurt you.

LEVEL EIGHT:
This level is much like level six.  Watch out for Gun
Batteries.  They shoot mega Skofu Sites.

To defeat Baron Rick, jump and shoot toward the right.  Keep
firing at him, while dodging his laser fire.  When he gets hit,
he flashes and while he is flashing, and you are able to walk
through him.  Repeat this procedure, and continue shooting at
him.  This is not a timed fight.

ADDITIONAL HINTS:
To keep from getting hit by the flying Skofu-Site (When you're
on the motorcycle), keep pressing down on the directional pad in
the lower right hand corner and keep firing.

Don't go down Electric Coils in the odd levels.

Use your zillion 3.  This is the best weapon

On Level five, try to have both Apple and Champ in reserve.

When your life meter is at "I", or "L", in the word LIFE,
switch partners.

which will save bandwidth and all.  Once you have the Primaries, 
you need only retrieve the Read Me file each month, and add
the material to the Primaries you have on hand.  Of course, the
Primaries will be updated as well, so no worries there.

PLANNED FOR FUTURE UPDATES
--------------------------
A Golden Axe Warrior walkthru, Rambo II hints, an expanded guide
for Wonderboy III, and whatever other stuff I find in my
e-mail.

                         SEGA MASTER SYSTEM CHEATS

                                Version1.10




Version         History
==============  =======================================================

1.00            First release.  Only appeared on Amiga Format cover CD.
                It is based on Jeff Bogumil Master System Cheats Col-
                lection wich was a simple ascii text format.
                @{" Read original note by Jeff " LINK JEFF }

1.01            Nothing added/changed, first public release to Aminet.

1.10            80 games added and 17 updated, this makes a total of
                171 games covered.  Most updates are coming from the
                www.gamewinners.com homepage wich covers a large united
                list of cheats for many consoles/computers.

                Also made shorter lists of names, previously A-M, N-Z
                changed to A-H, I-P & Q-Z mostly for ease of use.

                Still passwords to add for Populus and Tennis Ace but
                I'm a bit bored of typing...  I'll do it later.


Hope you enjoy those cheats and if you find newer version(s) of these
cheats (or others) send them to me, I will update this file. Please
prefer CHEATS, if you want to include solutions, type'em yourself
(maximum 74 chars wide) and send'em attached to your mail (ZIP or LHA).

You can always contact me by e-mail : - hibisch@be.tf
                                      - hibisch@yahoo.com
