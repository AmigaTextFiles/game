**********************************************************
Number 2


               -=-=SIMON THE SORCERER COMPLETE SOLVE=-=-



First of all I want to say this....It was a awful lot of work to write this 

solve so please don't steal this and take the credz for it...



And now for the Solve:



You start off in Calypso's place.

Take the magnet(on the fridge) and the scissors(in the drawer) with you.



Go outside and walk to the blacksmith.....Take the Rope and Clapper there.

Now use Rope with Magnet to make this one item...



Now go to the Druids place(a ladder and a wagonwheel are standing outside his

house) and pickup the Ladder.Now go inside and pickup the Cold Remedy(on the

table) and the Specimen Jar(stands next to the blue and red jars).



Now go to the inn, it's called "The drunken Druid" and enter this place.

There is a box of matches on the fruit machine.Pick it up. After that use

scissors on dwarf. The drunken fool is sleeping so we're gonna cut his beard

off.



So far for the village...



Before we continue....Once outside I'll use terms like :



R = Leave screen to the right

L = Leave screen to the left

U = Leave screen on the upper side

D = leave screen on the down side

RU = There's a path leading to the Right Upper corner of the screen

RD,LU and LD....



By now you've found out you can "use the map" to zap from place to place...

I will use this often.



Now go outside to the forest.

Once there go R-D-R(there must be a fallen tree here)-R(treestump) and have

your first conversation with some Woodworms. Go D-L to arrive at the Witches

Cottage. See the well over there ??  Use the handle attached to the well to

pickup the bucket of water.



Once you have the bucket go Right till you meet the troll and the two goats.

Watch the conversation.You can not pass the bridge at this time but outhearing

this conversation will save you a lot time later on..



Now "use" your map to go back to the village.

You now stand in front of the shop. Leave the village (left exit) and once

outside go R-U-R and meet the wise owl..Talk to him and he looses a feather.

Pick it up!! You can come here often to talk to the owl and he will give you

some hints. But why do you need them since you're reading the solve now....



From here go L-D. There's a barbarian here...Help the zero-I.Q. figure to

remove the thorn from his foot..He's very gratefull and you'll get a whistle 

from him.



Next use your map to return to the troll-bridge.

Once there "talk" to the troll about his problem. Talk to the troll till he

takes your whistle and uses it....Watch the scene now, it's great....

So you can cross the bridge, it's cleared. Pickup the Placard on the bridge

to demonstate with it. 



Now cross the bridge and go R-R to meet Oaf..

Talk to Oaf about his Beans.

Suggest to water the Beans. And what luck, you happen to have a bucket of 

water... Ai, you drowned them and leave the screen.. Go back there and notice

Oaf is gone and there's a puddle of water.(with some beans in it)  

Pick up the beans.



From here go R-RD. Use your clapper with the bell. Use the bell..Clang,clang.

After severall minutes when you have recovered you can use the hair to climb

up. There you meet Repulser,some sort of tranformed pig. Start talking to her

and kiss here...YOU HERO !!!!! (but at least you have a pig now.) Otherwise

if she had turned into the beautifull lady the game would have ended here

with "horny" Simon. For some reason I do not understand the programmers left

out the fuck-scene with the pig...

Back to bussines: Use the hair again to exit the tower. Go L-RU.

Now you are on a screen with two waterfalls. If you look at the forge you can

see someone fishing down there. Now watch this !!!  There are vines in the

Left-down corner of this screen. Leave this screen by clicking on the vines.

Once down you see a Golum fishing there. Talk to him. You can't do anything

now so we'll come back later here.



Use yor map to go back to the village.

Go to Calypso's place and walk behind the cottage. There's a heap of compost

here. Use your beans here and after they have grown up pick the water-melon.

Now go to the house with the beehive(Left of druids place).

Use your Repulser(piggy) with the chocolate door. Enter the house.

Inside pick up the Smoke-box and the Hat. Go out. Use Smoke-box on Beehive

and afterwards pick up Wax(top of beehive).

Go to the Drunken Druid and talk to the barman.. Order a drink...As soon as he

disappears behind his counter use Wax on Beerbarrel, which is standing behind

him. Wait and he'll give you a Leaflet.

Go outside and look what is waiting there to be picked up.



Use your map to go to the owls place. From here go R-R-RU and "talk to the 

hole" ???? Indiana Jones is digging here. Go Right.

You have arrived at the dwarf mine(located on your map as "Centre of the 

forest"). Pick up the Rock in front of the mine and have a closer look at it !!

Now that you know the password enter the mine. Keep trying the password till

you say "beer". Pffff, you may pass.

Give Beer to the guarding dwarf. Follow him downstairs. Once down use your

Feather on the sleeping dwarf. He rolls over and pickup the key. Nasty game !

Now go Up and Left. Talk to the "middle dwarf". Pick up the Hook on the left 

side of this dwarf. Now use your Key on the door and enter the doorway. Inside

make the dwarf there an offer. You got something he wants. Give the Beer 

Voucher to the Dwarf. You'll get a Gem in return for it. Give the Gem to the

Pig to fuck it again or keep it for later use(better do the second). Now exit

the mine.



Go LU to a screen with a heavy door and bars. Pickup the paper there(it's on

the ground in front of you).



Go R-RU and enter the cave-entrance. Walk R till you see a swamphouse and open

the door. Finally you'll get something to eat. Jum,jum,jum..... Talk to the

swampling. Do not offend him on his birthday and eat his stew. At the second

bowl use Specimen-jar with Stew. You get another bowl of stew and you MUST

consume this one. Now you have eaten all his stew so the swampling dies of

starvation......Nop, he's gonna get new ingredients for more jumjum-stew.

Have you noticed the Chest jet? Move it. See the trapdoor? Open it... you

can go down but you will not come very far.



Now exit the swampling house (the Normal Way!) and go R-R-R-R till you arrive

at the sleeping giant. This one only for Map-purpose.



Now use your map and zap to the Centre of the forest.

From there go RD-R and meet the woodcutter. Talk to him to get his Metal-

detector.



Use your map to go to the village. Enter the shop. Give shopping-list to the

shopkeeper(s???) Behind them are a bottle of "white spirit" and a hammer.

We'll get back later here to buy these items.

Now go to the Dodgy Geezer (sales person,arabic I think) and give him your 

Gem. Sell it for 20 gold peaces and not a penny less.

So now that you have your gold go to the shop and pick up(buy) the White Spirit

and the Hammer(and you get a free nail !! Scroodges...).



Use your map to zap to the troll-bridge. Go LU and talk to the bard. Give him

your pig and let him fuck it...Oh, you don't have the pig anymore....What a

shame.. Anyway, you can't stand the noise of the sousaphone sound so you exit

the scene. Go back there and use Water-melon with Sousaphone..And since you

have Instrument-repairing abbilities he'll give you his Sousaphone.



Use your map to teleport( Enterprise,this is captain Kirk) to the crossroads,

go RU-vines and talk to the golum again. In conversation take option 1 to 

hand over your Specimen-jar with Stew. You get his fishing rod, so start

fishing.



Now teleport(Spock here, captain) to the Sleeping Giant. Since you'll have to

wake him use the Sousaphone. It works! he knocks over the tree so you can pass

it. 



Go R-R and enter the cave. Watch the dragon-scene and get blown out. Re-enter 

the cave and use Cold-remedy on dragon. Re-re-enter the cave and take the

fire-extinguisher. Leave the cave and use your Hook with the Boulder on top

of the cave. Click on Boulder to climb the cave. Once up walk to the Hole and

use your Rope&Magnet with Hole untill you have 40 gold coins and go down the

way you came.



Once down, go RU and pickup the Rock. Look at it. Hey, got an idea ????

Go R-R-R till you come to the tree with the pink spot. Talk to the tree.

Talk to the tree ??????

YES, TALK TO THE TREE !!!!!  After this use White Spirit on Pink Splodge to

remove the stain from the tree. Talk to the tree to get your first Magic

words.



Now zap to the sleeping giant, walk L and use your Metal detector. YES !!!!!

You have found your milrith(easy, isn't it ?)



Now go to the hole of Indian Johnny(map:centre of forest,left) and give

him the rock with the fossil in it. Shit, you have to get the fossil out.



Now zap back to the village. Hey, there is a box in front of the store...

So, use box I should say.. Now wait and when arrived open box. 

Behind you on the floor is a Rat-bone. Pick it up. Look at the boxes and find

your Spellbook. Take a look at your Spellbook. There's a paper in it. Use

Paper on Door. Use Ratbone at Lock. Pickup paper. Use Key on Lock. Open Door.

Step through the doorway and pickup the Bucket. Go down now..

Open the Iron Maiden and pick up the Mints. Talk to the druid.

Now walk up and down the stairs and remove the Ring. Talk to the druid again.

You have to prove your innocence to him by using his silver cross on your

forehead. After that ask him if he got any ideas to escape. Now use your last

found bucket on the druid. See the fiery pot in the middle of the room ?

There's a flaming brand there which we'll gonna use on the druid.

Now step into the Iron Maiden and wait for the druid to return. open the Iron

Maiden and pick up the hacksaw the druid brought you. Use your hack-saw on

the bars and free you are.



Oh yes, the fossil....

Zap back to the village and go to the blacksmith. Use your Rock with his Anvil

to get the Fossil out. Since you're in town now why don't you pay the druid a

visit ? Talk to him and ask for his help. Sure, the old Succer will help you..

IN EXHANGE FOR FROGSBANE !!!!! So use your Placard now to kill the old bastard.

It won't work ???? Programmers, why not ????



Zap now to the Centre of the forest and go Left.

Give the fossil to Incata Jambory down the Hole and tell him you found it where

your detector is.



Now go to your detector(map:sleeping giant-L). And have a look at the dirt.

Pick up the Milrith-ore. Zap back to the village and give the Milrith-ore to

the blacksmith. He makes an axe-head for you.



Use map to Centre of forest-RD-R and give the axe-head to the woodcutter..

He's so happy with it he'll gonna try it at once... So you can enter his house

now. So do it. Inside pick up the climbing pin. Next use the fire-extinguisher

to put the fire out. See the hook above the fire place ? Move it and an exit

down becomes vissible. Go down and pick up a piece of Mahogany.



Now go to the swamplings house(map:centre of forest-RU-R-R-R). Enter the house

and go down the trapdoor. Walk R. The plank is loose. Use the Nail on Plank.

Now walk Right. See the flowers on top of the skull ? It's Frogsbane.....



Zap over to the witch cottage and go R-R to reach the treestump.. Talk to the

woodworms in the treestump and let them eat your piece of Mahogany.



So now go back to the druids place and hand over the Frogsbane. He'll give you

the potion. He's no use to the rest of the game so kill him now if you like too.



Next go back to the repulser house(map:cross roads-RD).

Use Hair to enter the house.

Once inside use the Woodworms on the Floorboards. You fall down through the 

hole and see another hole in the floor. Use your ladder on this hole.

Go down and open the Tomb. Aaaaarrrggghhhh. You're outside now. Re-enter the

tomb-room and open it again. If the mummy steps out be quick. At his rearside

there's a peace of Loose Bandage. Pick this up and see what happens. Once

destroyed you can pick up his staff. Now that you have his staff you can become

a real wizkid.



Zap to the village and go to the Drunken Druid. Inside walk Right to the side-

room. There are four wizards here. Talk to them and tell them that you do any-

thing to become a wizard. They are all gay so bend over and pull up your robe.

Nah, they want your staff, uh, THE Staff. So talk to them again and give them

the staff. After you,ve done that they want money too, so give them their

money. You get your WizKid Wallet in return.



Now that you are a real wizard you can go fight the witch. Use your map to go

to the witch cottage. Open the door and step inside. See the mousehole in the

back ? Good you'll need it later...All you need now is the broom so pick it 

up. Wrong!!! The witch appears. Challenge her for a duel. Play the duel till

you win from the witch.(Hocus Pocus worked best for me...). If you win you

pick up the broom automatically. The witch changes and you have to change too

to defend yourself. Use the word "abracadabra" to change into a mouse and run

to the mousehole quickly.



Now use your map to go to the dragons cave.

From here go RU-R. Use the Climbing Pin with the Hole and climb up.

Talk to the snowman. To remove him from the scene consume a mint.

Now walk R-R.

You have arrived at Sordids Tower.



Use your broom to fly over to the tower. Consume your Potion, and now you can

enter the tower.

Inside you meet your dog. See that you get one of his Hairs. He picks you up

and puts you in the garden.

In the garden pick up the Stone and the Leaf(both on the path) and the 

Matchstick inside the bucket. Now go Left



Pickup the Lily-leaf here. Use your Matchstick with the Lily-leaf. Use your

Leaf with the Matchstick. So now you have a boat. Pick up some seeds and go 

back to the shore. Use your Hair on the Tap. Use Stone on Seeds. You have

some oil now. Use the Oil on the Tap. Move the Hair. Step on your Boat and go

left.



There's a frog here. Is it the Druid ? Nop, it's his mother...

See the water at your right? Have a look at it. Do NOT pick up the Tadpole now

but try to walk to the left first... So, had a good laugh? Pick up the Tadpole

and talk to the Frog. Threathen to turn his little Tadpole into Froglegs(2)

and the frog clears your path. Pick up the Mushroom and consume it to change

back to normal size.



Now pick up the Branch from the tree(on the right side). Open the door and 

enter the Tower. Re-enter the tower and use Branch on Chest. Now pick up the

Shield and the Spear. Now go Down.



Once down pick up chest. Use Spear with Skull. Pick up the Skull.

Move the lever. Use chest with Block and move the lever again. Crack!!

Move the Lever again and pick up the Candles. Go Up and Up.



Now you're in Sordids bedroom. Pick up the Sock from the floor, the Book to the

right, the Pouch on the bed and the Magic Wand in front of the mirror.

Now use the Sock with the Pouch. Use the Pouch with the Hole. You captured the

mouse? Good, talk to the mirror now. Go Up.



There are two demons here. Pick up Chemicals(centre of the screen). Use the

Chemicals on the Shield. Use the Shield with the Hook(centre of the screen).

Pick up Book(behind chemicals). Now look at BOTH Books. Now go down and talk

to the mirror again.Spy on the demons on the top floor.

Now that you know their real names you can go back Up again.



Talk to the demons for as long as it takes to offer them to return them to the

pits. Do so and they tell you how to operate the teleporter.

Step into the Teleporter and teleport out of here.



Where am I ? Your on the Enterprise, Simon. Welcome aboard. But I don't know

how to operate a starship ehh mister Spock. Oh in that case; Beam him out of

here Scotty...Aye sir, teleporting now. And so your in the fiery pits now.



Pick up the Pebble and the Sapling at your feet. Talk to the Attendant. he

gives you a Brochure. Now look at your Brochure. Use the Elastic Band with

the Sapling to turn it into a Phaser....uhh, Catapult.

Use your Catapult with the Bell and the attendant flees. Pick up the Souvenir

Matches from the counter and walk Right.



Pick up the bucket of Floor Wax here and walk Right.



Hey, Sordid id here.

Use the Magic Wand on Sordid. Now light the Pit using the Souvenir Matches.

All you have to do now is use the Magic Wand with the Lava.

Is this the END ????? Nop, not yet.



Once you've recovered from your fall go back to Sordid and use the Floor Wax

on him.



And now you can watch the end scene.........



It took me 16 hours to replay the complete game and to write and type this 

solve.



I rest my case here, STRESS !!!!!

Congrats for following this walkthrough ;)



********************************************************

Number 4



SIMON THE SORCERER



During this game you will have to do quite a bit of running around. Not all of

the places you will find are shown on the map that Simon carries around. 

You will be asked to do several things in various places and need to return 

there. In order to avoid too much "looking for places", I suggest that you

draw a map of your own.



Firstly, of course, enjoy the intro. You should definitely watch it at

least once!



When arriving in Fleur Deli you will automatically read a note from Calypso. 

Read it carefully. Open the drawer in Calypso's desk and take the scissors. 

There is a magnet on the fridge. Take it (you cannot open the fridge!) and

go outside. Behind the cottage you will find compost which will be used later.

Leave the scene to the right.



At the Blacksmith's take the rope and the clapper. This guy doesn't have time

to talk since he is hard working throughout the entire game. Walk to the right 

and talk to the dodgy geezer. He is of no use to you right now. Turn left and

take the ladder leaning against the wall. Enter the building (the entrance is 

in the middle of the picture). Pick up the cold remedy and the specimen jar. 

Leave the building and you can follow the path to the left. 



There is a funny house with a chocolate truffel door. However, you cannot do 

anything here at the moment. Walk back to the dodgy geezer and turn to the 

right. 



Enter the shop and talk to the shopkeeper(s). If you go right you will find a

place called the Drunken Druid. Inside you can pick up the matches from the 

fruit machine and talk to the Barman. Then enter the next room. These guys are 

really hard to understand but you should definitely talk to them until they tell 

you about the staff they want. Go back to the bar. Use your scissors on the 

dwarf (this poor soul will be surprised...). Exit the bar and enter the forest 

outside the village. 



Walk to the witch's house and move the handle on the well. Pick up the bucket 

of water. Then open the door and enter the house. Look around a bit. When 

you try to pick up the broom, the witch will appear and throw you out. 



Wander around in the forest until you find a tree stump. Talking to the 

woodworm reveals that they are in desperate need for some wood, preferably 

mahogany.



Now find the Barbarian and remove the thorn from his foot. He will give you

a pipe in return. 



At the Owl Tree you should pick up the feather. Talk to the owl a couple of 

times and listen carefully.



A visit to Dr. Von Jones would be good now. Although he is working in the hole,

you can talk to him and find out what he is looking for. Since Simon is a 

very helpful person, he again promises to help.



At the centre of the forest, pick up the rock with the writing on it. Wear the

beard and enter the Dwarf Mine (you know the password as it's written on the

rock!). The guard will not let you pass at this point. However, you can use

the stairs on the right and find two completely drunken dwarves. Use the 

feather on the one lying on the floor, take the key and leave the mine.



Near to the Dwarf Mine is a building with two heavy doors. Pick up the

piece of paper lying under a stone and give it to the shopkeeper(s) in the

village.

Also near the Dwarf Mine you can find the woodcutter. Unfortunately, he

has a real problem, too. If you promise to help him, he will assist you by

giving you a metal detector (Going to the right from here will bring you to a 

gorge. You can see somebody fishing but you cannot reach him from here.)

The third path leaving the Dwarf Mine area leads to a funny swampling who is

all alone on his birthday. Do him a favor and eat some of his homemade stew.

If you cannot take anymore of this delicate food, put it in your specimen jar.



Go to the Troll Bridge now. The troll is very interested in your pipe. Give it

to him and watch.



In the second part of the forest, on the other side of the bridge, you will

walk into a boy who has a problem with his beans. Use the bucket of water.

This ungrateful kid will leave and you have some beans for your inventory.



Go on to the Gorge and look down. To visit the fisher, climb down the vines

on the left. Talk to this funny guy. To help him with his dinner, provide him 

with some fine concentrated "Stew de Swamp" in your jar. He will give you his 

fishing rod so that you can catch a very special ring with it.



Go back to the crossing and walk to the castle. Use the clapper with the bell

and "Rapunzel's" hair will fall down. Climb into the window and talk to the

girl. When you kiss her, you can take a repulser back with you...



Return to Calypso's cottage and plant the beans in the compost. Take the melon.

Now go to the chocolate truffel house and let the repulser eat the door. 

Inside, pick up the hat and smokebox and walk to the beehive. Use the smokebox 

on the beehive and pick up the wax. 



At the Drunken Druid you should ask the barman for a drink. While he is 

searching for some ingredient, use the wax on the barrel. You will receive 

tickets and vouchers for free beer. On your way out put the barrel in your 

inventory. 



Go to the Dwarf Mine and wear the beard. Offer the barrel to the guard. He will 

walk down to the barrel cellar with you. Go back to the desk dwarf and walk 

down the stairs on the left. Pick up the hook and talk to the dwarf in the 

middle. Use the key on the door and then give the tickets and vouchers to the 

dwarf in the treasury. He will give you a gem in return.

 

Time to see whether or not the dodgy geezer is of any use in this game. Offer 

him the gem (get 20 gold coins for it). With this money you can buy the hammer 

and the white spirit in the shop. Outside there is a box you should open.



You will be taken to the gobblins. There is a rat bone on the floor

as well as your spell book. In the spell book you will find a piece of paper

with scribblings on it. Use the paper with the door and the rat bone with its

lock. The key will fall on the paper so that you can open the door. Pick up 

the metal bucket. You cannot pass the guard, however, walk downstairs. Pick up

the mints and talk to the druid. Since he is a little superstitious, you should 

take off the ring while talking to him. Druids can change into animals when they 

see a full moon. So put the bucket on the druid's head and show him the glowing 

rod. He will change into a frog and leave you alone. To hide from the gobblin 

troops, walk into the iron maiden and close it. You can leave it when the 

troops disappear. The frog will then return and give you a hacksaw which 

you can use to get out of this room.



Find Bard with his awful sousaphone. Use the melon on the instrument and take

if for "repair".



Visit the swampling's house again and move the box. Open the trap door and

climb down the ladder. Use the hammer and nail with the loose plank.

Pick up the frogsbane on skull island.



Near the swampling's house is a cave leading into a snowy mountain area. Use

the metal detector there and leave it where it gives you any signals. Walk on

to the sleeping giant and play the sousaphone so that he provides you with a

comfortable bridge. 



On the other side in the mountains, you will find a cave with a dragon. Since

this poor guy has a terrible cold, offer him your cold remedy. Pick up his

fire extinguisher and leave the cave. Above the cave entrance is a boulder.

You can climb up there by throwing the hook on it. Tie the magnet to yous

rope and let it down into the hole. Watch your money and stop when you can't

get any more of the dragon's gold.



Continue walking in the snow until you find a path with climbing pins. Pick

up the rock lying there. Walk on the icy edges leading to the right and go

until you find a talking tree. Use the white spirit on it and it will tell

you some magic words.



Return to the blacksmith and ask him to get the fossil out of the rock. Find

Dr. Von Jones and give the fossil to him. If you tell him that you left the

metal detector where you found the fossil, he will dig there. Follow him and

get the milrith out of the dirt.



Take the milrith to the Blacksmith, so that he can make an axe out of it.

Apparently, now is the time for Simon to fulfill some of his promises. Go to

the woodcutter and give him the axe. He will leave happily. Enter his house

and pick up the climbing pin. Use the fire extinguisher on the fireplace and 

move the hook. Enter the fireplace. You will find various types of woods, but 

unfortunately you are allergic to most of them. Pick up the mahogany and take 

it to the woodworm. They will love it so much that they get into it while it's

still in your inventory.



Go to the castle where you found "Miss Piggy". Climb up and ask the woodworm

to do you a favor on the floorboards. Use the ladder to get down. You will end 

up in front of a tomb. Open it and talk to the mummy. You will have a wedge

afterwards. Go down again and grab the loose end of the bandages. There you 

are: the staff!



Return to the village and give the staff to the wizards. After some discussion

and payment of a fee, they will make you a wizard yourself! Congratulations, 

you've made it through the first part of your quest!



While you're in the village, visit the druid and offer him your frogsbane in

return for a potion. You're all set for the witch now.



Visit her and play the game with her. She won't be fair and change into

the dragon once you have won the game and the broom. Change into a mouse and 

disappear through the mousehole in the wall.



Continue your quest at the place where the climbing pins are. Use your climbing

pin in the hole and cross the gorge.



The snowman is very unfriendly and, therefore, requires appropriate punishment.

Eat the mints and walk up to the Tower of Doom. Being a lucky guy, Simon can

use the broom to get to the door. There is a little crack in the door. Drink

the potion from the druid and walk through the crack. 



Your lovely dog will take care for you to reach a beautiful garden and will 

even provide you with a useful hair. Pick up the leaf and the pebble and walk 

into the bucket. You will find a match inside. Go on until you reach the water

and get the lily leaf. Put the match in the lily leaf, use the small leaf on 

the match and ready is your boat. Sail to the seeds and pick up one. Sail back

and use the stone with the seed to produce oil. 



ATTENTION: Before taking the next steps, you should try to sail across the

           puddle once, just to see what happens!



Put the oil on the tap and use the hair on it to open it. Now, you can sail to

the other side of the puddle. 



Go to the frog. He will nearly swallow you but he lets you out of his mouth 

again. Look into the water and catch the tadpole. You can talk to the frog now

and he will jump away. Put the tadpole back into the water and eat a 

mushroom. You're back to normal size now.



Pick up the branch and open the door. Enter the building and get the spear.

You will escape in the garden. Enter the building again and use the branch

with the monster-chest. Then take the shield.



Now go downstairs. Get the chest on the right side and go back. Then move the 

lever. Put the chest on the block and move the lever twice. Take the candles 

from the block and use the spear to get the human skull. It falls onto the 

floor from where you should pick it up.



Go upstairs into Sordid's room. Pick up the book and look at it. Take the wand

from the desk, pick up the sock and the pouch. Use the sock with the pouch and

use it with the mouse hole. You will catch a mouse.



Go further up and talk to the demons. Take the chemicals and the book. Read

the book, then use the chemicals with the shield and hang it on the hook. Walk

back to Sordid's room and talk to the mirror. If you heard the real names 

of the demons you can return upstairs.



Send the demons home. In return they will tell you something about the 

teleporter. Use it and ask to be taken to the fiery pits.



Pick up the pebble and the sapling and talk to the attendant. He will give

you some brochures. Look at them and use the elastic band with the sapling.

Aim with your catapult at the fire bell. The attendant will disappear and

you can take the souvenir matches and go into the pit. On your way to Sordid, 

pick up the floor wax.



When you see Sordid, use the wand on him. Since the pits are not on fire, use

the matches with the pit and throw the wand in it. Unfortunately, Sordid comes

back to life and wants to kill you. A phonecall will save your life. When 

Sordid is near enough, use the floor wax on him.



THAT'S IT!!!!!



Finally, have fun watching the dancing demons (it's a real demonstration)!!!
