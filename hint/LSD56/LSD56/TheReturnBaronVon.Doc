                           ---------------------


        Remove all 3 disks from the packaging. Place the first disk in
drive 0, and wait... place the other 2 disks in a safe, warm place,
(isolated from the dangerous burdens and horrors of todays civilized
society). Follow all the instructions on screen, and waggle the joystick in
glee.


                           Storyline:
                           ----------

        Once finally defeating the slimey lobes of Baron Von Sphincter, you
return on the journey home. You casually glance over your shoulder, looking
back one last time at the horror you have overcome. Baron Von Sphincter and
his army of ballistic ampendages have finally been toppled, and the
intergalactic empire of squishy maggots has been destroyed, once... but for
the final time? 
        You take the time to visit one of your best friends, a serious aid
to the survival of your last quest... a rock in your backyard. The rock,
you nicknamed Shannon.. you've been through a lot with her. This slab of
stone was your first shag. You shared a pint of lager with Shannon when you
were just a month short of 18... and that's against the law. But
fortunately, you've recovered, and are now the prime target of an even
stronger rebellion... the Baron's tonsil was saved in the firefight. He
has been putting together another army from the safety of a plexiglass case
hidden away in a secret location. Could this this final day be the last
before the army of squirming maggots return to wreak havoc on civilization?



                          Objectives:
                          -----------


        You have several tasks to solve during the game. Your ultimate
goal is to save the world from the demonic clutches of Baron Von
Sphincter's tonsil. However, you task is not so easily executed. You must
first venture through 28 fleshy levels of asthetically pleasing gloom and 
doom attempting to destroy as many of his followers using any means 
possible. On then, once you have completely the 28 levels, will you meet
the Baron's remains in an all out battle for world safety. Good luck!
