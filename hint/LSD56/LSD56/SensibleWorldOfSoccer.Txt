Dear Sensible World of Soccer Owner,

Tcha. Wouldn't you just know it? There we were, all finished and everything, 
everybody heading home, office all locked up for Christmas, when suddenly a 
small child passsing by in the street looked at us and said, "You know, I bet
you've forgotten to put a bit in the manual about that great last-minute 
new feature you put in on the manager's bench screen."
        "Blimey," we said, "the lad's not wrong, y'know. Better do it now."

THAT GREAT LAST-MINUTE NEW FEATURE WE PUT IN ON THE MANAGER'S ETC
As well as changing your formation and making substitutions when you bring up
the manager's bench during a match, you can now switch around the positions
of the players who are actually on the pitch. When the team list comes up,
just move the cursor to the relevant player's name, press fire to highlight
his name in blue, then move to the player you want to swop him with and press
fire again. Note that players who have been sent off still appear on the list,
so you can move a player into the position of the man who was sent off if he's
left you with a gap in an important place. Missus.

Okay, you can go now.
