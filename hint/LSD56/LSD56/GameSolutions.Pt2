        to the end of the level.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    GAME OVER II:

        The access code for the second stage is "11423".

        When you open a treasure chest hold down the 'HELP' key, then when
        you open a second chest hold down the 'INSERT' key.  A golden cross
        should appear, collect this and your health points should rise by
        50,000.  You will also have super shots for the remainder of the
        level.

        To avoid tricky levels, pause the game and wait for three minutes.
        Press fire and all the walls turn to exits.  This happens anyway,
        but if you pause the game, you don't lose energy, and won't get
        attacked while waiting three minutes.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    GAZZA 2:

        Once your team is ahead press the 'ESC' key to win the match.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    GENGHIS KHAN:

        If you get a land that isn't connected with an enemy, move
        everything to your home country.  The land will be safe, but if
        another leader captures a nearby land, make sure you put something
        back in or he will attack on his next turn.  Don't move all your
        forces into your command unit, or an enemy commander will wait till
        he is down to his last few men and challenge you to a one on one
        fight.  If you loose he will get half your command unit.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    *GHOSTBUSTERS II:

        Hold down 'ALT', 'CTRL', 'S', and 'U' when the activision logo
        appears and press fire.  You should have infinite lives (except on
        level 3).  This also stops the cable from breaking on level one.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    GHOST 'N' GOBLINS:

        On the high score table, enter your name as "!", maybe ")!(".  This
        will make you invicible.  Also, if you type "DELBOY" on the credit

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    GIGANOID:

        Press the 'CAPS LOCK' key on the player select screen, a message
        should appear.  Now start the game and you'll have more lives.

    *GLOBDULE: (Keith Krellwitz)
    
        During play hold down 'CTRL', 'LEFT SHIFT', 'LEFT ALT', and press
        'RIGHT ALT'.  Now use the following keys:
        
                'F3'______________Meet your quota and open exits.
                'F4'______________________________Complete level.

                '-'___Used in conjunction with 'DEL' (slow down).
                '='____Used in conjunction with 'DEL' (speed up).

        When you press 'DEL' on the main map screen you can go to any level.
        On the level map pressing 'DEL' will let go to any stage in any
        order.  Press 'DEL' during actual play lets you move any where.

                                  (LEVEL CODES)
        
            2-"HFQDASOAEZDV"    6-"HUWHNTNWEZUJ"    10-"SIWHNWUAFCDR"
            3-"HFWHASHIEZQZ"    7-"SHCOASFFEZVP"    11-"SIWHOAUAFGDR"

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------
         
    GLOBULUS:

        To activate the cheat mode type "Zvmo!EG" as a password.  Type
        exactly as shown.

        The most important thing to remember is that all the puzzles can be
        solved without losing a life, so if you lose a life and think its
        the only way to solve the screen, look closely.  Some of the puzzles
        get pretty obscure after level 10, but once you eventually beat them
        you'll kick yourself for not seeing the solution earlier.

        Look before you leap.  Think about how the screen will look from a
        flipped perspective.  A lot of jumps you make will be unnecessary
        and waste time and switches if you don't.

        Make sure you have enough switches, at least 10 per screen.  It is
        possible to get stuck on a downward slope with no way to get back up
        or kill yourself, and the only way out is to press 'ESC' and start
        the whole game over.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    GOAL:

        If one player is sent off, press the 'AMIGA' key to bring up the
        substitute screen.  Click on a substitute and then on the player
        just sent off.  Exit, and you'll notice that a sub comes out, but
        no one comes off.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    GODFATHER, THE:

        Pause the game with the 'HELP' key, then type "PIZZA HUT".  This
        will give you infinite energy.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    GODS:
            
        On level two, buy a shield and a magic potion, then get three
        fireballs and three stars.  Spend all of your remaining money on
        food and health.  Collect all the gems in the usual manner, then
        get a key and make for the exit.  Now comes the tricky bit.  When
        you descend the last ladder, two thieves will appear.  Make sure
        that you don't quite have enough energy to survive a direct
        contact!  Before going down the ladder, release your magic potion,
        then climbdown and open the door.  Stand in front of the door
        ready to leave, but don't push up yet!  Wait until the thieves
        jump down at you and as soon as they touch you push the joystick
        up.  You may loose that life, but then something rather strange
        will happen.  The bonus will start to whiz up for quite some time,
        until the game starts again on world two with 28 extra men and
        about five million points!

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    GOLDEN AXE:

        Play in one player mode but with two joysticks.  When you die, press

        seconds and you will become indestructable.  Press 'F2', 'F5', 'F4',
        'F3' one at a time for infinite everything.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    *GOLDRUNNER II:

        On the high score table, type "EASYMODE".  Press 'F9' to skip
        levels, press 'F10' for invicibility, and press 'F8' to exit cheat
        mode.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    GRAVITY FORCE:

        Instead of the normal level password enter "WARPnn".  Substitute a
        level number for 'nn'.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    GREAT GIANA SISTERS:

        To skip levels, hold down the 'A', 'R', 'M', 'I', and 'N' keys.
        On level 3 stand at the end of the row of blocks and jump up to hit

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

        start to load, then give you a level select screen.
        
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

        Pressing 'F7' during the game to skip levels.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    HARDBALL (ACCOLADE):

        VARIOUS HINTS:
 
        - Allstars are better than champs. 

        - Only steal if you actually hit the ball. 

        - Try to get a lot of runs early, as the computer team improves
          towards the end. 

        - Bunting rarely works. 

        - Halfway through the match, swap Laws for Wells and Wratten for
          Harris. 

        - The best pitchers are OLIVER, PEREZ, LEARY, COOK.  The others
          will only be successful for a short while. 

        - Never pitch fastballs to the center as they will usually
          result in home runs. 

        - Change pitchers after a few innings, because as they get
          tired, their accuracy and speed get worse.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    *HARD DRIVIN 1 AND 2:

        Get the car up to top speed the press 'N' (for nuetral).  Now you

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    HARE RAISING HAVOC:

        skip scenes.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    HARLEQUIN:

        The four heart pieces are located in the ROOFTOPS, HELL, CUTESEY
        LAND, and SHEET MUZAK

        Guide the Harlequin to the jigsaw puzzle section whilst carrying
        the space hopper.  When you fall from the kite, select the space
        hopper and jump up to the lower of the two platforms above you.
        Disengage the space hopper and jump across to the other platform,
        then leap over the low wall.  When you land, keep on firing to see
        where the ground is and move across to the point where you're
        walking on air.  Run left until you cannot go further, jump up and
        you'll hit an invisible warp.  You'll be prompted to insert disk 1,
        and now you can watch the end sequence.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    *HATE: (Keith Krellwitz)

        Pause the game and type "JUDITH".  Now press 'F10' to skip levels.
        Press 'F9' for invincibility.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    HAWKEYE:

        Pause the game, press 'DEL' and when you lost all your lives you
        will go to the next level instead of dying.  Press '2' to go back
        and fourth between stages.  Also during the game press 'HELP' and
        unpause the game for infinite lives.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    HEIMDALL:

        If your character has just been killed and you want to restore your
        weapons, magic and crew members, but forgot to save the game
        beforehand, then read on.  Go to the 'save game' option at the
        beginning of the game (where the attribute options are).  When the
        instruction to insert your saved game disk appears, click on "no"
        and you will return to the items screen with everything you had
        before you were killed.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    HELTER SKELTER:

        In a two player game, player 1 needs to get an extra life.  Then
        both players must lose all their lives.  Player two will get 99
        lives; after he loses one, so will player one.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    HERO QUEST:

        Read this, if you want to get loads of money (in the game).
        Simply get your men to complete the first mission then enter them in
        the last.  As soon as they appear, get one of them to search and
        collect the money if there's any there.  Then simply leave via the
        staircase with the money.  Keep this up until you've got enough
        money to buy the necessary equipment.  As for the artifacts that you
        can get during the game, well the same sort of thing can be done to
        acquire these.  Enter the mission, find the artifact and then get
        out.  Now just go back to the same mission and get someone else to
        pick up the the artifact in your question.  This way each of your
        characters have the top of the range weapons and armour.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    HEROES OF THE LANCE (SSI):

        SOME GENERAL TIPS:  

        Arrange your party so that the first line consists of two strong
        warriors, raistlin and goldmoon.  This allows you to use Raistlin's
        magic and the healing staff of goldmoon without too much hassle.
        Save tanis and riverwind for the later levels, where the bows come
        in handy.

        When fighting gully dwarves, use Tasslehoff who is the same height
        as them.  His sling stones will never miss.  Avoid fighting
        hatchlings, they're not worth it.  Just turn and run when you meet
        one; when you reach an intersection move into a new path and wait a
        little.  When you return, the hatchling will have gone.

        KILLING BOZAKS:  TWO METHODS:

        (1) Get raistlin to use a web, sleep or charm spell to stun it,
            then send a warrior to clobber it to death

        (2) Select Flint, who is a dwarf; 9 out of 10 times, the bozak's
            shots will go over his head; get close to enter melee combat,
            and use low thrusts to kill it.

        SPECTRAL MINIONS:  They're easy to kill, so use a warrior.

        WRAITHS:  A well-timed throw of an axe kills them every time.  If
                  you miss, use a sword and chest thrust movements.  Don't
                  let it get too close to you!

        SPIDERS:  Use low thrusts to keep them at bay.  If they get through
                  your guard, retreat until you can turn and fight again.

        The blue and green potions restore health, red slows down monsters,
        and yellow give your characters extra confidence.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    IT CAME FROM THE DESERT:

        Before attempting to go into the ants' nest, you should first save
        elmer to get more flamethrower fuel.  Some time between the 8th and
        10th (i don't remember the exact day), he will leave a note in his
        station saying that he is going hiking in the sw volcanic cone.  Go
        to the volcano, fight the ants, and next day, visit elmer's station.
        He'll thank you for saving his life and give you more flamethrower
        fuel.  The entrance to the ants' nest will never appear on the main
        map, but there are several other ways to get there:

            - By taking a flight from Hilber's field.
            - By driving a tank from a battle going on at a nearby location.
            - By going south when you are in a battle at the M1 mine.

        The entrance to the nest doesn't stay open long enough for you to
        get in before the ants start invading the various locations in the
        town, so you'll have to wait until they do.  The 11th is the best
        day to enter the hole since it is very hot and there are few ants
        around.  If you try cooler days, there will probably be too many of
        them around for you to handle.  Also, if you decide to get to the
        hole by plane, you can land safely on the dirt road parallel to the
        tracks leading to the m1 mine.

        For those who are having trouble getting to the ants hideout, it is
        located about one screen due south of mine one.  The best way to
        gain access to the tunnel is on the morning of day 11.  Go to the
        airport and get the plane.  Fly to mine one (southeast from the
        airport) and land on the road in front of mine one.  Get out of
        your plane and walk to the center of the main building of mine one.
        Walk south about one and a half screens and the hole should open
        and a ant will crawl out.  You must kill the ant and run to the
        hole before it closes.  You will get about 4 or 5 chances to get
        in.  Once you are in the hole you will automatically have the flame
        thrower and the timed dynamite charges.  There are two levels of
        the ants chambers, a top level and a bottom level.  You must make a
        map as to where you have checked.  YOu can do this by putting the
        game on pause with the left mouse button.  This will keep the ants
        off you while you draw maps.  Once you have made it to the bottom
        chamber repeat the map drawing till you find the queen ants
        chamber.  You will need it to get out after you plant the charges.
        To plant the charges once in the queens chambers move close to the
        queens left side of her body.  Once you walk around her left side
        the music will stop and a slow ticking will start.  You will have
        to get back to the place you entered on the second level. If you
        get back before the bomb goes off you will win the game.

        NOTE:

            It means nothing to gather information about the ants through
            out the game.  The mayor will not listen to anything you
            present in evidence. He will call an alert only after his car
            gets eaten on the afternoon of June 11.

            It will do no good to escape the hospital as you have to sleep
            anyway.  Even thou it will do no good to escape from the
            hospital it's a fun arcade sequence to play.

            Even with the solves given above you still must learn how to
            fly the airplane.  To get the right altitude to save fuel,
            after you take off fly east or west.  Back off the throttle
            till the shadow on the ground comes up and just touches the
            wing of the plane.  You will then have the right speed and
            altitude.  The faster you fly and the higher you go the more
            fuel you will use.  These settings will conserve enough fuel
            to let you fly and not run out of gas and return to the
            airfield and land if you blow it getting into the ant hole.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    *JAMES POND II (ROBOCOD):

        During play, type "LITTLE MERMAID" and use the following keys:
                'F'__________________Gives robocod some wings.
                'P'___________________Gives robocod the plane.

                'S'_____________________________Save position.
                'G'_____________________________GOTO POSITION.
                'K'______________________________Kill robocod.
                'M'______________________________Map selector.
                'RETURN'_________________Invincibility on/off.

                'F7'____________________________________60 Hz.
                'F9-F10'_______________________Screen effects.
        When you start the game, on the first roof you come to, above a
        sign saying "Arctic Toys" you will find five objects, which are,
        from left to right, an apple, an Earth globe, a cake, a hammer and
        a tap.  The first letters of each of these added together (AECHT)
        is an anagram of the word CHEAT.  Pick up the objects in the correct
        order (Cake, Hammer, Earth globe, Apple and Tap) to recieve an
        invincibility shield lasting 10 minutes.  When the cheat is
        activated, flashing fish form around Robocod, and the music speeds
        up.  Also, if now you go straight into the first room, and then
        exit immediately you will find that all of the castle doors have
        been unlocked, allowing you to access any level.
        
        On the sports equipment level after the second spike are five
        objects in a row, which, in order, are some Lips, a Violin, an
        Earth globe, an Ice-cream and a Snowman.  The first letter of each
        of these added together spells out LVEIS, which is an anagram of
        the word LIVES.  Collect these in the correct order (Lips, Ice
        cream, Violin, Earth and Snowman) for infinite lives.

        In some point of the game (I do not know where), there are five
        objects that spell out the word POWER. Collect them in the
        following order: Penguin, Oil, Wine, Earth and Racquet.

        Going into Map Select mode allows you to leap to various points in

            18 Level 3-4        36 Bonus Level 9

                              (SECRET ROOM LOCATIONS)
        There are two hidden worlds behind the main tower, another sweets
        level (including a Liquorice Allsorts World, the infamous Bouncing
        Jelly World, another Cake World and an upside down Jelly World)
        and an extra scrolling section. To reach them, run along the ground
        floor - avoiding the doors - then go up and over the first flight
        of stairs.  From the bottom of the second (smaller) tower, make
        your way up to the landing above Dr. Maybe's final door and run left
        into the wall.  You'll disappear behind the screen and arrive in the
        Secret Tower room.  But who is Katie? 

        Once you've  finished the bath level, drop down to the bottom of the
        castle, and walk left until you get to the small snowman statues.
        Jump on these and they'll turn into a moving platform.  Once you get
        to the top of the screen, walk left into thin air and jump.  By now
        you should be next to some doors.  Go through them for bonus city!!

        Go to the same place after finishing the circus room (the last room
        before the end of game baddy) and stand on the golden snowmen again.
        A platform made of two bonud blocks should float upwards, revealing
        a secret tunnel.  At the end of this are even more extra lives and
        stars.
    
        Do as above after the sweets level, but go to the left of the
        castle.  Go on the snowmen once more, and at the top of the screen
        grab the umbrella and collect all the goodies while you're floating
        down.

        On the second teddy bear level, keep jumping over the spikes until
        you see a hole above you.  Jump through this and catapult yourself
        off the bus there. Once you've done this, get on the higher level
        and keep walking left, bounce on the trampoline and collect the
        wings.  Now fly along the top of the screen to the right and you
        should find a different exit.  Go through this for a special bonus
        level. 

        Complete a level with does not feature a guardian and you will
        always find something new when you return to the castle "selection"
        screen.  In one case you will find a whole sequence of lifts and
        things (see above) that lead to a door that you cannot normally get
        to.  If you go to the very right of the factory screen and look down
        you will see a load of crowns, which you can access after coming
        back from other levels.

        It is possible to finish Robocod by only doing half the levels.  A
        choice of two new doors to enter is given when the correct level is
        completed.  Start by completing the Fluffy Toys one and then by
        doing the Cars one.

        Finish the bath levels and as soon as you come out of the door run
        straight to the golden snowmen in the bottom far left outside the
        castle.  Jump into these snowmen and you'll float upwards to the top
        of the screen where you'll be met by a door.  Getting through this
        door is tricky but worth it.  Inside are loads of extra lives and
        energy stars.  Go to the same place after finishing the circus room
        (the last room before the end of game baddy) and stand on the golden
        snowmen again.  A platform made of two bonus blocks ahould float
        upwards revealing a secret tunnel.  At the end of this are even more
        extra lives and stars.

        never decrease.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    KRISTAL:
            
        FIGHTS - Proficent swordplay is essential if your to get anywhere in
        the game.  The neck chop is one of the more effective blows, but the
        program blocks repetition of single moves.  To get around this,
        occassionaly switch to a differnt move in order to enable the neck
        chop once again.  Give generously to the poor and you'll be a step
        closer to obtaining the sword of the spheres.

        THE PALACE - To enter the palace, you'll need to get the invitation
        from the elusive Gloop, found in Novala.  Once you have it, keep out
        of fights or you could lose it for good.  When you get into the
        palace, ask nedrod three questions and he will give you the talisman,
        which can help you find another useful item.  Answer the princess's
        question with {ITS A SECRET}.  She will give you the ring of belz,
        which will only work in conjunction with the spell scroll.

        IN GENERAL - Objects are not always found in the same places from
        game to game, so a detailed search of both fore and backgrounds is
        often in order.  To survive the final confrontation, a high psychic
        rating is needed, which can be increased by donating skringles to
        the poor.  Disorderly conduct can have the opposite effect.  The
        safest technique in the space battles, is to slow right down as soon
        as you see the aliens shoot them all, then power at full steam until
        the next lot.  Follow readheads ship if you see it.  Heatpro tablets
        are necessary if you beam down to one of the hotter planets.  Makes
        notes of what you are told, and use any new names or subjects to
        weavel out every last bit of information from the characters.

        launchers with four rockets each, and the last two nothing at all.
        Deploy in the entrance, in the gap in the outer wall , and take the
        house to pieces with the rockets, waiting for droids or Regix to
        show up - get them with Jonlan's M4000. I managed to do the scenario
        with one shot - it went between the leaves of the door, blew up
        against a wall and Regix was on the other side. end of story, fade

    LEATHER GODDESSES OF PHOBOS:

        The answer to the Sultan's riddle is "Riddle".  To get past the
        assassin in space, fight him until he is disarmed.  Take his sword
        and give it back to him.  He will then realise that you are a good
        guy, and that he has no chance of winning.  He will then kill
        himself.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

        women.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    LEISURE SUIT LARRY:

        Hold down 'ALT' and 'X' keys to get past proof of age.  Hold down
        'ALT' and 'D'.  It will ask for a location number.  Enter a number
        form 008-045 (must be a three digit number).

        This solve did'nt get all the points, but it finishes the game.  my
        additions are in capitals.....(score 215 of 222)
         
        The 1st step is to enter the bar, go to the bathroom and read the
        walls several times until you get the password.  Then go to the sink
        and get the ring.  you can (must!) use the toilet if you want.  Go 
        to the bar and buy a whiskey.  Go to the drunk next to the bathroom
        wall and (kick him to wake him) give him the whiskey and he'll give
        you the remote control.  Get the rose too.  Go back into the bar and
        knock on the big door.. when he asks you for the password.. tell him
        "KEN SENT ME", then enter.  Turn on the T.V. with the remote.  Keep
        changing channels until you find a channel he likes..  he'll move
        from the stairs.  Climb up and voila!  The prostitute:  Don't hop
        into bed with her until you get the rubber.  You just need the candy
        on the bench.  Get it. go out the window, and go to the fire-escape
        ladder.  You'll fall into a dumpster.  Search it and get the hammer.
        Exit the dumpster and go left. Call a cab at the street.

        Now go to the casino and go through the lobby.  Get the card in the
        ashtray.  Now gamble a bit until you have about 250 dollars.  Go
        outside.  Sometime in the game when outside the casino, a guy in a
        barrel will come up and ask you to buy an apple.  Buy it.  Call the
        cab..  tell him to go to the store.  enter the store and buy a
        rubber.  Also get the (magazine and) cheap wine in the back.
        (never enter the cab with the wine..  the cabbie will get drunk and
        kill you) pay for the wine and exit..  Wait for the russian looking
        guy to come from the left. (Ignore the dog) When he comes, give him
        the wine..  not money.  (Look at phone dial number, answer the
        questions)  Once you have the knife go right and show the pass to
        the bouncer at the disco door.  Go in and sit down at the table with
        the lady.  Smile and give her the ring, the candy, and the rose.
        Ask her to dance.  When you finish off with the dancing ask her to
        marry you.  She'll ask you for $100.  Give it to her and meet her at
        the marrage chapel.  It's east of the casino front.  Enter and go up
        to the front.  Type "MARRY", and you'll get married.  Go up to the
        honeymoon suite.  (fourth floor, door with the heart, push four).
        Knock, and enter. She'll be on the bed, and {NOT IN THE MOOD!?!}
        Turn on the radio and listen to it.  You'll get a number to call to
        get the wine delivered that she wants.  Go to the casino and get
        some taxi fare money.  Go to the phone in front of the store,
        (answer the phone if it rings) call the number and have them
        deliver it to the {HONEYMOON SUITE}.  If they say it probably won't
        show up, you screwed up on the typing.  Go back to the casino and go
        to the suite.  Be sure that you have the knife.  Enter and pour the
        wine.  Things will take they're course and you'll find yourself tied
        to the bed. (THE BITCH!) Use the knife and free yourself.  Get the
        rope and leave.  Go to the casino again and using some saving, use
        the dollar and get about $50.  (go to cabaret.  find a seat and 
        sitdown. listen to act.) Once you have it, go to the bar and knock
        on the door again.  Go up the stairs and screw her now that you have
        the rubber.  Remove the rubber after you've used it.  Go out the
        window and this time go to the right of the balcony.  Tie the rope
        to yourself and tie it to the railing.  Type "GO WINDOW" or (reach
        out) something so your hanging in front of the  window on the right.
        Break the glass with the hammer.  Get the pills.  Pull on the rope
        and untie yourself.  Go down the fire escape and call a cab again.
        Go to the casino and go to the eighth floor.  Talk to the lady at
        the desk until the game tells you that you'll need some medicine or
        something.  Give her the pills.  She'll run off and leave the desk
        unguarded.  Push the button and enter the open doors on the right.
        Enter and go up and right.  When you're in the room with the bed,
        open the closet door.  Enter it and type, "LOOK".  Get the doll...
        (look at doll.  inflate doll.  look at doll. use doll.) then wait as
        you run after it.  When you're near the hottub, (remove clothes)
        enter it.  Look at the lady.  smile, and give her the apple. Things
        will then run they're course, and voila!

        First a little hint: The green diamonds are essential as these award
        you with an extra life. Some of the red diamonds will allow control
        over two bats but this is more of a hinderence as the two bats prove
        confusing.  Avoid the blue squares as they will shrink the size of
        your bat.

    LORD OF THE RINGS:

        Explore the SHIRE (starting point) Completley. There are items in
        this area the you will need later in the game.  If the game tells
        you there is a chest in a room, use the SKILL picklock, to open it.
        PIPIN TOOK has this skill.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    LOST PATROL:

        Rest for 50 minutes and for no loss of food your strength is
        restored by a few points.  This restores all of your remaining men
        to 99 percent.  Keeping up your men's strength and morale is vital.
        Giving your men 50 minutes' rest a night, or during the day when
        it's too dark to arry on, will slam your energy and morale levels
        to max.  Even if you don't have much food, you don't have to worry,
        as your men will not eat it.
        
        On reaching the first village (the first white cross on the map),
        search the area to find a hole in the ground where the villagers
        appear to be hiding.  You then have two options:  ENTER TUNNEL or
        USE GRENADES.  Gomez is useful at this point, but if he is dead, go
        for the USE GRENADES option.

        Start off questioning the villagers normally by aking them "Where
        VC?" Once you have an answer, start the hard questioning, or a
        village boy will get hold of a gun and shoot one of your men.

    MEGATRAVELER I:
            
        A quick tip to gain cash.  Find a high tech world with a low law
        level and buy as many PGMP'S as possible, although there may only
        be one initially.  Then go to a lower tech, higher law level world
        and sell the merchandise.  The ideal planets are: LLUN/EFATE (When
        using the trader character on the disk you can purchase a PGMP for
        130500 credits) and STUR/EFATE (Where not only is there a PGMP
        lying on the floor NESAR the gun shop, but they can be sold for
        244500 credits).  In no time at all and with a little cost (because

        a now-buggy, the moment you hear the missile being launched, stop
        immediately and begin to turn around.  Keep turning on the spot.
        The missile will narrowly miss you then come back and keep pace
        alongside you for a while until it finally speeds off to clobber
        someone else not so smart.
        
        Invulnerablity against mortars:  Watch for the bomber.  It will
        always come over the horizon in front of you.  If you are stopped,
        wait until it is approximately half way to you (otherwise it may be
        able to dodge your missile) then blast it.  If you are moving fast
        blast it the moment it appears over the horizon.  If the bomber does
        manage to drop mortars turn 90 degrees quickly and speed off.

    NAVY MOVES:

        The access code for part 2 is-"786169"
        
        PART 1: Move back slightly when you encounter a mine.  They're much
                less sensitive from the rear.  Avoid jetski bullets by
                jumping or ducking.  When approaching sharks, move the up
                and down nut left and right.  Octopi and sea monsters are
                easily thwarted by holding down fire until both missiles are
                ignited and then releasing.  Struggle to dock with a
                submarine?  Put a mini-sub in the gap between the tailfin
                and the hull, face the left of the screen and move upwards
                slowly, the computer takes over the docking procedure for
                you.

        PART 2: The code is 948411.
        
               Arrows indicate the direction of the lifts.  Kill white
               marines and flamethrower troops to get more ammo.  Stand over
               the body and search thoroughly.  To get the code of an
               official, you must shoot him with a gun, not a flamethrower.
               To enter computer codes, stand by a terminal, push up and
               you'll be asked for a code.  Two of the codes are:  transmit
               message: 1st or 2nd transmission official open door: 1st or
               2nd machine official to open the reactor door, use the
               terminal next to the reactor.  The computer confirms the bomb
               is planted.  Go out, use the same terminal you used to open
               the door and transmit the following: "OABERYAMD".  Now type
               "END" at the ready prompt and run like hell to the conning
               tower.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    NAVY SEALS:

        `up' towers, or "BLUESHOUSE" on the `down' towers.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    NECRIS DOME:

        Type in "SPRAY SUIT" to use the Thermo-plas suit.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    NEUROMANCER:
                    
        When you first begin, sell all your body parts.  You can get along
        just fine without them for now, and it gives you enough to get a
        half way decent deck.  You will eventually need to buy them back
        before you start entering cyber-space, or you will be killed easily.

        On other versions pause the game, and press `M'.  You should hear
        a laser gun sound.  Type "MOTHERFUCKENKIWIBASTARDS".
        Unlimited lives are yours.
    
        Near the end of level 1-1 there are three large steps that you must
        climb to reach your brother (sister?), who is in a cage.  Stand at
        the left edge of the top step, facing left and jump.  But as you
        jump, fire.  If your current weapon is arrows, fire halfway up, but
        if your weapon is bombs, fire at the top of your jump.  A whirl-wind
        should appear after four hits, and it will take you to level 1-4.

        On level 1-2 shoot the baddies and collect the blue E on the floor
        to the right.  Now hop back to the point you started at and stand on
        the last two blocks on the left side of the second floor.  Shoot
        towards the left wall while doing tiny hops, and the warp will
        appear.  This will bring you to level 1-2 where there are 2 Extend
        Life Pills

        On level 1-3 from the starting position there are 12 ledges and a
        wall to the right.  Go to the other side of the wall and fire to
        the left towards the second ledge from the bottom.  Ship required.
        This will bring you to level 2-1 near the end of the round.

        In 1-4, you will be in a little box under some water.  Go up and
        to the right, and you come out in a small room with three boxes on
        the right hand side.  Go up these, and you will see 4 long spaces,
        the top one having an {N} and a {D} in it.  Go up to the top one,
        get the letters, stand in the centre of the space, facing left, and
        fire.  yep, you guessed it, another whirl-wind.  This one takes you
        to level 2-4.

        On level 2-1 above your kiwi friend is a small tunnel which takes
        you to some stair-like ledges leading to a small cavern where
        there are two fruits.  Fire at the fruit on the right.  Ship needed 
        to reach tunnel.  This brings you to level 3-4.

        On level 2-2 find a balloon and float up to where the bears on
        balloons emerge. Stand to the right of the green left-pointing
        arrow and shoot the bears balloons away. Repeat this until the warp
        appears.  This brings you to the end of level 2-2.

        On level 2-2 there is a ledge with a green arrow pointing right.
        Jump up into the water.  This takes you to level 2-2 halfway
        through the level.

        On level 2-3 follow the first water you come to.  At the end are
        two ledges with spikes below.  Stand on one ledge and fire at the
        other.  This takes you to level 2-3 takes you halfway through the
        level.

        On level 2-4 , stand at the entrance to the room where the giant
        octopus is located and fire to the right several times.  A warp will
        appear that will take you to the beginning of level 3-1.

        On level 4-1 above the Extend Life Pills is a tunnel.  Fire above
        the 2nd letter from the right.  You must be on a duck ship for it to
        work.  This brings you to level 4-2.

        On level 4-4 below the kiwi to the left are some spikes.  Stand on
        the left hand side of them and using small jumps fire to the right.
        This brings you to level 5-1.

        When you reach the ice whale, move to the right-hand side of the
        spikes, avoid the crystals, and wait until he picks you up.  Once
        inside the whale, you can start shooting, but avoid the ice drops.

        Meeting the rock monster without bombs makes him difficult to pass.
        So collect bombs, go to the highest platform and shoot him.  Kill it
        by either dodging the bullets and hitting it when the doors open, or
        by fireballs.

        The last boss you encounter is the balloon seal.  He cant be killed,
        by blows to the body, so you must hit the balloon.  Be careful for
        the balloon seal is armed with a cannon and shoots cannon balls at
        Tiki.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    OPERATION LEMMINGS:

        To pick a level from which you can start from type "CYB Computers"
        in the high-score table.  Swearing at the high score table brings up
        a few messages as well.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    OPERATION THUNDERBOLT:

        On the high score table enter your name as "WIGAN NINJA", to recieve
        infinite lives.  Also if you get a score of 50,000 or more die and
        type "SPECCY MODE" on the high score table.  This will give you
        twice as many enemies.  Press 'F8', 'F7', 'F6', 'F5', 'F4', 'F3',
        'F8' and then 'F1' three times (oR 'F2' three times) ('F1' and 'F2'
        are for what player is to have the sight).  This will give you the
        laser sight thoughout the game.  Also, type "EDOM TAEHC" on the high
        score table for infinite lives.

        Usually you have to shoot equipment boxes to get the laser sight,
        but press 'F8' and fire at the same time on the title screen and you
        will start a 1 player game with laser sight. For 2 players press
        'F2' instead of 'F8' on the title screen.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    OPERATION WOLF:
                    
        At the end of a level, between the time when you kill the last
        bastard and the time appears, rolling the mouse down causes damage
        to decrease.  For the most accurate shot possible, pause the game
        with 'F1', position your crosshairs over the selected enemy,
        unpause the game, click the button and blast him to hell.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    *OSCAR AGA: (Keith Krellwitz)
    
        On the level select screen, enter the door marked {SCREEN 2} The
        Horror Level.  After the level has loaded and before you press the
        fire button to start the level, push up on the joystick and hold
        down 'K'.  While still holding both, press the fire button to enter
        the level.  Once the level has started you can let go of the
        joystick and the 'K' key.  Now press 'ESC' to skip levels.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------
     
    *OUT OF THIS WORLD (ANOTHER WORLD):

            "EDJI"_____IN THE LAKE          "FADK"___T-SHAPED ROCK
            "HICI"___IN THE PRISON          "KCIJ"_TEMPLE ENTRANCE

            "EDIL"____END OF CAVES          "FIEI"_______POWERLINE

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    OUTRUN:

        During play, type "RED BARCHETTA" now press any of the following:

                    'S'________________________Skip levels.
                    'T'_____________________Add 10 seconds.
                    'B'__________Restart the current level.

        Type "STARION" while playing the game.  Now use the following keys:

                    'B'______________________Extended play.
                    'S'________________________Next screen.
                    'T'___________________Extra 10 seconds.
                    'X'_______________________________Quit.
                    'D'________Save screen in Degas format.
                    'Q'_______________________Program info.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    OVER THE NET:

        First, choose a one set game, play the sea-cup and enter one team or
        two human players.  When it's your turn to serve, move the
        non-serving player up to the top of the court close to the net.
        This will force one of the computer players to follow him.  Now do a
        jump serve (push up and fire), then hit the ball to the other
        computer player by pushing right then down.  The ball should drop
        between him and the net and he should miss the ball.  Hopefully this
        plan should work.  I don't know if it works with the other teams
        like Coco, Freaks etc but it works with the Rollers and the Golden
        Boys.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    *OVERKILL AGA: (Keith Krellwitz)

        Enter "NZL" for your initials on the high score table.  When you
        restart the game you'll find you have infinite lives.
