    AAARGH!:

        At the start of each screen you'll find various buildings.  Blow
        fire over them, and then hit them.  This will make them fall down a
        lot faster.  When you burn or knock down a house you get an egg. 
        To beat the other monsters in a fight for an egg, don't jump around
        and breath fire, just hold your ground and punch forward.  After
        three or four falls, your foe will stay down.  Keep eating, even if
        it dosen't show any increase on screen, your health will skyrocket.

    ABANDONED PLACES 2:

        This cheat will increase your character's experience significantly.
        Attack and kill any single monster (or group of monsters).  When it
        (or they) begin to visibly fade away, cast any {HOLD MONSTER} spell
        that you have such as {DREAM} or {HOLD EVERYTHING}.  The creature
        will cease dimming and just sit there.  Now you can attack with
        your fighters or cast attack spells (including {FIRE AREA}).  To
        rake in experience points with no worry of the monster going
        anywhere until the spell wears off. This can be verified by
        watching the experience line in the character sheet grow while you
        are attacking the faded creature.  If you are quick enough, you can
        refreeze the monster, otherwise just go and find another one to
        repeat your trick on.

                'L'_____________Toggle infinite lives on or off.
                'I'____________Toggle invulnerability on or off.

                                (LEVEL EDITOR)
        Type 'ZANDALEE' for the level editor.  Here is how it works:
                 'ESC'__________________Return to the main menu.
                 'DEL'________Totally clears the selected depth.

                               (DESIGNING A MAZE)
        Each level consists of 3 layers, and pressing 'D' will go through
        them.  Depth 0 is where the backgrounds are designed, depth 1 is
        where the ice, mud and mines go, and depth 2 is where you actually
        design the maze. On depth 2, pressing the 'SPACEBAR' takes you to
        the block select screen, where you can select any block by pressing
        the fire button on your joystick.  This then puts you in {block}
        mode (which appears at the bottom right of the screen) where you
        can place the block by pressing fire again.
 
                              (PLACING CHARACTERS)
        Select depth 2 and press 'M' to go into "baddie" mode. Position
        both players by pressing '1' and '2' at the desired position.  You
        can toggle through the baddies using the comma ',' and full-stop
        '.' keys, and can place them using fire, or replace existing
        baddies by first selecting the space, and then adding your
        preference.  Baddie characteristics can be changed by placing the
        cursor over it and then using the arrow keys:
                'Up'_____________________Increase baddie speed.
                'left'__Decrease rate the baddies drop hazards.
                'Right'_Increase rate the baddies drop hazards.
                      (from 01 (fastest) to 99 (slowest)
                     (00 means it'll never drop anything)
                'Down'_______________Increase drop speed by 10.
        Pressing '9' will change the speed at which the baddies will then
        appear.  Once you've placed all the initial baddies, pressing
        'RETURN' takes you onto the "que" screen, where you can place up to
        50 replensished ones.  Pressing '0' will change the time between
        these baddies appearing.  Any new levels can now be saved on a
        blank disk by returning to the main menu and selecting the save
        option.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    BANE OF THE COSMIC FORGE:
            
        The password to enter the door in the SE tower of the 1st level is
        "SNOOPCHERI".  Use the rotten cheese on the mousehole.  Some small
        help for playing the game successfully: When you create your
        characters, it may be a good idea just to make all of them Dracons. 

        This is untested, but unless you have at least one of this fire
        breathing race you surely wont survive the game.  So maybe it would
        be good to have more.  Use a good mix of the classes, try to take
        one of each spell class and a good solid thief that is at full
        strength.  Get a good enough thief and you dont need a fighter.  It
        may be slow, but keep rolling till you get the best character
        possible.  Be sure to make at least one character female, there are
        places in the game where this is a must.  Don't do it and be sorry
        later!  Diversify your skills. 

        Have each character specialise in a few skills relative to his
        class.  Do not worry about developing weapons skills, you have no
        use for them if you created your party correctly.  In fights early
        in the game use DRACONS BREATH ATTACK, just be careful not to over
        extend yourself.  Rest after each encounter, backing up your hard
        work.  Always search the area after a combat.  Search each square
        you step in.  Not only this, but search facing all four directions,
        many things can only be found that way.  Thieves are not always
        true.  If you find a lock and have your thief open it, allways
        guess it is poison unless you are 100% sure (I.E. tried it before)
        because it is better to suffer something else than to die by
        getting this wrong.  Don't bash doors early in the game!  If your
        characters are not very strong you will be sorry.  Jammed doors do
        you no good, as you might never be able to open them again.  Same
        goes for picking the lock.  Wait till you get a caster capable of
        conjuring knock knock with at least 18 points (prefereably 24) and
        do it this way.  It is much more sure.  Once you know there are
        secret panels or buttons,  keep walking past them until you
        discover them.  You can find them by looking at the maps and know
        where they are, sometimes it takes awhile to sense them.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    *BANSHEE AGA: (Keith Krellwitz)

    BIO CHALLENGE:

        During play, press 'ESC' to pause the game and press 'G'.  This
        will take you to the end of the level guardian.

        LEVEL 1:  Get the green armous as soon as possible. If you have all
                of the amulet, don't go to the sphere unless you have
                collected at least four lots of monster remains, you'll
                need them to battle the end of level guardian.  He's a
                bit soft in the head, so time your jumps carefully, and
                hit him there.

        LEVEL 2:  There are four planets to visit, go to everyone if you
                want to get maximum points.  Again, the green armour is
                very useful, so get it as quickly as possible.  There's
                loads of ammo for the guardian of this level,
                unfortunetly that means there's loads of monsters to deal
                with.  The back of the guardians head is the weak spot.

        LEVEL 3:  Stand on the slabs and summersault.  There are six
                planets here, and the transporters are more difficult to
                so, so you have to watch more carefully.

        second table and crouch down just past the skulls on the floor. A
        vampire should then appear ready to be put into her coffin.  Do

        "JOOLS".  Cheat mode active will flash at the bottom of the screen
        and the ranks and abilities of your men will have increased.  It
        may be "JOOLSA".
                                        (HINTS)
        1.  In Choppas, land on the enemy to kill them, safer than landing
            and getting out.

        2.  I missions in which you have control of a lot of troopers
            seperate the lowest ranking trooper from the rest and give him
            all the weapons, make sure the rest are safe, then attempt the
            mission with one trooper.  If the trooper dies just press
            'ESC'.  This saves a lot of troopers later, such as in mission
            18 phase 5 of 5 - The Door.

        3.  Troopers are able to throw grenades quite along way and over
            walls, trees, and buildings.  Use this to your advantage to
            protect against Biggunz and Jeeps.  To throw a grenade a long
            way, simply position the pointer further than needed.

        4.  Buildings can be destroyed even if you can't see them.  For
            instance, if a trooper is in Biggun and there is a building
            slightly off the edge of the screen, roughly aim at the
            building making sure the pointer is at the very edge of the
            screen and fire.

        5.  Learn to control Jeeps and Skidooz early on (how to skid
            them).  In later levels you may need good control to hit ramps
            at correct angles otherwise you can blow up if you hit walls. 
            This is also useful to get away from shells, rockets, and
            grenades.

        6.  An effective way of destroying snipers is to just run straight
            towards them and shoot you guns.  Don't waste grenades on them
            unless it is necessary.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

        the specified planet and you can then ask GG for the co-ordinates
        of all the other aliens around, by asking "CODE INFORMATION HELP"
        if that doesn't work, replace 'HELP' with the name of an alien.

    CURSE OF THE AZURE BOND:

        See the POOL OF RADIANCE cheat.

        In case anyone was wondering, The `Wizard in Red' refers to
        Dracandros.  He is the owner of the Crescent Moon bond.  The `Woman
        in Green' refers to the leader of the Cultists of Moander.  They,
        of course, are the owners of the Mouth in the Hand bond, which is
        the symbol of the God Moander.  The `Lord of the Black' refers to
        the leader of the Zhentrim, or `Black Network', an evil alliance of
        priests, mages and thieves that operate out of Zhentil Keep.  They
        own the big `Z' in the Triangle bond.  Lastly, `The Flamed One' is,
        of course, good old Tyranthraxus.  He owns the Flaming Bond, which
        is the Symbol of Tyranthraxus.

        To defeat Tyranthraxus, you must gather the Amulet of Lathander,
        which is in Zhentil Keep, the Helm of Dragons, which is currently
        being kept by Dracandros in his castle near Haptooth, and the
        Gauntlet of Moander, which is kept by Mogion (the Woman in Green!)
        in Yulash.  You must take these items to the Pool of Radiance.

        {Bingo!} if you entered the cheat correctly.  Now, start the game
        and you'll be able to play with a range of automatic power-ups.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    *EYES OF HORUS:

        After you type in the copy protection and it says to press fire,
        type "SPAM" instead.  The game will start, and you'll have infinite
        lives and you won't need any of the keys.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    EYE OF THE BEHOLDER:
            
        Make two copies of disk 2 then make up your parties on both disks.
        Play the game as usual, but when you find any secret passages or
        walls, or unlock any doors, insert the other disk and continue
        playing for a short while.  This passes all the data onto this disk.
        Replace the original disk and continue playing and now, if you get
        stuck in the game and you have to start again, simply continue with
        the other disk and all the doors that were previously locked will
        be open. Plus, you'll be able to pick up the keys that you needed to
        unlock them as a bonus!

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    EYE OF BEHOLDER II:

        1. Load the game as normal and select "CREATE NEW PARTY". When the
           empty boxes appear, click on the top left box, then select race,
           class, alignment and portrait.  Now go to the modify box and
           boost all the statistics in this order:  STRENGTH, INTELLIGENCE,
           WISDOM, DEXTERITY, CONSTITUTION, CHARISMA, AND HIT POINTS.  Now
           you can click on strength and boost it to maximum, regardless of
           limitation put on the race or class of the character, so from now
           on, for example, you can have a super-hard wizard with a strength
           of 18/99.
        
        2. At the character generation screen, always increase all stats
           that you can (that includes hit points) to as high as they will
           go.
        
        3. If you want a mage, cleric or paladin to use a two handed weapon
           as well as magic, then do the following. Put the weapon down on
           the ground, and their spellbook or magic symbol in their second
           hand.  Click the right mouse button on this for a list of spells
           to appear.  Pick up the two handed weapon and place it in the
           characters primary hand.  As the list of spells is still up,
           they can now cast spells and use a two handed weapon at the same
           time.  You will have to repeat this process after using the
           compass etc.
           
        On the wasp level, stand on the spot where the two rooms join (the
        room to the south which has a crack in the wall - the hornet's nest)
        and rest.  This should generate four wasps which can be killed
        easily to gain experience points.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

                'F2'_________________________Back a level.
                'F3'___________________Forward ten levels.
                'F4'______________________Back ten levels.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    F-15 STRIKE EAGLE II:

        During play, press 'CTRL', 'ALT', and 'R' simutaneously to restock
        your ammunition.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    F-16 COMBAT PILOT:

        If you`re fed up with landing try the following: Jetison all fuel
        and weapons and climb to 65000ft. Stay there until the last of your
        fuel runs out.  Dive towards the ground and at 10 or 11 thousand
        feet pull up hard. You will then be able to rise about 4000 ft and
        then start falling towards the ground.  Just as you hit the ground
        the mission will end safely.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    F-117 STEALTH FIGHTER:

        Choose to run a strike mission, but don't arm your craft with any
        air to ground weaponry.  When you get a ground target, press '7' and
        'U' at the same time and the target will blow up automatically.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    F-19 STEALTH FIGHTER:

        Press 'ALT' and 'H' to get the pitch lines on your hud, fly upside
        down, turn off your engines, keep your plane about 10 degrees on
        your hud and watch that baby climb.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    F-29 RETALIATOR:

        On the enrollment enter your name as "CIARAN" then load up the
        pilots log.  THE NAME SHOULD NOW READ {OCEAN OK}.  NOW You can fly
        any mission with the huge benefit of infinite missiles and cannons.

        Also, choose "THE DIDDY MEN" for your name, click {COLONEL} icon
        and hit 'RETURN'.  Accept a mission (without selecting one) then
        go back and select a mission.  Now start the game and play as

        headquarters and blow it away!

        In mission 6, once you've fired all your missiles, you can land on
        the shadow sub (if it's still afloat) and it will refuel and rearm
        you.
    
        Select option 2 {FREE FLIGHT, NO ENEMY CONFRONTATION} from the main
        menu.  Then select zero instead of 1 to 4.  The screen will go into
        a spiral and scroll way south to 34 by 117 degrees, placing your
        plane somewhere without a runway.  This happens to be in the middle
        of edwards air force base, where the F/A-18 was flight tested.
        To take off you have to use the afterburners.  117 degrees is the
        furthest south you'll be able to fly, but you can go in other
        directions.  Is there more to this back door?

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    FALCON:

        If your ammo runs low, press 'CTRL' and 'X' during the game and 
        watch the extra 500 rounds and 9 sidewinders clock up on the
        instruments.  It maybe 'CTRL', 'L SHIFT', and 'X'.  For a perfect
        landing, hold the 'HELP' key down about 10 to 20 feet above the
        runway.

        If you get badly hit, don't bail out, instead swing round and head
        for home.  Press 'HELP' and the '+' on the keypad and keep them
        depressed.  The F16 will stay level and drop down.  Switch to
        tracking mode and rotate to side view.  Just before touch down,
        pitch up the nose and the plane will touch down successfully every
        time.  Select "end mission" and you will be rescued even if you are
        in enemy territory.

        go as slowly as you want while remaining in pole position.   

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    FEDERATION OF FREE TRADERS:

        Advancement in rank has nothing to do with the amount of credits to
        your name.  It is releated to the number of missions you complete
        and ships destroyed. The only way to earn a lot of credits is to
        haggle on the trade-net.  By staying in the space station on the
        net, and trading in guns, food and gold, you will quickly build a
        fortune.  Travelling to space stations requires you to jump until
        you cannot get any further.  Guide to completing the missions:

            MISSION 01: Take message: Just go there! Use e pod.
    
            MISSION 02: Destroy aliens, but not unknowns: Kill 4+.
                        Use E pod.

            MISSION 03: Destroy sat!

            MISSION 04: Escort convoy. Use E pod.

            MISSION 05: Investigate dissepearances. Kill 4+. USE E pod.

            MISSION 06: Search for survivors.

            MISSION 07: Escort vip. Land on planet then go to
                        destination.
