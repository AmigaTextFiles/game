                            REFERENCE CARD

Instead of cycling through your weapon choices using the <ENTER> key
you can directly access the weapon by pressing the <SHIFT> button
simultaneously with the relevant function key eg: <SHIFT> F10 access
the gun.

If you have a mouse, you can reconfigure any mouse button (two or three
button mice are compatible) to emulate the keyboard.  Just press the
<ALT> key with the required choice.  Then press the required mouse
button (left, middle or right).  For example, press <ALT> G ('G' accesses
the landing gear).  Then press the left mouse button.  From now on,
pressing the left mouse button will access the gear.

Pressing <SHIFT> '+' or '-' doubles the RPM increments and decrements.

Pressing the escape key <ESC> or CTRL Q while your aircraft is on the
ground will end the mission.
