i know its a terrible drawing..but what the hell.....

THE MIG 29 H-U-D HAS A NARROW FIELD OF VIEW.IT HAS BEEN PRAISED FOR THE MANNER
IN WHICH IT PRESENTS COMPLEX DATA IN A SIMPLE AND EASILY UNDERSTANABLE WAY..

ALTITUDE;   VERTICAL HEIGHT ABOVE THE GROUND IS SHOWN IN METRES.

AIRSPEED;   AIRSPEED IS SHOWN IN KILOMETRES PER HOUR(100KM/H = 54 KNOTS)

PITCH BARS; THE PITCH BARS STAY PARALLEL WITH THE GROUND AT ALL TIMES.YOU CAN
THEREFORE USE THEM TO RECOVER FROM UNUSUAL ALTITUDES AND TO KEEP YOUR WINGS
LEVEL WHEN THE HORIZON IS NOT VISIBLE. THE LINES ARE AT 10 DEGREE INTERVALS
WITH A CROSS AT 90 DEGREES. WHEN YOU SEE THE CROSS YOU ARE EITHER HEADING
STRAIGHT UP OR SYTRAIGHT DOWN.


                                 [PAGE 19]

VSI:(VERTICAL SPEED INDICATOR)

THIS SHOWS YOUR RATE OF CLIMB OR DESCENT.IT IS ESPECIALLY USEFUL WHEN TURNING
STEEPLY NEAR THE GROUND.THE VSI HAS TWO FIXED MARKERS IN IT,THE UPPER MARKER IS
THE CENTRE POINT(ZERO RATE OF CLIMB),THE LOWER MARKER IS THE MAXIMUM RATE OF
DESCENT WHICH THE MIG CAN TOLERATE ON LANDING.

LFD;

THE LONGTITUDINAL FUSELAGE DATUM MARKER SHOWS THE DIRECTION THE NOSE IS
POINTING.

G;

THIS SHOWS THE G-FORCE CURRENTLY ON THE MIG.THE MIG-29 SERVICE LIMIT IS
1.9,HOWEVER,THE AIRFRAME CAN WITHSTANBD CONSIDERABLY MORE.

AOA(ANGLE OF ATTACK);

THE ANGLE OF ATTACK IS THE ANGLE BETWEEN THE DIRECTION OF THE AIRFLOW
APPROACHING THE AIRCRAFT AND A LINE JOINING THE LEADING AND TRAILING EDGES OF
THE WING,FOR NORMAL FLIGHT `AOA` IS RED-LINED AT 26 DEGREES ON THE
MIG-29,HOWEVER THE AIRFRAME WILL REMAIN CONTROLABLE AT HIGHER `AOA` FOR SHORT
PERIODS OF TIME.

THE LIFT GENERATED BY THE WING IS DEPENDANT UPON THIS ANGLE,IF THE ANGLE IS TO
HIGH THE WING STALLS,LIFT IS REDUCED DRAMATICALLY AND CONTROL OF THE AIRCRAFT
MAY BE LOST.CONVENTIONAL WINGS MAY STALL AT `AOA` OF LESS THAN 20 DEGREES.

VELOCITY VECTOR;

THIS RED MARKER SHOWS THE DIRECTION IN WHICH THE MIG IS FLYING.

HEADING;

THE HORIZONTAL BAND ACROSS THE TOP OF THE HUD SHOWS THE CURRENT HEADING IN 10`S
OF DEGREES.00 IS NORTH,90 IS EAST,27 IS WEST AND 18 IS SOUTH.


                                 [PAGE 20]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WAYPOINT DIRECTION INDICATION;

THIS RED MARKER IN THE HEADING BAND SHOWS THE HEADING TO THE CURRENTLY SELECTED
WAYPOINT,TO FLY TO THE WAYPOINT YOU SHOULD TURN UNTIL THE MARKER IS DIRECTLY
ABOVE THE CENTRE TICK.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HUD ON/OFF `H`...TURNS THE DISPLAY SYSTEM ON AND OFF,WHEN THE DISPLAY IS OFF(OR
DAMAGED) A REVERSIONARY LFD WILL BE PROJECTED ONTO THE HUD.

THE COUNTER INTELLIGENSE ANALYSIS SECTION OF THE GRU HAS INTERCEPTED AMERICAN
COMMUNICATIONS TRAFFIC INDICATING THAT 2 DAYS AGO A DALLAS `BOOMER` CLASS ICBM
SUB DEVELOPED A REACTOR FAULT AND HAS HAD TO SURFACE. IT IS NOW TRAPPED IN
ICE,BUT LATEST WEATHER ESTIMATES THAT THE ICE WILL START BREAKING UP IN THE
NEXT 24 HRS. THE SUB IS TRAPPED INSIDE NATO WATERS AND CONSEQUENTLY
UNAPPROACHABLE BY ONE OF OUR RUSSIAN SEA BASED FLEET. A CONTINUING HEAVY CLOUD
LAYER PREVENTS THE USE OF SPY SATELLITES TO PHOTOGRAPH THE SUB.THIS IS TOO
VALUABLE AN OPPORTUNITY TO MISS,SO A SINGLE MIG-29 WILL BE DESPATECHED TO FILM
THE SUB. A FURTHER COMPLICATION IS BELIEVED TO BE 3 SEA HARRIER JETS OPERATING
FROM THE ICE AS AIR COVER FOR THE SUB.

MISSION: TAKE OFF FROM AIRBASE IN SIBERIA.
