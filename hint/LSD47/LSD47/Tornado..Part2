SECTION 3 - COMMAND LEVEL

At this level, you have complete command authority. At Campaign level you
had the job of turning a Task into a flightplan; at Command level you
create the Task as well. You will need to exercise all the skills you have
already learnt in mission planning and flying, but in addition you will
need to make the all important decisions about what targets to strike, and
how to divide your resources. This section assumes that you are familiar
with all the material covered in the first two sections of this chapter.

In order to select "Command" on the Flight Options page, the pilot whose
log is currently selected must be Command-qualified, holding the rank of
Wing Commander or Group Captain. When you start "Tornado" Group Captain
deFault`s log is selected and he qualifies. If you select "Command" using
the deFault log, and then call up the Pilot Log screen in order to select
another log, only the logs of Command-qualified pilots will be available.

As with the "Campaign" option, the Mission Selection Screen for Command
level presents a selection of starting scenarios, and allows you to select
any one of the three War Zones. In addition, you can save one Command game
per War Zone to reload and continue later.

The Mission Planner in Command Mode

When you commit to a Command scenario, you will see that the Mission
Planning Screen looks exactly as before except that the Map Screen Button
which used to read "Briefing" or "Task" is now titled "Command". Also, if
you click on the Flightplan button straight away, the Flightplan window
will not appear This is because you haven`t yet created any Tasks, which
can only be done by calling up the Command Window. You probably won`t be
surprised to learn that you call up the Command Window by clicking on the
Command button.

The Command Window

This window allows you to review intelligence data to help in selecting
your objectives, and then issue orders to accomplish them. It contains a
strip of buttons at the top, and its lower portion (the Priority Target
Finder) closely resembles the Target Finder called up by the Targets
button. The buttons are labelled "Situation" "Air Power" " "Relocate" and
"Tasking" and their functions are described below:

Situation

This calls up the Situation Report window, which provides a summary of the
overall military situation. Use this to make decisions about the general
nature of your operations. Are Allied ground forces so hard-pressed that
all your effort must be devoted to supporting them? Is your base airfield
threatened by advancing enemy forces? How much difference did you make
with your last strike on the enemy supply line? How effective are enemy
air operations? What`s the state of your own supply system, and what can
you do about it?

Many of the more specific questions will need to be answered with the aid
of other Command window faciiities, but the Situation Report is intended to
give you the big picture, providing a context in which to evaluate detailed
intelligence. Use it or you run the risk of winning your battles but
losing the war.

Air Power

This button calls up the Air Power window, which summarises the location
nature and strength of air force units on both sides. Data regarding enemy
forces is not guaranteed to be complete or 1OO% reliable. Use this window
to gauge the progress of the air war and guide your selection of targets
for Counter Air operations.

Relocate
 
Click on this button to call up the Relocation window, which shows
buttons corresponding to all serviceable Allied airfields. If you need to
shift the force of Tornados under your command from their current base to
another, you can do it from here. There are many possible reasons for
doing this: your base may be endangered by advancing enemy ground forces,
or under-supplied or too far from the action, or too vulnerable to enemy
air strikes.

Your current base airfield will be highlighted - to shift your Tornados to
another airfield just click on the appropriate button. Be aware of the
danger of concentrating too many Allied air resources at one base; if the
enemy mounts a powerful strike against it, he may destroy or ground a
critical proportion of your available forces in one operation. If the
enemy`s counter-air capability is destroyed or degraded, however, the risk
may be acceptable. When you use this facility to shift your base, all
flightplans for the tasks you generate in this round should be set up for
landing at the new base. Tornados landing elsewhere (including the old
base) will incur the normal time penalty for ferry flights.

Tasking

The Tasking window called up by this button allows you to allocate Tasks to
formations of Tornados, or single aircraft. Once you have created a Task,
you can create the flightplan(s) for that Task. The window shows the
number of Tornados available for operations, both IDS and ADV. When you
first call up this window in each round, one line will be displayed showing
a Mission number followed by a button showing the type of Tornado assigned,
with a Cycle button beside it. This button will initially show "None" but
by clicking on the Cycle button it may be changed to read "IDS" or "ADV"
depending upon availability of the type.

When the type is changed to something other than "None" two further buttons
appear to the right, each with a Cycle button beside it. The first shows
the number of aircraft assigned to the formation, defaulting to 1. The
associated Cycle button can be used to change the number of aircraft
between 1 and the maximum available, and as this figure is changed the
availability figure will fluctuate accordingly. You can't change the
figure to 0 but the same effect can be achieved by selecting a Type of
"None". The right most button can be used to display a description of the
mission type as a reminder of your intentions. Click on the Cycle button
to view the descriptions available, and use the most appropriate.

When you create a Task by assigning aircraft to it a mission number for a
further Task will appear on the line below, up to a maximum of four Tasks
or until all available aircraft are assigned. You may only modify aircraft
assignments for the latest Task in the list - if you change your mind and
want to modify tasks earlier in the list, you must delete all later tasks
by setting their aircraft types to None, in order from the last backwards.
You should also bear in mind that you will ALWAYS fly aircraft A in the
first Task in the list. Once a Task has been created by assigning aircraft
to it, its flightplan may also be created in the normal way by calling up
the Flightplan window. You can select which Task`s flightplan to edit by
clicking on the appropriate mission number in the Tasking window.

Priority Target Finder

This system gives you easy access to processed intelligence data, showing
you which facilities are most important to the enemy`s war effort. These
facilities should therefore be the most desirable targets. Which category
of target you set out to strike should be determined by the broader view
you gain from the Situation Report and Air Power windows. The quantity and
quality of intelligence available will govern the quantity and quality of
the evaluations provided by the Priority Target Finder. It is within your
power to improve the level of intelligence available to the Allies see
below under Comms. Parallel calculations are made from the enemy
viewpoint, to display the nearest Allied equivalent to each Priority
Target, if one exists. If it`s worth doing, do it to them before they do
it to you.

Like the Target Finder, the Priority Target Finder shows two columns; the
left being used to select a broadclass of targets, and the right to display
a complete list of all the individual items in the class. The items on the
right are each marked with one of three symbols, a tick, a cross or a
question mark. A tick indicates that intelligence can offer you targets of
this type, whereas a cross tells you that no information is available -
better intelligence is needed. A question mark indicates that intelligence
is still being evaluated - targets arent available yet, but they will be
sometime soon. When such items are ready, the symbol will change from a
question mark to a tick. Obviously, you can only select ticked items for
display on the map.

The Priority Flag markers work just like the Category Flags, they are
automatically enabled when this window is open, but when it`s closed you
can use the Key window to control whether or not they are displayed. Heres
a list of all the possible classes and items, which are significantly
different from those in the Target Finder.

Class: Command

This class selects enemy headquarters, where known, and flags the most
important. Destroying an HQ may have serious effects on the coordination
of enemy forces and the efficiency of the enemy supply system.

Command: Rear HQ

These are permanent hardened facilities normally well behind the line of
battle and very well defended. The highest level of command is found here
and a successful strike may seriously disorganise the organisation and
movement of enemy reserves and supplies. The effect on enemy forces
directly engaged at the front is real, but not immediate or direct - it may
take some time before the results are apparent.

Command: Field HQ

These are the headquarters of force commanders close to the front line.
They are normally very soft targets relying on camouflage and mobility to
avoid detection, but there will usually be local AA defences. Destroying a
Field HQ will have an immediate effect on forces engaged in battle, but
this effect may not last for long. There may be a short term gain in
intelligence as enemy message traffic increases in the attempt to
compensate for the damage to the command structure.

Class: Comms

Communications targets are important in themselves, and vital for the
potential effect on intelligence. Most of the secure communications on
both sides are routed through a limited number of sites connected by
land-lines or lines of sight. Everytime one of these centres is put out of
action message congestion increases on the remaining parts of the secure
net and installations served by the destroyed facility must resort to less
secure channels. This insecure message traffic at the very least reveals
locations, and may yield high grade intelligence. This can vastly improve
the efficiency of your operations.

Comms: Main Node

These are permanent facilities, easily recognisable by the microwave relay
tower on the site. They will normally be well defended. Each is in line
of sight with at least one other, forming a network. Priority will
normally be give to Main Mode targets which serve the battlefield area, or
which represent points where the comm. net may be cut, in order to achieve
the maximum increase in insecure message traffic. Enemy organisation and
supply may also be affected as the network is degraded.

Comms: Field Relay

These are temporary camouflaged installations providing secure
communications between the battlefield rear area and the main comm. net.
Destruction of a Field Relay should improve the yield of local intelligence
and Disrupt local command and supply to some extent

Class: Logistics

This class of targets covers the enemy supply system perhaps the most
important class of all. There`s a standard quote which says that amateurs
study tactics, professionals study logistics, and it becomes more and more
accurate as time goes on. Advances in military technology usually seem to
mean that weapons get expended faster and more vehicles use more fuel. The
days when an army could largely support itself by foraging in the local
countryside are at least a century gone; modern forces consume almost
unbelievable tonnages of stores - and always more than they planned for.

As a result of this, all roads and railways leading towards the battlefield
will be vital channels of supply - if you can cut these channels the enemys
fighting power will be very seriously reduced. Other important targets in
this category are the stockpiles at each end of the supply routes.

Logistics: POL Installations

POL is the standard military abbreviation for Petrol, Oil, Lubricants. If
stocks of these are seriously depleted, all vehicles from trucks through
tanks to aircraft will be seriously affected, though airfields normally
have large stocks on site in well-protected underground tankage. POL
installations are generally permanent and hard to hide, hence they will
almost always be well defended

Logistics: Main Depots

These are main centres of supply - major stockpiles holding huge quantities
of everything needed to supply armed forces. Take these out and the supply
pipeline will empty as stores are consumed but not replaced. You will not
totally prevent resupply, but it will be thin and intermittent. These are
large conspicuous installations with defences, usually too large to destroy
in a single attack.

Logistics: Forward Dumps

These are small, dispersed, camouflaged stockpiles which supply the needs
of local forces and are replenished in turn from the major stockpiles.
Destroying one of these should have a powerful local effect.

Logistics: Choke Points

Choke points are places where transport routes can be cut with maximum
effect and efficiency - in Tornado, all choke points are bridges. This can
be a very effective way of crippling the enemy supply system. Alternative
routes will often exist, but they will usually be longer - all supply
convoys will normally be sent by the shortest available route from A to B.

On a typical Tornado map there are a great many bridges, so this priority
facility tries to analyse enemy traffic patterns and select as targets
those bridges which are most heavily used. The value of these points is
also obvious to the enemy so these targets may well be defended.

Class: Politics

This is a miscellaneous category for targets which are not strictly
military. Some may adversely affect enemy morale, some may help preserve
allied morale. One (Decapitation) offers your best chance of bringing a
war to a quick conclusion.

Politics: Power Station

Depriving the enemy population of power may have a significant effect on
morale - provided that it is already depressed. It`s not a war-winning
move if enemy forces are doing well.

Politics: SCUD Launchers

The classical political distraction target, familiar to all Gulf War fans.
The missiles are so inaccurate that they have very limited military value
when fitted with conventional warheads, but unfortunately their effect on
civilian morale can far outweigh the little damage they`re likely to do.
In fact a city is about the smallest feasible SCUD target. The other
problem is that they`re mobile and hard to find. If you decide to go
looking for them, don`t expect to find them exactly where intelligence said
they were. SCUD-hunting is necessarily a solo exercise that you`ll have to
take on yourself, using the ground radar and the cameras and probably
flying at night.

Politics: Decapitation

A Decapitation (beheading) strike is designed to take out your enemys
political leadership, on the assumption that their successors will either
be more willing to talk, or will paralyse the military command structure by
fighting amoung themselves for power. The main prerequisite for a
Decapitation strike is really excellent intelligence - you won`t be offered
this type of target until its available.

Politics: NBC Capability

NBC is for Nuclear / Biological / Chemical weapons. If this category of
target is offered, they represent research and manufacturing sites rather
than stockpiles These weapons will never be used in the war you`re
fighting, but the destruction of the facilities might be an important
morale booster for your side.

Class: Battlefield

These targets represent places where you might directly influence the land
battle. Two of these types of target represent the (approximate) locations
of enemy AFVs (Armoured Fighting Vehicles). Don`t go for them unless the
overall situation is desperate. They`ll be very heavily defended, you`ll
need to spend time in an extremely dangerous environment looking for them,
and target recognition is difficult. When you do find a target, you`re
unlikely to be able to take out more than one small group of vehicles at a
time. The third type of target, the Repair Centre, is a much more sensible
place to strike.

Battlefield: Direct Support

These are Close Air Support targets - enemy forces in contact with allied
forces. Target recognition is critical to avoid shooting up your own
troops - and very, very difficult.

Battlefield : Reserves

As the name suggests, these are the locations of enemy armoured units in
reserve. The problem of target recognition is less important here
(provided that you know where the front line is), and the available targets
may be more concentrated. Still a risky sort of target.

Battlefield: Repair Centre

AFVs of all sorts are complex and surprisingly delicate machines. If
they`re doing anything more strenuous than standing still, they break down
regularly and require frequent specialised maintenance. When you add
battle damage repair to this maintenance load, it becomes an enormous task,
and the efficiency of the repair system has a dramatic effect on the
front-line strength Repair and maintenance take place at all levels from
units in the field up to major workshops with heavy equipment and large
stocks of spares. If you can knock out or seriously damage these major
repair centres it can have a devastating effect on enemy ground forces,
because repair of anything worse than minor breakdowns and battle damage
will slow down severely or stop altogether. Repair centres are found at
large military bases, and you can exline to the right, you should take up a heading
to the right of 090 (say 095 or 100°). Hold that until the ILS shows you
that you are close to the centreline, and then bring the heading back
towards 090. If you correct your heading in this way but find that the ILS
is not creeping back towards the centre, only then should you make a bigger
correction.

The second point to remember is that the glideslope beam (the up and down
reference) slopes down. You cannot track the glideslope centreline unless
the aircraft is descending steadily. Just as in lining up on the
localiser; the closer you get to the centreline, the more slowly you want
to approach it. We`ll deal with the classical method of using the throttle
to manage your rate of descent when we look at purely manual approaches;
here we`re going to cheat by using the Autothrottle to hold a steady speed
while you actually fly the approach path using the stick only

Don`t be Hypnotised by the Instruments

As you get closer to touchdown and the runway looms larger you should
transfer your attention from the ILS cues to the outside world. The ILS is
highly useful when the runway is distant, but in all except the very worst
visibility the last stages of the approach will be much easier to fly by
eye. It`ll also be much easier to achieve the shortest possible touchdown
and landing run.

Setting your Approach Speed

So what do we tell the Autothrottle? If you remember, approach speed is
calculated by taking stalling speed in the current configuration and adding
a percentage. Stalling speed for the Tornado depends on 1) Wind Sweep
position, 2) Flap setting and 3) Aircraft weight, so there`s a lot of scope
for variation. We give a ready reckoner approach speed table in the
Aircrew Notes, but here`s a simplified version of it predigested for three
different weights:

Recommended Approach Speeds at 25° Wingsweep

                Weight:  Flap Setting:

                    Zero  Man`vre  Mid   Full
           Light     180    172    153   135
           Medium    210    202    183   165
           Heavy     248    240    221   203


Light case:      33000lb / 15000kg - Virtually empty aircraft
Medium case:     45000lb / 20400kg - No external stores" full internal fuel
Heavy case:      60000lb / 27200kg - Near maximum take-off weight

Note that we only give figures for 25° wingsweep here. You`d never expect
to touch down with the wings in any other sweep position unless the sweep
mechanism itself jammed - we`ll try that later. While you can drastically
speed up the process of approach and landing by coming in at higher speeds
and decelerating at the last minute, don`t try it until you really know
what you`re doing.

The medium weight case is probably the most useful: set the Autothrottle
to about 210 knots to bring you within flap-limiting speeds, lower the
flaps all the way and then set 165-180 knots. Just be aware that this
won`t work if the aircraft is too heavy. If you`re carrying more weight
than this it would normally be sensible to dump some of it using the
External Stores Jettison option before starting the approach.

When setting the Autothrottle as low as this you must remember that you`re
not far above stalling speed. If you manoeuvre hard to chase the localiser
needle or point the nose high in the air to climb to the glidepath, your
airspeed may fall to the danger point.

Another way of gauging the correct approach speed is to watch the Alpha
(Angle of Attack) meter - either the HUD display or the mechanical guage
next to it. If you`re in the right speed range for an approach at your
current weight, the reading should generally be somewhere between 8 and
12°. If it`s higher than this then you`re too slow, if lower then you`re
too fast. Check the Approach & Landing Emergencies section at the end of
the Aircrew Notes for the figures to use in unusual cases.

Semi-automatic Approaches - Summing up

Provided that you understand what the ILS display is telling you, and you
can fly the aircraft to centre it in the beams ON THE RUNWAY HEADING with
the Autothrottle holding a sensible airspeed, you should arrive at the
runway threshold in good shape for touchdown. Use the Landing Practice
Setup in the Simulator until you`re confident that you can track the ILS by
hand.
 
There is one further technique you may find helpful for making small
corrections left or right to track the localiser - using the rudder
controls. We havent said much about the rudder so far, and we won`t say
much more, because in modern aircraft it`s almost redundant as a manual
control, and has a very limited effect at any but the lowest speeds. On
the approach, however it can be useful. Look up the rudder commands under
Primary Flight Controls in the Control Summary.


MANUAL APPROACHES

Once you can fly a semi-automatic approach as described above, you`ve
mastered the art of reading the ILS and acquired a feeling for the art of
correcting into the centre of the beam without overshooting. There is a
furthur challenge you may wish to take up: purely manual landings with and
without the aid of the ILS. If you can do everything we`ve discussed so
far, you should be able to handle this without too much trouble and no self
respecting pilot should ever be satisfied until (s)he can land with the
absolute minimum of artificial aids The AFDS, the Autothrottle or the
airfield ILS may be knocked out by battle damage. You may have to make an
emergency landing on a airfield, taxi track or a road. In any of these
cases you`ve got to be able to cope. If you can`t, you can only eject -
and throw away an extremely valuable aircraft

Manual Approach with ILS

Here we`re talking about flying an approach without using the Autothrottle.
Managing speed at the same time as flying the approach adds considerably to
the difficulty and demands a quite different flight technique. Normally
you think in terms of controlling speed with the throttle and controlling
rate of descent or climb by pointing the nose up or down. At the low
speeds involved in flying an approach. However, it is actually easier to
reverse this convention. Think in terms of controlling speed by raising
the nose (to slow down) or lowering the nose (to speed up) and controlling
rate of desecent by opening the throttle (to descend more slowly) or
closing the throttle (to descend faster)

Obviously there will be side the nose will usually reduce your rate of
descent as well as your airspeed, and so on, but these side effects are
actually easier to deal with using the reversed convention of airspeed,
pitch and rate of-descent: thrust. Let`s give some examples of how the
process works:

1. Speed correct, but BELOW the glideslope

You respond by throttling up to raise the engine RPM figure one or two per
cent. Now watch your airspeed. As soon as this starts rising above the
target figure, raise the nose slightly to bring the speed back on target.
The end result is that you`re still at the correct approach speed, and
you`re descending more slowly than you were.

2 Speed correct, but ABOVE the glideslope

Throttle back a little. As the airspeed drops below the target, lower the
nose a little to recover the speed.

3 ON the glideslope, but speed LOW

Lower the nose slightly, and watch for the speed to start rising. As it
reaches the correct figure, raise the nose again very slightly. If this
leaves you below the glideslope refer to example 1.

4 ON the glideslope, but speed HIGH

Raise the nose a little till the speed starts to drop. Wait till you`re
close to the target speed and then lower it a fraction to stabilise at the
new speed. If this leaves you above the glideslope, deal with the problem
as in example 2.

It`ll take a lot of practice in the Simulator before you can do this
reliably. To make your initial attempts easier, use a higher approach
speed than normal This will give you more margin for error. You`ll
probably find that the largest problem is the time lag in engine response
to throttle changes, and aircraft response to the change in thrust. For
this reason it`s best to try to avoid large changes of throttle setting
unless absolutely necessary. Having said that there`s no way to avoid one
large throttle movement: your first action in the Simulator Landing
Practice scenario should normally be to close the throttle completely (and
use airbrakes) in order to lose speed. As your speed decays towards the
chosen approach value you will need to open the throttle again, but it`s
best to do this in gradual stages, starting well above the approach speed.

Until you`ve got the feel of the situation its best to be very very
cautious and make the smallest possible control inputs. Line up on the
localiser (left-right reference) first, and then devote most of your
attention to matching the glideslope by juggling speed and rate-of-descent.
Be wary of trying to fly to a fixed rate of descent in feet per second as
shown on the HUD or the VSI; the higher your approach speed, the faster you
must descend to match the fixed 3o glideslope.

This sort of flying takes intense concentration and a thorough practical
understanding of how and why the aircraft responds to the controls. Its
very hard work. If you want a break from the grind, try some purely visual
landings (see below). But if you can learn do this. Be assured that you
could learn to land most aircraft in the real world.

Manual Landings by Eye

Purely visual landings are actually far easier than manual ILS approaches.
Once you`ve got the knack. If you`re going for a straight-in approach
(like an ILS approach) you`ll usually find that it`s best to start closer
to the airfield and higher than usual. This will improve your view of the
runway, and it will also mean that you can fly most of the approach with
the throttle more or less closed, using brief bursts of power to stretch
your glide.

You will probably also find that it`s easier if you fly most of the
approach a little faster than usual, with manoeuvre or mid flap settings
and the gear up. This means that you can drop the gear and the flaps at
the last minute as extra airbrakes, rather than hang about on the edge of
the stall point. Use the Angle of Attack to judge your approach speed.

If you`re really ambitious, you might try a standard military curved
circuit approach. Lining up on the runway from the final 180o turn is more
difficult than in real life because of the restricted and inflexlible views
available from the cockpit - something which we can`t do much about until
Virtual Reality style helmet mounted displays become commonplace.

Once you become accustomed to visual, manual landings you`ll probably find
yourself doing it this way most of the time. The ILS is a godsend in poor
visibility, but it takes a long time to fly the full distance at approach
speeds. You can put the aircraft on the ground much faster for yourself -
provided that you can see to do it.

LANDINGS AND WIND DIRECTION

Up to now we`ve more or less ignored the influence that wind speed and
direction has on landing, but in the real world it`s a major safety issue.
The "Landing Practice" Simulator exercise gives you still air, which is a
very rare situation in real life. In practice the wind direction will
dictate your take off and landing direction and the length of ground run
required.

The reason isn`t all that hard to understand. If an aircraft was flying
straight and level at an Airspeed of 150 knots directly into a
hurricane-force wind blowing at 150 knots, it would be hovering over a
point on the ground. The Airspeed Indicator shows your speed through the
air, which is itself moving over the ground as the wind blows. To take a
more realistic (though still extreme) example, an aircraft flying directly
into a 50-knot wind at an airspeed of 150 knots is actually travelling over
the ground at 100 knots. If that aircraft flew at the same airspeed (150
knots) in the same direction as the 50-knot wind it would be travelling
over the ground at 200 knots. In both cases, the wind speed and direction
make no difference to the flying qualities of the aircraft - its flying the
way you would expect it to at an airspeed of 150 knots. The difference
lies in how fast it`s covering ground.

Speed over the ground makes at least two important differences when it
comes to landing. The first is in the approach. If you`re landing into
the wind, subtracting its speed from your own, the approach will take
longer and you`ll need a lower rate of descent than you would in still air.
This may be tedious, but it`s not unsafe. If you land with the wind behind
you, adding its speed to yours, everything will happen faster and you`ll
need to descend faster than usual to stay on the glideslope. Rushing the
process is clearly not desirable.

The other (and more important) difference comes when you touch down. When
your wheels hit the runway airspeed ceases to matter (you`re no longer
flying), and groundspeed becomes all-important. Landing into the wind your
groundspeed is lower and your landing run shorter. Landing downwind your
groundspeed is higher and your braking distance increases. The choice
should be obvious.

Wind direction also matters for take-off, for similar reasons. If your
aircraft standing on the runway facing into a 20-knot wind, it need only
accelerate to a groundspeed of 130 knots before the Airspeed indicator
shows 150 knots and you can rotate to lift off. If you started with a
20-knot wind blowing past the aircraft from behind, you`d need to roll a
lot further to reach a groundspeed of 170 knots in order to have an airflow
of 150 knots over the wing. Everything which flies and has a brain takes
off and lands facing INTO wind whenever possible. If it isn`t possible,
you may be in trouble.

Crosswinds

When an airfield is built the designers do their best to line up the main
(or only) runway with the prevailing wind in the area, so that most of the
time aircraft will be able to take off and land directly into wind.
Sometimes, however, geography and financial constraints make this
impossible; the longest possible runway on the site just has to run in some
other direction. The wind is also less than 100% reliable, and will blow
from inconvenient directions at least a part of the time.

You can`t usually suspend operations altogether because the wind isnt
cooperating; you just have to make the best of it. Unless the wind is
blowing across the runway exactly at right-angles, which it very rarely
does, you can always resolve it into a component along the runway (a head
wind or tail wind), and a component across it, the crosswind (see diagram
8.21 ). When the time comes to learn about the Mission Planner; you`ll
find that there`s help available to analyse the situation and help you
select sensible take off and landing directions. Here and now we`re
concerned with how to deal with the practical results.

It shouldn`t take much reflection to decide that you want to take off and
land with a head-wind rather than a tail wind. But whatever you do, you`ll
just have to live with the crosswind component. A crosswind component at
take off will make very little difference to a heavy and powerful aircraft
like the Tornado, but a stiff crosswind will make a large difference to
your approach.

There`s a Simulator exercise called "Crosswind Landing Practice" which you
can try out. You`ll find that in order to fly a straight line down the
centre of the beam you will need to keep the nose pointing a few degrees to
the upwind side of the centreline. If you point the aircraft straight down
the beam, it`ll be blown sideways by the crosswind component. Be
especially careful at and after touchdown when flying this sort of approach
- you may need to do some brisk steering to avoid veering off the runway.
If you can afford a good long roll after touchdown, you can mitigate the
effects of a crosswind by flying a faster approach than usual. This will
mean that you can point the nose closer to your intended path. Conversely,
a slow approach with a heavy crosswind will be very difficult to fly
accurately.

LANDING DAMAGED AIRCRAFT

You can practice various emergencies quite easily in the Simulator. Want
to try a wheels up landing? Simple! Just leave the gear up. It is
possible, but you must touch down very lightly. Lighten the aircraft as
much as possible, but you a flapless landing, leave the flaps up. Pretend
that the wing sweep mechanism has failed, and try landing with 45 or 67°
sweep (check the Approach & Landing Emergencies data in the Aircrew
Reference section first!). Try a landing with the engines at idle thrust
without touching the throttles.

For a real dead-stick landing, do a maximum jettison then light up full
reheat to burn off the remaining internal fuel. Keep the aircraft at low
level and that won`t take long. When the engines flame out, zoom-climb the
aircraft to turn as much speed as you can spare into altitude. If you can
find a runway, well and good - if you can reach it. If not, it`ll have to
be a road. Try to find a stretch without bridges. Obviously the aircraft
will glide furthest in a shallow dive at 25 sweep, but that`s not saying
much - no fast jet glides well. Hold off on the flaps and the gear to the
very last minute unless you have speed or altitude to burn.

There is also a special-purpose Simulator mission called "Single Engine
Handling" - try it. If you examine the Control Summary you`ll find that
you can turn off the HUD, the MFD or the back-seat Tab displays. Flying on
the panel instruments without the HUD is difficult but possible, and an
excellent way to put some excitement back into the job of landing if you`re
beginning to find it too easy.

On Damaged Runways

Don`t forget that while you`re off trying to crater the enemy`s runways he
may visit your home airfield to return the compliment. Apart from leaving
your gear up, it`s hard to think of a more humiliating way to end an
otherwise successful mission than to land perfectly and then run the
aircraft into a hole on the roll out. Keep your eyes open on the approach,
and use the forward looking camera at night. If your runway is damaged,
you`ve either got to stop before, land after or swerve around the craters -
or land on another runway. If you dont want to divert or you can`t for
lack of fuel, you must either land on one of the long taxiways or use a
disused runway (these are the ones with white crosses at the threshold).
Provided that they haven't been damaged in the attack, these surfaces
should be perfectly suitable, though respectively narrower and shorter than
the main runway, and of course there`s no ILS. Watch out for taxying
aircraft on the taxiways and parked aircraft on the disused runways. In
the Simulator there's nothing to stop you trying a landing like this at any
time If you really want to get into the spirit of the thing you might try
attacking your own airfield and then landing - it'll give you a whole new
perspective on JP233 attacks ln the last resort you can always try landing
on a nearby road.

EMERGENCIES

Emergencies divide into two rough categories; recoverable ones which offer
some prospect of saving the aircraft as well as yourself, and those where
you must abandon the aircraft in order to save your life. The tricky part
is deciding which kind of emergency you`re facing, and doing so fast enough
to take the appropriate action in time.

Emergencies include systems failures and loss of control for any reason
We`ve already dealt with stall recovery, and suggested Simulator exercises
to practise landing with various equipment failures. If you make yourself
familiar with the controls available you can simulate and try out a great
many system failures, and the exercise can only do you good.

Here we`ll discuss three topics;jettisoning stores to lighten the aircraft
ejection and spin recovery drill. Jettisoning weight will usually mean
aborting your mission, but it will always improve the performance of the
aircraft if you still have control. Ejection is always the right response
in any of the following situations; Engine Fire, permanent loss of control
at any altitude, any loss of control at low altitude. The Tornado will
never spin unless the SPILS system is disabled or damaged, but when it does
the recovery technique is highly unconventional.

Jettison Options

There are three graduated jettison commands, and three matching lights on
the Front Panel. In increasing order of severity these are:

Jettison External Tanks only

Releases the drop tanks on your inboard pylons to save weight and drag. If
the tanks are empty then you improve performance and range at the expense
of losing re-usable tanks, the supply of which is not infinite. If the
tanks still contain fuel then the relative performance improvement will be
far greater, but you will probably have sacrificed range or endurance.
This may prevent you from completing your mission, or returning from it
safely, but if a Tornado is involved in any kind of close air combat your
chance of surviving, let alone winning is not good unless you dump as much
weight as possible.

The green Jettison light illuminates to confirm separation

Jettison Tanks and Offensive Stores

This is the option you need if hard-pressed by an enemy fighter in close
combat, or in the event of engine damage. It dumps all external stores
except AIM9L air-to-air missiles for self-defence.

The amber and green Jettison lights illuminate to confirm separation.

Jettison All External Stores and Internal Fuel down to 1000 lbs / 450 kg

This option is intended for use just before landing a damaged aircraft, if
the situation demands it. All external stores are dumped without
exception, and all internal fuel bar 1000lbs with which to complete the
approach, leaving you with an aircraft in its lightest possible powered
configuration.

The red, amber and green Jettison lights will all illuminate to confirm
that the stores are gone and the fuel dumped.

Ejection

Ejection itself is a very simple action once activated. The system thinks
for itself and does its best to maximise your chances of survival right up
to the point when it opens your parachute for you. However, it`s still up
to you to decide when to pull the handle. You must decide for yourself
whether a) the situation is so dire that you must eject now or you
definitely won`t survive, b) with the aircraft in its current attitude you
probably won`t survive ejection, or C) the aircraft will probably stay in
one piece, under control, for long enough to allow you to manoeuvre to
improve your chance to survive or avoid capture

There are two situations in which ejection is definitely the only way out.
These are an engine fire, which (for our purposes) will always result in a
catastrophic explosion within a few seconds, or a loss of control with no
prospect of recovery before the aircraft hits the ground. If and when an
engine fire is detected the warning system will go off and the condition
will be flagged on the Warning Panel in the back cockpit. Loss of control
can occur in many different ways, but you will probably be in no doubt when
it occurs. All that remains is to decide whether your chances will be
improved by waiting and normally, they wont.

The Tornado`s ejection seats, like those in almost all modern combat
aircraft have what is called a zero / zero capability the zeros are for
altitude and airspeed. In other words, you can eject from a motionless
aircraft on the ground and expect to survive. The seat contains a rocket
motor to lift you and throw you far enough away that a) your parachute has
time to deploy before you hit the ground and b) with any luck you won`t
come straight back down on top of the burning wreckage of your aircraft.
The seat is quite smart, and will do its best to tailor its response to the
situation but there are unavoidable limits to what you can expect. Because
the ejection system fires the seats upward from the cockpit, ejecting with
the aircraft inverted is suicidal at low level.

At the other end of the scale, ejection at a high Mach number is also risky
because of the appalling air blast. Another hazard is involved because
high speed usually means high altitude. The seat mechanism contains an
automatic opening device which will normally delay the deployment of your
parachute till you have fallen to a survivable altitude (10000-20000 feet
might be a common setting) and decelerated to a sensible speed. The
mechanisms involved are simple, robust and highly reliable, but they are
not immune to damage - and they are designed to fail safe. If possible.
For an automatic parachute opening device, failing safe means deploying the
parachute sooner rather than later (or not at all). All parachutes open
harder the higher the deployment altitude, and a high-speed opening at high
altitude may cause serious injury or death through opening shock (even in
the normal case this might involve a 20 G jolt), or through the risk of
anoxia and exposure on the way down.

If time and the situation allow, the best way to maximise your chances is
to eject at low speed (up to 300 knots, say) at a moderate altitude (say
10000 to 15000 feet). When all is sad and done, however, there are many
situations where ejection is the only option you have left, and if you
don`t pull the handle straight away you won`t get another chance.

SPILS, SPINS AND SPIN RECOVERY

The Tornado, like all modern combat aircraft, has a sophisticated flight
control system. In simple aircraft the pilot`s controls are directly
connected to the control surfaces of the wings and tail, which are moved
either directly by the pilot`s muscles, or by a servo system which uses
hydraulics to boost muscle power. In more sophisticated aircraft like the
Tornado, the pilot`s controls are not directly connected to the control
surfaces. Instead, the pilot uses the controls to tell the flight control
system what he wants the aircraft to do and the flight control system then
decides for itself how to move the control surfaces in order to carry out
the pilot`s command.

Without systems of this sort, modern combat aircraft could never have
achieved their current high standard of agility. They are agile because
they are unstable; a small control surface movement can produce a radical
change of attitude, and they have no inherent tendency to fly in a straight
line, or even the right way up Flying such an unstable aircraft by hand
would be like walking a tightrope in a high wind; even if you could do it,
the effort, concentration and stress would exhaust you in a few minutes.
When the flight control system is working, it constantly senses the
aircraft`s departures from the commanded flightpath and makes minor
adjustments of the control surfaces to correct them before the pilot even
has time to notice.

Extra protection is often built into such a system to enable the pilot to
manoeuvre the aircraft aggressively and confidently right up to the extreme
limits of its performance (as in air combat), while the automatics keep the
G load within the structural limits and monitor the angle of attack. If
the aircraft stalls despite all their efforts, such systems will then do
all they can to keep the aircraft stable till it regains flying speed. The
system which provides this extra safeguard in the Tornado is called SPILS,
standing for Spin Prevention and Incidence Limitation System.

Spinning

Spinning is a hazard associated with stalling. When the airflow over the
wings and the tail breaks down the aircraft is left falling through the air
rather than flying. If the aircraft is rolling or yawing (changing heading
without banking) when control is lost, a complex combination of
aerodynamic, inertial and gyroscopic forces may arise in which the whole
aircraft either rotates constantly round one or more axes (a steady spin)
or alternates between two unstable positions (an oscillatory spin). In
this situation normal flight control just doesnt exist, and the aircraft is
falling rapidly out of the sky.

Fast jets with swept wings have the most vicious spin characteristics of
any aircraft, and some are impossible to recover - all the pilot can do is
eject. When it is working, the SPILS system in the Tornado detects any
incipient spin problem at the stall point and acts to correct it before the
spin can become established. Like any other system in the aircraft,
however, the SPILS system may be disabled by combat damage or random
failure. If this happens any stall may develop into a spin - so you need
to know how to recover once the spin has started.

Spin Recovery

The Tornado`s spinning characteristics and recovery drill are unusual for
two reasons; first, it is a swing-wing aircraft and the nature of the spin
changes with wing-sweep setting; second, it is unlike most other aircraft
in that it has no aileron control surfaces on the wings, moving the tail
surfaces differentially instead. If you are an experienced pilot of other
aircraft types, DON`T ASSUME THAT YOU ALREADY KNOW THE RECOVERY DRILL!

Let`s set up the problem in the Simulator Select one of the Free Flight
(Airborne) exercises. When you arrive in the cockpit, turn off the SPILS
system. This should probably be done with the Control+I key combination,
but check with the Control Summary for your machine (Secondary Flight
Controls section). Be careful when doing this: just hit the key once,
because the control toggles SPlLS on / off and there`s no indicator apart
from the one on the wings right back panel in the back, which only
illuminates when the system fails due to damage and NOT when you switch it
off deliberately. Now sweep the wings right back to 67°" cancel
Autothrottle and go to full reheat (Slam Open twice). Let the aircraft
accelerate to high speed on the level, then cancel reheat (just Slam Shut
while in reheat). Leaving the throttles at Max. Dry power (100% RPM).
Pull the aircraft up into a near vertical climb and take your hands off the
controls.

The aircraft will zoom-climb to a high altitude, losing speed rapidly. At
about 220 knots IAS you should see the nose begin to drop in the stall.
Now apply full sideways stick - the direction doesn`t matter. Suddenly the
aircraft goes crazy - the HUD references and the instruments are all over
the place and the horizon flashes past your nose at short intervals and
strange angles. Hit F1 for an external view and you`ll see that the
aircraft is tumbling end over end in all three axes as it falls. This is
characteristic spinning behaviour when the wings are fully swept.

Now hit the Sweep Forward key twice, to bring the wings to 25 sweep. As
the wings move forward you should see the wild tumble stabilise into a
rapid rotation. If you move back to the cockpit you will see that the
horizon is now fairly stable, but the aircraft is twirling like a
propeller. In order to recover from the spin you must first identify which
way the aircraft is rotating. This one excellent reason why you should
bring the wings to 25 sweep first, because it is extremely difficult to
tell which way you`re going if the aircraft`s in a full blooded tumble.

Having identified which way you`re turning: APPLY AND HOLD FULL BACKWARD
STlCK AND PRO-SPlN AILERON! In other words, hold the stick right back and
to the side you would normally use to bank in the direction you`re already
turning. This is almost the exact opposite of the spin recovery drill used
in most aircraft, which is classically performed by centering the stick,
pushing it forward and applying opposite rudder. This classical procedure
is utterly useless in a spinning Tornado.

Having applied full backward stick and pro-spin aileron, you will need to
hold the stick in this position for a variable length of time, which will
never be less than a couple of seconds and sometimes a good deal longer.
Meanwhile watch the Altimeter and the Airspeed Indicator. Standard
Operating Procedure in the Tornado is to eject immediately if the aircraft
enters or continues a spin below 20000 (yes, twenty thousand) feet, but you
may find that you are willing to continue recovery procedures below this
height after you have some experience. The decision is entirely up to you.

In a steady spin the Airspeed Indicator will show a very low figure, far
below normal flying speeds. One of the first signs that the recovery
process is working will be a steady rise of speed. As the figure climbs
towards the normal ranges you should also see that the rotation rate is
slowing. When it stops, the aircraft is under control again, so
immediately center the stick and (if you can still afford the height loss)
push the nose down to accelerate faster.

Here`s the Spin Recovery Procedure again, in short form:

Once you realise that the aircraft is spinning:

1 Eject immediately if there is insufficient height for a recovery (say
20000 feet), otherwise monitor altitude closely throughout the recovery
process.

2 Command full forward sweep to 25°.

3 As soon as the direction of rotation is identified, apply and hold full
backward stick and pro spin aileron.

4 First sign of recovery will be a sustained increase in airspeed.

5 When rotation ceases, accelerate to a safe speed as quickly as possible

EXTERNAL VIEWS
--------------

Although "stepping outside" as you are flying along is not exactly
"authentic", a different perspective on a problem can often be useful and
let`s face it - its fun! We have included no less than six "external
views" that range from the commonplace to the spectacular. A status line
at the bottom of the screen shows your aircraft speed, altitude etc.

(a) Tracking view

Perhaps most common of all is the option to "step outside.. your cockpit"
and watch yourself fly along. When first selected, you will be positioned
immediately behind your aircraft, following at a fixed distance. If your
prefer, you may use the zoom in and out facility to adjust your perspective
at either normal or fast rate.

When you`ve had enough of looking at tailpipes, try the "adjust tracking"
controls. These allow you to swing your viewpoint around your aircraft in
either direction, quickly or slowly, to give you a full 360° outside view.
The "reset" option will position you behind the aircraft again and for good
measure we have the "toggle lo/hi" feature which puts you level with your
aircraft or slight below it.

It is worth mentioning that when you leave Tracking View, your viewpoint
and zoom level are stored so that when you next select this option your
viewpoint appears just as you left it. For example, if you wish to watch
an attack from a particular angle say looking back at your aircraft from in
front and below - you can set the viewpoint in advance, fly the attack, and
then switch to Tracking View at the moment of weapon release.

(b) Satellite view

Select this option for a bird`s eye view looking directly down onto your
aircraft. Select again and you`ll get a worm`s eye view looking up from
underneath! We do not recommend this second option when sitting on the
runway as all you will get is a close-up of the underside of the fuselage.
The plan view though is very handy when taxiing around the airfield. We
suggest that you zoom out to a reasonable height in order to see ahead of
your aircraft.

(c) Remote view

This option allows you to hop outside and watch your aircraft from a fixed
position. The viewpoint is fixed at the position of your aircraft at the
moment of selection, and turns to follow your aircraft as you manoeuvre.
This gives a superb impression of the true speed of your aircraft and is
great fun if you wish to brush up your radio control techniques but it`s
very easy to get disorientated or lose sight of yourself altogether.....

(d) Drone view

"Drones" are the numerous computer-controlled aircraft and ground vehicles
moving around the combat area simultaneously to yourself. By repeatedly
pressing "drone view select" you may observe their activity and impress
your friends. Zoom and track controls are available. You may also switch
between allied and enemy drones, aircraft or ground vehicles.

(e) Weapon view

What better way to approach a target than alongside your weapon? Again
zoom and track adjust is available. Just prior to impact, air to ground
weapons will switch to a plan view to help assess accuracy of delivery.

(f) Spectator view

Spectator view isn`t strictly a separate view mode - it`s an extra twist
you can apply to any other view mode to achieve cinematic effects. When
you select Spectator view, the viewpoint is "frozen" in space wherever it
happens to be at that moment (unless it`s already a Spectator view), while
the action carries on.

For example, you could call up the Tracking view. Move it around ahead of
the aircraft and zoom it out, then select Spectator view and watch the
aircraft approach and flash past the stationary viewpoint. If you select
Spectator view again as the aircraft passes, the view point will be frozen
at the aircraft position again, but this time watching it recede into the
distance.

You can use the track adjust controls to rotate a Spectator view, and once
you have set up the camera angle to your liking, return to the cockpit to
fly the aircraft back into shot. Selecting "restore Spectator view" will
put you back at your chosen spot to watch the effect.

If we tried to describe all the tricks you can play with Spectator view, it
would rate a substantial chapter on its own. You`ll have to experiment for
yourself and use your own imagination.

WEAPONS CONVERSION
------------------

When a pilot under training has reached the stage where flying the aircraft
to its safe limits does not demand 100% attention, it`s time to start
learning how to fight. The RAF call this phase of training Weapons
Conversion. There are two very different subjects to cover: ground attack
and air combat. In this chapter we`ll also be looking at how to use the
Tornado`s radar in both its air and ground modes, and the Radar Warning
Receiver. In the process we`ll be considering a variety of tactical and
operational problems.

AIR-TO-GROUND

The Tornado IDS was built to deliver the largest practical load of the
cheapest, simplest weapons as accurately as possible regardless of weather
and visibility. You may well be surprised at how accurately simple "dumb"
bombs can be placed by a smart bombsight. In addition, three special
grounds attack weapons are available, two of which are smart. You will
need to understand the nature of each weapon, when and why to use it, and
how to deliver it. First we`ll look at the list of air to-ground weapons

The Weapons

1000 lb. General Purpose Bomb (GPB)

A plain and simple unguided bomb, effective against a wide variety of
targets. Quite effective against a hardened target provided you can hit
it, and the blast and fragments will affect softer targets (most vehicles,
aircraft etc) over a fair radius. GP bombs are the cheapest of all major
ground-attack munitions, so large stocks are available. They also allow a
wide variety of delivery methods, so a good deal of flexibility is
available in trading off accuracy against risk. Usually delivered four at
a time.

1000 lb. Retarded Bomb (RET)

These are 1000 lb. GP bombs fitted with an alternative tail section
incorporating a braking parachute. This means that they can be dropped
safely from much lower altitudes than Gp bombs, since the aircraft is much
further ahead of the bomb by the time it hits the ground (see diagram
10.1). Minimum dropping height for Retarded Bombs is 100 feet (just enough
time for the fuse to arm), as against 1000 feet for unretarded GP bombs.
Because the retarder hit is a cheap and simple fitting for a cheap and
simple bomb, they are usually in good supply.

1000 lb. Laser Guided Bombs (LGB)

The original "smart" bomb. This is actually another special kit fitting
for a standard bomb carcase, providing a nose assembly containing the laser
seeker and control surfaces, and a tail with flip-out cruciform wings
giving it the ability to glide further than a standard bomb. LGB are used
in conjunction with the launching aircraft`s TIALD system. The navigator
slews and zooms his camera view to place the aiming crosshairs on the
precise point he wants to hit, which is illuminated by the laser designator
in the TIALD system. The seeker in the nose of the LGB "sees" the spot of
reflected laser light and tilts the bomb`s nose control surfaces to steer
towards it. Phenomenal accuracy is possible - missing the target spot by
as much as five feet would be a very poor performance.

This degree of accuracy makes laser-guided bombs the ideal weapon against
hardened installations or major bridges, which must be hit with extreme
precision to cause more than superficial damage. The downside is that the
designating aircraft must fly quite slowly at medium-to-high altitude in a
fairly straight line for twenty to thirty seconds in order to keep its
designator on the target till the bomb hits, and if there is cloud in the
way the laser couldnt illuminate the target even if the TIALD operator
could see it. Laser guidance kits are not cheap, and therefore not all
that plentiful, but on the other hand, few weapons are as efficient and
cost-effective; use it properly and every bomb scores a direct hit.

BL755 Cluster Bomb

Looks like a plain bomb, though less well streamlined is actually a casing
for many smaller bombs (submunitions). After dropping, the case splits
open at a preset height (set at 150 feet in Tornado) and ejects the
submunitions in a dense cloud. If properly delivered, a salvo of four will
devastate all but the hardest targets in a "footprint" perhaps 100 feet
across by 300 feet long. This is the weapon of choice against groups of
vehicles or parked aircraft. Its main drawback is that it must be
delivered from about 200 feet for maximum effect (see diagram 10.2)

JP,233 Dispensers

This is the mother and father of all runway-attack systems, the Tornado
version comprising two giant pods weighing a total of nearly five tons!
The pods contain two types of submunition: 60 large (56 lb.) SG.357 runway
penetrators and 430 small HB.876 "area-denial" mines" both types parachute
retarded. As the aircraft overflies the runway, the submunitions are
continuously ejected in a stream. When the runway-penetrators reach the
surface, a shaped charge punches a small hole right through the concrete
and a second charge is then fired into the hole, exploding beneath to crack
and "heave" the surface over as wide an area as possible. This type of
damage is far more difficult and time- consuming to repair than a simple
crater. Meanwhile the smaller mines land softly, discard their parachutes
and spring upright, deterring and delaying repair through the deadly danger
they present to men and vehicles.

JP.233 will make a really impressive mess of any runway if used properly.
Its main disadvantage is the fact that the delivering aircraft has to
overfly the target at low level holding a straight course for the four
seconds needed to dispense the whole load - manoeuvering strews the things
all over the place! It is also a Heavy, draggy load for the aircraft,
though the pods jettison automatically when empty.

ALARM (Air Launched Anti-Radiation Missile)

ALARM is probably the most capable and sophisticated missile of its type
currently in service (the US Tacit Rainbow project had even more ambitious
aims, but died the death of a thousand budget cuts). Like any other anti
radiation missile ALARM homes on the transmissions of enemy ground radars
(EWR, search, SAM or AAA radars, for example) in order to destroy them, but
it is far more resourceful than most

ALARM has many different operating modes, some of which are classified but
we have implemented two which seem most characteristic and useful. One is
a simple Direct mode, allowing ALARM to be used like any other anti radar
missile. In the other mode (Indirect) ALARM can be launched at distant
suspected targets before you reach them or they see you. When the target
is reached, the missile will zoom-climb to a point high above it, shut down
its rocket motor (if it`s still burning) and deploy a parachute. It then
loiters nose down, descending slowly and scanning the ground beneath. If
any hostile radar is switched on, ALARM jettisons the parachute and falls
on the target like a guided bomb.

Weapon Packages and the Stores Management Display (SMD)

Weapons for ground attack are grouped together in "Package". One package
contains all the weapons intended for one target, which will be released
together as a salvo. You might, for example, load a package of four
retarded bombs for a planned attack on airfield installations, and a second
package of two BL 755 to attack targets of opportunity. The maximum number
of weapons in a single package is four, and all must be of the same type if
they werent the bombsight would lose its accuracy because different weapons
have different ballistic properties.

The content and status of any weapon Packages loaded can be seen on the
Stores Management Display (SMD), bottom centre in the rear panel, where
each of the top three lines can describe a single package. Suppose that
the top line reads:

X GPB1000x4 LFT

This specifies from left to right the target, if any, for which the package
is intended (X). The type of weapon (GPBl 000), the number in the package
(x4) and the Delivery Mode selected (LFT). The Delivery Mode specifies
whether you intend to use manual or automatic release, a laydown or loft
trajectory a laser guided attack. Some weapons, like JP.233, have only one
delivery mode available. Others, like GP bombs, offer several options.
When you start your attack run and flip the "arm air to ground weapon"
switch. the HUD will display different aiming cues according to the
delivery mode selected. We will explore the various delivery mode options
later, in detail.

Packages are created at the Mission Planning stage, either when you plan an
attack on a specific target, or when you use the Payload window to create
packages to use against Targets of Opportunity. If you planned attacks on
two targets (X and Y) in one mission, and then loaded one more package for
opportunity targets. When you looked at the SMD the first line would show
the package for target X. The second line the package for target Y, and
the third line the Target of Opportunity package, with a dash ("-") on the
left rather than a letter.

The currently selected Package is shown highlighted. When you turn the
arming switch on, this is the package that will be used in the attack, and
the appropriate line on the SMD will flash continuously. When the package
is released the Arm status cancels itself, the HUD resets to its normal nav
mode the package disappears from the SMD and the next package is selected
and highlighted, ready to be armed.

You may override both the assignment of packages and the delivery modes,
attacking any target with any package, using any delivery mode suitable for
the weapons in the package. Hitting the K key will select and highlight
the next package down the list, or skip from the last to the first.
Hitting the L key will cycle through the available delivery modes for the
currently selected package. You cannot do either of these things when the
arming switch is on - if you want to change package or delivery mode you
must hit "Cancel Arm" first.

The Delivery Modes

This section provides a brief summary description of the various methods of
placing freefall bombs on the target. After this familiarisation, we`ll go
through a complete hands-on exercise with each weapon and mode in turn.

Manual (SMD shows MAN)

This is a simple "point and shoot" system intended for snap attacks on
targets of opportunity. The HUD provides a bombsight, but aiming and
release are entirely manual.

GP bombs, retarded bombs, BL755 and laser guided bombs (unguided) can all
use manual delivery.

Laydown (SMD shows LAY)

Targets for this delivery mode must be entered into the navigation systems,
either at the mission planning stage or "on the fly" using the Ground radar
or the Scrollable Map display. The HUD shows the bombsight and a marker
over the target, and the attack run can be flown manually or under AFDS
control. The exact moment of weapon release is automatically calculated
but the weapons cannot be released unless one of the crew is holding down
the Commit button.

Strictly speaking, a laydown delivery means releasing the bombs with the
aircraft flying straight and level, but the bombsight systems will handle
dive attacks or shallow lofts perfectly well in this mode.

GP bombs, retarded bombs, BL.755 and laser-guided bombs (unguided) can all
be delivered in Laydown mode

Loft (SMD shows LFT)

Targets for loft attacks must be known to the nav systems. As for Laydown
mode. This type of attack is sometimes also called "toss-bombing", because
the bombs are thrown rather than dropped. The aircraft starts its attack
run a good way out from the target, and while it is still miles away it
pulls sharply up into a climb. The bombs are released in the climb and the
aircraft is free to go while the bombs fly on for several miles, rising and
then falling onto the target in a trajectory like that of a long-range
artillery shell. The bombsight cues on the HUD are quite different from
the Manual or Laydown sights, and the attack profile can only be flown
manually - unfortunately the AFDS can`t fly the pull up for you. Release
is automatic, but only permitted if the Commit button is held down.

BL 755 cluster bombs are too aerodynamically "unclean" to be lofted
accurately and lofting retarded bombs would make about as much sense as
trying to pole vault with a ball and chain round your ankle, so Loft
delivery is only available for GP bombs and (unguided) laser guided bombs.

Laser-Guided (SMD shows LGB)

An LGB attack is run entirely by the navigator, who must use the TIALD
system to aim the laser designator at the precise spot he wants to hit.
The laser guided bombs are normally released in level flight at over 20000
feet, in order to allow the TIALD system the widest possible view, and
after release they aim themselves at the laser illuminated spot on the
target. The aircraft is normally flown by the AFDS for this type of
attack, but target designation and the release of the bombs can only be
performed manually.

Unsurprisingly, this delivery mode can only be used for laser-guided bombs.

WEAPONS TRAINING IN THE SIMULATOR

The Simulator provides the ideal environment for practicing any kind of
attack. You can start in mid-air, not far from the target, and there is
even an "infinite weapons" option which instantly replenishes any package
used. Select the Simulator from the Flight options, and look through the
options on the Mission Selection Screen until you find the mission titles
with the letters TWCU - for Tornado Weapons Conversion Unit. Select the
first of these, titled "IDS - TWCU Freefall Bombs". Make sure that the
Simulator Options switch for infinite Weapons is ON. Now Commit, and you
will move straight to the aircraft in flight. Engage the AFDS in Track
mode - you will find yourself Terrain-Following at a ride height of 1000
feet.

Switch to the back seat and you will see from the Track display on the left
Tab that the aircraft is approaching the Initial Point for an attack on
target X. On the SMD you will see that the first package is selected; four
GP bombs for Laydown delivery There are two other packages loaded, one with
two retarded bombs, and one with two BL.755 cluster bombs. For the moment,
we`re going to attack target X as planned, with the four GP bombs.

Laydown Attack (LAY on SMD)

Laydown bombing is "traditional" bombing, where the aircraft flies more or
less straight and level over the target to release its bombs. Lining up on
the target is the responsibility of the pilot (or the AFDS in Track mode),
but the exact moment of bomb release is controlled automatically by the
bombsight. The automatic release will not occur, however, unless the pilot
or navigator permits it by holding down the Commit button. Laydown bombing
is potentially very accurate at low level, since most pilots find it quite
easy to line the aircraft up on the target, whereas judging the exact
moment of release by eye is difficult to do consistently.

Wait until the aircraft passes the Initial Point and starts turning towards
X. The first thing to do is hit the "arm air-to ground" switch, which you
can do from either seat. From the back seat, you`ll see the selected
package on the SMD start flashing. In the front seat you`ll see the Late
Arm Switch cover raised, and the HUD mode will change to show the Bomb Fall
Line, the CCIP (Continuously Computed Impact Point), and the Target Marker,
which may well be partly hidden behind the Bomb Fall Line (see diagram 10,4
to find out which is which).

For the moment the autopilot has control, but to do this manually, your
first step would be to line up the Bomb Fall Line so that it passes through
the Target Marker. The upper end of the Bomb Fall Line provides you with a
Safety Height Cue. So that the aircraft isn`t damaged by flying debris as
the bomb goes off, You can see how this works in diagram 10.5. If you
can`t see the Bomb Fall Line at all, you"re far too low - it's disappeared
off the bottom edge of the HUD! The ideal minimum height attack is flown
with the top of the line right in the centre of the Target Marker, but for
now you might want to allow the normal training safety margin, with the
Target Marker in the gap below the top of the Bomb Fall Line.

The CCIP is the other element of the bombsight symbology. The point where
the CCIP line crosses the Bomb Fall Line is the point where a bomb would
hit if released now. In Laydown attacks, the release is automatic when the
CCIP reaches the Target Marker, but the symbol serves to show you how close
you are to release. Shortly before the CCIP reaches the Target Marker, you
must press and hold the Commit button to permit the automatic release.
When release takes place, the HUD changes back to normal navigation mode,
and the Late Arm Switch flips back down.

If you hit the Weapon View key just after bomb release you`ll be able to
enjoy a bomb`s eye view of the approaching target, followed by a plan view
at impact. It`s a good idea to ensure that the aircraft is in a sensible
autopilot mode before you go sightseeing.

Having flown the attack under automatic pilot in order to see what it
should look like, try it again manually. You can quit and restart, or turn
the aircraft around and come back to X, or you can use the Scrollable Map
to set up a Target of Opportunity waypoint to attack (don`t forget to
select T). If you want to make another pass on X, you`ll need to hop into
the back cockpit and check that waypoint X is still the currently selected
(highlighted) waypoint. If it isnt, use the skip to next waypoint, key to
cycle round until it is. For each fresh attack you`ll need to hit the
arming switch to arm the release system and call up the bombsight
symbology. Because you`ve selected Infinite Weapons, you wont need to make
any new selections on the SMD - your GP bombs will be replaced the moment
they`re dropped.

Once you`re comfortable with the bombsight, try the same attack with
retarded bombs and BL.755 cluster bombs. Just use the K key to highlight
the right package, but remember that you can`t do this while the arming
switch is ON.

The main difference you`ll notice is that the Safety Heights for these two
weapons are much lower than for GP bombs.

We talked in Advanced Flying Training about how to set a Target of
Opportunity waypoint using the Scrollable map. There are two other ways to
set a ToO waypoint, one of which is to use the Ground Radar, which we`ll
look at here.

Designating a Target of Opportunity on the Ground Radar

This can be done from the front or back seat. Hit the R key to turn on the
radar and show the radar image on the centre MFD. This is not a pure radar
image but a synthetic composite. The landscape and fixed objects known, to
the digital map system are always shown in dim green shades. When the
radar detects an object which is not in the map database it displays it as
a bright green dot. This is especially useful for finding vehicles
(including SAM and AAA defences) and trains. Note that the radar can`t see
through hills. In the dead ground, behind a crest the display will show
you only stored map data.

The mouse is used to control a designator cross which can be moved around
the display check that the MFD`s green Mouse Active light is on, and if
not, use the Tab key to turn it on. Just as with the Local Map display,
the radar display can be zoomed in or out by clicking left or right mouse
buttons with the Ctrl key held down, and targets are designated by clicking
left or cancelled by clicking right.

Remember that using the ground radar may draw the attention of the enemy,
if he hasn`t already seen you. If you select another MFD display while the
radar is on, there is a warning light on the panel to remind you that your
radar is still transmitting. Always turn the radar off if you don`t need
it.

Manual Delivery (MAN on SMD)

This is a simple "point-and-shoot" system intended for snap attacks on
targets of opportunity when there is no time to designate or the target is
moving. The HUD displays the Bomb Fall Line and the CCIP (Continuously
Computed Impact Point) across it, showing where the bombsight thinks your
bombs would go if released at this moment. No Target Marker is shown,
because you haven`t told the navigation systems where the target is. You
just fly the aircraft to place your visually selected target at the
intersection of the two lines, and then press the Commit button to drop the
bombs. The important difference between the symbology used here and in the
Laydown mode is in the way you interpret the Safety Height cue. In Laydown
mode you compare the top of the Bomb Fall Line with the position of the
Target Marker, but in Manual mode there is no target marker, so you compare
the top of the Bomb Fall Line with the position of the CCIP (see diagram
10.6). At low level you can achieve quite reasonable accuracy in Manual
mode, but it`s not exactty precision bombing.

To change the delivery mode; go to the back cockpit and highlight the
package you want to use using the K key, then hit the L key repeatedly to
cycle throught the delivery mode options for that package until you reach
MAN. As with any weapon delivery mode, you must Arm before you can drop
the package.

Loft Delivery (LFT on SMD)

A Loft attack (you might have heard this called toss bombing.) also
requires that the target position should be known to the navigation
systems. A Loft attack comes in two phases; in the first you run in at low
level and fairly high speed starting a good distance (say 10 miles) from
the target; you line up the Bomb Fall Line with the Target Marker and wait
for a 'countdown clock' on the HUD to count down to zero. When that
happens, the second phase starts as the HUD changes to display a "rubber
triangle" steering cue and another countdown clock. You pull up into a
climb, trying to place the cross at the apex of the triangle (the Apex
Marker) in the centre of the aircraft datum ring. As you do, the clock
winds down. When it reaches zero the bombs are released (provided that the
Commit button is down) and you are free to get the aircraft out of the way.
The bombs fly on, rising to the top of a long arc and then curving down on
or near the target.

In a typical Loft attack, an aircraft running in at 550 knots at 200 feet
would start its pull-up about five or six miles from the target and release
its bombs just below 1000 feet, climbing at an angle of just over 20o -
still four or five miles from the target. The bombs would take about 20-25
seconds to reach the target, climbing to 8-9000 feet before they start to
descend.

In a Loft attack, the bombs travel a very long way from the release point
with no form of guidance, so absolute accuracy can`t be guaranteed. In
practice, however, you`ll be amazed at how much accuracy is possible.
Nonetheless, Loft bombing is not recommended for precision attacks. The
great advantage of this form of attack is that the aircraft need not
overfly the target, and may never even come within range of its defences.

Restart the Simulator "Freefall Bombs" mission, engage AFDS Track mode and
switch to the back cockpit. The first package, (four GP bombs) is already
selected and the delivery mode is shown as LAY. Hit the L key to cycle
around the delivery options until the display shows LFT. When the aircraft
turns to run in on target waypoint X, hit the arming switch. The HUD will
now show the Target Marker, a solid Bomb Fall Line, and a Countdown Clock
slowly unwinding anti-clockwise around the Aircraft Datum. Use the Bomb
Fall Line to line up on the Target Marker, or let the AFDS do it in Track
Mode, and whether manually or under AFDS, set your altitude to about 200
feet and your airspeed to about 550 knots. The Clock is counting down to
the point where you start pulling up into a climb in order to loft the
bombs. This point, the Pull up Point, is constantly recalculated on the
basis of range to the target, speed (the faster you`reflying the further
you can throw the bomb) and altitude (the higher you are, the furthur the
bomb will fly). The Pull-up Point is determined by the maximum range at
which your lofted bombs could reach the target if released at your current
height and speed in a 45° climb. This is the climb angle at which you
would achieve the theoretical maximum range.

As the Countdown Clock approaches zero, stand by when the Pull up Point is
reached. The HUD symbology changes, to show another Countdown Clock and a
"RubberTriangle" steering cue. The Clock shows the difference between the
range to the target, and the distance your bombs would be thrown if you
released them now. The steering cue directs you to pull up and steer left
or right as necessary to stay lined up with the target; the small cross
(the Apex Marker) moves up and down, left and right relative to the
Aircraft Datum, the base line of the triangle is fixed and the middle
horizontal line is drawn halfway between the two, skewing right or left as
the Apex Marker moves. The position of the Apex Marker in relation to the
Aircraft Datum tells you which way to steer - when you`re pointed exactly
the right way, the Apex Marker is in the exact centre of the ring of the
Aircraft Datum.

Assuming that you are still well lined up on the target, the Apex Marker
will be directly above the centre of the Aircraft Datum, telling you to
pull straight up If you`ve flown this far under AFDS control, now is the
time to cancel it. Pull back firmly on the stick, and hold it back - the
standard practice is to pull up at about 3.5 G. As the aircraft pitches up
and starts climbing you will see the Countdown Clock run down rapidly as
your bomb throw distance increases, and the Apex Marker will also move down
closer to the ring centre. Both of these signs tell you that you`re
getting closer to the release point. You may also see the Apex Marker
deflecting sideways. If it does, bank towards it to line up again, but
dont overshoot on the correction. When the Clock and the Apex Marker are
indicating that you`re nearly at release, hold down the Commit button and
let the stick come forward to the neutral centre position . At the moment
of release the HUD reverts to normal nav mode symbology and the Arm status
cancels as for any other delivery mode. Diagram 1O.1O shows a complete
sequence of HUD images for a loft attack, from the start of the run through
to just before release.

Accuracy in a Loft Attack

As with any other form of attack you must line up exactly on the target
before release, but because the bombs travel so far in a loft attack any
directional error will result in a miss by a correspondingly large margin.
If you can see any heading error at all you must correct it before release
or your bombs will be wasted.

The other great factor in loft accuracy is the pitch rate just before
release. Remember that the bombs will be automatically released the
instant that the throw distance is equal to or greater than the range to
the target. The bombsight computer repeats its calculations for bomb throw
distance at very frequent intervals, but each calculation takes time. If
you are pulling up steeply, the throw distances from successive
calculations go up by leaps and bounds and the throw distance at release
may overshoot the target by hundreds of feet. Diagram 1O.11A illustrates
this problem, by showing how the predicted bomb trajectory and impact point
change at half-second intervals through a pull up. You should be able to
see that accuracy in these circumstances is a matter of blind luck. If
instead you let the stick come forward as the release point approaches
diagram 1O-11S, the throw distance still increases as the aircraft climbs.
but it increases in much smaller steps. The resulting release will stand a
far better chance of being accurate in range.

Recovery and Escape after a Loft Attack

The moment the bombs are released you`re free to turn the aircraft away
from the target and its defences, and you also want to avoid climbing so
high that you`re exposed as an easy SAM or AAA target. While the exact
profile of your escape manoeuvre will vary according to what you plan to do
next, a standard procedure for recovery might go like this;

1 Cancel Reheat

This reduces your heat signature, and reduces your chance of attracting a
SAM

2 Roll to 135o, pull hard

You need to turn hard and get the nose down at the same time

3 As the nose passes below the horizon; roll to 90o bank

You`ve stopped the climb, and the nose will continue to drop as you turn
away at the maximum possible rate.

4 As the nose passes 5o pitch down; roll to 60o bank

Pointing the nose at the ground at high speed and low level is a risky
business you need to ensure that you can pull out of your dive at a moments
notice

Delivering Laser-Guided Bombs (LGB on SMD)

This must be done using the TIALD system. TIALD stands for Thermal Imaging
And Laser Designation. Rushed from development into service in time for
the latter stages of the Gulf War, it provides TV and Imaging Infra-red
cameras plus a laser designator mounted together in a swivelling eyeball.
In its original form this is mounted on an external pod providing services
and attachment points to make the system suitable for fitting to almost any
aircraft (at the 1992 Farnborough AirShow it was on display attached to a
prototype Sukhoi Su 35!) but it is proposed to make the scanning head an
integral installation on the Tornado GR4.

You can only laser designate what the TIALD head under the aircraft can see
and the higher you are, the further you can see. We suggest an altitude of
about 23OOO feet. As with Loft attacks, a long run-in is desirable (say 6
miles or more) but we want a moderate-to-low speed (say 250 knots IAS). An
LGB attack is executed entirely from the navigator`s seat, with the
aircraft under AFDS control.

Select and commit to the Simulator Mission "TWCU - LGB Attack". This
places you in flight at 23000 feet, heading toward a Target Waypoint X on
an airfield Having assured yourself that the aircraft is heading in the
right direction at the right speed under the AFDS, switch to the back seat.
Looking at the Stores Management Display you will see that you have one
package of three LGB loaded, with the Delivery mode set to LGB. Use the
"Right Tab Function Select" key to cycle through the right Tab display
options till you see a downward looking camera view (infra-red at night,
visible light in daytime) with boxed crosshairs in the centre. This is the
TIALD view. Check that the green light in the corner of the right Tab is
on, indicating that mouse control is active on that display. If it isnt
hit the TAB key once or twice until it is on.
 
You will now find that moving the mouse scrolls the camera image in the
corresponding direction, but there are limits to the field of view. The
direction of the aircraft`s movement is always up the screen, so that the
image will rotate as the aircraft turns. Push the mouse forward so that
you are looking at the forward edge of the camera`s coverage, which is
where approaching targets will first appear, and sweep the field of view
from side to side. The TIALD image can be zoomed by holding down the Ctrl
key and moving the mouse forward or back. When zooming, the image locks on
the point at the centre of the display, compensating for the aircraft`s
movement, unless the trailing edge of the camera coverage catches up and
pushes it forward.

Zoom out as far as possible and move the view forward and backward between
the leading and trailing edges of the available area, watching the centre
symbol of the display. You should see that when the view centre is near
the forward edge of coverage (ahead of the aircraft) the centre cross
symbol is surrounded by square brackets, which disappear when the view is
centred nearer the trailing edge (behind the aircraft). While the square
brackets are shown, you could drop a bomb and continue to designate the
current centre spot long enough for the bomb to reach the ground. If the
square brackets are absent the spot in the centre of the camera view would
be too far behind the aircraft for you to keep it illuminated till the bomb
hit.

Use a wide zoom to search for some recognisable feature in the forward half
of the available camera coverage and then click the left mouse button.
This locks the view and the laser designator on the point at the centre of
the image, and sets the Target of Opportunity waypoint T at this point.
Now zoom in closer While you are locked on, you may finely adjust the
designator spot by moving the mouse while holding down the left mouse
button. It is normally best to do this in several stages, starting with a
wide zoom, placing the point, zooming in closer and adjusting position,
then closer for a further adjustment until you are satisfied that the laser
spot is on the precise point you wish to hit. Clicking the right mouse
button cancels the lock, letting the camera view roll forward over the
ground at the aircraft`s speed.

Use the D key to cycle display options on the centre MFD you`re looking at
the Local Map display (with the dotted orientation line down the centre).
Hit the 0 (letter "o") key to switch the map origin (the aircraft position)
from the centre of the MFD down to the bottom centre, so that you can see
ahead as far as possible. As the aircraft approaches Target Waypoint X you
will be able to see it marked on the map, which will help you locate it in
the TIALD image.

When the target airfield starts to appear at the leading edge of the TIALD
view start zooming in to find a target -for the moment. Any target will
do. Dont bother to place the lock precisely for the moment, just set it
somewhere in the general area of the target. Hit the arming switch and
release the package immediately with the Commit button. This triggers
immediate release of the first bomb. The arming status will not cancel
automatically until the package is empty. This allows you to release a
second and a third bomb manually at intervals of several seconds. In this
way you can either make repeated attacks on one difficult target or guide
each bomb in turn to a different target. An interval of four seconds
between bombs is a good choice for closely spaced targets.

It will be at least 20 seconds before the first bomb reaches the ground
from this altitude, and you can use this time to zoom in and refine the
position of the designator spot. When you`re satisfied with this, zoom out
a little to give yourself a more general view. When the bomb arrives you
will probably be able to see it flash into view before striking the target.
If you don`t change anything a few seconds later the second bomb will
strike the same spot, followed by the third.

Normally a "slow ripple" of LGB like this would be used to strike multiple
targets clustered in a group a HAS (Hardened Aircraft Shelter) complex
would be a classic example. It is simply a matter of shifting the spot
quickly after each bomb strikes. There are limits to how fast the bombs
can manueuvre, so the successive targets cannot be too far apart. If you
wished to strike widely separated targets, you would need a longer interval
between releases.

Delivering JP.233

Apart from the risks you run flying straight and level through the middle
of an airfield`s defences, the trickiest aspect of a JP.233 attack is
ensuring that your attack run is lined up accurately to put the maximum
number of craters in the desired section of runway. This should normally
be catered for at the Mission Planning stage, but be aware that very
accurate flying will be required to deliver the attack precisely as
planned.

Select the Simulator Mission "TWCU - JP.233" and start it up. You should
be approaching the Initial Point of your attack run on Target Waypoint X at
500 knots, at 200 feet. When the aircraft starts its turn to line up on
the target, hit the arming switch. You will see a solid Bomb Fall Line
with no Safety Height cue, the Target Marker and the CCIP. As usual, the
idea is to lay the Bomb fall Line over the Target Marker - with the added
complication that you must try to ensure that your course towards the
Release Point matches the direction of the runway under attack. The
problem is effectively identical to the problem of lining up for a landing
approach, and learning to cope with either one of these problems should
mean that you can handle both.

As the CCIP approaches the Target Marker, hold down the Commit button.
Release starts automatically and continues till all submunitions are
dispensed. Starting from the moment of release, the HUD will display a
Countdown clock This counts down through the four seconds necessary to
dispense the full load. Remember that any radical turn will spray
submunitions in a wide curve You may notice vibration and noise while the
release continues.

When all submunitions are gone, the HUD reverts to nav mode and the
dispenser pods are automatically jettisoned - you may notice the bump as
these go. Now it`s time to get the hell out of here! If you ever wanted a
good excuse to fly very, very low and fast you have it now. No-one but the
enemy will complain.

ALARM Attack

Hard data on ALARM is scarce and some of what there is looks deliberately
misleading. The most detailed documentation we`ve seen describes four
different operating modes, but claims that there are others still
classified. We have provided for two different modes of operation which
seem to us to be among the most useful of those claimed for the real
missile, and modified some of the figures quoted

ALARMS are loaded and managed in packages like all other ground attack
stores, and Direct (DIR) or Indirect (IND) mode operation is selected using
the normal select delivery mode, key.

Launching ALARM - Direct mode (DIR on SMD)

Direct mode provides for a defensive snap shot in response to a sudden
threat in front of you, the missile taking targetting information from the
Radar Warning Receiver. In this mode ALARM behaves very much like a
conventional anti radiation missile such as the AGM-78 Standard ARM or
AGM-88 HARM

In order to launch an ALARM in this mode you must first select a package of
ALARMs. Set the delivery mode to DIR, then hit "arm air-to-ground weapon".
The HUD symbology will change to show a Boresight Marker in place of the
aircraft datum, and the ground radar emitter most directly in front of the
nose (within an angle of plus or minus 45o) will automatically be
designated as the target. The standard Ground Target Marker will be shown
on the HUD, and a Range Clock centred on the Boresight Marker will indicate
the range to this target. Maximum reading of the Range Clock is 40000
metres (130000 feet or 21.5n.m.). If there is more than one hostile ground
radar showing on the Radar Warning Receiver (RWR), swinging the aircraft
nose left or right will automatically switch the designation to whichever
is most directly in front.

Once the target is designated, hitting the Fire / Commit button will launch
a single ALARM from the selected package on a direct trajectory. Provided
that the ALARM package is not empty, the arm status will not cancel
automatically on launch. If you want to disarm in order to select Indirect
mode, or another weapon package, you`ll need to do this manually with the
"Cancel Arm" key combination. When the package is empty, however, the
arming status will cancel automatically and the next package on the SMD
will be selected by default. If there is no ground radar on the RWR within
45° on either side of the nose, no target will be designated and you will
not be permitted to launch in Direct mode.

When launched in Direct Mode an ALARM will normally fly a direct trajectory
to the target, accelerating to about Mach 2 while the motor burns and then
coasting and slowing down. If the range is excessive and the missiles
speed drops below a given threshold before it reaches the target, the
missile will go into a zoom-climb to convert all its remaining speed into
altitude, then deploy the parachute and scan for a target beneath, as
described below for Indirect mode operation.

Launching ALARM - Indirect mode (IND on SMD)

In order to launch an ALARM in this mode you must first select a package of
ALARMs, Set the delivery mode to IND, then hit "arm air-to-ground weapon"
The target will be the currently-selected waypoint, whether from the stored
flightplan or a Target-of-Opportunity. The HUD symbology is identical to
that provided in ALARM Direct mode, showing a Ground Target Marker and a
Range Clock with the same calibration, subject to the same condition that
the target must be within 45° of the nose on one side or the other.

Once the system is armed and a valid target exists, each press of the Fire
/ Commit button will immediately launch one ALARM at the target. The Arm
status will not automatically cancel while there are still ALARMs left in
the selected package.

After launch, each missile will cruise toward the target at medium
altitude. Shortly before the target is reached, the missile will execute a
zoom climb to about 10000 feet and deploy its parachute. It then hangs
nose-down over the target, scanning for hostile radar emission. When it
finds one (or more) active radars, it will select the one most directly
beneath, cut away the parachute and drop on it as a guided bomb. If no
target has appeared by the time the missile has descended to 1000 feet, it
will cut away and drop unguided to the ground

If the missile is fired at a target beyond effective range, and it detects
that its speed has dropped below a threshold value, it will zoom-climb and
loiter wherever it happens to be at that point. If a threat radar is
detected beneath, it will attack it as normal.

SAMs and AAA, Tactics for ALARM

Radar is used by SAM (Surface-to-Air Missile) launchers, and AAA (Anti
Aircraft Artillery) vehicles, both to look for targets and to direct fire,
thus ALARM can be used against either - provided you can persuade or trick
them into switching on.

In Tornado, we assume that only search radars are left permanently on. SAM
and AAA radars will be switched on quite late as an aircraft approaches.
By the time they appear on your Radar Warning Receiver (RWR) your almost
within maximum range of a SAM. While your flightplans will, of course, try
to avoid known threats wherever possible, you will inevitably run across
unexpected, unmapped threats from time to time. It`s always sensible to
assume that any target worth hitting is also worth defending, whether or
not there are any known threats in the area. Defences around the planned
target are an unavoidable risk.

As always, you`ll have to balance risk and reward in deciding how to handle
the problem. If you use Ground radar, the mobile SAM and AAA units will
show up on it but so will all other types of ground vehicle. Ground radar
cant see through hills, so you`re still subject to the occasional
unpleasant surprise as you pass over the crest. Using Ground radar will
also make you more conspicuous and easier to find, but if you know that
you`ve already been detected or that help is available, you may consider
that it`s worth the extra risk

When an unexpected threat appears on your RWR you`ve got to make a choice
from among the following options: avoid it or face it: shoot at it or
rely on defensive measures such as ECM, manoeuvre, chaff and flares. If
you decide to shoot back, ALARM in Direct mode is by far the safest weapon
to use. All other available weapons and modes of attack would require you
to approach the target closely, flying in a more or less straight line.
We`ll discuss deflection shooting in detail later on, but take it on trust
that it`s far easier for a gun or a missile to hit an approaching (or
receding) target than one which is flying past a good way off to the side.

If you want to use ALARM in Direct mode to shoot your way out of unexpected
trouble, you`d better have it armed and ready so that all you have to do is
hit the Fire button. In the time needed to set up a launch from astanding
start you`d probably have flown straight past the threat, for better or
worse. See also the section below on ECM (Electronic Counter Measures).

ALARM`s Indirect mode is designed for use against known or suspected
defences which you can`t avoid. They might be the defences around your
planned target, or the optimum route to or from your target mihe quality and quantity of digital map data have
also been drastically improved, and the processing power now available can
be used to analyse and present more data, more usefully, in less time.

The GR1`s navigation systems combine automatic dead-reckoning and inertial
navigation to keep track of the aircraft`s position with a high degree of
accuracy. But even so, the calculated position "drifts" over time. It
needs to be checked by the navigator at intervals, and brought back into
line with reality In the GR4 this realignment is performed by TRN, using
only the data from the radar altimeter, which is designed to be as close to
undetectable as a radar can be. A radar altimeter, which only transmits
straight down, is inherently a lot stealthier than a Terrain Following
radar, which must look forward.

Because the GR4`s navigation system holds a digital terrain map, and always
knows precisely where the aircraft is, it can "look ahead" on the digital
map in order to follow the terrain.

Terrain Following with the AFDS - a demonstration

Select the Simulator, and call up the IDS - Free Flight (from Runway)
option Select "Take Off" in the Mission Planner, and once you`re in the
cockpit, get the aircraft off the ground. Fly straight ahead (a heading of
270), and once you`ve cleaned the aircraft up for cruising flight, engage
the Autothrottle with a speed setting of about 420 knots. Now climb
straight ahead to about 2000 feet. When you get there, hit the F9 key to
put the AFDS into Terrain Follow (TF) mode. You`ll see the mode change on
the AFDS MFD display and the ALT status will change to 1500 RIDE (maintain
a Ride Height of 1500 feet). If you look at the HUD altimeter, you`ll see
that a letter T has appeared below the digital altitude figure, which is
prefixed by the letter R to show that this is a radar altitude (height
above ground) rather than a barometric altitude (height above sea - or flat
ground - level).

If you`re over hills, you`ll see that the aircraft is now pitching up and
down under automatic control to maintain 1500 feet above ground, as closely
as it can. if you`re not above hills at the moment, look about to find
some, and use left or right Control Stick movements to set the Heading
Acquire figure to steer towards them, just as you would in Altitude /
Heading Acquire mode. Moving the stick forwards or backwards will change
the Ride Height figure, which can be set to 1500, 1000, 750, 500, 400, 300
or 200 feet. Set the Ride Height down to 200 feet by stages, pausing
briefly each time to let the aircraft stabilise at the new Ride Height

As you reach about 500 feet you`ll notice that the E Scope (the display
above and to the left of the MFD) is starting to show an undulating green
zone in its Bottom section. As the Ride Height is reduced further, the
green zone will rise up the display. The zone represents the profile of
the ground directly ahead of the aircraft, shown relative to the fixed mark
on the left-hand side of the display As the aircraft moves, the ground
profile shown in the E-Scope scrolls in on the right and out on the left.
This data the TF system is using to decide whether it must climb to clear a
ridge, or can dive to take advantage of a valley.

Now set the Autothrottle to a higher speed, say 550 knots, not forgetting
to adjust wing sweep as necessary and try to find some more hills. As the
aircraft`s speed increases, so the TF system needs to look further ahead
for obstacles. The vertical scale of the E-Scope remains the same, but the
horizontal scale changes to compress a greater distance into the fixed
width of the display, this means in effect is that the slopes start to look
steeper The faster you go, the more dramatic the effect becomes.

The TF sysfem is smart and trustworthy, but it does have limits. The
faster the aircraft flies, the more difficult it is to follow the ground
closely, and the more dangerous it becomes to do so. The system allows
itself a margin of error below the set Ride Height, and flashes the B risk
indicator (a red light below the E Scope) when it exceeds that margin. If
the B risk indicator is flashing frequently, you should either slow down or
increase the Ride Height if the situation allows. There is also an
absolute limit below the safety margin. If the radar altitude falls this
low, the system goes into panic reaction. It instantly rolls the wings
level and pulls up hard away from the ground, then automatically disengages
itself and sounds a warning to tell you.

The emergency pull-up is intended to save you if possible, but it may not
be triggered until it`s too late. It is not guaranteed to save your life.
If you want to try it out, find a long stretch of level ground free from
tall obstructions and very carefully fly the aircraft by hand down to 100
feet or less. When you`ve done this, engage TF mode and the system should
trigger an emergency pull up immediately. As you engaged it, the TF system
automatically selected the nearest Ride Height (200 feet) and found that it
was below the absolute safety limit.

Quite apart from the fact that it can`t be guaranteed to prevent you from
flying into a steep hillside at high speed, there is another excellent
reason to avoid relying on the emergency pull-up. The reason you're
Terrain-Following in the first place is to avoid drawing the enemy`s
attention, and a Tornado rocketing upwards like a scared pheasant is bound
to attract it!

MAPS, THE MFD AND THE TAB DISPLAYS

Because the navigation displays and systems are powerful, comprehensive and
quite complex, there`s a lot of material to cover, so you`ll probably want
to use Pause frequently, or even restart the whole exercise at intervals.
As an incentive to wade through this stuff; when you`ve absorbed it you`ll
be able to tell the aircraft to fly itself to any point on the map by
simply pointing with the mouse and clicking. To get things started, select
Simulator, and the Free Flight - Airborne mission and commit. Engage the
AFDS in Altitude / Heading Acquire mode, so that you hold your current
heading of 270° (due West).

Full-Screen Moving Map

To call up the Full-Screen Moving Map hit the M key(check with the Control
Summary). As the name suggests, this uses the entire screen area to
display a map. The map scrolls automatically to keep the aircraft in the
centre, shown as a symbol surrounded by a compass rose with North marked.
The map also rotates as the aircraft turns, so that the direction of flight
is always straight up the screen.

Because of the large size, this map covers a larger area and offers better
resolution than any of the other map displays available in the cockpit.
You can also zoom in and out - check the Control Summary to find out how to
do it. To go from this display to any other view, just hit the key for the
view you want.

Multi-Function Display (MFD) Modes

Shift to the front cockpit view. By repeatedly hitting the MFD Function
Select key (probably D) you can cycle through a variety of displays. The
full list of possible MFD displays is as follows:

1. AFDS / Autothrottle Status Display

You`ve already seen this display. It will be available whenever AFDS or
Autothrottle are engaged. Engaging either will automatically select this
MFD display, though you can still select any other available display using
MFD Function Select.

2. ILS Display

This display is available at any time. but it will only become active when
you are inside the ILS coverage of an allied airfield and pointing in the
general direction of the runway. For details, see the section on
Semi-automatic and Manual landings later in this chapter.

3. Local Map Display

Available at all times, and covered in detail below. Users of slower
computers may want to use this display only from the Back cockpit since it
requires heavy processing and may have a visible effect on the frame update
rate. The impact is much less when the map is zoomed in to show smaller
areas.

4. Forward-Looking Camera

Available on the back seat MFD at all times, but only at night on the Front
Panel. Displays a normal full-colour image in daytime, and an image -
intensified view at night. When used in the front cockpit it may visibly
slow the frame update rate.

5. Ground Radar Display (IDS only)

Available only when the radar is on, and in Ground mode. This is a
synthetic composite display combining digital map data and radar returns.
Returns from objects not found in the map database are shown as bright dots
- this is a good way of locating vehicles or trains. Ground Radar can be
used to designate targets of opportunity, and is covered in detail in the
Weapons Conversion chapter. This is another power-hungry display, but like
the Local Map Display it is less demanding when the range setting is short,
and of course it can be used from the back cockpit without visible impact
on the frame rate.

6. Air Radar Display

Available only when the radar is on, and in Air mode. This is a plan
display showing aircraft detected in a fan-shaped volume in front of your
Tornado Short and medium range settings are available in both IDS and ADV
aircraft but only the ADV radar offers the long-range setting. Allied and
Enemy aircraft are distinguished by different symbols, and the display can
be used to designate targets in air combat. Air Radar is covered in detail
in the Weapons Conversion chapter.

7 Display Unavailable/MFD damaged

If a particular display is not available because of equipment failure you
may see a green diagonal cross substituted for the normal display. The MFD
itself may also suffer damage, in which case the disp!ay will degenerate
into noise If you find this annoying, you can turn the MFD off altogether.


The Local Map Display in detail

Use the MFD Function Select key to Bring up the Local Map Display. Like
the Full screen Moving Map, this display rotates as the aircraft turns so
that the aircraft always points straight up the screen - as shown by the
vertical line of dots projecting the current heading. Also like the
Full-Screen Moving Map, this map scrolls to keep your current position in
the same place on the screen, but you have two Map Origin Modes giving some
choice as to where the display will be centred.

When you first see this display it will show the aircraft`s position at the
centre of the screen, with the dotted line extending from there to the top.
This is the Centre Origin mode, which lets you see the area Behind as well
as in front of the aircraft. Hitting the Map Origin Select key (probably
D), will switch to Base Origin mode, which puts the aircraft position at
the bottom of the display in the centre. The dotted line now extends from
top to bottom of the display. Base Origin mode allows you to see further
ahead of the aircraft. Hitting the Map Origin Select Key will always
switch from one mode to the other. The map can Be zoomed in or out in
either of these modes (see the Control Summary under Local Map Zoom).

Into the Back Cockpit: TV Tab Displays

Because of the restricted size of the MFD, the Local Map is intended for
short range orientation and navigation only. For serious work we need to
shift to the back cockpit, where the Navigator / Weapon System Officer
works. Here there are three displays side by side. The centre display is
an MFD just like the one on the Front Panel, with all the same display
modes available plus a daytime forward camera view. The larger displays on
either side are known as the Tab displays. This peculiar name is short for
TV Tabulator (a relic of early computer equipment nomenclature), but they
are simply a larger form of multi - function display

Look up Left Tab Function Select and Right Tab Function Select (probably
the [and] keys), which are used to cycle each screen through its range of
displays. Some of these are unique to the Tab displays, and some are
shared with the central MFD. To save you time in cycling through the
options for any of the three displays, you will only be offered display
modes which are not already shown on another screen, e.g. if you select
the Local Map on the right Tab display, you will find that the MFD will not
offer this display if you cycle through its options. Similarly, you can
never have the same display on Both Tabs at the same time. Use the MFD
Function Select key to bring up the AFDS display which is not available on
the Tab screens (remember that you wont see this unless the AFDS or the
Autothrottle are engaged). This will ensure that the full range of Tab
displays are available for you to see.

In the bottom left corner of each of the three displays is a green light
which only ever illuminates on one display at a time. This light is used
to show which display currently has use of the mouse as an input device,
and pressing the Select Active Display key (probably T) will switch the
mouse from one display to the next in a continuous cycle. For the moment,
make sure that the right Tab`s green light is on.

Now use the Right Tab Function Select key to cycle through the available
displays. Between the modes available on the right Tab screen, and the one
displayed on the Left Tab screen, you should find all of the following:

1. Forward Looking Camera

Exactly like the corresponding MFD display, But larger and more useful.

2. TIALD lmage

TIALD stands for Thermal Imaging And Laser Designation, and this mode is
unique to the Tab displays. This is the view from a steerable downward
looking camera system on the underside of the aircraft. It is not
available when the aircraft is on the ground, because the lenses must be
protected from debris thrown up by the landing gear. It is also
unavailable when roll or pitch attitudes are extreme. When the view is not
available a large diagonal cross fills the display.

The TIALD system is mainly used from medium altitude to designate targets
for Laser-Guided bombs, and it is described in detail in the Weapons
Conversion chapter.

3. Local Map Display

This works exactly like the MFD Local Map Display, but is larger and more
useful. It is not available if the back-seat MFD is already displaying the
Local Map

4. Scrollable Map

This mode is only available on the Tab displays. You can distinguish it
from the Local Map because it doesn`t have adotted line down the centre.
It is described in detail below.

5. PLN (Flightplan) Display

This mode is only available on the TaB displays. It shows a schematic of
the flightplan currently stored in the aircraft`s navigation system, the
location of any target-of opportunity waypoint, and the aircraft`s position
relative to these Zoom level and display origin will change automatically
to keep all of these elements on the screen, provided that you don`t fly
off the map.

The PLN display is described in detail below, in the section covering AFDS
Track mode.

The scrollable Map Display in detail

This is your most powerful navigational aid. Like the Local Map, this map
display rotates as the aircraft heading changes, so that the aircrafts
direction of movement is always straight up the screen. Unlike the Local
Map, however this display does not scroll automatically to keep your
current position at a fixed point on the screen. Check that the right
Tab`s green Mouse Active light is on and try moving the mouse about. You
will see that moving the mouse scrolls the map freely in all four
directions, out to the limits of the Training Area. You can also zoom in
and out by clicking the left and right mouse buttons while holding down the
Control key

There is a numerical readout in each corner of the display, and working
clockwise from top left these are: current aircraft heading, Bearing to
the map position centred on the screen (marked by the small fixed cross),
range in nautical miles to that position and time in minutes and seconds
required to get there at current speed (provided that the aircraft is
pointing in that general direction)

If you scroll away over the map and lose track of your current position you
can find the aircraft quickly by clicking the left mouse button while
holding down the Alt key. This centres the display at your current
position where you will see a small aircraft symbol. Wait a few seconds
and you will see the symbol move up the screen as it tracks your position.

These features make the Scrollable Map the most useful of all. However its
most powerful feature is the ability to set a Target of Opportunity
waypoint

Setting a Target-of-Opportunity Waypoint

Use the Alt and left click combination to find your aircraft again. Scroll
the map some way ahead of your current position, and find an identifiable
feature. For example, this might be an airfield, a city, a village or a
bridge. Now click the left mouse button on its own. This will create a
Target of Opportunity waypoint at that location. If you scroll the map a
little away from the point you selected, you`ll see that it is marked by a
flashing cross. If you click the RIGHT mouse button while holding down the
Alt key, the map will centre itself on the waypoint again. Clicking the
RIGHT mouse button on its own cancels the waypoint.

A waypoint is just a map position stored by the aircraft navigation
systems. It may be the position of a target, more often it`s a place where
you want to make a course change. Waypoints which are part of the stored
flightplan are labelled in alphabetical order from A to O, with the letters
X, Y and Z used for planned targets you can see the stored flightplan on
the Tab PLN display (call it up on the other Tab display if it isn`t there
already). These waypoints can only be set up in the Mission Planner. The
waypoint you`ve just placed is different; its called the
Target-of-Opportunity waypoint, it`s shown on the PLN display by the tetter
T, and obviously you CAN set this one in flight, at any position you like
(provided that it`s within the current map area).

Target-of-Opportunity (ToO) waypoints can be used exactly as the name
implies - to make accurate attacks on unplanned targets with the aid of the
navigation systems. You can also create ToO waypoints using the Ground
Radar display on the MFD. We`ll deal with how to make attacks of all kinds
in the Weapons Conversion chapter, but here we`ll talk about using the ToO
waypoint for navigation.

AFDS Track Mode

So far we`ve used the AFDS in Attitude/Heading Acquire, Terrain Follow and
Approach modes. Track mode is the "smartest" mode of all, and the one
you`ll use most often operationally. In Track mode the aircraft will
automatically follow the stored flightplan, flying itself from waypoint to
waypoint, performing attacks (in most delivery modes), adjusting height fo
terrain follow or hold altitude as laid down in the flightplan. In the
absence of interruptions from the enemy, the AFDS in Track mode is quite
capable of flying an entire strike mission for itself from just after
take-off to just before touchdown.

Human intervention is only required for takeoff, setting autothrottle and
wing sweep, arming and committing weapon release, pulling up if it's a loft
delivery landing and bringing the aircraft to a halt. Later on, we`ll look
at the normal use of Track mode to follow a complete flightplan. What
we`re going to do now is use Track mode to fly the aircraft automatically
to the Target of-Opportunity waypoint, T.

One of the waypoints shown on the Tab PLN display is highlighted. This is
the currently selected waypoint, and if you engage AFDS Track mode the
aircraft will automatically fly towards this waypoint. Flightplan
waypoints are normally selected in automatic sequence, though you can
override this by hitting the Skip Waypoint key. The only way to select T
as the current waypoint is to hit the T key. Do this now, and check to see
that the T on the Track display is highlighted. Now engage AFDS Track mode
(F7), and watch the aircraft turn and flytowards T. This is literally
point-and-click navigation, a boon for the lazy the confused or the
preoccupied!

If you`ve followed the directions in this tutorial faithfully, you were in
Altitude / Heading Acquire (AHA) mode before you switched to Track mode,
and you`ll see that the hold altitude carries over despite the switch of
mode. While the AFDS is in Track mode, hitting the TF Engage key (F9) will
toggle altitude control between AHA mode and Terrain Following. (provided
that you`re flying an IDS Tornado the ADV can`t Terrain Follow) and in
either mode you may change the height setting in the normal way by moving
the Control Stick backwards or forwards. Be careful when switching from
Terrain Following to Altitude Hold or you may find yourself flying into a
hill! You cannot change the heading manually in Track mode, because this
is automatically defined by the bearing of the selected waypoint.

In Track mode the AFDS MFD display shows several new items. One of these
is the letter identifying the currently-selected waypoint the one which the
system is steering towards. At the moment it should show T. When Track
mode is engaged there will always be a TTG (Time To Go) legend on the
display though a figure will not always be shown beside it. This shows the
time in minutes and seconds before you reach the selected waypoint at your
current speed. It is only displayed when the aircraft is pointing in the
general direction of the selected waypoint; if it`s pointed away (e.g.
when there`s a large angle to turn through) it`s difficult to calculate a
meaningful Time To-Go figure.

You should notice an arrow-shaped symbol beneath the heading strip on the
HUD this also shows the bearing to T, the currently-selected waypoint (or
any other waypoint which is selected). When the Bearing symbol is lined up
with the vertical "lubber line" you`re pointing straight at the waypoint,
allowing you to follow a flightplan manually as well as automatically.

The Tab PLN Display

We`ve already introduced you to most of the uses of this display in the
sections above, but let`s sum up the details now and complete the
description. The PLN display shows all waypoints and the stored
flightplan, plus your current position (as a small circle). It will change
scale and re centre itself automatically to keep all this data on the
screen as the aircraft moves or ToO waypoints are created; but if the
aircraft moves too far outside the current map it will give up the attempt
to keep it on screen. The PLN display does not rotate and is always
oriented North-up, like the map in the Mission Planner which is used to
create flightplans.

The currently selected waypoint is shown highlighted, and is normally one
of the stored flightplan waypoints. If you create a ToO waypoint using the
Scrollable Map, you can select and highlight it by hitting the T key. To
deselect the ToO waypoint, use the key combination Control+T, which will
also reselect the previously selected flightplan waypoint.

As on the Scroltable Map, figures are shown in the four corners of the PLN
display. Clockwise from top left these are: current aircraft heading,
bearing of the selected waypoint, range (in nautical miles) to the selected
waypoint and (when appropriate) time to reach it at current speed

Using AFDS Track Mode with stored flightpaths

This is the normal use of Track mode. Whether it`s supplied ready- made
for a Single Mission, or hand-crafted by yourself using the Mission Planner
software the stored flightplan consists of a sequence of waypoints and the
legs connecting them. Flightplan waypoints may also have other information
associated with them. This may specify the altitude or Ride Height to fly
at the time at which you plan to pass the waypoint, or the method you
intend to use to attack a target located there. We describe the system in
exhaustive detail in the chapter of this manual dedicated to the Mission
Planner. All we`re going to do now is demonstrate how to use the AFDS to
follow the flightplan.

From the Simulator Mission Selection Screen, select the Nav Exercise option
and commit. This will take you to the Mission Planner, where you should be
able to see a preset flightplan on the map. When you know how to use the
Mission Planner you`ll be able to change this to suit yourself, but for the
moment just click on the button marked Take Off, which is on the right hand
side of the screen.

When you arrive in the cockpit, take off and climb straight ahead to an
altitude of at least 200 feet, not forgetting to raise gear and flaps.
When you reach 200 feet, hit F7 to engage Track Mode. Let the aircraft
accelerate to about 420 knots, then cut in the Autothrottle and go to 45
sweep, the normal cruise configuration. On the MFD AFDS display you should
be able to see all the data we've explained above, and one more line will
have become active, titled TEL

TEL (Time Early / Late) Displays

If you're taking part in a multi aircraft attack, then every aircraft`s
time of arrival and attack should be planned to the second in order to
cause maximum confusion and embarassment to the target defences - and to
minimise the chances of one aircraft being damaged by the blast of
another`s weapons. On the way to and from the target, Tornado IDS will
normally fly in widely spaced tactical formations, and its impossible to
hold your place in the formation by eye. Absolutely precise timekeeping is
a necessity if the mission flightplan is to stand any chance at all of
surviving contact with reality.

When the mission flightplan is created, most of the waypoints are tagged
with planned times-of-arrival. When the aircraft is flying towards a
selected waypoint which has a set time-of-arrival, the navigation systems
continuously calculate a predicted time-of arrival on the basis of your
current position and speed. The difference in seconds between the planned
and predicted figures is shown as the Time Early / Late. The TEL line on
the AFDS display is self explanatory, but the TEL display on the HUD needs
description, though it`s simple once you know how it works.

When the TEL HUD display is active, it appears as a short vertical line and
three horizontally spaced dots just below the HUD Airpeed indicator. The
vertical line moves sideways between the centre position and the outside
dots, left for late and right for early. If you`re right on time, the line
is below the centre dot: if it's at the left dot you`re 30 seconds late or
more; at the right dot you`re early by 30 seconds or more. Smaller
deflections left or right indicate smaller deviations from the schedule.

While the TEL displays make really accurate timekeeping much easier you`ll
find it difficult to achieve this in practice unless you have some idea of
what speed the mission plan required over each leg of the flightplan. This
subject is treated in much more detail in the Mission Planner chapter, but
in general you won't go far wrong if you assume that the flightplan expects
a cruising speed of 420 knots, rising to 500-600 knots for attack and
egress runs.

The drill for adjusting your speed to stay on schedule might go something
like this:

1. Adjust Autothrottle setting for the nominal speed over the current leg
of the flightplan

2. Wait for the aircraft speed to adjust to the new setting and watch the
TEL indicator. If you`re late, adjust the speed upward, if early, reduce
it. Remember that the adjustment won`t act the TL calculation until the
actual aircraft speed has changed.

3. Keep an eye on the figure as well, if possible. The further you are
from the waypoint, the less accurate the TEL fIgure is. Unless you`re on
an attack run, don`t bother to adjust small discrepancies until the TTG
figure shows less than a minute to go to the waypoint.

When the aircraft reaches the currently selected waypoint while in AFDS
Track mode, the next waypoint in the flightplan is automatically selected
and the aircraft turns towards it. If it`s a target, you`ll need to hit
"arm air-to ground weapons". The AFDS can fly most planned attacks for
itself, though you`ll need to fly loft profiles manually, and weapons
cannot be released unless you hold down the Commit button. See the Weapons
Conversion chapter for more details. If the aircraft reaches an Approach
Point within an allied ILS beam while under Track mode control, the AFDS
will automatically switch to Approach mode for landing. If you want to fly
parts of the flightplan manually you`ll have to advance the selected
waypoint yourself at the end of each leg using the Skip Waypoint command
(see below).

When you reach a waypoint and the aircraft turns onto the next leg, the TEL
displays will not be active until the nose is pointing in the general
direction of the next waypoint. Don`t adjust your speed during the turn if
you can avoid it. There are two good reasons for this: a) you can`t see
the indicator, and b) the mission flightplan assumes that even if the
planned speeds for the two legs are different, you won`t change your speed
until you`ve finished the turn.

It will take some time and practice before you become proficient at keeping
to your timetable, which is why this "Nav. Exercise" mission exists. Once
you are familiar with the Mission Planner you can construct your own
exercises if you wish, starting either from here or from the Free Flight
(from runway) option Until you can fly accurately to schedule, you`re
nothing but a menace on a multi-aircraft mission.

Having said all this, it`s a foregone conclusion that things will still go
wrong for you, as long as the enemy refuses to cooperate. So what then?

Desperate Measures: Skipping Waypoints

Suppose that you`re flying an operational mission, you`re on track and on
schedule, and then suddenly your Radar Warning Receiver tells you that
there`s an unexpected AAA unit ahead, or an interceptor coming your way?
Either you abandon the mission or you try to find a way to dodge the
hazard. If you decide to press on you`re going to have to manoeuvre or
change your speed or both, and that will definitely interfere with the
timetable. Assuming that you do evade the threat, there`s only so much you
can do in the way of speeding up or slowing down before you run into
problems with stalling speeds, limiting speeds or fuel constraints.

One of the options open to you is to cut a corner. This might run you
straight into a new hazard, but it could be your only chance to make the
target on time. This is why the Skip Waypoint command exists. It`s very
simple to use; just move to the back seat, call up the PLN display if it`s
not already visible, and hit the Skip Waypoint key (probably N) to advance
the currently selected waypoint to the next in sequence. You can use this
command from the front seat if you wish, but it`s easier to see what`s
going on if you watch the PLN display.

You can repeat the comand as many times as you like, and cycle all the way
through the list again if you overshoot, but if you leave the AFDS in Track
mode while you do it, be aware that the aircraft is going to twitch all
over the place in response to the flurry of rapidly changing steering
demands. Even more significantly, the altitude authority mode and height
setting may change from waypoint to waypoint, possibly running you into a
hill. To avoid this problem disengage the AFDS and either fly the aircraft
manually or re engage in plain TF mode until you`ve selected the right
waypoint.

SETTING UP YOUR OWN APPROACH AND LANDING

If you`re following a properly made flightplan and nothing goes wrong en
route you can arrive at the Approach Point under AFDS Track mode control
flying in the right direction to make a straight-in approach. There will
be times though, when you`ll need to approach from another direction, or
land at another airfield altogether. Let`s look at how to do this for
yourself; now that you`ve been introduced to the map displays, the
Target-of-Opportunity waypoint and AFDS Track mode it`s not too hard to do,
or to explain.

The problem breaks down into two main sections: 1) Finding a runway to
land on, and 2) Setting up to approach it from a sensible direction and
distance, so that you can use the Instrument Landing System (ILS) and AFDS
Approach mode if you wish. If you want to follow this exercise through in
the Simulator, select a "Free Flight (start airborne)" mission, but don`t
try to set up to land on the airfield beneath your starting position
without first flying a good way away from it.

Finding a runway, placing an Approach Point

Finding a runway isn`t difficult if you use the map displays. The Full
screen map, zoomed well out, is probably the best one to start with. Use
this to find an airfield which is neither too close, nor too far away, and
remember roughly which way it is from your current position (remember, the
map rotates so that your aircraft is always flying straight up the screen).

Now switch to the back cockpit and call up the Scrollable map on one of the
Tab displays. Use Alt +left click to centre on your current position, zoom
right out and scroll the map in the right direction to find your target
airfield. Refer back to the Full screen map if necessary to find your way.
When you bring the airfield on screen you will be able to see that the
active runway (the one you want to use) is shown in a contrasting colour.

If there`s a significant wind blowing, landing in one direction will be
vastly preferable to landing the other way, but we`ll leave this subject
for later. With the airfield on screen and the Scrollable Map zoomed right
out, click the left mouse button to place waypoint T about 7 or 8 runway
lengths from the airfield, IN LINE WITH THE RUNWAY. You now have a
home-made approach point. Hit T to make waypoint T the currently-selected
waypoint, and you can engage Track mode to fly you there.

Why put the Approach Point there?

At this point we need to remind ourselves of the size and shape of the ILS
coverage, but we`ll leave till later the details of how the system works.
As you can see from diagram that the ILS beams cover a spike shaped zone
which is widest and highest at its furthest point from the runway. This is
about 60000 feet (10 nautical miles or 18 kilometres) from the runway
threshold. Since all the active runways you`ll find in Tornado are about
8000 feet long, this means that the big end of the wedge is almost exactly
8 runway-lengths from the middle of the runway That`s why we advised you to
place waypoint T at that distance from the runway end. You`ll have to
enter the ILS zone and point the aircraft in roughly the right direction
before the ILS displays will activate and AFDS Approach mode can be
engaged.

You can see from diagram 88B that the beam is 8000 feet high at extreme
range, and the AFDS will find it easiest to line up for the approach if you
enter the beam near the centre, so set the AFDS for Altitude hold (still
under Track mode) at about 8000 feet. The next question, and the most
important, concerns how you`re going to line up for the approach when you
reach waypoint T. This depends entirely upon the angle between the line of
runway (call it the centreline), and the line along which you`re
approaching waypoint T.

How to line up for your Approach

Diagrams 8.9 A,B and C illustrate a number of situations and possible ways
of dealing with them. You can find out which diagram most closely
resembles your real-life situation by looking at the scrollable map
display. Because this display rotates to keep your aircraft pointing up
the screen, you should be able to tell at a glance what sort of angle
you`ll need to turn through in order to line up.

Take special note that whenever the approach is from anything like an
unfavourable angle we show the aircraft turning the longer rather than the
shorter way round towards the runway. Once you`ve acquired experience and
confidence you won`t have to do it this way all the time, but as diagram
8.9D shows, it gives you far more space and time to line up.

As you approach waypoint T, call up the Local Map on the MFD, select Base
Origin display (aircraft at the bottom, not in the middle) and look out for
the letter T marking the position. When you get close, cancel the
Autothrottle and disengage the AFDS, then start your turn. If you make it
a tight turn you`ll lose a good deal of speed as well as staying closer to
your reference point. If you think your speed is dropping ominously low,
lower the nose a few degrees below the horizon, slacken off the turn a
little, sweep the wings forward, put down manoeuvre flap, and if all else
fails, throttle up.

Keep an eye on the outside world and the Local Map so that you know when to
stop the turn. Remember that it`s not good enough just to point the
aircraft at the airfield; you`ve got to be more or less in line with the
runway. If you`re off the centreline, line the aircraft up to cross it a
fair distance out (see diagram 8.10). If you do this even halfway right,
you should see the HUD switch mode as you enter ILS coverage. Your
troubles are almost over!

Almost, but not quite. There`s still one potential problem Once you`re in
the beam you can engage the AFDS in Approach mode, but if you`re crossing
the centreline at too great an angle and too high a speed you`ll fly
straight out of the other side of the beam before the AFDS can line Up (see
diagram 8.11 ). If this happens, the AFDS will turn itsell off and sound a
warning. It`s almost always possible to haul the aircraft back into the
beam and recover the situation, but it`s better to avoid the problem
altogether This is one reason why it`s a good idea to enter the beam at a
fairly low speed - say no more than 350 knots. The other and more
significant way to avoid the problem is to ensure that the closer you get
to the centreline, the smaller the angle at which you`ll cross it. This is
illustrated in diagram 8.12, and is effectively what you'll be doing all
the way down the approach once you learn to fly it manually, which is what
we'll be looking at next.

SEMI-AUTOMATIC AND MANUAL LANDINGS

AFDS Approach mode control is a neat and useful aid, but any self -
respecting pilot should be able to fly the entire approach and land by hand
with a minimum of automatic help or (s)he will have no choice but to eject
if the AFDS fails or the airfield ILS system is bombed out. The
sophistication of the Tornado systems means that there is an easy
intermediate stage between a fully automatic and a fully manual landing.

Semi-automatic Approach:- ILS and Autothrottle

In this type of approach we`ll use the ILS (Instrument Landing System) as a
manual steering cue, and leave speed management to the Autothrottle. First
let`s look at the ILS system in detail. Your aircraft's ILS displays are
driven by transmitters and aerials on the ground, pointing up the approach
path. There are effectively two fan-shaped radio beams; one (the
Localiser) to tell you whether you are to the left or to the right of the
runway centreline, and the other (the Glideslope) to tell you whether you
are above or below a steady 3o slope which meets the ground at the runway
threshold. The coverage of these two beams defines a square wedge with one
side resting on the ground and the point at the runway threshold. To avoid
your being misled by weak and possibly distorted signals, there is a sharp
range cut-off, so the blunt end of the wedge is flat. This end defines a
square "hoop" in the sky with 8000 feet (2440 M,) sides. To exploit the
maximum range of the system, you need to enter the beam by flying through
this hoop. See diagram 8.8A for a full schematic.

In the aircraft, the localiser and glideslope beams are received and
interpreted to drive ILS displays, which are provided in triplicate (HUD,
MFD and HSI displays) because in the worst of weather conditions your
chances of landing safely without ILS assistance are very slim. The
easiest form of the display to use is the one which automatically appears
on the HUD when you enter ILS coverage with the HUD in standard NAV mode
(i.e no weapon aiming displays). On the HUD ILS display, the aircraft
datum in the centre is shown as a cross and a second, larger cross moves
left, right, up and down to indicate which way it is to the centre of the
ideal approach path. When you are in the centre of the path the two
crosses are exactly superimposed.

For comparison you can call up the MFD ILS display by using the D key (MFD
Function Select) to cycle through the possible displays. Here the ILS
display shows fixed dashed crosshairs equivalent to the aircraft datum on
the HUD and moving solid crosshairs which correspond to the larger moving
cross. This display also shows, clockwise from top left; Aircraft Heading,
Bearing to the airfield (to runway midpoint). Range to the airfield in
nautical miles (to runway midpoint) and Time to go in minutes and seconds.
The two ILS needles on the HSI (Horizontal Situation Indicator) instrument
are minute and hard to read; we only provide them as a last-ditch backup in
case both HUD and MFD are unserviceable for a foul-weather landing.

Leading and Reacting to the ILS display

On the face of it, then, reaching the ideal approach path is simply a
question of flying the aircraft towards the cross on the HUD. It`s not
quite that simple there are two other points to bear in mind. The first is
that the ILS display is only telling you where you are relative to the
ideal approach path - it is NOT telling you if you`re pointed in the right
direction to stay there. To stay in the centre of the localiser beam (the
left-right reference) you need to be pointing in the same direction as the
runway you`re approaching. If you`re landing on runway 09 the aircraft`s
got to be on a heading of 090° as well as in the centre of the beam Don`t
make big, radical manoeuvres to try to reach the centre of the beam - the
closer you get to it, the smaller your corrections should be.

This is a highly important point, and one which many people find difficult
to grasp: if the ILS display is telling you that the runway centreline is
off to the left of your current position, it`s NOT telling you to keep
turning left until you reach it. If you`re approaching runway 09 and the
ILS shows that the centreline is off to the left, what you should be doing
is taking up a heading to the left of 090o (say 080 or 085°), so that you
reach the centreline before you arrive at the threshold. In the same way,
if the ILS showed the centre touchdown and the runway looms larger you should
transfer your attention from the ILS cues to the outside world. The ILS is
highly useful when the runway is distant, but in all except the very worst
visibility the last stages of the approach will be much easier to fly by
eye. It`ll also be much easier to achieve the shortest possible touchdown
and landing run.

Setting your Approach Speed

So what do we tell the Autothrottle? If you remember, approach speed is
calculated by taking stalling speed in the current configuration and adding
a percentage. Stalling speed for the Tornado depends on 1) Wind Sweep
position, 2) Flap setting and 3) Aircraft weight, so there`s a lot of scope
for variation. We give a ready reckoner approach speed table in the
Aircrew Notes, but here`s a simplified version of it predigested for three
different weights:

Recommended Approach Speeds at 25° Wingsweep

              Weight: Flap Setting:

                     Zero  Man`vre Mid  Full
           Light     180    172    153   135
           Medium    210    202    183   165
           Heavy     248    240    221   203


Light case:      33000lb / 15000kg - Virtually empty aircraft
Medium case:     45000lb / 20400kg - No external stores" full internal fuel
Heavy case:      60000lb / 27200kg - Near maximum take-off weight

Note that we only give figures for 25° wingsweep here. You`d never expect
to touch down with the wings in any other sweep position unless the sweep
mechanism itself jammed - we`ll try that later. While you can drastically
speed up the process of approach and landing by coming in at higher speeds
and decelerating at the last minute, don`t try it until you really know
what you`re doing.

The medium weight case is probably the most useful: set the Autothrottle
to about 210 knots to bring you within flap-limiting speeds, lower the
flaps all the way and then set 165-180 knots. Just be aware that this
won`t work if the aircraft is too heavy. If you`re carrying more weight
than this it would normally be sensible to dump some of it using the
External Stores Jettison option before starting the approach.

When setting the Autothrottle as low as this you must remember that you`re
not far above stalling speed. If you manoeuvre hard to chase the localiser
needle or point the nose high in the air to climb to the glidepath, your
airspeed may fall to the danger point.

Another way of gauging the correct approach speed is to watch the Alpha
(Angle of Attack) meter - either the HUD display or the mechanical guage
next to it. If you`re in the right speed range for an approach at your
current weight, the reading should generally be somewhere between 8 and
12°. If it`s higher than this then you`re too slow, if lower then you`re
too fast. Check the Approach & Landing Emergencies section at the end of
the Aircrew Notes for the figures to use in unusual cases.

Semi-automatic Approaches - Summing up

Provided that you understand what the ILS display is telling you, and you
can fly the aircraft to centre it in the beams ON THE RUNWAY HEADING with
the Autothrottle holding a sensible airspeed, you should arrive at the
runway threshold in good shape for touchdown. Use the Landing Practice
Setup in the Simulator until you`re confident that you can track the ILS by
hand.
 
There is one further technique you may find helpful for making small
corrections left or right to track the localiser - using the rudder
controls. We havent said much about the rudder so far, and we won`t say
much more, because in modern aircraft it`s almost redundant as a manual
control, and has a very limited effect at any but the lowest speeds. On
the approach, however it can be useful. Look up the rudder commands under
Primary Flight Controls in the Control Summary.

MANUAL APPROACHES

Once you can fly a semi-automatic approach as described above, you`ve
mastered the art of reading the ILS and acquired a feeling for the art of
correcting into the centre of the beam without overshooting. There is a
furthur challenge you may wish to take up: purely manual landings with and
without the aid of the ILS. If you can do everything we`ve discussed so
far, you should be able to handle this without too much trouble and no self
respecting pilot should ever be satisfied until (s)he can land with the
absolute minimum of artificial aids The AFDS, the Autothrottle or the
airfield ILS may be knocked out by battle damage. You may have to make an
emergency landing on a airfield, taxi track or a road. In any of these
cases you`ve got to be able to cope. If you can`t, you can only eject -
and throw away an extremely valuable aircraft

Manual Approach with ILS

Here we`re talking about flying an approach without using the Autothrottle.
Managing speed at the same time as flying the approach adds considerably to
the difficulty and demands a quite different flight technique. Normally
you think in terms of controlling speed with the throttle and controlling
rate of descent or climb by pointing the nose up or down. At the low
speeds involved in flying an approach. However, it is actually easier to
reverse this convention. Think in terms of controlling speed by raising
the nose (to slow down) or lowering the nose (to speed up) and controlling
rate of desecent by opening the throttle (to descend more slowly) or
closing the throttle (to descend faster)

Obviously there will be side the nose will usually reduce your rate of
descent as well as your airspeed, and so on, but these side effects are
actually easier to deal with using the reversed convention of airspeed,
pitch and rate of-descent: thrust. Let`s give some examples of how the
process works:

1. Speed correct, but BELOW the glideslope

You respond by throttling up to raise the engine RPM figure one or two per
cent. Now watch your airspeed. As soon as this starts rising above the
target figure, raise the nose slightly to bring the speed back on target.
The end result is that you`re still at the correct approach speed, and
you`re descending more slowly than you were.

2 Speed correct, but ABOVE the glideslope

Throttle back a little. As the airspeed drops below the target, lower the
nose a little to recover the speed.

3 ON the glideslope, but speed LOW

Lower the nose slightly, and watch for the speed to start rising. As it
reaches the correct figure, raise the nose again very slightly. If this
leaves you below the glideslope refer to example 1.

4 ON the glideslope, but speed HIGH

Raise the nose a little till the speed starts to drop. Wait till you`re
close to the target speed and then lower it a fraction to stabilise at the
new speed. If this leaves you above the glideslope, deal with the problem
as in example 2.

It`ll take a lot of practice in the Simulator before you can do this
reliably. To make your initial attempts easier, use a higher approach
speed than normal This will give you more margin for error. You`ll
probably find that the largest problem is the time lag in engine response
to throttle changes, and aircraft response to the change in thrust. For
this reason it`s best to try to avoid large changes of throttle setting
unless absolutely necessary. Having said that there`s no way to avoid one
large throttle movement: your first action in the Simulator Landing
Practice scenario should normally be to close the throttle completely (and
use airbrakes) in order to lose speed. As your speed decays towards the
chosen approach value you will need to open the throttle again, but it`s
best to do this in gradual stages, starting well above the approach speed.

Until you`ve got the feel of the situation its best to be very very
cautious and make the smallest possible control inputs. Line up on the
localiser (left-right reference) first, and then devote most of your
attention to matching the glideslope by juggling speed and rate-of-descent.
Be wary of trying to fly to a fixed rate of descent in feet per second as
shown on the HUD or the VSI; the higher your approach speed, the faster you
must descend to match the fixed 3o glideslope.

This sort of flying takes intense concentration and a thorough practical
understanding of how and why the aircraft responds to the controls. Its
very hard work. If you want a break from the grind, try some purely visual
landings (see below). But if you can learn do this. Be assured that you
could learn to land most aircraft in the real world.

Manual Landings by Eye

Purely visual landings are actually far easier than manual ILS approaches.
Once you`ve got the knack. If you`re going for a straight-in approach
(like an ILS approach) you`ll usually find that it`s best to start closer
to the airfield and higher than usual. This will improve your view of the
runway, and it will also mean that you can fly most of the approach with
the throttle more or less closed, using brief bursts of power to stretch
your glide.

You will probably also find that it`s easier if you fly most of the
approach a little faster than usual, with manoeuvre or mid flap settings
and the gear up. This means that you can drop the gear and the flaps at
the last minute as extra airbrakes, rather than hang about on the edge of
the stall point. Use the Angle of Attack to judge your approach speed.

If you`re really ambitious, you might try a standard military curved
circuit approach. Lining up on the runway from the final 180o turn is more
difficult than in real life because of the restricted and inflexlible views
available from the cockpit - something which we can`t do much about until
Virtual Reality style helmet mounted displays become commonplace.

Once you become accustomed to visual, manual landings you`ll probably find
yourself doing it this way most of the time. The ILS is a godsend in poor
visibility, but it takes a long time to fly the full distance at approach
speeds. You can put the aircraft on the ground much faster for yourself -
provided that you can see to do it.
