                   Mortal Kombat - Fatalities
                  ----------------------------
After seeing the "Mortal Kombat - Death Move Guide" in LSD docs disk 45 I 
decided to write this to tell you of ALL the death moves.  In the Death Move 
Guide for some reason Jonny Cages death move wasnt mentioned and the way it 
told you to do Scorpions death move didnt work.

Anyway here is everyones moves:
 
Ive put it in -Back-Foward- style so you know exactly what to do which ever 
way your facing.

Kano:
-----
Back - Back - Fire

Rayden:
-------
Forward - Back - Back - Back - Fire

Scorpion:
---------
In LSD docks disk 45 it said:
Up - Up - (Keep fire button pressed down)

When I tried this I couldnt get it to work but Ive tried this and it DOES work:

Down - Down - Fire 

Subzero:
--------
Forward - Down - Forward - Fire

Sonya:
------
Stand about 3 inches away.
Forward - Forward - Back - Back - Fire

Cage:
-----
Forward - Forward - Forward - Fire

Lui Kang:
---------
Down - Back - Forward - Down

Id just like to thank Homer/AlphaFlight + /X\ystic for doing the original 
"Mortal Kombat - Death Move Guide" in LSD docs disk 45 which I learnt most 
of the moves from.  Cheers!
