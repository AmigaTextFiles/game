  		  	 Galactic Struggle 
			(C)opyright 1994
			Written by: Greg Cooper


			    I. INTRODUCTION
			    ---------------


CREATION BACKGROUND

Galactic Struggle is intended to be a space strategy game. There was
a game for the IBM some time ago called "Trek" that was an "over-the-
modem" space game. This game was great fun and involved a good deal of
strategy and thought. "Trek" by Carl McLawhorn was where I got my basic
motivation to create this game.

Even though there are some similarities between "Trek" and Galactic
Struggle, it is an entirely different game. Graphics, sound, game play,
objectives, and much more are completely different. The idea of controlling
one ship with a scrolling background is essentially the same, but that's
about it. I decided to create an entirely new "world" with different
types of ships and different objectives.

This first version of the game is a fairly straight forward battle
simulator between two separate fleets. This will hopefully be the
first step in the evolution of a much more involved game.

DEVELOPMENT

Galactic Struggle was written in Lattice C 5.04 on an Amiga 1000 with an
80 meg HD and 1.5 megs of RAM. If I ever get my hands on a more powerful
Amiga I may be able to enhance much of the game.


GAME BACKGROUND

Galactic Struggle is a space combat game between two sides. You control
one of the ships on your side. The computer controls all of the other
ships in your fleet, as well as the enemy fleet.

Even though you are limited to only flying one ship at a time, you may
switch to another ship at any time during the game, giving you a great
deal of control over the outcome of the game. For more information on
switching ships, see "GAME COMMANDS".


OBJECTIVE(S)

In the first version there is only one real objective -- Destroy your
opponent. This may seem simple at first, but there are many underlying
objectives as well. Mineral mining is an essential part of the game.

Version 1.0 of Galactic Struggle is you vs. the computer. Two players
MAY become available in future version(s) via serial interface (modem)
but that won't be until 3.0 (at least).


COMPUTER STRATEGY

The hardest aspect of this game is giving the computer "intelligence".
Hopefully the strategy of the computer is sufficient to give you enough
of a "challenge". This is my area of concentration at the present time.
As future revisions are made, the computer will keep getting smarter
and smarter. Skill levels are implemented to give starting players a
chance, and seasoned players a challenge!!


MACHINE REQUIREMENTS

Being developed on one of the older Amiga models, Galactic Struggle 1.0
SHOULD work on any of the Amiga models with sufficient resources (namely
memory and disk space). I will test the game on whatever machines I can.

If you are running with a machine with a different setup and the game
doesn't work properly I would like to know. I am very interested in
making the game "friendly" to all.


 MEMORY REQUIREMENTS

 Galactic Struggle require ROUGHLY 580,000 bytes of memory. Note that
 much of this is in chip ram. Not all of it is though! I am running with
 only 512k of chip ram so even the low end Amigas can run the game. I
 would recommend having ABOVE a 512k system. Anything less than 560,000
 bytes available may not work.

 FILE REQUIREMENTS

 For the game to work properly you should have the following directory
 setup on your disk.

 NOTE: Distribution of certain system libraries requires a licence so
   I could not distribute "diskfont.library", "mathtrans.library",
   or "icon.library. These libraries should be in your "libs:"
   directory (these three should be standard with your operating
   system).

 STRUCTURE:

 GStruggle
 libs(dir)
diskfont.library
mathtrans.library
icon.library (optional - For use with workbench)
 fonts(dir)
game.font
game(dir)
    6
 title.bin
 main.bin
 final.bin
 * namesa.txt
 * namesb.txt

* = These files contain the names for the ships as they are created.
    One file exists for each side, you may change or add names to
    the file(s).


 DISK REQUIREMENTS

 In addition to having all the above files under "FILE REQUIREMENTS" it
 is recommended that you have AT LEAST 150,000 bytes available on your
 disk for saving games. You may only save one game at a time and each
 saved game file will be different lengths as there are varying amounts
 of objects in the game at one time.



		      II. WEAPONS & COMBAT
		      --------------------
SYSTEMS
Every ship is equipped with a weapon system of some sort. Every
ship is the same in how the weapons operate, but not in what weapons
are available.

1. Targeting
   ---------
Every weapon, except mines, requires a target. To target a ship you
must be close enough to do so. Once close enough, use [T] to target the
enemy ship. You will know what target is selected because it will be
high-lighted yellow.
At the last minute I put in the ability to target ships with the
right mouse button. Just click on the ship you wish to target and that
should do it. The next version of Galactic Struggle will probably make
use of the mouse even more.

    --------------
    | BE CAREFUL |
    --------------
	The targeting system is used for more than just combat and
	weapon systems. Therefore, it is very flexible and allows
	targeting of friendly ships. If your friendly ship is targeted
	you can destroy it.

2. Weapon Selection
   ----------------
If you are piloting a ship other than a scout you will have multiple
weapons to choose from. To select a current weapon system YOU MUST HAVE
a valid ship targeted. If a ship is targeted you may use [RETURN] to
switch between weapon systems. The weapon systems are indicated at the
bottom left of the screen.

3. Firing
   ------
Firing is easy. Just press [SPACE]. If your ship doesn't fire it is
because of one of the following has occurred:
1. No target is selected.
2. You maybe out of ammunition if you are using torpedoes or seekers.
3. You have just fired and your ship has not recharged. Note that
   after you fired you must wait a BRIEF moment before your ship
   fires again.
4. You have fired the maximum number of shots at a time. Currently
   the limit is 3 projectiles may be fired from a single ship at
   one time. You must wait for the projectiles to explode before
   you can fire again.

4. Canceling
   ---------
Once you fired a projectile it is sometimes necessary to cancel the
current projectiles and launch new ones. If you missed your target and
the projectiles are still "alive" or you fired the wrong type or whatever,
you have the option to destroy what you have just fired.
To cancel all current projectiles, press [C] and the projectiles will
be destroyed.
Note: To cancel mines use [X].

5. Ammo swapping
   -------------
As a strategy measure you are allowed to transfer ammunition between
ships. Carriers provide very good support for this. Carriers have special
abilities to create ammunition and can provide good support in and
attack.
    [,] = Give ammunition to the targeted ship
    [.] = Get ammunition from the targeted ship
This is a relatively new feature, and it is not known how useful this
will be yet.



WEAPON TYPES

1. Phaser bolts
   ------------
All ships are equipped with phaser bolt capability. Phaser bolts are
balls of energy created out of ship fuel. They do not require any
ammunition as all they consist of is energy. Every shot takes a certain
amount of energy. The damage caused by a bolt is dependent on the class
of the ship launching the bolt, and how long ago the bolt was launched.
In other words, the higher class of a ship the more powerful a bolt and
the further away the less damage the bolt will do.
This weapon is a single directional weapon. The bolts only go
straight forward or backward.

2. Torpedo bolts
   -------------
Fighters, Battleships, and Carriers may carrier these weapons. Scouts
are too small to have such capabilities.
These are much like phaser bolts except that they are more powerful.
Essentially torpedo bolts are phaser bolts encased in a torpedo "shell".
Because of this, ammunition in the form of torpedo shells must be
purchased at a space station. The ammo requires resources to produce.
This weapon is a single directional weapon. The bolts only go
straight forward or backward.

3. Seeker bolts
   ------------
Seekers, like torpedoes, are not available to scouts as they are too
small a ship.
Created as an enhancement to torpedo bolts, these are the deadliest
offensive weapons around. They do a significant amount of damage
(depending on the ship type of course) and have a homing device. These
too are encased in torpedo shells. These will seek out their target
and destroy it. Ammunition for these cost a bit more than for normal
torpedo tubes.

4. Mines
   -----
Only found on battleships and carriers these are the most destructive
of all weaponry. They do not have any "thrust" to them and can have the
thrust replaced with more destructive power.
These are often used to put a "shield" of some sort around a planet,
worm-hole, space station, or other vital resources.
They do not require ammunition as they are made with a revolutionary
energy harnessing technique. This technique allows for slow deterioration
and doesn't require any "shell". The mines do deteriorate eventually, but
it takes time. Be careful around these!!
NOTE: The usefulness of mines is somewhat in question. I think that
this weapon will probably evolve into a "defensive decoy" designed to
make the "seekers" attack the decoy.

		    III. SHIPS
		    ----------
SCOUTS

These are the smallest available ships in the game. They are the weakest,
but are also the fastest. For a good exploring or escort ship it isn't
too bad.

The typically use phaser bolts, which do not require ammunition as they
feed off the power supply.

Type: Scout
Maximum fuel :
    20000 units
Maximum Hull Points :
    300
Shield Maximum :
    300
Weapons:
    Phaser Bolts (Fuel)
Special:
    None
Mineral requirements for construction:
    Gromide - 150
    Klogen - 100


FIGHTERS

This is the best "all purpose" ship. It has fair size cargo holds, good
fire power, and not too bad for speed. It is made to destroy. It is best
used for attacks and guarding. Picking off scouts, destroying other
fighters and close support are their best role in life...

Even though one-on-one they do not match up to a battleship, two of these ships
would be a formidable opponent.

Type: Fighter
Maximum fuel :
    50000 units
Maximum Hull Points :
    500
Shield Maximum:
    400
Weapon Possibilities:
Phaser Bolts (Fuel)
Torpedos (Fuel & Ammo)
Seekers (Fuel & Ammo)
Special:
None
Mineral requirements for construction:
Gromide  - 150
Klogen	 - 300
Zentrium - 100

BATTLE SHIPS

These are, perhaps, the most destructive force in Galactic Struggle. They
are still somewhat fast and have weapons of great destruction. They can
take out scouts and fighters with relative ease. They are good for
launching attacks on base stations.

Type: Battleship
Maximum fuel :
    75000 units
Maximum Hull Points :
    700
Shield Maximum:
    500
Weapon Possibilities:
    Phaser Bolts (Fuel)
    Torpedos (Fuel & Ammo)
    Seekers (Fuel & Ammo)
    Mines (Fuel)
Special:
    None
Mineral requirements for construction:
    Gromide - 150
    Klogen  - 300
    Zentrium- 800
    Prodnium- 100

CARRIERS

These ships have massive weapons. However they are large and aren't as
fast or maneuverable. It has a special purpose of providing support
to attacking fleets as it can carry extra cargo for ships to use.
Carriers have virtually unlimited ammunition capacity and they also have
the ability to make their own ammunition.

They can also repair ships. Note that with all these abilities, they must
use minerals. These minerals must be available or the carrier can't
create ammo or repair ships.

Type: Carrier
Maximum fuel :
    100000 units
Maximum Hull Points :
    900
Shield Maximum:
    600
Weapon Possibilities:
    Phaser Bolts (Fuel)
    Torpedos (Fuel & Ammo)
    Seekers (Fuel & Ammo)
    Mines (Fuel)
Special:
    May hold additional ammunition
    Creates own ammunition
Mineral requirements for construction:
    Gromide  - 150
    Klogen   - 300
    Zentrium - 800
    Promidium- 800


BASE STATIONS

This is the heart of your fleet. Guard this with your life! Your base
station in the center for all your ship construction and the source
for a lot of your ammunition.

They have powerful defenses. They can take MANY hits on the shield and
hull. They have self repairing mechanisms (providing minerals are
available).

As well as good defenses, base stations have strong offensive weapons
as well. The seekers fly at substantially fast rates. It takes a bit
of fuel to out run them.

Best suggestion for hanging around an enemy base station: DON'T!! (Unless
you plan on destroying it!)

Note that once your base is destroyed you may still continue playing
but you probably won't win. Your shields can't regenerate anymore and
you cannot create other ships. Unless the enemy is without base you
are doomed! (Note: This may not be the case in future versions.)


		    IV. MINERALS
		    ------------


OVERVIEW

Minerals are the essence of Galactic Struggle. They make the universe
go around! You need minerals to create ammunition, make ships, repair
ships, and other various tasks of importance.

Minerals can be found only on planets. Certain planets have certain
minerals.


MINERAL TYPES

Prodnium:
This mineral is the most precious in the universe. It is the strongest
substance known and one of the lightest. It can only be found on
"Class A" planets and is necessary in building many of the higher
ships as well as some ammunition.

Zentrium:
A somewhat more abundant mineral than prodnium, but still rare, this
mineral provides necessary structure to many ships. It is found
on "Class A and B" planets only.

Klogen:
This precious metal is found on "Class A, B, and C" planets and
is also another commonly used metal.

Gromide:
This energy producing mineral is abundant throughout the galaxy. It
can be found on all planets. As abundant as it may be it is needed
in every aspect of construction as it provides the necessary
"skeleton" for all ships.
NOTE: Gromide is also necessary in the creation of ammunition at
      your base station.

MINERALS & MONEY

Certain actions in the game require credits. Credits are obtained by
selling minerals to "traders". Traders are orbiting stations existing
only for the purpose of buying minerals. They are cylindrical objects
in space that may be orbited with the 'U' command (if found).

Prodnium is the most valuable and Gromide is the least valuable.

		V. SPACE OBJECTS
		----------------

PLANETS

Planets are the most abundant of the objects floating around in space.
They are the source of all minerals. Class A planets are the most
valuable because they produce all types of minerals. Class D planets
are the least valuable, because only Gromide can be found there.

Besides minerals, planets are also valuable as SHIPS CAN REFUEL FASTER
WHILE ORBITING PLANETS.


WORM HOLES

One of the great mysteries of the universe, these provide excellent
transportation throughout the universe. After stars burn out, certain
ones explode. This explosion sometimes creates a "worm hole" through
which ships may travel.

Some worm holes are one way, some are two. Use with caution, because
who knows where they may lead!

Most ships will stay clear of these, however you may use them at a
small cost!

DEBRIS

Left over from the destruction of a ship, debris may be picked up by
passing ships. Debris usually consists of minerals, but who knows...

		    VI. GAME CONTROLS
		    -----------------
NAVIGATION

Speed
-----
Every ship is equipped with some sort of hyperdrive. Certain ships can
go faster than others. Scouts can go a maximum of warp 4, battle
ships and fighters warp 3, carriers - warp 2.

The up and down arrow control acceleration and deceleration.

Direction
---------
The left and right arrows control direction. When they are pressed
any previously set autopilot is turned off.

Scanners
--------
F2 and F3 are the commands to bring up the ships' scanning systems.
Short-range scan long-range scan both have their disadvantages and
advantages.

Short range scan(F2):
    The main advantage of short range scan is that it picks up enemy
    ships. Long range scan does not.

Long range scan(F3):
    The main advantage of long range scan is that it scans a larger
    area (obviously).. The only disadvantage is that it doesn't
    pick up enemy ships.

[F5] - Switch to Targeted Ship
------------------------------
This is how you change to another ship. Using the combat system you
target a friendly ship with [T]. After you have selected the friendly
ship you wish to trade places with press [F5] and you will be
given control of that ship. Your old ship will be controlled by the
computer.

Search Keys
-----------
Certain keys allow your ship to automatically search, or dock with
something. After you press these keys you will essentially be
putting the ship on "auto-pilot".

[O] - Orbit nearest friendly space station
[P] - Orbit nearest friendly planet
[U] - Orbit nearest friendly trader
[W] - Enter nearest worm hole

If your ship cannot pick up the object you wish to search for you
will just fly normally..

[I] - Cloaking
--------------
Learn this, it will save your life! Cloaking is turned on and off
with the [I] key. If you fire while cloaked you will become visible.
Note that cloaking uses fuel. If you are too low on fuel you will
be unable to cloak.

[D] - Debris Salvage
--------------------
After you have destroyed a ship you may salvage what remains with
the [D] command to pick up left over ammo and/or minerals.


[F8] - Universe Map
-------------------
This displays a map of the universe. The bases are red dots and your
ship is a blue-green dot. The enemy won't appear unless the enemy
base has been found.

COMBAT

[T] - Select Target
-------------------
This allows you to target a ship close by (either friend or foe).
The targeted ship will become yellow on your display. You use the
[T] key along with some other action (hostile or friendly).

[RETURN] - Select Weapon
------------------------
This allows you to choose the weapon currently selected. The weapons
your ship has available are displayed at the bottom of the screen.
When you use "select weapon", a different one will become highlighted
and the old one "un-done" (unless of course you only have 1 weapon).

[SPACE] - Fire forward
----------------------
This allows you to fire the currently selected projectile in the
forward direction of your ship.

[A] - Fire Reverse
------------------
Same as [SPACE] except it fires reverse.

[.],[,] - Get/Give ammo
-----------------------
[.] gets ammunition from the selected target. It is good when you
need additional ammo but don't want to go back to your base. Carriers
can regenerate ammo, so they may be used to get ammo from in an
attack..

[,] gives ammunition to another ship. Use it as you will.. If you
are playing the role of the carrier, then use it to assist others..

[C] - Cancel Projectile(s)
--------------------------
All active projectiles (except mines) will be destroyed upon
execution of this command. It is useful when you have fired several
rounds and they have missed and you need to fire again quickly.

[X] - Cancel Mine(s)
--------------------
This is just like [C] except it destroys only mines.


STATUS

[F1] - Ship Status
------------------
This gives updated REAL-TIME status of your current ship. Hull
status, minerals, etc... It is updated as events occur. It is
very useful.

[F4] - Station Status
---------------------
Version 1.0 of Galactic Struggle only allows one base station. Thus,
this command give the status of the base station. It is NOT REAL-TIME
and if you want an updated display, you must press F4 again.

[F6] - Target Status
--------------------
Gives the same information that your "ship status" gives but for the
targeted ship instead of your own ship. Note that this command is
NOT REAL-TIME and your target must be scanned (F6) every time you
want updated information on it.

[F7] - Fleet Status
-------------------
Gives information on your fleet and the enemy fleet. The ships in your
fleet are listed sequentially. The "*" beside them indicates their
alert status. It is either red, green or yellow. Red indicated they
are in danger, combat or about to be destroyed! Green means their
ok. Yellow means there is an enemy near them.

[TAB] - Alert Siren Off
-----------------------
If you have a weak hull or your base is in trouble an alert will
go off and you will be notified. The alarm gets rather annoying
after a while so this turns it off.


AUTO-PILOT CONTROLS

These are similar to the "Search" commands described above except they
can be a bit more extensive. You may cancel these, or the "search"
commands at any time by using the direction controls (left and right
arrows).

[0] - Auto speed on/off
-----------------------
This is a toggle switch to turn your automatic speed controls on or
off. This only applies to when your ship is under "auto-pilot". If
your ship is being controlled by the computer then this will determine
if the speed is to be controlled by you or the computer.

[1] - Refuel
------------
This will send your ship to the nearest planet for refuel and return
control when fueled.

[2] - Rearm
-----------
This sends your ship to the nearest friendly space station and gets
ammunition. It then returns control.

[3] - Explore
-------------
This sets your ship to seeking out all "undiscovered" space objects.
It returns control when everything is found.

[4] - NOT USED

FLEET CONTROLS

These controls apply to the entire fleet.

[5] - Recall Ships
------------------
This sends all ships back to base for protection...

[6] - Base Attack
-----------------
No matter what the ships are doing, this sends everybody to the
enemies' base.

[7] - Full Fleet Attack
-----------------------
Similar to base attack except ships go for enemy ships. It is
not wise to use [6] or [7] unless your fleet is fairly strong.

[8] - Reset Fleet
-----------------
This gives all computer controlled ships in both fleets new orders.
Essentially "resetting" the ships. If a ship is doing something
it's not supposed to (an endless orbit around a planet, for example)
then this will reset it. Generally it shouldn't be needed, but it
is provided for you in case you need it.

[DEL] - Self Destruct
---------------------
If all is lost, press the delete key. This will destroy your ship
with no questions asked!! BE CAREFUL!!


SAVING GAME
-----------
You may save the game in progress when you are docked with your space
station. The "S" key on the menus will do it.

LOADING GAME
------------
You may load a previously saved game by pressing the space bar from the
main title screen. If you don't have a saved game this will do nothing.

		    VII. Configuration
		    ------------------
GAME CONFIGURATION

There are certain options in the game that can be modified with the
addition "game configuration editor. This is a separate program titled
"GConfig" on the distribution disk. Simply run it in the same directory
with the game and you will be asked questions to configure the game.
NOTE: This program doesn't come with the "unregistered" version.


SKILL LEVEL

This is the difficulty level at which the game operates. The easiest level
is level 0 and the hardest is level 3.

MUSIC

You may have the music either on or off. It is nice at first but you
may wish to turn it off.

EXTENDED GRAPHICS

Basically, this DOES NOT EFFECT THE GAME PLAY. For now it just toggles
whether or not the ending game screen is shown or not.


		    VIII. FUTURE
		    ------------
OVERVIEW

I have already begun to design version 2 of Galactic Struggle. It will
be a continuation of the development in version 1. Heavy concentration
will be placed on game play and such. "Pilots" will be added and more
emphasis will be placed on gaining experience and "improving" your
pilots, thus achieving higher goals.

Version 2 will probably be developed on the Amiga platform but I am
looking into porting it over to the IBM arena. I will probably support
Galactic Struggle for the Amiga as long as I own one.

Who knows, perhaps I could support both platforms, but I think I will
be forced to choose!

FEATURES

Some of the minor features I might add in future versions would be:

- Damaged systems : When damage is severe, certain systems wouldn't
    work properly such as weapons or cloaking.

- Pause : Ability to pause a game momentarily.
- Two Player Mode : This would make the game an over-the-modem kind
    of game. This will probably be the feature I implement first.
- Nebulas : Certain areas of space that render the ships shields
    powerless.
- Defensive Systems : Add decoys to detract seekers, super shields to
    absorb greater damage. Whatever else I could come up with.
- Additional Sounds : Cloaking, orbiting, whatever...
- Neutral Ships : Rogues & Pirates, Independent Stations
- Variable Ammo Holds : Different ships carry different amounts of
    ammo.
- Damaged Images : Ships could actually look damaged.
- More Objectives:
    -Will add "campaigns" you can enter your ship in. If you survive
     you will continue to enter campaigns and keep improving..
    -Planets will be expanded to have control and defenses, making
     things a bit more interesting.
    -Regions of space will be added that are controlled by certain
     "fleets".
- Star Cycle : Instead of just worm-holes, stars will exist that will
    explode and turn into worm-holes.
- Speed up game play : Perhaps write some of the lower level graphics
    routines in Assembler.
- Distance Indicator : To show how far from the object you are
    seeking.
- Station Creation : Add the ability to create space stations near
    planets.
- Enhanced Configuration Editor : A GUI for the configuration editor.
- Destroy Planets : Add the ability for powerful ships to destroy
    entire planets.
- Enemy WH : Give the enemy the ability to use the worm holes in a
    strategic manner.

	       X. REGISTRATION
	       ---------------
LIMITATIONS

The unregistered version has the following limitations:
- Game speed is not adjustable. In the registered version game
  speed may be changed.

- You are not allowed to switch ships. In the registered version
  you may fly any ship you like, not just scouts.

- You are not allowed to save and load games. The registered version
  allows you to save games at a space station and load them up for
  playing later.

- You are not allowed to use the auto-pilot functions. The registered
  version allows you to have auto pilot control over the ship.

- You are not allowed to use the fleet controls. The registered
  version allows you to recall all the ships, launch a full
  base attack or a full fleet attack.

- There is not configuration editor. The registered version comes
  with a crude, but effective configuration editor. The un-registered
  version ignores the configuration file.

- You can't use the worm holes. The registered version allows you to
  use the worm holes.

- A fighter is the highest ship that your fleet can produce. The
  enemy can make any ship they want. The registered version allows
  you to create any ship.


REGISTRATION
