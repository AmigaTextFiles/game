INTRODUCTION
------------

Welcome to Tornado - the most comprehensive home computer combat flight
simulator to date. Some of you will already know a good deal about
aircraft and how to fly them, and some of you will be learning these things
for the first time. We have tried hard to cater for both types of user and
to design a product of considerable entertainment and educational value.
Do not be overwhelmed by the huge manual. This is an immense product.
Options range from no-nonsense Quickstart to the multi-aircraft multi
mission campaigns, with exercises in the simulator to prepare you for a
range of combat options unsurpassed by any other product. It is only
possible to begin to appreciate the depth of Tornado after several hours of
intensive use. We expect you to continue to discover new aspects of the
product for months.

Everybody, regardless of experience level, should start by looking at the
separate Technical Supplement. This gives details of how to install the
software, and describes any differences between the version supplied for
your machine and the PC-compatible version upon which this manual is based.

Tornado is a remarkably complete simulation of the Panavia Tornado GR.4
Interdictor / Strike (IDS) and F.3 Air Defence Variant (ADV) aircraft. The
GR.4 will be the upgraded RAF version of the Tornado IDS currently flown by
the RAF, the German, Italian and Saudi Arabian air forces. If you followed
the air war in the Persian Gulf, you will know that this was the aircraft
given the job of keeping the Iraqi air force on the ground by destroying
its airfields. Its purpose in life is to penetrate deep into enemy
territory by flying as low as possible as fast as possible, and deliver
even the dumbest of "dumb" bombs with pinpoint accuracy. It can do all
these things even at night, in thick fog. At low level, in the environment
it was designed for, it is the fastest aircraft in the world.

The Tornado ADV is in service with the RAF and Saudi Arabia. It is a
modified version of the same airframe, equipped to serve as a long-range,
long- endurance two seat interceptor. It has a more powerful radar
optimised for air to-air fighting, and carries medium-range radar-guided
missiles. As the name Air Defence Variant suggests, its intended role is
to defend rather than attack, and it is normally expected to do this by
shooting down enemy bombers. It shares the all-weather capability of the
IDS version, but unlike the IDS it cannot terrain-follow.

This level of performance demands a very sophisticated aircraft. Even with
a crew of two, there is so much to do, and the situation can change so fast
that most of the time the aircraft is flown by an extremely smart
autopilot. You are about to step into the shoes of two very hard-working
aircrew. But even if this is the first flight simulator you have ever
bought, do not despair. You do not have to do it all at once, and we
provide flight training from absolute beginner level if you need it.

Simulating such a complex aircraft was not easy. It involved a phenomenal
amount of research and design but the degree of authenticity achieved would
not have been possible without the assistance of the Royal Air Force and
British Aerospace. We have done everything we can to provide a detailed
and accurate simulation of the aircraft's systems and flying qualities,
with the invaluable help of many RAF Tornado aircrew. We have also
provided a level of visual realism, density and detail which breaks new
ground for a home computer simulation, but even this is only half the
story.

Precise automatic navigation demands precise and detailed flight planning,
and our mission planning system is in many ways far in advance of the one
the RAF uses at present. This is no reflection upon the people and
organisations who developed the system in use - we have the advantage of
nearly ten years of explosive technological progress since that system was
designed.

Within the last few months of Tornado's development, the UK Ministry of
Defence has issued a development contract for a new mission planning
system, to be used for the Harrier GR.7 and potentially the Tornado GR.4.
It is called AMPA (Advanced Mission Planning Aid), due to be in service by
early 1995, and the published description (in Flight International, 20
January 1993) sounds eerily familiar to those of us who specified and
developed Tornados mission planning system. There is no question of one
being a copy of the other - we simply came to very similar conclusions
about what is possible and desirable to do with the available computer
power. But you don`t have to wait until 1995.

We never intended or presumed that this project would attract serious
attention from the people who get to fly the real thing or from the
aerospace Industry, so we were highly gratified when it did. This same
product is now under consideration for professional groundbased training
applications and we are delighted that our efforts are being recognised
outside the entertainment market.

Unlike any of our previous simulations, Tornado is designed to be the first
of many new leading-edge products. We haven't succeeded in putting in
everything that we wanted to no shortage of ideas - just time. These vast
projects involve an unbelievable investment in man power and equipment and
sooner or (usually) later, we have to get the product published in order to
fund the next one. But we do what we enjoy most and we hope it shows,

Thank you for purchasing Tornado - we hope you enjoy it.

FINDING YOUR WAY AROUND THE MANUAL
----------------------------------

All users should check their Technical Supplement to find out how to
install and start this software.

This chapter covers two main topics: one is the "Front-end" of the program
which among many other things lets you create logs, select missions and
plan them; the other is the aircraft, how to fly it" how the weapons work
and how to use them.

Chapters about the "Front-end"

Chapters 2 to 6 are the ones which describe the "Front end" Everyone needs
to read them, and most of them are short chapters. The chapter describing
the Mission Planner is the longest in the manual, but you only need to read
the first third of it to start with.

Chapter 2 - Getting Started

This describes what you see on the opening screen and how to use it. It
tells you how to start an automatic demonstration, or use the Quickstart
option to leap into combat at a single bound. It also describes how to
configure the software for your machine, set up selectable options, create
Pilot logs and use the Explore and Review modes, which are good
entertainment in themselves

Chapter 3 - Flight Options

This chapter covers the screen you reach by clicking on the large "Flight
icon on the first screen. There are three basic flight modes: Simulator,
Training and Combat; and there are four different varieties of the Combat
Option: Mission Campaign, Command and Two-Player. All the options are
briefly described

Chapter 4 - Mission Selection Screen

This is where you make your choice about what you are going to do within
the Flight or Combat option you selected, and (for the Combat options),
which of the three possible War Zones you are going to fly over.

Chapter 5 - Mission Planner

This is a monster of a chapter because the Mission planner is a very
powerful and sophisticated piece of software. The chapter is divided into
three self contained sections, and the user who just wants to fly preset
missions for the moment can get all that is required from the first of
these.

Chapter 6 - Debriefing

This brief chapter covers the report you see at the end of each flight and
what to do about it if you don't like it.

Chapters about tHe Aircraft and Weapons

These are mainly long chapters covering many topics - if you are new to the
subject there is a lot to learn. Experienced pilots can do a good deal of
skipping. and try to pick up what they need by using the Aircrew Notes in
conjunction with the Index.

Chapter 7 - Elementary Flying Training

This chapter is mainly for the benefit of users who know nothing about
aircraft or flying, including those who have never had to worry about
stalling or overspeeding before. If the aircraft refuses to fly or keeps
shaking itself to pieces around you and you cannot work out what is going
on, grit your teeth swallow your pride and start here. This chapter also
covers automatic landings and taking off

Chapter 8 - Advanced Flying Training

Large parts of this chapter build on the previous one to take a novice up
to a level where he or she can manoeuvre the aircraft freely, set up an
approach and land with a minimum of automatic help. Some of the very
powerful navigation systems and avionics of the Tornado are also described
and the chapter concludes with a section on emergencies, including the spin
recovery drill

Chapter 9 - External Views

This very short chapter describes the rich and flexible optionsfor out of
aircraft views of yourself and others.

Chapter 10 - Weapons Conversion

This chapter should be required reading for everyone, though real Tornado
pilots will be able to skim through it. They will find a few omissions and
simplifications of the systems they know most other users will be faced
with concepts and weapons they may never even have heard of before. You
will never be truly effective until you can use all the possible weapons in
all the possible modes, and you will not be able to do that unless you know
this material, one way or another.

Chapter 11 - Aircrew Notes

This is a summary description of the aircraft instruments and avionics. A
very experienced user may be able to get most of what he or she needs to
know from this chapter in conjunction with the Control Summary card, using
the Index to find detailed descriptions where more explanation is wanted.
Once you know roughly what is available, you can use this chapter for quick
reference

Chapter 12 - Reference

This gives drawings and basic data on aircraft, vehicles and weapons
appearing in Tornado. Know your enemy - and your allies. We should add
the Disclaimer that we are not trying to re-fight the Cold War; we chose
CIS equipment for the "orange" forces because most of these systems
correspond neatly, one to one, with "blue`s" Western equipment. As far as
we are aware all the CIS equipment which features in Tornado is being
actively marketed to the world at large, so "orange" could be almost
anybody. Just add your favourite dictator and stir.

GETTING STARTED
---------------

The Main Screen

All users should consult the separate Technical Supplement for details of
how to install and run Tornado on their particular type of computer. If
you find differences between what is described in this manual and what
appears on your screen, check with the Technical Supplement. Once you have
started the program and the title sequence has finished, you should find
yourself looking at the Main Screen the "Front End" of Tornado. The
overall structure of the program is shown opposite in diagram 2 1.

The Flight Icon

The Main Screen is dominated by the large triangular icon in the centre
labelled "Flight" Do not do this straight away, but if you place the mouse
pointer over this icon and click the left mouse button it will start you on
the normal path to the aircraft, through further stages of selection and
mission planning. The stages in this path are explained in two short
chapters; "Flight Options" and "The Mission Selection Screen"; and one very
long chapter on the Mission Planner

Below the Flight icon are two smaller rectangular icons labelled "Demo" and
"Quickstart".

The Demo Icon

Clicking on this icon changes it into a panel of separate buttons, each
labeled to describe a different kind of demonstration display. If you want
a demonstration of Tornado, place the mouse pointer over one of these
buttons and click the left mouse button. After a pause for loading, the
demonstration will start. When you have seen enough, hold down the Ctrl
key and press Q to return to this screen

The Quickstart Icon

The Quickstart options will put you straight into the cockpit, in flight
and in action. Though there is a vast depth of gameplay available in
Tornado through the Mission Planning functions, not everyone will want to
go through the whole process every time - and however keen you are it will
take time to learn how to use the Mission Planner. Quickstart lets you
bypass the planning process and the need to take off or land.

Just like the Demo icon, the Quickstart icon changes into a panel of
buttons when you click on it. Four choices are offered, easy and hard
variations on air to air and air to-ground combat. Click on the one you
want, and you will find yourself in the cockpit, in the thick of the
action. The Air-to-ground options put you in the cockpit of an IDS
(Interdictor/Strike) Tornado, with a payload of bombs, while the air to-air
options give you a Tornado ADV (Air Defence Variant), the interceptor
version, armed with air to air missiles

Before you try out Quickstart, read the section at the end of this chapter
which attempts to put over the absolute minimum you need to know to avoid
instant frustration. The Easy Quickstart options make you immune to the
enemys weapons and most of the consequences of hitting the ground, but it
is still entirely possible to destroy or cripple the aircraft if you do not
know roughly why and how to use the wing sweep system. The weapons systems
are also realistic, and do not have the magical properties you may have
come to expect If you want hits you are going to have to work for them

The Tornado User Interface

Most computer users should be able to handle our point-and-click system at
a glance, but we do use a few novel conventions we have invented for our
own purposes. Here we will try to explain how the system works from
absolute basics upwards. Experienced users should bear with us - some of
this will be new to them as well.

Pointing and Clicking

The front-end of the Tornado system (that is, everything outside the
cockpit of the aircraft), is designed to be controlled exclusively by your
mouse. The only time you will need to use the keyboard is to type in names
when creating Pilot logs. To activate a function, you just move the mouse
over your desk to place the mouse pointer symbol on the screen (a small
upright cross) over an icon or a button (both are defined below), and click
the left button on the mouse. The right mouse button is only used to move
about and change zoom levels on the Mission Planner Map.

Icons and Buttons

Icons are picture-symbols with borders around them, like the Flight, Demo
and Quickstart symbols on the Main Screen. Buttons are small outlined
panels with text in them, like the rectangles marked "Options " and "Exit"
in the lower right corner of the screen.

Sometimes clicking on an icon or a button will cause an immediate action
sometimes the icon will subdivide into smaller icons (or buttons) to offer
you more choices, and sometimes it will call up a window (see below), which
may display text and/or contain still more buttons.

Many buttons will change colour when you click on them, to indicate that
the function or option they control is selected (switched on). Sometimes
you will see a row or column of buttons, only one of which may be selected
at a time - these are often called "radio buttons". Most of the time the
text on the buttons should tell you what they mean and what they do. If it
is not oblious, check with this manual. If a button disappears after you
make a selection, it is because that button`s function is now irrelelant or
inappropriate.

There are two special types of button which are peculiar to Tornado; the
Cycle button and the Figure button

Cycle buttons

A Cycle button is a space-saling substitute for a bank of "radio buttons".
It is a small square button with a circle/arrow symbol in it, always placed
to the left of a short text panel describing an option or a state.
Clicking on the Cycle button changes the text, selecting a different option
or state. Up to four different options may be selectable by clicking
repeatedly on a Cycle button.

The first Cycle button you are likely to encounter is the one on the
Preferences screen (see below)

Figure buttons

Figure buttons are provided where you need precise control over a figure
(usually a time, a speed or an altitude). The digits of the figure,
sometimes grouped together, will be outlined to mark them as buttons. To
change the figure, click on the button showing the digit(s) you are
interested in. This will cause two further buttons to appear, marked with
arrows, one above and one below the digit(s). Click on the arrow buttons
to change the figure up and down by one; click and hold down the mouse
button for rapid change.

When you change a digit up past 9 or down past 0 the next digit up will
also change up or down, even though it is not selected. You can instantly
select another digit to change by clicking on it, or dismiss the arrow
buttons by clicking again on the selected digit itself.

Windows

These are independent superimposed panels (like small inset screens within
the larger screen) showing text, or groups of related buttons, or both.
Each has a specific purpose. You will find most of them in the Mission
Planner, though they do occur elsewhere. All the windows you will see in
Tornado have a title Bar, which should usually explain what they are for.
Any window may be moved (dragged) anywhere on the screen by clicking in the
Title Bar and holding down the mouse button. Moving the mouse will then
drag an outline of the window across the screen. When it is in the place
where you want it, release the mouse button and the window will be redrawn
in its new position.

Most windows also have a Close box. This is found at the left-hand end of
the Title Bar. Clicking in the Close box will close the window, causing it
to disappear. Some windows do not have a Close box, either because there
is no reason for closing them or because they are telling you something it
would be unwise to ignore, like the Problems window in the Mission Planner
which tells you when your flightplan is risky or outright suicidal.

Windows can lie on top of one another, partly or totally overlapping. If
the one you want is behind another, just click in the Title Bar of the
window you are interested in to put it in front. On the PC version at
least, you can choose whether the windows themselves are opaque or
semi-transparent (see the preferences option below).

OPTIONS.../EXIT BUTTONS

In the bottom right corner of all screens (except when flying, exploring or
going through a recognition review) is a pair of buttons, marked "Exit" and
"Options" If you click on "Exit" you will go back to the previous screen,
or if you are on the main screen (the first screen), you will be asked if
you want to quit the program. Whenever this button is shown, the option is
always available, and you can use it without incurring penalties.

The upper of the two buttons, marked "Options" works in a different way. If
you click on this and hold down the mouse button, it will expand into a menu
showing the following options;

System  Allows you to quit the program immediately
Preferences For fine-tuning the program for your equipment
Explore  Lets you explore any map as a disembodied eye
Review  Shows all military aircraft and fighting vehicles
Log   For creating, selecting or reviewing Pilot Logs
Cancel  Does nothing - the safe option!

When the menu first appears, the "Cancel" item is under the mouse pointer.
Keep holding the mouse button down and move the pointer up and down over
the menu. You will see that each item is highlighted in turn as the
pointer moves over it. Move the pointer back down over "Cancel" and
release the button. The menu collapses back into the "Options" button, and
nothing else happens - which is just what the "Cancel" option is supposed
to do nothing.

All the items in this menu work the same way; click on "Options..." and
hold down the button, move the pointer till the item you want is
highlighted, and then release the button.

The "System" and "Cancel" options do not really need explaining. The other
options are explained in the following sections. Several of these call up
screens which themselves contain the "Options..." and "Exit" buttons.
Clicking on "Exit" from any of these will return you to the previous
screen.

PREFERENCES

This screen allows you to preset various optional features of the
simulation, to select sound hardware where appropriate, and to turn the
title music on and off. Many of these switches are provided to allow you
to cut down on detail and improve speed, if you think that your computer is
running too slowly - it takes a fast machine to run Tornado at a high frame
rate if all the options are turned on.

The switches on this screen divide into three groups. One of these groups
almost exactly duplicates the switches avaIlable in flight using the
Kneepad (Look Down) View, and is mainly concerned with setting up the
simulation environment. On the Kneepad, you switch options by pressing the
number keys on the top row of the keyboard, here you point and click.

Simulation Preferences

Visual Range

In your outside views, nothing will be drawn beyond the selected Visual
Range, which is given in miles. Click on a figure to select it.

                 More <---  DETAIL  ---> Less
                 25   20     15      10   5
               Slower <---  SPEED   ---> Faster

Ground

This switch will turn on or off most of the groups of trees and the field
patterns we have provided to give a true sensation of speed and depth in
low-level flight

                 More <---  DETAIL ---> Less
               Textured                Plain
               Slower <---  SPEED  ---> Faster


Hills

We chose not to use the currently-fashionable Gouraud shading effect to
represent undulating landscape. This looks very good in the distance, but
makes it nearly impossible to judge your height above ground by eye because
close to the aircraft the shading degenerates into an unstable shifting
mass of colour. Instead, when this switch is set to "Textured" the faces
making up the hills will subdivide into smaller counter-shaded faces as you
approach them. This may not look as flashy, but it is stable, and it lets
you judge depth and distance well enough to terrain follow manually - if
you are up to it.

                More <--- DETAIL ---> Less
                Textured               Plain
                Slower <--- SPEED  ---> Faster

Horizon

This allows you to choose between a smoothly graduated horizon (Faded) and
a plain blue sky ("Plain"). Click on the option of your choice.

                  More <--- DETAIL ---> Less
                 Faded                 Plain
                Slower <--- SPEED  ---> Faster

Sky

This switch allows you to turn the thin layers of individual clouds on
(textured) or off (Plain). The overcast effect (a thick solid cloud layer)
will not be affected

                  More <--- DETAIL ---> Less
                Textured               Plain
                Slower <--- SPEED  ---> Faster 

Ironwork

This peculiarly-named switch controls whether you will see the cockpit
canopy framework and the brackets supporting the Head-up Display. Turning
this switch off will speed up the frame rate considerably on slower
computers.

                 More <--- DETAIL ---> Less
                  On                    Off
               Slower <--- SPEED  ---> Faster


Control Device

This switch allows you to select which of a range of possible devices you
will use to fly the aircraft. Click on the Cycle button repeatedly to see
the range of options available, then leave the desired option showing the
options available will differ from one computer to another; those described
here apply to the PC version, but users of ALL machines should check their
Technical Supplement for changes:

Keyboard 1 Pitch and roll control by numeric keypad / cursor keys. Control
input increases the longer you hold the key down, but returns to neutral
when the key is released.

Keyboard 2 Pitch and roll control by numeric keypad/cursor keys. Control
input increases the longer you hold the key down. When you release the key
the control input stays at its last level - if you want to stop rolling or
pitching you`ve got to make an opposite input, or hit the Autotrim key (5 -
numeric pad).

Joystick 1 Pitch and roll control by single analogue joystick in game port
1.

Joystick 2 Pitch and roll control by analogue joystick in port 1, throttle
and rudder control by second analogue joystick in port 2.

Recalibrate Joystick

This button is used to ensure that the computer recognises the centre
position of your joystick(s). Let the joystick spring to its centre
position and then click on this button. If you find that the aircraft is
developing a persistent roll or a tendency to climb or dive, it is almost
certainly because your joystick centre position is drifting over time. You
can recalibrate in flight by centring the stick and hitting the Y key.

Sound and Music Preferences

Sound hardware varies a lot between computers - even between PCs. Check
the Technical Supplement for your machine to sort out the specific details
There are two options which will always be present on this page, however:

Effects

There are three "radio buttons" for this option "Off" switches off all
sound effects; "On-Eng" gives you all sound effects except the noise of
your own engines, and "On+Eng" gives you all sound effects including your
own engine noise.

Music

This switches the front-end incidental music on or off

Miscellaneous Preferences

This is a catch-all group with a lot of unrelated options in it.

Review Stills

The digitised pictures of aircraft and vehicles available in Review mode
(see below) are high quaiity images, but they do take up a lot of disc
space. If you have installed a working copy of Tornado on a hard disc and
you want to reclaim the disc-space used by these images you can click on
the "Delete" button here to remove them from the installed copy. When you
have deleted these images, you can only get them back by re-installing the
program.

Panel lighting

This switch allows you to select red or green cockpit lighting for flying
at night. Real Tornados may be fitted with either option, and we thought
that both looked good. The brightness of the cockpit lighting is set
according to how dark it is outside, and you can also adjust the HUD
contrast to avoid dazzling yourself on a dark night (see the Cockpit
Controls section on the Control Summary card). We recommend dimming the
room lights when flying at night.

Curve Segments

On the Mission Planner map, curves are drawn in flightplans wherever you
change course. When there are a lot of curves (and a lot of flightplans)
to draw, producing smooth curves can take up a surprising amount of
computer time - a smooth curve has to be drawn as a lot of short straight
lines. The "radio buttons" for this option allow you to choose how many
lines will be drawn to represent a curve.

                 Smoother <--- CURVE ---> Coarser
                        32   16   8   4   2
                  Slower  <--- SPEED ---> Faster

Contour Interval

Contours are shown on the Mission Planner map to give you an idea of the
height and shape of hills. Like curve-drawing, this can consume a lot of
processing power and slow your machine down noticeably. These radio
buttons, let you select the interval between contours in feet. The lowest
contour drawn is always the 250 line.

                   More <--- CONTOURS ---> Fewer
                    250        500          1000
                 Slower <---  SPEED   ---> Faster

Windows

This option may not be available for all versions. When it is, you have a
choice between see through windows and solid ones. On the Mission PIanner
map, transparent windows let you see through the window to the map, but
solid windows are drawn faster.

                Transparent <--- WINDOWS ---> Solid

                    Slower  <--- SPEED   ---> Faster

EXPLORE

Explore Mode is a highly useful feature which is also good fun. When you
select the Explore option the screen changes to show you a full screen
window onto a map of the current Flying Area. When in Simulator or
Training modes, this will always be the Training Area, but when you select
Combat, the Mission Selection Screen provides the facility to choose any
one of three different War Zones. If you move the mouse pointer against
any screen edge, the screen window will be dragged across the map in the
corresponding direction. Click on the LEFT mouse button to zoom in, click
RIGHT to zoom out. Note that when you do this the point under the mouse
pointer will be moved to the centre of the screen.

Click on some recognisable feature (a city or an airfield, say), and then
hit the Spacabar or the Enter key. You will find that your view is now
that of a disembodied eye floating sixteen feet above ground level at the
spot you clicked upon. Using the keyboard, the mouse or joystick(s) you
can now move at will in three dimensions at high speed, or hover on the
spot. You can go almost anywhere and see anything except the positions of
aircraft and vehicles.

At any time you can flip back to the map screen, click on another point as
far away as you like, and then return to the three-dimensional world at
that spot. You can use this system for entertainment, for familiarising
yourself with the landmarks, or within the Mission Planner to find out how
your target will appear as you approach it. The military term generally
used for this is Mission Rehearsal, and armed forces everywhere are trying
to acquire this sort of facility, for obvious reasons.

You will find a complete list of the Explore Mode controls in the separate
Control Summary. To leave Explore mode, hold down the Ctrl key and hit Q

REVIEW

The Review feature allows you to see digitised photographs of the aircraft
and military lehicles you will encounter, and compare them with the 3D
models representing them in Tornado. There are two main purposes for this:
on the one hand it helps you develop the ability to recognise friendly and
enemy hardware. On the other, it shows off the models, of which we are
very proud. The guiding principle in constructing these models has been
that if you can recognise the real thing you should be able to recognise
the model, and vice versa.

When you enter Review mode, you will see the screen split between an upper
display area where the models are shown and a lower area showing the
aircraft or vehicle name with a control panel. The Icons on the panel are
explained in diagram 2 2. Clicking on the film strip icon displays a full
screen digitised picture. To return to the model display just click on
either of the mouse buttons. Keystrokes can be substituted for some of the
mouse commands (see the Control Summary) If you want more detailed
information on a particular aircraft or vehicle, look it up in the
Reference section of this manual. To leave Review mode hold down the Ctrl
key and hit Q, or click on the Eject button.

LOGS

The Pilot Log system is a schizophrenic`s paradise: it allows you to be up
to 20 different people. Any time you`re flying a Tornado, you are doing so
under one of these 20 possible identities, with a name, a nominal RAF rank
and a record of flying hours and experience. Most of these identities you
create for yourself by choosing a name and typing in, but one is special -
the default log. This log is supplied with the software, and is
automatically selected every time you start Tornado. The log is in the
name of Group Captain deFault and you can use it just like any other log,
but it has several interesting features.

One of Group Captain deFault`s good points is his rank equal to the highest
available in Tornado. Using this log identity you are automatically
qualified to play the Command wargame, which is only open to pilots who
have earned the notional rank of Wing Commander or above (see the table of
RAF ranks below). You can earn promotion for a pilot whose log you created
yourself, but this sort of rank is not awarded lightly. See the Flight
Options chapter to find out how to win promotion - we have made it possible
to skip rank if you are good enough.

The other good thing about Group Captain deFault is that he is
indestructible. You are not do not attempt to emulate him. Actually, that
is not quite true - it depends on your attitude to cheating. See the
section below headed "Cheating"

Whenever you play a Quickstart game, the deFault log will always be used,
regardless of which log is selected.

Using the Log Screen

The Log Screen looks rather like the Mission Selection Screen, which you
will come across elsewhere. The left-hand half of the screen is dedicated
to displaying the Roster, a list of all existing pilots, by rank, name and
status. A pilot`s status may be Actile, Missing, POW (Prisoner of War),
KIT (Killed in Training), KIA (Killed in Action) or Dismissed. Only pilots
with Active status can fly. Initially there is only Group Captain
deFault`s name on the list. As you create identities for yourself, the
list will expand downwards to its maximum of 20 names, in descending order
of rank and experience. For reference, here are the RAF ranks we have
unilaterally borrowed to indicate levels of experience and achievement,
together with their USAF equivalents:

RAF USAF Group Captain Colonel Wing Commander Lieutenant-Colonel Squadron
Leader Major Flight Lieutenant Captain Flying Officer Lieutenant

In real life, the relationship between RAF ranks and the size of the units
led has changed since the ranks were named not long after the First World
War. In general, a Wing Commander now commands a Squadron, and a Squadron
Leader leads a Flight. The majority of operational aircrew hold the rank
of Flight Lieutenant

One of the names on the list will always be selected and highlighted. A
smaller window on the right hand side of the screen (the Record window)
shows details of the selected pilot`s record. When more than one name
appears on the Roster, you can select which log to display by clicking on
the name you want

If you call up the Log Screen after selecting the "Command" wargame option,
only the logs of qualified pilots will be shown on the Roster

Creating, Deleting and Renaming Logs

Buttons labelled "Create Log" "Rename" and "Delete Log" appear on the right
hand side of the screen. These buttons will automatically be enabled and
disabled depending on the situation. The "Create Log" button will only be
available if there are less than 20 names on the Roster. If the Roster is
full and you want to create a new identity, you must first delete an
existing log. This is done by clicking on a disposable log to select it,
then clicking on the "Delete Log" button. You will then be asked to click
again to confirm that you really do want to lose this log. "Delete Log"
will not be available if the currently selected log is that of Group
Captain deFault.

Clicking on the Create button brings up the Record window with a blank name
and record. You can now type in the name you want, using Backspace to
correct mistakes. When you are finished, click on the "OK" button at the
bottom of the Record window, and your new pilot will be added to the
roster. All new logs are created with the rank of Flying Officer.

If you want to rename an existing pilot, select that log by clicking on the
Roster and then click on the Rename button. This will activate the text
cursor on the name line in the Record window, and you can use Backspace and
type in the normal way. Click on OK when you are finished.

Leaving the Log Screen

When you have selected the Log you want to use, click on the Exit button in
the lower right corner to leave this Screen. If the Log you have selected
is not that of an Active pilot, a small window will appear to remind you
that you cannot leave this screen until you have selected an Active log to
use. The warning window will not disappear until you have done this, but
it can be dragged out of the way.

Cheating

Everyone`s luck must run out sometime, especially if you make a habit of
relying on it. In our last major simulator, "F-16 Combat Pilot" pilots who
were killed or captured had their logs deleted, period. There were ways to
get around this (like backing up your log files), but we received a lot of
anguished phone calls from people who could not bear to lose their
hard-earned records and privileges. This time around we have left it up to
you to decide whether or not to accept the fortunes of war.

At the end of every flight you will get a Debrief, and unless you are using
the deFault log you will be offered a choice between logging the mission or
wiping it off the record. If you choose to load it, the hours flown and
any other achievements will be added to your record and if you did not make
it, the status of the log will change to "Missing" "POW" "KIT" "KIA" or
"Dismissed" There is no way back once the mission result is logged, so do
not do this unless you are prepared to suffer the consequences. You cannot
get killed or captured in the Simulator, or in a Two Player engagement.
When you choose to log the result, you will be returned to the Mission
Selection Screen, the Mission Planner, or the Flight Options screen,
depending on the type of mission you were flying and its outcome.

If you choose NOT to log the mission, however, absolutely no changes will
be made to your log it will be as if the mission never happened. If you
came through the Mission Planner, you will return to it with your last
flightplan still intact (the clock will be set back if it is a Campaign or
Command mission). so you can either try it again or exit from the Mission
Planner in the normal way.

THE QUICKSTART USER'S GUIDE

or

(The Tornado manual for the terminally impatient.)

This brief section tries to give you the bare minimum information to try
out the Easy Quickstart options without running into instant frustration.
We cannot hope to accomplish more than that in a few paragraphs. Once you
have had a quick blast, go back to the first chapter (Finding Your Way
Around), and use it to figure out what you really need to read. All key
references below correspond to the PC version. Check your Control Summary
for correct control keys if you are not using a PC.

Unlike many other simulators, Tornado does not provide an "arcade
spaceship" flight model with unlimited engine power and instant
acceleration or braking - you will have to learn to live with the
limitations of a realistic aircraft. For the Quickstart options, we have
made things much easier by giving you an aircraft that ignores the weight
of fuel bombs and missiles and behaves as if it were carrying nothing but
its own empty weight, though your fuel gauge will show full and your
weapons will be replaced the moment you use them. You will also start off
with the Autothrottle engaged, so the engines will throttle automatically
to keep you at a set speed, which you can change up and down by using the
throttle control device (+ and - keys or a second joystick).

The most important difference between a Tornado and most other aircraft is
that the Tornado has variable-sweep wings. You sweep these forward to
manoeuvre better at low speeds, and back to accelerate to high speeds. If
you try to go too fast for your wingsweep setting, the aircraft will start
to shake and rumble, if you persist a warning will sound go on too long and
the aircraft will shake itself to pieces.

You can prevent this by sweeping the wings back at the first sign of
trouble There are three stages of wingsweep, and each time you hit the S
key, the wings will sweep back one stage. To turn off the warning if it
sounds, hit the Master Warning Reset key (* or I key). This will turn off
the flashing lights provided that you have fixed the problem, though the
wing sweep system will jam in one position if you neglect the buffeting for
too long. If you are flying slowly, and the aircraft will not turn fast
enough or stops flying and drops its nose, sweep the wings forward by
hitting the W key - once for each stage.

If you are on an air-to-ground mission, just hit the Arm air-to-ground key
ENTER key). This will arm your bombs and give you a bombsight on the Head
Up Display (HUD). Your bombload is set to drop in Manual mode, which means
that when you hit the Commit key (Spacebar or joystick button), the bombs
will be released immediately, and they should fall where the short
horizontal line (the CCIP) crosses the longer vertical one with a gap near
the top (the Bomb Fall Line). If the top of the Bomb Fall Line is below
the CCIP, it means that you`re too low the aircraft will probably be
damaged or destroyed when the bombs go off. In Quickstart mode you can
attack anything you like.

When you use the Air-to-air option, the first thing you must do is turn on
the radar in Airmode (Alt+R), which will bring up a plan display of the
radar image on the central Multi-Function Display (MFD). Enemy aircraft in
front of you will be shown as small square symbols. You must also hit Arm
air-to-air (Alt + Enter) Now you can select which air to-air weapon you
want (; key). In the Tornado ADV you have three air-to-air weapons to
choose from; cannon for closer range (GUNS), heat-seeking short-range
Sidewinder missiles (AIM9), and medium - range (up to 20 miles)
radar-guided Active Sky Flash missiles (SKYF). The final thing you have to
do is lock on to your target. There is a Designate key Caps Lock, which
will select the target closest to dead-ahead. The symbol on the radar will
now flash, and a target designator and other sighting symbols will be shown
on the HUD. Be aware that the radar can see further than the seeker head
on the Sidewinder missiles you will not be allowed to fire until the
missile can see the target and you can hear the lock-on tone

Refer to the Aircrew Notes " Chapter 11" to find out what the HUD symbols
mean.

FLIGHT OPTIONS
--------------

In the centre of the Main Screen is the large triangular "Flight" icon.
Click on this with the mouse pointer, and it divides to offer three
choices: Simulator, Training, and Combat. At the same time the Demo and
Quickstart icons will be replaced by icons for the Log and Preferences
facilities. Clicking on these icons produces exactly the same result as
selecting the corresponding items in the "Options..." menu" which is still
available on this screen. If you want to go back in order to select Demo
or Quickstart, click on the "Exit" button in the bottom right-hand corner.

TORNADO caters for a very wide range of skill and knowledge. In the
simulator or in live training a novice can learn how to fly, or an
experienced pilot can become familiar with the aircraft and its systems and
perform practice attacks with every available weapon. When you`re ready,
and not before, click on the "Combat" icon to go to war - but don`t start
with the Combat option unless you insist on learning the hard way! This
chapter will explain the choices available to you.

SIMULATOR

This is the logical place to start, whatever your experience level.
Crashes don`t matter in the simulator - just restart the exercise and
repeat it until you don`t crash. You can even arrange that the aircraft
will bounce off the ground rather than crash! The other great advantage of
the simulator is that exercises can start in mid air. If you want flying
training, read the Elementary and Advanced Flying Training chapters, and
work through the simulator exercises recommended. More experienced pilots
will probably want to familiarise themselves with the aircraft handling and
systems here. Weapons training and practice is also available and highly
convenient see the Weapons Conversion chapter for details. All the lives
can be flown in the simulator with optional simulated enemy activity.
There are also a number of exercises unique to the simulator, allowing you
to practise emergency procedures like spin recovery, engine-out handling
and landing, and landing with your wings stuck at maximum sweep. The
simulator also provides a good range of "cheat modes".

If you are using a log you have created yourself, flight time in the
simulator will be recorded, though it will be logged as "Simulator Hours"
rather than "Flying Hours". It still counts as experience. Simulator
exercises always take place over the Training Area.

TRAINING

This offers live flight training. No-one will be shooting at you, but you
can still kill yourself. You can avoid the consequences of your errors
altogether if you wish - see the Pilot Log section under "Options" (and
look for the heading "Cheating"). Live flight exercises must obliously
start and finish on the ground - preferably on the runway. This facility
mainly serves as a confidence builder once you have developed your skills
in simulator exercises. Live training always takes place on the Training
area map.

COMBAT

If you select "Combat" then you`re going to war. Don`t select this option
until you`re ready for it. There are four different sub-options
available," each of which is described below. If you are new to this sort
of warfare, start working through the "Mission" list. If not, fly a
"Mission" or two for practice and then go straight to the "Campaign"
options. A successful Level 2 Campaign is the only way to qualify for
"Command" in your own right, though any pilot may try out "Command" using
the log identity of Group Captain deFault. Combat allows you to select and
fight in any Flying Area except the Training Area

After clicking on the "Combat" Icon" you are presented with a new screen
showing four icons giving you a choice of four different types of play:

Two-player lets you connect your computer to a friend`s and fight a human
opponent one-to-one. The connection may be made directly or by modem. Any
rank of pilot may use this facility. See the Technical Supplement for
further details.

Mission lets you choose from a selection of completely pre-planned
missions. Each mission is a complete game in itself, and the outcome of
any one mission has no effect on any other. This option is available to
any rank. If any pilot successfully completes all the missions(s) he will
be promoted to Flight Lieutenant, unless the current rank is already
greater. Two Missions are different from all the others in that they are
not pre-planned. These are the missions titled "Free Fire (IDS)" and "Free
Fire (ADV)" where no targets are assigned and you are free to attack
whatever you like. These missions are intended to serve as an introduction
to the job of planning missions for yourself.

Campaign lets you choose from a selection of scenarios. Each one requires
you to fly a sequence of missions to achieve a final objective. The
individual missions are not pre-planned in detail for you, but the
objective for each is specified. The situation at the start of each
mission reflects the success (or otherwise) of the previous one. The
Campaign state may be saved at the end of each mission, to be continued
later. This option is available to any rank. Campaigns are graded into
two levels. In a Level One Campaign, you will be responsible for creating
flightplans for just one aircraft your own. In a level Two Campaign,
however, you must plan missions for a whole formation.

Successful completion of a Level One Campaign will earn the pilot a
promotion to Squadron Leader, whatever the current rank, but successful
completion of a Level Two Campaign yields a promotion to Wing Commander.

Command gives you total command authority to conduct your own air war. You
must decide your own objectives as well as plan the missions and fly a
proportion of them. The war continues until you win, lose or reach a
stalemate but the status can be saved and reloaded so you don`t have to
fight your war in one continuous session.

n.b Only qualified pilots (with the rank of Wing Commander or above) can
assume Command. Group Captain deFault is already qualified, but any new
pilot only qualifies when (s)he logs at least one successful Level Two
Campaign. A successful Command earns a promotion to Group Captain.

WHAT HAPPENS NOW?

Whether you select Simulator, Training or one of the Combat options, you
will always find yourself on the Mission Selection Screen, which allows you
to choose exactly what you will be doing, a specific Simulator or Training
exercise, or a specific Combat situation. The Mission Selection Screen is
described in detail in the next chapter.

If you have selected Simulator, you may progress from selecting a given
exercise straight to the cockpit. In all Training and Combat situations,
and some Simulator exercises, however, you will move from the Mission
Selector on to the Mission Planner, to review or create your flightplan or
take command of your war. The Mission Planner is described in detail in a
chapter of its own

Once you have reviewed all the relevant data - at a minimum this will be
your own flightplan and familiarised yourself with the target(s), the
method of attack, and the threats from SAMs, AAA and fighters on or near
the route, you will be able to check your aircraft`s fuel and weapon load,
and add defensive weapons - weight permitting.

When this is done, the mission flightplan is loaded into your aircraft`s
navigation systems, and it`s time to take off. When the mission ends - one
way or another - you`ll receive a debrief assessing your performance. At
this point you will have the choice of whether to log the mission or not.
If you`ve died or gone missing but think this was unfair DON'T LOG THE
MISSION or else your log will be closed (this doesn`t apply to Group
Captain deFault, who is indestructible). If the mission was unsuccessful,
or if you just want to do it again for practice you can return to the
Mission Planner, review or adjust the flightplan and then select "Take off"
to go straight back to the cockpit.

THE MISSION SELECTION SCREEN
----------------------------

There are two main sections on this screen. The large area on the left is
the Situation Menu - a list of all the situation options which apply to the
Flight mode you`ve selected - simulator or training exercises, single
missions, Campaign Scenarios and saved games, or Command Scenarios and
saved games.

What you see on the right-hand side of this screen depends entirely upon
the Flight Mode. This area is used to offer choices specific to each mode.
See the separate sections below for details.

THE SITUATION MENU

Whichever Flight Option - Simulator, Training or Combat brought you to this
screen, this part of the Mission Selection screen will always look much the
same, and work in much the same way very much like the Pilot Log system.
It offers you a list of situations or scenarios, from which you must select
one. The range of situations offered will automatically be limited to
those appropriate for the Simulator, Training, or whichever Combat option
you have chosen.

Each item on the list is a one-line description or title. To take a closer
look at a possible choice, click on the line you`re interested in. A new
window - the Briefing window will appear on the screen giving a fuller
description, which may (depending on the situation) include such things as
the Tasking order specifying the target(s), times and the number of
aircraft, a summary of a complete Flightplan, the description of the
military situation at the start of a Campaign or Command game, or a
situation summary for a saved game.

Two buttons will always appear at the bottom of this window; one marked
Commit, and the other marked "Cancel". If this situation or mission
appeals to you, and you want to do it, click on "Commit" to advance to the
Mission Planner, or straight into the cockpit in the case of some Simulator
exercises. You can still reverse your choice if necessary, by using the
the "Options../Exit" device in the Mission Planner, or Ctrl Q in the
cockpit. If you want to go back to the list and look at other
possibilities, click on "Cancel" and the Briefing window will close,
returning you to the Mission Selection list. There is no penalty for
browsing.

Situation Menu for Simulator

A wide variety of training exercises are available here, some of which will
pass you on to the Mission Planner, and some of which will put you straight
into the cockpit in flight.

Situation Menu for Training

These are a selection of training exercises to be flown live. Because
these are "real-world" exercises none of them permit you to start in mid
air. Crashes can and usually will be fatal, striking unplanned targets
will normally be cause for court-martial.

Situation Menu for Missions

Every mission here is pre-planned for you - except the missions titled
"Free Fire". The range covers almost everything you can do with IDS and
ADV Tornados. A range of missions exists for each of the three different
War Zones, so there`s a good deal of choice. The relative difficulty level
is indicated in the Briefing Window for each mission.

Situation Menu for Campaigns

The selection list for Campaigns is divided into sections. The upper of
these sections is a list of scenarios, alternative starting situations for
a Campaign mission sequence. Each scenario is tagged as Level 1 or Level
2, according to whether you will be expected to plan missions for 1 ) just
your own aircraft, or 2) your whole flight. Level 2 requires more
experience than Level 1, and obviously involves more work. There is an
equivalent list of Campaign scenarios for each of the three War Zones

The lower section of the list is available for saving and loading
uncompleted Campaigns. If you exit from the Mission Planner in the middle
of a Campaign, you will be asked whether or not you wish to save the game
in order to return to it later. Saved games in the list are identified by
scenario, Pilot Log name, and elapsed time within the campaign. You can
save one Level 1 and one Level 2 Campaign per War Zone at any one time, a
total of six. To reload a saved Campaign, just click on the appropriate
slot in the list. The Briefing Window will provide a situation summary
with the usual Commit and Cancel buttons.

Situation Menu for Command

This works very much like the Campaign menu described above, providing a
list of alternative starting scenarios and one saved game slot per War
Zone.

Situation Menu for TwotPlayer Mode

For details of how the two-player option works on your computer, consult
the Technical Supplement

OTHER OPTIONS AVAILABLE

Choice of War Zones (Combat Modes)

This applies only to Combat Flight Modes; Simulator and Training exercises
always use the Training Area. In all Combat modes except Two-player you
have the choice of three War Zones, each with different topography
presenting a variety of strategic and tactical challenges and
opportunities.

When you enter the Mission Selection Screen in Combat modes, a map image of
the currently selected War Zone is shown on the right-hand side of the
screen. To the left of the title showing "WarZone 1" (or 2 or 3), is a
small button showing a circle / arrow symbol. This is a Cycle button" and
clicking on it will select each War Zone in turn. You will see many other
Cycle buttons in the Mission Planner and elsewhere in Tornado, but they all
work in the same way; clicking repeatedly on the button selects each option
in turn from a range of two or more choices.

Simulator Options

This bank of switches controls features which can be provided in the
simulator but are impossible in the real world. For every feature except
Time there is a just one control; a Cycle button. Click on the Cycle
buttons to set up the options you want. The list incudes:

Feature                   Options
Weapons                   Limited / Infinite
Fuel                      Limited / Infinite
G-LOC                     Possible / Impossible
Aircraft Weight           Actual / Minimum
Aircraft Collisions       Crash / Bounce
Enemy                     Active / Inactive
Time                      Set any start time on 24 Hour clock

The Time option can be used to specify whether you fly in daylight,
dawn/dusk or varying degrees of darkness. Hours, Minutes and Seconds each
appear on a separate button. Click on the button for Hours, for example,
and two separate buttons marked with arrows will appear above and below the
Hours figure. Clicking on these will set the time forward or back. A
single click will change the time by one hour; click and hold down the
button for fast forward and fast reverse effects. Clicking again on the
figure itself or on another column (eg. minutes or seconds) will dismiss
the arrow buttons. When the Simulator mission takes you to the Mission
Planner rather than straight into the cockpit you can override the time
selection again from there, if you wish.

THE MISSION PLANNER
-------------------

Introduction

This is the most important and the most powerful screen of all. Using it
you can review or plan a single mission or a squadron`s flightplans for a
whole air war down to the smallest detail. A vast amount of information is
available, but you have absolute control over what is and is not displayed.

Before you try to study this chapter in depth, we strongly suggest that you
learn how to fly the aircraft and use the weapons. Mission planning
doesn`t really make much sense till you`re ready to fly missions.

How this chapter is organised

Because the Mission Planner is so powerful and so rich in features, there
is a lot of ground to cover in this chapter. Rather than force you to read
it all from start to finish, we have broken the explanation down into three
sections of which the beginner need only read the first.

The first section covers the basic features of the Mission Planner, showing
you how to move around the map, how to zoom in and out and how to use the
key to control how much data is displayed on the map. This section teaches
you how to review a preset Flightplan, and covers all you need to fly
single Missions.

The second section is intended for pilots aiming to plan their own
missions, whether for a "Free Fire" Mission or to fly at Campaign level.
It assumes that you have read and understood the first section, and
explains how to create a Flightplan first for a single aircraft (Free Fire
or Level One Campaign), and then for a whole flight of aircraft (Level Two
Campaign).

The third section covers the features you need at Command level. It
assumes that you are familiar with the material in the first two sections.

SECTION 1 - USING THE MISSION PLANNER - BASICS

Select and Commit on any one of the Simulator or Training Missions with the
prefix "IDS - OCU" so that you can reach this screen (you won`t have to fly
the mission if you don`t want to). You`ll see a map in front of you, and a
number of buttons down the right-hand side. We will refer to these in
future as "Map Screen Buttons".

Many of these buttons call up sub-windows on the screen, and several of
these may be present at the same time. Every sub-window has a Title bar
with a Close Box allowing the window to be dismissed or dragged. Windows
may overlap one another, but right-clicking on any visible portion of a
window will put it "in front" of any overlapping windows. You can close
them all at once with the "Tidy" button.

In order from top to bottom, the buttons read: 

Key

Calls up the map Key, see below.

Targets

Used at Campaign level and above. Works in conjunction with the Category
Flag to highlight all potential targets of a given kind. See Campaign
section.

Point Data

Clicking on this button will bring up the Point Data Window. This gives
details about the point on the map under the mouse pointer, including the
grid coordinates, the ground height above Sea level, the nearest structure
(if any) the estimated "floor" of radar coverage at that point and the
current ownership (Allied or Enemy). The information in this window is
only updated when the mouse is stationary.

Briefing

For Simulator Missions, or single Combat Missions, the button reads
"Briefing" and calls up a window with an outline description of the
mission, identical to the description you were offered when selecting the
mission. At Campaign level it will read "Task" and at Command level it
will read "Command" and will function differently. See the appropriate
sections for details.

Flightplan

This button is used to bring up the Flightplan Window, which allows you to
review, modify, or create flightplans for your own (and potentially other)
aircraft. See below.

Payload

This button calls up the Payload Window, which is used to verify fuel and
weapons load, and to load weapons for self-defence or attacks on targets of
opportunity. See below.

Met. Report

This button calls up a weather (Met. for Meteorological) report giving
wind direction and strength plus visibility and cloud heights. In the
Simulator, some of these factors can be changed. See below.

Centre

This button zooms the map right out and centres it on the screen, so that
you can instantly call up the big picture from wherever you are.

Fit

Clicking on this button will automatically set the zoom level and scroll
the map so that the whole of the "current" flightplan is visible on the
screen at once

Tidy 

If you feel that the map is in danger of disappearing behind a solid sheet
of overlapping windows, clicking on the "Tidy" button will close all open
sub windows at once, except the Problems Window, which can only be
dismissed by fixing the problems it`s bringing to your attention. See the
second section for details of the Problems Window.

Take-off

When you`ve studied the briefing, the flightplan, the payload and the Met.
report, click on this button. Provided that there are no major flaws in
the flightplan, you will find yourself in the cockpit on the runway, after
a pause to download the flightplan to your aircraft`s navigation systems.
If the Problems Window (explained later) is active and showing an "ERROR"
message, there`s something drastically wrong with your flightplan, and you
won`t be allowed to take off until it`s fixed. This should never happen if
you are simply flying preset single missions. The fun starts when you
begin planning your own.

The Key Button

Click on this button and a "frame" of panels / buttons will appear down the
left side and across the bottom of the screen showing the map symbols and
their meaning. Like any other sub-window on this screen, it can be turned
off by clicking on the Close button in the top left corner.

The Key display is not just a passive display to help you identify map
symbols. Each of its panels showing a symbol and its identification is
also a button which controls whether or not that symbol will be drawn on
the map. Using this feature, you can avoid cluttering the display with
symbols you don`t need or want to see. To turn any symbol on or off, just
click on the appropriate panel of the Key window. This can also be used to
speed up the redrawing of the screen if your machine is running more slowly
than you like - just turn off everything you think you can do without.

When you first enter this screen the Key will be set to display just
Physical data (contours, rivers and lakes), and Cultural data (roads,
railways, power lines, structures. etc.), plus the Mission Flightplan or
Task outline. Some of the symbol options relate to more advanced features
which we will deal with later.

In order from top to bottom down the left side:

Contours

Contour lines are shown for hills at variable intervals above (flat) ground
level. Because drawing contours is a demanding task which can reduce a
slow computer to a crawl, the vertical distance between contour lines can
be set from the Preferences screen (available through Options). The lowest
contour is the 250 feet line, and this is always drawn, whatever the
interval setting.

Rivers and Lakes

Self-explanatory.

Roads

Self explanatory.

Railways

Self-explanatory.

Power Lines

Self-explanatory.

Structures
Symbol for buildings, bridges or embankments

Airfields

The runway layouts of the airfields themselves are always shown on the map,
with the active runways distinguished by colour. This button acts only to
turn the airfield name label on or off.

ILS Coverage

If your aircraft is within the ILS symbol and pointing in the general
direction of the runway, your ILS (Instrument Landing System) will be
active, and you may use it either to make an automatic approach or to guide
a manual approach.

Flightplan (Current)

When a preset mission is loaded, your flightplan will be shown. At
Campaign level and higher, this indicates the flightplan (among several)
which you are currently reviewing or altering. Where the flightplan shows
a change of course as you leave one waypoint and turn toward the next, a
curve will be drawn. How smooth a curve you see is selectable from the
Preferences Screen (accessible through "Options"), because drawing a large
number of smooth Curves can be a heavy burden on slower computers.

Flightplan (Other)

When more than one flightplan is shown on the map, the ones which you are
not currently reviewing or editing will be shown in a different colour.

Category Flag

This symbol issued by the Target Finder facility to highlight all potential
targets in a particular category, for example road bridges, control towers,
stores dumps etc. This feature is useful for the "Free Fire" Mission and
at Campaign or Command Level. If you use the "Targets" button to call up
the Target Finder this feature will be turned on automatically, and when
you close it again this switch will return to its previous state, whether
on or off. If the Category Flag is enabled in the key, the category
symbols will still be shown even if the Target Finder is dismissed.

Priority Flag

This symbol is used by the Command Target Priority facility to highlight
positions which are important targets for one reason or another. This
feature is only used at Command level. Like the Category Flag, this
feature will be turned on automatically when the Target Priority system is
in use, and restored to its previous state afterwards.

The other buttons along the bottom edge of the strip, are "split" buttons.
Each is divided into three areas. These comprise the allied and enemy
versions of the same symbol and the area below containing the legend text.
Enemy symbols will normally appear in orange and allied in blue (check with
the Technical Supplement for your machine if they don`t). Clicking on the
symbol areas has just the effect you would expect - display of the allied
or enemy symbols is turned on or off individually. Clicking below in the
text area, however, INVERTS the selection state of both allied and enemy
symbols at once - it gives you the exact opposite of what you have at the
moment. In other words, if both allied and enemy symbols are off, clicking
below will turn both on, clicking again will turn both off, but if, say,
allied are on and enemy are off, clicking below will turn allied off and
enemy on. From left to right the buttons are:

AA Threat

Areas known to be covered by AAA or SAMs are shown like this. The area
shown illustrates the maximum effective range of the system deployed, and
does not take account of terrain masking or range variation with altitude.
Positions are not guaranteed to be precisely accurate.

EWR Coverage
 
Shows areas within theoretical range of Early Warning Radar stations.
Does not take account of terrain masking - but you can get this information
from the Flightplan Profile Window (see below), or from the Point Data
Window.

CAP Area

Indicates a fighter CAP (Combat Air Patrol) area. Enemy positions are
estimated, allied positions should be exact. This should give you some
idea of where you might expect to find help or opposition.

AWACS Track

Shows the exact (allied) or estimated (enemy) "racetrack" which an AWACS
aircraft flies when on station. Note that the enemy AWACS flies a figure
of eight rather than a plain oval. AWACS is not always available to either
side but when it is, interceptors will function more efficiently to defend
the side(s) possessing it. The AWACS aircraft itself is a very high value
target.

Ground Forces

Standard military symbology for an armoured unit. This is placed at known
locations of major ground force formations. On the battlefield, in close
reserve or en route to the battle area. Unless you actually plan to attack
them, stay away from these forces - they're usually heavily defended.

Moving and Zooming the Map

Moving around the map and zooming in or out are done with the mouse, using
the RIGHT button. To move a point on the map to the centre of the screen,
just point and click (right) on it. The map will be redrawn with the
selected point in the centre of the screen. To zoom in or out, click
(right) and hold down. A small strip of boxes corresponding to the
zoom-levels available will appear under the mouse-pointer, with the pointer
on the current zoom level. This works very much like the Options...
button. Keep holding the mouse button down! You may go straight to any
other zoom level you like by simply moving the mouse pointer over the
appropriate box in the strip and releasing the (right) mouse button.

All About Waypoints

The flightplan for the mission you loaded has already been created for you,
and should be visible on the map when zoomed out. If it isn`t, you must
have turned it off from the Key window - so turn it back on (using the
panel marked "Current Flightplan"). If you`ve worked through the Advanced
Flying Training chapter then you`ve seen something like this on the
navigator`s PLN display. It`s a series of lines connecting labelled
symbols in the shape of boxes, circles and triangles, and will usually loop
back to a place near its starting point.

A flightplan is composed of Waypoints and Legs. Waypoints are fixed
points, represented by the symbols between the line sections, and a Leg is
simply the path between one Waypoint and the next. Legs usually start with
a curve and terminate at the next Waypoint as straight lines. Waypoints
come in several flavours:

Take-off Point

The Take off Point" which is always Waypoint A, is obviously at the
airfield from which you take off.

Turning Points

Turning Points are simply places where you change course - these are by far
the most common type. They are labelled with capital letters following on
from A, and the planned flight passes through them in alphabetical order.

Initial Points

Initial Points are the Turning Points from which you start the attack run
on a ground target. They are labelled in the same sequence as other
Turning Points.

Targets

Targets are labelled with the letters X, Y and theoretically Z, for the
first, second and (most unlikely) third planned targets of a mission.

CAP Start

This is used to set up a Combat Air Patrol station for ADV missions. The
relative positions of this point and the next waypoint (the CAP End point)
define an oval racetrack, for your aircraft to patrol while waiting to
intercept incoming enemy aircraft.

CAP End

See CAP Start, above. ADV flightplans only.

Approach Point

The Approach Point should be placed at the end of one ILS beam of the
airfield at which you intend to land - you can make the ILS beam coverage
visible on the map using the Key. It is labelled in the same sequence as
the Turning Points.

A Waypoint must obviously have a position on the map, and be one of the
types listed above. But it will also have a lot of other data (call them
attributes) associated with it. Here is a list of all the possible
attributes:

Label

All waypoints have labels. This will be a single letter of the alphabet
starting with A (for the Take-off Point) and continuing in order through
the alphabet, except for Target waypoints, which will be labelled X, Y and
Z in sequence.

Type

This will show one of:

Take-off
Turning Point
Initial Point for     (Target Label)     (IDS flightplans only)
Target                                   (IDS flightplans only)
CAP Start                                (ADV flightplans only)
CAP End                                  (ADV flightplans only)
Approach Point for (Airfield Name)

Position

Coordinates are displayed in the title bar of a waypoint window.

Head/Tail Wind

Only Take-off and Approach Points have this attribute. It gives the
strength in knots of the component of the wind which is blowing from ahead
(Head wind) or from behind (Tail wind) as you take off or land: if you`ve
got a Tail wind component you`re taking off or landing in the wrong
direction. This should not happen with preset missions unless you insist
on editing the flightplan. If you want to do this - read section 2 of this
chapter.

Cross-wind

Only for Take off and Approach Points. This is the strength in knots of
the component of the wind which is blowing across the runway as you take
off or land. A strong crosswind can make an approach and landing quite
difficult.

Time

All waypoints show a Time and Time Status. For a Take-off point, this is
the take-off time. For all other waypoints it is the time at which you
expect, or plan to pass or attack this point. The Status will show "Free"
"Fixed" or "Bound"

Refer to the second section of this chapter for the meaning of these terms,
how to set the Time value, and a stern lecture on the knots you can tie
yourself into by using this feature without understanding it.

Altitude

Every Waypoint type except Take-off Points will also have an altitude /
ride height, and an AFDS Altitude Authority attribute. If the Altitude
Authority is set at "Altitude Hold" the AFDS system will fly the leg to
this waypoint at the given BAROMETRIC altitude, i.e. height above sea
level. If the Altitude Authority setting is "Ride Height" the AFDS system
will fly the leg Terrain Following at the Ride Height given, i.e clearance
above the ground beneath the aircraft. Refer to the next section of this
chapter for the method of setting heights.

Speed

All waypoint types except Take-off show a Speed and Speed Status. This is
the average speed at which it is necessary to fly the leg approaching this
waypoint in order to arrive at the Time shown. You may choose to have this
speed displayed as IAS (Indicated Air Speed), or Mach Number. The speed at
a Waypoint will also determine the radius of the turn at the start of the
Leg to the next Waypoint. The Speed Status may be "Free" "Fixed" or
"Bound" Refer to the second section of this chapter for the meaning of
these terms and the method of setting speed. Like Time setting, this is a
feature which must be used carefully.

Target

Target waypoints only. Shown on the waypoint window Title bar next to the
map coordinates. Describes the target, e.g. road bridge, HAS, runway etc.

Package data:     Weapon
                  Delivery
                  Salvo
                  Minimum recommended delivery height

Target waypoints only. These parameters specify the Package of weapons to
be used in attacking this target, and how the Package is to be delivered.
Your aircraft`s load of ground attack weapons is divided into groups called
Packages intended for particular targets. Weapon Packages and weapons in
general are covered in detail in the Weapons Conversion chapter. Salvo
size (number of weapons in the package) and Minimum Safe Delivery Height
(eg. 1000ft or above) are shown. Refer to the second section of this
chapter to find out how to change these settings.

All the waypoint types and their attributes are listed in the table below


        Position Altitude Time IAS/Mach Target Package Headwind Crosswind

Reading the Flightplan and Waypoint Data

Clicking on the Map Screen button marked "Flightplan" brings up the
Flightplan Window. This window breaks down into three horizontal strips.
The top strip (the Tool Strip) contains buttons to call up subwindows
showing individual waypoint data, a Summary or a Profile (side view) of the
flightplan, or to split and reformate waypoints when planning for multi
aircraft missions. The middle strip (the Waypoint Strip) shows a button
corresponding to the label (A,B,....X... F,G etc) of each waypoint in the
flightplan, allowing you to select one at a time and at the lower left end
buttons appear for inserting and deleting waypoints when appropriate. The
lowest strip, the Aircraft Strip, shows the mission number in the daily
sequence, plus individual buttons for all the aircraft in the formation.
Like the waypoints, the aircraft are distinguished by letters A, B, C, etc.
If this seems confusing, don`t blame us, it`s standard RAF practice.
Aircraft callsigns are determined simply by the mission number (starting
again from 1 every day) and the phonetic alphabet equivalent of the
aircraft`s letter within the formation, e g 003Alpha, 003Bravo etc. The
Formation Leader (you) is always aircraft A, which will be the only letter
shown if this is a mission for a single aircraft.

While this window is on-screen, clicking on the map with the LEFT mouse
button has the effect of placing a new waypoint at the mouse position, so
be careful. If you do accidentally create a new waypoint, just click ONCE
on the "Delete" button in the bottom row of the Flightplan window before
you do anything else.

Select a zoom level of 2x or 3x and if it`s not already highlighted, click
once on the Waypoint Strip button labelled A. This will select waypoint A,
highlight the button, and if the waypoint is off-screen the map will
automatically be re-centred and re-drawn to show it. You can also select
any waypoint and highlight its Waypoint Strip button by left clicking
inside the waypoint symbol on the map.

Now click once on the Waypoint button in the Tool Strip. An additional
window. the Waypoint Window, will appear, giving detailed data for the
selected waypoint, showing all the attributes appropriate for its type.
You can also call up this window by double-clicking (clicking twice in
quick succession) on the Waypoint Strip button or the map symbol. Since
this is a Take-off Point, the Time given will be your planned take-off
time. If you select Waypoint B, then C and so on, the Waypoint window will
remain on screen, displaying data for each of the waypoints in turn. This
way you can step through the entire flightplan quickly and easily,
reviewing the data for each waypoint and seeing it on the map, at any zoom
level you wish to select. You can dismiss or drag the Flightplan window or
the Waypoint window using the close box and the title bar, but remember
that you can`t create or drag waypoints unless the Flightplan Window is
open. If you close the Flightplan Window, the Waypoint Window will
automatically close as well.

Flightplan Summary Window

If you click on the "Summary" button in the Flightplan window, you will be
presented with a sub-window which summarises the whole flightplan in terms
of times and actions. This may be compared with the Briefing description.
It also shows fuel requirements, total flying time, etc.

Flightplan Profile Window

Clicking on the "Profile" button in the Flightplan Window brings up the
Profile Window - a wide shallow window showing all or part of your
flightplan straightened out and viewed from the side, with the profile of
the terrain beneath it. Any preset mission will always show a flightplan
which is above ground at all points. Areas where the flightplan takes you
underground will be shown as solid rectangles in a contrasting colour!
Above the profile is a shallow horizontal bar which changes colour to show
whether you are flying over Allied or Enemy territory at each point in the
Profile.

Along the lower edge of the window is a row of buttons like the Waypoint
Strip in the Flightplan window, one for every waypoint in the current
flightplan. The buttons for the waypoints define the section of your
flightplan which will be shown in profile - the ones shown highlighted are
currently visible in the Profile Window. A single mouse click on a button
will extend or retract the left or right end of the highlighted strip
(whichever is closer) to the selected button and waypoint. Double-clicking
on a waypoint button will bring up a profile covering three waypoints only;
the one you clicked on, and those on either side of it.

When you first call up this window or when you use the waypoint buttons to
change the section of Profile in view, the lines representing your
flightpath, the terrain below and the "ownership" of that terrain will be
drawn quite rapidly. Once these are complete, the flightplan section will
be checked against known AA Threats, and vertical hatching will be shown
wherever it intersects a threat circle. After this is done, another
(usually broken) line will appear on the Profile display, drawn more slowly
from left to right. This shows, for every point along the Profile section,
the altitude above which you will probably be visible known enemy ground
radars - so obviously your flightplan should keep you below it wherever
possible. The reason why the line appears slowly is quite simple - the
line-of-sight calculations needed to show this data take a LOT of
processing power, but they are performed as a "background task", and will
not prevent you from moving about the map, zooming in or out, dragging
windows or performing any other function, though if you change the
flightplan by placing dragging or deleting waypoints the profile will need
to redraw from scratch.

We would suggest that before flying any mission you step through all the
waypoints in the flightplan, familiarising yourself with the route, the
speeds, the targets and the attack modes at least. Another very good idea
is to use the Key to turn on the AA Threat and EWR overlays before you do
this. Though it may slow your display down, it will ensure that you`re
aware of where the hazards are, where you can afford to swing wide of your
planned track, and where you absolutely must stick to it to avoid the
enemy`s defences.

If you feel the urge to customise your flightplan we suggest that you first
read Section 2 of this chapter, "Planning your own Missions". That section
is intended to prepare you for Campaign play, but there is nothing to
prevent you from revising preset Mission flightplans, or planning a "Free
Fire" mission for yourself. Just remember that the success of the preset
Missions will be judged solely by the effectiveness of your attack on the
briefed target - so make sure that you attack it.

Mission Rehearsal using Explore Mode

Another advanced facility which may be of considerable use in preparing for
the mission is the "Explore Mode" which is available in the usual way via
the Options../Exit box. Using this, you can enter a detailed simulation of
the Flying Area and move freely about in it, to familiarise yourself with
targets and the surrounding terrain, or any other part of the route. See
chapter 2 and the separate Control Summary for details of how to use
Explore Mode.

If you wish to explore a particular area, just right-click on that point to
centre it on the Mission Planner map before entering Explore Mode. You
will find yourself on that spot. Conversely, when you exit Explore Mode
and return to the Mission Planner, the map will be centred on your last
position in Explore Mode, so cross referencing between map and simulation
is easy and convenient.

Met. Report

Before taking off, click on the Map Screen Button marked "Met. Report".
This will open a window to give you a meteorological report, telling you
about wind strength / direction and visibility conditions. For Simulator
missions, some of these weather characteristics can be changed.

Wind

Shows bearing in degrees (the direction the wind is blowing FROM). This
can never be changed. Wind Speed is given in knots. For Simulator
missions you can select any one of a range of windspeeds by clicking
repeated on the Cycle button beside the text. Outside the Simulator, the
Cycle button will not appear, and the wind strength is not optional.

Visibility

Four visibility conditions are possible; Light Cloud Only, Overcast, Fog
and Thick Fog. Overcast is a thick continuous layer of cloud. When there
is Fog there will always be an overcast as well. In the Simulator you can
select any of these four conditions by using the Cycle button beside the
text. Cloud Base and Tops figures are also shown in feet, and these cannot
be changed.

Effects of Weather on the Mission

Wind

This will mainly affect the length of your take-off and landing run, and
the difficulty of your approach. We've already discussed these problems in
the Advanced Flying Training chapter.

The wind will rarely be so obliging as to blow directly along the runway
available, so the idea is to take off and land in a direction which gives
you a head-wind component rather than a tail-wind component. If you call
up the Waypoint window for the Take-off or Approach Waypoints, you will see
that the data for these waypoint types includes Head (or Tail) wind and
Cross wind speeds. Any sensible arrangement of waypoint B (which governs
take off direction) and the Approach Point (which determines landing
direction) will show a Head-wind rather than a Tail-wind. The strength of
the Cross wind component will largely determine the difficulty of the
landing. Preset missions will always set up take-off and landing
directions to take account of these factors, but be careful if you start
modifying the flightplan.

Cloud

Obviously you can`t see through thick cloud, but neither can an infra red
sensor or most lasers. This may degrade or utterly destroy the performance
of heat-seeking missiles, but it will also defeat your TIALD (Thermal
imaging and Laser Designator) cameras. Since laser guided bomb attacks can
only be made using TIALD to designate the target. TIALD must be able to
see the target if the attack is to succeed. Because you need to fly at
about 23000` to give TIALD a wide enough field of view to track a target
throughout an attack, this just can`t be done if there`s an overcast layer.

Finally, the Stores Loading Check

When you are satisfied that you understand the briefing, the flightplan,
and any other relevant data, the last thing you must do is to verify that
the aircraft is loaded with the correct weapons for the planned targets,
add any defensive weapons desired (limited by weight and availability), and
decide how much extra fuel you wish to carry. If a margin is available, or
your targets cannot be planned, you can use the Payload Window to load
weapons for attacks on targets of opportunity.

The Payload Window

The Payload window can be called up at any time by clicking on the Map
Screen Button marked "Payload". This displays in diagrammatic form all
possible external Stores and the aircraft hardpoints which can carry them,
plus an indication of the fuel load, the total aircraft weight and the
weight margin available. The ammunition tanks for your internal cannon
will always be full at take-off, holding 180 rounds per gun.

For IDS aircraft, four buttons on this window allow you to view and
manipulate any one of the three possible weapon Packages, or the remaining
(non-ground attack) stores. The buttons for weapon packages loaded for
planned attacks will show X, Y, or Z. The contents of these packages
cannot be changed except by changing the mission plan. If a package is
empty or loaded for targets of-opportunity, the button will show a dash
("-"). The other button displays external stores which are not part of any
weapon Package, like drop tanks, AIM9Ls and defensive pods and allows you
to load or unload them.

ADV aircraft do not carry ground attack weapons, but can carry Sky Flash
which the IDS cannot, so the Payload screen for an ADV mission will show
far fewer options, and there is no need to distinguish between packages.

Stores (weapons or other external loads) are listed down the left-hand side
of the Payload window, with a line running horizontally to the right from
each beneath the aircraft diagram. At the right-hand end of the line is a
panel showing the number left in stock at your airfield.

Vertical lines descend from the aircraft diagram at the top of the window
representing the hardpoints to which stores can be attached. Where the
vertical line from a hardpoint meets the horizontal line from a store, a
symbol or a group of symbols may be shown, which we explain below. If no
symbol is shown where the lines meet, then it means that the store is not
compatible with the hardpoint. Each symbol means that one store can be
fitted at this location. Where more than one symbol is shown at a
junction, this means that either there is more than one hardpoint there and
/ or a carrier can be fitted to attach more than one store. Both of these
cases apply to the left and right belly hardpoints, where up to four of
many stores can be fitted there are two hardpoints and each can be fitted
with a double carrier.

Store/Hardpoint Symbology

Symbol              Meaning

Store symbol        A store in the current package (selected by clicking on a
                    Package button) is fitted at this point.

Greyed symbol       A store in a different package (not the currently selected
                    one) is fitted at this point.

Raised button       This point is available for this store within the current
                    package

Flush button        This point is available for this store, but not
                    within the current package. This is either
                    because the type of store is inappropriate
                    (e.g. drop tank in a ground attack package)
                    or because it would violate the rule that each
                    ground attack package must contain only one
                    type of store.

Sunken button       It would be possible of it this store to this point.
                    but only if you unload something else.

If a target-of-opportunity package (or the "Other" package) is selected,
stores may be loaded or unloaded by placing the mouse pointer on a Raised
Button or a Store symbol and clicking with the left button. None of the
other symbols will respond if you click on them.

Two other buttons appear at the upper right of this window, under the
Package selection buttons. These are marked "Standard" and "Clear
Package". Clicking on the "Standard" button will set up a load that
consists of weapon packages for planned targets, plus drop tanks as
appropriate. The defensive pods and 2 AIM9L. All other stores will be
removed. When you first call up the Payload window after loading or
creating a mission, the aircraft will be loaded exactly the way the
Standard button would do it.

The Clear Package button will only be active if the currently selected
package is NOT "X" "Y" or "Z". Clicking on this button will unload all
stores in the currently selected package, except for external tanks if
these are essential for the planned mission.

Weight and Fuel

At the upper left corner of the screen figures are shown for All-up Weight
(aircraft plus all fuel and stores), Stores Weight (excluding fuel in drop
tanks), Fuel Weight (including fuel in drop tanks), and Weight Margin,
which is the difference between All up Weight and Maximum Take-Off
Weight(MTOW). All of these weight figures are passive displays except for
Fuel Weight, which can be used to load or unload fuel.
 
Whenever a mission flightplan is loaded, created or changed, a minimum
fuel requirement is automatically calculated for the distances and speeds
specified, plus a fixed margin of 1500 kg. (3300 lbs.). This calculated
minimum fuel weight will be shown as already loaded when you first open the
Payload Window. If more fuel is required for the mission than the internal
tanks can hold, then external tanks will be shown as fitted. If the
external tanks are fitted then they will always be full, and internal fuel
will always be topped up to maximum as well.

When external tanks are NOT fitted, you can change your Internal fuel
loading by means of the Fuel Weight display. Click on the digit of the
Fuel Weight figure which you wish to change. This will cause buttons
showing arrow symbols to appear below and above the digit. Click on the
arrows to change the digit up or down. Click and hold down for rapid
change. Digits above or below will be affected as the changing digit
passes upwards through 9 or downwards through 0. To change a different
digit, just click on that digit instead and the arrow buttons will move
over. The arrow buttons can be dismissed altogether by clicking a second
time on the digit between them. Using the arrow buttons you can increase
the fuel quantity up to the maximum internal fuel figure. If you want
more, this can only be done by loading full external tanks (in the "Other"
package).

If you reduce the fuel load to below the calculated minimum requirement, a
small window called the Problems Window will automatically appear on the
screen. Many different messages can and will appear in the Problems Window
when you start to plan your own missions, but this one will say something
like ERROR: 001 A - Not enough fuel for flightplan. This means what it
says: you have too little fuel to fly the flightplan, and you won`t be
allowed to take off until you`ve either loaded more fuel or replanned the
route to reduce the fuel requirement. For more detail on the Problems
Window, see the second section of this chapter.

What to load?

The "Standard. option" will always load certain items if there are
hardpoints to take them. For the IDS these are the defensive pods (chaff
and flare dispenser on the starboard outer wing pylon, ECM pod on the port
outer), and a pair of AIM9L for self-defence, one on each inner wing pylon.
Other stores may be loaded in these places, but think hard before you leave
the defensive pods at home. If you do, you will have NO chaff or flares or
ECM! This does not apply to the Tornado ADV, because all these items are
internal on that aircraft.

The AIM9L are more genuinely optional. Without them your only air to air
weapon is the gun, but standard tactical doctrine for a Tornado IDS faced
with an interceptor can be summed up in two words: Run away! On the other
hand this means that you immediately grant the enemy a "mission kill" -
you`re still alive" but your mission is dead. The decision is up to you,
but because the weight and drag of the AIM9L are comparatively small we
would suggest that you carry them unless you definitely need the stores
points for something else, like ALARM.

If you want to load these items for yourself, remember that you must click
on the "Other" package button first.

Another discretionary form of defensive armament (though sometimes these
will be the weapons specified for your planned attack) would be ALARM anti-
radar missiles to use in Direct mode against SAM or AAA threats in your way
but these are fairly heavy, and you may not have suitable hardpoints free
to carry them. If you do decide you want to take some, first click on any
package button showing "-" to assign them to a package which is currently
used.

If there are free Packages, free stores points and a sufficient weight
margin, you may if you wish load extra ground attack weapons for unplanned
targets - Targets of Opportunity. Just click on a Package button showing
"-", and add the weapons you want. All weapons in one Package must be of
the same type The delivery mode for such a package will automatically be
set to manual delivery, or its nearest equivalent for the weapon concerned,
but it can be changed in the air using the Stores Management Display. See
the Weapons Conversion chapter and / or the Aircrew Notes section on the
Navigator`s Cockpit Layout for details of how to do this.

Keep it in mind that a heavily loaded aircraft will handle more sluggishly
and fly more slowly than an aircraft with a lighter load. An aircraft
loaded near its maximum take-off weight will need careful, smooth flying to
avoid stalling when flying at low speeds. Sometimes a maximum load is
unavoidable, but don`t make a habit of taking all of your weight margin as
extra fuel or weapons.

Starting the Mission

When you are satisfied that you have absorbed all the necessary information
and that the aircraft is suitably loaded for the mission, you can click on
the map Screen Button labelled "Take off". After a brief pause to download
the flightplan to your aircraft, you will find yourself in the cockpit, on
the runway, with immediate clearance to take off. Before you do so, be
sure you have worked through the "Taking Off" section in the Elementary
Flying Training chapter, or at the very least consulted the checklist given
in the Aircrew Notes.

Final Exercises

Now that you can read the flightplan before you take off, we suggest that
you try out the Bombing Range exercises available under the Trainig option.
Remember that this is live flying, not like the Simulator. You can`t
arrange for the aircraft to bounce off the ground, you must fly the
aircraft at actual weight, and you can`t just blow up or shoot down
anything that takes your fancy. The Debrief for the Bombing range
exercises will include a score for accuracy (see the Debrief chapter for
details).

Once you`ve done these, try the Training exercises tagged "OCU"
(Operational Conversion Unit), which simulate actual missions apart from
enemy fire, then go back to the Simulator, where another more difficult and
realistic set of OCU missions (plus air combat exercises) are available.
Switch on enemy activity and as much realism as you can handle, then try
these out against a simulated enemy, in all weathers.

We cover how to use AFDS Track mode to follow an IDS flightplan in the
advanced Flying Training chapter. For an ADV flightplan which may contain
a CAP pattern. It`s very similar. Just take off and engage Track mode.
The AFDS will fly you to the CAP Start and feed you into the pattern. If
left under AFDS control the aircraft will loop between CAP Start and CAP
End points until it runs out of fuel. You can break out of the rut by
either disengaging the AFDS or using the "Skip to next waypoint" key to
advance the selected waypoint past the CAP End point. There`s a Simulator
OCU CAP mission which lets you try this out.

When you can fly and survive the OCU missions against the worst the
simulator can throw at you, you`re good enough to take your chances in
Combat. Start with the single Mission options. You have three different
War Zones to fight over, so it`ll take you some time to exhaust all these
possibilities. Some of the missions are solo exercises, some of them
involve coordinating with other aircraft - remember that timekeeping is
just as important as accuracy. When you think that you`re getting the hang
of it and you understand the tactical problems, move on to the next section
and put your own ideas into practice.

SECTION 2 - PLANNING YOUR OWN MISSIONS

2a 'FREE FIRE' and LEVEl 1 CAMPAIGNS

This section assumes that you have read and understood all the instructions
on basic use of the Mission Planner given in the preceding section. There
are several ways to get started on planning missions for yourself. You can
try editing some of the Simulator Missions for practice, and then go on to
Combat or you can select "Mission" from the "Combat" screen, followed by
either of the Missions titled "Free Fire" from the Selection Menu. When
you arrive at the Mission Planner for a "Free Fire" mission there will be
no preset mission plan at all, and it`s up to you to select a target, a
patrol station or other obective and create a flightplan. Apart from the
need to define your own objective and flightplan, a "Free Fire" mission
works exactly like any other single mission, and is entirely
self-contained.

The Campaign option is the next step up, providing a connected series of
missions set in a military situation which evolves over time. If you
choose "Campaign" on the "Combat" screen, and one of the Level 1 Campaign
scenarios you will see a bare outline of a mission which simply specifies
an objective, rather than a complete flightplan. This outline is your Task
for the next mission, and you must do all the detailed planning, then fly
it. When (and if) you return from that mission your commander will present
you with a new Task to plan and fly. The Campaign will last for as many
missions as it takes to accomplish the Campaign objectives, or to lose the
war, or until a stalemate is reached. When you need a break, you can exit
from the Mission Planner to the Mission Selection Screen and save the
current situation to reload and continue later.

IDS missions in a campaign will have a variety of aims. They might be
directed at reducing the enemy`s air-power (Counter-Air Operations),
denying him the routes he needs to supply or move his ground forces
(Interdiction Operations)., destroying other vital enemy installations
(Attack Operations), or beating down AA threats to clear the way for
further strikes (Defence Suppression). You may also be called upon to
provide Close Air Support, attacking enemy ground forces actually on the
battlefield. This will only happen if your side is in a truly desperate
situation - and if it does, your chances of survival are not good. The
best way to avoid this is to succeed in your primary missions.
 
After each mission, the Task for the next
will reflect your degree of success so far, and its effect on the military
situation on the ground.

At this level you don`t have to decide what to hit or when The Task
specifies the time and the target, the nature of the target dictates the
choice of weapon but it is up to you to decide how to reach the target,
attack it and return with the maximum probability of success and the
minimum risk.

If you are trying out the "Free Fire" Missions, you can choose anything on
the map as your target and you can land at any airfield you like, provided
its allied, but you will always start at the same airfield. On the map
you`ll see that the Take off waypoint A is already set, marking your
position.

Read, or suffer the consequences...

This is not a threat, it`s a friendly warning. This section aims to cover
all you need to know to create flightplans, though we can only give you
general advice on tactics. Some of this material is relevant to Campaign
play, some is only relevant to "Free Fire" missions. Which ever of these
options you plan to try out, read all of this section first - once you
start creating and editing missions you have enough freedom of action to
screw up in a big way! It`s vital that you understand what you`re doing -
you`ll soon discover that you won`t be allowed to take off if your
flightplan doesn`t make sense.

Turning a Task into a Flightplan

When you select a Campaign scenario on the Mission Selection Screen,
instead of the Briefing you would expect for a single mission you will see
a summary describing the military situation at the time the Campaign
starts. The title of the Campaign scenario itself should give you some
clue as to what to expect. When you Commit and move to the Mission
Planner, two differences should be seen: a) there is a flightplan laid
out, but it`s just a skeleton, and b) the Map Screen Button which used to
say "Briefing" is now titled "Task".

Click on the Task button to see the Air Tasking Message - these are your
orders. They will describe the type of mission in terms of role (Attack,
Interdict, Counter-Air etc.), the type and callsigns of the aircraft taking
part, the position and nature of the target(s), the type of weapon to be
used and the time for the attack. Times may be specified as TOT (Time On
Target), which must be achieved in order to coordinate with other activity,
or as NLT (Not Later Than), which leaves you with some discretion.

In Level One Campaigns, you will only need to create a flightplan for
yourself, and the following paragraphs deal mainly with that situation,
deferring the problems of multi-aircraft mission planning (Level Two
Campaigns) till later.

Problems, Warnings and Errors

When you first see the skeleton flightplan of a new Task on the Mission
Planner map, you`ll often notice a small window without a close box, titled
"Problems". This appears because the Task outline as it stands is not a
viable flightplan, and the planning support systems are automatically
alerting you to the fact.

The planning systems apply a set of rules to any flight plan to detect
unreasonable situations such as unflyable course changes, impossible or
improbable timings and speeds, or Initial Points too close to the target.
When a flightplan bends or breaks these rules, the Problems window will
automatically appear with a list of messages. These messages will start
with either "ERROR" for a problem which must be fixed before you take off,
or "WARNING" when the problem is not so serious as to completely invalidate
the flightplan. You can either tackle these problems immediately or leave
them until later, but you will not be permitted to download the flightplan
and take off while any ERROR message appears in the list. Every message is
tagged with the callsign (mission number plus letter) of the aircraft to
which it applies: 003 A for example. This is done so that when you`re
planning multi aircraft missions you know which message applies to which
aircraft.

Setting and Moving Waypoints

If you are planning a "Free Fire" mission there will be only one waypoint
on the map when you enter the Mission Planner - the Takeoff Point, where
you and your aircraft are based. You will have to lay down all the other
waypoints for the mission yourself. If you are starting a Campaign, an IDS
Task outline will usually preset Target Waypoint(s), and an ADV Task will
usually preset a CAP point, depending on the nature of the mission, plus an
Approach Point. You will generally create your flightplan by inserting
extra waypoints between the ones you are given, and then dragging them into
position. Both operations are quite straightforward, and complications
only arise when you place waypoints too close together, so for your initial
experiments it is best if you keep waypoints spaced well apart.

In order to start placing or moving waypoints you must first click on the
Map Screen Button labelled "Flightplan" thus opening the Flightplan Window.
Remember that a flightplan may have up to 15 waypoints, but no more. When
the limit is reached, the system will refuse to create any more.

Placing Waypoints

Clicking anywhere on the map with the LEFT mouse button will place a new
waypoint at that point, adding it to the end of your current flightplan.
The new waypoint will be a Turning Point by default unless it is placed in
the ILS coverage of an allied airfield, in which case it will be created as
an Approach Point.

Dragging Waypoints

Place the mouse pointer crosshair on the symbol of the waypoint you wish to
move and hold down the LEFT mouse button. While you hold the button down
you may drag the waypoint about the map by moving the mouse. "Rubber
Lines" will be drawn to show the new legs to and from the waypoint
affected. When you release the mouse button the waypoint is "dropped" in
its new position, and the legs to and from will be redrawn, together with
the curve of the turn following the waypoint. Depending on how far you
moved the waypoint, other legs and curves may also be affected. The
smoothness or otherwise of the curve drawn can be adjusted on the
Preferences screen.

Note that dragging a waypoint also selects it (see below). Dragging a
waypoint from place to place will not change its Type unless it enters or
leaves the ILS coverage of an Allied airfield. A Turning Point dragged
into ILS coverage can become an Approach Point, and an Approach Point
dragged out of ILS coverage reverts to a plain Turning Point.

Selecting waypoints

A waypoint must be selected before certain operations can be performed upon
it. The letter of the selected waypoint is highlighted in the Flightplan
Window. Waypoints may be selected either by clicking on the appropriate
letter in the Flightplan Window, or by clicking inside the appropriate
waypoint symbol on the map.

Deleting Waypoints

The Delete button is not shown in the Waypoint Strip of the Flightplan
Window unless it`s permissible to delete the selected waypoint. Clicking
on this button deletes the selected waypoint, as you`d expect, and causes
waypoints later in the flightplan to be relabelled as necessary. Earlier
and later curves and legs may be affected by the deletion. Waypoint A can
never be deleted. When working with a flightplan for multiple aircraft,
only formation waypoints may be deleted.

Inserting Waypoints

The Insert button is not shown in the Waypoint Strip of the Flightplan
Window unless it`s possible to insert a new waypoint BEFORE the currently
selected one. New waypoints are inserted halfway between existing ones,
and must be dragged to their desired positions. Waypoints after the
insertion point will be relabelled as necessary. Waypoints cannot be
inserted if all 15 available waypoints are already used. When working with
a flightplan for multiple aircraft, insertions can only be made in legs
common to all aircraft in the formation.

Turning Circles

As you should already know, the planning system plots a curve after each
waypoint, leading into the straight leg towards the next. The radius of
the curve is governed by the Speed set for the adjacent waypoint and the
control authority of the AFDS system: the faster the speed, the wider the
turn.

When you are dragging waypoints about, the legs to and from the waypoint
are drawn as "rubber lines" but the curve is not drawn (this is to Speed up
the screen redraw). However, the turning circle calculations are still
performed and the lengths and directions of the legs are accurate. Because
the direction INTO the next waypoint is changed, the curve out of that
waypoint will change also, affecting the direction into the next, and so
on. The effects will ripple on through the flightplan for a greater or
lesser distance depending on how large a change you made, but you will not
see the ripple effect until you drop the waypoint in place and the legs
affected are redrawn.

For this reason, if you wish to control the precise direction of more than
one leg in a flightplan (e.g. for a JP.233 attack run or an approach for
landing) it is best to lay out all the waypoints first, then precisely
place the Target Waypoint(s), select weapon(s) and delivery mode(s), set
any fixed Speeds (and/or times) and only then to work through the
flightplan in order from start to finish dragging waypoints to set
direction, so that changes rippling forward affect only the legs which you
have not yet adJusted.

Two kinds of problem can arise when you place two waypoints too close
together. The first of these problems can affect any pair of waypoints,
and happens when the second waypoint is INSIDE the diameter of the turning
circle curve from the first. Diagram 5.7 shows that this means it is quite
impossible for the aircraft ever to reach the second waypoint by turning
towards it - instead it will circle until you use the Next Waypoint key to
skip the offending waypoint. Not only will this type of error be flagged
in the Problems Window (e.g. "WARNING: OO1A - C too close to B.), but the
curve will not be drawn and the preceding and following legs will meet at
the waypoint as straight lines.

The second type of problem affects only Initial Points and Targets. The
planning system calculates how far back from the target the weapon will be
released, and demands that you must have time to line up on a straight
attack run before you reach the release point (or the pull-up point for a
Loft attack). This type of problem will be flagged in the Problems Window
(eb. "WARNING. 002A - IP too close to X").

Target Waypoints and Attacks

We`ve now covered the procedure for placing Turning (or Approach)
waypoints, but position is only one of the attributes of a waypoint. Many
of the other attributes (Time, Speed, Altitude etc.) can also be adjusted
as necessary, and the Target Waypoint is the type which most often requires
tinkering of this sort, as well as the setting up of the weapons Package
for the attack.

Because it`s the most critical type of waypoint, we`ll cover its set-up in
detail, though you won`t need to perform this entire operation from scratch
unless you are planning a "Free Fire" mission or playing at Command level.

Creating and Placing a Target Waypoint (IDS only).

The accurate placement of a Target Waypoint is obviously critical. The
first problem is to identify the target on the map. Assuming that you know
what type of target you want to hit and roughly where it is, centre the map
on the approximate position and place a standard Turning Point waypoint
there. There are two ways of doing this: one is to call up the Point Data
Window and explore with the mouse pointer, the other is to use the Target
Finder, which can also be useful for choosing targets in the first place.

Click on the Map Screen Button labelled Targets, which calls up a window
showing two lists. Click on an item in the left list to select a category
of target (Military, Transport etc.). The right list will change to
display a list of individual types of target in the selected category (e.g.
Hangar, Hardened Munitions Store etc.). Click on the type which describes
your target. Every target of that type on the map will now be marked by
the Category Flag symbol, helping you pick out your intended target from
other buildings in the same area. Category Flag symbols will be shown on
the map while the Target Finder window is open regardless of whether or not
Category Flags are turned on in the Key. When you close the Target Finder
window, the Category Flag symbols will disappear unless they are enabled by
the Key.

Drag your intended Target waypoint (still a Turning Point at this stage) to
the target and drop it there. Now call up the Waypoint Window if it isn`t
already open. At the left end of the line displaying the waypoint. Type
is a button showing a small circular symbol. This is a Cycle button, used
to cycle through a range of alternative options. As you can see, there are
many other buttons of this type in a Waypoint Window.

Click once on the Type Cycle button. The waypoint Type changes from
Turning Point to Target, the label changes to X, Y or Z, the Waypoint
Window expands and acquires the extra displays necessary to define the
weapon Package, and the waypoint symbol on the map changes shape and
"snaps" to the intended target. Whenever you change a Turning Point into a
Target waypoint, the waypoint will snap to the exact position of the
nearest object. If Category Flag display is enabled, it will snap to the
nearest flagged object. The "snapping" feature can be disabled by holding
down the Alt key while dragging the Target Waypoint The Turning Point
before the Target will automatically change to an Initial Point.

The planning systems will also select a default weapon Package based on the
type of Target, but if you like you may change this. To select a Weapon
type just click on the desired button in the Weapon display. If the weapon
type has more than one possible delivery mode you may choose from the
available options by clicking repeatedly on the Cycle button at the left of
the Delivery display. At the right of the Delivery display is the Safety
Height Button; clicking on this sets the waypoint Altitude to the minimum
safe height. Below this is the Salvo Size display, showing how many
weapons there are in the Package. The Cycle button beside it can be used
to select a size of 1, 2 or 4 weapons, depending on the type. The button
to the right shows the recommended salvo size for the recommended weapon,
and clicking on this will set that figure.

Setting up a CAP Station (ADV only)

The "typical" ADV Combat Air Patrol mission involves taking off, flying to
a given position and altitude, and then flying round and round in a
"racetrack" pattern waiting to intercept enemy aircraft. In order to set
up a CAP mission, create a skeleton flightplan (if it`s not provided) and
place a Turning point roughly where you want each end of your racetrack
pattern to be. Space them fairly well apart to start with. Now select the
first of these two waypoints and call up the Waypoint Window. Click on the
Cycle button for the waypoint Type, and it will change to "CAP start".
This will automatically convert the next Turning Point into a "CAP End" and
you should see the leg between the two change into a circuit with rounded
ends - your CAP pattern.

Normal practice would be to line the racetrack up so that the long axis
points in the general direction of the enemy. This means that on one of
the two "straights" you`re pointing your radar (set for maximum range) in
the direction from which you expect business, on the other you`re mainly
watching your Radar Warning Receiver, and at the ends you sweep the
airspace on either side of the pattern.

Once a CAP pattern is set in a flightplan you will not be allowed to change
the types of any other waypoints, though you can still insert, delete or
drag points as usual. You can still go back to the CAP Start point and
change it back to a "Turning Point" though. This will also change the End
point and give each Turning Point an active Type Cycle button again. Times
of waypoints after a CAP pattern are obviously fairly meaningless you don`t
know how long you`ll be waiting there.

Altitude

For normal air-to ground operations the Altitude Authority Mode shows "Ride
Height" and the value set is 200 (feet), so that if the aircraft is under
AFDS Track mode control it will fly these legs terrain-following at 200
feet. We have just mentioned the button which copies the minimum Safe
Height for the selected weapon type into the Altitude fire but in fact you
can set up any feasible combination of Authority Mode and value. Clicking
on the Cycle button at the left of the display changes the mode from "Ride
Height" to "Altitude Hold" or vice versa. When changing from "Altitude
Hold" to "Ride Height" the altitude figure will "snap" to the nearest valid
setting which is available for terrain following (200, 300, 400, 500, 750,
1000 or 1500 feet).

If you have selected "Ride Height" and you want to change the actual height
value, click on the button showing the value itself. This will call up two
buttons showing arrows, one above and one below the figure. Clicking on
the upper arrow button will change the height figure to the next valid ride
height UP (if any), and clicking on the lower arrow button will change to
the next valid height DOWN. Clicking on either button and holding the
mouse button down will cause the figure to change rapidly. Clicking again
on the figure itself will dismiss the arrow buttons.

If you select "Altitude Hold" as the "Altitude Authority Mode" each digit
of the altitude figure will appear as a separate button. Clicking on any
of these will call up arrow buttons to change one digit at a time up or
down. Note that a "carry" will affect the next digit to the left or right
as you change any one digit up past 9 or down past 0. If you`re planning
legs set for Altitude Hold, don`t forget to check the Flightplan Profile
Window to make sure that you`re not proposing to fly through hills.

The planning system will check your altitude on the Attack run against the
minimum Safe Height for weapon release, and issue a WARNING if its set too
low. If you`re going to fly the attack run manually you can ignore the
warning and run in as low as you like provided that you`re at a safe height
(for horizontal distance) by the time your bombs explode.

Times and Speeds

If you`ve been trying out these procedures as you go, you may have noticed
that when you change a waypoint`s Type from Turning Point to Target, the
Speed setting for the Target Waypoint changes to a higher figure, depending
upon the weapon type selected.
 
The system uses two default values for speed, 420 knots as a standard
cruise, and 550 knots as a standard speed for attack runs; and it will
normally calculate waypoint times using these values. If you wish,
however, you may set any feasible speed value you want for any leg, and if
you do the Speed status will change from "Free" to "Fixed". "Fixed" status
means that the planning systems will juggle other times and speeds which
have "Free" status as much as necessary in order to ensure that you can fly
your attack run at this speed and still maintain your timetable.

If a Time On Target (TOT) is specified in the Tasking Message, it would be
normal for the time at the Target waypoint to be set as "Fixed" too.
Regardless of what the Tasking Message specifies this should be mandatory
if more than one aircraft is involved "In the operation" though each
aircraft`s TOT may be different by a few seconds, Times and Speeds are
closely bound together, so it makes sense to deal with both at once.

Time and Speed status can be changed using the Cycle buttons at the left of
their respective display lines, but it would be more common to change the
actual Time or Speed value first, which will automatically change a "Free"
status to "Fixed".

Changing the Speed value is done just like changing the Altitude value, by
clicking on a digit and then using the arrow buttons. Use the Cycle button
to the left of the value to change the speed representation between Knots,
IAS and Mach Number, whichever is more convenient. The Time value is
changed in a similar way, except that here there are buttons for hours,
minutes and seconds rather than for the individual digits.

Time and Speed Problems

A waypoint`s Time is the planned time of arrival (and / or departure) at
that waypoint. The Speed is the average speed over the preceding leg of
the flightplan which will get you there at that time. Speed at a waypoint
is also used to calculate the radius of the turn on to the next leg, so
you`d better wait till you`re on the straight run to the next waypoint
before you accelerate or decelerate

Calculating the Times and Speeds by hand and making them fit together would
be very tedious, time-consuming and error-prone, so the planning systems
will automatically recalculate and check all Times and Speeds every time a
waypoint is created, moved or deleted. The system is very capable, it
saves you a great deal of work, and it won`t create impossible timetables
unless you flatly order it to - and even then it will use the Problems
Window to inform you that you are asking for the impossible or the
unlikely.

We`ve tried to make this system as intelligent and easy to use as possible,
but the laws of physics impose a number of irksome restrictions, given that
we`re simulating a Tornado rather than a Time Machine. It`s easy to be
carried away by the possibilities of the scheduling system - and if you
are, you run the risk of ending up in a straitjacket, one way or another.
You need an appreciation of what`s possible and what isn`t.

Let`s assume that we have a target (X) ten nautical miles away from its
Initial Point (call it D). The Time at X is 12:00:00 Fixed Speed is 600
Knots Fixed (see diagram 5.9). If you were to look at the Waypoint data
for D, you`d find the Time at D showing as 11:59:00 Bound, and you would be
unable to change status or value directly, though the Time would change if
you dragged D to a different position. Whats going on?

The Speed of 600 knots for the leg D X dictates exactly how long it should
take to fly the distance from D to X: at 600 knots you`ll cover the 10
nautical miles from D to X in 1 minute. That means that you MUST pass D at
11:59:00 - no other answer is possible unless you start allowing for
variable speeds over the leg. That would open up a can of worms which we
would prefer to keep firmly shut. That`s why the Time status at D is
"Bound".

There is another variant of the same problem. If you Fix the Times of two
adjacent waypoints, the Speed for the leg between them (the one given for
the second waypoint) becomes Bound; it is dictated absolutely by the Times
and the distance between the waypoints.

The best way to avoid creating problems for yourself is to Fix Times and
Speeds only when necessary and most of the time it`s not necessary, under
normal circumstances the only Time in a mission which needs to be fixed is
the Time-On-Target, and the only legs where Speed need be fixed are legs
where you have no choice but to cross defended zones.

Tactics for Mission Planning

We`ve now covered the mechanics of manipulating waypoints in the Mission
Planner, but the really important question is; what to do with them? What
you should be trying to achieve is the most effective attack possible with
the minimum risk. It`s time to look at tactics.

Assuming that you know what your target is, you can either accept the
weapons package which is given in the Tasking Order or selected
automatically by the planning systems, or you can use your own judgement to
find some alternative type of attack which will increase your accuracy or
decrease your risk or ideally both. To make this sort of judgement for
yourself you`ll need to be familiar with all the weapons, their
capabilities, their delivery modes and the sort of accuracy achievable with
each. The best and safest way to acquire a feel for the subject is to
practise intensively in the Simulator.

Assessing the risks, however, really requires practical live experience of
trying to penetrate enemy territory, defend yourself and deliver attacks
under fire. You`ll have to acquire this experience for yourself, but we`ll
try to give you some idea of the questions you should be asking yourself:

Choosing the Axis of Attack

The direction in which you make your attack may largely determine its
success, for several reasons. Your direction of approach should to strike
the best possible compromise between three demands which frequently
conflict with one another:

1: The ideal Attack Run on a defended target is the one which overflies no
AA threats and uses the terrain to mask you from the target defences until
the last possible moment.

2: In any unguided bomb or dispenser attack, the salvo or the submunitions
have the greatest probability of landing in an area or "footprint" which is
relatively long in your direction of flight and relatively narrow from side
to side (see diagram 5.11). The ideal Attack Run will exploit this effect
to maximise the chance of destroying something worthwhile. The simplest
example of this is a JP233 attack on a runway. If your Attack Run takes
you over the runway along its length, or (even better) at a small angle to
it, almost all of the submunitions will fall on the runway, making the
maximum number of holes in it. If you make your attack at right angles
across the runway, a much smaller proportion of the submunitions will fall
on the runway itself, and most will be wasted. Military installations,
especially airfields, are frequently laid out in such a way as to avoid
concentrating too many targets in a straight line, but it will almost
always be possible to identify good and bad directions for an attack.

3: The ideal Egress Run from a target is the one offering the fastest way
back into cover, leading to the quickest safe exit from enemy territory.

Routing to and from the target area

Having set up the Target Waypoint and the waypoints immediately before and
after it, the next thing to do is to construct the rest of your route from
take off to Initial Point, and then back to the airfield at which you
intend to land. Creating the waypoints to do this is easy using the Insert
button, and you can drag the resulting waypoints about the map at will.
The problem is deciding where to put them. Here are some of the factors
which should affect your decisions:

AA Threats: Many if not all of the enemy`s AAA and SAM sites will be
known, and also the effective ranges of the weapons there. It`s obviously
not a good idea to fly within range of these if you can avoid it. You can
use the Key to command the display of the relevant threat circles, showing
the areas to avoid. If at all possible you should also avoid any area
where there is large scale ground fighting in progress, or indeed any area
where enemy ground forces are thought to be present in large numbers.

Remember that unless your intelligence is perfect, you don`t know the
position of every last threat, and the positions of the ones you do know
about can`t usually be given with absolute precision the threats are
mobile, and its in the enemy`s interests to move them about from time to
time. Be wary of narrow gaps between threat circles - the gap may not
exist in real life. When trying to assess where unknown defences are most
likely to be placed, ask yourself where the potential targets are. If it`s
obviously worth your while to attack it, it should be equally obvious to
the enemy that he needs to defend it.

Radars. The positions of the enemy Early Warning Radar stations are known
together with their coverage. You can use the Key to show the estimated
coverage. An estimated floor, of radar coverage - the height below which
you must fly to avoid detection by ground radars - is also available in the
Profile window for your route, or the Point Data window for any point on
the map, but this is only an approximate value. If you want to postpone
detection and the resulting interception by enemy fighters for as long as
possible, you should a) stay as low as reasonably possible, and b)stay in
hilly areas as much as possible, to obtain the best masking effect. The
Profile window is especially useful in minimising your chances of
detection. If the enemy has an AWACS aircraft on station, you must assume
that he can see you almost anywhere.

Fighters. If the enemy can track you, he will dispatch fighters to
intercept if he can - or you might simply cross the path of a standing
fighter patrol. You can use the Key to show likely enemy CAP (Combat Air
Patrol) stations, where Fighters circle ready to be directed to intercept
intruders like yourself. If this data is reasonably reliable, it will give
you a feeling for the likely speed of the enemy`s response if and when he
detects you. More rarely, fighters might be scrambled from readiness on
the ground to intercept you, but this gives a much slower response and is
therefore less dangerous - unless the enemy saw you coming from a long way
off.

Distance Flying at maximum weight, especially in enemy airspace, is to be
avoided if at all possible. The length of your route, the load you carry,
and the speeds at which you plan to fly will all influence your fuel
requirement. Therefore the distance factor must be balanced against the
others given above. The estimated fuel consumption for the flight is shown
in the Analysis window.

Selecting Take-off and Landing Direction

Call up the Met. Report and study the wind strength and direction. Now
set up the first waypoint after take-off (inserting a new one if necessary)
so that you will be taking off with a head wind component. See diagram
5.13 for an explanation of how the direction of the first leg dictates
which runway you will be set up to use.

As for landing; the Approach point specified in the Task will normally be
set up to land you into wind, and you will not need to change this unless
you wish to land somewhere else (see below).

Landing away from base

If the distance you have to fly becomes excessive, you might consider
planning to land at another allied airfield This is always possible, as in
the case of diversion for an emergency landing. The only penalty for this
is that during a Campaign the time required for the ferry flight back to
your operating base will delay the start of your next mission. When you
return to the Mission Planner your aircraft will be shown at its base
airfield - the time for the ferry flight will already have been added to
the clock.

If you have to make an emergency landing on a road in Allied territory, you
can be back at your base with a time penalty of no more than a few hours,
but it may take a day or more to return your aircraft to the flight line.
If reserve aircraft are available you`ll notice no change in your strength,
but if your reserves are depleted then your strength will be reduced
temporarily. The same effect may be observed when your aircraft returns
damaged and needs repair, or when heavy losses in the air or on the ground
outstrip the rate of replacement.

Relocating to another airfield

As the campaign progresses, your commander may decide to base you at a
different airfield. This decision could be prompted by a variety of
factors. For example, your current base might be threatened by an enemy
advance or badly damaged by air attack, your priority targets might be
clustered on the other side of the map, or enemy action might have
disrupted the supply system in the base area.

When the order comes to do this, the Air Tasking Message will conclude with
a line like "Relocating to Allied 3" and the skeleton flightplan will show
a landing at the new base. Landing anywhere else will incur the
ferry-flight delay.

SECTION 2b - LEVEL TWO CAMPAIGNS

At this level you are responsible for creating flightplans for your whole
formation of Tornados and selling up coordinated attacks. This section
assumes that you have masytered the process of mission planning for a
single aircraft.

A Task at this level will normally prescribe an attack on a large enemy
installation an airfield, for example - assign targets to each aircraft and
specify a Time on Target. It will be your responsibility to set up the
individual attacks and their precise timing. Here is a list of basic
principles for achieving a successful coordinated attack:

1 : Concentration in Time. No-one reacts instantly: it always takes time
to grasp the situation and work out a response. This is true of AAA and
SAM crews and also of their equipment it takes time to slew and elevate a
gun barrel or a launcher, and time to defeat your ECM. If your entire
attack is compressed into the space of a few seconds with no advance
warning you may be gone almost before the enemy has started shooting. If
your attack consists of four aircraft making separate passes in sequence,
the first aircraft through may escape undamaged but the rest will almost
certainly be shot to pieces. Even if you don`t achieve complete surprise,
you can still hope to saturate the defences. The idea here is that you
have many guns shooting at many different aircraft rather than many guns
shooting at one aircraft at a time.

2: Dispersion in space. So you set up your attack with four Tornados
making a single fast sweep over the target in tight formation. You`re in
and out in thirty seconds or less, but everybody gets hit. What went
wrong? This should be obvious - all the defences were shooting in the same
general direction at the same time. The enemy can concentrate all his
firepower on the small volume of space which contains all of your aircraft,
and stands an excellent chance of hitting something, even if it wasn`t what
he was aiming at. If you send the aircraft in from many different
directions at the same time, you divide the enemy`s fire and reduce his
chances of scoring a hit.

3: Go for the defences first, and do it from as far away as possible.
ALARM`s Indirect mode was designed for situations like this, but when the
weapon is "loitering" there may be quite a delay between the time when the
defence radars turn on, and the time the missile hits them. You may need
to provoke the defenders into turning on their radars BEFORE the strike
arrives but if you`re going to alert them it would not be a good idea to
concentrate their attention in the direction from which the main strike is
approaching.

Another "stand off" tactic would be to pop up far enough to see the
defences on your ground radar, designate them as targets-of-opportunity,
and then perform a loft attack on them. The main difficulty here is in
identifying defences on the radar display, which can only be done on the
basis of their positions around the field. It is standard practice to set
up AAA close to each end of a runway to give the sites a minimum-deflection
shot against a runway cratering attack, but SAM launchers may be harder to
spot. Obviously a single attack of this type can only hope to take out a
single site, but this might be a good way of achieving the object stated
above - shocking the enemy into activating his search and weapon radars so
that ALARM can home on them. If you have to provide a visible threat in
order to attract his attention, it might as well be a real one.

4: Try to avoid blowing each other up. This should be obvious, but it's
well worth repeating. Don't set up the attacks so that one aircraft flies
through the debris hemisphere of another`s bombs. Assume that a 1000 lb
bomb has a debris hemisphere of 1000-feet (305 m) radius, and that a
separation of 200 feet (61 m) is adequate for all other weapons. You can
estimate distances using the coordinate displays on the Target Waypoint and
Point Data windows - the coordinate values are in tens of metres. While
you`re at it, try to anticipate and avoid potential collisions. You can
achieve separation by varying approach direction, altitude or
Time-On-Target (but only within a couple of seconds either way - see next
point).

5: Be on time. If you`re not, not only will you waste all your planning,
but the risk will be increased for every aircraft involved, as you
sacrifice one or more of the principles given above. Arriving on schedule
is the responsibility of the individual aircrew, but it`s up to you as
planner to ensure that the mission timetable has enough slack in it to
survive minor mishaps and diversions.

As with all "wish lists" of this sort, it may be difficult or impossible to
achieve all of these objectives at once. You`ll have to decide for
yourself how to strike the balance between them. The enemy's disposition
and level of awareness will determine just how much you can get away with.

Flightplans for Formations

At Campaign Level Two, when you enter the Mission Planner you will see a
Task outline, just as at Level One. For most of any Flightplan, all your
aircraft will be flying the same route in a widely spaced formation, and
their individual waypoints, legs and times are automatically generated at
an offset from the formation leader. Approaching the Target, the formation
will split as aircraft diverge to their individual Initial Points to start
their separate Attack Runs on different targets. Each aircraft will then
follow its own Egress Run until the formation reforms at a set rendezvous,
with timings and speeds set up so that all aircraft arrive simultaneously
at their correct positions. They then follow a common route (with
automatically staggered Waypoints and Times) back to the airfield for
landing.

In a Formation Flightplan there will be one button in the Aircraft Strip of
the Flightplan Window for each aircraft in the formation A is the Formation
Leader - you. Clicking on an aircraft letter selects that aircraft's
flightplan for viewing and editing.

All aircraft in a formation will have exactly the same number of waypoints
and legs in their flightplans. Some will be formation waypoints, where the
Formation Leader`s waypoint automatically determines the position of the
corresponding waypoint for every other aircraft currently in the formation.
Others are independent waypoints, where each aircraft`s position and all
other waypoint attributes can be set individually, within certain limits.

Limitations on Waypoint Editing

Insertion or deletion of waypoints can only be done when the waypoints or
legs affected are common to all the aircraft in the formation. Buttons for
functions not allowed for the current waypoint will be disabled. This is
why the skeleton flightplan generated for a multi-aircraft mission includes
a Turning Point between Take-off and Target, and another between Target and
Approach Point. If these waypoints were not included you`d find it much
less conveinient to insert new waypoints in the flightplan - don`t delete
them.

Split and Formate

The right most button in the Tool Strip of the Flightplan Window will show
two alternative legends according to the nature of the currently selected
waypoint - "Split" or "Formate". When the selected waypoint is a formation
waypoint, it will show "Split" and clicking on the button will make this
into an individual waypoint for all aircraft in the formation. You`ll be
able to see the effect of this on the map since the individual waypoints
will automatically spread out from the original position. Each independent
waypoint will be of the same Type (Turning Point or Target) as the
formation waypoint which was split to produce them. All other waypoint
attributes except position will also be inherited.

You can now use the buttons in the Aircraft Strip of the Flightplan window
to select the flightplan of any aircraft in the formation. Each aircraft`s
independant waypoints may be dragged about or edited in any way you like,
provided that it`s physically possible for each aircraft to fly its
independent track and rejoin the formation on time at the next formation
waypoint. If you`re asking for the improbable or the impossible, you`ll
see a WARNING or ERROR in the Problems window. This obviously adds another
kink to the problem of "Bound" Times and Speeds, but once again the problem
is inherent in the situation, and you`ll have to learn to handle it by
experiment.

When the selected waypoint is an independent waypoint, the button will show
"Formate". Let`s say that your currently selected waypoint is D, an
independant waypoint, and you`ve selected aircraft B`s flightplan.
Clicking on "Formate" will turn D into a formation waypoint at the same
position. The formation waypoint attributes will be inherited from the
original independent waypoint.

This system of setting all waypoint attributes from the one selected to
split or formate upon is intended to save you time and trouble. For
example: at Command level you`ll be creating flightplans for multiple
aircraft attacks from scratch, and the inheritance system means that you
can create one target waypoint for the formation, then split it into as
many independant target waypoints as you have aircraft. If we didn`t
support this, you`d need to change the type of every independant waypoint
by hand!

As ever, every silver lining has a cloud. The skeleton flightplan
automatically generated from the Tasking Message will give every aircraft
an identical Time- On-Target. If the targets are closely spaced, this
would result in your aircraft blowing one another up. As we suggested
above, you will need to adjust direction, altitude and time of attack to
ensure that this doesn`t happen.
