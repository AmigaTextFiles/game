                 THE COLOUR OF MAGIC  PRESENTS 
                 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~     
                      THE COMPLETE DOX TO
            SHOOT `EM UP CONSTRUCTION KIT - FOR THE AMIGA


             COPIED STRAIGHT FROM THE ORIGINAL MANUAL
              NO LAMER COPIES HERE - JUST ORIGINAL!
	      STRICTLY FOR THE LSD DOCS SERIES ONLY 

                       TYPED BY  SKID MARKS 

DUE TO CU AMIGA RELEASING SEUCK ON THEIR COVERDISK, I DECIDED TO SPREAD
MY DOX FOR IT FOR EVERYONE TO ENJOY !
(Please note that my name SKID MARKS has nothing at all to do with the
game with the same name ! I have been around for years. Still, it's
nice of them to name a game after myself !)


THIS IS THE COMPLETE DOX FOR SEUCK (ONLY MISSING OUT THE ATARI ST)
TYPED UP BY SKID MARKS FOR YOU TO GET THE FULL USE OF THE PROGRAM.
            ~~~~ ~~~~~
(Originally typed up during 1992 - Now back for 1994 with LSD DOX)


*NB* You should have two disks for SEUCK !

     Disk 1 - Editor/Key disk
     Disk 2 - Games/Data disk



MEMORY
------
We recommend at least 1 meg of memory if you are gonna create a huge game
with your own IFF Samples etc.
SEUCK will also work on The Amiga Plus and the A600 (poofter machine).
and the A1200.


BOOTING
-------
Insert disk 1 and it will load itself - amazing stuff !
You won`t have to remove the disk at anytime to get into the editor !



AMIGA EXTRA UTILITIES
---------------------
You can draw loading screens or digitise your own samples using your
Sampler etc. Providing that everything is saved as IFF format.
eg DPaint files - saved as 320 by 200 and a 32 colour screen.

SEUCK will recognise the data and display it as you drew it.



GETTING STARTED (The quick and dirty guide)
===========================================
We are going to work through each function to give you an idea of what
you need to produce a game. 

Load one of the sample games from disk 2 and mess around a bit.
To load a sample game select LOAD EVERYTHING from the LOAD DATA option
on the STORAGE MENU.

Select EDIT SPRITE from the EDIT SPRITE MENU.  Each sprite has a number
and the first one you`ll see is number 0.  Click the  + and - buttons
on the SPRITE NUMBER INDICATOR to step through the sprites. You make 
sprites by drawing on the grid with the coulours.
Press the EXIT button to go back to the main menu.
Each sprite is a frame of animation to be used in an object.

Select EDIT OBJECT from the EDIT OBJECT MENU.  Sprites are combined to
make animated objects.  The objects are the things that you actually 
move around the screen. The current object is displayed on screen as a
series of frames of animation of sprites.  Under the animating picture
window is a button marked Direct or Animate depending on the mode.  
Directional animation is related to the motion of the joystick which 
should be plugged into port two of your trusty Amiga.
Move your joystick to test the animation in the small preview window.
Try diffrerent objects by clicking on the + and - buttons.
Click on the word DIRECT and it changes to ANIMATE. This changes the
animation display to show 18 possible frames of animation.  Test the 
effect by clicking LAST FRAME INDICATOR up to a higher figure.
When you`ve seen enough click it back to DIRECT and then EXIT.

Click on EDIT ENEMY BITS on the EDIT OBJECT MENU.  This shows you the
strength and ammo etc. available to each enemy object.
Click on EXIT.

The map over which you can play is actually a long strip of square 
graphics called BLOCKS.  Click on EDIT BLOCK in the EDIT BACKGROUND
MENU.  Click through the various blocks using the block indictor + and
- buttons.  OK click on EXIT to go back to the main menu.

Select EDIT MAP.  This shows you the map for the level you`re working
on and an unusual cursor !  This is the block cursor and to stamp the 
the current block number (the number in green) onto the map. You
position it and click your mouse pointer on the number.  Pressing the 
button on the + and - signs changes the block number so you get a 
different graphic.  The arrows fast forward you to another part of the
map.  To escape press the RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON.

Select EDIT SOUND EFFECTS (edit IFF SOUNDS).
Click the + and - buttons and look at the sound number at the top of 
the screen and you can see all the sound names assigned to each number.
IFF samples can be loaded from your disks.
There are some already on disk 1 under the Drawers - SOUNDS etc.

Click on PLAYER LIMITATIONS MENU and select PLAYER 1.  Now you can see
all the attributes for your player including the area of the screen it
can occupy.


Now test the game on CHEAT MODE and FUCK AROUND a bit !  To exit a game
you are testing just press BOTH mouse buttons to go back to the editor.
(I added that bit in myself - the manual is so pish !)



THE COMPLETE GUIDED TOUR
========================
If you look very closely at SEUCK you will see that sprites are single
frame graphics and objects are a series of sprites animated together.
The map of your games , the background, is is best thought of as a long
strip of graphics.  Any section of the map can be a level.  Levels can
be scrolling or still.  You can have level 1 in the middle and level 5
at the beginning of your game - it doesn`t matter.  You could play the
entire map capacity of the program as 1 level.

Throughout SEUCK numbers are assigned to sprites, objects and sounds
tell the program which sound or picture belongs where and to what.  In
addition , objects can be joined to make big enemies. (Ooooh ! I`m
frightened now !!!)

Your finished game can be put onto a seperate disk and run independ-
antly of the SEUCK editor/Key disk.
You can pass the finished game to your mates and even release it into 
P.D. or even a software house !  All as long as the SEUCK appears in 
the credits and all is your own work and nothing is taken from the 
demo games which come with SEUCK !
(SEUCK Loader  will appaer at the start of all your completed games, so
don`t give it a mention at all!)
The Bastards have coded it so when your completed game is on a stand
alone disk - it automatically mentions SEUCK !  BASTARDS!!!

Most editing screens have an EXIT button but if it doesn`t then click
your Right Mouse Button to exit.  Or if you are testing a game, then
both mouse buttons will exit ! (Hurray they mentioned it in the manual)
This is in case you have a joystick in port 1 for testing 2 palyer games.

Should you at anytime request a file and insert the disk late, you will
be confronted by a WorkBench tm. Click on the PUT BEHIND icon on the
top bar of the WBench screen.  If you find yorself on a screen which is
requesting a directory or filename and you do not wish to proceed, 
press return.



THE MENUS
=========
a.Edit Sprite

This is where you create the basic graphics which you will later animate
into game objects.
The options on this menu selection are Edit Sprite and Edit Colours and
Erase Sprite (Amiga Only) - Fuck your ST !

Edit Sprite: Presents you with the sprite editor window.  The 24 by 24
grid represents a blank piece of paper which you can draw your sprites.
The small square on thr top right contains the picture of the sprite
size.  The current sprite on the screen will have a number and you can
choose any sprite by clicking on the + and - buttons.

Simply click the colour you want to draw with and click on the sqaure(s)
you want to colour on the grid. Holding down the button will let you 
colour more than one square. (NEVER !)

The mirror button flips the sprite in the direction of the arrow. (Fuck
sake !  We are not that Fuckin` thick that we don`t know what Mirror
Fuckin` means !!!) Fuck this part!

Slide button - Fuck It Not Again !!!! (You work it out and it will save
me typing a load of shit !

The Undo Button - OH FUCK !  AAAARRRGGGG !!!!

FLOOD - OH Fuck this section it`s so pishy !

The COPY BUTTON let`s you copy one sprites graphics to another sprite.
OH FUCK ! - Just click the destination number and the current sprite 
will be copied to that number (OH REALLY ? - WELL BLOW ME DOWN !)

Edit Colours: This is used to change the colours. I`m not gonna type
out more shite here so work it out yourselves or are you lamers ?!?

Erase Sprite: Will erase the current sprite - Who the fuck writes this
pish ?  I wish they would stop treating us like Lamers !
SKID MARKS would like to say FUCK OFF to all the cunts who
treat us like ATARI ST OWNERS !!!



b.Edit Object

Once you have drawn all your sprites you must combine them as objects 
for continuos or directional animation during the game. The options
are as follows:

Edit Object: Displays the object editing window.  Now you can`t alter
any graphics here but you can combine them to make an animated object
for use as a player, enemy, bullet or explosion.
Notice the names of the objects (top of screen) like Player 1, Player 2
Enemy explosion etc. will appear when you click through the objects.
Make sure you place the right graphics into the right objects as you
could end up firing player 2`s object as a bullet etc.

(I am stopping this typing just now to go and have a smoke !)

(Phew that was quick - I`m back !)

To place sprites in an object just select a sprite graphic with the
+ and - buttons on sprite number, then click the mouse pointer on one
of the object frames and the sprite will appear there with its number
underneath.  In animate mode the frames will be in rows and in direct 
mode the frames will be groupedin twos, all 8 joystick directions.

The direct button with the little window above it is for testing out
animations.  In direct mode the object in the window reacts to the
movement of the joystick.  Notice that the graphics are arranged with
two sprites at each of the eight joystick positions.  The reason there
is two graphics at these points is that they animate between the two
when the joystick is in that position.  

Clicking on the direct button will change it to animate and in animate
mode you can do 18 frame animation within the object squares.  Step up
the last frame + and - buttons to set the amount of frames you want to 
animate bearing in mind the first frame is 0 and not 1 !  
The delay button sets the pause between sprites.  Less pause means 
faster animation. (OH FUCK ME ! - I`M SICK OF THE LAMER COMMENTS!)

The No Hold button is another toggle button like direct/animate. This
control sets, when you push an object in a direction,  whether it stays
in that direction or resets to pointing forwards when you release the
joystick.

Copy Object: Lets you copy one object to another ! (AARRGHH!  I`M 
GETTING REALLY FUCKED OFF TYPING IN ALL THIS PISH !)
It will only let you copy it if it is the same type. eg Bullet etc.
The No Hold and Animate buttons won`t work in this mode .

Edit Enemy Bits: The speed option sets the speed of the enemy object
along its path. Setting the range to 0 means it will be stationary.

Points and Hits to Kill are too obvious for me to be bothered typing
all the shit that goes with them !

Fire direction describes the directions in which the enemy will fire!
(AAARRRGGGHHH!) - A box means no firing. R means random. D means 
directional and the rest are easy to work out.

Fire Rate is the period between shots: 100 is equal to not much firing
and 0 is rapid firing.

Bullet speed - OK WORK IT OUT YOURSELF!

Use both the above two to work out which speeds suit your enemy.

(Have I made any spelling mistakes yet ?)

In the same way that you can assign graphics to bullets and explosions
you can also assign sound FX.
The explosion FX and bullet FX buttons do this for you. All you have 
to do is select from the sound effects 0-49 which which you`d like to
represent the sounds of the enemy blowing up or the enemy firing and
these will be stored in memory for you.

The explosion object and bullet object buttons let you select which
graphic you want to represent them. The 8 bullet objects lie between
object 6 and 13 and them 8 enemy explosions lie between 14 and 21.

Collision detection for this enemy is handled on the remaining Enemy
To Ship and Enemy To Bullet buttons. Enemy to ship tells the computer
if you hit an enemy with your ship, whether the enemy will blow up, you
blow up or you both blow up! (Awwch!) 

The bullet option is just the same as above.



c.Edit Background

Select block: In this mode you have access to all the blocks you`ve
drawn so far.  This is handy when you know what graphic you wnat and
know what it looks like, but can`t recall what the number is. Finding
it is easy. (unless you are a lamer like Rincewind - ha ha - only
joking Rincy !).
Just point the cursor over the block you want and click on the green
number.  The block is then stored in memory and the number appears in
the green numbers (Hey I didn`t write the Fuckin` Manual).
You can then go to Edit Block and alter it, or you can place it on 
your map with Edit Map.!!!  The + and - signs on the cursor scan you
back and forth sideways through four or five lines made up of all 
your currently designed blocks laid from right to left.

Edit Block: This window is similar to Edit Sprite except the grid is
bigger at 32 by 32 dots.  You are still limited to eight colours but
these can be a different eight colours from the sprites. PHEW!

Edit Colours: - Nope I`m not gonna type this part!

Edit Mao: This is where you plonk your blocks to make up the map !
The position of the map is always displayed on the centre of the screen.
To stamp the currently selected block (number in green) onto map, you
position the large square where you want to place the graphic and click
your mouse pointer on the green number itself.Pressing the + and -
signs changes the block number so you can select a different graphic.
The arrows fast forward you up and down to a different part of the map.
To escape from the map area just press the right mouse button.



d.Edit IFF Sound

This menu alows you to load and use IFF sound samples to use as the
sound FX for your game.

Edit IFF Sound Effects: This lets you manipulate (change) the samples
that you have loaded in to suit your game.
First you select the sound number at the top of the screen (0-49)  

The twin replay Rate counters always show the same number, but
increment in different amounts - notice the times 100 and times 1 labels
for coarse or fine adjustments.  Using these means that you can alter a
sounds playback speed.  Once selected the effect stays assigned to the
sound effect niumber until changed!  This is the tricky bit !  You can
assign as many different replay rates (speed) to your sound as you like
so you get a lot of different sounds from the one sample. Good Eh!

Effect Voloume - OH FUCK IT.

Clicking on the efffect button plays the current sound being edited.
different sounds can be called up from memory by clicking on the
box next to sample name.  The names come up in the box, and to use
them as an effect you must assign the one in the box to the current
sound number, simply by clicking the use button.  Now you can twiddle
its replay rate and click on effect button to hear it.

The displays next to the sample button cannot be altered, but are the
original settings for the sound, should you get lost and want to hear
the original settings.

The Free Sound Ram refers to the amount of memory you have left for
samples.

Exit: to exit I guess.

Load IFF Sound Files: This assumes the directory is SOUND1 unless 
changed (as above).  All the files in the directory are listed on screen
so select the one you require with the cursor and load it by clicking
the left mouse button. *NB* you can only display up to 24 filenames in a
directory.  Adding another file to a full directory will result in your
new file or an old file in the directory being lost.

Clear IFF Sound: Flushes the current sample from memory.

Exit: - guess.


Now in the manual is a couple of pages to show you how to make sounds
on the ST - It can`t handle sampled sounds in the SEUCK - You have to
produce your own - HA! HA! get working on those beeps and bongs!
Obviously I am not gonna type all the ATARI ST shitty instructions.

BACK TO THE AMIGA.

Any C64 owners (includes you Robert), It has been a long time since I 
used a C64 so I don`t remember how to create the sounds !
I expect it is simple enough though.



e.Player Limitations

In this menu you can edit all the abilities and limitations of your
Player(s).  Within Player 1 and Player 2 menus are indicators to allow
you to edit everything to do with the players.  The options on the
first menu are Player 1, Player 2 and Exit. On both player 1 and 2 
they are identical sub-menus of edit parameters, edit play area and
edit start position.

Edit parameters: This is where you edit the attributes of your player
just like you did in the edit enemy attributes. The settings are exactly
the same except you can select player enable, lives and speed.

Player enable alows you to switch the palyer on or off. Really used on
player 2 if you only want a one player game.

Lives - from 1-10

Ship speed refers to the speed of your ship (Oh Really ? - I would
never have worked that one out in a million years !!!)
This does not alter the speed of your scrolling background though.
To alter that you must enter into the Level Edit Menu.

Edit Play Area: Like the level sections, the player areas are selected
by using the joystick.  Edit play area lets you select the area your
player can inhabit on screen.  To move the top or bottom markers, push
the stick up down and press and hold the fire button and then move them
up or down. (Always get a grown up to help you with the tricky parts!)
To move the side markers in or out push the stick left or right, press
fire and push left or right again - simple eh!

Edit Start Position: lets you position a cross where you want the player
to appear after they die or crash. (I thought they died if they crashed 
too!)
Simply position the cross where you wank your player to appear and press
fire - voila !  When he appears there is a 3 second period of invulnar-
ability to help the player.  Make sure your start position is inside
the play area !!!

Watch out C64 owners coz this part is tricky !!!
If you don`t watch where you are putting your start position, your 
player could end up being stuck on the background !!!
You`ll find out what I mean eventually !!!
Always get a grown up to help you with the tricky bits !!!

Exit - you know what it fucking does!

Player 2: These are the same as above except everything says player 2
and not player 1 !!! AARRRGGHH ! More lamer crap !
Oh by the way did you know that player 2 will not appear on the screen
until some cunt presses the fire button on the joystick in port 1
(mouse port) - Nope neither did I till I tried it !



f.Edit Attack Waves

The attack waves menu lets you place enemies on the map and create their
attack path by using the joystick. The options are as follows:

Insert enemy: In this option you place the current enemy object on the
map. You will see the graphic of the object like the Edit Object Screen.
You select the object you want to place with the object number buttons,
then click place button.

First you coarsly adjust its position with the joystick, making sure
you stop just before the part of the map you want. then you click the
joystick button, and you are asked to fine place the map position on
the screen. (WARNING - You can only push the map up at this stage,
hence the bit about stopping before the section you want the enemy to
be on. Don`t worry about this too much. You`ll suss the problem as 
soon as you use it.) Then you click the joystick button again. You
now see the object you want to place on the screen. Place it on its
starting position and click the joystick button again !  Now you can
input the enemy path using the joystick to move it along the path.
If you press fire on the joystick the enemy will pause at that spot
in the game. Easy Stuff Huh !!! Then click the right mouse button to
finish. Then you`ll be asked to store the path you just created by
pushinhg the stick left or pushing the stick right to reject.

Note: If you place an enemy and make him walk up the screen he might
not appear, as he will be walking at the same speed as the scrolling
screen. You could walk him in from the side of the screen, but avoid
upward movement unless you`ve went down first !!!

Join Enemies: The only problem with joining enemy objects to make one
large enemy is that when you shoot it - only the part you hit will die!
So make sure each bit is independant or it could look queer ! (A bit
like Jason or Eddie Maybe !!!) HA! HA!

To join enemies, select the option, select your object using the object
number buttons, then click on the PLACE button. You`ll be asked to
place the enemy coarsly by using the joystick, just like the last 
optoion. Press fire. Then you`ll be promted to select a fine position
using the joystick again. Press fire. Now a big cross with arrows on 
all points will appear, and the prompt "Join To Which Enemy?" use the
joystick to place the cross on the one you want the new object to
follow. Press Fire. The object will now appear on screen and follow 
the selected object !!!!

WARNING - If you have joined a set of aliens and you delete the lead
object, all the objects attached to it will become stationary.

Delete Enemy: Guess?

Flush Enemy List: Clears all enemy .

The Enemy Units and Path Units Free show how much memory you have left
to play around with.

Exit - Oh fuck this I`m sick of typing this option!


(I`m gonna stop now for another smoke!)

(I`m back again!)



g.Edit Levels

Here is where you edit areas of the map that your levels occupy, and
how each section behaves in play. There`s also a small section devoted
to your player`s starting position  and the amount of screen it can move
around in. The options are as follows:

Edit Level Parameters: It`s here that you adjust the level number,
scrolling speed (if any), the duration of the level, level type and 
what happens at the end of the level.

Level is the level number (1-22)

Speed refers to the speed of background scrolls. (if any) (1-4)
1 or 2 is best.

Duration selects the duration of the level (More lamer talk!).
If you want it to be time limited that is.  If you want NO limit on
the time, and want to give the level time to play out till the end,
select duration 255 (amiga only). *NB* clicking on the - button from
1 gives you 255 just in case you are a lamer and were about to click
the + button loadsa times. (The kind of thing that Strachy would do!)
HA! HA! only kidding mate.

Level Type toggles between scrolling, push scroll and still. Still 
means it`s a one screen level. Scrolling means the level will scroll
at the speed you set. Scroll Push means that that the area will only 
scroll when the player pushes against the top of his/her (let`s not
be sexist) play area. See player limitations for play area.

End Of Level refers to what happens at the end of the level. Again 
this box toggles through various options, continue, loop and redraw.
Redraw means that when the end of the level is reached, the first
screen of the next level will automatically appear. Continue means
that the next level will scroll down. Loop will return the player to 
the beginning of level 1.

Edit Current Level Map: Having selected the level type and speed, you
can then select the area of the map that makes up the level. Pushing 
the joystick up takes you to the Finish Of Level Marker, pushing
down takes you to Start Of Level Marker. Pushing and holding the 
joystick button allows you to move the markers up and down the map.
As soon as you`ve placed your markers you can exit by pressing the
right mouse button (Amiga only).

Exit: Oh what the hell - it takes you to the main menu.



h.Test Game

You can now test your game. Proper test or a cheat test.

Proper test will let you play the finished game as it will look when
on a stand-alone disk.

Cheat test - as above except that you have infinite lives.
Use this option to test your game for any bugs etc.

Free Memory shows how much memory is left on your computer.

Exit - Oh let me think! I wonder what it does?

Oh don`t forget that pressing both mouse buttons will exit you from
testing the game back to the editor.



i.Disk Storage

This brings up a sub menu asking if you want to load certain parts
of a game or everthing. Everything is the entire game and if you load
it, it will destroy any data you have in memory.
The Everything file is what you operate on to make a Boot-Able Game.

Save Data: Selecting this option to save parts etc.

Erase Data: This option allows you to free up space by junking files
from your data disk. Hit twice to erase.

New Drive: To change the dfault drive - just click to change it.

Exit: Oh not again ....



j.Exit SEUCK

It is for you to work out what it does !


Remember if you don`t insert the original Key/Editor disk when prompted,
then most of the above functions will not work !!!
eg - New Drive & Save Data

OOOOOH!  I almost forgot to mention that I found a slight bug !
Please make sure that your autofire is OFF before booting.
This will coz the program to crash (maybe not a Guru but definately
a crash)!
It was by accident that I found this bug and I will write to Gremlin
to let `em know - as if they care !!!



MAKING A FINISHED GAME FROM SEUCK
=================================

AMIGA:
In order to make a finished game from one of your designs you must make 
a DATA disk for SEUCK Game Disk.
This will be the disk you use to store all your game data, plus it will
contain everything you need to boot your game from scratch, or allow it
to be started from an icon in WBench.

ST:
Fuck Off!

Making a SEUCK Game Disk - Amiga
Format a disk - (you do know how to format a disk!)
The disk must be called  SEUCK Game Disk  it must be as it is typed here.
The first five letters must be block capitals and the two other words
beginning with a capital letter. There should only be one space between
each word.

SEUCK Game Disk   (Got it now?)

If you haven`t already did so then load WBench and wait for it to load.
Once it has loaded, insert SEUCK disk 2 (Games/Data disk) and double-
click on the make game icon.
Please note that before you use the Make Game Icon that you must have 
booted up with WBench first!
Yes I Know That Disk 2 boots up to let you choose icons but it does Not
have any room on it for all the commands like Copy etc.
Boot WBench and then Insert Disk 2 and choose the Icon. PHEW !  The 
things I do for Lamers !!!

Follow the On-Screen instructions from now on until finished. At this
point you will have created a Skeleton disk that will be fleshed out
by your game. It would be usefull to make copies of you Skeleton Disk
just in case you Fuck Up This Next part Lamers.

Load the notepad from WBench (in the utilities drawer) .
From notepad select OPEN and select DF0:S/STARTUP-SEQUENCE on the 
Skeleton Disk you have created. The first line will read LOADWB - 
delete this line and replace it with the name of your game TWICE !
eg If your game is called SHITE then you would type SHITE SHITE 
(next to each other on the same line)
Save this to your Skeleton Disk. Make sure your Skeleton Disk is still
in DF0: and quit notepad. Now click once on the SEUCK default icon, and 
using the rename option and change the disks name to the same name as
your game.  SHITE in this case.
Finally load SEUCK the game,create a full game, and then save it to
your Skeleton Disk.
Remember to save it as  Save Everything.

It is now complete for you to pass onto friends etc.

Note from SKID MARKS - Any text editor will do to write your Startup-
sequence. you don`t have to use Notepad.

I didn`t see any info about a loading screen for AMIGA SEUCK GAMES
but I do know that all you have to do is draw a picture on DPaint
or any paint package that saves its files as IFF format and
Call it  The Logo  (with a space) and save it to your finished game disk.



Help
===

-On disk 1 there are 3 SOUND directories full of samples

-If you need a certain sound to play at a certain part of your
 game then you could use an invisible object to do it. These are objects
 with No graphics in them. They can be used to trigger a sound if they
 are shot or stood on, bumped into or they can do it just once and die.
 You could have an invisible object on a bridge and make it trigger a
 creaking noise when you walk over it etc.

Note: If an invisible object is shooting to make its sound then make 
      sure that it is shooting away from the action or your player
      might be killed!

-Players 1 and 2 do not have to be the same objects - eg Player 1
 could be a helicopter and player 2 a boat etc.

-Just follow the order of these DOX and you can`t go wrong.
 I suggest that you don`t try and create a complete game straight
 away but mess around for a few hours and test out the games on disk 2.


I hope this Doc File is of some use to you and you get the most out of
SEUCK.  I have included some info on this file that wasn`t in the manual
that should have been there !

Don`t forget that any PD Library that has any games made with SEUCK
could help you out too!
Buy a copy of any SEUCK Game and load it in to your editor and mess
around a bit - You might learn from other game designs.
On disk 2 are three games that you can fuck around with and hopefully
you will start to fully understand SEUCK.
It is tricky to get the hang of at first but in no time at all you
should be entering your productions into PD Land !

I hope you enjoy SEUCK and have loadsa fun writing games on your AMIGA.
Look out for other SKID MARKS and RINCEWIND disks soon.
