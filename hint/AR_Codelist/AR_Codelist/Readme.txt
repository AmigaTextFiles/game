The pokes featured have come from other disks, magazines, and
others I`ve found myself. It is without doubt probably the largest
collection of pokes available and took a LONG time to complete.

Note:
-----

Some of the games listed, I don`t have so I can`t say if they work. However
if a poke was found on an Amiga 500 with 0.5 Chip/0.5 Fast, very rarely it
may not work on an A500+, as in some cases the game is loaded differently
into this configuration, as the 500+ has 1Meg Chip Memory. But on the
whole, most should work on any machine. In very rare cases, some games load
into different memory locations depending on your kickstart (see Bubble
Bobble for details) this is very rare and as far as I know only occurs with
Bubble Bobble.

So How Do I Put These Pokes In ?
--------------------------------

Well for those people who could`ent be bothered reading the manual that
came with their Action Replay cartridge, here how`s to enter the pokes.

Let`s take the game `Deliverance` as an example:

1) Load the game.
2) Start the game, and press the red button on your Action Replay.
3) You`ll notice it says: Lives = 54b. Address 54b is where the lives
   counter is situated. 
4) Type M 54b and you`ll see a line of hex. Type FF over the first two
   characters of the line 
5) Press [RETURN]
6) Press ESCAPE
7) Press `X` followed by [RETURN] to return back to the game.
8) You now have 255 lives !

For Games which have been installed using Bert Jahn's WHDLoad Package:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
For those of you who are using Bert Jahn's WHDLOAD install package
*register it now !* this wonderful program lets you install all those games to
your hard disk, which were never previously hard disk installable. HRTMon
(available from Aminet) is a software based version of Datel's Action Replay
and allows you to freeze the game and input codes. You will also
need a level 7 interupt button soldered onto your trapdoor slot to activate
the HRTMon freezer software, which you can mount in a handy place so
you can freeze the game at a press of a button to input particular codes.
