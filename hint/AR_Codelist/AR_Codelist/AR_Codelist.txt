Here are a large collection of pokes for Datel's Action Replay cartridge.
Most I got from magazines, similar disks, and others I found myself, this
is very old, I compiled it in 1994, 8 years later and I finally decided to
upload it. Hope somebody finds it useful :)

Most of the codes listed can also be used with HRTMon and Level 7 interupt
button (if you have one soldered to the trapdoor slot of your Amiga).

A hex to decimal conversion chart I have also included, you can use this to
choose how many lives, grenades, etc you want.
