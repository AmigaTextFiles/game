Welcome stranger!  A new Amiga text magazine, to help gamesplayers
everywhere!  This is freeware, so spread it far and wide, no information in
this magazine is taken from other Amiga lists (eg. Anarchy Amiga etc.), but
permission is given for you to steal from here, 'cos I know you will
anyhow!  But please credit here as your source, thanx!  My sources: LSD,
Loons, many others and me, but >NOT< OTT!

This may not be used on an OTT docs disk `cos their just crap, stop
walking in the shadows of others, even some of the menu source is the same
as LSD`s, I checked!  And why do your intros look like LSD`s?  Do something
original lamers, release something good instead of useless utilities no
other crew would be bothered with (except maybe Phun!).  Appologies to
Sponge, your cool dude, lose the lamers!

                 Simple Simon saw a coder, calling his BBS,
              Said Simple Simon to the Coder, Please join OTT,
             Said the coder to Simple Simon, what will you pay?
    OTT pay in cards `cos it`s the only way to get elites in the group!

                                   Hints

To kill the first boss run up to him and keep shooting.  When he is about to
drop his head on you, run to the side. Keep repeating this to kill him.

When you arrive at the second boss go right up to the eye and keep shooting.
You'll get over run by other eyes, so press button 1 to get rid of them.

The third boss is pretty simple, keep shooting at him and duck when he fires
back.

Lastly, to kill the end-of-game nasty, stay in the corner of the screen and
keep shooting. When he comes up to you, jump over him and shoot him in the
back.

To continue the game when you die;

Push up and left and both buttons and right or left or up or down.  If this
doesn't work press both buttons and up-left, up-right, down-left, down-
right.

Or try this; to gain an extra life press top left and press the start
button.

                                 Solution

                                  DAY 1

Start by gathering all the information you can from Biff and Dusty, unless
you already know what's going on.  Go to the gas station and get acquanted
with Elmer.  Then take a trip to KBUG.  Dusty then tells you about the
aftermath of the last ant attack and gives you a gun and a Geiger counter.
Hang around until the afternoon and visit the platt university lab.  In
there you'll find little Billy and his scheptical dad. Ignore the old man
and listen to all Billy's advice. For some further info pop in on Ida the
fortune teller.  Get home for around eight and you'll be able to spend a
not so quiet evening with the ever amorous Jackie.


                                  DAY 2

Once again your first excursion should be to KBUG, where Dusty warns you
of the impending threat from the G-men.  After that go to the lab where
Billy has some more useful information for you.  You will have a run in
with Jackie at some stage, which will lead to a fight with her boyfriend.
At about one o'clock drive over to Neptune Hall where you'll find Billy
Bob acting even stranger than usual, if you count strange as a full set of
antennae and mandibles.  You've just met your first Ant head.  Whip out
your Colt .45 and shoot him where the antennae joins the head.  After the
transformation from Ant-head to Billy Bob you get one of the most vital
pieces of information in the game, a number.  Make a note of this, and
thats day two.


                                  DAY 3

Sat your alarm clock for nine o'clock. You should wake up with Jackie at
the door, who then wakes you up even further by becomming an Ant-head.
Shoot her head as before, and write down the number she gives you.  Plod
over to the ore plant and butter up the manager by selecting 'Crude
Remark' A.  Hop onto the train to M3 and dispose of the Ants you find
there.  Once you've massacared a few dozen Ants shimmy back to platt
laboratory for a meet with Billy.  He will give you some Pez (a sugary
sweet, which enables to tell if people are Ant-heads).  Try to arrive at
the Police station at around five o'clock, get knocked unconscious and put
in hospital.  When you regain consciousness, the nurse will give you the
location of the vault where the Ant-heads store the records of the
conversion process.  Then all you have to do is escape.


                                  DAY 4

Drop in at Elmore's.  When he turns into an Ant-head, shoot his head as
before and get the final number.  Once you have all three numbers go to
the Hospital, grab a wheelchair, and take a lift to the basement. Towards
the top-right of the floor is the morgue, recognise the four black slabs
and the grey safe inside.  Go up to the safe and enter the numbers in the
order you found them.  If you have done this correctly, you will
automatically collect the documents.  If you manage to escape from the
Hospital, lizard Breath finally wakes up to the threat of the ants, and
quite courteously puts you in charge of wiping them out.  The Queens nest
is near mine four, jump into a hole left by one of the Ants, and leave a
time-bomb.

                                   Hints

1. Before you can get very far into the game you must understand the
ordering system.  A handwritten order is dispatched by a rider who takes
it to the relevant corps commander while (hopefully) avoiding the enemy
and any routing units.  If received, orders aren't carried out immediately
- relevant commanders must be informed and their units may be several
miles from the HQ.  You may never know if your orders reach their
destination or if they are misunderstood down the chain of command.

2. It is a good idea to ask for battle reports every half-an-hour or so,
especially from heavily engaged units.  The corps commander will normally
send a couple of messages with the rider who returns his combat reports,
giving information concerning the status of his men.  Even if the news
seems irrelevant, you will learn more about how your troops are doing than
if the corps commander only seldom sends a report.

3. Artillery is precious and should not be wasted. Royal Horse Artillery
can move very fast - they can shell one target and abruptly change
location to shell another.  Move your artillery to high ground as soon as
possible where it has a clear field of fire all around and is difficult to
dislodge.

4. Do not try ordering routing or disordered units because they will
ignore you. Routing units usually retreat away from the enemy, but can
blunder into deadly artillery fire.  Beware if they pass near your HQ
because several important riders may be caught up in the rush and killed.
Routs are worse than disorders and routing units may become disordered
before they rally and be ordered again.  Keep a it out of battle for a
while when it rallies and when engaged, ensure allied units are ready to
give support if necessary.

5. Surround stubborn enemy units instead of assaulting them head-on.  This
will ensure that no messages leave or reach the unit and it is completely
isolated making it easier to destroy.

6. It is possible for "Blitzkrieg" tactics to succeed.  Your cavalry,
while being supported by horse artillery, can penetrate the enemy lines.
When the enemy is weakened enough, he can be routed by the slower moving
infantry and foot artillery units.


                                 NAPOLEON

1. Davout's corps are several miles from the HQ and your riders will take
time to reach him. He, with Merle, Fery and Maragon, are in danger of
being cut off from the rest of the army.  Order these corps as soon as
possible or they will form a defence line and retreat if they can't hold
ground.

2. Trielhard's divisions can form a rearguard to replace lost or routing
units.  At the end of the day, they can be used to charge the enemy off
the field when he's weak.

3. Reinforce Lannes as he prepares to repel the attacks of Bagration, two
miles to the east.  He is heavily outnumbered with his 16 units facing
Bagration's 24 and although an offensive line will need more men, he can
defeat Bargration with minimal casualties when defending, especially on
rough ground.

4. Girschowitz, Puntowitz and Schlapanitz are usually the scenes of fierce
battles so try to hold them if you can.  Your troops can later regroup
here.  Remember, the terrain favours a defensive stance.


                                ALEXANDER

1. The Austrian militia under Kollerwrath are poor quality and can be
relied on to rout very easily.  However, they are good cannon fodder and
can be sacrificed to hold off artillery fire when you attack the enemy
elsewhere.

2. Bagration is in prime position to attack the northern French flank and
if he advances fast enough (by smashing Lannes' corps) he can be a serious
threat to the enemy HQ.  Napoleon may even have to move the HQ futher from
his troops and waste valuable time reinforcing Lannes' troops.

3. You have enough forces to split the French army in half, possibly at
Kobelnitz. If this is achieved, communications will be cut because all the
riders trying to barge through your troops will be killed.  Napoleon must
now either send his riders on a long detour or try to break through your
troops, both of which will be costly and time consuming. During this
period the French commanders will their own initiative and (hopefully)
launch unsuccessful and uncoordinated attacks.  It's doubtful the French
can now recover the position.

THE PENDULUM: Go to the first spot on the screen when the pendulum swings
nearest to you, run your head off, jump at the last minute and pray.  Most
of the time it works.

You need a bow with the fire throwers.

At about what percentage do the fire throwers come in?  At about 50%.

THE SHIELD: you can't win without it.  It is two screens after the dragon.
What do I do with it?  You will need it later.  The situation for the
shield  be obvious, read the manual and you will see it.

Do the down commands before you reach a ladder.

STRATEGY: Have a good memory.  A couple of notes though.  Don't bother
with the tin man, he is just there to scare you.  When facing a QBert,
walk towards him, then when he makes his second jump, evade and strike.
Also, on the screen where the guy comes out from the floor, run towards
him and jump just after he shoots.  Then strike to destroy the guy
walking.  On qbert, run and flip over him.  He turns around and comes
back, but you easily out run him.

The easiest way to get the dragon is right after you enter that screen,
fire two arrows quickly and evade immediately, which means you need the
second bow.  Just flip over his fireball. You will need every arrow later
on, so save them.  When you reach the fire shooters you will wish you had
arrows.

The club guys are easy to do away with using the sword.

After the dragon comes the screen with the shield.  Then after climbing a
series of ladders you come to a series of wooden walkways with ugly guys
with clubs.  After this comes a screen with falling dagger traps and then
comes the pendulum.

Keep going up and to the right to see the pendulum.  You'll know you are
there when the screen changes to a reddish color.

To get the second bow, first I do away with the guard.  Next run and flip
onto the bow screen to miss the trap.  Then run to the bow, grab it and
immediately evade out of there.

To preload commands (because of programming delays, when fighting, some
leading is necessary) press run, jump, down all at once and it will follow
the order.

Use the mouse.  Much better control than joystick.

The Ironman is invincible.

Here are some helpful guides to some of the missions to help you get the
most out of your trusty tank.

                              AIRFIELD ATTACK

Make sure you destroy all the buildings near the runways and any other in
the vicinity.  For this reason you need to make sure that you're stocked
up on IR surface-to-air missiles.


                                 HIDEOUT

The only way to complete this mission is by using mortars - it's a good
idea to take two sets of mortars with you.  When you reach the circle of
mountains use the exterior views at maximum distance to find the exact
location of the target then use the mortars, set at around 500-700 yards,
to blast it.


                               DESTRUCTION

Try to avoid the crossroads where possible, as there are always gun
emplacements based at them.  If you are short of ammo and still have a lot
of buildings to destroy, sit next to them and wait for the enemy to fire
on your position, then move out the way.  Their shots will do the task
well!


                             MISSILE BATTERY

This is pretty straight forward so keep your head and push on!


                                SATELLITE

To begin with, head south-west across the bridge then follow your scanner.
If your rear-end starts to get badly damaged, driving around backwards can
help balance it out, as well as giving you the chance of blasting any
enemies that try and follow you.  When you reach the satellite, remember
to drive into it slowly.


                                 KAMIKAZE

Forget about the roads and travel south-east until you come to where the
river and mountains nearly meet instead.  Now whiz through the gap to the
pick-up point to escape.  Remember to take plenty of air-to-air weapons
and self-protection systems.


                                  U-BOMB

One clue to this mission is to note the fence at the entrance of the
valley works by electricity - and the electricity pylons are on the other
side of the river.  Try to blow up the U-Bomb with Dragonflies for some
spectacular results!


                              GENERAL HINTS

When the chopper arrives at the pick-up point try to destroy all the
enemies in the area; there's nothing worse than getting blown-up as you
board the chopper!  When using the pulverisor cannon set your binoculars
at maximum magnification for greater accuracy.  Use trees and buildings
for cover if you're being pursued.  Destroy enemy aircraft as soon as
possible to strengthen your position and note that you can also use
surface-to-air missiles to blast ground targets.  One last thing - keep
moving!

                            SCENE 1: DORIN'S DELVE

Level one consists of a treasure chest and an entrance to level two.  Walk
along the cliff face to reach the chest and grit your teeth while you make
your way past an arrow.  Walk up the dark brown earth track to the cliff
face, and you wake up the sentries.  Dodge them by walking left around the
bushes.  When you get to the cliff face just walk up and down - doing this
will open the cave entrance.

Once you're on level two, you will find a corridor with stairs at the end.
Walk down the centre of the corridor as there are lots of pits on either
side. At the end of the corridor go up the stairs to level three.  Here
you will find a small room with a locked door.  There's a lever in the
wall on the left hand side which opens it.  Walk up and down in front of
the mirror to find out what the secret code is.


                             SCENE 2: DULHAM

Just a few huts here, plus a few people and a pit trap at the end of the
road in the middle of the village.  Set this off and your rear and huddle
formations suffer losses.  The locked hut can be opened by finding a key
which is behind the next hut to the right.


                           SCENE 3: BRIGHTLEAF

This elf scenario comprises a large transporter field and an underground
section.  You can escape from the transporter field by taking the spade
and walking up to the tree on the small grassy knoll.  The underground
section is accessed by walking over the bridge and into the cave on the
lefthand side.  Once inside, pick up the small glowing syones as they can
be used to remove stalactites.


                          SCENE 4: AXEHEAD HILL

There are two caves here and the one nearest the river conceals a special
lever.  This lever disables all the pit traps on this level, but require
you to perform a particular ritual to make it work.  First deal with the
two orcs and walk right up to the lever and away again.  The lever changes
position.  If you then enter the other cave, you can kill the orc in the
corner and then follow the passage to the end, where it turns left.  Here
you find a room, after which the passage continues.  Stay on the lefthand
side as you pass through.  Once you are through, keep going until you're
out of the underground section, using the cave exit at the end.

You now find yourself on the other bank of the river.  The cave nearest
the river requires caution for you to enter safely.  Once inside the cave,
move left as far as possible and then go up.  You find yourself in a cave
full of spiders, but moving back down transports them all outside again.

                                   FIRST

The first planet you should go to is the one with the submarine - the
reason for this is you can collect at least twelve lives. The only weapons
you need are the up and down missiles. If you die, get the missiles
immediately because you need them to get maximum money.  Just before you
reach the snakes, go to the middle of the screen and start shooting.  If
you have the up and down missiles, you will only have to hit them a few
tomes. Watch their patterns, and you can manoeuvre around them easily. You
have to shoot the snakes in the head to quickly destroy them.


                                    SECOND

The second planet you should go to is the red planet - the hardest one.
Get the up and down missiles as often as you can because you wont survive
very long without them.  If you finished the green planet with about ten
lives you will probably use about half of these on this stage. When you
get the chance, collect as much money as you can to ensure a regular
supply of weapons and lives.  At the end of this stage you confront a
round face with little arms all the way round it.  Shoot all the arms
'till they disappear, but be careful, because they continually shoot balls
at you.  Make sure you have the up and down missiles otherwise you will
have no chance.


                                     THIRD

The next planet to go to is the helicopter one - the easiest.  On this you
don't need any weapons at all apart from the ones you get anyway!  This
planet is easy, and it gives you a chance to collect a few more lives.  At
the end of this stage you get a spaceship that goes up and down and fires
at you. Just shoot the middle of it by keeping your chopper lined up with
it' centre.


                                    FOURTH

The final level to tackle is the one with the man.  Again get the up and
down missiles each time you die, and once again collect money for lives
and weapons.  If you have the up and down missiles you shouldn't have any
trouble.  At the end of this stage you get a sort of pointed snake with
lumps on it's back.  Blast all the lumps and then shoot it in the mouth.

If your patient enough, a good way of starting is to recruit your way
through all of the chracsters, taking their belongings, and then dismissing
them. Yuo can now sell all weapons you don't want, to end up with about 200
coinage. You will also have a plentiful supply of food and keys, so
remember to have only one character carrying the keys to save on backpack
space.

The best combination of characters is to have two fighters at the front,
and two wizards at the back. It's difficult to say which colours are best,
since they all have spells which come in very useful.  The yellow Vivify
spell is probably best, but red spells such as Vitalise, fireball and
firebath tend to be most frequently used.  Note that the first time you use
the Vivify spell, you will need about 70 to 80 spell points if the
character casting the spell isn't yellow.

Any items you come across can be sold to any creature, so long as they're
not one of the characters you robbed at the beginning of the game.  You can
quite easily reach and maintain the maximum of 99 coinage this way.

As far as fighting goes, make sure you don't get trapped while using the
'hack and step back' method, only to realise that you haven't saved the
game for some time. Occasionally it is possible to worm your way out of
this situation by using the confuse and terror spells and talking to the
creature.  Keep boasting to it about how great you are, and then threaten
it. Every now and then the creature will turn and run, but unfortuanally
this is quite rare.

A good tip is the 'hiding behind the door technique'.  Stand to one side of
the wooden door with the creature on the other side and keep clicking on
the fight icon until the creature opens the diir.  Sometimes it is possible
to get a hit from both of your front characters and close the door before
the creature hits you.  If the creature then opens the door straight away,
you won't need to click on the fight icon again.  If there is a delay,
you'll probably have to keep hitting it.  If you've worried that one of
your characters is going to die, then lock the door usinf magelock, as it's
quite easy to make the mistake of locking the door open if you use a key.
With the door locked you can give your characters a rest, allowing them to
recuperate and be ready for the next fight.

An easy way to complete a level is to blow up all the bombs on the level
first, and see which squares remain undamaged.  These are squares the player
should aim to finish on.

Study the map carefully before trying to complete each of the levels.

When attempting to detonate a pulsing bomb, pick it up, as it is easier to
the bombs size when it's picked up.

Remember that when you are tleporting a droid, you are impervious to the
effects of the monsters on the levels.

When teleporting from square to square you are invulnerable to the
explosions.

Switches have three phases: Phase 1 = Set
                            Phase 2 = On
                            Phase 3 = Off.
Phase 1 can never be reversed after a switch has been operated.

When teleporting, the explosions occour before you teleport, so if you are
teleporting onto a mine, it will be destroyed before you get there, provided
the square is in the blast radius and is riveted.

The mouse makes the game more difficult and should only be used by
experienced users.

When dealing with more than one nasty, try to kill them off as quickly as
possible; use the dissolving squares and switches to make the squares to
dissapear beneath them.

When using sighted droids you may activate switches, but when the bomb blows
up the droid will die. Also if you try to move the droid away from the bomb
you will move when the bomb and the droid have been destroyed.

A blind droid can not activate switches.

                                   Hints

- In Choppas, land on the enemy to kill them - safer than landing and
getting out.

- In missions in which you have control of a lot of troppers separate the
lowest ranking trooper from the rest and give him all the weapons, make sure
the rest are safe, then attempt the mission with one trooper.  If the
trooper dies just press Esc.  This saves a lot of troopers later, such as in
Mission 18 Phase 5 of 5 - The Doors.

- Troopers are able to throw grenades quite a long way and over walls, trees
and buildings.  Use this to your advantage to protect against Big gunz and
Jeeps.  To throw a grenade a long way, simply position the pointer further
than needed.

- Buildings can be destroyed even if you can`t see them.  For instance, if a
trooper is in a Biggun and there is a building slightly off the edge of the
screen, roughly aim at the building making sure the pointer is at the very
edge of the screen and Fire.

- Learn to control Jeeps and Skidooz early on (how to skid them).  In later
levels you may need good control to hit ramps at correct angles otherwise
you can blow up if you hit walls.  This is also useful to get away from
shells, rockets and grenades.

- An effective way of destroying snipers is to just run straight towards
them and shoot your guns.  Don`t waste grenades on them unless it is
necessary.


                                 Cheat mode

You must have a save game disk prepared:

1: At Boot Hill, click on SAVE icon in the upper right corner
2: Click on SAVE, and then OK when you insert your save disk
3: When it prompts you for a filename, enter 'JOOLS'
4: Below the EXIT button, 'CHEAT MODE ACTIVE' will flash

Now your current troop leader is instantly a 4 Star General.  This makes him
run faster and have a more rapid fire rate.  There may be other benefits not
discovered.  He might be able to take more hits before dying but I'm not
sure so I didn't say so.

                                   Hints

German tanks have a worse hill climbing ability than both American and
Russian tanks.  This point determines strategies for both divisions - if
you're playing as the Germans a good tactic is to wait at the top of hills
and rush down at the enemy when they approach, whereas if you take control
of the allies, then it's a good idea to escape by heading up the steepest
hill, so as to slow down any tanks that are in pursuit.

The program actually works out the angle of incidence of any shot, and
uses the data to calculate the most effective use of armour.  Therefore an
oblique shot on a tank will have more armour to penetrate than a 'square
on' blast.  So if you are under attack, try to make sure that the enemy
have to fire angled shots, but if you are attacking, then try to get a
good, straight (that is 90 degrees) shot to do the most damage.  Front
armour is the best defence on all tanks, so always try to face the enemy
straight on so as to present the toughest face.  For this reason, you
should also try to attack enemy tanks' flank or rear where they are less
protected.

One of the most sensible tactics to use (the computer player employs this)
is to form the heavy tanks into groups and leave the light tanks to
reconnoitre.  This means that the lighter, faster tanks can act as your
'eyes', giving advance warning of enemy manoevres - they can also run away
quickly!  The tactic they use when under the auto-driver, is to run away
from anything they can't shoot, reporting the sightings to your force.
You can then move the heavy boys in tackle the situation.

When using map firing, always remember that any shells fired will take
about 30 seconds to hit the ground, so try to judge where the enemy tanks
will be when the missiles strike and aim your guns there.  Be warned,
however, that computer-controlled tanks don't look for map fire, so keep
clear of the area until all the shells have landed.

Don't go for a whole bunch of heavy guns, instead try to build a balanced
tank-force.  Light tanks are useful for reconnaissance and also as an
emergancy reserve, whereas heavy tanks are good for straight head-to-head
battles.  Medium tanks combine the advantages of both light and heavy
vehicles, but lack the speed and firepower of the others.

Don't forget to use your drone tanks!  Direct one to hold an enemy tank's
attention while driving your tank to their rear from where you can unleash
a powerful attack.  Watch out when doing this though, as the computer tank
has two objectives - to both defend itself and attack any player tanks.
Thus it will turn it's strongest armour towards the most powerful gun and
take out the lightest enemy tanks.

Different tanks are useful for different things, and experienced players
will be able to utilise the individual strenghts of each.  Here are some
notes on the strenghts of some different tanks:

CHAFFEE: Very fast and cheap.

M36 GMC: Also very fast and has a good gun, but does suffer from fairly
weak armour.

SHERMAN FIREFLY: Good gun, medium speed capacity and quite adequate
armour.

PERSHING: Has the same gun as the M36 with medium speed, but does have the
advantage of good armour.

PANZER III: Very cheap, but not particularly good at any one thing.

PANTHER: Excellent front armour, a good gun and average mobility, but the
side and rear armour are both on the weak side.

TIGER 1: Excellent all-round armour and good gun.

KING TIGER: Best armour and gun of any tank, but travels slowly.

T34/76: Good all-round armour (as with the other Russian tanks), good gun
but has average speed.

KV1S: Better armour than the T34/76, but has the same gun.

KV85: Is blessed with a better gun than the KV1S has.

JSII: Excellent armour and gun and has good mobility.

                                 NATO STRATEGY

NATO's main role is to halt the Warsaw Pact advance before the red
steamroller reaches France. Depending on the scenario and strength of
units there are a number of ways of accomlpishing this.

The first requires NATO to open a gap at the centre of the pact line. The
quickest way of doing this is to set a dozen or so planes on your assault
breaker, set your units to chemical weapons and launch a single nuclear
strike early on at the strongest, most central unit. Before long a gap of
two squares should have been opened. Send your three nearest, strongest
units through the gap behind the northern pact armies. Keep these three
units supplied as best as possible. The only obstacle will be the 9th
Shock Army who have an army strength of nine. Concentrate your assault
breakers on this unit and try to whittle it down. Also set ten squadrons
of planes to attack supply lines in order to prevent the Soviets from
restocking.  This should end with the pact northern armies being
eliminated leaving you to concentrate all efforts on the weaker southern
army group.


                           WARSAW PACT STRATEGY

The Warsaw Pact role is easier.  Try to drive three groups through the
centre, top and bottom of the NATO line as the objective is to conquer
France and West Germany rather than get bogged down in combat.  Don't
waste time attacking neutral units either as it just wastes time.  If you
really do feel like massed combat, use one or two single nuclear strikes
plus chemical weaponry, this should prove fun, if not lengthy.


                             NUCLEAR TACTICS

While not the most devastating, single nuclear strikes are the safest.
They stand a lesser chance of provoking heavy retaliation and more
importantly limit civilian casualties, helping to give you a good score.
If towards the end of thirty days it looks as though you are not going to
complete your goal there is a fireplan that will eliminate eight enemy
units - also a good move to use when you are on the verge of defeat as it
can swing the course of the war.  One side-effect it does carry a
potentially large reprisal from the enemy, so be warned!

And remember, the object is not to end civilisation, but to triumph with
minimal civilian and military deaths.

Start out with "N", "E", "N", "E", "Get Wagon". Then "W",  "S", "E", "Get
Rock", "E", "Open Box", "Get Key",  "N".  You are now at the anthill which
you must plug up.  So, "Plug Hole", it asks you with what?  And you answer
"Rock".  Then "N", "Get Ring".  This is a magic ring which will transport
you from one place to another if you have been to that place before (you
can't go anywhere you haven't been).

Continue with "S", "W", "N", "N", "E".  Then "Drop Key".  You are leaving
the key here for future use.  Then "W", "W", "Get Shovel".  You are in
the graveyard.  Occasionally there is a ghost that appears who will hide
any of the items you are carrying.  If he does this, then you will find
the items here,  but you must dig the grave to get them.

Now go "E", "N", "W", "Get Rope", "S", "W", "Tie Rope", (it will say to
what?), you say "Tree", then "Tie Rope" again, to "Wagon", and "Drop
Wagon" and "Climb Down", "Rope".  You are at the bottom of the cliff, so
"Get Wagon", "W", "S", "S", "Get Life-belt", "Wear Life-belt", "N", "N",
"N".

At this point it would be a good idea to save game because you have to
cross the crevasse by jumping it and occasionally you don't make it.  Now
"Jump Crevasse", "N", "Look Sign",  "Get Corkscrew", "N",  "Get Bottle",
"S", "S".  Then save game before trying the crevasse again.  Now "Jump
Crevasse", "S", "W", "W", "Read Printing" .  There is an incripted
message on the base of this monument which translates to "Pyramid Marker
Guards Buried Chest.  Excavate with Great Care".


                                 PART TWO

Now go "N", then "Cross River".  It will ask in what?  And you answer
"Wagon".  Then it will ask you what do you use as a paddle and you say
"Shovel".  Now you are across the river, so "Drop Life-belt", "Drop
Shovel", "Drop Ring", "Drop Bottle", "N", "E", "E" "Get Amulet".  This
amulet will keep the ghost from stealing your goods, however, now that
you no longer have the wagon, you can only carry four items, so you won't
be able to use it very much.

Continue with "E", "E", "S", "Get Lantern" "N", "N", "N", "W",  "Get
Matches", "S", "W", "S", "Drop Lantern", "Drop Matches", "Get Bottle",
"N", "N".  You are now at the fog.  At this point you have to empty your
wine bottle and fill it with something you can use.  So "Open Bottle", "
Spill Bottle".  The fog automatically fills the bottle so "Close Bottle"
to keep it in.

Then go "S", "S", "Get Ring", "Get Lantern", "Get Matches", "Light
Matches", "Light Lantern", "Drop Matches", "Drop Amulet".  Now you need to
use the ring to get back to the church so "Rub Ring" and it will ask you
where you want to go.  Answer "Church".  Then go "E", "Drop Ring", "Get
Key", "Unlock Door".  It will say with what? You say "Key".


                                PART THREE

You are inside the church, so go "S", then "Look Music".  Notice what key
the music is written in.  Now go "N", "Open Trapdoor", "Go Down".  You
are in the maze beneath the church. Go "W", "N", "W", "N", "N", "E", "S",
"E", "N", "W", "S", "E", "Get Sword", "Drop Key".  Then go back with "W",
"N", "E", "S", "W", "N", "W", "S", "W", "S", "W", "W".

You are now in a room with a Zombie.  This is where you use your bottle,
so "Open Bottle".  At this point it tells you the fog hides you so you can
escape. Continue with "N", "N", "N".  You are now out of the cave.

Now go "W", "N", "W", "S", "W", "S", "S", "Get Shovel", "Drop Lantern",
"N", "N",  and you find yourself back at the fog.  Now use the sword to
"Cut Fog".  Then go "N", "E".  You have found the pyramid marker referred
to in the message.  So, "Dig Carefully", "Unlock Chest".  It will say with
what key?  You answer "G" (remember the key the music was written in?).
You have now opened the chest and finished the adventure -
Congratulations!

This isn't a "blow-by-Blow" solve, but this is how to do it!

Having problems crossing the lake?  Get and wear the loincloth first!

Can't open the big door?  Unlock the display cabinet with the teensy weensy
key and get then drop the vase to get a chunky key!

Kill the Dragon with the sword to obtain a potion.

Get the whip from the "school" then give it to the nun to get a wrench.

Give the wrench to the couple on the bed to obtain a ladder!

Now you have the ladder you can enter the offices of felt-a-bore.  The
Amethyst is in the pot with the cooking hobbit.

Drink the potion and turn the handle on the Alchemist's tower and enter.

Give the Amethyst to the Alchemist (don't go upstairs or you die).

                                  Solution

Type anything that is enclosed in quotes, nothing else!

(separate commands are separated by a "-")

The answers:

"NE - N - Open oven - Get bread, jug and lantern - S - E - SE - NE - Drink
water - Get water - SW - SE - SW - SW - S - Read scroll - NE - NE - E - E
- Gnusto fweep - Memorize fweep - Fweep gate - E".

You are now in the castle.  When the program says that your throat is dry,
then drink water.  When it says that your stomach is grumbling, eat bread.

"Read book - Memorize frotz - Frotz lantern - S - S - E - S - Open door -
N - Read writing - Remove block - E - Get scroll - Read scroll - Gnusto
exex - W - S - U - Drop all - E - Get lighted portrait - Get scroll - W -
Get all - Read scroll - Gnusto ozmoo - N - N - E - Memorize ozmoo - E -
Ozmoo me" (wait two turns, ie.  Take inventory twice) "D - Open south
door - S - Get all - N - W - W - S - Cut rope with dagger - Open box - Get
scroll - Read scroll - Melbor me - S - W - U - Sit on bed - Sleep"

When you sleep, you will have a dream about the bed you are sleeping on.
All dreams are hints!  Also, from now on, anytime the program tells you
that you are tired, then sleep (yes, right on the floor!) the reason you
have to sleep on the bed is so you can have this certain dream.  Now, on
with the adventure.

"Stand up - Examine bedpost - Push button - Get scroll - Read scroll -
Gnusto vaxum - D - E - E - E - S - SE - Memorize nitfol - Nitfol turtle -
Memorize exex - Exex turtle - Turtle, follow me - NW - N - E - U - Turtle,

Examine ashes - Follow track - Reach in hole - Read scroll - N - Memorize

- W - W - U - Get egg - Memorize fweep - Fweep egg - Drop egg - Get scroll
- Read shredded scroll - Krebf shredded scroll - D - Memorize vaxum - E".

You will now be in one of four mirror rooms.  Wait in any one until you
see an adventurer from Zork 1 on the other side of the mirror.  When you
see him "Zifmia adventurer - Vaxum adventurer - Show dagger to
adventurer".

(Go east until you get to a room with monsters guarding a door)

"Point at door - N - Drop all but bread, jug and lantern - Get map and
pencil - S - Close door - W - W - W - W - W - W - S - S - W - W - W - NW
- NE - Fill jug - SW - SE - E - E - E - S - S - E - S - D".

This is the second to last part of the adventure.  At this point you are
in a very weird kind of room!  Remember the map you picked up?  Read it
now.  The map is the map to the translucent corridors.  If you connect
two of the letters (ie. "connect b and j") then you will actually make
a corridor!  Now, what you are going to do is release ultimate evil from
it`s lair and erase certain so you trap him in another part of the
translucent corridors.  You want to do this because the scroll that you
need to kill Krill with, is in his lair!  This is how you do it:

"S - E - NE - SE - Connect F and P - SW - SW - Get scroll - Erase B and R
- Erase V and M - NE - NW - NW - Connect C and J - W - Read powerful
scroll - U - U - E - E - N - N - N - N - N - E - open door - N - Drop map
and pencil - Get all but map and pencil - S - W - S - S - E - E".

Now try going up the stairs.  You can climb them but you can't reach the
top! this stairway is the last puzzle you need to solve before you kill
Krill.

"Memorize vaxum - Kulcad stair - Read ornate scroll - Izyuk me - E -
Gondar dragon - Vaxum being - Guncho krill"

                      F / A - 1 8   I N T E R C E P T O R

                                     Hints

HAD ANY PROBLEMS LANDING ON THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER: The best way that I
found is to fly over the carrier and look down at the carrier to see which
way you have to turn around to land. It seems like I always come in from
the south of the carrier.  On your final approach to the aircraft carrier,
Have your arrestor hook down, reduce thrust to 50 percent, landing gears
down, and turn on your brakes in this order before you land.  When you hit
the runway, hit the F1 key to reduce your thrust to 10 percent.  It will
stop faster. After the plane stops hit F1 again to turn thrust off.

THE OTHER PROBLEM I HAD AT FIRST, WAS TO DROP THE RESCUE POD CLOSE ENOUGH
TO THE DOWNED PILOT: To get this one, I had to fly low to the water. About
100 feet or less above the water.  When you get close enough to the pilot,
change your radar range to 2 miles and you will soon see the dot on the
radar when you are in the 2 mile range of the pilot.  The little dot
shaped plane reach almost all the way over the dot of the pilot, That is
when you eject the rescue pod.

HOW TO PASS OR FINISH THE SIXTH MISSION: I tried playing it different ways
and still could not figure it out.  So I called Electronic Arts to find
the answer.  Here is how to pass it.  You fly to the sub-carrier under 100
feet above water.  Do not engage enemy planes at this time, just keep
going with your AFTERBURNERS turned on.  It is best to have your thrust
100 percent, plus you hit F10 again to turn on the AFTERBURNERS to fly
faster. You will be pressing for time at this point.  Before you reach the
sub-carrier, activate your AMRAAM missile.  You will have to use AMRAAM
missile only. Sidewinders will not work to complete this mission. When you
reach the sub, go up to 500-1000 feet in the air.  You have to hit the
CONING TOWER on the sub-carrier with AMRAAM missiles.  This is some what
tricky to do. When you see smoke coming from the CONING TOWER, then you
got it at this point.  If it hits a different part of the sub, and you see
smoke; You still cannot finish the mission unless you hit the tower.  I
have tried other ways and still could not finish the mission.  After you
hit the tower, you engage and terminate the enemy planes.  Land on your
aircraft carrier to refuel and rearm your F/A-18.  Takeoff and head back
to the sub-carrier and you should see 1 or 2 more enemy planes, engage and
destroy them. Then head home to your carrier and land.  Your mission
should be completed then. If you do anything different then what I told
you for mission #6, then it may not work.

                                   Hints

                               HIGH DIVING

If you don't want to be flat and miss the water with a splat just keep
auto-fire on all the way down.  Just push in the direction you want and
Fiendish Freddy won't bother you with his fan at all.  Use the overhead
picture in the bottom left-hand corner and just keep the cross in the
middle.  Then you just do the same for all four boards you jump from and
Freddy won't make a blind bit of difference to your score, (if you want a
good score, land in the water and keep moving from left to right as fast
as possible).


                                 JUGGLING

If on the first level you don't drop anything then Fiendish Freddy won't
lob your death warrant to you in the shape of a bomb or nuclear missile.
If you do drop something and a bomb comes on just push up and fire and
Fiendish Freddy will be shaken.  On the next round a baby will join in the
fun as it needs to be juggled alongside the balls, all you need to do is
get in the pram.  Drop five items and you will have a very sore neck.


                                 TRAPEZE

Looks easy but it can be very hard if you make a bodge of it early on in
the swing.  If you want to keep going swing left to right all the time.
Be quick otherwise Fiendish Freddy will snip you to your doom.  Leave the
swing an extra turn if you're not sure but don't chicken out too many
times as time is against you.  Leave the swing for about four seconds
before you let go at the beginning.  Hoops are no problem: just wait until
you see the rope on the other side and then pretend they weren't there.
Make sure you are swinging upwards when you press fire to let go otherwise
you die.


                            TIGHTROPE WALKING

Make sure you're moving fast otherwise a cannon will make mince-meat out
of you.  On the second level start moving out as soon as the screen
appears.  If you don't, Freddy will punch you out of the tent, he's that
quick!  You just need to press fire once in the second level to block the
razor blade he throws at you.  In the last level you just need to move
across as normal and press fire when Freddy uses the razor blades again.
Timing is all important on the third level.  Look at the top left-hand
corner and use that view to guide you.


                              KNIFE THROWING

As soon as you see the screen just move to the outside of the circle and
fire when the balloons reach the point marked on the illustration.

                               |
                               .
                             .   .        <-- This is a circle.
                           .       .          @=where you press fire.
                        -. @   .     .-
                           .       .      The balloon will then burst if
                             .   .        you have press fire at the
                               .          correct point.
                               |

The rest is easy, just do that and you will complete the level easily and
rack up all the important money to save the Big Top!

                                   Cheat

Here's a way of starting the game with loads of money!

Copy the game onto another disk, files are going to be changed so don't use
the original.  Boot up the copy as normal, clicking on the 'FD II' and
'BOOT.BAS' icons as they appear.  Enter the game as normal.  When it's up
and running, select the 'QUIT' option from the Main selection of the pull
down menu.  A CLI window now appears. Type LIST to list the 'FOOT.BAS' part
of the game.

Using the cursor keys, edit the program lines 1514 and 2547 to read as
follows :

1514 NEXT
NW=150+INT(RND*200)
NW=INT(NW/AP)
NV=200+INT(RND*300)
NV=INT(NV/AP)
AI=5000000pound sign+INT(RND*(500000pound sign/AP))
NF=(5000+INT(RND*3000))/AP
NP=INT(NP+NA+NF)
GOTO 332

2547 GOSUB 2548
IF RA=9 AND AI>300000pound sign OR AI>1500000pound sign THEN ]2547
GOTO 2548
]2547: RA=INT(AI/5000)
PRINT TAB(5);
PA5
PRINT "DIRECTORS WITHDRAW";
PA1
PRINT TAB(30);
MONEY INT(RA)
PRINT TAB(38);"-"
JR=JR-RA

In line 1514 making AI equal 5,000,000 provides $5M starting budget; this
can be changed to suit, however Line 2547 making RA=INT(AI/5000) stops the
directors from withdrawing too much cash every week.  Click on the 'close
window' icon for the window containing the program text, and save the
amended program file by typing SAVE "FOOT.BAS"

To run the amended disk, boot up the disk as normal, by clicking on the FD
II icon.  When the BOOT.BAS icon is clicked the message BAD FILE MODE
appears.  Accept this by using the OK box.  Close the CLI window containing
the few lines of text, by clicking on the close window icon.

Type 'LOAD'.  A message box appears prompting for the 'NAME OF PROGRAM TO
LOAD:'  Using the left hand mouse button click on the text bar and type
'FOOT.BAS'.

When the OK message appears, type 'RUN'.  The program should now start as
normal with plenty of dosh to spend.

                                   Hints

Never ever attempt to go into the sewers without the torch.

To get lots of points do any of the following: Go to the Pizza Party (a
building without a sign on it).  Waggle your joystick left and right to
eat pizzas.  When you get splatted by a pie you'll fall down a hole to the
sewers.  If you've eaten a lot you'll see a pizza monster!

and) Take the golf ball from the shed to the golf course (the scene before
the busty lady picture).  Kick it to try for a hole in one.  If you miss
you'll find the ball near the busty lady.

and) Jump on the settee and kick it.  You'll then see that it's ripped.

and) Pick up the anissed balls for invincibility (as long as you carry
them).

and) If Odie picks up the aniseed balls he'll not pinch any of your items.


                                 Solution

As soon as you start, it's best to pick up the rubber bone and drop it
next to the door with the catflap (left from where you start).  Wait near
the door and, providing he's carrying something already, Odie will bounce
up to the door and open the catflap. This gives you quicker access to the
"world outside".

Now get the torch from the bedroom. Go to the sewers (you can enter them
by going to the shed or the park where a busty lady sits).  Find Nermel,
the kitten, and keep kicking him until he drops a clockwork mouse.  Let
Odie pick up the mouse and make your way back to the top.

Swap Odie, the torch for the mouse and go to the health food shop.  The
woman's head will spin around and she'll give you a green doughnut.  Swap
Odie the torch for the doughnut.

Head back to the sewers.  When you see a large rat near a chest, get the
doughnut back from Odie.  Drop the doughnut and the rat will clear off and
eat it.  Kick the chest and a key will appear.  Then give Odie the key and
make your way back to the top (WITH the torch).

Now get the bucket from the back garden.  Take it to the hardware shop and
drop it.  A dollar note will float down.  Pick this up and go to the
health food shop.  Select 'USE' with your joystick and a pile of birdseed
will appear.  Pick this up.

Go once again to the park where the lady sits.  Drop the birdseed and
quickly pick up the key.  A bird will swoop down and take you to the City
Pound.  Go right, up the alley and right again.  You'll now find Arlene!
She'll give you a smacker on the lips, the screen will fill with flowers
and you'll go off together arm in arm!

                                   Hints

Give more power to the forehand, backhand etc And a little bit less for the
smash and the service. But be sure to keep a good stamina.

The training mode is a good way to increase your power.  Try it for a long
time and your player will get better and better.

When you play your first matches against the computer, you will probably
lose 6-0  6-0  6-0...  But don't desesperate, always try to send your balls
from left to right and left and again and when you see that the computer
have some problems, run to the volley and destroy him.

In tournament mode, it is better to save at the end of each match.  It is
also better to start with the small competitions.

Jake masters (JM) goes to town.  His first trip leads to the pub.  After a

In a talk he manages to persuade the Chinese Chi to get with him on a
rescue-trip (1 3 3 or 3 3 2).  Chi prefares going by plane.  So JM leaves
the pub, takes the paper and constructs a little plane out of it, that he
presents Chi.  Chi has the idea to get herbs at the chemist's shop.  Wu
doesn't react when JM talks to him.  Chi manages to persuade the chemist.
The chemist needs "gull-guano".  JM and Chi go to the dock.  Chi gives a
prune to the gull.  The gull shits and JM puts the shit into his pocket.

rope.  After several useless tries he gives the rope to Chi which has
less problems.  With the caught cow the both go to the castle.  There
they watch a farmer which is allowed to enter the castle with his cow.
Of course, Chi tries the same trick.  JM gives him the anchor that Chi
connects with the rope.  Arrived inside, Chi puts on his ninja-clothes at
once.  At first he explores the door-keeper's home and takes the keys.
Then Chi sneaks into the palace and listens to a talk Li Deng's.  In the
big hall he finds Kate and tells her to get help as fast as possible.

there he gets the knife.  He opens the door and discovers a second entry
to the big hall.  After exploring the palace Chi walks to the castle-wall.
He throws the anchor over the wall and pulls JM over it.  To hide from
the guardians, the both sneak back into the door-keeper's home.  When the
danger is over, the both run into the palace.  When the guardians have
left the room, JM and Chi go into the dining-room.  There JM throws down
the lamp and lights a fire.  Through kitchen and bedroom they arrive in
the big hall.  JM locks the door and shots the snakes.  Unfortunately he
can't stop the snakes before biting kate.  JM carries kate on his arms and
escapes to the balcony.  There Chi connects the rope with the balustrade
and the three escape to the tank-garage.  In the tank JM uses the key and
pushes the starter.  It follows the first action- sequence.  In the plane
JM gives the herbs to Chi.


                                 KATHMANDU

JM leaves the plane and talks to Chi about the situation.  JM goes getting
help, Chi walks back to the plane.  There he takes a tent-roof and a
blanket and puts it around Kate.  He gives her his Ninja-medicine and the
guano-herbs.  JM talks to Ama (2 2 3) and after that he looks around in
the village.  In the post-office he posts a telegram to Lomax.  Then he
visits the restaurant and talks to the keeper (2 3).  The keeper sends him
to Sardar (2). now JM goes to the Lama.  After a short talk to a young
monk he is allowed to enter.  The first talk to the wise man is
resultless.  JM goes to the local dictator.  After a wrong remark he flies
into the prison.  Chi runs to ama and she rescues JM.  JM has a short talk
to Kate and after that he has a trip to the scrap yard where he meets a
boy.  The boy offers after a short talk a tube which is full of petrol for
a swap.  Chi builds from the cigar-box, the eating-sticks and four coins
a play-car; for this he gets the petrol-tube.  Now he goes back to the
lama and receives some news.  In the restaurant he manages to persuade
sardar to help (1 3).  JM gives hin his weapon as a present and the
revolution starts.  The game continues in turkey.


                                  ISTANBUL

On the runway JM gets no petrol from the seller.  On the way to town Kate
and JM notice a little boy selling oranges.  JM finds in a side-road the
officers' club and has from there a little call to Lomax after that Jake
is caught from the Sultan's crew.  Kate swaps her brooch at the seller and
gambles for more money.  After that she she goes to the orange-seller and
overthrows his cart.  She says sorry and gets a flower from her young fan.
Now she buys a Camel for 200.  She goes back to the shop and buys a saw.
Now she rides on Camel-back to the palace.  In a side-road she meets a
woman a gives her the flower.  Kate rescues JM and they escape to the
town-gate.  There Kate gives the Camel to the boy and JM whispers some
words of excusing (3 2).  Arrived at the airport they see their plane
bursting into flames.  They escape to the station and buy a ticket for the
Orient-express.

2. On early levels practise using the lemmings` special abilities.  Try
completing level one without Climbers and level two without Floaters.

3. On Blizzard level two, you will need to use the Digger/Builder method to
block off the lemmings.

4. On level 14 (Blizzard) the exit is hidden under snow in the steel boxes
in the bottom left-hand corner!  Use Miners and Bashers to get there.

                                  Solution

                                  PART ONE

You're at the pirate's square - Go down muggers alley - Go to dr chop (a
bit to the right!)- take rollerblinder off the window - Ask Dr.Chop how to
get clothes (hat, pants etc) - Ask Dr.Chop how I earn some extra money.
Let Dr.Chop take 2 teeth off you (do it again!) - Check the map before you

rope with anchor - Go to crossed swords - Take cups - Go out of there - Go
to bait and tackle - Take cup - Go upstairs and out.

Now you're at the balcony, overseeing pirate's square.  This is the tricky
part in Hook, you have to syncronize this otherwise it is made in vain.
You have to use the anchor tied to the rope at the very top of the clock
while at the same time you're in momentum of swinging yourself to the
other balcony you have to take the pirate's hat, tricky indeed.  Now you
use the door, the you'd better fucking hurry back to behind pirate's
sqaure, swinging yourself back, out of bait and tackle and back to
pirate's square and then to behind pirate's square.  This has to be made
really fast otherwize Mrs Smeedle's will make your day.  At behind
pirate's square you take the jacket using the washing pole.  Hope you made
it fast enough otherwize you have to do it again.

Examine jacket - Go back to pirate's square - Go to muggers alley - Go to
Jolly Roger's place - Go and talk to fake Jake (the man that sits nearest
the bar!) - Ask fake Jake if he needs a drink - Give the bartender the 3
mugs (again and again!) - Give the bartender the 3 coins (again and
again!) - give Jake Jake the 3 mugs filled with cocoa - Take Fake Jake's
pants - Go out to muggers alley - Go to pirate's square - Go to behind
pirate's square - Use rollerblinder - Go to pirate's square - Go to
muggers alley - Go to Good form pier - Go to the ship - Go to the right
and take the coins that are in the pots - Go back to Good form pier and
muggers alley, pirate's square - Go to ye' pirate's tailor - Ask the
tailor for any metal detectors, then give the money to her - Go out to
pirate's square - Go to muggers alley - Go to Good form beach - Use magnet
on "x" on the beach - Go back to muggers alley - Go to Good form pier - Go
to ship - Go to the left of the ship.


                                  PART TWO

You're at the bottom of the sea - Examine the steelpiece - Examine the big
shell - Use washing line pole with the ropes - Use the big shell - You're
now at the lookout-point - Go right into neverforest - now you're into
neverforest, just follow the signs if you're lost it will help you a lot
here (though they are not to be trusted fully!) - Here's at how
I made it;

Go right - Go right - Go right - Go up - Go right - Go up - Go left - Go
left - Go left - Go left - Go up - Go right - Go right - Now you've made
it (by being trapped!) - Go into the tree.


                                 PART THREE

Now you're at the Lost Boy's dining area - Go to the round pond and talk

round pond - Give flower to tingeling - Take branch from the tree - Go to
the dining area - Go to the slingshot - Use the piece of strong elastic
with slingshot - Use the branch with the string - Go to the dining area -
Go to the lost boy's workshop - Use bow with panpipes - Take panpipes - Go
to dining area - Go to slingshot - Go to cliffside (upper) - Use yourself
with the far corner of the fence - Go back and do this thrice - Then ask
Thudbutt what he thought about that - Go back to slingshot and use
slingshot with yourself - Ask Thudbutt what his happy thought's are - Go
to slingshot - Go to dining area - Talk to rufio - Say to Rufio "Oh
Rufio!" - Go to round pond and walk to the middle of the screen - Now
you're inside Nevertree - Talk to Tingeling - Examine the brown pile in
the middle - Examine the chair to the right - Examine fireplace - Now
wait and watch the movie.


                                 PART FOUR

Now you're into the war with Hook, you're now fully Peter Pan - Back at
Hook's ship, this part is exactly the same idea as Monkey Island, slagging
the more, the more you gain - This is how I did it;

Tell Hook "Peter Pan the avenger!" - Tell Hook "Good form James" - Tell
Hook "tick tock tick hook's afraid of dead old croc!" - Tell Hook "You
kidnapped my kids Hook, you deserve to die!" - Tell Hook "Put up your
swords, it's Hook or me this time!" - Tell Hook "Peter Pan the Avenger!"

Now you've made it! just watch the credits and have fun!

                                   Hints

Don't despair - all puzzles, traps and monsters are survivable, even if some
are a bit tough at first!!

LEVEL 1: In the long room with headless lady ghosts, push joystick up to
enter a secret camber behind a certain painting

Level 2: Outside the main doors of the manor move right to find a green key
in the gaveyard, guarded by invulnerable Horror Zombies!  To get past
thesemonsters you must find and use the potion witch is located on the
right-hand edge of the roof.  The green key needed to trigger a magic cloud,
enabling you to get past the broken drainpipe.  Jump ON the flag

Level 3: Use Crawl to move undertected beneath some Vampires (Useful for
avoiding skeleton's arrows too!).  Sorry! the only way out of dead end
chambers is to commit suicide.

Level 4: You need to puch a teble from a room at the top of the first ladder
encountered and jump down immediately after it.  Puch the table left and use
it to get the green key past the headless lady.

Level 5: When you first get out onto the Chapel roof(through the door at the
base of the large creeper), move left (avoiding vampires) and shoot the
monks, retrieve green key, and continue left.  Push the joystick forward
five spikes in from the next room and you'll move into a secret area to
retieve an extra life.

There are three chests in the Chapel tower.  Only one of these activates the
magic cloud - it is the one in the lower right corner.

Level 6: Sorry folks! You're on your own on this level.

                                   Hints

The left and right cursor keys will USUALLY switch from man to man.
Sometimes it purposely won't let you switch though.  But here's sort of
what you have to do on the first level.  Switch to the guy on the tall
grass platform and have him pick up the rope.  Have him drop the rope over
the edge and switch to the guy stuck at the bottom and have him climb the
rope.  Have the rope-dude drop the rope off the other edge and let the guy
climb down.  Now your gonna need to kill the rope-holder, so have him take
a leap of death off of the platform.  When he's replaced, have that guy
pick up the rope.  Now have the guy at the top pick up the torch and take
it down to the pit and throw it across.  Have the guy not holding the rope
pick up the torch and burn the bush.  Now have the rope holder drop the
rope down into the pit and have ONE of the guys on the right fall into the
pit and climb up the rope.  Now have the rope holder throw the rope accross
the pit and have the guy pick it up, climb the ladder and walk accross the
bridge.  Now get on the edge of the bridge (since it has fallen) and drop
the rope all the way down.  Have the three guys climb up the rope.  Now all
five guys are by the wheel.  What you have to do is get one of them under
the levels and have him hold his hands up (push joystick up I think).  Now
switch to another guy and have him climb up the man holding his hands up.
Keep doing this until one of the guys is able to walk accross one of the
levels.  Then get the guys down before the bottom guy gets squished and
they fall.  Have the guy touch the wheel and that's the end of the level.
Now he reads a magazine in front of a fire and there's no way out.  I've
tried every key and it won't move on to the next level.

                                   Hints

Mission one on level one is set in Colorado.  This mission will give you a
good idea of the way the enemy is going to come at you in the future.
It's a good practise stage, but if you want to progress through the game
quickly your best bet is to skip it completely.

Money is an important commodity which can be gained by collecting the bags
which hang from the balloons.  Your best bet is to use your boost and pull
back straight causing your boat to glide into the air.  Do not push
forward on the stick as this will cause your flight to be prematurely
terminated.

In the Hoverdrome you will be able to get your grubby mits on a load of
useful items.  Guide your boat through the hoops to get some lovely money,
and zoom through the nets to obtain fuel.  If you make a mess of one of
the jumps, and crash, the bonus stage will come to an abrupt end.

Collecting either the green or blue globes will bump up your fuel supply
allowing you to complete the section more easily.   The green ones will
appear throughout the game, but the blue ones only turn up in later
levels!

The yellow globes are a rare commodity which will provide you with extra
turbo boosts.  You're going to have to keep your eyes peeled because they
don't appear very often!

Try to save the boost for the end of the level just in case you run out of
fuel.  All being well it should push you past the necessary boundary to
start the next level.

At Lake Huron you will find loads of pink boats, which when shot will drop
green fuel globes.  Watch out though, 'cause there are lots of mines
bobbing about in the water.

The final mission will take you across the world, to Libya.  Your mission
here is to transport a doomsday device, and make sure that it does not
fall into the wrong hands.

A man drops from an helicopter and attempts to beat you over the head with
a big stick.  How do you shake him off?  Well, your best bet is to do a
big boost up jump and hope that he falls off.  Failing this, you may find
that simply crashing your boat is the easiest way of getting rid of him.

In the Pacific there will be literally hundreds of boats for you to
contend with, and all of them seem to have particularly nasty intentions!
If you actually manage to get past this section though, you will be
treated with a bit of surprise - meet the Shadow face to face as you
holiday together on a peaceful island!


                          STRATEGIC SUGGESTIONS

- Fuel is the most valuable commodity - make sure you keep replenishing
supplies.
- You can cycle through the special weapons.
- Save a boost for the end of the level if you can.
- If your fuel is low us the turbo boosts mid-level.  Flying doesn't use
up fuel.
- Shoot up as many pink boats as you possibly can.
- Get as many globes as you possibly can throughout the game.

                     in the Land of the Fallen Sabrina

                                  Solution

At first you're in John's computer room.  LOOK around in this room and
view the monitor.  Don't answer the phone, your pal won't stop talking.
Try not to be killed by yar parents (Fresh sharpened knife).  Search for a
parachute to which is in the drawer.  LOOK window and GET fly, don't look
at it first, coz your sight will kill the fly.  WEAR the parachute and
jump out.  Give money to the most beautiful gal ya've ever seen who is
standing downstairs.  You get a picture of her sister(nice piccy Dave,yar
girlfriend?)  Afterwards move towards the beautifarm...

Give the photo which ya became from the pretty girl to the nice chick who
is blocking yar way.  Then enjoy yar self inside from a terrific slide
show.  Leave the farm and go to the supermarket.  TAKE the green persil
whilst there is no "new dobbelman" with activas in it.  Try to screw the
cassiere.  As a reward you get a screw driver from her.  Walk into the
bathroom and WASH YOURSELF.

Since you are little go to your computer room.  OPEN your Amiga 2000 with
the 8MB memory.  Then type N.  LOOK GIRL, for a better view.  TALK girl
and type N again.  And her she is - Sabrina!  WOW TALK to her.  Then GIVE
FLY and let the slide begin.

                                  Solution

Due to this game`s linear structure and the fact that you usually can`t
return to a location, maps are not available with this solution.  There
are 3 random elements: the colour of the residue left by spells, the cave
numbers assigned to the runes in the magic mill and the name of a
character.
