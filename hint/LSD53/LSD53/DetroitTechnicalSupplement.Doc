Installation and Loading
------------------------

DETROIT  must  be  installed to a hard drive in order to run.  It cannot be
played  directly  from  the  game diskettes.  When installed, the game will
occupy approximately 5 megabytes of hard disk space.

Hard Drive Installation

Before starting to install the game, make sure that your computer is turned
on  and  that  the  MS-DOS  prompt is showing.  The prompt should look like
this:   C:\> (the letter may be different if you are in a different drive.)
Exit  completely  out  of  any other programs you may have running, such as
Windows or Dosshell.

Insert Disk #1 into your floppy drive and change to that drive.  Do this by
typing  the  letter  designation of your floppy drive, followed by a colon,
followed  by  Enter.   For example, if your floppy drive is your "A" drive,
you would type:  A:, then press the <ENTER> key.

Type  INSTALL  at  the  floppy  drive  prompt  and press <Enter>.  Detailed
directions  for  installing  the  game  software will appear on the screen.
When  you  have  finished  reading them, press <Enter> to continue with the
installation.   At  any  time  during the process you may press <Escape> to
abort the installation.

You  will  first  be asked for the letter of the source drive.  Type in the
letter  of  the floppy drive that contains the game disk and press <Enter>.
Next,  type  in the letter of your hard drive where you want the game files
installed  and  press  <Enter>.   You  will then be asked for the name of a
subdirectory  which  the  DETROIT  installation program will create for the
game  files.  The default subdirectory name is DETROIT.  If you wish to use
the  default, simply press <Enter>.  If you would rather supply a different
sub  directory  name,  backspace  through  the default and type in your new
name, then press <Enter>.

The  game  will  ask  you to confirm that the settings are correct.  If you
wish to change anything, abort out of the installation by pressing <Escape>
and  begin again.  When you are satisfied with the settings, press <Enter>.
The  game  will  ask  you  to  confirm  that you wish the game subdirectory
created.   Enter  Y  to  create  the  game  directory  or  N  to  abort the
installation.

Make  sure  that  game  disk #1 is in the correct drive, and press <Enter>.
The  program  will start to install the game files.  Switch to disk #2 when
prompted by the computer.  When the installation process is complete, press
any  key  to  return  to  the  MS-DOS  prompt (you will be left in the game
subdirectory).

Loading the Game

To  start DETROIT, change to the game directory by typing:  CD\DETROIT (or,
if  you did not use the default name, substitute your own subdirectory name
for  "DETROIT").  At the prompt, type DETROIT and press <Enter>.  The first
time  you  run the game, you will need to set the sound and printer options
(see below.)

Important  Note:  If you usually run an operating system such as Windows on
your  PC,  be  sure to exit all the way out to DOS before starting DETROIT.
This  will  end  your Windows session.  Shelling out instead of exiting the
program will cause DETROIT to malfunction.

Setting the Sound Card Options

The  first time you play DETROIT, you will be asked to specify the settings
for  your  computer's  sound  card  and  printer.   A Setup menu with seven
options will appear.

To set your sound card, select the first option, and then choose your sound
card  or  a compatible entry from the new list.  If you do not have a sound
card,  choose  option zero, "No Sound", from the sound card menu.  You will
be  returned  to  the  main menu after you make your choice.  Set the sound
card port, IRQ Interrupt and DMA Control Channel settings the same way.

Use  options  five  and  six  on the main menu to set your printer type and
printer  port,  then  select  option seven to save your changes.  The sound
setup  screen  will  exit  and the game itself will load.  The setup screen
will  appear only the first time the game is played.  If you need to change
your  sound  card  or  printer settings after they have been set, go to the
game  directory  and  type  SETUP  at the prompt.  Follow the directions as
above to save your new settings.

QUICK START TUTORIAL
--------------------
 
This  tutorial  is  meant  for  the player who wants to get started playing
DETROIT  right  away.   If  you  follow  it  step by step, it will take you
through  the  first month of a typical game and show you how to control all
of the major elements you`ll need to get your business going.  Once you 're
familiar with the basics, you`ll probably want to consult the manual to get
all the details and learn about those features not covered here.

Precise  numbers  to use for various aspects of the game (worker wages, car
prices,  and so on) have been deliberately left out of this tutorial.  Many
players prefer to discover the best numbers to use through trial and error.
If  you  would  like  to  have  some numbers to ensure that you will make a
profit  in  the  early  stages  of  the  game, please see the card included
elsewhere in the game package.

This  tutorial  assumes  that you are playing DETROIT with a mouse.  If not
please see the Keyboard Command Card included in the game materials for the
keyboard  equivalents  of  the  Mouse  commands.  When the tutorial says to
click  on  a  command  use  the  left  mouse button unless the instructions
specifically  say  otherwise.   Clicking  on  the  right  mouse button will
usually  allow  you  to  exit  the current screen or panel; use this if you
accidentally wind up somewhere you don`t want to be while you are following
this tutorial.

To exit the game completely at any time, hold down the ALT key and press X.
Click on Yes to confirm that you want to exit, and you will be taken out to
DOS.  Your game will not be saved

DETROIT  is  a  turn-based  game,  so  you don`t have to rush while working
through this tutorial.  Take your time.

Getting Started

Start DETROIT by following the instructions in the Installation and Loading
section  of  this  booklet.  You can click any mouse button to move through
the  title  screens  quickly,  if you wish.  You will see the Start Options
panel superimposed on the Main Factory Screen (which will be described in a
moment).  Click on the Start button.

The  Player  Setup  panel  will  appear.   It should show Player 1 as human
(thats  you,  we  hope) and Players 2 through 4 as the computer.  You don't
want to change this now, so just click on Done.

Next,  you  will  see  the  Territory Map with the sixteen game territories
shown in different colors.  (You may see some animation on this screen, and
on  most  of the other screens in the game.  Don't worry about it - nothing
is happening to your game.  It's just there for your amusement so relax and
enjoy  it.)  Put  the  mouse pointer on the Northeastern section of the USA
(which is brown) and click.

A keyboard input box will appear for you to enter the name of your company.
You  can  press  Enter to accept the default name ("Company 1") if you want
but   that's   pretty  dull,  so  we  suggest  you  choose  something  more
interesting.   The name can be up to fifteen characters and contain letters
or  numbers.   When  you  start typing, the default name will automatically
vanish and your new name will appear.  Press Enter when you've finished.

A similar panel will appear asking you to name your first car model.  Again
press  Enter  to  accept  the  default  or  just  start typing to give it a
different  name.  Press Enter when you're done, and the Main Factory Screen
will appear.

At  the start of the game, you have $60,000 in funds and one fully designed
and  tested  model  of  car  to  sell.   You begin with one factory in your
starting  territory  which  has  one  assembly line running, producing your
first  car model, and one sales office in your starting territory, which is
selling  it.   You  have  enough  assembly workers hired to man your single
assembly  line,  and a small number of research technicians on your payroll
waiting  to  be  assigned to development projects.  You will start out with
some initial numbers automatically assigned for workers, wages, prices, and
so  forth,  but  these numbers, while they may be reasonable values to use,
are not optimal.  You'll have to experiment (or refer to the enclosed card)
to determine which numbers are actually best.

Take a Look at Your Factory

The  Main  Factory  Screen is where you will access the various departments
that  make  up  your  company.  Most of the screen shows the factory itself
with  its  six  buildings.  Clockwise from the top right, they are:  Design
(light  blue),  Research  (pink), Sales/Factories (blue roof and skylight),
Administration  (gray),  Archives  (red  brick),  and Marketing (brown with
billboard) in the center.

At  the  bottom  of  the screen is the wooden Info Bar.  From the left, the
Info Bar shows:

. The current month and year of your game (it should say "Jan 1908")
. Your company's current funds ($60,000)
. The rectangular Message Box, which will often tell you useful things
. Your company name
. The six toolbar icons (see below)
. The Month End button (with the calendar grid pictured on it)

On  this  screen,  and on most of the other main screens in the game, there
are  mouse command buttons worked into the scenery itself.  The manual will
give  you  a  complete list of all the buttons on each screen and what they
do, but for this tutorial we`ll only be telling you about the ones you need
to  use  right  now.  You can tell when you've found a hidden button on the
screen  because  the  mouse  pointer  will change shape from a red "X" to a
green  arrowhead,  and  a  description  of  that  button will appear in the
Message Box on the Info Bar.

Design a New Car

Although  in  a  real game you won't want to start off by building new cars
right  away,  for  the purposes of teaching you the game, that`s where this
tutorial is going to start.

Move  the  mouse  pointer over the Design building, checking in the Message
Box to make sure you have the right building, and click.  The first page of
the  Design  Worksheet  will appear.  Your first car will be showing in the
display  box in the top center.  You can have up to sixteen current designs
at  one  time.   The black numbers in the upper right corner of the display
window  tell  you  which  design  you're currently looking at (right now it
should  say  "1/16",  since you are looking at your first (and only) stored
design out of the sixteen maximum you can save as current.)

The  other  areas  on this screen tell you some of the specifics of the car
you are currently looking at.  It has a four-cylinder 747 cc engine, a hand
brake, and not much else.  It's of the "family sedan" type.

To  start  a new car, click on the button marked New, located at the top of
the  column  to the left of the display window.  The display window will go
blank,  and  the top right corner of the display window will change to read
"New".   The  first  thing to do is to set a body type for your car.  There
are  four basic body types:  two-door, four-door, van, and truck.  Your new
car  will  be  a  two-door so click on the button marked Body until you see
"Body Style:  1" appear just below the display window.

Next,  click  on Type to select the functional type of car you're trying to
build.   The  type  indicator  is just below the button marked "Next." Keep
clicking  on  Type  to  cycle through types of cars you can build until you
come to Family Sedan, and stop.  Your new product will be a two-door family
sedan to go with your four-door family sedan.

Now,  you  need  to  design  the  body  of your new car.  Under the display
window,  find the three-letter list.  The first slot should be highlighted.
This  slot  controls the design of the front section of your car.  Click on
the  mouse  button marked with a Plus sign, and watch the car change.  (Use
the  Minus key to back up) Stop on the choice called Front 2.  Now click on
the second slot to highlight it, and use the Plus and Minus keys to look at
the options for the center of your car.  Select Middle 2.  In the same way,
highlight the third slot and set the back of the car to Rear 3.

To  move  to  the  second  page  of the design worksheet, click on the Part
button  (second  from the top in the column at the left side of the display
window).   On  this screen, you can see pictures of the internal components
of your car.  At the moment, you only have one model of engine and one type
of  brake  available  and  none  of  the  other  four systems that might be
included  (Suspension, Cooling, Safety Options, and Luxury Options.) Later,
if  you  invest in Research, you will have more to choose from, but for now
your new family sedan is going to have to have the same inteinal systems as
your  original family sedan.  Go to the box marked "Engine", and click once
on  the Plus button.  This will bring up a picture of your engine, a 747 cc
four-cylinder,  and  install it into your new design.  Go to the box marked
"Brakes"  and click once on the Plus button to add a hand brake to the car.
Then  click  on Body in the upper right-hand corner of the screen to return
to the first page of the design worksheet.

Your new family sedan is now ready to be tested.  Click on Make to instruct
your  technicians  to  build  a  prototype  car.  A keyboard input box will
appear.   Type  in the name of your new model of car and press Enter.  When
you  are  asked  to  confirm  the  building  of the car, click on Yes.  The
Testing Screen will appear.

Note:   If  you  want to make an alteration to a design that already exists
(don`t  do  this  now!) you can do so by bringing up the old design, making
the  changes,  and then clicking on Make.  When the keyboard input box with
the  name  of the original design appears, simply press Enter.  You will be
asked  to confirm that you want to replace the old design with the modified
design.   If you click on Yes, your old design will be removed and replaced
with the modified car.

Test Your New Car

Before putting your new car on the market, you'll want to have it tested to
see  how  well  it's made.  For simplicities sake you`re going to order the
full  range  of possible tests.  At the bottom of the column of readouts on
the  left  side of the screen, click on the button marked Test All.  Notice
on  the printout at the bottom right that the testing costs have been added
to the total.  Just above the printout click on the red button marked Run.

The  materials  and  testing costs will be immediately subtracted from your
company  funds,  and  the  viewscreen  at  the top right will show you what
happens  as your new car is put through its paces.  The Overall rating that
appears  near  the  bottom  of the left column of readouts is a number on a
scale of zero to one hundred.  The closer the number is to one hundred, the
better  the  car  performed.   When  the  tests are completed, click on the
Return to Factory box (the square at the far right end of the Info Bar that
has a silhouette of the factory pictured on it.)

Hire Some Workers

From  the  Factory  Screen,  click on the Administration building (gray, at
lower  left).   The Administration Office appears.  Move the pointer to the
door  on  the  far wall, check that the Message Box reads Personnel Office,
and  click.   The  Personnel Menu will appear.  There are two boxes on this
panel,  one  for Assembly Workers and one for Technicians.  You will notice
that  you  already  have  some of each type of worker on the payroll.  Your
technicians  are  listed  as  idle  because  you  haven't  assigned them to
projects yet (you'll do that in a moment.)

In  the Assembly Workers box, click on Hire.  A new kind of panel, called a
keyboard  input box, will appear.  this panel will have a text entry window
and  various  mouse  command  buttons  which will be different on different
keyboard  input  boxes.   Click on the Plus sign to add assembly workers to
your  payroll.   (You  can  hold  down the button to scroll the number more
quickly.)  Click  on  Done,  and  you will see the totals change.  Your new
assembly workers are on the payroll, but are still idle.

In  the  same  box, click on Wages.  Set the assembly workers' wages in the
same  way  that  you  set the number of workers.  Then click on Hire in the
Technicians  box and hire some technicians, and click on Wages to set their
pay.   Click  on the Done button in the upper right-hand corner to exit the
Personnel Menu and then click on the Return to Factory box.

Note:   In  addition  to  Factories  and Research Labs, you also have Sales
Offices  as part of your company (as you'll see in a moment.) However, your
Sales Offices are automatically staffed - you do not need to assign workers
to your Sales Offices.

Start a New Assembly Line

From  the  Main Factory Screen, click on the Sales/Factories building (blue
roof  with  skylight,  on  the lower right.) The Territory Map will appear.
You  will  see  a  light  blue  Sales  Office  building and a black Factory
building near the North eastern USA, your starting territory.  Click on the
Northeastern  USA  territory  to  bring up the Sales and Factories Menu for
that area.

Your  next  step  is  to  get your factory producing your new family sedan.
First,  you want to upgrade your factory's equipment so that it can produce
cars more efficiently.  In the Factory box, click on Raise.  This increases
the  level  of technology in use in your factory, at a cost which increases
at  the  level  of  your  factory  increases  this cost will be immediately
deducted from your funds when the factory is improved, so you will be asked
to confirm your expansion order.  Click on Yes, and your factory will go to
technology level two.

Next, in the Factory box, click on Detail.  A panel will appear showing you
the  five  assembly  lines  that  could run in that factory.  Line 1 should
already  show that you have a number of workers putting together your first
model  of  car.   Click  on Line 2 to highlight it, then click on Model.  A
lettered  list  will appear of all your sixteen current models of car (only
the  first  two  slots  will  have models in them at this point, of course,
because  you've only created two models.) Click on your new family sedan to
highlight  it, then click on Use.  Your new family sedan will be started on
that  line.   Click  on  Assign  to put workers on that line.  Use the Plus
button to put the idle workers you hired in Personnel to work building your
new  family  sedan.   Click  Done  when  you  finish.  Your car will now be
produced.

Sell Your New Car

In  the Sales Offices box on the Sales and Factories Menu, click on Detail.
A  lettered  list  will  appear,  showing you what cars are on sale at that
office and for what price.  A check mark by the name of the model indicates
that  it  is being offered for sale.  You will see that your original model
is  already  on sale for a certain price, and that your new family sedan is
on  the  list  but  not being sold (since the box is not checked.) To start
selling  your  new  design,  click  on the list to highlight the new family
sedan, then click on Price.  A keyboard input box will appear.

While  you  can  use the Plus and Minus buttons to set prices for your cars
(as  with  other  keyboard  input  boxes), you will probably find that it's
tedious  to wait for the numbers to scroll up to the right price.  Instead,
simply  type  in  the  number  and  press  Enter.  This alternate method of
entering  numbers  will  work  on all keyboard input boxes.  Set prices for
both  of  your  models, and click on Done when you finish.  Your new family
sedan  is  now  on  sale  in  the Northeastern USA, alongside your original
model.

Click  on  Supply  to  set  the supply lines so your dealers will have cars
delivered  to their showrooms.  A panel with a three-slot list will appear,
showing  where  the  cars  on sale at that location are being shipped from.
You  have  a  factory in the Northeastern USA, so the first supply line for
each model is automatically set so that cars come in from that area.  Since
the  supply  line is already set you don't need to change anything here, so
click on Done to get out of Supply and then click on Exit to get out of the
Sales Office Detail box.

Open a New Sales Office

Now  you're going to expand your operations a little by opening a new sales
office  in  a  different territory, one where you don't have a factory.  On
the  Sales  and  Factories Menu, click twice on Next.  This button, and the
Prev button, allow you to cycle through the sixteen territories in the game
(each  territory  has  a different menu.) You should now be at the menu for
the Southeastern USA territory.

In  the Sales Offices box, click on open.  Opening a new office costs money
so  you will be asked to confirm your decision.  Click on Yes, and the cost
will be automatically deducted from your company's funds.  Click on Detail.
You  will see that neither of your cars is being sold in the Southeast yet.
Highlight  your family sedan, and set the price the same way you did above.
Click  on  Supply and notice that you don't have any supply lines set up to
bring  your  cars  from the factory to the showroom.  the first slot on the
supply  list should already be highlighted.  Click on the Plus button.  "NE
USA"  should  appear  on  the list.  Your family sedans will now be shipped
from  your  factory  in  the  Northeastern  USA to your sales office in the
southeast.   Click  on  Done  to return to the Sales Detail Box.  Highlight
your  new family sedan, set the price, and start a supply line running from
your factory in the Northeastern USA just as you did for your family sedan.
Then click on Exit to get out of the Sales Office Detail Box.

Just to see a summary of your company's facilities, click on List.  A panel
will  appear  showing  you where you have sales offices and factories.  You
should see one sales office and a level two factory in the Northeastern USA
and  a  sales  office  in the Southeastern USA.  Click on Done to close the
panel,  and then on Done to close the main Sales and factories Menu.  Click
on the Return to Factory box to get back to the main screen.

Invest in Research

In  order  to  get  new  technology  for  your  cars, you need to invest in
research  and  development.   You  have  hired Technicians, but you need to
assign  them  to projects.  Move the mouse pointer to the Research building
(pink, lower right) and click.  The Research Screen will appear.

Put  the  mouse  pointer  over  the  technician at the bottom center of the
screen and click to bring up the Research Menu.  You will see a list of the
seven  automobile parts that go into making up your cars.  Click on Engines
to  highlight that component, then click on Assign.  Click on the Plus sign
to assign five technicians to do research on automobile engines, then click
on  Done.   In  the same way, highlight Brakes and assign five technicians,
then  do  the  same  thing with Suspension.  When you've finished, click on
Done  to  exit  the  Research Menu and then on the Return to Factory box to
return to the main screen.

Fire Some Workers

In  order  to  fire  some workers, you first have to take them off of their
current  assignments  so  that they become idle.  Click on Sales/Factories,
and then click on Northeastern USA to bring up the Sales and factories Menu
for  that territory.  In the factories box, click on Detail.  Click on Line
to  highlight  it,  then  click on Free.  A keyboard input box will appear.
Use the Plus button to enter the number five and press Enter.  You will see
that  the  number  of workers on the line decreases, and the number next to
"Idle  Workers"  goes  to  five.   Click  on Done to get out of the Factory
Detail  box,  then  Done  again to exit the Sales and Factories panel, then
click on the Return to Factory box.

From the Main Factory Screen, click on the Administration building.  In the
Administration  Office,  click  on  the  Personnel  door  to  bring  up the
Personnel  Menu.   In the Assembly Workers box on the Personnel Menu, click
on the button marked Fire.  A keyboard input box will appear.  Use the Plus
key to enter the number five in the box and press Enter.  You will see that
those  five  idle  workers have been taken off the payroll and added to the
Available Workers group.  Click on Done to exit the Personnel Menu and then
on the Return to Factory box to return to the main screen.

Advertise Your Wares

If  you want people to buy your cars, you have to advertise them.  From the
Main Factory Screen, click on Marketing (the brown building in the center.)
The  Marketing  Office screen will appear.  You will need to spend money on
marketing  separately  for each territory in which you have a sales office.
Money spent on advertising is subtracted from your company funds at the end
of each month.

Move  the  mouse pointer over the billboard with the car on it (outside the
window)  and  click.  You can now use the keyboard input box to spend money
on  billboard  advertisements.   Click on Prev or Next to cycle through the
territories until NE USA is showing.  Click on the Plus sign to spend money
on  billboards  (the  cost  will  go  up by preset amounts for each type of
advertising)  Click  on Next until you find the panel for SE USA, and again
click  on  the Plus sign, then click on Done.  You are now advertising your
cars on billboards across the entire Eastern United States.

Move  the  mouse  pointer over the papers on the desk and click.  From this
panel  you can spend money to advertise in newspapers and magazines.  Again
there  is  a  separate  panel  for  each  territory.  Use the Next and Prev
buttons  to  locate  the  Northeastern  USA panel.  The slot for Newspapers
should  already  be  highlighted.   Click  on the Plus button to spend some
money  on  newspaper  ads.   Click on Business to highlight that line, then
click  on the Plus button again to spend some money advertising in business
magazines.   Change  to  the panel for the Southeastern USA, spend money on
newspapers and business magazines in that territory the same way you did in
the  Northeast,  then click on Done.  Click on the Return to factory box to
get back to the main screen.

End Your Turn

Now  you  are  ready  to  end  the  month  and  see  how well your business
strategies  have  done  for  your company.  Click on the Month End box (the
square  at the right end of the Info Bar with the calendar grid on it.) The
Month  End  summary  panel will appear.  Each of the actions you have taken
within  the  past month will have a red check mark by it.  Actions you have
not  taken  will not be marked.  Since you have done everything you need to
this  month,  click  on Yes to confirm that you want to end the month.  (If
you  click  on  No  you will be returned to the Main Factory Screen to take
more actions.)

The  screen  will  dim briefly to show time passing.  Depending on how well
you  did  in  the  first month, you may see a Newsflash - a panel showing a
newspaper  and  giving  you some additional information.  To continue after
you've read the Newsflash, click any mouse button.  If you do not receive a
Newsflash, you will go directly to your Profit/Loss statement (see below.)

Check Your Progress

At  the  start of every new month, you will be presented with your companys
Profit/Loss  statement - the most basic indicator of your company's health.
The  first  column  details  your expenses for the current month, while the
second details your income.  The total profit or loss for the month appears
at the bottom of the left column.

Initially,  the  right column shows you your Income by Territory.  Move the
mouse  pointer  over  the  column  heading that says Income and click.  The
column  will then display your Income by Model instead.  Click again on the
column heading to return to income by territory.

When  you  are done examining your balance sheet, click on the Close Report
box  (the  square now appearing at the right end of the Info Bar, showing a
stack  of  papers  with  a  left-pointing red arrow superimposed.) You will
return to the Main Factory Screen to start your second turn.

Keep an Eye on the Competition

A  useful thing to do at the start of each new turn is to check on how your
competitors are doing.  Find the Administration building again and click on
it.   When  the  Administration Office appears, move the mouse pointer over
the  papers  spread  out on the desk in the lower center of the screen, and
click.   The  Reports and Graphs Menu will appear.  The fourth selection in
the  first  column says Compare.  Click on this button to bring up a report
on your competitors profits and losses for the month.  Your company appears
at  the top with your three rivals below.  If you have done better than all
or  most  of  the competition you are off to a good start.  If not, you may
need to restructure your company.

When you are done reading the Competition Report, click on the Close Report
box  to  return you to the Reports and Graphs Menu.  Click on Done to close
the menu and return you to the Administration Office screen.

MANUAL NOTES AND NEW FEATURES
-----------------------------

Notes

Firing  Workers:   In  order  to  fire workers, you need to first make them
Idle.   Do  this by using the Free buttons on the Research Menu and Factory
Detail  screens  to  remove workers from their current research projects or
assembly  lines.   Then go to the Personnel Menu and use the Fire button to
lay them off.

Car  Color:   On  the  first  page  of  the  Design  worksheet in the upper
right-hand  corner,  is  a  color grid.  Use the greater-than and less-than
arrows  under  the  grid to cycle through the colors until you find one you
like  for  your  car.   The  color  of the car has no effect on how well it
sells.

Design Worksheet:  The layout of the buttons and displays on the first page
of  the  Design  worksheet  have  been  altered  from that described in the
manual.  No buttons have been removed or added.

Model  Price:   The  Model Price button in the Sales Office Detail keyboard
input  box  no  longer  changes  the model price by a percentage.  Instead,
simply  enter  in the price in dollars for that model and the price will be
changed to that value everywhere the car is being sold.

Close  Reports  Icon:   The  Close  Reports  Icon  has  been split into two
buttons.   The  top half (stack of papers and arrow) functions as described
in  the manual.  The bottom half which shows a printer, allows you to print
out a hard copy of the report currently showing on the screen (See below in
the Additions section for more on this option.)

Supply  Lines  and  Marketing:   When  selecting  territories to target for
marketing  or to use for supply lines, you will only see the territories in
which you've put facilities.

Model Report:  In the Model report, the numbers you can see for the cost to
build  the  car  are  displayed  even  if the car is being built in another
territory  and  shipped  in.   This  is  so you can see what profit you are
making  on  the car in each territory, if you have it priced differently in
different  regions.   So,  for example, if you are selling your first model
car in the Southeastern USA, but are building them in the Northeastern USA,
you  will  still  see  building costs listed for the Southeastern USA, even
though you are not actually building the cars there.

Car  Types:   Not  all types of cars can be built at the start of the game.
More  modern types of cars (compacts, hatchbacks, and so on) will appear as
time progresses.

New Features

Newsflashes:   At times in the game, you will see a Newsflash at the end of
the  month.   Newsflashes  will  describe  current  events that might be of
interest to your company.

Updating  Models:   If  you wish to update a model of car - for example, to
put  in  a  new  brake  system  without starting from scratch on the Design
worksheet,  simply  bring  up  the old model, make the change, and click on
Make.   When  the  name  box  appears  with the old model name in it, press
Enter.   When you are asked if you want to replace the old design, click on
Yes and the model will be updated.  (The original design will be lost.)

Public  Domain  Technology:   After two car companies have discovered a new
technology,  it  will  automatically  become available to the other two car
companies.

Printing  Hard  Copies  of  Reports:   You  can  now  get printouts of your
companys  reports  if  you  have a printer compatible with the program.  To
print  out a report, click on the Printer icon at the right end of the Info
Bar,  underneath  the  Close  Reports  icon.   To  print  reports using the
keyboard, press F3.

Strikes:   If you do not keep your workers happy, they may go on strike and
halt  production.  When this happens, a Strike Resolution panel will appear
to give you options for how to settle the strike.

New  Reports:   There  are  three  new Reports for you to use to gauge your
progress.

Model Comparison. 
Click  on  the Model Comp option to see reports on how your prices stack up
against  those  of your competitors.  Click on the territory name to change
to  other territories, on the model name to view other models of your cars,
and on the competitor companys name to view the other competitors.

Consultant Report: 
Click  on Consultant to hire an outside expert to evaluate your company and
its  product  line.   This  report,  like  the  Demand  report, needs to be
purchased.   Once  the  first  report has been purchased, you can choose to
view the most recent report you bought or to order a new report.

Media Review Report: 
Click  on  Media  Rev to see what the critics think of your current models.
Click  on  the  company  name  to  see what they think of your competitors'
products.  Click on the page number to view the other pages of the report.


The  Mega-Menu:   A  new  option  has been added to the Sales and Factories
panel.   Between  the  Sales  Offices box and the Factories box is a button
labeled Mega-Menu.  Clicking on this button brings up a screen in which all
the  fuctions  of the Sales Office Detail and the Factor Detail panels have
been  combined  into one panel for easy reference and access.  Once you are
familiar  with  the  game, you may find this panel to be more convenient to
use than the normal panels.


STRATEGY HINTS
--------------

Save your game frequently at first in case disaster strikes.

Invest in research. It's worth it.

Be sure to advertise.

If  a  particular type of car isn't selling, it's because there's no demand
for it.  Some types of cars will not sell at all at the start of the game

Since there are historical aspect to DETROIT, not all territories will have
a  demand  for  cars at the start of the game.  Demand will develop in more
areas  as  time  passes.   Look  out  for  Newsflashes  telling  you when a
territory is ready to start buying.

Demand level varies by season. Plan accordingly

Demand always drops drastically during wartime.

If  sales  are  poor, consider opening more sales offices, spending more on
marketing, or improving your cars.

It's better to have several smaller factories than one large one.  The more
lines you have running, the greater variety of cars you can produce.  Build
the cars near the consumers to save money on transport fees.

There  is  an optimal number of workers for each assembly line and research
project.   If you go above that number, you will get less benefit from each
new worker.

Improving the level of a factory allows you to make the same number of cars
with  fewer  workers.   It  also  allows  you to fit more workers on a line
without overcrowding them.

Don't  hesitate  to fire workers and stop assembly lines if you're building
up  too  large a stock supply.  While having a small stock its a good thing
in  case  demand  suddenly  increases,  too  large  a  stock  is a waste of
resources.

Keep  an  eye  on  your  labor cost for your assembly lines by checking the
Model Report to see what you're spending.  If you're spending too much, cut
back on the number of workers.

Look  after  your  workers.   Pay them decent wages and give them benefits.
Striking  workers  don't make you any money.  Workers that get benefits are
more productive.

Upgrade your cars whenever possible.  Demand is higher for cars fitted with
the  cutting  edge of technology.  An expensive car with the latest options
will sell better than a cheaper outmoded car.  Obsolete cars won`t sell.

Expand  your  company.   Try  to  find territories where demands exists and
where  your  competition  isn't  producing,  and  sell  your cars there.  A
captive audience will pay more.

Keep  your prices competitive, but be sure to make a decent profit.  You're
here to make money, not friends.


TECHNICAL TIPS
--------------

We  have  found  that  many of the common problems our customers experience
with  their  machines  have  simple  answers.  If you are having one of the
problems  listed  below, the solution provided should be tried first before
you search any further for answers.

1. Abnormal Program Termination

The  "ABNORMAL  PROGRAM TERMINATION" error usually indicates that a program
cannot  run  because  the  system has not been configured to free up enough
conventional  memory.   Under  DOS,  conventional  memory is limited to 640
Kilobytes  (K)  total  (regardless  of  how  much  RAM  is installed in the
machine)  and  is  reduced  by  DOS and various Terminate and Stay Resident
(TSR) programs.  Most of our games will comfortably run with 585K or better
of free conventional memory.

To  find  out  which version of DOS you are using, type "VER<enter>" at any
DOS  prompt;  this  will  return  a message that says "MS-DOS version n.nn"
where "n.nn" refers to some number, "6.02" for example.

If  your  DOS  version  is  5.0  or higher:  type "MEM<enter>" and find the
"LARGEST EXECUTABLE PROGRAM SIZE".

If  your  DOS version is lower than 5.0:  type "CHKDSK<enter>" and find the
"BYTES FREE".

If  the free memory value is less than 585k, the system configuration needs
to be altered to increase the free conventional memory.

To increase free conventional memory:

a)  For DOS 6.0 or higher, run MEMMAKER (If the drive is compressed in some
way,  make  sure the device driver is loaded in the CONFIG.SYS file so that
it can be properly placed in upper memory).  If this doesn't free up enough
memory, create a boot disk, as described below.

b)  Alter your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files to load DOS, device drivers
and  other  TSRs  into upper memory at boot up (consult your DOS manual for
specifics on how this is done).

c)  Create a Game/Boot Disk.  If you don't know how to do this, consult the
following Tech section entitled "Creating a Game/Boot Disk".

2. Creating a Game/Boot Disk

These instructions will work best with an 80386 or better computer with two
megabytes or more of total system memory running DOS version 5.0 or better.
If  the  CPU,  memory  or  DOS  version  recommendations  are  not met, the
instructions  below should still work, but will most likely result in error
messages that can, for the purposes of a game/boot disk, be ignored.

Creating a boot disk from DOS:

Format  a  floppy  disk  in drive A:  (place a blank disk into A:  and type
"Format  A:";  follow  the  instructions  on screen; if an error message is
encountered,  make  sure  the disk is the correct density for the drive and
then consult your DOS manual).

Place a blank formatted floppy disk into drive A: and type:

C:<enter>

SYS A:<enter>

DOS 5.0 and higher:

COPY  CON  A:CONFIG.SYS<enter>  (It  is  normal  that  the prompt no longer
appears when you type <enter>)

Now type:

DEVICE=C:\DOS\HIMEM.SYS<enter>

DEVICE=C:\DOS\EMM386.EXE NOEMS <enter>

DOS=HIGH<enter>

DOS=UMB<enter>

<ctrl>-Z<enter> (hold down the <ctrl> key and type "z")

Now continue through the following instructions for DOS 3.0-5.0.

DOS 3.0 and higher:

now type:

COPY CON A:AUTOEXEC.BAT<enter>

PROMPT $P$G<enter>

PATH C:\DOS<enter>
 
C:\MOUSE\MOUSE.COM<enter>  (alter  this line depending on the path and name
of your mouse driver *.COM file.)

C:<enter>

<ctrl>-Z<enter> (hold down the <ctrl> key and type "z")

If  the  hard  drive  is configured with auto-compression software, such as
Stacker  or DoubleSpace, refer to that package's manual for instructions on
loading  the  driver  into  upper  memory  (Note:  device drivers cannot be
loaded into upper memory unless the CPU is a 386 or better).

To  boot  from  this  floppy  disk,  leave  it in drive A:  and restart the
computer.   Change  to  the directory that holds the game, then type in the
command appropriate to run the program (then have fun).

3. Mouse Problems

If your mouse does not work at all:

Is  the  mouse  installed  for  DOS?   Windows  uses  its  own drivers, and
therefore  works  without  a  properly  installed  DOS mouse driver, so you
cannot assume that because a mouse works with a Windows system that a mouse
driver for DOS programs is currently installed.

To find out whether or not such a driver is installed:

Enter  a  DOS  application  that supports a mouse, such as the EDIT utility
(DOS  5.0  or  later)  or a DOS word processor (or anything else that loads
from  the  DOS  prompt and uses a mouse).  If the mouse does not respond at
all  in  such a program, then the DOS driver is not properly loaded.  Check
the  disk  or  manual  that came with your mouse for instructions on how to
install it.

Do  you  have enough conventional memory free?  Some programs incrementally
sacrifice sound or mouse functionality when sufficient memory resources are
not  available.   Refer  to  your  DOS  manual  for  instructions on how to
increase free conventional memory.

If the mouse works sporadically (jumping around, not clicking propely etc):

You may not have a 100% Microsoft compatible mouse driver (This has nothing
to  do  with  hardware,  only  software).   Check your hard disk for a file
called  MOUSE.COM,  as  some upgrade versions of DOS include this Microsoft
mouse  driver  (type  "dir  mouse.com  /s<enter>" at the C:\ root directory
prompt)  If  not already on your system, such a driver can be obtained from
either the vendor or manufacturer of your computer.

4. Sound Card Setup

Setting sound card parameters:

To  use a sound card with an Impressions program, it is sometimes necessary
to  set  a number of parameters using the setup utility located in the game
directory.

The  significant  values are the I/O Address, the Interrupt Request Channel
(IRQ) and the Direct Memory Access (DMA) values of the relevant sound card.
These  can  sometimes be found on a line in the AUTOEXEC BAT file, which is
found  in  the  root directory of the main hard disk (C:/); if for example,
you  own  a Sound Blaster or compatible the line might begin with something
like:   "SET BLASTER" (if the card is something other than a Sound Blaster,
it  might  be  something  else,  "SET  PROAUDIO" for example) followed by a
sequence  of  letter/number  combinations including:  Annn, In, Dn (where n
represents  a  numerical digit):  Annn is the address, In is the IRQ and Dn
is the DMA value.

The  setup  program  allows  for specification of the type of sound card as
well  as  the  Address and IRQ values of the installed card (DMA is usually
assumed  to  be 1 which usually cannot be changed in the setup utility); If
any of these are incorrectly set, sound will not work with the program.

If  no  SET  BLASTER  or  similar,  line is found in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file,
consult  either  the  sound card manual or the technician who installed the
device to obtain the Address, IRQ and DMA values.

Sound card emulation:

If  you  are  using  a  card  that  is not listed as an option in the setup
program, it probably emulates something else.  It is usually a good idea to
use  the  oldest  version  of  whatever  card your system is emulating (ie.
choose  SoundBlaster over SoundBlaster pro), as the older cards are usually
better documented so that emulation of those usually works better.

5. Memory Managers

Third  party  memory  managers, such as QEMM, 386Max, etc.  sometimes cause
problems.   They  make  certain  assumptions about memory use which are not
true  of  many  high  performance  graphics intensive programs.  If you are
using  one of these memory managers and encounter graphics distortions, try
temporarily disabling third party memory managers.

Boot  up  from  a  system disk whose CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files load
only  the  memory  management utilities included with MS-DOS (HIMEM.SYS and
EMM386.EXE).   To  free  conventional  memory  use  the  DEVICEHIGH  and LH
instructions, with the DOS memory managers, to load TSRs and device drivers
into upper memory.

If  you  don't  know  how  to create a system disk, consult either your DOS
manual or the previous Tech section called "Creating a Game/Boot Disk".


STILL HAVING PROBLEMS?  BEFORE YOU CALL...

In order to allow us to help you more effectively, please try to follow the
suggestions below before you call for help.  This will assist us in finding
the  answer  to  your  problem as quickly as possible so that you can begin
playing and enjoying your new game.

READ AT LEAST THE FIRST FEW CHAPTERS OF YOUR DOS MANUAL.  The more you know
about  the  operating  system your machine is running the easier it will be
for  any  technical  support to help you solve any problems.  You should at
least  be  familiar  with  how  DOS  commands  work,  what  disk  files and
directories  are  and  what  utilities  are  available  on your machine for
editing text files.

FIND  OUT  AS  MUCH AS POSSIBLE ABOUT HOW YOUR MACHINE IS CONFIGURED.  What
version  of what brand operating system is running on the machine?  (At the
DOS  command  prompt,  type "VER" and hit enter to find out what version of
DOS  is  running) What kind of chip is running your machine?  ("486?  "386?
"286?   8086?)  How  much  memory  is in the system?  How much conventional
memory  is free?  (Free conventional memory should be above 580k or so) How
much  hard disk space is free?  What kind of video card is in your machine?
(SVGA?   VGA?   EGA?   Brand  name?) What kind of sound card, if any, is in
your  system?   Do  you  have  a  CD-ROM  drive?   Are  you  using Stacker,
Doublespace  or some other kind of disk compression?  Are you using QEMM or
some  other third party memory manager?  If Windows 3.1 is installed on the
machine,  you  can  run  Microsoft  Diagnostics  to  find out some of these
things, if you do not already know about them (type "MSD", then hit <enter>
at the command prompt).  If necessary, call whomever it was that originally
configured your system to answer these questions.

SET  UP  THE COMPUTER NEAR THE PHONE WITH THE PROGRAM INSTALLED ON THE HARD
DRIVE.  It is very difficult for a technical support person to troubleshoot
a  computer  problem over the phone without having access to the machine in
question  while it is running.  If this is not an option, list every detail
about  the  occurance  of  the  problem,  including  all  pertinent  system
configuration  information  and  keep  this  list  handy  when calling tech
support.

DEFRAG  YOUR  HARD DISK.  Non-contiguous files on a hard disk can sometimes
cause strange and mysterious things to occur.  While in the game directory,
type  "CHKDSK  *.*",  then hit <enter> at the DOS prompt to find out if all
the  game  files are contiguous or not.  A hard disk can be defragmented or
defragged,  by  using  a  disk  utility  program such as SPEEDISK, which is
packaged  with  Norton Utilities, or DEFRAG, a program included with MS-DOS
version  6.0  or  above.   This  reorders  disk  space, making stored files
contiguous.   If a hard drive has not been defragged for more than a month,
and  has  been used even moderately, it is likely that many of the files on
the disk have become non-contiguous.

CHECK  FOR VIRUSES.  Viruses can mess up even the most carefully configured
system.  Use a memory-resident virus checker (such as VSAFE, a utility that
comes with MS-DOS version 6.0 and above) whenever you insert new disks into
your  machine, and run an anti-virus utility (such as MSAV, another utility
that comes with MS-DOS v.6.0 and above) before you call.
