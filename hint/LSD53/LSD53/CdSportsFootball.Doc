             Complete Docs Typed By Instigist/Backlash

[Quick Notes: Select Button = your fire button. Directional Button =
your joystick. Stop Button = your second fire button.]

o LOADING THE GAME
 
 Welcome to Amiga CD32 Football. To load the game, place the Football
disc into the Amiga CD32. The game will automatically load.
 
* HACKED INSERT * 
 
 On the Backlash cracked version, you either simply boot off disk, or
you copy all the files to your hard drive and use the "HDLOAD" file.
(Execute this file).
 
 
o Quick Start
 
 Right now let's just jump into the game. Press the red Select Button
to choose PLAY GAME. The other options will be explained later in the
manual.
 Next you will get the game options menu. ARCADE lets you call the 
plays and control the field play. As COMMISIONER, just sit back and
watch the game played out on the screen. COACH lets you call the plays
while the Amiga CD32 controls the field play.
 Once you have picked the teams and type of game you want, you will 
see the Game Menu. Press the Select Button to select PLAY THE GAME. 
After a report from Stan Gruel and his sport anchor team, the 
referee will call the coin toss. (If you are the visiting team you get
to choose heads or tails). Listen carefully to find out wether you 
will be kicking or receiving the opening kickoff. If you are 
receiving, get ready to catch the ball. Once you catch it, start 
running downfield by pressing down on the Directional Button. Avoid
tackles by pressing left and right on the directional Button. You 
can also down the ball in the end zone by pressing the Select Button
before moving downfield.
 If you lose the coin toss and have to kick, a box with a football in
it will be displayed in the lower left corner of the screen. A 
horizontal line will move up and down in front of the ball. Press the
Select Button to stop the line. The location at which the line stops
controls the ball's hang time and distance. If the line is low on the
ball, the ball will have a long hang time, but won't go far. If it's
in the middle, the ball will have less hang time but will go farther.
If it's near the top, the kick will be short and low. Next a vertical
line will move left and right on the ball. It is also stopped by the
Select Button. This line is the directional control. If the line is 
stopped on the right, the kick will go left and vice-versa. If kicked
in the middle, it will go straight. As soon as the direction is set, 
the ball will be kicked and play will resume.
 After the kickoff you will see the statistic of the play. Now press
the Select Button to see the Play Menu. This is where you choose what
play you wish to run next. To see all the plaus available, choose the
PLAYBOOK option. To turn the pages in the playbook, use the Direction
Button to move the reed highlight box to one of the arrows in either
top corner of teh screen then press the Select Button. You will see
several pages of plays listing the name, number, and diagram of each
play. To leave the playbook without making a selection, highlight the
Stop Sign(Cancel) symbol and press the Select Button. To select a 
play, move the red highlight box to the play diagram you want and 
press the Select Button. The playbook will close and the play will
begin.
 The offensive team always lines up at the bottom of the screen and
plays towards the top of the screen. If you are on offense, wait for 
the QB to say "Set" then press the Select Button to hike the ball. If
you are on defense, wait until the QB says "Hike" to move your man
with the Directional Button or you will be penalized. 
 Once the play starts, you control the yellow highlighted player. On
offense this is always the player with the ball, who changes from the
QB to the receiver as the ball is passed. When you select a passing
play, the QB is in your control right after the ball is snapped. Once
the QB has reached the end of his drop, or you change his movement,
arrows will appear on the screen pointing to the available receivers.
A box surrounds the arrow of the currently selected receiver. If an
arrow is red, the receiver is not ready; if the ball is thrown now it
will probably be an incomplete pass, or worse, and interception. If
an arrow is yellow, the receiver is ready, but not neccessarily open
and if its yellow and flashing the receiver is ready and open. Once
the desired receiver is highlighted, let go of the button to throw the
ball. 
 When the ball is thrown, control is given to the receiver and an X
marks the spot where the ball will land. To have the best chance of
catching the ball, the receiver should be placed directly over the X
when the ball gets to it. If there are defenders around(especially if
there is someone right in front of the receiver) the chances of a 
completed pass decrease. 
 That's the short explanation of the game. Punting, Field Goals, and
Point After Attempts are performed in the same way as the kick off.
Don't forget to use the Offensive and Defensive playbooks included
with this package for information on different plays. 
 
o STARTING THE GAME
 
 Now that you have the basic idea of how Amiga CD32 Sports: Football
works, and maybe even have a game under your helmet, we'll explain 
all the menu selections available to you when you play.
 Remember you can reload the game at any time by pressing the reset
button on the Amiga CD32 console. If you're in the middle of a game
and you want to start a new one, select TIME OUT from the Play Menu
and then select START NEW GAME.
 At the beginning of a game, you will see the Main Menu. Your
Selections here are: PLAY GAME, PRACTICE, and OPTIONS. Press down on
the Directional Button until your choice is highlighted, then press
the red Select Button. If you want a two player game, you will need
to set the options first. 

o PLAY GAME
 
 After you make this selection, you will be shown a list of teams in
the league. There are 28 teams to choose from in all. The currently
selected team is highlighted in yellow. To change the current selection
press up and down on the Directional Button. Keep pressing down to 
see the additional team names on the screen. Select your team by 
pressing the Select Button. Select an opponent from the list next. 
You can pick the same team to scrimmage your offense against your
defense.
 
o SELECT ROLE
 
 After you have picked two teams, you will see the Select Role menu.
Now you need to decide which of the three ways you will play the game:
 
ARCADE mode lets you call and plays and control the players.
 
COACH mode lets you send in plays, while the CD32 controls the players.
 
COMMISIONER mode lets you sit back and watch the game played by itself.
 
 Choose and option by pressing down on the Directional Button to 
highlight the role you want, then press the Select Button. Selecting
Cancel returns you to the main menu.

o MAKE A SELECTION
 
 After you selected the role for your team you will see the Game Menu.
Your choices here are as folows:
 
PLAY THE GAME will start the game
VIEW STATS will take you to the Statistics Menu where you can view 
           either the player's individual stats or the team's stats.
SUBSTITUTION lets you change players if someone is tired or inneffective.
SET AUDIBLES lets you set up your playbook with plays you can switch at
           the line of scrimmage. 
START NEW GAME ends the currrent game and starts a new one.

o OPTIONS
 
 If you select OPTIONS you will be able to vary the conditions of the
game in several ways. Selections are made by pressing the down area
on the Directional Button until your choice is highlighted and then by
pressing the Select Button. The Options are:
 
ONE OR TWO PLAYERS lets you set the number of people playing the game.
          Player one has control during the initial menu selections.
WEATHER CONTROL lets you select between NORMAL, RAIN, or SNOW. Each 
          type offers different playing conditions. 
SPEED CONTROL lets you choose between FAST, MEDIUM, or SLOW for the 
          speed at which the game plays. The speed is normally set to
          fast, but you may wish to slow it down while learning. 
MINUTES PER QUARTER allows you to set the length of the game.
VIDEO CONTROL lets you turn the video segments on/off. (N/A in crack).
MUSIC CONTROL lets you turn music on/off. (N/A in crack).

 If you make an error selectin CANCEL from the list of choices or 
pressing the Stop Button will return you to the previous screen where 
you can re-enter the option or reset it.
