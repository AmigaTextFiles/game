        cheat this game.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    SENSIBLE SOCCER:

        To score off a corner every time, kick the ball towards the goalie.
        When a forward gets hold of it, kick it across the goal mouth and
        use after-touch to bend it into the net.  The computer never quite
        manages to work out what is going on until it is too late.  When
        your match appears next on the fixtures screen, for example
        England (You) v Germany (The Opposition), instead of choosing next
        match, click on Exit.  Now choose friendly from the main menu and
        choose Germany as your team.  Go to the Team/Formations Screen and
        get all the German star players on the bench, put the forward in
        goal, and generally mess about with the original team selection.
        Now start to play the game, but escape from it as soon as it begins.
        Return to the League/Cup games and View Opposition (Germany).  Your
        opponents team will still be mucked up.  Using this cheat you
        should be able to win every match.

        This cheat will allow you to play the game in slow motion (aka Kick
        Off 2).  What you have to do is play a match and then make a
        substitution.  Then when the player is walking off, press the 'ESC'
        key and you will quit the game.  Start another match and you should
        notice that everything plays at slow speed, even the timer!  To
        return to normal, make another substitution, but let it carry
        through.

        you unlimited lives.  Unfortunately, this does not work on all
        versions.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    *SHADOW OF THE BEAST II:

        At the start of the game, walk to the right until you reach the 
        pigmy.  Press 'A' to get into the question mode and type
        "TEN PINTS".  This will give you infinite energy.

                                ( GAME HINTS)

        Go left to where the bad guy has a guy trapped in a force field.
        Quickly hit him a couple of times to kill him and free the lower
        guy.  He will then tell you the position of a switch (upper or
        lower) for later in the game.  Now go left and down the rope to
        the swamp.  Go left until you get to the building.  Enter the
        building, go left and pick up the jug.  Now go back to where you
        started the game.  From here go right and through the spear
        throwing dudes.  Go up and kill the guy who is throwing the green
        puddle things at you.  Pick up the axe he drops.  Now go left and
        fall from the ledge.  Go right to the rock that is by itself and
        you can see a little grass spot on the ground.  Jump on this like
        4-5 times and it will fall through.  Go down the steps and you are
        in the crystal cavern.  Go left, at the bridge a guy will start
        running left.  Chase him and he will take you to a bridge that is
        being mechanically shortened.  Jump and shoot the dude thats
        cranking the bridge(3 or so shots with the axe).  Now break the
        door at the other side of the bridge with your ball & chain.  Go
        up the first chandelier.  Go left and hit the correct switch.
        Now go down and kill the guards and go right.  Get the key and go
        left, you will get caught and they throw you in jail.  USE THE 'O'
        command and give the jug to the guard.  After he passes out break
        down the door with ball & chain.  Kill the guard.  go up the rope
        (faster than the prisoner) and kill the guard at the upper left
        and then go back down the rope to get the key he dropped.  Now go
        up the rope and go left at the first chance you get.  Use 1 of the
        keys and free the prisoner.  Go to the top of the rope and go left
        and get the ring.  Now if you go right the prisoners get killed.
        Give the ring to the old man who lost it, but he still wants a
        parchment before he will teach you a spell.  The other key is for
        the locked door in the first building (the inn where you got the
        jug).

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    *SHADOW OF THE BEAST III: (Keith Krellwitz)

        invicibility and the 'LEFT CURSOR' key to go back to normal.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    SHADOW WARRIORS:

        'RIGHT ALT', '(' (numeric keypad) and 'ENTER' (numeric keypad)
        while the title screen is displayed.  The bottom of the title screen

        3 (if you have another life left).

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    SHOCKWAVE:

        A few hints and tips follow on how each of the four zones (armys,
        factorys, mines and rigs) effect the game:

        MINES - Each time a mine is purchased the income you receive for
                each time pass doubles.

        FACTORYS -  The more factorys you have the faster more weapons
                    are produced, these are essential.

        RIGS -  These supply you with the fuel for each mission run.  The
                more rigs you have the greater the amount of fuel you
                receive for each time pass.

        ARMYS - For every army unit you own, the enemy slows down.  You
                have one army unit, for each four time passes that occur
                the enemy won't move for one time pass.  If more than 50%
                of the sector is occupied by the enemy then you will lose
                one of your assests for each time pass that occurs.  The
                best solution is when 30% of the sector is occupied go an
                attack the enemy.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    SIDEARMS:

        During play, hit the 'CAPS LOCK' and type "FTBOK".  Use the

                  '6'____________________________Faster speed.  
                  '7'____________________________Slower speed.
                  '8'___________________________________Lives.
                  '9'_______________________________Beta suit.
                  'T'______________________________Game stats.
                  'X AND 0-9'_______________________Set stage.
                  'K'__________________________Kill off enemy.  
                  'D'_________________________Screen dump/die.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    SIDEWINDER:

        can access a specific level by pressing the appropriate function
        key.  You can save the changes by holding down both mouse buttons.
        You should back up disk 2 first, since the changes are permanent.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    *SILKWORM:

        On the options screen, type "SCRAP 28" for infinite lives.  Press
        '0'-'1' on the keypad to select levels.  On early versions press
        "HELP" and fire together to activate the cheat.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    SIMULCRA:
    
        THE MOTHERSHIP: It follows you around generating meanies and can
                        take many hits.  Ram rather than shoot.

        HOMING WEAPONS: Retreat as fast as possible then shot them.  Most
                        homing weapons have a limited range and can be out
                        run.

        BLITZKRIEG:     The best attack is a fast one.  Attack a generator
                        by flying along power barriers at full speed.
                        Learn to recognise the edge barriers.  Barriers you
                        can shut down never merge with the edge, and nearly
                        always lead to a generator.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    SIM CITY:

        When the title screen appears, hold down the 'SHIFT' key and type
        "FUND".  This gives you an extra 10,000 smackers.  It also causes an
        earthquake every tenth time you do it, so do it before you start
        your city.

        Another tip is to set the citizen's taxes to 0%.  Then just before
        tax collection (December or November if playing at fast speed)
        quickly set the taxes up to 20%.  Then after you collect taxes, put
        it back down to 0%.  This way the citizens think they are not
        paying any taxes.

        You can build land on water.  Find a straight (horizontal or
        vertical), stretch of coastline and string a powerline along it.
        Next, move one square over, out into the water and string another
        powerline parallel to the first.  Repeat as many times as you want.
        Then just bulldoze all the excess powerlines and you can build on
        the new land.  To make land you simply make a 3 lane highway across
        any water source.  When you make a road by putting 3 sections of
        road on top of three section of road on top of three sections of
        road (3 by 3) you make 1 section of land in the middle.

    SPACE QUEST III:

        IN THE FREIGHTER:

            Don't fool with the pod that you came in as it is a waste of
            time.

            You will notice an object to the front and right of the door you
            came out.  You cannot move it but you will need it later.

            Head off to the bottom of the screen and then go towards the
            right on the next screen.  You will see a machine bringing scrap
            towards the ceiling.  Hop on and wait.  After it dumps you, type
            "STAND" and then type "JUMP".  You will be on a cross beam.  Go
            towards the left until you reach the control room.  "CLIMB DOWN"
            onto the grabber and go around the control room.  At the screen
            after the control room screen, stop the grabber and push the
            button to lower the claw.  Pick up the warp motivator with the
            claw and after it get back to the grabber go to the right.
            After you go around the turn stop the grabber and lower the
            claw.  You will have to put the warp motivator in the hole in
            the top of the ship.  Ride back to the control room get off the
            grabber and fall down the chute.  

            At the bottom of the chute go to the left where the wire goes
            into the wall and get the reactor.  Climb out using the ladder
            and head towards the top of the screen.  you are now back where
            you started.  Go to the right and go into the tunnel.  As you
            pass thru the tunnel a rat will grab the reactor from you.  Go
            back to the room where you got the reactor and get it again.
            When you climb out again, take the ladder.  Now when you go
            through the tunnel take the wires and continue thru the tunnel.

            Go to the large head and climb in the eye.  Go to the ship and
            use the ladder to get on top and open the hatch and enter the
            ship.  Put the reactor in the hole to the left and then use the
            wires to splice them together.  Get in the cockpit and examine
            controls.  Turn on the engine, turn on the radar, take off, use
            your front shields and blast your way out.

        IN SPACE:

            Scan the area.  Don't bother with monolith burger or the
            volcanic world but go to the other one (sorry i forgot its
            name).  Land and go to the tourist trap and enter the building.
            Examine the postcards as there are interesting facts you need
            here.  Sell your gem.  Buy thermal underwear and a hat if you
            want it.  As you leave you will meet a baddie who is out to get
            you.  Don't go to your ship!  Instead go to the left of the
            robot and take the elevator up.  When the baddie follows, wait
            till he is near the gears and then grab the pulley.  After he
            becomes burger go down and get his belt.  Leave and go back to
            your ship and go to the volcano planet.  

        VOLCANO PLANET:

            Put on you underwear and go to the left and wait until the
            survey team leaves.  Get a detonator and the pole.  Go in the
            direction that the survey team left and go up the mountain and
            drop the detonator in the machine in the crater.  When you get
            to the crossing back to your ship, use the pole and jump the
            gulley.  Take off and go to pestulon.

        PESTULON:

            Use the belt and get inside past the guards.  Go to the broom
            closet and change into the janitor's closet.  Enter the
            accounting area and use the vaporizer on every trashcan you
            come to.  Make your way to the picture of elmo and take it to
            the copy machine and make a copy.  Put the picture back and
            make your way thru the accounting area to elmos office.  After
            doing elmo's trash, leave and go to the balcony.  When you
            come back, elmo will be gone and get the keycard off of his
            desk.  Make your way back to the corridor and on the security
            door use the keycard and then the picture.  When you see the
            jello mold people, push the ramp button and then vaporize the
            jello.

        THE ROBOT FIGHT:

            Just do your best, no tricks here.

        THE SPACE BATTLE:

            Make sure that you get your front shields up as the fighter
            comes at you and then destroy it when it is behind you.  You
            will have to kill all the fighters as if you miss you will die.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    TARGET RENEGADE:

        On the high score table enter your name as "PA...." for infinite
        lives.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    TEARAWAY THOMAS:

        Any time in the game, type "TIMEFLIESLIKEABANANA" for infinite time.

        There is a secret level located on level 1.3, and can be found by
        climbing up to the ninth branch of the tree (which is the one with
        the birds on it) and running off the end. You then will be whisked
        off to a room containing some diamonds which can be collected for
        extra points.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    TEENAGE MUTANT HERO TURTLES:

        When entering the protection routine, type "8859" the first time,
        type "1506" the second time and then enter the correct code.  The
        'HELP' key toggles invincibility on and off.  If you lose a turtle
        press 'HELP' to restore each turtle to full strength, even the dead
        ones.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    *TERMINATOR II:

        Pause the game, then press the function key from 'F1' to 'F10'.
        Press the 'ESC' key to skip levels.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    TERMINATOR II-THE ARCADE VERSION:

        When the game has loaded select your control method at the options
        screen as usual.  Instead of going to {Start Game} press 'ESC'.
        Wait for the high score chart with the picture of the T-1000 to
        appear.  As soon as the last digit is printed on the high score
        chart (the last 0 on the 10000, in 10th place), click the left
        mouse button (or the joystick fire button if that's plugged in to
        port one).  Note you must click the button 0.19 seconds after the
        last digit on the high score chart has been printed on the screen.
        If you take longer, or click before the last digit is printed, the
        cheat will not work, so precise timing is required.

        If you find this difficult there is an alternative.  Hold down the
        fire button or left mouse button at the high score table until it
        is finished.  This won't always work though.

        Go back to the options screen.  If you can see the picture of Arnie,
        but no options are displayed, then the cheat worked.  Left click on
        the mouse (or joystick) to move on.  Click again to skip the high
        score display.  If you allow the high score chart to be printed
        again the game may mess up.  Start the game.

        If you didn't get it to work restart the whole procedure.

        Once you've started playing you'll notice that a gunpowder and
        energy reading is displayed for player two even though he isn't
        active.  Now pause the game (press 'P' not 'F1') and type in all
        the function keys in order F1, F2, F3, F4, F5, F6, F7, F8, F9, and
        F10 and you should skip the level you are presently playing.  This
        cheat is for one player only.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    TEST DRIVE:

        Start the game and hold down the FIRE BUTTON, 'ALT', and 'C' for
        infinite lives.  Hold down the fire button, 'ALT', and 'L' to
        access any level any time (only use one or the other).

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    *TEST DRIVE II:

        During play type any of the following:

    ULTIMA 6:

        For those of you that haven't found the magic method of travel in
        Ultima 6, holding 'ALT' '2' '1' '4' will bring up a prompt (in
        Gargoylian) for three coordinates - these three hex numbers will
        bring you to any location in Britannia, the dungeons or the Gargoyle
        world.  This is apparently the programmers method of travel and is
        faster than a fan powered Balloon!

        The three numbers are basicly the x,y & z coordinates for the map,
        with 0,0,0 located at the upper left corner on Level 0 (Britannia).
        For this discussion, I will use the form x,y,l to describe this
        coordinate system.  The first two numbers (x & y) increase by 1 for
        each move in the horizontal or vertical direction.  The x
        coordinates begin at the left edge and the y coordinates begin at
        the top. The third coordinate (l) represents the level; Britannia
        is Level 0, the dungeons are levels 1 thru 4 and the Gargoyle world
        is Level 5.
    
        'ALT' '2' '1' '4' is entered on the numeric keypad.  Each coordinate
        is entered separately, ie, press 'RETURN' after each one.

        'ALT' '2' '1' '3' this gives the Gargoyle coordinate for your 
        present position plus a free view of the map - forget all those gems
        and peer spells!

        'ALT' '2' '1' '3' returns a 13 digit number, the last 7 of which are
        the coordinates.  The first 6 are related to the total number of
        moves you have made.  For the example above, the number would look
        something like:  79000029D0430 or 790000 moves and coordinate
        29D,043,0.

        BEWARE: You can land in a real 'snake pit' with some of these
        locations.  Always be prepared for the worst when teleporting to a
        strange location.

    WORLD GAMES:

        In sections which require you to beat the clock, hold down the fire
        button to qualify in under a second.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    WWF EUROPEAN RAMPAGE:

        During play, press 'F10' ten times to freeze your opponents.  Don't
        knock them down or you won't be able to pick them back up.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    WWF WRESTLEMANIA:

        Get your man outside the ring and pick up the steel chair to beat up
        any harder Fighters that you are having trouble with.  This should
        help you to get further.  When you are about to go into a joystick
        waggling battle, follow these steps:

            (A) Pause the game.

            (B) Plug the mouse into the joystick port you are using.

            (C) Unpause the game, and move the mouse rapidly from side to
                side.  This will enable you to waggle quicker than your
                opponent.
            (D) When your character has won the move, pause the game and
                plug the joystick back in.

        Place the chair outside the ring (next to the bottom left turn
        buckle) just up a bit. Now jump into the ring and you should have
        the chair.  Climb up on to a corner post, and instead of jumping
        into the ring, jump the other way.  Weird gravity!

        During a two player practice game, get 1 player to climb onto the
        top of the top left turnbuckle, then get player two to be as close
        as possible to him.  Player two should drop and kick the player,
        then he will turn into a "ghost". He can pick up the chair and
        take it into the ring.  Press escape then compete for the title,
        and the chair will still be there.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    *XENON:

        Let yourself be killed off at level 2, Stage 2 and all the aliens in
        the round will be destroyed.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    XENON II:
    
        Pause the game and type "RUSSIAN AIR", then unpause the game.  Press
        'N' to skip levels.  This doesn't work on all versions.

                         *** Halfway and End Monsters ***

        SNAIL:  Shoot at eye, avoid mines.

        ALIEN:  Shoot eyes at either side at top.  Scroll back and shoot
                center eye.

        SPIDER: Destroy as much web as possible.  Fly down to face spider
                and fire continuously.

        CRAYFISH:   Travels in figure eight.  Stay below and fire in it's
                    face.
                    
        SNAKE:  Attacks from left of screen.

        DRAGON: Shoot the side heads first, then tail, then main head.

        HEAD:   Shoot both eyes, avoiding laser fire and extending tongue.
                Shoot at head when tongue goes in.

        TANK:   Use missles

        GRAND SPACESHIP: Shoot all cannons until totally destroyed.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    *XYBOTS:

        On the high score table, enter "ALF".  Now when you start to play
        the next game you will have infinite lives and near invincibility.
        
        If you manage to reach level 10, you're better off using your radar
        to kill the xybots.  Just line them up using radar and fire, you
        don't have to be able to see them.  Keep as many keys with you as
        possible because some levels don't have enough to complete them.

        There are short cuts to level seven on levels one and four - you
        get extra cash for using them.  If you have the extra energy upgrade
        try not to let your energy fall below 100m, because you lose the
        upgrade if it does.

        Drums are not just decorations - hide behind them when possible and
        use your zapper near to them to find more cannon power.

        On level eight, near to the top left hand transporter you can get to
        two white coins by blasting away one of the three walls around them.

        Don't split up in the two-player game, because it's easier to
        complete it together.

        The master xybot lives on level 11, and you'll need to stock up on
        double shot and extra shot speed to stand a chance of survival.

        Try to get one xybot to stand behind another - they'll blow each
        other apart.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    X-OUT:

        On the equipment screen select the white bug ship and put it on the
        grid area.  Then choose the orange laser and drag it to the face of
        the shop keeper.  Keep clicking the LEFT MOUSE BUTTON until you get
        $500,000.

        Insert the disk, and hold both mousebuttons until the title screen
        appears.  When youre in the shop hold down 'HELP' and 'DEL' for a
        few seconds, now choose your ships as normal, but you have infinite
        energy.

        To get more cash at the beginning of the game, select the smallest
        ship (the one at the top), then the weediest laser (the orange one
        with single beam), and place it on the shopkeepers nose.  Hit the
        fire button to get the cash boost!

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    *YOLLANDA: (Keith Krellwitz)

        On the high score screen, type "SKID ROW".  I'm not sure this does
        anything other than put {18 and life} as your name on the high score
        table.
        
        At any time, type "QUIDITY" and use the space bar to skip
        levels.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    ZANY GOLF:

        To get to the secret level, make it to the last level and look for
        the mouse hole.  When the two eyes flash knock the ball is and off
        you go to the secret level.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    ZIRIAX:

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    ZOMBI (UBI SOFT):

        If you have seen Dawn of the Dead, you already have a good idea on
        how to solve most of the puzzles.  But here's some extra tips
        anyway:

        1.  To lock up the mall to keep zombies from getting in, you need to
            park the trucks over the entrances.  Get the key from the office
            on the 2nd floor and go to the 4th floor where the keys to the
            trucks are kept.

        2.  To keep the dead zombies from coming to un-life, lock them up in
            the freezer in the basement.

        3.  Before you can go play in the basement, you need a source of
            light.  Get the fuses and gloves from the 3rd floor and go to
            it!
