HELP
----

This section will tell you how to use the AmigaGuide Help for Edge.

AmigaGuide is a "hypertext" program to let you jump back and forth at
random in a text file. You may read things sequentially, or you may browse
in any subject you care to, and return to where you left off immediately.
Simply click on any words that looks like a gadget, and you will jump to
the place that explains the subject related to that word.	If you
double-click on ANY word that happens to be represented by a "hypertext
node", then AmigaGuide will jump you there. If there is no word listed,
the screen will flash and a "can't find" message will appear. Try clicking
on requesters or double clicking on the word; "requesters", and you will
see the results are the same.

There are headings in the help window to let you return to the table of
contents or jump back (Retrace) step by step to where you have been
already.	At any time you may simply "Browse" forward or backward through
the file.

When Edge is open, you may press the Help key at any time, and the Amiga
Guide Help file will open to the area that will explain the relevant
subject.	For instance, if a requester is open, and you need help in
deciding how to answer it, press help and the explanation of that requester
will	appear in the window.	You may of course use the hypertext
capabilities to jump around once you are in the Edge Help file. The help
system is asynchronous, which means that you can have it running and still
use the editor.	To return to the Edge program to take up where you left
off, simply activate the window you were working with.

General Conventions and Syntax
------------------------------

The Edge Window Status Line

Once the Edge Window opens, it displays a status information line which may
be on the top or bottom of the window depending on the GlobalEnvFlags flag
in GlobalEnvVars, accessable in WindowSettings.

The information line contains, from left to right:

Line number	 L:2 means Line number 2.

Column number	C:4 means Column number 4.

Letter I or O	I=Insert typing mode; O=Overstrike typing mode.

Immediately next to I or O is a letter or a blank to tell whether the
numeric keypad cursor keys are active or not.

			K=ON; blank=OFF

The decimal ASCII character code of the character under the cursor.

For example:	 77 = decimal character code for "M"

Number of Lines	#L:40 is a 40 line file

File size (bytes)	Size:714 means a file size of 714 bytes

Number of changes	Chng:9 means you have made 9 changes to the file
			since opening/last saving it

Page number	 Pg:1 means you are on page 1 of the document

Page Line number	PLn:5 means you are on line 5 of the current page

The format of the status line is defined in the MiscTexts: section in the
Text configuration file.

At the lower right hand corner is a size gadget. Click, hold, and drag to
resize the window.

General Syntax and Conventions of Edge
--------------------------------------

Edge has a number of equivalent actions that you may perform to select a
checkbox, or activate a string gadget, or perform a menu function.

If You Previously Assigned Edge:

If you happen to have made an assignment of Edge: to some path or other,
it will change the name shown in the Edge window to Edge2. It will also
change the name of the ARexx port(s) of Edge and its windows. Generally it
will append a "2" to the end of all named objects to do with Edge. If
Edge2 also exists a "3" will be appended; if Edge3 exists a "4" is
appended, etc.

Menus
-----

Menus are activated by clicking the Right Mouse Button (RMB) and holding it
down.	The Menu Bar at the top of the window will activate and names will
appear.	To select one of the Items under a Menu name, continue to hold
down the RMB and move the pointer until the item or subitem you wish to
activate is highlighted. The Item function is performed if you let go of
the RMB while that item is highlighted. Certain menu items will have a
"Command Equivalent" to the right of the item name. To use this "Keyboard
Equivalent" of the menu, press the Right Amiga Key along with the keyboard
character shown in the menu item. For instance, in a "Project" Menu, if
you wish to Open a file, you may use the menu or press the Right Amiga key
and the "o" key together. Now - to include a file by keyboard command you
press the Right Amiga key together with any Shift key and the "o" key. In
Edge, unlike most Amiga programs, if a menu shortcut key is displayed in
upper case you must also press shift since Edge normaly distinguishes
shifted and unshifted command keys.

NOTE: caps lock will not do.

Keyboard Equivalents
--------------------

The Right Amiga key is called a "Qualifier" to the "o" key, above. All
menu equivalents are qualified by the Right Amiga key.

In the Help file, a "Qualified" key press is indicated by [Right Amiga] [O]

A simple key press looks like [O] or "O", but in either case only the O key
is pressed.

Underlined Characters in the Gadget or Checkbox Name

In general, all requesters EXCEPT the file requester will have one
character in each gadget or checkbox name UNDERLINED. If you wish to
activate that gadget or to toggle that checkbox ON or OFF, you may simply
press the keyboard character that you see underlined in the gadget name.
In the Help file:

"Keyboard select:	'm'" means that you may SELECT the gadget or the
checkbox or the string gadget by simply pressing the key for M (shifted or
unshifted) because the gadget name has an underlined character 'm' in it.

"Keyboard equivalent:	[Right Amiga] [O]" means that pressing the key or
keys shown together will PERFORM A FUNCTION.

In string gadgets, to cycle forwards, press the "Tab" key. "Shift-Tab"
cycles backwards. Mouse clicks inside string gadgets activate them with a
cursor visible inside, or press the underlined character on the keyboard.
If the gadget is active, pressing the underlined character will ENTER that
character into the gadget.

ARexx

Every action you can do from the Edge interface has an equivalent ARexx
Command. Look at Commands for more information.

Starting Edge.
--------------

This section will tell you how to start Edge, either from Shell or from
Workbench, and what arguments you can supply.

Starting Edge from the Workbench

To start Edge from Workbench just double click on the Edge tool icon or
select and double click the Edge project-file(s) you want to load.

The Edge tool icon tooltypes are:

Dictionary
Filename	of	the	default	dictionary	file,	defaults	to
EdgePrg:Edge.dictionary

Dormant
Flag to specify that Edge is to start up in iconified state. If any files
are to be loaded this flag is ignored.

Force
Flag to specify that you wish to start a new copy of edge and not create
new files in the one copy already loaded. obviously this flag only has a
meaning if you have Edge already running in memory and wish to start
another.

Global
Filename	of	the	global	settings	preference  file,  defaults to
EdgePrg:Edge.global

Icon
Filename of the icon to use as project icon (not including .info, which is
added automatically), defaults to EdgePrg:Edge.icon.info

Keyboard
Filename of the keyboard config file, defaults to EdgePrg:Edge.keyboard

Local
Filename  of  the  local  settings  preference  file,  defaults  to
EdgePrg:Edge.local

Menus
Filename of the menu config file, defaults to EdgePrg:Edge.menus

MouseButtons
Filename	of	the	mouse	button	config	file,  defaults  to
EdgePrg:Edge.mousebuttons

PubScreen
The name of the public screen to open on. This keyword will override the
_GE_Monitor variable in the global settings prefs file. For example - to
run	Edge	on	DirectoryOpus's  screen  enter  a  new  tooltype:
PublicScreen='DOPUS.1'

Startup
Filename of the startup-script to be executed after all files are loaded,
defaults to EdgePrg:Edge.startup

Templates
Filename of the default template file, defaults to EdgePrg:Edge.templates

Texts
Filename  of  the  requester  and  text  config  file, defaults to
EdgePrg:Edge.texts

Wakeup
Filename of the wakeup-script to be executed after Edge is uniconified,
defaults to EdgePrg:Edge.wakeup

WorkDir
The path to use as current directory once the editor has started. For
example: WorkDir=Data:myfiles/text/pgms

The tooltypes in the project icon have the same name as the Edge
environment variable they affect, so look in the environment section for an
explanation of what and how the environment variables work.

Edge on the Workbench
---------------------

AppWindows

When Edge is running on the Workbench all text windows become what is known
as 'Application Windows'.  This means that you may drag and drop project
icons into the text windows in order to load them. If multiple icons are
dropped in one window, then the first file will be loaded in that window
and new windows will be opened for the rest of the files.

AppIcon

If you set the AppIcon flag in GE_Flags, accessible in General Settings by
clicking on the AppIcon check box, Edge will put an Application Icon on the
Workbench. This icon is called Edge-Deposit. Project icons may be dragged
and dropped into the AppIcon to load them into Edge automatically. A new
Edge window will open with each project loaded. This is a great way to
open up multiple files without going to the trouble of multiple-selecting
them.  Just click and hold down the Left Mouse Button on a project file,
drag it until the mouse pointer is over the icon, and release the mouse
button.  If the editor is iconified while doing so it will be awakened.
Double clicking on the icon works just as pressing the Edge hot key - Edge
will pop to front, and wake up if iconified. The AppIcon is fetched from
disk using the name "EdgePrg:edge.appicon.info".

Edge's Disk Icon

Once Edge is running, a disk icon called "Edge-Docs" opens on the
Workbench.  This "disk" performs sort of like a RAM_Disk except that you
cannot properly write to it, see EDGE: advanced information. What you do
use it for is mainly to access the files loaded into the editor without the
need of saving them, which is great for compiling, etc. If you use
DirectoryOpus, you may open a directory window of Edge: or Edge-Docs: and
view the files, copy project files to this disk device, or treat it as any
other drive!  When you copy files to this device, it is as if you had
loaded the project into Edge in the more conventional fashion: a new
window opens with the project file loaded.

NOTE: 
When dropping icons on Edge-Docs in Workbench, the icon tool-types (e.g.
the files local environment variables) and the files' true path are NOT
available, use the AppIcon, or AppWindows, instead, if you need that
information.

Starting from a Shell
---------------------

To start Edge from a Shell just type 'edge'; if you want the editor to load
any files at startup simply type the filenames after the command 'edge
work:mystuff/source.a';  or  to  load all C and assembler files in
work:mystuff edge work:mystuff/#?(.c|.a). The command line syntax for Edge
is as follows:

Edge	Files/M,PS=PubScreen/K,WD=WorkDir/K,
		S=Startup/K,W=Wakeup/K,
		G=Global/K,L=Local/K,
		M=Menus/K,T=Texts/K,
		K=Keyboard/K,B=MouseButtons/K,
		I=Icon/K,D=Dictionary/K,P=Templates/K,
		Z=Dormant/S,F=Force/S

This syntax is shown if you type 'edge ?'. All arguments except FILES work
as the tooltype with the same name and are explained below. FILES are, as
said above, the name(s) of the file(s) you wish the editor to load at
startup.

EDGE: advanced information
--------------------------

EDGE:  is a virtual "disk" perhaps best described as a DOS interface to
Edge.  Through it you can access all files loaded into the editor and also
load new files. Most things you can do with a normal ram disk you can also
do with EDGE: - with a few exceptions:

1) .info files cannot be loaded via EDGE:

2) It is not possible to Seek in a file which is presently written to, e.g.
  opened with MODE_NEWFILE.

3) Read/Write files are not supported; open with MODE_READWRITE.

For the more technical users out there, the following DOS packets are
supported by the EDGE: device;

  ACTION_FREE_LOCK
  ACTION_END
  ACTION_READ
  ACTION_LOCATE_OBJECT
  ACTION_FINDINPUT
  ACTION_SEEK
  ACTION_EXAMINE_OBJECT
  ACTION_EXAMINE_NEXT
  ACTION_COPY_DIR
  ACTION_PARENT
  ACTION_RENAME_OBJECT
  ACTION_SET_PROTECT
  ACTION_DISK_INFO
  ACTION_INFO
  ACTION_IS_FILESYSTEM
  ACTION_SET_DATE
  ACTION_SET_COMMENT
  ACTION_DELETE
  ACTION_WRITE
  ACTION_FINDOUTPUT

NOTE: 
If a blocking requester is active when EDGE: is in use, sometimes it may
seem as if DOS is frozen. This is because the requester will also block
the Edge's process communication with the EDGE: device - just get rid of
the requester and everything will be ok.


Edge Help: Basics
-----------------

Entering Text

Text may be entered into the window by simply typing it in. The cursor
indicates where the text will appear if you start typing. Pressing the
[Return] key breaks the line and moves the cursor down to the start of the
next line.

If you start in the middle of some text, the default is to insert the new
text and push aside the old text to make room. This is called Insert mode.
Toggle whether to Insert or Overstrike in the Settings/Local menu item.
You may select which mode to save as the default by using the Local
Settings requester opened from the Settings menu.

The default is that if you indent a line, then all subsequent lines will
indent the same amount until you move the start of the line back out to the
left. This is intended for programmers who do a lot of block indentations.
This is called AutoIndent. Your text would look like this.

All such behaviors of the editor are configurable by the user. If you
didn't want to use AutoIndent, for instance, you would select the Settings
menu item and within it, select Local Settings or use the keyboard
equivalent of pressing [Right Amiga]-[e]. This notation means to press the
Right Amiga key, hold it down, and press the [e] key at the same time.
Keys that aren't obvious such as the [e] key are named within the square
brackets.  Other such keys are [CursorUp] for the up arrow key, [Esc] for
the Escape key, and so on.

When the Local Settings requester opens, you have a choice of setting the
Insert or Overstrike mode; Word wrap (words automatically continue or
"wrap" around to the next line once you type past the right margin); or
setting AutoIndent on or off, simply by clicking on check boxes. Try
different settings to see how they affect editing in your document. You
may set everything, including tab stops and whether to show spaces, in the
Local Settings window.

Printing a Document
-------------------

You may print a document by selecting the Project/Print, Project/Print To
or Project/Print As menu items. If you choose Print As, you get a window
to change the printer settings before you print. These do not affect the
global printer settings, however.

Moving Around with the Mouse, Menu, and Keyboard

You may move the cursor up and down and side to side with the cursor arrow
keys or with the numeric keypad keys when the numeric pad is toggled so a K
appears in the window's bottom indicator bar. Toggle the keypad on and off
in Settings/Global Settings menu. You may move around quickly up and down
and side to side by simply holding down the Left Mouse Button (LMB) and
moving its pointer toward the top, bottom, or side margins. The closer the
pointer is to the margins, the faster the text will scroll. You may move
up and down with the scroll bar to the right hand side of the window as
well.  Click and hold the LMB on the scroll bar to move the text up and
down smoothly; click on an "empty" space off the scroll bar to jump the
text a proportional amount up or down.

Bookmarks

There is a special way to jump around inside the document. The menu item
is called Tools and has two items at the bottom. The first one for setting
bookmarks (special user-settable markers you can jump back to after going
off somewhere else). The second item is for jumping to the bookmarks you
set before.

Move to
The Tools menu also has a Move to section for moves to line numbers, last
change, errors, even specific bytes (useful for programmers).

Folds
Edge has the capacity to hide sections of a large document as "folds". It
behaves as if your file was written on a long scroll and part of it
"folded" out of sight.  This is useful for hiding completed sections of
program code so that they will not distract from work on other parts of the
listing.  Use the Local Settings requester to set the Fold Start and Fold
End character string you prefer to delimit the start and end of your folds.
The default for start is /*FS*/ and the default for the end is /*FE*/ but
you may change them to any string you prefer. You may also nest folds so
that you may hide sections within sections. To show a hidden section, just
place the cursor on the start of fold mark and select the menu item to show
it or show all to reveal all folds.

The File Requesters
You have a choice of the Commodore system ASL file requester or a custom
requester with more features just for Edge. If you choose in the Global
Settings to have the ASL, help is not available, but on-line help will come
up for the Edge requester when it is open, or you can jump to any help
section from anywhere in the Amigaguide file.

Block Operations
Edge supports selection and operations with both horizontal and vertical
blocks.  In order to move text around, we usually cut or copy a block and
then paste it down in some other part of the document. We select blocks by
double clicking over the start of the block; or by selecting a menu item
Block/Mark Block when the cursor is over the start of the block; or by
using the keyboard [Right Amiga] [b]. The cursor changes color (if we are
using enough colors in our system) after we select the start of the block.
The next place we click or move the cursor will highlight all the text from
the start to the cursor. Once we have moved the cursor to where we want
the end of the block to be, we may cut, copy, or perform other block
operations on it.

To select a Vertical or Columnar block, we must hold down the [Shift] key
while clicking with the mouse - or using the middle button if we have a
three button mouse, select the Columnar Block item from the Edit/Begin
Column menu, or press [Right Amiga] [Shift] [B] to start the block. Then
the highlighted text will be in a column format rather than in a horizontal
format.

Find and Replace
Refer to the Find/Replace requester for information about this subject.

Running ARexx Macros
There is a rich ARexx command set for Edge, and there are plenty of example
programs to use or learn from. Teaching you to program in ARexx is beyond
the scope of this help manual.

You  may  run any of the macros included by using the menu item
Macros/ARexx/Run ARexx Script or by pressing [Shift] [Esc].  A file
requester will open asking you for the name of the ARexx script you want to
run.

The Setting/Edit Sub-Menu
If you need to reconfigure or delete any features, you simply edit a text
file such as EdgePrg:edge.menus/main.  You don't have to remember which
file is which.  The Settings menu Edit item at the right hand side has
sub-items to edit each configuration such as menus or keyboard settings.
Selecting one of these will bring up the configuration file for that item.
Save a backup under a different name the first few times you try this.
After you finish your edit, another menu item lets you reload the
configuration so your changes will take effect.

Configuring Edge
Although a well thought out default configuration is present from the first
time you use Edge, you may easily change any of the default settings to
suit your style or habits of use. If you have been using another brand of
editor, you may want to reconfigure certain keystrokes and menus to match
what you are used to.

After installation, if you look at the directory in which Edge resides, you
will notice a number of files with names such as Edge.menus or Edge.global.
These are ASCII text files which govern the configuration of Edge. Edge
itself can open a number of Requesters which allow you to change things
such as the global prefs by pointing and clicking on check boxes which edit
the associated file indirectly.  Advanced users may edit these files
directly.  We recommend that everyone make a back up file before trying to
edit a configuration file directly. Novices should at first use only the
Requesters for changing things because these graphics interfaces don't make
"typos" when changing a file, and they are easy to change back again.

If Edge is your first editor, we suggest that you simply use it as it
comes. You may use Edge's default configuration for a while without having
to reconfigure anything.  Remember that experts developed the defaults.
The standard configuration should require only minor customization on your
part:  for instance, if you don't like or don't use some feature, you may
easily delete it from the menu or keyboard configuration file. Extensive
rearranging may take some planning, because if you change one thing, you'll
probably have to change something else, too.

Advanced users who program in different languages may configure different
versions of Edge for different projects and languages. To reconfigure
anything in your Edge editing environment, you simply modify a text file
either directly or via a requester.

Dictionaries
Edge supplies a workable C language dictionary. Once the dictionary is
loaded, it will automatically correct the case of otherwise esoteric
strings.  You may add words or modify dictionaries, because they are in
plain ASCII text format.

Dictionaries may be "included" so as to build up a project dictionary from
multiple smaller ones. The dictionary feature helps prevent needless case
sensitive errors in your code. The default configuration attempts to load
a dictionary with the name EdgePrg:Edge.dictionary which is supplied as an
empty file. If you desire to use one of the supplied technical programming
dictionaries as the default, you should change its name to the default
file, or put in a tooltype Dictionary=path:mydictionary which supplies a
path to your default dictionary.


Edge's Requesters...
--------------------

About the Notify requester.

The Notify requester is used to notify the user about something, when the
response from the user is not significant - the Notify requester only has a
'Continue' gadget.  To make the requester go away the user can click the
'Continue' gadget, the window close gadget, press the ESC or RETURN key on
the keyboard, select 'Continue' from the menu or press the menu shortcut
key for 'Continue' or press the underlined character 'C' for continue.

About the Enter a Number requester.

The Enter a Number requester is used to prompt the user for a number. The
window title will contain a short text telling the user what the number is
for.  The requester may be preloaded with a default number and if that is
OK for the user then he can just 'OK' the requester. The string gadget is
automatically activated when the requester is opened but if it should get
inactive just click in it.

You can only enter digits in this requester within the limits shown in a
small window below the number entry gadget. If the number is off limits
and you try to 'OK' the requester, the display will flash and a message
will be printed in the requester telling you if the number is too small or
too large. The requester will refuse to accept an out-of-limits number.

To 'OK' the requester and accept the number, either press the RETURN key on
the keyboard, click the 'OK' gadget, select 'OK' from the menu or press the
menu shortcut key for 'OK', or press 'O', the underlined character.

To 'Cancel' the requester either click the 'Cancel' gadget, select 'Cancel'
from the menu, press the menu shortcut key for 'Cancel', press the ESC key
on the keyboard or press the RETURN key on the keyboard with the string
gadget empty (no digits), or press 'C' for 'Cancel'.

The requester is closed by any of the responses described above. (as for
the 'OK' responses - the number must be within limits or the requester will
not go away).

About the Enter a Key requester.

The Enter a Key requester is used to prompt you for a key-sequence. The
window title will contain a short text telling you what the key is for. To
start sampling click the 'Sample' gadget - now keyboard input is monitored
and displayed in the box below the 'Sample' gadget. Once a complete
key-sequence is entered, sampling will stop.  As long as sampling is
engaged the window title will say 'Sampling'. You may also activate sample
mode by pressing the underlined character, 'p', in the name 'Sample'.

To the right of the requester there are four checkboxes controling the
qualifier options. Click in the box to toggle select/deselect or press the
keyboard equivalent - the underlined character in the name of the box.

Alt Same
Holds the state of the ALTSAME flag in _GE_Flags. If set, left Alt and
right Alt are equivalent; i.e. it doesn't matter which Alt key is pressed.
Keyboard select: 'A'

Shift Same
Holds the state of the ALTSHIFT flag in _GE_Flags. If set, left Shift and
right Shift are equivalent; i.e.  it doesn't matter which Shift key is
pressed. Keyboard select: 'S'

The Enter a String requester is used to prompt the user for a string. The
window title will contain a short text telling the user what the string is
for.  The requester may be preloaded with a default string and if that is
OK for the user then he can just 'OK' the requester. The string gadget is
automatically activated when the requester is opened, but if it should
become inactive just click in it.

You can enter any character in this requester. In order to enter non-
printing characters use backslash and a three digit decimal number, e.g.
'\\010' for a Line Feed (LF), '\\013' for Carriage Return (CR), etc.

To 'OK' the requester; i.e. accept the string, either press the RETURN key
on the keyboard, click the 'OK' gadget, select 'OK' from the menu or press
the menu shortcut key for 'OK', or press 'O', the underlined character.

To 'Cancel' the requester either click the 'Cancel' gadget, select 'Cancel'
from the menu, press the menu shortcut key for 'Cancel', press the ESC key
on the keyboard or press the RETURN key on the keyboard with the string
gadget empty (no characters), or press 'C' for 'Cancel'.

The requester is closed by any of the responses described above.

The user can also press the HELP key to activate the Edge Help-system,
which will then display this page.

The Enter a String requester MENU has three items:

OK
Give a positive response. Keyboard equivalent: [Right Amiga] [O]

Cancel
Give a negative response. Keyboard equivalent: [Right Amiga] [C]

Snapshot window
Save the current position of the Enter a String requester window in the
global environment and use it the next time the requester is called for.
Keyboard equivalent: [Right Amiga] [S]

NOTE:
If you wish to permanently save the window position you must save the
Global Settings to disk.

NOTE:
If the Enter a String requester window is pointer relative the saved
position will NOT be used.

NOTE:
The Edge ARexx Command for a string requester is RequestString.

About the Find/Replace requester.

The Find/Replace requester is used to prompt the user for find and replace
strings and search attributes. The Find and Find/Replace requesters are
identical except for one thing, the replace string gadget which will only
appear in the Find/Replace requester.  All gadgets in the Find/Replace
requester display the last values used. If this is OK, then just 'OK' the
requester.  The find string gadget is activated when the requester is
opened, but if it should become inactive just click in it or press a key if
the requester window is active. To move the cursor between the find and
replace string gadgets from the keyboard use the TAB key.

The labels for the options have characters in their names underlined. To
select that option, just press the left Amiga key and one of the underlined
characters.

Edge maintains a history of the find and replace string gadgets. To cycle
through the list, simply use the Cursor Up/Down keys. Shift Cursor Down
will move to the end of the list and clear the gadget. Shift Cursor Up
will search the list for the string currently in the gadget (just like the
shell).

You can enter any character in the string gadgets; in order to enter a
non-printable character use backslash and its three digit decimal number,
e.g. '\\010' LF, '\\013' CR, '\\000' NULL, etc.

To 'OK' the requester, i.e. accept the string(s), either press the RETURN
key on the keyboard, click the 'OK' gadget, select 'OK' from the menu,
press the menu shortcut key for 'OK', or use the keyboard: Press the 'O'
key.  In general, all requesters' items may be chosen by pressing the
underlined character in their name.

To 'Cancel' the requester either click the 'Cancel' gadget, select 'Cancel'
from the menu, press the menu shortcut key for 'Cancel', press the ESC key
on the keyboard or press the RETURN key on the keyboard with the find
string gadget empty (no characters). You may also press 'C'.

The requester is closed by any of the responses described above.

The user can also press the HELP key to activate the Edge Help-system which
will then display this page.

The Find/Replace requester MENU has eight items, described below.

OK
Go ahead and Find/Replace. Keyboard equivalent: [Right Amiga] [O]

Cancel
Abort the operation. Keyboard equivalent: [Right Amiga] [C]

Snapshot window
Save current position of the Find/Replace requester window in the global
environment and use it the next time the requester is called for. Keyboard
equivalent: [Right Amiga] [S]

NOTE:
If you wish to permanently save the window position you must save the
Global Settings to disk.

NOTE: 
If the Find/Replace requester window is pointer relative, the saved
position will NOT be used.

The five items below are used to toggle the state of the five checkboxes in
the right side, displaying the current state of the search flags. A check
in the checkbox means the flag is active.

Ignore case
Toggles the UCEQLC flag; if this flag is active upper case is treated equal
to lower case in searches, else case is significant. Keyboard equivalent:
[Right Amiga] [A]

Scan forward
Toggles the FORWARD flag; if this flag is active the search is made
forwards in the file, towards the end of the file, else the search is made
backwards, towards start of the file. Keyboard equivalent: [Right Amiga]
[F]

Use wildcards
Toggles the WILD flag; if this flag is active and the find string contains
any wildcard characters then pattern matching is used during the search.
Keyboard equivalent: [Right Amiga] [D]
		  
Searching with wildcards is line oriented, e.g. the entire line is matched
against the find-string once and only once. If a match occurs then the
cursor will be positioned at column 1 on the line that matched. The 'Only
whole words' option is ignored when searching for wildcards.

Only whole words
Toggles the WORD flag; if this flag is active then the search is made to
check for white spaces before and after the specified find string.
Keyboard equivalent: [Right Amiga] [W]

Circular scan
Toggles the CIRCULAR flag; if this flag is active then the search is made
circular; that is when end or start of file is reached, the search is
restarted at the other end of the file and will continue until either the
find string or the beginning of the search is found. Keyboard equivalent:
[Right Amiga] [R]

Swap...
This item only appears in the Replace requester. When selected the Find
and Replace strings are swapped. Keyboard equivalent: [Right Amiga] [T]

NOTE:
The Keyboard equivalents will toggle checkboxes even if a string gadget is
active.

About the Edge File/Directory requester.

NOTE: 
If you have selected the ASL File Requester (the Amiga Standard File
Requester) in the General Settings window, this description does not apply.
The ASL requester is described in the AmigaDOS documentation.

The Edge File/Directory requeste will expand to maintain a file
for the command as you do when you bind a macro to a key. Use the
Settings/Edit/Keyboard menu to open the keyboard configuration file.

NOTE: 
Edge has an ARexx or host address which is case sensitive. The primary
ARexx port is normally "EDGE" and is also the screen title text. Normally
you won't talk to this port.

Additionally, each window in turn opens its own ARexx port with the
following syntax (case sensitive):

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
EDGE1.1.2 means Edge, window 1, view 2
EDGE1.3.4 means Edge, window 3, view 4
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

If your ARexx macro needs to send commands between windows, then you need
to do an address instruction to change the current address to the window
you want to send the command to.

There is a rich ARexx command set for Edge, and there are plenty of example
programs to use or learn from. Teaching you to program in ARexx is beyond
the scope of this on-line help. Click for more info

See ARexx commands for more information

Commands
--------

See ARexx macros & hot-keys for more information

Edge ARexx Command Set

All commands return their result in the ARexx RESULT variable; the RC
variable indicates failure or success (0=success, any other value is
severity level on the error that occurred).

ActivateWindow
--------------

FORMAT

ActivateWindow PORT,TOP/S,BOTTOM/S,NEXT/S,PREVIOUS/S,LASTACTIVE/S,CURRENT/S

DESCRIPTION
Activate a window for USER input. Take care when using this function from
ARexx, since the host address doesn't change. If you wish to change the
host address to that of the activated window you must 'address value
result' using the result from this function.

INPUTS

PORT	- Activate the Edge window with the given ARexx address, if the
		port is not found no window will be activated.

TOP	- Activate the first window in the first file.

BOTTOM	- Activate the last window in the last file.

NEXT	- Activate the next window in the window list.

PREVIOUS  - Activate the previous window in the window list.

LASTACTIVE - Activate the window previously active, useful for toggling
		between two windows.

CURRENT	- Activate the Edge window attached to the current ARexx address.

NOTE
NEXT and PREVIOUS are circular, which means that if the current window is
the last one and you specify NEXT you will activate the first window in the
first file, and if the current window is the first one and you specify
PREVIOUS you will activate the last window in the last file.

If no switches are specified the last text window receiving input from the
user will be activated.

You may only specify one of the switches at a time.

RESULTS
The ARexx-address of the activated window.

AddErr

NW	- Get the address of the next window in the window list.

PW	- Get the address of the previous window in the window list.

NOTE
NEXT and PREVIOUS are circular which means that if the current file is the
last one and you specify NEXT you will get the address of the first file,
and if the current file is the first one and you specify PREVIOUS you will
get the address of the last file. The same goes for the window switches
and the window list.

	NOBACKUP/S,NOQUIT/S

DESCRIPTION
Quits the current file. If the current file is the last one then Edge will
either iconify or quit depending on the DORMANTQUIT flag in _GE_Flags. The
FORCE switch suppresses the requester that will pop up if any changes have
been made to the file, asking the user to confirm that losing the changes
is OK.  The FORCEREXX switch suppresses the requester that will pop up if
any of the file windows have any outstanding ARexx messages (the requester
is only visually suppressed - the outstanding messages must return before
the editor can be unloaded). The FORCEOK switch suppresses the requester
that pops up if no changes are made and no ARexx messages are outstanding,
asking if quitting the file is OK. If the SAVE switch is present the file
will be saved before it is closed. The ICON, NOICON, BACKUP and NOBACKUP
switches are used to force or suppress icon and backup creation when
saving.  The NOQUIT switch is used to make sure that Edge will not
unload/iconify if the last file is force closed.

INPUTS

BACKUPS  - Forces create backups for all files saved.

FORCE	- Suppresses the requester asking the user about losing any
		changes.

FORECEOK - Suppresses the 'OK to close file..' requester.

all outstanding ARexx messages have returned, the ARexx IO stream will be
closed regardless of setfont, close delay, etc.

INPUTS
None

CompleteTemplate
----------------

FORMAT
CompleteTemplate TEMPLATE

DESCRIPTION
Searches the template-list for a match to TEMPLATE or the word currently
under the cursor.  If a match, and only one, is found then if a TEMPLATE
was specified the fill-text is returned as the result and if no TEMPLATE
was given the fill-text is inserted into the file.

NOTE: 
In order to match a template you need only give enough characters to
uniquely separate it from the rest of the templates, i.e. if 'while' is
the only template beginning on 'w' you need only give a 'w' in order to get
a match.

NOTE: 
You must have loaded a template configuration or created at least one
template with the Template command in order for this function to do
anything.

The fill-text may contain two special characters:

'@'
Position the cursor on the character after this one when the fill-text has
been inserted.

'´'
Insert a 'backspace'.

To include a true '@' or '´' simply type two in a row '@@' or '´´'.

INPUTS

TEMPLATE - Template to match or nothing to use the word under the cursor.

RESULTS
If a TEMPLATE is given the fill-text is not inserted into the file but
returned as the result from this function.  On the other hand, if no
TEMPLATE is given the fill-text is inserted and the final cursor position
is returned as the result.

Copy
----

FORMAT

Copy GC=GLOBALCLIP/S,SC=SMALLCLIP/S,CHAR/S,WORD/S,BACK/S,LINE/S,SOL/S,
	EOL/S,APPEND/S,RB=RESULTBUFF/S

DESCRIPTION
Copies the currenly selected block to one of the clipboards. If GLOBALCLIP
is specified the text will be copied to the global clipboard; if SMALLCLIP
is specified the text will be copied to the small clipboard; and if
RESULTBUFF is specified the text will be copied to the ARexx result buffer,
else the text will be copied to the local clipboard. The contents of the
small clipboard are found in the Edge environment variable _FE_SmallClip.
With normal block operations you must first select or mark the text you
wish to copy to a clipboard, but that is not the case with the following
switches:  CHAR, WORD, LINE, SOL, and EOL. When you specify any of those
switches the selected entity will be automatically marked and copied to the
selected clipboard. If the APPEND flag is specified the newly copied text
is not just put into the specified clip but joined to the end of what is
already in the clip - with this switch you can merge text from different
places into the clip and then insert it all in one go.

INPUTS

GLOBALCLIP - Flag to select the globalclip.

SMALLCLIP - Flag to select the smallclip.

CHAR	- Auto mark and copy the character under the cursor.

WORD	- Auto mark and copy the word beginning under and extending to
		the right of the cursor plus trailing spaces.

BACK	- This flag only works together with CHAR and WORD. If given
		the text to the left of the cursor is copied instead of the
		text to the right.

LINE	- Auto mark and copy the whole current line.

SOL	- Auto mark and copy all characters from the start of the line
		to the cursor, not including the character under the cursor.

EOL	- Auto mark and copy all characters from the cursor, including
		the character under the cursor, to the end of the line.

CorrectCase
-----------

FORMAT
CorrectCase WORD

DESCRIPTION
Searches the dictionary for a case-insignificant match to WORD or the word
currently under the cursor.  If a match is found then if a WORD was
specified the word found in the dictionary is returned as the result and if
no WORD was given the word under the cursor will be replaced with the word
found in the dictionary.

NOTE: 
In order to get a match the word must be spelled correctly.

NOTE: 
You must have loaded a dictionary or created at least one entry in the
dictionary with the Dictionary command in order for this function to do
anything.

INPUTS

WORD - Word to correct or nothing to use the word under the cursor.

RESULTS
The word found in the dictionary.

CorrectWord
-----------

FORMAT
CorrectWord WORD

DESCRIPTION
Searches the dictionary for the best fitting word according to WORD or the
word currently under the cursor. If a match is found then if a WORD was
specified the word found in the dictionary is returned as the result and if
no WORD was given, the word under the cursor will be replaced with the word
found in the dictionary.

NOTE: 
You must have loaded a dictionary or created at least one entry in the
dictionary with the Dictionary command in order for this function to do
anything.

NOTE: 
Edge uses a best fit function to try to correct the given word. If it is
spelled too badly Edge will not be able to correct it. However - Edge
would rather guess than fail, so if you try to correct a word that is not
in the dictionary you may end up with the closest thing Edge could find.
This should not be a problem since it is easy to undo changes.

NOTE: 
The first letter must be correct and enough letters typed for the
correction to have a chance to be successful; i.e. you can not type
'sewiti' and hope that it will be corrected to 'SetWindowTitles'.

INPUTS

WORD - Word to correct or nothing to use the word under the cursor.

RESULTS
The word found in the dictionary.

Select
------

FORMAT
Select FILENAME,FULLNAME,TOP/S,BOTTOM/S,NEXT/S,PREVIOUS/S

DESCRIPTION
Selects a new current file to work with. Activates the first window in the
specified file for USER input. Take care when using this function from
ARexx, since the host address doesn't change. If you wish to change the
host address to that of the activated window you must 'address value
result' using the result from this function.  If no filename and no
switches are given the user is prompted with a requester to enter a
filename.

Edge maintains a history of the Select (global) string gadget. To cycle
through the list, simply use the Cursor Up/Down keys. Shift Cursor Up will
move to the top of the list; Shift Cursor Down will move to the bottom of
the list.  Shift Cursor Down will move to the start of the list and clear
the gadget. Shift Cursor Up will search the list for the string currently
in the gadget (just like the shell). None of the history files can be
saved.

INPUTS

FILENAME - Activate the first window in the given file; the search is made
	  ignoring the Edge path components.

FULLNAME - Activate the first window in the given file; the search is made
	  taking into account the Edge path componets.

TOP	- Activate the first window in the first file.

BOTTOM  - Activate the last window in the last file.

NEXT	- Activate the next window in the window list.

PREVIOUS - Activate the previous window in the window list.

NOTE
NEXT and PREVIOUS are circular, which means that if the current window is
the last one and you specify NEXT you will activate the first window in the
first file, and if the current window is the first one and you specify
PREVIOUS you will activate the last window in the last file.

You may only specify one of the switches at a time.

RESULTS
The ARexx-address of the activated window.

SetBookMark
-----------

FORMAT
SetBookMark MARK/A/N

DESCRIPTION
Sets a bookmark in the text. The mark number must be within the valid
range 1 - 10.

different and useful ways.

INPUTS

CHAR - Change the character under the cursor. The cursor is moved to the
	right.

WORD - Change the word beginning under and extending to the right of the
	cursor. The cursor is moved to the right.

BACK - This flag only works together with CHAR and WORD. If BACK is
	used, the text to the LEFT of the cursor is changed instead of the
	text to the right. The cursor is moved to the left.

LINE - Change the entire current line. The cursor is moved to the line
	below.

SOL  - Change all characters from the start of the line to the cursor,
	not including the character under the cursor. The cursor is moved
	to SOL.

	under the cursor, to the end of the line. The cursor is moved to
	EOL.

BLOCK - Change the currently selected block.

Template
--------

FORMAT
Template TEMPLATE/A,ASK/S,FORCE/S,FILL/F

DESCRIPTION
Inquires about, removes or adds a template to the template configuration.

INPUTS

TEMPLATE - The template you wish to affect.

ASK	- Switch used to inquire about the fill-text currently assigned
	  to the given TEMPLATE.

FILL	- The fill-text you wish to assign to the given TEMPLATE. To
	  include non-printing characters use decimal codes: '\\xxx'
	  e.g. '\\169' = '-' '\\065' = 'A', '\\010' = LF, etc.

FORCE	- Switch to suppress the 'OK to overwrite' requester that will
	  pop up if TEMPLATE already exists.

EXAMPLES

Template ff ask	; inquire about template 'ff'

Template ff force  ; remove template 'ff'; i.e. assign it a fill-text ''.

RESULTS
The old fill-text assigned to TEMPLATE.

Text
----

FORMAT
Text TEXT/A,RAW/S

DESCRIPTION
Inserts or overwrites characters in the file at the current cursor
position. The characters to be written must be quoted, and in order to use
non-printable characters use backslash and a three digit decimal number,
e.g.  "\\010" for LF, "\\009" for TAB, "\\065" for A, etc. Normally the
characters are inserted one by one and are affected by AUTOINDENT,
CORRECTCASE and WORDWRAP. However - if the RAW switch is specified, then
the text is inserted as a block in one go which is much faster, but
AUTOINDENT, CORRECTCASE and WORDWRAP are bypassed.

INPUTS

RAW - Switch to bypass AUTOINDENT, CORRECTCASE and WORDWRAP.

TEXT - The characters to be inserted.

RESULTS
The new position will be returned with the format:

DESCRIPTION
This is a powerful window manipulating command. It will allow you to split
a window into two windows, vertically or horizontally, close a window,
snapshot a window so that the next time you load the file the window will
have the same size and position (providing you have elected to save the
local settings with the file), resize, zip, zoom, unzoom and move a window
in front of all windows or behind all windows.

INPUTS

SPLITVERTICAL  - Split the current window in two, vertically.

SPLITHORIZONTAL - Split the current window in two, horizontally.

CLOSE	  - Close the current window.

FORCE	  - Suppress the requester that will pop up if this window
		 is the last one in the file and the file contains
		 changes, asking if losing the changes is OK.

FORCEREXX	- Suppress the 'ARexx outstanding msg' requester that will
		 appear if running this command from ARexx, or if any
		 other scripts are still out there.

FORCEOK	 - Suppress the 'OK to quit file 'xx'' requester that will pop
		 up if this window is the last in the file and no changes
		 are made.

SNAPSHOT	- Snapshot the current window.

MAX		- Resize the current window to its maximum size.

MIN		- Resize the current window to its minimum size.

FRONT	  - Bring the current window in front of all other windows.

BACK		- Move the current window behind all other windows.

ZOOM		- Zoom the current window.

UNZOOM	 - UnZoom the current window.

ZIP		- Either Zoom or UnZoom the current window depending on
		 its current state (zoomed or unzoomed).

NOTE
If a window is Zoomed when you make a snapshot, the size/position will be
stored in the zoom size/position variables.

The result returned from this command is the state the window was in BEFORE
it was changed, zoomed, min, max, etc.

RESULTS
The window position, size and ARexx-address is returned with the format: X
x, Y y, W w, H h, ARexx-address, ZoomFlag ('Zoomed' or 'UnZoomed') x, y, w
and h are decimal numbers. X, Y, W, and H are the actual letter.

DISPLAYTIME - How long to show it, no entry uses default which is 4.

Environment
-----------

The Edge environment variables and flags.

Edge has one global environment that contains settings used by all files,
and then each file has its own local environment as well. The local
environment is actually divided into 2 parts, one large section, the File
environment, and then for each window in the file a small section known as
the Window environment.

 
NOTE:  There is no file for window environment variables since they are
dynamic and depend on the opened window conditions. The window variables
are accessible through GetEnvVar and PutEnvVar.
  
Actual Environment Files

These environment, or prefs, files may also contain an INCLUDE directive to
include another prefs file into the current one. INCLUDEs may be nested up
to 8 levels deep before an error is reported.

Dos Wildcards
-------------

The Amiga's Pattern Matching Wildcards...

?	Matches any single character. For example, FI?E would
	match FILE, FINE and FIRE but not FIE.

#	Matches the following expression 0 or more times. For
	example, FRE#D would match FRE, FRED, FREDD, FREDDD, etc.
	#? will match anything.

(a|b|c) Matches any one of the items seperated by '|'. For
	example, (D#?G|C#?T) would match DOG, CAT, DIG, COT, etc.

~	The tilde, the upper left key on most keyboards, negates
	the following expression. It matches all strings that do
	not match the expression. For example, F~(ROG)#? will
	match FROM but not FROG. ~J#? will match anything not 
	starting with the letter J.
	
[abc]  A character class: matches only the characters in the
	class. For example, a[bcd] will match ab, ac and ad but
	not ae.
 
[~abc] The tilde here indicates a negated character class: matches
	only the characters not in the class. For example, a[~bc]
	will match ad and ae but not ab and ac.
	
[a-z]  Character range (only within character classes). For
	example, [a-z] represents all the lowercase letters from a
	to z. [a-cx-z]#? would match any name starting with the
	letters a, b, c, x, y or z.

%	Matches the null string. For example, CA(M|%)P will match
	CAMP and CAP.

'	The apostrophe, found on most keyboards just to the left of
	the return key. This character is used to declare the
	following character to be a literal character, instead of a
	possible wildcard symbol. This permits you to use the
	characters #, ?, |, %, (, ), [, ], *, ~ and even an
	apostrophe as themselves. For example, YEAR#?'% will match
	YEAR1989%, YEAR1990% but not YEAR1989 or YEAR1990 as would
	normally be the case
	
NOTE:
The term "expression", above, means either a single character (ex: "#?"),
or  an alternation (ex:  "#(ab|cd|ef)"), or a character class (ex:
"#[a-zA-Z]").

More Pattern Matching Examples:

A?B	 	Matches any three letter names beginning with A and
		ending with B, such as AcB, AzB and alb.

A#BC		Matches any name beginning with A, ending with C and
		having any number of Bs in between, such as AC, ABC,
		ABBC, ABBBC and so on.

A#(BC)		Matches any name beginning with A and followed by any
		number of BC combinations, such as ABC, ABCBC, ABCBCBC
		and so on.

A(B|C)D		Matches ABD or ACD.

ABC#?		Matches any name beginning with ABC, reqardless of what
		follows, such as ABCD, ABCDEF.info or ABCXYZ.

#?XYZ		Matches any names ending in XYZ, requardless of what
		precedes it, such as ABCXYZ and ABCDEFXYZ.

[A-D]#?		Matches any name beginning with A, B, C or D.

~(XYZ)		Matches anything but XYZ.

~(#?XYZ)	Matches anything not ending in XYZ.

A(B|D|%)#C 	Matches ABC, ADC, AC (% is the null string), ABCC,
		ADCC, ACCC and so on.
