                                   Hints

When playing you will probably notice that you never get what you are
looking for.  Try to make the most of the unexpected, until Mr right turns
up, or start again.

The game gives you very little of anything.  Big armies on long trips are
out of the question at the beggining.  Getting the correct balance between
too much and too little is what can make or break you right from the
start.

To start with, armies are greedy! They can eat you out of palace and
caliphate-literally.  So to get things going try this as a fairly accurate
gauge.  The ratio for one man per month is;

1 man = 3 units cash, 15 units food and 30 units water.

So a typical army of 200 men would consume an average of 600 cash units,
3000 food units and 6000 water units and thats only for a month.

Only send out armies you know can afford (you are not alowed a budget
defecit).

When the armies are ready you have to find something not too far away for
them to attack.  This should not be a caliphate as he will have too many
men for you to fight.  An independant fort is the answer.  If on your
first attempts you send out two armies, to the same castle, one can attack
and the other sit in reserve until needed.  If you should fail to take the
prize the first time round, you can bring up the second army for a crack
at the plum.  You should find that the fort is substantially weaker.

If your first army was succesful, choose the fort icon on the left hand
side of the screen and select military.  Take the supply option, then use
the army as a supply post for the fortress.

Your second army can then go on to continue your `message of frendship' to
other tin pot dictators and the like and spread a little sunshine.


                            STORMING A FORTRESS

If you choose `storm the fortress' option you stand a very poor chance of
succeding.  You march your army as close as possible to the fort and then
choose `offensive' option from the military menu.  This will enable you to
take the enemy head on, rather than trying to bribe your way in the back
door, never a good option.


                          OTHER METHODS OF ATTACK

Trap door spiders have a novel way of attack.  They lie hidden until their
pray walks past the door, then they leap out and attack.  Use this method
of ambush against other armies.  First send out a spy to determine the
size of their army, then if its worth the effort, raise an unrealisticly
large army and jump the unsuspecting baddies, get the loot and go home.


                                  FIGHTING

Archery is one of the first methods of attack that you will be using-
unless you bump into an army on your `goodwill missions', then it is down
to sword fighting.

With archery you must be careful that you know where your enemy is.  They
have a habit of getting behind your line of vision.  To combat this always
keep on the move and try to avoid incoming arrows.  A good move is is to
aim-move-fire continuesly until one side is down.

When sword fighting, a sure fire way is to cosh the arab over the head
rather than slice it off.  To do this move the mouse forward and then
press the left mouse button.


                                SEA BATTLES

These are a different kettle of fish altogether.  Something you should
avoid is to get too close.  This means ramming is out-this tactic
invariably ends in both sides sinking.

Get close, then let the archers and cannons loose at your enemy.  When he
has a fix on your distance, change distance and start again.


                                   TRADE

Trade is only really good in one of two situations, the first being the
best-you have money to burn and you wish to buy castles.  This way you
gain a fort, men and whatever else is in it at that time, giving you
another foot in the door.

The second, which if done incorrectly can spell certain doom, is if you
sell too many forts to raise money.  This will entail you becoming too
poor to raise armies.

The final way, which also is not entirely advisable, is to move an army
out and give them enough supplies to last them for a while.  Then get a
caravan to take the rest of the goodies out of the fortress.  Sell the
fortress to some unsuspecting neighbour and if and when it is bought, go
on the offensive and attack it, thus gaining the money you sold it for and
the fortress (if you manage to win). Either do not do this or only once or
twice.  Otherwise there goes the neighbourhood.


                              KEEPING CASTLES

If you wish to stop your castles from being taken from you, it is
sometimes a good idea to keep a good sized army in the fort.  This
prevents your neighbours getting bigheaded and trying to take over your
forts.  One way of actually getting soldiers on your side (not yours) is
to corrupt them, but you need your spies to enable you to know how much is
required to bribe them to fight the good fight.

Regular caravans from your fort are a very good idea, this prevents the
enemy from getting their hands on your loot, if they attack and win one of
your forts.

People, problems and how to deal with them you`ve got to keep the masses
happy-military and non-military personel.  You need incentives to keep
them on your side.Being a good guy is not always enough.If they are
maltreated for too long-they rebel, either by burning the taxes or killing
you.  Neither is a good idea, so this must be avoided if you are to get
anywhere in your regime.

Cities need certain amounts to be left behind or you lose them.  This
means finding out how much each city needs and either keeping it stocked
up or regulary supplying it.

Every so often you have to be a generous ruler and give back to the people
what you took from them.  This has to be substantial amounts of money,
otherwise they think you are taking them for granted.

Whatever you do you have to keep a balance in your forts or they will
become independent, and you will have to fight all over again to regain
your foothold


                              CALIPHS ALI BAHR

Choose this character for a really testing game.  It seems that his
citizens are not very happy and keep burning his taxes, thus making it
very difficult to get anywhere in the game.


                                    ALI

This man may be old but he has a nice balance of most things.  His people
tend to be quite loyal, but can be pushed if not kept happy.


                                   UTMAN

This character is middle of the road.


                                    UMAN

Choose this one if you want a reasonably easy life.  Makes a good balance
of taxes and lack of fires, but has an islans so you can see attacks from
afar.However, watch you don`t get carried away.

                                  Solution

Go to the ring, the go to the Passage of Faithful to kill the Protozorq wich
is preventing you from entering.  Pick up his Zapstick.  Go to the noose and
use the Solar Eyes.  Take the left rope.  Push the lever and press the eye
underneath the lever.  Pass through the trapdoor and wait in the pink
gallery until 1:02.  Return to the noose and use the Solar Eyes.  Go to the
Master's Orbit and enter the Master's Eye.  Inspect the master and search
his body.  Take the whistle and use it.  Take the egg in the cavity and
return to the Passage of Faithful.  Enter and turn left twice.  Pull the
bolt and pass the bars.  Use extreme violence to tame Delios then dive.
Zone scan.  Enter the passage the go straight ahead, turn left and follow
the passage.  Talk to Normajeen and Ash and tell the truth.  Zone Scan.
Lift the Stone slab and take the flask (the bean is not needed).  Left
gallery, then trapdoor.  Go to the Threshold of Truth and kil the priestess.
Put the egg in the open mouth.  Inspect the Lectern.  PSI shift on the top

Powers.  Kill the first priestess after the ceremony.  Brainwarp the second
one the give her the flash to drink from.  Get the sacrificial blade and the
mask.  Go to Presence of God the Saura's Repose.  Put the statuette into the
niche and the monkey in the tunnel.  Go to Presence of God and count the
stars on the starry wall.  Enter the passage and wait until THEY come.  Use
extreme violence on his Saintless Zorq.  Use Brainwarp and Harssk and PSI
Shift on the trapdoor.  Wait until they reach the top of the ladder and

                                    LEVEL 1

Destroy the escaping jeep as soon as possible.  To do this stay in line
with it and point the nose down by accelerating.  Remember to stay on the
road, otherwise Sanchez's men will get you.


                                    LEVEL 2

Stay away from the open door by taking cover close to the walls.  Running
towards the enemy can make them run away, but dosen't get rid of them
alltogether. Shooting the oil drums conserves bullets, but keep well back,
because they destroy everything in their vicinity.


                                    LEVEL 3

To grab the tail of Sanchez's plane, keep away from the clouds and press
the fire button to attach the tow cable.  Don't do this until bond is
close enough, but make sure you fire in advance to allow reaction time.


                                    LEVEL 4

Stay under water when boats and snipers are around.  Keep a full tank of
oxygen and don't surface unless divers appear.  Try to get a harpoon gun
by stabbing one of the divers, and save it for the arrival of the
seaplane, fire the harpoon at it and climb up the cable.


                                    LEVEL 5

When you're inside the truck, you'll be under attack from other vehicles.
Trucks can be destroyed by ramming them repeatadly into the roadside.
After a little of this treatment, the trailer is released.  Leaving the
rig to do the damage, and this must be knocked out too.  Watch out for
jeeps, because they carry missiles.  Avoid their firepower by staying out
of line, and destroy them by driving over them.

                            THE QUICK GETAWAY

To grab as many positions as possible at the beginning,use the pitlane -
the other players completely ignore it! Watch out though - stay too long
in there and you`ll automatically slow down!


                               GEARBOX INFO

As the instructions say,although the automatic Lotus doesn`t accelerate
quite as well as the manual,it can still reach the same maximum speeds as
the manual.Since changing up and down can be a real pain at times, it's
best to stick to the automatic gearbox - its still possible to reach the
end of the hard tracks with it.If you are desperate to use a manual
gearbox,always choose FX rather than muzak at the start of a game.  This
way its easier to tell when to change gear by the sound of the engine.


                              LOTUS HANDLING

Quite a lot of people seem to accelerate and just hope for the best.  This
is a bit stupid as some of the cornering required can be handled with ease
just by laying off the accelerator.The handling of your Lotus improves and
this is the best time to gain a few positions.


                            TWO-PLAYER TACTICS

One great tactic to remember is to slow down when taking corners and steer
into the oncoming path of your opponent.  If he doesn`t wham into the back
of your car, he`s a lot more likely to zoom off the road and into a
wayside obstacle losing loadsa time!  Just remember though, one of you
must make the top ten for you to progress to the next race!


                                REFUELING

Some of the tracks require a lot more fuel than can be initiallly packed
into your Lotus`s fuel tank.On the vast majority of races refueling is
best reserved for the last lap - this way you can best judge how much time
you need to spend in the pits.  When entering the pit lane,the best way to
slow down is to just clip a roadside obstacle.  If all goes well you
shouldn`t end up off the road, but should slow down to a stop rather
quickly.


                             LANDSCAPE LARKS

Some of Lotus`s races dont take place on the road!  Other terrain includes
sand and ice.  Ice is simple, just play on as usual and use the roadside
obstacles to gauge where you are on the track.  The other cars
automatically go slower as well so victory should be simple.  The steering
is very unresponsive on sandy tracks so lay off the accelerator on corners
- or else!

In a two-player game, type player one's name as "FIELDS OF FIRE" and
player two's as "IN A BIG COUNTRY".  Even if neither of you get into the
top ten, you`ll both still qualify!

For an alternative game, you can type "MONSTER" as player one and
"SEVENTEEN" as player two.

                                  Solution

You start off in the control room of your ship. At the bottom of the screen

in the computer rooms.

- If you don't activate the elevator it's useless.

- Don't forget to warn the helicopter.

- Search around when you're in the library.  There's a secret staircase
here.

elevator.


                                   Hints

Every time you enter a room you must blow away the door with your machine-
gun.  Later on you can see where you have already been.  You only have to
see whether the door has been damaged.

Regularly visit the First-Aid stations.  So long as he isn't in enemy hands,
the doctor can heal your wounds.

Don't waste your time or grenades on trying to blow the Cell or Storage Room
doors.  Just unlock them using the computer

Never search when you are near a prisoner or when you see the ambassador's
daughter.  They have placed a booby-trap.

                                  LEVEL 1

The end of level one  throws the first of many armoured vehicles against
you.  On this screen you will see a crack in the ground - stand here and
fire like hell the tank blows up.  When the tank fires at you, move to the
left then jump to the right back to the crack in the floor.  Be careful
not to shoot the soldier, as this has the incurred effect of rather
pissing off the driver, leading to a barrage of bombs being thrown at you.
Keep up with these tactics and you will soon destroy the tank.  As soon as
the tank explodes move right to dodge his last feeble attempts at your
destruction.

                                 LEVEL 2

Here you will meet a formidable opponent in the shape of an automated
firing platform.  Simply climb the hill jumping the laser blasts as you go
once at the the top keep hitting the fire button and jumping as the turret
gets to the top of the platform.  Farther into this level you encounter a
series of rising platforms.  When you get to them be very careful as you
jump automatically onto them, one wrong move and disappear into the depths
losing all your weapons and you cant get them back.

One at the top you will come against four circular sawblades keep shooting
and keep moving.  The main thing at this stage is to keep them little legs
moving as the sawblades home in on your position.  After dealing with
these you will be faced with more saws - only larger.  These run on tracks
fixed to the wall. These blades can be disposed of without loss of life
simply by moving to the left of the screen.  Once there, fire at the saw
moving towards you.  When it passes move to the right of the screen to
avoid the blade coming the opposite way.  Once that has passed move back
to the left and carry on in the same way until the first saw-blade has
been destroyed.  Now move to the right of the screen and position yourself
just left of the small platform and fire diagonally towards the  central
Eye.  When the second sawblade has been destroyed the Eye will start
shooting so blast as fast as possible before his bullets meet you.

                                 LEVEL 3

In general the same rule applies to the armoured vehicles as in the first
level. Just be careful of the bombs they throw at you upon their demise.
You will eventually climb into a beautiful sunset, don't be fooled by it's
tranquillity - jump right and hug that corner, a whole flight of Jet
fighters here fly past in formation, a signal to your destruction?

If you picked the right weapon from the last shop you will be as safe as
houses.  You will need the Shower bomb keep low and try and score a direct
hit with your bombs as this kills them off a lot quicker.  Once they are
all destroyed strut your funky stuff to the next level.

                                 LEVEL 4

When you see the Helicopter concentrate on dodging the bullets you can't
kill it off!  When you meet Mr Flame go down the ladders to him firing
diagonally down and left this will kill all the beams except one.  Once
you have shot that from the  bottom, shoot him and away you go.

                                 LEVEL 5

Keep your cool and don't panic.  If you picked force field from the last
shop you will find this level a little easier.  Be very careful and time
the blades to go over you.

                                 LEVEL 6

Start blasting the ship as soon as you see it! a few well placed Shower
Bombs soon helps it on its way "down to the merky bottom"!

                                   Hints

The objective is to seal all the doors off in the tower without getting
killed.   Use your squirt gun to kill the ghosts and dragons.  If you kill
them you will get a bottle or a key.  The key lets you in the door and the
bottle refills your squirt gun.

IN THE MAZE: The object of this is to get the hammer, nails, and boards
without getting killed by the minotaur.  The blue spots are where the
minotaurs are produced, so move quickly over these areas.  The bomb kills
all minotaurs on the screen and gives you a bonus of one thousand points.
The heart gives you your lives back if you have lost any.  The spring makes
your hammer rebound of walls and helps to hit the minotaurs better.

The "P" makes you invincible to the minotaurs temporarily.  The skull will
kill you so don't touch it; also the ladder is the way out.  Don't leave
until you have the hammer, nails, and boards!

THE BUBBLE ROOM: The object is to keep hitting the bubbles with your hammer
by throwing it down.  Also, don't get hit by the ghost and hit the ghost
with your hammer.  If the bubble keeps hitting the floor then it eventually
will cause holes.  Try not to fall in them.  If you do than you will be put
back in the tower and the door won't be sealed.

Keep sealing the doors.  If you run out of keys kill the dragons and ghosts
to get some.  After you've sealed all the doors go to the top floor with the
big tarantula and into the gate. You will then fight the witch who will
shoot fireballs at you.  Jump up and duck down to avoid them.  Meanwhile you
should be trying to chuck your hammers at her.

Having got the BEAST running, the best place to stay is the paint control
area with the three dials and flush chain.  Moving up and down, try to
position the scroll so that you can see both the colour in the paint trough
AND the toy moulds in use.  This way you can make sure that you've mixed the
right colour for the right toy.

If you're not careful, a couple of toys can be painted incorrectly when the
moulds change.  With good timing, you need never waste one.  If your BEAST
is set up correctly, the first part of a toy to go in for painting should
always be the body.  When you see the moulds being changed, run to the
required paint dial (or flush chain, if necessary) and wait.  You should see
the last head from the 'old' toy being pushed out of the mould and enter the
bin on the right of the screen.  Then the first body of the 'new' toy should
be thrown into the left bin.  As the 'old' toy's head drops down the paint
spray jets, quickly make all the paint changes needed.  By the time the jets
react, the toy head should have passed through and been painted the correct
colour, while the jets are now ready to spray the new colour on the new
body.

Lemmings and lawyers are a pain.  Keep jumping and they won't get you.  In
the later levels, the lemmings start meddling with the BEAST, unscrewing
bolts and flushing the paint trough.  Leave flytraps beneath the area at
risk to deal with that problem.

From level 14 onwards there's a bonus for getting the toys in the correct
packing crates.  However, it is JUST a bonus and it's quite small, so it's
not really worth the time wasted leaving the vital paint control area.
Concentrate on getting the correctly-coloured toy quota instead.

This will explain how to get started and get you to the first dungeon you
need to explore.

                                  FIRST

You are standing in front of a KEY. Thats right, the big chunk of silver
on the ground in front of you! CLICK on PICK and then move the hand over
the glob of metal on the floor (KEY) and CLICK again to add it to your
inventory.

                                  SECOND

MOVE WEST either with your joystick or click on [ W ] in the direction box
in the lower middle portion of the screen. You will be standing in front
of an huge oak door.  CLICK on USE and drag the hand over to the little
keyhole located in the center of this menacing door.  I know you have been
sweating up till now, but you can grab a towel because the door in front
of you should be open by now.

                                  THIRD

MOVE NORTH to exit the gigantic tower you were stuck in all this time!
Soon you will be standing in front of a tree.

                                  FOURTH

When you are starting in the forest, you will be facing NORTH-WEST.  Every
time you MOVE EAST you will be facing one more cardinal direction in the
direction you move.  I.E.- If you are facing NORTH and you MOVE EAST, you
will now be facing NORTH EAST.  If you move EAST again, you will be facing
EAST.

MOVE EAST and MOVE EAST again.  You should be facing an open path in the
forest.  MOVE NORTH (also means FORWARD) or push up on your joystick until
you find a pack of sticks lying on the ground (ARROWS!).  CLICK on PICK
and move the hand over to the picture of the arrow pack.  CLICK on the
arrows and they will be added to your inventory.  If you ever want to get
some detailed information about the objects, move the arrows located to
the right of the object window either up or down to select object, then
click in INFO and move the hand over to the object in the window.  You
will now be in the info selection screen.  You can now check how much
weight something is and what quantity of that object you have left.

These are the first few steps you should do to get you started in this
relatively simplistic game.  Now just roam around the forest and pick up
any objects you may find in the forest.  When you see archers or knights
you may want to TALK with them first.  You may also trade with them by
clicking on INFO and then click on the figure in front of you.  It will
display information about the character and you can click on trade and
then the object you wish to trade. You will want to find the woman who
gives you the keys (needed for Drakehurst's Castle).

Then you will want to get the blue gem from the woman in the upper part of
the forest as well.  After you supply up, find the road that leads to the
Eldon Mines.  You will have to run and jump over arrows in this sequence
but when you get to the end, you enter the dungeon of the mines.

                                  Hints

FOOTMEN: These aren't that difficult to deal with and a good thump with
the mace should sort them out good and proper.  Try to attack them when
you are in the 'duck' position, to avoid a good kicking and a dented head.

WIZARDS: They are the rotters who lob power bolts in your direction.  Now,
doubtless another wizard or mage would simply say "Pah. Feeble magic." and
bung back an even bigger power bolt that wouldn't look out of place in a
Spielburg movie.  You aren't such a wizard, so unless you have picked up a
Demon Shield or Magic Demon weapon to chuck at him, the best thing to do
is run away.

SPEARMEN: They are the chaps who come strolling onto the screen, whizz a
huge spear in your direction and then, with nothing else to do, probably
wander off to pick their nose or count their toes or something.  The best
thing to do, you won't be suprised to hear, is either duck, climb a ladder
or jump to another ledge to avoid the spear.  Also be careful not to jump
into the path of a spear, as it glides across the whole length of the
screen with ease.

MINES: Not much to do in the old tactical department here.  I mean, it's
not as if you could take a mine on in unarmed combat, duff it up and
stroll off while it begs for mercy in a corner.  The best thing to do is
simply avoid them, picking a different route wherever possible.  If you
are getting a severe kicking, however it might be worth leaping onto one
although your energy level will plummet, all your assailants will be
blasted into a thousand chicken McNuggets - serves 'em jolly well right
too.

CANNONS/BLASTERS: Very similar in action and effect, these two.  Cannons
bung balls at your legs while Blasters aim for the head.  The best way to
take them out of action is to charge and hit them with your mace.  Once
out of commission, the crew stand around like so much mace fodder, so it's
happy slapping time again with your mace flying everywhere.  Once a level
has been cleared of cannons and blasters, you can leap around the nearby
ledges, creeping up behind the other enemy posts and knocking them out one
by one.  Don't use the Magic Demon spell, though, because there's every
chance that a falling cannon could fall on you.

RIDERS: Riders all share the same characteristics in that they charge at
you and attempt to squash you.  They include Boat Riders, Carpet Riders
and Cavalry.  If you can use a Demon Shield or Magic Demon spell on them,
save yourself a lot of bother and do so, keeping as far away as possible.
Carpet Riders and Cavalry can be knocked off from a distance by arrows or
Naptha bombs but once the transporter has been trashed, you then have to
give the occupants a good bashing.  Towers are big and require two or
three well placed arrow shots or mace hits before they are ripped apart.

LEVEL 1: Jump on the fire hydrants to reveal cherries.  On the third fire
hydrant, go to the right then walk against it.  Your pacman will now be
wearing a blue cap, which means the little ghosts dropped from the planes
can now be turned inti 200 points on every hit.  Jump over a car coming from
the right, wait until it turns around, jump on top of it as it moves to the
left, and you will find no more ghosts appear on the screen.  To pick up a
bonus at the end of the level, jump when the "E" of "TIME" appears.

LEVEL 2: Jump on top of each cactus to get the cherries.  Finish off in the
same manner as level 1.

LEVEL 3: Keep your finger on the jump button to reach the end of the logs
easily.  Run fast at the springboard and jump when you see the springs
pressed.  Tap the joystick to the right to get over the pool.

LEVEL 4: Just sit back and watch the computer take over.

LEVEL 5 and 6: These are easy with the boots as you go back over the
previous two levels.  At the end of level 4, jump on the last step to get a
bonus.  At the end of 5, jump when you see the whole of your wife in the
picture.

LEVEL 7: Watch out for the double decker busses, but if you do the same car
trick as in level 1, you'll have a clear ride.  Jump at the end when "E"
appears.

LEVEL 8: This is all swimming pools.  Just wiggle like mad and hope!

                                   Hints

JUNGLE: You can memorize the route through the jungle.  If you hear a shot,
jump fast.  You are being shot at from off screen.  You can kill the
underground snipers by using grenades, better yet, just jump over them.
Another idea is to shoot three or four shots when changing screens, just in
case.

BRIDGE: When you have placed the explosives on the bridge, wait beside the
second bridge and shoot any enemy that pops up.  A package will be deposited
and if you get it, a hit point will be removed from you and your morale will
go up.

VILLAGE: Ignore the first three huts.  Go into the fourth hut and kill the
soldier hiding there.  Search to the right side of the sack of rice and you
will find a trapdoor.  Go down to the TUNNEL.

TUNNEL: Keep an eye on the map and use it!  The top left room contains the
Captain you will want to kill him and get the flairs.  Then exit at the
lower right side.  Keep shooting but in short bursts.  Ammo is very hard to
find here.  Keep moving!

BUNKER: Throw a flare and start shooting the enemy.  Use the flares as much
as possible, and watch the waste of bullets.

JUNGLE2: Shoot, shoot, shoot.  Time is short, the easiest route out is go
left and right alternately.

SGT BARNES: Get the box, avoid the sergeant.  Best to keep throwing grenades
and start moving in closer.

                                   Hints

You don't have to conqueror all 195 territories to win the game; you just
have to go from the top left of the main map down to the bottom right.
Picking a route going approximately diagonally down the big map is
obviously the shortest way to go, but of course when we designed the
worlds we realised this and put some real toughies in your way.

If you do happen to meet a particually tough land, consider going around
this terrortory and find an easier one.

If you start a terrortory with more than one computer opponent, watch what
they do.  If they start attacking each other they have been set up in a
state of war.  Pick your side carefully and make an alliance with the
better side (by clicking on the hands icon on the left side and then
selecting one of his villages).  This enables you to use all of his
resorces, such as food and equiptment.  Be careful if you break the
allience, though, since he'll then tend to pick up your villages to
attack.  Also, he has the capacity to break the allience as well, so don't
trust him too much.

When you first start into a territtory, check how many men are under your
command.  Click on some of these troops to see if they are using any
weapons.

Beware whenever you attack towns which have been inventing weapons.  The
people from these towns try to pick up the weapons from their workshop
before engaging you in battle.

If a town has weapons, try to ambush the people when they are far from the
town.  this stops them picking up the weapons.

Sometimes its worth inventing rather than attacking.  Bear in mind thet a
person equipped with a pike can kill as many as two people holding
nothing, and someone armed with a sword kills as many as three people
holding nothing.  A bow means its user can kill from a distance, and
cannons and caterpults are deadly.

If you have invented bows, its a good idea to have an army equipped half
with bows, and half with other weapons.

Bear in mind that a characters strength in hand to hand combat depends on
his age and how much he likes you.  This also applies to the power of the
bowmen.

It takes a very long tome to produce a cannon or a catapult; but if the
town thats in the process of making one is defeated, the stage the cannon
was at is saved, so the victor has less time to wait for the finished
weapon.

Don't be afraid to run away from a battle if things start looking bad for
you.

Never let the king wander around with less than four men; he is often
picked on and killed by unfriendly villagers.

It's a good idea to get at least one town with a workshop early on in the
game.

                                   Hints

1. Standing next to an object to pick it up is`t good enough - you have to
be right in front of it.

2. The red light to the right of and below pocket one will light up when
you enter a screen where there is something hidden.

3. A very important point - save the game regulary!

4. Search packing cases after killing the droids.

5. In the room containing the booby-trap, search the unit to the left of
the one that expoldes.  Here you will find a detonating device.  Pull the
red wire to disarm it.

6. Search the unit to the right to find explosives.

7. Drop the exploves on the rubble blocking the door, remembering to get
out of the way when it goes off.

8. Jump two mines and one hole to find the room containing the stooge.

9. Trade the jewel found under the bed for a vending token.

10. Wear a tie and go to the night club to find a plank.

11. Place the plank on the edge of the large hole and jump the gap.

12. Put the token in the vending machine, choose inner city as the
destination and take the ticket to the guard.

13. Find plug two and take it up the first lift to open the door.  Get
plug three to open the locked door on the first level.

14. Take an object and wonder around the park until you meet a stooge.

15. Go to the agreed place at the correct time while carrying another
object and swap it for the combination.  Enter the vault and collect
the credit.

16. Go south-west from the bank and search near the dustbin.

17. Go past the teleport to find something useful.

18. Take it to the secretary and insert it.  I know it sounds rude, but
that`s what you do!

19. Go up in the lifts and search there.  Use credit to teleport to next
screen.

20. Find the vibe-o-mat and the fuel.  Arm it and drop it near the row
of mines now take the right hand lift in the building and search there.

21. Find the room with a grille placed in the left hand wall.  Fill
the torch and burn away the gille.

I encountered a problem while trying to exit through the steel door of the
fortress.  If you try to exit without wearing your rubber gloves the screen
will show a few glitches, then there will be a disk access where then the
title screen reappears.  Then another disk access where it loads for a while
then grey and red garbage covers the screen and the game is ruined.

After hours and hours of play testing it, I found that if you don't go
directly through the door but touch it near the side, Rambo will let out a
scream, and a message will appear saying you've been executed, which makes
sense, because we were not wearing our gloves.  So after much time roaming
every possible inch of the playfield, I encountered a yellow/red/gray plaque
on the wall in a far room from the start.  These are the gloves, I went back
to the steel door and walked into it, and passed to the next level.

Remember to just wear your gloves before touching the high voltage door.

Leave your finger on the fire button at all times.

When your picking up the power chips for the drone, keep the reflecting
lasers.

When you have the drone, use it the way it was designed for, ramming and
absorbing bullets.

LEVEL 1: Stay back, be patient and pick up upgrades for your drone.  Its
best to have the relecting lasers.  Watch for the creatures that try and
sneak up behind you and the big robots.  The red monster can be dealt with
by shoving your drone up its stomach and keep firing.  In fighting the
rotating guns, get in, blow the blue gun and get out as fast as possible or
try to go up as you approach, shoot at the blue gun emplacement.  Hit it and
it will start a chain reaction.

LEVEL 2: Use reflected lasers to handle the tadpoles.  Go reverse clockwise
around the first worm and hide at the bottom left corner of the mother.
Then jump to a position just above the eye and shoot away.  Move up to avoid
the third worm.

LEVEL 3: Go low, hugging the dirt and be patient and lay back.  Go forward
at the last minute to the next gap and then immediately move forward again.
Bring the drone to the back of your ship.

1. Getting past the wolf - Do the obvious thing and remember: if at first
you don't succeed...

2. The Wandering Monk - He might be in the mood for a little conversation
and doesn't he look a bit thin?

3. The First Monastery - It pays to be generous. Butter them up a little.

4. The Second Monastery - The answer to this one just scrolled right past
you!

5. The Monk's First Question - The answer is monstrous.  Anyone seen George
around lately?

6. The Monk's Second Question - The answer to this one is hard to give a
hint for; you really have to know something about Eastern religion.  If you
happen to know the names of the male and female principles, that's the
answer.  Check out the wall in the monk's room for a symbol.

7. The Monk's Third Question - The answer is not Sophia Loren, think about
that for a while!

8. The Dragon's First Question - Judy Garland could probably tell you the
answer to this riddle. (No, it isn't the Yellow Brick Road!)

9. The Dragon's Second Question - The answer to this one is just heavenly.

                      Landscape one and two solution.

Before you leave the hut, pick up the pebbles and the bowl, and then head
through the north door.  Shoot any bandits that get in the way and pick up
anything they leave behind.  Find the old man to the north and listen to
his wisdom.  In places you'll find trees with red berries on them which
are healthy to eat.

Go to the eastern exit and enter, pass through it to eastern caila.  Head
south and you find a mole hill which contains the back door key to the
house.  Go back to siuthern Caila and fill the bowl with water.  Re-enter
eastern Caila and head towards a pair of closely spaced trees.  They let
you through if you have water.

Northern Taira can now be entered.  In the north west corner you'll find
the bandit leader. Shoot him and pick up the map he was carrying.  Go to
the east exit of northern Taira and you enter western Caila.  You find a
peasants hut, containing some useful items including a mouldy old lump of
cheese.  This can be used to distract the mice creatures, and they'll let
you through the exits they guard.

Chances are you'll have fought a good few bandits by now and picked up
extra weapons.  A staff is needed to kill the two headed at the north of
western Caila.  It drops a circlet of concentration when deceased. Return
to the old man and he rewards you with a potion to find the hidden pass in
the south west corner of northern Taira.  It's represented by two closely
spaced stones.  Once you're into southern Taira you have only to find the
magic tree at the centre and you're to the next kingdom.

When you arrive you meet Prince Gregor.  Travel east or south to another
landscape and the enterance to the dwarven caves at the southern extreme
of both landscapes.  You need a lantern to climb down, dropped by a dwarf
when you shoot near the enterance.

Enter the caverns and head south.  You find the spiders lair in the second
cave, pick up a rope to allow escape from the caves.  Go to the throne
room of the dwarf king, to the side of the next southern cave.  Kill him
and grab the princes crown. Go back and give the crown to the prince who's
waiting at the cave enterance.  As a reward you are given some gold.

Return to the caves and head for the southern exit.  There's another
molehill in the landscape which contains a belt of lung capacity.

Combined with the poison darts and blow pipe, which you're bound to have
come across by now, these make a very lethal weapon.  Travel south and you
encounter a fountain in southern Sylvar.  This takes you into landscape
number three...

Dont use the scanner, although it's nice to know what's waiting for you
when you enter a room, it also gives the aliens the chance to move in and
attack you.

It's a good idea to keep your squad fairly tight.  Stragglers make easy
targets.  However, don't bunch them too tightly together.  Set off a booby
trap and, if Lady Luck rolls the die against you, the whole squad could be
wiped out in one fell swoop.

The bolter-carrying marine is the least effective member of the team and
is fairly expandable.  Use him as a scout to open doors and the like.

The commander is naturally the hardest geezer in your swuas of marines, so
use him wisely.  For a start, when tooling him up give him a powerfist and
a powersword.  Although this means he can't engage in any long-range
combat because he had no gun or missile launcher, it does make him super-
powerful in hand-to-hand battles and when the aliens start amassing this
can be areal life saver for all concerned.

Your commander has six hit points and so can afford to lose one.  Your
grunts, howeverm with their measly one hit point, can't.  In a big
firefight with a gang of marauding orcs or gretchins, place your command
in between your marines and the aliens to absorb some of the shots and
protect the boys.

On retrieval missions, always use your commander to pick up the object.
Give ti to a grunt and chances are he'll get killed before you get off
ship.

Melta bombs are by far the most effective one-off weapon available.  Use
it to fry a Dreadnough or any other tough cookies encountered.

If you're exploring and you come across a bunch of monsters, make sure you
mop them all up before moving on.  A feeble little gretchin, left to its
own devices, can decimate a squad if the dice rolls are in its favour.

In a room packed with aliens use a Blind Grenade and, if possible, a Fire
Order card - this should wipe them out in no time at all.  This technique
is particularly handy on Level 2.

Missile launchers are excellent for mass alien slayings.  If there's a
whole bunch of them standing together fire the missile between them - with
good aiming and luck on your side you could wipe them all out in one go.
Remember to use targetters with missile launchers and power guns.

                                What to do

TISRON: Take the guided mine in the third screen from the right (to get it
you must go through trade).

ERINA: Place the mine in front of the big droid - after the explosion,
pick up the fallen circuit, which now has to be placed in the centre of
the drive circuit - a new system will appear on the card.

SKEVIS: Pick up the magnetic card, it contains the Cassandra access code
in Centaurian.

SKAVER: Go to see the magician.

XYLOGNA: Kill the thief who stole the spell (alien), then go back to
skaver to return the spell to the magician.  To thank you, he will teach
you his psychic powers which will be essential to you on Cassandra.

ENDROMA: Recover the XMT-03BK gun, the destroyer of Cephalhydras.

CASSANDRA: Thanks to the two magnetic cards, you will be able to find the
following access  code: Sigmund.  Here you need to eliminate the
Cephalhydras with the XMT-03BK.

OUT OF FUEL: Send an SOS message and wait for help - the cost will be
deducted automatically.

ALIEN INTRUSION: Go to the circuitry rooms to kill them - be careful, each
time the bell rings another alien reproduces itself.

TRADE: Rarer commodities are traded between planets of differant types
(for example grain or water in the desert, metals in town).  Starblade
stocks can be used to transport goods in large quantities.

                                THE LITTLE RAMP

This is easy, all you have to do is take the ramp at no less then 130MPH.
However, the hump shouldn't be taken at more than 200MPH, otherwise you
lose a lot of time in the air.


                                 THE HUMP BACK

Take the first hump at any speed up to around 130MPH.  There are two
options available when negoting the bumpy straight that follows;

1) Take a sedate pace of under 150MPH.

2) Put your foot down and rocket through at over 200MPH.  Keep your foot
down for the next hump but slow down for the straight, since there is a
sharp bend.  Once past the final bend ignite the boosters and sprint to
the line.


                                  DIVISION 3

                              THE STEPPING STONES

The ramps on the first length should be taken at either over 200MPH or
under 150MPH.  in order to attain a smooth landing after the next ramp,
make sure that you are travelling around 150MPH.  Meanwhile take the
stepping stones at between 140MPH and 175MPH.  Finally, when you have
cleared the last turn, race to the front line.


                                 THE BIG RAMP

Race at top speed around the course; except for the two small ramps, which
should be taken at between 160MPH and 180MPh.  The huge ramp should be
taken at over 210MPH.


                                  DIVISION 2

                                 THE HIGH JUMP

In order to clear this you must be racing at over 200MPH.  Otherwise, the
angled straight should be taken at around 170MPH and the rest of the track
at full speed.


                               THE ROLLERCOASTER

The largest hill should be taken at a maximum speed of 160MPH.  Stay at
that speed until you are three-quaters of the way down, then open the
throttle for the rest of the track.


                                  DIVISION 1

                                 THE SKI JUMP

Start thr race and stay at about 30MPH until you reach the end of the
third straight.  Accelerate, remembering the Ski Jump must be taken at
over 200MPH.


                                THE DRAWBRIDGE

This track is pretty easy to complete.  Attempt the drawbridge at around
140MPH and pelt round the rest of the course at full speed.

                                     Hints

In the speedshop,acceleration and top speed are most important, but you
don't get full effect unless you have decent tyres.

Staying on the track with all four wheels is important,so some shocks will
come in handy after a few races.They help to decrease the effect of the
bumps on the tracks.

Sometimes its better to take the long route around a bump,just to keep the
speed up,especially if you have low acceleration.

If you can,try to cut the corners around the track - the computer
controlled trucks usually take the slightly longer but safer routes.  Try
to avoid hitting walls as large amounts of time are lost by careless
driving.

Use nitros wisely.  There's not much point in firing a nitro at a corner
and banging straight into a wall.  They are most effective when used on a
long straight.

Dont use nitros with other trucks directly in front of you, they will get
more benefit from the knock on effect than you will get from the nitro.
It's better to stay behind cars than trying to force your way past them at
tricky parts of the track, you will normally end up worse off anyway.

Remember, Ironman is the fastest and craftiest computer truck, so he`s the
one to concentrate on, although to survive a race you must beat ALL of the
other computer controlled trucks.

The computers trucks, Ironman especially, get upset if you beat them by
too much in a race and jazz up their trucks accordingly for the next race
- so try not to beat them by too large a margin.

                                   Cheat

When the game has loaded select your control method at the options screen as
usual.  Instead of going to Start Game press Esc.  Wait for the high score
chart with the picture of the T-1000 to appear.  As soon as the last digit
is printed on the high score chart (the last 0 on the 10000, in 10th place),
click the left mouse button (or the joystick fire button if that`s plugged
into port one).

You must click the button 0.19 seconds after the last digit on the score
chart has been printed on the screen.  If you take longer, or click before
the last digit is printed, the cheat will not work, so precise timing is
required.  If you find this difficult, there is an alternative.  Hold down
Fire at the high score table until it is finished.  This won`t always work
though.  Go back to the options screen.  If you can see the picture of
Arnie, but no options are displayed, then the cheat has worked.

Left click on the mouse (or joystick) to move on.  Click again to skip the
high score display.  If you allow the high score chart to be printed again
the game may mess up.  Start the game.

If the cheat doesn`t work (the option screen is printed as normal) press Esc
and try again on the high score chart - your timing was probably not
accurate.  It is very difficult I can usually only do it one time out of
five, so keep on trying.

Once you`ve got the cheat to work and started the game, you will notice
(after the writing has finished) that a gunpowder and energy reading is
displayed for player two even though he isn`t active.  Now pause the game
(press P not F1) and type in all the function keys in order (F1, F2, F3,
F4, F5, F6, F7, F8, F9 and F10) and you should skip the level you are
presently playing.

The only disadvantage about this is that you will not be able to play in
two-player mode when the cheat is active.

This will get you to the next gas station in Test Drive II.

From what I can tell it can be typed in from almost anywhere.  It works when
you are at a gas station, when you are stopped, when you are moving (if you
type it when you are moving, type fast or make sure you are on a straight
stretch of road with nothing in front of you).

All you have to do is type the following:

aerf_____,bruce____6outran_____bgasst____l

NOTE: The underline characters represent spaces.  The are 5 spaces after
aerf.  DO NOT TYPE THE UNDERLINES - just the space bar (For those of you
with blurry vision the above underline characters represent the following
amount of spaces: 5 spaces, 4 spaces, 5 spaces, 4 spaces).  If the text
between the ()'s confuses you just pretend it is not there.

The above will not make you invincible.  It will only advance you the the
upcoming gas station.  Your average MPH will be reflected accordingly.

If you type the above from a gas station you will have a very low MPH and,
therefore, a very low score.  If you are brave and know the track you can
type it when you are hauling and get a very high score for that section.
Remember, if you type it when you are moving you can still crash, go off
the road, etc.

When the Werewolf appears you have only one move to get rid of him, so go to
another location immediately.

When a giant Eagle appears which transports you to another location in the
game, you must start your game over at your last save position, so save your
game frequently.

If you have loaded your gun with the silver bullet and the Werewolf appears:
"Shoot Werewolf" and he makes no problems in this adventure.

In the castle, if you meet the Vampire, just show the cross to him and then
drop the cross.

                                   Hints

ZINC: Stay near the middle until you are safely past the rows of metero
deflectors at the cente of the ship. The landing field is toward the bottom
of the screen.

LEAD: Start your run at the bottom of the screen.  Once you've gone by the
first bunch of obstacles, fly to the top and it's clear sailing straight to
the landing field.

COPPER: Fly midscreen and then go down. When you pass a wall of deflectors,
move to the toop of the screen. You'll pass another wall with just one
opening in it. Go down, pass more deflectors, and then move up a bit to make
you landing.

SILVER: Stay near the bottom of the screen until yoyu clar the rows of
communications antennae, and then move to themiddle for an easy landing.

IRON: As with Silver, begin at the bottom and move up when you are beyond
the antenna. Stay exactly in the middle until you are through the corridor
of deflectors, and then do a 90 degree roll and fly near the bottom through
the small gap in the deflector wall.  Reduce your speed and land on the
field, which is at the top of the screen right behind the wall.

GOLD: Fly midway between the top and middle of the screen, slowly skirting
the horizontal wall of deflectors. With a flick of a wrist, you should be
able to drop down, reverse direction, and reverwe direction again. Next, go
all the way to the top of the screen.  The landing field is close to the top
of the screen.

PLATINUM: Try flying this level entirely on your side. For this ship yhou
ned to fly rapidly down, up to the middle, back down, just above the
bottom,a nd up to the middle.

In the fuel rod chambers, try to feel the rhythms of the flashing lights.
When the lights are going by too quickly, click on quit or just close lyour
eyes.  If you just can't seem to get the rhythm, closing your eyes at least

                                   Hints

BOMBS:  The cheapest weapons you can buy.  You need to keep them in good
supply for when you enter somewhere like the forest, and start to fall down
a great height.  As you fall, drop a couple of bombs, to make sure that
anything nasty is killed.  They are also handy for destroying Birds.

BOLAS: A little more expensive than bombs, but nevertheless fairly useful.
It normally takes three hits from a bolas to destroy most baddies.

FIRE SPRITE: A brilliant weapon.  These home in on your adverseries, and are
best kept for the end-of-level guardians.  It normally takes 12 hits for a
fire sprite to dispatch any end-of-level guardian.

STUN: This freezes youe enemies for a few seconds, but is a bit expensive.
Its only realy useful when you initially enter the chamber of an end-of-
level guardian, allowing you to get into position before letting rip with
the fire sprites.

POTIONS: Very expensive.  If you are rolling in cash, buy one.

GLIDE: Useful when there are a lot of vanishing platforms about.

CLOAK: Makes you invincible for 30 seconds.  Buy whenever you can.

SPEED: Only useful when you're trying to escape from fast moving baddies.

HEARTS: A good buy, but always check how much energy you need, and what
price before buying.

EXTRA LIFE: The mist important thing to buy.

SHIELDS: A total waste of money, unless you've got money to burn.  Otherwise
save up and buy the Sword instead.

SWORD: Expensive, but well worth it!  If you can afford it, buy the top of
th range model.  Though it dosen't acturly kill enemies any quicker, its
longer than Brians daggerso there's less chance of enemies getting close.

                               Quick Solution

The method detailed in this listing, to completing the game, should only
be viewed as the quickest way, and therefore will vary greatly from the
way the game was originally meant to be played.

1) The first step to be taken is to send the ring-bearer to some safe
location away from the clutches of the Nazguls.  I have found that sending
the ring bearer to the west is probably the safest place.

2) Nothing much can be done at this stage until Saurons army is on the
move.  Once you gain control of the forces of good the first moves that
must be made are those concerning the Rohirrim, displayed as horse icons.
Send all of the Rohirrim to Edoras, this will give you a large army which
will be needed to defend against massive attacks from Orcs and Uruk-Hai.
Should Edoras fall to the forces of Sauron then his victory will be
assured and the game will end in your defeat.

3) From this point on it would be advisable to save the game frequently as
one wrong move, or a battle that goes wrong will ensure victory for
Sauron.

4) Send all of the forces of good (except the Rohirrim) to Mt.Doom or
Barad-Dur, remembering that more and more forces will become available to
you as the game progresses.  You will find that the forces of good will
find their own way there and in there own time, this will probably mean
that large losses may be sustained by you as your forces may appear to be
spread pretty thinly.  Meanwhile in Mordor, Saurons army should be
spreading across the map, this means that if you are careful you can avoid
confrontations and reach Mordor in pretty much one piece.

5) If things have gone according to plan the 10,000 Orcs encountered at
the Morannon gates should have been overcome by the forces of good
continually arriving there, if however large forces of Orcs are still
present it may be worth trying to go over the mountains.  Once sufficient
forces have entered Mordor it only becomes necessary to overcome the
5,000 Orcs at Mt.Doom.  If after Mt.Doom is captured and you still have
large forces available you can try over running Barad-Dur, but I found
surrounding it much easier as the game at this point is almost complete.

6) To finish the game all that is now required is to get the ring to
Mt.Doom.  The quickest way to do this is to send the ringbearer to the
nearest encampment of Orcs, poor Frodo gets killed and a Nazgul is
summoned to return the ring to Sauron.  Nazguls don't sleep so the
journey to Barad-Dur will not take very long, the only thing that you
must ensure to do is to intercept the Nazgul with the forces that are
surrounding Barad-Dur.  Once you are in possession of the ring take it
to the now Orc free Mt.Doom.  That is all that is needed to end the game
on a winning note!

                                  Solution

First get Alex to drop the helicopter keys by the heicopter, there's no
point in carrying them around with you and it will enable you to carry one
more usefull object.

Choose one of the characters and go down to the security room on the
second floor, pick up the set of keys and make your way to the list, don't
bother getting any weapons and don't stop to kill any zombies.

Use the keys and now you will be able to go up to the fourth floor (drop
the keys in the lift, you don't need them anymore).  Leave the lift and
you will now be in the main control room, and here you will find three
different keys on the floor, each one of the three will start one of the
lorries, enabling you to move them.

Via the lift now make your way back down to first floor and go to each of
the lorries and using the keys move them infront of the various entrances
to the shopping centre.  The only problem is now that your character will
not be able to get back inside.  Choose another one of characters and send
them down to the sports shop on the third floor, get the rope, and then go
to the balcony above the front entrance on level two, use the rope and
your other character will climb up and onto the balcony away from danger.
Get one of your characters to get the fuse, the rubber glove and a gun,
and make another character to get the torch, take them in the lift to the
basement and get the person with the torch to use it so when you exit the
lift you'll be able to see where you are.

Both go round to the fusebox and after you've disposed of any zombies get
the character with the rubber glove to use it and insert the fuse into the
fuse box.  Now using yet another character go to the forth floor and press
the buttons on the computer to activate the lights in the basement.

This is where operation zombi kill starts.  Get one of the characters to
go round each of the levels destroying all zombies he meets and then stick
all the zombies in the cold store (if you use the tape from the video shop
with the TV and video in the rental shop you'll see that you have to shoot
the zombies in the head to kill them).  If you now go down to the main
entrance you will see that some thugs have moved the lorry and have made
their way inside.

Getting the fuel can (level three), a gun (level two), and the hose pipe
(level one) go outside and go to the right.  Soon you will come across a
van belonging to the thugs, shoot any thugs that are by the van, and then
drop the fuel can in front of it.  Now use the hose pipe and, viola!  You
now have the precious fuel you need to fly away in the helicopter.  Get
everybody inside the helicopter and start it up with key (remember where
you left it) and the game is completed.
