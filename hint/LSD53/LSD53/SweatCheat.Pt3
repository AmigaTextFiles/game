    MEGATRAVELER I:
            
        A quick tip to gain cash.  Find a high tech world with a low law
        level and buy as many PGMP'S as possible, although there may only
        be one initially.  Then go to a lower tech, higher law level world
        and sell the merchandise.  The ideal planets are: LLUN/EFATE (When
        using the trader character on the disk you can purchase a PGMP for
        130500 credits) and STUR/EFATE (Where not only is there a PGMP
        lying on the floor NESAR the gun shop, but they can be sold for
        244500 credits).  In no time at all and with a little cost (because
        you are staying within the system) you will gain riches untold!

        Don't bother with the tedious procedures of recruitment, just head

        a now-buggy, the moment you hear the missile being launched, stop
        immediately and begin to turn around.  Keep turning on the spot.
        The missile will narrowly miss you then come back and keep pace
        alongside you for a while until it finally speeds off to clobber
        someone else not so smart.
        
        Invulnerablity against mortars:  Watch for the bomber.  It will
        always come over the horizon in front of you.  If you are stopped,
        wait until it is approximately half way to you (otherwise it may be
        able to dodge your missile) then blast it.  If you are moving fast
        blast it the moment it appears over the horizon.  If the bomber does
        manage to drop mortars turn 90 degrees quickly and speed off.

    NAVY MOVES:

        The access code for part 2 is-"786169"
        
        PART 1: Move back slightly when you encounter a mine.  They're much
                less sensitive from the rear.  Avoid jetski bullets by
                jumping or ducking.  When approaching sharks, move the up
                and down nut left and right.  Octopi and sea monsters are
                easily thwarted by holding down fire until both missiles are
                ignited and then releasing.  Struggle to dock with a
                submarine?  Put a mini-sub in the gap between the tailfin
                and the hull, face the left of the screen and move upwards
                slowly, the computer takes over the docking procedure for
                you.

        PART 2: The code is 948411.
        
               Arrows indicate the direction of the lifts.  Kill white
               marines and flamethrower troops to get more ammo.  Stand over
               the body and search thoroughly.  To get the code of an
               official, you must shoot him with a gun, not a flamethrower.
               To enter computer codes, stand by a terminal, push up and
               you'll be asked for a code.  Two of the codes are:  transmit
               message: 1st or 2nd transmission official open door: 1st or
               2nd machine official to open the reactor door, use the
               terminal next to the reactor.  The computer confirms the bomb
               is planted.  Go out, use the same terminal you used to open
               the door and transmit the following: "OABERYAMD".  Now type
               "END" at the ready prompt and run like hell to the conning
               tower.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    NAVY SEALS:

        pressing 'F1'-'F8' you can access any of the towers.

        `up' towers, or "BLUESHOUSE" on the `down' towers.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    NECRIS DOME:

        Type in "SPRAY SUIT" to use the Thermo-plas suit.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    NEUROMANCER:
                    
        When you first begin, sell all your body parts.  You can get along
        just fine without them for now, and it gives you enough to get a
        half way decent deck.  You will eventually need to buy them back
        before you start entering cyber-space, or you will be killed easily.

        On other versions pause the game, and press `M'.  You should hear
        a laser gun sound.  Type "MOTHERFUCKENKIWIBASTARDS".
        Unlimited lives are yours.
    
        Near the end of level 1-1 there are three large steps that you must
        climb to reach your brother (sister?), who is in a cage.  Stand at
        the left edge of the top step, facing left and jump.  But as you
        jump, fire.  If your current weapon is arrows, fire halfway up, but
        if your weapon is bombs, fire at the top of your jump.  A whirl-wind
        should appear after four hits, and it will take you to level 1-4.

        On level 1-2 shoot the baddies and collect the blue E on the floor
        to the right.  Now hop back to the point you started at and stand on
        the last two blocks on the left side of the second floor.  Shoot
        towards the left wall while doing tiny hops, and the warp will
        appear.  This will bring you to level 1-2 where there are 2 Extend
        Life Pills

        On level 1-3 from the starting position there are 12 ledges and a
        wall to the right.  Go to the other side of the wall and fire to
        the left towards the second ledge from the bottom.  Ship required.
        This will bring you to level 2-1 near the end of the round.

        In 1-4, you will be in a little box under some water.  Go up and
        to the right, and you come out in a small room with three boxes on
        the right hand side.  Go up these, and you will see 4 long spaces,
        the top one having an {N} and a {D} in it.  Go up to the top one,
        get the letters, stand in the centre of the space, facing left, and
        fire.  yep, you guessed it, another whirl-wind.  This one takes you
        to level 2-4.

        On level 2-1 above your kiwi friend is a small tunnel which takes
        you to some stair-like ledges leading to a small cavern where
        there are two fruits.  Fire at the fruit on the right.  Ship needed 
        to reach tunnel.  This brings you to level 3-4.

        On level 2-2 find a balloon and float up to where the bears on
        balloons emerge. Stand to the right of the green left-pointing
        arrow and shoot the bears balloons away. Repeat this until the warp
        appears.  This brings you to the end of level 2-2.

        On level 2-2 there is a ledge with a green arrow pointing right.
        Jump up into the water.  This takes you to level 2-2 halfway
        through the level.

        On level 2-3 follow the first water you come to.  At the end are
        two ledges with spikes below.  Stand on one ledge and fire at the
        other.  This takes you to level 2-3 takes you halfway through the
        level.

        On level 2-4 , stand at the entrance to the room where the giant
        octopus is located and fire to the right several times.  A warp will
        appear that will take you to the beginning of level 3-1.

        On level 4-1 above the Extend Life Pills is a tunnel.  Fire above
        the 2nd letter from the right.  You must be on a duck ship for it to
        work.  This brings you to level 4-2.

        On level 4-4 below the kiwi to the left are some spikes.  Stand on
        the left hand side of them and using small jumps fire to the right.
        This brings you to level 5-1.

        When you reach the ice whale, move to the right-hand side of the
        spikes, avoid the crystals, and wait until he picks you up.  Once
        inside the whale, you can start shooting, but avoid the ice drops.

        Meeting the rock monster without bombs makes him difficult to pass.
        So collect bombs, go to the highest platform and shoot him.  Kill it
        by either dodging the bullets and hitting it when the doors open, or
        by fireballs.

        The last boss you encounter is the balloon seal.  He cant be killed,
        by blows to the body, so you must hit the balloon.  Be careful for
        the balloon seal is armed with a cannon and shoots cannon balls at
        Tiki.

    OPERATION LEMMINGS:

        To pick a level from which you can start from type "CYB Computers"
        in the high-score table.  Swearing at the high score table brings up
        a few messages as well.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    OPERATION THUNDERBOLT:

        On the high score table enter your name as "WIGAN NINJA", to recieve
        infinite lives.  Also if you get a score of 50,000 or more die and
        type "SPECCY MODE" on the high score table.  This will give you
        twice as many enemies.  Press 'F8', 'F7', 'F6', 'F5', 'F4', 'F3',
        'F8' and then 'F1' three times (oR 'F2' three times) ('F1' and 'F2'
        are for what player is to have the sight).  This will give you the
        laser sight thoughout the game.  Also, type "EDOM TAEHC" on the high
        score table for infinite lives.

        Usually you have to shoot equipment boxes to get the laser sight,
        but press 'F8' and fire at the same time on the title screen and you
        will start a 1 player game with laser sight. For 2 players press
        'F2' instead of 'F8' on the title screen.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    OPERATION WOLF:
                    
        At the end of a level, between the time when you kill the last
        bastard and the time appears, rolling the mouse down causes damage
        to decrease.  For the most accurate shot possible, pause the game
        with 'F1', position your crosshairs over the selected enemy,
        unpause the game, click the button and blast him to hell.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    OVER THE NET:

        First, choose a one set game, play the sea-cup and enter one team or
        two human players.  When it's your turn to serve, move the
        non-serving player up to the top of the court close to the net.
        This will force one of the computer players to follow him.  Now do a
        jump serve (push up and fire), then hit the ball to the other
        computer player by pushing right then down.  The ball should drop
        between him and the net and he should miss the ball.  Hopefully this
        plan should work.  I don't know if it works with the other teams
        like Coco, Freaks etc but it works with the Rollers and the Golden
        Boys.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    *OVERKILL AGA: (Keith Krellwitz)

        Enter "NZL" for your initials on the high score table.  When you

    OVERLANDER:
                    
        JUST A FEW TIPS - When cruising the highway don't stop shooting, and
        always choose the highest paid mission.  Buy fuel carefully, only
        enough fuel for that level, after level 1 you must buy a leanburner.
        Try to stay in the middle of the road and travel fast, travelling
        slowly only burns more fuel.  Fire bombs are more useful than smart
        bombs when you learn how to use them.  Bulletproofing is necessary
        after level 2.  When travelling through the barriers the best speed
        is 90-120mph.

        LEVEL 1:
    
            1. Select counterfeit money.
    
            2. Fuel up to 14 notches on the fuel guage.
    
            3. Get turbo, 4 battering rams and two flare bombs.
    
            4. After the first bikes slow down or the gunners will kill you.

            5. Destroy trucks from as far away as possible.

            6. Slow to 100-150 mph to negotioate barriers.

            7. If you stay in the middle lane when you come to the wrecks
               you wont die.

        LEVEL 2:

            1. Select kidnapped official.

            2. Fuel up to half full.

            3. Buy leanburner, a few bullet proofs, rams, and flare bombs.

            4. After first bikes there's a nasty surprise in the valley
               below.

        LEVEL 3: DARKLANDS

            1. Select plutonium.

            2. Fuel up to half full (if you have leanburner - if you don't
               then fill up to the max.

            3. Buy rams, bullet proofing, flare bombs and lives if you need
               them.

            4. The toughest part of the course is early on, so don't be
               afraid to let loose with the flare bombs.

        LEVEL 4: THE GUTTER RUN

            1. Select illegal chemicals. fill up to max level.

            2. Buy maximum rams, bullet proofs and as many lives as you can
               afford and flare and smart bomb depending on your bank
               balance.
            3. The barriers are every where on this level and you will need
               to be at 90 - 100 mph to avoid them all.  Try to save your
                rams for later in the level.

            4. The alleys in 4 are real mean.  Smartbombs and bullet
               proofing are your best chances of survival.

        LEVEL 5: GRAVEYARD

            1. Choose the president.  Fill up to maximum fuel.

            2. Buy everything $40,000 up front plus whatever you had from
               the last level should be enough, lives should be on the top
               of your shopping list followed by rams, proofing, brakes,
               armour and weapons - don't bother with the wheelblades!

            3. do the same as for the last level.  Because your car's at
               maximum everything, this level shouldn't proove too
               difficult.

    PACLAND:

        When the title screen appears, type "AVALON".  The screen should
        flash.  You should have unlimited lives.  If that doesn't work, try
        the following:

        Start a two player game.  Make it as far as you can with player one.
        With player two, you must be able to make it as far as the fairy to
        collect your boots.  Now that you have gotten your boots, you are
        going backwards to where you started.  Push the third cactus on the
        way back, and a yellow pacman will appear.  Get it, now kill player
        two.  Continue playing with player one.  Every time player one dies,
        get the yellow pacman with player two and kill player two
        immediately.  As long as you keep getting the yellow pacman with
        player two, player one will never die.

        HINTS:

            LEVEL 1:    Run to the third fire hydrant, and when you get
                        there, jump over it and push it to the left.  This
                        will give you a blue hat that will make you
                        invulnerable to the little ghosts that fall from
                        planes.

            LEVEL 2:    Run to the third cactus, and push it to the left.
                        You will now be invulnerable for the entire level!

            LEVEL 3:    After getting your magic boots, push the third
                        cactus on the way back for a free life.

        -Jump on the roof of ghost's car to escape.
    
        -Only use powerpills when ghosts are in range, or else it is wasted.

        -When you reach the breaktime sign, jump when you are about 1 inch
         away, for a bonus (depending how high you are when the level ends)

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    PANZA KICK BOXING:

        The best moves to use are upper cut, round house, low leg kick.  The
        low leg kick is useful for keeping your opponent out of range and on
        target for a round house followed by an upper cut.  The double
        backfist is also very poweful and often provides a knockout punch.
        If you are losing a fight, and don't have much chance of recovery,
        then press the 'ESC' key so that your stats remain intact.

    PLAYER MANAGER:

        1.  Buy a few young, cheap players and keep them in the squad for a
            whole season. Next year, their price will have increased and you
            should have no trouble selling them for a huge profit. 

        2.  Only buy players with very high agility ratings, as this effects
            all their other attributes. If agility is high (about 200),
            expect the player to become an excellent footballer, given a
            season or two. 

        3.  Remove 8 or 9 players from your team, then after 2 or 3 big
            defeats you will receive sponsorship.

        round on a secret course with you in control of the f-14 tomcat from
        afterburnner.  With no collision detection.  Do the same thing on
        course D and you will be in control of the super hang-on bike.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    POWERDROME:

        Here are some tips on the various tracks:

            Oval:   The secret with this track is to use as much afterburner
                    as possible, but without blowing up your engines.  Keep
                    your eye on the temperature gauge.  This track is fairly
                    wide, so switch the centering field OFF and pick up
                    speed.  Go around as fast as you can.

            Antacorp: A difficult track.  Turn the centering field up to
                    four or five, which will put you in the middle of the
                    course.  When you go through the underground chicane,
                    hold down the right shift key.  This will take you
                    through the vertical scanner without slowing down; then
                    straighten.

            Clortek: Shortly after the start line, you will encounter a
                    trench.  Don't waste your time flying through it; just
                    go over it.  When you reach the pressure gate, which is
                    around half way, don't slow down.  If you're going to
                    crash into it then slow down.  Hopefully this won't
                    occur, but in this instance it's no use fighting the
                    consequences.  When you come out of the exit, switch
                    the afterbunrers on.  Go for speed on this next stretch.

            Otyaka: It's main section's underground, very dark and at first
                    quite difficult.  The track careers from left to right
                    so turn the centering on at around level five.  Once you
                    emerge into the open, you'll come across a nasty right
                    hand hairpin, so hold down the centering key again.
                    This section takes some practice.

            Banzal: So named because it really is the hardest track.  Crank
                    the centering up as much as possible but reduce it down
                    to six if feasible and necessary.  You'll encounter the
                    same kind of underground dip as on the Otyaka course, so
                    use the same tactics.  If you get through this you are
                    GOOD.

            Apocalypt: This section has an alarmingly tight hairpin situated
                    three corners from the start.  Take it using centring
                    mode.  While underground you will go through a loop de
                    loop.  You get through this using gentle movements of
                    the mouse, with centring set around six.  This should
                    see you right.

            Estoria: Back into sunny climes and a fairly wide track.  Bomb
                    around the course with a low centring setting or none at
                    all.

    POWERMONGER:

        Instruct your captain to invent something, pause the game, put the
        game speed up to full, and wait a couple of minutes.  Now unpause
        the game, the captain will have kept inventing during the pause!

        When you wish to invent in double quick time, click invent and
        when your men leave, click on it again.  This often makes a
        catapult almost immediately, but this cheat only works once on
        each island.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    PREHISTORIK:

        After killing the strange turtle-like creature on the first level,
        you should come to a screen with two carnivorous fish bouncing up
        and down in the water, along with four banks.  To get to the secret
        room don't jump over the first well.  Instead jump inside it and
        fall down into the secret room!

        Later on the first level, look out for a ladder near some water
        which leads up to a platform containing an egg.  Climb the ladder
        and take the egg, then go to the left into the water to find the
        submarine room.

        There is also a way to find some hidden extra food.  Go to the
        third screen of level three and jump forward hitting empty space.
        The hidden food should now appear.

    *PUTTY: (Keith Krellwitz)

        On the high score screen after the games is over (you don't need a
        high score), type "HEADLIKEAHOLE" and press the 'ENTER' key on the
        keypad.  Use 'F1-F10' to skip levels.  This also gives you infinite
        lives.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    PUZZNIC:

        When playing the game, press the 'SPACE BAR' to bring up the retry
        screen, but don't release the 'SPACEBAR'.  All the time that it is
        held down the game will be paused and you can work out what to do
        without having to rush.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    QUADRALIEN:

                                (LEVEL CODES)

                        LEVEL 2_________________"170961"
                        LEVEL 3_________________"010655"
                        CORE  4_________________"610169"

        Tips:  Once in the core, you can't quit.  So choose droids with
        good lasers, Jack and Spud for example.  The Quadralien mother is
        made up of 4 separate pieces grouped together and surrounded by
        Earthling boxes.  The mother can only be destroyed by blowing up
        each box from a different direction.  From the starting point there
        are three exits:  north, east, and west.  Go east and destroy the
        first box, return to the starting point, and go north to destroy
        the second box.  You will now have both droids to blow the
        remaining boxes.  Go west through the one-way force field, and get
        the other.  Don't forget to keep recharging.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    QWAK:
    
        During a one player game when you die and have no more credits,

    *RAINBOW ISLANDS:

        Collecting all of the gems in the correct order of color (from left
        to right on the gem counter - RED, ORANGE, YELLOW, GREEN, LIGHT
        BLUE, DARK BLUE, and MAUVE) not only awards you the life and Bonus
        Gem, it also grants you access to a magical secret room.  When you
        reach the end of the level, a silver door appears.  You don't have
        to fight the Boss.

        On the fifth island you'll find a box in the secret room which you
        should collect.  There's also a gate with a '7' on it, leading to
        island 7.

        Even more useful is how to create any color gem.  The screen is
        split into several invisible vertical stripes of color.  When a gem
        falls, its color is determined by the `color' of the area into which
        it fell.  Now all you have to do is guage ca refully where the dead
        enemy will fall to create the gem color of your choice.

        Type one of the following on the title screen, while the rainbow is
        cycling through colors:

            "BLRBJSBJ"_____________________________Permanent fast shoes.

    RALLY CROSS CHALLENGE:

        On the fifth track, drive around until you reach the wooden level

        race points.  When the game starts, follow the railroad tracks and
