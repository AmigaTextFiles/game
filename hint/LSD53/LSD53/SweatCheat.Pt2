        upper most left corner of this area and you should see lava with a
        patch on it that looks like a section of the firewall spell.  As
        quickly as you can, walk on this patch and you will be whisked away
        to secret levels.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    ESCAPE FROM THE PLANET OF THE ROBOT MONSTERS:
            
        This only works in one player mode.  When you reach the reptillion,
        run past it and stand in the center of the joint of the gates that
        block your way.  When here waggle the joystick left and right and
        keep dropping bombs.  In a few moments you'll go through the doors
        and appear on the other side.

        'LAWNMOWER', followed by the 'RETURN' key.  The voice will say
        {Bingo!} if you entered the cheat correctly.  Now, start the game
        and you'll be able to play with a range of automatic power-ups.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    *EYES OF HORUS:

        After you type in the copy protection and it says to press fire,
        type "SPAM" instead.  The game will start, and you'll have infinite
        lives and you won't need any of the keys.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    EYE OF THE BEHOLDER:
            
        Make two copies of disk 2 then make up your parties on both disks.
        Play the game as usual, but when you find any secret passages or
        walls, or unlock any doors, insert the other disk and continue
        playing for a short while.  This passes all the data onto this disk.
        Replace the original disk and continue playing and now, if you get
        stuck in the game and you have to start again, simply continue with
        the other disk and all the doors that were previously locked will
        be open. Plus, you'll be able to pick up the keys that you needed to
        unlock them as a bonus!

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    EYE OF BEHOLDER II:

        1. Load the game as normal and select "CREATE NEW PARTY". When the
           empty boxes appear, click on the top left box, then select race,
           class, alignment and portrait.  Now go to the modify box and
           boost all the statistics in this order:  STRENGTH, INTELLIGENCE,
           WISDOM, DEXTERITY, CONSTITUTION, CHARISMA, AND HIT POINTS.  Now
           you can click on strength and boost it to maximum, regardless of
           limitation put on the race or class of the character, so from now
           on, for example, you can have a super-hard wizard with a strength
           of 18/99.
        
        2. At the character generation screen, always increase all stats
           that you can (that includes hit points) to as high as they will
           go.
        
        3. If you want a mage, cleric or paladin to use a two handed weapon
           as well as magic, then do the following. Put the weapon down on
           the ground, and their spellbook or magic symbol in their second
           hand.  Click the right mouse button on this for a list of spells
           to appear.  Pick up the two handed weapon and place it in the
           characters primary hand.  As the list of spells is still up,
           they can now cast spells and use a two handed weapon at the same
           time.  You will have to repeat this process after using the
           compass etc.
           
        On the wasp level, stand on the spot where the two rooms join (the
        room to the south which has a crack in the wall - the hornet's nest)
        and rest.  This should generate four wasps which can be killed
        easily to gain experience points.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    E-MOTION:

        When the picture of einstein appears the second time, type
        "MOONUNIT" and press 'RETURN'.  Now use the following keys during
        play:
                'F1'______________________Forward a level.
                'F2'_________________________Back a level.
                'F3'___________________Forward ten levels.
                'F4'______________________Back ten levels.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    F-15 STRIKE EAGLE II:

        During play, press 'CTRL', 'ALT', and 'R' simutaneously to restock
        your ammunition.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    F-16 COMBAT PILOT:

        If you`re fed up with landing try the following: Jetison all fuel
        and weapons and climb to 65000ft. Stay there until the last of your
        fuel runs out.  Dive towards the ground and at 10 or 11 thousand
        feet pull up hard. You will then be able to rise about 4000 ft and
        then start falling towards the ground.  Just as you hit the ground
        the mission will end safely.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    F-117 STEALTH FIGHTER:

        Choose to run a strike mission, but don't arm your craft with any
        air to ground weaponry.  When you get a ground target, press '7' and
        'U' at the same time and the target will blow up automatically.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    F-19 STEALTH FIGHTER:

        Press 'ALT' and 'H' to get the pitch lines on your hud, fly upside
        down, turn off your engines, keep your plane about 10 degrees on
        your hud and watch that baby climb.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    F-29 RETALIATOR:

        On the enrollment enter your name as "CIARAN" then load up the
        pilots log.  THE NAME SHOULD NOW READ {OCEAN OK}.  NOW You can fly
        any mission with the huge benefit of infinite missiles and cannons.

        Also, choose "THE DIDDY MEN" for your name, click {COLONEL} icon
        and hit 'RETURN'.  Accept a mission (without selecting one) then
        go back and select a mission.  Now start the game and play as
        normal.  Hit 'ENTER' to automatically land the plane. 

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    FA-18 INTERCEPTOR (ELECTRONIC ARTS):

        Taxi down U.S. 101, turn right at highway 92, pull up to the EA
        headquarters and blow it away!

        In mission 6, once you've fired all your missiles, you can land on
        the shadow sub (if it's still afloat) and it will refuel and rearm
        you.
    
        Select option 2 {FREE FLIGHT, NO ENEMY CONFRONTATION} from the main
        menu.  Then select zero instead of 1 to 4.  The screen will go into
        a spiral and scroll way south to 34 by 117 degrees, placing your
        plane somewhere without a runway.  This happens to be in the middle
        of edwards air force base, where the F/A-18 was flight tested.
        To take off you have to use the afterburners.  117 degrees is the
        furthest south you'll be able to fly, but you can go in other
        directions.  Is there more to this back door?

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    FALCON:

        If your ammo runs low, press 'CTRL' and 'X' during the game and 
        watch the extra 500 rounds and 9 sidewinders clock up on the
        instruments.  It maybe 'CTRL', 'L SHIFT', and 'X'.  For a perfect
        landing, hold the 'HELP' key down about 10 to 20 feet above the
        runway.

        If you get badly hit, don't bail out, instead swing round and head
        for home.  Press 'HELP' and the '+' on the keypad and keep them
        depressed.  The F16 will stay level and drop down.  Switch to
        tracking mode and rotate to side view.  Just before touch down,
        pitch up the nose and the plane will touch down successfully every
        time.  Select "end mission" and you will be rescued even if you are
        in enemy territory.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    FEDERATION OF FREE TRADERS:

        Advancement in rank has nothing to do with the amount of credits to
        your name.  It is releated to the number of missions you complete
        and ships destroyed. The only way to earn a lot of credits is to
        haggle on the trade-net.  By staying in the space station on the
        net, and trading in guns, food and gold, you will quickly build a
        fortune.  Travelling to space stations requires you to jump until
        you cannot get any further.  Guide to completing the missions:

            MISSION 01: Take message: Just go there! Use e pod.
    
            MISSION 02: Destroy aliens, but not unknowns: Kill 4+.
                        Use E pod.

            MISSION 03: Destroy sat!

            MISSION 04: Escort convoy. Use E pod.

            MISSION 05: Investigate dissepearances. Kill 4+. USE E pod.

            MISSION 06: Search for survivors.

    GLOBULUS:

        To activate the cheat mode type "Zvmo!EG" as a password.  Type
        exactly as shown.

        The most important thing to remember is that all the puzzles can be
        solved without losing a life, so if you lose a life and think its
        the only way to solve the screen, look closely.  Some of the puzzles
        get pretty obscure after level 10, but once you eventually beat them
        you'll kick yourself for not seeing the solution earlier.

        Look before you leap.  Think about how the screen will look from a
        flipped perspective.  A lot of jumps you make will be unnecessary
        and waste time and switches if you don't.

        Make sure you have enough switches, at least 10 per screen.  It is
        possible to get stuck on a downward slope with no way to get back up
        or kill yourself, and the only way out is to press 'ESC' and start
        the whole game over.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    GOAL:

    GODFATHER, THE:

        Pause the game with the 'HELP' key, then type "PIZZA HUT".  This
        will give you infinite energy.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    GODS:
            
        On level two, buy a shield and a magic potion, then get three
        fireballs and three stars.  Spend all of your remaining money on
        food and health.  Collect all the gems in the usual manner, then
        get a key and make for the exit.  Now comes the tricky bit.  When
        you descend the last ladder, two thieves will appear.  Make sure
        that you don't quite have enough energy to survive a direct
        contact!  Before going down the ladder, release your magic potion,
        then climbdown and open the door.  Stand in front of the door
        ready to leave, but don't push up yet!  Wait until the thieves
        jump down at you and as soon as they touch you push the joystick
        up.  You may loose that life, but then something rather strange
        will happen.  The bonus will start to whiz up for quite some time,
        until the game starts again on world two with 28 extra men and
        about five million points!

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

        Pressing 'F7' during the game to skip levels.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    HARDBALL (ACCOLADE):

        VARIOUS HINTS:
 
        - Allstars are better than champs. 

        - Only steal if you actually hit the ball. 

        - Try to get a lot of runs early, as the computer team improves
          towards the end. 

        - Bunting rarely works. 

        - Halfway through the match, swap Laws for Wells and Wratten for
          Harris. 

        - The best pitchers are OLIVER, PEREZ, LEARY, COOK.  The others
          will only be successful for a short while. 

        - Never pitch fastballs to the center as they will usually
          result in home runs. 

        - Change pitchers after a few innings, because as they get
          tired, their accuracy and speed get worse.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    *HARD DRIVIN 1 AND 2:

        Get the car up to top speed the press 'N' (for nuetral).  Now you

        skip scenes.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    HARLEQUIN:

        The four heart pieces are located in the ROOFTOPS, HELL, CUTESEY
        LAND, and SHEET MUZAK

        Guide the Harlequin to the jigsaw puzzle section whilst carrying
        the space hopper.  When you fall from the kite, select the space
        hopper and jump up to the lower of the two platforms above you.
        Disengage the space hopper and jump across to the other platform,
        then leap over the low wall.  When you land, keep on firing to see
        where the ground is and move across to the point where you're
        walking on air.  Run left until you cannot go further, jump up and
        you'll hit an invisible warp.  You'll be prompted to insert disk 1,
        and now you can watch the end sequence.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    *HATE: (Keith Krellwitz)

        Pause the game and type "JUDITH".  Now press 'F10' to skip levels.
        Press 'F9' for invincibility.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

        Pause the game, press 'DEL' and when you lost all your lives you
        will go to the next level instead of dying.  Press '2' to go back
        and fourth between stages.  Also during the game press 'HELP' and

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    HEIMDALL:

        If your character has just been killed and you want to restore your
        weapons, magic and crew members, but forgot to save the game
        beforehand, then read on.  Go to the 'save game' option at the
        beginning of the game (where the attribute options are).  When the
        instruction to insert your saved game disk appears, click on "no"
        and you will return to the items screen with everything you had
        before you were killed.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    HELTER SKELTER:

        In a two player game, player 1 needs to get an extra life.  Then
        both players must lose all their lives.  Player two will get 99
        lives; after he loses one, so will player one.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    HERO QUEST:

        Read this, if you want to get loads of money (in the game).
        Simply get your men to complete the first mission then enter them in
        the last.  As soon as they appear, get one of them to search and
        collect the money if there's any there.  Then simply leave via the
        staircase with the money.  Keep this up until you've got enough
        money to buy the necessary equipment.  As for the artifacts that you
        can get during the game, well the same sort of thing can be done to
        acquire these.  Enter the mission, find the artifact and then get
        out.  Now just go back to the same mission and get someone else to
        pick up the the artifact in your question.  This way each of your
        characters have the top of the range weapons and armour.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    HEROES OF THE LANCE (SSI):

        SOME GENERAL TIPS:  

        Arrange your party so that the first line consists of two strong
        warriors, raistlin and goldmoon.  This allows you to use Raistlin's
        magic and the healing staff of goldmoon without too much hassle.
        Save tanis and riverwind for the later levels, where the bows come
        in handy.

        When fighting gully dwarves, use Tasslehoff who is the same height
        as them.  His sling stones will never miss.  Avoid fighting
        hatchlings, they're not worth it.  Just turn and run when you meet
        one; when you reach an intersection move into a new path and wait a
        little.  When you return, the hatchling will have gone.

        KILLING BOZAKS:  TWO METHODS:

        (1) Get raistlin to use a web, sleep or charm spell to stun it,
            then send a warrior to clobber it to death

        (2) Select Flint, who is a dwarf; 9 out of 10 times, the bozak's
            shots will go over his head; get close to enter melee combat,
            and use low thrusts to kill it.

        SPECTRAL MINIONS:  They're easy to kill, so use a warrior.

        WRAITHS:  A well-timed throw of an axe kills them every time.  If
                  you miss, use a sword and chest thrust movements.  Don't
                  let it get too close to you!

        SPIDERS:  Use low thrusts to keep them at bay.  If they get through
                  your guard, retreat until you can turn and fight again.

        The blue and green potions restore health, red slows down monsters,
        and yellow give your characters extra confidence.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    IT CAME FROM THE DESERT:

        Before attempting to go into the ants' nest, you should first save
        elmer to get more flamethrower fuel.  Some time between the 8th and
        10th (i don't remember the exact day), he will leave a note in his
        station saying that he is going hiking in the sw volcanic cone.  Go
        to the volcano, fight the ants, and next day, visit elmer's station.
        He'll thank you for saving his life and give you more flamethrower
        fuel.  The entrance to the ants' nest will never appear on the main
        map, but there are several other ways to get there:

            - By taking a flight from Hilber's field.
            - By driving a tank from a battle going on at a nearby location.
            - By going south when you are in a battle at the M1 mine.

        The entrance to the nest doesn't stay open long enough for you to
        get in before the ants start invading the various locations in the
        town, so you'll have to wait until they do.  The 11th is the best
        day to enter the hole since it is very hot and there are few ants
        around.  If you try cooler days, there will probably be too many of
        them around for you to handle.  Also, if you decide to get to the
        hole by plane, you can land safely on the dirt road parallel to the
        tracks leading to the m1 mine.

        For those who are having trouble getting to the ants hideout, it is
        located about one screen due south of mine one.  The best way to
        gain access to the tunnel is on the morning of day 11.  Go to the
        airport and get the plane.  Fly to mine one (southeast from the
        airport) and land on the road in front of mine one.  Get out of
        your plane and walk to the center of the main building of mine one.
        Walk south about one and a half screens and the hole should open
        and a ant will crawl out.  You must kill the ant and run to the
        hole before it closes.  You will get about 4 or 5 chances to get
        in.  Once you are in the hole you will automatically have the flame
        thrower and the timed dynamite charges.  There are two levels of
        the ants chambers, a top level and a bottom level.  You must make a
        map as to where you have checked.  YOu can do this by putting the
        game on pause with the left mouse button.  This will keep the ants
        off you while you draw maps.  Once you have made it to the bottom
        chamber repeat the map drawing till you find the queen ants
        chamber.  You will need it to get out after you plant the charges.
        To plant the charges once in the queens chambers move close to the
        queens left side of her body.  Once you walk around her left side
        the music will stop and a slow ticking will start.  You will have
        to get back to the place you entered on the second level. If you
        get back before the bomb goes off you will win the game.

        NOTE:

            It means nothing to gather information about the ants through
            out the game.  The mayor will not listen to anything you
            present in evidence. He will call an alert only after his car
            gets eaten on the afternoon of June 11.

            It will do no good to escape the hospital as you have to sleep
            anyway.  Even thou it will do no good to escape from the
            hospital it's a fun arcade sequence to play.

            Even with the solves given above you still must learn how to
            fly the airplane.  To get the right altitude to save fuel,
            after you take off fly east or west.  Back off the throttle
            till the shadow on the ground comes up and just touches the
            wing of the plane.  You will then have the right speed and
            altitude.  The faster you fly and the higher you go the more
            fuel you will use.  These settings will conserve enough fuel
            to let you fly and not run out of gas and return to the
            airfield and land if you blow it getting into the ant hole.

        When you start the game, on the first roof you come to, above a
        sign saying "Arctic Toys" you will find five objects, which are,
        from left to right, an apple, an Earth globe, a cake, a hammer and
        a tap.  The first letters of each of these added together (AECHT)
        is an anagram of the word CHEAT.  Pick up the objects in the correct
        order (Cake, Hammer, Earth globe, Apple and Tap) to recieve an
        invincibility shield lasting 10 minutes.  When the cheat is
        activated, flashing fish form around Robocod, and the music speeds
        up.  Also, if now you go straight into the first room, and then
        exit immediately you will find that all of the castle doors have
        been unlocked, allowing you to access any level.
        
        On the sports equipment level after the second spike are five
        objects in a row, which, in order, are some Lips, a Violin, an
        Earth globe, an Ice-cream and a Snowman.  The first letter of each
        of these added together spells out LVEIS, which is an anagram of
        the word LIVES.  Collect these in the correct order (Lips, Ice
        cream, Violin, Earth and Snowman) for infinite lives.

        In some point of the game (I do not know where), there are five
        objects that spell out the word POWER. Collect them in the
        following order: Penguin, Oil, Wine, Earth and Racquet.

            18 Level 3-4        36 Bonus Level 9

                              (SECRET ROOM LOCATIONS)
        There are two hidden worlds behind the main tower, another sweets
        level (including a Liquorice Allsorts World, the infamous Bouncing
        Jelly World, another Cake World and an upside down Jelly World)
        and an extra scrolling section. To reach them, run along the ground
        floor - avoiding the doors - then go up and over the first flight
        of stairs.  From the bottom of the second (smaller) tower, make
        your way up to the landing above Dr. Maybe's final door and run left
        into the wall.  You'll disappear behind the screen and arrive in the
        Secret Tower room.  But who is Katie? 

        Once you've  finished the bath level, drop down to the bottom of the
        castle, and walk left until you get to the small snowman statues.
        Jump on these and they'll turn into a moving platform.  Once you get
        to the top of the screen, walk left into thin air and jump.  By now
        you should be next to some doors.  Go through them for bonus city!!

        Go to the same place after finishing the circus room (the last room
        before the end of game baddy) and stand on the golden snowmen again.
        A platform made of two bonud blocks should float upwards, revealing
        a secret tunnel.  At the end of this are even more extra lives and
        stars.
    
        Do as above after the sweets level, but go to the left of the
        castle.  Go on the snowmen once more, and at the top of the screen
        grab the umbrella and collect all the goodies while you're floating
        down.

        On the second teddy bear level, keep jumping over the spikes until
        you see a hole above you.  Jump through this and catapult yourself
        off the bus there. Once you've done this, get on the higher level
        and keep walking left, bounce on the trampoline and collect the
        wings.  Now fly along the top of the screen to the right and you
        should find a different exit.  Go through this for a special bonus
        level. 

        Complete a level with does not feature a guardian and you will
        always find something new when you return to the castle "selection"
        screen.  In one case you will find a whole sequence of lifts and
        things (see above) that lead to a door that you cannot normally get
        to.  If you go to the very right of the factory screen and look down
        you will see a load of crowns, which you can access after coming
        back from other levels.

        It is possible to finish Robocod by only doing half the levels.  A
        choice of two new doors to enter is given when the correct level is
        completed.  Start by completing the Fluffy Toys one and then by
        doing the Cars one.

        Finish the bath levels and as soon as you come out of the door run
        straight to the golden snowmen in the bottom far left outside the
        castle.  Jump into these snowmen and you'll float upwards to the top
        of the screen where you'll be met by a door.  Getting through this
        door is tricky but worth it.  Inside are loads of extra lives and
        energy stars.  Go to the same place after finishing the circus room
        (the last room before the end of game baddy) and stand on the golden
        snowmen again.  A platform made of two bonus blocks ahould float

        never decrease.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    KRISTAL:
            
        FIGHTS - Proficent swordplay is essential if your to get anywhere in
        the game.  The neck chop is one of the more effective blows, but the
        program blocks repetition of single moves.  To get around this,
        occassionaly switch to a differnt move in order to enable the neck
        chop once again.  Give generously to the poor and you'll be a step
        closer to obtaining the sword of the spheres.

        THE PALACE - To enter the palace, you'll need to get the invitation
        from the elusive Gloop, found in Novala.  Once you have it, keep out
        of fights or you could lose it for good.  When you get into the
        palace, ask nedrod three questions and he will give you the talisman,
        which can help you find another useful item.  Answer the princess's
        question with {ITS A SECRET}.  She will give you the ring of belz,
        which will only work in conjunction with the spell scroll.

        IN GENERAL - Objects are not always found in the same places from
        game to game, so a detailed search of both fore and backgrounds is
        often in order.  To survive the final confrontation, a high psychic
        rating is needed, which can be increased by donating skringles to
        the poor.  Disorderly conduct can have the opposite effect.  The
        safest technique in the space battles, is to slow right down as soon
        as you see the aliens shoot them all, then power at full steam until
        the next lot.  Follow readheads ship if you see it.  Heatpro tablets
        are necessary if you beam down to one of the hotter planets.  Makes
        notes of what you are told, and use any new names or subjects to
        weavel out every last bit of information from the characters.

        house to pieces with the rockets, waiting for droids or Regix to
        show up - get them with Jonlan's M4000. I managed to do the scenario

        Hold down 'ALT' and 'X' keys to get past proof of age.  Hold down
        'ALT' and 'D'.  It will ask for a location number.  Enter a number
        form 008-045 (must be a three digit number).

        This solve did'nt get all the points, but it finishes the game.  my
        additions are in capitals.....(score 215 of 222)
         
        The 1st step is to enter the bar, go to the bathroom and read the
        walls several times until you get the password.  Then go to the sink
        and get the ring.  you can (must!) use the toilet if you want.  Go 
        to the bar and buy a whiskey.  Go to the drunk next to the bathroom
        wall and (kick him to wake him) give him the whiskey and he'll give
        you the remote control.  Get the rose too.  Go back into the bar and
        knock on the big door.. when he asks you for the password.. tell him
        "KEN SENT ME", then enter.  Turn on the T.V. with the remote.  Keep
        changing channels until you find a channel he likes..  he'll move
        from the stairs.  Climb up and voila!  The prostitute:  Don't hop
        into bed with her until you get the rubber.  You just need the candy
        on the bench.  Get it. go out the window, and go to the fire-escape
        ladder.  You'll fall into a dumpster.  Search it and get the hammer.
        Exit the dumpster and go left. Call a cab at the street.

        Now go to the casino and go through the lobby.  Get the card in the
        ashtray.  Now gamble a bit until you have about 250 dollars.  Go
        outside.  Sometime in the game when outside the casino, a guy in a
        barrel will come up and ask you to buy an apple.  Buy it.  Call the
        cab..  tell him to go to the store.  enter the store and buy a
        rubber.  Also get the (magazine and) cheap wine in the back.
        (never enter the cab with the wine..  the cabbie will get drunk and
        kill you) pay for the wine and exit..  Wait for the russian looking
        guy to come from the left. (Ignore the dog) When he comes, give him
        the wine..  not money.  (Look at phone dial number, answer the
        questions)  Once you have the knife go right and show the pass to
        the bouncer at the disco door.  Go in and sit down at the table with
        the lady.  Smile and give her the ring, the candy, and the rose.
        Ask her to dance.  When you finish off with the dancing ask her to
        marry you.  She'll ask you for $100.  Give it to her and meet her at
        the marrage chapel.  It's east of the casino front.  Enter and go up
        to the front.  Type "MARRY", and you'll get married.  Go up to the
        honeymoon suite.  (fourth floor, door with the heart, push four).
        Knock, and enter. She'll be on the bed, and {NOT IN THE MOOD!?!}
        Turn on the radio and listen to it.  You'll get a number to call to
        get the wine delivered that she wants.  Go to the casino and get
        some taxi fare money.  Go to the phone in front of the store,
        (answer the phone if it rings) call the number and have them
        deliver it to the {HONEYMOON SUITE}.  If they say it probably won't
        show up, you screwed up on the typing.  Go back to the casino and go
        to the suite.  Be sure that you have the knife.  Enter and pour the
        wine.  Things will take they're course and you'll find yourself tied
        to the bed. (THE BITCH!) Use the knife and free yourself.  Get the
        rope and leave.  Go to the casino again and using some saving, use
        the dollar and get about $50.  (go to cabaret.  find a seat and 
        sitdown. listen to act.) Once you have it, go to the bar and knock
        on the door again.  Go up the stairs and screw her now that you have
        the rubber.  Remove the rubber after you've used it.  Go out the
        window and this time go to the right of the balcony.  Tie the rope
        to yourself and tie it to the railing.  Type "GO WINDOW" or (reach
        out) something so your hanging in front of the  window on the right.
        Break the glass with the hammer.  Get the pills.  Pull on the rope
        and untie yourself.  Go down the fire escape and call a cab again.
        Go to the casino and go to the eighth floor.  Talk to the lady at
        the desk until the game tells you that you'll need some medicine or
        something.  Give her the pills.  She'll run off and leave the desk
        unguarded.  Push the button and enter the open doors on the right.
        Enter and go up and right.  When you're in the room with the bed,
        open the closet door.  Enter it and type, "LOOK".  Get the doll...
        (look at doll.  inflate doll.  look at doll. use doll.) then wait as
        you run after it.  When you're near the hottub, (remove clothes)
        enter it.  Look at the lady.  smile, and give her the apple. Things
        will then run they're course, and voila!

        corners of the screen, starting at the top left and go in a
        clockwise direction.  If you do it correctly you will hear lets go.

        still need to complete every level to receive the talisman.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

        If you jump onto the notice board next to the mission 1 entrance and
        push up, you'll be able to collect 4 extra lives.

        On mission 3, jump along the 4th platform, jump up and keep pushing
        up and you'll climb the wall.  When you reach the top, walk to the
        left and keep going until you reach the edge of the screen.  There
        you will find 10 magnifying glasses, one gun, a round of bullets and
        an extra life.  

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    LIGHT CORRIDOR:
                    
        First a little hint: The green diamonds are essential as these award
        you with an extra life. Some of the red diamonds will allow control
        over two bats but this is more of a hinderence as the two bats prove
        confusing.  Avoid the blue squares as they will shrink the size of
        your bat.

    LORD OF THE RINGS:

        Explore the SHIRE (starting point) Completley. There are items in
        this area the you will need later in the game.  If the game tells
        you there is a chest in a room, use the SKILL picklock, to open it.
        PIPIN TOOK has this skill.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    LOST PATROL:

        Rest for 50 minutes and for no loss of food your strength is
        restored by a few points.  This restores all of your remaining men
        to 99 percent.  Keeping up your men's strength and morale is vital.
        Giving your men 50 minutes' rest a night, or during the day when
        it's too dark to arry on, will slam your energy and morale levels
        to max.  Even if you don't have much food, you don't have to worry,
        as your men will not eat it.
        
        On reaching the first village (the first white cross on the map),
        search the area to find a hole in the ground where the villagers
        appear to be hiding.  You then have two options:  ENTER TUNNEL or
        USE GRENADES.  Gomez is useful at this point, but if he is dead, go
        for the USE GRENADES option.

        Start off questioning the villagers normally by aking them "Where
        VC?" Once you have an answer, start the hard questioning, or a
        village boy will get hold of a gun and shoot one of your men.
