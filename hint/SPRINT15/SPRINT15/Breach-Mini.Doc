             *** Playing ***:
 
  Besides obvious Icon-Based commands during play there are the following:
        
	  Shift-Next = Allow enemies to move.
	  Shift-Gun  = Use Psionic attack
                           (only available to PT(Psionic Talent) Marines
			    uses 10 movement points)
	  Alt-any marine onscreen = pick that marine to be current

       
             *** Mission ***:

  Your overall objective for the game is to improve your squad leader. He is 
the only one who changes from one scenario to the next. To improve your squad
leader must have been an integral part of the scenario (You can't just have 
your other marines do all the work and take all the risk cause you'll get
none of the credit).
  The first thing you should always do when starting a new mission is to check
your mission briefing and your victory conditions. You should then check out
the marines and equipment immidietly available to you. Be carefull at this 
time that you are not ambushed.  


             *** Marines ***:
	   
  Marines have the following vital statistics:
    
    Moves - the number of moves left in the current marines turn.
    
    Vital - the vitality of the current marine. (A winding factor.)
    
    Health - the health of the current marine. If it goes to 0%, the marine
             is dead. 
	     
    Enc - the current encumbence of the marine (not the maximum encumbrence).
                                                ~~~
    Shoot - the accuracy of the current marines shooting. If the marine is 
            also a psionic talent, this is a measure of his stun accuracy 
	    as well.
	    
    Detec - the percentage chance the current marine has of successfully
            operating a detector.
	
    Crack - the percentage chance the current marine has of successfully
            operating a crack unit-must be used by either a computer
	    of a terminal.
	
    Ammo - the current marine;s ammunition supply in his gun.
