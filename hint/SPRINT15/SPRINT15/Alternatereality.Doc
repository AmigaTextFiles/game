                      Guidebook to The City

     Welcome to The City of Xebec's Demise.   Read this  guidebook 
before entering; it gives vital pointers to help you survive.

     There  are many establishments in The City.   This list  will
help you in your travels:   15 Shops; 7 Inns; 14 Taverns; 3 Banks;
4 Smithies;  2 Healers; and 12 Guilds.  The City doesn't allow you
to  interact  with Weapons Trainers and some  other  institutions.
Also, you'll discover entrances that require the use of a disk you
don't yet have.   Alternate Reality -  The City is designed to  be
expanded.   Future additions include The Dungeon,  The Arena,  The
Palace, The Wilderness, Revelation, and Destiny.

     In  addition to the game,  you need a blank disk to use as  a
Character Disk.  Without a Character Disk you can't save a game.
 
Introduction:

     You're kidnapped by an alien spaceship and find yourself in a
room with only one exit.  Through this doorway you see The City of
Xebec's  Demise.   An  energy  field  moves  across  the  opening.
Overhead is a panel with constantly-changing numbers.   The moment
you  step through the door,  the numbers freeze.   This sets  your
levels of Stamina,  Charm,  Strength, Intelligence, Wisdom, Skill,
Hit Points,  and Wealth.   The higher these beginning  Stats,  the
better your chances of surviving in The City.

     During  the first few days,  you're extremely  vulnerable  to
foul play (of which there is an annoying amount),  The safest area
is  near the Floating Gate.   Of course,  safety isn't  your  only
consideration;   there  are  benefits  to  discover  in  the  more
dangerous  locales (cheaper food and  lodging,  better  treasures,
etc).

     Keep a low profile until you're familiar with the ways of The
City.  And,  avoid  Encounters with life forms that are  obviously
superior  (don't tease a Wizard during these early  days!)   Note:
Save games and backup your Character Disk regularly.

     Once  your familiar with The City Square (the area you  begin
in), it's time to be more daring and explore further afield.

     The  object of your sojourn journey in The City is to  become
oriented to Alternate Reality,  build your Stats,  and become  the
sort  of  Adventurer  who  can  survive  hardships,  fight  heroic
battles,  and  solve  the  quests presented  in  The  Dungeon  and
subsequent adventures.

     Stats  The values at the top of the screen show all you  know
for certain about your Character.   Increasing them is crucial for
your development.   Stats and increased by certain Potions,  by  a
first  visit  to any Guild,  and by moving up  a  Character  Level.
Charm, Strength, and Intelligence also improve with use.

        Experience is gained through Encounters with life forms in
The City (you start the game with Experience points and  Character
Level  at  0).    The  more  Encounters  you  survive,  the  more,
Experience  points you gain.   When Experience builds to somewhere
between 250 and 300, you move up a Character Level (all your Stats
influence how many Experience points you need).   When you move up
a  Character Level,  you usually gain other Stat points  as  well.
Each  Character Level requires twice as many Experience points  as
the one before.

        Stamina  is  important if you're to  survive.   This  Stat
determines your health, endurance, and how long you can hold up in
battle.

        Charm detrmines how other life forms react to you.  If you
aren't  "charming"  enough,  you're  more likely  to  be  attacked
withour  provocation.    Bribing  an  opponent  is  easier  for  a
"charming" Character:   and the battle tactic of charming (an evil
act  - See Encounters) requires a great deal of Charm.   The  more
you use these tactics, the higher your Charm level becomes.

        Strength is very advantageous when fighting.  The stronger
you are,  initially,  the better, since you enter Encounters armed
with  nothing  but  your bare  hands.   Later,  when  you  acquire
Weapons, how well you're able to use them depends on Strength (and
Skill).   Strength also determines the size and number of  objects
you  can  carry.   Fighting  prolonged  battles  in  which  you're
ultimately the victor improves your Strength.

        Skill helps you avoid blows from your adversary.   It also
helps  in  wielding certain close-combat  weapons  during  battle:
Short Swords, Daggers, Stillettoes, and the like.

        Intelligence  enhances  your  Wisdom and  is  crucial  for
tricking  your  enemies (see Encounters - this is  an  evil  act).
Using your Intelligence helps you increase it.

        Wisdom  is  for discernment.   when you find  a  Treasure,
Wisdom  is the Stat that helps you discover whether  it's  Cursed,
Magical,  or  Mundane (see Treasure).   It's also  important  when
you're trying to decide whether or not a Potion is one you want to
quaff (see Potions).

        Hit  Points are very important:   the more you  have,  the
harder you are to kill!  As you build Strength and Experience, you
also build you Hit Points.

     You  are closely monitored !   Many  things,  including  your
personality,  are  constantly  being  taken into  account  by  the
computer.  But the Stats on the screen don't tell the whole story.

        Physical  Speed  when you enter one Guild (discover  which
one for yourself!),  you are given an increase in Speed.   That is
the  only  time you'll ever know how high  this  Stat  is.   Speed
controls how fast and easily you can escape undesired Encounters.

        Moral Alignment  You enter The City with Neutral  morality
(neither  Good  nor  Evil).   It's  up to  you  to  develoop  your
personality.  The City is designed to be harder on Evil Characters
than  on  Good  ones (although,  as in  "real"  life,  it's  often
difficult to see the whole picture).
        Evil  acts  include things such as charming  and  tricking
Good or Neutral life forms, or attacking them with no provocation.
        To  develop a Good Character,  you must really be on  your
toes!  Try to avoid battles whenever you can, especially with good
life forms.  Be careful about which Guilds you join and what sorts
of Spells you use.  The straight and narrow is not an easy path!

     Time  A city year has twelve months,  30 days in each.  There
are  24 hours in a day,  divided into 12 hours of darkness and  12
hours  of  light (allowing for dusk and dawn).   Each AR  hour  is
equal  to approximately 4 actual minutes.   However,  when  you're
sleeping  in an Inn,  working,  or attending classes at a  Guild,
time passage is (thankfully) speeded up so you don't spend forever
waiting to wake up, finish work, or get out of school!

     Weather  Rain,  cold,  and heat can hit any time in The City.
The weather can affect your Stats if you aren't dressed  properly,
so  it's  a wise idea to ensure that you're  adequately  protected
against the elements.  If you spend too much time in the rain, for
example,   without  proper  attire,   a  bad  cold  could  be  the
consequence!   Heatstroke or a chill are other possible results of
being  unprepared.   Being out in severe weather can make you tire
more easily too; and heat definitely produces thirst!

     Secret  Doors and One-Way Walls  A Secret Door looks  like  a
regular  wall,  but  you  can walk through it  (accompanied  by  a
whoosing  noise and an odd melody).   One-Way Walls are visible on
one  side;  you can pass through the invisible side but trying  to
go through the visible one will only prove embarassing!

     Objects   How  much  you can carry depends  on  Strength  and
Stamina,  plus  the size and weight on the items  you're  lugging.
Check  your inventory occasionally to see how  efficiently  you're
managing  your  objects.    Otherwise,  you  may  be  unpleasantly
surprised  when items your Stats don't allow for start falling  on
the ground.
     You can drop objects any time during gameplay (press D).  Any
item you drop can be picked up again (press G),  if it hasnt' been
stolen by Thieves or whisked away by magic.
     Carrying objects is not the same as using them.   Press U and
follow  the  prompts to use an item.   This  goes  for  absolutely
anything you carry,  except a Compass (it's always in use,  if you
own it).
     Some  objects  are  listed  in  your  inventory  permanently,
whether  you  acutally possess them or not.   If you  aren't  sure
whether you own an item, try to use it.

     Clothing   You  enter The City with a  mininum  of  clothing.
This is fine for summer afternoons but you could be in trouble  in
there's  a  sudden  cooling trend or rainstorm  you  could  be  in
trouble.
     Aside  from  protection from the  elements,  clothing  has  a
"dapper" value.   Some life forms you Encounter are influenced  by
the style, color, and fabric you wear.

     Food  Packets and Water Flasks  You begin the  game  supplied
with  three  Water  Flasks and  three  Food  Packets.   These  are
important  as  you  will become hungry and  thirsty  as  the  game
progresses.
     To use a Food Packet or Water Flask,  press U and follow  the
prompts.  Replenish your stock at a local Tavern.

     Compass   This is a very important item for newcomers to  The
City.   It is essential in order to find your way around and  help
you  from getting lost.   To obtain a compass go to any  Shop  and
when the shopkeeper asks you if you want to see his wares tell him
you  are not interested.   He will then offer you a compass for  5
silvers.
      The  compass arrow will always point  to  the  North.   Your
direction heading is always at the topmost portion of the compass.

     Treasure   Treasure is found lying about after  a  successful
Encounter.   Treasure takes many forms:  Watches, Gems and Jewels,
Money,  Weapons and Armour,  and Potions.   All  treasure,  except
money is potentially Magical or Cursed.  Magical items are usually
valuable, Cursed items are a source of despair.

     Watch  Usually,  to find out the time you must go into an Inn
and ask the Innkeeper.   However there will be occassions when you
aren't near an Inn and could use a Watch.
     Watches are precious commodities in the City;  you can't  buy
them and can only be found in treasure after an Encounter.  If you
find one type U and follow the prompts.

     Gems and Jewels  These valuable items aren't legal tender  in
The City.   They can be exchanged for money in Banks.  On occasion
Gems or Jewels can be absolutely worthless.

     Weapons and Armor  Three ways of acquiring Weapons and Armor:
        1.  Finding them after an Encounter;
        2.  Finding them after uncovering a Treasure;
        3.  Buying them from a Smithy.

     When  you defeat an opponent you won't always get the  Weapon
he was fighting with or the Armour he was  wearing.   Often,  they
were broken in battle or were magical and simply disappeared!
     Always examine Weapons or Armour before picking them up.  The
higher your Intelligence and Wisdom,  the easier it is to tell  if
they  are Magical or Mundane (normal).   Magical means  they  have
special  properties.   Once you pick up a Cursed item,  you  can't
drop it; you need help to get rid of it (see Guilds).
     Armor  comes  in  pieces  that  protect  body  parts:    head
(helmets,  caps) torso (breastplates,  mail coats) legs  (greaves)
and  arms  (gauntlets).   To  use armor you  must  you  each  part
specifically.
     Press  U  to  use a Weapon or piece  of  Armour  (follow  the
prompts).
     Here are a few hints:   A longsword is better than a  dagger;
a Flamesword is the most effective of any sword;   shields come in
many forms and sizes,  the Tower Shield being the most  defensive;
mail Armor gives better protection than leather or quilted;  plate
Armour is better than any mail and crystal plate is the best.
     Continous  use of a certain Weapon weakens it after  a  while
and decreases it's potency.   It is wise to find a new weapon  and
discard the old one.

     Potions  Some potions are beneficial.  When you find a potion
there are a number of things you can do.   Press U and follow  the
prompts.   You can taste,  sip,  examine, quaff, etc.  Each sip or
taste tells you a little more about it.  Quaffing it gives you the
potions  full effect.   Caution:   Sipping a potion causes you  to
receive  some  of  the full effect but not as  strong  as  if  you
quaffed it.
     Potions  of  Delusion and Drunkeness are two  of  the  worst.
They aren't deadly like potions but they are permanent unless  you
can  find  a healer.   Until then you won't be  able  to  navigate
properly.
     Potions such as Invulnerability and Treasure-Finding are well
worth the trouble though.

     Employment  Part time jobs are available at any Inn, Bank, or
Tavern.   Job  offers are all determined by the  "boss".   Careful
though,  there is some risk of on-the-job injuries and there is no
Workman's Compensation!  Here are the requirements for each of the
jobs:

     Bellhops,  Janitors,  and Clerks  You need a certain Strength
for a bellhop,  Stamina for Janitors, Charm for Clerks

     Bouncers,  Hosts,  and Dishwashers  Strength is the  criteria
for  bouncers,   Charm  for  hosts,  and Skill  for  the  delicate
glassware

     Guards,  File Clerks,  and Coin Rollers  These Bank jobs  are
harder to get.   Guards require both Strength and  Stamina,   File
Clerks need high Intelligence as well as Skill,  Coin Rollers need
Skill and must be honest (Evil characters can forget it!).

     Inns offer lodging - for a price.   When you enter an Inn you
have choices of several rooms.   The better the room the more  the
chance  of  rebuilding lost hit points.   You use  up  food  while
sleeping so watch it.  Inn's also serve as Time and Date centers.

     Taverns    When  you  buy food and beverage  at  Taverns  you
automatically  eat  them.   Buying Food Packets and  Water  Flasks
makes  it unnecessary to be in a Tavern to eat.   Just hit  U  and
select either.
     If you want to make friends buy rounds for the  house.   This
endears you to the Tavernkeeper and his customers.   This comes in
handy if your broke and hungry and you enter a Tavern where you're
well known.
     Taverns also sell alcoholic beverages.   As in real life  you
can get drunk,  movement is hampered,  and manipulating screens is
hard.  You can even black out!  Find an Inn and sleep it off.
     Pay  attention to the items you purchase.   Some of them  not
only satisfy your immediate hunger but give you a Food Packet.

     Banks   Banks  offer investment plans for  your  money.   The
higher  the interest,  the higher the risk.   It's a good idea  to
spread your money between accounts and other banks.
     You may also turn in your Jewelry and Gems for money.

     Smithies   As  you approach a Smithy you can hear  the  Smith
hammering  away on his anvil.   This helps if your trying to  find
one in an obscure area of the city.
     Smithies  offer a variety of Weapons and  Armor.   His  stock
chanages hourly (AR time).   Prices and quality change so haggling
is essential.   Many Weapons or Armour you find after an Encounter
are not available at Smithies.

     Shops  Here you can buy clothing or a compass.   When he asks
you  if you want to see his wares just say no and he'll  give  you
the  option of buying a compass.   Shopkeepers also  update  their
stock hourly (AR time).

     Guilds  Guilds reward you with Character-enhancing  knowledge
the FIRST time you enter.  For a fee, any Guild can rid of you  of
a Curse.
     You may also join a Guild.   Each Guild has certain Stat  and
Level  requirements so don't get upset if you're turned  down  the
first couple times.
     You can belong to as many Guilds as you want  to,  membership
is for life.

     Spells  Once you're accepted into a Guild,  you're given  the
oppurtunity  to  learn  a spell.   You must attend  classes  on  a
specified  number of consecutive days in order to learn  a  spell.
These  classes last 8 hours (AR time),  so you can become  hungry,
thirsty,  and  fatigued.   If you miss a day of class you have  to
make it up.
     Each Guild has a limited number of spells it can teach.   The
Guild  director selects which spells you're allowed to  learn  and
will never offer you the same one.   The quantity of items  you're
carrying limits the number of spells you can learn.
     There is no guarantee the spells will work.  The more you use
a  certain spell the better your ability becomes to cast it  (just
as Strength improves when fighting).   The better you know it  the
better the chance of it working.   Caution:   Spells can  backfire
and cause you to lose Hit Points.

     Poison   When  Poisoned you sustain intitial  Hit  Point  and
neurological damage in line with the strength of the  Poison.   If
you're lucky enough to find a potion that cures Poison,  drink it!
Otherwise  find  a healer right away!   Your Stats  keep  dropping
until you die.
     These are the ways of getting poisoned:
     1.  Swallowing poisonous Potions;
     2.  Being clawed by a poisonous creature;
     3.  Being bitten by a poisonous creature;
     4.  Being stung by a poisonous tail.

     Disease  Left untreated,  it can be fatal.  Some disease dont
show until a couple of days have passed - incubation  period.   If
you're Diseased quaff a potion that Cleanses or seek out a healer.
     These are the ways of being diseased:
     1.  Contact with bacteria from Mold or Slime
     2.  Being clawed by a Diseased creature;
     3.  Being bitten by a Diseased creature.

     Encounter
     Option explanation:
     1)  Attack.   You move offensively while maintaining a decent
         defense;
     2)  Trick.   If  you're intelligent trick an  opponent.   You
         aren't prepared for defense if a trick fails.   Plus it's
         an Evil act when used against Good or Neutral life forms.
     3)  Charm.  Charm them if you have a high Charm.  It's Evil.
     4)  Offer.  Offer  an item to a life form.   May  save  your
         life.
     5)  Leave.   Get out of the Encounter.  Sometimes this is the
         only solution.
     6)  Lunge.   Two-handed blow that lands with great force.  If
         you fail you have zippo defense.

     Tailor your Encounter strategy to fit your condition and  the
kind of life form confronting you.  It's easier to trick a Warrior
than a Master Thief.  Don't expect to charm or trick mindless life
forms; you'd look pretty silly to try and charm a Mold!

     You may also (whether or not you are in an Encounter):

     C  Cast a spell
     D  Drop an item
     G  Get an item
     U  Use an item in your inventory
     W  Switch Primary and Secondary Weapons
     P  Pause the Game
     S  Save the Game
     .  Switch between options

     Healers  can restore Sight (heal Drunkeness); restore clarity
(remove  Delusions;  cleanse  Poison;   diagnose  Diseases;   cure
Diseases; and heal wounds (both Major and Minor).
     Occasionally a Healer isn't in,  either you wait or go to the
only other clinic in town.

     Life Forms  Here is a list of some things you can Encounter.

     Paupers  have  no  ambition  or  been  in  some   catastrophe
that has put them in dire straits.

     Commoners possess no special skills or distinctions.  This is
your class when you first enter The City.

     Merchants work hard to keep The City's economy healthy.   You
usually  see  these  capitalist  types on their  way  to  or  from
wheeling-and-dealing.

     Couriers deliver messages and parcels.

     Guards  police The City.   Don't mess with them!   If  you're
being attacked by Guards, it probably means you've become evil.

     Gladiators fight in the Arena games.

     Noblemen  live  in the Palace and are fond  of  Arena  games.
rich and powerful,  they're attended by private Guards when out in
public.

     Dwarves resist many Poisons and Magic Spells,  have excellent
night vision, and are terrific close-combat fighters.

     Mages  and other magical types dwell in The City.   Most  are
associated with Guilds or other learning institutions.   Acolytes,
Novices, and Wizards belong to this category.

     Thieves take anything that isn't nailed down!  They abound in
the  City  and  each  has his  own  criminal  specialty  (Muggers,
Cutthroats, etc.)

     Assasins strike swiftly,  without warning.   One blow can end
even the strongest character's life.

     Brown  Mold and Black Slime leave you with horrible  Diseases
that are neither diagnosed nor cured easily.

     Giant  Rats and Wolves carry Rabies and love to share  it  by
biting and clawing you.

     Imps  lash  out  with  long,  dagger-like,  poisonous  tails.
They're nasty creatures; avoid them.

     Dragons attack with claws and flame.   There are Blue Dragons
and  Green  Dragons,  small  and Large.   They  usually  can't  be
defeated with ordinary weapons, so use caution!

     Wraiths,  Ghosts,  Spectres,  and  zombies hover  menacingly.
They're  Evil  creatures  that  require  a  stout  heart  in   any
adventurer who Encounters them.

     Night Stalker is a legendary creature on the night.  It's  an
extremely powerful beast that no one can be sure doesn't exist.
