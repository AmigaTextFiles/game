GRIDIRON!

The Football Simulator
We have created this manual with the knowledge that many of you will
want to play first and read later.  While we can understand your
desire to "dive right in", this manual is an integral part of your
GRIDIRON! simulator and we urge you to give it a thorough reading.
This is the only way that you will be able to capture the full
excitement and potential of GRIDIRON!.  For those of you diehards who
never read instructions, however, skim through sections I and II
before starting a game and save the rest for when you want to get into
the more complex aspects of GRIDIRON!.


Overview:

GRIDIRON! is the most comprehensive football game available for a
personal computer.  We think the more you understand GRIDIRON!, the
better you will enjoy it.  Yet for all its power, GRIDIRON! was
designed to be as simple as possible to use.  The keyboard is required
only to enter names (for teams, playbooks, and plays) and complete the
Validation Sequence.  All other interaction is effected by means of
the mouse.  In GRIDIRON!, the mouse controls a cross hatch pointer
["+"] that is used in selecting options and players.  All Screen Menus
have selection boxes.  Simply point and click inside the appropriate
box to invoke the desired option.

GRIDIRON! has been made as realistic as possible to give you the
feeling that you are playing an actual football game:

     o Each of the 22 players moves independently.

     o Each play is executed in real-time with the program residing
entirely in RAM.  At the advanced and Pro levels, the action will tax
even the most proficient of players.

     o You can set individual Player characteristics [Speed, Strength]
for each of the Players on both teams; offense and defense.  You
control the action as it is taking place.

     o On offense you control the ball carrier; on defense you control
any Player you choose.  With a DataDisc of NFL teams, you can even run
game simulations of various teams against on another!

     o Player movements emulate the realities of the playing field.
Players muse accelerate to achieve full speed.  A Player cannot change
direction instantly since he has momentum.  When Players collide, they
react according to their angle(s) of collision.


GRIDIRON! is a game of TACKLE football.  If the ball carrier is
stronger than the defender who is tackling him, he is not necessarily
going to go down.  The runner's strength will be reduced, and his
momentum and direction affected by the collision, but he will keep
running.  A runner may be able to break a tackle that is just a
glancing blow, while a solid hit will usually bring him down.  The
ball carrier may even pick up an extra yard as he falls.  You can fake
a defender to make him miss a tackle, or try to run him down to pick
up the extra yard.  The decision is yours.



Background Notes:

We have tried to make GRIDIRON! as realistic as possible by recreating
the actual "feel" of playing a football game.  We have achieved this
by invoking a small number of purposeful conventions.

In order to best view all the action taking place, the perspective is
directly above the playing field.  After careful study, we decided not
to "scroll" the screen when the action moves out of the immediate
(screen) area.  Instead, the action "freezes" for a period of one
second while a new playfield is drawn.  In this way, you are given the
time to adjust to your previous position on the playing field and
continue the play, yet you are provided with a more complete picture
of the overall playing area.  Although this make take some getting
used to, we believe you will find it much less obtrusive than
continually scrolling a small section of the screen into view.  We
have kept the graphics simple for the same reason.  Playability is
paramount.

I.  HOW TO GET STARTED
After you have entered the validation code, your validation screen
will be replaced by the Setup Menu.  A single red cross hatch pointer
will appear on the screen.  If you choose a one player game, the
pointer will stay red.  If you select a two users game, the pointer
colors will be red and blue (one pointer color for each player).
Remember your pointer color!  Only your pointer color will control
your team.  Pointers are used to select options on the screen as well
as direct game play.

In all menus, there will be boxes already "filled".  These are the
default values.  If you are satisfied with the default values, simply
select the "Continue" box to go on to the next screen.  If you want to
change a default setting, place your pointer over the box and click
once on the mouse to select it.  The chosen box will now "fill" to
demonstrate that the computer has set the value as indicated.

There is a special window that occasionally appears in the center of
the screen called the "Message Window".  This window displays
pertinent information to the user during the game such as: "First
Down", "Safety", "Touchback", "Touchdown", etc.  Sometimes the Message
Window will request you to input information as well.  If the window
asks for something to be "entered", the keyboard must be used.  To
select an option in the Message Window, use the mouse by clicking on
the appropriate text.  If a valid selection has been made, the Message
Window will disappear.

Menu selections are made by one mouse at a time.  The computer will
only allow one cursor on the screen while a menu is present.  That
cursor's mouse must be used to make the selection. [When necessary,
messages on the screen will indicate which user should make the
selection.]


1. SETTING THE NUMBER OF USERS/LENGTH OF GAME

SINGLE USER MODE:

The opening screen has a default setting for single user play.  Set
the time of the quarters as desired.  The default value is for 15
minute quarters.  You will have control over the Gold Team and your
pointer will be red in color.  The computer will automatically assume
control of the Black Team.

DUAL USER MODE:

In dual user mode, select "2 Player" after the opening screen.  The
default value is for 15 minute quarters.  When the play field comes
up, each player will have either a red or blue pointer.  The Gold Team
is controlled by the red pointer, the Black team is controlled by the
blue pointer.

You will need an additional mouse or eight position joystick to play
in dual user mode.  A mouse is the ideal second controller since an
eight position joystick does not provide you with as much control over
the players.  A joystick interface has been included for your
convenience, but for those who use a joystick, however, there are
important differences in game play:

     1. Menus - Limited menu options are available to the player using
a joystick.  Cursor color reveals which user should select menu
options.

     2. Swapping Controllers - Due to the limited control offered by
an eight position joystick, only the defensive teams are controlled by
the joystick.  Users are instructed to swap the mouse and joystick
after a change of possession.


NOTES ON GAME LENGTH:

A game that is 5 minutes per quarter can usually be played in less
than 45 minutes.  A game this short, however, will not allow as many
possessions per team.  This creates a somewhat unrealistic game as
scoring on each possession becomes much more important that with
longer quarters.

Games of 10 or 15 minutes per quarter are more realistic in terms of
long term strategy.  Even playing with 15 minute quarters, the longest
games rarely last more than 2 hours.


2. SETTING THE DIFFICULTY LEVEL

    The main differences in levels of difficulty involve speed,
strength and intelligence of play.

* Practice Level

The Practice level operates in single user mode only.  It has been
designed to allow you to practice the coordinated movements necessary
to play at more advanced levels.

The user is always on offense while the computer plays defense.  The
reason for this is that controlling the defense is much simpler than
controlling the offense, and it is important that you be able to
practice the Quarterback plays and handoffs without worrying about
your QB being sacked.

The defense will not move until the ball has passed, or the ball
carrier has crossed the line of scrimmage.  This will give you the
time to learn how to handoff, lateral, and pass, as well as to
discover the variety of plays in the playbook, without the distraction
of worrying about the position of the defenders.

The Practice Level runs at the slowest playing speed.

* Beginner

Unlike the built in "protection" of the Practice level, at the
Beginner level the opposing team begins to move as soon as the ball is
snapped.  Your Quarterback will have to execute his play before
getting sacked by the opposition.

The beginner level can be played with one or two users and follows the
normal structure of a football game.

On single user mode, the computer chooses from a few easy defenses in
order to allow you to develop the necessary proficiency to move up to
higher levels of game play.

Beginner level runs at the slowest playing speed.

* Intermediate

In single user mode, at the Intermediate Level, the computer
Quarterback begins to make intelligent choices of defenses to use
against you.  You will face a stronger opposing team as well.

The Intermediate Level runs at medium speed.

* Advanced

At the Advanced level, you face the semi-pro team.  These Players are
tougher and faster than those you have faced before.

At the speed of the Advanced level, you need to have nerves of steel.
You will be forced to make split second decisions to stay one step
ahead of the lightning fast opposition.

* Pro

If you decide to play at this level, we suggest you have a number of
games under your belt at the lower levels or else you are going to get
"creamed".  If you decide you want to try anyway, go ahead but don't
say you weren't warned...

In single user mode, the Pro Level delivers the greatest challenge of
any level.  Players move at the high speed of the Advanced Level, but
the computer's players have the advantage in strength and speed.  Only
superior strategy and extraordinary skill will lend your team to
victory.

In dual user mode, the defenders on both teams are enhanced, making
scoring at the Pro level more difficult than the lower levels.


3. SELECTING PLAYBOOKS & TEAMS

The default playbooks and teams are loaded with the program and data
during the initial disk bootup.  To play the game with the standard
playbook and standard team, select the "Continue" box.

Before loading a custom playbook or team, insert a disk containing the
playbook/team into the internal drive.

Note: If you attempt to load a Playbook from a disk that does not
contain a playbook, you will be returned to the "Playbook and Team
Selection" screen.

* Loading a Custom Playbook

If the "Load Custom Playbook" option is selected with a valid data
disk in the internal drive, a two column menu will appear on the
screen listing the names of all the Playbooks on that disk.  You can
store up to a maximum of 28 Playbooks per disk.

Selecting a Playbook will cause it to load automatically.  In order to
return to the main menu sequence, a Playbook must be selected.

* Draft New Team - See GRIDIRON! Player Draft, Chapter IV

* Loading a Custom Team

Same procedure as above in "Loading a Custom Playbook".


4. Randomizing Play Numbers
In Dual User Mode, after a user has selected his playbook and team,
the following will appear:

          Setting Up Play Numbers

           o Use Standard Order
           o Random Play Order

Selecting the first option keeps the playbook numbered in order from 0
to 19.  The second option will bring up the following choices:

           o Copy Off Screen
           o Print New Play Numbers

The first option lists the forty play names (twenty per screen) and
their new numbers on the screen for the user to copy.

The second option prints out a hardcopy version of the play names and
their new numbers.  The output is generic and will work with any kind
of printer.

Note: In a Playbook, offensive and defensive plays share common
numbers.  [Example: "Screen Left" (Offense) and "34 Defense" share the
number, "12"]

II. HOW TO PLAY

1. KICKOFFS

When the kickoff is to take place, the teams will automatically line
up in kickoff formation.  The Message Window will appear with the
message "Press button to kick".  The user controlling the kicking team
must decide whether to kickoff normally or to try an onside kick.

If the kicking team's cursor is on its own side of the 50 yard line
when the mouse button is pressed to kick the ball, the ensuing kick
will be an onside kick.  If the cursor is anywhere on the receiving
team's side of the 50 yard line a normal kickoff will take place.

Note: In Single User Mode, User 1 must press his mouse button to
kickoff.  When the computer kicks off, the cursor has no effect on
what kind of kickoff will take place.

2. PLAY SELECTION BOXES:

The Play Selection boxes in the upper left (and upper right) corner(s)
are used to select plays.  The play number is represented by the two
digits in the boxes.  Above and below the digits are boxes containing
arrows.  To increase the value of a digit, move the pointer into the
box above the digit ("up" arrow), and click the mouse button.  To
decrease the value of the digit, click on the "down" arrow box.  Each
click of the mouse increase  (or decreases) the digit by one.  The
digits "wrap around," in that increasing the value of the right digit
from "9" will result in a "0".

Once you have set the play numbers to the desired play, you must
select the play using the Select Box (marked "SEL").

Important: The play will NOT be selected if you do not point and click
inside the Select Box.

OFFENSE:

On offense, you must wait 10 seconds before selecting a play.  [This
delay allows the defense time to set up.]  Until the "Thirty Second
Clock" reaches 19 seconds or below, the "SELect" box will be inactive.
Once the clock has reached 19 seconds, however, you can then SELect
your choice of play.

Once you have selected your offensive play, the scoreboard will
disappear, and the offensive and defensive players will appear in
proper formation.

The Offensive Play Selection Boxes have a "HIKe" box on the far right.
When this box is clicked, both the offensive and defensive selection
boxes disappear, as does the 30-second clock.  There is a 2 second
delay before the ball is hiked.  During this time, the pointer may be
moved into position for the upcoming action.

In Dual User mode only: The ball should not be hiked until at least
one second after the last offensive play has been selected, otherwise
an "Illegal Procedure" penalty will be called.  This has been
incorporated in GRIDIRON! to allow the defense time to respond to
changes in offensive plays.


DEFENSE:

Unlike offense, a defensive play can be chose as soon as the Play
Selection Boxes appear.  Although your team formation may not appear
for a number of seconds, your choice is nevertheless registered by the
computer and will be reflected as soon as the offensive play has been
selected by your opponent.

Offensive and defensive plays can be changed until the ball is hiked,
by using the SELect Box ("Calling an Audible"). [See Section 5,
Selecting Defender Control]

Notes: When using a joystick as a second controller, the defensive
cursor will only appear in 7 places (boxes) on the screen: the
Official Timeout Box, the Team Timeout Box, the four arrow boxes, and
the SELect Box.  This will allow the defender to call his plays and
timeout with the joystick.  Move the joystick back and forth and/or up
and down to position the cursor in the desired box.

When a play has been completed, the field is redrawn, the scoreboard
reappears in the upper middle of the screen, and the Play Selection
Boxes reappear in the upper corner(s) of the screen.

In single player mode, the computer's Play Selection Boxes do not
appear.

In Dual User mode only: The ball should not be hiked until at least
one second after the last offensive play has been selected, otherwise
an "Illegal Procedure" penalty will be called.  This has been
incorporated in GRIDIRON! to allow the defense time to respond to
changes in offensive plays.

Two Minute Warnings:  There are two occurrences of the Two Minute
Warning; when there are two minutes remaining in the second and fourth
quarters respectively.

Team Timeouts:  To call a Timeout, the user should place his pointer
in his team's Timeout Box and click the mouse button.  The Timeout
Boxes are located in the Scoreboard window.  Each team is allowed
three Team Timeouts per half.

Official Timeouts:  Official Timeouts may be called by either user.
They should be used as a game pause function for those times when the
user needs to: answer the telephone, run to the fridge, or generally
deal with reality.  Official Timeouts should NOT be used as an excuse
to give you more time to consider your strategy.  To call and Official
Timeout, either user may move his pointer into the Thirty Second Clock
(located in the bottom center of the screen) and click the mouse
button.

Upon entering a timeout, the following screen will appear:

           o Play Creation Utility - User 1
           o Play Creation Utility - User 2
           o View Team Stats
           o Return to Game

Note: In Single User Mode, the Play Creation Utility option for User 2
will not appear.

At this point, the user who called the Timeout must choose which
option to exercise:

Play Creation Utility - see Chapter V

View Team Stats - Choosing this option, allows a user(s) to  compare
current statistics for each team.  These statistics also appear at the
end of each quarter.  Two notes on the Team Stats screen:

     a.  The QB Stats line has three numbers (separated by hyphens)
for each team's quarterback.  The first number is the number of pass
completions, the second number is pass attempts, and the third number
is interceptions.

     b.  The Punt line has two numbers (separated by a slash) for each
team's punter.  The first number is the number of times that team has
punted the ball and the second number is the average yards per punt.


4. OFFENSE

The mouse controls one player per team.  When the ball is in play, the
player being controlled chases his respective pointer, allowing the
user to make the player go in any direction.

On offense, the mouse controls the ball carrier.  If the ball is
transferred to another player by means (hand-off, pitch, or pass), the
mouse will take control of that player as soon as he has possession of
the ball.

All eligible receivers are indicated by a "stripe" on their uniform.
This feature has been provided to make receivers more visible during
pass plays.

As long as the ball has not crossed the line of scrimmage or been
passed forward, all computer controlled players continue to execute
their pre-programmed commands ["Backfield Mode"].

IMPORTANT: When in Backfield Mode, the ball carrier will stop all
movement as long as the left mouse button is pushed down.  This
feature is important to the execution of hand-offs, passes, punts, and
kicks.

An additional mode of importance is: "Open Field Mode".  There are
times in most plays when each player's pre-programmed commands are no
longer useful.  Open Field Mode has been designed to handle many of
these situations.  In Open Field Mode, the computer commands all
teammates of the ball carrier to block and all opponents to pursue the
ball.  Open Field Mode occurs in the following situations:
     1) When a punt, kick or forward pass has been caught.
     2) After an interception.
     3) When the ball carrier crosses the line of scrimmage.

RUNNING PLAYS

Plays 0-9 in the Playbook are programmed as running plays.  These
plays normally involve either a handoff or a pitch to another player.
Remember, however, that you control the action.  If you want to avoid
handing-off, pitching, or passing, just have the Quarterback run with
the ball on any of the offensive plays.

Hand-Offs

Hand-Offs are one of the more difficult aspects of playing GRIDIRON!.
The technique takes practice to master but is worth the effort.
Handing-off to the running backs will improve your chances of gaining
yardage as running backs are usually faster that your Quarterback and
will not be tackled as easily by defenders.

To execute a hand-off, the ball carrier is moved close to the player
who has been designated to receive the hand-off and depress the left
mouse button to transfer the ball.  If the players are within range
while the mouse button is pressed, the ball will be transferred; if
not, the ball carrier will hang on to the ball, and remain stationary
until the left mouse button is released.  [See Tips, below]

Remember that as soon as the ball has been handed off, the mouse
button should be raised and the pointer placed so that the new ball
carrier will run in the proper direction.

IMPORTANT:  A hand-off can only be give to the player programmed to
receive it.  Any attempt to hand-off to other players will be ignored
by the computer.

TIPS:

1) DO NOT run the quarterback into the player receiving the hand-off!
Even the slightest delay cause by the collision can reduce yardage
gained by the play.  With practice, you will be able to determine just
how close the two players must be in order to hand-off successfully.

2) Estimate the path of the running back, position the ball carrier
near the path and press the mouse button.  While waiting for the
running back to come within range, move the pointer in the direction
you want the running back to move when he assumes possession of the
ball.

3) Immediately after the running back comes into hand-off range, (and
the ball is transferred), lift up on the mouse button.  Remember that
the ball carrier will be stopped for as long as the mouse button is
held!  If you have positioned the pointer to where you want the
running back to go, he will move in that direction without hesitation.

Use Practice level to develop your hand-off technique.

PASSING PLAYS

Passing has always been one of the most exciting aspects of football,
and GRIDIRON! allows you to experience a very realistic passing game.
Successful execution of a pass requires that you observe the following
steps:

1) The quarterback should drop back 5-10 yards.

2) The quarterback should set up for the pass, or roll out to avoid
the rush, depending on the play and the defense.  To set up for a
pass, hold down on the mouse button to stop the Quarterback  and allow
free movement of the pointer.

3) The time that it should take your Quarterback to get into a
position to pass should be enough time for you to see how the well
defense is covering your receivers.  Estimate how much time your
quarterback has before being sacked by the rush and the scan for the
most open receiver.

4) Move your pointer to a spot on the field that will allow your
receiver to catch the ball without any defenders having time to get to
the ball and break up the pass.  Once the pointer is in position, lift
up on the mouse button.  The ball will immediately be thrown toward
that spot.  The computer calculates which receiver has the best change
of catching the pass, and automatically adjust the path of that
receiver to be at the correct place at the correct time.

Experience and a good sense of timing will help you develop the
judgement necessary to throw a successful pass.

TIPS:

When choosing where to throw the ball, take into account that your
receivers have momentum and a maximum speed.  Just as in real
football, when you pass don't forget to "lead" your receiver.

If a rusher is in the process of sacking the Quarterback as the ball
is thrown and the quarterback is not yet down, the pass will be thrown
wild in the same general direction as the pointer.  Be careful!  This
is an open invitation for an interception!

Whenever a player catches the ball (defender or receiver), mouse
control is transferred immediately to that player.

When the ball arrives to where it has been thrown, the computer checks
to see which players are close enough to catch the pass.  At this
point, there are three possible outcomes:

1) A Completed Pass:  Occurs when only a receiver is close enough to
catch the ball.  All players will enter Open Field Mode.

2) An Interception: Occurs when only a defender is close enough to
catch the ball.  All players will enter Open Field Mode.

3) An Incomplete Pass: Occurs when both the receiver and defender are
close to the ball, or if no player is close enough to catch the ball.

NOTE: If a player is in a position to catch the ball, a member of the
opposite team does not always have to be close enough to catch the
ball himself to stop the completion.  The ball could still be knocked
down if he is on the side of the receiver from where the pass was
thrown and in close proximity to the ball.


PUNTING:

In GRIDIRON!, the technique of punting is similar to passing.  When
the punter receives the ball, he acts as a normal runner until the
mouse button is pushed.  While the mouse button is held down the user
can direct the pointer to where the ball is to be kicked.  When the
mouse button is released, the punter will punt the ball toward that
point.  It should be noted that punts are far less precise than
passes.

When the ball has been punted the following occurs:

1) The computer determines which defender is closest to the punt's
destination and will move that defender into position to catch the
ball.  If the chosen defender is being controlled by the mouse, the
computer will override the mouse and move him into position.  Once the
ball is caught, mouse control is resumed.

2) The 10 defenders who are not going to return the punt will drop
back to block.

3) The offensive players will begin to run downfield to pursue the
ball.


Additional Points:

If the ball lands on the ground, all 22 players will run toward it.

If a player from the punting team recovers it, the ball is downed
there.

If a player from the receiving time recovers the ball, all players
enter Open Field Mode.


5. DEFENSE

Playing defense is much easier than playing offense.  The only thing
that defensive user has to do is move his mouse-controlled player to
those areas on the field that will best strengthen his defense.  In
other words, you are the back-up man who is in a position to act
quickly upon any potential weakness in your defense or your opponent's
offense.

Selecting Defender Control

After the offensive play has been selected, the offensive and
defensive formations appear on the screen.  At this time the defensive
user should decide which player he wishes to control, and place his
pointer over that player.  During the two seconds before the ball is
snapped, (during the time the quarterback can be heard calling the
count), the defensive user can select who he wants control by pressing
the mouse button while his pointer is over the chosen player.  A white
diamond will appear on that player as soon as the button is pressed
indicating that control has been transferred to that player.  If no
player is chosen within this time period, the computer will choose one
for you.

Note:  When using a joystick as a second controller, the defender must
use the joystick button to select which player he will control.  Each
time the joystick button is pressed during the allotted two second
time period, the white diamond will appear on a new player.  When play
execution starts, the player with the white diamond on him will be
controlled by the joystick.

III. STRATEGY


1. OFFENSE

The strategy of GRIDIRON! is very much like real football.  When
calling offensive plays, try to call plays that suit the situation
(i.e. don't call a Quarterback Sneak on 2nd and 10 to go).  At the
same time, try not to be too predictable.  Look for defensive patterns
and try to find weaknesses.

The passing game can seem more exciting than the running game and, if
successful, can gain large chunks of yardage in a very short time.
The team that will succeed against difficult opponents, however, is
the team that balances running with passing.  By selecting a mix of
running and passing plays, you will have a better chance of fooling
the defense and gaining more yardage.
Practice and experience make the difference on offense.  Perfecting
handoffs and pitches will add an enormous punch to your running game.
Use the Practice level to practice execution of all the plays.

Notes on each of the offensive plays in the Standard Playbook follow:

* Quarterback Sneak - This play will gain you very little ground, but
can be effective in short yardage situations.

* Fullback Blast - This probably won't get more than a couple of
yards, but is effective because the fullback reaches the line of
scrimmage so quickly.

* 42 Run - The time it takes the halfback to get the ball usually
allows the user to spot a hole.  This play is not effective against a
6 man defensive line.  If the halfback can get through the defensive
lineman, this play can be a big gainer.

* Fullback Trap - This is a tricky play.  The trap blocking usually
opens a hole for the fullback, but the delay in the development of the
action can be disastrous if the defense is blitzing.

* Sweep Left - This is an easy play to run.  The fullback is normally
not very fast, so this play is more effective if the fullback does not
swing out too wide before heading upfield.

* Sweep Right - If the halfback has good speed and gets some running
room, this play can gain you good yardage.

* Pitch Left - Without a doubt, this is the most dangerous running
play of all.  If the defense isn't ready for it, this play will make
big yardage, but if the defense is ready for it, this play can result
in a fumbled lateral.

* Pitch Right - Again, there is the danger of a fumbled lateral, but
the fullback is hard to bring down if he gets outside.

* Reverse - This is a very tricky play to execute well.  Do not try
this one too often; wait until the defense can be fooled.  This play
can result in large gains, or large losses.

* Fullback Draw - This is another tricky play.  Generally, a Fullback
Draw will only work against pass defenses.

* 31 Pass - This play can take a long time to develop, but be patient.
If the Fullback makes it through the defensive line, he should be wide
open over the middle.

* Halfback Option - This is a useful play which requires very quick
decision-making.  Look for the Quarterback to be wide open or lots of
running room on the outside.

* Screen Left - Don't wait too long to throw the pass or your blockers
will cross the line of scrimmage.  This play may not gain a lot of
yardage but is usually good for at least a few yards.

* Screen Right - Similar to Screen Left.

* Flood Pass - You have five receivers going out on this one but you
also have less blockers.  There should be someone open, so pass
quickly or you're going to get sacked.

* Halfback Fly -  The success of this pass will vary greatly depending
upon your defensive coverage.  If your halfback is open, however, you
can make very big yardage on this play.

* Cutback Pass - This play is not designed to gain more than five or
six yards but has a better chance of completion.  Throwing to a
receiver after he has cut back toward the Quarterback makes a
successful pass easier to throw.

* Hail Mary - This is a desperation pass when you need long yardage in
a hurry.  Chances of a completion are slim but cross your fingers,
throw the ball and maybe you'll get lucky...

* Punt - Careful placement can sometimes place your opponent in bad
situations.  Kick it out of bounds or try to get the opposition to
catch the ball deep in their own territory!

* Field Goals - If the ball is outside your opponent's 35, kicking a
field goal is difficult.  This depends, of course, upon your team's
kick rating.


2. DEFENSE

Defensive Plays 0-9 are primarily run defenses, 13-18 are pass
defenses, and 10-12 are a balance of the two.

In general, it is far safer to rely upon pass defenses as you are
going to give up far less yardage to a run on a pass defense than you
would to a pass on a run defense.  Just one good pass by your opponent
can lose you the game. Nevertheless, throwing a few odd defenses to
keep your opponent guessing wouldn't hurt.

In situations where you are not sure what the offense will do, it's
good to control one of the safety men to limit his yardage.  If you
think you know what play he is going to call, however, control the
defensive position you think will cause the most damage to his play.

* Goal Line Defense - Very good in short yardage situations but if the
opposition gets much past the line of scrimmage, you will have a tough
time stopping them from going all the way.

* 61 Defense - This play is also good in short yardage situations, but
is less likely to allow big gains.

* Spread 61 Defense - Use this defense in situations when you think
the offense will run but you are not sure when.

* 61 Stunt Defense - This defense give the impression you are going to
protect against a run up the middle when you are really protecting
against a run to the outside.

* Shift Left - This play is very effective against runs or short
passes to your left side.  If the offense runs to your right, however,
you could be in trouble.

* Shift Right - Similar to Shift Left, opposite side.

* Left LB Blitz - Blitzing the extra man can really break up an
offensive play.  But don't use this play too often as you can get
nailed badly if he calls a good pass against you.

* Right LB Blitz - Similar to a Left LB Blitz, other side.

* Double LB Blitz - Twice the blitz and twice the risk.

* Full Blitz - This is a very dangerous defense.  Great against runs
up the middle and sweeps, but can be disastrous against pitches and
passes.  Also a good way to shake up an inexperienced Quarterback.

* 43 Defense - A non-committal, balanced defense.  Use when you don't
know what to expect from the offense.

* Spread 43 Defense - This defense is particularly effective against
short passes, pitches and sweeps.  This is the best defense to use
against a pitch play.

* 34 Defense - This is good when you think the offense is going to to
run the outside or pass.

* 61 Pass Defense - This defense may lead the offense to believe you
are defending against a run while you are actually set up in a pass
defense.  This is not the most effective pass defense, however.

* Short Zone - Probably the best overall pass coverage against a short
to medium length pass.

* 5 Man Coverage - Primarily a man-to-man coverage situation.
Effective against passes to the flanker and the two ends, it still
allows six men to cover against a running play.  The weakness of this
play is that it will not work well against receivers coming out of the
backfield.

* 7 Man Zone - This is a good defense against a deep pass but the
formation does not give away your strategy.  This play is very poor
against the run.

* 8 Man Zone - Use this play when you are sure the offense will
attempt a deep pass.

* Prevent Defense - Designed to prevent the offense from gaining large
amounts of yardage in short periods of time.  Because it is not
difficult to get first down yardage against this defense, use it only
when the offense has little more time left in the half, or they have
to get fifteen yards or more in the play.

* Punt Return - Do not use this play unless the offense is in punt
formation.


IV. GRIDIRON PLAYER DRAFT

As in real football, each user may want to match the talent of his
players in his game strategy.  [In other words, if you prefer a
passing game, you will want talented receivers, etc...]  In GRIDIRON!
you do this using "PAPs" [Player Ability Points].  Changing PAPs
allows you to modify the characteristics of each player.  Before
modifying a team, opponents must agree to a total number of PAPs they
are allow to use in constructing their teams.  The total PAPs will
correspond directly to the overall capability of their respective
team.

Upon selecting the "Player Draft" option, a new screen will appear
listing the offensive positions and individual characteristics for
each player [speed & strength].  Each player's speed and strength are
rated on a scale from 0 to 20, where 20 is the best.  A rating of 0
means the player has minimal ability.  These characteristics reflect
the team presently in memory, whether the team is the standard team,
or one previously loaded off disk.

Selecting the "Goto Defense" box will replace the offensive positions
with the defensive positions and their characteristics.  [The "Goto
Defense" box then becomes the "Goto Offense" box.]  Note that the
Kicker Rating remains on the screen independent of whether the offense
or defense is being displayed.

Note: Total PAPs remain in the lower left side of the screen and
automatically update as player characteristics are changed.
1. MODIFYING PLAYER CHARACTERISTICS
Use the pointer to change player characteristics in the following way:

To increase a PAP number, place the pointer over the top half of the
number and press the mouse button.

To decrease a PAP number, place the pointer over the bottom half of
the number and press the mouse button.

While keeping track of Total PAPs, the computer adds up all the points
on both screens for speed and strength.  Because key offensive players
have more impact on the game, their speed and strength are multiplied
by the following factors before being added to the total:

-Left End           X 3       -Right End          X 3
-Quarterback        X 4       -Fullback           X 4
-Halfback           X 4       -Flanker            X 3

-Kick Rating        X 5 [includes punter and place kicker]

2. EFFECTS OF SPEED AND STRENGTH

When adjusting the characteristics of one's players, it is important
to know how those changes may affect game play.

SPEED:

Although actual speed is dependent upon play level, relative speed is
dependent upon Player Ability Points [PAPs].  A player with more PAPs
in the speed category will always be faster than another player with
less PAPs, regardless of level.

STRENGTH:

Strength of a player is important in tackling and blocking:

A strong ball carrier will be brought down much less quickly (if a
all) by a week defender than will a weak ball carrier by a strong
defender.

A weak defender will be able to get past a strong blocker much less
quickly than will a strong defender against a weak blocker.

In collisions, both speed and strength play an important factor.  The
faster and stronger the player, the more dramatically he will affect
the path and speed of the person with whom he collides.

Note: The Gridiron Player Draft is a very good way of handicapping
between users of different experience.


3. SAVING TEAM CHARACTERISTICS

           o Save Team on Data Disc
           o Initialize a Data Disc

           o Continue

When all the modifications have been made, select the "Exit Player
Draft" box.  The computer will ask if the team should be saved on
disk.  If the team is to be saved, insert a data disk into the
internal drive.  The computer will ask for a team name and a suffix to
be entered via the keyboard.  The team name will be used on the
scoreboard whenever that team is loaded from disk.  The suffix is used
to differentiate between different teams with the same name (i.e.
'REDSKINS.84' AND 'REDSKINS.85').

V. PLAY CREATION UTILITY
(PCU)

One of the most unique and powerful features of GRIDIRON! is the
ability to modify plays during a game and save those modifications on
disk.  Although it is not very difficult to modify plays using the
PCU, a good working knowledge of how the players interpret the
commands is recommended highly.  The difference between a successful
play and a disaster can be as little as one player's programming, so
be prepared to spend enough time to "fine tune" plays after making
substantial modifications.

1. ENTERING THE PCU

The only way to enter the PCU is by calling a timeout during the game.
This allows the user to test his plays immediately and "fine tune" his
programming..  If you want to create plays that are particularly
effective against certain defenses, initialize the game for two users.
This will allow you to test your play against whichever defense or
offense you choose.  [In Single User Mode, the computer decides the
opposing play.]

2. PCU OPTIONS MENU

           o Modify Offensive Play
           o Modify Defensive Play

           o Save Playbook on Data Disc
           o Initialize a Data Disc

           o Exit PCU

The PCU Options Menu is the first and last screen you will see when
entering and exiting the PCU.

* Modifying Plays - (Offensive/Defensive)
When a user enters the PCU, he must choose which type of play to
modify [offensive or defensive].  The screen will then list a menu of
the 20 plays of that type.  To select an individual play, click the
box to the left of its name.

* Save Playbook - This function allows the user to save his entire
playbook to disk.

* Initialize a Data Disc - In order to save your programmed plays, you
must use an initialized disk.  Place the intended disk in the internal
drive and invoke this option to initialize a disk.

* Exit PCU - Returns you to the Timeout menu.


3. PCU MAIN MENU

Upon selecting a play, a graphic display of the play's formation will
appear on the screen along with the PCU Main Menu.  The following menu
options will appear:


* Change Name - The user can pick any name up to 14 characters long.

* Set Formation - Select a player by using the pointer.  The player
will turn white.  Clicking on the mouse again will place the player on
the filed, whereupon his original color will return.

The computer will not allow the user to place a player in a position
breaking any of the following rules:

          1) Players cannot touch
          2) Players cannot be positioned offsides.

          3) Players must be positioned within the field area
             provided by the PCU.

* Edit Player - This function allows the user to change a player's
commands.  The player is selected using the pointer.

* Save Play - Will enter the modifications that have been made to a
play into the current playbook in memory.  This function will NOT put
the play onto disk.  If this function is not used, any modifications
made during the session will be lost.

* New Play - Selecting this box will exit the user from the PCU Main
Menu.  At this point the user can select a new play or exit the PCU.

WARNING!
  If the Save Play function has not been used, exiting the PCU Main
Menu will erase all modifications to a play!  In addition, you must
invoke the "Save Playbook" option prior to exiting the PCU if you want
to save your session to disc.

4. MODIFYING PLAYER COMMANDS

When editing a player:

     1) The player will turn white.

     2) The Command Display Window will appear in the upper right
        corner of the screen.

     3) One of the two editing menus will replace the PCU Main
        Menu on the left side of the screen.

          A. Edit Offensive Player [EOP] Menu

The EOP Menu is used whenever an offensive player's commands are
edited.

* Run Block - When selected, a Message Window will appear to ask the
user if the player should block left or right.

* Pass Block - This command differs from Run Blocking in that the
player will not move forward to block, only backwards and laterally.
This guarantees that pass blockers will not cross the line of
scrimmage during a pass play.

* Delay - Once selected, the Message Window will appear to allow
selection of the number of counts the player will delay. [One count
equals approximately one second].

* Run To - When selected, the user mush place the pointer on the field
area and press the mouse button.  A line will be drawn to that point,
marking the path that the player will attempt to follow.

* Hand Off - Once selected, the Message Window will appear asking to
whom the ball should be handed off.  In play, the ball can only be
handed to the player who has been selected.

* Pass - A pass can be thrown to any eligible receiver as long as the
ball carrier is: (1) behind the line of scrimmage and (2) there have
been no forwarded passes made previously during that play.

* Punt - The chosen player will punt the ball when commanded via the
mouse.

* Kick - The player will kick a place kick when commanded via the
mouse.

* Erase Commands - All commands for that player will be erased.

* Exit Menu - Return to the PCU Main Menu.  All changes will be
retained.

          B. Edit Defensive Player [EDP] Menu

The EDP Menu is used whenever a defensive player's commands are
edited.

* Pursue - The defender will pursue and attempt to tackle the ball
carrier.

* Lateral Pursuit - The defender will follow the ball back and forth
across the field, but will not run up and down the field.  Once the
ball is away from the clutter of lineman in the center, the player
will pursue the ball carrier normally.  This command is effective
against offensive plays to the outside.

* Delay - Same as EOP Menu.

* Run To - Same as EOP Menu.

* Cover Receiver - Once Selected, the Message Window will request
which coverage to use.  The choices are man-to-man on any receiver or
zone coverage.  If zone coverage is selected, the Message Window will
list the five zones a defender can cover.  One of the five zones must
then be selected.

* Erase Commands - same as EOP Menu.

* Exit Menu - same as EOP Menu.

5. SELECTING COMMAND SEQUENCES

There are programmable commands which the player can complete, and
commands which go on indefinitely.

     Completable              Non-Completable
     Commands                    Commands

     * Delay                  * Run Block
     * Run To                 * Pass Block
     * Hand Off               * Pursue
     * Pass                   * Lateral Pursuit
     * [Punt]                 * Cover Receiver
     * Kick

All non-completable commands continue until the end of the play, or
until they are replaced automatically by the computer.  If the
computer reprograms the players, the original commands will not be
used for the remainder of the play.

When creating a command sequence, (there is a three command limit.),
for a player to execute, it must be remembered that the player will
automatically move to the next command upon the completion of the
former command.  For this reason, exercise care in the sequencing of
commands.  For example, a Pass Block followed by a Run To command does
not make sense - the player would not recognize the end of his Pass
Block assignment and therefore would never execute the Run To command.
The reverse order would work, however.  The player would Run To the
programmed location and then begin his Pass Blocking assignment.

Note on Punts: As the computer reprograms all players when a Punt has
taken place, no user-programmed command can be executed after a punt.
For this reason, the punt cannot be considered a truly completable
command.

Automatic Command Modes:

The commands that you program in a given play are only executed during
Backfield Mode.  These commands determine the initial development of
the play.  At key points during play execution, it is no longer
beneficial for the players to continue executing their original
commands.  At these times, GRIDIRON! enters different modes of play
that override the Backfield Mode.  This occurs in the following
situations.

1) Pass Mode: When a pass is thrown, defenders are programmed to break
off their coverage and Run To [Ref. Chapter V, Sec. 4A] where the ball
is being passed.

2) Open Field Mode:  All offensive players (except the ball carrier)
are programmed to block.  All defenders are programmed to pursue the
ball. [Ref. Chapter II, Sec. 4]

3) Punt Mode:  This mode occurs while a kick-off or punt is in the
air.  Kicking team players run downfield and receiving team members
drop back and block. [Ref. Chapter II, Sec. 4]

4) Loose Ball Mode: Whenever the ball is on the ground and no player
has possession, all players who are not programmed for lateral pursuit
or pass coverage will run toward the ball.

REVIEWING A GAME USING A VCR:

If you want to analyze a particular game of GRIDIRON!, you can hook up
to a VCR (Videocassette Recorder) to the VIDEO output of your computer
and into the VIDEO INput of the VCR.  If you want audio as well,
attach the AUDIO OUT channels to the AUDIO IN of your VCR.  Using this
method you will be able to record any portion of the game.  If you
have a sophisticated unit with speed control, you can even simulate a
slo-mo (slow motion) effect, to carefully analyze plays.
