 VERSION 0.1  (September 7, 1997)
 Basic information.  Much of this FAQ is based on my earlier Japanese FF7
 FAQ.  Created GameShark codes 'Item Select', 'Materia Select' and
 'Character Select' have been included.  If the FAQ seems a bit sloppy
 right now, well, it is based on the Japanese FAQ so it'll take a revision
 or two to get everything into shape, as this is a big file :)

 Also, my spell-checker and 'find/replace' options went a little crazy,
 so if you spot any strange mistakes, please let me know! ^_^;

 Began construction of VERSION 0.0 on August 18th, 1997

 If this is your first time playing FF7, then trust me, you'll enjoy it.
 If you were around back when I was working on the Japanese FF7 FAQ, then
 I'd like to say, "Welcome back!"  Square has a lot in store for us gamers
 and this version of FF7 is by far the best, in my opinion.

 For those of you who don't know, there are three versions of FF7.  The
 first one is the original Japanese game.  The second is the English-text
 release you've probably popped into your PlayStation just now.  The third
 version is the pending Japanese re-release, which is just like the one
 you're playing, but with Japanese text :)  If you're looking for a FAQ
 for the original Japanese version, then please download my Japanese FF7
 FAQ from:
               <www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Park/7990/>

 It's divided into two parts, "The Complete Walkthrough", and "Extra Stuff
 You Should Know".  Since the combined size of both documents stands at
 993,670 kB, I think you'll be able to find just about whatever you're
 looking for in one part or another.

 If you want a FAQ for the Japanese re-release, then I suggest you check
 out that FAQ, too, but refer to this one if you want information on new
 things added to the game, like the Weapon monster scenarios.  And if you
 want a FAQ for the English-text version of FF7, then you're at the right
 place, keep reading.

 Please don't ask me to send you a copy of either FAQ because I don't have
 the time to send them out to everyone who asks, and secondly, this isn't
 my e-mail address.  However, if you have any suggestions, corrections,
 questions, or comments, then you can reach me via <cgfm2@hooked.net>.
 Comments are always welcome and I'll be happy to answer any questions I
 recieve either via e-mail or I'll include an answer in the upcoming
 revision of the FAQ.  I won't answer questions if they are already
 answered in either of the FAQs, so please read whichever document you are
 using carefully before e-mailing me.

 FF7 demo disc packaged with Tobal No. 1 and other FF7 demos.)

   @{b}3 . 1      m a k o r o   p o w e r   p l a n t@{ub}
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------

 ITEMS IN THIS AREA:  Potion x3, Phoenix Down, Restore materia,
                      Assault Gun.

 At the start of the game, you'll have 3 Potions, a Phoenix Down, and an
 Ether.  You can't equip Materia until you reach Section 3.3, by the way.

 Once you leave the train, check the body of the closest guard twice to
 get two Potions.  Then head north.  You'll be attacked by some guards.
 Take them out with your sword (you may win a Potion for killing them)
 and then move left to go outside.  Now, talk to your teammates (Biggs,
 Wedge, and Jessie), then name yourself and Barret.  Make your way to the
 northwestern door, and head up in the next room to enter the heart of
 the power plant.

 Talk to Barret, (who joins you) and then talk to each Avalanche member
 to open the doors.  After opening the second door, head right to enter
 another chamber with a treasure chest (Phoenix Down).  Then, go back
 and enter the elevator (you'll have to talk to Jessie first).  Press the
 arrow switch to activate it.

 Work your way down the stairs and go through the door to the left.  Then
 follow Jessie down the ladder.  When he stops, search the area in front
 of him for a Potion (it's hard to see because of the steam).  Climb
 down, cross the pipes, descend the nearby ladder, and take note of
 the Save Point before heading down the walkway.

 Pick up the Restore materia on the ground in the next area and set the
 bomb.  An alarm will sound and you'll have to fight the boss, a huge
 scorpion-like machine.

 _________________________________________________________________________
 @{b}BOSS TIPS: GUARD SCORPION                          LV: ??  HP: 800  MP: 0@{ub}

 Cloud's Bolt magic works well, while Barret should be attacking.  The
 Search Scope won't damage you, it just warns as to who the boss will
 attack next.  When you've done enough damage, the boss will start to
 shake and Barret will warn Cloud.  From this point onward, don't attack
 the boss and heal yourself or simply guard until the boss attacks you.
 If you try to hurt it during this time, the boss responds with a damaging
 laser ray shot from his tail.  A few more hits after it stops shaking and
 the boss dies.  You'll get an Assault Gun when you kill it.
 _________________________________________________________________________

 You now have ten minutes to escape from the power plant.  You'll need
 to make your way back to the upside-down T-shaped entrance hall where
 one of the Avalanche members is waiting.  (If you've played the demo
 disc, know that you don't need to 'search' for the other members; just
 talk to Jessie to free him and then get out.  Since Barret gets a new
 gun after the battle, be sure to equip it.  Also, talk to the other
 members to open the two doors on your way back.

 ITEMS IN THIS AREA:  Potion.

 After the Avalanche members blow up the passage, head up the stairs.
 You'll meet Aeris here, but she won't join you yet.  In the next
 screen, there's a Potion to the southwest of the circular structure
 (near the lampposts).  Walk south when you're done.  In this next area,
 you'll meet up with guards and have the choice of running (bottom
 choice) or fighting (top choice).  After a few more encounters with the
 Shinra guards, Cloud'll jump onto the passing train and run into the
 Avalanche gang.  After talking to them, walk to the 'front' of the
 screen and you'll jump off into another area.  Talk to the people here
 and one of the members (Jessie) will show you a picture of the Makoro
 plant on the train's screen.  Approach Barret and you'll end up going
 to the group's base.

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
   @{b}3 . 3      a v a l a n c h e   b a s e@{ub}
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------

 ITEMS IN THIS AREA:  1500 gil, All materia, Ether.

 Head west and go upwards.  Talk to the kid by the fence, then head west
 again (there's a Save Point nearby, too).  Talk to the people here,
 then check out the bar.  At the top of the tallest building in the south-
 east is a bedroom.  The kid here will let you spend the night for 10 gil.

 In the bar, you'll meet Tifa, who is also a member of Avalanche, as well
 as Marlene, who is supposedly Barret's daughter.  After naming Tifa,
 Barret shows up when you try to leave and reveals the hidden base
 underneath the bar.  After talking to Barret, Tifa shows up.  Leave the
 base and you'll have a short intermission with Tifa.   When you meet
 Barret afterwards, he'll give you 1500 gil.  If you go to the Beginner's
 Hall above the Weapon Shop outside, you can learn more about playing the
 game.  You'll also find that there inside the huge cage.  The man in
 the right corner of this room has a Materia by his feet (All).  Take it
 and a chest will drop down that has an Ether inside of it.  If you
 haven't already noticed, the two buildings that were locked the other
 day are now open.

 When you're ready, go back to the train station to prepare for
 Avalanche's next mission.  If you like, you can go to the far right to
 enter a train yard, but there's not much of interest there.

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
   @{b}3 . 4      m a k o   r e a c t o r   n u m b e r   f i v e@{ub}
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------

 ITEMS IN THIS AREA:  Ether x2, Potion, Tent, Titan Bangle.

 Board the train.  When the timer appears after you talk to Tifa, go
 through each train car until Tifa jumps off one of the cars and you and
 Barret follow her.  You'll end up in an underground railroad passageway.
 If you go south (towards the 'front' of the screen), you'll go through
 the same screen 5 times before coming to two guards who you can fight.
 When the battle's over, choose the bottom option to keep fighting or the
 top option to run away.  You can fight the same battle over and over,
 so when you get tired of fighting, just pick the top option.  An OK place
 to gain some experience, gil, and AP, if you think you'll need it.

 Anyway, it's a lot faster to just head north to where the green barrier
 is and go down the hatch to the west (examine it and choose the top
 choice twice or the middle option once).  Pick up the Ether in the
 adjoining passage, climb down the two ladders, and talk to Wedge.  Then
 go up the ladder near him to reach a room where Jessie is waiting for
 you.  Take the Potion that's next to him and climb down the ladder on the
 far left end of the room to reach a chamber where you can find a Tent, a
 Save Point, and Biggs.

 Go up the ladder here to reach the No. 5 Reactor.  The room you're in
 should be familiar.  Slide down the pipe and then work your way back to
 the heart of the plant.  After Cloud fiddles with the machinery, go back
 to the large room and climb up the stairs and into the elevator.  It'll
 take you to a new floor.  Grab the contents of the treasure chest outside
 (Ether) and then head to the left where there are three control panels.
 You'll need to hit your panel as the same time Barret and Tifa hit
 theirs (using the O button), so give it a shot.  Instead of waiting for
 them to raise their arms, you'll have an easier time if you time it so
 that you hit your panel _just_ before they do.  You can't use the panel
 if you didn't go back to the heart of the power plant.  Afterwards, go
 through the opened gate (there's a Save Point here), and head north.

 In the T-shaped room, you'll be stopped by a group of guards, and then
 meet President Shinra.  After that, a helicopter and a hydrofoil-like
 machine show up.  The Shinra president leaves in the helicopter, but
 the huge machine attacks you and your friends.

                                                   Weak against Lightning

 This machine turns to face (and attack) whomever hits it.  So, if one of
 your characters is low on life, have the person on the opposite side
 attack to draw the boss' attention away.  Be especially careful of it's
 Big Bomber--it causes tons of damage  (but also increases your Limit
 meter quickly).  Remember that even if it's back is turned, it can use a
 weak machine gun attack on you.  Use potions and the Restore Materia to
 keep up your HPs and use Bolt as well as your Limit Break attacks to take
 this machine out.  You'll receive a Titan Bangle if you win the battle.

 ITEMS IN THIS AREA:  5 gil, Potion, Phoenix Down, Cover materia, Ether.

 After the battle, the boss will explode, sending Cloud off the walkway
 in the ensuing blast.  When you awake, you'll find yourself in a church.
 Aeris is here, and you can name her after talking to her several times.
 Reno shows up afterwards with some guards.  In the next room, Aeris
 falls down while trying to escape with Cloud.  Tell her to hold on.
 You now have the option of fighting the guards using Aeris or trying to
 bean the guards on the head with barrels on the upper floor (if you
 miss, you'll have to fight using Aeris anyway).  Remember, she starts off
 in the back row, so to increase damage, make her move up by choosing
 'Change' at the start of each battle (do this by pressing left, then the
 O button).

 The correct order of barrels to drop is: the leftmost barrel (in the
 back), the far right barrel (in the back), and the far right barrel
 (in the front).  Simply tell Aeris to hold on each time, examine each
 barrel, and choose the top option to drop it.  This way, Aeris won't
 have to fight anybody.  When Aeris meets you at the top of the chapel,
 she'll hook up with Cloud.

 In the upper area, climb up the second beam on the left and jump out of
 the hole in the roof.  After you and Aeris make it back to ground level,
 head left to find a Save Point.  To the northwest is a town.  Be sure to
 meet the man in the pipe near the entrance.  In one of the houses, you
 can also find 5 gil if you talk to the drunk man in bed, then examine
 the drawers nearby.  There are several stores here in the slums,
 including one that sells Materia.  To the far, far right is a path that
 leads to Aeris's house and a garden.   You can spend the night here once
 you've met Elmyra, Aeris's mother.  When you wake up, look between the
 desk and the bed for a Potion and a Phoenix Down.  Then, sneak downstairs
 (or Aeris will make you go back to bed) and leave the house (you can do
 this by not touching the walls and not running, either).  In the lower
 flower bed to the right, you can get a Protect materia and an Ether.
 There's another Save Point near Aeris' house if you need to use it.

 Leave the town and go left to the hole in the wall.  Aeris will be here
 waiting for you and will rejoin you.  In the next location, work your
 way upward (by going across the hole-filled metal length, then down the
 iron beams and through the passage, then up the brown pipe and finally
 down the stairs and heading to the left).  After Aeris leaves you at the
 playground, head east, then go north to arrive at the Wall Market.

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------

 ITEMS IN THIS AREA:  Ether, Phoenix Down, Hyper.

 Aeris rejoins you (again) here.  There's a Save Point in the upper-right
 part of the village.  The building in the lower left is an inn, where you
 can spend the night for 10 gil.  To the right of it is the entrance to a
 brothel.  The building in the middle has nothing in it but a computer.
 (If you touch it, a machine gun will fire at you and Cloud jumps away.
 You can't do anything here until later).  Just above that building is an
 item shop.  North of the shop is a sushi bar.  Finally, there is a
 clothing store to the upper left and some sort of pottery store to the
 upper right.  A path by the clothing store leads to another part of town.
 Here, there is a gym, a restaurant, and a weapon shop.  In the northern
 area lies a large building.  If you go east from here, you'll reach a
 dead-end area.

 Your objective in this part of the game is to sneak into the large
 building where Tifa is being kept.  To do this, Cloud will have to
 dress up as a woman in order to get inside since men aren't allowed
 into the building.  So, follow these steps to get the items you need
 to 'alter' Cloud's appearance.  You may want to read this entire
 section before starting so that you'll know how your choices will
 affect the game.

 a)  Go to the brothel and talk to the big guy with silver hair who's
     chatting with the bouncer at the door.  Talk to him and pick the
     first option to inquire about Tifa.

 b)  Go back to the building at the end of town (Corneo's mansion) and
     talk to the guy near the door.  Aeris and Cloud will move away and
     have a short conversation.  She tells Cloud that he'll have to
     dress up if he wants to find out if Tifa's okay.

 c)  Return to the first screen, go to the clothing store, and talk to
     the store owner by standing near the bottom edge of the counter.
     She'll tell you that you can't get a dress unless you do something
     about her drunk father.

 d)  Go to the bar in the second screen and talk to the lone man by the
     door.  During the conversation, you'll have to make two decisions.
     So when you're asked a question, pick either the first or second
     choice.  After you're done talking to the man, return to the
     clothing store.

 e)  At the store, you'll see that the man from the inn is now behind
     the counter.  Talk to him and you'll receive an item based upon
     your decisions:

     - If you answered: first choice, first or second choice, you'll
       get the Cotton Dress.
     - If you answered: second choice, first choice, you'll be given
       the Satin Dress.
     - If you answered: second choice, second choice again, he'll give
       you the Silk Dress.

 f)  Cloud will try on the dress, but won't actually wear it.  Leave
     the clothing store and go to the second screen.  Enter the gym
     and converse with the woman (heh) by the fighting ring.  When you
     have the chance, pick the bottom option twice to start fighting,
     although if you want to practice, you can choose the bottom
     option, then the top one.  Anyway, as soon as the message box
     disappears, start pressing the S, X, and O buttons repeatedly in
     that order.  The object of the game is to go fast enough to make
     Cloud do more squats than the African gymnast, but you don't want
     to press the buttons too fast or Cloud can't keep up.  It's not
     too hard to win since the other guy will often stop to scratch his
     head, but you only have 30 seconds, so get in as many squats as you
     can.

     - If you are able to do more squats than the gymnast, you'll be
       given the Blonde Wig.
     - If you and the gymnast have the same score, the lady will give
       you the Dyed Wig.
     - If the gymnast does better than you, then the lady will give
       you the Wig.

 At this point, you can just return to the clothing shop and enter the
 stall; Cloud will dress up as a woman and you can return to Corneo's
 mansion to get inside.  You can also choose to not change yet and
 explore more of the Wall Market, picking up items that you can use to
 make Cloud more 'feminine'.  If you're finished, then skip down a ways
 to find out what to do next.  Otherwise, keep reading (these events
 can be done in any order):

 g)  Go to the pottery shop.  When you have to choose an answer, pick
     the top one twice.  (You can't talk to him unless you chatted with
     the guard at the north building).  Then go to the inn and pay 10 gil
     to spend the night.  In the middle of the night, you'll find
     yourself in front of the vending machine in the outer hallway.  Pick
     any option (I hope you have enough gil).  The next morning, return
     to the pottery shop and talk to the man to get an item:

     - If you bought the first item (200 gil), he'll give you the
       Diamond Tiara.
     - If you bought the second item (100 gil), he'll give you the
       Ruby Tiara.
     - If you bought the third item (50 gil), he'll give you the
       Glass Tiara.

     (Note that the dialogue here was changed from the Japanese version,
     in which you were buying a 'gift' for the shopkeeper's girlfriend
     that he was too embarrassed to buy <can you guess?>  Why this was
     changed, I have no idea.)

 h)  Enter the sushi bar and walk past the empty seat.  When a message
     appears, choose the top option.  Then choose any option, (you'll
     need 70 gil), followed by the middle choice ("the food was all
     right") to get a Pharmacy Coupon.  Now go to the item store and
     talk to the man behind the Counter Attack.  Choose one of the three
     options to get an item, then head back to the restaurant.  Go to
     the bathroom and talk to the woman inside.  Accept the first choice
     and:

     - You'll get the Cologne if you traded the Coupon for the
       Disinfectant.
     - You'll get the Flower Cologne if you traded the Coupon for the
       Deodorant.
     - You'll get the Sexy Cologne if you traded the Coupon for the
       Digestive (medicine).

 i)  Talk to the large man in the white shirt who's standing near the
     edge of the screen in the first area to get the Member's Card.
     He won't give it to you unless you talked to the guard by the door
     of the Corneo's mansion. Head right to arrive at the brothel.
     If you talk to the bouncer, he'll let you in once he sees the Card,
     but Aeris won't come with you (yes, they messed up the dialogue
     here, too).

     Inside the Honeybee Inn, you'll find that the doors on the right side
     are locked, but if you chose the bottom option, you can look inside
     them and peer around using the control pad and the O button.  If you
     look in the upper-right keyhole, you'll see a familiar face...a small
     version of Cait Sith!  If you go to the north room and talk to the
     farthest girl on the right several times, you can choose the top
     option to make her dance faster and faster.  When you're ready (you
     better brace yourself), you can do one or the other:

     Examine the lower-left door and pick the top option twice.  In the
     room, talk to the girl and pick the top option three times to take
     a soak with Mukki and his friends.  Answer however you like while
     in the tub and Cloud will be given the Bikini briefs.

     Or, examine the upper-left door and pick the top option twice.
     Inside, talk to the ghostly Cloud near the stone tub and Cloud
     will have a psychotic episode.  When you come to, all your HP
     and MP is restored, thanks to...Mukki :(  Talk to him and choose
     the bottom option.  Then talk to the girl and you'll get the
     Lingerie.

 All done?  There's nothing left to do now but return to the clothing
 store and dress up as a woman.  When you finish, go to the large building
 in the north and talk to the man by the food carts again.  He'll let you
 into a posh-looking parlor.  Now, go up the stairs and into the door on
 the far left after talking to the receptionist.  Then, go down the
 staircase to the torture room (!) where you'll find Tifa and an Ether by
 the smoldering coals.  Once she's joined you, head back up the stairs
 and go into the middle door.  Inside is Tifa's kidnapper, the nefarious
 Don Corneo.  He will examine each of you when you try to approach him.
 Who he picks for his 'friend' is determined by what items you collected
 in the Wall Market:

  - He'll pick Cloud if you're wearing the Silk Dress, Blonde Wig, and
    have the 'best' extra items (the Diamond Tiara, Sexy Cologne, and
    Lingerie or Bikini briefs.
  - He'll pick Aeris if you're wearing the Silk Dress, the Blonde Wig,
    the Lingerie and the Sexy Cologne (in addition to anything else you
    may have).
  - He'll pick Tifa if you're wearing the Silk Dress, Blonde Wig, and one
    or two of the extra items not mentioned above (or anything worse than
    that).

 If Corneo picked Tifa or Aeris, then read below:

 In the next room, examine the item bag by the bed to get a Phoenix Down,
 and talk to the man by the television set after talking to the other
 henchmen.  After revealing your true nature to the love-struck goons,
 they'll fight you.  This is followed by another fight with the other
 three punks.  Afterward, get Aeris from the torture chamber and then
 go into the middle door again (if Aeris was picked, then you'll meet
 Tifa when you go outside).  When you're through intimidating Corneo,
 look behind his bead for a Hyper, then stand by your allies.  He'll
 make you choose one of three options.  No matter which one you choose,
 you'll fall through a trapdoor.

 If Corneo picked Cloud, then you'll end up in his room.  Search behind
 his bed for a Hyper, then talk to him and answer anyway you like (if
 you try to make Cloud kiss Corneo, then maybe you need to get out of
 the house more....^_^;)  Your friends will burst in and threaten him
 (yeowtch!)  and Corneo will ask you a question; pick any answer you
 like and you'll still plummet to the sewers below.

 Once the cut scene with the Shinra flunkies ends, you'll find yourself
 in a sewer.  Before talking to Tifa or Aeris, climb up the stairs to
 the south and go along the walkway to nab a Potion.  When you try to
 escape, a blue monster appears attacks your party.

 His Sewer Tsunami attack hurts all members, so use Potions and the
 Restore Materia to heal your wounds.  Luckily, the Tsunami will damage
 him, too (he uses this attack as a counterattack before dying if he can
 manage it).  When he does the reverse Sewer Tsunami, it causes less
 damage to him.  Fire spells work the best on him.  Use Cloud's Limit
 Break to harm the boss and use Aeris' Limit Break to heal yourselves.
 You'll receive a Phoenix Down for winning the battle.
 _________________________________________________________________________

 Climb up the ladder and head right.  Go down into the sewage, then up the
 stairs.  Grab the Yellow Materia (Steal) and go down the hatch.  In the
 next room, go down the stairs, then climb up the side of the curved
 structure.  Climb up the ladder and you'll go outside.  There's a Save
 Point here.  Check out the oil drum nearby by entering the train car
 (near the Save Point) to get a Hi-Potion.  Get another Hi-Potion on the
 roof of adjacent car, then hop off onto the iron beam and check the oil
 drum to the north for an Echo Screen.  Walk east, then south and enter
 the nearby train car to get a Potion.  Climb up the ladder, head north,
 and climb down again.  Go north once more through the train car, then
 exit to your left to find a second Potion.  Then, go north to arrive at
 the next screen.

 Here, circle left around the car to get a Potion.  Circle left again to
 find an oil can with an Ether inside of it.  Go north and enter the
 train to the right to move the other train car out of the way.  Climb
 atop the formerly blocked car to net a Hi-Potion.  Now, ride the other
 train back backwards, climb onto the eastern train car, jump onto the
 train you just moved, and climb across it and the last car before going
 down the ladder to get back to the front part of the Train Graveyard.

 Head left.  The Avalanche members will be fighting atop the support
 pillar you first saw when you arrived at the base.  After Wedge plummets
 to the ground, save your game at the Save Point and talk to the man on
 the left if you need to buy items.  Climb up the stairs and you'll meet
 Barret, who is firing at the Shinra helicopter you saw back at the
 plant.  Reno will jump out, and you'll have to fight him.  Good thing
 Barret joins you.  When you inflict enough damage, the boss runs away!

 This guy packs a wallop.  He can imprison your friends using his golden
 Pyramid attack, and if he does this to all your members, you lose.  To
 break the pyramids, attack your allies (they won't be damaged).  Watch
 for his spark bolt attack (which can paralyze you) and use your Limit
 Breaks whenever possible.  Ice works well on him.  For some players,
 this may be the first battle they lose!  You'll get an Ether for scaring
 him off should you win.

 ITEMS IN THIS AREA:  Sense materia, Battery x3, Ether.

 After fending off the boss, Tseng will kidnap Aeris (and p**p slap her)!
 As he escapes, the entire city explodes and falls down a level,
 destroying it.  Cloud, Tifa, and Barret all come to in the playground at
 the Sector 6 Slums.  After Barret yells for Marlene, Wedge, and his other
 friends, he and Tifa join you in the next area when you try to leave.  Go
 back to get a sparkling yellow Materia (Sense), before returning to Wall
 Market.  The man in the pottery store will now sell you Materia, and if
 you go back to the parlor, you have the option of freeing one of Don
 Corneo's men from the torture chamber.  Even if you got the Member's Card
 the first time around, you can no longer enter the brothel, by the way.

 When you're done, leave and go south from the playground.  Return to the
 Sector 5 Slum and go to Aeris's house.  Talk to Elmyra, her mother.  You
 can spend the night in the upstairs bedroom once the intermission ends.
 Return to the Wall Market and go to the dead-end area near the parlor.
 (you'll see a bunch of kids run in there).  Climb up the pipe, and you'll
 find yourself high above the town.  If you haven't gotten them already,
 go to the 'Machine & Gun' store and talk to the man at the left end of
 the store; he'll sell you 3 Battery for 300 gil.  You'll need them
 to activate the boxes in this part of the game.  With that in mind,
 examine the box-shaped object in the lower right to try and start a
 nearby propeller.  Head up, and you'll jump onto the propeller.  From
 there, make your way to the other box and activate the painted barrier.
 Climb up it, and use the O button to jump onto the swinging metal pipe.
 Despite what Cloud says, jump when it is close to you (just as it stops
 squeaking).  After that, climb up to the next screen.

 Here, climb up, then drop down to activate the next box and you'll find
 an Ether.  Climb down the lefthand pipe and make your way back up again.
 Instead of dropping down, continue up, and you'll find yourself at
 Shinra's headquarters.

   @{b}3 . 9      s h i n - r a   h e a d q u a r t e r s@{ub}
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------

 ITEMS IN THIS AREA:  Elixir, Elemental materia, Star Pendant, Four Slots,
                      All materia, Phoenix Down, Ether, Poison materia,
                      Grenade x1~3, Talisman, Enemy Skill materia,
                      Potion x4, Mythril Armlet, Protect Vest, Guard
                      Source.

 There's a Save Point here.  You have the option of either heading to the
 left and climbing up a stairwell (sneaking in) or barging in through the
 front door ('kick some Shinra butt!', as Barret would say).

 Going up the stairs takes forever, but it's free of enemies and you can
 get an Elixir that's lying on one of the landings.  On the other hand,
 going through the front door and taking the elevators in the back is
 faster, but you have to fight several battles along the way.  Not only
 that, but you can chase around the Shinra staff before taking the
 elevator :)  (or at least, you could in the Japanese version.  They
 all ran away....)  You can't use the circular lifts by the doors yet, but
 you can use them once you reach the 60th floor.  If you go up the stairs,
 you'll see a door marked 'Accessories'.  Inside the room, you can look
 at a monitor to see a short FMV sequence about Shinra's producs (this
 is the most overlooked FMV in the game).  There are two chests here, but
 the lady won't let you open them.  She will sell you items, though.
 Remember, if you go through the front, check the control panel in the
 elevator (the one that goes haywire) after each enemy enounter in order
 to continue upwards.  If you go up the stairs then change your mind and
 go back down, you won't have to fight anybody on the elevators, and the
 main area of the ground floor will be empty (an easy trick for not
 having to fight anyone :)).

 No matter what method you use, you'll eventually reach the 59th floor.
 Head southeast and kill the armored guards to get the Keycard 60, then
 take the lift to the 60th floor.  Here, you'll have to head to the room
 in the upper-left and make it to the other side without being seen by
 the patrolling guards.  In order to stay hidden from them, pause behind
 the gold statues, then lead Tifa and Barret across using the O button.
 If you mess up, not only to you get attacked (ambush-style combat), but
 you'll have to start all over again.  Keep in mind that the set of
 guards on the right half of the screen move faster than the ones on the
 left.

 Take the stairway up to the 61st floor.  Talk to everyone here.  A man
 who asks you about Aeris will give you the Keycard 62 if you answer
 "......".  On floor 62, talk to the man in the room, Domino, and the man
 in white, (Hart) then check out the two library rooms.  Answer Domino's
 question and he'll give you the Keycard 65.  The problem with this is
 that the answer changes with each game you play.  It seems like it would
 be easy enough to simply try each answer until you get it right, but you
 get an Elemental Materia for free if you answer correctly the first time.
 So, it's in your best interest to just reset and keep trying in order to
 get the materia.  Hart will help you out if you need it, but he'll want
 you to pay him first.  To get the answer, simply look for the misplaced
 files, write down the first letter of the file name, and when you get
 all four, try to organize them into a word.  Then talk to Domino, and
 find which word matches the one you came up with (or at least hast the
 letters you found).  He gives you varying items depending on how many
 tries it takes you (you'll get lesser items if you mess up each time).

 The 63rd floor is tricky.  You have to collect 3 Coupons from all three
 rooms, but you're only able to open 3 doors at a time.  You can reset
 the doors by investigating the computer in the right-hand room, but that
 also resets the location of the Coupons.  You can move around using
 walkways in the ducts; to enter them you have to climb into the black,
 box-shaped structures (there's one in the computer room).  You can't do
 that unless you have at least one of the three items.

 To get the items, follow this procedure: activate the computer, then
 head to the top of the screen and open the gate farthest to the right.
 Head right and open the left-hand gate, then walk right and go south
 to enter the room where A Coupon is.  Choose the top option to climb
 into the black box and use the walkway to get to the room where B Coupon
 is.  Finally, go through the door in this room and open the door to the
 left, then go north to enter the room containing C Coupon.  Then use the
 walkway to return to the computer room.

 Now if you want, you can just trade one of the Coupons for an item,
 but if you have all three then you'll get all three items.  The trade
 setup works like this (choose 'Coupon Change'):

  - Trade Coupon A for the Star Pendant accessory
  - Trade Coupon B for the Four Slots bracelet
  - Trade Coupon C for the All materia

 To get your items (depending on how many coupons you have) go to the
 computer and choose the bottom option,  then the top.  Keep in mind
 that you can only do this once.

 On the 64th floor, you'll find a Save Point and bedroom to your left.
 You can use the machines in the exercise room, or waste 250 gil trying
 to get a health drink (which you can't actually get, BTW.)  If you
 examine the lockers in the back room, you can find a Phoenix Down,
 an Ether, and a M-phone (HP Shout), but you can only take the first
 two items for now.  Head to the 65th floor.

 Here, you have to open a treasure chest, then examine a broken section
 of the model in the circular room and choose the top option to repair
 it.  This unlocks one of the other chests, allowing you to open it and
 use the part inside to repair another section of the model.  When you
 have finished, you'll get the Keycard 66 from the final chest.  You
 must fix the model in a counter-clockwise fashion starting from the
 bottom.  The order of the chests you open goes like this:

  - Upper-left room:   bottom chest
  - Upper-left room:   top chest
  - Lower-left room:   left chest
  - Lower-left room:   top chest
  - Upper-right room:  chest
  - Middle-right room: get the Keycard 66 from here when you're done.

 On the 66th floor, you can either run into the meeting hall as quickly
 as you can (if you took the elevator...it's a glitch, and was possible
 in the Japanese version, at least :)), or you can enter the stall in the
 bathroom located in the northwest corner of the floor.  Choose the
 middle option, and you'll climb on top of the toilet and enter an air
 duct.  Move forward to see what the Shinra members (Reeve, Palmer,
 President Shinra, Heidegger, Hojo, and Scarlet) are discussing.

 Climb back out, then climb up the stairwell after Hojo (the pony-tailed
 scientist) in the room to the right of the meeting hall.  Note that
 you'll end up in the air duct even if you ran into the hall...heh, heh.
 On the next floor (67), talk to the people and keep following the
 scientist.  After looking in the purple chamber (and after Cloud gets
 another headache), move beyond the crates and to the right to find a
 Save Point and a treasure chest with a Poison Materia inside.

 Enter the elevator to the north, and then watch as the scientist toys
 with Aeris.  Now, choose who you want to protect Aeris, (either
 Barret or Tifa), and then you can name the lion-like creature (Red 13)
 that was attacking Hojo.  He'll fight alongside you when the mutant
 boss shows up.  Don't forget that Red 13 comes equipped with his own
 Materia!

 life power.  Avoid using physical attacks, Ice, or Poison.  This means
 that Red 13 is better off using Fire against the boss than attacking.
 This battle is easier if you have Barret, who can inflict more damage.
 Don't worry about getting poisoned since you can get infected again when
 the boss uses the pink gas attack on your characters (there's no point in
 trying to de-poison yourselves).  You'll get a Talisman should you kill
 the boss, and Grenades depending on the OPTs that you killed.
 _________________________________________________________________________

 Tifa or Barret return after the battle (depending on who you chose).
 You'll be asked to make a new party (but you can keep the old one you had
 before, if you wish).  When you're in control of Cloud again, be sure to
 grab the yellow materia (Enemy Skill) that's left behind in the sample
 chamber.  Then go up the ladder and head south.  Talk to the man in the
 gray coat to get the Keycard 68.  Go back down to floor 66 and try
 entering one of the lifts; you'll get caught by Rude (he's a Turk who
 you'll be running into constantly throughout the game).  He and Tseng
 will 'escort' you to a meeting with the president of Shinra.  Afterwards,
 you'll end up in the jail cells on floor 67.  Here, listen to everyone,
 then go to sleep.

 The next morning, you'll find that your door is unlocked.  Investigate
 the guard, then talk to Tifa.  Check the guard again to unlock the doors,
 then look in on Barret and Red 13.  After freeing your companions, return
 to the lab and talk to Red 13.  Talk to him again after taking the
 elevator up to the 68th floor, then use the incline to reach the walkway
 again.  Go all the way along it until you find two purple Potions, then
 climb back down and enter the door from the ground floor.  The green bars
 of light won't hurt you; run through them and pick up two more Potions
 before climbing up the stairs to the 69th floor.

 Go out the center door to reach a Save Point.  Then, run up either of
 the purple stairs.  Check out the dead Shinra president, capture Palmer,
 then go through the door to the north to exit the room.  Outside, talk
 to the man in white.  He's Rufus, son of the Shinra president.

 The other characters will return to the floor below, and you must lead
 them outside (you can also choose to unequip Aeris' and Cloud's materia
 in case you want to juggle them around for the upcoming battles).  Your
 team now consists of Red 13, Barret, and Aeris; don't forget to re-equip
 your Materia (it seems as if the top option removes it....)  Head to the
 lift (by taking the lower door).  When you activate it, you are attacked
 by a huge gun-wielding machine while going down the side of the Shinra
 building.

 You can only use long-range attacks, so use Barret's attacks and his
 Limit Break as well as magic to harm this foe.  Poison-based magic
 inflicts no damage, while Bolt does the most damage.  Red 13 is a
 sitting duck if he doesn't have any spell Materia equipped, so be sure
 to deck him out with some magic spells (he can still use his Limit
 Break).  When you inflict enough damage, the boss starts to break down.
 After the second collapse, he starts firing heat blasts that damage all
 members, so be careful.

 After killing the boss, you must fight a flying machine.

 As with the other boss, don't use Bio but do use Bolt.  You may be weak
 after the last battle, so make use of Potions, the Restore Materia, and
 Aeris' B1/1 Break (Healing Wind) to restore lost life.  You'll win a
 Mythril Armlet when the boss dies.

 The scene switches back to Cloud.  Heal yourself if necessary, equip
 Materia, then press Start.  Rufus will then attack you.  Feel free to
 adjust his equipment/Materia if need be before the battle.

 Kill the panther guardian first, then go after the boss.  Although you
 can't do anything about the panther casting Barrier on Rufus, you can
 use magic instead to inflict damage.  He can only hurt you with his
 shotgun, so don't worry about healing yourself after each round (just
 heal yourself when your life gets lower).  Sock him with your Limit
 Breaks and he'll escape onto the circling helicopter after you've
 damaged him enough.  Cloud will get a Protect Vest and a Guard Source
 when the battle ends.
 _________________________________________________________________________

 Leave the rooftop and head back to where Tifa is waiting for you.  As
 Aeris, try to approach the front doors.  After a short conversation,
 you and the gang will escape by motorcycle (and truck).  Your team is
 now made up of Cloud, Tifa, and Barret.

 An option screen appears where you have the following options:

 Eventually, you'll reach a dead end and fight the boss.  The amount of
 life you start off with during the battle depends on how much life you
 and your friends lost during the high-speed escape.  If a character lost
 all his life, he begins with only 1 point when the battle starts, but
 since the boss gets to make the first attack, they'll have to be revived
 using Phoenix Downs if there are any party members who survived.  The

 This boss gets a free attack from behind...sheesh.  Most of his attacks
 do little damage, but his Firethrower and flying fire sweep attacks
 can kill your party in a single blast (the fire sweep does around 220
 damage)!  The best way to beat this group is have your party consist of
 Aeris and Barret.  Give the All and Restore materia to either Cloud or
 Barret, and give the other character Lightning.  This way, you can heal
 with one character, attack with another, and then use Aeris' Limit Break
 to keep your life up at all times.  Ice works better than Fire against
 the boss (for those characters that don't have Lightning equipped).
 Remember, your rows are reversed when attacked from behind, so put Cloud
 and Barret in the back and Aeris in the front if you want them to line
 up properly when the boss shows up (assuming that's who you use...I found
 that they worked the best).  If you beat the boss, you'll get a Star
 Pendant.

 You'll find yourselves outside of the gate after beating the boss (you
 could also see this scene by going south from the church where you met
 Aeris the first time).  Decide who will be in your group, then head
 towards the screen to exit and arrive at the World Map (the outside
 world).

 Kalm Town isn't far from Midgar; you should be able to see it if you
 walk north a ways.  Go into the inn to see the rest of the gang waiting
 for you.  Cloud will talk to the others about Sephiroth via a series of
 semi-interactive flashbacks:

 - You'll start off in a truck being driven by Shinra soldiers.  After
   talking to the soldiers and Sephiroth (Cloud's former ally in the
   Shinra army and now a wanted criminal), the truck will be stopped
   by a dragon.  You'll have to fight it, but Sephiroth (who is Shotgun-
   powerful) can kill it in two hits.  In the flashback, Cloud's
   portrait is different; this 'Young Cloud' is of a low level, but
   Sephiroth is so strong that you need not worry about losing battles.
   However, you can't control Sephiroth's actions and you can't hurt
   him (because of your low level), either.  Although Young Cloud comes
   equipped with an Pre-emptive materia and Sephiroth has several
   mastered materia equipped, you can't take them for your own (although
   you can if you use a Game Shark code...see section 14).  Also, Young
   Cloud and Sephiroth can't use Limit Breaks (because they don't have
   any).

 - After the battle, you'll end up in Nivelheim, Cloud's hometown.
   Talk to Sephiroth and the guards if you wish, then head north.
   If you want to look around the town, feel free to, but nothing
   you do during this part of the game has an affect on the rest of
   your quest (although is does affect the character's questions
   and reactions to Cloud's story).  One thing you might want to do
   is go into Tifa's house (the large building on the 'southeastern'
   side of town).  You can read her stuff, play the piano (if you
   play the 'Highwind' theme, Cloud will act like he remembers it
   from somwhere), or even search her closet (hey, they changed
   'slightly-stretched underwear' to 'orthopedic underwear'.  What's
   the big deal? :))  Also note that you can't get Vincent Valentine
   during Cloud's flashback because you can't examine the safe :(

 - When you're done looking around town, go to the inn and head
   upstairs.  Talk to Sephiroth and choose to get some sleep.
   The next day, talk to Sephiroth and get your picture taken, then
   sit back and watch the FMV.  When you're in control of Cloud,
   head along the bridge and talk to Tifa, then talk to her again
   further along the bridge and it will break.  After you've
   recovered, head northeast into the cave, then keep heading north.
   Eventually, you'll arrive at the Jenova plant.  Enter it, head
   along the beams, then walk onto the wood platform and climb down
   the chains and go after Sephiroth.  Talk to him in the next area,
   examine the chamber to the left of Sephiroth, then talk to him
   twice, once to make him move out of the way and once to make Cloud
   look inside the chamber.  After Sephiroth goes ballistic, you'll
   return to Kalm Town.  Pick the top option to save your game, or
   the bottom option to continue.  Cloud's narrative starts off back
   at Nivelheim, where he enters the large mansion at the edge of
   town.

 - Inside, climb the two staircases and head to the right.  Enter the
   lower door and make your way into the next room; if you examine
   the circular part of the stone wall, a passage appears.  Enter it
   and climb down the spiraling walkway until you reach the bottom;
   keep walking from here to find a library.  Leave after Sephiroth
   finishes talking.  After Cloud wakes up, return to the library.
   Sephiroth gives a little speech then he exits the mansion; return
   to the town square.  Try entering the house to your right.

 - Back at the Jenova plant, return to the area with the chambers after
   witnessing the struggle between Tifa and Sephiroth.  Examine Tifa to
   carry her out of harm's way, then run up the stairs and enter the
   door that Sephiroth opened.  After the FMV sequence, Cloud's
   flashback ends and you are returned to Kalm Town.

 Note that you have to go to Kalm Town to proceed with the game; you
 can't make your way through the Mythril Mines beforehand, although you
 can visit the Chocobo Farm if you want to.  As for treasure, there's an
 Ether in the door beneath the stairs in the house near the inn, another
 Ether in the cabinet on the second floor of the house to the right of
 that house, and a Peacemaker in the chest on the second floor of the
 third house (take the curving stairs).  If you take the normal stairs in
 the same house, you can get a Guard Source in the cabinet by the little
 girl.  Finally, in the house on the other side of the town, there is an
 Ether in the door beneath the stairs on the north wall of the first
 floor.  Oh, you'll be given the PHS (Party Hensei System) when you talk
 to your allies on the first floor of the inn; it allows you to switch
 group members whenever you want, providing that you're in the World Map
 or standing on a Save Point (there are a few exceptions to this rule).

 Leave the town and head east to reach the Chocobo Farm.  Talk to the
 Chocobo at the front end of the pen and choose the top option to see
 the big yellow birds dance; you'll get the Choco/Mog materia afterwards.
 Then, talk to Choco Billy (the man with the hat) in the stables behind
 the pen.  Choose the first option, then the 4th option, then the top
 option again.  Providing you have 2000 gil to spare, he'll sell you a
 Chocobo Lure materia, which lets you attract chocobos to ride.

 To catch a chocobo, wander around outside on the chocobo tracks (in
 this area of the game, you can meet them on the light patches of
 grass, too), until you are attacked.  If a chocobo is one of your
 opponents, then kill off the other enemies and when the battle ends,
 you'll be riding the chocobo.  If you attack the chocobo, it will
 hurt you and the other enemies, then escape, so you'll have to try
 again.  Don't forget, you can only fight chocobos if you have the
 Chocobo Lure materia equipped.  When riding a chocobo, your can move
 around normally, and you won't get attacked by enemies.  You can press
 X to dismount, but if you do this, the Chocobo will run away and you'll
 have to catch another one.

 A little to the south and directly west of the Chocobo farm is a cave,
 but a creeping snake in the marsh before the cave entrance will rise up
 to attack you.  Instead of trying to kill it now, go get a Chocobo
 instead, who can outrun the snake and enter the cave.  Yes, you will
 still get attacked if the snake touches your chocobo.

 Note that you can run across the marsh on foot, but nothing special
 happens if you do so (and it's nigh-impossible to pull off without
 running into Midgar Zolom).

 _________________________________________________________________________
 @{b}BOSS TIPS: MIDGAR ZOLOM                         LV: 26  HP: 4000  MP: 348@{ub}

 This boss has two deadly attacks: one is a tail swipe that knocks a team
 member off-screen and puts them out of commission for the rest of the
 battle.  The other one is the Beta enemy skill, which inflicts around
 1000-1200 points of damage (which spells instant defeat if your allies
 are weak, although you should try to pick up this skill if you have a
 Teki no Waza equipped).  Along with his bite attack, this serpent can be
 a tough enemy if you try to fight him earlier in the game.  It's easier
 if you try to defeat him after you have Cid's airplane, since you can
 use Limit Breaks and powerful summon and magic spells to kill it.
 Unfortunately, you get a measly amount of EXP, AP, and gil for beating
 the boss and what's worse, he reappears when you return to the World
 Map, so you're right back where you started.
 _________________________________________________________________________

 Note that if Midgar Zolom knocks one of your allies off-screen, the
 game won't end should the other members be killed; instead, you'll find
 yourself standing at the edge of the marsh.

 The first time you get across the marsh, you'll see a large snake
 impaled on a tree.  Just exit the screen to continue playing.  Also, if
 you get off your chocobo while on the patch of grass before the mine
 entrance, he'll stay there in case you need to return to the farm (this
 doesn't seem to happen all the time--I don't know why).  If you're
 strong enough, you can get to the Mythril Mines without ever having to
 go to the Chocobo Farm.

 ITEMS IN THIS AREA:  Ether, Tent, Long Range materia, Mind Source x2,
                      Elixir, Power Wrist, Shiva materia, Grenade or
                      Potion x6 or Ether x6, Enemy Skill materia, 1/35

                      Stealer.

 Inside the Mythril Mine, head northeast to find a green Ether on the
 stone steps.  In the chest is a Tent, so be sure to grab it.  If you try
 climbing up the brown vine on the western rock face, you'll find a purple
 materia (Long Range).  Climb back down, return to the first area, then
 head left.  Make your way southeast to find a chest with a Mind Source
 inside, then head west to reach the next area.

 Here, you'll run into some of the Turks again: Rude, Elena, and Tseng.
 Once they leave, walk north.  There's a chest with a Elixir inside it
 and a Hi-Potion just to the north of the chest.  Return to the area
 where you met the Turks, climb up the vine, and go through the door to
 exit the mine and return to the World Map.  From now on, you can meet
 Yuffie in the forests and have her join you (refer to section 8.1 for
 details).

 Nearby is a rocky outcropping with a huge bird statue atop it, the Condor
 Fort.  Enter it and choose the second option when talking to the man out
 front.  After climbing up the rope, you'll find yourself in a town built
 into the rock itself.  There is a Save Point, item shop, bedroom (you can
 sleep for free), and Materia shop here.  Talk to everyone.  If you have
 enough Gil, you can hang around and fight the 'mini-battle' as many
 times as you want (it's fun!).  Otherwise, leave and go northwest through
 the forest to Junon Town by the shore.  For information on fighting the
 battles, refer to section 7.8 (Having Fun).


 <KM's note - Okay, folks, from here on out, it's all based on the
 Japanese version of my FAQ (mostly).  So enjoy, and I'll be back with
 more info and additions next time!>


 Once you arrive at Junon, talk to the villagers, then go down the stairs
 to the shore.  Here, a young girl named Purishira is playing with a
 dolphin.  Out of nowhere, a big flying boss shows up and attacks her,
 then your party.

 _________________________________________________________________________
 @{b}BOSS TIPS: BOTOMUSUWARU  (Bottom Swayer)        LV: 23  HP: 2500  MP: 100@{ub}

 There's not much to worry about; just attack with Lightning or Poison-based
 spells and keep your life up.  Since this guy's flying, some characters
 can't attack him (like Tifa), while some can (like Cloud).  Find out
 which guys should be casting magic and which should be attacking early on
 in the battle.  Sometimes, the boss puts an HP-reducing bubble around a
 character.  It only disappears if you cast a magic spell upon it (this
 won't hurt the 'bubbled' person).  If you have the Affect All materia,
 you can use this to cast a spell on the bubbled person and the boss at
 the same time.  Before dying, the boss will attack with a wave, (he
 can do this normally, but always does one before he disappears) so watch
 out and make sure your hp is high enough to withstand an attack.  If you
 want, you can equip characters (like Barret) with weaker, long-ranged
 weapons so that they can attack the boss, but it may not be worth it.
 You'll receive a Power Wrist when the battle is over.
 _________________________________________________________________________

 After killing the boss, you'll have to revive Purishira.  To do this,
 watch the lung-shaped meter that appears in the upper right.  Press
 the S button once to make the meter start to raise.  Just as it reaches
 the top, press S again to make Cloud breathe into the girl's mouth.
 It will take a couple of tries.  Afterwards, go to the house near the
 entrance to town and talk to the person there (for some reason, choosing
 the top option won't make Cloud go to bed, but if you go back in the
 house and try again, he will go to sleep).

 During the night, Cloud will have another bad dream.  In the morning,
 leave and go to the house above the stairs (your friends will be
 gathered near it).  Purishira will give you the 'Summon Shiva' materia,
 a gift for saving her life.  Follow her to the shore, then talk to her
 a second time.  Barret will show up and the girl will keep talking;
 when you have the chance, choose the middle option.  Your goal in this
 part of the game is to leap atop the iron beam above the electrical
 tower so that you can sneak into the heart of Junon Town.  Your
 controls are:

 X        Swim faster
 S        Makes the dolphin flip you into the air

 If you get to close to the electric blasts traveling along the tower,
 you'll get shocked and will have to try again (just pick the second
 option).  The easiest way to get up there is to simply not move and
 press S.  The dolphin will miss and deposit you near the bottom of
 the screen.  However, you'll be perfectly positioned, so if you press
 X again, Cloud will land on the beam.  Once you're on it, head to the
 left to get a good view of the flying airship 'Highwind'.  Make your
 way south (towards the 'front' of the screen) to continue.

 The next area has a higher and lower level.  If you investigate the box-
 like switch, you'll be taken to the lower level.  From there, head south
 to find a building.  There is a projecting roof nearby which has a door
 underneath it; just press against the edge and you'll enter a hallway
 filled with soldiers.  In the halls, go up to find a locker room.  Check
 out the half-open locker and choose the second option to dress up as a
 guard.  When the captain of the guards asks you another question, pick
 the bottom answer.

 Then, leave the locker and take note of the Save Point before heading
 through the door (follow the other soldiers).  Now that you're outside,
 go into the first alleyway.  You'll come across a group of marching
 soldiers.  The head guard will want you to join in and march with them
 perfectly, so it may take a couple of attempts before this event will
 end.  You also have to move your gun in time with the soldiers by
 pressing and releasing the O button.  Depending on how high or low the
 counter was during this scene (the one in the lower right-hand corner),
 you will get the following:

    PERCENT      NAME        TYPE
    21%       =  Grenade    Item
    37% - 39% =  Potion x6   Item
    45% (?)   =  Ether x6    Item
    (I'll figure out the rest later....)

 Afterwards, you'll have to stand at attention while Rufus and Heidegger
 talk to each other...press in any direction and the captain of the guard
 will tell you to get back in line.  After the rest of the soldiers leave,
 the captain will give you an option; choose either option and you'll
 return to the locker room for some training on the next event.  There,
 you can try to follow the captain's orders, if you wish.  When he asks
 you a question, choose the top choice to try training again, or the
 bottom option to finish the training.  Once the soldiers leave, follow
 them outside.

 Now's your chance to do a little shopping and treasure hunting.  You'll
 run into Rude in the basement of the first weapon shop, but he won't
 recognize you in your Shinra guard uniform.  Go through the third door
 and talk to the guard near the back of the room, then jump down to an
 area with several Shinra guards and some holograms.  In the far corner
 of the room is a yellow materia (Enemy Skill).  This place
 (I believe) is similar to the 'House of Learning' back in Area 7 Town
 where you could learn about the game's mechanics.   On the second floor
 of the same building, you can get a 1/35 soldier and a Mind Source.  In
 the room with the cats nearby is a Luck Source.  On the third floor is a
 red Power Source and a green Guard Source.

 If you enter the fourth door on the other side of town, you'll find that
 that Elena, Rudo, and Tseng of the Turks are here.  It's a good thing
 that you're in that uniform :)  Go through the sixth door to find a room
 with a soldier; you can check the silver trashcan for a message and pick
 up a yellow Speed Source in the side room.  On the floor above, you can
 pick up another 1/35 soldier.

 In the next area, Heidegger and Rufus show up again.  You have to do
 your salute according to what the captain of the guard tells you to do
 (remember your training)!  At the very end, all you have to do is be
 facing forward: pressing any button will make you do the 'spinning gun'
 salute.  Unfortunately, the order of commands is random each time you
 play, so just do your best.  Afterwards, you can press the following
 buttons to make Cloud do funny things:

 S       Scratch back with gun
 X       Put one leg forward
 T       Shrug
 Pad     Stand at attention

 Depending on how well you did during the salute, Heidekkaa will give you
 an item.  Each 'button press' action was worth 10 points, and the final
 salute was worth 30 points.  Changing direction was worth 0 points, but
 unless you were facing in the correct direction, any action you performed
 was worth 0 points.  Also, performing an action was worth 0 points if you
 did it too late (although you'll get full points if you do the action
 early).  Your total score determines what you will receive (notice that
 Rufus' reactions change depending on what item you will be given):

    SCORE        NAME                     TYPE
    000 - 050 =  Silver Glasses           Accessory
    060 - 090 =  HP Plus                  Independent Materia
    100 - 190 =  Force Stealer            Weapon (for Cloud)
       200    =  (I'll figure out this one later....)

 After everyone else leaves, Red 13 (who was watching from just inside the
 boat) will talk to you if you try to leave instead of boarding the boat.
 Either way, you'll end up joining your friends in the boat's hull.

 ITEMS IN THIS AREA:  Ether, Affect All materia, Wind Slash, White Cape.

 Open the treasure chest to get an Ether, and be sure to pick up the blue
 materia (All).  Talk to the people here, then go up on the deck and
 talk to everyone else; you'll notice that they are your companions
 (don't miss Red 13 :)).  The man in white will sell you items if you talk
 to him.  Once you're done, go back down and talk to Aeris, then return
 to the deck and go all the way to the left; one of the guards has left,
 allowing you to sneak to the front of the ship.

 Here, talk to Barret, who is spying on the Shinra members.  After talking
 to him a couple of times, an alarm will sound.  Go back to the center of
 the boat to find your friends.  Then, assemble your party.  If you want
 to change the setup, talk to your friends again.  When you're ready, go
 downstairs and head through the door that the one guard was standing in
 front of.  In the next room, watch out for enemies and climb up the
 ladder, the walkway leads to a chest with a Wind Slash inside.  Did you
 get all the items on the boat?  When you're ready, go and talk to the
 captain of the guards.  It turns out that he's dead.  Then, Sephiroth
 shows up, and summons a huge monster for you to fight before he flies
 away.

 @{b}BOSS TIPS: JENOBA*BIRTH  (Jenova*Birth)         LV: 25  HP: 4000  MP: 110@{ub}

 Earth, Fire, and Cold magic work well against it, but don't use Poison.
 Attack with your Summon Materia and hit it with everything you've got.
 Keeping your HP Plus is a priority, since it can use lasers to attack one
 or all members.  Only use physical attacks if you are running low on MP.
 The boss can cast 'Stop' on a single ally so make sure that you're not
 too dependent on any one character during the battle.  Some Phoenix
 Tails will also come in handy, since the boss sometimes uses a laser
 that hits all allies (Terror Laser) twice in a row (which can inflict
 loads of damage).  You'll get a White Cape when the battle is over.

 ITEMS IN THIS AREA:  'Summon Ifrit' materia, Power Source x2, Motor Drive,
                      Fire Ring, Double Machinegun, Turbo Ether,
                      Transform materia, Wizard Staff, Star Pendant,
                      Soft x2, Phoenix Down x10, Mind Source, Tent.

 Grab the red Materia (Summon Ifrit) after the battle and wait for the
 boat to dock.  Talk to the people here and then go up the stairs.  A
 short automatic sequence follows.  In the next area, go into the door
 to meet a shady guy who will sell you this room for 30,000 gil; you can
 sleep here for free anytime you want afterwards.  Climb down the stairs
 in the bottom part of the room to reach a basement with a sleeping man.
 You can get a Power Source and a Motor Drive here, as well as a Fire Ring
 from the treasure chest.  You'll meet Mukki (from the cabaret in the
 Wall Market) in the bar, as well as some of his friends.  If you go down
 to the beach, you'll run into Hojo (the scientist you met in the
 Shinra HQ).  You can talk to him if you want, but you won't get anything
 out of it.

 Outside of the town, head through the mountains and across the bridge.
 You'll find a cave-like entrance.  Talk to the man on the hill, then
 keep heading north.  Eventually, you'll reach a walkway that leads to
 a large Makoro furnace.  Head south and follow the train tracks; there's
 no point in looking around here.  Keep going, and you'll come across
 some curving tracks and a Save Point.  As you walk along the tracks, you
 can get the following items:  Double Machinegun, Turbo Ether, and a
 Transform materia.

 These tracks are rickety, and when you walk across them in certain areas
 a message will appear telling you to press O so that you don't fall
 through them.  It's better to let yourself fall, because you can then
 hold left or right and rapidly press O to land beneath the tracks.  Then,
 press Up to climb back up.  If you landed on the left side of the tracks,
 you can pick up a Wizard Staff.  If you landed in the middle, you can't
 get anything, but if you landed on the right side, you'll find a Star
 Pendant.  There are three places where you can fall through the tracks,
 so be sure to get these items.

 Take the upper rail path to the next area.  Are your friends waiting for
 you on the lower track?  If they're not, then go back and take the lower
 path.  You'll get an option to summon them using the PHS system (NSS).
 Assuming they're there, take the upper path and keep walking until you
 find a wooden shed.  Enter it and pick the top choice when you're
 prompted to make a decision.  This will lower the tracks on the bottom
 path.  Before returning to the lower rail path and following after your
 allies, you can walk to the end of the path you're on and climb the wall;
 you'll hear birds chirping if you're in the right place.

 After finding the nest, you can choose to take the treasure in the nest
 (the top option), or leave the birds alone (the bottom option).  If you
 choose the top option, you're attacked.

 @{b}TIPS: KOKATORISU  (Cocatrice)                      LV: 17  HP: 420  MP: 0@{ub}

 This guy's easy; just attack until it dies.  You'll get 10 Phoenix Downs
 should you kill it.  You can get two Softs from it; one by
 stealing, the other by killing it with Morph.
 _________________________________________________________________________

 You'll get 10 Phoenix Downs after the battle is over.  Cloud will then
 return to the train tracks.  Keep in mind that this is a one-shot deal;
 whether you decide to take the treasure or not, you can only make a choice
 one time.  As you're traveling along the lower rail path, you'll see a
 part where the track splits in two directions.  Take the left path (the
 one that turns back).  Walk north (towards the bridge), then right (under
 the first bridge).  It may sound confusing, but you'll end up in a little
 shack where there's a bunch of items and a man resting on a bulldozer.
 There's a Mind Source and a Power Source here, and the chest has a Tent
 inside of it.  Leave and follow the other path across the bridge in the
 next area to reach the town of North Corel.

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
   @{b}3 . 1 5    g o l d   s a u c e r@{ub}
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------

 ITEMS IN THIS AREA:  Silver Armlet, 'Summon Ramuh' materia.

 There's some merchants here at North Corel and an inn.  You can also
 learn more about Barret here, whether he's in your party or not.  When
 you're done shopping and chatting, go to the sky lift.  After Barret has
 a flashback about his friend Dain, take the lift up to the Gold Saucer.
 You can return to the World Map by heading right from the bottom area of
 the town, but there's nothing to do out there (aside from saving your
 game or riding around on a Chocobo).

 You'll see a Save Point in the background of the first area of the Gold
 Saucer, but you'll need GP (not gil, like what you've been using) to
 activate it.  Pay the man to get in (the first choice is for a one-time
 entrance, the second choice will let you enter as often as you'd like),
 and then choose the path of your choice after your companions separate.

 If you try to leave the Station Square (the area where you're at; all
 the areas in the Saucer are divided into 'squares'), Aeris will join
 you.  As you explore the rest of the Gold Saucer, you'll discover that
 Shinra soldiers are snooping around, looking for Sephiroth.  When
 you're ready to move on, go to the Wonder Square.  Here, you'll meet
 Cait Sith, a would-be fortuneteller.  He'll automatically join you since
 you only have two members (you and your friend) at this point.

 Go to the Battle Square and you'll find a bunch of dead bodies; the
 handiwork of Sephiroth.  As you're talking to the few who are still
 alive, Dio, the proprietor of the Gold Saucer shows up and promptly
 blames you for the carnage.  Cait Sith makes a dash for freedom, but
 after following him, the party is trapped.  Dio and his henchmen then
 summon three large robots that throw you and your allies through the
 'Gateway to Heaven' to a desolate area, the Corel Prison, which lies
 at the base of the Gold Saucer.

 Here, you'll find Barret.  After he runs away, examine the dead body
 and talk to the other guy before going though the southern gate.  There
 is a treasure chest here (in the chamber at the base of the ladder), but
 it's already opened (anyone know if there's supposed to be something in
 it that you could have gotten earlier?)

 In the second area, talk to everyone here.  The building to the far
 southeast is a bar, and a man inside will sell you items.  After looking
 around here, enter the building to the east (it doesn't matter which
 entrance you take).  Barret will show up once you're inside, as will
 Tifa and Aeris.  After Barret's flashback (in which his best friend
 falls down a gorge and North Corel is razed to the ground), reassemble
 your team and go back to the first area.  Examine the guard (who is
 dead), then either leave through the gate.  If you exit by going through
 the area between the gate and the building to the right, you'll end up
 wandering around in a wasteland until a caravan (the same one that Tifa
 was captured in) shows up.  When it does, pick the top option to get a
 ride back to the area beyond the gate or choose the bottom option to
 stay where you are (in the middle of nowhere...you'll have to keep
 wandering around until the caravan shows up again).

 Anyway, once you've gone past the gate, talk to the man out here and go
 to the _right_.  Any other direction leaves you stranded in the desert
 (read the above paragraph again if you want to get back on track).  This
 takes you to the caryard.  Go up from here and you'll run into none
 other than Dain (the guy from Barret's flashback).  He tells Barret
 about Erenoa and Marlene (who is actually his daughter), then (for what
 reason, I have no idea), decides to attack Barret.  In the battle,
 you're forced to fight using just Barret.

 _________________________________________________________________________
 @{b}BOSS TIPS: DAIN                                  LV: 23  HP: 1200  MP: 20@{ub}

 The easiest way to kill this boss is simply let him hit you; his attacks
 increase your Limit meter quickly.  Use the Kaifuku Materia to restore
 lost life, then hit him with the Heavy Shot when your meter maxes out.
 A summoning Materia (like Shiva or Ifrit) is also a good way to inflict
 added damage.  Just make sure you have all the MPs you need, and you can
 win in no time.  The boss can pull off a final attack before dying, so
 keep your life up (but he can't do it if you kill him fast enough).  You
 get a Silver Armlet for beating him.
 _________________________________________________________________________

 After Barret's friend dies, you'll find yourself back in the trailer.
 After talking to Kooshi (Coach?), you'll be invited to become a Chocobo
 racer.  In the elevator shaft, choose the top option to have the racing
 process explained to you (NSS), or pick the bottom one to skip it.  In
 the room with the other men, check the alcove by the Chocobo poster for
 a red Summon Materia (Ramuh).  Then, talk to the girl in pink (Esuto) to
 start racing.

 Your controls as a Chocobo racer are:

 S               Speed Plus Source
 X               Speed Plus Down
 O               Dash  (uses up your Dash Meter)
 Select          Switch between Automatic and Manual control
 R1+R2           Hold these buttons to refill your Dash Meter.

 The more you Dash, the slower your walking Speed Plus is, so conserve your
 Dash Meter for when you really need it.  You have to keep racing until
 you win, so get good fast!  Esuto will explain the controls to you again
 prior to the race if you choose the top option, or you can conclude your
 conversation with her and start racing by choosing the bottom option.
 If you can't get the hang of it, then just keep racing using the
 Automatic Sequence mode until you get first place.

 After winning, you'll receive the Bagii (Buggy) as first prize, and can
 now roam freely about the overworld and even pass through shallow rivers!
 (Look for lighter-shaded fords along the rivers.)  Your controls are set
 up in the following manner:

 X               Exit buggy
 O               Enter buggy
 T               Main Menu
 Select/Start    World Map  (press repeatedly to enlarge/hide map)
 L1/R1           Rotate view  (or return to side view if in overhead view)
 L2/R2           Change view

 You _can_ run into enemies in the buggy, so be careful.  Also, you can
 only return to the Golden Saucer if you take the sky lift from North
 Corel Town; you can't get there using the buggy.  If you go across the
 river south from the Golden Saucer and look around, you'll find a house
 on a peninsula; you can't explore it yet, so ignore it for now.  BTW,
 you can return to the desert if you get in the buggy, enter the dirt pit
 surrounding the Saucer, and touch the houses at the base of the Saucer.
 However, you'll find that there's nothing to do here but wander through
 the desert--do so long enough and the same cart that Tifa was abducted
 in will pull up and offer you a ride back to your vehicle.  Choose the
 top option to accept and the bottom option to stay where you are.  And
 as the help menu indicates, it's possible to return to Junon Town and
 take the Buggy with you.  After you've completed the scenario with Cid,
 you can explore the house on the penninsula; you can also get Aeris's
 Level 4 Limit Break manual at that point in the game (see section 14
 for details).

   @{b}3 . 1 6    g o n g a g a   t o w n  /  c o s m o   c a n y o n@{ub}
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------

 ITEMS IN THIS AREA:  Fairy Tale, X Potion x2, 'Summon Titan' materia,
                      Deathblow materia, Added Effect materia,
                      Ether, Black M-phone, X Potion, Fairy Ring, Ether
                      Turbo, Wizer Staff, Demi materia (and you can get an
                      Elixir, Magic Source, and the Full Cure materia here
                      from Disc 2 onwards).

 Your next goal should be to head south from the Golden Saucer across the
 river to a forested area.  Go into the black structure (it's called
 Jungle, for some reason).  Reno and Rude are here.  After Elena shows
 up and alerts the other Turks to your prescence, you'll be asked a
 question.  No matter what your answer is, you'll have to fight
 Reno and Rude at the same time.

 _________________________________________________________________________
 @{b}BOSS TIPS: RENO                                  LV: 22  HP: 2000 MP: 80

 Use Summoning spells to even the odds at the start of the round, then go
 after either one.  Once you injure one enough times, he'll leave, then
 the other one will.  It may be better to attack Rude, since he can heal
 himself and Reno, but then again, Reno can inflict more damage.  In any
 case, this fight isn't too hard either way.  You'll get a Fairy Tale and
 a X Potion should you win the battle.
 _________________________________________________________________________

 After the Turks leave, head northeast, then go north to reach a pile of
 scrapped machinery.  As you're looking around, Sukaretto and Tseng show
 up in the Shinra helicopter and talk about 'Huge Materia' (which you'll
 learn more about in Disc 2).  After they leave, examine the area where
 Sukaretto was standing and choose the bottom option to get the 'Summon
 Titan' materia.  Then go back to the first area and head left.  In the
 second area, there is a Deathblow materia near the left path (which
 returns you to the World Map).  If you take the north path, you'll
 arrive at Gongaga Town.

 Be sure to visit the stores (don't forget that you can climb up the pole
 in the Accessory Shop to reach a room where you can buy weapons) and
 get the treasure chests from the inn (X Potion) and the old man's
 house (White M-phone).  If you go into the far right house, you'll meet
 an old couple who apparently know Cloud (or someone just like him), and
 someone else named Zekkusu.  When you're done here, return to the World
 Map.  Head southwest, then turn toward the river and go over the
 shallows, and then make your way up through the mountains to reach Cosmo
 Canyon.  If you try to drive past the town, the buggy will short out,
 so you don't really have any choice but to enter the town (and you can't
 get anywhere else without the buggy, so even if you didn't drive it past
 Cosmo Canyon and entered on foot, it wouldn't matter....)

 When you approach the man at the gate, Red 13 will talk to him (he'll
 either bound up the steps past your party if he's not with you, or he'll
 just leave your party and start talking if he was with you previously).
 Everyone here knows Red 13 by the name 'Nanaki'.  After Red heads up the
 stairs, talk to the guard and choose the bottom option to be let into the
 town (Red 13 will reappear to make sure you guys get in).  If he was in
 your party, you'll have the option to make a new team; otherwise, you can
 look around town freely.  Don't miss the Save Point located in the
 Tigerlily Arms Shop.  In the Item Shop, there is a passage with a red
 rope across it that prevents you from checking out the room in the back.
 Keep this place in mind because if you return to Cosmo Canyon in Disc 2
 or 3, the rope will have been removed and you can get an Elixir, a Magic
 Up, and the Full Cure materia orb from the back room.

 Eventually head up to the observatory, where you'll run into Red 13
 and Buugen Haagen, an old geezer who knows all kinds of things.  After
 Red 13 leaves, go back down and talk to your friends in order to make
 a new party.  Then talk to Red 13 in the room connected to the inn
 before returning to the observatory.  Enter the side door, chat with
 Buugen Haagen, and you'll see a short FMV sequence.

 When it's over, return to the large bonfire to the right of the
 entrance.  Your friends are here.  Talk to everyone here, then chat
 with Red 13 a second time.  Buugen Haagen will show up, and you'll
 make a new group (with Red 13 as a permanent member).  If you want
 someone else, just talk to another ally (it doesn't matter which one).
 Follow Buugen Haagen back to the sealed door above the weapons shop
 and talk to him, then choose the top option.  He'll open the door for
 you.  Enter and climb down to the very bottom of the shaft, then head
 left.

 In the next area, head right and up until you see a hole facing left*.
 Enter it and you'll be given an option.  Pick the top one to make an
 opening appear nearby.  Go through it, then head up and left.  You'll
 slide on the oil and hit a spiked wall, reducing every member's HP by
 500 points.  Then go south, through the hole, and head right to reach
 the Combination materia you couldn't get in the first area (Additional
 Effect).  Go back and carefully _walk_ along the edge of the path to
 avoid slipping across the oil.  Then go right, up, left, down the
 stairs, and through the underpassage to reach a chest with an Eeteru
 inside of it.  Then return to the stairs and go left, then down to
 find a second chest containing a Black M-phone.  Then climb back up
 the stairs and head to the upper-left to leave this area.

 *  If you enter any of the other three holes, you'll be given the
    same option, but if you choose the top choice, you'll be attacked.
    Doing this doesn't seem to alter the level in any way, but you're
    better off doing this after you've cleared the _whole_ area out
    instead of doing it right now; I'd rather be safe than sorry, in
    my opinion.

 There are five passages in this area; you only want to take the 2nd and
 4th passages from the left.  First, take the 4th passage.  When you
 touch the web beyond it, you'll have to fight a giant spider (Stinger).
 When you've killed it, follow the path north to find a chest with an
 X Potion inside.  Then go back and take the 2nd passage from the left.
 Kill the Stinger that attacks you when you touch the web and then head
 left and down.  As you're going through the tunnel, hold right and
 you'll find an alternate path that leads to yet another treasure chest.
 You'll find a Fairy Ring in it.  Go back up to where the web was and
 walk north to find another web.  Past it is the exit, but try holding
 left and Cloud will go along a passage hidden by the rock that leads to
 a chest.  There's an Turbo Ether inside.

 When you approach the giant face in the next cavern, it begins to move
 and you are attacked.

 @{b}BOSS TIPS: GI*NATATAKU                          LV: 29  HP: 5500  MP: 200@{ub}

 Don't worry about the Soul Fires this boss has with him; just use your
 Summon Materia, then concentrate on attacking and using Limit Breaks on
 the big guy himself.  If your spell Materia has hit second level, then
 Cold and Lightning work nicely on him.  You don't even need to worry
 about your life much; the boss can be taken down before any serious
 damage is done to your party.  You'll get a Wizer Staff should
 you be successful in battle.
 _________________________________________________________________________

 Grab the spell Materia (Demi) that's left behind and follow Buugen
 Haagen up the steps.  After the sequence with Red 13 and the other
 creature (his father, who was transformed into metal or something?),
 make a new party and leave the town.  Don't worry, Red 13 will rejoin
 you when you try to leave.  Oh yes, the Buggy will be working again
 when you leave Cosmo Canyon.

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------

 ITEMS IN THIS AREA:  Luck Source x2, Elixir x2, Platinum Fist, Turbo Ether
                      Silver M-phone, Twin Viper, Enemy Launcher, Magic
                      Source, Destruct materia, Rune Blade, Platinum
                      Barrette, Powersoul, All Materia, Elemental Materia,
                      Sniper CR, Jem Ring, Counter materia (if you open up
                      the safe in the mansion, you can get the Cosmo Memory
                      manual and the 'Summon Odin' materia, not to mention
                      a Key Item (the gold key).

 Get in the buggy and continue past Cosmo Canyon.  Head north to find a
 river with a shallow ford you can cross.  Past it, the mountains are
 of a different type than what you usually see.  Near them is a small
 town, Nivelheim.  Look familiar?  It's the same one Sephiroth and Cloud
 went to in Cloud's flashback.

 First, go into the inn.  Talk to the black creature in the back to get
 a Luck Source.  You can get an Elixir from another one of the creatures
 in the Item Shop, and a second Luck Source if you talk to the small
 creatures in the upper floor of the southeastern house.  The large house
 to the east is Tifa's home, and you'll be given a Platinum Fist and an
 Turbo Ether if you talk to the creatures here.  There's a piano in
 Tifa's room that you can fool around with (see section 14 for details).

 This next section is optional--you can just continue on through the
 mountains if you want.  However, Sephiroth won't show up in the
 mansion after you reach Disc 2, meaning you can't nab the Destruct
 materia unless you get it from him during the first disc (read below
 for details).

 Now, go into the large mansion at the edge of town.  Left of the
 entrance is a piece of paper written by the Turks (?).  It has
 several hints on it that clue you in to the combination of the safe on
 the upper floor (but it's useless if you don't know Japanese :)).
 You can get the 4th number by chosing the blank space beneath the
 first three tips (look at the paper, choose the top option, then move
 the cursor down to the blank space and press O).

 Head right and look for the sliver of light near the stairway, it's
 very hard to see.  It's an opening that leads to the lower section of
 another room.  There's a chest here, with a Silver M-phone inside.
 Go back out and go into the northern door beneath the staircase.  In
 the adjoining hall, head right and and up to find a chest with a
 Twin Viper in it.  To the left is a room with a broken piano (which
 you could have also reached by looking for the opening near the left
 staircase in the main room).

 Go up the stairs and head left.  In the circular room is a chest that
 has an Enemy Launcher inside.  There's nothing in the northern room
 except for a locked safe--you'll need the right combination in order
 to open it (see section 14 if you don't know how).  If you want to
 try your luck, examine it with the O button and choose the top option
 to enter the combination or the bottom option to quit.

 Open the safe (or not), then go right and into the right wing of the
 manor house.  If you go up, you'll find a chest with a Magic Source
 inside.  Then go into the lower room and examine the curved wall to
 open a secret passage.  Go down the spiralling walkway, and then head
 right.  If you got the gold key from the safe, you can open the
 northern door (refer to section 14 for details).  Continue to the
 right to find a libarary.  Then go north and you'll run into none
 other than Sephiroth, who will pelt you with a green materia before
 flying away.  Be sure to get the materia (Destruct) before
 leaving the mansion.

 Once you're back outside, leave Nivelheim from the northern entrace
 and contine along until you see a passage leading into the mountains.
 In the next area, follow the path until it splits, and take the north
 path, which wraps around the back of a spire and leads to a chest
 with a Rune Blade inside of it.  Now go back and follow the original
 path.  You'll notice that just before the bridge, there's a path that
 curves away to the north.  Follow it up into the mountains and when
 it curves south, take that path instead of continuing in the same
 direction.  The path curves several times, but eventually you'll make
 it to the top of the mountain, where you can find a chest with a
 Plus Barrette.  It may help if you press SELECT so that you can see
 yourself when a mountain is blocking your view, and if you can't seem
 to get any further, press in other directions (like down) to scale the
 back of the mountain.

 Go back down to the main path and head up the bridge.  Inside the
 cavern, take the ladder down instead of the tubes, or you won't be
 able to get all the treasure in this area.  You don't have to worry
 about the large boss near the door just yet.  Feel free to make use
 of the Save Point, then climb back to the top of the area.  Enter the
 pipe labled '2' to end up on a rocky ledge.  There's an item bag here
 with an Powersoul inside; get it and then press down to jump down
 to a lower ledge, then press down again to reach the floor.  Climb back
 up one last time and go into the pipe labled '4' in order to reach the
 treasure chest on the bottom ledge below; there's an All materia
 lying within.  Walk against the right edge of the ledge to drop down
 to the floor.

 See the path heading south, just below the path that the boss is
 blocking?  Follow it to go outside, then try to keep walking and you'll
 drop down to the lower ledge.  Following the path here leads to a dead
 end, so enter the cave instead and take the righthand path once you're
 inside.  Ignore the exit at the other end of the cave and work your way
 southwest, then go through the small hole.  Walk up, then left, then
 down in order to reach the treasure chest you could see when you first
 came in here.  Inside it is an Elixir.  Now go through the exit to
 arrive at a wooded area.  On the ground, to the left of the mass of
 crystalized Materia is an Elemental materia.  Take it and proceed north,
 going through the opening to go back into the caves.

 Inside, head to the right, then go up as far as you can and walk left
 past the stone walls to reach a chest containing a Sniper CR.  Then
 go back and take the rightmost passage.  It goes south and leads you
 back to the outside.  From here, head left (going right leads you to
 a dead end).  You'll eventually end up at the Jenova Plant you visited
 in Cloud's flashback.  There's nothing to do inside the plant, so
 continue beyond it to the door set in the rock wall.  Enter it and
 you'll end up back in the chamber with the pipes again.

 It's true that you could have taken the door and done this entire
 sequence in reverse, but then you couldn't have scaled the ledge and
 you would have to go all the way back, instead of taking the express
 route like you just did :)  Now climb down and examine the boss, and
 it will attack you.

 @{b}BOSS TIPS: MATERIAKIIPAA  <Materia Keeper>      LV: 38  HP: 8400  MP: 300@{ub}

 Don't use Honou-related attacks; it'll only heal him.  Red 13's Limit
 Break B1/1 works well, as does Cloud's B2/1 Limit Break.  I'd also
 suggest using the 'Choco/Mog' materia as much as you can--it's
 ability to stun this boss is very useful.  Physical attacks should do the
 trick if you have good weapons; save your MPs for healing yourselves.
 Kealra and All Materia are a good combination (remember to link
 them when selecting holders) if you want to stay alive, since the boss
 can inflict 300-800 points of damage with its stabbing/mauling attacks.
 Also, he can heal himself (around 1000 hp's worth), and use the damaging
 Tryne skill, which causes about 500 points of damage to all those still
 alive.  If Red's learned his B1/2 break or someone knows Haste, it would
 be a wise idea to use it at the start of the round.  Since the Materia
 Keeper is one of the few enemies that can use Tryne, it comes highly
 recommended that you have a Enemy Skill materia equipped so
 that you can learn this enemy technqiue.  You'll get a Jem Ring should
 you be victorious.
 _________________________________________________________________________

 After the battle is over, examine the purple materia that is left behind
 in order to take it (Counter Attack).  Then follow the path outside--it
 leads back to the World Map.

 ITEMS IN THIS AREA:  Power Source, Yoshiyuki, Drill Arm, Edincoat.

 Head southwest, then turn north (you're making a big C around the
 mountains).  Keep walking and you'll see Rocket Town up ahead.  In
 the Accessory Shop, you'll recieve a message if you go to the left end
 of the counter and examine it (anyone know what it means?)  If you go
 into the house farthest to the right, you can find a chest with a
 Power Source inside of it in next to the stove.  Then talk to the old man
 standing near the house that's just left of the rocket's launch pad.
 Talk to him again, and he'll ask you a question.  Pick the top answer
 and the view will pan up to show the rocket.  Then the old geezer will
 give you the Yoshiyuki; it's a weapon for Cloud.

 Go into the house to the right of the old man.  This is the home of
 Shiera and Cid, although neither of them are around at the moment.
 There's a chest here with a Drill Arm inside it.  If you go out the
 back entrance, you'll find a light airplane in the backyard--it's one
 of Cid's inventions, the 'Tiny Bronco'.  After looking at the airplane,
 Shiera will show up.  When she leaves, go outside and head north to
 arrive at the rocket--climb inside it to find Cid.  After chatting with
 him, name him.  You can then ask him several questions; you have to at
 least ask the first one (top choice) in order to proceed with the game.
 Then leave the rocket and return to Cid's house.  Shiera will show up,
 then Cid, too.  After Cid goes out back, Shiera will explain how Cid
 was going to pilot his rocket into outer space some time ago, but
 aborted the launch when he discovered that Shiera was still making last-
 minute checks and hadn't left the launch pad yet; she would be burned
 to ashes since the launch could only be aborted, not delayed.  By saving
 her life, Cid's dreams were shattered, since he did not have the
 resources to repair the rocket, which tipped over after falling back
 onto the lauch pad.

 Cid comes back into the house, then Palmer shows up--an employee of
 Shinra.  Go outside and you'll run into Rufus and a Shinra guard, who
 have come to 'borrow' the Tiny Bronco.  After Shiera brings you back
 inside the house, go out the back entrance to find Palmer standing
 atop the Tiny Bronco.  Talk to him and he'll attack you.


 _________________________________________________________________________
 @{b}BOSS TIPS: Palmer  <Palmer>                    LV: 38  HP: 6000  MP: 240@{ub}

 His gun causes a fair amount of damage since it has the effects of Fire 2,
 Ice 2, and Bolt 2, so make sure Aeris is in your party or that you
 have some Restore Materia.  Use Haste and All on your party as
 well as Slow magic and/or Summon Chocobo on him to even the odds a bit.
 You'll want to have Cloud's B2/2 by now--it comes in handy.  Your prize
 for beating Palmer is an Edincoat.
 _________________________________________________________________________

 After the boss gets wasted (heh, heh), your party and Cid will escape
 on the Tiny Bronco.  Although it gets damaged during your escape it
 can still be used to skim across shallow water and traverse rivers
 (although you can't go up or down waterfalls).  Here are the airplane
 controls:

 X               Exit airplane
 O               Enter airplane
 Select/Start    World Map  (press repeatedly to enlarge/hide map)
 L1/R1           Rotate view  (or return to side view if in overhead view)
 L2/R2           Change view


 You now have several options that are available to you: you can get
 Aeris's Level 4 Limit Break manual (see @{"section 14" link 95} for details) or
 go on Yuffie's sub-quest (if you have her in your party, see @{"section 6" link 64}
 for further information).  Even if you don't have Yuffie, you can
 purchase some pretty good weapons and find some treasure chests
 lying around in Wutai, so you may want to stop there anyways.  You
 can even go back and kill the big snake you had to flee from in
 section 3k, if you've been itching to do so (you'll now have enough
 HPs to learn the enemy skill 'Beta' from it without dying). In any
 case, it would be a good idea to explore other areas and pick up items
 you missed/buy stuff you couldn't afford before instead of continuing
 on your quest just yet.  I would suggest checking out the excavators'
 site to the north, since you can pick up the powerful 'Summon Kjata'
 materia there as well as buy some useful bracelets and items (see
 section 3u for details).

 ITEMS IN THIS AREA:  Protect Vest, Choco Feather, Elixir.

 Pilot the Tiny Bronco back to the Gold Saucer area.  Go to the
 weaponsmith's house on the penninsula near the dirt pit and talk to
 him--he'll explain that you need the Kiiston (Keystone), which he no
 longer has.  Get back in Cid's airplane, and leave it on the shore by
 the dirt pit.  You need to get to the Golden Saucer, so either walk or
 find a wild Chocobo and ride it back to North Corel.  Then take the
 sky lift up to the Gold Saucer.  Go to the Battle Square and look for
 an opening on the right side of the room labled 'Dio's Show Room'.
 Inside, examine the glittering object on top of the large stand; it's
 the Kiiston.  Dio, the big lug who threw you out of the Gold Saucer
 before, will show up and offer you a challenge: fight in the Battle
 Square and he'll give you the Kiiston.  When you have a choice, pick
 the top option to accept or the bottom option to temporarily decline.
 You'll now have to fight in the Battle Square using only Cloud.  Keep
 in mind that even if you lose the very first battle, Dio will still
 give you the Kiiston.

 If you want to try and see if you can win all the battles, then keep
 fighting.  After each battle, the message 'GREAT!' will appear,
 followed by two options.  Choose the right option to stop fighting,
 or the left option to continue fighting.  If you choose to continue,
 a jackpot-like device will appear.  You can stop it from spinning
 by pressing the O button, and whatever comes up when you press O will
 take affect prior to the start of the next battle.  Depening on what
 you get, different things will happen to you, although certain
 accessories can render you immune to some of the more debiliating
 effects.

 Furthermore, the status ailments that you are afflicted with as a
 result of the jackpot stay with you from battle to battle, and you're
 forced to stop the jackpot after each battle, so you could end up
 being a poisoned, petrified frog in a few rounds, if you're not
 careful.  If you last through seven battles, then the fighting ends.

 Refer to the 'Having Fun' section for a complete explanation of how the
 Battle Square works, but keep in mind that although you will earn
 Battle Points during the battle, they are reset to zero when the battle
 ends since you end up in the Show Room (and the way things work you lose
 all the Battle Points you earn if you leave the main room at any time).
 Should you make it through all the battles, Dio will give you a Boudan
 Chokki and a Choco Feather, in addition to the Kiiston.

 There's nothing else you need to do at the Gold Saucer now, but when
 you try to leave, you'll discover that the ropeway that the sky lift
 travels up and down is broken, leaving you stranded in the Saucer.
 Cait Sith will either show up (or leave your party, if he's already
 with you guys) and suggest that you all meet him at the Ghost Hotel.
 At the Hotel, you and your allies will chat for awhile.  In the next
 scence, you'll find yourself in your room.

 At this point in the game, a character will come into your room and ask
 to go on a date with you.  While it's usually Aeris, it's been
 confirmed that you can go on a date with Tifa instead, if you were nice
 to her and mean to Aeris throughout the course of the game.  It's much
 harder to do, but if you have had Yuffie in your party for a while, she
 may wish to date Cloud as well.  If you're really mean to all the women
 in your party, Barret will date you (so be nice!)  It's not what you
 think--just a friendly outing (he had a wife, so what are you thinking
 ^_^;)  I'll write down the exact method to date each character when I
 learn what they are.

 Both times that I've played through this part, it's always been Aeris
 who comes to ask Cloud to go on a date, so I'll write the next section
 with her in mind, although you may end up with someone else.

 First, you'll go to the Event Square.  Since you're the 100th person
 to come here that day, you and Aeris will be offered a role in the
 upcoming play.  What you do here doesn't affect the game in any way,
 so just pick whatever options you'd like and watch one of the many
 humorous endings.  If I wrote it out, it would ruin the fun, so....
 Next, you'll ride the gondola in the Round Square.  When Aeris looks
 out the window, you can press left to look out, too, and see various
 FMV sequences showcasing the events at the Gold Saucer.

 After the date is over, Cloud and Aeris will return to the Station
 Square only to find Cait Sith sneaking around with the Kiiston.  He'll
 run away when Cloud yells at him, and you have to chase him around
 various sections of the Gold Saucer.  (If you don't want to waste time
 doing that, then go to the Chocobo Square, enter it, and chase Cait
 Sith back outside).  Eventually, Cait will stop at the steps outside
 of the Chocobo Square.  The Shinra helicopter shows up, and Cait will
 toss the Kiiston up to Tseng.  When confronted by Cloud and Aeris, Cait
 reveals that he is in fact a spy for the Shinra.  He insists that he
 continues to travel with Cloud and his friends because he has taken
 Marlene as a hostage back in Midgar (Right?  That's what he seems to say).

 Once Cait Sith leaves, you'll find yourself back in the Ghost Hotel.
 Check the iron maiden for an Elixir (notice the sound it makes; it
 sounds just like Norstein Bekkler's laugh [the guy from Chrono
 Trigger!]).  Leave the room to meet up with your allies again.  After
 a brief talk, Aeris will join your party, becoming a permanent member.
 Pick another ally and then leave the Saucer, since the ropeway is now
 repaired.

 Now that you're back at North Corel, leave and return where you parked
 the Tiny Bronco.  Look at the World Map.  See the tiny chain of islands
 near the bottom of the map?  Just to the right of them and to the left
 of Mideel and the Fort Condor is a large island.  If you go there, you'll
 see a large temple surrounded by a forest.  This is your next
 destination, so land the Tiny Bronco at the shore and head to the temple.

 ITEMS IN THIS AREA:  Trident, Mind Source, Silver Rifle, Turbo Ether x2,
                      Rocket Punch, Luck Plus materia, Morph materia,
                      Princess Guard, Ribbon, Hou xx, Mega Elixir, Nail
                      Bat, Dragon Armlet, 'Summon Bahamut' materia,
                      Gigas Armlet.

 At the top of the temple is a black creature, similar to the ones you
 met in Nivelheim.  If you talk to it, it floats into the air in a flash
 of light.  Inside the temple, you'll find the Turk, Tseng.  He was badly
 wounded by Sephiroth.  He gives you the Kiiston so that you can go after
 his attacker; examine the dais in the center of the room and you'll be
 transported into the depths of the temple.

 This area has a very confusing layout; it's a mass of stairs, walkways
 and passages.  There are chests everywhere, and a kooky old man in a
 blue robe is also running around down here.  From where you arrived,
 head up, then left, then up again and go down the stairs to the ground
 level.  There's an opening just above you; go in it, turn to the right,
 then climb down the vines clinging to the wall beneath you.  If you
 run underneath the long staircase nearby, you can reach a treasure chest
 that has a Trident inside of it.  From there, head right, go down the
 stairs, then turn and climb up the wall using the vines.  Head past the
 opening (which you can't enter at this point, anyway) and go up the
 stairs.  The old man will dash away; ignore him for now and climb up the
 vines to reach a platform.  There's a shiny pink item here (Mind Source).
 Take it and go down the stairs, then enter the door to your left to find
 a room with a treasure chest and the old man.  Inside the chest is the
 Silver Rifle.  Talk to the geezer twice and he'll offer his services
 to you:

  - Purchase Items
  - Restore HP and MP to maximum
  - Save your game*
  - Nothing

 *  Choose the top option to decline or the bottom option to accept and
    save your game.

 Outside, go back up the stairs and down the vines, but this time, head
 down and to the left.  You can pick up a green item here (Turbo Ether).
 Then go down the long stairway.  At the bottom, climb down the smaller
 set of steps to your left, then work your way towards the southwest
 corner of the screen.  Ther's a small patch of vines here that you can
 climb down.  Be sure to open the nearby chest; there's a Rocket Punch
 inside of it.  Now, go down the stairs and walk northeast along the
 path to find some more vines and the old man, who scampers away when
 you get too close.  Climb up the vines, then go up the stairs next to
 you, go through the archway, turn east and go down the stairs, and
 climb up the long stretch of vines on the nearby wall.  Head left,
 underneath the staircase, and you can nab a purple materia (Luck Plus).

 Now, go back the way you came (go right, down the vines, up the stairs
 and down and out through the archway so that you're back on the path
 that the old man was standing on, just above the vines).  Walk to the
 east until the path stops, then head south and turn east again to enter
 the nearby door.  As you enter, the old man will dash away.  There are
 huge hollow boulders that are rolling down this walkway.  To get past
 them, time your dashes so that the hollow part will be directly over
 you, causing Cloud to kneel as the boulder rolls over you.  Then keep
 going until you reach a side path that leads to a pool of water.  Grab
 the Morph materia near the pool, then continue along the
 walkway, avoiding the boulders.  Once you reach the end of the path,
 they'll disappear for good, but remember that if you get hit by a
 boulder, you'll be dragged all the way back to the beginning of the
 path (ouch!)  Alternately, you can wait until the boulders disppear and
 then go back and pick up the materia after the sequnce with Sephiroth.

 Once the boulders are gone, Aeris will sense a powerful prescence in
 the chamber and return to the pool.  Light will erupt from the surface
 of the pool, and you'll be able to see what I presume is a flashback of
 Tseng and Elena (both Turks) running around in the shrine.  After Elena
 leaves, Sephiroth shows up and creates a double of himself.  While he
 busies himself with attacking Tseng, the laughing double flies up into
 the air.  After this sequence is over, Sephiroth's double will descend
 into the pool and then fly away (is this supposed to mean anything?)
 When you return to the end of the passage, the old geezer will be
 waiting for you, and will once again offer his help:

  - Restore HP and MP to maximum
  - Save your game
  - Nothing

 When you're ready, go down the stairs.  There's a huge room here with
 twelve doors labeled I to XII.  In the center of the room is the ever-
 annoying talking clock.  I was ready to use my FF7 discs as frisbees
 by the time I figured out how to solve this little 'mini-game'.  Here's
 how it works:

 If you press O (Roulette), the hour and minute hands move around very
 quickly.  Even when you press O again to stop the hands, they'll both
 move three more spaces in the direction they were traveling.

 If you press T, you're given two options: one in blue, one in green:

         BLUE:  This gives you four _more_ options, one in blue, one
                in green, one in red, and one in white.

                 - BLUE   The hour hand moves ahead by one space.
                 - GREEN  The hour hand moves ahead seven spaces.
                 - RED    The hour hand moves ahead by 17 spaces.
                          This invariably sets the minute hand ahead
                          by at least one space.
                 - WHITE  This does nothing.

        GREEN:   This gives you _another_ four options, in blue,
                 green, red, and white, respectively.

                 - BLUE   The hour hand moves back by two spaces.
                 - GREEN  The hour hand moves back by ten spaces,
                          setting the minute hand back by one.
                 - RED    The hour hand moves back by 20 spaces.
                          This makes the minute hand decrease
                          by at least one space, too.
                 - WHITE  This does nothing.

 If you press X, the damn clock shuts up and you're free to move onto
 the hands of the clock (providing you've aligned them properly).  You
 can only walk on the hour and minute hands of the clock.

 Isn't this fun?  Well, there are twelve passages (labeled I to XII),
 and you get to explore them by setting the clock to various positions.
 Here's a list of what's in each passage:

         I       -  When you open up the chest, you'll be attacked by
                    monsters.  You won't get anything for beating them,
                    either.

        POIZUNFUROGGU  <Poison Frog>              LV: 26  HP: 500  MP: 100@{ub}

 The Poison Frogs are weak against Reiki, so use cold-based attacks/spells
 on them.  Their attacks will turn you into a frog, but they attack so
 often that it's better for you to wait until they hit you again (turning
 you back into a human) instead of wasting a Maiden's Kiss or other
 restorative item.  The woman (Jeminisumii) is weak against Poison, so
 use one of the Bio spells on her for good results.  The only point in
 fighting this battle is if you want to learn Song of the Frog from the
 frogs (providing you have a Enemy Skill materia equipped).
 _________________________________________________________________________

         II      -  This passage is blocked off by rocks.  You can't
                    do anything here, so return and pick another path.

         III     -  A treasure chest.  It contains monsters, too.
                    You won't get anything for defeating them.

        HEKUTOAIZU  <Hecto-Eyes>                  LV: 30  HP: 500  MP: 220@{ub}

 Both of these red, multi-eyed monsters are weak against Poison, so use
 the best Bio spell you've got, or simply attack to dispatch them.  If
 you've got Morph equipped, you can morph both of them into
 Magic Source items, which is really the only point in fighting this battle.
 Although weak, either enemy can drain _lots_ of HP from you (around 1200-
 1400 points!)
 _________________________________________________________________________

         IIII    -  Shouldn't this be IV?  Anyway, there's a chest
                    here, and Aeris's Ultimate Weapon, the
                    Princess Guard is inside.

         V       -  This passage leads outside to the gold chest you
                    could see but not normally reach.  Inside it is
                    a Ribbon.

         VI      -  Read below to find out what to do here.

         VII     -  There's a chest here.  A weapon for Cait Sith,
                    the Hou xx, is inside it.

         VIII    -  You can get a Mega Elixir from the chest in
                    this room.

         IX      -  A passage blocked by fallen rock.

         X       -  This is where you came in, bud!

         XI      -  Yet another blocked passage.

         XII     -  What a creepy room!  You'll be seeing more of
                    it soon enough.

 At some point, you should stand on the hour or minute hand and let the
 second hand approach.  When it passes over you, it will knock you down
 into the pit below.  When you land, you'll find yourself in a room with
 a treasure chest.  Before you can open it, you'll be ambushed by two
 monsters.

                                                 (weak against Demi)

 Using Demi or some Summon Materia will kill these dragons quickly.
 Even physical attacks work well.  Either enemy can only attack for about
 500 points of damage, or use a Sazankurosu (Southern Cross) attack that
 hit's one enemy for the same amount of damage, so they don't pose too
 serious a threat.  You can also control them, even though they're bosses.
 You'll win an Turbo Ether for defeating both of them.
 _________________________________________________________________________

 In the chest is the Nail Bat, the strongest weapon Cloud can get during
 Disc 1.  Take it and leave the room.  You'll find yourself back at the
 door you couldn't enter earlier (in the area with the vines and
 staircases.  Simply work your way back to the talking clock, and pick
 up any items you might have missed the first time around.

 PASSAGE VI
 Before going down this passage, make sure you've cleared out the other
 rooms since you won't be able to go back to them after the next event.
 When you step out into the open, the bouncing old man will see you and
 run away.  When Aeris asks you a question, pick the bottom answer if
 you want to return and explore more of the clock puzzle room (NSS), or
 choose the top answer if you want to hunt down the old man.  To find
 him, simply go through the passages; you want to end up going into a
 passage that he plans to come out of.  You can go down to another set
 of passages by going to the left end of each ledge and pressing the O
 button to jump down a level.  The passage entrances and exits are
 random, but you can catch him without too much difficulty.  Don't forget
 to take the chest lying on the lowest level; there's a pair of Army
 Cotton Gloves inside.  As usual, beat the old man at his own game and
 he'll help you in return:

  - Restore HP and MP to maximum
  - Save your game
  - Nothing

 Now that you've caught the old man, the large door on the top level will
 open.  Go inside and head to the right.  You'll encoutner Sephiroth four
 times.  Up to his usual evil, Sephiroth talks about the energy within
 the temple as he as swings his sword around, his every motion trailed by
 the double that he made earlier.  After disappearing, Cloud will suffer
 from some sort of fit (something about the Materia taking over his body?)
 After coming to his senses, the party examines a mural on the wall which
 shows a meteorite speeding towards the people of the earth.  Aeris talks
 about the spell 'Meteo' which Sephiroth is planning to cast, when the
 party hears Sephiroth's voice.  The temple starts to shake, and a large
 red dragon appears and attacks the allies.

 _________________________________________________________________________
 @{b}BOSS TIPS: REDDODORAGON  <Red Dragon>           LV: 39  HP: 6800  MP: 300@{ub}

 Slow the dragon and Haste yourself to gain the upper hand.  Some Summon
 Materia will also even the odds, but don't use Kjata since it will heal
 the boss by about 2100 points.  Also, Demi won't work against it.
 Limit Breaks and physical attacks should do the trick.  You'll win a
 Dragon Armlet should you win the battle.
 _________________________________________________________________________

 Pick up the summon materia that's left behind (Bahamut).  Then go back
 and examine the floating gold object on the dais.  Aeris refers to it
 as the 'Kuro Materia' (Black Materia) but it's _gold_...in any case,
 Aeris will then ask you a question.  It doesn't matter which answer
 you choose.  At this point, if Cait Sith isn't in your party, you'll
 here a ringing sound and Cloud will answer the PHS phone.  Cait will
 talk to him through the phone.  If he is in you party, then he starts
 hopping around and talking to you.  When he finishes, leave this
 chamber, let the old man heal you if you need it, then go back to the
 clock room.  The only direction you can go in is straight up through
 passage XII.  When you examine the door in the room beyond, yet another
 boss appears to finish you off.

 _________________________________________________________________________
 @{b}BOSS TIPS:  DEMONZUGEITO  <Demon's Gate>       LV: 45  HP: 10000  MP: 400@{ub}

 The bad news is that the boss can hit for lots of damage.  The good news
 is that most of his attacks (especially the earthquake and body slam
 attack) quickly max out your Limit bars.  Now's a good time to try out
 the Bahamut materia, but most other Summon materia don't do much damage.
 Make good use of Aeris's B1/1 and Cloud's B2/2, and you'll want to
 Barrier and Haste yourselves.  Luckily, this boss can't instantly kill
 you as a similar boss in FF2 could.  You'll win a Gigas Armlet from
 this boss if you're victorious.
 _________________________________________________________________________

 Once the boss is defeated, Cait Sith will have an animated conversation
 with your party.  If he's not in your group, then he bursts out of the
 door and starts talking.  He'll then return to the chamber where the
 Black Materia was and take it.  Afterwards, the entire temple vanishes!
 In the following scene, Cloud and Aeris go down into the foundation
 of the temple and retrieve the Black Materia, but Sephiroth shows up
 and forces Cloud to give the Materia to him.  During this time, you
 control a ghostly image of Cloud as a child.  If you stand in Cloud's
 path and keep talking to him, you'll prevent him from approaching
 Sephiroth, but there's no point in doing this since Cloud will continue
 to advance until you give up.  After Cloud gives Sephiroth the Black
 Materia, he will attack Aeris (and you can't do anything about that,
 either).  Cait Sith will show up (actually Cait Sith 2--the same person,
 but with a new robot body since the first one got trashed when the
 temple was destroyed.  He sure got there fast, huh?)  Then your other
 party member will leap down and prevent Cloud from killing Aeris.

 After what I take to be a dream sequence, you'll awake in, of all
 places, the inn at Gongaga Town, with Barret and Tifa by your side.
 Answer Barret's question any way you like, then go outside.  Tifa and
 Barret will join your party, but you don't have to keep them as
 permanent members.  Look for the Tiny Bronco on the southern shore near
 Gongaga Town.

 Also, Aeris has left your party for good.  However, you'll have all of
 her weapons, equipment, accessories and materia in your item menu.  Now,
 you need to go to the forest that you saw in Cloud's dream.  First, get
 in the Tiny Bronco.

 ITEMS IN THIS AREA:  'Summon Kjata' materia, Water Ring.

 Make your way up to the Northern Continent by going around the left side
 of the Western Continent after going along the river by the Gold Saucer.

 Head to the right edge of the continent, where you'll find a forest
 surrounded by mountains.  In the middle of the forest is a big rib cage
 and a large skull.  Approach it, and you'll find yourself in a excavation
 site where a bunch of archaeologists spend their time digging.  Before
 doing anything else, you might want to head up the ladder and go through
 the hole in the back to reach a forest, the same one from Cloud's dream.
 Keep walking until you reach the second forest screen.  If you stand here
 for a moment, you'll see a red Materia floating on the left side of the
 screen.  It will switch to the right side and back again every few
 seconds.  Try to predict where it will show up and use the O button to
 grab it.  Your reward is the Summon Kjata materia.  If you try to
 continue through the forest, you'll find that this screen repeats
 endlessly.  So, go back outside.  Before going on to the next part of
 the game, you may want to buy some bracelets and items; talk to the
 man sitting near the rib cage and pick the second option in order to
 buy things from him.

 What you need to do at this point in the game is comission one of the
 men to dig up the Runahaapu (Luna Harp) for you.  As long as you have
 it in your possession, you're able to pass through the 'endless'
 forest.

  - First, talk to the man sitting just outside of the rib-cage room.
    Pick the first option twice*.  The screen will fade out.

  - When the screen fades back in, all the men will be gone.  What you
    do is choose a place where you want a digger to stand and press the
    S button.  It costs 100 gil to place a digger.  Use the top option
    to place a digger, or the bottom option to quit.  You can place up
    to five diggers.

  - You'll quit once you choose the bottom option or after you've placed
    five diggers.  Now, press the S button to set off an explosion.
    You'll hear a music cue, and the diggers will turn in different
    directions.

  - Stand where you want one of the diggers to search through the night
    and press S again after clearing the dialogue box.  You'll find
    yourself back at the bottom of the screen the next morning.  The
    treasure chest nearby will be closed, and it may or may not hold an
    item, depending on where you chose to dig.

  - The key to getting the right item is to watch the diggers after the
    explosion occurs.  They'll all look toward the location of the item
    you need, so try placing them in compass-point style layout so that
    you can follow their vision to the place where the item lies.  If
    you're really stuck, the Runahaapo lies just a little ways to the
    west and ever so slightly south of the tent on the upper ledge.

 *  Normally, the first option is used to dig for the Runahaapu (all
    the diggers will look in the direction of the harp).  The other
    two options are used to dig up other items (the diggers will look
    in the direction of the closest item/next item to be found).  But
    not only do you not have to place diggers in order to find an item,
    but you can use any of the three choice to dig up the Runahaapu or
    any other item--it's just that the diggers won't look in the correct
    direction if you don't use the first option, and you can't use the
    first option after obtaining the Runahaapu.

 How do you know if you got the right item?  Well, it will show up on the
 Key Item menu (where the important stuff like the PHS is kept).  Also, if
 you talk to the digger sitting by the room, and choose the first option
 twice, he won't let you select and place diggers.  Finally, try going
 into the forest.  If the screen turns green, then you've got the right
 item.

 When you've got Runahaapu, go into the forest.  When you reach the second
 area, the screen changes to a green color, and the forest will no longer
 repeat.  Beyond the forest is a rocky area.  First, go under the tree
 trunk to reach the treasure chest with a Water Ring inside.  Climb up the
 rocks near the pink mass of coral, then go through the fallen trunk and
 head north to reach the next area (you can't climb up the vine in the
 first area, so ignore it).  Walk along the curving path and you'll find
 yourself back in the World Map, in the canyon near the forest.  Head
 straight forward to the top-like object to continue your quest.

 ITEMS IN THIS AREA:  Magic Source, Aurora Armlet, Comet materia, Guard
                      Up, Elixir, Enemy Skill materia, Wizard
                      Brace.

 This area looks a lot like the floor of the sea; there's shells and coral
 everywhere.  At the crossroads, take the left path.  It leads to a stone
 building--inisde of the building is a Save Point, and there's a chest on
 the upper ledge with a Magic Source inside it.  Leave the building and
 continue past it, following the path east into the rock face.  Inside,
 go down the stairs and head all the way right to find a chest with an
 Aurora Armlet in it.  You can check out the blue crystal if you want,
 but there's nothing you can do with it at this point in the game.  Return
 to the crossroads and take the middle path.  Enter the shell building and
 climb the spiraling walkway to the very to to find a green materia lying
 on the ground (Comet).  Go back to the crossroads yet again and take
 the right road.  It leads to an area with several shell buildings.  Go
 all the way to the right, then go north to enter the building before you.
 Climb all the way to the top level.  There's a chest here containing a
 Guard Source.

 There's nothing else to do in this area but enter the last shell house;
 your friends won't let you take the path leading out of the city, and
 the main path leads to another part of the chamber with the blue crystal,
 but there's nothing you can do there.  So, if you're ready to proceed,
 enter the shell house to the right of the main path.  On the ground
 floor is a chest holding an Elixir.  Take it and climb up the ladder.
 When you approach the beds, you'll be given an option.  You can choose
 the bottom option, grab the yellow materia behind the headboard of the
 third bed (Enemy Skill), exit the house, then enter it again,
 approach the beds, and choose the top option to go to sleep.  Or, you can
 just pick the top option the first time around, go to sleep, and when you
 wake up in the night, grab the materia (it's easier to see at night, too).
 Originally, I though this was a 'bug' materia (don't I feel silly now),
 but it's not.

 No matter what you decide to do, go to sleep when you're ready to.
 You'll wake up in the middle of the night.  After Cloud's companions join
 him, return to the crossroads a final time and take the middle path again.
 When you enter the shell building, the fish floating in the middle of the
 spiraling passageway will have disappeared; there are blue steps in it's
 place.  Go down them and you'll find yourself in an underwater palace.
 At the bottom of the stairs, leave the building and take note of the Save
 Point before going down both sets of stairs below.

 Aeris's here, and you have to get to her by jumping across several
 pillars.  Press in the direction of the next pillar to get proceed,
 but you'll have to use just Cloud; your allies will wait for you back
 on the ground.  Once you get close to Aeris, Cloud has another spastic
 fit and will draw his sword.  You can press the controller and the
 buttons to make Cloud do different things, but pressing O three times
 will make him try to strike Aeris.  Luckily, he'll come to his senses
 beforehand with some help from his friends, but Sephiroth makes an
 appearance and attacks Aeris.  After her death, Sephiroth escapes,
 leaving behind another monster in his wake.

 @{b}BOSS TIPS: JENOBA*LIFE  <Jenova*Life>          LV: 50  HP: 10000  MP: 300@{ub}

 This boss is weak against earth attacks, so use Earth and Titan.  Also,
 Comet, Bahamut, and Kjata all work very well.  Physical attacks do a
 surprising amount of damage.  The boss will cast Reflect on itself the
 first time you cast a spell on it, so be wary about using spells too
 often.  Jenova*Life's attacks are not that strong (about 400-700 points),
 but it has an ultra-deadly blue bubble attack (Aqua Breath) that inflicts
 +1500 damage to each character.  Be sure to have some Restore Materia
 handy.  Considering it's the last boss on this disc, this is not a very
 hard battle.  You'll get a Wizard Bracelet when you win the battle.
 _________________________________________________________________________

 After beating the boss, there's another FMV sequence, then you're given
 the option to save your game.  Guess what?  You just finished Disc One!
 My times (if you're interested, and even if you're not :)) were 29:04
 initially, and 25:20 for the rewrite.

 ITEMS IN THIS AREA:  Viper Halberd, Bolt Armlet, HypnoCrown,
                      Mega Elixir, Magic Plus materia, Power Source.

 You'll start off outside of one of the shell-shaped buildings on the east
 side of the Ancient City.  If you walk to the left, Cloud will have
 another attack and you'll see the ghostly form of Sephiroth leaving the
 Ancient City.  Once Cloud has recovered, follow Sephiroth by heading
 north, then east along the path you couldn't take before.  Note that
 you're free to go back through the Forest and return to the World Map,
 but there's no point in doing so unless you wanted to buy some items or
 find Vincent or Yuffie (unless you already have them).  Although you're
 now on Disc 2, none of the other events that occur in this disc will
 actually happen until you get the Highwind in section 4e (meaning that if
 you were to return to the World Map, you couldn't go on the Huge materia
 quests yet, dig up the Gate 5 Key, or bring Buugen Haagen back to the
 Ancient City).

 In the next area, ignore the white, spiked object for a moment.  Instead,
 walk behind it (look for a path to your left).  This will allow you to
 reach a chest containing a Viper Halberd (a weapon for Cid).  Once
 you've gotten it, climb up the spiky object.  It's a little tricky to
 navigate due to it's spiraling shape, but you'll eventually reach a
 cave entrace after making your way to the top.

 Inside, walk to the left and press against the second cleft in the wall.
 You'll climb to the top and be given two options (Right or Left).  Pick
 the bottom option (Left).  Walk over to the next cleft and climb up it,
 then choose the bottom option when you reach the top to land on a litte
 ledge with a chest above it.  You can open the chest from where you are;
 there's a Bolt Armlet inside.  Face the cleft and choose the bottom
 choice, then the top one to jump to the other side.  Now, go to the right
 and when two options appear, pick the bottom one.  This lets you climb
 down to where the first chest is; there's a HypnoCrown inside of it.
 Climb back up to the top of the cleft, pick the bottom option, then press
 against it to try and get back on.  When two optoins appear, choose the
 top one.  Then, make your way up to the ledge with the chest, and pick
 the top option.  You can now take the Mega Elixir from inside the chest.
 Get back into the cleft and choose the bottom option to jump to the west
 side of the path.  Work your way to the left, climb up the cleft, and
 head left a second time to reach a long ladder.  Selecting the bottom
 option will left you climb down to the bottom of the ladder.

 If you search using the O button, you'll find a purple materia (Magic Plus)
 near the lower-left corner of the screen.  When you approach the ladder,
 you'll automatically climb up to the ledge you were at.  Now pick the top
 option after nearing the ladder and climb all the way to the top.  Once
 you're off the ladder, run to the right and go through the opening on the
 north wall.  In the next room, take the contents of the treasure chest
 (Power Source) before exiting through the far opening to the northwest.

 Once outside, keep to the east.  After heading along the coastline
 for a while, you'll come across a sharp curve that turns to the west.
 Just beyond it is a village and a deep valley, which you can't enter
 without exploring the village (Icicle Lodge) first.

 ITEMS IN THIS AREA:  X Potion, Hero Drink, Vaccine, Turbo Ether.

 Go to the far end of town and talk to the man in purple standing near
 the trees.  Pick the top option.  Two Shinra members will show up, along
 with Elena (a Turk).  After confronting Cloud, she will try to knock him
 out.  To avoid her strike, press left just after you see the transparent
 message box.  If she does hit you, you'll wake up in one of the houses,
 but if she doesn't, then she'll roll right out of the town.  It doesn't
 make a difference whether you get hit or not.

 After that's done with, go to town entrance and check out the house
 that's just to your right.  In the back room, there's a boy, a cat,
 and a snowboard.  Talk to the boy and the cat will leave the room,
 enabling you to take the snowboard by examining it.  You'll need it for
 the upcoming event.  Now, go to the inn, head to the upper floor, and
 examine the window in the lower left-hand corner to get an X Potion.
 Leave and enter the house on the far right (near the snowman).  Take
 the items in the back room (an Hero Drink and a Vaccine), then
 examine the map on the wall in the main room.  You can examine it by
 choosing the top option, but before you leave, you'll want to choose
 the bottom option to take it.

 Finally, go into the house on the left side of town, just to the right
 of the weapons shop.  If Elena KO'd you, this is where you'll wake
 up :)  If you go down the stairs and look by the windowsill, you can
 get another item (Turbo Ether).   You can also take a look at the
 machinery on the ground floor to see a series of pre-recorded videos
 dating back many years ago; they show Aeris's mother (Ifaruna, a Setora
 just like Aeris) and her father, a 'renegade' Shinra scientist named
 Gasuto (Gast).  There are several videos, but watching them has no
 effect on the game itself, aside from cluing you in to Aeris's past
 (providing you can read it :))  There's a device to the left that will
 allow more light into the room, but it doesn't seem to have any purpose
 (NSS).

 Before you leave the town, you may want to buy weapons, Hi-Potions
 and Tents at the shop.  When you're ready to go, simply walk past the
 man in the back of town (the one near the trees), and the snowboard
 sequence will start up:

 Your controls while using the snowboard are:

 S               Brake
 X               Jump
 Pad             Move left or right, down to brake
 Start           Pause/unpause
 L1/R1           Quick turn to the left or right when used
                 with control pad

 Basically, you want to make your way through the mountains.  You can
 collect balloons along the way, but I don't know what they do for you.
 There are also obstacles to crash into, like dead wood, pine trees,
 igloos, moogles, snowmen, rocks, ice boulders, and chocobos.  I believe
 there are four different 'exit' paths; I'll take the left path twice
 and go from there in this FAQ.

 My characters came to in a white forest.  Did yours?  From this point
 onward, you can press S to look at the map you took (but not in some
 screens), which shows where you need to go but not where you are.  I
 spent hours trying to map this place out, only to discover that there's
 almost nothing of interest in this area.  So, I've simply described each
 location and where it is on the map; getting there isn't much of a
 problem.  Your ultimate goal, BTW, is to make it to the red check mark
 shown on the map.

 The locations are:

 ENTRANCE  (looks like a square at the bottom-center of the screen)
 Heading south from this area takes you back out to the World Map.  If
 you return to Icicle Lodge to heal yourself, you'll have to snowboard
 in here again.

 MOUNTAIN CAVE  (small opening just to the right of the ENTRANCE)
 You can hop across the ledges to the top of the screen, but in the next
 room, there's nothing to do but choose to fall/not fall down an icy
 chute that has no effect aside from ejecting you back into the world
 map.  The entrance to this cave is hard to see; it's in the lower-right
 area of the T-junction screen.  You can also get here by going right
 from the LAKE CAVE area.

 FOREST  (forest divided by Y-shaped paths)
 In the main forest screen, there's an item (Mind Source) at the foot of a
 tree near the upper left part of the screen.  If this is where you
 landed after the snowboarding event, then it's just up and to the right
 of where you crashed.

 BURIED AIRPLANE  (tail of plane sticking out to left of forest)
 Nothing here.

 LAKE CAVE  (cave in the middle of the central lake)
 On the surface of the frozen lake, near the shore, there is a green
 item (a Potion).  Be sure to get it.  Then head to the left to reach
 a screen full of ice floes.  Here, you'll have to jump on the floating
 ice chunks to get across, but the chunks surrounding the one you're
 currently standing on will submerge or raise depending on how they
 looked when you arrived there.  If you mess up and they are all
 submerged, you'll have to start all over.  The key is to make sure that
 you're not jumping onto a floe when the ones surrounding it are all
 raised, or else they'll all submerge and you'll fall into the water.
 To get on the ice floats, choose the top option, then use the O button
 and the controller to jump around.  Enter the cave in the next area,
 grab the item bag (it contains a Safety Bit accessory), and leave.

 LONE TREE  (pine tree up and right from the LAKE CAVE)
 Nothing here, either.

 ICE BOULDERS  (northwest corner, left and below the STONE FACE)
 Go into the small cave entrance and grab the item in the northwest
 corner of the cavern (an Elixir), then go out the other entrance.

 RIVER LOG  (above central lake, at mouth of river)
 There's nothing here.

 STONE FACE  (left of the red check mark)
 Nothing here.  Seem familiar?  The stone face has also appeared in
 Secret of Mana and FF5j.

 STEAMING LAKES  (south and east of the check mark)
 You can touch the water on the lefthand bank if you want.  In fact,
 you should, since you can't get the Alexander Materia any other way.
 (Keep reading for details.) Just maneuver yourself as close to the
 shore of the left lake as you can, and when an option appears, pick
 the top one.

 MOUNTAIN CROSSROADS  (top of mountain east of the STEAMING LAKES)
 Once you reach the crossroads (da dum da da :))  head to the upper
 right corner of the screen to go off the map.  In the next area,
 work your way up and to the left.  When this screen repeats a second
 time, look for a Blue Materia (Added Cut) near the beginning
 of the screen, in the upper-right part of the path.  This road takes
 you to the Steaming Lakes area, but if you try to back the way you
 came, you'll see that the screen has changed.  Put another way, you
 couldn't have gotten the Materia unless you took this path since the
 'switching' road isn't marked on the map.

 If you're fast, you can reach the 'lost in the snowfield' section (the
 red checkmark) before anything bad happens.  But if you waste your time
 in this area, you'll pass out.  (This will still happen to you even if
 you reached the snowfield, but then returned to any part of the 'first
 area'.  If that happens, go to the next section.  If you made it to the
 snowfield area, then skip the first paragraph to find out where you are.

 Personally, my suggestion is that you follow the example in the FAQ
 and take the left path twice so that you land in the Forest.  From
 there, you can go right to the Lake Cave area, then continue right
 past the Mountain Cave area (the T-junction), and up into the Mountain
 Crossroads, where you can take the switching path to the Steaming
 Lakes, and then head left into the snowfield.  Not only is this a
 fast way to get through this area, but it also lets you pick up all
 the items along the way and get the Alexander Materia later on (since
 you touched the lake on your way out).

 Also, you'll start off at the bottom end of the snowfield when you first
 get there, so you can just head up to the cave to get the Blue Materia,
 then keep heading north to reach the old man's shack (if you're in need
 of healing and a Save Point).  After talking with him, you can go to the
 Stone Face Area, head south to the Ice Boulders area where an Elixir is,
 then backtrack to the snowfield and go to the right in order to get the
 Alexander Materia before returning to the shack.  Voila!  You've just
 cleared out this _entire_ area in only a few minutes!

 Remember, you _will_ pass out eventually if you return to the first
 area--there's nothing you can do about it, even if you've already
 gone to Horuzofu's shack.  If you don't want to waste too much time
 backtracking just run around in the same few areas until it happens,
 then leave the old man's shack and continue exploring.  Why this still
 happens to you after clearing out this area doesn't seem to make much
 sense, as it's more of a nuisance than anything else, but there's not
 much you can do about it.  If you return to the first area after
 falling unconsious and wait around there again, you'll pass out a
 second time.  In fact, this will always happen to you, so get moving!

 ITEMS IN THIS AREA:  All Materia, Circlet, Alexander Materia.

 You'll awake in the house of an old man (Horuzofu).  Go up the stairs
 and let the old man talk to you; choose the bottom option twice when he
 asks you two questions.  When you wake up the next morning, check out
 the Save Point (since you probably haven't saved prior to entering the
 Icicle Lodge).  If you want to spend the night again, talk to the old
 man in the first room and choose the top choice.  When you leave the
 shack, your friends will be waiting outside.  Make a new party if you
 wish, (see below for directions) then head south.  You may have noticed
 that you can talk to the man from the ground floor even though he is
 above you :)

 If you _didn't_ pass out, then go directly to the shack so that you
 won't pass out.  There, you'll meet an old hermit named Horuzofu.
 Talk to him, and when he asks you a question, answer any way you like.
 The second time he asks you a question, choose the bottom reply.
 You'll spend the night at his shack, and when you leave the next
 morning, your allies will be standing around outside.  Choose either
 choice when an option appears.  Then talk to any member and pick the
 top option to accept a party change or the bottom option to decline,
 if you want to change your members.

 If you don't want to explore the snowfield any more, skip to section d.
 After all, you can return here at any future point in the game,
 providing you have the Highwind.

 Outside, you'll be in a large snowfield.  Use the O button to set down
 spikes that you can use to track your location (since your direction
 changes when the wind picks up).  If you want to explore the rest of
 that first area that you left/passed out in, head south.  When you leave
 the first area from the Steaming Lakes exit, you'll see a rock formation
 with a cave entrance if you keep walking north.  Inside, a Blue Materia
 (All) is lying near the tent.  What's odd is that you seem to
 always run into this on your way back from the first area instead of on
 the way to it (i.e. from the old man's shack).

 If you head east, you'll go through some snowy areas, then arrive at a
 cave entrance.  Talk to the purple fellow inside to enter a battle, but
 only if you touched the water back at the Steaming Lakes.

 You can't Control or Morph her, but you can steal a Saakuretto
 (Circlet) during the battle.  Her cold-based attacks (Cold Breath and
 Blizzard 2) are nothing to worry about, but be careful if she Amulets
 one of your own members.
 _________________________________________________________________________

 If you are victorious, she'll disappear and a Summon Materia (Alexander)
 will drop to the floor, so don't miss it.  While you can use the map here,
 you can't reach this place normally from the first area.  If you go right,
 then down the snowy path, you'll end up at the 'switching' crossroads in
 the first area, though (sort of like a one-way path).

 Going west from the snowfield takes you to an alternate entrance to the
 first area.  There's not that much to do there, anyway, unless you want
 a shortcut to the ICE BOULDERS area where an item is lying in a cave
 (refer to the previous section for more information).

 If you're really having trouble navigating around, think of the
 snowfield like this:

                        Old Man's Shack
                +-----------------------------+

                +-----------------------------+
                  First Area (Steaming Lakes)

 So no matter how far you are along a boundary, you'll still enter that
 area when you hit it.  The same applies to the corners -- you'll hit
 one boundary or the other, so going in a diagonal direction won't get
 you to a new place.  Don't worry about finding an 'exact' spot to enter
 an area, just head in that direction.  The only real landmark is the
 cave with the All materia, but if you head north from the
 Steaming Lakes exit, you're bound to spot it.

 ITEMS IN THIS AREA: Ribbon, Javelin, Elixir, Fire Armlet,
                     Mega Elixir, Speed Source, Enhance Sword, Fang of
                     Dragon Pair, Neo Bahamut, Ether, Hi-Potion,
                     Kaiser Knuckle, Reflect Ring, MP Turbo materia,
                     Poison Ring.

 Once you've had your fun in the snowfield, return to the old man's
 house and heal up or save your game if you need to.  Then, go north
 from the shack to arrive at the slopes of a icy mountain.  Keep in
 mind that you can't explore this area at any time other than right
 now in Disc 2, so make sure to get all the items and other stuff.

 Now, get ready for some finger-smashing fun!  the meter that appears on
 screen when you're outside is your body temperature (the kanji you see
 by the numbers, 'do' actually means 'degrees'): it goes down because of
 the cold climate.  To keep your temperature up, you need to rapidly hit
 the S button.  The highest temperature you can get to is 38, while the
 lowest is 27.  Any less than that (26), and you pass out and find
 yourself back in the old man's house.  It sounds like keeping your heat
 up is easy, but you can only increase it when you're on one of the
 ledges, not while you're climbing up the rock face.  So for those long
 climbs, you have to max out your heat and climb as quickly as you can.
 Luckily, your heat doesn't go down during a battle. Remember, it's not
 how hard you press the S button, but how fast you press it, so try to
 get in as many presses as you can to max out your temperature.  If you'd
 rather cheat, refer to the Game Shark code section in the second part
 of this FAQ--one of my 'fix-all' codes is in there that will give you a
 high body heat no matter how long you stand around.

 In this area, there's nowhere else to go but up, so climb along the
 rock face until you arrive at the cave entrance, pausing at each ledge
 to restore your body heat.  Always keep an eye out for the red flags;
 they indicate which part of the wall you can climb.  Inside, go through
 the two archways into the next cavern.  Here, climb up the stairs and
 go through the south exit.  In the adjoining area, walk all the way to
 the right to find a hidden chamber with a chest; inside it is a Ribbon.
 Then return to the main path and head north, then west, through the
 entrance.  Cross the icy bridge in the third cavern and press the
 SELECT button to bring up the cursor; it'll help you navigate through
 the twsiting passage before you.  Once you reach the top, examine the
 boulder and choose the top option when it presents itself.  This will
 make you push the boulder and free up the blocked passage beneath you.
 You can still move while the boulder is rolling--notice that you can
 stand right where it falls and you will recieve no damage (then again,
 Cloud is the same guy who can run around in the cold wearing a
 sleeveless shirt and not die of hypothermia...must be those corn
 flakes).

 Go back to the other room (where you got the Ribbon), and open the
 purple chest to the northeast; there's a Javelin lying inside it.  Now,
 return to the room that you exited from the south (the one with the
 formerly blocked passage), and go north along the passage until you
 reach another exit.  This leads to the upper path above the chest with
 the Javelin--keep following it and you'll find yourself outside.

 Build up your temperature, then climb up the wall.  After going a short
 distance, you're given a choice (up, down, or right).  Pick the top
 option (up), and head up until you reach a ledge.  Keep climbing upward,
 and you'll be prompted with another choice (right or down).  Pick the
 top option and head right to arrive at another ledge.  Then climb up
 until you raech the next ledge; it has a path going left and an
 unmarked path that goes to the right (i.e. there's no flag by it).  The
 right path is a dead end, so take the left path and keep climbing up
 along the wall (you'll find another ledge on the way) until you reach a
 second cave entrace.

 This large cavern is pocked with holes.  There's an exit and a treasure
 chest, but they are too high to reach, at the moment.  Don't miss the
 Save Point between the chest and the exit.  Nab the other chest in the
 lower right corner of the room (there's an Elixir inside of it), then go
 north from the chest to find a passage that leads outside.   Once you're
 out in the open again, head north, then go around the bend and head
 south and east.

 In the next room, examine the area immediately to the right to find a
 chest with an Fire Armlet inside.  There are four huge icicles
 here that you need to knock into the holes in the lower cavern.  This is
 done by 'fighting' them.  Each icicle is guarded by several yellow bats.

 _________________________________________________________________________
 @{b}TIPS:  TSURARA  <Icicle>                     LEVEL: 30  HP: 3000  MP: 300@{ub}

        @{b}IBIRUHEDDO  <Ibil Head?>                LEVEL: 28  HP: 740  MP: 45@{ub}

 The icicle (Tsurara) can counter with 'Tsurara Otoshi' (Icicle Drop).
 It will do this to any person who attacks it, tries to steal from it, or
 the like.  You don't have to kill the bats in order to win the battle
 (all you have to do is 'kill' the icicle), but since they can Silence
 your characters and recover HP when they attack you, you may want to get
 them out of the way before attacking the icicle.  Killing the icicle is
 worth 500 exp, 0 AP, and 0 gil, so if you want some AP and gil, you may
 want to kill the Ibiruheddos (which, incidentally, you can Morph
 into Holy Torches.
 _________________________________________________________________________

 Each time you win a battle, you'll be given an option.  If you pick the
 bottom choice, you'll drop down to the room below, while picking the top
 choice lets you stay where you are (so you can continue to 'fight' the
 other icicles.  After knocking down the last icicle, choose to stay
 where you are so that you can get the chest on the far left (it has a
 Mega Elixir inside).  Then, go back along the path.  Just before you
 reach the door, an option appears; pick the bottom choice to jump down
 to the room below.

 When the icicles drop down here, the floor of the cavern is 'raised'.
 After knocking down 3 of them, you can reach the exit, knock down all
 4 and you can get the chest on the ledge in the upper left corner of
 the room (which contains a Speed Source).  When you're ready, go through
 the now-avilable exit by hopping across the stones.  This leads to the
 left side of the outer path.  Be sure to examine the chest that's here
 to get an Enhance Sword, then follow the path as it curves back on
 itself and leads to the lower passage in the icicle room.

 Keep following the path, and you'll find yourself on the side of the
 mountain yet again.  Grab the rock face and climb to the right.
 After a while, three options will appear (up, left, or right).  Pick
 the bottom choice and keep holding right to make Cloud ascend the
 side of the mountain.  When you reach the next ledge, raise your
 temperature and take the path that leads to the left.  As you're
 climbing, another set of options will appear (up, down, or right).
 Choose the top option and keep climbing up.  Once you've made it
 beyond the second ledge, you'll find a final cave entrance.

 This area has a hard-to-miss Save Point in it, and if you examine the
 nearby pool of light, your HP and MP will be completely restored, and
 all dead characters will be revived.  Now is a perfect time to stock
 up on goodies--you can use the pool to stay healthy while fighting the
 enemies for exp, AP, and gil, and you can learn Smelly Breath from the
 Molbols just outside (be sure to wear a Ribbon!)  Plus, you can win
 Dragon Armlets from the Blue Dragons in this cave, which will halve
 damage taken from Fire, Cold, or Lightning attacks, and win Molbol
 Tentacles from defeated Molbols.  There's a boss encounter coming your
 way, so make sure you're ready to do battle, then exit the chamber by
 going to the far right.

 In the adjoining hallway, you'll see one of those shrouded creatures
 (similar to the ones in Nivelheim be thrown to the floor.  Before you
 have a chance to examine it, you'll be attacked by a two-headed boss.

 _________________________________________________________________________
 @{b}BOSS TIPS: TSUINHEDDO  <TwinHead: Right Neck>  LV: 43  HP: 18000  MP: 350
            TSUINHEDDO  <TwinHead: Left Neck>   LV: 43  HP: 18000  MP: 350@{ub}

 In case you're confused, the 'right head' is the scaly one, and the 'left
 head' is the one with horns.  Anyway, you should have the Aurora, Dragon,
 and Fire Armlets equipped on your members to reduce damage from
 the scaly head's Fire breath and the horned head's ice breath.  Use
 Mabarrier to up your defense, then Haste yourselves.  Try using Earth and
 Comet spells, as well and summonings, like Alexander, Leviathan, and
 Bahamut to soften the boss up.  However, don't use Poison (which does no
 damage) or the Kjata summon spell (which will heal both heads).  Ice
 works well on the scaly head, and Fire works well on the horned head,
 but don't confuse the two since you will heal a head instead of hurt it.
 You may also want to use Tsuika Kouka and attack a Fire or Cold materia
 in order to attack with that sort of element (but don't attack the
 other head, for the same reason).  In addition to breath attacks, the
 boss can also use a dual cold/Fire breath attack, it can cast Quega,
 and has an explosion type attack that will inflict around 1400 damage
 to all members.  It will use this attack when each head is killed (so
 you will have to deal with it twice during the battle, once when you
 kill one head, and then again when you kill the other).  I highly
 advise that you concentrate on one head at first instead of trying to
 kill them both at the same time because this attack _will_ kill your
 pary if it happens in succession (which means you lose).  When it's
 defeated, you'll get a Dragon Fang from the boss.
 _________________________________________________________________________

 If you were badly beaten during the fight, you can always return to the
 room with the pool to heal yourselves.  Otherwise, continue down the
 passage; it leads outside (Cloud sure moves slow out here, doesn't he?)
 Then climb the icy wall up to the top, where an automatic sequence will
 play.  After it finishes, head along the side of the inner crater.  In
 the next area, Tifa will talk with you if she's in your party; if she
 isn't, she'll promptly appear and insist on coming with you, which
 means you'll have to kick a member out of your current group.  Head
 to the left.

 In the next area, climb down to the lower path and look for a red materia
 (Neo Bahamut) near the bottom edge of the screen.  You can't do
 anything about the shrouded guy leaping off-screen, so ignore him.  After
 getting the materia, you can hop up to a small island of rock where there
 is a Save Point.  When you're done there, juMP Plus again to return to the
 top path, and walk to the left.  You'll see a short intermission with
 the three heads of Shinra and several scientists heading towards the
 Crater in the Highwind, the airship you saw back in Junon Town.

 Once the intermission is over, walk left and you'll reach the first of
 three 'shield' screens.  Talk to the two shrouded men, and they'll
 each leave behind an item when they die (an Ether and a Hi-Potion).
 To get past the flickering shield that's in front of you, stand as close
 to it as you can, then wait until the green aura is almost gone.  Now,
 quickly run through it or you'll be knocked back when the shield's aura
 grows stronger.  If you mess up, you'll be repelled by the shield and
 will be attacked by a monster:

 _________________________________________________________________________
 @{b}TIPS:  UINDOUINGU  <Wind Wing>                  LV: 36  HP: 1900  MP: 350@{ub}

 For starters, you can steal a Hi-Potion from the Wind Wing, and you can
 transform it into a Phoenix Down.  Even better, you can control it using
 a Manipulate materia and make it attack itself!  In other words, this is
 an easy battle.
 _________________________________________________________________________

 If you happen to touch the shield from the other side, you'll get
 knocked back to the beginning, so be careful.

 In the next screen, more of those shrouded creatures are running around
 and dying.  Ignore them, but don't miss the chest near the first left
 turn of the path; there's a Kaiser Knuckle inside it.  Follow the path
 until you reach the next screen.  The second shield is here, but unlike
 the first one, there's a surge of energy travelling along the shield
 that will knock you back even if the shield's aura is almost gone.  So,
 wait until the energy surge has passed _and_ the aura is nearly
 invisible, then dash across.  If either defense knocks you back, you'll
 have to fight a second Wind Wing (see the above strategy).

 Beyond the shield, Sephiroth awaits.  He'll cut down two more of those
 black creatures before turning invisible and toying around with Cloud.
 After he attacks the party, he'll summon a second version of Jenova to
 kill Cloud and his friends.

 _________________________________________________________________________
 @{b}BOSS TIPS: JENOBA*DEATH  <Jenova*Death>         LV: 55  HP: 25000  MP:800@{ub}

 Jenova will try to Silence your members from time to time, and uses a
 Red Light attack often (usually after being attacked with magic).  It
 causes little damage, but too many of these will really mess up your
 party.  Jenova's last form of attack is a spurt of fire bubbles (even
 weaker than the Red Light attack).  As you can see, this battle is not
 hard at all; just hack away with physical attacks, or if you think you
 have enough HPs, use Comet and cast Bahamut, Neo Bahamut, and
 Alexander.  It's advisable that you wear the Fire Armlet or
 Dragon Armlet, since Jenova's attacks all cause Fire-based damage.
 Give the Fire Armlet to your best spellcaster, and you can
 knock out Jenova and gain life back at the same time :)  You'll win
 a Reflect Ring when the battle's over.
 _________________________________________________________________________

 After the boss is killed, you'll get the Black Materia back (and it's
 actually black this time :))  Once you're back in control of Cloud,
 he confesses that since Sephiroth was able to manipulate him last time,
 he might try it again.  Therefore, someone else should hold the Black
 Materia and stay here while Cloud and the others follow after Sephiroth.
 The first time I got here, only Red 13 would take the Black Materia.
 This time, only Barret would.  No matter what character you get, simply
 choose the top option when it is available (you won't get an option if
 that character refuses to take it).  Finally, talk to Tifa.

 When you're in control of Cloud again, head north.  There's a materia
 here (MP Turbo, but notice that it's yellow when you pick it up!), as
 well as a Save Point and a chest containing a Poison Ring.  If you go
 north from here, you'll run into the third and final shield.   In
 addition to having all the defenses of the previous shield (the glowing
 aura and the moving energy surge), bolts of lightning will strike the
 ground repeatedly.  Since the lightning strikes in short bursts with
 long pauses in between, wait for the shield's aura to fade, the energy
 surge to pass, _and_ wait for a pause in the lightning strikes before
 attempting to pass through the shield.  If you're hit by any one of
 those defenses, you'll have to fight a Wind Wing again (refer to the
 strategy section above).  Once you're past the shield, head along the
 path.  It leads to an exact replicate of Nivelheim.

 This next scene is sorta like a 'semi-interactive' flashback.  You get
 to see Sephiroth run around in Nivelheim, but this time, there's another
 guy following him (Zekkusu, the guy you heard about in Gongaga Village).
 Talk to your other party member, then to Tifa.  In the next scene,
 Zekkusu will look around Nivelheim (which has been reduced to smoldering
 rubble), and chat with Zangan (sp?), who I think was Tifa's mentor.
 (BTW, you can go to the Main Menu while Zekkusu is running around.  It's
 pointless, but I thought it was sort of amusing :))  Then, your party
 appears in a flaming building, and Sephiroth appears.  Instead of
 attacking, he talks to the party.  When you can move, talk to Sephiroth
 and he'll teleport around the room.  When you're in control of Cloud once
 more, talk to Tifa twice.  Sephiroth warps around some more, then shows
 Cloud a picture of him, Tifa, and Zekkusu.  After that, Cloud has another
 fit, and the screen fades out.

 In the next scene, Rufus, Scarlet, and Hojo (the scientist)
 arrive at the crater.  Before them is a monster encased in ice.  It's
 one of the three 'Weapons', which awakens and watches them, then starts
 moving.  Following that, Sephiroth appears in the guise of Tifa and
 knocks out the other characters, then tricks whoever is guarding the
 Black Materia to go to the center of the crater.  Your party will
 appear in the area where the Shinra members are at, and the person with
 the Black Materia gives it to Cloud, who then flies to the structure
 where Sephiroth is at (while you can move around up here, the game takes
 over your controls in a few seconds anyway).  Once Cloud's given the
 Black Materia to Sephiroth, the whole crater starts to break apart and
 your party (sans Cloud) escape on the Highwind along with the rest of
 the Shinra crew.

 ITEMS IN THIS AREA: Enemy Skill materia, Chocobo Attract
                     Materia, Fourth Bracelet, Yoshiyuki (if you
                     didn't get it the first time).  Note that none of
                     these items are actually found in Junon Town, but
                     since I talk about them in this section, they're
                     listed here.

 When you come to, you'll find yourself incarcerated back in Junon Town.
 Without Cloud, you'll be taking control of Barret and Tifa for most of
 this section.  As Tifa, talk to Barret.  Rufus and Haidekka will show
 up.  Now that you're in control of Barret, follow Tifa as the guards take
 her away (don't miss the Save Point), and prepare to execute her.  Once
 Junon Town is attacked by the freed Weapon, one of the Shinra officials
 knocks out Scarlet.  It's turns out to be none other than Cait Sith,
 who helps Barret fight the two soldiers who are guarding him.

 Physical attacks will do the trick here, although you can control them
 if you want.  If this battle gives you trouble, you need to gain some
 levels at some point in the game.
 _________________________________________________________________________

 Notice how the guard will run away and disappear after the battle?  I
 guess that glitch went unnoticed...anyway, examine the door in the lower
 right corner of the screen and use the controller or the O button to make
 Barret try to pull it open.  An FMV sequence follows in which the Sister
 Ray is readied and Junon Town prepares to engage the approaching Weapon.
 When it collides with the city, gas starts pumping into the chamber Tifa
 is trapped in.  When you're in control of Barret, go and talk to Cait
 Sith.  Then go out the door and when it closes, head right, then out the
 door.  Outside, head down the road.  If you got Yuffie, she'll be here
 masquerading as a newscaster; talk to her and continue to your left.
 Once the Weapon has rose out of the water, continue to the left until
 you arrive at the Airport.  Then, run to the center platform and examine
 the yellow box to be lifted to the upper level.  From there, continue
 towards the airship by heading right.

 When you're in control of Tifa again, you have to pick up the key on
 the ground so you can free yourself from the gas chamber.  Your
 controls are:

 S       Move right arm
 X       Move feet
 O       Move left arm
 T       Move Tifa's head

 You'll need to press the buttons in this order:  X, X, T, X+T, T+O, O.
 (Or, press X, X, T, X+T, T+S, S if you want to free her other hand
 instead...it makes no difference).

 Pressing them has the following effect:

 When you press X, Tifa will stretch out her legs.  Pressing X a second
 time makes her drag the key towards her.  Then press T to sit back in
 the chair.  Then press T and X at the same time (you don't need to hold
 them, just press them), and she'll lift the key up with her feet and
 take hold of it with her teeth at the same time.  After that, T+O
 together will make her free her arm using the key.  Finally, press O
 so that she can grab the key and use it to release her other arm.

 Feel free to take your time doing this since waiting around won't do
 anything to you (Tifa's invincible!  Mwa, ha ha!!)

 Examine the back of the room by the left side of the chair to shut off
 the gas, then examine the door.  After the monster provides you with
 an exit, climb outside and work your way down the front of the tower
 (don't worry about the guards).  When you reach the bottom, head toward
 the upper left corner of the screen (the cursor will appear to help you
 keep track of your location, but you can disable it if you want).  In
 the next screen, make your way down to the frontmost cylinder of the
 cannon, then press up to go along the front of it and end up on the
 cannon barrel itself (this can be a little tricky).  Just as you reach
 the edge of the cannon, Scarlet.  She'll start slapping you, so
 press the O button to slap back (go Tifa, go)!  If you're fast enough,
 you'll slap her to the floor after 5-6 good hits.  If she gets in more
 slaps, you get knocked over.  Despite the outcome of the 'fight', Tifa
 will still be rescued by Barret in the Highwind.

 Once in the airship, head to the cockpit where you'll talk with Cid.
 When he finishes, talk to Red 13 and Cid again, then chat with the man
 piloting the airship.  After that, go to the room marked 'Operations'
 and talk to the man there.  He will let you assemble a new group with
 Tifa as the leader.  From this point onward, you can return to this room
 and talk with the man to activate PHS, restore your HP and MP, or save
 your game.  Now that you have a party, return to the cockpit and talk to
 the man again.  Choose the top option, and you can control the Highwind!
 To pilot it, use these controls:

 S       When held, you can use the Pad to fly without changing the
         direction you're facing
 X       Press to land
 O       Move the Highwind in the direction you're facing
 T       Takes you inside the Highwind
 Pad     Press left/right to turn, up/down to rise or descend
 Start   Reveals/enlarges/hides the map
 Select  Same as Start

 Notice that your other vehicles (the Gold Saucer vehicle and Cid's
 airplane) are gone for good.  BTW, you enter the Highwind by pressing
 O when you're close to it (like other vehicles).  To gain control of
 it again, just talk to the man at the wheel and pick the top option.
 At this point, you'll probably want to look around and go to various
 places.  However, you can only land on _green, grassy_ ground, and
 nowhere else, which limits the areas you can explore (this doesn't
 include the canyon floor on the Northern Continent).  There are two
 areas you can now reach with the Highwind.  The first one is a cave
 with a sleeping man that's just beyond the mountain range near Midgar
 City (you can go here with the Buggy, but since you no longer have it,
 you'll have to use the Highwind).  Also, there's a house to the right
 of Icicle Lodge, you can talk to the green Chocobo inside to get a
 free Enemy Skill Materia, and the purple geezer who lives
 here will sell you various chocobo foods.  Finally, if you return to
 the Chocobo Farm, you'll find a purple materia (Chocobo Attract) near
 the edge of the now-empty Chocobo pen.  From now on, you can breed
 Chocobos here (refer to the 'Secrets and Strategies' section for
 details.

 If you look, there's a lake near Junon now (I thought this didn't
 appear until Disc 3 *sheepish grin*)  There's also a barrier
 surrounding the Crater, and of course, a huge meteor is hanging in the
 sky (the result of Sephiroth casting Meteo via the Black Materia).  A
 lot of places now sell different items, among them Junon Town*,
 Fort Condor, Costa Del Sol, and Rocket Town, for example.  There's also
 some new treasure to be found in Rocket Town: there's a chest with a
 Fourth Bracelet in the store that sells accessories, in the back of the
 adjoining room.  And if you didn't get the Yoshiyuki from the
 old man in Disc 1, you can get it now.

  * In very last area of Junon, there's a man standing out in the middle
    of the road.  If you talk to him and choose the bottom option,
    nothing happens.  But if you choose the top option, the Shinra
    helicopter lands and you're given another choice.  Pick the top option
    and you can ride it back to the first area of Junon Town!  If you
    choose the bottom option, you'll be flown back out to the World Map.

 Finally, keep in mind that there are some things that Tifa can't do,
 like enter the Gold Saucer or play the piano in her house in Nivelheim.
 Ditto with Cid, who becomes the leader during the next section (keep
 reading).

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------

 ITEMS IN THIS AREA:  Curse Ring, Elixir.

 Get in the Highwind and fly to the Southern Continent.  Look around until
 you spot a forest with a small village nearby.  Land in the grass, and
 enter the village, Mideel.  Look around, and be sure to do some shopping;
 the items here are expensive, but well worth your money.  When you're
 done, go to the weapon shop and examine the door in the back of the room.
 You will try to knock on it.  Go outside and climb up the stairs, then
 walk along the floorboards behind the house where you can buy
 accessories.   You should hear a sound.  If you press O to examine the
 floor, you'll receive a message.  Return to the weapon shop and examine
 the door in the back again.  When an option appears, select the top
 choice.  You'll mess around with the door.  When the shopkeeper asks
 what's going on, pick the bottom option, and he'll give you the Cursed
 Ring accessory.  (If you want to see your character act funny, pick the
 top option instead--works better with Tifa than with anyone else, IMO.
 Of course, you'll have to reset and try again if you want the Cursed
 Ring.)

 When you try to explore the north end of the town, Tifa automatically
 goes over to the cat in the middle of the screen.  While playing with
 it she hears that a strange man has been brought to the hospital--inside
 is none other than Cloud, who survived the blast of energy back at the
 Crater.  However, he's nothing more than a vegetable now.  Tifa insists
 on staying by his side.  Back at the Highwind, Cait Sith reveals that
 the Shinra are hunting for the four Huge Materia, which they plan to
 use in order to destroy the Meteo before it crashes into the Earth.
 Barret gets distressed when he learns that the Shinra plan to destroy
 North Corel in order to get the Huge Materia, then Cid declares himself
 the new party leader!  Despite his dorky running style, Cid makes a
 good front man.  Once you're able to control him, go to the Operations
 room and make a new team.

 Before you go anywhere else, land and return to Mideel.  You can now
 check out the house in the middle of the town, where an old man sits
 betting his cat.  There's a large green item on the man's bed (an
 Elixir).  If you try to leave, the cat turns out to be a ferocious
 dog!  When an option appears, pick the top one to admit that you took
 the Elixir.  However, the man will let you keep it.  On the other hand,
 if you pick the bottom option, Cid will feign innocence, until the old
 man tells him that he took his Elixir.  Either way, you still get the
 item.  There's nothing else to do here (at least for now, anyways), so
 leave the town behind and board the Highwind (notice how Cid mentions
 the Fort Condor).

 At this point in the game, two of the four Huge Materia sub-quests are
 available to you: you can either get the Huge Materia in North Corel,
 or get the one at Fort Condor.  The choice is yours.  If you want the
 one in North Corel first, keep reading.  If you'd rather pick up the
 one at Fort Condor first, skip to section 4g below.  Remember, you
 DON'T have to succeed at Huge Materia Quests; in fact, you can lose all
 four and still proceed with the game (if you decide to do this, just
 ignore any mention of Huge Materia for the remainder of the FAQ).

 Ready to go?  The next thing you have to do is stop a train from smashing
 into the town of North Corel.  You can pilot the Highwind to two places;
 North Corel, and then work your way back through the old train tracks to
 the Makoro furnace, or you can land at the nearby cave-like entrance that
 leads to the furnace and take the train from there.  Either way, you'll
 still have to do a bit of walking, so it's up to you (check out sections
 3n and 3o if you don't remember what I'm talking about).  Anyway, once
 you reach the furnace, head to the center and you'll be attacked by some
 Shinra guards (easy to defeat).  After you do them in, a train will
 leave the furnace.  What you have to do is catch up with it before it
 rams into North Corel.  The next scene finds you and your companions on
 a train trying to catch up to the Shinra train.

 Remember the digit-damaging fun you had back at the Frozen Mountain?
 Well, this time, it's worse.  You have to press Up and the T button
 in a steady, yet _extremely_ fast motion to make Cid pull the levers
 of the train so that you can catch up to the Shinra train.  Even worse,
 there's a time limit--you have to reach the train, board it, kill the
 enemies on board, and stop it all within 10 minutes.  If you practice,
 you should be able to catch up to the train in about 23-30 seconds, but
 remember that you'll need about 4 minutes, at best, to beat the enemies
 on board, so work quickly.  You fight monsters each time you leap to
 a new train car, (five battles in all) and while they're relatively
 easy to win, they do take up your time.  If you have learned it by now,
 Degeon can be used in the first two battles for a quick win.  If you're
 low on time, don't use Summon Materia because the Counter Attack still
 decreases during the casting (which usually takes some time).

 Assuming you get to the locomotive with time remaining, wait for the
 conversation between Cid and your other characters to stop.  You can
 now do the following; press up + T to slow the train, or down + X to
 Speed Plus it up.  Once Cid grabs the controls, press:

                 Up + Triangle, Down + X, Down + X
                 or:  Down + X, Down + X, Down + X

     (if there are more commands then these, let me know, pls)

 You can't enter either command while your buddies are talking to you,
 so skip through the conversations when they occur.  The train will
 speed up, but will slow just as it reaches the town, if you've done it
 correctly.

 If you stop the train in time, you get a Key Item (the Huge Materia),
 and a little boy gives you a green materia (Ultima).  The next morning,
 go to the house below the inn and a lady in a hat will give you Barret's
 Level 4 Limit Break Manual.  If you messed up, then the train runs
 straight through North Corel.  You don't get the Huge Materia, and if you
 want the Ultima materia, you'll have to buy it from the same kid for
 50,000 gil.  However, you can still get the manual from the lady in the
 hat and spend some free time at the inn ;P.  So, it's really in your
 best interest to save the town.  If you really want to keep playing
 after losing the Huge Materia, then continue on to section 3g, or if
 this is your second attempted quest, go to section 3h.

 (Remember, you can do this before or after the North Corel Huge Materia
 quest; it's your choice).

 Pop into the Highwind and fly back to the blue tower with the big gold
 bird on it (read section 3l if you don't remember where it was).  Enter
 it, and climb to the top of the tower.  Talk to the man in the room with
 the locked door.  Choose the middle option, and you'll get to play a
 mini-game.  For instructions/strategies, please refer to the 'Having Fun'
 bit in section 7.

 When you win, you can open the sealed door.  On the rooftop is a red
 materia (Summon Phoenix), and if you talk to the man in white wearing
 the large hat in the lower room, you get a Huge Materia.  For a condor's
 baby, that bird sure looks like a Chocobo if you ask me....

 Head back to the village on the Southern Continent where you left Tifa
 and Cloud behind.  When you talk to Tifa, the screen will start to
 shake.  Go outside, and you'll be attacked by a huge black dragon.

 _________________________________________________________________________
 @{b}BOSS TIPS: ARUTEMAUEPON  <Ultima Weapon>       (you can't see his stats.)@{ub}

 This boss has only two attacks, Quega, and the Ultima Beam.  He's pretty
 easy to beat, so just keep summoning your best monsters and use physical
 attacks to deal out damage.  After you've injured it enough, it will fly
 away.
 _________________________________________________________________________

 The next scene with Tifa and Cloud is so funny!  They're puffy and
 Shotgundeformed, and well let's just say any sense of danger or
 surprise at this sudden attack is forgotten once you see their wide-
 eyed faces as they escape the crumbling village.

 After Tifa and Cloud take a dive, you'll find yourself playing with
 Tifa, who's in a strange world filled with Cloud's memories.  First,
 talk to the northmost Cloud.  You'll head into his memories of the
 trip he took to that one town near the Jenova plant with Sephiroth.
 When Cloud shows up, speak to him again.  When you reach the 'center'
 of Cloud's mind again, speak to the Cloud on the left.  Once you're in
 control of Tifa, converse with the Cloud sitting on the steps to the
 right (near the 'kid' Cloud).

 Then talk to the 'kid' Cloud and look in the window.  When you can
 move Tifa, talk to the 'shadow' Cloud.  Once you're back in Cloud's
 mind talk  to the 'real' Cloud and go back to the town area again.
 Everything else unfolds by itself (you can go to the Main Menu
 during the burning of Nivelheim--again!)  At the end, speak with Cloud
 one last time, and you'll return to the 'real' world.

 ITEMS IN THIS AREA:  Contain materia, God's Hand, Battle Trumpet, x ryuu
                      x getsutou, Suishin x no Uroko (it's a Key Item, but
                      since you don't have to get it, I'm listing it up
                      here.)

 Back at the airship, prepare a new team and take control of the Highwind.
 You can buy goods that weren't available before back in Mideel, and
 you'll want to get the Contain materia orb at some point.  To get it,
 climb up the slope on the west side of town to where the hyperactive kid
 is running around (remember him?)  Talk to his White Chocobo and pick the
 first option (make sure you have at least one Mimetto Greens on you).
 When a list of six options appear, pick the fifth one from the top.  The
 chocobo will then reveal the Contain materia, which you can take.

 Furthermore, if you went into each store in Mideel and talked to the
 hyperactive kid in each one, he will now be selling all the items that
 you could normally buy there!  However, if you didn't go into any of
 the shops, or only talked to him in one shop or two shops, then he will
 only be selling items from those stores or will be selling nothing at
 all.

 Also, at this point in the game, the man who lost his keys will appear
 outside Midgar City, enabling you to get the Key to Midgar City, among
 other things.  You might want to take some time now to breed Chocobos,
 do some shopping, or maybe have some fun at the Gold Saucer (since you
 can now get in with Cloud in your party).

 Whenever you're ready to proceed with the game, head to Junon Town for
 the third Huge Materia quest (you can't do the fourth one until later).
 Head into the center of Junon, and go down the main road (you'll see a
 scene with Cloud inspecting the damage that the Weapon inflicted on the
 town earlier).  Keep walking until you arrive at the gray underpassage
 where a commander is drilling his men.  He will order his men to run
 away when he sees you.  Continue down the passage until you see a door
 labeled '1' against the left wall.  Enter it, and you'll find yourself
 in an elevator.  Two guards in here will attack you; dispatch them and
 let the lady take you down to the bottom of the elevator shaft.

 When you step out, you'll be attacked by more Shinra soldiers.  Ignore
 the dog and go down the slope, then through the door.  In the next room,
 head down the set of stairs until you reach another door.  Past it is
 yet another set of stairs, and at the bottom is a Save Point.  Go through
 the door here to reach a second lift which takes you to the bottom of
 the sea floor.  Head north unil you reach the underwater tunnel, and
 follow it until you arrive at the Makoro plant.  Inside, examine the red
 light on the far wall to pump water out of the chamber.  Step outside
 and you'll find yourself in a huge undersea dock where several submarines
 are sitting.  Go along the walkway--it leads to a hall with a Save Point.
 Walk north from here to arrive at a room filled with guards.

 If you talk to the guard who's walking around, he'll attack you.  You'll
 then fight the two other guards by the opening in a second battle.  If
 you don't talk to the walking guard, then all three will ambush you.
 However, if you let yourself get ambushed, you won't have to fight the
 second set of soldiers by the other opening.  Decide what you want to do
 (fun, isn't it?) and fight the guards accordingly.  Then go through the
 opening to your right to find a chamber full of machinery.  Cloud will
 automatically stop in front of one of the machines as you walk past it.
 When you can control him again, head to the right to see the Red Huge
 Materia being loaded onto a Shinra subMarlenee.  Reno of the Turks is
 here, and he'll summon a mechanical freak to take you out while he makes
 a hasty retreat.

                                               (all weak vs. lightning)

 This boss is composed of three parts.  It can imprison two of your
 characters in his arms, and they recieve 1/3 the amount of damage that
 it receives from your attacks.  However, since it has three parts, if
 you're making an attack that hits more than once, your ally gets struck
 twice or even three times!  Furthermore, if the third character is
 killed while the other two are imprisoned, the battle is instantly lost.
 Destroying it's arms should be your top priority, but the arms rotate
 and switch sides when they are hit, so adjust your attacks accordingly.
 Summoning spells and enemy skills work well here.  The boss' attacks are
 not so strong, but they come quickly.  The worst one is the Lapis Laser
 that strikes all members for +1600 damage.  BTW, the only way to free a
 character is to destroy the arm that's holding them, or have him or her
 die.  This makes the Phoenix summon very useful if you just freed a
 friend and want to revive and attack at the same time.  You'll get the
 God's Hand weapon when you kill it and both arms.
 _________________________________________________________________________

 With the Carry Armor out of the way, head to the left to find a chest
 with the Battle Trumpet inside it.  Then go back to the right and run
 along the pier until you reach gray submarine.  Open the chest by the
 stairs to get the Scimitar.  To the left of that chest is a
 chest holding a Key Item: the Suishin x no Uroko (Fire Extinguisher).
 You'll need it later so be sure to pick it up.  Go up the stairs to
 find a bunch of soldiers running around in place (ha!) who will fight
 you.  Cloud will then enter the submarine and be ambushed by three
 soldiers.  You may win a set of 'Shinra Relaxed Form Defense Tool'
 armor from the guards, but it's not that great.  Anyway, there's a Save
 Point here, and when you're done using it, head through the northern
 door to reach the bridge of the submarine.

 Here, you'll meet two guards and their scared-as-hell commander.  You
 can either choose the bottom option and let them live, or you can pick
 the top option and kill them.  You can steal the 'Shinra Armor Type
 Defend Tool Reform' (_very_ strong armor) from the captain if you
 choose to fight.  Whatever your choice, examine the captain's seat when
 you're able to and you'll be given three options.  Pick the second one
 to climb into the chair.  From there, pick the top option to see a
 description of the sub controls, or the bottom option to start up the
 sub and enter the submarine mini-game (explained below).

 Your controls on the submarine are:

 S       Shoot torpedoes (only when you're near an enemy craft)
 X       Backward thrust
 T       Forward thrust
 Pad     Move left/right or descend/raise
 R1      Switch between close-up or bird's eye view
 R2      Switch between near, overhead, or cockpit view
 Start   Pause; show control screen

 The walls of the ocean floor are shown in blue, and there are diamond-
 shaped mines that are invisible until you get close.  You can tell how
 far they are from the floor by the red columns beneath them.  The
 purpose of this 'mini-game' is to destroy the the main Shinra sub (red)
 in the time allotted, although you can kill some of the ten yellow
 submarines if you want to.  During the mission, the following warnings
 will appear:

 WARNING         When an enemy sub is approaching
 ALERT           When an enemy sub is firing
 MINE            You are about to run into a mine
 CONFLICT        The sub cannot move because you are
                 steering it against/along a rock face

 You lose the game if one of two things happen; time runs out (you have
 10 minutes to destroy the submarine), or if your life bar (which is
 represented by the red/green bar at the bottom of the screen) is
 depleted as a result of being hit by missiles, crashing into the walls
 or floor once too often, or ramming another sub.  If you win, then the
 submarine you're in is automatically piloted to shore.  If you mess up,
 your characters will jettison themselves from the sub.  Either way,
 you'll learn that a Huge Materia is being transported from the Junon
 Airport.  You can go there (it's the same place where the Highwind was
 docked) to see some FMV of the plane taking off, or not (it's optional).

 At this point in the game, you have two options available to you.  You
 can either sneak back into Junon and get yourself another submarine,
 or you can go to Rocket Town and do the fourth and final Huge Materia
 quest.  If you already have a submarine, then you can do some underwater
 exploring or do the last Huge Materia quest (refer to section 3j for
 the former and section 3k for the latter).  If you need to get a second
 submarine, then keep reading.

 Go back into the main part of Junon Town and work your way back to the
 gray hallway, down the elevator with the woman, and to the room with the
 guards, a dog, and the sloping floor.  Beat the guards and examine the
 dog.  When he moves aside, follow him and examine him again.  Choose the
 top option, and you'll enter the red Shinra submarine.  When the guards
 show up, choose the top option to let them go, or the bottom option to
 fight them.  In the cockpit room, choose the top option to save the
 commander, or the bottom option to fight him and his men.  Either way,
 you still get to pilot the sub.  Note that if you got the gray sub, you
 can't go through here and get the red sub.

                      Oritsuru, Steal as well materia.

 This section outlines a series of side-quests and optional events.  While
 some have to be done at a certain point, the others are listed here only
 because you now have a submarine and can explore the ocean.  You can skip
 this section and go on to 3k for the final Huge Materia Quest if you'd
 rather do the things in here at a later point.

 The controls for either submarine (gray or red) are as follows:

 X       Submerge/Ascend
 O       Propel forward
         - (doesn't work in overhead view)
 Pad     Move in any direction
         - (raise or lower while underwater)
 L1/R1   Turn to the left or right
 L2/R2   Switch from side/overhead view
         - (doesn't work while underwater)
 Start   Show/enlarge/hide map
         - (cannot enlarge map while underwater)
 Select  Same as Start

 The submarine can cross deep water, but not shallows.  If you can't
 get by an area while skimming the sea, try submerging and looking for
 a passage.  If you can't get over a rock wall while submerged, try
 ascending and looking for another way around.  Also, the sub can only
 land at docks such as the one near Junon Town.  BTW, the mini-game at
 the Gold Saucer also becomes available once you have a submarine.

 If you sunk the red submarine, then get in your submarine and look at
 the map.  Head to the chain of small islands southeast from the
 weaponsmith's house (the guy who lived near the Gold Saucer).  Submerge
 and you'll find the red submarine.  Should you touch it, Cloud will
 retrieve the Red Huge Materia from the wrecked submarine.  If you
 failed to sink it earlier, then it won't be here.  Note that you can
 wait and pick up the Red Huge Materia in Disc 3 if you'd rather not get
 it right now.

 Next, return to the Junon Town dock and go west until you reach a
 jutting peninsula (or go north from where the red submarine was,
 assuming you sunk it).  Go around the penninsula and head south until
 you reach land (you'll be in a little bay, near a dock, and you should
 be able to see the Golden Saucer from where you are).  Descend and
 you'll find a wrecked plane lying on the sea floor.  Touch it to board
 the sunken plane.

 Inside the plane, go down the ladder.  Run to the left to find a Save
 Point and a treasure chest (iniside is the Heaven's Cloud sword).
 Enter the northern door (the one with the Shinra emblem on it) and
 head east along the walkway.  There's a green chest here with an
 Escort Guard in it.  Go down the incline to the lowest level of this
 room and head to the upper-left corner.  Hidden by a pipe is another
 green chest; inside it is Yuffie's Ultimate Weapon, the Conformer
 (in English, it means 'Conformer').  Now to all the way to the
 upper-right corner and search the wall for a hard to see yellow materia
 (Continuous Slice).  Finally, return to the entrance and go north and
 then east across the beams.  This leads to the final chest which has a
 Mega Elixir inside of it.

 Return to the main room and go through the door on the left wall.  In
 the adjoining chamber are Reno and Rude of the Turks, who will talk
 to you briefly before attacking your party.

 Rude (the bald guy) can cast Ice 2 and Fire 2, while Reno will attack
 you with his Neo Turks' Light Ray attack.  They also have the nasty
 ability to confuse you, which can be a serious problem if the confused
 member has a Continuous Slice or Slice Everybody materia equipped.  Once
 you inflict enough damage on one of them, that person will leave.  If
 you kill Reno, then Rude will simply stand around until you lower his
 HP to zero.  Since this battle is tougher than it might seem, Haste
 your characters and use your best attacking and summon spells.  If he's
 learned it, Cloud's B3/1 should be used whenever possible.  You'll get
 an Elixir when the battle is concluded.
 _________________________________________________________________________

 With the Turks out of the way, go through the northern door.  A chest
 sitting near the entrance contains a Mega Elixir, and if you continue
 along the walkway and go all the way to the right, you'll find another
 chest with a Spirit Lance inside.  Go down the stairs to the lower area;
 near the bottom of the screen are two chests; one to the left and one
 to the right.  The left one has an Outsider gun in it, and the right
 one contains Cid's Level 4 Limit Break Manual (Highwind).  Before
 leaving, look by the wrecked helicopter for a shimmering red sphere
 (it's lying between the body of the helicopter and one of the broken,
 detached parts next to it).  It's the 'Summon Hades' materia, so pick
 it up and then head back to your submarine.  You don't need to return
 to the wrecked plane again, although you can fight the monsters here
 and transform them into various '-Up' items (you can also do this to
 several of the monsters in the Mideel Area).  Considering this game's
 difficulty (the lack of, that is), you shouldn't have to do this,
 though.

 Once you're in the submarine, look at your map.  Just south and east of
 the southeastern tip of the Northern Continent are three islands in a
 sort of a curving pattern.  If you can't quite tell where you are, just
 go along the coast of the Northern Continent until you reach an area
 surounded by shallows where there are three islands (you should be
 near snowy ground with patches of grass, in addition to a large
 mountain).  Submerge the submarine and look for an underwater tunnel
 around here (guide the submarine into the dead-end and turn around; you
 should see it as you're moving).  The short tunnel leads to a twisted,
 spikey object which you will take (it's called the Old x x no Key;
 Buugen Haagen asks you to find it later on when you return to the
 Ancient City in section 3l).

 Finally, get back in your airship and fly to Uutai on the Westernmost
 Continent.  Go up into the Dachao Statue area, and head along the path
 until you reach the path that heads north.  Follow it past the statue's
 head until you reach another crossroads with a cave entrance nearby.
 Enter the cave.  Try to walk into the first fire-pit twice and Cloud
 will use the Suishin x no Uroko on the Fires each time, exposing a
 green chest which contains a Oritsuru (a shuriken for Yuffie).  Explore
 the rest of the cave until you find a second fire-pit.  Press against
 it to douse it with the Suishin x no Uroko.  This allows you to take
 the blue materia lying on the floor (Steal as well).

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------

 ITEMS IN THIS AREA:  Nothing!

 Return to Rocket Town (it's beyond the mountains near the Gold Saucer).
 Go to the launch pad.  It's swarming with Shinra soldiers!  Make your
 way to the stairs leading up to the rocket and you'll be attacked by
 two soldiers.  Deal with them and you'll be attacked by another pair
 of soldiers.  At the top of the stairs, you'll fight two more soldiers
 and their captain.  After killing them, Cid will show up and insist on
 joining if he's not already with you.  After you've made a party, press
 X to continue playing, T to go to the Main Menu, or O to change your
 party's configuration (but Cloud and Cid cannot be removed from the
 current party).  After you choose to continue playing, climb up the
 ladder and you'll face off with two Shinra soldiers and Rude of the
 Turks.

 _________________________________________________________________________
 @{b}BOSS TIPS: Rude                                LV: 42  HP: 9000  MP: 240

 Use physical attacks to kill the soldiers and injure Rude, especially
 if you've got the Continuous Slice and Slice Everybody materia equipped.
 Rude can use a jumping wave attack, but it only causes about 500 points
 of damage.  He can also create a Mabarrier which he usually casts when
 one or both of the soldiers are killed, and he can cast Bolt 2 and heal
 himself for about 1100 hit points.  Despite all his powers, he's still
 easily beaten.  If you kill Rude before finishing off the guards, you'll
 automatically win the battle.  You may win an S-mine once you win the
 battle.
 _________________________________________________________________________

 Go inside the rocket ship--you'll have to fight another battle, but it's
 easily won.  Press O to open the northern door, then go into the main
 room, where Cid will talk to the workers.  After the rocket lifts off,
 go to the right into the next room and climb up the ladder.  Examine the
 Huge Materia in the next room and choose the top option.  Cid will chat
 with Cloud and several numbered boxes will appear.  When they do, punch
 in the following code, one press per message box:

 First Message (1):      O
 Second Message (2):     S
 Third Message (3):      X
 Fourth Message (4):     X

 If you did it correctly, the glass tube will open and you can take the
 Huge Materia.  If you mess up, you'll have 3 minutes to get the code
 right, and Cid will try to clue you in to the correct code.  Should the
 timer reach zero, the Huge Materia is lowered into the ground.

 Whether you got the Huge Materia or not, return to the entry room and
 climb down the ladder; when you get near the sparking tanks, they will
 explode.  With a little help from Shiera, you'll free Cid from under a
 piece of metal.  Follow Shiera into the next room (which turns out to
 be an escape capsule).  After a lengthy FMV sequence, you'll find
 yourself back in Highwind, and the Meteor hanging in the sky will now
 be much closer than it was before.  Alternately, you can do this part
 (see the tanks explode) and then go back and get/not get the Huge
 Materia, or you can even do this part and then take the escape pod
 without even attempting to free the Huge Materia (which means you
 obviously won't get it).

 ITEMS IN THIS AREA:  Ultima Weapon, Elixir x3, Mega Elixir, Aegis
                      Bracelet, Starlight Horn, Max Ray, Power Source x2,
                      Guard Source, Magic Source, Mind Source, W-Item
                      materia, Master Fist, Pile Banger, HP Shout,
                      Ragnarok, Missing Score.

 Get in the Highwind and return to Cosmo Canyon.  Make your way up to the
 observatory and talk to Buugen Haagen.  Cloud will use the PHS system to
 call the rest of his friends up to Buugen Haagen's home.  They'll all
 talk about Sephiroth and Aeris, and then leave Cloud alone with Buugen
 Haagen, who offers to keep the Huge Materia at his observatory for
 safekeeping.  Touch any of the Huge Materia you have and pick the
 bottom option to return to the Highwind.  Buugen Haagen will accompany
 you.  Pilot the Highwind back to the Northern Continent and land in the
 canyon where the Ancient City is located.  At the crossroads, take the
 left path and follow it into the chamber with the blue crystal that
 you couldn't do anything to earlier.  Head right along the upper path
 and take the stairs up to the crystal.  Buugen Haagen will talk to
 Cloud and his friends.  If you already got the Old x x no Key, Buugen
 Haagen uses it to create a waterfall.  If you didn't get it yet, he'll
 remain here in the Ancient City until you find it and return to him
 with it.

 Once the waterfall has been activated, walk towards the crystal a
 second time.  Pictures of Aeris will be shown in the falling water
 while Buugen talks to your party.  Now, leave the Ancient City.  As
 you do, Cait Sith calls on Cloud's phone and tells him that the Sister
 Ray in Junon Town has been re-installed in Midgar City, and that it's
 going to be used to destroy the barrier around the crater (where
 Sephiroth's at).  After seeing some more FMV, return to the Highwind.
 Just as you're about to board it, another Weapon monster shows up and
 starts advancing towards Midgar City.  Since you can't attack it while
 in the Highwind, and you can't reach it using the submarine, wait until
 it reaches dry land, then try and touch it in order to see another FMV
 sequence in which the Sister Ray is used to kill the Weapon and break
 the shield at the same time.

 At this point in the game, if you return to the lake near Junon Town,
 the Ultima Weapon will be hovering over the lake.  You can battle the
 Ultima Weapon by ramming into it while aboard the Highwind.  However,
 it will fly away after fighting with you for awhile.  From this point
 on, it will fly around the sky and make it's way to various random
 locations.  It might seem as if you could just wait around for the
 Ultima Weapon to show up here and there, but the beast will fly in
 circles unless you find it and ram into it repeatedly.  After 4 or 5
 tries, it will then head towards a new location and sit there until you
 attack again.  After escaping a few more times, it will make a final
 stop at Cosmo Canyon.  You can fight it to the death here (it's a
 pushover, so don't expect too much of a challenge), and when it dies,
 you get Cloud's Ultimate Weapon (the Ultima Weapon).  Furthermore,
 it will create a crater when it crashes into the ground, wiping out
 several of the rock formations around Cosmo Canyon.  However, you can
 now walk across the crater and go into the Old Forest!  Normally, you
 can't reach this place unless you're using a colored Chocobo.  If you
 don't want to fight the Ultima Weapon now, you still fight it during
 Disc 3.

 Anyway, pilot the Highwind back to the crater when you're ready.  Before
 you can explore it further, Reeve (y'know, the guy who controls Cait
 Sith) reveals that Hojo (one of the members of the Jenova Project) is
 planning to use the Sister Ray again, even though the results could be
 catastrophic considering how much energy it used up last time.  So you
 have to get back into Midgar City and stop Hojo beforehand.

 <KM's note -- Upon getting back in the Highwind, I talked to the pilot
 near Cid in order to take control of the airship.  He said something
 about the airship reaching it's "Level 14 Limit Break" and most of the
 text was flashing in rainbow colors (same effect as when you have the
 All 7 Fever).  Does anybody know why this happened?>

 When you're ready to raid Midgar City, fly the Highwind straight towards
 it, as if you were going to ram into it.  Cloud and his allies will
 gather together on the airship's deck.  You can now choose the top
 option to assemble a new party, or the bottom option to leap off the
 ship and parachute into the city.  When you can move, follow your
 friend to an alleyway where your pals are waiting.  There's also a Save
 Point here.  Talk to whoever is by the wooden panel and they'll open it
 to reveal a ladder leading down into the depths of Midgar City.  At the
 bottom of the ladder, go along the metal passage and down the slope.
 Go up the the next slope and when you reach the wall, head right to
 find a chest containing an Elixir, and then run to the left to find a
 chest with a Mega Elixir inside of it.

 Make your way back to the area with the ladder and take the stairs down
 to an area with a ladder.  If you climb down the ladder, you'll reach a
 long walkway; head east and then go north to arrive at another ladder.
 Climb up it and you'll have access to the green chest you saw earlier;
 it contains an Aegis Bracelet.  Climb back down to the long walkway and
 run to the right.  The floor will give way and you'll be deposited on a
 lower walkway.  Head left, jump on top of the pipe, and then ascend the
 ladder.  When you arrive at another ladder, climb up it, too.

 Eventually you'll arrive at a path just below the one you were walking
 around on earlier.  Walk along it until you reach a chute; walk into it
 and you'll be deposited in a new area.  Check out the green chest to the
 left (there's a Starlight Horn inside it).  Then go to the right and open
 the chest that's near the ladder (it contains an Elixir).  Climb down the
 ladder and press against the right lip of the platform in order to jump
 down to the chute labled '42'.  Enter the chute, and when you arrive at
 the other end, head left and then go up the ladder.  At the top, you'll
 find a chest to the left; there's a Max Ray inside it. Retrace your
 steps until you're back at the other area, press left to jump off the
 chute and back onto the platform, and then climb up the ladder and go
 up the stairs to your left (it's right next to the chute labled '12').

 At the top of the stairs is a Save Point.  To the right of it is a
 crawlway.  Make you way along it and you'll arrive in an underground
 tunnel system.  Climb down to the floor and head south.  While many of
 the passages here split off in two directions, one direction will always
 end in a blocked door, so keep going south.  As you keep going, you'll
 run into your friends (remember, who you meet up with depends on who is
 and isn't in your group).  After heading south for a couple of screens,
 you'll find a treasure chest lying against the left wall of one of those
 'split-passage' areas I mentioned earlier.  Inside it is a Power Source.
 At the next split-passage area that you come across, there is a treasure
 chest in the area between the doorways.  There's a Guard Source inside it.
 Keep going south, and when you reach the next split-passage area, there
 will be two chests lying in the area between the doorways.  The one to
 the left has a Magic Source inside it, and the one to the right contains
 a Mind Source. If you go south from here, you'll arrive at a dead end.
 In the left corner of this area is a Save Point, and in the right corner
 there is a yellow materia (W-Item).  If you press against the wall,
 you'll discover that you can't go any further.

 So, go all the way back to the first area (where the ladder was).  Try
 to head to the north and guess who shows up!  It's the remaining Turks,
 and they're here for a final showdown with Cloud and his friends.  I
 could swear that the first time I came through here, they asked if I
 wanted to fight or not...but I guess not, since nothing like that
 happened this time around.  Perhaps it has something to do with
 completing Yuffie's sub-quest before coming here?

 @{b}BOSS TIPS: Elena                                  (can't see her stats.)
            RENO                               LV: 50  HP: 25000  MP: 200
            Rude                               LV: 51  HP: 28000  MP: 250@{ub}

 Elena is healed by lightning attacks, Reno by ice attacks, and Rude
 by fire attacks.  Rude has a punch attack that hits one character for
 2000 points of damage, Elena can throw a firebomb that inflicts 500 to
 600 points of damage (in addition to a Amulet attack), and Reno uses a
 spark attack which will cause 800 HPs worth of damage.  They all have
 more attacks than these; but I'm listing the ones the seem to use most
 often.  Alone, they aren't much, but with all three of them fighting
 together, this becomes one of the toughest battles in game.  Barrier
 and Haste your allies, then use spells like Ultima and Tornado to soften
 the Turks up in addition to Limit Breaks.  Try to save Phoenix until you
 really need it, since it will revive your members but heal Rude.  All
 three Turks will escape once you've defeated them in battle.  You'll get
 an Elixir when the battle is over.
 _________________________________________________________________________

 After the battle, go north.  When you reach the split passage area, go
 north again.  If Cid isn't in your party, he'll show up here.  Take the
 right path and at the next split passage, take the left path.  You'll
 arrive at a blocked passage, but there's a ladder against the left wall
 that leads to the Shinra Building.  If Cait Sith is in your party,
 he'll talk to you.  Otherwise, you'll see him hop out of the building.
 If you didn't read Kamedouraku Flyer No. 2 the first time around, you
 can check out the billboard at the back end of the first floor to read
 it now.  Go up the stairs near the front and look for a door marked
 'Accessories' near the other end of this floor.  In the adjoining room,
 you can open two chests that a Shinra employee wouldn't let you
 examine eaarlier.  The one to the right contains a Master Fist and the
 left one has a Pile Banger inside of it.  Before leaving, go up to the
 64th floor and look for the lockers (go north from the elevators).  If
 you examine the left end of the row of lockers against the wall, you'll
 find the HP Shout (Cait Sith's Ultimate Weapon that you couldn't
 take earlier).

 Return to the underground passages again.  Go south past one split-
 passage room, and when you reach the second room, take the left path.
 You'll go outside.  Walk towards the lefthand red beam to climb up it
 and jump onto the main street.  Head north and a huge mechanical monster
 will appear from behind you; it's being controlled by Heidegger and
 Scarlet.  After laughing in your face, they'll attack you.

 _________________________________________________________________________
 @{b}BOSS TIPS: PURAUDO KURADDO  <Proud Cloud>         (can't see it's stats.)
            JAMAAAAAMAA  <Jammer Armor>         LV: 62  HP: 20000  MP: 300@{ub}

 This mechanical monstrosity has two parts; a head and a chest area that
 you can aim your attacks at.  The boss can only cause around 500-800
 points of damage, but it can kneel and fire a ray from it's back (the
 Beam Cannon attack) that causes 1100 damage to all members.  Even after
 disabling the Jammer Armor (it can use it's Materia Jammer attack to
 disable your Materia), you'll still have to keep attacking the main part
 if you want to kill it.  Spells and summonings work nicely, and you
 shouldn't worry about your HP until the boss kneels and readies it's
 laser attack.  You'll get the Ragnarok sword once the fight is over.
 _________________________________________________________________________

 Once the machine explodes, it starts to rain.  Head north.  There are
 two chests near the entrance.  The one closest to you has an Elixir in
 it, while the one that's further away contains a Mystile.  Use the
 Save Point that's nearby if you want to, then climb up the ladders.
 If he's not in your party, Vincent will be on the lower landing.  The
 second landing is normally empty, but if Barret is in your party, you
 will see a green chest there.  Open it to get Barret's Ultimate Weapon,
 the Missing Score.  If Barret's not in you party, you won't find anything
 on the landing, even if you search it thoroughly.  Once you've climbed
 all the way to the top, run to the right.  Sitting at the Mako Cannon's
 (Sister Ray's) controls is Hojo, who will attack your party when you
 talk to him.

 _________________________________________________________________________
 @{b}BOSS TIPS: Hojo                                LV: 50  HP: 13000  MP: 250
            PUDUREA SANPURU  <Pudurea Sample>   LV: 42  HP: 10000  MP: 200
            IBIRURAPPU SANPURU  <Ibirurappu S>  LV: 34  HP: 11000  MP: 120
            HERETIKKU Hojo  <Heretic Hojo>      LV: 55  HP: 26000  MP: 200
            MIGUIDE  <Right Arm>                LV: 55  HP:  5000  MP: 300
            SAUDE  <Left Arm>                   LV: 55  HP: 24000  MP: 400
            xxxxx Hojo NA  <Hojo NA>            (can't see his stats.)@{ub}

 Hojo can use his 'Capsule' power to summon the two 'Sample' monsters
 every time you kill them.  So, concentrate on defeating Hojo instead of
 the lesser monsters.  He'll then reappear as a huge monster with two
 independant arms (Heretic Hojo).  Since Hojo can bring the arms back
 to life, aim your attacks at the main body of the boss.  He may cast
 Confuse or Silence on you, so I hope you have some Ribbons equipped.
 The right arm will also inflict a lot of damage, so cast Barrier
 beforehand.  In his final form, Hojo can cast Slow and employ a
 multiple-hit attack (Combo), which will poison whoever is hit by it.
 As long as you keep your HPs up, this battle is a cinch.  You'll receive
 a Power Source once you've killed Hojo.
 _________________________________________________________________________

 You'll return to the Highwind after killing the boss.  There's a short
 sequence with Tifa and Cloud afterward, then the Highwind blasts off
 into the sky.  Well, that's the end of this disc!  My time...17:25 the
 first time around, and 14:24 for the rewrite.

                     All materia, Luck Source

 You'll start off on the deck of the Highwind.  If you'd rather explore
 the World Map instead, just go back to the cockpit, talk to the engineer
 next to Cid, and choose the top option.  If you haven't noticed it yet,
 the Highwind is now rocket-powered.

 Before descending into the crater and exploring the Makou Pit, you may
 want to pick up Red 13's Ultimate Weapon.  Return to Cosmo Canyon and
 climb up to the second floor of the observatory, making sure that Red 13
 is in your group beforehand (you can switch characters at the Save Point
 near the Tiger Lily Arms Shop if you need to).  Buugen Haagen is lying
 on his couch, and he is about to pass away.  He chats with Red 13 for a
 while, then dies.  Back at the bonfire, Red 13 rejoins his companions,
 and now has the Limited Moon in his inventory.  Also, if you haven't
 gotten either of the 'optional' characters yet (Yuffie or Vincent), then
 now would be a good time to add them to your party.

 When you're ready to explore the Makou Pit, land the Highwind and go
 out to the deck.  You can talk to the man out here to change party
 members (he'll automatically ask you every time you return to the
 Highwind).  Climb down the rope ladder to reach a new area, then head
 southwest.  In the next screen you'll be given an option: pick the
 bottom one to turn back or the top one to descend into the pit.  After
 hopping down the steps, you'll see a cavern entrance.  If you go inside
 it, it merely returns you to the last area, in which you can climb up
 the stone column and make your way back to the Highwind.  Otherwise,
 simply follow the path as it winds it's way down into the ground.  Don't
 worry should the ground crumble away since you can jump over the gaps.
 The first chest you find contains a Save Crystal.  It can be used once
 while in the Makou Pit to create a Save Point.  Considering that there
 are no Save Points at all in this level, the Save Crystal is a handy
 item to have.  The next chest you find has a Guard Source in it.

 In the next area, you can climb the silver parts of the ledges by
 pressing O when you are standing near them (a message appears prompting
 you to do this).  Go to the right and hop down the 'steps'.  The first
 chest you find has a Guard Source inside of it.  Be sure to make your way
 to the next chest and not explore the edge of the ledge below the chest
 you just opened or you'll jump down to the bottom and will have to
 climb all the way back up again (although you'll be doing that at some
 point anyway, so it's no big deal).  In the second chest is a Mind Source.
 You can now either climb back up and get the rest of the chests, or
 continue searching the Makou Pit and get the chests when you are coming
 back out (assuming you want to make more than one journey into the Pit).
 To get the chests, climb up the ledge to your left (you're at the
 bottom of the screen, remember?)  Go all the way to the left and climb
 up two ledges, then walk to the right to find another chest containing
 a Magic Source.  Go left again, go up to the next ledge, then go to the
 right and climb up again.  Walk all the way to the right, climb up the
 tall ledge, then head left to find a chest holding an Elixir.  From
 there, walk up to the next ledge, go to the left, and climb up the
 silver part to arrive at a chest that has a Power Source in it.  If you go
 to the right, you'll find an HP Absorb materia just past a large rock.
 Finally, jump back down, go to the right, and climb up the ledge to
 reach the top again (you can jump to the top ledge from here and exit
 the Pit by going back up the spiraling passage).

 If you head south from the bottom of the screen, you'll arrive at a large
 chamber pocked with holes.  Walk to the right until you fall down a
 level, then go left to uncover a chest (inside is a Mind Source).  Go to
 the edge of this ledge, turn around, and press O to juMP Plus to the upper
 ledge (just like in the last area, you'll be prompted to jump whenever
 you are near a ledge ending).  Head left until you fall down, then go to
 the right and step into the hole by pressing up.  Beyond the opening is a
 treasure chest containing a Mega Elixir.  Go back out again and walk all
 the way to the left and you will fall down to a new level (since you
 can't see Cloud, move left or right until he falls).  Run to the right in
 order to find a chest, which has an Hero Drink inside of it.  Walk
 to the left and enter the hole.  As you walk along the adjoining path,
 stop to open a treasure chest to your left which holds a Guard Source, and
 go through the hole that's a little farther up to reach a chest with a
 Power Source inside it.  Go back out the hole and keep climbing to reach
 an opening that deposits you back at the top of the screen.  To get back
 down to the bottom, run to the right until you drop down, press right
 again to fall a second time, and enter the hole.  The passage beyond it
 leads to another hole; press left to fall down it (if you want to get
 back up, just climb the ledges to your left).  Then walk to the left
 until you fall, and walk right to fall again.

 Here, climb down the two stalagtites in order to reach the ground where
 your friends are waiting.  Each one asks you which path they should take,
 the left one (top option), or the right one (bottom option).
 Furthermore, you may have certain characters join you, or you may be
 asked to make a new group (and you may not have many characters to pick
 from).  Unfortunately, I really have no clue as to how this part of the
 game works even after playing through it numerous times.  (Yes, that
 means that you should still treat this whole paragraph as a NSS :))

 Take whatever path is available to you (you'll get a message if you can't
 go in that direction).  Refer to the LEFT PATH or RIGHT PATH sections
 depending on which one is available to you.  Note that once you reach the
 PLACE OF GATHERING, you can go back and explore all the areas freely
 (remember that because you may be approaching an area from a different
 location, you may have to do it in a different order.  For instance, you
 can tackle the LEFT PATH: LOWER ROUTE area from either the top or bottom,
 so take note while playing (and no, I'm not going to write out the
 section backwards and forwards, just figure it out yourself depending on
 where you're going!)

 RIGHT PATH
 You'll find yourself on a column of stone.  Follow the winding path that
 leads along the column.  Eventually, you'll reach a gap in the path.
 Pick the top option to jump down to the area below, or the bottom option
 to turn back.  When you land on the ground, look to your right for a
 chest containing a Mystile.  To your left is a green Elixir.  Take it
 and continue along the path until you reach a broad, gray area.  Here,
 there is a treasure chest to the north containing a Speed Source.  If you
 look to the south, wedged between several broken structures is another
 chest that has a Tetra Elemental inside it.  Go back to the main path
 and head east, then north.  Here, the path splits to the north or the
 west.

 Take the west branch and it'll lead to a dead-end where there is a chest.
 Iniside it is a Mega Elixir.  Retrace your steps and keep going north;
 just to your right will be a chest that also has a Mega Elixir inside of
 it.  If you keep going north, you'll arrive at a bridge made of curving
 bones.  Work your way down it and you'll arrive at the PLACE OF GATHERING
 (see below).

 LEFT PATH
 In this room, your teammates will each ask if you should take the upper
 (top option) or lower (bottom option) route.  Pick accordingly, and refer
 to the UPPER ROUTE and LOWER ROUTE sub-sections depending on what you
 chose.  You may be prompted to make a new party yet again after you have
 decided on the route you will take.

 LEFT PATH: UPPER ROUTE
 Hop down onto the branch-like structure, run to the right, and when you
 can't go any further, press Up to jump to another branch.  From here, go
 right to reach a chest containing a Magic Source.  Now, hop back to the
 first branch and go left, then north.  When you reach the edge, Cloud
 will jump onto the nearby rocks.  Walk north along the path and Cloud
 will dive in the water and jump out on the other side of the screen.  If
 you walk to the left, then go north, you'll arrive at a chest which has
 an Remedy within it.  Head right, but take the upper branch
 (go east, then north) in order to arrive at a new area.

 Here, head to the far right to find a chest which contains an Ei x no
 Kusuri.  Then take the upper path and run all he way to the left.  If
 you go a little ways to the north, you'll see a chest; it has a Vaccine
 in it.  To the right of the chest is a large rock; walk in front of it
 and you'll see a path that leads up to the top of the rock, where a
 green materia is lying on the ground (Shield).  Take it and walk to
 the left, then press Down to descend the rock face.  Cloud will jump
 into the water and pop out again near a treasure chest (Imperial Guard).
 After opening the chest, keep pressing Down and Cloud will dive into the
 water again and end up on the other side of the screen.  From here, run
 south and then east to reach yet another unexplored area.

 This area is full of green shrubbery and stone tiers.  Walk to the left
 in order to work your way down the tiers, but then go to the center of
 the screen and walk north until you're right beneath the shrubbery.
 There is a small dot here; press O to examine it and you'll find that
 it's the W-Magic materia.  From here, work your way down to the
 shining light (go south, then east).  There is a patch of darkness in
 the light--examine it and you'll get the Counter Attack materia.  Now,
 walk west and then north to find a cave entrance.  It leads to the
 PLACE OF GATHERING (see below).

 LEFT PATH: LOWER ROUTE
 Hop down the stone columns and investigate the chest to your left to
 find an Remedy.  Head to the right and hop up the stone
 columns to arrive at a chest that has an Elixir inside of it.  Then
 go back to the first treasure chest and press against the bottom of
 the ledge.  You'll hop down to a column where there is a chest
 containing an X Potion.  Make your way to the southeast.  In the next
 screen, hop down the stone columns and then go to the left to find a
 chest with an Turbo Ether in it.  Then follow the path east and north.
 There's another chest here and a Vaccine is inside it.  Walk to the
 west, then follow the path south and hop across the columns.  When you
 reach the bottom of the screen, run to the south.

 In this area, go to the right and press down to hop down to a small
 ledge.  Below is a larger ledge and a green chest (X Potion).  Walk to
 the left across the thin stone bridge, drop down a level, then keep
 going right until you see some stone 'steps'.  Go down them; to the
 left is a green chest containing a Turbo Ether.  If you walk to the
 left, you'll jump down to a low ledge.  Nearby, there is a ball
 floating in the air.  Hold Up in order to jump from a small ledge to a
 larger ledge, and when you get near the ball, tap O repeatedly.  If you
 timed it right, you'll be able to take the ball, which is actually the
 Mega All materia.  If you missed it, just press left to
 jump back down to the lower ledge and then try again.  You can only get
 the materia while jumping to the small ledge, not while jumping from
 the large western ledge.

 Once you've gotten the materia and are on the large ledge, walk to the
 other end of it.  There's a chest here (Speed Plus Source).  Now walk to
 the south and press against the edge to jump down to a lower area.  Keep
 walking south and you'll reach the PLACE OF GATHERING.

 PLACE OF GATHERING
 On the right side of this chamber is a chest containing a Luck Source.
 Follow the path as it curves around until you reach a set of stone
 steps.  Your friends will show up here.  Depending on where you told
 them to go earlier, they may or may not have items to give you.  Talk
 to each one of them to get an item (or not), then approach the stone
 steps.  Pick the top option to go down them or the bottom option to
 stay where you are.  Once you pick the top option, you can't go back,
 so feel free to choose the bottom option and then leave this area from
 the upper ledge (walk to the left) if you have more exploring to do.

 Once you've chosen the top option, assemble a new group.  You'll leap
 down the steps and arrive at the lowest levels of the Makou Pit (home
 not only to Jenova and Sephiroth but also to massive slowdown).  Simply
 jump from floating ledge to floating ledge, working your way towards
 the bottom of the screen.  In the second screen, make your way to the
 central island of rock, where the final form of Jenova will appear and
 attack you.

 _________________________________________________________________________
 @{b}BOSS TIPS: JENOBA*SYNTHESIS  <Jenova Synthesis>    (can't see her stats.)
            JENOBA*SYNTHESIS B  <Jenova S. B>   LV: 61  HP: 10000  MP: 600
            JENOBA*SYNTHESIS C  <Jenova S. C>   LV: 61  HP: 8000   MP: 600@{ub}

 Start the round by using Haste and Barrier on yourselves, then use Enemy
 Skills and Summon Materia to dish out damage.  The tentacle-like arms
 will droop and become useless after you've attacked them long enough,
 but they regenerate with some HP if you don't kill the boss quickly, so
 use high-level spells (Ultima or Inseki) to take them out and injure
 Jenova at the same time.  When she is about to die, a message appears
 and starts counting down the rounds from 5; if you don't kill her by the
 time it reaches zero, Jenova Synthesis will cast Ultima.  For the second-
 to-last boss, this is an easy battle. She has very weak physical attacks
 (500-800 damage), and not much else. If you want to conserve MP, you can
 take out the boss using physical attacks with little injury to yourself.
 If she does cast Ultima, the battle ends, but you get no EXP, GP, or AP,
 so try to kill her as quickly as possible.
 _________________________________________________________________________

 After the death of Jenova Synthesis, the ground will break up and Cloud
 and his friends will awaken to find themselves floating in space.
 Sephiroth makes his final appearance here, floating next to the core of
 the Makou Pit.  You'll get to make a new party*, then the battle with
 Sephiroth will commence.

 * Apparently, the number of teams you can make is determined randomly.
   The first time I played this game, I was able to make two parties,
   but since then I've been able to make just one party or three parties
   (the third had only two members, since you only have 8 characters).
   For a time, I thought this was based on the paths you took when you
   talked to your friends at various locations in the Makou Pit, but I
   guess it is simply a random occurence after all.

 _________________________________________________________________________
 @{b}BOSS TIPS: RIBAASU SEFIROSU  <Reverse Sephiroth>   (can't see it's stats)
            RIBAASU SEFIROSU B                  LV: 61  HP: 2000   MP: 400
            RIBAASU SEFIROSU C                  LV: 61  HP: 10000  MP: 400
            RIBAASU SEFIROSU D                  LV: 61  HP: 4000   MP: 400
            RIBAASU SEFIROSU E                  LV: 61  HP: 4000   MP: 400@{ub}

 Use Wall and Haste on yourselves (maybe even Regen), then use your best
 attacks against Sephiroth, like Coin Toss, Ultima, and summon spells.
 Every time you kill a few of of it's body parts, you'll be asked if you
 want to switch to another team (left option to switch, right option to
 keep using the current party).  In this case (if you have more than one
 team), you'll find that only one team can damage the yellow orb (part C)
 of Sephiroth's body.  Once part C is sufficiently damaged, you'll get a
 message stating that Cloud can now attack part C as well, so switch back
 to him and attack Sephiroth.  Once part C is destroyed, kill off the
 rest of the body parts.  If you only have one team, all you can do is
 attack.  The number of teams you have will affect the strategy used
 against this boss, so keep that in mind when attacking*.  I'm not exactly
 sure about this, but: Sephiroth will gain more HP and MP in proportion
 to Cloud's experience level, and using the Knights of Round materia
 will _usually_ kill Sephiroth.  If you more than one team, keep in mind
 that the battle will end if even one team is killed.  And interestingly
 enough, the number of times you've used a summon materia resets when you
 switch to a team and back.

 Sephiroth can heal himself using a technique called Reverse Energy, and
 he can use it to bring defeat body parts back to life.  Among his attacks
 are Graviga, an explosion attack that causes 1500+ points of damage, a
 fire ray emitted from his chest that inflicts 1700+ damage, and a 'Fallen
 Angel'-type attack that reduces all party members' HP to one point.

 * I'm saying this because one time I was able to kill Reverse Sephiroth
   before receiving the message to attack part C.
 _________________________________________________________________________

 Once Reverse Sephiroth has been defeated, Sephiroth shows up in a new
 form.  You always fight him using the team that Cloud is a part of.

 _________________________________________________________________________
 @{b}BOSS TIPS: SEEFA SEFIROSU  <Seraph Sephiroth>      (can't see his stats.)@{ub}

 Looks like Square couldn't bother creating a new end boss, could they?
 Seraph Sephiroth can cast Slow, Flare, Break, Doom, and Dispel (Dispel
 will affect all members).  Other attacks include Shotgunnova (a 'summon'
 style spell that inflicts 1100-2200 damage to all allies; it causes
 confusion and silence), Pyro Holes (a laser attack causing 3700-3800
 damage), and Dein (ring-shaped flares break apart the ground and cause
 1200-1300 damage to all members.  His sole physical attack is a wing
 slash that causes upwards of 5000 damage points.  Sephiroth can fly
 around, too, preventing some characters from using certain skills or
 attacks against him.

 Use Wall on yourself, and then heal, revive, and fix status ailments
 with the Angel's Whisper Enemy Skill.  Haste yourselves and use physical
 attacks, your best summon materia, and Ultima.  You can even use Coin
 Toss or Throw if you want.  Seraph Sephiroth isn't easy to kill, but
 he's certainly no challenge, even if you have low levels.  There's only
 one thing to watch out for: if Cloud's level is at 98-99, then Sephiroth
 becomes monsterously powerful and much harder to kill.
 _________________________________________________________________________

 After a brief automated sequence, Cloud fights Sephiroth one last time.
 I'll leave this up to you...I doubt you'll lose!  My time was 6:20 the
 first time around, and 1:30 for the rewrite.

 You can only go to these areas in Disc 2 or 3.  There's some information
 on these bonus areas in the 'Secrets and Strategies' section, too.


 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
   @{b}6 . 1      o l d   f o r e s t   ( c o s m o   a r e a )@{ub}
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Location:          On a cliff near Cosmo Canyon on the Western Continent.
 How to get there:  Use a Green, Black, or Gold Chocobo.  Or, climb past
                    the crater that's left behind when you kill the
                    Ultima Weapon in Disc 3--it destroys part of the
                    cliff.
 Items to get:      Supershot ST, Spring Gun Clip, Slice Everybody
                    materia, Summon Typoon materia, Apocalypse sword,
                    Elixir.

 You can grab items (frogs, big frogs, wasp nests, etc.) by pressing the
 O button.  When you grab a frog for the first time, you get a message
 informing you that if you press the S button, the _entire_ area will
 reset, returning all the items to their proper place.  However, it also
 returns you to the very start of the area, no matter how many screens
 you've worked your way through.  If you mess up on an area (you run
 out of frogs to use for transportation), you can cheat by leaving the
 area and returning (if it's possible to leave given your current
 location).  But if you're really stuck, you have no choice but to reset
 the whole level by pressing S.  You will keep all items and materia orbs
 you've collected so far, though.  Also, when you hear a frog croaking,
 look for a place where you can let go of a small frog you might be
 carrying as it'll be replaced with a big frog.

 In the first area, pick up three frogs and go beneath the earth bridge.
 Put them near the three bags hanging from the trees.  Now, quickly take
 the frogs and press the O button to make them hop into the bags; repeat
 this until all three bags are full by standing on a bag and pressing O
 to put a frog into the next bag.  When they're all full, hop to the
 other side of the gap.  Once on the other side, go down the slope and
 _carefully_ inch towards the center of the large snapping plant.  Press
 O to grab the bag (which contains the Supershot ST gun).  If you get too
 close, the plant will close and you'll lose almost all your HP.  You can
 make as many attempts as you want, but it's best to try and not touch
 the center of the plant in the first place.  Continue to the right when
 you're finished here and Cloud will automatically use the pink vine to
 reach the other side.  Go past the tree and nab the item bag on the hill
 (there's a Spring Gun Clip inside), and head right to reach the next part
 of the forest.

 In the second area, pick up one frog and approach the pink vine.  Choose
 the top option to leap to the ledge.  If you leave the frog on the ledge,
 it'll be switched with a big frog (or you can just use your small frog).
 From here, you can put the frog in the bag and leap across to the second
 (already-full) bag.  You'll automatically use the pink vine to jump to
 the ground.  Now, pick up a frog and climb on top of the green ledge to
 your right; let it go  and it will leap into the left bag.  If you wait
 long enough, you'll be sent flying to the ledge above when the frog
 escapes (you have to use a big one).  Once on the ledge, take the wasp
 nest.  Jump back down.  Stand near the small snapping plant and press O
 to release the nest; if you're at the right distance, the nest will fly
 backward and land in the plant, which will snap it up.  Take the yellow
 materia (Slice Everybody).  Pick up the big frog again.  Climb to the
 green ledge one more time and let the frog jump into the right bag.  Jump
 atop it and wait until you are thrust onto the opposite side of the huge
 snapping plant.  Run to the right to reach the next zone.

 In the third area, pick up two frogs, toss them into the bags, and leap
 across to the pink vine.  You'll be lifted into the treetops.  Go left,
 then down the trunk to reach the big bag you saw back in the second area.
 A Minerva Band is inside.  If you go too far down the trunk, you'll jump
 down to the ground, so return to the treetops after grabbing the bag.  If
 for some reason you can't, just hop back down repeat the last few steps
 to get across the plant, get into the next screen, and return to the
 treetops.

 Once you're back in the trees, climb to the upmost branch and head right,
 then make your way towards the broken branch; Cloud will vault across
 three of the pink vines and land on another branch.  Go south to get yet
 another item bag holding a red materia (Summon Typoon).  Now, go back
 across the vines, and take the lower branch that leads behind the leaves
 to the ground level (look for a path leading right).  Once on the ground,
 grab a frog.  There are two bags to your right; look for a high ledge
 beneath them, stand on it, and toss the frog into the bag.  Then, hop
 onto it and make your way over to the second bag, then to the ledge with
 the wasp's nest.  Take it and drop to the ground, then approach the
 snapping plant and press O to release the nest.  If you are positioned
 correctly, you'll toss the nest into the plant, which will close up.

 Pick up a small frog and move past the plant.  Stand on the left ledge,
 and let go of the frog; it will jump into the nearby bag.  Hop across
 the bag and onto the ground.  Run to the left and grab a frog.  Put it
 in the hollow in the tree next to you and a big frog will jump out.
 Take it and go back the way you came (put the big frog in the bag, jump
 to the other side, and wait for it to land by your feet).  Grab it
 again, go to the far right ledge, and release it into the bag.  Now,
 stand on the bag and wait for the frog to escape.  Doing this sends you
 flying across the gap to a cave entrance.

 In the cave, walk to the right to find a chest with the Apocalypse sword
 lying within.  Head to the north, then go east to find another chest
 (there's an Elixir in it).  Finally, exit through the opening to your
 left.  You're back outside!  Yup, there are no bosses to fight in this
 area (which is a good thing in case you had a hard time dealing with the
 snapping plants).

 Location:          Waterfall in the center of the Western Continent.
 How to get there:  Use a Green, Black, or Gold Chocobo to go to the
                    west side of the waterfall by the lake.  Dismount
                    and touch the waterfall to enter it.  Alternately,
                    you can go there in submarine--you can dock on
                    the dark-colored western side of the shore.
 Items to get:      Death Penalty, Chaos Manual (in Disc 3, see below).

 Beyond the waterfall is a room made of white stone.  If Vincent isn't
 in your party, then you'll get a message stating his name when you
 step past the threshold of the room.  So, return with Vincent.  This
 time, there's a woman there (Rukuressia), and you'll get to see a
 flashback of Vincent's past.  While you don't get anything out of this
 if you visit during the third disc, you can get Vincent's best weapon
 and his Level 4 Limit Break Manual if you come here with him in your
 party during the second disc and then visit the waterfall again in the
 third disc.  Refer to the 'Ultimate Weapons' section in part two of the
 FAQ for more information on this area.

 Location:          Cave lying to the east of a mountain in the bridge-
                    covered region of the Westernmost Continent.
 How to get there:  Use a Green, Black, or Gold Chocobo to climb over
                    the mountain.  Dismount and enter the cave.
 Items to get:      Mime materia.

 There's nothing in here but a glowing yellow light.  Try to touch it,
 and you'll get a yellow materia (Mime).  Notice how there's still
 a glow after you've taken the Materia? :)

 WESTERN CAVE       (North Norel Area)

 Location:          Cave next to a mountain lying on a square of brown
                    land.  There's a river running nearby.  It's
                    beyond the mountain footpath by the shallow part
                    of the river near the Gold Saucer, on the Western
                    Continent--there's another cave entrance by the
                    river you need to cross.
 How to get there:  Use a Blue, Black, or Gold Chocobo to cross the
                    river to the patch of land where the cave is.
 Items to get:      HP<->MP materia.

 Inside this icy blue cave is a twinkling purple materia (HP<->MP).

 SOUTHERNMOST CAVE  (Mideel Area)

 Location:          Cave lying at the end of a penninsula on the north
                    stretch of land on the Southernmost Continent.

 How to get there:  If you have a Blue Chocobo, land the Highwind on the
                    patch of grass on the thin island near Mideel.  Then
                    use the shallows connecting the penninsulas to reach
                    the area where the cave is.  If you have a Black or
                    Gold Chocobo, simply land on the grassy area near the
                    cave and keep walking down the cliff and out to where
                    the cave entrance is.  If you have the Gold Chocobo,
                    you can just walk southeast from the Chocobo Farm
                    across the water to the penninsula where the cave is.
 Items to get:      Quadra Magic materia.

 This sandy cave is empty, save for a blue pyramid-shaped object.  If you
 examine it, you'll get a blue materia (Quadra Magic).

 _________________________________________________________________________
 NORTHWEST ISLAND  (Round Island)

 Location:          Oval-shaped island surrounded by mountains and trees
                    that is in the northwestern part of the world.  It
                    is one of the Uncharted Isles (it doesn't show up on
                    the map).
 How to get there:  Use a Gold Chocobo to fly to the island and climb
                    over the mountains.  Dismount and enter the cave
                    mouth that's at the edge of the forest.
 Items to get:      Summon Knights of Round materia.

 This may be another empty area, but the red pyramid lying by the tree

@node 64 "Yuffie's Sub-Quest"

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
   @{b}6 . 4      y u f f i e ' s   s u b - q u e s t@{ub}
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Location:          Town of Wutai.  You can go here in Disc 1 after
                    you get the Tiny Bronco, or you can do this in Disc 2,
                    once you have the Highwind or a colored Chocobo.  You
                    CANNOT do this in Disc 3, however.
 How to get there:  Go to the southern end of the Westernmost Continent
                    using the Tiny Bronco, Highwind, a Chocobo, or a
                    Chocobo + the Highwind.  You MUST have gotten Yuffie
                    (though she doesn't have to be in the current party)
                    in order to perform this sub-quest.
 Items to get:      Hairpin, Fuuma Shuriken, MP Absorb materia, Fast
                    Lightning, Elixir x2, Peace Ring, HP Absorb materia,
                    X Potion, Turbo Ether, Ice Ring, Universe Manual,
                    'Summon Leviathan' materia.

 After arriving at the soutern tip of the Westernmost Continent, head
 north.  There is a curving path that leads up to a high plateau.  As
 you go along the curve (even if you are riding a Chocobo) you will be
 interrupted by Yuffie.  The screen switches to that of a plain, and
 Yuffie runs up, steals your Materia*, and escapes, but not before
 leaving you with two Shinra guards to contend with!  The guards are
 easily beaten, though.  If Yuffie was in your party when she tricked
 you, you'll have to fight the guards only using two people (in which
 case Barret will join the party afterwards, and if he's already in
 your party, then whoever isn't being used will join.  Keep in mind that
 you can rearrange the party in whatever way you'd like afterwards).

 * She can take 48-50 Materia (the number varies), and will steal them
   in this order of preference: Master Materia, Summon Materia,
   Independant Materia, Command Materia, Combination Materia and then
   Magic Materia.  This means that it is possible to be left with a few
   materia after she has escaped.  Note that if you're using the Materia
   Select Game Shark code and you have disabled Materia equipped/in your
   inventory, she'll steal them and you _won't_ get them back.

 At this point, your characters will refuse to board the vehicle you
 used to get here (Highwind, Tiny Bronco, or Chocobo), insisting that
 they find Yuffie instead.  If you were on a Chocobo when Yuffie stole
 your Materia, then you'll still be on it when the sequence ends, but
 you won't be able to board the Highwind, and if you get off the Chocobo,
 you can't get back on.  If you use the 'Start with Gold Chocobo' code,
 then you can leave the island, but I don't know what happens if you do
 this sub-quest while riding a real Gold Chocobo.  In any case, you can
 use the Chocobo to cheat and simply ride all the way to Wutai, Yuffie's
 hometown.  If you're not on a Chocobo, you'll have to walk.

 From the curving path, head north until you cross a bridge, then go west
 across a second bridge.  Head southeast once you reach the other side;
 this leads to a north-bound path that runs under the bridge.  Follow it
 and it will lead up to another bridge.  Past the bridge, the land
 becomes flat and grassy.  Keep heading north and you'll arrive at Wutai.

 When you enter the town, Yuffie will see you and run away.  Head to the
 upper-left corner of town.  There's a path here that leads to a large
 courtyard and a pagoda.  Enter the building to your right and walk along
 the hall until you arrive at a room with a man sleeping inside.  Enter
 it and talk to the man.  He is Godoo, Yuffie's father.  Keep talking to
 him until he stands up, at which point Yuffie will appear and then be
 chased away by her father.  If you follow Yuffie, you'll find that she
 has disappeared.  Before leaving this area, enter the room next to
 Godoo's and examine the right wall.  There is a hidden panel here that
 will open, revealing a passage.  At the end of the passage is a chest
 containing the Hairpin (a weapon for Red 13).  On your way out, go into
 the room to the left of the entrance.  You can come here and spend the
 night for free, but if you examine the scroll on the left wall, it will
 lift up, revealing another passage.  The chest at the end of this
 passage has a Fuuma Shuriken (Wind Demon Throwing Star) inside it.

 Return to town and go into the eatery in the southwest corner of town.
 The Turks are her!  Talk to them all (Elena, Rude, and Reno).  When
 you are finished, go to the Item Shop.  Normally, there is a woman
 standing in front of a treasure chest (preventing you from getting at
 it) but now she will have moved away.  Open the chest and you'll get
 a MP Absorb materia, but Yuffie will drop down from the ceiling and
 swipe it from your hands!  Leave the shop and go to the southeast
 edge of town.  There's a building here near the entrace.  Go inside
 and examine the folding panel to the left.  Hiding behind it is Yuffie,
 who dashes away as soon as she is discovered.  Chase her outside and
 go to the eatery.  If you look at the jar standing outside the eatery,
 you'll see that it is moving.  Approach it and press O to make your
 friends block all the exits.  Then press O three times to make your
 main character hit the jar until Yuffie jumps out.  Seeing that she
 can't escape, she'll lead your characters to her house.

 Meanwhile, two Shinra soldiers run into the eatery to meet with the
 Turks.  After Elena leaves, you'll find your characters in Yuffie's
 house.  When she goes downstairs, follow her.  I was sure that I
 found an item in this room once, but I guess I was mistaken...anyway,
 don't miss the Kamedouraku Flyer that's on the far wall when you go
 downstairs.  Talk to Yuffie.  When you can move again, examine the
 levers in the back room; you can pull the right lever or the left one.
 It doesn't matter which one you choose, since either one will make
 a cage drop on top of your allies!  Yes, Yuffie has tricked you again.
 Examine either lever a second time to free your friends, then leave
 the house.

 Return to the courtyard area where the pagoda is and you'll see that
 you can now enter the building to your left.  Climb up the steps and
 examine the bell to ring it; this will reveal a hidden door.  Beyond
 the door, you'll find Yuffie, who has been taken hostage by none other
 than Don Corneo, the mohawked pervert that tricked you back in the
 Wall Market.  He has captured Elena as well.  Before chasing after
 him, open the chest to your right to find a Swift Bolt, and open
 the chest to your left to get an Elixir.  Go up the stairs and you'll
 find yourselves in the altar room back in Godoo's house.  Three Shinra
 soldiers appear and attack you, allowing Corneo to escape.  Kill the
 guards (they're the same as the ones that attacked you back on the
 curving path), then go outside.

 Here, you'll run into Rude and Reno.  Talk to them, then return to town
 and head to the northeastern corner of Wutai.  There's a path here that
 leads up into the mountains, where huge Dachao statues have been carved
 into the rock.  Talk to the Turks again as you follow the path, and keep
 going along the path until it splits.  Take the path that goes north.
 It leads past a huge head to a crossroads.  Rude is standing here,
 blocking the entrace to a cave.  If you talk to him, he'll enter the
 cave.  Go inside and open the chest in here to get a weapon for Cid.
 You can't get across the fire-pits yet unless you've gotten the Suishin
 x no Uroko from the submarine docks (see section 4i for more information
 on the Suishin x no Uroko, and section 4j to find out what treasure you
 can get from the fire-pits).  There's a chest here that has a weapon for
 Cid in it, but I got it back in Disc 1 so I forgot (I think it's the
 Grow Lance or the Mop). ^_^;  Talk to Rude again and then exit the cave
 and head south to find Corneo, who's tied Elena and Yuffie to the face
 of a Dachao statue.  When you confront him, he summons a boss to attack
 you.

 @{b}BOSS TIPS: RAPUSU                               LV: 39  HP: 6000  MP: 300@{ub}

 This winged beast isn't that tough, but unless you were able to hold onto
 some Materia, all you can do is attack.  Use Phoenix Downs and Hi-Potions
 or other restorative items to heal your party, and you may want to use
 'attack' items like the Deadly Waste or Swift Bolt in order to
 inflict damage along with your normal attacks.  Because of their high
 attack power, Red 13 and Vincent make the best allies to have in this
 fight.  If you think you can make it without Vincent assiting you, then
 use his breaks to inflict lots of damage on the boss.  You'll recieve a
 Peace Ring when the battle is finished.
 _________________________________________________________________________

 After the battle, Don Corneo will ask you a question and you have three
 answers to choose from.  Pick any one you like.  Corneo threatens to
 kill Yuffie and Elena, but then Reno and Rude show up and send Corneo
 to his well-deserved demise.  Back at her house, Yuffie will give all
 the materia she stole back to your characters (including the MP Absorb
 materia).

 You'll find yourself back in the World Map again, but I wouldn't leave
 just yet if I were you.  Return to Wutai and enter the building near
 Yuffie's house.  It's full of cats.  Normally, there's nothing you can
 do here, but now you can climb up the steps in the back to find a
 secret passage.  Walk north (towards the screen), to find a cat and a
 chest.  Inside the chest is a HP Absorb materia.  Take it and go back
 outside.

 Now, head back to the courtyard.  Enter the pagoda and talk to the man
 there, Goorikii.  He'll inform you that if she wishes, Yuffie can
 fight by herself against the five guardians of the Pagoda of Five Strong.
 Choose the top option to accept and the bottom option to decline.  After
 each battle, go up the stairs and talk to the person there, picking the
 top option to fight them and the bottom option to not fight them.  You
 don't have to kill all the guardians in one go, and if Yuffie is killed
 in battle, the game won't end, although she'll have zero HP and will
 need to be revived before she can fight again.  Your enemies are:

 First Floor: Goorikii, a winged creature.

 _________________________________________________________________________
 @{b}BOSS TIPS: GOORIKII                             LV: 30  HP: 3000  MP: 150@{ub}
                                                 (weak vs. Wind)

 Use Haste on yourself, then use the Deathblow materia repeatedly in
 order to inflict lots of damage.  Don't forget to heal yourself when
 your life gets low.  The boss can use Barrier, but he's still easy to
 defeat.  Yuffie gets an X Potion once she's won the battle.
 _________________________________________________________________________

 Second Floor: Sheiku, a penguin-like monster.

 _________________________________________________________________________
 @{b}BOSS TIPS: SHEIKU                               LV: 32  HP: 4000  MP: 180@{ub}

 Use the same strategy that you used against Goorikii.  You might try
 the Barrier spell to reduce physical damage.  His 'Furious Bomber' attack
 causes a lot of damage, but it will fill up your Limit Break bar very
 quickly.  Yuffie will recieve an Turbo Ether when the fight ends.
 _________________________________________________________________________

 Third Floor: Chehofu, a four-armed foe.

 _________________________________________________________________________
 @{b}BOSS TIPS: CHEHOFU                              LV: 34  HP: 5000  MP: 210@{ub}

 Keep your HPs up in case you get paralyzed.  Once again, using Haste,
 Barrier, and then attacking with the Hissatsu materia should do the trick
 if your attack power is low.  Yuffie's prize for winning this battle is
 a Ice Ring.
 _________________________________________________________________________

 Fourth Floor: Sutanifu, a creature swinging and iron ball.

 _________________________________________________________________________
 @{b}BOSS TIPS: SUTANIFU                             LV: 36  HP: 6000  MP: 240@{ub}

 Fight him the same way you fought Sheiku.  Without a doubt, the easiest
 boss of the Pagoda of Five Strong.  If you win, Yuffie will get an
 Elixir from him.
 _________________________________________________________________________

 Fifth Floor: Godoo, a three-headed monster.  Note that he will
              automatically attack you win you talk to him.

 _________________________________________________________________________
 @{b}BOSS TIPS: GODOO                              LV: 41  HP: 10000  MP: 1000@{ub}

 Godoo's attack style changes depending on which head is facing you.  He
 has many attacks, including the Tryne Enemy Skill and the ability to
 drain your HP.  He will also use his supply of MP to heal himself for
 around 1200+ points per use.  To beat him, deplete him MP supply by using
 the Ghost Hand item or Magic Hammer Enemy Skill (you can learn it from
 the Ashigirisous that live north of Wutai; they look like bunches of
 grass).  The other way to beat him is simply Berserk yourself, assuming
 you have enough HP and your attacks do over 1200 points of damage.  Your
 only other tactic is to stay alive until he runs out of HP and then
 attack him.  You'll get Yuffie's Level 4 Limit Break Manual (Universe)
 once Godoo is defeated.
 _________________________________________________________________________

 After Yuffie defeats Godoo, he'll give you the 'Summon Leviathan'
 materia.

 instead of Fire 3 <spell>).  This means that you should use the highest
 level that you have (or the one that suits you the best.

 The default settings of the PSX controller are:

 CONTROL PAD -           Moves your character in eight directions.  Also
                         used to move the cursor during menu screens and
                         to highlight enemies/allies and options during
                         battle.

 SELECT -                Shows location of character on-screen using a
                         cursor.  In battle, this turns on/off the
                         HELP window.  In the World Map, it has the
                         same effect as the START button.

 START -                 In the World Map, it displays/removes the map.
                         During battles, it pauses the action.

 SQUARE (pink) -         During battle, holding this button removes the
                         Command window, making the Barrier gauges more
                         visible.  It also switches between the Materia
                         window and Equip window on the Menu Screen
                         (providing you are in either of those windows).

 X (blue) -              Cancels selections in the Shop screen.  During
                         battle, it cancels choices and during the Menu
                         screen, it cancels choices and closes the screen
                         if no choices have been made.  If not assigned
                         an ability, this button cancels choices and
                         returns you to the previous option during any
                         other screen.  When used in conjunction with the
                         control pad, your character dashes while on the
                         field.  Dashing can be combined with L1 and R1
                         to run at an angle.

 TRIANGLE (green) -      In the field, it opens the Menu screen.  In the
                         Menu Screen, it de-equips whatever Materia is
                         selected if you are in the Materia window.  In
                         battle, it highlights whoever you want to fight
                         next (assuming they have a full Time bar).

 CIRCLE (red) -          In the field, press it when near something to
                         examine it or to talk to a person.  This button
                         is also used to pick up items, open treasure
                         chests, and latch onto ladders and objects.
                         It will select the items you wish to buy or sell
                         at shops, and can be used to verify commands or
                         perform an action (like opening a gate, running
                         an elevator, etc.)

 LEFT ONE (L/1) -        When held and used in conjunction with the
                         control pad, your character walks at a 45-degree
                         angle to his left.  When selecting items or magic
                         in the Menu Screen, it moves the view up a screen
                         with each press.  When selecting a character to
                         check that person's Materia, magic, equipment,
                         status, or Limit Break, pressing this button
                         scrolls backwards through the characters according
                         to their lineup.

                         In the World Map, this button makes your character

                         magic in the Menu Screen, it moves the view down
                         a screen with each press.  When selecting a
                         character to check that person's Materia, magic
                         equipment, status, or Limit Break, pressing this
                         button scrolls forward through the characters
                         according to their lineup.

                         to ground-level view.

 RIGHT TWO (L/2) -       While in the World Map, switches the viewpoint
                         from ground-level to overhead.

 Other Commands:

 L1 + R1 -               During battle, makes you run away if held down
                         for a while.  Doesn't always work, and is
                         ineffective in certain fights.

 L1 or R1 -              Selects between a single target or all targets
                         during battle when using magic/commands
                         (assuming you have an All or Everything
                         All materia working in conjunction with

@node 74 "Battles"

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
   @{b}7 . 4      b a t t l e s@{ub}
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------

 There are two ways to enter a battle.  The most common way is to be
 randomly attacked while exploring the World/Area map screen.  You will
 also fight boss battles, which aren't random and occur only after a
 certain event/arriving at a certain location.

 When the battle starts, the camera will move inwards for a better view
 (it switches constantly during battles, but you can set it to remain
 stationary in the Configuration screen located in the Main Menu).
 The enemies will be on the left, and your characters appear on the right
 (usually).  Depending on a person's Speed Plus, either you or the enemy
 will attack first (not the whole party, just a single character).  The
 object of battle is to kill all your enemies without getting killed
 yourself.  A battle ends when either side has died, or if the enemy or
 your party runs away.

 To the left on the Battle Menu window is the word NAME.  Underneath this
 appears the names of the three characters currently in your party.  Next
 to that is the word BARRIER.  Beneath that is a double-gauge that informs
 you how long your Barrier (vs. physical attacks), or Mabarrier (vs. magic
 attacks) will last.  Note that they are only full if you have a
 (ma)barrier spell in use, have an equipped accessory (Reflect Ring) or
 are using some other form of physical/Magic Plus defense.

 To the right of that is the word HP.  This shows the current/total amount
 of HP each character possesses using both numbers and a bar.  If you have
 few HPs left, the numbers turn yellow.  And if your status has been
 changed (i. e. you are poisoned), the total amount of HPs is replaced by
 the name of your status condition.  Depending on the amount of HPs
 remaining and the type of status you have, your character may fall to
 one knee or crouch on the ground to show that he is weakened.  Farther to
 the right is the word MP.  Below that is the current amount of MPs each
 character has, represented in both number and bar format.  If you are low
 on MPs, the numbers turn yellow.  If you die, your HP and MP numbers are
 shown in red.  Finally, on the far right are two bars.

 The first bar is the Limit bar.  As you are attacked, this bar increases
 in proportion to the damage received.  When it is full, it will flash
 rapidly.  During this time, you can use your Limit Break attacks instead
 of fighting (described later on), and your agility is increased.  If you
 don't use your Limit Break when a battle ends, it is carried into the
 next battle.  If you don't use your Limit Break for several rounds during
 a battle, it empties slightly (but can be refilled).  Choosing to be
 attacked by yourself or your friends, or being attacked by a confused
 friend will not increase your Limit bar.

 The last bar is the Time bar.  It increases in proportion to a person's
 Speed Plus rating.  When it is full, it flashes orange, and you are now
 able to choose a command (this is also signified by the yellow, pyramid-
 shaped icon that appears over the person's head and by their name, which
 flashes between white and gray).  When it is not full, you cannot control
 that character.

 When a person's Time bar maxes out, the Command Window appears, covering
 the Barrier gauges (they can be uncovered by holding the S button).  The
 first option is Attack (one enemy or one friend).  If your Limit Bar is
 full, then it is replaced with a rainbow-colored font and you cannot
 Attack but can use Limit Breaks.  The next option is Magic (assuming your
 character knows magic/has a Magic Materia equipped).  This allows you to
 select a magic spell to use, providing you have the proper number of MPs
 left.  The third option is usually blank, unless you have a Command
 Materia equipped.  When such Materia are in use, this option can be many
 things: Steal, Throw, etc.  The fourth option is Item, and it allows you
 to use your inventory of unequipped items on yourself or against an enemy.
 Note that you cannot equip or de-equip items or Materia during battle.
 Depending on the number of Materia equipped, you may have more than four
 options available, in which case the Command Window will expand to show
 them all.  Other commands are listed in the order that your materia are
 equipped.

 At any time while the Command Window is showing and you haven't yet made
 a selection, you can press right (then the O button) to guard.  You
 can't attack while guarding (which lasts the whole round), but any
 damage inflicted on you is halved.  Likewise, pressing left (then the
 O button) makes you change rows.  This takes a whole round and you can
 do no other action while changing.  Characters in the front row inflict
 and recieve more damage, while characters in the back inflict and
 receive less damage (you can also change row position in the Menu Screen;
 changing position during battle isn't permanent).

 There are several ways to attack or get attacked.  The situation chosen
 when entering a battle is somewhat random, but your abilities and
 statistics can change the outcome:

 (Attack)                    The standard you-versus-them setup.  Priority
                             is determined by Speed Plus.

 (Chance)                    The enemies will have their backs turned and
                             you can all attack, run, or perform any other
                             command without being attacked for the first
                             round only.

 (Back Attack)               You have your backs turned to the enemy, who
                             appears on the right.  Not only are your rows
                             reversed (front to back/back to front), but
                             the enemy gets to attack first without you
                             being able to do anything about it for the
                             first round only.  Note that Materia that
                             work automatically (like Guard and Counter
                             Attack), will still function normally.

 (Side Attack)               You appear on either side of your enemy.
                             Although you can't use the CHANGE command,
                             this method prevents the enemy from turning
                             his full attention to all characters and lets
                             you attack from the front and behind.

 (Scissors Attack - Ambush)  The enemy appears on either side.  You cannot
                             use the CHANGE command, and it is impossible
                             to direct an attack or spell towards all
                             enemies.  Your foes can make both front and
                             back attacks.  Keep in mind that it is very
                             important whether or not you are facing your
                             opponent--your attacks/limit breaks/magic
                             won't hit enemies who are behind you.


 RUNNING
 Normally, you can run away from an enemy party, but not always.  If you
 can't run away, a message will tell you so and holding L1 and R1 will
 have no further effect.  Unless fighting a boss (who you can never
 run away from), you can almost always run from an Initial Attack (first
 round only) or Side Attack formation.  You cannot run from a back attack
 for the first round, and you must be facing toward your enemy in order
 to run away (since you run in the opposite direction).  If ambushed,
 you cannot run unless you kill all the enemies on one side of you and
 are facing toward your foes (for the same reason listed above).

 When you run away, the battle ends, but you gain no money, AP, or EXP.
 Also, you can be attacked while running and it may take anywhere from a
 second to several minutes to escape a battle, (if it is possible to do
 so).  You can select and confirm commands while trying to escape (in
 which case you will stop running to attack, use an item, etc.), but you
 won't run away while doing such things.


 OTHER SITUATIONS
 While the game is paused during battle, you can do nothing but remove
 the Command Window (if it is showing) by holding the S button.  While
 a character is summoning a monster, you can build up your Time bar and
 select commands, but not confirm them (this includes running).  During
 enemy actions and some of your own actions, the 'Time' message changes
 to 'Wait' and your bars won't fill until either you or the enemy finish
 doing whatever caused the 'Wait' status in the first place.


 END OF THE BATTLE
 If you lose a battle (the enemy is able to reduce your party's HP to zero
 via attacking, magic, etc.), the game ends.  You must start over from
 your previously saved game.   If you win the battle (by reducing all
 enemies' HP to zero via attacking, magic, etc.), then a screen appears
 showing you how many EXP and AP points you've gained*.  Pressing O calls
 up another screen where the amount of Gil (currency) you've won is shown,
 and you have the option of taking items from your fallen foes (if they
 had any items).  Once the battle is over, you are returned to the field/
 area you were at prior to the battle.

 If a character is dead when the battle ends, he or she will gain no
 EXP or AP.  The same applies to _fully_ petrified characters.

     but is still lost forever.  Also, all flying enemies are immune to
     this status ailment.

 Your status condition is usually always shown at the bottom of the
 screen, over the 'MAX HP' section in red letters.  If you have more than
 one change (i.e.  you are poisoned and slowed), then the condition
 message will constantly change back and forth.

 While in the World Map, you can show, enlarge, or hide the Map by
 pressing Start or Select repeatedly.  When you get them, the river-
 crossing Buggy and Cid's Airplane are represented as green and blue dots,
 while the submarine is shown as a red dot and the airship 'Highwind' is a
 white dot.  Here in the 3-d 'overworld', you can travel through forests,
 plains, and fields in search of towns, caves, and other places.  As in
 previous Final Fantasy games, mountains, rivers, and oceans are
 impassable while walking, but may be traversed using other means, such
 as vehicles or special breeds of Chocobos.  When you enter a 'location'
 (i.e. a town or dungeon), you enter the area map and leave behind the
 World Map.  No matter where you are on the World Map, you always run the
 risk of fighting monsters.

 Area maps are a series of rendered backgrounds linked together to make up
 a location.  Your freedom of movement is somewhat limited in these areas.
 Most FMV sequences take place while in an area map.  Aside from talking
 to people and fighting battles (depending on where you are), you can also
 find treasure chests, navigate through hidden passages, climb up ropes,
 activate switches and levers, or save your game at Save Points.  With few
 exceptions, area maps are the only place where you'll find bosses.

 In towns, be sure to talk to the townspeople and investigate the
 buildings to get clues, items, etc.  There are, of course, shops in most
 of the towns, too.  Shops sell anything from potions and weapons to
 bracelets and Materia orbs.  In a shop, you're given three choices
 initially.   The rightmost one is BUY*.  Choose the item you want to buy,
 then press left, right, up or down to confirm how many of that item you
 want.  The middle option is SELL.  Choosing the left choice lets you sell
 items and weapons, while the right lets you sell your Materia.  The third
 option is QUIT, and returns you to the game.

 * These are not the exact English equivalents of the Japanese used.

 GOLD SAUCER'S BATTLE SQUARE
 To play this game, go to the Battle Square and enter the main building.
 Talk to the lady by the righthand booth and she'll give you an option.
 Choose the top one to enter the Battle Arena, or the bottom one to
 decline.  It costs 10 GP to enter the Battle Arena each time.  Should
 you accept, you have to choose which character will fight by himself
 in the Arena.

 Once inside the Arena, you have to fight 8 consecutive battles against
 randomly-picked sets of monsters.  Fighting is done normally, and you
 can use anything you have equipped (weapons, spell materia, command
 materia, items, etc.) to attack your enemies with.  Each time you finish
 a battle, you get the message 'GREAT!' and you're then told how many BP
 (Battle Points) you've won in that particular battle (it's on the right
 side of the window).  You have two options; pick the left one to keep
 fighting or the right one to give up and leave the Arena.

 If you choose to keep fighting, a slot machine appears prior to your next
 bout and you have to press O to stop the wheel.  Whatever you land on
 will have a significant effect upon you as soon as the next battle
 starts.  However, most of these conditions can be remedied by using
 items, and some (such as Minimum) won't even affect you if you're wearing
 an accessory that protects you from that type of status ailment.  Below
 is a list of many of the various results you may land on*:

            Poison        -    'Poisoned' status.
            Frog          -    'Toad' status.
            Mini-Cloud    -    'Minimum' status.
            Red Orb       -    Disables Red (Summon) Materia.
            Yellow Orb    -    Disables Yellow (Command) Materia.
            Green Orb     -    Disables Green (Magic) Materia.
            Purple Orb    -    Disables Purple (Independent) Materia.
            Blue Orb      -    Disables Blue (Combination) Materia.
            Five Orbs     -    Disables all Materia.
            Ring          -    Disables accessories.
            Bag           -    Disables items.
            Luck Plus 7       -    Luck is cut in half.
            Boots         -    Speed Plus is cut in half.
            HP & MP       -    Max HP and MP is halved.
            MP Sign       -    Max MP is halved.
            MP Zero       -    Max MP is reduced to 0.
            Sword         -    Attack power is lowered.
            Bracelet      -    Your defense is lowered.
            Stopwatch     -    Time bar takes x30 longer to max out.
            Lv. Down      -    This lowers your level by 5, 10, 15....
            Cure          -    Gain back 9999 HP.

 *  Of course, it is possible to cheat.  For example, if your Magic
    materia have been disabled but you just used Monomane after casting
    a magic spell, you can mimic yourself to still use that spell.  Or
    if you have Nageru combined to a Counter Attack materia and your
    items are disabled, you will still hurl one of your throwable items.

 Each time you choose to keep fighting, yet another bar appears on the
 slot machine.  And because the eight battles are continuous, you'll keep
 whatever ailment you landed on in the last battle (unless you cured it),
 and get another ailment as well, making the battles progressively harder
 as you suffer from more and more handicaps.

 You do not gain AP, EXP, or gil for fighting in the Battle Arena.  You
 can't learn enemy skills, either, even if you proceed to win all eight
 battles.  You can steal or henka enemies to get items, but that's it.
 Using Limit Breaks in the Arena won't deplete your Limit bar when the
 battles are over, though.  Your fighting spree ends if:

  - You win all 8 battles.
  - You choose to give up after completing a battle.
  - You cast Escape on yourself or use an item that has a similar effect.
  - You run away :)
  - You are killed during the course of the battles :(

 Unless you're killed or run away, you will keep all the Battle Points
 that you've earned from each fight.  What's more, you can continuously
 enter the Battle Arena (providing that you have enough GP) and fight
 over and over to pick up even more Battle Points.  However, you lose
 _all_ your BP if you leave the Battle Square, so you have to get the
 number of points you want in one trip.  You can trade in the Points
 you've earned for prizes by going to the machines on the left or right
 side of the entrance and examining them.  The following chart appears if
 you have enough BP to purchase something:

 BATTLE SQUARE PRIZES - DISC ONE

 NAME                    COST       EFFECT
 Phoenix Down             100 BP    Item

 W-Summon          64000       Command Materia

 You can buy as many of each item as you like if you have enough BP.


 BATTLE SQUARE: THE URA BATTLE
 In order to gain access to the URA (reverse) Battle, you have to be in
 Disc 2 or 3.  Cloud must be in your party, and you have to have the
 Ultima Weapon as well.  Go to the Battle Square and keep fighting
 until you have enough BP to buy Cloud's Limit Break Manual or the Double
 Summon materia (you don't have to use Cloud to earn the Battle Points).
 Purchase one of them, then fight some more until you can afford the
 other item.  Make sure that Cloud has learned all his limit breaks
 except for his Level 4 Limit Break, then use his Manual on him and
 equip him with the Ultima Weapon and the W-Summon materia (you
 don't need to attach a Summon Materia to it).  Talk to the lady at the
 desk and she'll invite you to participate in the URA Battle.  You'll
 have to win eight consecutive fights against 8 boss monsters, even ones
 that you may not have met yet, like PuraudoKuraddo and JamaaAamaa.  If
 you're able to defeat all the bosses, then Dio will reward Cloud with
 the Final Attack materia.


 ALL THE GOLD YOU'D EVER WANT...SORT OF
 While I have yet to meet him, several people have told me that a man
 will show up outside of the Gold Saucer from time to time.  He'll be
 standing near the back of the screen in the outer entrace area (where
 the Save Point is).  If you talk to him, he will trade you 1 GP for
 100 gil.  You can purchase up to 100 GP off him every time he appears.


 A MYSTERIOUS OPPONENT
 If you get a high enough time score in the Snowboarding game at the
 Gold Saucer (which, BTW, has different courses than the one at Icicle
 Lodge), you'll get to race against a 'ghost' racer.  Who could this
 master of the snowy slopes be?  A Moogle, that's what.  Don't make
 Cloud look bad in front of all his friends--beat the Moogle!


 Fort Condor:  THE MINI-BATTLE GAME
 You can fight at the Fort Condor during any disc, although if you want
 the Huge Materia, you'll have to play and win at least once in Disc Two.
 What's written here are brief instructions and simple strategies to win.
 The object of the game is to prevent the enemy from taking your land
 (this is indicated by a pink bar to the left of the screen), and to wipe
 your foes out before they finish you off.  Your guys are blue; the
 enemy's force is red.

 In the beginning, you'll be in control of a cursor and there are no
 enemies on the screen.  You can use this time to place your allies
 before the battle begins (while you can place icons during the battle,
 it's easier to start off right now).  You can only set people as far
 as the red line; if you can't place a person, a red X appears over the
 hand cursor.  Placing icons costs money (gil).  Remember, you can't
 place bad guys!  The types and statistics of each icon (good and bad)
 are as follows:

 Note that not all of these will be available intially (like the Fire
 Catapult and Tristoner).

 Commander               250             ???

 *   These guys can fly over obstacles, giving them more range.

 The bad part about all this is that it cost real money (your money!) to
 play this game.  So it's best that you stock up on gil before playing.
 However, you'll be paid gil for every ally left standing when the battle
 ends.  To buy an icon, use the controller to select them and press O.
 Then choose where you want to place one and press O again.  If you're
 placing a (Fire) Catapult or (Tri)stoner, then you'll see a red circle
 or wedge-shape when you place them; this indicates their line of fire.
 Use the Control Pad to choose how you want them to aim their attack.

 When you're ready, press X and choose the top option.  The battle
 begins!  Your controls work like this:

 O               Accept a command.  Place the cursor over a character
                 and place this button and you'll be given an option;
                 see the list of icons to see what options are available.
 X               Decline a command
 L1 / L2         Decrease the Speed Plus of the battle
 R1 / R2         Increase the Speed Plus of the battle
 Start           Pause/unpause the game
 Select          Show/hide instruction screen
 Pad             Moves cursor/put over ally or foe to see their
                 statistics and the direction they're heading in.

 Every time one of your icons finishes walking, enters battle, or is
 killed, you will be asked if you want to go to their location/give them
 a new command (if they died, it asks if you want to place a new one).
 Press O to accept, or X to decline.


 ICON OPTIONS  ___________________________________________________________


 Stoner                  TOP OPTION - DIRECTION.  You can redirect
 TriStoner               either type of droppers' line of fire.
                         BOTTOM OPTION - REMOVE.  The dropper is
                         destroyed.

 Catapult                TOP OPTION - DIRECTION  You can redirect
 Fire Catapult           either type of catapult's line of fire.
                         BOTTOM OPTION - REMOVE. The catapult is
                         destroyed.

 Fighter                 OPTION - ACTION.  Pick where you want any of the
 Defender                three icons to move to and press O.  If they
 Shooter                 can't walk to a certain location, an X appears
                         over the cursor.

 Repairer                OPTION - ACTION.  Works just like the ACTION
                         command explained above.

                         If you make a Repairer walk near a damaged
                         Catapult, Fire Catapult, Boulder, or Triple
                         Boulder, he can repair them (give them back
                         HPs).  These guys can automatically fight, too.

 Worker                  TOP OPTION - ACTION.  Works just like the WALK
                         command explained above.
                         BOTTOM OPTION - BOMB.  Creates a bomb that
                         explodes when enemies approach.

 The 'Dismantle' command for the catapults and droppers may seem useless,
 but once an enemy force has passed beyond the range of one of these
 icons, they are useless.  To free up space for more icons, (you can only
 have 20 at a time, remember?) you'll want to use this ability.

 Basically, the battle is fairly automatic.  People attack when close,
 the catapults and droppers fire continuously.  All you have to do is
 move, replenish, and place new members.  The battle ends when the 'land
 taken' meter maxes out (i.e. they reach the little brown hut) or you
 win the battle by destroying all the enemies.  Including the boss who
 shows up when most of the enemy force is defeated, there are about 40
 enemies in total, who climb up the screen in a more or less steady,
 continuous wave.  If you've played FF3, this feels a little like those
 'mass-crazy-fight-till-you drop battles', but without the rush of
 adrenaline that usually accompanies such a fight.

 BATTLES
 (Note that you'll have to wait a while before another fight is
 available.  Also, as far as I can tell, there's no point in donating
 money since you'll have to spend Gil to hire troops, anyway.)

 Battle One:  10 Enemies: 6 Beasts, 3 Wyverns, 1 Commander
              Prize - Magic Comb

 Battle Two:



 STRATEGY FOR THE HUGE MATERIA BATTLE
 Hope you have some money.  Start by placing Tristoner at the top of each
 path and angle their line of fire to follow the path (that's 4).  Then,
 buy another one and place it at the main junction and make it fire
 straight forward.  Now, purchase four Fire Catapults and place them at
 the bottom of the paths, as close to the red line as you can.  Angle
 their line of fire to hit where the Tristoners can't.  If you can spare
 the gil, place two more just a little ways south and to either side from
 the main Tristoners for added protection.  Still with me?  Place some
 Defenders and Attackers down at the bottom, then place a whole bunch of
 Fighters, Attackers, and Defenders at the top of the screen.  Last, stick
 in some Shooters in hard-to-reach areas where they can pelt the enemy.
 As your installments are destroyed/killed, all you have to do is place
 new ones.

 EXPENSIVE STRATEGY
 If you have a _lot_ of cash, then just go crazy with the Tristoners and
 keep placing new ones (since they'll instantly fire).  If the enemy
 gains too much ground, start amassing forces of Defenders and Attackers
 to take your opponents out and defend your installations.  The boss is
 easy to kill since he's slow and shows up when there's not a lot of
 people left (leaving him all buy himself).  Just gang up on him with
 Defenders and Fighters, and if you've placed them earlier, try to steer
 him towards the Bombs that the Workers can lay.

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
   @{b}7 . 9      m a i n   m e n u@{ub}
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------

 At any time, press T to go to the Main menu.  Here, you'll see portraits
 of the members of your party, and to the right of each portrait, the
 following stats:

         Current level of experience (LV)
         Current/maximum HP
         Current/maximum MP
         Amount of experience gained (top bar)
         Maximum Limit Break Level
         Amount of energy in the Limit Break gauge  (bottom bar)

 At the bottom of the screen is listed the amount of time you've spent
 playing, and beneath that, the amount of gil (currency) you're carrying.
 Beneath that is the name of your location.  To the far right are ten
 commands that you can select and choose:

 ITEM
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 This screen shows the items you have.  You can USE an item, ARRANGE your
 items in eight different styles, or view your KEY ITEMS (these commands
 are in order from left to right).  Depending on the item you choose, you
 may be able to use it on you or your companions (choose with the pointer).

 USE          - Move the cursor to select and use an item.
 PUT IN ORDER - Arrange the items in one of eight ways:

   ZIBUNDE  - Do-it-yourself.

   FIELD    - Items usable while on the World Map/Field are at the top of
              the list.
   BATTLE   - Items usable during a battle are at the top of the list.
   THROW    - Items that can be thrown are at the top of the list.
   CATEGORY - Items are grouped by category (Weapons, Bracelets,
              Accessories, and Items).
   NAME     - Items are sorted by name (using the Japanese alphabet).
   OOI      - Items that you have the most of are at the top of the list.
   TSUKUNAI - Items that you have the least of are at the top of the list.

 KEY ITEM     - Shows what Key Items you have.  You can see an item's
                description by pressing O and moving the cursor.


 MAGIC
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 After choosing this command, choose the character whose magic you'd like
 to view.  When the screen changes, highlight MAHOU to see what magic
 your character has equipped, SHOUKAN to see what summon materia he or
 she is wearing, or TEKI NO WAZA, to see what enemy skills have been
 learned.  You can use the O button and the cursor to see descriptions of
 the spells and use the ones that are highlighted.


 MATERIA
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 After choosing this command, choose the character whose Materia you'd like
 to view.  The top row shows Materia holders on your weapon, and the bottom
 shows holders attached to your bracelet.  To the left of the weapon bar is
 this command:

 TESIKA - lets you see how your Materia will be displayed during battles.

 To left of the bracelet bar are these commands (press O to reveal them):

 PUT IN ORDER        - arrange your materia (by color, not type).
 REMOVE ALL          - unequip all your materia.
 THROW AWAY          - dispose of a materia.

 To equip materia, place the cursor over a slot and press O.  A list of
 materia will be shown.  Scroll up or down using the controller or the
 L1 and L2 buttons until you find the materia you want, then press O
 again.  If you do this to a slot that already has a materia in it, it
 will be switched with the one you selected.  To de-equip materia, select
 a slot with a materia on it, move the cursor to a blank space in the
 materia list, and press O.

 When the cursor is hilighting a materia, the following information is
 shown:

  - A description of the materia (this appears in the long, thin box)
  - An information box showing the following stats.:

    Type of Materia / Materia name           no. of level stars
    Symbol for Damage Type (if any)          Current AP
                                             AP needed for next level

    Ability of materia                       Score Changes

    (either the spell name, like             (shows how the materia will
    Fire 1 or Cure, or a                     alter your scores when it

    ability is shown in black,               decreases are in red.
    it cannot be used).

 Please refer to the 'Materia Orbs' part of Section 15 of the FF7 FAQ for
 more detailed information.


 EQUIPMENT
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 After choosing this command, pick the character whose equipment you'd
 like to change.  The first row changes your weapon, the second row
 changes your bracelet, and the third row changes any special items you
 have equipped.  If you have other items that can be equipped, they're
 shown in the box to the right.  In the top-left box, the number of
 Materia holders for that item is shown, and in the lower box, the
 benefit/loss of equipping a certain item will be shown (yellow is better,
 red is worse).  Beneath the materia box, the AP growth for that item is
 shown (normal, x0, x2 or x3).


 STATUS
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 The fifth option is STATUS.  Choose the character whose status you want
 to see.  Here, you see the same stats shown on the main screen, although
 the EXP and Limit Break bars are also shown in number format.  On the
 left are a list of stats, they are, in order:

 Power
 Speed Plus
 Physical Strength
 Magic Plus Power
 Mind
 Luck

 Attack Power      - Power + Physical Strength
 Hit Rate          - Power + Speed Plus
 Defense Power     - Physical Strength + Mind
 Evade Rate        - Speed Plus + Luck
 Magic Attack      - Magic Plus Power + Mind
 Magic Defense     - Magic Plus Power + Mind
 Magic Evade Rate  - Magic Plus Power + Speed Plus

 To the right is shown your character's commands in the battle screen, and
 below that is shown the weapon, bracelet, and special item name and the
 Materia they can hold.  Pressing O while at this screen shows another
 screen where different Elementals your character has are highlighted.

 The first four rows are for damage types.  Although the rows go from
 left to right, I'm listing it in a top to bottom format:

 GAME TERMS
 Fire Damage
 Ice Damage
 Lightning Damage
 Earth Damage
 Poison Damage
 Demi Damage
 Water Damage
 Wind Damage
 Holy Damage

 Halfway down the screen is a larger, two-row list (it's shown twice).
 The list is for status changes:

 Going left to right, top row....

 GAME TERMS
 Death
 Critical
 Sleepel
 Poison
 Sadness
 Angry
 Confusion
 Silence
 Haste
 Slow
 Stop
 Toad
 Minimum

 Going left to right, bottom row....

 Slow Petrifying
 Petrified
 Regeneration
 Barrier
 Mabarrier
 Reflect
 Megabarrier
 Condemned
 Controlled
 Berserk
 Invincible
 Paralysis
 Darkness

 If you check this screen and one of the symbols is lit up, that means
 that that particular type of damage is being affected by the item you're
 wearing (it does no damage, is halved, restores HP, etc.)  If part of
 one of the lower lists is lit up, that means that that particular kind
 of status ailment is being affected by the item you're wearing.  To see
 what kind of 'affect' is in place, you need only look at the blue words
 to the far right:

 Elemental  ______________________________________________________________
 The damage type row is listed four times because there are four
 Elementals that can affect damage types.  They are:

   (Attack)
    - Attacks hit with highlighted Elemental.

   (To Halve)
    - Damage from highlighted Elemental is halved.

   (No Effect)
    - Attacks that hit with the highlighted Elemental have no effect on
      you.

   (Absorb)
    - When hit, you will absorb the highlighted Elemental and gain HP
      instead of losing it.


 ADDITIONAL  _____________________________________________________________
 The two-row list of status changes is shown twice because there are two
 additional affects that affect status changes.  They are:

   (Attack)
    - An attack you make also hits with the highlighted status ailment.

   (Defense)
    - In addition to damage you take during battle, you will defend
      yourself against the highlighted status ailment.

 Special damage is damage that can't be defended against because it has no
 element type or traits (meaning that even with an accessory, Barrier, or
 Mabarrier equipped, it will still hit for full damage).  I think the only
 way to protect against special damage is if you are invincible (via the
 Shield spell or Aeris's Breaks) but this may not be true.


 ORGANIZE
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 After choosing this command, press the O button twice to switch a person
 between front and back row, or choose one character, than another, to
 make them switch position.  The switch is permanent until you change it.


 LIMIT
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 This screen shows you the same stats as on the main screen (minus the EXP
 bar).  Your max Limit level and learned Limit Breaks are highlighted
 below.  To the right are two commands.

 SET          - Choose what Limit Break level you want to use, as long
                as it's available.  Choosing a new level will empty
                your Break meter, BTW.  This is the left option.

 CHECK        - Pick this and use the cursor to see descriptions of each
                Limit Break after picking the Break Level you want to
                view.  This is the right option.


 CONFIG.
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Choosing this command take you to the Configuration screen.  There, you
 have the following options:

 (Window Color)
 After selecting this option, choose a corner of the small window and
 adjust the amount of red, blue or green by using the control pad.  To
 verify a color change, back up twice to the config. screen.  You cannot
 return to the default color unless you enter it manually.


 (Sound)
 Pick between:

  (Monaural) - for monaural sound output.
  (Stereo)   - for stereo sound output.


 (Controller)
 Pick between:

  (Normal) - Use the default controller settings.
  (Custom) - Customize the controller.

 To customize your controller, highlight 'Custom' and press O.  Then
 press Start.  Now, use the cursor to move to the function you want
 to change and press the desired button to assign that function to the
 pressed button.  The order of functions is:

   O       =  (Accept)
   X       =  (Cancel)
   T       =  (Menu)
   S       =  (Extra)
   L1      =  (Left One)
   R1      =  (Right One)
   L2      =  (Left Two)
   R2      =  (Right Two)
   Select  =  (Help)
   Start   =  (Pause)

 You can set the buttons to have any command, but you can't exit out of
 this screen if you try to give each button the same commands.  Press
 LEFT when you are done setting the controller the way you want.

 (Cursor)
 Pick between:

 (Initial) - The cursor will always appear at the top of the Main Menu.
 (Memory)  - The cursor will appear on the sub-menu you last selected
             when it is opened.


 ATB  (Active Time Battle)
 Choose from:

 (Active)      - Time is always running.
 (Recommended) - Time stops during item or magic use.
 (Wait)        - Time stops when selecting items or magic (and their
                 respective targets).

 Even with Active Battle turned on, time still pauses during the use
 of a summon spell, certain enemy actions, and other various attacks.


 (Battle Speed Plus)
 Press right to slow down the speed of battles, or left to increase it.


 (Battle Message)
 Press right to make a message during battle appear longer, or left to
 make it appear for a shorter period of time.


 (Field Message)
 Press right to make a message spell out slower, or left to make it spell
 out faster.


 (Camera Angle)
 Pick from:

 (Auto)  - The camera will move around freely and focus on ally and enemy
           actions.
 (Fixed) - The camera view stays in the exact position as when the battle
           first begins.


 (Magic Rank)
 This option lets you set up your magic spell order (attacking, healing,
 and other, I suppose), in one of six setups.  This doesn't seem to affect
 your list of spells, though, so I'm not too sure of this option's purpose.

 NO. 1:  Restore       Attacking     Indirect
 NO. 2:  Restore       Indirect      Attacking
 NO. 3:  Attacking     Indirect      Restore
 NO. 4:  Attacking     Restore       Indirect
 NO. 5:  Indirect      Restore       Attacking
 NO. 6:  Indirect      Attacking     Restore


 PHS (Party Hensei System)
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 In most cases, PHS is usable while standing on a Save Point or during
 any time while standing on the World Map.  You don't have this option
 in the beginning, BTW.  Choose the character you which to eject from
 your party and the person you want to join from the right (or vice
 versa).  Keep in mind that you can't eject the leader of your party
 (usually Cloud), and in some cases, certain characters insist on going
 with you, so they can't be removed for the time being, either.

 NOTE:  Characters who aren't in your immediate party still gain levels!
        However, they only gain a small amount of EXP in relation to your
        party, so they tend to fall 3-5 levels behind if not used for a
        long time.


 SAVE
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 The last option.  Pick it, then choose the Memory Card slot you want to
 use, then choose one of fifteen Save slots you want to save your game in.
 Choose the top option to save or the bottom option to not save.  If no
 Memory Card is inserted or there's no more space, a message will tell
 you so.

 You can get Yuffie in your party during any disc.  If you're in Disc 1
 and are riding around in the Buggy, that will work, too.  The two
 places that she appears most often are the forests beyond the Gold
 Saucer (in the Gongaga Area), and most forests in the Junon Area.
 After a few battles, you'll fight Yuffie (seems to be a 1 in 15 chance,
 if you ask me).

 _________________________________________________________________________
 @{b}BOSS TIPS: MEI NO NINJA  <Mysterious Ninja>     LV: 37  HP: 1950  MP: 280@{ub}

 Just attack, really.  The Summon Materia 'Titan' works well.  Yuffie can
 do all kinds of cool attacks during this time, but not once she joins
 you!  Yuffie's level, HP and MP vary depending on what level your
 characters are at.
 _________________________________________________________________________

 When the battle ends, you'll be in a plain with Yuffie lying nearby.
 There's also a Save Point here.  However, if you touch the Save Point,
 then go to your menu screen to save, Yuffie escapes and steals 200 gil!
 Don't worry, you can meet her again.  You'll have to talk to her several
 times to get her to join.  As she and you converse, she'll ask you
 several questions, and you can reply in two ways.  To get her to join,
 respond like this:

   Bottom answer, Top answer, Bottom answer, Top answer, Bottom answer

 Put another way, respond using the second reply, then the first reply,
 then the second reply... and so on.  After that, you can name her, and
 she'll hook up with Cloud and the rest of the gang.  Note that if you
 choose the top answer for the last question she asks, you can name her,
 but she'll steal 700 gil from you and run away.  You'll have to repeat
 the whole process if you want to get her in your party.

 The second 'optional' (or hidden) character in the game, Vincent can
 also join your party during any disc.  You'll need the gold key from the
 safe in Nivelheim's Shinra Mansion (see below if you don't know how to
 open it).  Go down to the pink cavern leading to Sephiroth's library
 (it's in the Shinra Mansion, the entrance is in the stone wall in the
 eastern wing).

 Remember the door to the crypt you couldn't get through?  You can now
 enter it.  Stand at the foot of the purple coffin and hit O.  The lid
 will fly off and Vincent will talk to you.  Choose the bottom reply when
 he asks you a question.  When the coffin closes, press O again.  Choose

 What most people forget when trying to open the safe is that it's just
 like a real combination lock...so you have to go in more than one
 direction when inputting the numbers.  Furthermore, unless you're
 fast enough, you'll run out of time if you try any other combination.
 The code is:

         RIGHT TO 36, LEFT TO 10, RIGHT TO 59, RIGHT TO 97

 This means that you hold right and scroll through the numbers, then
 hold left until you reach 10, then hold right for the last two numbers.
 Don't forget to press O to verify each entry.  When the safe opens, a
 Summon Materia (Odin) pops out, and you are assaulted by a big goon
 (how'd he fit into that little safe?)

 _________________________________________________________________________
 @{b}BOSS TIPS: ROSUTONANBAA  <Lost Number>          LV: 35  HP: 7000  MP: 300@{ub}

 This boss can be taken out just by attacking and using Limit Breaks.
 Magic spells (Fire, Cold, Lighting) that are at level 2 are also
 okay to use.  Heal yourself and use Summon Materia (like 'Sumon Chocobo
 and Moogle', and you'll win in no time.  Aside from physical attacks,
 all this guy can really do is use a Lightning 2 spell on you, but it only
 does 400-500 points of damage to one character, so it's nothing to
 worry about.  Rarely, he does a double-fisted hammer punch to one
 character that averages 2200 points of damage, though, so pack in some
 Phoenix Downs before trying to tackle him.  If you blow off his red
 half (the one that uses magic) his physical attacks become more
 aggressive, so keep your HP Plus.  Likewise, if his purple half is
 destroyed first, the Lost Number will use more mid-level spells, like
 Quake 2, against your party.  It is possible to kill this boss without
 either part of it dying (by stunning it using the 'Summon Chocobo and
 Moogle' spell).
 _________________________________________________________________________

 Not only do you get an item from the boss once you beat it (it's the
 manual for Red 13's Level 4 Limit Break, the Cosmo Memory), but there's
 also a gold key lying in the safe that you can grab (Chi x x no Key).
 Don't forget to take the Red Materia!  Apparently, there's a paper in
 the lower room in the right wing of the mansion that hints at the correct
 combination for the safe, but someone like me can't read it :(  Once
 you've read the paper, you can find hints throughout the house (by the
 piano, next to the chair in the bedroom, etc.)  Refer to the Disc One
 Walkthrough for more information.

 Did the code still not work?  Remember, the safe's lock is LIKE A REAL
 COMBINATION LOCK.  So, when you're turning to 36, you can either land
 on it or creep up to it, but you can't hit 37 and go back.  This
 applies to the rest of the digits, too; you can't go farther than the
 number you want.  If you do (i.e. you go to 09 when trying to get to
 10), you'll have to start all over again.

 Get over 100 wins by fighting battles.  To see how many wins you have,
 get in the Highwind or ride a Green, Blue, Black, or Gold Chocobo
 ever so slightly south and a little ways to the east of Midgar City,
 where you'll find a cave surrounded by mountains with a river nearby.
 Inside the cave is a sleeping fellow who (usually) tells you how many
 wins you've gotten so far.  Not only do you need to have over 100 wins,
 but the last two digits have to be the same (100, 111, 255, 733, etc.)

 When you have the correct number of victories, talk to the sleeping
 man.  He'll toss and turn, then give you an item (Mythril).  Next,
 go to the house on the penninsula near the Gold Saucer (you should
 recognize it since it's full of weapons inside).  Talk to the man in
 the house, and when he gives you a choice, pick the top option.
 You'll lose the Mythril, but you now have the choice of opening the
 long wooden chest by the bed to get a Gold Armlet, or examining the
 metal lid on the upper floor at the end of the walkway to get the
 manual for Aeris's Level 4 Limit Break.

 It's probable that you can do this with less than 100 wins, but I'm
 not certain of that.  Someone want to verify it for me?

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Go to Nivelheim (the town by the pointed mountains on the Western
 Continent).  Enter Tifa's house (the second building on the right side)
 and head upstairs to where her piano is.  Choose the bottom option,
 then the bottom option again to play it (you can't use the top option
 if you want the manual).  Then, press:

         X, S, T, L1+T, L1+S, X, S, T, L1+X, O, X, S, X

                               or*

         D, L, U, L1+T, L1+S, D, L, U, L1+X, R, D, L, D

  * You can also use a combination of buttons and direction presses.

 I'd like to stress that as far as I can determine, the result of
 playing the piano is random.  Sometimes, nothing happens, other times,
 you'll find 1 gil, and other times, you'll find Tifa's Level 4 Limit
 Break Manual (keep reading).  I'd also like to state that I've gotten
 her manual _without_ having Tifa in my party.  I'm not sure how I did
 it, but I have a save file that proves it (see? see!)  I thought I did
 it by playing the melody once, exiting out, playing it again, exiting
 out again, and then getting back on the piano and pressing L1+T.

 But, the way that you're _supposed_ to do it is to stick Tifa in your
 party, go to the piano, play it once using the 'button only' method,
 and she'll eventually find a letter from her master, Zangan (the caped
 guy you saw during the first Nivelheim flashback).  Tifa will get the
 Final Heaven Limit Break Manual after reading his letter.

 You can use the Key to enter the locked gates near Area 7 and look

 you can see her bending over the flowers; she'll flicker and disappear

 the Wall Market and go to the 'ITEM' building with the machine gun
 inside it, you can get Tifa's Ultimate Weapon by examining the computer
 before the gun fires upon you (you don't need Tifa to get the item).
 Also, remember the man in the gun shop that you bought the Battery
 from to reach the Shinra Building back in Disc 1?  The man in the left

 There are six of these flyers scattered throughout the world.  You can
 find them in the following locations:

 Flyer No. 1:  Midgar City...the town next to Aeris' house.  Go to
               the second floor of the southeastern building and look
               at the papers taped to the wall by the stairwell.

 Flyer No. 2:  Shinra HQ...on the first floor, check out the board with
               the papers on it near the elevators.  The only time you
               can read this flyer is at the beginning of the game or
               when you raid Midgar in Disc 2.

 Flyer No. 3:  Gold Saucer...go to the Ghost Square and enter the hotel.
               Read the sign that says 'SHOP' next to the shop entrance.

 Flyer No. 4:  Cosmo Canyon...check the left wood post of the Tigerlily
               Arms Shop.

 Flyer No. 5:  Cosmo Canyon...the gold paper by the door on the second
               floor of the inn (the entrance is behind some hanging
               cloth near the bonfire).

 Flyer No. 6:  Utai...the bottom floor of Yuffie's house; it's the wall
               scroll to the right of the doorway.  You can't get there
               unless you've done the sub-quest (refer to the 'Bonus
               Areas' section).

 You don't have to find the flyers (they look like pieces of paper) in
 order.  Whenever you have read all six of them, go to the restaurant
 in Wutai (the large building in the southwestern corner of town).  Talk
 to the barkeep and you'll get a Power Source, Guard Source, Magic Source,
 Mind Source, Speed Source, Luck Source, and a Mega Elixir.

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  @{b}8 . 8      a l l   7   f e v e r@{ub}
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------

 As easy as this trick sounds, it's harder to perform than you might
 think.  One of your characters has to have a current HP of 7777 (or a
 maximum and a current HP of 7777...I'm not sure yet).  This can be done
 by getting injured, equipping materia, or raising levels.  When that
 particular character enters a battle, the message 'Ooru 7 Fiibaa' (All 7
 Fever) will appear.  It will show up every time the 'fevered' character
 attacks, too.

 During this time, the person affected by the 'All 7 Fever' will make one
 _normal_ attack against each enemy when their Time Bar is filled, even if
 you have materia such as Slice Everybody or Mega All
 equipped.  However, assuming they don't miss, that person will always
 strike for 7777 damage, even if an enemy has special defenses.
 Furthermore, that person behaves as if he/she was berzerked (i.e. you
 can't select commands for them since they will do nothing but attack),
 and can take no other action (even if you're wearing a Counter Attack
 materia).  They can still lose HP or be affected by enemy abilties/magic/
 etc.

 There are two major drawbacks to this trick; your current HP drops to 1
 point after the battle (it can be healed by normal means), and you can't
 repeat the trick unless you have 7777 HP exactly.  Since I think your
 maximum HP has to be 7777 too, this means that you can't repeat that
 trick once you raise a level, since you will gain HP and it will affect
 the amount of HP a materia is adding/taking away from your 'real' total.
 This means that the only way to permanently keep this trick is to get
 really good at using materia orbs to customize your character's life,
 or by killing that character before the end of the battle so that they
 don't gain experience ^_^;

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
   @{b}8 . 9      f m v   v i e w i n g   t r i c k@{ub}
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------

 All you FF7 owners out there should try this!  Go to any point in the
 game with an FMV sequence (such as starting a new game--the part where
 Cloud runs up to the Makoro furnace).  Open your PSX and put in another
 disc.  When you continue playing (the game won't crash) the FMV sequence
 will be replaced with one from the disc!  (Using the last example, put
 in Disc 3 and you'll see the sequence with the stone pillars rising from
 the center of the last level; it's the same bit you see after killing
 Jenova Synthesis before fighting Sephiroth for the last time.)

 What's really weird is that you can keep playing the game with another
 disc in your system!  I beat the whole first part of the game and the CD
 would load up the various levels!  I don't know for sure, but I guess
 that means that the ENTIRE game is written on each disc (barring the FMV,
 obviously)!  If you want to verify this, try starting up a save file from
 disc 3 and replace it with, say, the first disc.  You can do the
 submarine/snowboard sequences, or go to any place you couldn't go to in
 the first disc--and all the data loads up!

 Going back to the trick, though, you can try this anywhere, and you
 usually get cool results.  For instance, near the end of Disc 2, the
 Weapon monster rises up from the sea and attacks Midgar City--and gets
 decapitated by the Mako Cannon.  I switched to the first disc before
 viewing the FMV and saw parts of the intro, and some parts from the
 FMV during/after Aeris's death!  If you're fast, try switching the
 discs during the opening FMV when you start a new game; with Disc 2
 inserted, it showed some more FMV of Aeris (this is when you return
 with Buugen Haagen to the Ancient City).

 Even stranger is the fact that you can still see text/graphics over the
 FMV in some cases, such as Cloud and the Avalanche member running
 offscreen just after the furnace explodes near the start of the first
 disc, or Cid talking to Cloud on his phone during the part where the
 Weapon attacks Midgar City (of course, this is over the FMV from the
 disc you've chosen).  And as I mentioned before, you can play normally
 after the FMV is over, even with the other disc in your PSX!

 In earlier versions of this FAQ, I said that there was 'hidden' FMV of
 a silver car rotating around.  Several people e-mailed me and informed
 me that you can normally view this in the Shinra HQ during Disc One.
 What's interesting, though, is that when I saw this FMV by using the
 trick above, I had switched Disc One with Disc Three (at the FMV with
 the bridge collapsing in Cloud's flashback).  This means that it's on
 at least two of the three discs.  Why it's there is another story.
 Also, the scene with the planets in Buugen Haagen's observatory (which
 is only in Disc 1) will also be partially displayed if you switch it
 with Disc 2 or 3.

 Interestingly enough, you will instantly flee a battle if at least one
 character is petrified, stopped, or paralyzed while in the 'running'
 pose.  So as long as you are not fighting a boss or have been ambushed
 (see the Running section for more detail), you can always escape simply
 by letting the enemy do one of the above attacks to you, or by doing it
 to yourself (via Spell Materia)!  This is also useful if all your members
 are paralyzed, stopped, or whatever, and your last character is about to
 suffer a similar fate.  Simply try to run away (even if you can't), and
 you'll escape the moment you are hit by the attack.  The only exception
 to this trick is that if you are petrified and your other teammates are
 dead or petrified, then you will always lose.  This doesn't work on boss
 battles, by the way.

@node 811 "Raising Chocobos"

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
   @{b}8 . 1 1    r a i s i n g   c h o c o b o s@{ub}
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------

 This section is based upon a summarized guide written by Nikki.  Some
 information is also taken from a more detailed guide written by Crow.
 Their addresses can be found in the Special Thanks section near the end
 of the FF7 FAQ.

 You're going to need a lot of money, patience, and luck if you want to
 raise chocobos.  The payoff is that you can breed chocobos that can fly,
 swim, climb over mountains and go to places normal vehicles can't reach.

 a)  Go to the Chocobo Farm once you've accquired the Highwind.  Enter
     the house (not the barn) and talk to the person there.  Choose
     the first option, then choose the top choice.  Doing this will let
     you purchase one of the stalls in the barn.  You'll need to purchase
     all six, but they cost 10000 gil a pop.  If you want, you can do
     the process with only four stalls, but you'll have to kick out the
     chocobos you don't need to make room for the newer ones.

 b)  Leave and get on the airship.  Fly to the northern continent and
     land near the lone house surrounded by grass (it's exactly to the
     northwest of the farm).  Equip one character with a Steal (yellow)
     materia and keep walking around on the grass until you fight a
     large red reptile (Brachosaur?)  Try to steal from him until you
     get a Carob Nut (you'll get a message with an exclamation mark
     if you stole something).  Run away or beat him, then repeat the
     process three times so that you have three Carob Nuts.  You can
     also get this item from the same enemy if you go to the tip of the
     penninsula near the excavator's village on the Northern Continent
     where the dark grass is.

 c)  Now, go to the chocobo tracks near the Gold Saucer (by the shore).
     Equip someone with a Chocobo Attract materia and walk along the
     tracks until you enter a battle with a Chocobo.  Don't kill the
     chocobo, but do kill the other enemies.  When the battle is over,
     press X to dismount and select the top option to make the chocobo
     return to the farm.

 d)  Go to the tracks on the Southern Continent, near the forest where
     you found Cloud in Disc 2.  Unlike the walking kind, you can get
     running chocobos here.  Just repeat step (c) to catch one.  Wait
     a second--save your game.  If you didn't get the right type of
     chocobo (more about this in part e), you can reset the game and
     try again: the chocobo's gender is determined randomly each time,
     so you can end up with the correct gender if you keep resetting
     and naming the Chocobo until you get the one you want.

 e)  Return to the chocobo farm.  Talk to the guy standing still in the
     barn and choose the 3rd option, then the first choice twice.  Name
     your chocobo, then repeat with the other bird.  This will also place
     your chocobos in the stables.  You can tell by their stance (walking
     or running) if they are the right type.  To tell your chocobo's
     gender and race ranking (more on this later), go up to them in the
     barn and press O.

     You'll want to make sure that the running chocobo is female and
     the walking chocobo is male.  If you have a chocobo walking with
     his head down, put it in a stall, then talk to the man again and
     choose the 6th option from the top.  Pick that chocobo and choose
     the top option twice, then the bottom option once to let that bird
     go so you can get another one.  If the sex of the chocobo is wrong,
     just use the trick in the above section to change it.

 f)  Do you have the correct type and gender?  Talk to the man in the
     barn again and choose the fifth option from the top.  Choose one
     of the chocobos by walking up to it and pressing O.  Pick the top
     option, then repeat with the other chocobo.  When you get another
     choice, pick the top option.  A list will appear.  Remember the
     items you stole from that reptile in the north?  It will appear
     as the item 7th from the top (there should be a 3 next to it
     since you stole 3 items).  Choose and and choose the top choice.

 g)  Hopefully you got a green Chocobo!  If you got a blue one or a
     yellow one, reset and try to mate the two chocobos again (repeat
     step f).  You'll want a blue chocobo, but if you get one right
     now, it's harder to breed a green one -NSS-.  Keep note of your
     chocobo's gender--it's important.

 h)  At this point, you can't mate the yellow chocobos again or the
     green chocobo.  If you don't want to wait, repeat steps (c)
     through (f) and try to breed a Blue Chocobo who is the opposite
     gender of your Green Chocobo.  If you have time on your hands,
     though, waste it and come back later.  You can re-breed your
     two yellow chocobos and try to get a Blue Chocobo.  Either way,
     it will take _a lot_ of tries, but you save the trouble of
     capturing and renaming chocobos if you waste some time and just
     re-breed your two yellow birds.  Remember the item that you
     used (Carob Nut), will now have a '2' next to it since you
     already used one.  Don't worry, it will still stay in the same
     place on the menu.

 i)  Okay!  Now, you should have a Blue chocobo and a Green chocobo of
     opposite genders.  If you caught another pair of yellow chocobos,
     you won't have any more stall space and you'll have to let the
     two yellow ones go.  If you simply breeded them again, you'll
     still have two stalls left open.  Since the Blue chocobo is a
     newborn, you'll need to waste some more time before you can breed
     it to the Green one.  Hop in the Highwind and fly back to the
     house on the grassy patch in the Northern Continent.  Talk to the
     purple geezer and choose the first option.  He will offer to sell
     ou items; buy 40 of the ones that cost 5000 gil (Shirukisu
     Vegetable).

     Return to the Chocobo Farm and give ten of them to your blue
     chocobo and 10 to your green chocobo.  You can do this by picking
     the fourth option when you talk to the man, then picking the
     Sylkis Greens (it's the next to last one).  Pick the chocobo
     you want to feed it to and press up or down on your controller to
     increase the number.  Then press O twice to feed the chocobo.

 j)  Go to the Gold Saucer (you can get there from the sky lift in
     North Corel).  Go to the Chocobo Square, enter the main
     building, and talk to the girl in front of the 'STAFF ROOM'
     door.  Choose the first option and pick either your green
     chocobo or your blue chocobo to race.  Then pick the top choice
     two times and press Start at the next screen to start the race.

     The point of racing is to improve your chocobo's race ranking.
     Remember what happened when you checked your chocobo's stats?
     Underneath the gender was the race ranking.  You need to improve
     it from a C to an A-class ranking, and you can do so by racing.
     It doesn't matter if you lose; just keep racing until you gain
     new classes.  Refer to the chocobo-racing tips in section 3o if
     you need help, although it's easy to win the races using
     Automatic Sequence Mode.  Every time you win a race, pick the
     top option to get an item, the bottom option twice to get an
     item, or the bottom option, then the top option to get some GP.
     Remember, to raise a class level, you have to come in first place
     (and even then you may need to get a high score such as 1-2 or
     1-2 a few times before you'll gain a level).  When you do raise
     a race ranking, the girl will tell you.  You can see your
     chocobo's class every time you race it (at the screen before the
     race starts).  Obviously, it will take quite a few races before
     you can hit class 'A' (it took me around 3 races to raise to
     the next class each time).

 k)  Fun, wasn't it?  Get back in the Highwind and return to the
     Chocobo Farm.  Refer to step (f) and breed the blue and green
     chocobos together.  With a little luck, you'll find a black
     chocobo in one of the empty stalls the following day.  Yes,
     you may have used up your last piece of Karabu, but you won't
     need it anymore.  Once again, take note of your black chocobo's
     gender.

 l)  There's an elongated island with a forest on it northeast of the
     Chocobo Farm.  Go into the forest and wander around until you
     run into a tiny monster wearing boxing gloves (Goblin).  You can
     steal a Zeio Nut off of it--you only need one.  After you
     get it, fly to the chocobo tracks on the west edge of the Northern
     Continent and capture one; you can get the dashing kind here.
     Then go back to the farm, name your yellow Chocobo, and put it in
     the stalls.  If it isn't the opposite gender of your black chocobo,
     reset and try the naming process again.  Refer to step (e) if you
     forgot how to do this.

 m)  You should have 20 Sylkis Greenss left, so feed 10 of them to
     the dashing yellow chocobo and 10 to your black chocobo (just like
     how you did it in step i).  Now for the real fun part--you have to
     get an A-rank class for both the yellow and black chocobos!  So,
     just repeat what you did back in step (j).  It will take a while,
     but when they're both at race ranking A, leave the Gold Saucer and
     return to the Chococbo Farm.

 n)  Now, breed your yellow and black chocobo together.  This time,
     use the Zeio Nut (it's at the very bottom of the list).
     Once again, refer to step (f) if you have trouble navigating
     the menus.  It may have to retry a few times, but you'll end up
     with the gold chocobo eventually.  Now you can go anywhere on
     the World Map!

 YELLOW CHOCOBOS can go anywhere you can normally get to on foot.  The
 sole advantage is that a chocobo is a lot quicker than walking.

 BLUE CHOCOBOS can walk along rivers, but they can't go past waterfalls.
 They can also walk in shallow water, just like Cid's airplane could.

 GREEN CHOCOBOS can run over mountains, even the pointed mountains by
 Nivelheim.  They can also dash over _most_ cliffs and drops.

 BLACK CHOCOBOS can walk along rivers and move around in shallow water.
 They can also run over mountains and cliffs.  Unlike the blue or green
 chocobos, the black variety can go over any cliff or drop: even
 walk up or down waterfalls, enter the canyon surrounding the Ancient
 City, or walk _over_ the ice forest that you have to traverse in Disc
 2 after the snowboard scene!

 GOLD CHOCOBOS can do everything a black chocobo can--they can also
 walk in the ocean, allowing you to go anywhere you want, even into
 the dirt pit surrounding the Gold Saucer (just like the Saucer
 vehicle).  Truly the ultimate in transportation!

 In case you didn't know about it, you can rotate the chocobo you're
 viewing when using the various options in the Chocobo Farm by holding
 the R1 or L1 buttons :)

 Unlike chocobos that you capture and ride around on, the ones that you
 ride out from the Chocobo Farm are a little tamer.  They'll stay where
 you get off them until you ride them again, and you can do this as much
 as you want and return them to the Farm whenever you want (although you
 can only have one chocobo out at a time).  If you're riding a chocobo
 and you try to enter the Highwind, you'll find it in the 'Chocobo' area
 of the the ship.  You'll automatically be riding the chocobo when you
 land the ship, too.

 Head due south from Cosmo Canyon in the Highwind, then go a little to
 the west.  You'll see an island that's part dirt, part grass, with
 a smaller grassy island nearby.  This isle doesn't appear on the Map,
 but if you land the Highwind on the grassy plain and run around in
 the dirt long enough, you can fight Sabotenders (better known as
 Cactrots; those little cactus guys from FF3)!  You can't get Rename
 Cards from them or anything like that, but it's kinda fun fighting
 them.  Actually, the name of this island is 'Cactus Island' so it
 makes sense to find them here.

 To get to the second isle, head for the two islands near to each other
 on the northeastern edge of the map.  Then go north (and a little more
 to the east), and you'll come across an oval-shaped island surrounded
 by mountains.  There's a cave entrance here, but you can't land there
 in the Highwind.  For more about the island, refer to the Bonus Areas
 part in section 6.  The name of this place is 'Round Island'.

   @{b}8 . 1 3    g a m e   s h a r k   c o d e s@{ub}
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------

 I'm not much of a code-maker myself, but here are some cheats you might
 want to try.  Remember, you need a Game Shark or a Pro Action Replay for
 these to work.  Some people have reported problems with these codes
 (such as, these codes don't work with a PAR).  FYI, I made these codes
 using a Game Shark with PAR software (version 1.98), so I really don't
 know why it wouldn't work on both devices.

 All of the codes in this FAQ were made by me, unless otherwise stated.
 If you want to reprint, submit, or display these codes, please give
 credit where it is due.  If you want to submit a code, just tell me
 the code itself, what it does, and include any glitches/problems with
 the code.  Oh, and please tell me the code's creator if you didn't make
 it yourself.

 Finally, the reason why I've made these codes is because I didn't see
 anything like them beforehand.  So don't BS me about making the 'Materia
 Select' code first or any of that garbage, as I'm not interested.


 FF7 MASTER CODE                                         80000000 - 0000
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 This is the cheat that lets you use other codes with this game.  I don't
 know if it (and the other codes listed here) will work on every disc,
 but if a code doesn't, then I'll let you know.


 CHARACTER SELECT - 3RD POSITION                         8009CBDE - FF0x
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Enter this code, but replace the last digit with one of the following:

         x = 0  -  Cloud Strife
             1  -  Barett Wallace
             2  -  Tifa Lockheart
             3  -  Aerith Gainsborough
             4  -  Red 13
             5  -  Yuffie Kisaragi
             6  -  Cait Sith         (sometimes, Young Cloud)
             7  -  Vincent Valentine (sometimes, Sephiroth)
             8  -  Cid Hiwind
             9  -  <Young Cloud>
             A  -  <Sephiroth>
             B  -  <Chocobo>
             C  -  <'Nau Purintingu'>  (Now Printing)
             D  -  <'Nau Purintingu'>  (Now Printing)

 When you turn on the code, the character in the 3rd position will turn
 into whatever character you specified.  You may want to go into the
 PHS menu, turn off the code, and put the character in/out of the PHS
 groups a few times to 'debug' it a bit.  When you return to the Main
 Menu screen, that person will have the portrait/stats. of the desired
 character.

 It is HIGHLY recommended that you have the 3rd space EMPTY when you
 use this code as in some cases, a pre-existing character may overlap
 with the selected one.  The result is that, when you enter a battle,
 that character does not appear, cannot interact, and his/her HP drops
 steadily until it hits zero.

 Using this code:

 Characters all start off at their 'base' level (1).  If you use this
 code to get a character that you don't have at the moment (say picking
 Aeris while in Disc 2 or 3), they'll have the same stats and abilities
 as they did when you last had them in your party.  If you level them
 up, change their equipment, etc., then save the game and use the code
 to replace them with another character and put them back in, any changes
 you made will be saved, too.  Note that if you use this code to get a
 character you already have (say, if Cid is in the 3rd position and you
 put in the code for Cid), you'll get multiple copies of the character.
 This also happens if you have the code on while you try to pull a
 character in/out of the active group.  Copied characters disappear when
 you exit the PHS menu.

 Yes, if you save the game, you save the added characters.  The only way
 to remove them is to use the code to 'select' a new character, or to
 put them in PHS (inactive party) and then return to your Main Menu.
 Also note that sticking a 'selected' character in the first position
 will make Cloud disappear on-screen (you can still use the cursor).

 Finally, note that if you enter a conversation/event with a character
 you're not supposed to have (say, Sephiroth outside of the flashback
 or Aeris after Disc 1), the game may (and probably will) crash.  The
 only exception to this are the 'general' quotes which a character will
 say automatically, regardless of who he/she is.

 Specific Character info.:

 Both Cloud and Aeris become 'permanent' members of either your active
 party or the inactive party.  To remove them, you'll have to stick
 them in the third position (use Order), and put in a code for one of
 your normal characters.

 Sephiroth is still controlled by the computer, although you can take or
 change his equipment and Materia.  As he only has one weapon (Masamune),
 using the 'Item Select' code to have this item is useless as it's the
 only weapon he can equip.  Although it will act as if he and Young Cloud
 have Limit Breaks, they don't in actuality (if you look, you'll see
 that it's Vincent's and Cait's Breaks instead).

 This code has trouble realizing who is Cait Sith/Young Cloud and who
 is Vincent/Sephiroth, because of the way the characters' data is
 stored.  As a result, you may not always get the character you want
 when trying to get either of these characters.

 The 'Chocobo' and 'Now Printing' are not real characters.  They have
 no weapons, statistics, etc. (if you look, you'll see that they
 borrow the stats. of another character, usually your leader).  If you
 try to enter a battle with one of them in your party, you get the
 'overlap' result described above (as they are not playable).


 ITEM SELECT                                               8009CCxx - yzzz
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Please take note:  As long as you follow the below guidelines (remember
 to be careful when putting in the two 'location' digits), this code
 should work.  Several people have been complaining that they can't get
 the code to work--even the people with the same GS and version number
 aS-mine (1.98).  If you've _carefully_ tried this code and can't get any
 results, then you may simply not be able to use the code on your game.
 I have NO IDEA what causes this and I'm sorry I can't offer more help to
 those with problems concerning this code or the Materia Select code
 (they both work in the same manner).

 And yes, saving your game with this code _will_ save the items into
 memory--you'll still have to be careful that you don't end up with the
 'battle' glitch' described below (although it seems as if it's not in
 the English version).

 An example code would be 8009CCA8 - 202A for the Ghost Hand item, for
 those of you who don't understand how the x/y/z entries work.

 xx = Location where item appears on the Item Select Screen.  You can
      change this number to enter the code multiple times to have
      multiple items of your choice, but you _must_ use EVEN numbers
      (i.e. C2, 9A, or 88) or the game may glitch.  Also, if this code
      would put an item over an occupied space and not a blank one, the
      game may freeze or the item may not appear.  Finally, try to keep
      the location range between 8_ and C_ or the game may crash.

   y = No. of items; you'll have an infinite amount unless you turn
       the switch off (usually).  The number you enter is converted
       to hexidecimal form (so what you put in won't correlate with
       the # of items you get).  Keep in mind that 0 is a valid
       number and can be used.

  -   Codes ending in 069 - 07F give you these items.  As of right now,
      I don't know what their purpose is (they may be disabled Key
      Items, I think).
  -   Codes ending in 080 - 08F are swords for Cloud.
  -   Codes ending in 090 - 09F are claws for Tifa.
  -   Codes ending in 0A0 - 0AF are cannons for Barret.
  -   Codes ending in 0B0 - 0BD are combs for Red XIII.
  -   Codes ending in 0BE - 0C8 are rods for Aeris.
  -   Codes ending in 0C9 - 0D6 are spears for Cid.
  -   Codes ending in 0D7 - 0E4 are shurikens for Yuffie.
  -   Codes ending in 0E5 - 0F1 are M-phones for Cait Sith.
  -   Codes ending in 0F2 - 0FE are handguns for Vincent.
      The code ending in 0FF looks like a gun, but it is in
      fact Sephiroth's Masamune blade.
  -   Codes ending in 100 - 11F are defensive bracelets.
  -   Codes ending in 120 - 13F are accessories you equip.
  -   Codes ending in 140 - FFF are 'glitch' items that don't exist
      and have no purpose/effect on the game.

 If you have this code activated and you go into a battle, you may get
 a strange effect that prevents you from fighting the battle.  As the
 battle begins, these messages will appear, one after the other:

                 xxx: ### / Error Occurred: ##
                 L1+R1+SELECT x Reset xxx
                 System Error x xx xxxx

 Should you press L1+R1+Select at any time, you're instantly taken out of
 the battle.  While you don't gain AP, gil, or experience points or items,
 you don't lose anything, either.  Not only can this be used to bypass
 normal battles, but it can be used during boss battles and the game will
 continue as if you had fought and beaten the boss!

 This is pure speculation on my part, but I think this is probably some
 sort of error checker/debugger that was used by the game's programmers
 to test battle sequences, probably to fix up any flaws in the 'Active
 Time Battle' system.  This seems possible because the number seem to
 indicate your party's Agility compared to the enemies (I think).  And
 assuming my translations are correct (assuming, mind you :)) it would
 make some sense.

 Keep in mind that this may still happen even with the code off.  So,
 it's a good idea not to have this code on when you go into a battle.
 The best procedure would probably be to put in the codes for the items
 you want, then save your game and load it without using this code.
 Then, make sure that you don't have any spare items left in your menu
 (use them, sell them, or try 're-equipping' them to reduce the amount
 that you have--if you re-equip them you'll still keep one, but the
 others will vanish).  Of course, if you don't want to fight any battles,
 then leave the code activated :)


 MATERIA SELECT                                            8009D0xx - 00yy
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Well well!  Here's an interesting code.  It works very much like the
 Item Select code above, except that you have to go into the Materia
 Screen.  As long as the switch is up, you have an infinite number of
 whatever Materia you've selected.  The only bad thing about this code
 is that it will sometimes start off the Materia orbs with 'beyond master'
 levels, meaning that you can use all their abilities, but you can't get
 another one by mastering it.

 xx = Location where the materia appears on the Materia Menu.  You can
      change this number to enter the code multiple times to have
      multiple materia of your choice, but you _must_ use EVEN numbers
      (i.e. A0, C4, or 86) or the game may glitch.  Also, if this code
      would put a materia over an occupied space and not a blank one, the
      game may freeze or the materia may not appear.  Finally, try to
      keep the location range between 8_ and C_ or the game may crash.

 *   Codes ending in 16, 26, 3F, 42 and 43 are 'disabled' Materia that
     you can't normally get during the game.  In the Japanese game,
     they were still usable, but their abilities, descriptions, and
     other stats. have been removed/altered in this release.

     Note that the Underwater materia has been made into a
     real, usable Materia!  It's not used to revive Aerith, but to
     explore more of the underwater areas (and fight the underwater
     Weapon monster).

 **  Starts off with a variable number of stars (usually missing the
     first eight or stars 3, 6, and 7).

  - Codes ending in 00 - 0D, 10 and 12 are Independant Materia.
  - Codes ending in 0E, 0F and 17 - 23 are Combination Materia.
  - Codes ending in 13 - 15, 24, 25, 27 - 2C and 30 are Command Materia.
  - Codes ending in 31 - 3E, 40, 41, and 44 - 49 are Magic Materia.
  - Codes ending in 4A - 5A are Summon Materia.
  - Codes ending in 2D - 2F, 89 are game glitches and not real Materia.
  - However, equipping the '089' materia will raise most of your stats.
    to 255 and your MAX MP to 999, although your HP will be dramatically
    reduced.
  - All other codes (5B - FF, excluding 89) are game glitches and not
    real Materia.

 Here are materia charts for each of the 'disabled' materia.  Please note
 that the abilities/AP levels of these materia tend to fluctuate, even if
 you put these in using the Game Shark, saved your game, and then played
 again without the GS codes on.  Refer to the 'Main Menu' section of the
 first part of the FAQ for information on Materia descriptions, etc.

 These stats are taken from the Japanese version, only because they are
 more descriptive.  In the American version, none of the Materia have
 names (except for SuichuuKokyuu, which is 'Underwater'), and they have
 altered/disabled stats. and abilties.  For some reason, the only two
 Materia with abilities that work are Mabarrier and Law (in the Japanese
 version, all the materia had an effect except for 'Underwater'
 and 'Booster').

 SUICHUU KOKYUU  (Underwater Breath) - Independant Materia          1 star
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 

 Has no description.

 It says it's ability is 'SuichuuKokyuu*'

 This materia seems to have no effect when equipped, nor does it affect
 anything or anyone at any point in the game, as far as I can tell.
 Unlike all other materia, it has only one star.  I would assume that
 this Materia starts off mastered, but because of the Materia Select code,
 I have way over a million AP and I can't seem to make that number go
 down.  It could be that you have to master it (just like other materia)
 but then it would be the only materia in the game that starts off with
 no mastered star levels.


 * The info. box will give the stats. of the last Materia the cursor was
   on should you move it around (unless it was last on an Independant
   Materia, in which case it will display 'SuichuuKokyuu' for the ability
   name).

 Find:                Use the 'Materia Select' Game Shark code (11).

 NOTE:  If you want to learn more about this materia, please refer to the
 'Rumors and Speculation' and 'Documents' sections for more detailed
 conjecture.  For those of you who keep asking, I've been to the Ancient
 City and _nothing_ happens.  Believe me, I've experimented with this
 materia in just about every possible way and it doesn't seem to have
 any effect in the game.


 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 HOUSOKU  (Law*) - Command Materia               20000 AP          2 stars
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 

 Has no description.

 LV1:  ZENINAGE  (Coin Toss)  
       Just like the 'Zeninage' skill of the 'Nageru' materia.  Although
       it doesn't say it, you also have the Nageru skill (Throw) in
       battle, too.

 Find:                Use the 'Materia Select' Game Shark code (26).

 *  Mr. Kelley points out that this is most likely a joke by the
    programmers.  'Law' is what lawyers deal with, and the listed skill
    given for this materia is Coin Toss.  As in 'you have to throw away
    your money when dealing with lawyers'.


 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 BUUSUTAA  (Booster) - Combination Materia       90000 AP          5 stars
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 

 Has no description.

 It says it's ability is 'Buusutaa'.

 So far, it doesn't seem to affect any Materia I equip it to.  From the
 name, though, I'd imagine that it's supposed to increase the range/
 effectiveness/power of the Materia that you combine it with or perhaps
 increase the amount of AP you earn for that Materia.

 Find:                Use the 'Materia Select' Game Shark code (16).

 As you play the game, you'll find, buy, and be given Materia Orbs.  When
 equipped, these orbs have various functions (like Relics from FF3), and
 become stronger as you use them (like the Classes from FF5j).  There are
 five types of Materia:

         Green   -       Spell Materia.  When equipped, you can cast
                         spells like Lightning, Fire, Cure, Barrier, etc.
         Yellow  -       Command Materia.  These give you the ability
                         to Steal, Throw, Mimic, etc.
         Purple  -       Independent Materia.  These will increase
                         your scores, like Max HP or Speed Plus.
         Blue    -       Support Materia.  These augment the power
                         of certain other Materia.  For instance,
                         the 'Select All' Materia, when combined with
                         a Fire materia, lets you cast a fire spell on
                         all foes.
         Red     -       Summon Materia.  These let you summon monsters,
                         like Chocobo, Shiva, Bahamut, or even Typoon!

 * My tv has some strange color properties.  This means that when I
   mention a 'Purple Materia', it may actually be a Blue Materia.  I
   didn't even realize this until after first releasing this FAQ, so
   try and bear with me, okay?  I'll avoid incorrect naming in the
   future, but I may still get it wrong sometimes.  Sorry! ^_^;

 You can equip Materia from the Main Menu, and mix and match them in
 any way you want.  This is how they work:

 Weapons and bracelets have a certain number of 'holders' on them.  You
 can equip one Materia per holder.  So, if a sword has one holder and a
 bracelet has five holders, you can equip six Materia in all.  The benefit
 to equipping a Materia is the skills/magic/etc. it gives you.  The bad
 part is that equipping Materia tends to lower your statistics.  While
 this is only temporary, you'll have to decide if you value skills or
 scores more when equipping certain Materia.  To restore your stats. to
 normal, simply unequip the Materia you're using.  You'll notice that
 some holders aren't connected, and some are (it looks something like
 this: 0=0 ).  Connected holders are used to couple an Independent
 Materia with another Materia, since Independent Materia have no effect
 on their own.

 When you win a battle, you gain AP (Ability Points).  Each Materia has
 a number of stars, representing its' 'levels'.  All Materia start off
 at level 1, but can be increased to their max. level.  The more level
 stars a Materia has, the stronger and more useful it becomes.  To
 gain a star level, you have to gain a certain number of Ability Points,
 just like raising levels or learning Esper magic (in FF3).  However,
 only Materia that you have equipped earn AP.  Luckily, that Materia has
 the same number of points no matter who uses it.  For example, let's
 say Cloud keeps the Summon Chocobo materia equipped for a long time,
 and manages to raise it to level 2.  If Barret, who's never worn that
 Materia before, equips it, he can also use it at level 2 strength.  When
 you do 'master' a Materia (by gaining all its' levels), you will
 instantly get another Materia of the same type!  Even though it will
 begin at level 1 (i.e. unused), this means that you can have as many
 Ultima or Summon Bahamut materia as you want (for example), providing
 you max out the ones you already have beforehand.  Be sure to sell off
 Materia that you don't need; if you have a full Materia list with no
 empty places and you master a materia that you have equipped, it will
 appear in a random location on the list, permanently erasing the Materia
 that was in it's place (guess the programmers at Square never bothered
 to check that out, did they?)

 You'll want to be careful if you have more than one of the same Materia,
 because you have to raise them seperately.  And there's no point in
 giving two of the same Materia to the same person!  Try to figure out
 what Materia works best with which person (i.e. give the MAX MP Plus
 Materia to a good magic-user, and give the Deathblow materia to a
 character with low normal attack power).  Also, take note of the way
 the holders look; if they don't have silver dots in them (like this:
 O=O or just O), then you can still equip Materia, but you can't level-
 up them since none of the AP you gain in battles will be distributed to
 the Materia in that weapon or item.  The tradeoff is that such equipment
 is usually very strong.

 From Disc 2 onwards, you have the chance to find and collect four 'Huge
 Materia'.  They can be gotten from these locations:

 Blue Materia   - North Corel.  You have to save the town from being
                  destroyed by a train during Disc 2.

 Yellow Materia - The other Huge Materia is located in the Fort Condor--
                  you can only get this during Disc 2.  What you have to
                  do is win the 'mini-battle' sequence atop the tower or
                  you won't receive the Huge Materia.

 Green Materia* - Rocket Town.  After you and Cid blast off in his ship,
                  you'll have to enter the code command to free the huge
                  Green Materia.  If you can't save the Materia, it's lost
                  for good.  This quest can only be done during Disc 2.

 Red Materia    - Red Submarine.  If you were able to sink the red sub
                  during the return trip to Junon Town in Disc 2, you can
                  capture the huge Red Materia from the sunken submarine
                  at any time during Discs 2 or 3.  If you weren't able
                  to stop the sub, then this Materia is permanently lost.

 * In one game, I tried beating every quest but Corel.  I had three of
 the materia, Yellow, Green, and Red.  I always thought the Blue Materia
 was part of the Rocket Town sub-quest, but I guess not.

 While you have to get two of the Huge Materia in order to make the game
 progress during Disc 2, you don't need to collect all four of them.
 However, you can get the powerful 'Master Materia' from the Huge Materia,
 as well as the strongest Bahamut summon materia, 'Bahamut Form Zero', so
 it's advisable that you try to find them all.  You can receive the
 following materia from each Huge Materia:

 NAME                DESCRIPTION              PREREQUISITES
 Master Magic        Cast any magic spell     Huge Green materia and a
                                              'master' level for all 21
                                              magic materia.

 Master Command      Use most commands        Huge Yellow materia and a
                                              'master' level for seven
                                              command materia (see below).

 Master Summon       Use all summon spells    Huge Red materia and a
                                              'master' level for all 16
                                              summon materia.

 Bahamut Form Zero   A summon materia         Huge Blue materia and the
                                              Bahamut and Neo Bahamut
                                              summon materia orbs.

 Once you've fulfilled the prerequisites to get a certain master materia,
 simply return to Buugen Haagen's observatory in Cosmo Canyon and touch
 the correct Huge Materia (I hope you have the Huge Materia on you/have
 already taken it to the observatory in Cosmo Canyon beforehand!)  Pick
 the first option and the screen will glow; pick the top option to get
 your master materia or the bottom option if you want to get that
 particular master materia later.  You do have to have all the mastered
 materia on hand, but it doesn't matter whether they're equipped or not.

 If you're trying to get Bahamut Form Zero, then all you have to do is
 touch the huge blue materia and you'll automatically receive it after
 choosing the first option; you have to get this summon spell before you
 can receive the Master Summon materia.  There's good news and bad news,
 though:

  - All of the Master materia do not have level stars, so you can't
    simply 'master' them and get a second Master Materia.  Wearing
    one doesn't effect your statistics, either (so all of you who
    were hoping for a 'MAX MP +80%' or something like that will be
    disappointed!)

  - When you receive a Master materia, you lose all the materia that
    you mastered.  This means that not only will you be left with a
    bunch of low-level materia (since you get another materia of the
    same type when you master it, remember?), but you'll have to master
    each of them if you want to get a second Master materia of that
    type.  The good news is that if you have two mastered orbs of the
    same type (say, two Fires and you're trying to get the Master
    Magic materia), you'll only lose one and keep the other.  So, if
    you have two mastered Kjata materia and you get a Master Summon
    materia and want another one, you'll only have to level-up 15 orbs
    instead of 16 since one is already mastered.

 Individual notes on the Master materia:

  - If you affix a combination materia like All or Random Magic
    Strike to the Master Magic orb, it will affect all the spells!
    However, not all combination materia work with each spell.

  - When you master a Summon materia, you can call a particular summoned
    beast five times.  With the Master Summon materia equipped, you can
    summon any beast an infinite number of times (providing you have the
    MP for it)!  Like the Master Magic materia, Combination materia
    attached to this orb will affect all summon spells.

  - You only have to master the Steal, Sense, Throw, Morph,
    Deathblow, Manipulate and Mime materia orbs in order to get the
    Master Command materia.  This may sound good, but then again, all you
    get are the above abilities of those materia: this orb won't let you
    use other commands like Swordplay, W-Item, Techniques of the
    Enemy, or Continuous Slice, for example (but you can equip these
    seperately, if you like).

  - And of course, there are no Master Combination or Master Independant
    Materia :)

 This section lists each Materia and explains it's abilities and other
 information.  A new addition to this section is 'AP to Master': this
 tells you how many AP you will need to master that materia.  It's easy
 enough to check your current AP level in the Main Menu, but you can't
 figure out what the master amount of AP is until you're at the next
 to the last level--the reason for this addition.

 *5 Reflect reflects a magic spell to the opposite party (foe to ally, ally
    to foe) even if the caster and receiver are both allies or enemies.
    If a spell affects more than one person, only the people with Reflect
    will have the spell reflected.

    Unlike previous Final Fantasy games, a reflected spell (at least, if
    the reflective power is automatic or due to an accessory like the
    Reflect Ring) will bounce back and forth until it 'breaks through'
    a target's reflectiveness (which will still be there--it's not
    permanently removed) or misses.  This is quite a change from the
    normal 'reflect one time' rule of other FF incarnations, and whether

 LV1: (Throw)
      You can throw one of the weapons in your inventory at an enemy.

 You can control an enemy with this command.  If it works, your character
 can't do anything aside from controlling the enemy.  Not all enemies can
 be controlled, and on top of that, this command doesn't always work.
 While an enemy is under your command, you can do nothing aside from
 direct it (you can't perform normal commands, only pick commands for the
 monster under your control).  If you're using this materia and Subete

 control one, no matter how successful you are :(

 You can learn certain skills normally available only to your enemies
 with this materia equipped.  To learn a skill, the enemy must use it
 on you (even if you dodge it or are killed by it), and you must then
 proceed to win the battle.  Each time you gain a new skill, one of the
 24 stars in the Materia Menu lights up and the skill's name is added
 to the gray box beneath it.  Using enemy skills costs MP, in most cases.
 You can also check out Enemy Skills in the Magic Menu.

 You can mimic the last action one of your allies made when using this
 command, whether it was spell-casting, using up an item, activating a
 Command Materia, summoning a monster, changing rows, etc.  You won't
 lose any HP, MP, items, or anything else that would be used up or
 depleted normally.  Since Monomane mimics the last action made, you can
 skip through the other allies until it is your turn again to repeatedly
 imitate yourself.  And while you can't mimic Limit Breaks, you can
 imitate your own Breaks.  What's really cool about this materia is that
 you will imitate the person's combination materia, too.  So if someone
 casts Fire 2, and it's combined with Quadra Magic, then you will
 use Quadra Magic as well when you mimic them without having to have
 it equipped!

 This command lets you cast two spells, one right after the other.  MP
 consumption remains normal and you have to have enough for both spells.
 The great thing about this materia is that you can still use Mahou
 Midareuchi, All, Subete All, MP Turbo, or any other materia
 that affects magic along with this to affect both spells that you're
 casting.

 you've already called a monster the maximum number of times, you can't
 call it again using this command.

 This means that you can wear more than one for an even higher increase in

 This materia switches your maximum HP score with your maximum MP score.
 While this allows you to have up to 9999 MP, your HPs can never go
 beyond 999 while wearing this materia.  Interestingly enough, equipping
 an 'HP Plus' materia will increase your MP amount (up to 9999), and
 wearing a 'MP Plus' materia will increase your maximum HP (but you still

 LONG DISTANCE ATTACK                            80000 AP          2 stars

 You may attack from the back row without any reduction in your attack
 power.  This materia has no effect if you are in the front row.

 Find:                In the Mythril Mine.
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 PROTECT                                         40000 AP          5 stars

 LV1: 20% Up          The character wearing this Materia will block
 LV2: 40% Up          an enemy's attack by standing in front of one of
 LV3: 60% Up          his allies when they are attacked.  It won't
 LV4: 80% Up          always happen (unless you're at 100%), and that
 LV5: 100% Up         ally will keep guarding even if his HPs are low.
                      This only works when another ally is hit by a
                      physical attack, not by magic or certain enemy
                      abilties.

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 COUNTER ATTACK                                  100000 AP         5 stars

 The character wearing this will Counteattack using his weapon if he is
 targeted by an enemy (the attack doesn't have to be physical, and it
 doesn't have to be aimed specifically at the person wearing the Counter
 Attack Materia.  In fact, it doesn't even have to hit or do damage in
 order to trigger a counterattack).  Damage is the same, just as if you
 had attacked normally (it's even possible to miss).

 A counterattack is made only against the enemy you hit; combining
 this materia with Subete All, Renzokugiri, or any other materia that
 affects your ability to attack will have no effect.  However, I'm not
 sure how Enkyori Kougeki would affect this materia.  The chance of you
 Counter Attacking when hit raises at 20% per star.  You won't
 counterattack your friends if they attack you, BTW.

 Note that the more of these that you wear, the more times you make a
 counterattack.  So if you have 4 Counter Attack materia equipped and an
 enemy hits you with a physical attack, you will strike that foe 4 times.

 Find:                Caves behind Nivelheim, or you can receive it as a
                      prize for winning the chocobo races held at the

 MEGA ALL                                        160000 AP         5 stars

 Like All, this materia allows you to target all allies or enemies
 instead of just one.  However, the Subete All affects _every_
 ability your character possesses.  The ability must be a selectable one
 (in the Battle Window), and not an ability such as Counter Attack or
 Cover.  This Materia doesn't work with Summon Spells or the ability to use
 Items (even with W Item equipped).

 When paired with a Mahou or Summon materia, the MP cost raises by about
 1/3rd the original amount.  However, the effectiveness of the spell cast
 is increased by a third as well, whether it is damaged inflicted or HP
 restored.  The only exception to this that I've found so far is the
 Knights of Round materia--pair it to MP Turbo and the cost raises
 only 5 points, yet the amount of damage is still raised by a third.

 When linked to a green materia, you will target that spell on all allies
 or enemies instead of just one.  This allows you to hit them all with
 that spell.  The more levels you raise this materia, the more times you
 can do this; after enough uses of that spell, you'll have to target
 one enemy again until the next battle.  Note that All will not work
 with the following materia: Altema, Chiryou (Resist only), Fulkea, Fuuin,
 Inseki, Ridatsu, or Shield.

 Initially Equipped:  Red 13
 Purchase from:       Fort Condor
 Find:                Shinra HQ -- trade in one of the bags from the
                      'locked door' puzzle to get it.
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 QUADRA MAGIC                                    200000 AP         5 stars

 This can be combined with Spell or Summon Materia.  When used, the spell
 strikes 4 times, with the target randomly chosen each time.  The damage
 that spell would inflict is reduced, but the you only lose MP as if you
 had casted the spell once.  The same applies if it is combined with a
 Summon Materia.  This Materia works with every magic spell and summon
 skill except for Escape and Knights of Round.

 Find:                One of the bonus areas...refer to section 5b.
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 SNEAK ATTACK                                    150000 AP         5 stars

 If you have a Mahou, Summon, or Command materia attached to the Fuiuchi
 materia, then the character wearing them will instantly use the
 attached materia before the allies or enemies can attack.  However,
 there is only a small chance of this working, but you can increase it
 by raising this materia's levels.  This materia doesn't work against
 enemies that are supposed to attack first (such as the armored tank
 that you fight after escaping from Shinra HQ in Disc One).

 Find:                Receive as a prize if you did well in the chocobo
                      races at the Gold Saucer.
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 MAGIC COUNTER ATTACK                            300000 AP         5 stars

 Despite it's name, you can attach a Mahou or a Summon materia to this
 materia orb.  If you are attacked, there is a chance that you will
 Counterattack with whatever spell or Shoukan you have equipped, providing
 you have the MP for it.  The chance of you making a Counterattack
 increases 20% per level star you earn.  If you have either the Master
 Magic or Master Summon materia equipped, the Shoukanjuu or magic spell
 used is determined randomly.

 Find:                Receive as a prize if you did well in the chocobo
                      races at the Gold Saucer.
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 COUNTER ATTACK                                  100000 AP         5 stars

 This materia will only work if it is attached to a Command Materia.
 Furthermore, it will will only work with the following Materia:
 Ayatsuru, Henka, Hissatsu, Miyaburu, Monomane*, Nageru, and Nusumu.
 If you have the Master Command materia linked to this one, then one of
 the eight commands will be picked at random.  When you are attacked by
 an enemy, you will Counter Attackattack with the command materia you have
 equipped.  The chance of you counterattacking increases by 20% for each
 new level star you earn.  If the command chosen is Nageru or Zeninage,
 then the item thrown/amount of gil thrown is randomly determined.

 * Since Monomane will make you imitate what you or your allies just did,
   you can use Monomane to Counter Attackattack with Renzokugiri, a Summon
   spell, or any other Materia ability.  It's probably the best Materia
   to have when using the Counter Attack because you can strike back
   with just about any ability you can think of.

 Find:                Makou Pit.
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 FINAL ATTACK                                    160000 AP         5 stars

 This works just like the ability that many of your enemies have; when
 your HP is reduced to 0, you will activate whatever Materia is attached
 to the Final Attack Materia, but that Materia has to be a Mahou, Shoukan,
 or Command materia.  Be careful, though, since if one of your allies
 kills you, you'll attack them with the Materia you have equipped!  You
 can equip a Materia like Sosei or Barrier to revive yourself or protect
 your party once you pass away, though, making this useful as both an
 offensive and defensive tactic.  The more stars you've earned, the more
 times you can use this Materia when you are killed.

 Find:                A prize you can win at the Gold Saucer's Battle
                      Square, should you win the URA Battle.
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ADDITIONAL SLICE                                200000 AP         2 stars

 After using the materia that this is combined with, you'll perform a
 single physical attack on the enemy affected by the materia.  This means
 that if you use a materia on yourself (like Barrier), you'll attack
 yourself or your allies!

 Find:                Look on the 'switching path' in the Mountain
                      Crossroads area (it's where you can use your map
                      in the 2nd disk, just before the snowfield).
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 STEAL AS WELL*                                  200000 AP         2 stars

 After using the materia that this is combined with, you'll attempt to
 steal from the enemy affected by the previous materia (you won't move
 or anything--you simply receive a message telling you if you were
 successful or not).  Combining this with the Nusumu materia is obviously
 pointless unless you're having a hard time stealing from a particular
 foe.

 Find:                In a cavern above Wutai (you need to be able to
                      cross the fire-pits before you can reach it).

 *  Could also be translated 'Steal while you are doing (action)'.
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ADDED EFFECT                                    100000 AP         2 stars

 This materia is affect not only by which Mahou or Shoukan materia you
 combine it with, but if you affix it to your weapon or your bracelet.
 It takes the properties of the linked materia and gives your weapon or
 bracelet those properties.  For example, equip Shiva on your paired
 bracelet holders and you are protected from Ice damage.  Equip it and
 the Ikazuchi materia on your weapon's holders and your normal attacks
 will hit for lightning damage.  Like Zokusei (below), not all materia
 will work with this combination materia.

 Find:                Cosmo Canyon -- the cave that you and the old man
                      explore.
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ELEMENTAL                                       80000 AP          4 stars

 Like Tsuika Kouka, this materia affects the weapon or armor it is
 attached to as well as the materia it is combined with.  Zokusei only
 works when paired with certain Mahou or Shoukan materia.  If it is
 attached to a weapon, the type of damage you inflict is the same as the
 Materia combined with Zokusei (so if you have Phoenix attached to your
 weapon and it is combined with this materia, you'll hit for fire damage.
 And if you have Doku attached to you armor along with this materia, you
 will be protected from Poison attacks).  This Materia has no additional
 power when linked with a weapon, but if it is combined with a bracelet,
 it has the following abilities:

 LV1: Damage inflicted is reduced to 1/2 if it is the corresponding type.
 LV2: No damage is received if it is the corresponding type.
 LV3: Gain HP if you are struck with the corresponding type of attack.

 Zokusei will only work when paired with these materia:

 MAHOU MATERIA        SHOUKAN MATERIA
 Poison               Alexander        Titan
 Fire                 Ifrit            Ramuh
 Lightning            Leviathan
 Demi                 Phoenix
 Cold                 Shiva

 Find:                From Domino on the 62nd floor of the Shinra HQ.
                      Also in either Tifa's house or the mountains
                      behind Nivelheim (NSS).

 ====================
 RED - SUMMON MATERIA
 ====================

 All summon materia have five level stars.  The more levels you raise,
 the more times you can summon that particular Shoukanjuu (Summoned
 Beast) during a battle.  Unless mentioned, all summon attacks strike
 all enemies at once.

 This section lists the enemy skills you can learn in numerical order.
 It also lists the amount of MP needed to use an enemy skill, the effect
 of that skill, and the locations of monsters you can learn them from.


 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 STAR 01 - FROG SONG                                           COST - 5 MP

 Effect:  Transforms all foes into frogs and puts them to sleep.
 Learn:   From the green frogs (Tatchimi) in the circular forest near
          Gongaga Town (also from the other forests nearby).  <Disc 1+>

 Learn:   Burrowing squirrel-like foes (Muu) found near the Chocobo Farm.
          <Disc 1+>
 Tip:     You can't control this enemy, so you'll have to wait until they

 Tip:     You can control an Ashigiisou and have it use the Magic
          Hammer against one of your allies (choose the third
          option).
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 STAR 04 - PEARL WIND                                         COST - 34 MP

 Effect:  Each ally regains lost HP and their status ailments are cured
          and dispelled.  The amount of HP recovered depends on the
          current HP of the caster.
 Learn:   The white and green cactus-like monsters (Zemzerett) in the
          grassy area by Junon Town  <Disc 1+>, or from the winged
          serpents you fight if you're hit by a barrier at the Frozen
          Mountain.  <Disc 2>
 Tip:     You can't learn White Wind from a Zemzerett unless you control
          it and make it use the skill on you (pick the bottom choice to
          do this).
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 STAR 05 - BIG GUARD                                          COST - 56 MP

 Effect:  Has the same effect as casting Haste, Barrier, and Mabarrier on
          all your allies.
 Learn:   The spiky, shelled creatures with green tentacles (Beach Plug)
          that live on the shore near the Gongaga Town.  <Disc 1+>
 Tip:     The Beach Plug won't use Mighty Guard unless you control it
          and make it use the skill on one of your members (it's the
          middle option).
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 STAR 06 - ANGEL'S WHISPER                                    COST - 50 MP

 Effect:  An angel appears above one person and brings them back to life
          if they are dead.  They also relieve any status ailments and
          dispel any bad effects.  In addition HP is restored to the
          amount shown during the skill's use; however, this can be a
          bane to characters with high HP because if your life is higher
          than the amount shown, it is reduced to that amount.  You'd
          think that this would be a great way to weaken enemies with
          more than 9999 HP, but it won't work on your opponents in this
          manner--it will only heal them, remove status ailments, etc. :(
 Learn:   From the beckoning women in the yellow swimsuits (Polan Solita)
          you meet in the Makou Pit if you take the right path the first
          time you meet your friends.  <Disc 3>
 Tip:     The easiest way to learn this skill is by controlling your
          enemy and picking the bottom option to make them use this skill
          on you.
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 STAR 07 - DRAGON FORCE                                       COST - 19 MP

 Effect:  Increases your physical and Magic Plus defense rating.
 Learn:   From the dragons (Dark Dragon) you meet during the descent into
          the Makou Pit.  <Disc 3>
 Tip:     You can't learn this unless you control the Dark Dragon and have
          it use Dragon Force on one of you (pick the second choice).
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 STAR 08 - DEATH FORCE                                         COST - 3 MP

 Effect:  One ally becomes immune to instant death attacks (this doesn't
          protect you from dying if you lose all your HP).
 Learn:   The huge tusked turtles (Adamantaimai) by the shoreline of the
          Westmost Continent.  <Disc 1+>
 Tip:     You can't learn this skill unless you control the turtle and
          make it use Death Force against you.  To do this, choose the
          bottom option once it's under your control.
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 STAR 09 - Fire BLASTER                                      COST - 10 MP

 Effect:  A stream of fire burns one foe for fire (Honoo) damage.
 Learn:   From any enemy that utilizes a fire breath attack. One of the
          earliest locations would be the room with the ladders and
          pipes where you fight the boss of the mountains behind
          Nivelheim; you can fight Dragons in that area that use Kaen
          Housha often.  <Disc 1+>  You can also learn it from the
          flying yellow monsters (Aakudoragon) in the Mythril Mine.
 Tip:     While you could learn this skill by controlling a Dragon and
          picking the bottom choice to make it use this skill on you,
          chances are it will hit you with Kaen Housha as it's initial
          attack in the first place.  The same goes for the flying
          Aakudoragons.
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 STAR 10 - LASER                                              COST - 16 MP

 Effect:  Reduces an enemy's HP by one-half.
 Learn:   From the dragons (Dark Dragon) you meet during the descent into
          the Makou Pit.  <Disc 3>
 Tip:     You can either let the Dark Dragon use this ability on you, or
          you can control it (using Ayatsuru), and pick the top option
          to make it use Laser on one of your allies.
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 STAR 11 - MATRA MAGIC                                         COST - 8 MP

 Effect:  Fire a pack of missiles at one enemy for magic damage.
 Learn:   Machines with big feet and guns for arms (Sweeper Custom) around
          Junon Town.  <Disc +1>  Or from the wheeled robo-creatures in
          the underwater part of Junon Town.  <Disc 2>
 Tip:     To learn this skill from the Sweeper Custom, just control it
          and choose the last option.
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 STAR 12 - BAD BREATH                                         COST - 58 MP

 Effect:  Inflict multiple status ailments upon all enemies, including
          Confusion, Frog, Minimum (Shrink), Mute, Poison, and Sleepel.
 Learn:   From the Mobol creatures (green guys with tentacles and really
          big mouths) living on the outside ledges in the Frozen Mountain.
          <Disc 2>  You can also meet them in the Makou Pit, if you take
          the right path the first time you run into your friends.
          <Disc 3>
 Tip:     Be sure to have some protective accessories equipped when trying
          to learn this skill or your party may be too weakened by the
          Smelly Breath to kill the Molbol or even escape!
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 STAR 13 - BETA                                               COST - 35 MP

 Effect:  A swirling red shape appears, surrounded by specks of white.
          All targets are hit for magic damage.
 Learn:   The big shadow snake (Midgal Zuolm) in the marsh near the
          Chocobo Farm.  <Disc 1+>
 Tip:     This monster won't use Beta unless he's waving back and forth.
          To make him do that, inflict heavy damage on him.  Then just
          wait until he uses Beta.  If he still doesn't use it, take off
          a little bit of his life since he tends to use Beta more when
          he's near death.
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 STAR 14 - AQUALUNG                                           COST - 34 MP

 Effect:  Blue bubbles strike all enemies for water damage.
 Learn:   From the boss of the Ancient City  <Disc 1>, the winged chimera
          in the plains surrounding the Gold Saucer  <Disc 1+>; or from
          the floating sea-dragon creature (Saapando) in the sunken plane
          near the Gold Saucer.  <Disc 2-3>
 Tip:     To pick up this skill, just control a Chimera and choose the
          bottom option to make it use Aqua Breath.
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 STAR 15 - TRYNE                                              COST - 20 MP

 Effect:  A Delta Force-like attack that hits all enemies for lighting
          (Ikazuchi) damage.
 Learn:   The Ashura-like boss (Godo) of the pagoda's top floor in Utai.
          <Disc 1+>  Also from the red spider/crab-like creature (Stilve)
          living inside the Frozen Mountain <Disc 2>, or the spider-like
          boss (Materia Keeper) of the mountains behind Nivelheim.  <Disc
          1>.  Remember, the _only_ time you can learn this skill is while
          fighting one of the above monsters, so learn it while you still
          can!  If you miss it, it's possible to learn it from the Stilves
          you meet in the Gold Saucer's Battle Square, though -NSS-.
 Tip:     Actually, the Materia Keeper is more likely to use this against
          your characters than any other enemy that can use this skill.
          It's a good thing, too, since you can't control it.
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 STAR 16 - Magic Breath                                     COST - 75 MP

 Effect:  Rainbow orbs hit all foes for fire, ice, and lighting damage.
 Learn:   From the red spider/crab-like creatures (Stilve) living inside
          the Frozen Mountain.  <Disc 2>  Also from the blue, leech-like
          enemies (Parasite) in the Makou Pit.  <Disc 3>
 Tip:     To learn this skill from a Parasite quickly, control it and
          pick the last option to have it use Magic Breath on your
          allies.
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 STAR 17 - ????                                                COST - 3 MP

 Effect:  A weight drops and hits for special damage.  The amount is
          equal to the amount of damage the caster has received in
          battle.
 Learn:   From the balance-like creatures (Judge) in Nivelheim.  <Disc 1+>
          Also from the purple behemoths (Behemoth) you encounter when
          raiding Midgar City.  <Disc 2>  Keep in mind that you won't
          actually learn this skill unless you take damage from it.
 Tip:     The Judges will use this skill eventually.  You can't control
          them, but they're easier to run into than the Behemoths.
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 STAR 18 - GOBLIN PUNCH                                        COST - 0 MP

 Effect:  One foe is hit for physical damage.  The damage inflicted is
          multiplied if your opponent has the same EXP level that you
          do.
 Learn:   Imp-like monsters wearing boxing gloves :) (Goblin) found on the
          only forested island in the northeast area of the map.  <Disc
          2-3>
 Tip:     You can control the Goblins if you want (pick the middle option
          to use the Goblin Punch), but it's more likely that they'll hit
          you with it in the first place, so don't even bother and just
          let them strike first.
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 STAR 19 - CHOCOBOCKLE                                         COST - 3 MP

 Effect:  A fat chocobo bounces around and hits one foe for special
          damage.  This attack gains strength each time you flee from a
          battle.
 Learn:   Go to the Chocobo Farm.  Talk to the man in the barn and choose
          the first choice.  The 5th item from the top costs 1500 gil;
          purchase three of them.  Then go to the chocobo tracks on the
          Southern Continent near the forest.  Equip yourself with a
          Chocobo Yose materia.  When you encounter a chocobo, kill off
          all but one of the other enemies and use the item you bought 3
          of on the chocobo (it looks like an orange squash).  This will
          make the chocobo peck at the ground.  At any time after that
          point (whether or not the chocobo is still pecking), use the
          Level 4 Jibaku enemy skill and you'll be hit by the Chocobockle.
          <Disc 2-3>
 Tip:     Make sure you're in the right location (the forest near Mideel);
          you can't learn this skill from any other type of Chocobo (these
          are the only ones who will be affected by Level 4 Jibaku).
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 STAR 20 -  LEVEL 5 DEATH                                     COST - 22 MP

 Effect:  Any enemy whose level is a multiple of 5 is instantly killed.
 Learn:   From the blue, leech-like enemies (Parasite) in the Makou Pit.
          <Disc 3>
 Tip:     Simply use Control to command your foe and then choose the
          middle option if you want the Parasite to use Level 5 Death
          on one of your members.
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 STAR 21 - DEATH SENTENCE                                     COST - 10 MP

 Effect:  One enemy is Condemned (they die when the counter over their
          head reaches zero).
 Learn:   The yellow, spiked enemies (Bound Fat) that live in front of and
          in the area behind the Ancient City.  <Disc 1+>
 Tip:     You could control these guys, but if you kill one it will
          counterattack with this skill so it may be easier to simply
          off one, especially if you don't have the Ayatsuru materia.  If
          you do, then simply control them and pick the bottom option to
          use the Death Sentence.
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 STAR 22 - DEATH ROULETTE                                      COST - 6 MP

 Effect:  One friend or foe is randomly killed.
 Learn:   From the floating card-jesters (Death Dealer) in the Makou Pit
          if you take the right path the first time you meet your friends.
          <Disc 3>
 Tip:     You can control the Death Dealer and make him use Shi no
          Roulette on you by picking the second option when the enemy
          abilities window appears.  If it kills one of your enemies,
          you'll have to try again until the pointer lands on you.
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 STAR 23 - SHADOW FLARE                                      COST - 100 MP

 Effect:  A black flare hits a single opponent for magic damage.
 Learn:   From the flying black dragon in Disc 3; it uses it as a
          Counter Attackattack before dying.  Or, learn it from the Dragon
          Zombies in the Makou Pit.  <Disc 3>
 Tip:     If you're fighting the flying dragon, just kill it and it will
          use the Shadow Flare on you.  If you're trying to learn it from
          a Dragon Zombie, you'll have to wait until it uses it since you
          can't control them.
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 STAR 24 - WHAT???                                           COST - 110 MP

 Effect:  A star field and question mark appear; hits all enemies for
          physical damage.
 Learn:   From the huge, multi-limbed bone dragons (Dragon Zombie) in
          the Makou Pit if you take the right path the first time you
          meet your friends.  <Disc 3>
 Tip:     As the Dragon Zombies are uncontrollable, you'll simply have
          to keep fighting them until they use this skill on one of
          your characters.


 To learn an enemy skill, you must be equipped with a Teki no Waza (Learn
 Enemy Skill) yellow materia.  When an enemy hits you with it's special
 skill, you will learn it, even if it misses or kills you.  However,
 unless you win the battle, you won't keep the skill you've learned.
 There are 24 skills in all, and one of the 24 stars on the Materia Menu
 will light up as you get more enemy skills.  Note that you can't learn
 a skill and then have your player cast it on another person with a
 Teki no Waza; they _must_ learn it from enemies.  You'll know if you
 learned a skill because the character with the materia equipped will
 spin in a circle once and you'll get a message ending in an exclamation
 point.  Keep in mind that if you're controlling a monster to learn a
 particular skill, you'll have to target the character wearing the Teki
 no Waza in order to learn the skill.

 For those of you who would like a more definitive guide, here is a list
 that shows the earliest point at which you can learn each skill as you
 play through the game:


 DISC ONE  ______________________________________________________________

 Matora Magic     - from the Sweeper Customs after you've escaped from
                    Midgar City.
 Level 4 Self-... - from the Muus in the area around the Chocobo Farm.

                    reaching the Chocobo Farm.
 Fire Blaster     - from the Aakudoragons in the Mythril Mine (I tried to
                    learn it from the Mootaabooru boss, but I couldn't
                    get it, so....)
 White Wind       - from the Zemzeretts in the Junon Area (land between
                    the Fort Condor and Junon Town).
 Aqua Breath      - use the Gold Saucer vehicle to get attacked by a
                    Chimera in the dirt pit around the Saucer.

                    of the Westernmost Continent (just before entering

 Death Sentence   - from the Bound Fats found just before the Ancient
                    City.

 * If Yuffie hasn't joined you yet, then you can get these skills without
   worry.  But if she has joined your party, then she'll steal all your
   Materia, preventing you from learning these two skills until after
   you've completed her sub-quest and gotten your Teki no Waza materia
   back (along with the rest of your materia).

@node 95 "Learning limit breaks"

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
   @{b}9 . 5      l e a r n i n g   l i m i t   b r e a k s@{ub}
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A lot of people don't know how the process to learn Limit Breaks works,
 or they may not know how to learn all the Breaks.  Basically, the Limit
 Break mastery process goes like this:

  - Breaks are divided into four levels of power, and most characters
    have two Breaks per level, excluding level four (you only have one
    break for that level).

  - Each ally starts out with his first Level 1 break, so you don't
    have to fret over learning it.

  - But when you want to learn the second Limit Break of that particular
    level, you have to use the first break approximately:

        Ten times to get your second Level 1 break
        Eight times to get your second Level 2 break
        Six times to get you second Level 3 break

    You don't have to do this all in one battle, but you do have to kill
    the enemy your Break affects (if it is an attacking type of Break),
    Also, you do have to win the battle, since the new Limit Break you
    learn appears in the 'EXP/AP Gained' screen, although you don't have
    to be the one to kill the last opponent, as long as you killed at
    least one enemy with a Break.  I'm a little unsure when it comes to
    non-attacking breaks...I think you just have to use them a certain
    number of times (see above).

  - Once you have your second Break, your goal is to reach the next
    level of power (and get that level's first Break in the process).
    To do this, your character has to win 40 battles _on his own_.
    This means that if the other characters kill the enemies and you
    do nothing or only inflict damage, you won't reach the next level.
    You have to win the battle using your abilities (attacking, magic,
    Limit Breaks, items, etc.), although it's okay if other characters
    damage that enemy before you kill it.

  - Finally, there is the Level 4 Limit Break.  To learn it, you must
    have learned _all_ of that character's other breaks.  Furthermore,
    you must have a special manual (you can tell what it is since it
    has the same name as the Limit Break).  If you try to use the manual
    on another character, or on a character who has yet to learn all his
    or her breaks, you'll get a message in red and white.  But when you
    have filled all the requirements, simply using the manual on the
    correct person will automatically give them their last Break (don't
    forget to set that person's level to 4 so that you can use it in
    battle :))  Here are the locations of each character's manual:


    ---CLOUD STRIFE---
    You must earn 32,000 battle points at the Gold Saucer in _one visit_.
    You can then trade them in for the manual.

    ---BARRET WALLACE---
    Get it from a lady wearing a hat in one of the buildings in North
    Corel after the train ride in Disc 2.

    ---TIFA LOCKHEART---
    Go to Nivelheim and play the 'Highwind' theme twice on the piano in
    Tifa's house followed by L1+T (see section 8 for details).

    ---AERIS GAINSBOROUGH---
    Get 1xx wins in battle (where xx are two matching digits).  Then go
    to the cave where the sleeping man is and he'll give you the Mythril.
    Head to the blacksmith's house by the Gold Saucer, give him the
    Mythril, then climb up the stairs and examine the metal lid at the
    end of the walkway.  Once you get the Highwind, doing this is a snap.
    But Aeris will have already left you by then.  So, to get her
    manual while she's still in your party in Disc 1, do the following:

    Hop on the Gold Saucer Buggy.  If you haven't gotten it yet, keep
    playing until you've finished the Gold Saucer area.  Then pilot the
    Buggy _into_ Costa Del Sol.  You'll enter the town as if you had
    walked into it.  Go to the harbor and talk to the sailor by the boat.
    Choose the top option to pay 100 gil and you can then walk along the
    dock and enter a ship, which will return to Junon Town.  Although
    there's not much new here, you will get a different reaction from
    most people because you're no longer dressed up as a guard.  Anyway,
    once you exit the city (the fastest way is to take the helicopter--
    refer to the end of section 4e for details), you'll find that you've
    brought the Buggy with you!  From here, it's a simple matter of
    heading towards the river, crossing it at the ford below the
    waterfall, then heading up to the cave where the sleeping man is.
    And after getting the Mythril, you have to go _all_ the way back to
    the Eastern Continent so you can reach the blacksmith's house.
    Well, don't say I didn't warn you!

    ---RED XIII---
    Go to Nivelheim and unlock the safe in the right wing of Sephiroth's
    Mansion (use the code in section 8 if you don't know how).  You'll
    receive Red 13's manual from the boss when you defeat him.

    ---YUFFIE KISARAGI---
    Return to Wutai after completing Yuffie's sub-quest.  Head to the
    pagoda and beat the five bosses within--she'll get her manual once
    Godo is defeated in battle.

    ---VINCENT VALENTINE---
    Once you have the submarine or a Green, Black, or Gold Chocobo, go to
    the waterfall in the middle of the Western Continent.  If you enter
    the waterfall from the left side with Vincent in your party, he'll
    meet a girl from his past (Rukuresshia).  You have to visit the falls
    twice, once during Disc 2 and again in Disc 3; it's during your
    second visit that you'll get his manual.  Much to my surprise, I
    tried this and it _doesn't work_!  I've heard from more than one
    source that this is the correct method, so if someone can tell me
    what I did wrong, it'd be appreciated.  All I know is that I went
    to the room under the falls in Disc 3 and there's no one there,
    even when I stuck Vincent in my party.

    ---CID HIGHWIND---
    After you get a submarine, go underwater and search for the wrecked
    plane near the southern part of the World Map, between the Western
    and Eastern continents.  His manual is in one of the treasure chests
    inside the plane.


  - Note that Cait Sith only has two Limit Breaks; his inital one and
    one for Level 2.  You still learn it the normal way you'd learn
    the first break of a new level.  The same applies to Vincent, who
    has four Break levels but only one break per level.  All other
    characters have two breaks a level (but only one break for Level 4).

 Limit Breaks become stronger and stronger as you play.  This is due in
 part to your character's current level.  Limit breaks that inflict
 damage become stronger depending on your Attack Power as well, even
 ones like Cait's Dice attack (in which the damage amount can vary),
 and Vincent's transformations (even though he doesn't use his guns).
 At the very least, equipping a strong weapon will add to the basic
 amount of damage a Limit Break can inflict*.

 *   The only exception to this is Cait's Slot attack, when he summons
     a monster; damage is determined normally for this attack.  Remember,
     if the Break doesn't inflict damage, it isn't affected by your
     character's Attack Power.

   @{b}9 . 6      l i m i t   b r e a k   l i s t@{ub}
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------

 This is a list of each character's Limit Break, it's effect, and a brief
 description.  The letters and numbers mean the Break Level and which one
 it is (i.e. B3/1 is Level 3, 1st Break).


 ============
 Cloud Strife
 ============
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 B1/1: <Braver>  (Braver)

 Cloud dashes forward and performs a diving slash against one opponent.
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 B1/2: <Evil Omen Slash>  (Cross Slash)

 Cloud's three slashes create a symbol over his enemy.  When it fades
 away, that enemy is hit once.  It also has a chance of paralyzing the
 hit foe.
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 B2/1: <Breaking Clear Attack>

 Cloud sends a wave of green energy at the targeted foe.  When it hits,
 smaller waves shoot outward to hit each remaining foe, although the
 damage is less than the first, big wave.
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 B2/2: <Crime Hazard>

 Cloud sticks his sword into an enemy and then yanks it upwards while
 jumping for heavy damage.
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 B3/1: <Meteo Rain>

 Cloud twirls his sword and leaps into the air.  With one swing, he sends
 a shower of meteors down upon his foes, hitting 4 times.
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 B3/2: <Picture Dragon Finishing Touch>

 Creating a light at the tip of his sword, Cloud throws a funnel of rising
 air that sucks in all opponents for an instant kill attack. Those that
 survive are dropped to the ground for further physical damage.
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 B4/1: <Shotgun Ultimate War God Champion Slash>

 A column of wind surrounds Cloud and his sword lights up.  He then
 attacks all enemies for a total of 15 hits, finishing with a diving sword
 slash.  The sword strikes cause physical damage, while the last strike
 hits all foes.


 ==============
 Barret Wallace
 ==============
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 B1/1: <Heavy Shot>  (Heavy Shot)

 Collecting energy, Barret fires a huge fireball at one opponent.
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 B1/2: <Mind Break>

 Similar in appearance to the Heavy Shot, Barret launches a ball of azure
 energy at one opponent.  While it inflicts no damage, it completely
 drains that enemy of MP.
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 B2/1: <Grenade Bomb>

 Barret fires an invisible shot that explodes into a huge hemisphere of
 fire that damages all opponents.
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 B2/2: <Hammer Blow>

 Barret dashes forward and punches one enemy as purple waves emanate from
 his arm.  If it misses, this attack causes no damage, but if it hits,
 the enemy is instantly killed.
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 B3/1: <Satellite Beam>

 Barret locks on to his enemies and calls down beams of blue light to
 fry the opposition.  This attack hits for special damage.
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 B3/2: <Anger Max>

 Using his weapon like a machine gun, Barret fires repeated rounds of
 ammunition at all opponents.
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 B4/1: <Catastrophe>

 Steam erupts from Barret's weapon as he leaps into the air and fires an
 earth-scorching beam of yellow light at all his enemies.  This attack
 hits ten times in all for special damage.


 ===============
 Tifa Lockheart*
 ===============
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 B1/1: <Palm of Hand Strike Rush>

 A quick combination of punches.
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 B1/2: <Somersault>

 A somersault kick.
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A sweep kick that hits for water damage.
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 B2/2: <Meteo Drive>

 A back-slam.
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 B3/1: <Dolphin Blow>

 A rising uppercut accompanied by a geyser of water with a dolphin riding
 on top of it.
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 B3/2: <Meteo Strike>

 Tifa grabs her opponent, jumps in the air, and body-slams them as a
 huge explosion appears.
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 B4/1: <Final Heaven>

 Tifa strikes her enemy with a huge, exploding attack.

 *  Tifa's Limit Break works like this; the more Limit Breaks she learns,
    the more slots appear in the slot machine that picks the skill she
    uses (the abilities listed above).  When she gains a new Break, she
    is able to use a new attack.  She can learn up to 10 slots total.
    When picking a slot, there are three outcomes: HIT, which makes Tifa
    perform one of the above attacks, YEAH!, which works like HIT but
    increases the damage inflicted, and MISS, which makes Tifa do nothing.
    Tifa will then proceed to perform all the moves you end up with in
    a row.  She will randomly switch to a new enemy (or stay with the one
    she's attacking) for each new move.


 ===================
 Aeris Gainsborough
 ===================
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 B1/1: <Healing Wind>

 Aeris creates an encircling wind that restores a large amount of lost
 HP to herself and her friends.
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 B1/2: <Wicked Spirit Sealed>

 Purple lights fly into all of Aeris's opponents.  This attack causes
 no damage but has the same effect as 'Stop' and 'Silence' on all of them.
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 B2/1: <Earth's Breath>

 Streams of blue light wrap around the allies, curing status ailments.
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 B2/2: <Angry Brand>

 Aeris waves her staff, causing blue lightning to hit herself and her
 allies, followed by yellow, circular lights.  This will instantly max
 out the other characters' Limit gauges.
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 B3/1: <Guardian Star>

 Stars rotate around Aeris and her friends as the screen turns yellow,
 making them invincible for a short while.
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 B3/2: <Life Beat>

 Aeris kneels and prays; every ally's status ailments are cured and they
 gain back all lost HP and MP.
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 B4/1: <Great Word of God>

 Rain falls upon Aeris and her companions.  It is replaced by a bright
 sky where three angels can be seen floating around.  All allies have
 their HP and MP restored, and are made invincible for a short time.

 Swirls of blue energy surround Red 13, who tackles his opponent for
 physical damage.
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 B1/2: <Lunatic High>

 It has the same affect as 'Haste'.  Each ally is also 'powered up' (?).
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 B2/1: <Blood Fang>

 Swirls of energy surround Red 13, who tackles his opponent.  In addition
 to striking for physical damage, Red is healed for a small amount of HP
 and also gains back some MP as well.

 A field of stars replaces the background.  Red 13 howls and a shower of
 blue lights rain down on all opponents striking twelve times.

 affected by Berserk and Haste at the same time.
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 B3/2: <Earth Rave>

 Red 13 attacks the enemy with jumping bites and claw scratches.  Each
 time he attacks, balls of fire burst forth and shower over the enemy.
 This attack hits five times for physical and fire damage.
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 B4/1: <Cosmo Memory>

 Red 13 summons a flare into which a field of stars and balls of fire are
 absorbed.  The flare then explodes in a ray of Fire followed by an
 explosion that hits all foes for fire damage.


 ===============
 Yuffie Kisaragi
 ===============
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 B1/1: <Gale Lightningclap>

 Yuffie slashes once with her weapon, causing no damage.  A second slash
 mark then appears and her opponent is hit for physical damage.
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 B1/2: <Clear Mirror, Still Water>

 Globes of water surround Yuffie and her companions.  When they pop open,
 each character regains some HP.
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------

 enemy.  The ground buckles, then explodes, inflicting earth damage.

 times for physical damage.

 light bursts upward, hitting every one for special dmaage.
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The screen turns blue as Yuffie leaps from enemy to enemy, striking for
 a total of 15 hits.  With each hit, purple light flashes from her weapon.
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 B4/1: <Universe>

 Yuffie creates a swirling circular mass of red, purple, and white light.
 Out of it fires a large beam of white light that damages all enemies for
 special damage.


 =========
 Cait Sith
 =========
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 B1/1: <Dice>

 Cait's stuffed moogle throws several dice to the ground.  The score that
 is rolled determines how much damage the targeted enemy will receive.
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 B2/1: <Slot>

 A slot machine appears.  Depending on what you pick, a different result
 will occur:

  - <Name of summoned monster>                                      3 bars
    Cait Sith randomly calls upon a summoned monster.
