       HOW TO INSTALL ALL ADI-JUNIOR DISKS & APPLICATIONS ON A HARD DRIVE
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                                   Typed by:

                                  ~~~~~~~~~~~

Despite the manual saying you can only install on a hard drive if you have a PC,
here's how to put it on an Amiga HD:

Make a directory called ADIJNR in a hard drive partition.  Go on, you might as
well give it an icon at the same time, I suppose.

Copy all files from the ENVIRONMENT disk (E1) and any application disks you
have to this directory.

Copy all the files from any application disks you have to the same directory.

Write the following script file in a text-editor:

                     Assign ADIJNR: (your partition):ADIJNR
                     ADIJNR:kid lg_gb

Save the file out as 'Start', and stick it in the same directory as the other ADI stuff.

Find the file 'Start' you've just written with DirOpus etc, and make it a script
file (use Opus - 'Protect' then 'script'; the shell, or another equivalent).

Add an icon to 'Start' and make sure the default tool is set to 'Sys:c/IconX'.

Save it, and you're nearly ready to go....open your partition and click on the
icons.

If the prgram isn't cracked you'll need to enter the correct codes from one of
the booklets.  I have typed these things out (see below - or in the other
files, if this text has been split up by the docs disk chappies).  Note: ADI
Junior reading 6-7 wasn't cracked properly by LSD - only the first protection
check was disabled.  When using the reading Applications, you had to guess the
code - and there's lots of 'em!!).

On the main House screen you can click on most bits of the picture.  Some of
these play set animations and others open up an activity.  These are easy for
most young children to understand, especially if an adult helps them through
things the first time around, so I won't bother to type out the manual for this
screen.  When your child wants to get on with the serious stuff, click on the
door of the house to access the Applications.  You must have the relevant
reading or counting application disks to get any further.  I have typed out the
docs for these Applications (see below - or in the other files, if this text has
been split up by the docs disk chappies).

The first time you are asked to insert any 'user disk' or 'new disk' (ie, any
Application disk), you'll actually have to stuff the relevant floppy into DF0:,
then hit return.  When you quit, it remembers which application disks you have,
so next time you won't have to bother shoving in the floppies; press return then
click on the relevant box and it will find them on your HD ('cos you copied ALL
files to the ADIJNR dir, didn't you??!!).  You must use the first Application
disk in a series before using the second (ie, you must use disk R6 [for jnr
reading 6-7 years] and wait for the prompt to insert disk R62 [a bit later].  As
I said, once you've bunged in a floppy and quit, you can throw the disk away, as
it will look an your HD from then on....

If you want to check your progress, ahmmmm..I mean your kids progress, press F10
at any time on the House screen to get a summary of how they're doing - you can
click on each status line to get more detail and confirm they're as thick as you
thought they were!  If you press F10 when in an application, you'll get some
instructions/explanations for the bit you're looking at.

That's all I can be bothered with for now - I'm off to my pit.  Have fun with
your new toy.

The National Curriculum in English is split into five attainment targets (ATs).
These are: speaking and listening, reading, writing, spelling and handwriting.

Of all these targets, reading is the one which most people regard as
fundamental.  If children cannot read they cannot write or spell, because they
have no knowledge of the written word or the letters making these words.

The more children practise their reading and the more fluent they become, the
easier all the other components of the National Curriculum in English will be.
When working on written English, children will be able to concentrate much
better on producing good written work if they can read and spell words fluently.

If they work with adults and discuss their work with them, they will develop
their speaking and listening skills, and then use these to improve their
vocabulary and written English.

The following table shows how Reading with ADI Junior relates to the National
Curriculum in English:

Counting with ADI Junior Maths has been written for pupils from Year 2 up to 7
years of age.  The work leads to attainment targets 1-3 of Key Stage 1 of the
National Curriculum in Maths (see below), and is built around the exciting theme
of a fairground.  Here, children can explore the games and practise the skills
needed for their Key Stage 1 assignments in maths.

Children of average ability would expect to achieve Level 2 in an Assignment.
Those of above average ability would achieve Level 3.  The higher levels of
games are designed to extend the more able children.

The following table shows how ADI Junior Maths 6-7 relates to the National
