                                 (Level 9)

      (Later released as Part 3 of the 'Jewels Of Darkness' trilogy)





Before  commencing  this  adventure  it  is  important  to  understand  the

'teleport' system as this saves a lot of trudging about. There are a number

of  coloured  collars  hidden  throughout  the game, and an equal number of

pedestals  with  the corresponding coloured light shining upon them, placed

at strategic locations. The colours are on the scale of the colour spectrum

(i.e: Red, Orange, Yellow, etc, through to Gold and Mithril).



Take  and  wear a coloured collar, go to a pedestal location then 'UP'. Say

any  colour,  up  to  an  including  the  colour of the collar that you are

currently  wearing,  and  you  will  teleport to the corresponding coloured

pedestal.



To  teleport  to  'higher'  coloured  pedestals,  you  must  be wearing the

'higher'  coloured collar. Be careful when teleporting to the BLUE pedestal

as  this is located in the Wight's House and you must be carrying the cross

and crucifix to force them away when you descend from the pedestal!



Maximum use of this system is made throughout this solution.



A COUPLE OF 'RANDOM' OCCURENCES BEFORE YOU START!!

(1) The Roc will carry you to it's nest from any of the locations indicated

on  Map  7.  If  it doesn't strike at the point shown in the solution, then

move towards the nest location until it does, then proceed as shown.



(2)  The  boulders  falling  down  the stairs always occur when you have at

least  TWO  MOVES to a place of safety (See Maps). If and when you are told

that  there is a sound of boulders from ABOVE, then seek the NEAREST gulley

and  'WAIT' until it passes safely. You are then safe to proceed UPWARDS as

the boulder rolls away BELOW you!



Finally,  you  have a limited number of moves in daylight, at the start.You

must find a temporary light source BEFORE SUNSET to carry on and enable you

to  locate  a  more permanent light source. Following this solution EXACTLY

will allow enough time to achieve this.
