PART THREE: POLTERGEIST



You  awake  at the start of the third night wondering if you are now strong

enough  to  bend  metal  and manifest to mortals. There is a priest bending

over the grave with two members of the gang, preparing to exorcise you.



Go west so you aren't exorcised. You can't return to your grave either as a

free  spirit  or  by  being  sent  there  by  light as you will be banished

forever.



The crooks arrive and say they'll go and get the drugs so follow them. They

collect them, get into the van and it leaves.



It  drives to a farm. They park in a barn and enter the house but you can't

because  of  the  light inside. You realise it's their hideout and that you

must  not  only  help the police get there without being seen but also save

the evidence. You get a hint during the trip about the possibility of power

cuts.



Near the farm is a shed with a generator and at the back of the farm house,

some  dangerous-looking  connectors with exposed wires. You can't enter the

barn as it's the place you died and the pain drives you back.



Examine  hay  to  find  a  sprayer  and  get  it. Go to connectors and "HIT

CONNECTORS  WITH  SPRAYER"  to short them out. One crook comes out to start

the  generator but says it won't give much power. Go into the house and you

realise  you  can  charge things with static and manifest yourself. Examine

the  cupboard  in the hall to see a circuit breaker. "PULL BREAKER" so they

can't put the lights back on properly.



The  gang  are  in  the  kitchen  playing cards. There is a briefcase there

containing drugs and you know you'll need it as evidence.



John goes up to the attic to act as look-out and Sarah is taken down to the

cellar, tied up and gagged.



Follow John to the attic. The window looks out over the countryside and you

know you must distract John so he doesn't see the police. You also know you

must  do  this five times. Don't distract him till you see movement outside

the  window  and  also don't do it straight away as you have to "DRAG" this

bit  out  a bit! If you wait too long, he will spot the police and warn the

others so you must time it so you do it just before he gets suspicious.



At  the  right  time, get bulb and drop it; the darkness and noise frighten

him. Get the broken glass.



Go  down  to the cellar door. You can't carry anything if you float through

the door so wait till Weasel arrives to check on Sarah. Go in when he does,

drop  the  glass and go back to the attic. At the right time, distract John

again - charge the holder so the static makes his hair stand on end.



Go  back  to the cellar. "MANIFEST" so Sarah can see you and hear you, then

"CUT ROPE" using the glass. She goes and puts the hammer on the shelf above

the  door  and  goes  back to her chair, pretending to still be tied up. Go

back  to the door and wait till Weasel arrives again. When he enters, "PUSH

HAMMER"; it hits him.



Sarah comes through. "MANIFEST" again and "SARAH, TIE WEASEL"; she ties him

up. Leave and she follows you, bolting the door behind her.



Go  up to the hall and she looks at the cupboard and says she ought to find

somewhere  to hide. "SARAH, GO TO TAXI, DEFLATE TYRES, GO TO CUPBOARD, HIDE

IN  IT,  WAIT  20".  She  goes  off  to  do it. You can't deflate the tyres

yourself as the taxi is in the barn where you were killed.



Go  back  towards  the  attic  and on the way you see a creaky stair. "PUSH

STAIR"  to  frighten John so long as it's the right time. Go into the attic

and wait for movement outside again, then "BLOW CURTAINS". Wait again until

the  time  is  right  and  "COOL  JOHN"  to  scare  him the fifth time. Now

"MANIFEST";  he  is  petrified  and  fires  his  gun at you. The others run

upstairs  to  see  what's  wrong,  leaving  the  briefcase unguarded in the

kitchen.



Go  back  to  the  hall  and  "MANIFEST".  "SARAH,  E, GET CASE, W, HIDE IN

CUPBOARD, WAIT 20". This is because the case is too heavy for you to carry.

She goes, does it and returns.



The  crooks will now get ready to leave the farm but because the police are

now so close, they won't be able to get away, so long as you slow them down

a bit more. If you have previously examined John, you know his jacket has a

pocket  which  contains the key to the van. Go out to the van and "LET DOWN

TYRES".



When  the crooks get to the van, they don't have time to inflate the tyres.

Wait  till John arrives and "BEND KEY".  They don't have time to straighten

it  so  they  make  a  dash for it over the fields where the police capture

them.



Severian and the Professor go to the taxi. When it gets out of the barn, it

is  going  slowly  because  of  the  flat tyres so "GET INTO TAXI". Inside,

"MANIFEST";  you  fight  with  Severian and because the tyres are flat, the

taxi  slides  and  crashes.  The police catch the two of them when they run

away.



The  evidence  is  recovered  and Sarah is safe and so can give evidence to

clear your name.
