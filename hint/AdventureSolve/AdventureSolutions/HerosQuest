NOTES
The events taking place in this adventure do not follow a strict order. For
this  reason,  the player is only given a detailed description of moves for
the  FIRST  day.  It  is  necessary  as a FIGHTER to build up your power by
fighting as many creatures and humanoids as possible.

Before  fighting Wizard Cobalt and entering the Brigand's Fortress you MUST
have a very high power.

The  best place to spend the night is Erana's Peace.If you sleep there your
health and stamina reach their top.

You  can get money by killing Goblins and Brigands and then searching their
bodies.  You  can  also  get large amounts of money by killing Centaurs and
Trolls and then selling their claws and beards to the Healer.

Note that Centaurs and Trolls only appear in the night and 'large' power is
needed in order to kill them.

Every  time  you  kill  a  Goblin  at  Goblin's  Lair, bear in mind that an
additional one will appear next time you fight them in this area.

Zombies appear at the Cemetery during the night so beware!

If you need stones from the ground, type: "GET ROCKS".

The sequential periods of the adventure day, as it elapses throughout the
game are as follows:

1.DAY IS DAWNING
2.MID MORNING
3.MIDDAY
