    PARTS TWO & THREE. (Preliminary notes:- You now know that you are

    wearing a visor. Lifting it up will reveal the 'true world' and in it's

    lowered position shows you the 'adventure world'. It is a larger

    version of Reveline's dream from 'Worm in Paradise'. You do not score

    points for collecting the silver objects and as such it is advisable to

    wait until you are ready to tackle the Troll to avoid characters

    stealing your treasures. The spell names will be shown in brackets

    after you first encounter them, i.e.,EXAMINE WALL ['COLD']).

    GET SCALE

    FIND DRAGON (the Dragon will by now  be subdued as the mouse will

    attack it's weak spot when you meet it!)

    SAVE.

     (The following part can take several attempts to get right as success

    depends on how much the Valkyrie is carrying when you die. As such it

    is easier to give the principles involved and let the player work out

    how best to solve it! First find the Valkyrie by using the "LOCATE"

    spell or a directional command (RUN TO, FIND or GO TO). If she is on a

    cloud, you may have to kill someone to get her to leave the cloud. When

    you find her, give her the card from the mousehole and kill yourself!

    If it works right, you will arrive in Paradise. Now, take the card from

    the Valkyrie if she's collected too much this gets dropped and you will

    have to try again lift the visor, open the door and take the

    recruiter/reprogrammer).

    EXAMINE AMBER

    [MAGICIAN]

    FIND SACK

    TAKE SACK

    SAVE.

     (Now you have to recruit the Troll so having got the sack, go in

    search of as many silver objects as you can find. The easiest way is to

    use the "GO TO (Location)" command and press 'SPACE' whenever you see a

    silver object. Put them in the sack and carry on until you have about 8

    or 9 treasures or you could use "FIND (object)" to locate the

    following:

    SPOON/STAR/LOAF/CANDLESTICK/FOX/HARE/PLATE/SLIVER/SALVER/FISH/SIXPENCE.





    The actual 'mechanics' of the Troll puzzle are not particularly simple

    as the Troll jealously guards the bridge and you may not succeed at

    first if too many people are trying to cross the bridge. First go to

    the bridge and 'SAVE' your position. Now it is a matter of getting the

    Troll far enough away from the bridge so you can get into her lair! To

    do this, give her a treasure and 'WAIT' until she takes it. Move back

    away from the bridge and 'WAIT' until the Troll enters, drop another

    treasure, 'WAIT' until she takes it, move away and so on.......until

    you are alnmost out of treasure. Drop all your remaining treasures and

    RUN TO BRIDGE, open the door, enter her lair and take the wallet.

    Answer "NO" to her question and you can recruit her. Once recruited,

    you will find that when she has been given an order she will carry it

    out until you tell her to stop!!).
