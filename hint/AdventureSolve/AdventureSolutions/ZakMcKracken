Notes.
(1)  If  someone  other  than  Zak  is  to perform the actions listed for a
location,  that  person's name appears in brackets following the location's
name.
(2) After the first trip to the Airport and on the plane, the solution just
names  your next destination, omitting instructions to take the bus and use
the Reservations Terminal.
(3) There are several jungle mazes that are randomised and therefore cannot
be  mapped. In these, just keep taking turns off the path (instead of going
through the far left or right side exit) when possible, until you arrive at
your destination.
(4)  Certain  characters  must  do  some  things, such as Annie reading the
scroll, but most may be performed by anyone.
