PART TWO: HAUNTED HOUSE



You  start  the  next  night  by  your grave, aware of a house north of the

cemetery.  You  must find the gang's hideout. Joe says you can probably now

heat  and cool things and also reach through solid objects. He says he will

come with you to find the crooks.



To  pass the green safely, go to the south green and wait till you see pale

headlights.  Go  south  and north. You now see red tail lights heading away

from you and Joe says it's now safe to cross.



Outside  the  house, Joe says if you concentrate you might be able to bring

back  visions  of what happened. If you "CONCENTRATE" in various locations,

you  will  see  what  happened.  You  see yourself burying something in the

garden, you shooting one of the crooks in the hall, the crooks clearing the

house  and  burning papers in the fireplace, one piece being trapped in the

chimney  shaft,  two  crooks  taking their dead comrade's body upstairs and

returning  without  it and then you being hit and taken from the house. The

visions  leave  you  unsure as to whether or not Sarah, your colleague, was

working with the crooks.



After  your  vision  of you burying something in the herb garden, "DIG" and

you unearth your plastic ID card. Get it and drop it in the hallway.



"EXAMINE DIRECTORY" in the hall to find a bookmark. EXAMINE it; it's an old

envelope  showing the postmark of the village near the crooks' new hideout.

You  can't get it on your own so "JOE, WAIT, GET BOOKMARK", "GET BOOKMARK".

Now drop it in hall.



By  the garden is a stream but the water makes you nervous. On the water is

a  branch  and  on  the  branch  is a map. To get the map, "COOL WATER", it

freezes. Get the map, examine it; it shows the crooks' new hideout.



To  get the paper from the chimney, it's too high up to get from inside and

Joe  says  it  might  be  better  to  try from the other side. If you reach

through  the wall from inside, Joe says it must look funny from outside. If

you  reach  through  the wall from the outside (by the ivy), you don't know

where you are reaching.

Joe  says  he wonders if he could help. Go back inside, "JOE, WAIT 5, REACH

THROUGH  WALL".  Go  back to the ivy and wait till Joe's hand waves through

the  wall.  Now  if you "REACH INTO WALL" you know where the chimney is and

dislodge  the  paper. Go back to the lounge and get the paper. It shows all

the  first  names  of  the  gang - it's a list of their gambling debts. You

realise it will help the police find out their full names by narrowing down

their search. Drop paper in hall.



If you try to go upstairs, the ghost of Luke, the crook you killed, attacks

you  and  Joe  saves  you.  To  get  rid of him, you must turn on the light

upstairs  but  not  downstairs  (as that will affect you.) so in hall, "GET

BULB,  DROP  IT,  PUSH  SWITCH";  the  light goes on upstairs and the ghost

screams  and  vanishes.  But  now  the light upstairs stops you going up or

turning  off  the  switch  downstairs.  You must fuse the lights. Go to the

kitchen, "GET BULB, DROP IT, GET FUSE, PUT FOIL IN HOLDER, PUSH SWITCH" and

the fuse blows. You can now go upstairs.



In  the  tank in the attic, if you "CONCENTRATE", you see Luke's body being

put  in  the  tank.  You  find  it in the tank and push off the lid in your

panic.



Get plug, go to the bathroom. You see a mirror. "THROW PLUG AT MIRROR"; the

mirror  breaks, you see an alcove behind. In it is a briefcase. Get it. Joe

says  you  have  enough  evidence,  now  you  must  work out how to get the

police.



Drop  all  evidence  in  the hall - the paper, bookmark, briefcase, map and

card.



You  have  to  summon  the  fire  service  and  bring the evidence to their

attention  or  they will just kick it out of the way. To do this, go to the

attic  carrying  the  plug and either "FREEZE PLUG TO BODY" or "TIE PLUG TO

BODY".  Get  the socket, go to the clock, "OPEN PANEL, PUT SOCKET IN PANEL,

CLOSE  PANEL".  Then  "PUSH  CLOCK"; it falls down the stairs and drags the

body  down behind it. Go to kitchen, "PUSH BOTTLE"; whisky vapour fills the

room.  "LIGHT VAPOUR, BLOW CURTAINS"; the fire gets a grip, firemen arrive,

see the body and realise he was not killed in the fire.



They call the police.
