PART ONE: NOVEMBER GRAVEYARD



The  last thing you remember is driving in the car with Sarah on the way to

your  meet  with  the drugs gang. All your undercover work was about to pay

off.  Now  you  find  yourself  standing  by your own grave, with a priest,

mourners  and  a  detective.  One of the policemen there says he's glad the

funeral  is over, this is the part of the work he hates - going to funerals

for  stupid  bastards who get themselves killed and their partner captured.

Another agrees and says that it's only because Mr Severian stumbled on them

dumping  Alan's  body  that the crooks needed a hostage, otherwise the girl

would be dead.



EXAMINE  DETECTIVE;  Severian,  a  new  recruit  to  the  drugs squad. He's

carrying  a matchbook and newspaper. From what he says, talking to himself,

you  realise he's one of the crooks. He set you up and because you're dead,

you're a convenient scapegoat.



No-one suspects what has happened. If you follow him, he pats the vaults on

his way out of the graveyard and mutters:"Who'd think of looking in there".

You realise it's where he stashed the drugs. It's up to you to do something

so  that the crooks can't pick up the drugs that evening to give the police

time to complete their investigations.



EXAM  VAULT;  You  see  a flash of white and inside you see a pile of white

plastic  bags.  EXAM BAGS; the sort you get from high street shops but they

contain narcotics.



After  a  while, a spotlight comes on in the graveyard and the shock of the

lights  sends  you back to your grave. When you recover, Joe Danby turns up

and  offers  to  show you around. He introduces you to the other ghosts and

then asks to walk round with you.



The  first  thing  you must do is to build up your strength. You do this by

picking  up  small,  light  things  to  start with and gradually picking up

heavier  and  heavier items. When you pick up your first thing, Joe says it

won't  be  long before you can lift something worthwhile. You can only pick

up one thing at a time.



Start  with the thistledown, leaf or petal and pick up two of them in total

to start increasing your strength. Then get matchbook and pebble.



Go  towards  the shed area and you will find a dog. It is making odd noises

and  has  something  (a  bone)  stuck in its throat. "PAT DOG" three times,

following it if necessary till it knows you're a friend. "GET BONE".



Go  to  David.  He  is  very  scathing about your lack of abilities to move

things. "PUSH URN"; it moves, David is impressed and says he will help.



The  Willmots  are  arguing  over a wreath which Edna says is hers but Bert

won't  let her have. Go to the faded wreath.  On it is a card showing it is

Edna's. Get the yellow card. Go to your grave, get the white card from your

new  wreath  and  drop  it.  Get  the  yellow card again, put it on the new

wreath.  Try  to  get  the new wreath. You can't but the dog can. Go to the

Willmots  and  "WAIT FOR DOG". Edna says the cards on the wreaths are wrong

but is still happy about it. The Willmots will now help you.



Get  them  all  to  follow  you  and  go to the shed. "EXAM LOCK"; it has a

barrel,  short  lever,  medium lever and long lever. All the levers must be

moved out of the way before the door will open.



"JOE,  WAIT  3, PUSH LONG LEVER", "BERT, WAIT 2, PUSH MEDIUM LEVER", "EDNA,

WAIT, PUSH SHORT LEVER", "DAVID, TURN BARREL".



They  do  so and the door is now unlocked. Try to pull the rope and the dog

helps.  The  door  opens and the dog enters, grabs the bag of biscuits from

inside as his reward and goes off to eat them.



From talking to Violet before, you know she is afraid to leave her grave in

case  she  can't  find  it  again  because she was blind in life. She wants

something  by  it  to  make a noise. Inside shed, "GET BELL", go to Violet.

"PUT BELL ON BUSH"; it makes a noise so she can now leave her grave.



To  turn  off  the spotlight and enable you to go further south through the

graveyard,  "JOE,  WAIT,  PUSH  BUTTON",  "PUSH BUTTON"; the spotlight goes

off.



To  get  rid of the vandals, in the shed "PUSH SWITCH"; the vandals flee as

the light goes on. "PUSH SWITCH" again to turn it off. The colonel will now

follow you.



To  help  Edith, she says she is cursed to remain by her grave till the end

of  time. Joe says you must demonstrate the end of time to her. "GET WATCH"

from  shed,  go to Edith, "PUT WATCH IN VASE"; it breaks thus demonstrating

the end of time! She will now follow you.



Go  to  the  sundial and "JOE, PUSH SUNDIAL", "PUSH SUNDIAL"; it breaks and

you  can  get  the  gnomon. Go to the bushes and examine them. You can tell

there's  something  in  there.  "SEARCH  BUSHES"  to  find  a  copy of Time

magazine.



Go  to  the  stonework  and  examine  it  to see a statue that looks like a

sleeping  man.  "WAKE STATUE"; you hit it and it wakes. It's another ghost,

Alex Pym.



Go  to  the wall which is leaning and "PUSH WALL". Everyone helps. The wall

collapses  and  traps  the  drugs so the dealers can't get them that night,

giving you time to find their hideout and clear your name.
