PART ONE: AS LARRY

At the start of the game you find yourself at Vista Point. LOOK THROUGH THE
BINOCULARS  on  the  LEFT of the screen, then READ THE PLAQUE. Exit through
the bottom right of the screen and follow the pointing finger to the House.
After  listening  to  what  Kalalau has to say, go EAST then EAST again and
change  into  your  leisure suit. Now go EAST again and follow the pointing
finger to your Office.

After  you  have  been sacked, return to your house and OPEN THE MAILBOX on
the  wall.  LOOK  in it and TAKE THE LETTER. You now have a CREDIT CARD. Go
EAST and there will be a PIECE OF WOOD on the ground, TAKE IT.

Now you must go EAST and SOUTH and you will find yourself on a BEACH with a
girl.  Walk  up  to  her, LOOK at her and GIVE HER your CREDIT CARD and you
will  get  a KNIFE. TAKE THE KNIFE and go EAST and SHARPEN the knife on the
steps.  You  must  then  exit  TOP LEFT and you will be in the Jungle. From
here,  go  behind  the bush on the right of the screen and WALK RIGHT. Here
you will find some grass. CUT it with the KNIFE and WEAVE it. You must also
CARVE the piece of WOOD.

Go  EAST  and enter the Comedy Club and SIT at the centre table. Leave when
you  have heard all the jokes. You now have to go to the Changing Cabana so
return  to  the screen with the fountain on it and exit top right and enter
the  cubicle  on  the  LEFT.  WEAR  the grass skirt then go to the drinking
fountain. Take the SOAP and turn the faucet (tap!!) to get a drink.

Return to the Beach and SELL the WOOD CARVING to the girl and she will give
you  twenty  dollars.  Go  back  to the Cabana and change into your leisure
suit.  Go  WEST  and go UP the steps into the Casino. Go NORTH (twice) then
WEST  and LOOK IN THE MIRROR, then WEST again. TALK to the man and SHOW him
your PASS in the 'Nontoonyt Tonite' magazine, then give him the MONEY.

After  the show has finished, WAIT until you see Cherri Tart. Go UP to her,
LOOK  at  her and TALK to her a few times then SELL her the land she wants.
After  she  has  left,  come out of the Casino and visit Dewey, Cheatem and
Howe  and  ask for Suzi. When you are in her office SIT on the sofa and ask
for a LAND DEED. After she tells you about it, leave and WAIT outside for a
while then go back inside and ask the man at the desk for it.

Go back to where you met Cherri Tart, KNOCK on the door and WAIT. After the
following  scene  go  back and visit Suzi Cheatem while you're dressed as a
showgirl.  Then  go back to where you made love to Cherri, get your clothes
and go back to Dewey, Cheatem and Howe to get your divorce decree. While it
is  being  prepared,  WAIT  outside for a while then go back inside and get
it.

Now you have to go back to the Casino, but go RIGHT instead of LEFT. In the
Piano  Bar  you  will see Passionate Patti. Sit next to her and LOOK at her
then give her the DECREE and you will get a KEYCARD for Fat City.

On the way to Fat City, go to the Beach and get the TOWEL. In Fat City, USE
THE  KEYCARD  in  the  LEFT-HAND  door.  In  the Locker Room, TURN OVER the
KEYCARD and you will get the name of three businesses. LOOK these up in the
'Nontoonyt  Tonite' magazine and note the page numbers that they appear on.
This  is  the COMBINATION for your locker. When you have found your locker,
open  it  with the combination and wear the sweats. Close the locker and go
through the RIGHT-HAND door at the top of the screen and you will be in the
Weights  Room.  Here  you must use EACH machine EIGHT TIMES to lose weight,
and  when  you do return to your locker, open it, undress, close the locker
and go through the LEFT door into the Shower.

In  the  Shower, walk to the TOP of the screen and TURN IT ON. Walk back to
the  CENTRE  and USE THE SOAP from the Cabana, then turn the shower off and
walk out. Go back to your locker, open it, dry yourself with the towel from
the Beach, USE THE DEODORANT in the locker and wear your leisure suit.

Exit  the  locker room and USE THE KEYCARD to go through the top door. Walk
to the edge of the stage and LOOK AT THE GIRL. TALK to her a few times then
offer to help with her video. She will then do something for you!

After  making  love to Bambi, go to where you found the grass and enter the
Cave on the LEFT, pick the flowers and make them into a Lei. Now go back to
Patti  and  sit  down.  LOOK at her and give her the lei. She will then ask
what you want. Ask her for a date. Patti will now give you her room key and
ask for a drink. To get this you have to return to the Comedy Hut and there
will  be  a bottle sitting on the table. Take it, go back to the Casino and
go RIGHT then enter the lift. In the lift, PUSH BUTTON NINE and you will be
taken to Patti's apartment. POUR the WINE and viola!!.....you have finished
the first half of the game!!


PART TWO: AS PATTI

When  you  wake up, you will be Patti! Walk behind the screen and wear your
panties, bra, pantyhose and dress then take the bottle of wine on the tray.
Go  back to the Piano Bar, take the glass of tips and the magic marker that
is  on  the board. Now go to the Cabana and fill the wine bottle with water
from  the  drinking  fountain.  Go to where you found the grass earlier and
talk to the man by the door. Give him the glass of tips and he will let you
in.  Go in, sit down and, while Dale is on stage, throw your panties to him
and applaud!! After the show, wait for him and he will talk to you and give
you a few hints.

Leave  the  place and go EAST and EAST again, then enter the Bamboo Forest.
When  you  are  in the Forest, it doesn't matter which way you go, but when
Patti  is  on the THIRD STAGE OF DEHYDRATION, DRINK the bottle of water and
you will get through.

When you are through the Forest, walk to the River Bank and DRINK the water
then go NORTH. Now you have to get down the cliff. To do this you must take
off  your  pantyhose  and tie them to the large rock at the Cliff Edge then
climb over.

After  getting  down the cliff, you will find yourself on a ledge. Here you
must  pick  the  marijuana  leaves and make them into a rope. Then you must
climb the palm tree and pick the coconuts, then climb down again.

Stand  close  to  the  ledge and THROW the rope at the rock on the opposite
side. Then tie the rope to the tree. Now you have to make a safety harness.
To do this you have to TEAR the HEM of your DRESS. Now you can safely cross
the Ravine. When you get across, exit NORTH.

On  the  next  screen, you have to take off your bra and when the feral pig
attacks  you,  you  must put the coconuts in your bra and throw your bra at
the pig! When you have killed it, walk to the River Bank.

Walk  into the river and you will see something sticking out of the rushes.
This is a log and you have to PULL it then RIDE it.

The  next bit is a VERY HARD and VERY LONG arcade section!! Just keep going
and do plenty of [SAVE GAMES].

When  you have done this you will be captured and you will find yourself in
a  cage with Larry. You have to DRAW A DOOR with the MAGIC MARKER you found
in the Piano Bar then go through it!!

The  final  section of the game takes place in the Sierra Studios; when you
have  control,  walk EAST and EAST again and you will start floating. Float
over to the machine and when you are over it, PULL THE PLUG and walk EAST.

You will then get a long scene showing you the END OF THE GAME!!!!!
