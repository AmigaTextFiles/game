                             (Sierra On-Line)





This  is  the  most  efficient way to complete the game. It is not the most

enjoyable way to do it.....just the fastest!!



NORTH is always assumed to be towards the top of your screen, SOUTH towards

the  bottom,  East  to the right and WEST to the left. Words printed within

"QUOTATION MARKS" are to be typed into the computer EXACTLY as shown.



                               THE SOLUTION



After  exiting  your Escape Pod, go SOUTH to where the Acme Rocket ship is.

Then  go  EAST until you find the vertical conveyor with the buckets moving

upwards.  Walk up as close as possible to where these buckets are. You will

get scooped up by one of them and carried up to a horizontal conveyor belt.

Quickly type "STAND UP" and then "JUMP". You will jump up and pull yourself

up on to the rail. Walk WEST until you find yourself in a Control Room with

a  Robot.  (If  you  stand  around too long you will get shot!). There is a

machine  here called a Grabber hanging on the rail. Walk directly above the

Grabber and "CLIMB DOWN". Press your left arrow key and reverse the Grabber

up  to the platform that extends out at the bottom of the screen (press the

arrow  key  a second time to stop the Grabber). "EXIT GRABBER". Walk SOUTH.

You will SAFELY fall through a chute which leads to a hollowed-out Cave.



This  is  the  Rat's Lair. Walk as far WEST as possible (you will almost be

out  of  sight) and "LOOK WALL". You will find a hole with a Reactor in it.

"GET  REACTOR".  Walk  EAST  and  "CLIMB LADDER". After climbing out of the

Rat's  Lair,  "GET THE LADDER". Remember this spot because you will have to

come back to it later! Go NORTH and then EAST into the remains of the Space

Tanker.  Walk  through  the  tunnel. One of the Rats will ambush you in the

tunnel  and  take  the  Reactor  away from you. You will have to go back to

where  you  climbed up the ladder out of the Rat's Lair and "LOWER LADDER".

Now, "CLIMB DOWN". Go back to the hole in the wall and "GET REACTOR" again.

Climb  back  out  using  the ladder. Don't forget to "GET THE LADDER". Walk

NORTH  then  EAST  to the Space Tanker tunnel. Just inside the tunnel, stop

where  the  wires hang down and "GET THE WIRE". Continue walking EAST until

you find a Large Robot Head with a broken eye. Walk as close as possible to

this  damaged  eye  (without  falling  off  the bottom of the screen!!) and

"CLIMB". You will climb through the robot's eye and DOWN into a Rubbish Pit

where  you'll  find a Large Spaceship. This is your means of getting out of

here,  but  you'll  need to fix it first! Walk around the SOUTH side of the

ship  (the  side  facing  you)  and "USE LADDER". "CLIMB" to the top of the

ship, then "OPEN HATCH".



Once  in  the  ship you should "INSTALL THE REACTOR". You will have to "USE

WIRE"  to  complete the installation. Once that is done "LOOK AT COMPUTER".

It  will tell you that the ship needs a Motivator. "EXIT SHIP", "CLIMB DOWN

LADDER" then "GET LADDER". "CLIMB BACK UP" the robot. Find your way back to

the  vertical  conveyor  with buckets carrying rubbish, and ride one of the

buckets to the top. Jump on to the rail again and walk WEST to the Grabber.

"CLIMB  DOWN"  onto  the  Grabber. Using your arrow keys go WEST around the

U-turn  (you  will  end  up going East!). Exit the Control Room to the next

screen.  Stop  the  Grabber just East of the SECOND support beam and "LOWER

CLAW".  Once  you have the Motivator in tow, proceed EAST until you make it

around  the U-turn (you will now be going West). Stop as soon as you finish

the  U-turn  and  "LOWER  CLAW".  Continue  going  WEST until you reach the

Control  Room.  Again, stop at the platform, "EXIT" the Grabber, walk SOUTH

and fall through the chute. Walk to the Northeast wall where you originally

found  the  ladder. "USE LADDER" then "CLIMB LADDER", "GET LADDER". Go back

up  the  large robot head and climb through the eye again. Using the ladder

"CLIMB"  back  up  the ship and "OPEN THE HATCH". Once you are in the Ship,

"SIT"  in  the  Pilot's  seat and "SEARCH CUSHION". Then "LOOK SCREEN" (the

computer  screen). Select, in order: "ENGINES", "RADAR" and "TAKEOFF". When

the  ship  stops in mid-air, select "WEAPONS" and turn on your front shield

(F). Select "FIRE".



After  you  exit  the  junk  Freighter,  "LOOK  SCREEN"  again  and  select

"NAVIGATION", "SCAN" and "RESUME SCAN" until Phleebhut appears. Select "SET

COURSE", then "LIGHT SPEED". Once you reach Phleebhut, "LAND".



                                 PHLEEBHUT



"STAND"  and  "EXIT"  your  ship.  You  will  see  another  spacecraft land

elsewhere on the planet. Walk EAST two screens then walk NORTH two screens.

Walk  into  World O'Wonders and "SELL ORIUM" to Fester. Be sure to hold out

for 425 buckazoids! "BUY ORAT ON A STICK", "BUY ASTRO CHICKEN HAT" and "BUY

THERMOWEAVE UNDERWEAR". "LEAVE" World O'Wonders.



After  the Terminator lets you go, walk back to your ship (don't go into it

or stand in front of the ramp!). Walk around behind it and then WEST to the

rock  with  the pulsating pods. Lure the Terminator (footprints!) under the

arch  ehere he will be eaten by the pods. (Be careful not to walk under the

pods  yourself!).  "USE  ORAT ON A STICK" to retrieve the Invisibility Belt

from  the  Terminator's remains. Walk EAST to your ship and enter it. "SIT"

in  the Pilot's seat. "LOOK SCREEN", select "ENGINES" and "TAKEOFF". Again,

"LOOK  SCREEN"  and  select  "NAVIGATION",  "SCAN"  and "RESUME SCAN" until

Monolith  Burger  appears  on  your screen. Select "SET COURSE" then "LIGHT

SPEED". Once you reach Monolith Burger, "LAND".



                              MONOLITH BURGER



Walk  WEST  to  the other side of the Restaurant and up to the Clerk behind

the  counter.  "ORDER"  food.  When  the menu appears, press "7" to order a

Monolith  Fun  Meal, then "Q" to quit. Once you "PAY" the Clerk, "SIT" down

at  the  empty  table behind you and "EAT" your food. You will find a prize

(the Decoder Ring) in your food. "STAND" and walk over to the Astro Chicken

arcade  game. "LOOK AT THE GAME". You will either have to successfully land

10 chickens or play the game 10 times to get a secret message.



Tips:-  Put yourself in SLOW mode until you get the hang of it and are good

enough to play at normal speed. DO NOT make the mistake of holding down the

UP ARROW (Flap) key. PUSH to FLAP, PUSH it again to STOP.



When you get the secret message, "USE THE RING" to decode it.



Walk  back  to  your  ship through the airlock door and "ENTER SHIP". "LOOK

SCREEN".  Select  "ENGINES",  "NAVIGATION",  "SCAN" and "RESUME SCAN" until

Ortega appears on your screen. Select "SET COURSE" then "LIGHT SPEED". Once

you reach Ortega, "LAND".



                                  ORTEGA



"STAND"  up  and  "WEAR UNDERWEAR", then "EXIT" the ship. Walk "SOUTH" into

the next screen then WEST until you come to a Narrow Rock Bridge. Cross the

bridge  and  continue  SOUTH.  You  will  find  two  men  working with some

equipment.  Stop and wait for them to leave. Walk over to the telescope and

"LOOK  THROUGH  SCOPE".  Walk  to  the  crate  behind  the  rock  and  "GET

DETONATOR".  Also,  "GET THE POLE" from the Anemometer near the crate. Walk

EAST  until you come to a dead end. Find your way to the top of the volcano

and  walk down the stairs to the base of the generator. Go EAST and "CLIMB"

the  ladder.  When  you  reach  the  top, walk up the opening and "DROP THE

DETONATOR" into the hole. "CLIMB" down the ladder and find your way back to

where  the  rock bridge 'was'!! "USE THE POLE" to jump over the crevice. Go

to  your  ship  and  "SIT".  "LOOK SCREEN", select "ENGINES" and "TAKEOFF".

Again,  "LOOK  SCREEN",  select  "NAVIGATION",  "SCAN"  and  "RESUME SCAN".

Continue  scanning  until  Pestulon  appears  on  your  screen. Select "SET

COURSE" and "LIGHT SPEED". Once you reach Pestulon, "LAND".



                                 PESTULON



"STAND  UP"  and "EXIT" the ship. Walk off the screen in any direction. You

will  see  Scumsoft  in  the distance. "WEAR THE BELT" then "TURN ON BELT".

"ENTER  SCUMSOFT". Walk past the guards into the large doorway and down the

stairs. "PRESS THE BUTTON" and enter the elevator.



                                 SCUMSOFT



You are standing in a circular hallway. Walk NORTH and enter the first door

on  the  West  wall.  "GET  THE COVERALLS" and walk back out of the Closet.

Continue  walking  SOUTH  until  you come to the unlocked door on the wall.

Enter  it. As you make your way through the Accounting Department maze make

sure that you "ZAP TRASH" every time you get near a waste basket. Find your

way to the Boss's Office. When the Boss is away, enter his office. "GET THE

KEYCARD"  from  the  top  of  his desk. Now, walk to the place where Elmo's

picture  is  hanging  on  the partition near the copy machine, and "GET THE

PICTURE".  Go  to  the  copier and "COPY THE PICTURE" then "PUT THE PICTURE

BACK"  on  the wall. Walk back to the entrance of the Accounting Department

and  exit into the hallway. Find the door with the keycard slot. Walk up to

the door and "INSERT CARD". IMMEDIATELY "HOLD COPY" of Elmo's picture up to

the  facial  scanner,  then enter the doorway. You are now in the room with

the  Two  Guys  trapped  in  jello.  "PRESS THE BUTTON" and walk across the

bridge  to  the  Two Guys. "VAPORIZE JELLO". After being discovered by Elmo

Pug,  you  are  escorted away. As you enter the ring of Nukem Dukem Robots,

it's up to you to knock out Elmo's robot!!



Tips:-  There  is  a  slight  time-lag between your pressing to PUNCH  - or

pressing  to  BLOCK   -  and  the  actual movement of your character on the

screen! You should become familar with this after SAVING your game earlier.

Every  wasted  movement will use up your energy, so don't punch blindly nor

walk  around too much. In fact the best way to beat your opponent is to let

him  come  to  you,  block  his  punches   and let him punch his own lights

out!!!



Once  you  and  the  Two  Guys  are safely in your ship and take off, "LOOK

SCREEN",  choose  "ATTACK SPEED" then "WEAPONS SYSTEM", and set your shield

to  "BACK".  When the enemy fighters appear, zero in on their ship with the

cross-hairs  using  your  arrow keys. When you have them locked on, "FIRE".

The ships approach from the back and then the front, and will continue this

pattern  until  you have shot several of them down. You will need to switch

your  shield  on  each pass. Watch the radar box at the bottom left of your

screen  to  tell  you  which direction the fighters are coming from. If you

make it through this, you're home free!!!!!!!!!
