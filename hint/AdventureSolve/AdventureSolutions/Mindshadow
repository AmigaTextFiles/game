    "In a flood your memory comes pouring back. You are William Arcman, a

    wealthy industrialist. Your evil twin brother, Jared, has taken your

    identity. He faked the automobile accident in which he was supposedly

    killed. He then stowed away on your yacht, the 'Tycoon', and while far

    out at sea, hit you over the head with a lead pipe and threw you

    overboard to drown. He then assumed your identity, figuring your body

    would never be found. Your trusted chauffeur, Bob Masters, discovered

    Jared's secret and tried to find you. However, before he could talk to

    you, Jared caught up with him. You have succeeded in reclaiming your

    identity!!".
