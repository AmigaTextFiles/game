Notes.

(1)During the course of this adventure, you will come across several random
elements.  These  will  be  discussed in more detail as and when we come to
them.

(2)The  black  circles are a wierd kind of teleportation facility and these
are used to their best advantage for ease of play.

(3)The scratch 'n' sniff card can be used as directed on screen, but is not
necessary.

(4)Certain  aspects  of  the  game depend entirely on whether the player is
male or female. This solution is based on the 'male' version, so make minor
adjustments to your 'behaviour' as we go!!

                               THE SOLUTION

Start in Joe's Bar.
INVENTORY  - (you are carrying a flashlight and a comic book - the one that
came  with  your  game - and you are wearing overalls) - NW - (you must now
'go') - WEE - EXAMINE STOOL - TAKE STOOL - WAIT - (you are now captured and
placed in a Cell on Phobos) - INVENTORY - (you now have a rule book and are
wearing  a  brass  loincloth!!) - READ RULE BOOK - (looks like you're being
sacrificed  in  the interests of the Leather Goddesses objective to enslave
the human race!) - TAKE ALL EXCEPT TRAY - (notice that the painting depicts
a  pussy cat) - EXAMINE TRAY - TAKE FOOD - OPEN DOOR - S - READ SIGN - OPEN
NARROW  DOOR  -  S  - (you now meet an Alaskan called Trent......he will be
quite useful as we progress!).

EXAMINE  PAPER  -  (a seemingly meaningless matrix of letters!) - ASK TRENT
ABOUT  PAPER  -  (he  doesn't know what it means, but can you see the words
'rubber  hose'  - top line; 'phone book' - 4th line; 'headlight' - 6th line
and  'cotton  balls'  -  bottom line?) - N - (Trent now follows you) - UP -
LOOK  THROUGH  WINDOW - (you can now see into the Examination Room - switch
to 'LEWD' mode for a moment and look through the window again!) - UP - (you
will  see  your  first  'black  circle' here) - ENTER CIRCLE - (you are now
teleported to a Martian Desert).

W  - NW - (you see a little white marsmouse) - SHOW PAINTING TO MOUSE - (it
freezes  with  fear!)  -  TAKE  MOUSE - DROP PAINTING - S - E - N - N - N -
(Trent  tells  you  about now, of his plan that he has scribbled about on a
matchbook)  -  ENTER  BARGE  -  EXAMINE  CONTROLS  -  READ  ORANGE BUTTON -
('Magnetomoor  On' - must be some kind of docking aid) - READ PURPLE BUTTON
-  ('Go  with  the  flow'  - means that you can only go eastwards along the
canal)  -  READ  MATCHBOOK - (the parts list for Trent's thing! Well, we've
got  the  mouse  so  far!!)  -  DROP MATCHBOOK - PRESS ORANGE BUTTON - READ
ORANGE  BUTTON - (the writing changes, so be careful next time you use it!)
-  WAIT  -  WAIT - WAIT - WAIT - PRESS ORANGE BUTTON - (you now dock at the
Baby  Dock, and the writing on the button changes yet again) - EXIT BARGE -
N - EXAMINE MESSAGE.

                             EXPLANATORY NOTE
Now  this  is  where  you  need  to  read  the relevant section of the Lane
Mastedon  comic  that  came with your game package. Basically it is, as the
comic  tells  you,  a  '3-letter  transposition  cipher'. The message is as
follows:

VSDFHHQN  UXRB VVLN RW PLK JQLNVD BE PLK RW IOHVUXRB BILWQHGL --------- SDP
WHUFHV HKW WHJ GQD VVHQDWOXV HKW IR ---------- (this next bit is a randomly
generated number which remains UNCHANGED throughout the deciphering - so be
careful to make a note of it!) UHEPXQ GQDEVXK WFDWQRF RW VL QRLVVLP UXRB.

Translate  it  by  three  moves  of each letter toward the beginning of the
alphabet.  The first letter 'V' becomes 'S', second letter 'S' becomes 'P',
third  letter 'D' becomes 'A' and so on. Remember to leave the NUMBER as it
is. Translated fully, the message now reads:

SPACEENK  RUOY  SSIK OT MIH GNIKSA YB MIH OT FLESRUOY YFITNEDI -------- PAM
TERCES  EHT  TEG DNA SSENATLUS EHT FO (Number) REBMUN DNABSUH TCATNOC OT SI
NOISSIM RUOY.

It  is  now simply read backwards from the lower right back up to the upper
left to read:

YOUR  MISSION  IS  TO  CONTACT  HUSBAND  (or  wife)  NUMBER (number) OF THE
SULTANESS  (or  Sultan) AND GET THE SECRET MAP ---------- IDENTIFY YOURSELF
TO HIM (or her) BY ASKING HIM (or her) TO KISS YOUR KNEECAPS.

                   Hope that's explained things a bit!!

asks  you  if  you're  ready  to  answer his riddle) - YES - (Trent answers
wrongly and is lead away) - (now it's your turn!) - SAY "RIDDLE" - (you are
advised   to   go   West)   -   W   -   (the  Guard  asks  you  to  pick  a
number.........refer  to the number you noted after deciphering the Martian
message,  earlier) - SAY "(number)" - (you can now enter) - W - WAIT - (you
are  now  led  into  the  Inner Harem. You must now enter a precise command
incorporating  the  number  of your partner) - (NUMBER), KISS MY KNEECAPS -
(you  are  given  a  secret  map,  and a torch then shown a secret entrance
leading downwards) - EXAMINE MAP - (refers you to the Catacombs map in your
game documentation).

                             EXPLANATORY NOTE

One  point  to remember here is that there is a particular method to safely
traverse  the  Catacombs. In the game comic there is a picture in the story
which  describes  the safe method of crossing the CANAL. You must CLAP your
hands at least ONCE every FIVE minutes, HOP ONCE every NINE minutes and SAY
"KWEEPA"  every ELEVEN minutes. Use this method when travelling through the
Catacombs).
