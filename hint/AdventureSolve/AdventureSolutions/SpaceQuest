to  the  Spaceship  you've  bought  (leave by the left, UP, Left) and stand
under  the  ladder.  CLIMB  LADDER  - PRESS LOAD - HH. Now you've started a
journey  in  the stars.......let the game play by itself for now........you

anyone! EXIT LAUNDRY. Exit the room by the door to the right. Take the lift

right. Leave again by the right.

Cross the pontoon and leave by the right. You are now in the Armoury.

<SAVE> game now as your next action is really perilous!!

Go  close to the robot at the counter. SLOW. Then, as fast as you can, when
the  robot's gone, run to the two grenades on the counter and GET GRENADES.
Wait  for  the robot to come back and to give your weapon back. FAST. Leave
by the left. On the pontoon, stand above the guard then DROP GRENADE.

Go  to the Left (twice). You'll soon lose your helmet, but you cannot avoid
it. Enter the lift, and once at the bottom, go to the right.

The  Sariens  are  able to recognise you so you'll have to kill them before
they  do. When you leave a room, quickly hit 'F6' during the loading of the
next  screen. If a Sarien is in that room it won't be able to shoot you! If
a  Droid  is in the room you can avoid it or leave the room, then come back
again hoping it has changed into a Sarien!

Leave  the room by the right, then go next to the Sarien you've killed with
the  grenade.  SEARCH  MAN  - PUSH BUTTON. Go near the Star Generator. LOOK
SCREEN.  With  the  arrow,  dial  code  6858,  then press 'ENTER'. The self
destruct process will now be engaged.

Leave  the  room by the left. Take the lift. Once on the top, quickly leave
the  lift,  turn  towards the right and fire ('F6'), until a Sarien appears
and disintegrates............if a Robot comes, try to avoid it.

Enter  the far right lift. Go to the shuttle. ENTER SHUTTLE - PRESS LAUNCH.
Time  is  running  out fast after you started the self destruct process, so
don't hang around!!

You should have one now and just have to watch the final scenes!!!!!!
