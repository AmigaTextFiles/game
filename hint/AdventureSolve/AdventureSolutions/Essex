    Note:- Characters move freely about the ship, so they may not be in the

    room stated in this solution at the time you arrive there. If this

    happens and you can't find the person, go to the Intercom Room on the

    Hangar Deck and: SAY, "(name)WHERE ARE YOU?....then go there.



    You may also have to chase them around once you've found them! In that

    case, ignore the following sequence of directions

    that AFTER you've encountered them according to the solution

    and use the map to reach the next mentioned location

    which may be easy if named or, if not, you will have to ensure your

    mapping is up to scratch and work out from the solution where you

    should then be!
