    "The evidence is all there", says Jones while drawing his weapon. You

    and Hardcastle do the same. Strange......it seems that all of Farnham's

    henchmen have disappeared.

    "Congratulations, Harlow", says Hardcastle, "You've got Boss Farnham"

    You saved Mavis, Wainwright and Rita and sent Shuman, Mongo and even

    Boss Farnham up the river for a long time. All in all, not bad for a

    day's work.
