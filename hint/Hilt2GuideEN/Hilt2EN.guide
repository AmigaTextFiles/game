1. Basic Game Overveiw

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section describes the basic idea behind the game. It explains the
Action Points system and details what missions/campaigns etcetra are.

1.1 Strategy and Action Combined.

1.2 Missions.

When you play a game of Hilt 2, you will play a mission. There are several
different missions in the game, and these can be easily expanded with
mission disks to add to your collection. Some missions have hand drawn maps,
some maps are randomly created, so they're different each time. This makes
for an almost limitless supply of gaming fun.

1.2.1 Campaigns.

A campaign is basically several missions played one after another. The
important difference is that you start the next mission with the equipment
and units that you ended the last mission with. This makes campaigns very
big, like one massive mission.

Another difference with campaigns is that you are only allowed to equip your
units once per campaign, this isn't always at the start of a campaign
either, so choose your weapons and supplies wisely.

1.2.2 Mission types.

Each mission has a main objective, which must be acheived to complete it.
There are six types of main objective:-

                  1. Kill all of the enemy missions.
                  2. Blow something up missions.
                  3. Retrieve objects missions.
                  4. Get to the exit missions.
                  5. 2 Player missions - Kill the other sides units.
                  6. Kill all of a certain type of enemy/civilian missions.

There are also other factors that affect missions. These remain the same no
matter what the main objective is. These are:-
1. Whether civilian deaths are acceptable.
   Yes - Civilian deaths have no effect.
   No  - Any civilian that dies (no matter how) will cause you to fail the
   mission, so don't fire at everything that moves.

2. Whether pass keys have been supplied.
   Yes - Allies will start with a pass key each to open locked doors with.
   No  - Pass keys must be found in the map somewhere (or you could forget
         about keys and blow the doors to bits!!)

3. Whether equipment is allowed.
   Yes - You will be taken to the equip screen to kit out your team.
   No  - Your team will start empty handed. They must find weapons.

4. Whether the map is random or mapped.
   Random - The play area is different each time you play.
   Mapped - The play area is hand drawn. This often means that the mission
            is harder, but it is possible to map out the level.

5. Whether computer controlled enemies are present.
   Yes - The norm.
   No  - Life is easy. Usually only happens in two player games.

1.2.2.1 Kill all of the enemy missions.

Logical Objective - End the turn when all hostile units have been terminated.

Hunt out the enemy and open fire.
Ending the turn when all enemy units have been killed will complete the
mission. The number of enemies still alive is displayed on the computer
terminal screens within the game (see 5.3.4 for information on terminals).

1.2.2.2 Blow something up missions.

Logical Objective - End the turn when no target square is left anywhere in
                    the map.

Search for your target(s) as described in the mission briefing. When found,
destroy it (or them). When this happens a message will appear in the
message window at the bottom of the screen telling you how many targets
remain. When you have destroyed the last target, end the turn to complete
the mission.
NOTE - Most targets need explosives to destroy them.

1.2.2.3 Retrieve objects missions.

Logical Objective - End the turn when no specified object is left anywhere
                    in the map, and when all units are on exit squares.

Search the map for the objects in the briefing. When found, pick them up in
the normal way. Picking up the specified object(s) will result in a message
appearing in the message window telling you how many objects there are left.
When all objects have been picked up, move all units to the exit and then
end the turn. You are told in the mission brief what the exit looks like.
NOTE - If a unit carrying an object dies, the object may be dropped. Even
these must be picked up before the mission can be regarded as complete.
NOTE - There is no need to drop the objects on the exit.

When a unit steps on the exit, "You step on the exit" will appear in the
message window.

1.2.2.4 Get to the exit missions.

Logical Objective - End the turn while all units are on exit squares.

Search the map for the exit, fighting as you go. Move all units onto exit
squares, then end the turn to complete the mission.

When a unit steps on the exit, "You step on the exit" will appear in the
message window.

1.2.2.5 Two player missions.

Logical Objective - End the turn when the other players units are dead.

Search for the other players units and eliminate. All two player games have
this objective.

Some aspects of the game operate differently while playing a two player
mission (in two player mode). See the Two Player section for more
information on Two Player games (5.7).

1.2.2.6 Kill all of a specific enemy/civilian type missions.

Logical Objective - End the turn when all units of the specified enemy/
                    civilian type have been terminated.

Search for the enemy/civilian type specified in the mission briefing. When
you kill a target, a message will appear in the message window that tells
you how many targets remain alive. End the turn after killing the last
target to complete the mission.

1.3 Finishing a mission.

When you complete or fail a mission a debrief screen will appear. This will
show various statistics concerning the mission. LEFT Click to exit the
screen.

If you have just completed a campaign an appropiate screen will then appear.

After debriefing, medals may be awarded. A unit may get a medal if despite
being severly wounded, the unit survives to complete the mission.

1.4 Playing Hilt II

Hilt II is entirely mouse controlled.

A typical game would be:-
1. Pick a mission (or start or continue a campaign)
2. Pick a team (only if starting a mission/campaign)
3. Equip your team (only done once in a campaign, not always at the start)
4. Play
5. View the debriefing, then start again.

On rare occasions, this might happen:-
1. Pick a mission
2. Read the briefing, get half way through it then hear some disturbed cries
   of anguish and despair from outside.
3. Glance through your window and spot the crazed masses screaming in terror
   as they realise that the entire planet will cease to be in just three
   minutes.
4. Pick a team.
5. Give them all rocket tubes in a manically fast fashion.
6. Start the mission.
7. Fire at anything that moves, end the turn.
8. Glance at the time.... Just ONE minute left...
9. You spy your target, open fire... WHAT ? ANOTHER ONE LEFT.
10. Search in a frenzy for the last remaining target. Aargh, your best man
    has just been STUNNED....
11. Find the last target... 10 seconds to go.
12. Open fire. The rocket streaks across the screen, seemingly in slow
    motion. The clock counts down.... 8... 7... 6... The Rocket makes
    contact... 5... 4... The blast expands 3... The rubble remains 2...
13. MISSION COMPLETE !
14. 1... 0 (end of existance)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2 The Title Screen Reference

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

From the title screen you may start the game, save or load campaigns, load
character files and adjust the difficulty via the vision and enemy strength
options.

A LEFT click on an option will select it.

2.1 New characters.

Hilt II games are played by one to six characters, selected from eight. The
standard characters are robots but you may load in whole new character sets
from disk. To do this simply select "New Game" from the options. A new
screen will appear listing the campaigns, missions and character files
available on the disk. Just click on a character file name and the new
characters will be loaded in. Now just play as normal and your new
characters will be used.

You may continue a campaign with different characters from the ones that
started it, but only the appearance will change. The stats and equipment
of the characters will still be the same.

2.2 New Game.

This option allows you to start a new mission or campaign, as well as
selecting new characters (see 2.1 above).
Select the option and a screen showing any available characters/missions/
campigns will appear. Just click on the name of the mission or campaign to
start playing.
The mission brief screen will appear. Read your orders carefully.
See 1.2 for more information about missions.
See 1.2.1 for more information about campaigns.

2.3 Continue Campaign.

This option will only appear if you have already completed at least one
mission in a campaign. It will also appear after loading in a half
finished campaign from disk.
Select this to continue your campaign with the next mission.

2.4 Load Game/Save Game.

Save Game will only be available if you are part way through a campaign.
Here you may Load or Save your position in a campaign. All saves must be
made to a preformatted disk with the name "HiltSaves". You can save four
games per disk.

To Save a game.
1. Select Save Game from the Title screen.
2. Insert your preformatted Save Game disk (any drive).
3. Select a slot by clicking on one of the disk icons.
4. The game will be saved, now re-insert the Mission disk.

To Load a game.
1. Select Load Game from the Title screen.
2. Insert your Game disk (any drive).
3. Select a slot to load from.
4. Insert the mission disk. Future upgrades might occur (new mission disks
   may be released), if you have more than one mission disk, then be sure to
   insert the correct one for the campaign that you want to load.

Saved games are very small (less than 2k) so don't be surprised if you think
that nothing has been loaded because the drive light didn't come on. The
Amiga systems I/O buffer will avoid disk access if possible by utilising
some very clever programming.

Experienced users can use an ASSIGN to direct their saves elsewhere (a hard
drive for example). Just ASSIGN HiltSaves: to your chosen destination
before you run Hilt 2.

2.5 Vision options.

To customise the difficulty, you are allowed to tailor the way that you and
the enemy detect each other.

2.5.1 Vision.

The range you can see is ten squares as standard, but this might differ with
different character sets.
The enemy range of vision is normally ten squares also.

Forwards only vision will allow detection of an enemy only if the unit is
pointing roughly towards it. The field of veiw is approximately 130 degrees.
This is the most difficult setting because it means that you can be sneaked
up on from behind. You will also have to turn while walking about to make
sure that the enemy isn't hiding behind a corner, waiting to ambush you.

All round vision will give you full 360 degree vision, so the direction you
are facing is irrelevant.

See all of the time vision is the easiest setting. The enemy will be fully
visible at all times, even through walls. This makes it easy to see their
weapons and gives the enemy a tough time.

2.5.2 Radar.

You may also use Radar to help detect the enemy. This gives you a huge
advantage. Any life form (enemy or civilian) that is within visual range
will be shown, even if behind a wall or large obstacle. The lifeform will be
seen as a Radar spot if there is no line of sight. Turning off Radar will
mean that you never see an enemy or civilian unless there is line of sight
to them, which may be too late.

The enemy units however never have Radar so to be fair you should make Radar
inactive (who said war was fair ?)

2.6 Enemy type.

The last option determines the quality of the opposition. Each setting
affects the ENERGY of the enemy by 10 points and their COMBAT SKILL by 5
points. The default is Normal Troops.

The settings are:-
Sissies, Trainees, Normal Troops, Tough Guys and Elite Troops.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3 The Character Select Screen Reference

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here you may select your team from the eight characters on display. This
screen only appears at the start of a mission or at the beginning of a
campaign.

3.1 Picking Your Team.

Click on the large portrait of a character to select that character. The
statistics of the unit are shown in the window on the right.

Click on the small portraits to select the unit number.

When finished, just click on the exit icon in the lower right corner of the
screen with LEFT or RIGHT buttons.

The character selection system allows you to select more than one of the
same character. This has been permitted to allow freedom of choice, but this
is not always a good idea. None of the characters excel in all areas but
each has their best discipline. A good team would contain a good mix of
skills so that the team could cope with any situation that might arise.

3.2 Two Player Missions.

In two player missions you select the characters that will make up each
players entire army. The first portrait is player ones character, the second
is player twos.

You may select the same character for each side but make sure you don't
shoot your own side !

For more information on two player games see 1.2.2.5.

3.3 Player Stats

Statistics (stats) describe your character and how well they would perform
in different areas. Most are percentile so 100 would be the best possible
and 0 the worst. Some stats are the same for all units but most of the ones
concerning skills vary. Stats are what makes characters different from each
other so it is a good idea to know what they mean.
When a statistic is printed in this manual, it will usually appear in
capitals to distinguish it from the normal meaning of the word.

ENERGY - Initially 60.
This is a units life force. Hits sap it. When ENERGY reaches zero, the unit
dies.

MAX ACTION POINTS - Initially 80.
This determines how many Action Points per turn a unit has. It can be
reduced by carrying too much.

HEAL TIME - Measured in turns.
This determines how quickly a wound will take to heal. Enemy wounds heal
every 15 turns.

STRENGTH - Measured in Weight units.
This determines how much a unit can carry before beginning to slow down. The
larger the number, the more he/she/it can carry.

COMBAT SKILL - A Percentage.
This represents the chance of an Aimed Shot hitting its target. A value of
100 would mean that no Amied Shot would miss and 0 would mean than all Aimed
Shots miss. For a Snap Shot, this value is halved so a value of 200 would be
needed to ALWAYS hit. Hand to hand combat ALWAYS hits.

DEFENCE FACTOR - A Percentage.
This determines the likelyhood of an enemy hit doing no damage. Sometimes a
direct hit can hit a lucky spot and bounce off. This represents the chance
of this happening in a percentile form.

TRAP DETECTION - A Percentage.
This determines the chance of revealing a nearby undiscovered trap (hidden
land mines, shock traps, fire traps or weak floors).

MASS - Weight in Kilos.
Determines whether a unit will fall through the floor when stepping onto a
weak floor.

DEXTERITY - A Number ranging 0-100.
Determines how many Action Points a USE action will take.
Worked out as (100-DEXTERITY)/10 Action Points needed for a USE action.
So a DEXTERITY of 80 means just 2 Action Points are needed for a USE.

INTELLIGENCE - A Percentage.
The general cleverness of the unit. Determines whether a live REMEX disarm
has worked and used in the repair of broken computer terminals for
calculating the amount of Action Points a repair will take.

REPAIR SKILL - A Percentage.
Determines the success of an attempted repair of a broken terminal.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

4 The Equip Screen Reference

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The equip screen is where you give all of your team members guns, armour or
other objects that will help them in their quest.

4.1 Carrying Equipment

Weight eats at STRENGTH, then maximum Action Points.

Each unit can carry up to 20 items, but not without penalty. Each object in
Hilt 2 has a weight value and each unit has an individual strength value.
When a unit picks up an object, his/hers/its STRENGTH is reduced by the
weight of the object. If STRENGTH gets below zero then points are subtracted
from the maximum Action Points for that unit (normally 80). This equates to
the extra weight slowing down the unit.

4.2 Using the Equip Screen

Easy, pick a character, pick a weapon and when finished, RIGHT click on the
exit icon to proceed.

4.2.1 Picking a character.

The portraits of each of your units are shown in a group in the middle of
the screen. Select the unit you wish to equip by LEFT clicking on their
picture. An outline will appear around the selected character together with
their current equipment list (blank at the start) and their statistics.
Their STRENGTH and MAX APs (Action Points) are shown in a separate box in
larger text to make them easier to see.

4.2.2 Picking an item of equipment.

Use the up/down arrow icons to the left of the portraits to move through the
selectable items list. A LEFT click moves one item at a time, a RIGHT click
moves one page of items at a time.

Click on the picture of an item and its information will be shown. This is
the same as the information on an object that is veiwable in the game. See
5.2.3 for a full description of this information.

4.2.3 Selecting/Discarding.

Click on the icon marked SELECT to equip the current unit. The weight of the
object will reduce the STRENGTH then MAX APs as already described.

To drop an object already held, LEFT click on its name in the equipment
list. The object information will appear but this time the SELECT icon will
read DISCARD. LEFT click on DISCARD to drop the item.

4.2.4 Automatic Assignment

At the bottom of the selectable items list there is a large button with AUTO
EQUIP written on it. LEFT Click here to give your current unit some random
equipment. RIGHT Click here to equip your entire team.

The Auto Equip is intelligent, giving your unit one (or sometimes two) guns,
enough ammunition, a medikit, a hand to hand weapon, some armour and a
clutch of grenades.

4.2.5 Leaving the Equip Screen.

To exit the equip screen, RIGHT click on the exit icon (just below the
SELECT/DISCARD icon).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

5 The Main Game Reference

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section describes the main game screen, what it contains and how it all
works.

The main screen consists of a group of icons on the left side, an
information window running along the base of the screen, three text boxes on
the right showing the statistics of the current unit, the current weapons
and armour and the full equipment list.

In the centre of the screen is the main map display. This shows the current
unit and its surroundings. It is 13x13 squares big. To scroll the display,
touch the extreme edges of the screen with the mouse pointer. You may not
scroll so far so that the current unit would be off the screen, this limits
your veiw of the units surroundings.

The current unit can be in in one of two states, move mode or fire mode.
By default the unit is in move mode. It is easy to tell the modes apart
because in move mode, a box will surround any square near the mouse pointer
that the unit may move to. In fire mode, a crosshair appears on any square
the unit may fire at.

The default mode is move mode.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

5.1 The Icons.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The icon bank runs along the left side of the screen. A LEFT click will
operate them.

They are QUIT, PICK UP, DROP, RECHARGE, VEIW ENEMY, NEXT MAN,
FLASH MAN, END TURN.

5.1.1 The QUIT Icon.

This will abort the current game and enter the debreif screen. No
confirmation is asked for. When you quit a game, the current mission is
always failed.

5.1.2 The PICK UP Icon.

This allows units to pick up objects on their square. When you move onto a
square with an object on it (like a dead body) then "THERE IS A .......
HERE" will be appear in the message window. Click on PICK UP to pick up the
object.
When you pick up an object, its weight is subtracted firstly from your
STRENGTH and then from your maximum Action Points values just as happens
when you equip your units on the equip screen.

Primed REMEX explosive must be disarmed before it is picked up. Pick up the
REMEX as normal and the unit will attempt to disarm the REMEX. If disarmed,
it will be picked up as normal, if not then it will explode with a standard
REMEX blast of 90. Whether a unit succeeds is based on INTELLIGENCE. If a
unit has an intelligence of 100 then all disarms will be successful, if zero
then a disarm is never successful.

5.1.3 The DROP Icon.

This is used to drop object held. Click on the icon then either RIGHT click
to abort or click on the name of the object to drop in your equipment list.
You cannot drop more than one object per square, or drop any object on the
same square as an open door.
After a succesful drop, STRENGTH is restored. If you drop a powered item
(guns, armour...) then its energy content IS preserved.
Dropping something takes just 2 Action Points.

5.1.4 The RECHARGE Icon.

In emergencies, a unit may use his/her/its life ENERGY to recharge a wielded
gun. This is done on a one to one basis so one unit of ENERGY turns into one
gun shot. This is not risk free though because there is a chance that the
weapon will explode during a recharge.

Recharging.
1. Weild the weapon you wish to recharge.
2. LEFT click on the recharge icon. A window will pop up. Use the arrows to
   select the amount of ENERGY to give to the weapon. A weapon cannot be
   recharged beyond its maximum capacity and you cannot give all of your
   ENERGY to it.
3. Select the RECHARGE icon to attempt a recharge or EXIT to abort.

When you first recharge a gun, there is a 1/5 chance that the recharge will
fail. The second time you recharge the same gun there is a 2/5 chance the
recharge will fail etc.. When this happens, the gun will explode and cause a
3x3 blast that does as much damage as the guns Damage Factor. So an Auto
Pistol blast does just 5 damage but a Rocket Tube does 45 damage.

If the recharge succeeds, the gun will now be charged up and your ENERGY
will decrease by the specified amount.

5.1.5 The CENTRE ON ENEMY Icon.

This will centre the display so that the last 'LIFEFORM DETECTED' will be
visible. The display will not be exactly centred on the enemy but on the
square that lies between your unit and the enemy last detected, thus showing
the enemies location relative to your units position.

5.1.6 The NEXT MAN Icon.

This will select the next unit for control. Useful if other units are out of
screen range.

In two player missions this is the only way of selecting the next character.
After moving the last charcter, the Turn is automatically eneded. For more
information on two player missions see 1.2.2.5

5.1.7 The FLASH MAN Icon.

This will flash the current unit in the display. This is especially useful
in two player games when many (up to 32) units are on the screen and you are
unsure of which unit you are controlling.

5.1.8 The END TURN Icon.

This will end your turn. Select this after all of your units have moved.
When you end a turn, the following happens:-
1. Fire will spread one unit.
2. Wounds/burns on allied units will reduce ENERGY.
3. In a two player game, side B will now move and then be affected by
   Wounds/burns. See 1.2.2.5 for more information on two player games.
4. Enemy wounds might be healed (one wound heals every 15 turns).
5. The computer will move/fire all of its units. If the computer fires, this
   will be shown.
6. Fire will spread one unit.
7. Wounds/burns on enemy units will reduce enemy ENERGY.
8. Allied wounds might be healed (wounds heal at a varying rate, see 3.2).
9. Your move again.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

5.2 The Equipment List and Using Objects

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The current units equipment list is the large box on the right of the
screen. Just above this is a smaller box which displays the current weapons
and armour being used.

5.2.1 Using objects

To use an object, just click on its name in the equipment list with the
LEFT mouse button.

Guns or Hand to Hand weapons will be weilded for combat. The weilded weapon
will then appear in the box above the equipment list.
You may weild one gun and one hand to hand weapon at once.
To un-weild a weapon, either choose another weapon to replace the current one
or drop the current weapon.

Armour/Shields will be worn, protecting the unit. The armour (and its energy
level) will appear in the box above the equipment list.
To un-wear armour, either choose some other armour to replace the current one
or drop the current armour.

Other objects are used for their logical purpose, for example:-
Using a detonator will detonate any (and all) planted REMEX explosives.
Using an ammo clip will recharge the current weapon if it is empty.
Using a key will open or close the door in front of the unit.
Using a grenade will throw it (no weilding neccesary).
Using a power pack will restore all lost ENERGY.

Some objects are powered devices which have an internal energy supply. Their
name usually ends in 'unit'. Their energy supply is reduced by one point each
turn. Using these objects will turn them on or off. Turning a powered object
on will also reduce its power by one point. When active (on) a - mark will
appear in front of the name of the object in your inventory listing. When
its power hits zero, the object automatically turns off. There is no way of
recharging powered computers.

5.2.2 Action point usage when using objects.

This is based on the DEXTERITY of the unit.
A use will need (100-DEXTERITY)/10 Action Points. So a unit with a dexterity
of 30% will need 7 Action Points and a unit with 80% dexterity will need
just 2 Action Points.

Note that when using a Medikit to heal more than one wound, the number of
Action Points needed is the above amount multiplied by the number of wounds
to heal.

5.2.3 Information on objects

To get information on an object, just click on its name in the equipment
list with the RIGHT mouse button.

A window will open which displays detailed information on the object.
This information varies depending on the type of object, guns for example
show the Damage Factor of the weapon whereas with keys this is irrelevant.
The information consists of:-
A Description (Always shown)
              A description of the object.
Object Weight (Always shown)
              The objects weight (in STRENGTH units).
AP's for Use (Explosives, Hand to Hand weapons)
              The number of Action Points needed to use it.
AP's for Aimed Shot (Guns)
              The number of Action Points needed to fire an Aimed Shot.
AP's for Snap Shot (Guns)
              The number of Action Points needed to fire a Snap Shot.
Fire Intensity Factor (Flame weapons)
              The intensity of the flame produced.
Max Power capacity (Guns, Armour, Powered items)
              Maximum ammo/power capactiy of the object.

Simply click to turn off the window.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

5.3 Move mode.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

While in move mode, you can move, turn to face a new direction, look at an
enemy or select another friendly unit.

5.3.1 Moving.

A box will appear around any square that your unit can directly move to.
LEFT click on the square to move. You unit will then walk towards the square
in a straight line. You may have to make complex movements in stages.
Any visible traps will NOT be automatically bypassed so take care when going
for a stroll through a minefield.

You may stop before you hit your destination if:-
The unit sees an enemy on radar or by eye.
The unit detects a trap that was previously invisible.
The unit dies (usually burning to death by wading through fire).
You run out of Action Points.

The number of Action Points a Move needs is 4 Points per square plus 1 Point
for every octact initially rotated to face the destination.
So to move to the square in front takes 4 Action Points and to move to the
square directly behind takes 4 Points PLUS 4 to turn to face backwards
(8 Points altogether).

5.3.2 Facing a direction.

Just point to an area on the display (no move box needed) and RIGHT click to
turn the unit to face the pointer.

If you spot an enemy (if you have forwards vision only), you will stop in
mid turn.

Turning takes up 1 Action Point for every octant turned through, so a 180
degree turn takes up 4 Action Points.

5.3.3 Traps

Traps are special squares. They remain dormant, invisible, waiting for
someone to step on them then... BOOM! You've just stepped on a land mine.

When you walk within 2 squares radius of an invisible trap, a test is done
to see whether you've just seen it. This uses your TRAP SKILL. If this was
100 then you would always see a trap when in range, if this was 0 then you
would NEVER spot a trap (until it was too late).

If you see the trap, it becomes visible and your movements are halted.
If you don't see it you might step on it. That is bad.

There are four traps in Hilt 2.
* Land mines will explode causing a 3x3 devastation.
  DAMAGE FACTOR - 35
* Shock traps will severely damage their victim but will not explode.
  DAMAGE FACTOR - 35
* Incendiary traps will damage their victim AND burst into an intense fire.
  DAMAGE FACTOR -
* Weak floors will damage their victim only if they fail a weight test. Some
  units might be too light to be damaged by them and nothing will happen
  until a heavy unit steps onto them. Weak floors are often seen around
  sites of devastation in the levels so tread carefully in such areas.
  DAMAGE FACTOR - 15

5.3.4 Opening doors, Repairing computers and Logging on.

You may open a door speedily by standing next to the door (diagonal is fine)
and LEFT clicking on the door. If you have a key, the door will open. To
close the door, USE the key while facing it.

You may attempt to repair a damaged computer terminal by LEFT clicking on it
while standing next to it. Repairing is a complex business that uses
DEXTERITY and INTELLIGENCE as well as REPAIR SKILL. The number of action
points used depends on all of these factors but ultimately, REPAIR SKILL
determines whether a repair has worked or failed.

You may log on to a (working) terminal by standing next to it and LEFT
clicking on it. This uses 10 Action Points and never fails.
You will see a limited veiw of your surroundings complete with flashing dots
indicating where allies are and thin lines representing doors.
The number of enemies active is also displayed at the bottom of the screen.
A mouse click will exit the display.

5.3.5 Looking at the enemy.

You may instruct your unit to look at any enemy within any allies line of
sight. You will know when this happens because the enemy is seen as a
picture and not a radar blip.

Looking at the enemy will give you clues about his/hers/its strength and
also show their weapons and armour. It is also FREE as far as Action Points
are concerned.

LEFT click on any visible enemy and a window will pop up. This will show:-
The enemy type (name).
A brief verbal summary of how much life the enemy has left.
Damage Sustained - The amount of damage sustained since starting the game.
Number of wounds.
Current gun, Armour and any grenade or bomb the enemy might be carrying.

In two player games, looking at the other players units will only show their
current weapon and armour. No grenades are shown becuase they might be
holding lots of different ones.

5.3.6 Selecting another unit.

LEFT click on any ally on the screen to select that unit. The unit will then
auto centre and the units name will appear in the message window.

LEFT click on your current unit to centre it on the display.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

5.4 Fire mode.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fire mode allows you to fire at a target, an enemy, a map square or anywhere
else you please.

To fire a gun or attack with a hand to hand weapon, click on its name in the
current weapon box, the box above the equipment list. To do this you must
be weilding the weapon, be in move mode and the weapon must have some
ammunition (energy).

To throw a grenade or plant REMEX explosive, just click on its name in your
equipment list, no weilding is neccesary.

For guns, a window will pop up allowing you to choose an Aimed shot or a
Snap shot. An Aimed shot uses the full COMBAT SKILL of the unit to fire
an accurate shot. A Snap shot uses half of the units COMBAT SKILL but
also half of the Action Points needed for an Aimed shot.
* Grenades are always the equivalent of an Aimed shot.
* Hand to hand weapons (including Fists) NEVER miss.
* Guns fired at an enemy in the next square (even on a diagonal) NEVER miss.

Select which type of shot you require or click on CANCEL to go back to Move
mode.

Move the mouse pointer onto the display. A crosshair will appear on any
square that your unit has line of fire to. The computer is fairly generous
in choosing where you may fire so you might have to use your judgement as to
what you can/cannot hit. You can fire past anything you can see past/through
including windows. You can also fire directly at walls and other solid
objects with guns.

Grenades are a little different in that you may not throw the bomb onto a
wall (the Krell Rocket doesn't count though becuase it is a rocket).
REMEX explosive can only be planted on the same square as the unit
planting it.

Hand to hand attacks can only take place on squares next to the unit
(diagonals do count). If you have no hand to hand weapon in use, FIST will
appear in the current weapons box. This allows you to punch a nearby enemy.
A Fist takes 6 Action Points to fire and has a measly Damage Factor of 3.

LEFT Click to fire your weapon.
RIGHT Click to abort and return to Move mode.

If you are planting REMEX explosives then a charge is planted. You must use
a detonator to blow the REMEX up (get clear first!!).

Your COMBAT SKILL is then tested and the shot either hits the selected
target or misses by one square.

After throwing a Grenade or planting REMEX you are automatically returned to
Move mode. With guns or hand to hand weapons, you will remain in fire mode,
able to fire/attack again as before. You must RIGHT click to return to Move
mode.

Each gun has ammo (internal energy). This is shown next to the name of the
weapon in your equipment list. When out of power you must either use an ammo
clip to reload the weapon or re-charge it directly from your own personal
power supply. The latter can be risky. See 4.1.4 for details on re-charging.

5.4.2 Shooting Pickups.

Some pickups react when shot. These require a direct hit, being within the
radius of an explosion is not enough. Also, if a unit is standing on top of
the pickup, the unit will usually be hit but NOT the pickup.

If grenades/bombs/REMEX are hit with any weapon then it will explode, causing
as much damage as the pickup. So, stun bombs will stun, fire bombs will
start a fire etcetera. If a unit is standing on top of the pickup then the
pickup will only detonate if hit with an explosive weapon. Normal guns will
just hit the unit as usual.

If an Ammo Charge is hit with any weapon then bullets will start shooting
out in all directions. Eight shots equivalent in Damage Factor to a Power
Rifle will be shot out, targetting random squares at the edge on the screen.

5.4.3 Starting a fire.

Fire not only spreads but damages units in a unique way. See 4.5.2 to find
out more about fire damage.

There are two main ways of starting a fire.

Firstly you could use an incendiary weapon specifically designed to burn
stuff, these weapons are the Napalm gun, The Heavy Burner and the Fire bomb.
These weapons do little damage to a target when shot directly but becuase
they start a fire they force a target to wade through the flames which can
cost the unfortunate victim its existance.

The second way you can start a fire is by shooting a flammable material like
an oil barrel or an ammo box. There are quite a few of these in Hilt 2
dotted around the levels. Most guns of a decent power will detonate a
flammable material explosion and when this happens, one square of intensity
factor ten or fourteen will appear. The intensity depends on the type of
thing you shoot.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

5.5 Taking Hits & Damage.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

A units ENERGY is its life force. When this hits zero, he/she/it is dead.

5.5.1 Shot/Bomb and Hand to Hand Weapon Damage.

Each weapon in Hilt 2 has a Damage factor. This determines the power of the
weapon and the amount of ENERGY it will sap from an un-armoured unit.

When a unit is hit, first a check is done to see if the shot was a glancing
blow. Sometimes a shot will hit a lucky spot and not damage the target at
all. This depends on a units DEFENCE strength and is a percentage. So a unit
with a DEFENCE of 5 will have a 5% chance of a glancing blow. DEFENCE
strength is never very high so most of the time the unit is damaged. When a
glancing hit takes place, "....... HIT BUT THE SHOT IS DEFLECTED" will
appear in the message window and no damage is done.

If the shot was not deflected then any armour being worn is taken into
consideration.

Armour has its own energy supply (just like a units ENERGY). This number is
shown next to the name of the armour in your equipment list.
A hit will reduce the armours energy by the power of the weapon. If the
armours energy is reduced to zero then the armour is destroyed and any
left over damage points are subtracted from the units ENERGY. If armour is
destroyed 'PROTECTIVE ARMOUR HAS BEEN DESTROYED' will appear in the message
window. Shield units are always destroyed on the first hit, but absorb ALL
of the power of the weapon so no ENERGY loss is incurred.

After armour is destroyed, hits eat away directly on a units ENERGY supply.

Wounds can happen at any time when a units ENERGY is reduced. These will
reduce your ENERGY at the end of each turn by 1 point per wound until you
die or the wounds are healed. Wounds are serious, one wound will heal
automatically every few turns but when a unit has more than one wound, it is
often fatal. Medikits can heal wounds. They heal ALL of the wounds a unit
currenly has incurred. Use them in the normal way to operate.

A unit dies when ENERGY hits zero. When this happens one random object that
the unit was carrying will be dropped on the same square as the dead body.
If a powered object was dropped upon death (guns, armour...) then its energy
is reduced to zero.
Note that dropping a powered object using the DROP icon will not reduce its
energy to zero.

5.5.2 Fire (the burning kind).

Fire in Hilt 2 can play an important part in a battle. It damages anyone
who stands on it or walks through it. It also spreads at the end of each
turn so it must be used with foresight.

Flames come in fourteen different intensities, known as the intensity factor.
Walking through onto a square that is burning with a factor five fire will
reduce a persons ENERGY by five and walking onto a square with a factor one
fire will reduce a players ENERGY by (wait for it....) one. Armour has no
effect in retarding fire. Hot metal armour can be worse than none at all.
This makes fire the only effective anti-armour weapon.

Standing still won't save you from burning because if you end a turn on a
square that is on fire, your ENERGY will be reduced accordingly.

As already mentioned, fire will spread around the floor of the map at the
end of each turn although this does not mean that flame will eventually
engulf the whole map because each flame on the map will also be reduced by
two points when it multiplies. This means a factor fourteen fire will burn
itself out after seven turns. When spreading, fire will not spread over
or through solid objects, this means that you can contain and control fire.
It is a skill that is worthy of mastering.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

5.6 The Statistics Display.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the top right corner of the screen, ten statistics are printed. For full
details on all of the stats, see the character select screen reference
at 3.1.1.

Ten stats are shown.
"xx" means a number greater than 99. A "--" means less than zero.
ENERGY - Player Energy
WOUNDS - Current Wounds
H-TIME - (Heal Time) Time remaining until one wound is automatically healed.
STRENG - Strength
TRAPS  - Trap Skill
COMBAT - Combat Skill
DEFNCE - Defence Factor
IQ     - Intelligence
DEXTER - Dexterity
REPAIR - Repair Skill

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

5.7 Two Player Games

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

5.7.1 Two Player Missions.

In two player missions you control a whole army of units (up to 16)
against another human opponent. You take command of either Side A or Side B.
Side A always moves first. Your entire army consists of the same character
so you won't get your units mixed up with your opponents. The units are
automatically equipped in a similar way to that of the computer controlled
units.

Movement and firing are the same as for a one player game, but a complete
turn comes in three phases now. First Side A moves, Then Side B and finally
any computer contolled units which might be active (and will shoot both
sides indescriminately).

5.7.2 Summary of Differences.

1. The Allies see.... option on the title screen applies to both sides.
2. The character select screen gives you just two characters. The first is
   the character that will make up all Side A, the second Side B.
3. There is no equip screen, weapons are handed out automatically.
4. Side A moves first, then Side B and finally any computer controlled units
   that might be active.
5. LOOKing at an opponents unit will show all of the usual information but
   won't show any grenades/bombs the unit might be carrying becuase they
   might have lots of pieces of equipment.
6. Each unit in each army has a unique name to aid identification.
7. Fire spreads (and burns) after each players turn.
8. The number of enemies shown on terminals is the number of units on the
   other side, not any computer controlled units.

5.7.3 The Armistace Rule.

During playtesting as Side B, I found it annoying that Side A could kill or
stun my units before they had been given a chance to move. After analysing
the end results of the games I discovered that this actually made no
difference to the outcome but still, many found it a problem so I thought of
a solution, the Armistace rule.

Simply it means that for the first turn of each side, you are not allowed
to fire upon the other side. This gives Side B at least a chance to avoid
the shots of Side A.

At first I thought I would put a box on the Title screen so you could choose
whether to activate the rule or not, but that would have been a waste of
time and memory so instead I leave it up to you the player to mutually agree
whether to play the Armistace rule or not. This also has the advantage that
you may still fire on computer controlled enemies during your first turn.

@node install "install"

Sorry, no room on the disk for a fancy intalation script. But don't worry,
installation is simple.

You may install Hilt 2 on your hard drive. This is simple but note that you
will still have to play Hilt 2 with the floppy mission disk. This will avoid
problems that will arise when future mission/character disks are released.

To Install Hilt 2

1. Make a directory called HiltII on your hard drive.
2. Make another directory called HiltSaves for saved games.
3. Copy the file HiltII from Disk one into the HiltII directory.
4. Add an assign to your user-startup, assigning HiltSaves: to your
   HiltSaves directory. eg.

ASSIGN >NIL: HiltSaves: DH1:Games/HiltII/HiltSaves/

Of course, change the second bit to point to the correct path on your hard
drive.

Run HiltII from CLI or by double clicking on it's icon after selecting
'Show -> All Files' from the Workbench Windows menu.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

                           CLASS A WEAPONRY - GUNS

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Auto Pistol.
The standard issue single hand weapon is the Auto Pistol. A single shot,
semi-automatic blaster, it was one of the first small weapons to sacrafice
power for ammo capacity, before that weapons were high power, low shot
weapons. The auto pistol also features liquiplas look handle designed to
mould into the hand and auto/manual balancing settings.
AIMED SHOT TIME - 14 APs
SNAP SHOT TIME  - 7 APs
DAMAGE FACTOR   - 5
WEIGHT (LOADED) - 8 Kilos
MAX AMMO CHARGE - 150 Shots

Repulse Rifle.
Repulse rifles form the backbone of military might in over 16 systems. They
provide a very good ammunition capability of 75 rounds due to an onboard
matter->matter converter powered by heavy elements. The rifle also has a
fast rate of fire and a stopping power sufficient for most general combat
situations.
AIMED SHOT TIME - 20 APs
SNAP SHOT TIME  - 10 APs
DAMAGE FACTOR   - 10
WEIGHT (LOADED) - 10 Kilos
MAX AMMO CHARGE - 75 Shots

Mini Gun.
A heavy weight gun with a high rate of fire. Modern mini guns fire
fragmented iron slugs in pulses of 5 per shot. This conserves the valuable
ammo supply that can easily be drained away in a weapon with such a high
rate of fire. This point also means that the mini gun is extremely deadly,
providing almost as much damage as armour piercing battle class weaponry.
AIMED SHOT TIME - 20 APs
SNAP SHOT TIME  - 10 APs
DAMAGE FACTOR   - 24
WEIGHT (LOADED) - 20 Kilos
MAX AMMO CHARGE - 35 Bursts

Laser Rifle.
A LASER/MASER combination that fires both visible and invisible light
towards the target at the speed of light. The rifle (manufactured by Optix,
who also make the Alpha ray) is lighter than the related Alpha ray because
of the relatively small emmitter crystal but despite having a power pack
more than three times the capacity of the ray, cannot compete in ammo rating
due to the inneficiency in the natural design of any laser.
AIMED SHOT TIME - 22 APs
SNAP SHOT TIME  - 11 APs
DAMAGE FACTOR   - 17
WEIGHT (LOADED) - 12 Kilos
MAX AMMO CHARGE - 50 Shots

Alpha Ray.
Nothing to do with Alpha particles (it's just a trade name), the Alpha ray
is a laser variant that utilised the perfect light bending properties of
variable density zetabit crystals. This makes the beam white and extremely
efficient (for a laser). Official efficiency ratings currently stand at
around 83% which gives the Alpha ray an excelent ammo rating.
AIMED SHOT TIME - 30 Aps
SNAP SHOT TIME  - 15 APs
DAMAGE FACTOR   - 18
WEIGHT (LOADED) - 20 Kilos
MAX AMMO CHARGE - 65 Shots

Roto Cannon.
A large battle field weapon that fires armour piercing shells. The gun
consists of five rotating barrels which auto load when at the bottom of the
rack, providing a semi-automatic capability and reducing the chance of
jamming which was a major complaint with its predecessor (RX4b Auto Cannon).
A lightweight titanium-magnesuim casing makes the weapon lighter than its
predecessors by as much as 60%.
AIMED SHOT TIME - 32 APs
SNAP SHOT TIME  - 16 APs
DAMAGE FACTOR   - 30
WEIGHT (LOADED) - 22 Kilos
MAX AMMO CHARGE - 25 Shells

Storm Cannon.
A heavy weapon first specifically designed for use as a clearance mine
launcher for the Battle of Triz in 2087. The cannon fires explosive shells
with a much improved damage factor to the measly clearance mines of old.
Early versions are still in use in some outlaw systems due to a huge sell
off by the manufacturers (Kiltex Ltd) when new models became available.
Provides an excelent shot:weight ratio for explosives.
AIMED SHOT TIME - 40 APs
SNAP SHOT TIME  - 20 APs
DAMAGE FACTOR   - 35
BLAST AREA SIZE - 3x3
WEIGHT (LOADED) - 22 Kilos
MAX AMMO CHARGE - 8 Shells

Napalm Gun.
A compact incendiary bomb launcher with a simple but accurate aiming system
that invloves looking down (directly or via fibre optic) an aiming tube.
The weapon can hold up to 20 bombs in a circular magazine and can accept a
power coupling input to generate more. The pilot light is powered by an
internal gas cylinder that contains enough fuel for 9 hours continuous burn.
AIMED SHOT TIME - 40 APs
SNAP SHOT TIME  - 20 APs
DAMAGE FACTOR   - 10
FLAME INTENSITY - 10
BLAST AREA SIZE - 3x3
WEIGHT (LOADED) - 25 Kilos
MAX AMMO CHARGE - 20 Shots

Rocket Tube.
A high technology and devastating rocket launcher. An inbuilt matter
synthesizer allows a standard energy coupling to generate rockets for
subsequent launching. The rockets themselves are self powered, semi-homing
missiles that remain in constant communication with the launcher to allow
for trajectory adjustments after launching.
AIMED SHOT TIME - 46 APs
SNAP SHOT TIME  - 23 APs
DAMAGE FACTOR   - 45
BLAST AREA SIZE - 5x5
WEIGHT (LOADED) - 28
MAX AMMO CHARGE - 4 Rockets

Disruptor.
A Class I disintigration weapon (please ensure that all proper anti-
radiation precautions are observed) a disruptor uses a large and extremely
hot sphere of gas plasma. The weapon is capable of melting through most
solid objects and gives a destructive force almost as powerful as a full
rocket blast. The main disadvantages are its heavy weight and slow firing
time becuase the energy must build up before each shot.
AIMED SHOT TIME - 40 APs
SNAP SHOT TIME  - 20 APs
DAMAGE FACTOR   - 40
WEIGHT (LOADED) - 30 Kilos
MAX AMMO CHARGE - 20 Shots

Heavy Burner.
A powerful chemical based flame gun that provides an intense fire hot enough
to melt steel. The weapon operates in two stages, first an incendiary gel is
fired by a high pressure air cylinder towards the target area and allowed to
cover the target zone, then a split second later a second chemical is fired
in a sealed glass shell. When the glass breaks and the contents hit the gel,
an intense fire is started.
AIMED SHOT TIME - 44 APs

                        CLASS B WEAPONRY - EXPLOSIVES

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Krell Rocket.
A Krell Rocket is a standalone high powered rocket grenade with a disposable
launcher. The large blast radius of the target zone is due to the fact that
the rocket itself consists of four sub-rockets which fragment in separate,
ordered, directions before imapct. The system won the military design of the
year award (a saddie) a few years back and marked the beginning of the huge
military research company that is now Roplex Corp.
LAUNCH TIME     - 40 APs
DAMAGE FACTOR   - 45
BLAST AREA SIZE - 5x5
WEIGHT          - 8 Kilos

Stun Bomb.
Initially devoloped under contract to the independant security company
Protec for riot control purposes, the stun bomb utilises the latest
technology to temporarily paralyse both robots and most advanced biological
life forms. A small magneto-resonator adjusts its frequency to the brain
waves/control waves of the target resulting in the motor-control area of the
targets brain to become temporarily locked without causing any permanent
damage to the target.
LAUNCH TIME     - 25 APs
STUN TIME       - 2 Turns excluding launch turn
BLAST AREA SIZE - 3x3
WEIGHT          - 5 Kilos

Hand Grenade.
The Roplex 500 hand grenade provides the user with the most effective size
to power ratio of any hand held one-shot explosive. The outer shell is
scored to fragment upon impact and cause the target maximum devastaion. The
liquid plaztex (tm) explosive in the core was invented by independant
inventor, Greg Hassall who stumbled across the compound when striving for a
new multi-vitamin food source. It is extremely stable until a current flows
through it, when it becomes the most powerful explosive discovered so far.
LAUNCH TIME     - 25 APs
DAMAGE FACTOR   - 35
BLAST AREA SIZE - 3x3
WEIGHT          - 5 Kilos

Fire Bomb.
Gamma class fire bombs were first designed for use against the Marauder
hoardes aboard the USS Draconia late last century. They consist of a
thermo-explosive liquid chemical core and a transparent plastic shell that
fragments when exposed to an electric charge. Once thrown, motion sensors
wait for impact, fragment the casing and the core then ignites, engulfing
any nearby inflammable material. Devastating in enclosed areas.
LAUNCH TIME     - 25 APs
DAMAGE FACTOR   - 10
FLAME INTENSITY - 10
BLAST AREA SIZE - 3x3
WEIGHT          - 6 Kilos

Nova Bomb.
Nova bombs are powerful and technically unique grenades. They have very
little explosive content (relative to blast size) yet cause a lot of damage,
the secret is an oxy-condenser super heating chemical contained in the
casing. Upon detonation the surrounding pocket of air is super heated to
temperatures of many thousands of degrees for just a millisond or so. The
effect is a glowing sphere of energy, hence Nova.
LAUNCH TIME     - 35 APs
DAMAGE FACTOR   - 40
BLAST AREA SIZE - 5x5
WEIGHT          - 7 Kilos

REMEX.
REMEX (acronym for REMote controlled EXplosive) was designed firstly for
the major demolition explosions needed when destroying condemned dreadnought
class cruisers. The military version features an auto booby-trap that makes
the planted device difficult to disarm. The latest v4 version uses Plaztex
explosive for a devastating blast that forms the most powerful around.
REMEX is detonated remotely using a separate detonator unit.
TIME TO PLANT   - 20 APs
DAMAGE FACTOR   - 90
BLAST AREA SIZE - 5x5
WEIGHT          - 4 Kilos

Cluster Mine.
The cluster mine started out as normal Roplex 500 grenade made under licence
on behalf of Roplex by a small company called Minicorp Ltd. After some
modification to the Roplex design a more powerful fragmentation grenade was
born. Approximately 150 small tetrahedrons of titanium surround the
explosive core, causing a large fallout of shrapnell upon detonation.
LAUNCH TIME     - 25 APs
DAMAGE FACTOR   - 38
BLAST AREA SIZE - 3x3
WEIGHT          - 6 Kilos

Static Mine.
Christened the Static Inducer by independant developers Cashmore Inc, the
weapon found an instant use in the battlefield as a semi replacement for the
stun bomb. Essentially it's a stun bomb complete with a several small energy
release tubes to clear away any solid deris at the same time as paralysing

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

                          CLASS D WEAPONRY - ARMOUR

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Teflex Shell.
This basic form of armour is specially designed to fragment after recieving
a meduim/large impact. The scoring on the surface between the plates
vibrates when hit and when the armour fragments, the energy of the incoming
projectile is absorbed. This method of protection is limited in defensive
capability but provides a light weight solution to defence.
ENERGY CAPACITY - 10
WEIGHT          - 5 Kilos

Steel Shell.
A more advanced fragmentine armour than the Teflex shell, the steel variant
features several layers of plates interwoven with a tight fabric mesh. This
allows the armour to survive a greater direct impact than the Teflex shell
without being a standard (heavy) plate armour. The armour fragments in
several stages and the mesh protects the wearer from heat that the metal can
absorb.
ENERGY CAPACITY - 18
WEIGHT          - 10 Kilos

Light Armour.
This consistes of a tight mesh of an organic material derived from spider
web (tradename Arachnax) coated with a thick springy polymer. The plasic is
very rubbery and is very good at absorbing solid impacts by converting the
energy into wave like motions over the surface of the armour. The
thin Arachnax coating inside, is the strongest woven fibre known and provides
the wearer with even more protection.
ENERGY CAPACITY - 25
WEIGHT          - 15 Kilos

Heavy Armour.
An all over body suit that also includes several servo motors that are
needed to move effectively due to weight problems. The suit has three
layers of different forms of protection. The outer shell is a solid armour
plating that provides a good defence from almost all weapons. Layer two
is heat melded onto the shell and consists of a rubber like polymer that
also coats the Light Armour. This serves to absorb as much impact energy as
possible. The inside layer is Arachnax to give protection from thin, armour
penetrating projectiles.
ENERGY CAPACITY - 30
WEIGHT          - 20 Kilos

Power Suit.
A personal tank that contains a small life support system and several
bio-sensors which are used by the internal medical computer to help any
injured occupants. The suit has built in monitors to allow 360 degree vision
via a group of 4 cameras that are mounted behind good protection all around
the suit. Protection layers are the same as with heavy armour except for an
outer layer of thick chromium plating to reflect a lot of the power from
energy based weapons and also provide a good anti-corrosive surface.
ENERGY CAPACITY - 40
WEIGHT          - 25 Kilos

@node tutorial "tutorial"
This section takes you on a journey through a Hilt 2 Campaign.

1. The Title Screen
2. Selecting Your Team
3. Playing Mission One
4. Continuing The Campaign - The Equip Screen

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. The Title Screen

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

After Loading and inserting your mission disk, the Title screen will appear.
You can start games or adjust the difficulty here.

As this will be your first real mission, you'll want something easy.

1.1. Click on some of the options on the right hand side of the screen to
see the difficulty options availiable.

*  Set the options to - ALLIES SEE ALL ROUND
                        ENEMIES SEE ALL ROUND
                        ALLIED RADAR ACTIVE
                        ENEMIES ARE SISSIES

Now you can start a mission. The Tutorial game is a campaign that consists
of two simple missions.

1.2. Click on "NEW GAME".

1.3. A screen will appear complete with any character files, Mission files
and Campaigns available on the mission disk.

* Click on "Tutorial" which is listed under the Campaign heading on the
  right of the screen.

1.4. The Briefing screen will then appear. Your orders for this mission will
be written onto the screen.

* A single Click will print all of the orders up quickly.

The briefing tells of a crashed space craft and your search for escape. Your
first task is to locate three pass cards that lie somewhere in the enemy
complex. You start with no weapons so first you must find these.

* Click to exit this screen.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. The Character Select Screen

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.1. The Character select screen will then appear. Here you select your
three characters for the job from the eight available. This screen appears
whenever you start a mission or a campaign.

* Click on the big portraits to change the first charater. See how the
  statistics differ for each unit.

* Click on the small portraits to change which character to select. Note
  that you can select more than one of the same character if you wish.

* Choose your team, then Click on the exit icon in the bottom right of the
  screen to exit.

2.2. Normally, the Equip screen will now appear allowing you to kit out your
team with weapons and equipment. This time however you start with nothing so
the mission now starts. Do not worry, this tutorial does deal with the Equip
screen. It is in part 4 - Continuing the Campaign.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Playing Mission One

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.1. The Main screen will now appear. The name of your first unit will
appear in the message window, indicating that you are now in control of
him/her/ it. The two large blue numbers overlayed onto the display are your
Action Points. These will decrease with every action, they are a
representation of time. When they reach zero, your unit can do no more for
this turn, you must end the turn or select another unit to move.

* LEFT Click on the Flash man icon to reveal which unit you are controlling.

* Move the mouse pointer onto the main display. Note how a box will appear
  around some squares but not all of them. These are squares that your
  unit can move to directly

* Touch the extreme edges of the screen. The display will scroll around, but
  will not allow your current unit off the screen.

* Look at your units surroundings. A Passage to the right leads to the exit
  spoken of in your briefing. A room below has got some green things in and
  a locked door to your left has some things in the top and the bottom of
  it. These are weapons. The green things below are keys so your first task
  is to get one each to allow you to open the door.

3.2. Move the pointer over the top key in the room below. A box will appear
around it.

* LEFT Click. Your unit will walk toward it. When the destination is
  reached, "YOU SEE A PASS KEY" will appear in the message window.

3.3. Click on the Pick up icon. The pass key will now be picked up and
appear in your inventory display.

3.4. Now for the weapons. Move towards the locked door just left of where
you started by LEFT clicking on where you want to go.

As you stand next to the door, LIFEFORM DETECTED will appear in the
message window. The enemy must be close.

* Click on the Veiw Enemy icon to show where the detected enemy is.

The screen will shift to the left and show a white circle in a room beyond
the one you are about to enter. The white circle shows that the enemy is
visible on radar but not by eye. Good, he's behind a wall so he can't shoot
at you. Enemies don't have RADAR so he isn't even aware of your prescence.

* RIGHT Click on the closed door. Your unit will turn to face the door.
  When facing a new direction, no mouse pointer box is neccesary.

* LEFT Click on PASS KEY in your inventory list. A LEFT Click on anything
  in your inventory means USE it. The door will open.

* LEFT Click on the pass key again and the door will close. This is useful
  for restricting enemy movement or retarding fire. Note that you must be
  facing the door that you wish to open or close when using a pass key.

* LEFT Click on the now closed door on the screen. The door will open again.
  This alternative way of opening doors is quicker than using a pass key,
  you don't even have to be facing the door.

Note that you must USE the pass key to CLOSE doors.

* Step inside the small room and move towards one of the grenades in the
  bottom half of the room. There are three different types of grenade there
  and three guns in the top half.

3.5. Soon you will run out of Action Points, "NOT ENOUGH ACTION POINTS" will
appear in the message window. This means that for this turn, your unit can
move no more. You'll have to select another unit.

* Click on the Next Man icon. The next unit will be centred on the display.
  You can now move this unit like you just did with the other one.

* Move to one of the keys like before, then move into the weapons room to
  join your comrade.

3.6. Repeat this for the last unit. Now you can move no more for this turn.

* Click on the End Turn icon. The enemy will move. If the computer fires at
  you then the shots will be shown.

3.7. When it's your turn again, each units Action Points will be restored.

* Pick up a grenade, then move to one of the guns and pick it up. Note the
  number that appears with its name. This is the guns ammunition/power.

* RIGHT Click on the name of the gun that appears in your inventory list.
  See how full information on any object is available this way, just RIGHT
  Click on its name. Any Click will exit the information window.

* LEFT Click on the gun to weild it. The name of the weapon will appear in
  the small box above the inventory, called the current weapon box. This
  shows that you are holding the gun, ready to fire.

3.8. Move your units out of the room and along the vertical passage opposite
your start position, switching between units and ending the turn when
neccesary.

Soon you will encounter an enemy. One enemy unit guards the room at the end
of the passage. When "LIFEFORM DETECTED" appears in the message window,
use the View Enemy icon, or just scroll the display to look for the radar
blip or the enemy.

* Move towards the enemy guarding the room above. Proceed with caution. When
you end the turn, he might jump out and fire at you.

* Move until you can see the enemy directly, now you each have line of sight
and line of fire at each other.

3.9. Place the mouse pointer over the enemy. A box will appear over him.
This allows you to look at the enemy. This uses NO Action Points.

* LEFT Click. A window will appear giving information about the enemy, his
  physical condition and any weapons or armour that he might be carrying.

Enemies with armour are tough to kill they will probably take several hits
just to destroy the armour, never mind injure the enemy.

3.10. We will now fire a shot at the guard.

* LEFT Click on the name of your gun in the small current weapons box.

A window will appear which allows you to select the type of shot. A Snap
shot is half as accurate as an Aimed shot but also takes half of the Action
Points.

* LEFT Click on Aimed Shot. You must have the required amount of Action
  Points.

The window will vanish. Now, a cross will appear next to the mouse pointer
instead of a box. This represents all of the squares you can fire at. See
how you can fire directly at walls and at squares beyond low objects or
windows.

* LEFT Click on the enemy soldier. A shot will ring out.

If you hit him, he might die or just remain injured. Some weapons are pretty
puny and several shots might be needed to kill an enemy. If he dies, a dead
body will remain and he will probably drop one of the things he was carrying
so you can move over the body to search it if you wish.

If you miss him, you may either fire again (if you have the points) or run
away.

* RIGHT Click to return to moving. The box will appear again.

3.11. Throwing grenades.

* LEFT Click on the name of the grenade in your inventory list. No weilding
  is neccesary.

Usually, a grenade throw takes 25 Action Points. The exact amount can be
found out by examining the object with a RIGHT click, like you did with the
gun.

The cross will appear, just as happened when you fired the gun.

Note how you cannot throw grenades directly onto walls. The grenade would
just bounce off. This is one disadvantage to using grenades. You may still
throw the grenade directly at an enemy though.

* LEFT Click to throw the grenade.

* RIGHT Click to return to moving.

3.12. Now you know the basic control system used in Hilt 2. To complete this
mission you must pick up all of the pass cards from the map, then return to
the exit point which is in the room to the right of the place where you
started.

Note that you must pick up all of the cards, no matter how many units you
have alive. If someone carrying a pass card dies, they might drop it. This
must be picked up too.

After collecting all of the cards, "LAST OBJECT RETRIEVED. ALL UNITS PROCEED
TO EXIT" will appear in the message window. Move to the exit and end the
turn to complete the mission.

When you move onto the exit "YOU STEP ON THE EXIT" will appear in the
message window.

3.13. A Debriefing screen will appear, showing various statistics about the
mission that you just completed.

* Click to exit the screen.

You will either be returned to the Title Screen or if you're lucky get a
medal or two for your trouble. Just LEFT Click to skip any medal(s).

To continue your campaign, just select "CONTINUE CAMPAIGN" from the options.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Continuing the Campaign - The Equip Screen.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.1 About the Equip Screen.

Most of the time, the Equip screen will appear after you select your
characters. This can differ in campaigns though which can allow you to Equip
your team after a specific mission only. You only visit the Equip screen
once per campaign.

The Equip screen is very easy to use. Most of the actions are straight
forward.

* RIGHT or LEFT Click on the arrows to move through the equipment list.

* Click on AUTO-EQUIP with the LEFT button to equip your current unit
  automatically, RIGHT click to auto-equip your entire team.

* Click on an items picture to veiw information upon it.

* Click on SELECT to equip the current unit with the item.

* Click on a portrait to change the current unit.

* Click on the name of an item in the inventory list, then click on DISCARD
  to drop an item.

* RIGHT Click on the exit icon to exit the screen.

Full details on the Equip screen can be found in the reference section.
