  KNIGHTMARE - ENGLISH DOCUMENTATION


* AN ADVENTURE BEGINS

  "There is another place, a different world, a certain time." said Treguard
peering down at us from the great chair, as we huddled beside the broad
hearth at Dunshelm. 
  Our bones were still chill from the journey, and all four of us suffered
the occasional dying shiver.
  The great fortresses of England are not built for comfort; stray far from
their banked fires, and winter howls through the dank stone corridors, as
through any mountain pass.
  "Best to think of The Quest as a living thing," said the Dungeon Master,
"though it does not live as you live - rather it does not die..."
 He looked again at each of us in turn with those strange, compelling eyes.
We were not, it is true, an impressive band.
  I was the oldest, and largest, yet still short of my full growth. Dickon,
the youngest, looked too far from home; watery blue eyes peering with
childish innocence from a pallid freckly complexion, whilst James glared
back at Treguard, trading inner fire with the Dungeon Master, and trying at
the same time to inch nearer the warm glow from the pine logs. Only Sean
seemed composed, but i guessed that like me, he was nervous in the Dungeon
Master's presence, and  striving to seem relaxed.
  Four days earlier, we had assembled on the solitary strip of granite and
tarmac which serves as railway station to Lower Alcombe, our rucksacks
bulged with hastily packed sleeping bags, and our pockets with assorted
items which refused to cram into the misshaped rucksacks.
The grubby diesel railcar which grated to a halt before us did nothing to
enhance our image as prospective Knight-errants and adventurers par
excellence, but it was transport, and we had far to ride.
  "You'd just better be right", growled Dickon. "I've gone and missed Scout
camp and everything. What's more we'd payed and they won't give us a
refund." He hunched down into the gritinfested draylon.
  "An it was the Isle of Wight, an I've never been there."
  James had the big ordinance survey map open across his lap. Now he
stabbed downward, angrily pointing at a spot just above his right knee.
  "It' there I tell you. What's more, it's got to be the place. It's the
only thing that could be! Ralph, tell them not to be so stupid!"
  I leaned across and inspected the grubby old map for what seemed like the
thousandth time. It showed a portion of Cumbria, where the high passes rose
far above the captive lakes of Windermere and Coniston. Printed just above
the 2,000 foot contour line was the one word "Dungate", and beside it the
indistinct icon of a solitary crumbling tower.
  "I spect it's just an old crumbly watch tower," said Sean. "In any case,
it's in the wrong place. We've all read the Knightmare legend, and if what
we've read is right then Treguard's castle was part of the Northern
Watchguard. You know: Hotspur and his clan-bashers. Keep out the hairy
scots. That means Dunshelm has got to be near Carlisle."
  James folded the map and stuffed it viciously into a side-pocket of his
rucksack.
  It's the way in. It's got to be. Can't be anything else, and in any case,
it's the only clue we've got.
  He hunkered down into his seat and spoke little for the rest of the
journey.
  The next day we broke camp early in the tented arena behind one of
Ableside's many tea shoppes, and struck out to the North following James'
map.
  As we left the lake district tourist traps behind us, and climbed higher
into the sky with the July sun, the Quest seemed little more than a
midwinter dream, quite alien to this summertime hike down stone-walled
lanes, where the only hazard to wayfarers was a clumsily-driven Sierra.
We broke for wayside pasties and pies just after six, and then climbed
onward into the pink dusk of a hich summer evening, its life extended by
the altitude we had reached.
  The stony lanes were now well behind us and below us, as we walked the
barely discernable dotted line on the old surver map.
  "We must have passed it hours ago," said Sean, weariness promoting
irritability. "Even if we're only doing two miles an hour, we'd have found
it - if there is anything to find!"
  There followed a fierce debate in which our estimated speed over the
ground was the subject of wide-ranging conjecture.
Then, as if exhausted by such trivia, we plodded in silence through a
narrow gap between two crumbling stone columns, and discovered on the path
ahead of us, a single, erect rectangle of nothingness. Between it's hard,
straight edges, was a blackness that made black look colourful.
  "Elf-portal!" gasped James, triumphantly. "I told you: we've found the
way in!" He lurched forward, hauling his trailing rucksack onto his
shoulder once more. Too exhausted, and too excited to argue, the rest of us
staggered after him.
  At the treshold, James did not hesitate. Tha same will-power and
conviction that had driven all four of us to abandon other plans and devote
our summer to finding Dunshelm now drove him into and through that extreme
blackness, and into......
  We followed.

On the new path beyond the gate, we jostled each other for space, as the
newly-arrived collided impatiently with the recently-departed.
"Burr! What happened to summer!" asked Dickon.
  Beyond the portal, it was earlier in the day, but much later in the year.
The landscape also had changed for the high, narrow passes of the Peaks has
give way to a plateau, hedged with broader, older mountains. Dominating the
view and the wide valley which led to it, there squatted the grey menace of
a fortress, which we knew instinctively as Dunshelm.
Treguard's banner flew from above it's crenellated towers, and light
glowed from an open entry port.
  It was not however, the orange-yellow glow of welcoming fires, but the
electro-blue threat of another energy portal which awaited us.
Before its shimmer, we paused and re-grouped, the slight figure of Dickon,
moving to cover behind the larger bulk of myself and Sean. James inched
forward again, and only my restraining hand prevented him from another wild
lurch into the unknown.
  "Oh come on!" gasped James impatiently, "We didn't come all this way just
to.."
  An impatient Ah-hem! interrupted him, the deep voice seeming to roll
down the granite walls.
  It was a voice to delve dungeons with; a voice that we all knew, as we
knew that of our own schoolteachers.
  It spoke again.
  "ENTER STRANGERS!"
  When the force-field had finished re-arranging my molecules, I found
myself standing with Sean and James in the familiar great Ante-Chamber of
Dunshelm. There was a sound like vegetables being pulled about behind us,
and Dickon staggered through the portal.
Now we all stared excitedly and fearfully at the figure that confronted us.
  "You'd better sit, I think," said Treguard, and the Dungeon Master
indicated some rough wooden stools which stood by a low carved table. Then
he took his own seat, and began to speak in deep, measure tones that
compelled attention.
  "First you should know, that there are many paths, but only four goals."
Treguard shifted in his chair and motioned to the tall figure of the Elf
who lurked near the bookcase.
  Pickle removed a tan leather tome from the shelf and drifted into the
firelight, gliding with that odd catlike motion which is peculiarly
Elvish. Treguard took the book and opened it.
  "The first item of redemption is THE SHIELD. You may of course, choose to
redeem another object first, but I cannot advise it. "
His tone left us in no doubt. It was a command and not a suggestion he
offered.
  "Each of the Quest Objects remains symbolic, yet even a symbol has power,
and power is what you will need to redeem the more difficult items, such as
THE CUP, and of course, finally - THE CROWN."
  "How do we find this Shield ?", asked James.
  Treguard nodded to the Elf, who moved towards an arcane wall-map.
  "Dungeons twist and turn, phase and change, yet the land holds true."
said Pickle. "These are the Mines of Malapith. Old goblin breeding rounds
actually. The stone crunchers still lurk there, and the principle tool of
The Opposition is a resident Hopgoblin. It's name is Haag."
 The Elf gave a shudder, more a distaste than fear. "It is a hybrid - a war
machine. Not bred naturally, if you can call anything goblineese natural,
but cloned and cultured from the vats. It will not be easy to overcome."
  He shuddered again.
  "Singularly, or in small groups, goblins are no great threat to men or
elves, but... That's an entirely different matter."
  The elf also moved closer to the fire, for there seemed a greater chill
in the smoky air.
  "It's not just a matter of size. " said the elf, "The grand hybrids have
additional defences and overcoming them can prove quite gruelling."
  "Yes, but not impossible," said Tregard gruffly.
  "For the second retrieval, I would suggest THE SWORD. As a Quest it is
well named, for its recovery will demand the honing and use of advanced
combat skills. The arts to be employed here are those of the gladiator if
you follow Western legend, or the Eastern disciplines of those called
Samurai. Both must be practised if the sword is to be won."
  Pickle turned the pages, but glances periodically to his master. Now he
interjected.
  "The guardiam Master... They should know of the guardian."
Treguard nodded.
  "As the elf says, there is a guardian. The lower ranks of goblinesse have
a great fear of serpents. In both fear and ignorance they worship the
largest as gods. Such a worm is Khah-Roth, who dwells in the deep levels
and guards the path to the sword. He has lived long and will be hard to
kill."
  "Sounds like mindless hacking, so far," said James sharply. "What of
magic ?  What of alchemy ?  What of medicine ?"
  He rose to his feet and moved to examine the wall-map. Of all of us,
James appeared the most likely warrior with his dark celtic temper and
quick moving limbs. But his mind is always on sorcery, and he has the soul
of a savant.
  "Should you attempt to retrieve the cup, then mastery of lore and
spellcasting must be obtained," said Treguard.
  "It will take more than an apprentice to recover The Cup That Heals. The
priestly healing skills must also be cultivated and refined, for without
witch-doctorhood, the mightiest band of warriors will soom perish from the
accumulation of wounds and weariness."
  Pickle dipped sharp chin to breast and seemed to nod in tacit agreement.
  "And Badwife, Master? Shall I tell of her ?"
  It was Treguard's turn to nod. The elf turned to a fresh page in the
tome.
  "The Opposition has ceded a portion of the dungeons to a sorceress. Her
real name is not known, but she masquerades as one of the grey sisters, and
although she is not a witch, styles herself in witchly fashion. Badwife, she
calls herself, and she is fey."
  Curiosity finally overcame Dickon's nerves, and in quavering voice he
asked the Dungon Master which of The Opposition held THE CROWN.
"None hold it, my young friend," said Treguard kindly. "None hold it and
none may wear it, yet Lord Fear himself will strive his utmost to prevent
you recovering it."
  "Which of us must go blindfold," asked Sean, glancing apprehensively at
the horned helmet which lay discarded on the low table. Treguard shook his
head.
  "The Quest takes many forms, as well as many different paths. None of you
must go without sight, for in this case, all four of you will be
handicapped. Your path is the most dangerous of all for it exists only in
the machine-mind."
  The elf joined him at his elbow and tutted impatiently.
"They call them computers, Master. The land within the computer is called
- The Cyberspace - I think, though my own people scorn it as necromancy."
  Treguard nodded. "This Cyberspace is as dangerous as any land beyond the
portals, it is apparently endless and limited only by the memory capacity
of machinedom. The greater dungeons now lie within it, and you must seek
them. This is the challenge you journeyed so far to meet. If you accept it,
then seize it!"
  The Dungeon Master waved his hand, and we turned to the direction
indicated. Another portal had appeared in the corner of the room. It was an
ebony obelisk like the rectangle on the path above Ambleside.
Once again, James stepped forward without hesitation.
  "Wait," I said "This time we go together"
  And we did.
  

* THE QUEST AHEAD

There are four quests in the world of Knightmare - each must be completed
for you to amass the knowledge to defeat Lord Fear and banish him from this
earth forever. Your trail will be a hard and arduous one, fear will be with
you constantly and death is always around the next corner. Plan your quest
well, for your success depends on initiative and skills that you might not
ever know you posses. Many will enter the domain of Knightmare and battle
Lord Fear and his deadly henchmen.. few wil return with their lives. Fewer
with their sanity.

Throughout the quest you will be called upon to use weapons and spells
wisely and skillfully and solve the most intricate puzzles that Lord Fear
has created in the world of Knightmare.

Arm you team with the best you can find and protect them from harm the best
way you can. Remember that the more skilled your team members are, the
stronger they become.. and the more chance they have against Lord Fear and
his evil marauding creatures.


* SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

Knightmare requires an Amiga computer with at least 512K RAM and a Mouse.
Of you have more than 512K of RAM then certain aspects of the game will be
enhanced - especially the music and sound effects and the amount of disk
access.

Knightmare supports more than one disk drive if connected to your system.

In order to experience the atmosphere of the game to the full, we recommed
that you play with headphones or with your machine connected to your Hi Fi.


* LOADING THE GAME

Turn off your computer for 30 seconds.
Insert Knightmare Disk 1 into the internal disk drive.
If available, insert Knightmare Disk 2 into your external (or second) disk
drive.
Turn on the computer.
Knightmare will load automatically.

If you dont have a second drive attached to your computer, then you will
very occasionally have to swap Disk 1 and Disk 2 when prompted. Once the
game has loaded, you will see the introduction sequence.


* CONTROLLING THE GAME

Knightmare is operated by a mouse. Refer to the instructions that came with
your computer if you are unsure which port it should be connected to.

Moving the mouse will move a pointer on the screen.

There are a number of ICONS or buttons on screen that operate the functions
of the game.

The ICONS are activated by pressing the mouse button while the pointer is
over it. This is known as "clicking" on the ICON.

The mouse has two buttons, a left and a right hand button. Most icons have a
different effect depending on which button is clicked.

For example, to MOVE forward, you must click with the left mouse button on
the forward arrow of the movement cluster. However to PUSH forward, you
must click with the right mouse button on the forward arrow of the movement
cluster. If there is nothing to push on, it will walk you forward.

The rest of this manual will refer to "clicking with the left button" or
"clicking with the right button"to describe the function of the icon.


* STARTING THE QUEST

On the title screen you will see three options.

1) START GAME will take you into the quest. If you do not go to DEFINE TEAM
first then you will play with the default team.

2) DEFINE TEAM lets you set up your party of adventurers for the quest
ahead.

The first task is to name each of the characters within the party. Type in
the name and press return. Next give he/she or it a title - for example
"The Brave".

Next use the slider bars to determine the characteristics of the player.

The first bar is the Breed of Character.
Choose from MAN, WOMAN, GOBLIN, OGRE, GHOUL, ELF, TROLL or INSECTOLE.

The second bar is the Profession of the Character.
Choose from ADVENTURER, GLADIATOR, SAMURAI, WIZARD, PRIEST or GENIE.

The third bar defines whether the Character is LEFT of RIGHT handed.

To define a whole team, repeat the above process for all four players.

3) LOAD GAME lets you restore a previously saved position in the quest and
play from that point onwards. Select this options and insert your save game
disk in a drive.

The file names on the save game disk will be listed. There is provision for
only eight saved games on one disk. If the disk is not full, the empty
files are listed as NO NAME. Click on the name of the file you wish to
load.

If the GET DIRECTORY prompt appears, the save game disk is not present.
Insert the disk and click on GET DIRECTORY to continue.

To EXIT or if you make a mistake, click with the right mouse button or
click on the "close box" icon (the top left hand corner of the LOAD game
window).

     Side-step Left          Backward          Side-step Right
  

To move around the world of Knightmare, you will have to direct your party
with commands via the movement cluster. This allows them to go forward,
backwards, turn left or right and to side-step left or right.

To PUSH forward (against a wall or other object) use the right mouse button
on the forward arrow icon.

The UP and DOWN arrows on the movement cluster only become optional when
there is an opening above or below the party.

You can also use the numeric keypad on the keyboard to move the Team
around.


* THE TEAM ICONS

               +-----------------------------------+
               |    +-----------+ +------------+   |

               +-----------------------------------+
   
These four displays show the name and the face of each of the four members
of the team. The box also displays a quick read-out of Health, Stamina and
Magic.

The leader is the character with the Helmet on. This is the character
through who's eyes you view the action in the VIEW WINDOW.

Any character can be made leader by clicking twice with the left mouse
button on the Character Box or by moving the helmet to another member of
the team.

The layout of the characters in the party has strategic significance. You
may wish to put your strongest members at the fromt to protect the weaker
ones behind.

You can move the players around in the formation by clicking once with the
left mouse button on  each of the two characters who you wish to exchange
places. They will then swap withing the formation. Using this method, you
can position the characters in exactly the right formation you require and
change it depending on the situation.


* SAVING GAMES

During your Quest you might feel that a rest will do you good - especially
if the action is getting a little too hot to handle. You can SAVE your
progress on a disk and continue the adventure from where you left off
another time.

To SAVE a game, click with the left mouse button on the DISK ICON. You will
need to have a blank disk handy to put your saved games on.

If there is no save game disk already in a drive, you will be asked to GET
DIRECTORY or FORMAT.  If you click on FORMAT, you will be asked which drive
the disk is in. Click on the drive that has in it the disk you wish to
format.

N.B. FORMAT WILL DESTROY ANY DATA ALREADY ON THAT DISK AND USES A SPECIAL
FORMAT THAT CANNOT BE USED FOR OTHER PROGRAMS.

If you wish to cancel at this point, click with the right mouse button or
click with the left mouse button on the "Close Box" icon.

You will then be prompted with a message "OK FORMAT" - click on the button
to format the disk

GET DIRECTORY will list all of the saved game files on the disk.

To save a game, click on the position in the list of files that you wish to
fill. This will bring up the file name requester prompting you to name the
file. If nothing is entered the file will be stored as a blank file name
with the number of saved game before it. You can store a save game over the
top of an existing one if you wish. The current name will appear in the
file name requester. Delete this name if you want to change it.

Once you have named the file, click on OK SAVE to store on the disk.

To EXIT or if you make a mistake, click with the right mousebutton or click
on the "Close Box" icon (the top left hand corner of the SAVE game window).


* OBJECTS

As you move around the world of Knightmare you will come across objects and
items that may be useful to your quest. To pick up an object, move the
pointer into the VIEW WINDOW and put it in top of the object to be
collected. Click with the left mouse button to pick it up.

While holding the object you can drop or throw it back down by clicking
with the left mouse button. Whether you drop of throw it depends on how
high off the ground the object is when you release it. Low down will drop
it back on the ground, higher up will throw it away from you.

The distance that you can throw it is based on the weigth of the object and
your strength.

Pickle will help by telling you about the object you are carrying if you
hold it in the pointer and click on the oval above the main View Window.

Objects can be put in the backpack of any of the characters within the team
or straight into their hands by placing it over the relevant cushion on the
hand icon area of the screen. To place an object in the backpack you can
press the right mouse button when in the view window to bring up the
backpack of the last character viewed. To bring up the backpack of any other
character, press right mouse button over the required characters icon on
the Team icons.

Each character in the party has a backpack which can hold a number of
items. The amount that any character can carry is limited by weight which
is indicated on the backpack screen.

With the HEAD, CHEST, LEGS and FEET boxes, you can only place objects that
should belong there. For example, a jacket goes on a chest box and boots go
on a feet box.

The rest of the boxes are backpack areas in which anything can be placed
(including 2 hand boxes the total here is 18).

A chest may be found in which you can place an extra eight small items.

To bring up the backpack screen of any character, click with the right
mouse button on its Team icon. To close the screen, click with left mouse
button in the top left hand corner of the backpack screen.

To view the other characters, you can click on one ofthe three symbols on
the top right hand corner of the backpack screen.

Click on the name of the character at the top of the backpack screen to
view that stats screen. See below.

Comparisons between all four player's backpacks can be done by clicking
with the left mouse button on the four player icon.

If a red box appears around a character's body part in the backpack screen
it is seriously injured. Magic will be required to cure it.

The backpack screen also shows the energy of the character...


* ENERGY

This is represented by the coloured bar in the figure in the centre. As the
character loses energy the bar will drop. If it gets to the feet then the
character is starving.

If your stamina is reduced while you have no energy then it cannot be
replenished unless you use magic.

When the Stamina level falls below zero then the character will begin to
lose Hit Points. In this condition, the more work done, the more injury is
accumulated.

Use the Rest Party Icon to replenish Health, Stamina and Magic.


* STATS SCREEN

This screen shows the statistics of the character chosen. This will show
where its skils and abilities lie and how they are increasing. This is the
key to developing the strengths of your characters within the team.

STRENGTH will determine maximum encumbrance, throw range and punch power.

DEXTERITY indicates the characters skill at ranged combat - for example
archery.

AGILITY indicates the skill held at hand to hand combat - for example
swordfighting.

VITALITY is the level of healing power - i.e. how fast and how well the
character recovers from a blow or attack.

ARMOUR shows the total accumulated armour value for the whole body of the
character.

If the character is suffering any ailments, a white box will appear around
his face icon. The illness will be listed on the right side of the stats
screen. Different coloured types indicates the seriousness of the illness
that is being suffered:

Grey types means it will cure itself in time. White means it will never
cure itself without magical aid and red type indicates a very serious
condition that will require powerful magic to cure it.

To compare that stats of all four players at once, click with the right
mouse button on the four-player icon.

Click on the name of any character to bring up the Backpack screen. Use the
right mouse button to return to the main view., or close the window by
clicking on the top left hand corner.


* THE HANDS

Across the bottom of the screen are the eight hand icons for the four
players. This shows what is held in each character's hands at any time. As
the players move within the formation, the hand positions move in relation.

You can place an object in each hand of a character. Either by picking up
an object from the VIEW WINDOW and placing on the relevant cushion for the
player, or by going into the BACKPACK screen and placing it in the hand
position of the character.


* USING WEAPONS AND SPELLS IN THE HAND

When a weapon or spell casting wand is held in the hand of a character, it
can be activated by clicking with the right mouse button.

This will drop a scroll down from which the desired weapon more or spell
type is selected. Click with the right mouse again to activate the desired
effect.

The weapons and spells in the hand can be 'programmed' to do the same move
repeatedly by clicking with the left mouse button on the desired option
from the list available.

This will show a small triangle in the centre of the cushion to indicate
that it is programmed. Further clicks with the right mouse button on that
icon will cause the programmed effect.


* ENCUMBRANCE

A characters current weight is shown as CURRENT WEIGHT/MAXIMUM WEIGHT ie
21.1/43kg. This is indicated in the backpack screen.

The current weight is usually displayed as a brown colour. If it turns to
yellow you are overweight and the character will walk slower than usual. If
it turns to red the character has exceeded his maximum encumbrance and will
walk very slowly as well as begin to lose stamina.


* SKILLS

A character's skills increase in levels as he uses them through experience.
The lowest level is novice and the highest is master.

For example, the more a gladiator uses a samurai sword, the more his
samurai level will increase.

The weapons are assigned to a particular profession so as someone uses
them, their skill in that category will increase.

If a character is using a weapon assigned to his profession he will be more
proficient with it than someone using it as an 'unfamiliar' weapon.


* MAGIC

The use of magic is for the very skilled only - don't mess with magic -
you don't want to end up with smoke in your face if it goes wrong! If magic
is attempted by an incompetent, the resulting effect will be a feeble FIZZ.

You will need a wand to perform magic - placed in the wrong hands the
effect will be less than impressive. In the right hands however, the
results can be devastating.

To use a spell, click on the wand when it is positioned in the hand to
bring up the types available with that wand.

Choose the level of spell required by clicking on the number that appears
on the scroll.  Use the left and right mouse buttons to go up and down the
spell casting levels.

If you don't have enough experience, then the higher levels will not be
accessible.


* PREFERENCES

Click on the Preferences Icon to bring up the preferences screen.

Here, you may make personal changes to the game. Use the slider bars to
adjust mouse sensitivity, volume, screen position and colour palette.

Click on USE to go ahead with your changes or DEFAULT to return to the
default settings.

Click the right mouse button to return to the game.

* PICKLE'S ADVICE:


 -NOTE FOR ADVANCED PLAYERS:
   "For a more challenging quest, try playing the game with less than
    four members in the team. To do this simply define the number of
    characters who you wish to participate (from one upwards) and then
    ABORT to continue"

 -"A hole in the ceiling might help you find another way out - but how do
   you find them."

 -"Don't lose the helmet!"

 -"Often throwing away an object back from whence it came will have the
   desired effect - especially if it hits someone on the way"

 -"Sleep is such a good way to regain some of that lost stamina - but make
   sure you have enough food otherwise you may never wake up again"

 -"Choose your weapons wisely - and spread them out strategically amongst
   the team for the most devastating attacks!"

 -"Having trouble running fast enough to get somewhere important ?
   Try losing some weight, fatty!"

 -"You will need to gain experience with lower levels spells before
   attempting any serious wizardry!"
