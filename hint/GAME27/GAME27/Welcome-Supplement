	Welcome to The Game Player's Docs series of game documenation disks.
As an Amiga game collector since 1985 and former arcade game programmer,
I've found it quite difficult to play many Amiga games without documentation.
While many games seem simple to play, you don't always know what the object
of the game is, and often there are hidden features within the game. Besides
many newer Amiga games are becoming more complex, and you will never figure
them out without documentation. Also, with these docs you may discover
many older games that you overlooked, especially among newer Amiga owners
who just see certain titles advertised in the magazines or those sold in the
computer stores. There are hundreds of classic games just two or three years
old, but worth playing. Look for used copies for sale at your local user
group. People tire of games and often sell them for under ten dollars.
	I've been collecting docs disks seriously within the last two years.
The files on many of these disks are in random order, often duplicates or
obviously taken off BBSs or services like PeopleLink or Compuserve with junk
embedded within them. I attempted to sort and clean up the worst of the mess.

	The files on these 13 initial disk contain more than 7.6 megabytes
of compressed text and pic files. The files on these disks are arranged by 
game type; i.e. Adventure game, Flight Simulators, War games, etc. For 
example in adventure games, you might find the docs and the solutions, codes
or Pics needed to play the game. Everything diplays automatically just by 
clicking on the items on the menu. Menu Selector uses PPmore and PPshow to 
display the Powerpacked files. PPMore is menu driven by commands at the 
bottom of the screen. A word of caution! PPmore should be exited via QUIT, 
not by closing the window button. While it may not seem to matter, PPmore 
sometimes crashes when the close box is used to exit repeatedly.
	The files on the thirteen supplement disks are in temporary order 
and may be revised (although I doubt it because of the amount of work 
involved) in the first half of 1992 to include additional supplement
disks. This depends on the availiblity of new doc files. The initial set
of thirteen disks will not be revised.
	I've included a text file called `DocsPrintInstructions' on several
of my disks. It is an improtant file since PPMore, which reads and un-
crunches the files, prints exactly what you see in a 78 column format. Many
files were typed in 80 columns and PPMore wraps the end of longer lines to 
the next line with mostly blank space. There are alternative methods to
print those files. Read file! 	
	PPShow does not have a print option. You should use Powerpacker, in-
cluded on several of these disks (see C directory) to uncrunch the Pics and 
then after saving them to another disk, load them in a paint program and use
that program to print them out.
	I've included a listing on each of the initial disks that tell you
where each doc file is located. I've also included a list of missing doc
files that I hope users will supply for future disks. If you own one of
these programs, I hope you will type in the essential instructions, like
object of game, controls, etc. Someone must have a scanner out there ( for
IBM and Macs) since some of these files are 100K long uncrunched. If you 
have access to Compuserve, download their many solves. And if you are really 
lazy and you have the docs, send a Xerox of the entire manual. Worldwide
readers; send European doc disk compilations that have files on my WANTED
DOCS list.
