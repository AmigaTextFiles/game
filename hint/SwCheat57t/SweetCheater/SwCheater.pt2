    ***********************************************************************
    Due to lack of  interest on  my part, this will be my final  release of
    Sweet Cheater.  If anyone is  interested in continuing the list, I will
    gladly forward all  new cheats that I come across to you.  Since my new
    passion is writing hard drive installers, I don't  have the time to put
    into the cheat list.
    ***********************************************************************

    This cheat list contains well over 1000 cheats, hints,  and level codes
    for the Amiga and CD³². The game titles with my name after them are the
    ones that I have  found.  I have put quite a  bit of time into  finding
    some of these cheats, so if you  add any to your list all I ask is that
    you give me credit.   If you upload  the list to a bbs or include it on
    a compilation disk please do not remove or alter the header.

    All the games with an asterick (*) in front of them have been verified.
    If the game  has been verified and  has more than one cheat,  the cheat
    right after the  game title is  the one that has been verified,  but in
    some cases all the cheats may work.

    Some of the cheats may have changed throughout the list due to the fact
    that I have verified a  lot of them  and made corrections  when needed.
    If a cheat  didn't work before you may want to look at the cheat again,
    it may have been fixed.  I try to verify as  many as I can, but I don't
    have most of the games.  I won't verify a cheat with an * unless I have
    personally tested it and found that the cheat works.

    IT CAME FROM THE DESERT:

        Before attempting to go into the ants' nest, you should first save
        elmer to get more flamethrower fuel.  Some time between the 8th and
        10th (i don't remember the exact day), he will leave a note in his
        station saying that he is going hiking in the sw volcanic cone.  Go
        to the volcano, fight the ants, and next day, visit elmer's station.
        He'll thank you for saving his life and give you more flamethrower
        fuel.  The entrance to the ants' nest will never appear on the main
        map, but there are several other ways to get there:

            - By taking a flight from Hilber's field.
            - By driving a tank from a battle going on at a nearby location.
            - By going south when you are in a battle at the M1 mine.

        The entrance to the nest doesn't stay open long enough for you to
        get in before the ants start invading the various locations in the
        town, so you'll have to wait until they do.  The 11th is the best
        day to enter the hole since it is very hot and there are few ants
        around.  If you try cooler days, there will probably be too many of
        them around for you to handle.  Also, if you decide to get to the
        hole by plane, you can land safely on the dirt road parallel to the
        tracks leading to the m1 mine.

        For those who are having trouble getting to the ants hideout, it is
        located about one screen due south of mine one.  The best way to
        gain access to the tunnel is on the morning of day 11.  Go to the
        airport and get the plane.  Fly to mine one (southeast from the
        airport) and land on the road in front of mine one.  Get out of
        your plane and walk to the center of the main building of mine one.
        Walk south about one and a half screens and the hole should open
        and a ant will crawl out.  You must kill the ant and run to the
        hole before it closes.  You will get about 4 or 5 chances to get
        in.  Once you are in the hole you will automatically have the flame
        thrower and the timed dynamite charges.  There are two levels of
        the ants chambers, a top level and a bottom level.  You must make a
        map as to where you have checked.  YOu can do this by putting the
        game on pause with the left mouse button.  This will keep the ants
        off you while you draw maps.  Once you have made it to the bottom
        chamber repeat the map drawing till you find the queen ants
        chamber.  You will need it to get out after you plant the charges.
        To plant the charges once in the queens chambers move close to the
        queens left side of her body.  Once you walk around her left side
        the music will stop and a slow ticking will start.  You will have
        to get back to the place you entered on the second level. If you
        get back before the bomb goes off you will win the game.

        NOTE:

            It means nothing to gather information about the ants through
            out the game.  The mayor will not listen to anything you
            present in evidence. He will call an alert only after his car
            gets eaten on the afternoon of June 11.

            It will do no good to escape the hospital as you have to sleep
            anyway.  Even thou it will do no good to escape from the
            hospital it's a fun arcade sequence to play.

            Even with the solves given above you still must learn how to
            fly the airplane.  To get the right altitude to save fuel,
            after you take off fly east or west.  Back off the throttle
            till the shadow on the ground comes up and just touches the
            wing of the plane.  You will then have the right speed and
            altitude.  The faster you fly and the higher you go the more
            fuel you will use.  These settings will conserve enough fuel
            to let you fly and not run out of gas and return to the
            airfield and land if you blow it getting into the ant hole.

        When you start the game, on the first roof you come to, above a
        sign saying "Arctic Toys" you will find five objects, which are,
        from left to right, an apple, an Earth globe, a cake, a hammer and
        a tap.  The first letters of each of these added together (AECHT)
        is an anagram of the word CHEAT.  Pick up the objects in the correct
        order (Cake, Hammer, Earth globe, Apple and Tap) to receive an
        invincibility shield lasting 10 minutes.  When the cheat is
        activated, flashing fish form around Robocod, and the music speeds
        up.  Also, if now you go straight into the first room, and then
        exit immediately you will find that all of the castle doors have
        been unlocked, allowing you to access any level.
        
        On the sports equipment level after the second spike are five
        objects in a row, which, in order, are some Lips, a Violin, an
        Earth globe, an Ice-cream and a Snowman.  The first letter of each
        of these added together spells out LVEIS, which is an anagram of
        the word LIVES.  Collect these in the correct order (Lips, Ice
        cream, Violin, Earth and Snowman) for infinite lives.

        In some point of the game (I do not know where), there are five
        objects that spell out the word POWER. Collect them in the
        following order: Penguin, Oil, Wine, Earth and Racquet.

        Going into Map Select mode allows you to leap to various points in

            18 Level 3-4        36 Bonus Level 9

                              (SECRET ROOM LOCATIONS)

        There are two hidden worlds behind the main tower, another sweets
        level (including a Liquorice Allsorts World, the infamous Bouncing
        Jelly World, another Cake World and an upside down Jelly World)
        and an extra scrolling section. To reach them, run along the ground
        floor - avoiding the doors - then go up and over the first flight
        of stairs.  From the bottom of the second (smaller) tower, make
        your way up to the landing above Dr. Maybe's final door and run left
        into the wall.  You'll disappear behind the screen and arrive in the
        Secret Tower room.  But who is Katie? 

        Once you've  finished the bath level, drop down to the bottom of the
        castle, and walk left until you get to the small snowman statues.
        Jump on these and they'll turn into a moving platform.  Once you get
        to the top of the screen, walk left into thin air and jump.  By now
        you should be next to some doors.  Go through them for bonus city!!

        Go to the same place after finishing the circus room (the last room
        before the end of game baddy) and stand on the golden snowmen again.
        A platform made of two bonud blocks should float upwards, revealing
        a secret tunnel.  At the end of this are even more extra lives and
        stars.
    
        Do as above after the sweets level, but go to the left of the
        castle.  Go on the snowmen once more, and at the top of the screen
        grab the umbrella and collect all the goodies while you're floating
        down.

        On the second teddy bear level, keep jumping over the spikes until
        you see a hole above you.  Jump through this and catapult yourself
        off the bus there. Once you've done this, get on the higher level
        and keep walking left, bounce on the trampoline and collect the
        wings.  Now fly along the top of the screen to the right and you
        should find a different exit.  Go through this for a special bonus
        level. 

        Complete a level with does not feature a guardian and you will
        always find something new when you return to the castle "selection"
        screen.  In one case you will find a whole sequence of lifts and
        things (see above) that lead to a door that you cannot normally get
        to.  If you go to the very right of the factory screen and look down
        you will see a load of crowns, which you can access after coming
        back from other levels.

        It is possible to finish Robocod by only doing half the levels.  A
        choice of two new doors to enter is given when the correct level is
        completed.  Start by completing the Fluffy Toys one and then by
        doing the Cars one.

        Finish the bath levels and as soon as you come out of the door run
        straight to the golden snowmen in the bottom far left outside the
        castle.  Jump into these snowmen and you'll float upwards to the top
        of the screen where you'll be met by a door.  Getting through this
        door is tricky but worth it.  Inside are loads of extra lives and
        energy stars.  Go to the same place after finishing the circus room
        (the last room before the end of game baddy) and stand on the golden
        snowmen again.  A platform made of two bonus blocks ahould float
        upwards revealing a secret tunnel.  At the end of this are even more
        extra lives and stars.

        For something interesting in this game go up into the tree houses
        near the left side of the map.  When you see a commercial like
        screen with a woman in it make this spell: RHINO HORN, BLACK PEARL,
        NARCICUS ROOT.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    KICK OFF:

        You can always make the other guy miss the shot totally just by
        holding down the firebutton while he attempts to make a shot, it
        will be blocked.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    KICK OFF 2:

         Switch on autofire, or repeatedly press the fire button and the
         result will be that your keeper will save the ball every time.

        Keep pressing the 'R' key when you take a penalty, this will show
        you where the players going to kick the ball.

        In mid-match press all the function keys from left to right 'F1' to
        'F10'.  "S12" or "S14" should appear in the top right hand corner.
        You will now be able to substitute the computer's keeper and the
        new guy will be completely useless.

        Substitute the opposing goalkeeper twice and he will not save your
        shots.

    KINGPIN BOWLING: (LSD)

        This cheat requires really fast autofire, but you may be able to
        emulate it on a joystick/pad by pressing the fire button really
        quickly.  During play, if you line up the man where you want, and
        then press down the autofire, it will generally throw the ball down
        the center of the lane.  The less force there is, the closer to the
        center of the lane the ball will be bowled.  If you put your man to
        the far right, and put the speed up to almost full force, you can
        generally bowl a perfect strike.  Its a very useful technique. 

        Also, if you have a single pin left, or a similar situation in your
        game, then this is an  excellent technique to line up the ball.

        NOTE:  This cheat will not guarantee a strike, or spare every time.

        never decrease.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    KNIGHTS OF THE SKY:

        If you're doing badly and your plane is heavily shot, land in a
        field & keep the engines running.  Drive to a friendly airbase
        avoiding any trenches.  Enemy planes try to shoot you but always
        miss, they do however fly in front of you so you can zap them.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    KRISTAL:
            
        FIGHTS - Proficent swordplay is essential if your to get anywhere in
        the game.  The neck chop is one of the more effective blows, but the
        program blocks repetition of single moves.  To get around this,
        occassionaly switch to a differnt move in order to enable the neck
        chop once again.  Give generously to the poor and you'll be a step
        closer to obtaining the sword of the spheres.

        THE PALACE - To enter the palace, you'll need to get the invitation
        from the elusive Gloop, found in Novala.  Once you have it, keep out
        of fights or you could lose it for good.  When you get into the
        palace, ask nedrod three questions and he will give you the talisman,
        which can help you find another useful item.  Answer the princess's
        question with {ITS A SECRET}.  She will give you the ring of belz,
        which will only work in conjunction with the spell scroll.

        IN GENERAL - Objects are not always found in the same places from
        game to game, so a detailed search of both fore and backgrounds is
        often in order.  To survive the final confrontation, a high psychic
        rating is needed, which can be increased by donating skringles to
        the poor.  Disorderly conduct can have the opposite effect.  The
        safest technique in the space battles, is to slow right down as soon
        as you see the aliens shoot them all, then power at full steam until
        the next lot.  Follow readheads ship if you see it.  Heatpro tablets
        are necessary if you beam down to one of the hotter planets.  Makes
        notes of what you are told, and use any new names or subjects to
        weavel out every last bit of information from the characters.

        launchers with four rockets each, and the last two nothing at all.
        Deploy in the entrance, in the gap in the outer wall , and take the
        house to pieces with the rockets, waiting for droids or Regix to
        show up - get them with Jonlan's M4000. I managed to do the scenario
        with one shot - it went between the leaves of the door, blew up
        against a wall and Regix was on the other side. end of story, fade
        to black.

    LEGEND OF THE SWORD:

        The worm can only be killed with spears, but it then blocks the
        tunnel.  Leave it well alone!  To enter the cell in the trolls
        cavern, get arrested by leaving the iron gates open.  Search the
        trolls house thoroughly for the key to the gates.  To take the boat,

    LEISURE SUIT LARRY:

        Hold down 'ALT' and 'X' keys to get past proof of age.  Hold down
        'ALT' and 'D'.  It will ask for a location number.  Enter a number
        form 008-045 (must be a three digit number).

        This solve did'nt get all the points, but it finishes the game.  my
        additions are in capitals.....(score 215 of 222)
         
        The 1st step is to enter the bar, go to the bathroom and read the
        walls several times until you get the password.  Then go to the sink
        and get the ring.  you can (must!) use the toilet if you want.  Go 
        to the bar and buy a whiskey.  Go to the drunk next to the bathroom
        wall and (kick him to wake him) give him the whiskey and he'll give
        you the remote control.  Get the rose too.  Go back into the bar and
        knock on the big door.. when he asks you for the password.. tell him
        "KEN SENT ME", then enter.  Turn on the T.V. with the remote.  Keep
        changing channels until you find a channel he likes..  he'll move
        from the stairs.  Climb up and voila!  The prostitute:  Don't hop
        into bed with her until you get the rubber.  You just need the candy
        on the bench.  Get it. go out the window, and go to the fire-escape
        ladder.  You'll fall into a dumpster.  Search it and get the hammer.
        Exit the dumpster and go left. Call a cab at the street.

        Now go to the casino and go through the lobby.  Get the card in the
        ashtray.  Now gamble a bit until you have about 250 dollars.  Go
        outside.  Sometime in the game when outside the casino, a guy in a
        barrel will come up and ask you to buy an apple.  Buy it.  Call the
        cab..  tell him to go to the store.  enter the store and buy a
        rubber.  Also get the (magazine and) cheap wine in the back.
        (never enter the cab with the wine..  the cabbie will get drunk and
        kill you) pay for the wine and exit..  Wait for the russian looking
        guy to come from the left. (Ignore the dog) When he comes, give him
        the wine..  not money.  (Look at phone dial number, answer the
        questions)  Once you have the knife go right and show the pass to
        the bouncer at the disco door.  Go in and sit down at the table with
        the lady.  Smile and give her the ring, the candy, and the rose.
        Ask her to dance.  When you finish off with the dancing ask her to
        marry you.  She'll ask you for $100.  Give it to her and meet her at
        the marrage chapel.  It's east of the casino front.  Enter and go up
        to the front.  Type "MARRY", and you'll get married.  Go up to the
        honeymoon suite.  (fourth floor, door with the heart, push four).
        Knock, and enter. She'll be on the bed, and {NOT IN THE MOOD!?!}
        Turn on the radio and listen to it.  You'll get a number to call to
        get the wine delivered that she wants.  Go to the casino and get
        some taxi fare money.  Go to the phone in front of the store,
        (answer the phone if it rings) call the number and have them
        deliver it to the {HONEYMOON SUITE}.  If they say it probably won't
        show up, you screwed up on the typing.  Go back to the casino and go
        to the suite.  Be sure that you have the knife.  Enter and pour the
        wine.  Things will take they're course and you'll find yourself tied
        to the bed. (THE BITCH!) Use the knife and free yourself.  Get the
        rope and leave.  Go to the casino again and using some saving, use
        the dollar and get about $50.  (go to cabaret.  find a seat and 
        sitdown. listen to act.) Once you have it, go to the bar and knock
        on the door again.  Go up the stairs and screw her now that you have
        the rubber.  Remove the rubber after you've used it.  Go out the
        window and this time go to the right of the balcony.  Tie the rope
        to yourself and tie it to the railing.  Type "GO WINDOW" or (reach
        out) something so your hanging in front of the  window on the right.
        Break the glass with the hammer.  Get the pills.  Pull on the rope
        and untie yourself.  Go down the fire escape and call a cab again.
        Go to the casino and go to the eighth floor.  Talk to the lady at
        the desk until the game tells you that you'll need some medicine or
        something.  Give her the pills.  She'll run off and leave the desk
        unguarded.  Push the button and enter the open doors on the right.
        Enter and go up and right.  When you're in the room with the bed,
        open the closet door.  Enter it and type, "LOOK".  Get the doll...
        (look at doll.  inflate doll.  look at doll. use doll.) then wait as
        you run after it.  When you're near the hottub, (remove clothes)
        enter it.  Look at the lady.  smile, and give her the apple. Things
        will then run they're course, and voila!

    LIBERATION:
    
        To duplicate any item as many times as you want do the following:
        
        First find a power point and stand in front of it.  Then select any
        item from a droid's backpack and drop it on to the floor so that the
        name of it appears in the text window.  Now pick up the same object
        and return it to the droid's backpack and engage the poser point so
        the lightning bolts are touching you.  Use the look right, look left
        command to move the view screen so that it is at an angle.  Move the
        cursor to the bottom of the screen and hold down the right mouse
        button so that the cursor becomes a hand and left click, at which
        point an object should appear on the floor and you can drop as many
        objects as you wish.  Look back to the normal view and when the
        power bolts stop you can pick up the objects that you dropped.

        First a little hint: The green diamonds are essential as these award
        you with an extra life. Some of the red diamonds will allow control
        over two bats but this is more of a hinderence as the two bats prove
        confusing.  Avoid the blue squares as they will shrink the size of

    *LOST ON PARROT ISLAND:

        On the title/option screen, type "NOTLOST" and a map screen will

        boat.  Use the life boat to see the ending.

        NOTE:   You may have to type "NOTLOST" more than once.  Probably
        something to do with the fact the game was coded in amos.       

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    LOST PATROL:

        Rest for 50 minutes and for no loss of food your strength is
        restored by a few points.  This restores all of your remaining men
        to 99 percent.  Keeping up your men's strength and morale is vital.
        Giving your men 50 minutes' rest a night, or during the day when
        it's too dark to arry on, will slam your energy and morale levels
        to max.  Even if you don't have much food, you don't have to worry,
        as your men will not eat it.
        
        On reaching the first village (the first white cross on the map),
        search the area to find a hole in the ground where the villagers
        appear to be hiding.  You then have two options:  ENTER TUNNEL or
        USE GRENADES.  Gomez is useful at this point, but if he is dead, go
        for the USE GRENADES option.

        Start off questioning the villagers normally by aking them "Where
        VC?" Once you have an answer, start the hard questioning, or a
        village boy will get hold of a gun and shoot one of your men.

        using the trader character on the disk you can purchase a PGMP for
        130500 credits) and STUR/EFATE (Where not only is there a PGMP
        lying on the floor NESAR the gun shop, but they can be sold for

        a now-buggy, the moment you hear the missile being launched, stop
        immediately and begin to turn around.  Keep turning on the spot.
        The missile will narrowly miss you then come back and keep pace
        alongside you for a while until it finally speeds off to clobber
        someone else not so smart.
        
        Invulnerablity against mortars:  Watch for the bomber.  It will
        always come over the horizon in front of you.  If you are stopped,
        wait until it is approximately half way to you (otherwise it may be
        able to dodge your missile) then blast it.  If you are moving fast
        blast it the moment it appears over the horizon.  If the bomber does
        manage to drop mortars turn 90 degrees quickly and speed off.

    *MR. NUTZ (Ocean):
    
        On the map screen type "DONTPANIC" and use the following keys while
        on the map screen:

                'A'______________________Gives you all power ups.
                'Q'____________________________Adds stars to you.
                'W'_____________________Subtracts stars from you.
                'F5'____________________Adds lives to your stock.
                'F6'_____________Subtracts lives from your stock.
                'F7'______________________Add gems to your stock.
                'F8'_______________Subtract gems from your stock.

                                    (HINTS)

        On level one, when you come to the first teleporter, keep going 
        right, until you find the the first ladder.  Go up to it and get a
        blue flag - it has loads of gems, lives and hit points, so you can
        keep going until you have thousands of stars and 99 lives.

        The following didn't work on my version:

        Pause the game and slowly type any of the following:

        also work on the standard ECS version.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    *NAVY MOVES:

        The access code for part 2 is-"786169"
        
        PART 1: Move back slightly when you encounter a mine.  They're much
                less sensitive from the rear.  Avoid jetski bullets by
                jumping or ducking.  When approaching sharks, move the up
                and down nut left and right.  Octopi and sea monsters are
                easily thwarted by holding down fire until both missiles are
                ignited and then releasing.  Struggle to dock with a
                submarine?  Put a mini-sub in the gap between the tailfin
                and the hull, face the left of the screen and move upwards
                slowly, the computer takes over the docking procedure for
                you.

        PART 2: The code is 948411.
        
               Arrows indicate the direction of the lifts.  Kill white
               marines and flamethrower troops to get more ammo.  Stand over
               the body and search thoroughly.  To get the code of an
               official, you must shoot him with a gun, not a flamethrower.
               To enter computer codes, stand by a terminal, push up and
               you'll be asked for a code.  Two of the codes are:  transmit
               message: 1st or 2nd transmission official open door: 1st or
               2nd machine official to open the reactor door, use the
               terminal next to the reactor.  The computer confirms the bomb
               is planted.  Go out, use the same terminal you used to open
               the door and transmit the following: "OABERYAMD".  Now type
               "END" at the ready prompt and run like hell to the conning
               tower.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

        `up' towers, or "BLUESHOUSE" on the `down' towers.

                            'F3'___For better weapon.
                            'F4'____________Not sure.

                            'F9'______For level skip.
                            '1'-'7'____Weapon select.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    NEUROMANCER:
                    
        When you first begin, sell all your body parts.  You can get along
        just fine without them for now, and it gives you enough to get a
        half way decent deck.  You will eventually need to buy them back
        before you start entering cyber-space, or you will be killed easily.

        jump, fire.  If your current weapon is arrows, fire halfway up, but
        if your weapon is bombs, fire at the top of your jump.  A whirl-wind
        should appear after four hits, and it will take you to level 1-4.

        On level 1-2 shoot the baddies and collect the blue E on the floor
        to the right.  Now hop back to the point you started at and stand on
        the last two blocks on the left side of the second floor.  Shoot
        towards the left wall while doing tiny hops, and the warp will
        appear.  This will bring you to level 1-2 where there are 2 Extend
        Life Pills

        On level 1-3 from the starting position there are 12 ledges and a
        wall to the right.  Go to the other side of the wall and fire to
        the left towards the second ledge from the bottom.  Ship required.
        This will bring you to level 2-1 near the end of the round.

        In 1-4, you will be in a little box under some water.  Go up and
        to the right, and you come out in a small room with three boxes on
        the right hand side.  Go up these, and you will see 4 long spaces,
        the top one having an {N} and a {D} in it.  Go up to the top one,
        get the letters, stand in the centre of the space, facing left, and
        fire.  yep, you guessed it, another whirl-wind.  This one takes you
        to level 2-4.

        On level 2-1 above your kiwi friend is a small tunnel which takes
        you to some stair-like ledges leading to a small cavern where
        there are two fruits.  Fire at the fruit on the right.  Ship needed 
        to reach tunnel.  This brings you to level 3-4.

        On level 2-2 find a balloon and float up to where the bears on
        balloons emerge. Stand to the right of the green left-pointing
        arrow and shoot the bears balloons away. Repeat this until the warp
        appears.  This brings you to the end of level 2-2.

        On level 2-2 there is a ledge with a green arrow pointing right.
        Jump up into the water.  This takes you to level 2-2 halfway
        through the level.

        On level 2-3 follow the first water you come to.  At the end are
        two ledges with spikes below.  Stand on one ledge and fire at the
        other.  This takes you to level 2-3 takes you halfway through the
        level.

        On level 2-4 , stand at the entrance to the room where the giant
        octopus is located and fire to the right several times.  A warp will
        appear that will take you to the beginning of level 3-1.

        On level 4-1 above the Extend Life Pills is a tunnel.  Fire above
        the 2nd letter from the right.  You must be on a duck ship for it to
        work.  This brings you to level 4-2.

        On level 4-4 below the kiwi to the left are some spikes.  Stand on
        the left hand side of them and using small jumps fire to the right.
        This brings you to level 5-1.

        When you reach the ice whale, move to the right-hand side of the
        spikes, avoid the crystals, and wait until he picks you up.  Once
        inside the whale, you can start shooting, but avoid the ice drops.

        Meeting the rock monster without bombs makes him difficult to pass.
        So collect bombs, go to the highest platform and shoot him.  Kill it
        by either dodging the bullets and hitting it when the doors open, or
        by fireballs.

        The last boss you encounter is the balloon seal.  He cant be killed,
        by blows to the body, so you must hit the balloon.  Be careful for
        the balloon seal is armed with a cannon and shoots cannon balls at
        Tiki.

    *NICK FALDO'S CHAMPIONSHIP GOLF:

        On the title screen, type "MAJORTOM".  You should now find an
        option to play a round on mars.

        To get a hole in one everytime, choose to play as an amateur, then
        start the game.  When you putt, the {A MULLIGAN} option will
        appear.  Click on {OLD} and your shots should decrease by one.
        Repeat until you are on stroke one, and put the ball in.

        The tricky control system can be best mastered by following these
        tips.  Don`t concentrate too hard on wrist snap, concentrate on the
        double click more (Wrist snap only adds 10% more power).  Get used
        to less difficult clubs first, such as the three wood with it`s
        larger strike bar.

    OVER THE NET:

        First, choose a one set game, play the sea-cup and enter one team or
        two human players.  When it's your turn to serve, move the
        non-serving player up to the top of the court close to the net.
        This will force one of the computer players to follow him.  Now do a
        jump serve (push up and fire), then hit the ball to the other
        computer player by pushing right then down.  The ball should drop
        between him and the net and he should miss the ball.  Hopefully this
        plan should work.  I don't know if it works with the other teams
        like Coco, Freaks etc but it works with the Rollers and the Golden
        Boys.

    OVERLANDER:
                    
        JUST A FEW TIPS - When cruising the highway don't stop shooting, and
        always choose the highest paid mission.  Buy fuel carefully, only
        enough fuel for that level, after level 1 you must buy a leanburner.
        Try to stay in the middle of the road and travel fast, travelling
        slowly only burns more fuel.  Fire bombs are more useful than smart
        bombs when you learn how to use them.  Bulletproofing is necessary
        after level 2.  When travelling through the barriers the best speed
        is 90-120mph.

        LEVEL 1:
    
            1. Select counterfeit money.
    
            2. Fuel up to 14 notches on the fuel guage.
    
            3. Get turbo, 4 battering rams and two flare bombs.
    
            4. After the first bikes slow down or the gunners will kill you.

            5. Destroy trucks from as far away as possible.

            6. Slow to 100-150 mph to negotioate barriers.

            7. If you stay in the middle lane when you come to the wrecks
               you wont die.

        LEVEL 2:

            1. Select kidnapped official.

            2. Fuel up to half full.

            3. Buy leanburner, a few bullet proofs, rams, and flare bombs.

            4. After first bikes there's a nasty surprise in the valley
               below.

        LEVEL 3: DARKLANDS

            1. Select plutonium.

            2. Fuel up to half full (if you have leanburner - if you don't
               then fill up to the max.

            3. Buy rams, bullet proofing, flare bombs and lives if you need
               them.

            4. The toughest part of the course is early on, so don't be
               afraid to let loose with the flare bombs.

        LEVEL 4: THE GUTTER RUN

            1. Select illegal chemicals. fill up to max level.

            2. Buy maximum rams, bullet proofs and as many lives as you can
               afford and flare and smart bomb depending on your bank
               balance.
            3. The barriers are every where on this level and you will need
               to be at 90 - 100 mph to avoid them all.  Try to save your
                rams for later in the level.

            4. The alleys in 4 are real mean.  Smartbombs and bullet
               proofing are your best chances of survival.

        LEVEL 5: GRAVEYARD

            1. Choose the president.  Fill up to maximum fuel.

            2. Buy everything $40,000 up front plus whatever you had from
               the last level should be enough, lives should be on the top
               of your shopping list followed by rams, proofing, brakes,
               armour and weapons - don't bother with the wheelblades!

            3. do the same as for the last level.  Because your car's at
               maximum everything, this level shouldn't proove too
               difficult.

    PACIFIC ISLANDS:

        On the filing screen simply pop up a file and instead of your name
        type in "Let me cheat!" (making sure you include the capital and
        exclamation mark).  Now instead of pressing return, hit the Reset
        button.  The number next to the losses column will now be 1, and
        this shows you are in the cheat mode.

        Now type your name in and you can get into the game as normal.
        When you reach the map screen where you choose which battle area to
        attack, you are now able to get to any of the squares on the map
        simply by holding down the right mouse button while clicking on any
        square.  In this cheat mode there are two major facilities.  If you
        press the 'LEFT AMIGA' key and 'W' during a scenario you will
        automaticly win the battle.  And if you go to the map screen screen
        during the game, and select a desination using the mouse, then
        pressing the 'LEFT AMIGA' key followed by the number of the unit
        you are playing (1, 2, 3 or 4), that unit will instantly go to the
        the destination marked.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    *PACLAND: (New cheat by K. Krellwitz)

        During play hold down 'S', 'I', 'U', and press 'RIGHT ALT'.  There
        should be a slight pause and the ghosts will reset to the starting
        position.  This will give you infinite lives.

        When the title screen appears, type "AVALON".  The screen should
        flash.  You should have unlimited lives.  If that doesn't work, try
        the following:

        Start a two player game.  Make it as far as you can with player one.
        With player two, you must be able to make it as far as the fairy to
        collect your boots.  Now that you have gotten your boots, you are
        going backwards to where you started.  Push the third cactus on the
        way back, and a yellow pacman will appear.  Get it, now kill player
        two.  Continue playing with player one.  Every time player one dies,
        get the yellow pacman with player two and kill player two
        immediately.  As long as you keep getting the yellow pacman with
        player two, player one will never die.

        HINTS:

            LEVEL 1:    Run to the third fire hydrant, and when you get
                        there, jump over it and push it to the left.  This
                        will give you a blue hat that will make you
                        invulnerable to the little ghosts that fall from
                        planes.

            LEVEL 2:    Run to the third cactus, and push it to the left.
                        You will now be invulnerable for the entire level!

            LEVEL 3:    After getting your magic boots, push the third
                        cactus on the way back for a free life.

        -Jump on the roof of ghost's car to escape.
    
        -Only use powerpills when ghosts are in range, or else it is wasted.

        -When you reach the breaktime sign, jump when you are about 1 inch
         away, for a bonus (depending how high you are when the level ends)

    PANZA KICK BOXING:

        The best moves to use are upper cut, round house, low leg kick.  The
        low leg kick is useful for keeping your opponent out of range and on
        target for a round house followed by an upper cut.  The double
        backfist is also very poweful and often provides a knockout punch.
        If you are losing a fight, and don't have much chance of recovery,
        then press the 'ESC' key so that your stats remain intact.

    PLAYER MANAGER:

        1.  Buy a few young, cheap players and keep them in the squad for a
            whole season. Next year, their price will have increased and you
            should have no trouble selling them for a huge profit. 

        2.  Only buy players with very high agility ratings, as this effects
            all their other attributes. If agility is high (about 200),
            expect the player to become an excellent footballer, given a
            season or two. 

        3.  Remove 8 or 9 players from your team, then after 2 or 3 big
            defeats you will receive sponsorship.

    POOL OF RADIANCE:

        Once you find any item you  can make as many copies of it as you
        want.

        1. Create a dummy character.

        2. Load a saved game and transfer all the good items to the dummy.

        3. Remove the dummy character from the party.

        4. Load the dummy character back in.

        5. Transfer the items to other members.

        6. Drop the dummy character from the party.

        7. Repeat steps 4-6 as many times as needed.

        This also works for Curse of the Azure Bonds and Champions of Krynn.

    POWERDROME:

        Here are some tips on the various tracks:

            Oval:   The secret with this track is to use as much afterburner
                    as possible, but without blowing up your engines.  Keep
                    your eye on the temperature gauge.  This track is fairly
                    wide, so switch the centering field OFF and pick up
                    speed.  Go around as fast as you can.

            Antacorp: A difficult track.  Turn the centering field up to
                    four or five, which will put you in the middle of the
                    course.  When you go through the underground chicane,
                    hold down the right shift key.  This will take you
                    through the vertical scanner without slowing down; then
                    straighten.

            Clortek: Shortly after the start line, you will encounter a
                    trench.  Don't waste your time flying through it; just
                    go over it.  When you reach the pressure gate, which is
                    around half way, don't slow down.  If you're going to
                    crash into it then slow down.  Hopefully this won't
                    occur, but in this instance it's no use fighting the
                    consequences.  When you come out of the exit, switch
                    the afterbunrers on.  Go for speed on this next stretch.

            Otyaka: It's main section's underground, very dark and at first
                    quite difficult.  The track careers from left to right
                    so turn the centering on at around level five.  Once you
                    emerge into the open, you'll come across a nasty right
                    hand hairpin, so hold down the centering key again.
                    This section takes some practice.

            Banzal: So named because it really is the hardest track.  Crank
                    the centering up as much as possible but reduce it down
                    to six if feasible and necessary.  You'll encounter the
                    same kind of underground dip as on the Otyaka course, so
                    use the same tactics.  If you get through this you are
                    GOOD.

            Apocalypt: This section has an alarmingly tight hairpin situated
                    three corners from the start.  Take it using centring
                    mode.  While underground you will go through a loop de
                    loop.  You get through this using gentle movements of
                    the mouse, with centring set around six.  This should
                    see you right.

            Estoria: Back into sunny climes and a fairly wide track.  Bomb
                    around the course with a low centring setting or none at
                    all.

    POWERMONGER:

        Instruct your captain to invent something, pause the game, put the
        game speed up to full, and wait a couple of minutes.  Now unpause
        the game, the captain will have kept inventing during the pause!

        When you wish to invent in double quick time, click invent and
        when your men leave, click on it again.  This often makes a
        catapult almost immediately, but this cheat only works once on
        each island.

        After killing the strange turtle-like creature on the first level,
        you should come to a screen with two carnivorous fish bouncing up
        and down in the water, along with four banks.  To get to the secret
        room don't jump over the first well.  Instead jump inside it and
        fall down into the secret room!

        Later on the first level, look out for a ladder near some water
        which leads up to a platform containing an egg.  Climb the ladder
        and take the egg, then go to the left into the water to find the
        submarine room.

        There is also a way to find some hidden extra food.  Go to the
        third screen of level three and jump forward hitting empty space.
        The hidden food should now appear.

        How to defeat the end-of-level guard that looks like a bulldog:
        Watch his hand, and when he has moved his finger three times it
        means he will reach for his gun - so shoot as quickly as possible.
        Next time he will fire at you after moving his fingers five times,
        and finally four times.  By anticipating all of his quick-draws in
        this way, you should always manage to kill him.

    *QUADRALIEN:

                                (LEVEL CODES)

                        LEVEL 2_________________"170961"
                        LEVEL 3_________________"010655"
                        CORE  4_________________"610169"

        Tips:  Once in the core, you can't quit.  So choose droids with
        good lasers, Jack and Spud for example.  The Quadralien mother is
        made up of 4 separate pieces grouped together and surrounded by
        Earthling boxes.  The mother can only be destroyed by blowing up
        each box from a different direction.  From the starting point there
        are three exits:  north, east, and west.  Go east and destroy the
        first box, return to the starting point, and go north to destroy
        the second box.  You will now have both droids to blow the
        remaining boxes.  Go west through the one-way force field, and get
        the other.  Don't forget to keep recharging.
