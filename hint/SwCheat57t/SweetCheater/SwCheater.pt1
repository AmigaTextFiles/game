    ***********************************************************************
    Due to lack of  interest on  my part, this will be my final  release of
    Sweet Cheater.  If anyone is  interested in continuing the list, I will
    gladly forward all  new cheats that I come across to you.  Since my new
    passion is writing hard drive installers, I don't  have the time to put
    into the cheat list.
    ***********************************************************************

    This cheat list contains well over 1000 cheats, hints,  and level codes
    for the Amiga and CD남. The game titles with my name after them are the
    ones that I have  found.  I have put quite a  bit of time into  finding
    some of these cheats, so if you  add any to your list all I ask is that
    you give me credit.   If you upload  the list to a bbs or include it on
    a compilation disk please do not remove or alter the header.

    All the games with an asterick (*) in front of them have been verified.
    If the game  has been verified and  has more than one cheat,  the cheat
    right after the  game title is  the one that has been verified,  but in
    some cases all the cheats may work.

    Some of the cheats may have changed throughout the list due to the fact
    that I have verified a  lot of them  and made corrections  when needed.
    If a cheat  didn't work before you may want to look at the cheat again,
    it may have been fixed.  I try to verify as  many as I can, but I don't
    have most of the games.  I won't verify a cheat with an * unless I have
    personally tested it and found that the cheat works.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    AAARGH!:

        At the start of each screen you'll find various buildings.  Blow
        fire over them, and then hit them.  This will make them fall down a
        lot faster.  When you burn or knock down a house you get an egg. 
        To beat the other monsters in a fight for an egg, don't jump around
        and breath fire, just hold your ground and punch forward.  After
        three or four falls, your foe will stay down.  Keep eating, even if
        it dosen't show any increase on screen, your health will skyrocket.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    ABANDONED PLACES 2:

        This cheat will increase your character's experience significantly.
        Attack and kill any single monster (or group of monsters).  When it
        (or they) begin to visibly fade away, cast any {HOLD MONSTER} spell
        that you have such as {DREAM} or {HOLD EVERYTHING}.  The creature
        will cease dimming and just sit there.  Now you can attack with
        your fighters or cast attack spells (including {FIRE AREA}).  To
        rake in experience points with no worry of the monster going
        anywhere until the spell wears off. This can be verified by
        watching the experience line in the character sheet grow while you
        are attacking the faded creature.  If you are quick enough, you can
        refreeze the monster, otherwise just go and find another one to
        repeat your trick on.

        play:
        
            'F10'______________Completes level and goes to bonus game.

        a special weapon, then exit.  When you re-appear, jump on the
        spring at the bottom left and just as you start flying upwards push
        up so that you hit an invisible block with a door on it.  Now go to
        the right across the floating platforms, but instead of going
        through the door as normal, stand on the edge above the door and
        fire the weapon.  Another invisible block should appear jump on

        level after this one, at the top right before the exit, there is
        a platform full of medipacks,climb the ladder that seems to go

        When you enter the last letter of the desired word you should hear
        a crunch sound.  If you don't hear the sound press 'RETURN' and

        will restart at the beginning.
        
        Select the two-player mode and switch the share credits option on.
        Then start the game. on the first level, go to the computer and log
        on.  Instead of typing {PPEAB} which would advance you to level 10,
        type "PPPEAB" (note 3 P's) when you now log off, you'll go straight
        to level 10.  If you go straight to the computer (a few screens
        above where you start) and log on, you'll find that you have a
        staggering five million credits, which really helps!

        Make your way to the third level without spending any money.  Now
        log on to the first Intex computer you find.  You should have about
        6000 credits.  Buy nothing, then log off.  It is important that no
        fire doors have been closed.  Now do a complete circuit of the
        level.  If you log back onto the same Intex computer, you will find
        you have loads of money.

        The level codes are; (log on to a computer then enter them)

            2-"XXDFA"   3-"RTHAA"   4-"LAEEA"   5-"UYTTA"   10-"PPEAB"

    *ATOMSMASHER:

        Type 'CATHERINE ZETA JONES' on the titlescreen and it'll say
        {Ready}.  Now start the game as normal and try pressing the
        following keys:

                'S'_________________________________Skip levels.
                'L'_____________Toggle infinite lives on or off.
                'I'____________Toggle invulnerability on or off.

                                (LEVEL EDITOR)

        Type 'ZANDALEE' for the level editor.  Here is how it works:

                 'ESC'__________________Return to the main menu.
                 'DEL'________Totally clears the selected depth.
                 'M'___Toggle between "block" and "baddie" mode.
                 'G'______________toggles graphic style through.
                 Metal, Rock, Snow, Brick and Crypton (Use on depth 2).

                 '[' & ']'_______Toggle through existing levels.
                 'F1'_____________Play level in one player mode.
                 'F2'_____________Play level in two player mode.

                               (DESIGNING A MAZE)

        Each level consists of 3 layers, and pressing 'D' will go through
        them.  Depth 0 is where the backgrounds are designed, depth 1 is
        where the ice, mud and mines go, and depth 2 is where you actually
        design the maze. On depth 2, pressing the 'SPACEBAR' takes you to
        the block select screen, where you can select any block by pressing
        the fire button on your joystick.  This then puts you in {block}
        mode (which appears at the bottom right of the screen) where you
        can place the block by pressing fire again.
 
                              (PLACING CHARACTERS)

        Select depth 2 and press 'M' to go into "baddie" mode. Position
        both players by pressing '1' and '2' at the desired position.  You
        can toggle through the baddies using the comma ',' and full-stop
        '.' keys, and can place them using fire, or replace existing
        baddies by first selecting the space, and then adding your
        preference.  Baddie characteristics can be changed by placing the
        cursor over it and then using the arrow keys:

                'Up'_____________________Increase baddie speed.
                'left'__Decrease rate the baddies drop hazards.
                'Right'_Increase rate the baddies drop hazards.
                      (from 01 (fastest) to 99 (slowest)
                     (00 means it'll never drop anything)
                'Down'_______________Increase drop speed by 10.

        Pressing '9' will change the speed at which the baddies will then
        appear.  Once you've placed all the initial baddies, pressing
        'RETURN' takes you onto the "que" screen, where you can place up to
        50 replensished ones.  Pressing '0' will change the time between
        these baddies appearing.  Any new levels can now be saved on a
        blank disk by returning to the main menu and selecting the save
        option.

        During play, type "TIGER" now press 'F5' for infinite energy.  Some
        of the other function keys do stuff, but nothing that will help you.

        If you accidentally hit either of those two keys, hold down the left
        mouse button and press 'F1'.  This will end the game and bring you

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    BANE OF THE COSMIC FORGE:
            
        The password to enter the door in the SE tower of the 1st level is
        "SNOOPCHERI".  Use the rotten cheese on the mousehole.  Some small
        help for playing the game successfully: When you create your
        characters, it may be a good idea just to make all of them Dracons. 

        This is untested, but unless you have at least one of this fire
        breathing race you surely wont survive the game.  So maybe it would
        be good to have more.  Use a good mix of the classes, try to take
        one of each spell class and a good solid thief that is at full
        strength.  Get a good enough thief and you dont need a fighter.  It
        may be slow, but keep rolling till you get the best character
        possible.  Be sure to make at least one character female, there are
        places in the game where this is a must.  Don't do it and be sorry
        later!  Diversify your skills. 

        Have each character specialise in a few skills relative to his
        class.  Do not worry about developing weapons skills, you have no
        use for them if you created your party correctly.  In fights early
        in the game use DRACONS BREATH ATTACK, just be careful not to over
        extend yourself.  Rest after each encounter, backing up your hard
        work.  Always search the area after a combat.  Search each square
        you step in.  Not only this, but search facing all four directions,
        many things can only be found that way.  Thieves are not always
        true.  If you find a lock and have your thief open it, allways
        guess it is poison unless you are 100% sure (I.E. tried it before)
        because it is better to suffer something else than to die by
        getting this wrong.  Don't bash doors early in the game!  If your
        characters are not very strong you will be sorry.  Jammed doors do
        you no good, as you might never be able to open them again.  Same
        goes for picking the lock.  Wait till you get a caster capable of
        conjuring knock knock with at least 18 points (prefereably 24) and
        do it this way.  It is much more sure.  Once you know there are
        secret panels or buttons,  keep walking past them until you
        discover them.  You can find them by looking at the maps and know
        where they are, sometimes it takes awhile to sense them.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    BEVERLY HILLS COP:

        On the screen displaying difficulty selection for the game, type
        "MELLIE".

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    BEYOND THE GATES:

        Type in "THE END OF TIME DRAWS NEAR" to call up the character
        editor.  You can now change your characters statistics and add any
        item to your inventory.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    *BIG RUN (Sales Curve):

        While playing, pause the game and move your joystick LEFT, RIGHT,
        DOWN, UP, UP, LEFT, DOWN, and RIGHT.  Note that you have to center
        the stick after every move.  Now the screen should flicker and
        you'll be the proud owner of infinite credits.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    *BIGNOSE THE CAVEMAN (Codemasters): (K. Krellwitz)

        Enter "MUSKI" for your name on the high score table to activate the
        cheat.  Now use the following keys during play:

                'F1'____For 9 lives (Won't show till you die).
                'F2'___________________________To skip levels.
                'F3'_____________________For triple rock shot.
                'F4'________________For 90 super power points.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    BIO CHALLENGE:

        During play, press 'ESC' to pause the game and press 'G'.  This
        will take you to the end of the level guardian.

        LEVEL 1:  Get the green armous as soon as possible. If you have all
                of the amulet, don't go to the sphere unless you have
                collected at least four lots of monster remains, you'll
                need them to battle the end of level guardian.  He's a
                bit soft in the head, so time your jumps carefully, and
                hit him there.

        LEVEL 2:  There are four planets to visit, go to everyone if you
                want to get maximum points.  Again, the green armour is
                very useful, so get it as quickly as possible.  There's
                loads of ammo for the guardian of this level,
                unfortunetly that means there's loads of monsters to deal
                with.  The back of the guardians head is the weak spot.

        LEVEL 3:  Stand on the slabs and summersault.  There are six
                planets here, and the transporters are more difficult to
                so, so you have to watch more carefully.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    *BIONIC COMMANDO:

        Exit level 1 exactly when the timer reads 1, for 9 extra lives and
        a high score.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    *BLACK MAGIC: (Keith Krellwitz)

        On the title screen, type "FARIN".  Now during play press 'ENTER' on
        numeric keypad to skip levels and press '-' on the keypad to add
        lives.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    *BLACKTIGER: (Keith Krellwitz)

        During play, push the joystick to the UPPER-LEFT, hold down the
        FIRE BUTTON, and press 'C'.  Now press 'DEL' to skip levels.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

        mode:

        Now use the following keys:

        '1'-'9', '0', '-', '=', '\', 'BACKSPACE'__________Select stage.
        'Q', 'W', 'E', 'R', 'T', 'Y'______________________Select stage.

        'DOWN CURSOR'___________________Subtract power from life meter.
        'LEFT CURSOR'___________________________________Subtract speed.
        'RIGHT CURSOR'_______________________________________Add speed.
        'DEL'_______________________________________________Enter shop.

        Enter "Mr*Pumpkin" as your password.  The screen should flash to
        let you know it worked.  During play press the 'CAPS LOCK' and
        press any of the following keys.
        
                'H'_________________________Gives you nine hit points.
                'L'______________________________Gives you nine lives.
                'J'___Give you nine of each power up and nine credits.
                'K'________________________________Gives you 999 gems.
                'F'______________________________________Not sure yet.
                'D'______________________________________Not sure yet.
                'O'__________________________________Opens up the map.
                
        Once you press one of the keys it won't show up.  If you press 'K'
        and the pick up a gem the gems will show 999.  If you die than all
        of it will show up.

        On the first level, when you come to the springy brick, jump to the
        left.  When you defeat the bees, go to the end where you will be
        rushed away by a whirlwind.
        
        The whirlwind will take you to jungle secret 1, and on completing
        this you will be taken to Bonus Paradise where you will be blessed
        with jewels and energy.

    BRIDES OF DRACULA:

        When you're Dracula, go right from the first screen and turn the
        first two women into vampires, taking them back to their coffins.
        Then return to that screen again, walk between the lift and the
        second table and crouch down just past the skulls on the floor. A
        vampire should then appear ready to be put into her coffin.  Do
        this again and again to get all eleven vampires, and then polish
        off heising before he knows what hit him.

            2.  Repeat #1 2 more times.
            3.  Now go to the bank and take out a fourth loan for 3,999,999

                but the money will appear in your account anyway.

        Success:

            1.  Offer 3 players for sale at the transfer-market. (remember
                the shirt numbers of each one).
            2.  Now get 3 new players and give them the same shirt numbers
                as the players you offered to sell.
            3.  Now take the players you put up forsale and put them on the

        If you pause the game you can still move your guns crosshair.

                                (GENERAL HINTS)

        1.  Shoot as many of the buildings as you can, as they block your
            shots at attacking / hiding enemies.

        2.  Shoot the enemies at the bottom of the screen as the bullets
            they fire needless time to get to you and can often trap you in
            a corner.

        3.  Don't forget that you can shoot the enemies' bullets!

        4.  Try to pick up the bonuses straight away.  The 100, 200 and 300
            point bonuses are very useful if you want extra lives.

        5.  Collect special weapons straight away as their rapid fire
            removes buildings faster, giving more breathing space.

        6.  The grey uniformed soldiers (the ones that take a few shots to
            kill) can give a grenade or a special weapon. When he does, two
            men carrying a stretcher will appear.  Shoot these and they
            will give you two grenades, collect them and then shoot them
            again before they go, to receive two more grenades.

        7.  Never stay in corners for too long, the enemy has a habit of
            zeroing in on you.

        8.  Don't waste grenades on buildings unless you really need to.
            If you opt to shoot in small bursts at every building rather
            than concentrating on one building at a time then a grenade may
            finish the job a lot quicker.

        9.  Try not to get killed when the end-level guardians appear
            otherwise your FOE meter will drop to zero and you'll have to
            start again.

    CAMPAIGN:

        If you find yourself with light tanks facing up to much heavier
        opposition on the simulator, use your speed and ram the enemy.
        Then fully depress your gun and open fire, it only takes a few
        rounds to obliterate your enemy (easier from side or rear).

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    *CANNON FODDER:

        Go to the save game option, then the game requests a name type
        "JOOLS".  Cheat mode active will flash at the bottom of the screen
        and the ranks and abilities of your men will have increased.

                                        (HINTS)

        1.  In Choppas, land on the enemy to kill them, safer than landing
            and getting out.

        2.  I missions in which you have control of a lot of troopers
            seperate the lowest ranking trooper from the rest and give him
            all the weapons, make sure the rest are safe, then attempt the
            mission with one trooper.  If the trooper dies just press
            'ESC'.  This saves a lot of troopers later, such as in mission
            18 phase 5 of 5 - The Door.

        3.  Troopers are able to throw grenades quite along way and over
            walls, trees, and buildings.  Use this to your advantage to
            protect against Biggunz and Jeeps.  To throw a grenade a long
            way, simply position the pointer further than needed.

        4.  Buildings can be destroyed even if you can't see them.  For
            instance, if a trooper is in Biggun and there is a building
            slightly off the edge of the screen, roughly aim at the
            building making sure the pointer is at the very edge of the
            screen and fire.

        5.  Learn to control Jeeps and Skidooz early on (how to skid
            them).  In later levels you may need good control to hit ramps
            at correct angles otherwise you can blow up if you hit walls. 
            This is also useful to get away from shells, rockets, and
            grenades.

        6.  An effective way of destroying snipers is to just run straight
            towards them and shoot you guns.  Don't waste grenades on them
            unless it is necessary.

    CHAOS STRIKES BACK:

        1.  Find a dragon, then cast "MON ZO GOR SAR" and press 'ESC' to
            pause the game.
        2.  Hold down 'ALT' and type "LORD LIBRASULUS SMITHES THEE DOWN".
            Unpause the game and slay the dragon.  He should leave a
            firestaff for you and you should be invincible.

        How to kill any dragon:

            1.  Prepare all your players with "MON IR VEN" spells (mega
                poison cloud).

            2.  Use the green freeze life box (on the dragon)

            3.  Cast the spells, and then double up on each player (ie.
                each player casts 2 spells for a total of 8).

            4.  Wait... dinner will be served soon.

        Using the Vorpal Blade:

            If you don't have both Vorpal Blades, you can increase the
            number of hits per time by passing the weapon back and forth
            between the two attacking players.  Attack with one player and
            pass blade to another player and have this player attack.  Now
            pass the blade back and attack.  Continue until the monster is
            dead.

    *COLONIZATION: (Booga)

        When starting a new colony name it "Charlotte".  This will allow you
        to see all maps instantly, other European ports, check other county's
        statistics, and gives you $50,000.  When you access the other
        countries european ports you can spend all there money, I did this by
        recruiting loads of people, but you can buy anything.

        If you rename your colony to some thing else you can then start
        another colony called charlotte and get another $50,000. I started a
        colony got 50000 then abandond (sp) it lot's of times and started the
        game with 500,000.

        You could also type "COLIN BROKE MMY WALKMMAN" on the section where
        you have to collect nickles.  The reason why you have to type two

    CURSE OF THE AZURE BOND:

        See the POOL OF RADIANCE cheat.

        In case anyone was wondering, The `Wizard in Red' refers to
        Dracandros.  He is the owner of the Crescent Moon bond.  The
        `Woman in Green' refers to the leader of the Cultists of Moander.
        They, of course, are the owners of the Mouth in the Hand bond,
        which is the symbol of the God Moander.  The `Lord of the Black'
        refers to the leader of the Zhentrim, or `Black Network', an evil
        alliance of priests, mages and thieves that operate out of Zhentil
        Keep.  They own the big `Z' in the Triangle bond.  Lastly, `The
        Flamed One' is, of course, good old Tyranthraxus.  He owns the
        Flaming Bond, which is the Symbol of Tyranthraxus.

        To defeat Tyranthraxus, you must gather the Amulet of Lathander,
        which is in Zhentil Keep, the Helm of Dragons, which is currently
        being kept by Dracandros in his castle near Haptooth, and the
        Gauntlet of Moander, which is kept by Mogion (the Woman in Green!)
        in Yulash.  You must take these items to the Pool of Radiance.

    DELUXE GALAGA (Ver 2.3 & 2.4): (Sean Courtney)

        If you die during a warp malfunction, the game skips the tax-free
        shop and the next level.  You can use this to your advantage in the
        harder levels, especially in the Big Trouble stages.  So make sure
        you have plenty of lives left.  When you get to the level you want
        to skip, especially Big Trouble, just pray for a warp malfunction!
        If you get a warp malfunction, just kill yourself once (It's a good
        idea not to do this until there's only one alien left on the
        screen).

                                    (OTHER HINTS)

        1.  It is generally not a good idea to spend any credits until you
            have 500.  When you get 500 credits, buy the Super Weapon.

        2.  If you hold down the fire button (make sure to disable autofire
            if you have it on) from the moment you grab the Meteor Storm
            icon right up to the end of the Meteor Storm, you will get the
            secret $5000 bonus (This only works in version 2.4 and possibly
            the upcoming 2.5).

        3.  On Version 2.4, it is not a good idea to buy the $3000 weapon
            until you're in levels 51-75.

        4.  The weapons that cost $750 and higher are generally not very
            handy unless you have autofire (Ver 2.4).  If you do have
            autofire and have one of these weapons, what you have is an
            incredibly nasty weapon!

        5.  You can also "cheat" by using a hex editor and editing the main
            program.  Just find the part of the code that lists all the
            prices in the tax-free shop (make sure they are not part of the
            menu, if you modify the menu in any way the game won't run!)
            and change the numbers to whatever you want.  This way, you can
            make everything cost nothing if you want!  However, you'll
            still need $50 to enter the shop, and $400 for continues (or
            $200, in version 2.3).

                                    (GAME SECRETS)

        01. Catching a skull will add to the chances that extra life and
            cash multiplyer bonuses appear.

        02. By shooting the hurry-up ship, you can collect the rank marking
            that you are missing.

        03. When a smart bomb have exploded and the gems are falling. You
            can collect them by holding down the joystick.
 
        04. If you have a multiply when entering the meteor-storm, you may
            get alot of points.

        05. Catching a warp icon in an alien stage with a bonus level will
            give you a perfect score.

        06. Red, Green and Blue skulls will give you a very good weapon.
            Full fire power and the best ship speed.

        07. When a hurry-up ship have appeared 8 times. A money ship will
            appear.  Shooting this ship can give you alot of money.

        08. If you have a weapon type, and catch the same weapon, you will
            get more firepower.

        09. Completing the Meteor-storm will give you 100,000 points and
            1,000 in cash. And if you ... hmm. He He..

        10. You can figure out what skull you have not taken by looking at
            the colour of the meteors in the meteor storm.

        11. If you have caught 2 aliens and the scope is active. You can get
            alot of points by the aliens off the screen.

        12. If you have the rank of Admiral and you buy more rank markings,
            you will get 1,000,000.
 
        13. Having a multiply active when completing the game will give you
            alot of points.

        14. If you have all the rank markings for a new rank, and then buy
            more rank markings, you will instead buy a new rank.

    DETROIT (ECS & AGA): (Terry Wood)
    
        If you want to be sure to earn a profit in your first month of 
        DETROIT, you can plug the following number values into the
        appropriate places in the tutorial (see "Technical Supplement and
        Tutorial" booklet).  They will guarantee you a reasonable return
        for at least your dirst few months in business.  The first set of
        values gives you hints, the second set gives you decent, but not
        optimal exact numbers, and the third set gives you the absolute
        best numbers.

        Important Tutorial Change:  When you first start the game, you will
        now see a difficulty panel appear with possible settings.  The
        toughest setting is LOAN, where your company starts off in debt to
        the bank, with no capital funds.  The easier the setting you
        choose, the more money your company will have as a beginning stake.
        In order for these numbers to work in the tutorial, set the
        difficulty level as medium.

        Get all the expirence points you want by going to Prince Haagkens
        castle.  Make your way past the bats, past the first fireplace with

        switch that activates a door two or three rooms farther on in the
        castle when you step on it.  This door leads to a water fountain.
        Looking into the fountain transports you to a room filled with
        water that has a never ending supply of water monsters.  Take your
        best weapon and armour with you. Set your character on 'auto kill'
        and if he or she is able to hang in there, you can leave the
        character in the room for several hours or all night killing off
        zillions of monsters.  Do this for each of your characters and
        you'll easily be able to kill the giant dragon.

    EMPIRE SOCCER:

        Select the ten minute game and hold down the fire button at all
        times (even when your player gets the ball).  Stop running but keep
        the fire button pressed.  The opposition will immediately slide
        tackle you.  This will almost always cause them to get fouled.
        They will be given a yellow card (and eventually a red one) and
        eventually be sent off the field.  Continue this until there is 
        only three players left on the opposing team (the goalie and two
        field men).  You might be able to get more players fouled out, but
        it may be hard.  You should now have all you players and will be
        able to run circles around the opposing team.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

        with a patch on it that looks like a section of the firewall spell.
        As quickly as you can, walk on this patch and you will be whisked
        away to secret levels.

    *ESCAPE FROM THARKAN: (Keith Krellwitz)

        On the title screen, type "I WOULD IF I COULD" and then press any
        key on the keyboard.  The screen should flash red to let you know 
        it worked.  Now during play use the following keys:

            'F1'__________The computer will play for you (on/off).
            'F2'______________________Stops the tanks from firing.

        This only works in one player mode.  When you reach the reptillion,
        run past it and stand in the center of the joint of the gates that
        block your way.  When here waggle the joystick left and right and
        keep dropping bombs.  In a few moments you'll go through the doors
        and appear on the other side.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

        type "SPAM" instead.  The game will start, and you'll have infinite
        lives and you won't need any of the keys.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    EYE OF THE BEHOLDER:
            
        Make two copies of disk 2 then make up your parties on both disks.
        Play the game as usual, but when you find any secret passages or
        walls, or unlock any doors, insert the other disk and continue
        playing for a short while.  This passes all the data onto this
        disk.  Replace the original disk and continue playing and now, if
        you get stuck in the game and you have to start again, simply
        continue with the other disk and all the doors that were previously
        locked will be open. Plus, you'll be able to pick up the keys that
        you needed to unlock them as a bonus!

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

           boost all the statistics in this order:  STRENGTH, INTELLIGENCE,
           WISDOM, DEXTERITY, CONSTITUTION, CHARISMA, AND HIT POINTS.  Now
           you can click on strength and boost it to maximum, regardless of
           limitation put on the race or class of the character, so from
           now on, for example, you can have a super-hard wizard with a
           strength of 18/99.
        
        2. At the character generation screen, always increase all stats
           that you can (that includes hit points) to as high as they will
           go.
        
        3. If you want a mage, cleric or paladin to use a two handed
           weapon as well as magic, then do the following. Put the weapon
           down on the ground, and their spellbook or magic symbol in their
           second hand.  Click the right mouse button on this for a list of
           spells to appear.  Pick up the two handed weapon and place it in
           the characters primary hand.  As the list of spells is still up,
           they can now cast spells and use a two handed weapon at the same
           time.  You will have to repeat this process after using the
           compass etc.
           
        On the wasp level, stand on the spot where the two rooms join (the
        room to the south which has a crack in the wall - the hornet's

        killed easily to gain experience points.

        To take off you have to use the afterburners.  117 degrees is the
        furthest south you'll be able to fly, but you can go in other
        directions.  Is there more to this back door?

        open.  Repeat as often as you need.

        Go to the dark evil castle.  Stand right up against the force
        field.  Let yourself starve so that you faint.  When you wake up,
        you'll be on the other side of the forcefield.

        Nothing will happen except your bravery points will keep piling up.

        while speaking with the sorceress and luck increases to 65.  Ask

        A secret entrance to the fort exists.  On the left side, near even
        with the door.
        
        If running low on Green keys, use a secret entrance for the fort.
        It's on the left side, almost even with the door.

        Beating the Turtle is not beating, it is pushing, so push the
        turtle across the land, to use it in special places: The turtle was
        programmed in asbestos, and can swim in Lava. It can be used to
        enter the black citadel at the south.  Also, while it is present,
        you are not attacked, but by the time one has the turtle, one is
        already invincible.

    FEDERATION OF FREE TRADERS:

        Advancement in rank has nothing to do with the amount of credits to
        your name.  It is releated to the number of missions you complete
        and ships destroyed. The only way to earn a lot of credits is to
        haggle on the trade-net.  By staying in the space station on the
        net, and trading in guns, food and gold, you will quickly build a
        fortune.  Travelling to space stations requires you to jump until
        you cannot get any further.  Guide to completing the missions:

            MISSION 01: Take message: Just go there! Use e pod.

        Go to the pits, escape from the game and go to accelerate time.
        This should now finish the grand prix in pole position.  It might
        be that you have to do this on the last lap.

        Slip into the pits after your first lap and then simultaneously
        hold down the keys that make up the word "PALIR" and press the fire
        button.  Not only will you be unable to crash but the game will not
        react as though you have pressed 'F4'.

        Race a non-championship race and keep driving untill the last lap.
        Then enter the pits and drive to your pit-crew.  Wait for the
        message "Race over".  This way you will always win the race.

        If you select a system around 650 light years away from your
        position you will get an in range fuel reading allowing you to make
        jumps of that distance making things much easier on long hauls.
        
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    FRONTIER CD32 (Game Tek):

        For more cargo buy at least one ton of rubbish and go to a system
        where you won`t be caught for dumping it.  Then go to the cargo
        screen and click a bit below the rubbish box.  You should notice
        that the remaining cargo has gone up but the ammount of rubbish
        has stayed the same.  Keep doing this and soon you`ll have enough
        cargo space to get a large plasma accelator.  If you do this in a
        small ship, eventually you`ll be able to buy a class 7 hyperdrive
        and jump a long way across the galaxy with somewhere around 50 tons
        of fuel.

        discovered the beast attacking the woman and her child, and also
        have the fuses and have uncovered the tap, go back up to the

    *GHOST 'N' GOBLINS:

        On the high score table, enter your name as ")!(".  This will make
        you invincible.  Although, you will still lose your armour if you
        get hit.

        The following didn't work on my version:

        Type "DELBOY" on the credit screen for invincibility..

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    *GHOSTBUSTERS II:

        Hold down 'ALT', 'CTRL', 'S', and 'U' when the activision logo
        appears and press fire.  You should have infinite lives (except on
        level 3).  This also stops the cable from breaking on level one.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    *GHOULS 'N' GHOSTS:

        Start the game and type "KARENBROADHURST" for invicibility.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    *GIGANOID:

        On the player select screen, press the 'CAPS LOCK' key, so the key
        light is on.  Now press and hold the 'CAPS LOCK' and press fire.  A
        message should appear letting you know the cheat is active.  If you
        held down the fire button a little to long the game may have
        started and bypassed the message, but you should notice you have a
        lot of lives.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    GLOBAL EFFECT:

        Type "PLENTY MORE WHERE THAT CAME FROM".  Go with the `Snooze Button`
        in CLI.  In the Pull-up-menu `GLOBAL EFFECT` you can now selected
        `Zzzz` and all you trouble are over.

    *GLOBAL GLADIATORS: (Keith Krellwitz)
    
        To skip a level enter the following sequence with the joystick:
        U,L,D,R,U,L,F,D,R,F, and F.  Now press 'P' to complete the level.

        enter the following sequence with the joystick.
        U,L,D,R,U,L,F,D,R,F,F,D,R,U,L,F, and F.  Now press 'P'.
        
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    *GLOBDULE: (Keith Krellwitz)
    
        During play hold down 'CTRL', 'LEFT SHIFT', 'LEFT ALT', and press
        'RIGHT ALT'.  Now use the following keys:
        
                'F3'______________Meet your quota and open exits.
                'F4'______________________________Complete level.
                'F9'_______________________Restart current level.
                'CTRL'_____________________________Invincibility.
                'C'______________Change score to screen location.
                'T'_____________________________________Not sure.
                'DEL'_____________________See description bellow.
                '-'___Used in conjunction with 'DEL' (slow down).
                '='____Used in conjunction with 'DEL' (speed up).

        When you press 'DEL' on the main map screen you can go to any
        level.  On the level map pressing 'DEL' will let go to any stage in
        any order.  Press 'DEL' during actual play lets you move any where.

    GLOBULUS:

        To activate the cheat mode type "Zvmo!EG" as a password.  Type
        exactly as shown.

        The most important thing to remember is that all the puzzles can be
        solved without losing a life, so if you lose a life and think its
        the only way to solve the screen, look closely.  Some of the
        puzzles get pretty obscure after level 10, but once you eventually
        beat them you'll kick yourself for not seeing the solution earlier.

        Look before you leap.  Think about how the screen will look from a
        flipped perspective.  A lot of jumps you make will be unnecessary
        and waste time and switches if you don't.

        Make sure you have enough switches, at least 10 per screen.  It is
        possible to get stuck on a downward slope with no way to get back
        up or kill yourself, and the only way out is to press 'ESC' and
        start the whole game over.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    *GLOOM: (Michael Robinson)

        On disk 2 of gloom in the dir 'misc' there is a file named 'script'.
        Use a XPK decruncher or Crunchmania to decompress this file.  Now
        load the file into a text editor and you will be able to edit the
        script to start at any level.  Now save the script and recrunch it
        with Crunchmania or a XPK packer that supports Crunchmania.  I used
        XFDcruncher/decruncher, which is available on Aminet.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    GOAL:

        If one player is sent off, press the 'AMIGA' key to bring up the
        substitute screen.  Click on a substitute and then on the player
        just sent off.  Exit, and you'll notice that a sub comes out, but
        no one comes off.

    *GODFATHER, THE:

        Pause the game with the 'HELP' key, then type "PIZZA HUT".  This
        will give you infinite energy.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    GODS:
            
        On level two, buy a shield and a magic potion, then get three
        fireballs and three stars.  Spend all of your remaining money on
        food and health.  Collect all the gems in the usual manner, then
        get a key and make for the exit.  Now comes the tricky bit.  When
        you descend the last ladder, two thieves will appear.  Make sure
        that you don't quite have enough energy to survive a direct
        contact!  Before going down the ladder, release your magic potion,
        then climbdown and open the door.  Stand in front of the door
        ready to leave, but don't push up yet!  Wait until the thieves
        jump down at you and as soon as they touch you push the joystick
        up.  You may loose that life, but then something rather strange
        will happen.  The bonus will start to whiz up for quite some time,
        until the game starts again on world two with 28 extra men and
        about five million points!

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    GOLDEN AXE:

        Play in one player mode but with two joysticks.  When you die,

        the bonus level to go to the next level.  Hold 'F5' for a couple of
        seconds and you will become indestructable.  Press 'F2', 'F5',
        'F4', 'F3' one at a time for infinite everything.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    *GOLDRUNNER II:

        On the high score table, type "EASYMODE".  Press 'F9' to skip

    GRAHAM GOOCH'S WORLD CLASS CRICKET:

        When batting, to get a lot of runs press 'P' when the fielder picks
        up the ball to pause the game.  The fielder will be frozen, but your
        batsmen won't.  Simply waggle the joystick and your batters will
        run.  You can now chalk up a high score.  When you've had enough
        simply press 'P' again to unpause the game.  You can also press the
        'SPACE' twice while your bowler is running to start your bowl again.

        NOTE: This cheat may work on Brian Lara's WC Cricket as it is
              effectively the same game.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    *GRAND MONSTER SLAM:

        On the main option screen, type "Losers.help!" to activate the
        cheat.   The screen will flash and the message 'YOU CANNOT LOSE!'
        will appear in the upper left corner.  Now even if you do lose you
        win!  That's 'SHIFT' + 'L' at the beginning and 'SHIFT' + '1' at
        the end and the '.' is on the main keyboard.

        On the main options screen, type "professional" and the message
        'Professional Mode!' will appear in the upper left corner.  This
        allows you to start in the professional league.
        
        If you make a mistake typing select the 4th option 'Hall of Fame'
        and press fire to get back to the main options screen.  You will
        now be able to re-enter the cheat.

        NOTE:  Only one can be active at a time.

    HARDBALL (ACCOLADE):

        VARIOUS HINTS:
 
        - Allstars are better than champs. 

        - Only steal if you actually hit the ball. 

        - Try to get a lot of runs early, as the computer team improves
          towards the end. 

        - Bunting rarely works. 

        - Halfway through the match, swap Laws for Wells and Wratten for
          Harris. 

        - The best pitchers are OLIVER, PEREZ, LEARY, COOK.  The others
          will only be successful for a short while. 

        - Never pitch fastballs to the center as they will usually
          result in home runs. 

        - Change pitchers after a few innings, because as they get
          tired, their accuracy and speed get worse.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    *HARD DRIVIN 1:

        Get the car up to top speed the press 'N' (for nuetral).  Now you

    HARD DRIVIN II:

        Select manual gears, and then press 'N' during the game when you
        reach top speed.  You will now zoom around on the circuit. (Also
        works on Hard Drivin' I.)

        At the start, turn the car around 180 degrees.  The display should
        now show the "wrong direction" message.  Head off under the bridge
        until you get to a split in the road.  Take the right hand branch
        and keep going until you reach a checkpoint.  Go through and turn
        the car through 180 degrees until your heading the other way.  Go
        back through the checkpoint in the right direction and you should
        hear a ping.  Keep going to the finish and once under the bridge
        let the clock run down to zero.  You should now get a message
        saying that you've qualified for the race. (Also works on Hard
        Drivin' I.)

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    *HARD 'N' HEAVY (Reline): (Stefan Miller-Bergfriede)

        Lose all your lives till you are on your last one.  Now find a
        gorge (2nd level) and wait till the time is at 01.  As soon as the
        timer hits 1 walk into the gorge.  You should get times up and the
        game will restart, but as soon as it does you will die again.  Now
        it will restart again and you will have 99 lives.

        hopper and jump up to the lower of the two platforms above you.
        Disengage the space hopper and jump across to the other platform,
        then leap over the low wall.  When you land, keep on firing to see
        where the ground is and move across to the point where you're
        walking on air.  Run left until you cannot go further, jump up and
        you'll hit an invisible warp.  You'll be prompted to insert disk 1,

                            +---------+---------+
        
        Your party should now be invincible, while still able to build up
        their stats.

    HERO QUEST:

        Read this, if you want to get loads of money (in the game).
        Simply get your men to complete the first mission then enter them in
        the last.  As soon as they appear, get one of them to search and
        collect the money if there's any there.  Then simply leave via the
        staircase with the money.  Keep this up until you've got enough
        money to buy the necessary equipment.  As for the artifacts that you
        can get during the game, well the same sort of thing can be done to
        acquire these.  Enter the mission, find the artifact and then get
        out.  Now just go back to the same mission and get someone else to
        pick up the the artifact in your question.  This way each of your
        characters have the top of the range weapons and armour.

    HEROES OF THE LANCE (SSI):

        SOME GENERAL TIPS:  

        Arrange your party so that the first line consists of two strong
        warriors, raistlin and goldmoon.  This allows you to use Raistlin's
        magic and the healing staff of goldmoon without too much hassle.
        Save tanis and riverwind for the later levels, where the bows come
        in handy.

        When fighting gully dwarves, use Tasslehoff who is the same height
        as them.  His sling stones will never miss.  Avoid fighting
        hatchlings, they're not worth it.  Just turn and run when you meet
        one; when you reach an intersection move into a new path and wait a
        little.  When you return, the hatchling will have gone.

        KILLING BOZAKS:  TWO METHODS:

        (1) Get raistlin to use a web, sleep or charm spell to stun it,
            then send a warrior to clobber it to death

        (2) Select Flint, who is a dwarf; 9 out of 10 times, the bozak's
            shots will go over his head; get close to enter melee combat,
            and use low thrusts to kill it.

        SPECTRAL MINIONS:  They're easy to kill, so use a warrior.

        WRAITHS:  A well-timed throw of an axe kills them every time.  If
                  you miss, use a sword and chest thrust movements.  Don't
                  let it get too close to you!

        SPIDERS:  Use low thrusts to keep them at bay.  If they get through
                  your guard, retreat until you can turn and fight again.

        The blue and green potions restore health, red slows down monsters,
        and yellow give your characters extra confidence.

    *HOI:

        Try the following to gain access to the first four levels (the last
        level, level 5, is only available when you complete level 4): On the
        level-access screen, place the "LVL" mouse pointer in the far bottom
        right of the green quarter screen.  The bottom "L" must be
        positioned in the corner with pixel perfect precision (two pixels on
        the pointer will be hanging over the edge to the right).  Click the
        left mouse button, then shift the "LVL" mouse pointer to the very
        top left of the screen (as far as you can physically move the mouse
        to the top left) and click the left mouse button again.  Now you can
        get 12 lives at any time by pressing 'F4' during the game.

        1.  If a Builder hits a steepish slope he will stop building and
            turn around.

        2.  On the early levels practice using the lemmings special
            abilities.  Try completing level one without Climbers and level
            two without Floaters.

        3.  On Blizzard level two, you will need to use the Digger/Builder
            method to block off the lemmings.

        4.  On Blizzard level 14 the exit is hidden under snow in the steel
            boxes in the bottom left corner!  Use Miners and Bashers to get
            there.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    *HYBRIS:

        Once the game is loaded and prompts you to press fire, press the
        "SPACE BAR" instead.  You will be able to change the speed of the
        enemy bullets and other stuff, with the mouse and keyboard.  On the
        high score table, type "COMMANDER" on the high score screen (not as
        your name) press 'F7' to activate the super weapons 'F1-F6'.  You
        should also be invincible.  'F10' turns cheat on/off and 'F8'
        advances a level.  On the title screen press 'SPACE' or 'ESC' for
        an options menu.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    HYDRA:

        During play, type "KILLKILLKILL" to activate the cheat mode.  Now
        press 'F' to refuel and the 'RETURN' key to select weapon.
