    ***********************************************************************
    Due to lack of  interest on  my part, this will be my final  release of
    Sweet Cheater.  If anyone is  interested in continuing the list, I will
    gladly forward all  new cheats that I come across to you.  Since my new
    passion is writing hard drive installers, I don't  have the time to put
    into the cheat list.
    ***********************************************************************

    This cheat list contains well over 1000 cheats, hints,  and level codes
    for the Amiga and CD남. The game titles with my name after them are the
    ones that I have  found.  I have put quite a  bit of time into  finding
    some of these cheats, so if you  add any to your list all I ask is that
    you give me credit.   If you upload  the list to a bbs or include it on
    a compilation disk please do not remove or alter the header.

    All the games with an asterick (*) in front of them have been verified.
    If the game  has been verified and  has more than one cheat,  the cheat
    right after the  game title is  the one that has been verified,  but in
    some cases all the cheats may work.

    Some of the cheats may have changed throughout the list due to the fact
    that I have verified a  lot of them  and made corrections  when needed.
    If a cheat  didn't work before you may want to look at the cheat again,
    it may have been fixed.  I try to verify as  many as I can, but I don't
    have most of the games.  I won't verify a cheat with an * unless I have
    personally tested it and found that the cheat works.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    *R-TYPE:

        On the high score table, enter "SUMITA." for infinite lives.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    *R-TYPE II:

        Pause the game, then hold the LEFT MOUSE BUTTON and 'F1', then
        release both.  The screen will turn green, then press 'P' to unpause
        the game.  You are now invincible.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    RAIDER:

        The level codes are "SHOT", "DYKE", "HIGH", "LINK", "PEAR", "KILN",
        and "BAND".

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    RAILROAD TYCOON:

        Hold down the 'SHIFT' key and 'Y' key for lots of extra money.
        (stop at 32,000,000)

        To increase your cash balance by $500,000, enter the 'F1' screen.
        Hold down the 'SHIFT' key and hold down the '4' key to produce a
        dollar sign.  You'll immediately inherit lots of money. Apparently
        this only works from the main continent screen.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    *RAINBOW ISLANDS:

        Collecting all of the gems in the correct order of color (from left
        to right on the gem counter - RED, ORANGE, YELLOW, GREEN, LIGHT
        BLUE, DARK BLUE, and MAUVE) not only awards you the life and Bonus
        Gem, it also grants you access to a magical secret room.  When you
        reach the end of the level, a silver door appears.  You don't have
        to fight the Boss.

        On the fifth island you'll find a box in the secret room which you
        should collect.  There's also a gate with a '7' on it, leading to
        island 7.

        Even more useful is how to create any color gem.  The screen is
        split into several invisible vertical stripes of color.  When a gem
        falls, its color is determined by the `color' of the area into which
        it fell.  Now all you have to do is guage ca refully where the dead
        enemy will fall to create the gem color of your choice.

        Type one of the following on the title screen, while the rainbow is
        cycling through colors:

            "BLRBJSBJ"_____________________________Permanent fast shoes.
            "RJSBJSBR"________________________Permanent double rainbows.
            "SSSLLRRS"__________________________Permanent fast rainbows.
            "BJBJBJRS"___________________________________________Hint a.
            "LJLSLBLS"___________________________________________Hint b.
            "LBSJRLJL"_______________________Continue after island five.
            "RRLLBBJS"_______________All hidden food becomes money bags.
            "RRRRSBSJ"____________________Does both of the previous two.
            "SRBJSLSB"____________________Gives you 100 million counter.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    *RAJD PRZEZ POLSKE (Avalon): (K. Krellwitz)

        At anytime, type any of the following:

              "AKADEMIKRULEZ"__________________For auto pilot/drive.
              "WODKAITANCE"______Disables collision with other cars.
              "PATRYCJA"_______________Continue after time runs out.
              "KOCHAMPATRYCJE"_________Continue after time runs out.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    RALLY CHAMPIONSHIPS: (Michael Robinson)

        Find a car you want, but cant afford.  Now, leave the game.  Find
        the name of the car you want and .txt, so if you wanted an Escort,
        you would find Escort.txt.  Now use a text editor (I use TXED) and
        find a number (at the beginning).  It should look something like
        00000012345.  Now, replace the places where the 12345 # is and put
        0s in there place.  Now just leave a trailing 1.  Now the car will
        cost all of $10.  This is not only a way to get the car you want,
        but makes it cheaper to just buy a new car each time instead of
        refueling/fixing dammage.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    RALLY CROSS CHALLENGE:

        On the fifth track, drive around until you reach the wooden level
        crossing.  Turn the car 90 degrees and drive down the track at full
        speed, until you reach the end.  The race will end giving you 28
        race points.  When the game starts, follow the railroad tracks and
        the screen will go blank.  Now you will find yourself with 24
        tokens.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    RAMBO III:

        On the high score table, enter "RENEGADE" for your name.  Press
        '1'-'3' to start at the corresponding level.
        
        GENERAL HINTS:

            (1) When inside the 2nd building, wear your IR goggles. 

            (2) Don't walk in front of soldiers, since it will trigger an
                alarm and about 8 soldiers will jump you! 
            (3) If you enter a dark room, use the glow tube. 

            (4) Never use a gun without a silencer. 

            (5) Turn off the electric door with switch located several
                rooms away. 

            (6) The mine detector won't work without the generator. 

            (7) The IR goggles won't work without a battery. 

            (8) Watch out for ir beams, since they also trigger alarms. 

        Here's a list of items you can find:  ARROWS, SILENCER, FIRST AID
        KIT, IR GOGGLES, GLOW TUBE, BATTERY, KEY, MINE, DETECTOR (IN 2
        PIECES), PISTOL, AMMO, and RUBBER GLOVES.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    RAMPAGE:

        If you're on the last building and a cloud of dust appears under it
        punch in any direction and keep your finger on the fire button until
        the next screen is displayed, where upon you will be able to climb
        up an invisible building which is in the same place as the last
        building on the previous screen.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    RBI BASEBALL II:

        When your opponent reaches third base, keep the joystick held left,
        hold down 'shift' and press fire and the player will be hit out
        every time.

        Stand in the very top corner while batting and it is possible to
        hit the ball out of the stadium.

        When the computer is pitching, press 'P' to go to the substitution
        screen where you can change the computers pitcher for an inferior
        one.

        When your opponent reaches third base, hold the joystick left, hold
        down 'SHIFT' and press Fire, and he will be hit out.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    SECRET OF THE SILVER BLADES:

        Look at the entry for pool of radiance for full details on how to
        cheat this game.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    SENSIBLE SOCCER:

        To score off a corner every time, kick the ball towards the goalie.
        When a forward gets hold of it, kick it across the goal mouth and
        use after-touch to bend it into the net.  The computer never quite
        manages to work out what is going on until it is too late.  When
        your match appears next on the fixtures screen, for example
        England (You) vs Germany (The Opposition), instead of choosing next
        match, click on Exit.  Now choose friendly from the main menu and
        choose Germany as your team.  Go to the Team/Formations Screen and
        get all the German star players on the bench, put the forward in
        goal, and generally mess about with the original team selection.
        Now start to play the game, but escape from it as soon as it begins.
        Return to the League/Cup games and View Opposition (Germany).  Your
        opponents team will still be mucked up.  Using this cheat you
        should be able to win every match.

        This cheat will allow you to play the game in slow motion (aka Kick
        Off 2).  What you have to do is play a match and then make a
        substitution.  Then when the player is walking off, press the 'ESC'
        key and you will quit the game.  Start another match and you should
        notice that everything plays at slow speed, even the timer!  To
        return to normal, make another substitution, but let it carry
        through.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    SENSIBLE WORLD OF SOCCER:

        Line up to take a shot on goal.  As soon as you take the shot press
        the 'R' key.  Keep the fire button pressed and when the screen
        returns the players will be frozen and the ball will not be saved.

        To get a free player:

        Go to transfers and offer to buy a teams first striker and
        substitute striker.  Now set the money equal to 0, and offer your
        main striker, all in that order.  Assuming the other club accept the
        bid, you will keep your main striker while acquiring the other teams
        main striker also.  This should work for all players of the same
        position.

        versions.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    *SHADOW OF THE BEAST II:

        At the start of the game, walk to the right until you reach the 
        pigmy.  Press 'A' to get into the question mode and type
        "TEN PINTS".  This will give you infinite energy.

                                ( GAME HINTS)

        Go left to where the bad guy has a guy trapped in a force field.
        Quickly hit him a couple of times to kill him and free the lower
        guy.  He will then tell you the position of a switch (upper or
        lower) for later in the game.  Now go left and down the rope to
        the swamp.  Go left until you get to the building.  Enter the
        building, go left and pick up the jug.  Now go back to where you
        started the game.  From here go right and through the spear
        throwing dudes.  Go up and kill the guy who is throwing the green
        puddle things at you.  Pick up the axe he drops.  Now go left and
        fall from the ledge.  Go right to the rock that is by itself and
        you can see a little grass spot on the ground.  Jump on this like
        4-5 times and it will fall through.  Go down the steps and you are
        in the crystal cavern.  Go left, at the bridge a guy will start
        running left.  Chase him and he will take you to a bridge that is
        being mechanically shortened.  Jump and shoot the dude thats
        cranking the bridge(3 or so shots with the axe).  Now break the
        door at the other side of the bridge with your ball & chain.  Go
        up the first chandelier.  Go left and hit the correct switch.
        Now go down and kill the guards and go right.  Get the key and go
        left, you will get caught and they throw you in jail.  USE THE 'O'
        command and give the jug to the guard.  After he passes out break
        down the door with ball & chain.  Kill the guard.  go up the rope
        (faster than the prisoner) and kill the guard at the upper left
        and then go back down the rope to get the key he dropped.  Now go
        up the rope and go left at the first chance you get.  Use 1 of the
        keys and free the prisoner.  Go to the top of the rope and go left
        and get the ring.  Now if you go right the prisoners get killed.
        Give the ring to the old man who lost it, but he still wants a
        parchment before he will teach you a spell.  The other key is for
        the locked door in the first building (the inn where you got the
        jug).

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    *SHADOW OF THE BEAST III: (Keith Krellwitz)

        On the title screen, type "DADDY DRAW THIS FOR ME" and press
        'RETURN'.  The shurikan should turn to a smiley face with letters
        under it.  During the game use the 'RIGHT CURSOR' key for
        invicibility and the 'LEFT CURSOR' key to go back to normal.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

        3 (if you have another life left).

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    SHOCKWAVE:

        A few hints and tips follow on how each of the four zones (armys,
        factorys, mines and rigs) effect the game:

        MINES - Each time a mine is purchased the income you receive for
                each time pass doubles.

        FACTORYS -  The more factorys you have the faster more weapons
                    are produced, these are essential.

        RIGS -  These supply you with the fuel for each mission run.  The
                more rigs you have the greater the amount of fuel you
                receive for each time pass.

        ARMYS - For every army unit you own, the enemy slows down.  You
                have one army unit, for each four time passes that occur
                the enemy won't move for one time pass.  If more than 50%
                of the sector is occupied by the enemy then you will lose
                one of your assests for each time pass that occurs.  The
                best solution is when 30% of the sector is occupied go an
                attack the enemy.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    *SIDEARMS:

        During play, hit the 'CAPS LOCK' and type "ACID". If this doesn't
        work try "FTBOK".  Now use any of the following keys:
        
                  '1-5'_________________________Weapon select.
                  '6'____________________________Faster speed.  
                  '7'____________________________Slower speed.
                  '8'___________________________________Lives.
                  '9'_______________________________Beta suit.
                  'T'______________________________Game stats.
                  'X AND 0-9'_______________________Set stage.
                  'K'__________________________Kill off enemy.  
                  'D'_________________________Screen dump/die.
                  'C'_______________Clear last enemy of stage.
                  'R'_________________________________Restart.  
                  'H'____________________________________?????
                  'L'_______________________Add 100k to score.
                  'I'____________________________________Menu.
                  'Q'_________________________Quit to desktop.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    SIDEWINDER:

        If you look on disk 2, you will see a screen editor program.  You
        can access a specific level by pressing the appropriate function
        key.  You can save the changes by holding down both mouse buttons.
        You should back up disk 2 first, since the changes are permanent.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    SIERRA SOCCER WORLD CHALLENGE:
    
        If you get to the penalty shoot-out and you are not very good at
        saving goals, then as the opposing team player is running towards
        the penalty spot press 'C', 'F2' and fire.  This should cause a
        white wall to spring up out of the ground in front of him, and his
        shots will either miss the goal or fly straight into your arm.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    *SILKWORM:

        On the options screen, type "SCRAP 28" for infinite lives.  Press
        '0'-'1' on the keypad to select levels.  Use the function keys for
        variable slow motion.

        On early versions press "HELP" and fire together to activate the
        cheat.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    *SILLY PUTTY (System 3):

        See "Putty"....Silly Putty is the budget release of Putty.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    SIMULCRA:
    
        THE MOTHERSHIP: It follows you around generating meanies and can
                        take many hits.  Ram rather than shoot.

        HOMING WEAPONS: Retreat as fast as possible then shot them.  Most
                        homing weapons have a limited range and can be out
                        run.

        BLITZKRIEG:     The best attack is a fast one.  Attack a generator
                        by flying along power barriers at full speed.
                        Learn to recognise the edge barriers.  Barriers you
                        can shut down never merge with the edge, and nearly
                        always lead to a generator.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    SIMCITY:

        When the title screen appears, hold down the 'SHIFT' key and type
        "FUND".  This gives you an extra 10,000 smackers.  It also causes an
        earthquake every tenth time you do it, so do it before you start
        your city.

        Another tip is to set the citizen's taxes to 0%.  Then just before
        tax collection (December or November if playing at fast speed)
        quickly set the taxes up to 20%.  Then after you collect taxes, put
        it back down to 0%.  This way the citizens think they are not
        paying any taxes.

        You can build land on water.  Find a straight (horizontal or
        vertical), stretch of coastline and string a powerline along it.
        Next, move one square over, out into the water and string another
        powerline parallel to the first.  Repeat as many times as you want.
        Then just bulldoze all the excess powerlines and you can build on
        the new land.  To make land you simply make a 3 lane highway across
        any water source.  When you make a road by putting 3 sections of
        road on top of three section of road on top of three sections of
        road (3 by 3) you make 1 section of land in the middle.

    SPACE QUEST III:

        IN THE FREIGHTER:

            Don't fool with the pod that you came in as it is a waste of
            time.

            You will notice an object to the front and right of the door you
            came out.  You cannot move it but you will need it later.

            Head off to the bottom of the screen and then go towards the
            right on the next screen.  You will see a machine bringing scrap
            towards the ceiling.  Hop on and wait.  After it dumps you, type
            "STAND" and then type "JUMP".  You will be on a cross beam.  Go
            towards the left until you reach the control room.  "CLIMB DOWN"
            onto the grabber and go around the control room.  At the screen
            after the control room screen, stop the grabber and push the
            button to lower the claw.  Pick up the warp motivator with the
            claw and after it get back to the grabber go to the right.
            After you go around the turn stop the grabber and lower the
            claw.  You will have to put the warp motivator in the hole in
            the top of the ship.  Ride back to the control room get off the
            grabber and fall down the chute.  

            At the bottom of the chute go to the left where the wire goes
            into the wall and get the reactor.  Climb out using the ladder
            and head towards the top of the screen.  you are now back where
            you started.  Go to the right and go into the tunnel.  As you
            pass thru the tunnel a rat will grab the reactor from you.  Go
            back to the room where you got the reactor and get it again.
            When you climb out again, take the ladder.  Now when you go
            through the tunnel take the wires and continue thru the tunnel.

            Go to the large head and climb in the eye.  Go to the ship and
            use the ladder to get on top and open the hatch and enter the
            ship.  Put the reactor in the hole to the left and then use the
            wires to splice them together.  Get in the cockpit and examine
            controls.  Turn on the engine, turn on the radar, take off, use
            your front shields and blast your way out.

            name).  Land and go to the tourist trap and enter the building.
            Examine the postcards as there are interesting facts you need
            here.  Sell your gem.  Buy thermal underwear and a hat if you
            want it.  As you leave you will meet a baddie who is out to get
            you.  Don't go to your ship!  Instead go to the left of the
            robot and take the elevator up.  When the baddie follows, wait
            till he is near the gears and then grab the pulley.  After he
            becomes burger go down and get his belt.  Leave and go back to
            your ship and go to the volcano planet.  

        VOLCANO PLANET:

            Put on you underwear and go to the left and wait until the
            survey team leaves.  Get a detonator and the pole.  Go in the
            direction that the survey team left and go up the mountain and
            drop the detonator in the machine in the crater.  When you get
            to the crossing back to your ship, use the pole and jump the
            gulley.  Take off and go to pestulon.

        PESTULON:

            Use the belt and get inside past the guards.  Go to the broom
            closet and change into the janitor's closet.  Enter the
            accounting area and use the vaporizer on every trashcan you
            come to.  Make your way to the picture of elmo and take it to
            the copy machine and make a copy.  Put the picture back and
            make your way thru the accounting area to elmos office.  After
            doing elmo's trash, leave and go to the balcony.  When you
            come back, elmo will be gone and get the keycard off of his
            desk.  Make your way back to the corridor and on the security
            door use the keycard and then the picture.  When you see the
            jello mold people, push the ramp button and then vaporize the
            jello.

        THE ROBOT FIGHT:

            Just do your best, no tricks here.

        THE SPACE BATTLE:

            Make sure that you get your front shields up as the fighter
            comes at you and then destroy it when it is behind you.  You
            will have to kill all the fighters as if you miss you will die.

        When you collect the pod that produces four bases, placed at equal
        intervals along the bottom of the screen, don't just leave them
        there. If the invaders are quite low, shoot the bases up the screen
        and into the alien swarms. This way you are guaranteed of killing
        aliens as they die upon contact with bases, rather than allowing the
        space fiends to destroy them before they come down.

    TACTICAL MANAGER:
    
        On the main screen type "CODE", a prompt will appear asking you to
        enter a code.  Enter any of the following codes:
        
            "CODE"_________________A list of cheats will appear.
            "BIDS"__________________Erases all bids from memory.
            "LIMI"___________Disables the 110 team rating limit.
            "BEST"___________________Gives you the best players.
            "FREE"____Enables managers to buy your players free.
            "POOL"__________________Saves European pool to disk.
            "VIEW"_____________________________Programmers tool.
            "PROM"_____Last season's promotions and regulations.
            "MEMO"________________________Show available memory.
                        
        These last couple are activated by typing them in on the main screen
        without typeing "CODE".
                
        "EDIT" to enter the full editor.  Now press 'W' to enable you to
        manage any team.  A small green and yellow strip should appear just
        along from the LOGO and AUTO icon things, under the second logo 
        space.  You can now go to the Manager's menu and JOIN any club.
        Your rating automatically jumps to that of the new team, unless you
        are joining a lesser club.
        
        Finally, if you want to alter teams because of transfers among
        Premiership and Division 1 teams, to maintain more accurate club
        records, instead of creating a whole new player in the editor, it is
        best to make yourself the manager of the club who bought the player,
        enable "FREE" transfers, and transfer the player that way.  This 
        means the player keeps his original ID number.
        
        For example, Paul Furlong was bought by Chelsea from Watford, so to
        enable this change, simply become Chelsea manager, enable "FREE"
        transfers, and approach Watford.

    TARGET RENEGADE:

        lives.

    *TEARAWAY THOMAS: (New cheats by K. Krellwitz)

        At any time, type any of the following: (screen will flash to let
        you know if it worked.)

                "NORMAL"_______________Disables all active cheats.
                "LIFE IS TOO SHORT"____________For infinite lives.
                "IRON MAN THOMAS"_______________For invincibility.
                "ANY LEVEL"___________________Activate stage skip.
                (Down cursor to advance level and up to go back)

        There is a secret level located on level 1.3, and can be found by
        climbing up to the ninth branch of the tree (which is the one with
        the birds on it) and running off the end. You then will be whisked
        off to a room containing some diamonds which can be collected for
        extra points.

        This next cheat didn't work on my version of the game, but I left it
        in just in case it works on other versions.  At any time, type
        "TIMEFLIESLIKEABANANA" for infinite time.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    TEENAGE MUTANT HERO TURTLES:

        When entering the protection routine, type "8859" the first time,
        type "1506" the second time and then enter the correct code.  The
        'HELP' key toggles invincibility on and off.  If you lose a turtle
        press 'HELP' to restore each turtle to full strength, even the dead
        ones.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    *TERMINATOR II:

        Pause the game, then press the function key from 'F1' to 'F10'.
        Press the 'ESC' key to skip levels.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    TERMINATOR II-THE ARCADE VERSION:

        Enter "PMT" for your name on the high acore table.  During play
        pause the game and press 'F10' to skip levels. (Mr Larner)

        When the game has loaded select your control method at the options
        screen as usual.  Instead of going to {Start Game} press 'ESC'.
        Wait for the high score chart with the picture of the T-1000 to
        appear.  As soon as the last digit is printed on the high score
        chart (the last 0 on the 10000, in 10th place), click the left
        mouse button (or the joystick fire button if that's plugged in to
        port one).  Note you must click the button 0.19 seconds after the
        last digit on the high score chart has been printed on the screen.
        If you take longer, or click before the last digit is printed, the
        cheat will not work, so precise timing is required.

        If you find this difficult there is an alternative.  Hold down the
        fire button or left mouse button at the high score table until it
        is finished.  This won't always work though.

        Go back to the options screen.  If you can see the picture of Arnie,
        but no options are displayed, then the cheat worked.  Left click on
        the mouse (or joystick) to move on.  Click again to skip the high
        score display.  If you allow the high score chart to be printed
        again the game may mess up.  Start the game.

        If you didn't get it to work restart the whole procedure.

        Once you've started playing you'll notice that a gunpowder and
        energy reading is displayed for player two even though he isn't
        active.  Now pause the game (press 'P' not 'F1') and type in all
        the function keys in order F1, F2, F3, F4, F5, F6, F7, F8, F9, and
        F10 and you should skip the level you are presently playing.  This
        cheat is for one player only.

    *TERRAMEX:

        See 'COSMIC RELIEF'

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    *TERRY'S BIG ADVENTURE: (Keith Krellwitz)

        On the first level go to the right until you come upon three
        mushrooms in a row (The first mushrooms you will see).  Get the
        first mushroom, jump over the 2nd one and get the 3rd one.  Now
        continue to the right until you reach a section with two special
        weapon power-ups that are next to two mushrooms (right before the
        first bridge and there is a cloud above them).  Stand in front of
        the first power-up and pull down to take it.  Now jump over the
        other power-up and the first mushroom.  Get the 2nd mushroom.  Work
        your way past the bridge until you come to the next tree in the
        background and stand in front of the tree.  Now push the fire
        button and push up on the joystick.  The screen should flash yellow
        letting you know it worked.  Finally press 'C' for invincibility
        and press 'N' to advance levels.
        
        NOTE:   If you die before you activate the cheat you must press
                'RETURN' to abort the game and restart.  Also, you can pick
                up all the mushrooms and power-ups between the sections. 

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    TEST DRIVE:

        To avoid going over the cliff, or crashing into it, hold down the
        fire button.  The car will now glide around corners at a constant
        speed, release the fire button to accelerate/slow down.  Don't
        forget that there are still cars to avoid.

        To get a highscore without playing the game:

        Load a wordprocessor, and load the "highscores" file, and edit it,
        then resave it.  Note that the highscore shouldn't exceed 99,999
        and the name musn't be more than 15 characters.

        To change the car, load the highscores as above, and use any of
        these codes (They must be in lower case):

                        "p911t"------Porsche 911 Turbo.
                        "vette"---------------Corvette.
                        "lotus"-----------Turbo Esprit.
                        "rossa"-----Ferrari Testerossa.
                        "counta"---Lamborgini Countach.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    *TEST DRIVE II:

        During play type any of the following:

        "OUTRAN"_____________This will put you ahead of the other cars.
        "AERF"_________________________________Gives you an extra life.
        "GASS"______________________This brings you to the gas station.
        "BRUCE"_________________________Changes the sign on level two.
        "GASST"______________Jump to the gas station with average time.

    THEME PARK:

        Insert disk 3 to load the game without the intro sequence, as the
        screen goes blank press 'C' a few times.  Once the game has loaded,
        select a new game, then when you get to the map screen you should 
        notice that your player's name has changed to "It's You, Buddy".
        Now when the game starts, you will have plenty of cash in your bank
        account.

        Enter "FLIGHT SIM" for the name of the park and you will start the
        game with 200K instead of the usuall 130K.

        Enter "DEMO" for the name of the park for a ready made one.

        Position a bouncy castle anywhere in the park (positioning the
        entrance and exit any where).  Now pause the game until you notice
        the writing above the entrance speed up, and type 'L', (pause),
        'I', (pause), 'V', (pause), 'E', (pause), 'C', (pause), 'A',
        (pause), 'S', (pause), 'H', (pause), 'P', and 'P'.  You should now
        get a new shop and ride every year.

        To get the baddest roller coaster without having to pay for it, 
        place your roller coaster doorway where you want and build the
        smallest loop you can around it using the least number of sections
        possible.  Open it up and close it down immediately (to only be
        charged for the tiny ride).  Now remove the tiny loop and build
        your dream coaster without paying a dime.

    ULTIMA 6:

        This is a cheat for Ultima 6 that will let you get any item you
        wish.  What you do is talk to IOLO and say "spam" "spam" "spam"
        and "humbug" and it will put up a secret cheaters menu.

        Here is a list of some items:

            090 torch
            093 sexant
            097 gargoyal vocabulary
            107 shovel

        The following are runes:

            0242 honesty
            0243 compassion
            0244 valor
            0245 justice
            0246 sacrifice
            0247 honor
            0248 spirtituality
            0249 humility
            1417 britianna lens
            1419 garg. lens

        For those of you that haven't found the magic method of travel in
        Ultima 6, holding 'ALT' '2' '1' '4' will bring up a prompt (in
        Gargoylian) for three coordinates - these three hex numbers will
        bring you to any location in Britannia, the dungeons or the Gargoyle
        world.  This is apparently the programmers method of travel and is
        faster than a fan powered Balloon!

        The three numbers are basicly the x,y & z coordinates for the map,
        with 0,0,0 located at the upper left corner on Level 0 (Britannia).
        For this discussion, I will use the form x,y,l to describe this
        coordinate system.  The first two numbers (x & y) increase by 1 for
        each move in the horizontal or vertical direction.  The x
        coordinates begin at the left edge and the y coordinates begin at
        the top. The third coordinate (l) represents the level; Britannia
        is Level 0, the dungeons are levels 1 thru 4 and the Gargoyle world
        is Level 5.
    
        'ALT' '2' '1' '4' is entered on the numeric keypad.  Each coordinate
        is entered separately, ie, press 'RETURN' after each one.

        'ALT' '2' '1' '3' this gives the Gargoyle coordinate for your 
        present position plus a free view of the map - forget all those gems
        and peer spells!

        'ALT' '2' '1' '3' returns a 13 digit number, the last 7 of which are
        the coordinates.  The first 6 are related to the total number of
        moves you have made.  For the example above, the number would look
        something like:  79000029D0430 or 790000 moves and coordinate
        29D,043,0.

        BEWARE: You can land in a real 'snake pit' with some of these
        locations.  Always be prepared for the worst when teleporting to a
        strange location.

        daylight.

        you.  When Solbase says to take him anywhere, go to CH010 and he
        will get sucked into a black hole.

        it's printed.  Orca doesn't need school.  To access a menu option
        (much of which is no longer useful or active) create a new pilot
        and name him "  Who is The Riddler".  Make sure to put the two
        spaces before the name.  Don't use the 'RETURN' key to enter it,
        hit the 'ESC' key instead.  Now follow the prompts.

                'P'__________________________Add one life (Max 9).
                'C'________________________________Changes weapon.

        equipped with Kickstart version 2 or higher (but if you use the
        Kickstart v1.3 emulator it works fine).

    WIZKID:

        Go to the shop with all five stars and over a hundred pounds, and
        buy another star.  You'll get an extra hundred pounds.  You can
        achieve the same by getting the balloon back to the shop and buying
        another balloon.  This can be done as many times as you want.

        A secret room on the first section will warp you to any level in
        the game.  Simply buy the token from the shop and exit as the body.
        Now go down the well and enter the Gents toilets.  Use the token on
        the bubble gum machine and you'll fly up to a secret room with
        another Gents toilet door and an exit.  Go through the Gents, then
        you'll appear in a room with a Ladies and Gents door.  Go over to
        the right and enter an invisible door (Go to the far right and it
        should be found there).  Now go through the Gents to the following
        patterns to enter the desired section of the game.

        The directions for the various choices are given below.  If you
        choose the wrong door or wish to return to theis screen, go through
        the invisible door on the right.

    *WOLFCHILD:

        On the title screen type "THE PERFECT KISS" for infinite special
        weapon while your the wolfman.

        On the option screen type "SOULPSYCHEDELICIDE" for a full active
        life meter.

        During play type "ITS NOT ALL WALKING" and when your game ends a new
        option will be waiting for you on the options screen.  This new
        option will let you start at the last level you were on.  No good if
        you didn't get past the 1st level.

        NOTE: You may only have one of the above activated at a time.  I
        suggest you use one of the 1st two and when your on you last life
        and close to death type the 3rd one.  Now go to the option sceen and
        type the second one.  This will allow you to continue at the last
        level completed and give you a full active life meter.  Repeat if
        needed.

    *WONDERDOG:

        When you find a hidden bonus room during play use the cursor keys
        to move around (up and down are reversed).  If you scroll the screen
        all the way to the right and let wonderdog go off the right side, he
        will appear back in the main game, but will start walking to the
        right and the level will end.

        without having any of the levels completed.  These codes may not
        work on all versions, as there are different versions of the game.

    *WORMS (Team17): ANDY "WORMS" DAVIDSON

        On the title screen, Type in "TOTAL WORMAGE" for SHEEP MODE.  If
        you are using a joypad press GREEN, UP, PAUSE, PAUSE, YELLOW
        (which spells GUPPY - a tribute to the late Bananafish).  This gives
        you 3 sheep, 1 banana bomb and a minigun straight away (go into
        Weapon Options if you need an UNLIMITED SUPPLY of sheep)

                                ---------------

        The "legendary prod move" is a not available in any shops.  To
        activate get next to your victim and press AWAY, AWAY, TOWARDS, 
        TOWARDS (in other words, if your worm is facing right press left,
        left, right, right)

                                ---------------

        The custom level option is EVEN MORE EXCITING than you thought.  You
        can set the gravity, friction, sky and water colours for your levels.
        Instead of saving your level as FISHCAKE.WRM, save it as
        FISHCAKE.????.WRM (the 4 question marks being 4 numbers).

        The first number is gravity and can be between 1 and 5 (1=very low,
        3=normal 5=very high).  Mars and alien levels have a gravity of 2.

        The second number is friction and can be between 1 and 5 (1=very low,
        3=normal, 5=very high). Arctic and alien levels have a friction of 2.

        The third and forth numbers are the sky and water colours and can be
        between and 9 - fans of green water can now have a matching green
        sky.

        You can also make your own message appear, when your level is chosen,
        by giving your level file a comment.  Do this by clicking on the
        level icon and choosing "Information" from the Workbench menus.

                                ---------------

                                (Strange levels)

    WWF EUROPEAN RAMPAGE:

        During play, press 'F10' ten times to freeze your opponents.  Don't
        knock them down or you won't be able to pick them back up.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    WWF (Ocean): (Cheat by Keith Krellwitz)

        During play, use the numeric keypad and type "14785963".  Now press
        'RETURN' to skip levels.

        Get your man outside the ring and pick up the steel chair to beat up
        any harder Fighters that you are having trouble with.  This should
        help you to get further.  When you are about to go into a joystick
        waggling battle, follow these steps:

            (A) Pause the game.

            (B) Plug the mouse into the joystick port you are using.

            (C) Unpause the game, and move the mouse rapidly from side to
                side.  This will enable you to waggle quicker than your
                opponent.
            (D) When your character has won the move, pause the game and
                plug the joystick back in.

        Place the chair outside the ring (next to the bottom left turn
        buckle) just up a bit. Now jump into the ring and you should have
        the chair.  Climb up on to a corner post, and instead of jumping
        into the ring, jump the other way.  Weird gravity!

        During a two player practice game, get 1 player to climb onto the
        top of the top left turnbuckle, then get player two to be as close
        as possible to him.  Player two should drop and kick the player,
        then he will turn into a "ghost". He can pick up the chair and
        take it into the ring.  Press escape then compete for the title,
        and the chair will still be there.

    *XENON:

        Let yourself be killed off at level 2, Stage 2 and all the aliens in
        the round will be destroyed.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    XENON II:
    
        Pause the game and type "RUSSIAN AIR", then unpause the game.  Press
        'N' to skip levels.  This doesn't work on all versions.

                         *** Halfway and End Monsters ***

        SNAIL:  Shoot at eye, avoid mines.

        ALIEN:  Shoot eyes at either side at top.  Scroll back and shoot
                center eye.

        SPIDER: Destroy as much web as possible.  Fly down to face spider
                and fire continuously.

        CRAYFISH:   Travels in figure eight.  Stay below and fire in it's
                    face.
                    
        SNAKE:  Attacks from left of screen.

        DRAGON: Shoot the side heads first, then tail, then main head.

                Shoot at head when tongue goes in.

        TANK:   Use missles

        GRAND SPACESHIP: Shoot all cannons until totally destroyed.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    *Xtreme Racing:

        On the 1st selection screen type any of the following:

            "SHEEPY SHEEPY"________________For a sheep as a vehicle.
            "TURBO NUTTER BASTARD"_______________________________????
            "IDKFA"_________________________________For auto qualify.
                (and access to 3 bonus track in single track mode)

        HINTS:

        Grassland 1 has a short cut - where you have the blocks in the
        middle of the road.  Go just past there and you can drive through a
        tree.


     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    *XYBOTS:

        On the high score table, enter "ALF".  Now when you start to play
        the next game you will have infinite lives and near invincibility.
        
        If you manage to reach level 10, you're better off using your radar
        to kill the xybots.  Just line them up using radar and fire, you
        don't have to be able to see them.  Keep as many keys with you as
        possible because some levels don't have enough to complete them.

        There are short cuts to level seven on levels one and four - you
        get extra cash for using them.  If you have the extra energy upgrade
        try not to let your energy fall below 100m, because you lose the
        upgrade if it does.

        Drums are not just decorations - hide behind them when possible and
        use your zapper near to them to find more cannon power.

        On level eight, near to the top left hand transporter you can get to
        two white coins by blasting away one of the three walls around them.

        Don't split up in the two-player game, because it's easier to
        complete it together.

        The master xybot lives on level 11, and you'll need to stock up on
        double shot and extra shot speed to stand a chance of survival.

        Try to get one xybot to stand behind another - they'll blow each
        other apart.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    *X-IT: (Cheat by K. Krellwitz)

        During play, type "MOOMIN.TROLL" and press any key.  The border will
        flash to let you know it worked.  This will give you 100 lives.  Now
        use the following keys:
        
                    'L'_________To skip the current stage.
                    'S'_________To skip to the next level.

    X-OUT:

        On the equipment screen select the white bug ship and put it on the
        grid area.  Then choose the orange laser and drag it to the face of
        the shop keeper.  Keep clicking the LEFT MOUSE BUTTON until you get
        $500,000.

        Insert the disk, and hold both mousebuttons until the title screen
        appears.  When youre in the shop hold down 'HELP' and 'DEL' for a
        few seconds, now choose your ships as normal, but you have infinite
        energy.

        To get more cash at the beginning of the game, select the smallest
        ship (the one at the top), then the weediest laser (the orange one
        with single beam), and place it on the shopkeepers nose.  Hit the
        fire button to get the cash boost!

    *YOGI BEAR'S BIG CLEAN UP (HiTec): (K. Krellwitz)

        On the screen right after the title screen, the one with the
        animation, type "LETS LOOK AT WHAT YOU COULD HAVE WON".  Then type
        "SUPER SMASHING GREAT".  Now press 'P' to unpause the game and press
        the joystick button to start the game.  This will give you infinite
        energy and will enable the following keys:

        as of yet.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    *YOLLANDA: (Keith Krellwitz)

        On the high score screen, type "SKID ROW".  I'm not sure this does
        anything other than put {18 and life} as your name on the high score
        table.
        
        At any time, type "QUIDITY" and use the following keys:

                    'F4'________________________NTSC video mode.
                    'F5'_________________________PAL video mode.

        If the game ends or you reset the game by pressing 'F1' you will
        have to enter the code again.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    YOSEMITE SAM:

        Enter your name as "BUGS".  This gives infinite energy, press 'F1'
        to go to a sprite editor (there are some already on the disk).

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    ZANY GOLF:

        To get to the secret level, make it to the last level and look for
        the mouse hole.  When the two eyes flash knock the ball is and off
        you go to the secret level.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

                    "TRYBUS SPECJALUS"_______________Not sure.

        If you type the last one in and the screen turns to garbage press
        'RETURN' to get the screen back and use the function keys while the
        screen is screwed up to alter the screen (sort of like the 'm' and
        'n' keys of the Action Replay freezer).

    ZOMBI (UBI SOFT):

        If you have seen Dawn of the Dead, you already have a good idea on
        how to solve most of the puzzles.  But here's some extra tips
        anyway:

        1.  To lock up the mall to keep zombies from getting in, you need to
            park the trucks over the entrances.  Get the key from the office
            on the 2nd floor and go to the 4th floor where the keys to the
            trucks are kept.

        2.  To keep the dead zombies from coming to un-life, lock them up in
            the freezer in the basement.

        3.  Before you can go play in the basement, you need a source of
            light.  Get the fuses and gloves from the 3rd floor and go to
            it!

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    *ZOOL (500 or AGA):

        When the screen says push fire to start, type "GOLDFISH".  Now use

                '1'_________________________Will make zool invincible.
                '2'_______________________Advance to the next section.
                '3'________________________________Skip to next level.
                '4'_____________________________Removes invincibility.

        Try any of the following for various messages:  "ADE", "TONY", 
        "GEORGE", "GREGGS", "PAT", "SIZ", "SYD", "CASSON", "SHORTIE",
        "MICK", "PAUL", "RITCHIE", "ASH", "MARK", "BERNI", AND "HILEY".
