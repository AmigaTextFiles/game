======================================================================
DGTrainer is a trainer to the game DeLuxeGalaga by Edgar M Vigdal.
It operates by patching the prices in the shop, so that all items
are free. You still need at least 50 credits to enter the shop.
Instructions are in the trainer just type dgtrainer ? from shell.
 
The trainer works in that way that it patches the memory, not the
binary file, so that uf you reset, you have to run the trainer 
again next time you use the game.
It works in a very safe way, and searches for a memory string 16 words
long, so it is very unlikely that it will patch wrong memory.
If the trainer does not find a correct memory string, it will report
that.

DGTrainer is written in assembler.
