     Upon cracking this sucker I encountered a problem while trying to exit
     through the steel door of the fortress. If you try to exit without
     wearing your rubber gloves the screen will show a few glitches, then there
     will be a disk access where then the title screen reappears. Then
     another disk access where it loads for a while then grey and red
     garbage covers the screen and the game is ruined.

     However after hours and hours and hours of myself and a few others
     play testing it, we found that if you don't go directly through the
     door but touch it near the side, Rambo will let out a scream, and a
     message will appear saying you've been executed, which makes sense,
     because we were not wearing our gloves. So after much time roaming every
     possible inch of the playfield, we've encountered a yellow/red/gray
     plaque on the wall in a far room from the start. And said Hmmmmm
     I wonder if these are the gloves they make hint of, and sure enough
     when we went back to the steel door and walked into it, we passed to the
     next level. So I cannot imagine what could be wrong, but I would guess
     that our original is either fucked or Taito has a bug overlooked by
     their beta testers. We decided long and hard whether to release this
     the way it is, and decided to along with this note, If I am wrong though
     and it is not a bug, we apologize! We will check out another original
     tomorrow and leave word on our findings. The game seems 100% otherwise
     and is very awesome and addictive.

     Remember to just wear your gloves before touching the high voltage door.
