From the clipboard menu(where the pencil is), select a visiting team by 
moving the pencil to the team and press the joystick button. In One Player
and Teammates(which is 2 humans against the computer), the first team
you choose is you! If you choose League option, you can edit any player
of the 28 teams. All you have to do is select NEW SEASON and choose
EDIT TEAM.

NOTE: WHEN YOU BEGIN A NEW SEASON YOU ERASE ANY EXISTING SEASONS ON
THAT DISK!!!!!!

You can give players different Rankings or "talent points". The best 
player get 24 and so on...The points are divided umong SPEED, STRENGTH, 
HANDS, and AGILITY.

CALLING PLAYS
When your ready to call a play, refer to the joystick icons. Simply move
the joystick diagonally toward the formation you want. When you have
done that, the PLAYS are displayed, again move your joystick diagonally 
to choose the PLAY you wish. If you don't call a play in 15 secs, the
computer will call one for you. NOTE: YOU CAN DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF
PLAYS BY REVERSING THEM. TO DO THIS, HOLD DOWN THE FIREBUTTON WHILE
CALLING YOUR PLAY. THE PITCH LEFT NOW BECOMES A PITCH RIGHT, AND SO ON.

To call timeout, push the firebutton before a formation is called.

OFFENSE
To send a man in motion, simply move the joystick left or right before 
play begins. There are 2 ways to hike the ball: pushing the button, or pulling
back on the stick. Pushing the button means you want to follow the diagrammed
play and make a handoff. You CANNOT pass the ball if you push the button
to hike!!! As soon as the running back has the ball, he will begin to
run automactically. To make handoffs from the shotgun position, hole the
button down for at least 3 secs..

Pull back on the stick if you want to pass. You can drop back or roll
left or right to pass. To throw, "point" the quarterback in the direction
you want to throw the ball, and HOLD the joystick button. A green "x" 
and show you where the ball will land and marks the middle of the 
"catchable range". As long as you hold the button, the x will continue
to move. At the moment you release the button, the nearest receiver will
run towards it, and the ball will be halfway between it and the 
quarterback. Make sure you lead your receivers.

CATCHING THE BALL
The closer the player is to the x when the ball comes down, the better
the chance he has to catch it. Watch out for INTERCEPTIONS!!!

PUNTING
To punt, press the fire button or pull the stick back. Move the joystick 
left or right to point in the direction you want to kick it. Then hold
the firebutton down to kick it. For a long kick, try to release the button
just as the ball leaves the punters hand.

KICKING FIELD GOALS
There are 2 ways, by computer or you can do it. To let the computer try
hike the ball by pushing the firebutton. For you to do it, pull back on
the stick. There is a box in the lower right hand corner. Use this to guide
to WHERE on the football you want to kick it. As soon as the ball is hiked, a
red line will begin to move from bottom to top. While it is moving, slide
the blue line in. Before the red line goes half way point on the ball, push
the button to stop it. The spot where the lines meet, is where it will be
kicked.

DEFENSE
The defensive player can be changed by clicking the button before the snap.
To make a player BLITZ, choose a player and hold the button down and pull
DOWN on the stick.
