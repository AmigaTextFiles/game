             KEYS
     LEFT     O
     RIGHT    P
     UP       Q
     DOWN     A
     FIRE    <ALT>

     To throw a grenade, face in the right direction and hold down the fire
     button until the grenade is thrown.

     HINTS & TIPS:

     The Jeep & Tank armour you against the enemies bullets, but not
     grenades.
     Smart bombs destroy everything in the immediate area.
     Rapid fire gives you autofire.

     Pick up any ammo you find, it'll top up your grenade supply.

     PS. If you know someone with an original SAS disk, you can copy it
     with xcopy2, the title screen becomes corrupt, but the game is fine.
