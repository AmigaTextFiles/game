Chapter 1  INTRODUCTION
Welcome to the world of the F-16 combat pilot. You are about to join an
elite group of pilots envied by fighter crews the world over. The F-16
Fighting Falcon is a truly remarkable aircraft, designed originally as
a highly manoeuverable dogfighter and subsequently developed into an
awesome multi-role combat aircraft. Every thrilling aspect of the F-16C
has been included in this simulation, including many features only just
becomming available to the front line squadrons.

F-16 Combat Pilot is the first in a new generation of "strategic"
flight simulations. In this single product you will fly on a variety of
training missions, join an active front line squadron responsible for
each role of the F-16 and ultimately participate in a strategic global
conflict involving real-time interaction between aircraft, ground
forces and the supporting infrastructure of military installations and
essential services. Throughout your flying career your successes (and
failures!) will be monitored and logged by Tactical Air Command (TAC)
who are well aware of every pilot's amgition to fly with the supreme
squadron.

OVERVIEW
 Your experience as an F-16 pilot begins in the first of eight
squadrons. During your training you will become familiar with the
performance and complexities of your new fighting machine.Instructors
will be on hand to offer a few words of advice and also to give you a
taste of things to come.
 Active duty in a front  line squadron will be a very different ball
game. The targets are real, the enemy is real. Planning your mission is
essential if you want to get back in one piece. Still, you have the
best aircraft available, and a ground crew second to none....

MISSION TYPES:
  *  TRAINING - mission practice & aircraft familiarisation
  *  SCRAMBLE - air - to -air interception
  *  HAMMERBLOW - offensive counterair operations
  *  DEEPSTRIKE - interdictor strike
  *  TANKBUSTER - battlefield close air support
  *  WATCHTOWER - reconnaissance
  *  GLADIATOR - two-player dogfight
  *  OPERATION CONQUEST - strategic option
 Each squadron is responsible for controlling its airspace of roughly
20.000 sq. miles. For security reasons, the name and location of each
squadron is TOP SECRET. After being posted to a new squadron, be ready
to familiarise yourself with your new surroundings during the
pre-flight briefing - it could save your life!

With the exception of OPERATION CONQUEST, each mission will consist of
completing the objective assigned during the pre-flight briefing
intelligence sources suggest well in excess of 1500 potential targets,
both fixed and mobile, within each combat zone. For example, your task
may be to destroy an early warning radar on an offensive counterair
operation or a particular area may need "photographing" on a
reconnaissance mission. In each case,you will be expected to fulfill
your objectives within a single flight.

For OPERATION CONQUEST however, you will need experience of all roles
of the combat pilot. For this multi-mission scenario, the overall
objective is to force the enemy to surrender by reducing his fighting
ability and morale. You will experience the passing of day and night,
variable weather conditions, the damage of strategic installations, and
the deployment of tanks and mobile ground forces. The duration of this
operation canvary significantly. To avoid pilot fatigue you will be
allowed to request leave, and return whenyou are in peak fitness.

All Tactical Fighter Squadrons and allied groups forces depend upon
industry for supplies of weapons, spares and fuel. The enemy is
expected to interrupt these supplies by attacking strategic targets
such as power stations, fuel depots and factories. Fortunately, early
warning radar installations are monitoring your airspace 24 hours a
day. Coordination of all military operations lies with the Command,
Control and Communications (C-cubed) centres and military bases.
Anticipating the next strike and making the best tactical decisions is
your job. HQ intelligence will do their best to keep you up to date....

Chapter 2 ARRIVING AT BASE
 Your day begins in the squadron crewroom. Before getting airborne,
let's take a look around. Select any item by simply pointing to the
appropriate object.

QUICKSTART - (Pilot)
 For all you fighter jocks keen to get off the ground without doing any
homework! Not recommended for the serious pilot but it will give you a
taste of things to come. The default conditions are descriped earlier.

PILOT'S LOG (Filing Cabinet)
 This is your personal record containing all details of your experience
as an F-16 pilot. Select your log by opening the cabinet and giving
your name. A new log will be created automatically if the name given is
not on file.

  *  NAME - enter your name, up to 8 characters.
  *  CALLSIGN - enter your callsign, up to 10 characters. This will be
     used during air-toground communications.
  *  SQUADRON - You will begin your flying career in the Wildcatters
     squadron. Each time you  succeed in Operation Conquest you will be
     offered a transfer to a new outfit.
  *  FLYING HOURS - total number of hours flown by this pilot.
  *  KILL RECORD - total number of enemy aircraft destroyed - total
     number of ground targets destroyed, Mission Effectiveness ratio
     (over all missions), Kill Ratio (over all missions). pilot rating.

Mission Effectiveness (ME) ratio =
no. of assigned targets destroyed / total no. of assigned targets

Kill Ratio (KR) =
total number of targets destroyed / number of weapons used

 Pilot rating is determined by your ME ratio n.b. During your
debriefing you will be given ME and KR ratios for the particular
mission. These should not be confused with your overall ratios recorded
in your log.
  *  AIRCRAFT LOST - total number of aircraft that you have failed to
     bring back in one piece.
  *  OPERATION CONQUEST - hours in command- victories- losses.
  *  ERASE - use ERASE if you no longer wish to keep a particular log.

FLIGHT CONTROLS  (Desktop Computer)
 Your aircraft may be flown by usingonly the keyboard but you are
strongly advised to use a joystick or mouse in order to create a sense
of "feel" in the controls.

DEMONSTRATION MODE  (Window)
 For a dramatic flying display, take a look out of the window!

AIRCRAFT TECHNICAL DATA  (Aircraft Poster)
 Additional technical data on your aircraft and all likely adversaries
is available for further study, Knowing your enemy's capabilities is
essential if you are to succeed in air combat.

WEAPON TECNICAL DATA  (Weapon Poster)
 Additional technical data on all weapon systems is available for
further study. Familiarise yourself with each weapon systems is
available for further study. Familiarise yourself with each weapon,
when and how to use it. These are the "tools of your trade".

OPERATION CONQUEST - RESTORE (Pilot's Flight Case)
 On returning from R & R select this option to continue the campaign.

MISSION SELECTION (Door)
 Move onto mission selection by leaving the crewroom (via the door!).
On leaving the crewroom you will arrive at mission selection.

MISSION SELECTION
 The five sides of the U S Pentagon represent each role of the F-16:
   * SCRAMBLE - Air-to-air interception
   * HAMMERBLOW - offensive counterair operations
   * DEEPSTRIKE - interdictor strike
   * TANKBUSTER - battlefield close air support
   * WATCHTOWER - reconnaissance
 The centre icon, used for selecting OPERATION CONQUEST, will not
appear until you have satisfied Tactical Air Command that you are
capable of commanding your squadron on Operation Conquest. For this
you must fly a successful mission on each of the above categories, on
front line duty, at least once.

 In the top left hand corner you will see a two-seat F-16D. Use this to
select a temporary posting to the Tactical Fighter Training Squadron.

 In the top right hand corner is the icon used to select two-player
mode. Selecting this will lead you to the Communications set-up screen
and GLADIATOR, the one-on-one dogfight.

Chapter 3 TRAINING SQUADRON
 Welcome to the Tactical Training Squadron. Your documentation includes
a map of our training area to help you plan your missions during your
stay. For those of you not familiar with the F-16 we suggest our Free
Flight or Landing Practice course. Mission-oriented training is
available for more experienced pilots, covering all aspects of front
line duty.

 If you are familiar with the pre-flight briefing and F-16 cockpit, I
suggest you skip the next lecture and get airborne as soon as possible.

PRE-FLIGHT BRIEFING.
 OK guys. Notebooks at the ready. Your attention please....

 Our electronic strategic display is identical to those used by the
front line squadrons, showing your current position, all airfield
locations, towns and major geographical features. Make sure that you
are familiar with the layout - it could save your life!

 Along the front of your display are the mode selector switches:
  *  MISSION objectives
  *  TARGETS target selector
  *  REPORT intelligence update
  *  WEATHER met report
  *  WAYPOINT programmer
  *  COMMAND aircraft assignment

 These allow you to access various computerised functions that you will
need for planning your mision profile. How we ever managed in the old
days I'll never know! Select the appropriate key to change the mode of
the text area beneath the strategic display:

 MISSION key.
 With the exception of OPERATION CONQUEST, you will have selected your
mission category prior to this meeting. TAC will now release details of
your objectives. This information is CONFIDENTIAL and is for "your eyes
only".

example: MISSION: HAMMERBLOW CALLSIGN: HOTDOG
  *  TARGET (A) EARLY WARNING RADER @ 014,283
  *  TARGET (B) SAM SITE @ 059,268
  *  TARGET (C) SAM SITE @ 051,259

 TARGETS key
 The display defaults to showing only airfield locations and major non-
strategic geographical features. Pressing the "TARGETS" switch will
illuminate several target selector keys within the text area. The
categories are as follows:
  *  Tank battalions
  *  Military bases
  *  Command centres
  *  Early warning raders
  *  SAM sites
  *  Power stations
  *  Factories
  *  Fuel depots

 Press the appropriate key to highlight (or remove) the desired target
category. In the case of mobile targets, the best we can do is to give
you their last known positions reported by TAC reconnaissance flights.

   REPORT key
 Operators at the Command Centre have been piecing together the latest
whispers and hard facts togive you their best advice for your flight.
For the latest update, select "REPORT".

 Example:
  *  Interceptor activity high
  *  Enemy tank battalions @ 487,926
  *  Allied factories - heavy losses

   WEATHER key
 For a brief summary from the met office, select "WEATHER".

 Example:
  *  Cloudbase 25000 ft
  *  Light SW crosswinds
  *  Mild turbulence
 These conditions may well change during your flight but we can't help
that can we?

   WAYPOINT key
 So, down to the important task of flight planning. As an F-16 pilot
you will not have the luxury of a navigator in the back seat but
fortunately you do have the latest programable navigation computer to
give you in-flight guidance via your Up Front Control Panel.
 A flight plan may vary from a simple direct route from A to B, to a
complex multi-target hi-lo-hi profile over enemy territory. After
selecting the waypoint mode, your present position will be highlighted
on the strategic display. To set a waypoint, simply move the pointer to
the required coordinates and press the "select" key. You iwll now see
your proposed flight route automatically plotted. Further waypoints may
be introduced, up to a maximum of five, each addition extending the
flight plan.

  To cancel a waypoint, place the pointer over the point to be erased and
press the "cancel" key. Your flight route will be replotted
accordingly. Select the "Waypoint Programmer" box to highlight your
flight route in other display modes. Finally, a "clear all waypoints"
option is available.
During flight you may select range, bearing and time-to-go information
for each waypoint on your Up Front Control Panel.

COMMAND key   (Operation Conquest only)
 As squadron commander, you may now instruct additional aircraft to
execute missions in parallel to your own. Selecting the COMMAND mode
will reveal the number of servicable aircraft available at each allied
airfield. To despatch an aircraft, first contact the airfield.
Providing that an aircraft is available you may now assign target
coordinates for its mission by positioning the display pointer at the
desired target location and pressing the "select" key. 

The aircraft's flight route will be plotted as visual confirmation. To
cancel an assignment, place the pointer back in the text area at the
appropriate airfield symbol and press the "cancel" key. You may assign
one aircraft per airfield. up to a maximum of four at any given time,
bearing in mind that an aircraft cannot be given new instructions when
its airborne.

 FUNCTION KEYS
 Before take-off you will want to consider your weapon configuration 
and weather conditions. On the right hand side of the display you will
see the following:

 MET OFFICE function key
 With the exception of OPERATION CONQUEST, TAC will allow you to take
off in the weather conditions of your choice. The met office will do
their best to comply with your wishes! However, they cannot guarantee
that conditions will remain stable throughout your flight.

 WEAPON function key
 OK, it's time to take a stroll across to the hangar and meet the
ground crew. They have already refuelled your aircraft, rearmed the
internal gun, and completed the sub-system ground checks.

Your F-16 has 9 external hardpoints capable of carrying a vast
selection of weapons, including the latest laser guided "smart"
missiles, and the  new AMRAAM "beyond visual range" air-to-air missile.
In addition to this we have been cleared to use the first production
LANTIRN nightvision and target acquisition pods, attached at specific
locations either side of the engine intake. These pods will
revolutionise our night attack capability.

WEAPON SELECTION.
 Having decided upon your weapon configuration, check the stock records
for awailability. Weapons are loaded in pairs by indicating to the
ground crew the chosen hardpoint for the weapon. Please bear in mind
the loading restrictions explained to you at Ground School - they will
not take you seriously if you suggest putting 2000 lb bombs on the wing
tips! Keep an eye on your All Up Weight. Although it is not possible to
exceed the specified maximum, remember that with increasing weight you
become less manoeuverable. In fact, your F-16 will automatically reduce
its maximum g capability if you exceed the 9 g stress loads. Also shown
on your load report are your fuel state and ammunition level. You may
resort to reducing these if your A.U.W. gets uncomfortably high.
Weapons may be loaded and unloaded as often as you wish using "select"
and "cancel".

 For your convenience, the stores officer will keep a record of up to
three "preferred configurations" of your choice in order to speed up
turn-around-time between missions. Your ground crew willalso be glad to
suggest a weapon mix approriate to your mission.

 TAKE OFF function key
 OK, you know your targets. Time to get airborne. Don't forget your
last minute visual checks to make sure that all safety pins and covers
are removed. Request permission for take-off, and be prepared to
respond with your security clearance. Have a nice flight......

                                "You fight like you train"
                - Motto, U.S. Navy Fighter Weapons School TOPGUN

 For those of you not familiar with the F-16C, it's time to strap into
the reclining ACES II ejection seat and take a look at "the office".

 MULTI-FUNCTION DISPLAYS  (Sperry) 
 Following the trend in all modern aircraft towards the "glass
cockpit", the instrument panel has been modified and updated many times
since its first design. You are now looking at the very latest version,
including the 3 multi-function digital displays introduced as part of
the MSIP avionics update programme. This layout was first evaluated in
the AFTI F-16 technology demonstrator.
The major advantage of MFD displays is flexibility. You, the pilot,
decide which to use for radar, weapons status, moving map etc. All
functions are available on each display, giving you the choice of what
to display and in the position you prefer. Refer to your kneepad for
mode selection.

AN/APG-68(V) Multi-mode Radar (Westinghouse)
 For the purpose of our flight, we will concentrate on the short range
modes available on this state-of-the-art radar.

 (a)AIR-TO-AIR MODES:

 (i)TRACK-WHILE-SCAN (TWS) MODE
 Effective range approx. 30nm. Used for air-to-air search for hostile
aircraft. The display represents a cross-sectional view of the pilot's
field of vision, pointing in the direction of the noise of the
aircraft.
Ther radar will display all aircraft within its field of view and is
capable of tracking up to ten targets simultaneously. Using the "target
select" key, you may track any displayed target, with range (top LH
corner, miles), altitude (top RH corner,  000's feet), and bearing
information (bottom RH corner) calculated by your weapons computer.

 (ii)SINGLE-TARGET-TRACK (STT) MODE
 Pressing the "designate" key will switch the radar to "single target
track" mode (STT). The selected target will now be displayed as a
diamond, with all others removed from the screen. You will also see the
target designator box appear on the HUD, showing the position of your
target relative to your aircraft together with the LOCK discrete.
Return to track-while-scan mode by either pressing the "designate" key
again or destroying the target. n.b. If your designated target leaves
the radar's field of view, the display will return to TWS mode.

 (iii)AIR COMBAT SCAN (ASC) MODE
 Using the "dogfight" selector on your throttle control will put your
radar in "air combat" mode. Target symbology is the same as STT mode
(single diamond) but your weapons computer will automatically lock onto
the target of "greatest threat", excluding allied aircraft of course.
Effective range approximately 10nm. Return to track-while-scan mode by
pressing the "designate" key.
Superimposed on all modes you will see the roll orientation bar to
assist you when looking down into the cockpit.

 (b)AIR-TO-GROUND MODES:
 Not to be confused with your GPS moving map display, the radar air-to-
ground mode is used for ground target tracking.

 (i)GROUND-TARGET-RANGING (GTR) MODE
 Equivalent to the air-to-air mode "track-while-scan". The display is
now a forward-looking plan view showing fixed installations and mobile
ground targets, differentiated by symbology. Using the "target select"
key, you may track any displayed target, with range and bearing
information shown on the HUD and MFD. Effective range 10nm.

 (ii)GROUND-TARGET-TRACK (GTT) MODE
Pressing the "designate" key will switch the radar to "ground target
track" mode (GTT). The chosen target will now be displayed as a
diamond, with all others removed from the screen. You will also see the
target designator box appear on the HUD, showing the position of the
target relative to your aircraft together with the LOCK discrete.
Return to GTR mode by either pressing the "designate" key again or
destroyed the target. The display will automatically return to GTR mode
if the designated target leaves the radar's field of view.

 MOVING MAP DISPLAY
 Linked to the tri-service Global Positioning System, this display uses
your inertial navigation computer and various external "classified"
sources to pinpoint your exact position within the combat zone. The
symbolic digital display highlights airfields, hills, towns, waypoints
etc, relative to your aircraft at the centre of the MFD.

 WEAPON STATUS
 This mode gives a symbolic presentation of your external weapon count
on each of the nine hardpoints. Having chosen your weapon type, (shown
on the Head Up Display) the weapons computer will automatically select
the hardpoint. Also shown are the number of remaining rounds of
ammunition, plus the remaining chaff and flare cartridges. The
currently selected weapon is highlighted. Consult this display if you
get a "weapon failure" warning.

 DIGITAL ARTIFICIAL HORIZON
 We are currently evaluating a new concept in arficial horizon design.
A multi-segment circular strip is used to portray the attitude of your
aircraft relative to the ground.
Pitching the nose of the aircraft up gives an impression of flying over
a "hill" and conversely, diving creates a "valley" effect. The
proportions of "sky" and "ground" remain constant as the aircraft rolls.
The distinct advantage of this new British design is that unlike the
conventional spherical artificial horizon, the pilot is always aware of
his aircraft's orientation.

 PRIMARY FLIGHT DATA
 This direct output from the air data computer replaces the old analog
airspeed and altitude indicators that we used to have mounted in the
central console. This display is particularly useful in the event of
HUD failure or on the approach.
  *  IAS Indicated airspeed, Knots
  *  ALT Altitude, feet
  *  VSI Rate of climb, feet per sec.
  *  HDG Aircraft Heading, degrees
  *  FUEL Fuel state ibs

 ZOOM THERMAL IMAGE - with IIR Maverick and/or LANTIRN
 When carrying Maverick AGM-65D (Imaging Infra Red) missiles and/or the
LANTIRN pods, you may select a miniature thermal image on any MFD,
similar to looking through a telephoto lens. Without LANTIRN, you are
effectively viewing the world through the homing head of the missile,
restricted in this case to "hot" targets such as tanks and mobile SAM
launchers. The image enhancing capabilities of LANTIRN enable you to
identify and track any potential target within the capabilites of the
selected weapon. (See weapon management, Chapter 4)

 INSTRUMENT LANDING SYSTEM, AN/ARN-108 (Collins)
 This display is your primary landing aid. The system consists of two
radio beams transmitted from the airfield to help you line up with the
runway centreline and approach the airfield descending along the
correct glidepath. The equipment on board your F-16 uses the two beams
to drive your display.

 (a)LOCALISER
 The beam that helps you line up with the runway centreline is called
the localiser. As you deviate from alignment with the centreline, the
vertical needle on your display will drift in the opposite direction.
 e.g. drifting to the left will cause the vertical needle to drift
right, and vice versa.

 Deviation from the centreline
 So, the localiser needle shows your relative offset from the
centreline and to corect any error you must turn TOWARDS the needle.
Make a corresponding turn in the opposite direction as the needle
centralises to ensure that you finish on the correct heading. It will
help if you have your Up Front Control Panel navigation display locked
to the airfield for range and bearing information.

 (b)GLIDESLOPE
 Thesecond beam provides guidance for adjusting your rate of descent
during your approach to the runway. The "ideal" glidepath leads to
touchdown a few hundred feet beyond the runway threshold. Approaching
too high will cause the glideslope needle to be BELOW the centre of the
display and vice versa. So,to maintain the correct descent rate during
your approach, keep the glideslope needle central. Respond if necessary
by flying TOWARDS the needle, i.e. increase your rate of descent if the
needle is low; decrease your rate of descent if the needle is high.

 Deviation from the glideslope
 To summarise, your ideal approach is achieved by keeping the two
display needles central. "Fly towards the needle" to correct errors.

 When in the vicinity of an ILS system, availability will be confirmed
by the "ILS in range" light on your Up Front Control Panel. The landing
aid is effective up to an altitude of 5000 feet at its maximum range of
approximately 15 miles. n.b. Not all runways have ILS transmitters.

 OTHER INSTRUMENTS:
 Range Warning Receiver, AN/ALR-69 (Dalmo Victor)
 
 To the left of the Up Front Control Panel you will see a small
circular display. This is your passive Radar Warning Receiver. Sensors
positioned around your F-16 are used to detect radar transmissions from
enemy aircraft, radar guided missiles and enemy early warning radar
stations. Used in conjunction with your Threat Warning Panel, it is
possible to determine the source and direction of the threat. It is 
interesting to note that an enemy aircraft using his air-to-air radar
will be detected by your Radar Warning Receiver before he is aware of
your presence. This is because your radar reflection will initially be
too weak to be "seen" by the enemy rader. This illustrates the
importance of maintaining "radar silence" wherever possible.

 Attitude Director Indicator (Clifton Precision)
 To the right of the Up Front Control Panel is your Attitude Director
Indicator, otherwise known as the standby artifical horizon. This
instrument shows the pitch and roll attitude of your aircraft.

 Angle Of Attack Indicator (Gull Airborne)
 The vertical "tape" scale to the centre MFD is the Angle of Attack
indicator. Refer to your ground school notes for a description of angle
of attack, lift etc. From the practical point of view, you can imagine
angle of attack as a measure of how hard the wing is having to work to
generate the required amount of lift. For stability reasons, the angle
of attack is automatically limited to 25 degrees by the fly-by-wire
control system. A typical value during landing is 12 to 13 degrees.

 Vertical Speed indicator
 To the right of the central MFD you will find the Vertical Speed
Indicator. Calibrated in feet per second, this "tape" scale shows your
rate of climb and descent. This instrument is particularly useful
during the landing phase, but dramatic rates of climb/descent will
exceed the full scale deflection.

 Engine rpm indicator
On the far left hand side of the instrument panel, below the Master
Caution light, you will see the new digital engine rpm indicator
together with the afterburner indicator. The old analogue engine rpm
indicator is in the usual place, over by your right knee.

 You will be pleased to hear that we now have the General Electric
F110-GE-100 engine, rated at 27000 lbf maximum thrust. On power up the
engine control system will adjust the idle rpm to around 60%. The
throttle lever by your left hand adjusts engine rpm up to 100% and
then, after passing a detent, moves through into reheat by pushing the
control further forward. The amount of reheat selected is shown on the
afterburner indicator. For your convenience a second digital rpm
display is mounted next to the throttle control.

 Fuel gauge
 Over on the right hand side you will see the fuel gauge, together with
the "fuel low" and "external tanks empty" warning lights. The gauge has
two needle; one for internal fuel supply, and a second for external
load. Fuel is consumed from the external tanks first.

 Please bear in mind that for a given throttle setting, fuel
consumption DECREASES as you gain altitude. Optimum performance is
reached at the normal cruise altitude of around 35000 ft where we find
that fuel consumption is roughly a quarter of the rate at sea level,
giving an approximate flight duration of two hours and a tactical
radius of 500 n.m. on full internal fuel. Using reheat does however
consume fuel very rapidly giving a total duration with maximum reheat
at sea level of less than ten minutes!

 Up Front Control Panel (UFCP)
This panel houses essential Communications, Navigation and
Identification functions (CNI)

 (a) CNI Datalink
 The largest portion of the UFCP is dedicated to a three function
datalink display. Airfield and waypoint navigation data is derived from
your Inertial Navigation System LN-39. Tracking data for enemy aircraft
is obtained via datalink with allied Early Warning radar stations. Use
the UFCP mode selector to cyle through the following modes:

 (i) Airfield
 Range, bearing and ETA information is avialable on all allied
airfields: Select the required airfield using the UfCp channel
selector.
e.g. A3 Airfield 3
  *   RNG 89    range 89 miles
  *   BRG 245   bearing 245 degs
  *   ETA 9:13  estimated time to arrival 9 mins 13 sec

 (ii) Waypoint
 Range, bearing and ETA information is available on all waypoints
defined prior to takeoff. Select the required waypoint using the UFCP
channel selector.
e.g. W1 waypoint 1
  *   RNG 26    range 26 miles
  *   BRG 172   bearing 172 degs
  *   ETA 2:41  estimated time to arrival 2 mins 41 secs

n.b. To fly towards your selected target, adjust your heading to match
the target bearing. The estimated time assumes you are heading towards
the target at your present speed.

 (iii) Tracking
 Allied early warning radar ststions will relay tracking information on
all hostile aircraft currently being monitored. Select the required
channel for range, bearing and altitude data, relative to your own
aircraft.
e.g. T2 target 2
  *   RNG 90    range 90 miles
  *   BRG 018   bearing 18 degs
  *   ALT 35    altitude 35000 ft

 (b) System Control Functions
 To the left of the datalink display you will see six indicator lights:

 Top row (left to right):

"Recce pod on" Comfirms ATARS pod on/off (manual)

 (c) UHF Communications Transceiver AN/ARC-164 (Magnavox)
 Mounted along the bottom of the UFCP is your UHF communications
display. This is used for receiving numerous in-flight messages from
airfields, command centres and EW radar installations.

 Data entry panel
 Before take-off you will be asked by the control tower for your IFF
(Identification Friend or Foe) security code. Having made the
approriate response via your Data Entry Panel you will be cleared to
start your engine, taxi and take off.

 Threat Warning Panel
 Immediately to the left of the Radar Warning Receiver you will find
your Threat Warning Panel. This consists of five warning lights, each
designed to bring to your attention a particular type of threat.
   * SAM - launch of surface to air missile detected. Threat will
     appear on your Radar Warning Receiver if radar guided, otherwise
     you can assume infra-red guidance. Respond by releasing chaff or
     flares. Manoeuvre to deplete missile energy and maximise tracking
     errors.
   * AAM - launch of air to air missile detected. Threat will appear on
     your Radar Warning Receiver if radar guided, otherwise you can
     assume infra-red guidance. Respond by releasing chaff or flares.
     Manoeuvre to deplete missile energy and maximise tracking errors.
   * ECM - enemy is transmitting Electronic Countermeasures in an
     attempt to defeat your tracking radar or air-to-air missile.
   * IFF - you are being tracked by the radar of an enemy aircraft.
     Consult your Radar Warning Receiver to determine his approximate
     bearing.
   * EWR - you are being tracked by an enemy Early Warning Radar
     installation. Consult your Radar Warning Receiver to determine its
     approximate bearing.

 Your Airborne Self Protection Jammer (ASPJ, AN/ALQ-165, Westinghouse/
ITT) should automatically attempt to break any radar tracking beam but
don't depend upon it too heavily. Once the enemy are aware of your
approach they are not going to give up trying to track you and far
worse, you can expectto be met fairly soon by enemy interceptors. To
break the lock, fly as low as possible and alter your course.

 Warning lights
   * ALERT master caution light. Attracts your attention when any
     "subsystem" fails. Consult your Failure Status Panel to determine
     the precise failure.
   * ENG engine failure - not a pleasant sight considering that you
     have only one engine! Given sufficient altitude and a nearby
     airfield you should be able to execute a "dead stick" landing.
     Practice makes perfect!
   * FIRE warning of on board fire. Your only option is to eject.
   * FUEL fuel low warning. Flashes when fuel low, stays lit when out
     of fuel. Do not ignore! The consequences lead to unscheduled
     gliding practice....
   * EXT external fuel tanks empty - comfirms empty tanks as cue to
     jettison if required.

 Other lights
   * Undercarriage - extreme left of instrument panel. Three GREENs
     confirm undercarriage UP.
   * Jettison - below the undercarriage light. You may jettison only
     external tanks, or jettison all external load with the exception
     of missiles fitted to the wingtips. The light illuminates to
     confirm operation.
   * Wheel brakes - illuminated when wheel brakes are ON
   * Air brakes - illuminated when air brakes are ON

 Eject handle - below the centre MFD. When all else fails, this is the
last resort. Pulling the "loud handle" could save your life but don't
use it at low altitude when inverted....

 Left hand panel
  Turning to your left you will see the throttle grip which is used to
control engine rpm and reheat in the normal manner - forward to
increase, back to decrease. You will probably notice a slight delay
between your throttle movement and the change in engine rpm. This is
quite normal and is due to the inertia of the engine's rotating blades.
Once lit, your engine control system will prohibit a deliberate shut
down of the engine.

 Typical engine rpm at the idle setting is about 60%. The power curve
of the engine gives a gradual increase in thrust up to around 90% rpm,
above which you will experience a rapid thrust increase up to 100% rpm.
This is the maximum "dry" thrust or full military power. Further engine
thrust is achieved with the selection of reheat. The principle operates
on spraying additional fuel into the engine exhaust whereupon it
ignites to provide a significant increase in thrust e.g. from 16000 lb
to 27000 ib. Reheat is selected by moving the throttle grip through a
detent beyond which you have linear control up to maximum thrust. To
select reheat, push the throttle until you reach 100% rpm, release the
throttle monentarily and then continue to push to the required reheat
level as indicated next to the rpm readout. n.b. Enginerpm does not
increase with the selection of reheat. Reheat will cause a dramatic
increase in fuel consumption. Use it sparingly!

Right hand panel
 Looking over to your right you will see the sidestick controller.
Instead of a conventional control column, your F-16 is fiited with a
force-sensitive sidestick. Movement is minimal, with pitch and roll
rates being proportional to the pressure applied. The sidestick also
offers a nose wheel steering facility when moving on the ground at
speeds below 95 kts.

 Mechanical compass
 Further forward you will see the back up mechanical compass,
calibrated every 10 degrees e.g. 09 = East, 18 = South, 27 = West, 36 =
North

 Also on the right hand side you have the Failure Status panel. Consult
this panel when you see the Master Caution light illuminate.
   * FBW - failure of fly-by-wire channel. Results in reduced aircraft
     agility. Control system gains halved.
   * U/C - undercarriage failure. If you cannot lower your
     undercarriage you will have no option but to do a "wheels up"
     landing - VERY GENTLY! One of the early prototypes managed it and
     just scraped the paint - it is possible.
   * RAD - radar failure. All radar modes lost.
   * OXY - oxygen system failure. Flight above 8000 feet will lead to
     impaired vision and eventually loss of consciousness.
   * NAV - failure of the INS. All navigation aids on your UFCP will
     cease to function.
   * LAN - failure of LANTIRN night vision pod or targetting pod.
     Automatic target selection will be lost. Enhangced night vision
     will be lost.
   * HUD - failure of the Head Up Display. Loss of all weapon aiming
     functions and head up flight data - speed, altitudeetc.
   * ECM - failure of ASPJ ECM jammer. More susceptible to radar
     tracking.
   * COM - failure of communications transceiver. GCA option no longer
     available.
   * RWR - failure of Radar Warning Receiver. Detection of enemy radar
     tracking beams will cease.
   * WPN - weapon failure. Consult weapon status display on an MFD to
     determine precise failure.
   * ILS - failure of Instrument Landing System. Automatic landing will
     no longer be available since autopilot uses the ILS system.

 Rear view
 Your F-16 offers excellent all round vision from the cockpit. During
combat manoeuvres this is essential. Makes sure that periodically you
look out each side and to the rear to check for hostile aircraft.

 Head Up Display (GEC Avionics UK)
 Superimposed upon your view ahead is a peojection of symbolic and
alphanumeric information. Essential information such as airspeed,
heading, altitude and weapon aiming symbology are presented enabling
you to focus outside the cockpit ("head up") for the majority of the
time. The display also has the ability to present a "daylight" infra-
red image when usedin conjunction with LANTIRN for night flying.

 Aircraft heading
 Magnetic compass heading across top of display. Incrementing left to
right, notared in units of 10 degrees, calibrated every 5 degrees,
resolution 1 degree. Central marker at your present heading.

 Indicated airspeed
 Vertical scale on left hand side of display. Incrementing from bottom
to top, notated in units of 10 knots, calibrated every 10 knots,
resolution 2 knots. Central marker shows your current indicated
airspeed (n.b. NOT true airspeed; see Ground School notes for
description of difference if you are not sure).

 Altitude
 Vertical scale on right hand side of display. Incrementing from bottom
to top, notated in units of 1000 feet, calibrated every 100 feet,
resolution 20 feet. Central marker at your present altitude.

 Flight Path Ladder
 Pitch bars (switch selectable) show aircraft pitch and roll altitude
relative to the ground. Ends of bars point downwards when climbing and
upwards when diving. Notated in units of 10 degrees. Present value
intersects centre of HUD.

 Aircraft symbol
 At the centre of the HUD is a small synbol representing your aircraft.
The symbol inverts to show inverted flight.

 g force
 At the top left hand corner of the HUD you willsee a readout of g
force (weight multiplying factor) currently acting upon your aircraft
and you.

 Mach number
 Your speed is given at the top right hand corner, expressed in units
of the speed of sound at your present altitude.

 Range
 The uppermost figure at the bottom right hand corner of the HUD is
the distance, in miles, to your current target.

 Bearing
 Immediately below Range you will find target bearing. Ajust your
heading to this value in order to fly directly towards the target.

 Weapon symbology:
 Selecting a particular weapon will be confirmed on the HUD by its
abbreviation or "discrete":
   *  M61A1    cannon
   *  AIM9M    Sidewinder
   *  AIM120   Amraam
   *  DUR      Durandal
   *  AGM88    HARM
   *  MK84     2000lb bomb
   *  MK83     1000lb bomb
   *  AGM65D   IIR Maverick
   *  AGM65E   Laser Maverick
   *  MK82     Snakeye bomb

 plus no. of weapon type remaining
   *  LOCK     radar locked on to target
   *  IN RNG   in range cue for selected weapon

 Ranging reticle
 Afterdesignating a target on your radar, the ranging reticle will
appear atthe centre of the HUD. This symbol provides a dynamic visual
cue of the range to your target.

 Target designator
 This small box gives you an indication of where your target will
appear on the HUD as it comes within visual range.

 Lock-on diamond
 Once the launch parametters of your chosen weapon are fulfilled, the
homing head will confirm lock-on by superimposing a diamond over the
target.

 CCIP
 To ensure accurate delivery of unguided bombs, your weapons computer
offers a Continuosly Computed Impact Point, displayed on the HUD for
the appropriate weapons. Place the displayed "impact point" over the
desired target at the point of release.

 That just about covers everything. Any questions?

 Getting airborne
 OK. Time to get airborne. "Free flight" is a good place to start if
you're low on flying hours Don't forgetto register your pilot's log -
paperwork is important too!

 Free flight
 On all training missions your flight will begin with a fully
servicable aircraft, loaded with a weapon configuration appropriate to
the sortie. Having requested permission to take-off, the control tower
will ask for your IFF (Identification Friend or Foe) security code.
Clearance to start your engine and taxi to the runway will then follow.

 Check your straps, one last look around - all clear - power up! Engine
rpm will rapidly reach idle level (approximately 60%). Nudge the
throttle forward gently to start taxiing away from the hangar. Steer by
using either the sidestick  controller (Nose Wheel Steering) or the
rudder pedals (differential braking). Make your way over to the runway,
line up with the centreline, throttle back to idle and apply the wheel
brakes.

 Canopy locked. Control surfaces functioning. Clear for take-off.
Holding the wheel brakes on, open the throttle to 80% rpm. Release the
brakes. Open the throttle to 100% and follow through to full reheat.
Hold tight! At a typical combat weight, this bird accelerates from 0 to
125 kts in approximately 10 seconds. As your speed passes through 125
kts, pull back gently on the sidestick to raise the nose. You will
become airborne at roughly 150 kts with the speed continuing to
increase even if you pull up into a vertical climb, providing that your
All Up Weight is not in excess of 26000lb or so. Normal climb out from
the airfield is at about 60 degrees. Retract the undercarriage
immediately - you'll stress the retraction mechanism if you exceed 300
kts with the wheels down and your ground crew will NOT be pleased.
Flaperon operation is totally automatic with the fly-by-wire system
adjusting the leading and trailing edge settings optimum wing lift at
all times. (See your ground school notes)

 Having reached about 5000 feet, pull the throttle out of reheat and
begin with a few gentle turns left and right to get a feel of the
aircraft's response. Response. Remember to keep an eye open for other
aircraft as you manoeuvre. As you bank your aircraft the "g" force
required to sustain the turn increases. If you do not pull back on the
sidestick as you roll, your aircraft will start to slip into the turn
and the nose will fall slowly. Momentary back pressure on the sidestick
will "trim" the aircraft by increasing your angle of attack and you
will see a corresponding increase in "g" force (top left corner of the
HUD).

Once you become confident, try a few 360 degree rolls and tight turns.
Notice how the maximum roll rate increases with forward speed. When
manoeuvering at lower speeds you will notice the fly-by-wire control
syatem limiting your angle of attack to 25 degrees. This is a built-in
design feature to help you avoid stalling or spinning. If the aircraft
finds that it cannot generate the required lift, the nose will
automatically be lowered in order to increase the airspeed. For a more
detailed discussion on aerodynamics, see your ground school notes.

Similarly, at higher speeds the pitch rate is automatically limited to
avoid overstressing the airframe. The F-16 will allow you to pull up to
9g (within its combat speed range) but don't expect to hold this for
very long or you will black out. The effect is only temporary but
things could get nasty at low altitude. Even worse, pushing on the
sidestick will build up negative "g" resulting in "redout" - NOT to be
recommended.

During a sustained turn the wings need to generate extralift if the
aircraft is not to lose altitude. This extra lift is generated by
increasing the wing incidence which in turn creates extra aerodynamic
drag. So, in a turn, you will notice your speed decay if you do not
compensate by increasing the engine thrust. For example, in a 9g turn
at approximately 600 kts you may need all the thrust you have -
including reheat - depending upon your aircraft weight.

Here's an interesting manoeuvre. Roll your aircraft to approximately 45
degrees and pull up into a climbing turn. As you continue to pull you
will perform an "off-axis" loop i.e. inclined to the vertical.

During the manoeuvre you will see changes in both pitch and roll
angles, with pitch decreasing to about 45 degrees and then decreasing
as you pull into inverted flight. Unfortunately the ground school
simulator doesn't get this right and ends up pitching over 90 degrees,
even at steep roll angles!

During "free flight" you are invited to fly to any of the designated
ranges for target practice. You will NOT be subjected to dummy SAM
alerts and drone interceptor aircraft - you will probably have enough
on your plate already.

Before getting too adventurous, it will be well worth while to practice
your take-off and landing technique, usually referred to as "circuits
and bumps". The idea is to remain within the airfield "circuit",
getting familar with landmarks, perspectives and aircraft handling.

The following illustration is a suggested circuit pattern with
distances and altitudes that should give you plenty of time to correct
for errors. As you become more proficient you will be able to stay much
closer to the airfield, perhaps performing "airshow style" tight-turn
take-offs and approaches.

 So, let's start thinking about getting back down. On your Up Front
Control Panel should be range and bearing information for the airfield.
Turn onto the displayed bearing and your Inertial Navigation System
will show you the estimate time to arrival. Aim to be approaching the
airfield at about 125 kts, at 4000 ft altitude and 15 miles from
touchdown. For assistance from the control tower, transmit your
callsign and requesta Ground Control Approach (GCA). If you would like
to practice your landing technique, ask the instructor to position your
aircraft on the approach by requesting "Landing Practice" prior to
take-off.

 Landing Practice
 Your flight begins at 2500 ft, lined up with the runway 10 miles from
touchdown. At a typical approach speed of 125 kts you will have
approximately 4 minutes before crossing the runway threshold. During
your approach you may either (a) proceed without assistance (b) request
a GCA talkdown (Ground Control Approach) or (c) select autopilot.
Option (a) is what you should be aiming for, option (b) will give you a
little help from the control tower, and option (c) is for those who
want to see how it SHOULD be done.

 (a) manualapproach
 Checklist: (all values approximate and will vary with aircraft weight)
   *  throttle 78%
   *  speed 125 kts
   *  altitude 2500  ft
   *  AoA approx. 13degs
   *  VSI - 11 ft/s
   *  pitch +5 degs
   *  touchdown 10 mis
   *  undercarriage down

 Contact the airfield control tower by transmitting your callsign. Be
prepared for the response:
   *  "ROGER callsign"
   *  "STATUS GREEN"
   *  "CLEAR TO LAND"

 Use your Instrument System to ensure that you maintain the correct
glideslope during the approach. Lowering the undercarriage will make
the aircraft response less agile (imposed by the fly-by-wire system)
and the flaps will automaticallyadopt the landing configuration. Be
ready to adjust the throttle slightly to account for the extra drag.
Aim to touchdown a few hundred feet beyond the runway threshold,
remembering to "flare" (pull the nose up slightly) just before
touchdown in order tom raduce your rate of descent. After touchdown
close the throttle and apply your wheel brakes after the nosewheel has
lowered. Having finally stopped, take a look aroundfor the nearest
hangar, open the throttle slightly and begin to taxi. Your debrif will
begin after stopping inside the hangar.

 (b) Ground Control Approach, GCA
 Select the required airfield on your UFCP and transmit your callsign.
 Tower response:
   *  "ROGER FALCON"
   *  "STATUS GREEN" airfield combat status
   *  "CLEAR TO LAND"

 Request GCA to start GCA approach
   *  "ROGER FALCON"
   *  "STARTING GCA"
   *  "TURN LEFT TO 270"    adjust your heading to 270
   *  "DESCEND TO 2500 FT"  adjust your altitude
   *  "FINAL APPROACH"      turn into final approach
   *  "HDG 360 VSI-8"       Adjust heading and rate of descent
   *  "HDG OK VSI OK"       on finals...
   *  "WELCOME TO BASE"     after touchdown

 (c) Autopilot
 Your aircraft is fitted with a landing aid which links the autopilot
with the Instrument Landing System to give a fully automated landing.
This may only be used if both your ILS equipment is functioning and
ILS is available on the selected runway. The autopilot may be selected
whenever the "ILS in range" light on the UFCP is lit. Control is fully
apply the wheel brakes as usual.

 (d) Dead stick landing
 If you are unfortunate enough to be faced with a "dead stick" landing
i.e. gliding in after engine failure, first ensure that all external
stores are jettisoned. For a fixed wing fighter, the F-16 is very
efficient at gliding with a typical altitude loss of 750 feet for every
nautical mile flown. Adopting a slightly nose down attitude, maintain
an indicated airspeed of approximatly 170 kts to give you the optimum
glidepath. Your VSI should be around 40 feet per second. Do not put
your undercarriage down during the approach - you cannot afford the
extra drag. As you approach the runway threshold, lower your
undercarriage and pull gently on the sidestick to flare and reduce your
rate of descent to around 5 to 10 ft/sec. With practice you will be
able to execute this manoeuvre with confidence - practice makes
perfect! Having made a safe touchdown and brought your aircraft to a
standstill, you will of course not be able to taxi to the hangar. The
ground crew will be along shortly to congratulate you...
It is vital that you perfect the technique of landing your aircraft
safely! The only good landing is one that you can walk away from, with
your aircraft in one piece!
