     The F16 Combat Pilot Docs.........part II

     Flying training

      During training, you may select a dummy "front line mission" for any
     role of the F-16.
        *  SCRAMBLE - air-to-air interception
        *  HAMMERBLOW - offensive counterair operations
        *  DEEPSTRIKE - interdictor strike
        *  TANKBUSTER - battlefield close air support
        *  WATCHTOWER - reconnaisance
      Objectives will be assigned appropriate to your mission with simulated
     SAM warnings and "hostile" drone aircraft injected to maximise the
     "realism" of your sortie. Although there is no danger of actually being
     shot down, you will be warned of any "simulated kill" if you would not
     have survived in real combat.

      Remember to take notes during your pre-flight briefing and plan your
     flight route carefully. Your ground crew will ensure that your aircraft
     is fully serviced, refuelled and armed with a weapon mix appropriate to
     your mission.

      "Know and use all the capabilities of your airplane. If you don't,
     sooner or later, some guy who does will kick your ass."
                                     -Lt.D.Pace, U.S.Navy FWS Instructor

      Chapter 4 FRONT LINE OPERATIONS
     WARNING! Do NOT embark upon a mission without training....it is
     DANGEROUS!

     Mission selection
     If is daybreak. You join the other pilots in the squadron crewroom to
     discuss objectives for the day ahead. Tactics, combat manoeuvres, one
     thing is quite clear - you're all itching to get airborne.

     The majority of your flying will be on missions assigned by Tartical
     Air Command (TAC) with front line operations grouped into the 5 primary
     roles of the F-16:
        *  SCRAMBLE - air-to-air interception
        *  HAMMERBLOW - offensive counterair operations
        *  DEEPSTRIKE - interdictor strike
        *  TANKBUSTER - battlefield close air support
        *  WATCHTOWER - reconnaisance
      Having made your selection, you proceed to the pre-flight briefing for
     target details and weapon loading.

      Now, for all you fighter jocks who want to take the F-16 back to its
     roots, TAC has a special assignment:
        *  GLADIATOR - one-on-one dogfight

      Never mind the SAM's or other "everyday" problems, just get out there
     and take him out!

      And finally .....
        *  OPERATION COQUEST - multi-mission strategic campaign

      Tactical Air Command will not allows novice pilots to command
     Operation Conquest - the risk is too great! Permission will be granted








     only after you have completed a successful mission in each of the
     primary roles at your first squadron.

     MISSION TACTICS

      SCRAMBLE - air-to-air interception
     Hostile aircraft approaching........no time to lose! Your ground crew
     have refuelled and re-armed your aircraft, ready for take-off.
     Don't forget your pre-flight briefing.......
          *   MiG-29s.......check!
          *   15000 ft......check!
          *   25 miles......check!
          *   Heading 260...check!

      Weather update.....cloudbase 25000 ft, light SW winds

      OBJECTIVE: Intercept and destroy hostile aircraft.

      To explain fully the principles of air combat would take a book in
     itself so let's take a look at the five basic elements involved:

      (a)DETECTION.
     Early warning radar may be able to help you here providing that the
     targets is not flying too low. Locating and tracking the target is best
     done with your air-to-air radar but bear in mind that it is a
     transmitter and will warn the enemy of your approach. The most
     important factor with detection is "the earlier the betteer" in order
     to give you time to plan your attack and to select the right weapon.

           "He who sees first,lives longest"    -Unknown

      (b)POSITIONING
     Your most effective weapon is surprise. The majority of kills are made
     without the target even being aware of the attack until it is too late.
     So, planning your approach is vital. A wide sweeping turn to a position
     above and behind your enemy will give you maximum "energy" and the
     upper hand as you begin your attack.

      (c)ATTACK
     Having chosen your weapon commit yourself to the attack. Speed is very
     important now in order to maintain the element of surprise. Watch for
     the launch parameters of your weapon and let him have it!

      (d)ENGAGE
     Unless you caught your target completely off guard, expect him to make
     some pretty dramatic evasive manoeuvres. Put him on the defensive by
     getting in the first shot, then manoeuvre your aircraft onto his tail
     as quickly as possible. The most well known combat manoeuvres are
     described in detail in chapter 5 so make sure you've had plenty of
     practice. Pilots will also tell you that violent uncoordinated turns
     are often the best way to throw the enemy off your tail, so it pays to
     not be too predictable!

      Things can happen extremely quickly during a dogfight which may only
     last a few seconds so try to keep a good idea of what your target is
     doing and where he is - often easier said then done! On top of this you
     must keep an eye on your altitude and speed - trade off one for the
     other but don't let your speed drop significantly or you'll end up








     being the target.

      (e)BREAK OFF
     The key to success in any dogfight is to remain as aggressive as
     possible. However, if you suffer extensive damage or see that you are
     running dangerously low on fuel, it's time to get the hell out of
     there. How? This could be tricky! Speed and height are what you really
     need so it's time to select full afterburner and head for home. Unfor-
     tunately, your opponent is not going to give up the chase too easily...

      HAMMERBLOW - offensive counterair operations
     Our objectives here are to reduce the enemy's ability to strike back.
     We achieve this by a variety of ground attack missions focussed upon
     military installations such as:

      (a) AIRFIELDS - runways, hangars, grounded aircraft, control tower etc
      (b) MILITARY BASES - these control the deployment of mobile ground
          forces
      (c) C-CUBED CENTRES - responsible for intelligence and EW coordination
      (d) EARLY WARNING RADAR INSTALLATIONS
      (e) SAM AND ANTI-ARTILLERY (AAA) SITES

     TAC will select your target and brief you with the necessary detaiels
     prior to take-off. You may even get a few words of advice about
     potential hazards in the target area so be ready to take notes.

     Your ground crew have refulled your aircraft and will recommend a
     suitable weapon configuration if you so request. Don't forget to make
     at least a couple of air-to-air missiles in case you attract some
     unwelcome attention.

     The most important aspect, as in any mission, is surprise. Here are a
     few tips so that you give the enemy as little warning as possible.

     (a) Flying directly to a target will allow the enemy to anticipate your
     objectives and prepare its defence. So, a common tactic is to plan your
     flight path with a dramatic change of direction prior to arriving at
     the target.

     (b) Flying low will minimise the possiblity of you being tracked by
     enemy early warning radar. This should reduce the likelihood of enemy
     interceptors appearing.

     (c) Unless radio and radar "silence" as much as possible. Transmitting
     to an airfield or using your radar will only make the enemy aware of
     your presence.

     (d) Unless directed to attack a SAM site or EW radar it is best to
     avoid these at all costs.

     "Fly low, hit hard!"
     OBJEKTIVE: Destroy assigned target(s) and return to base.

      DEEPSTRIKE-interdictor strike
      As a key member of our interdictor fighter wing, you will now focus
     your attention on vital suppert installations and supply links. Targets
     of particular interest include:









     (a) FUEL DEPOTS - control fuel supply to airfields & military bases.
     (b) POWER STATIONS - supply power to factories.
     (c) FACTORIES - provide essential & replenishment.
     (d) BRIDGES - supply route choke points.

      Your priorities are clean. Penetrate enemy airspace, avoid ground
     defences, strike yous assigned target and get home as soon as possible.
     Easy? Don't you belive it! These missions need to be planned if you're
     going to survive. Organise your flight plan carefully - TAC will want
     to know where to look if you don't make it back! Get familiar with your
     route and any possible landmarks that you can use on the way. It's
     also a good  idea to estimate your time to each waypoint - any fuel
     reserves are going to be essential if you have to divert to an
     alternative airfield.

      Your ground crew will recommend a suitable weapon load or, of course,
     you may select your own preferred configuration. Above all, keep a
     watchful eye on your threat warning panel and be prepared for the
     arrival of enemy interceptors. Just hit that Dogfight button and get in
     there!

      Objective: Destroy assigned target(s) and return to base.

      TANKBUSTER - battlefield close air support
      Low level ground attack in the heat of the battlefield.....perhaps the
     most dangerous mission of all. Our intelligence sources have located
     allied and enemy tank battalions locked in a fierce land battle. Heavy
     losses are predicted unless you can provide air support - and fast!
     Now, these guys aren't fooling around down there, they'll shoot at
     anything that moves! Chances are there will be helicoptergunships
     providing air cover, backed up by mobile radar-guided SAM launchers.
     Still willing to volunteer?

      Your first priority will be to down any patrolling gunships so a
     couple of AMRAAMS should clear the air before you arrive. Use your
     air-to-air radar in track-while-scan mode to search during your
     approach - any choppers should be sitting ducks. Your next biggest
     threat are those mobile SAM launchers so keep an eye on your Threat
     Warning Panel. Be ready to use chaff and flares. Use your Mavericks
     to clear the area of SAMs before you arrive. Now, what about those
     tanks? Take LANTIRN with you if it's available. This box of tricks
     gives you automatic target acquisition and long range missile guidance
     for both infra-red and laser-guided Maverick missiles. Survival is the
     name of the game and if you can pick off your targets from a reasonable
     stand-off distance so muchthe better. However, this is not a perfect
     would and LANTIRN pods may be in short supply. What now? Well, laser-
     guided Mavericks may still be used from long range providing that
     allied infantry in the area are equipped with laser targets
     designators. A last resort is to use your AGM-65D IIR Mavericks by
     locking-on "visually" using the infra-red zoom lens of the missile.
     Without LANTIRN however this can only be achieved at relatively close
     range.

     OBJECTIVE: Assist your ground forces to clear the area of all enemy
     armoured vehicles, SAM launchers and hostile helicopter gunships.

      WATCHTOWER - reconnaissance
      For TAC to plan and coordinate its operations it is essential that up








     to date informations be acquired on the movement of enemy ground
     forces. Despite the advent of spy satellites, reconnaissance missions
     remain a vital source of intelligence. Present techniques involve two
     different approaches (a) high speed, high altitude sorties typical of
     the SR-71 Blackbird and (b) high speed, ultra-low level sorties which
     is where you come in....

      We have recently taken delivery of the very latest high-tech
     reconnaissance pod - ATARS (Advanced þactical Air Reconnaissance
     System) Mounted on your centreline weapons pylon, you can transmit your
     information in real time via relay stations back to HQ giving literally
     an up-to-the-minute strategic and tactical update.

      A vitally important aspect of any reconniassance mission is to keep
     the enemy unaware of where you've been and what you've learned about
     his movements. So, plan your route carefully, keep yourself as light
     and manoeuvreable as possible with a minimum self-defence capability,
     and remember to switch on your ATARS transmitter ONLY when  you're
     over the target area.

     OBJECTIVE:  Fly over designated areas and transmit data back to HQ
     One last point...your ATARS pod is the very best that technology
     can offer. Don't let it fall into enemy hands....BRING IT BACK!

     GLADIATOR - two-player dogfight (dual pilots only)
      Select this mission for an exhilerating head-to-head battle. Your
     mission beginsat take-off with an air combat weapon load. (No preflight
     briefing necessary, no pilot log active.) Intelligence will inform you
     of your opponent's location and EW radar will track him during flight
     if he strays above 500 ft. (See T0 on UFCP) A new mission begin after
     each kill.

     GOOD LUCK!

     It is already clear thatthe enemy offensive consists primarilyof low
     flying ground attack aircraft and highly mobile tank battalions. their
     priorities are unknown, but many of our military installations and
     strategic support services are under threat. Things should become
     clearer as you learn more about the enemy's movements. Right now the
     enemy is enjoying air superiority - you've got to change that!

     Unlike your other front line duties, OPERATION CONQUEST will test your
     leadership and flying skills throughout a conflict that you hoped
     would never happen. Day and night, regardless of weather, the enemy
     advance continues. Without air support the allies will suffer heavy
     losses and morale will fall. Every ounce of experience will be needed
     to prevent the enemy from fulfilling his objective - total defeat of
     the allies.

     As squadron commander it is your responsibility to anticipate the
     enemy's intentions, consider the consequences and act decisively. Under
     your command is a squadron of allied aircraft capable of flying
     missions in parallel to you own. Assignmentof targets and the effective
     use of these aircraft is YOUR responsibility during the pre-flight
     briefing but be prepared to face problems of reliability and shortages
     of weapons and spares - your ground crew can't work miracles!

     Study your strategic display carefully during your preflight briefing.
     Watch out for any weak links. Essential strategic installations can be
     repaired, given time and spares, but don't rely on either! Your
     priorities must remain flexible. TAC has prepared the following brief
     to assist with formulating your strategy:

                           TACTICAL AIR COMMAND
                     OPERATION CONQUEST - TARGET BRIEF
                           COMMANDER'S EYES ONLY

     (a) AIRFIELDS - These range from minor airstrips with limited support
     capability to major front line stations. Airfields are heavily defended
     with SAM launchers and anti-aircraft. Your prioties here will include
     any visible aircraft on the ground, and putting the runway(s) out of
     action.

     (b) MILITARY BASES - These control the deployment of mobile ground
     forces, including tank batallions, SAM launchers and helicopter
     gunships. Destruction of these bases will reduce military coordination
     and effectiveness. Heavily defended.

     (c) FACTORIES - Supply weapons, spares, new military equipment (tanks,
     aircraft, etc) and provide an essential repair service for all damaged








     installations. Factories are considered relatively "soft" targets
     (i.e. not so heavily defended) but not all sites are of strategic
     importance.

     (d) POWER STATIONS - Provide power to factories. Because of their
     strategic importance they are very heavily defended. Output will only
     cease if all colling towers are destroyed.

     (e)FUEL DEPOTS - Supply fuel for aircraft and mobile ground forces.
     Relatively "soft" targets but numerous. Their destruction will lead to
     fuel shortages and reduced mobility for all military vehicles.

      (f) SAM & AAA SITES - These are major ground defence installations
     offering long range, wide area defence against air attack. Avoid if
     possible or destroy from reasonable "standoff" range. Do not confuse
     with mobile SAM and AAA vehicles or shoulder-launced SAM's, all
     offering short range cover.

     (g) EARLY WARNING RADAR STATIONS - Responsible for tracking intruder
     aircraft and scrambling enemy interceptors. Avoid detection by flying
     below 500 feet, if possible, and take advantage of any "blind spots"
     midway between stations. Damage will reduce their effective range. Any
     area without radar cover is extremely vulnerable to air attack
     therefore EW stations are heavily defended.

     (h) COMMAND, CONTROL & COMMUNICATION CENTRES - responsible for
     producing intelligence reports, in-flight updates and the coordination
     of air and land forces. Heavily defended.

     (i) TANK BATTALIONS - Responsible for offensive ground attack on
     strategic installations. Highly mobile with cover against air attack
     provided by SAM launchers and/or helicopter gunships. Capable of
     limited self defence.
     (j) BRIDGES - Usually referred to as "supply choke points". The
     destruction of bridges will have a detrimental effect on the supply of
     spares, weapons and fuel.

      Your experience during OPERATION CONQUEST will be recorded in your
     personallog under "commanding hours" and "successful campaigns". As
     commander you will not "personally" embark upon a flying mission but
     instead fly as a squadron pilot, under your own callsign. In the event
     of this pilot being "killed in action", you will continue flying as
     another pilot, subject to the availability of aircraft. After
     successfully completing a campaign you will be offered the opportunity
     to transfer to a squadron of higher status during the debriefing.

     For safety reasons, all weapons are disarmed until you are airborne.

     AIR-TO-AIR missiles
     You have two types available:

     Sidewinder AIM-9M
     Infra-red (IR)
     Min.range 0.5nm
     Max.range 11 nm

     AMRAAM AIM-120A
     Radar guided








     Min.range 0.5nm
     Max.range over 30 nm

      Both of these  missiles are "fire-and-forget" i.e. you may turn away
     from your target after weapon release. Although modern technology gives
     these missiles an "all-aspect" capability, they are most lethal when
     fired at a target either head-on or from astern.

      Vulnerability cone & lethal cone
     The missiles is armed using the weapon selector to bring the AIM9M or
     AIM120 discrete onto the head up display (HUD). The number remaining is
     also shown. In the centre of the HUD you will see the raning reticle,
     calibrated to approximatelt 30 mls.

      Your attack will begin having located the target on your air radar,
     probably in "track-while-scan" mode. Locking on to your chosen target
     with the "designate" command, you will see the LOCK discrete appear at
     the bottom left hand corner of the HUD and the target designator box
     overlaying the target if it is within the HUD field of view. The target
     will probably still be out of visual range so use the designator box as
     a steering cue. Look to the bottom right hand corner of the HUD for
     target range and bearing information. Prsitioned in the centre of the
     HUD you will now see the ranging reticle. As you get closer to the
     target you will see the ranging reticle "unwinding" in a counter-
     clockwise direction.

      Once you are within range for the selected weapon you will see the IN
     RNG discrete appear on the HUD and the weapon will confirm its own
     lock-on by superimposing a diamond over the target as soon as its
     launch parameters are satisfied. Manoeuvre until the target is
     reasonably central on the HUD and launch your weapon.

      In the case of the AMRAAM, your radar will have passed tracking
     information to the hominng head up to point of launch. Guidance is
     automatic thereafter, party inertial, partly by its own radar. Be
     prepared for an ECM warning, (see Threat Warning Panel) indicating that
     your target is trying to confuse the missile with electronic counter-
     measures. This light will extinguish automatically if either your
     on-board ASJP (Airborne Self Protection Jammer) or the AMRAAM's
     internal ECCM (Electronic Counter-Counter Measures) manage to counter
     the ECM defence.

      The Sidewinder homes in on infra-red (heat) emissions from the target-
     a glowing afterburner being a particular favourite. Don't get confuse
     by the LOCK cue from your radar. The Sidewinder is NOT receiving radar
     guidance, you are! The missile will comfirm its own lock-on with the
     usual diamond symbol. After launch, the missile will follow the
     strongest heat source and that could be decoy flares if the enemy pilot
     has realised what is happening. So, if he tries to fool the missile, be
     ready for sharp evasive manoeuvres - he may just pass through your gun
     sights. Also, the missile's inability to distinguish one infra-red
     source from another makes it unwise to use when allied aircraft are
     close by or engaged in the same dogfight. Another point worth noting is
     that infra-red guidance systems do not work well in cloud so don't
     waste your Sidewinders if you find yourself above the cloudbase.
     Likewise, zooming for cloud cover may save your life if an IR missile
     is heading for your tailpipe.









      Don't forget that all missiles have a minimum range as well as a
     maximum. On launch, the missile accelerates very rapidly to its maximum
     speed and may in fact overshoot and miss the target all together if you
     are too close. If you find yourself staring down his tailpipe, arm your
     M61 internal gun and give it your best shot.

      AIR-TO-GROUND MISSILES

     HARM AGM-88A, High Speed Anti-Radiation Missile
     HARM is a highly effective missile for use against any form of ground
     radar emitter e.g. early warning radar stations and radar-guided SAM
     installations. Your Threat Warning Panel includes a "radar tracking"
     warning light which illuminates whenever you are being tracked by a
     ground-based air defence radar. Assuming that you have HARM on board,
     proceed as follows.

      Use your weapon selector to arm the AGM-88 (confirmed on your HUD) and
     slect "Ground Target Ranging" radar mode on one of your multi-function
     displays. Working in conjunction with your radar, your weapons computer
     will now restrict displayed targets to ground radar installations, and
     the radar will automatically select the offending site shown on your
     Radar Warning Receiver. Lock on to the target using the "target
     designate" command. Operation of HUD symbology for radar LOCK, target
     designator box, ranging reticle, IN RNG cue and the weapon lock-on
     diamond, is the same as for air-to-air weapons.

      HARM is the very latest anti-radiation missile, sufficiently
     intelligent tostill find itstarget even if the enemy's transmitter is
     switched off after launch. Effective range approximately 4nm.

     MAVERICIK AGM-65
     The stores inventory includes the two most popular versions of this
     highly effective air-to-ground missile:
      * AGM-65D Imaging Infra Red (IIR)
      * AGM-65E Laser guided
     Both types may be slaved to the LANTRIN target acquisition system,
     greatly enhancing stand-off range, accuracy and ease of use. Above
     30000 ft the weapon becomes unstable.

     The AGM-65D is by far the most common version. Use the weapon
     selector to arm the missile, confirmed on the HUD by AGM-65D. Next
     put one of your MFDs into "thermal image" mode. Target acquisition
     without LANTIRN is by means of the of the imaging infa-red seeker
     in the nose of the missile which is used to generate a zoom thermal
     image on an MFD in your cockpit. Any "hot" target (i.e tank or mobile
     SAM launcher) wihtin the missile's field of wiew may be indentified
     beyond visual range, up to approximately 3 miles.

     Having indentified your target (ensuring that it's hostile and NOT
     allied!) "pickle" the weapon to lock the homing head to the target.
     The lock-on diamond will now appear and track your target, within
     the constraints of the HUD.

     The ranging reticle is calibrated to approximately 10nm. Manoeuvre
     your aircraft to bring the target reasonable central your weapon.
     n.b. Selecting and designating a target on your ground radar will
     not necessarily corrospond with the "pickled" target. Your weapon
     is locked on to the target surrounded by the diamond symbol whereas








     you may have designated a different target for tracking purposes
     on your radar. The LOCK and IN RNG discretes will refer to the rader-
     tracked target only. To summeraise:

     1.Approach the target area, preferably with your Up Front Control
     Panel in Waypoint mode. The enemy may detect your approach if you use
     your ground radar.

     2.Have the AGM-65D already armed, with an MFD in "thermal image" mode.

     3.As soon as you identify a hostile "hot" target, pickle the weapon
     to lock on and Fire!

     4.Repeat step 3 during your approach but do not stay immiediately
     over the target area - you will be less vulnerable if you fly out
     and then make a second pass.

     5.Once launched, the missile is self-guided.

     The AGM-65E version uses the tri-service laser tracker, allowing target
     designation by ground infantry, another aircraft carrying the weapon.
     The missile effectively rides a laser beam reflected from the chosen
     target, making it more accurate and elss susceptable to countermeasures
     than its infra-red equivalent. The missile's biggest advantage however
     is not being restricted to "hot" targets. In the absence of the LANTIRN
     you will be relying upon ground infantry to illuminate the target using
     their portal ILS-NT200.

     Operation is similar to the AGM-65S but lock-on is automatic once the
     weapon detects an illuminated target. This will be confirmed by the
     diamond tracking symbol appearing on your HUD.

     Advantages include not having to picle the target manually and knowing
     immediately that the acquired target is hostile. You do not however get
     a thermal image of the target. Without LANTIRN your effective range is
     approximately 3 miles.

     Now, adding LANTIRN starts a whole new ball game. As well as providing
     a night vision capability, LANTIRN allows you to identify and designate
     targets via your ground radar, both manually and automatically.

     The targetting pod contains both infra-red and laser target designators,
     allowing the system to be used with both types of Maverick. The infra-
     red type however is still restricted to "hot" targets. Having armed the
     required weapon (AGM65D or AGM65E) and comfirmed that the LANTIRN pod
     is active (see UFCP) select your ground radar on one MFD and "thermal
     mode" on another. LANTIRN will now automatically scan for hostile
     targets and designate the "most appropriate" on your ground radar
     display. You may of course manuallly override this and designate a
     different target. Range and bearing will be displayed on the HUD as
     usual, together with nthe target designator box overlaying the target
     which will initially be beyond visual range. Weapon lock-on is
     confirmed with the tracking diamond. After firing your weapon, LANTIRN
     will lock on immediately to its next prioritised target, leaving you
     ready to release another weapon. You will soon appreciate the enormous
     advantages of automatic target recognition and when you see how many
     targets can be destroyed on a single pass. Your effective range is now
     that of the missile - approximately 11 miles!









      To summarise, LANTIRN gives you automatic target recognition and
     selection from a much greater stand-off range - for both infra-red and
     laser guided Mavericks - together with night vision. Take it if you can
     get it!

      Unguided ordnance
     n.b. Bombs may not be released at roll angles greater then 60degs.

      Durandal
      By far the most effective weapon for putting runways out of action,
     the "concrete dibber" is an unguided bomb incorporating brake chute and
     internal rocket motor (see chapter 8 for further details). Selecting
     this weapon puts the HUD into CCIP mode (Continuously Computed Impact
     Point) and is confirmed by the discrete DUR.

      Release the weapon when the aiming reticle is over the desired point
     of impact, preferably at the intersection of two runways. Although this
     sounds simple, the best technique of bomb release requires a fair
     amount of practice:

      1. Approach the airfield at approximately 500 kts at below 500 feet.

      2. Pull up into a climb, to about 2000 ft.

      3. Roll inverted, pulling the nose down to position the aiming reticle
         at the required impact point.

      4. Roll to level flight ,release weapon, light the afterburners and
         get the hell out of there, releasing chaff and flares as you go.

     MK83 1000LB AND MK84 2000LB BOMBS

     Both types are simple freefall "iron" bombs, capable of giving the enemy
     quite a headache. Again, use CCIP mode on the HUD with a release
     technique as described above.

     MK82 SNAKEYE
     This paritcular freefall bomb is fitted with retarding fins that flick
     open immmediately upon release. Dropped at high speed and low altitude,
     their primary purpose is to "shake off" unwanted purpuing aircraft by
     exploding in their flight path.

     M61A1 CULCAN 20mm CANNONA
     The F-16 reings supreme int hte close-up digfight and this is where your
     choise of weapon wil be the internal 20mm cannon. When seleced, the
     ranging reticle (calibrated 6000 ft) is positioned by the weapon aiming
     computer to show the bullet trajectory.

     Manoeuvre your aircraft to position the reticle over the enemy aircraft
     and getting as close as possible, open fire whit short burst. Range can
     be up to 3000ft but is only really effective up to 1500ft. The motto here
     here is to go in close , and then when you think you are too close, go
     in closer! However, this is easier said than done. At typical combat
     speeds of 450 to 550 kts, things happen VERY fast so you'll have to keep
     your wits about you. A dogfight rarely lasts for more than just a few
     seconds and only one of you is going home.









     Mounted internally on the port side, this six-barrel, high velocity gun
     fires 100 rounds per second. Bearing in mind that you have only 500
     rounds to begin with, its magazine can be emptied in 5 seconds! So, the
     techique is to fire short bursts, and only when the enemy is in your
     sights. This is not a video game!

      Other equipment:

     ATARS -Advanced Tactical Air Reconnaissance System
     This new high tech pod provides near-real-time reconnaissance
     capability. Electro-optical sensors replace conventional photographic
     technology. Images are digitally processed and transmitted back to HQ
     via relay stations for immediate interpretation. Operation is
     straighforward. Simply switch on the pod (confirmed on your UFCP) to
     scan the area beneath, simultaneously transmiting the data back to HQ.
     Remember, however, that any continuous transmitter will eventually
     reveal your position to the enemy. Do not leave the systemon for longer
     than necessary.

     Note: Do NOT jettison an ATARS. This would result in the enemy decoding
     our secure transmission algorithms and stealing the technology.

     EXTERNAL FUEL TANKS
     These may be carried either on the centerline or inner wing pylons.
     Fuel is consumed equally from the external tanks prior to switching
     automatically to the internall supply. See the fuel gauge for
     quantity remaining and the "external tanks empty" light.

     CHAFF & FLARES
     Your F-16 is fitted with internal chaff/flare dispensers (ALE-40).
     The number of chaff and flare cartridges remaining is shown on your
     weapon status display. Unlike your weapons, chaff and flares do not
     have to be selected prior firing.

     Chaff is a simple but effective means of self defence againsf radar-
     guided weapons and tracking stations. Deploy chaff when you see a
     threat appear on your radar Warning Receiver.

     Flares are self-defence decoys used to "fool" infra-red homing
     missiles. Use when you see the AAM or SAM warning on your Threat
     Warning Panel but no indicate on your threat warning reciever. to be
     safe, dispense both chaff and flares and starts to manoeuvre
     aggressively.

     After landing, procees to the nearest hangar where you will be
     met by the ground crew. They'll give you a full damage report later.
     Please observe airfield speed restrictions when taxing.

     So, time to relax a little. Asses the mission. TAC will be waiting to
     give  you a full debriefing.

     For all "primary role" missions, you will be given your Mission
     Effectiveness (ME) ratio and your Kill Ratio (KR) for the particular
     flight. This will not neccessarily agree with your overall (ME) and
     (KR) values which are culminative and recorded in your pilot's log.
     For Operation Conquest your debriefing between flights will include
     information on squadron strength, allied ground forces, and a morale
     assessment.









     DAMAGE REPORT
      Having digested that little lot, it's time to take a look at the
     damage report. Your ground crew will give you a report on major
     component status and will do their best to get your bird back into
     shape as soon as you initiate repairs. If all systems are not available
     your only option is to try another airfield. Who said life was perfect?

      If you are in the middle of OPERATION CONQUEST and fatigue is setting
     in, select the "R & R" option to take some well-earned leave. After a
     couple of days rest you'll be able to continue with the campaign by
     selecting the "OPERATION Conquest - Restore" option in the squadron
     crewroom.

      Finally, if you have just returned from a successful OPERATION
     CONQUEST, TAC will offer you a voluntary transfer to a new squadron of
     higher status. The choice is yours. Completion of OPERATION CONQUEST in
     the top level squadron takes a very special kind of pilot. Few have
     achieved this distinction and been awarded the highest accolade...

     COMBAT MANOEUVRES
     The following combat manoeuvres are categorised as Offensive and
     Defensive, bearing in mind that during a dogfight the situation can
     reverse in seconds with the pursor becomming the pursued.

     OFFENSIVE:

     The Lag Pursuit
      This is a very simple but effective manoeuvre, used to maintain both
     speed advantage and initiative during the attack. Follow your opponent
     as he attempts to break from the attack with a tight turn. By remaining
     on the outside of the turn radius, slightly astern, you can remain
     hidden from his field of view. Be ready for an attempt by your opponent
     to tighten the turn and force you into a spiral dive.

     Offset head-on pass
      Approaching your opponent from head-on, begin by turning slightly to
     create an offset to one side. Follow this by turning sharply towards
     your opponent, passing beneath his flight path as he begins his turn
     towards you. Maintain this high g turn until you complete a full
     circle, finally out-turning your opponent to arrive on his tail.

     Barrel roll attack
      As your opponent attempts to break by turning sharply into the
     directionof the attack, avoid the overshoot by pulling up hard
     and rolling away from the direction of his turn. Continue the barrel
     rolland complete the manoeuvre by pulling in behind your target as your
     direction of turn reverses.

     High speed yo-yo
      If you find yourself closing in too fast and in danger of overshoo-
     ting, the high speed yo-yo can be used to trade off speed for height.
     Begin by pulling up into a climb, rolling on the way up to become
     inverted at the top of the manoeuvre. As you continue with the pull
     through, your speed loss will effectively tighten your turn radius
     allowing you to slide in behind your opponent. The high speed yo-yo is
     a very difficult manoeuvre to execute correctly, with timing and
     technique being critical if you are not to reveal your intentions.









     Low speed yo-yo
      Use this manoeuvre to gain extra speed during the closing stages of
     your attack. Trading height for speed, start by diving inside your
     opponent's turn. Before he counterattacks, pull in behind your target
     by cutting across his turning circle. The desired closing effect may
     not be achieved in one execution, in which case repeat the manoeuvre
     until you are within firing range.

     DEFENSIVE:
     The break
      With the enemy closing at your "six" there's no time to waste. Turn as
     sharply as you can into the direction of the attack thereby creating
     the quickest "angle-off" between yourself and the pursuer. Brief use of
     your airbrake may force your opponent to overshoot, allowing you to
     reverse your turn and move in for the attack. If the enemy is alert,
     this could be the beginning of the scissors manoeuvre.

     The scissors
      Best described as a sequence of turn reversals, the objective is to
     force the enemy to overshoot and leave you in a firing position. With
     closely matched aidcraft (and pilot!) however, the manoeuvre can
     rapidly reach a stalemate with each aircraft gaining only a transient
     advantage. It is strongly recommended that after two reversals some
     alternative manoeuvre be tried such as the spiral dive.

     Spiral dive
      Often used to shake off a pursuing opponent, this manoeuvre begins by
     rolling inverted and pulling into a steep turning dive. As the enemy
     follows you into the spiral, throttle back and extend your airbrake
     thereby forcing him to overshoot. Open throttle again quickly, turn
     towards your opponent and pull up for the attack. This manoeuvre should
     only be attempted at a starting altitude in excess of 15000 feet.

     Split S
      Sometimes known as the Half Roll, this manoeuvre is commonly used to
     disengage from the dogfight. Begin by rolling your aircraft inverted
     and pulling into a vertical dive. Continuing the pull will bring you
     out on a heading opposite to that of your opponent.

     Immelmann turn
      Used primarily for repositioning prior to attack, the Immelmann turn
     uses the vertical plane to change the direction of flight. Open full
     throttle and pull into a vertical climb. During the ascent roll your
     aircraft in preparation for a "roll off the top" onto your new heading.
      All of the above manoeuvres are common and well documented. In close
     combat however it often pays to not be too predictable!

     Chapter 6    GROUND SCHOOL

     Your Aircraft
      Flying your F-16 is identical, in principle, to flying any other
     fixed-wing fighter. However, the F-16 was the first aircraft to be
     designed, from scratch, utilising the benefits of "fly-by-wire"
     technology. On-board computers automatically ensure that the pilot
     cannot overstress the airframe or execute a manoeuvre that would lead
     to a dangerous flight condition e.g. spin. Exceptional handling
     qualities and the application of advanced control techniques combine to








     give a superbly agile aircraft that can be flown aggressively and with
     confidence.

     Aircraft Controls
      To begin with the controls, your inputs are made via the sidestick
     controller (the F-16's equivalent to a control column) and the rudder
     pedals. Unlike conventional controls, hand and foot movement is
     minimal, the controlling factor being the force applied. Your inputs
     are measured by miniature force transducers linked to the computers of
     the quadrplex fly-by-wire control system. Here your demands are "inter-
     preted" and summed with a complex formula of stabilising criteria
     before finally signalling the control surfaces electronically. The F-16
     contains no mechanical links between you and your airframe. The remark-
     able agility of this "electric jet" is achieved by designing an
     aerodynamically unstable aircraft and then using the fly-by-wire system
     to make it flyable. This involves dozens of minute adjustments to the
     control surfaces being made automatically every second!

     Let's take a look at the control surfaces:

     FLAPERONS - a control surface with the combined function of flaps and
     ailerons. Pressing left or right on your sidestick will drive these
     surfaces differentially (one up, one down) and your aircraft will roll
     in the appropriate direction. Relative to you, of course, it appears
     that the horizon rolls in the opposite direction.
      The flaperons are also driven automatically. By changing the camber of
     the wing very rapidly, the fly-by-wire control system can optimize the
     wing shape for maximum wing efficiency, stability and control.

     TAILPLANE - unlike conventional elevators, modern jet fighters use an
     "all flying" tailplane whereby the whole surface rotates. Pulling back
     on the sidestick moves both tailplane surfaces in unison, the effect
     being to pitch the nose of the aircraft upwards. Pushing on the
     sidestick has the opposite effect. At high speeds, the tailplane is
     used for roll control by driving the surfaces differentially in
     response to lateral pressure on the sidestick.

     RUDDER - The automatic coordination of controls make use of the rudder
     pedals rare, except perhaps for fine heading adjustment during fianal
     approach. In fact, during extreme manoeuvres, the rudder is locked out.
     AIRBRAKE- Situated either side of the tailpipe, this control is an
     efficient means of reducing airspeed quickly. The brake returns to its
     closed position on release.

     Appendix 1 ONE-ON-ONE COMMUNICATIONS

     Software
      Selecting GLADIATOR will lead you to the communications set-up screen.
     Ensure that BOTH computers are assigned the SAME baud rate. Choose
     which pilot will be RED LEADER and BLUE LEADER (must not be the same on
     both computers). Select TAKE-OFF to start mission.
      Pressing HOLD on either computer will freeze BOTH aircraft. The
     mission is resumed by pressing Continue on the same computer. Pressing
     Quit on either computer will abort the mission and return both pilots
     to the debriefing room.
      The simulation will run at the speed of the slowest computer, with
     adjustments made automatically to maintain real-time.
