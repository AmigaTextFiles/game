                        CHAMPIONSHIP BASEBALL:

Typed in by COUNT ZERO. Edited by Parasite.


STARTING THE GAME:
   To play a one-player game, use a joystick plugged into the second port.
   To play two-player, you have to use two joysticks.

WHEN YOU'RE UP TO BAT:
   To swing at the ball, just hit the joystick button.  Depending on the "B"
   statistic of your player (batting average) the batter will either make a
   good or bad swing.  You only have to worry about timing and make sure
   that what you're swinging at is over the plate.
   Once you get on base (you push right to run to first base) you can keep
   going by continuing to push right or stop and go back by pushing left.
   You can also steal bases this way when ANYONE has the ball.

WHEN YOU'RE IN THE FIELD:
   The player who is black (highlighted) is the one currently with the ball.
   To throw the ball to a baseman, press the button, release it, and then
   move the joystick in the direction of the base.  That is, wherever you
   are and whoever you are controlling, to throw it to second base:  Press
   the button, release, then push right.  To throw to home, push left, third
   up, first down, etc.  To throw it to the pitcher, press the button twice
   in succesion.  Once the pitcher has the ball and you want to pitch ( the
   pitcher is highlighted), press the button and hold it down.  The pitcher
   will wind up and prepare to throw.  With the button still held down, just
   move the joystick in 1 of the 8 directions for a type of pitch.  Down is
   ball outside, up is a ball inside, left is a fast ball, and right is
   normal.  The diagonals are a combination of the previous throws.  After
   the ball is thrown though, moving up and down let the pitcher control
   some of the curve on the ball.
