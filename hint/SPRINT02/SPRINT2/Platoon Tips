     Type "HAMBURGER" in the high score window.  The F1 thru F4 keys will then
     move you to that level.

     JUNGLE:
     You can memorize the route through the jungle.

     If you are in the jungle and hear a shot, jump fast. You are being shot at
     from off screen.  You can kill the underground snipers by using grenades,
     better yet, just jump over them.  Another idea is to shoot three or four
     shots when changing screens, just in case.

     BRIDGE:
     When you have placed the explosives on the bridge, wait beside the second
     bridge and shoot any enemy that pops up.  A package will be deposited and
     if you get it, a hit point will be removed from you and your morale will go
     up.

     VILLAGE:
     Ignore the first three huts.  Go into the fourth hut and kill the soldier
     hiding there.  Search to the right side of the sack of rice and you will
     find a trapdoor.  Go down to the TUNNEL.

     TUNNEL:
     Keep an eye on the map and use it!  The top left room contains the Captain
     you will want to kill him and get the flairs.  Then exit at the lower right
     side.  Keep shooting but in short bursts.  Ammo is very hard to find here.
     Keep moving!

     BUNKER:
     Throw a flare and start shooting the enemy.  Use the flares as much as
     possible, and watch the waste of bullets.

     JUNGLE2:
     Shoot, shoot, shoot.  Time is short, the easiest route out is go left and
     right alternately.

     SGT BARNES:
     Get the box, avoid the sergeant.  Best to keep throwing grenades and start
     moving in closer.
