          MAKE HASTE NOW, FOR THE DIABOLICAL PLAN HATCHED BY CHAOS HAS
          ALREADY BEEN SET IN MOTION. UNLESS YOU CAN RECOVER AND DESTROY THE
          CORBUMS QUICKLY, THEY WILL ABSORB ENOUGH MANA TO BECOME
          UNSTABLE. VIBORG AND THE ENTIRE VALLEY IT RESTS IN WILL BE
          DESTROYED SHOULD THEY EXPLODE.

          TO PREPARE FOR YOUR QUEST, YOU SHOULD HAVE PROGRESSED FAR ENOUGH IN
          DUNGEON MASTER THAT YOU ARE CONFIDENT OF YOUR ABILITIES. BE
          CAREFUL, FOR YOUR CHAMPIONS WILL ENTER THE NEW DUNGEON CHAOS HAS
          BUILT WITH NOTHING BUT THEIR SKILLS AND ATTRIBUTES TO DEFEND
          THEM. ONCE INSIDE, THEY MUST TRAVEL AS FIGHTER, NINJA, WIZARD AND
          PRIEST TO RECOVER THE CORBUMS HIDDEN ON THE WAYS. EACH CORBUM THEY
          FIND MUST BE THROWN INTO THE "FUL YA" PIT TO BE SAFELY CONSUMED.
          THE JOURNEY IS LONG AND DANGEROUS, SO YOUR CHAMPIONS WILL BE TRULY
          TESTED. ONLY WHEN THE LAST CORBUM IS SAFELY DESTROYED WILL THE
          DANGER BE NO MORE THAN A MEMORY.

          GETTING STARTED
          TWO DISKS ARE PROVIDED WITH "CHAOS STRIKES BACK", THE UTILITY DISK
          AND THE GAME DISK. THE CHAOS STRIKES BACK GAME DISK WORKS VERY
          MUCH LIKE THE ORIGINAL "DUNGEON MASTER" DISK. YOU SHOULD REFER TO
          THE ORIGINAL DUNGEON MASTER MANUAL (OR SEWER RATS DOC DISKS 1 & 6)
          IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE GAME DISK. THE UTILITY DISK
          INCLUDES MANY NEW FEATURES AND IS ESSENTIAL TO STARTING THE NEW
          ADVENTURE.

          TWO ADDITIONAL DISKS ARE NEEDED TO CREATE A NEW ADVENTURE. YOU
          MUST HAVE EITHER A "DUNGEON MASTER" SAVED GAME OR A SAVED GAME
          FROM CHAOS STRIKES BACK "PRISON". LATER,YOU WILL NEED A BLANK DISK
          TO SAVE YOUR NEW ADVENTURE ON.

          THERE ARE TWO WAYS TO GET A SAVED GAME. THE EASIEST WAY IS TO
          START THE GAME DISK AND CHOOSE THE "PRISON"  BUTTON OUTSIDE THE
          DUNGEON ENTRANCE. THIS ALLOWS YOU TO ENTER THE DUNGEON AND SELECT
          UP TO FOUR CHAMPIONS FROM THE LIFE TRAPPING MIRRORS HUNG
          THERE. AFTER CHOOSING YOU ADVENTURES, SAVE THE GAME AS YOU DID
          WHILE PLAYING "DUNGEON MASTER". (See DUNGEON MASTER docs.)

          THE SECOND SOURCE OF A SAVED GAME IS TO PLAY "DUNGEON
          MASTER". ANY "DUNGEON MASTER" SAVED GAME CAN BE USED. BUT BE
          FOREWARNED: IT WILL NOT BE EASY TO SURVIVE THE CHALLENGES IN
          "CHAOS STRIKES BACK", SO IT IS SUGGESTED THAT YOU USE A SAVED GAME
          IN WHICH THE CHARACTERS HAVE FOUGHT DEEP ENOUGH IN "DUNGEON
          MASTER" TO HAVE SEEN CHAOS HIMSELF.

          ONCE YOU HAVE A SAVED GAME AND ONE BLANK DISK HANDY, YOU ARE
          READY TO MAKE YOUR NEW ADVENTURE. INSERT THE UTILITY DISK INTO THE
          STARTUP DRIVE AND TURN THE COMPUTER ON. A BLUE TABLET WILL APPEAR
          WITH FOUR OPTIONS ON IT. USE THE MOUSE POINTER TO POINT TO ONE OF
          THE OPTIONS THEN "SELECT" IT BY PRESSING THE MOUSE BUTTON. THE
          OPTIONS ARE EXPLAINED BELOW.









          INTRODUCTION TO CHAOS STRIKES BACK:
          A VISION SPELL IS CAST AND CHAOS IS CAUGHT PLOTTING.

          MAKE NEW ADVENTURE OR EDIT CHAMPION PICTURES:
          THIS OPTION IS ESSENTIAL TO BEGIN THE NEW ADVENTURE. IT ALSO
          ALLOWS YOU TO CHANGE YOUR CHAMPIONS' PORTRAITS.

          CONSULT THE HINT ORACLE:
          SELECT THIS WHEN YOU NEED HELP WITH THE GAME.

          RESTART SYSTEM:
          THIS WILL EXIT THE UTILITY DISK AND RESTART THE SYSTEM.

          MAKING A NEW ADVENTURE.
          FROM THE BLUE TABLET OF THE UTILITY DISK, SELECT THE "MAKE NEW"
          ADVENTURE OPTION. YOU WILL BE ASKED FOR YOUR SAVED GAME DISK. THE
          CHAMPIONS ON THE SAVED GAME WILL BE READ IN AND THEIR PORTRAITS
          DISPLAYED ACROSS THE TOP. ONE OF THESE CHAMPIONS WILL ALREADY BE
          SELECTED FOR EDITING. THE CHAMPIONS FULL NAME, A FRAMED HALL OF
          CHAMPIONS MIRROR, AND A TRIPLE-SIZED VERSION OF THEIR PORTRAIT
          WILL BE SHOWN.

          IF YOU WISH TO TAKE YOUR CHAMPIONS INTO "CHAOS STRIKES BACK" JUST
          AS THEY APPEAR, SELECT THE OPTION "MAKE NEW ADVENTURE". THE UTILITY
          DISK WILL ASK FOR A BLANK DISK TO BE PUT IN EITHER THE STARTUP OR
          SECOND DRIVE. IF THE BLANK USED IS NOT FORMATTED, CHOOSE "FORMAT"
          FIRST. "FORMAT" WILL ERASE EVERYTHING ON THE DISK, SO BE CAREFUL
          NOT TO USE YOUR "DUNGEON MASTER" SAVED GAME. WHEN THE DISK HAS
          FINISHED FORMATTING, OR IF IT WAS ALREADY FORMATTED, CHOOSE "MAKE
          NEW ADVENTURE" IN THE CENTRE BOX. WHEN THE PROGRAM IS DONE MAKING
          THE NEW ADVENTURE, REMOVE THE DISK AND LABEL IT "CHAOS STRIKES
          BACK SAVED GAME". THIS DISK CAN NOW BE PLAYED USING THE "CHAOS
          STRIKES BACK" GAME DISK.

          RESUME.
          AFTER YOU HAVE CREATED THE "CHAOS STRIKES BACK" SAVED GAME YOU
          ARE READY TO START THE NEW ADVENTURE. TO PLAY, INSERT THE "CHAOS
          STRIKES BACK GAME DISK" IN THE STARTUP DRIVE AND TURN THE
          COMPUTER ON. WHEN YOU SEE THE DUNGEON ENTRANCE PUSH THE GEM NEXT
          TO "RESUME". WHEN "CHAOS STRIKES BACK" ASKS YOU FOR THE SAVED
          GAME, USE THE NEW "CHAOS STRIKES BACK" SAVED GAME DISK INSTEAD OF
          A "DUNGEON MASTER" SAVED GAME DISK. "CHAOS STRIKES BACK" WILL ONLY
          WORK WITH A SAVED GAME CREATED USING "MAKE NEW ADVENTURE". IT IS
          IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT DURING THE TRANSITION FROM EITHER OF THE
          SAVED GAME SOURCES TO THE "NEW ADVENTURE", YOUR CHAMPIONS
          WERE STRIPPED OF ALL THEIR POSSESSIONS. THEY WILL ENTER THE NEW
          GAME WITH NOTHING BUT THEIR SKILLS AND ATTRIBUTES TO DEFEND
          THEM. BE READY WHEN THE GAME STARTS BECAUSE CHAOS HAS BEEN
          PREPARING FOR YOUR ARRIVAL.

          THE HINT ORACLE
          SOMETIMES IT MAY SEEM THAT THERE IS LITTLE YOU CAN DO TO DEFEAT
          CHAOS' SINISTER TRAPS AND RELENTLESS MINIONS. BUT A NEW POWER IS
          YOURS FOR THE JOURNEY INTO HIS DUNGEON:A POWER CHAOS HAS NOT SEEN
          BEFORE - THE POWER OF THE "HINT ORACLE". A BEING  OF AWESOME
          ABILITY, THE ORACLE CAN REACH INTO A "CHAOS STRIKES BACK" SAVED
          GAME AND LEARN WHERE THE CHAMPIONS ARE. IT CAN THEN TELL YOU WHAT
          IT KNOWS ABOUT THE DUNGEON NEAR THE CHAMPIONS, INCLUDING








          INFORMATION ABOUT MONSTERS OR PUZZLES. ALTHOUGH IT WILL RARELY
          GIVE EXACT SOLUTIONS, IT CAN HOWEVER GIVE USEFUL HINTS AND ENOUGH
          INFORMATION TO HELP SOLVE A PROBLEM. THIS CAN PROVE INVALUABLE AT
          TIMES WHEN THE PUZZLES SEEM TOO DIFFICULT OR THE MONSTERS TOO
          POWERFUL.

          THE HINT ORACLE ONLY WORKS IN THE "CHAOS STRIKES BACK" DUNGEON.
          TO CONSULT THE HINT ORACLE YOU MUST TRAVEL TO A POINT CLOSE TO
          THE PART OF THE DUNGEON YOU WISH TO LEARN MORE ABOUT. SAVE THE
          GAME AND QUIT. TURN OFF THE COMPUTER AND INSERT THE UTILITY DISK
          IN THE STARTUP DRIVE, AND TURN THE COMPUTER BACK ON. WHEN THE BLUE
          TABLET APPEARS, SELECT "CONSULT THE HINT ORACLE". AFTER THE LAIR OF
          THE HINT ORACLE APPEARS, INSERT THE SAVED GAME DISK IN THE DRIVE
          INDICATED ON THE SCREEN AND CHOOSE "LOAD".

          WHEN THE ORACLE HAS LEARNED WHERE THE CHAMPIONS ARE IN THE
          DUNGEON, IT WILL SHOW A LIST OF CLUES IT CAN GIVE ABOUT THAT
          LOCATION. THESE APPEAR IN THE HINT ORACLES LAIR AS GLOWING BUTTONS
          WITH A SHORT TITLE WRITTEN ON THEM. IF ANY OF THE CLUE TITLES SEEM
          LIKE THEY MIGHT HAVE A HINT THAT CAN HELP ANSWER YOUR
          QUESTION, THEN USE THE MOUSE POINTER TO SELECT IT. A PRESS OF THE
          MOUSE BUTTON AND THE FIRST LEVEL OF HINT WILL APPEAR. THERE MIGHT
          BE MORE DETAILED LEVELS OF HINTS FOR ANY CLUE BUTTON. IF THERE ARE
          MORE LEVELS IN A HINT YOU CAN SEE THEM BY CHOOSING "NEXT" AT THE
          BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN. IF YOU WISH TO RE-READ A PREVIOUS LEVEL OF
          HINT, CHOOSE "LAST" TO BACK UP ONE LEVEL. IF YOU ARE IN A CLUE AND
          YOU WISH TO TRY A DIFFERENT CLUE, CHOOSE "DONE" TO RETURN TO THE
          INITIAL LIST OF CLUES.

          WHEN YOU HAVE FINISHED WITH THE HINT ORACLE, RETURN TO THE INITIAL
          LIST OF CLUES BY CHOOSING "DONE". CHOOSE EXIT FROM THERE TO
          RETURN TO THE BLUE TABLET. IF YOU WISH TO CONTINUE THE ADVENTURE,
          PLACE THE GAME DISK IN THE STARTUP DRIVE AND CHOOSE THE RESTART
          OPTION.

          THE PORTRAIT PAINTER
          A SPECIAL FEATURE INCLUDED WITH THE "CHAOS STRIKES BACK"
          UTILITY DISK IS THE ABILITY TO EDIT THE PORTRAITS AND NAMES OF
          THE CHAMPIONS BROUGHT IN FROM A DUNGEON MASTER SAVED GAME. NOW YOU
          CAN PERSONALISE YOUR CHAMPIONS TO REFLECT THE WAY YOU SEE THEM. IN
          ADDITION, ANY PORTRAITS YOU CREATE CAN BE SAVED TO AN UNUSED DISK
          AND LATER LOADED IN FOR FURTHER EDITING OR FOR USE IN OTHER SAVED
          GAMES. TO USE THE PORTRAIT PAINTER, SELECT "MAKE NEW ADVENTURE OR
          EDIT CHAMPIONS" AND THE EDITOR WILL APPEAR.
          USE THE MOUSE POINTER TO SELECT THE CHAMPION YOU WISH TO
          EDIT. CHOOSE FROM THE CHAMPIONS SHOWN AT THE TOP OF THE SCREEN.

          LOAD CHAMPION
          WHEN THE "CHAOS STRIKES BACK" UTILITY DISK IS FIRST STARTED IT
          WILL REQUEST A "DUNGEON MASTER" SAVED GAME. WHEN LOADED,THE
          CHAMPIONS IN THAT SAVED GAME APPEAR ACROSS THE TOP OF THE
          SCREEN. THE PORTRAITS OF THESE CHAMPIONS CAN NOW BE CHANGED. IF YOU
          WISH TO WORK ON A DIFFERENT SAVED GAME OR CHANGE PORTRAITS THAT
          HAVE BEEN SAVED SEPARATELY, USE "LOAD CHAMPIONS" BUTTON. THIS WILL
          GIVE YOU A CHOICE OF LOADING EITHER A "DUNGEON MASTER" SAVED GAME
          OR A PORTRAIT. PORTRAITS ARE CREATED BY SAVING A FINISHED CHAMPION
          PORTRAIT WITH THE "SAVE CHAMPION" BUTTON. BE CAREFUL WHEN LOADING
          PORTRAITS BECAUSE THE CURRENT PORTRAIT BEING EDITED WILL BE








          LOST. LOADING A DIFFERENT SAVED GAME WILL ERASE ALL THE CHAMPION
          PORTRAITS ON THE SCREEN.

          HALK----- IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE YOUR CHAMPIONS FIRST NAME,USE THE
          MOUSE POINTER TO POINT TO IT, THEN PRESS THE MOUSE BUTTON.THE NAME
          CAN BE BE CHANGED WHEN THE VERTICAL BAR APPEARS INSIDE THE
          BOX. USE THE "BACKSPACE" AND LETTER KEYS TO EDIT THE NAME. THE
          FIRST NAME IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT IS THE NAME THAT A PORTRAIT
          WILL BE SAVED AS. IMPORTANT: IF YOU WANT TO KEEP THE ORIGINAL
          VERSION OF A PORTRAIT YOU HAVE BEEN WORKING ON, BE SURE TO CHANGE
          THE FIRST NAME OF THE NEW PORTRAIT SO YOU WON'T ERASE THE OLD ONE.

          THE BARBARIAN______    THIS IS THE CHAMPION'S TITLE. IT CAN BE
          CHANGED WITH THE "BACKSPACE" AND LETTER KEYS, THE SAME WAY THAT
          THE FIRST NAME CAN. PREPARE THE TITLE FOR EDITING BY POINTING TO
          IT WITH THE MOUSE BUTTON.

          THE TRIPLE-SIZE VERSION OF THE CHAMPION'S PORTRAIT IS WHERE YOU
          CHANGE YOUR CHAMPION'S APPEARANCE. THE SIXTEEN COLOURS IN THE TALL
          BOX AT THE RIGHT EDGE OF THE SCREEN AND THE AVAILABLE
          COLOURS. WHEN YOU SELECT ONE OF THE COLOURS, A WHITE BOX WILL
          APPEAR AROUND IT. YOU CAN PAINT THIS COLOUR USING THE MOUSE
          POINTER. IF YOU WISH TO CHANGE A LARGE AREA OF ONE COLOUR TO A
          SELECTED COLOUR, PLACE THE ARROW SOMEWHERE IN THIS AREA AND DOUBLE
          CLICK OR USE THE MOUSE BUTTON TO "FILL" THIS AREA WITH THE NEW
          COLOUR.

          UNDO
          IF YOU MAKE A MISTAKE WHILE PAINTING YOUR PORTRAIT, PRESS
          THE "UNDO" BUTTON WITH THE MOUSE BUTTON AND THE LAST THING YOU
          DID WILL BE REMOVED, AND THE PORTRAIT RESTORED TO THE STATE IT WAS
          BEFORE THE ERROR.

          REVERT
          IF YOU HAVE MADE MANY CHANGES, BUT WISH TO RETURN TO THE
          ORIGINAL PORTRAIT, PRESS ON THE REVERT BUTTON AND THE ENTIRE
          PORTRAIT WILL APPEAR AS IT WAS WHEN FIRST LOADED FROM THE DISK. IF
          REVERT WAS A MISTAKE, TRY UNDO.

          SAVE CHAMPION
          AFTER YOU ARE SATISFIED WITH THE NAME AND PORTRAIT
          YOU HAVE CREATED, SELECT "SAVE CHAMPION" AT THE BOTTOM OF THE
          SCREEN. THIS ALLOWS YOU TO SAVE A PORTRAIT TO AN UNUSED DISK.
          SAVED PORTRAITS CAN BE FURTHER USING "LOAD CHAMPIONS",
          THEN SELECTING "PORTRAITS".

                    THE PORTRAIT IN THE FRAME SHOWS THE CHARACTER AS THEY
          WOULD APPEAR IN ONE OF THE HALL OF CHAMPIONS MIRRORS. NOTE THAT
          MEDIUM DARK GRAY IS TRANSPARENT WHEN THE PORTRAIT IS SHOWN HERE,
          SO THE COLOUR OF THE MIRROR SHOWS THROUGH WHEREVER IT IS USED.
          THIS DOES NOT AFFECT MOST PLACES A CHAMPION IS CURRENTLY SHOWN,
          BUT IT MAY BE IMPORTANT IN FUTURE QUESTS, SO BE AWARE OF THIS.

                   IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO PAINT PORTRAITS BUT STILL WANT TO
          CHANGE YOUR CHAMPION'S APPEARANCE TO REFLECT THEIR HIGHER
          LEVELS, "ENHANCED" CHAMPION PORTRAITS HAVE BEEN PROVIDED. ALL
          TWENTY-FOUR DUNGEON MASTER CHAMPIONS HAVE A NEW PORTRAIT ON THE
          CHAOS STRIKES BACK UTILITY DISK. THESE CAN BE LOADED AND USED








          THROUGH THE " LOAD CHAMPION " OPTION AS DESCRIBED ABOVE.
