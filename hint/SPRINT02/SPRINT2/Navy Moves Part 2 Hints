     END TRANSMIT RISE, SURFACE, EMERGE OPEN DOOR, OPEN LATCH, OPEN WALL STOP
     MACHINES, STOP MOTORS, STOP ENGINES, STOP MOTOR MISSILES LIST

     THAT'S IT, THE PLAY IS TO KILL ALL CAPTAINS AND SEARCH THEIR BODIES TO FIND
     ALL THE CODEWORDS THAT YOU'LL NEED TO :
     1-STOP THE ENGINES
     2-RISE TO THE SURFACE
     3-CALL HELP
     4-ARM THE BOMB

     I NEVER FOUND THE TERMINAL TO CALL HELP BUT I MADE ALL THE REST AND I BLEW
     WITH THE SUB.
