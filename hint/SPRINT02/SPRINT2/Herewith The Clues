     All by PARASITE of SPRINT. I hope these help.


     Here is a brief coverage of these docs, from memory, as I read them in
     my local computer shop.

     The docs would only cover about 4K, they are a brief background,
     telling that this idea was origianally released in 1939 (I think!) in
     a book format, with the solution sealed in an envelope, which was
     opened when you had deduced who the killer was. Unfortianally, now you
     have to send your solution to the programming house on the included
     postcard, and they will reply, telling you if you got it right, and
     sending you a full solution. Is this the best form of protection
     yet???. The actual pictures in the game are the same ones from the
     1939 issue.

     The docs dont cover gameplay at all, apart from the line WHO KILLED
     SERGE ORLOFF, which you have to deduce, and to click with your left
     mouse button on things. (Try the cup of tea!).
