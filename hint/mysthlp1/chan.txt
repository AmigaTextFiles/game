             THIS IS A WALKTHROUGH-YOU WILL GET DIRECT ANSWERS

Turning on the power around here

     This world is powered by windmill energy and water. So, before we can
do anything, we need to hook everything up right in the windmill. To get
there,follow these directions: (f=forward, l=left, etc.)
                        F,F,F,FL,F,FR,F,FL,F,F,F,F
     If you look down here, you will see a switch, much like the switches
controlling train tracks. Water (which=energy) can only flow to some places
at some times. We will have to throw the switches correctly in order to
power the things we need in this world. We will use this particular switch
as a reference point. I'll refer to it from now on as the starting switch.
Looking forward, you will see the windmill. Go inside, so we can power up!
There should be a faucet handle at your feet. Turning it will start water
flowing. Energy will now start flowing on Channelwood.
     HINT: You will be able to hear running water when you are standing on
top pipe that has water flowing through it.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Getting to the Elevator

     Go back outside the windmill to the starting switch. Look down at the
switch, and make sure that the water is flowing to the left. We can't get
to the stairs yet (which we will need) Go: Forward-left, Forward, Forward ,
Forward and check the switch. The water should be going to the right.
Foward-right, Forward and check this switch. Water should be going right.
Forward-right, Forward and check this switch. Water should be going right.
Go Forward-right, Forward, Forward, Forward. A motor will be running. Open
the elevator door and get in. Throw the handle and take off!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Navigating the second Floor

     NOTE: THIS IS TOUGH TO FOLLOW. Go: Forward, Forward-right,
Forward-right, Forward, Forward, Right, Forward, Forward, Forward. From
this room (lots of pots laying around) go Right, Forward, Forward, Forward,
Forward. Throw the Switch. In the distance you'll see something moving.
That's where we need to get to. Turn around 180 degrees. Go Forward,
Forward, Forward, Forward. From this room (again!), go Right, Forward,
Forward, Forward-right, Forward six times, Right, Forward, Forward,
Forward, forward down the stairs. Open the door. Go forward five times.
We're back at the started switch. Change the water to go toward the stairs
(right). Go left, and then forward six times. Climb the stairs, turn left,
and there's the elevator. Flip the switch-it'll take us to the third floor.
Get out on the third floor.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The top floor

     Turn around 180 degrees. Go Forward-right, Forward, Forward, Forward.
This is a bedroom of some sort. There is a night stand in the room with
drawers. Go to is. The Red Page is in the left side. On the right side,
you'll find half of a white note-this is a Vault note. COPY THE INFORMATION
DOWN. IT IS VERY IMPORTANT!!! This is one half of a note, with the other
half in Stoneship. Leave the room and go forward four times, forward-right,
and then forward again four times. This room has some smoke and mirrors,
but we're on our way out! Leave by going out the opposite door you came in.
Go right, forward, forward, forward-left and forward. Enter this room to
find the blue note! There are some messages in this room using the machine.
They are not that important. Go out of the room and go forward twice,
forward-right. Get back to the elevator. Throwing the switch will get you
to the second floor. Go down the stairs.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Going back to Cali---I mean MYST

     Start from the starting switch. Change the switch to the left. Go
forward-left, forward, forward, forward. Change this switch so the water
goes right. Go forward-right, and forward. At this switch, make sure the
water is going left. We'll go forward-left and forward. Go left with the
water forward-left and forward get's you to a bunch of forwards until you
see and engine/pump lookin' thing at the end of the path. Forward-right,
forward, Forward, forward. Flip the switch and watch a magic bridge appear!
Follow the path forward until the elevator. Turn around and trace the pipe
left, until it runs out. Find the crank here and crank it, the pipe will
extend. Turn around, head towards the elevator, but go past it back to the
bridge motor/pump. From here, go forward, forward, forward, and
forward-left. Go forward, forward-right, forward, look down. Throw the
switch to the other side. Turn left. and go to the next switch. The water
should be flowing beneath your feet. Turn around, go forward, Right,
forward, Forward-left, Forward, Forward-right, and a ton forwards until you
reach the elevator. Get in. shut the door and throw the lever. Open the
door and you'll see the MYST book!
