                              Myst Island Help

                                  [Image]

             THIS IS A WALKTHROUGH-YOU WILL GET DIRECT ANSWERS

     There are several way to finish MYST. The easiest is to first
understand MYST Island, and then go to each Age as you discover it. You can
complete MYST in any order. The order that follows is arranged this way
just for my convenience in explaining. You can do things in any order!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

First things first-What's with this note?

Two Notes:
     1. This note step is not vital to finishing MYST.
     2. You should first go around the Island and flip all the "marker
switches that you see. (There are 7 you can switch and 1 on the clock tower
that you can't. There are 8 all together).

     As you entered MYST, you may have noticed a "hidden" door that leads
down some steps into a room with a fountain or pool. Go in it and drain the
water from it by pushing the button in front. Then turn around. You will
see a scrap of paper on the wall. On this piece of paper are three things
with three numbers. You can ignore them. Click on the paper. It opens and
shows two numbers. Enter the number of Marker Switches--8. Turn back around
and click the button on the pool (known as the "imager"). You will see a
message that Atrus left for his wife, Catherine, telling her of his
problem. You can deduce from his message that your task is to figure out
which of his sons is guilty.

Using the Library

     There is a bookshelf with some ratty looking books. Find it. There
will be 4 legible books. Read them carefully and draw out any drawing you
see in them (Except for the book with only puzzle clues) Pay attention,
there is some good information in those books that will help later. Then,
find the red and blue books. There are pages laying next to each one. Put
the red and blue pages in the respective books. click on the book, and you
will see a message from each of of Atrus's sons, Sirrus and Achenar. They
both tell you to find the red and blue pages to set them free. This is the
point of MYST, so listen carefully. In each of the four Ages (worlds) there
is both a red and a blue page. You should get them both (since you can only
carry one page at a time, you'll have to go twice to each Age). Next, to
get the clues you'll need, click on the map. It should have white outlines
of where you have flipped markers. Start the tower rotation by holding down
of where you have flipped markers. Start the tower rotation by holding down
the tower and watching it rotate. You'll see that when it passes    [Image]
some areas, the beam turns red. Stop on the red spots! This tells
you a book that leads to another Age is stored there. (Atrus calls them the
"places of protection") Click on the painting that makes the bookcase drop.
Follow the tunnel and elevator to the top of the tower. There will be two
ladders. One with a book and one with a key. The book ladder shows you
where the book is, and the key that you will need to solve the puzzle that
leads you there. What follows are explanations to each puzzle that take you
to each Age.

Solving the Tree Puzzle--getting to Channelwood!

     This one is the hardest to figure out, I think, if you don't know
what's going on. The clue for this puzzle is 7,2,4. Inside of the cabin,
there is a safe right beside by the door. 7,2,4 is the combination that you
should use to open it. There is a a match in it. Light the match, turn
around, and go to the boiler. Put the match in the slot in the bottom
left-hand corner. Crank the handle with the GREEN arrows. Go until you
start to hear a loud sound. Wait until it stops, then crank the wheel back
the other way with the RED arrows. Go again until you hear a loud sound. Go
quickly behind the cabin. You should see an opening in the tree coming down
at you. Climb in the opening. It will take you down. Click on the book, and
go to the Channelwood Age!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The puzzle of the sunken ship

     The clues from the tower rotation are: October 11, 1984 10:04 AM,
January 17, 1207 5:46AM, and November 23, 9791 6:57 PM. Go back to the
planetarium and turn the lights off. Sit in the chair and look up. Enter
the dates into the machine. You will see three different constallations.
These will look familiar if you copied down the constellations written in
the books in the Library. These constellations are matched up with symbols.
They are Leaf, Snake, Bug. If you go back to the tiny sunken ship in the
pool, you will notice pillars with animals and symbols on them. click on
the pictures on the pillars next to the pool. The tiny ship will rise in
the pool and the big one will also rise in the harbor. Go down to the
harbor, go into the cabin. Click on the book, and go to the Stoneship Age!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Golem in the Gears (Gear Puzzle)

     The gears are actually opened up by solving the puzzle at the  [Image]
clock tower, which is in the water. By turning the two wheels or
valves on the shore, you can change the time of the clock. Set the time for
2:40. A bridge will appear from the water. When you get into the clock
tower, there is a game like a slot machine. You have to crank right, left,
right and quickly pull while the wheels are still is going, so that only
the top row moves to get 2,2,1. PC users can also use right-click to stop
the wheel ( At least in win95 you can). Return to the gears, a trap door
will open, exposing a book, click on it, and go to the Mechanical Age!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Solving the Spaceship Puzzle

     The hint from the tower is 59 volts. If you go to the          [Image]
generator room, (it has generators as far as the eye can see and a
yellow light on top of the building). There are 10 buttons that control the
yellow light on top of the building). There are 10 buttons that control the
[Image] power. Each one has a different value. Clicking each one on will
        either add or subtract that value. There are many, many
combinations that will produce "59". There are also handles behind the
generator building that will reset everything. Now that the power is on,
you can open the Spaceship door. If you kept good notes at the library, you
will remember a piano key diagram. (OR you can go back to the library now
and get it!) There is a keyboard in the spaceship that is the same as the
diagram. 5 notes must be reproduced in order, first on the keyboard, then
on the lever/control pannel in the nose of the ship. The easiest way to get
the same notes on the lever machine is to count the notes as you raise the
levers. This is tough and will make you mad! Count up (in order 1-5), 8
notes up, 20, 23, 13, and 6 notes up. Then pull the lever. It must be
exact! It will play the notes. If you did it right, a light comes on, and
the next book appears. Click on it, and go to the Selenitic Age.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

                 You are now ready to proceed to each Age.
