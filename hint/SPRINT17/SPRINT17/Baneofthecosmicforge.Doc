                 WIZARDRY -----|- BANE OF THE COSMIC FORGE

                         ATTENTION AMIGA PLAYERS:

           IF YOU ARE PLAYING BANE OF THE COSMIC FORGE FROM FLOPPY
                 DISKS YOU MUST MAKE A COPY OF DISKETTE "A".

         IT IS PREFERABLE THAT YOU MAKE COPIES OF ALL THE DISKS THAT
             YOU RECEIVE IN YOUR PACKAGE.  THIS WILL PREVENT ANY
               ACCIDENTS FROM HAPPENING TO YOUR MASTER DISKS.

WARNING 

Please save your game often.  And keep a backup copy of that save game
around.

If you're playing on your hard drive, save your game to floppy every now
and again.  If you're playing from floppies, save your games to
alternating formatted diskettes.  Why?  You never know when modern 
technology will meet a magnet thus eliminating all your hard work.

         Bane of the Cosmic Forge - System's Reference Card
               Amiga 500, 1000, 2000 2500 and 3000
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Installing Bane of the Cosmic Forge on a Hard (Fixed) Disk

Bane of the Cosmic Forge has its own installation program which will
help you to install Wizardry on your computer's hard disk.  Bane requires
approximately 2.5 megabytes of disk space; please be certain you have
this space available.  You must run the installation program from the
CLI.  Follow the directions below:

   1.  Boot your Amiga so that your system configures and recognizes the
       hard drive.

   2.  From Workbench, invoke the CLI or SHELL by double-clicking on its
       icon.  It may be located in the System drawer.

   3.  Insert Disk E in drive DF0: and type DF0:WINSTALL DH0:BANE and
       press RETURN.  Bane will create its own directory and begin the
       installation.  If you have more than one hard drive partition,
       such as DH1:, and you wish to install Bane on that hard drive,
       then you would type DF0:WINSTALL DH1:BANE instead.

   4.  When the installation begins, the install program will ask you to
       confirm your choice for a directory.  Press Y or N and RETURN.
       If the program is unable to create the directory or find it due
       to some error, it will abort the installation procedure.

   5.  Bane will now ask for the "E" disk.  It should already be in your
       drive.  Press C to continue or Q to quit, then press RETURN.

   6.  When Bane has copied its files from the E disk, it will next ask 
       for disk A.  This procedure will be repeated for each of your
       disks.  Insert the disk in drive DF0: and press C and RETURN to
       continue.

To Play Bane of the Cosmic Forge

You may boot Bane of the Cosmic Forge from the floppy DF0:, run it from
the CLI, or double click on its icon from the Workbench menu.  If you're
not playing off the hard drive, we recommend you boot Bane from the
floppy to free up as much memory as possible.

From the Floppy:  Insert disk A into drive DF0: and turn your computer 
                  on. 
From Workbench:   Double click on the BANE hard drive icon.  Then 
                  double click on the BANE icon.  If you're playing
                  off the floppy disks, just double click on the BANE
                  icon.
From the CLI:     Change your working directory to the Bane directory.
                  (For example, CD DF0: for floppy users, CD DH0:Bane
                  for hard drive users.)  Type BANE and press RETURN.

Adjusting the Stack Setting Before Play

If you play Bane from the CLI, you must adjust the size of the stack
each time you play.  Normally, the stack is set at 3000 or 4000.
However, for Bane, you'll need at least 8000.  To change the stack
from CLI, type STACK 8000 and press RETURN.  If you click on Bane's
icon or boot the disk itself, the stack will be set for you.

Just for Hard Drive Users

Bane of the Cosmic Forge requires approximately 1 megabyte of RAM memory
to run.  However, it understands that system overhead takes up
approximately 50 to 75K.  To free up as much memory as possible, it
may be necessary to remove any resident memory programs from your
startup sequence.

Nice to Meet Ya

AmigaDOS takes a few seconds each time you put a disk into the drive to
get acquainted with it.  On occasions where disk switches are required,
Bane will deliberately pause to give AmigaDOS time to log the disk.
However, if it does not recognize your disk in the time allotted, it
will repeat the request for the disk.  Just click or press RETURN to
continue.

Pull No Disk Before its Time

Pay attention to the disk light when switching disks.  If you pull
a disk out too soon, you may end up writing a vicious dragon over
your level one characters!  When the light goes out, you may remove
one disk and insert another.

Save Game Drive

You may save your game to any disk drive.  Once you have entered
Wizardry, select the "Disk" option.  Next, select "Game Configuration".
Using the UP and DOWN arrow keys, move to the Save Game Drive option.

     Hard Disk:  To save the game to your hard drive, leave this
     field blank.  If you leave this field blank, Wizardry will save
     your game to the default directory (the same directory where you
     installed the program).  If you wish to save the game to a
     different directory, you should enter the device name and
     directory name followed by a forward slash.  For example,
     DH0:BANE/.  If you would like to save it to another directory or
     path, the directory must exist beforehand; Wizardry will not
     make the directory for you.

     Floppies:  If you'd like to save your game to a floppy drive,
     just type the device name of the drive, such as DF0: (or DF1:).
     If you have a second disk drive (DF1:), we recommend you use
     this drive to save your games to reduce disk swapping.  Before
     you save a game, however, make sure your save game disk is
     formatted ahead of time.  We recommend you save your game to
     alternate floppy disks on a regular basis for backup purposes.
     So, just in case something happens to your save game, you've got
     a backup.

Replacing "Replace"

In the manual, you will find reference to an option called "Replace".
Using this command, you could replace one of your more experienced
party members with a newly created, level 1 character.  This option
has been removed from the game.  In effect, "Replace" defeated the
essence of Bane of the Cosmic Forge... creatively directing a single
party throughout the entire adventure.  Therefore, this option is no
longer available so you can enjoy the true essence of Bane of the
Cosmic Forge without compromise.

                              Clues and Hints


I wrote this file because I got tired of getting killed playing Bane of the
Cosmic Forge, I couldn't get anywhere. I read some of the clues from the
files that were uploaded pertaining to this fine game, and found out 
(The hard way) that many of the so call clues and hints did not worked.


  1..  The Key of spades is located in a room in the SW corner of second
       floor (take stairs in middle of long hall on west side of 1st level)

  2..  To get lots of experience points: Go to Queegueg's shop, enter and
       exit. Turn right, go forward 2 spaces. Turn left, go to end of hall
       turn right, go all the way down and pass through the 2 doors. Save
       game here!! Go up stairs and hold finger on left or right turn key
       This will spin you around, which attracts wandering monsters you
       can fight for lots points.

   3.. To Kill the Vampire and Rebecca: Use the silver cross, equip first
       3 party members with holy stakes of wood. Use holy water, equip 
       mirrors. Cast web and anti-magic on rebecca (That's the green
       girl that looks like dolly parton) proceed to kick ass. You can
       get the silver cross from the queen, the holy water from the monk's
       bodz behind secret door in enchanted forest, holy stakes can be found
       on the ship and the rocks of reflection (mirrors) by breaking the
       mirror rock in the enchanted forest with your pick.

   4.. To read the kings diary you must use the ring of stars.

   5.. To enter the Temple of Ramm and to cross the pit you must first
       equip the first character with goat's mask and the staff of ramm.

   6.. Use tinkerbell at circle of stone in enchanted forest to summon
       the queen of the fairies (no we're not talking about california)
       ask her what to say to delphi, this is also your last chance to
       to stock up on supplies, spend most of your money, since delphi
       will take all of your cash (just like your wife) in exchange
       for the staff of ramm.

   7.. To get the silver key, you must bring "snoopcheri" to L'Montes
       in the tower and he'll give you the key.

   8.. To find old snoopcheri you must use the rotten cheese in front of
       the small hole (mouse hole) in room with graffiti on barracks level
       of the castle.

   9.. To cross the dungeon gorge (That's a hole for you ignoramus) take the
       silver key to the captain's den. use the password to get in
       password is "skeleton crew" you need about 500 gold pieces to drink
       the tavern keeper unconscious. Open grate to get steel hook, use book
       of ramm for instructions to open the trap door in temple, cast all your
       preparatory spells to improve offense and defense, press the following
       goat-goat-orb-staff-orb. after this be prepared to kick ass with some
       bad ass snakes. This will give you access to the dungeon area, to
       reenter castle you must find dungeon key and bell key. Open locked
       door and get heavy rope, merge rope with hook to cross the gorge in
       dungeon, once you cross the gorge, be prepared to kick booty or to
       get your booty whoop, there's some bad mothers here. save often!!

  10.. In the Pyramid: Get the bone key from the teleporting treasure chest
       use something sticky (you'll find something sticky in the pyramid
       after killing a monster) to get the chest. To open the door to the
       area with the teleporting chest, you must push a button behind a
       secret door, make sure you get the right button, since there are
       several buttons that do nothing at all. Find an empty sack in one
       of the chests, fill it with sand found in a dead end corridor in
       lowest level of the pyramid. The bone key will open 2 gates in the
       pyramid, be sure to find all the buttons along the walls in this
       area. Explore the pits here too, one near the end of the hall will
       have something very important in it, again make sure you find all
       the buttons to open the gate and disarm the traps. There is a well
       protected shrine in this area, use the bag of sand, just like indy
       did in "Indiana Jones" at the shrine to get the idol. Use the idol
       to open gate at other end of the pyramid. Do not kill the Amazulu
       Queen, give her a gift (anything) and you'll be able to talk to the
       high priestess, buy the foot powder from her.

  12.. To break the diamonds use miner's chisel on all four sides, then go
       to the South West corner and search until you find the fault line
       use the chisel and if necessary the pick to break the barrier, at
       the altar, press symbols in the following order: 2nd-2nd-1st-3rd-
       1st. 

  13.. The security code for the end of the game is "The hand of Destiny"

  14.. An effective party to have is: Lord/Ranger/Priest/Mage/Samurai/
       Ninja, a bard is also good since they have magic powers when playing
       instruments. Make sure that you have atleast one "Female" in the
       party, as there are places in the game that only a female can complete.
       After advancing to a new level, use some of your skill points to
       increase magical study and scouting skills, these 2 skills do not
       change automatically when you advance to a new level. You must have
       a skilled thief to be able to open all the doors, once a door is 
       jammed, you can almost forget about opening that door again. Chests
       are nearly always booby-trapped.  

  15.. From the start: Go north into the alcove, then go thru left or right
       door (they both go to the same place) go north along either wall
       to find 2 chests, neither is trapped, one has scrolls and amulet of
       life and the other has a sword +1, go north and use the fountain.
       in back of the fountain are 2 sets of stairs and a door in the middle,
       go thru the door to the gate, open gate by pushing button next to the
       wall, go inside and kill the snake (sometimes is a different kind of
       monster) search until you find the key of ramm in the northwest corner.
       Go south back to the entrance gate, go east enter first south door for
       another chest. Items in this area are randomized. Stay on level one
       until you've entered all doors and gained enough experience points.
       The next area is reached by going downstairs in the southeast corner.
 
  16.. Snoopcheri is a stuffed beagle (no, not superbeagle) you must give
       him to L'Montes.

  17.. Useful passwords are (1) Skeleton Crew (2) Giant Mountain.

  18.. There's a locked door near the queen's bedroom that can't be opened,
       so don't waste time on it. Find the 2 secret passages near the king's
       bedroom instead. The code for the altar is in his diary, the "use"
       command let's you read it. Important keys to find:
       Gold/Silver/Spade/Ramm/Jailer/Dungeon. there is an important secret
       passage in the room with the graffiti on wall, you must have the
       rotten cheese with you.
