	Alternate Reality is one of the best games of Amiga, I think!
	Here is some stuff which help you with the game. Map and hints might be
	useful with C64 version (which I don't have).

	readme		This file

	AR.Carak	A first level character with lots of money and
			good abilities, and initial moral standards. Using
			it might be considered cheating.

			Remember to backup save files often (though you might
			not want to if you think it is cheating).

	ARMap.ilbm	IFF ILBM map of the City of Xebec's Demise. Made by an
			AmigaBASIC program :-)...

	ARMapper.bas	The program which made the map.

	ARMap.bin	The map data from the game, used by ARMapper.bas.

	Help_file	An old help file. Sorry, author, but you didn't
			have your name in it? I can't remember where I got
			this file. It has some misinformation, but most of
			the stuff is very good.

	and finally...

	Letter		A letter I mystically received from the Alternate
			Reality. It just appeared on my save disk. It has many
			useful hints.
