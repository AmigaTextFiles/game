                        ROADWAR-EUROPA     

Europa the story-The dawn comes early in the Adirondacks. As the first
rays of warming enter the rustic cabin's single room, its sole occupant
stirs upon his cot. His single light blanket slides to the floor revealing
a broad well muscled back. Dozens of varied scars give silent evidence that
this is no ordinary man.

    The digital clock atop the television indicates six o'clock and the set
switches on. Like the world outside, the screen changes from darkness to
light and cheerful voices break the calm the voices wake the man. He rolls
to his back and stretches widely. Swinging his feet to the floor, he rubs
dull eyes and inspects the collection of discarded liquor bottles littering
the vicinity of his bed. Picking a likely looking container he swirls its
meager contents, raises it to his lips and sowns it in a single pull. A
belch rolls from his lips. His attention is drawn to the television at the
mention of his own name.
     
     The perky young newswoman continues, "It was exactly one year ago
today when our beloved former president disappeared.  Let us look back and
remember. After serving an unprecedented five terms in office and elevating
our great nation to a position in the world community beyond its former
glory days, our dear president steped aside amid cries of protest in
deference to a successor better versed in the ways of diplomacy and the
peaceful resolution of problems."
     
     "Shortly after stepping down, this great citizen dropped from public
view until one day his aids reported him missing from his home without
explanation. At first, kidnapping was suspected, but no demands were ever
received"

     "Those closest to our great leader hypothesized that the lack of
action and challenge drove their champion out of the mainstream. Others
whispered of suicide." "Perhaps we shall never know what becam of him, but
certainly none shall forget his deeds."
     
     The woman's face is replaced by the beaming countenance of a man who
chuckles and remarks,"They could certainly use him in Europe these days, eh
Barbie?"

     After waiting for the expected giggles from Barbie, he continues, "The
threats of the terrorists now active in nearly every major european city
can no longer be discounted. At midnight last night a small and extremely
dirty nuclear device detonated in a European city the name of the city is
being withheld pending notification of the victims' next kin."
     
     "There are purportedly five other such devices hidden in various
European cities which will be dentonated over the next several monthes
unless the UN members accede to the demands of the terrorist leader
Wunatolah Toumeini."
     
     "Rumors of an anti-terrorist underground persist, but continue to be
unconfirmed."
     
     "UN spokeman Andros Kyros states that little can be done to eliminate
the terrorist threat until the whereabouts of ther headquarters is
discovered. The UN general council sees no alternative but to negotiate,
given the present circumstannces. Although some nations continue to protest
these negotations an accord is expected to be reached within a fortnight."

     "Bullshit!" the man roars punctuating his outburst by hurling the
empty liquor bottle through the television screen. Stalking to the small
grimy sink he splashes cold water over his face and stares at his
reflection in the mirror. A tiny flame ignites within him, its gleam
showing in his thoughtful face.

     The honorable member from the USSR beats forcefully on his podium with
the heal of his shoe. In a thick slavic accent he bellows above the general
din,"DA! DA! we must agree."

     A wave of assent swells up to drown the islands of discontented voices
of the GDR and israeli contingnents.

     A gunshot splits the air. The chamber falls silent as all eyes are
drawn to the spectacle framed by the doorway of the main entrance.

     Three men struggle. One ratty looking individual, holds a smoking .45
aimed at the ceiling With his other hand he fends off his attackers, two IN
security guards. a small heap of additional security men can be seen lying
about the ante-room behind the belligerents. Effortlessly quieting the last
two security men with a flurry of wel aimed blows the ratty figure turns to
face the assemblage.

     "Concede? at the first blow?, he roars incredulously. " And you call
yourselves leaders."

     The intruders' commanding tone preserves the awed silence.

     One of the US delegation does a double take and then expodes into a
joyous shour, "It's him! It's him!" Running forward he hugs the ratty
fellow and begins to sob.

     In closed session, the UN security council meets. After hours of
discussion they are convinced  The fate of all Europe will be placed in the
hands of this individual.
