                          Libyans In Space

Well, the game of Libyans in Space.  The game isn't copy protected and I
know you all don't have the docs so I cooked up some.  I drew the encryption
cards in dpaint and they are sized according to scale.  Here, I will show
you how to use those cards after you print them out.  I may digitize the
instructions/docs if I can spare the time, but this should work.  By the
way, this guy has a new password protection scheme.  This looks a little
tough, but once you examine the example I give, all will be figured out.
These docs (as well as the game) are brought to you by the growing members
of A.P.E (Amiga Pirate Exchange).  Remember, spread the word and the disk!
But don't forget the docs!!!

The encryption card this game comes with gives you a letter, a number, and
another letter.

(1) You align the first letter on the small card with the number on the
large card.
(2) look at the second letter on the small card and type in the secret code
letter.

Example:
The computer gives you the code of B4G.  When you refer to the encryption
card you will find that the answer is "Y".  You must type in Y for the
simulation to begin.

Well, that is as much as I can give you.  Try the example until you get the
hang of it.

Docs:  I am not going to give you all of them, but here are a few (many
keyboard options besides the flying/fighting....
