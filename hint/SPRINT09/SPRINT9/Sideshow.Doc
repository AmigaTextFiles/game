Putting Yourself in the Dunk Tank
---------------------------------

   We have done something unique to the Dunk Tank.  We have made it
possible for you to actually put yourself or a friend (or enemy) into
the Dunk Tank.  It requires you to paint or digitize yourself using a
paint program or a digitizer/camera.  It also requires some skill.  Here's
how:

       Before making any changes, be sure to backup your disks!

       1) Use your paint program to load in the FACE TEMPLATE screen
          from SideShow disk 3.  It's called "Template.ILBM".  The
          template contains the colors you can use for the face as well
          as its proper size.

       2) Draw the image you want into the indicated area in the
          template.  The image can be anything you want as long as it fits
          within the boundaries.

       3) IMPORTANT !!!  Save only the image youve just painted (not the
          entire picture) as a brush (not a picture) with the name
          "Face.ILBM".  In Deluxe Paint for example, you would capture
          the image using the BRUSH SELECTOR gadget in the toolbox then
          save it as a brush.

NOTE: If the graphics file you saved is not exactly the same size as the
area in the template, SideShow will not load it and will use the
default graphics instead.  If you accidently change or delete the face
template, there is another copy of it on SideShow Disk 3 in the
directory called "Images".

   If you do not wish to paint your image but yet wish to try another
face, there is a file on disk 3 in the IMAGES directory called
FACE0.ILBM.  All you have to do is copy this file to the root directory.

   From the WORKBENCH copy the FACE0.ILBM icon out of the IMAGES drawer
and rename it FACE.ILBM.

   Assuming Ticket3 disk is in DF0: from CLI or Shell,
          CD DF0:
          COPY IMAGES/FACE0.ILBM TO FACE.ILBM.
