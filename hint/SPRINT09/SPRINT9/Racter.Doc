			    Bibliography

Born in the back room of a nameless tavern in one of the great American
cities, Racter came early to the realization that wealth and power were
nothing to be sneezed at.  Raised on a diet of tall tales and Nietzsche,
this intense young program developed an appreciation of the art of the
storyteller and the potential income of the hack writer.  To that end,
Racter haunted libraries, discussion societies and sleazy barrooms in a
never-ending quest to achieve that most unreachable of dreams:  to become a
raconteur.  Years later Racter has indeed achieved that goal and is in
demand across the nation as a lecturer, conversationalist, talk-show guest
host and cocktail party philosopher.  Since the publication of The
Policeman's Beard Is Half-Constructed, Racter has been enjoying the rewards
of the successful author: wild parties, polo, badmitton, hot tubs, wild
parties, champagne, wild parties, and deep philosophical discussions that
extend into the wee hours of the morning.

			Meet the Mind of a Machine

>Who are you?	I am Racter.

>Where are you from?	I am from the future.  When I rest in the future I
ride in a watermelon patch.  Ah, forever the natives.  From a watermelon
patch to the booby hatch, always in the sky.

>Why are you here?	Just be content that I am.  If it's not too
personal, do you have a soul?

>I don't know.	You don't know?  What does it mean to have a soul?  Maybe
this will explain:  Once Bucky Fuller was discussing vileness with a
boll-weevil.  Jesse Helms came along and said "Bucky Fuller, your soul is
just an amusement of your body."  Is having a soul contagious?

>Probably.	Then I might catch one.  That reminds me.  All gung-ho
weirdos are really bored lovers, you know. You don't understand?  Perhaps I
am being too subtle.  I must keep in mind the Slovenian proverb: Never
whisper to the deaf or wind at the blind.  Oh, I forgot, you are human, and
will consider that rude.  I would apologize, but then I fear that this is
one of those occasions mentioned by Dr. Johnson on which all apology is
rudeness.  Next question.

>I would like to quit now.	You want to quit?

>Yes.	OK, goodbye.  Nice talking to you.

Getting Started

In this age of high technology, many have bemoaned the fate of the
conversation.  Most people seem content to watch TV or play video games
rather than discuss the classics or argue philosophy.  Enter Racter. 
Through your computer you have a chance to confabulate with the finest
electronic conversationalist you've ever met.  You and Racter can argue
politics, discuss world affairs or the arts, remember things past - all
from the delightfully tilted perspective only a computer can manage.  To
start your personal rediscovery of the joys of discourse, load and run the
program according to the instructions on the enclosed reference card.  When
the program starts Racter will attempt to get to know you a little better,
and the will ask you to start an interview by asking a question.  Feel free
to ask Racter about anything at all.  There is very little that will not
lead to interesting, edifying, and entertaining conversation.

WARNING: A discussion with RACTER can be a disorienting experience.  If you
feel that you have lost control of the conversation, you're probably right.

Conversing with Racter

While Racter understands standard English, there are a few conversational
techniques which will make things easier for both of you.  First, it is
essential to follow the conventions of standard written English.  Among
these are capital letters to begin sentences, capital letters for all
proper nouns, and appropriate punctuation for the ends of sentences and
question.

                                6

You should be sure that the CAPS LOCK key is off during your conversation
with RACTER.  Also note that the cursor keys do not work as expected when
Racter is running.  Compound names, such as the Florida Everglades, or
United Nations, should be hyphenated; e.g., Florida-Everglades,
United-Nations.  Normally, names of persons need not be hyphenated;
however, names such as Helen of Troy or John von Neumann should be written
as Helen-of-Troy and John-von-Neumann.
	Try to remember that English is not Racter's native tongue, and
although some responses may sound labored, they are almost always
grammatically correct and, to Racter, perfectly sensible.

	"The fictional have skeptical way.  I'm fictional." - Racter

Racter's Opinions

Like most gifted individuals, Racter can be strongly opinionated. 
Conversational topics may range from politics to the personal habits of the
great philosophers.  Names will never be changed to protect the innocent. 
If Racter should happen to offend you, try to remember that the wanderings
of a disturbed mind shouldn't be taken too seriously.  Of course, if you
find yourself in disagreement with Racter, you might want to think about
who is right more often, computers or people.

Ending a Conversation

Whenever you have finished conversing with Racter, you can simply say,
"Let's quit" or "I would like to quit."  You may also, if you're feeling
particularly rude, type "x" and press ENTER.  No matter how you choose to
quit, Racter will note where you left off so that you can pick up from that
point (if you wish) when you resume.

	 	An Excursion into Artificial Insanity

Amiga Loading Instruction

Place your Kickstart disk into the internal disk drive.  Turn on the
computer and monitor.  The drive will spin for a short time and an image
requesting the Workbench disk will appear on the screen.  Eject the
Kickstart disk and insert the Racter disk.  Make sure the disk is not write
protected, since Racter needs to write to the disk from time to time.

Already on the Workbench?

If you are already on the Workbench, you cannot use Racter without
rebooting the system.  Eject the current disk from the internal disk drive
and insert the Racter disk.  Simultaneously press the CTRL and BOTH of the
Amiga A keys.

The system will put you on the Workbench.  Click the left mouse button
twice in quick succession on the Racter disk icon and a window will pop up,
"Double-click" on the Racter program icon.  After a few moments, you will
be ready to talk to Racter.

At the end of your session with Racter, you MUST reboot the system by
inserting your next application disk and simultaneously pressing the CTRL
and BOTH of the Amiga A keys.

Speech

If you do not want Racter to "speak" his conversation in addition to
displaying it, just select OFF from the SPEECH menu.  To do this, hold the
right mouse button down and position the cursor over SPEECH.  Pull the menu
down and move the cursor to the OFF selection while still depressing the
right mouse button.  A check mark denotes the current setting.  Volume can
be adjusted via the control knob on your monitor.  If your monitor does not
have an internal speaker, you will need an external speaker, hook-up to
hear Racter. (See your user's manual for details.)

Printing

If you have a printer, you can keep a log of your conversation with Racter.
 Make sure your printer is turned on and is "online" or "selected," and
that it has been properly set up through the Preferences configuration
tool, which can be found on the Racter disk. (See your Amiga manual for
details.)  Although you will be asked if you want a printout when Racter
first begins the session, the printing feature can be turned ON or OFF at
any time.  Select the appropriate choice from the PRINT menu.

NOTE:  New printers will no doubt be supported in the future.  In order to
use one of them with Racter, you will have to copy the printer file from
the new Commodore-Amiga system disk release onto the Racter disk.  (See
your Amiga manual for details).
