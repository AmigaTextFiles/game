1. Insert disk 1 into the internal  drive and turn on the computer. If the
   external drives are available,insert disk 2 into df1 & disk 3 into df2.

2. Lemmings 2 will now load the Psygnosis & DMA logo,followed by the intro
   sequence and all the game data.

3. If only one drive is used,follow the on-screen disk swapping prompts to
   load all the required data.


THE OBJECTIVE
-------------

 By now,you'll probably be aware of the horrible plight the Lemmings face.
Not only do they have to leave their lovely little hovels for good,but they
also have to escape their island before they perish in the Darkness that's
coming.Must be one of those days.

 Your objective therefore is to save as many Lemmings as possible from each
tribe and help them escape the Island,although if you've read the story and
decided that some of the Lemmings are a little too self-centred to be given
a place on the ark,don't worry,we quite understand!

 Lemming Island is made up of 12 lands,each holding a piece of the Talisman
and containing a tribe of Lemmings with a distinct,er,culture. You must
guide at least one Lemming from each tribe through 10 levels. That way,as
you progress each tribe's piece of Talisman will be taken to the ark
which,when joined to the remaining eleven pieces,will form the complete
talisman and allow the tribes to escape.But be warned,only the number of
Lemmings rescued on level 1 will progress to level 2!

BRONZE,SILVER OR GOLD TALISMAN
------------------------------

 The number of Lemmings saved throughout the tribe determines what type of
Talisman piece (Gold,Silver or Bronze) the player is awarded.If the tribe
is saved with only a few Lemmings remaining,then a Bronze is awarded.If the
tribe is saved with superb playing,then a gold is awarded. Silver comes
between the two.After playing each level,you are awarded a medal which
indicates whether you are course for a gold,silver or bronze piece.The
ultimate accolade is to have a gold piece of the Talisman for every tribe.
Good Luck!

ONCE THE INTRO SEQUENCE HAS LOADED,THE MAIN MENU WILL BE DISPLAYED.

PLAY
----

 When you come and play for real,choose a tribe and enter the preliminary
screen.This screen shows you precisely which skills the Lemming s have to

you the time you have in which to save our playful pals.

Also,if you previously played some levels,you can return to these levels
from this screen - letting you try and increase the number of Lemmings
you've saved!

 Your objective on each screen is to get as many Lemmings as possible from
their trap door (from which they fall onto the screen) to the exit (to be
found in the form of a house or doorway).The screen can scroll in eight
directions by moving the pointer across theappropriate edge of the screen
and can jump-scroll with a press of the right button.This centres the play
area around your cursor.

times that skill is available is written inside the skills box.This number
