TECHNICAL AND FLIGHT SUPPLEMENT 
 FOR COMMODORE AMIGA COMPUTERS


			    TECHNICAL SUPPLEMENT
			    --------------------

CONTENTS
--------

 Your B-17 Flying Fortress game should contain a manual,this Technical and
Flight Supplement(including a pull-out key guide), poster,a set of 3.5"
disks and a registration card.

REQUIRED EQUIPMENT
------------------

COMPUTER: This simulation requires a Commodore Amiga with at least 1MB of
RAM.

CONTROLS: This simulation can be run entirely from the keyboard and mouse.
Most sections also support joystick control.Analogue joysticks are not
supported.

DISPLAY: This simulation requires a colour display.

DISK DRIVES: B-17 Flying Fortress can be installed onto 3.5" floppy disks.
However,it works best if installed onto a hard disk drive.

 Important: B-17 Flying Fortress should not be played from the disks
enclosed.You must either copy the original disks onto backup floppy disks
(see Making Backup Game Disks),or use the Install program to make a
subdirectory on your hard disk.If you attempt to play from the disks
enclosed they may become permanently altered.

------------------------------------PAGE:2-----------------------------------

AMIGA KEYBOARDS
---------------

 The simulation has alternative keys for players who own Amigas without the
numeric keypads.The following alternative keys should be used:

Numeric Key Pad		Alternative			Function
---------------		-----------			--------
KEY PG UP 9		CTRL/CURSOR KEY UP		PITCH VIEW UP
KEY PG DOWN 3		CTRL/CURSOR KEY DOWN		PITCH VIEW DOWN
INS KEY 0		CTRL/CURSOR KEY LEFT		ROTATE VIEW LEFT
DEL KEY .		CTRL/CURSOR KEY RIGHT		ROTATE VIEW RIGHT
KEYPAD 5		BACKSPACE			CENTRE 3D VIEW
KEYPAD PLUS +		CLOSE SQUARE BRACKETS ]		ZOOM VIEW IN
KEYPAD MINUS -		OPEN SQUARE BRACKETS [		ZOOM VIEW OUT


COPY PROTECTION
---------------

 Flying Fortress has no disk copy protection.This means you can install the
simulation files from the original disks to a hard disk.However,the program
asks you a simulation related question.Use the manual to answer the question.
Microprose regrets that  continuing casual  and organized software piracy
requires that we retain this minimal form of copy protection.

INSTALLATION
------------
INSTALLATION CONCEPTS
---------------------

 B-17 Flying Fortress has no disk copy protection.This means you can copy
the game files from the original disks to other floppy disks,or to a hard
disk.However,always keep the original disks handy.

 B-17 Flying Fotress has been left uprotected for your convenience in
making back-up copies and when playing from a hard drive.However,making
additional copies to give away or sell is a Copyright Violation.See the
Copyright Notice in the game manual.

MAKING BACKUP GAME DISKS
------------------------

 To create the backup game disks for B-17 Flying Fortress load up the
Workbench disk and insert the first disk yo wish to copy.A disk icon and
the name of the disk will appear.

------------------------------------PAGE:3-----------------------------------

 Click once on the disk icon and the name of the disk will appear.Hold down
the right mouse button and you will see three menus.Choose the Workbench
menu and select the Duplicate option.Follow all on-screen prompts and the
disk will be duplicated onto your blank disk.

 When a disk has finished copying you will need to rename it so that it has
the same name as the original disk from which it was copied.To do this
insert your copied disk,click on its icon once with the left button and
then hold down the right button.Select the Rename icon from the Workbench
menu.Finally,delete the "Copy Of" prefix in front of the disk name and
press the [Return] key.

 Repeat the above procedure for each of the original B-17 Flying Fortress
game disks.

INSTALLING ON HARD DISK
-----------------------

 Boot up your hard disk as normal and insert B-17 Flying Fortress Disk A.
Open this disk and double-click on the "INSTALL_HD_B17" icon.Please follow
any on-screen prompts.A drawer will be created on your hard disk,containing
all necessary files.

RUNNING B-17 FLYING FORTRESS
----------------------------

 FROM THE FLOPPY DISKS

 If your computer has Kickstart in ROM,turn off your computer and insert
your backup Disk A.Power up the computer,and insert the program will auto
load.

 If your computer does not have Kickstart in ROM,load Kickstart as normal,
insert your backup Disk A at the Workbench prompt and the program will auto
load.
  
 Follow any on-screen prompts requesting disk changes.

 FROM THE HARD DISK

 Boot up your hard disk as normal.Open the drawer and double-click on the
"game" icon.

 SAVED GAMES

 Individual Bomber Campaigns may be saved to disk but only when missions
have finished.Campaigns may be saved onto your hard drive or onto a
previously formatted floppy disk.It is recommended that you do not save
campaigns onto your game disks or backup game disks.Saved game files are
normal Amiga DOS files that can be moved and copied using standard DOS
commands.

 LOADING A SAVED GAME

 To load a saved game,choose the "Load Save" button on the Roster Screen,
then follow the on-screen prompts.

------------------------------------PAGE:4-----------------------------------

SIMULATION ENHANCEMENTS & LAST MINUTE INFORMATION
-------------------------------------------------

THE COMPARTMENT SCREENS
-----------------------

 The original PC version of Flying Fortress contained six Compartment
Screens each showing the position of the crew for that part of the plane.
You will find many references in the manual to the different Compartment
Screens (particularly parges 50-51).For ease of use and to speed up the
gameplay,the Amiga version has all six Compartment Screen details on ONE
top down view.This is still accessed by KEY C and the icons and portraits
still appear.However,you will NOT be able to click-on a 2D picture of the
individual crew member but will have to selct the portraits.

 This screen will also show damage.

QUICK START
-----------

 A Quick Start Option is available in the Difficulty Menu of the
Configuration Screen.Select this option to bypass the taxi-out sequence and
eliminate navigation errors (see navigation below).

 Yow will begin the game as the last of a flight of three B-17's,queued,
ready for take-off,near the start of the runway.You will be in manual
control of the pilot,with your engines running and throttles set in the
idle position.Increase power to the engines to begin taxiing fowards,then
follow the other B-17s in your flight out onto the runway for take-off.

MANUAL/COMPUTER CONTROL
-----------------------

 The simulation will show a Hand Icon in a corner of the screen when you
are in Manual control of any B-17 position.If you choose to revert to
Computer xontrol (KEY M),a Computer Icon will appear in the same position.

------------------------------------PAGE:5-----------------------------------

NAVIAGATION
-----------

 Your Navigator will always make minor errors in estimating your position
depending on his particular skill level.Your B-17 flight (3 planes) will
drift off course unless you manage to correct his estimates.The more you
correct him successfully,the better will become his skill level.

BOMBING
-------

 If you do not wish to aim and drop the bombs manually,or if there are no
uninjured crew members qualified to operate the Norden Bombsight you can,
provided you are in formation,position a crew member at the Bombardier's
station and have the computer contolled crew members release the bombs when
he sees the raid leader's signal.

 If you do wish to bomb manually,you should position a qualified crew
member at the bombardier's station and,using the Radio Operator,send the 
`Bomb on my command' Radio message to take control of the bomb run so that
the computer controlled crew will wait for your commands.

GUNNERY
-------

 The Turrets Menu on the configuration Screen allows you to set the speed
at which the turrets and the hand held guns will traverse in response to
the keyboard and the joystick controls.In addition,fine tracking may now be
enabled by holding down either the Shift or CTRL Keys while operating the
other controls.The CTRL Key is recommended as it may give better results
with some keyboards.

LANDING
-------

 The landing procedure differs depending on whether you are in formation or
not when you reach Alconbury (Home Base).

In Formation
------------

 The formation will circle Alconbury descending to an altitude of about
2,000ft.At this point,the Alconbury control tower will radio `Permission to
Land'.When this happens,the computer controlled pilot will break away from
the formation to begin his landing approach and will land the aircraft
unless you take manual control (by selecting the Pilot and Key M).

------------------------------------PAGE:6-----------------------------------

If you wish to land immediately,before landing permission is granted,you
must send a radio message requesting permission to land,then wait for the
reply from the Tower to start the landing sequence.

OUT OF FORMATION
----------------

 The Control Tower will ask whether you want permission to land.You should
reply with a radio message requesting permission,then proceed as above.

BREAKING FORMATION
------------------

 If you break away from your 3 plane formation at any point in the missions,
you must send a radio message to the rest of the flight via your Radio
Operator.

FIGHTING ENGINE FIRES
---------------------

 B-17 now has a more detailed engine fire-fighting procedure.

 If engine fires are not extinguished within 1 minute,the engines will
suffer damage and stop functioning.If the fire persists (depending on the
B-17 reliability level you have chosen) your B-17 is liable to explode
between 2 and 12 minutes after the fire has started.

 If your fire extinguishers are ineffective,or have been used up in a
previous fire,you can try to extinguish the fire by diving your V-17 at a
speed in excess of 350mph.Avoid speeds over 400mph as this will result in
structural damage.

CREW NAMES
----------

 Crew members' names may be changed by selecting the Name button on the
Crew File Screen when this is accessed from the Crew Photo Screen between
missions.

MUSIC
-----

 Music may be switched on/off by pressing Keys ALT/S.

THE PILOT'S CONTROL COLUMN ICON
-------------------------------

 The Pliot's Control Column Icon is the lower of the two icons in the
Compartment Screen and not the top icon,as stated in the manual (Page 28).
The top Control Column Icon will light up when you select the Co-Pilot. You
will begin every mission in the Pilot's seat (left-hand looking out of the
cockpit window).

------------------------------------PAGE:7-----------------------------------

THE MISSION BRIEFING MAP
------------------------

 The Yellow Line shows the Waypoints to the initial point.
 The Red Line shows the initial point to the Primary Target,and the Black
Line to the Secondary Target.
 The White Line shows the Waypoints to home base.

VIEWING CREW POSITIONS KEYS F1-F10
----------------------------------

 There is no need to assign the ten crew positions when you first enter the
B-17 as stated in the Flying Fortress Manual.All crew are in their correct
position and can be viewed immediately by pressing Function Keys F1 to F10.

SKIP TIME ALT/T
---------------

 By pressing ALT/T you will jump to the next Waypoint,or to a point where
something is happening.(eg.an air attack by enemy fighters.)

NAVIGATOR'S VIEWS
-----------------

 If you access the Navigator's external view Key E (Flying Fortress Manual
page 80) you may return to Map View by pressing Key I.

READ ME FILE
------------

 The latest notes regarding this program,additions,revisions ect can be
found on Disk A in an ASCII file named "READ.ME".You can read the file
using standard Amiga DOS commands,eg Type","More".These utilities can be
found on the Workbench disk.

OPERATING DIFFICULTIES AND LOADING PROBLEMS
-------------------------------------------

 In the vast majority of cases a loading problem is not because of faulty
software,but either incorrect loading procedure or hardware fault.

 Please ensure that the loading instructions have been correctly executed.
The most common hardware failures are due to a misalignment of the heads in
the disk drive.Such faults may be detected by loading the game on another
computer.

------------------------------------PAGE:8----------------------------------

 Alternatively, a virus may have transferred into your hardware from
another piece of software.Pirated copies of games are an incredibly common
source of virus problems.It always pays to own original software.In the
unlikely event of a software fault please return the complete package,with
your receipt,to the place of purchase.Microprose regret that goods cannot
be replaced unless bought from the company directly.

 If you have any difficulty while loading B-17 Flying Fortress or need help
while running the simulation,Micrprose will be happy to assit you on the
Helpline.Please ring UK 0666 504399,Monday to Friday 0900 to 1700 hours.
Have a pen and paper handy when you call.

 A Joystick CONTROLLER is recommended for flying the B-17 but you may also
fly it using a Keyboard CONTROLLER.

 Ailerons are lateral control flaps at the rear of the airplane main wing
tips.When raised or lowered by moving the Control Column left/right they
will make the plane turn to the left of right.

 Elevators are the horizontal portions of the tail.When pushed up/down by
pushing the Control Column up/down they will make the plane dive or climb.

RUDDER LEFT/RIGHT < >

 Rudder controls left/right will swing the nose of the plane left/right by
moving the trailing edge vertical segment of the tail left/right.

THE FOUR ENGINES
----------------

 The Flying Fortress is a large four-engined bomber and this simulation
provides seperate controls for each of the four engines.Engine number 1 is
the left outboard engine from the Pilo's view followed by 2,3,4 in
sequence.

 All numeric keys are on the top row of the main computer keyboard.

------------------------------------PAGE:19----------------------------------

OTHER PILOT CONTROLS
--------------------

G	-	Landing Gear Up/Down (starts motors0
F	-	Flaps Up/Down Toggle
B	-	Brakes On/Off
D	-	Bomb Bay Doors Open/Closed (starts motors)

NB Any control that starts a motor will take time to function.

THE TAKE OFF
------------

 You will begin every mission in the pilot's seat under plater control.Your
Flying Fortress will be at its starting point on the airfield.Ahead of you,
the two other B-17's in your `V' will be preparing to take-off.

 You must take-off and join the other two planes.

 On your first mission,you may find it easier to watch while the computer
takes control.To activate computer control,press the "M" key.Repress the
"M" key to regain control.If you set the plane under computer control,you
can jump around any of the views or screens to watch the take-off.

 The following pages describe how to take-off manually.

STARTING ENGINES
----------------

 Start all four engines in the sequence CTRL/1,2,3,4

 Increase the Engine Throttle Controls 1,2,3,4
 
 Release the Brake (B)

 The B-17 will now begin to move.

 Check that you can easily flip from the Pilot's Instrument Panel (I) to
Window View (W) to see flight formation.

------------------------------------PAGE:20----------------------------------

TAXIING AND STEERING
--------------------

 Select an appropiate External View  ( (E),then PGUP/PGDOWN/INS/DEL) and
steer the B-17 by using your Controller.Gentle left/right will produce a
slow turn in the chosen direction.

 Stay on the correct path.Do not stray onto the grass.

 Steer the bomber carefully to the edge of the take off runway.Try to line
up the B-17 along the white dotted line.

FLAPS
-----

 Check that the Flaps are Down (F).

TAKING OFF
----------

 Returnto the Pilot's View (W).Apply maximum power to all four engines
SHIFT/+. Do not try to pull the plane into the air.Normally,when you reach
an Airspeed of 100-115 mph a gentle `pulling back' on the controller will
allow the plane to lift itself off the ground.The B-17 controls may feel
sluggish compared to other flight simulators,but remember that this is a
big,heavy airplane.

 After the airplane has left the ground,and you are sure you have
sufficient flying speed,raise the Landing Gear (G).Check that this has
happened with any appropiate Outside view,then change flaps to up (F).

 After reaching an airspeed of 130-150 mph,adopt a normal climb attitude
with the Rate of Climb Indicator pointer at 200 feet per minute and watch
the Altimeter rise gently.

CLIMBING AND CRUISING
---------------------

 Make your climb at 130-150 mph.Steady smooth flying is important.This will
cut fuel consumption,increase rate of climb and reduce engine wear.Always
check your instruments.They are there to tell you how your plane is
performing.

 You will find the first two planes with which you must join up circling
the airfield at about 1000 feet.

 Form a group of 3 in a `V' formation.

IF YOU EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTY IN FINDING THE OTHER PLANES.SWITCH TO COMPUTER
CONTROL OR USE ALT/T SKIP TIME.

 Once you have joined the other planes of your squadron in formation,the
flight will strike out towards the first Waypoint.

LANDINGS
--------

 When you are near the English base,you will receive a signal over the
intercom system giving you a heading to land on.The other planes in the
formation,and yours if under computer control,will begin to move into their
final traffic pattern (a flight path in which they circle the airfield in a
rectangular pattern at approximately 1000 feet).

 The landing procedure differs depending on whether you are in formation or
not when you reach Alconbury (Home Base).

 In Formation The Formation will circle Alconbury descending to an altitude
of about 2,000ft.At this point,the Alconbury control tower will radio
`Permission to Land'.When this happens,the computer controlled pilot will
break away from the formation to begin his landing approach and will land
the aircraft unless you take manual control (by selecting the Pilot and Key
M).If you wish to land immediately,before landing permission is granted,you
must send a radio message requesting permission to land,then wait for the
reply from the Tower to start the landing sequence.

 Out of Formation The Control Tower will ask whether you want permission to
land.You should reply with a radio message requesting permission,then
performing a normal landing:Lower your Flaps (F) and drop your Landing Gear
(G).Keep the engine rpm's to 2000 at about 130 mph.

FINAL APPROACH
--------------

 The approach is basically a controlled glide,with flaps down,and in which
power is used to maintain an accurate landing position.

 Reduce power gradually (-) until the desired airspeed (about 100-120 mph)
and the rate of descent have been established.Touch down gently trying to
land all wheels on the runway at the same time.Drop to minimum throttle.

LANDING ROLL
------------

 When you have landed make sure you use the entire runway for the landing
roll.Do not apply brakes too early.Apply the brakes (B) when you feel the
plane slowing down from its roll.The B-17 should then slow down and stop.
