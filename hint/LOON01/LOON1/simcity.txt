WHAT YOU NEED.

In order to complete the installation, you will need to know:

< In which drive and subdirectory (hard disk users only) your current 
  SimCity files are located.

In addition, you will need the following.

For FLOPPY DISK installation:
< Your back-up disk of your SimCity disk (512K version)
< The SimCity Architecture disk
< One blank formatted disk

< The SimCity Architecture disk 
< 185k Free hard disk space for each of the new graphics (era) you install.

  disks. Store your SimCity Architecture disk and your new SimCity Program
  Graphics disk in a safe place.

< TERRAIN EDITOR users: While creating or editing a city terrain using your 
  Terrain Editor program (Not included) you can only view your cities in the
  original SimCity classic graphics. However, you may create or edit a terrain
  with the new Terrain Editor, save it, then load it into SimCity. You will
  then view the terrain in currently active graphics.
