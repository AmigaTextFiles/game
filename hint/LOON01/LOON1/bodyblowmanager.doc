 When we decided to develop Body Blows, it was important for us to take a look
 at just what "Beat-Em-Up" games where available for the Amiga and aim to
 better them all.

 At an early stage it became apparent that we would have to make a number of
 sacrifices and compromises along the way or else there would be no way we
 could get the Amiga to do what we wanted.

 Now the game is finished we are satisfied that we have given the Amiga "Beat
 -Em-Up" genre a game to be proud of.  As well as moving and playing fast and
 smooth, the game has full 32 colour overscan display, contains more speech &
 sound than we ever though we could fit in and more importantly, it has a
 magical factor "X" which means it is brilliant fun to play.

 Anyway, what are you doing sitting and reading this? Boot up the disk and get
 on with it!!

 Martyn Brown, Body Blows Project Manager.

 It's been along time in the making, but the most exciting Beat-em-up to
 appear on your Amiga has arrived.  Experience super fast, hard hitting fight
 action like you have never seen before... Choose one of four hero characters
 to combat the increasingly evil computer controlled opponents in Arcade Mode.
 Take on a freind (or enemy!!) in the highly competetive two player mode or go
 for broke in the Body Blows Ultimate Challenge, where upto eight players
 select their favorite character from the ten available to compete for the
 Champions Belt.


 COMPATIBILITY

 Body Blows will run fine on any Amiga system imaginable from the A500, A500+
 and the A600, A1200, A2000 through to the A3000/A4000 range.  Should you
 experience any problems please read the Trouble Shooting Section.

 Body Blows supports external drives and extra memory, you will need an Amiga
 with 1 megabyte of Random Access Memory (RAM) in order to play.  If your
 machine has extra memory then this will be used to store data during play.

 You will need a joystick to play the game, or two if in two player mode.
 The game will run on the CDTV system that supports joystick control.

 There is no facility to store Body Blows on a Hard Drive, the disks are non-
 Amiga standard.  Try to carry out such a task may damage your original disks
 and therefore we advise against it.

 Your Body Blows carry on disk copy protection and as long as you keep your
 disks write-protected they will function perfectly.  If the disks become
 damaged, virus infected or should suffer equally horrible fate then please
 read the disk faults & returns section.

 NOTE: Body Blows will work fine on any normal TV set although we recommend
 that player/players sit at least 1.5-2 metres away whilst playing.


 LOADING INSTRUCTIONS

 Turn off your Amiga at the power supply unit, wait 10 seconds and turn it
 back on again - this makes sure that no other data is in your system.

 When the usual insert disk prompt appears, insert Body Blows disk #1.

 After a short while, a loading screen will appear and loading will commence.
 If this is not the case, consult the Trouble Shooting Section.

 Insert the other Body Blows disks only when prompted by the game.  When load
 ing is complete, the main options menu will appear and music will play.


 MAIN MENU

 Use the joystick to move around the menu and the fire button to change the
 options; when you are satisfied with the setup you can start the game.


 GAME MODES

 There are three distinct modes of play within the game are as follows:->

 One Player: In this mode, a single player can select their character from
 four (DAN, NIK, LO-RAY, JUNIOR) and do battle against ever-thougher oppon-
 ents in an attempt to finally beat the evil MAX and discover his terrible
 secret.

 For details for selecting and operating the characters of your choice, please
 refer to the seperate charcter information pages that follow the main
 instructions.

 Two Player: In this mode, two players can select their fighters and location
 and take part in a bone-crunching duel.  Using the set-up options you can
 tailor the game to your specfic requirements (See Options).

 Tournament: This mode allows 4 or 8 human players to take part in a huge Body
 Blows knock out tournament.  As for the 2 player game, the tournament can
 tailored to suit your own personnel prefrences via the Set Up Options.


 OPTIONS

 within the set up options for both one player and two player games there are
 the following facilities;

 TIME - The round timer can be OFF in which case the fight is won by the last
 player standing, or it can be set to 60 or 90 time units.

 ROUNDS - This can be set to 1 or 3.  This way you can decide if the bout is
 decided quickly or if it has to be decided by the first player to win two
 rounds.

 MUSIC - In game music can be OFF or ON.

 CHAR v CHAR - This can be OFF or ON and gives players the ability to fight
 with the same character.  If two players are playing with the same charact-
 er in the same fight the then this will be shown on screen with a marker for
 the player using the second joystick (mouseport).

 ARCADE SKILL - This can be ON or OFF.  This effects the diffficulty level
 of the computer opponents in the One Player 'Arcade' game.  To see the exci-
 ting climax to the one player game, you must play in Arcade mode.

 DEFAULTS - On loading, Body Blows defaults to the following set-up;

 TIMER ON(90), ROUNDS(3), MUSIC(ON), CHAR v CHAR(OFF)

 The one player game defaults to Arcade skill.


 PLAYING THE GAME

 After selecting your game, the program will load the various characters and
 data from your disks, please insert only when the game requires them.

 At the top of the main game screen there is a panel which indicates the
 players and their strength, the number of bouts won, time left (or energy
 depleted before total knock out if time has been turned OFF) and the number
 of points for the players.  The player controlling the character from the
 mouse port is the one on the left and the other is on the right.

 The fight will be introduced with a digitsed speech and from then, the fight
 is underway!  The fight continues until one player defeats the other over
 1 or 3 rounds, depending upon the setup options.

 For full movement lists on the character you have chosen, consult the pages
 after these instructions;


 TROUBLE SHOOTING

 Your Body Blows disks should perform perfectly fine as long as you treat them
 with care.  Ensure they remain write-protected (so that you can see the lit-
 tle holes in the top right hand corner) and that you reset your machine prior
 to playing, as instructed earlier.

 Failure to observe these points does increase the possibillity of problems
 occuring, but does not neccassarly mean they will.

 If you have any problems and cannot work out what is happening then please
 call our helpline and they will answer your queries.

 The Team 17 helpline's number is 0924 201846, 10am - 4pm  Monday - Friday.

 If your disks do become damaged, infected by a virus, covered in some curious
 liquid  or even the dog chews them up (it has been known) then we will happ-
 ely replace you disk-set on the receipt of the old ones for a minimal charge
 of £2.50.  If your disks are faulty on purchase then simply return them to
 the place or purchase, who should exchange them for you.  If you encounter
 problems, phone the hotline (as listed above).  If you are to return a prod
 -uct directly to us for replacement, then package the disks only in a
 durable bag (a jiffy bag for instance) and mark it with the address below.

 The figures above represent a joystick and the 8 directions which it can
 move.  One is for movement of the joystick only (moves 0-8), one is for
 movement of the joystick along with the fire button (moves 9-16), and the
 last is for movement of the joystick along with fire button, while your
 player is in the air during a fight (moves 17-20).

 For move 21, press and hold the fire button only release it when the power
 bar next to your character (on the status display) is full. This will
 trigger your characters super-move.

 Each move is listed as a number, look up the relevent move in the charac-
 ter lists that follow these pages.

 The directions are shown above are the player facing right, they should be
 mirrored for the player facing left.
