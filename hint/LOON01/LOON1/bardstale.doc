 Getting Started NOTES

 The Bard's Tale Construction Set requires 640K of free memory.It
 requires about 1.2 MB of hard disk space.When you create a dungeon with
 the Set, you will need blank disks to hold the data or hard disk space
 available.The amount will vary greatly upon the size of your dungeon
 that you create.

 Loading Instructions

 1. Boot your computer with DOS.If you have a mouse, make sure
it is connected and the driver is installed.

 2. Insert the disk marked STARTUP into your disk drive.

 3. Change the disk prompt to the drive that your STARTUP disk is
in by typing A: <enter> (or B:) depending on where your STARTUP
DISK is.

 4. First you should read the README file for any additional
information not included in this manual. Type README<enter>

 5. After reading the README file, you will want to install the
Bard's Tale Construction Set to either your hard disk or to
floppies.Type INSTALL<enter>

 6. Follow the instructions there to install the Bard's Tale
Construction Set.

 7. When finished installing, type BTCS<enter> to load the program.

Your Dungeon!

 If you select any of the Editors from the Main Menu, you will then
 be shown a selection of the currently available items, spells,
 monsters, or maps previously created or you can create a new one
 altogether.

 Once you have selected which one you will be working with, a separate
 menu will appear containing all the editing information.Each item on the

 from 0 to 255, with 255 meaning that its Uses are unlimited.This number
 is also used for thrown weapons and bows.

 Spell Cast -- Choose from any spell off the spell list (that you
 create).

 Spell Editor

 Maximum number of definable spells is 100. Maximum number of
 simultaneously running spells is 100. Spells have the following
 qualities for you to define:

 Name -- The name you have chosen to give magic spell.Your spell name

 Mage Class -- Which class of magician can use this spell:

 1. Magician
 2. Sorcerer
 3. Conjurer
 4. Wizard
 5. Archmage

 Level -- What level of the particular mage class can use this spell
 (1 through 7).Setting level 8 makes the spell one that mage's cannot
 cast.

 Points Needed -- How many points are drained from the mage when he/she
 casts the spell.

 Range -- How far the spell will work for (10 to 90 feet).

 Effective Range -- Normal or Double. If Double is selected, then the
 spell will work at twice the range but at half the damage.

 1. Heal
 2. Resurrect
 3. Cure Poison
 4. Cure Insanity
 5. Youth
 6. Dispossess

 Area/Target --
 NA Not applicable; no target is needed or used SINGLE A single target,
 in either the party or a monster group, is affected GROUP An entire group,
 the party or a monster group, is affected ALL MONSTER GROUPS All of the
 monster groups are affected

 Damage/Healing - How much damage the spell does or how many points
 it heals.This is determined by a dice roll. (eg 4 6-sided dice).

 Duration -- ONE one round (6 seconds or 1 combat round)

 SHORT 2-4 minutes (or 20-40 rounds, since there are 10 rounds in a
minute)
 MEDIUM 3-6 minutes
 LONG 4-8 minutes
 COMBAT run until combat is over (cannot be cast outside of combat)
 PERMANENT start only (i.e. effect is permanent)
 CONTINUOUS run until dispelled, then just stop (don't end effect)
 INDEFINITE run until dispelled, then end effect

 Note that different permutations of these options will create vastly
 different spells.For example, a spell that does Continuous Damage on your
 Party will continue to damage your party every round or movement turn until
 it is dispelled.This can make for some pretty nasty spells.See the Spell
 Effects Chart on page 26 in the technical Section of this manual.

 If a spell is cast at a magic resistant monster, it gets to use its
 magic resistance when the spell is cast and each subsequent round (if any)
 that the spell operates.A group of monsters gets one roll for the entire
 group.If all monster groups are affected, the group with the highest
 magic resistance rolls.In any case, a resisted spell shatters and ends
 immediately.

 Utilities

 The utilities for The Bard's Tale Construction Set are as follows:

 1-6. LOAD/SAVE ITEMS, SPELLS, and MONSTERS -- when finished creating
	a list of the above,you will need to come to the Utilities to
	save the list to disk. You will also need to go to the Utiliies
	for Loading a preexisting file.

 7. PRINT SPELLS to Printer or Disk File -- print all the spells
	by class to printer or disk (for editing).

 8. TEST MAP --Test a level that you are currently working to test
	for items, monsters, spells, or specials.

 9. BUILD GAME -- puts all the files on a separate disk (or to a
	separate path) that you specify for your dungeon.This will in-
	clude marking a starting location (Guild) for all parties in the
	game.Since a level can only be accessed through teleports, you
	can change the file name of a dungeon level and put it with the
	old dungeon thus creating a different level.However, all
	teleports from that dungeon and to that dungeon will have to be
	synchronized. (For example, I have a city that, when you enter
	this one building, teleports you to the catacombs level one.If
	I decide at a later date that I want this building to teleport
	you to a castle, I would just have to change the file name of
	the castle to match that of the catacombs level one.) This
	would also apply to item lists, spell lists, and monster lists.

 Q. QUIT -- Quits the Construction Set to DOS.
Make sure that you have saved all items, spells, and monsters
before quitting.

 INCLUDE DPAINT(tm) PICTURE

 Inserts a picture that you have drawn from Deluxe Paint Enhanced (tm)
 or Deluxe Paint Animator (tm) to be included in the monster set There will
 be about 30 slots available before overwriting existing ones.Follow the
 instructions on screen.Remember that you may overwrite a picture you
 have already imported.It is up to you to keep track of which monster
 slots you have filled and with what pictures.

 To use this feature, type import<enter> at your DOS prompt while in your
 BTCS directory or the STARTUP DISK is in the disk drive and you are
 at the appropriate prompt.

 Tips for Creating a Bard's Tale World

 We've, given you a lot of power and flexibility to design your own world,
 but with that power comes responsibility for game balance.You can
 control most aspects of the game, but you should try to maintain a
 reasonable limit.

 Don't give every monster special attack damage or ranged attacks,
 and don't make every item have a spell it can cast. You *can* make an Axe
 of the Dwarven King that does 10d100 damage, but that doesn't mean you
 *should*.If you must put such items in the game, balance them somehow
 (perhaps the Axe is - 10 to hit since it's so big, Or maybe local shops
 won't let you come in if you are wielding it).

 Of course, you could put in a room with 99 MegaOrcs with 20d200 hit
 points, but then the game becomes an "arms race" of who can build the
 better item or monster.

 Items ----
 Take a look at the ten default items and use them as a guide for
 creating your own.

 Plan out what items you are going to have in your dungeon and enter
 them accordingly.One way to organize your items is by first do all
 your hand weapons, then armor, etc.Once you have a list compiled, it
 should make it easier to enter in the items. You may want to save the
 Miscellaneous category for last as these types of items may be determined
 as you create your maps.

 Keep in mind extra damage and damage dice when determining price.
 You don't want characters to be able to buy a powerful weapon
 inexpensively.

 Remember that Garth's sells only the first ten items on your list.
 These will be normally be the ten default ones.However, you can
 overwrite one of the default items with your own if you want Garth's to
 carry it Also keep in mind that Garth will not sell items he buys from
 you.Once you sell to Garth, it's gone for good.

 You do not have to assign values to every category.If a sword does
 nothing more than damage, then ignore the other categories.The defaults
 are all set to the minimums.In fact, an item that uses every category
 will be VERY powerful, so be careful.

 Remember that if an item is set to 0 (ZERO) times usable, then it
 cannot cast a spell.If you want an item to cast a spell, then change
 the times usable category first. You may want to create your spells
 first, since your items may cast them.

 Use the monk damage chart as a basis for item and spell damage.
 In other words, don't let a sword for a 1st level fighter do 13d8 damage;
 that's equivalent to a monks damage at 32nd level!

 Spells----

 You can print out the codes for the game player(s) or you can
 reveal them through specials.You can make the four letter codes as
 intuitive or abstract as you like.

 If you want to create a spell that a magician cannot cast
 (this would be for monster-only or item-only spells), set the mage level
 to 8. It does not matter what mage class you set the span for.Remember
 that *really* powerful item, monster and trap spells should be level 8,so
 that party members cannot cast them.

 Be careful when setting the Duration.You can create vastly
 different spells simply by changing the duration.Refer to the Duration
 charts included in this manual to determine what effects different
 durations have.You can create some devastating spells, such as a Con-
 tinuous Kill spell.

 There is no list of spells that comes up while playing the game.
 This way you can create "hidden spells" or make your dungeon such that
 the only way mages can learn spells is if you give them the codes through
 specials.

 You do not have to include a spell just because it is possible to
 make it. You may not want spells to summon monsters in your game.It's
 your game; if you don't want to use something, don't put it in the game.

 Monsters----

 You will find that creating a well-balanced scenario resides in
 the creation of monsters.You will undoubtedly find that you will need
 to change the monster values over and over again as you test out your
 dungeon levels.

 Try to match ur spell damage values and item damage values with
 monster hit points.Obviously a monster with 200 hit points will not
 stand a chance vs. weapons and spells doing 1,000 points of damage every
 time they hit.

 Remember that characters' hit points are raised as they gain levels, so
 monsters should increase in difficulty as your dungeon progresses.

 You can give the monsters some intelligence with the combat options
 choice.For example, you could create a monster that would attack every
 round no matter what, even if out of range, or you could have your
 monster breathe every third turn if you wanted.

 Maps----

 Select the most appropriate of wall from the ones available.
 Set the monster difficulty according to when the Players will
 reach this level.Also, if a three level dungeon represents the sewers,
 then all three levels may have the same monster difficulty asthey may
 have the same monsters.But moving to another dungeon level called a
 castle may have an entirely different set

 Monster difficulty is not the only way (nor the BEST way) to make
 levels successively difficult Special encounters, specials, and level
 design are all better ways to control difficulty.

 Create maps and specials according to the spells you have allowed.
 For example, if many of your dungeons have areas you don't want players
 to get into, you may not want to create a phase door spell.

 Very rarely, don't use the trap flag on a special square trap.
 There should be a few traps that can evade spell and thief detection.

 The special square "cast $X for $# gold" where $# equals 0 is great
 for setting traps that fire a spell at the whole party.

 Specials

 What follows is a more detailed description of what each ACTION and
 CONDITIONAL does:

 A special square line is either of the form

 DO action

 which performs the action, or

 IF <condition>
 THEN < action >
 ELSE <action2>

 which tests the condition.If it returns TRUE, then action1 is
 performed, otherwise action2 is performed.

 Input flags are set when the special is defined:

 $I - pick a defined item
 $$ - select a string up to 25 characters long
 $F - select one of 16 flags numbered 0-15
 $# - pick a number from 0 to 32000
 $N - select the name of a defined map
 $P - select a picture
 $S - select a defined special square
 $M - select a defined monster
 $A - select a defined monster's name
 $C - select one of the 13 classes
 $X - select a defined spell
 $T - select a trap type
 $L - give X and Y coordinates, both ranging from 0-21
 $D - select one of the four compass directions

 Conditions:

 "anyone is carrying $I" - return TRUE if at least one
 party member has the item

 "everyone is carrying $I" - return TRUE only if all of
 the party members have the item "$$""

 "last input = return TRUE if the last input received by the
 get input action is equal to $$. Upper and lower case is
 NOT considered different!

 "answer to "$$" is yes" - print $$ and get input from
 the party.Return TRUE if this input is "yes" or my".
 Again, upper and lower case letters are considered
 to be the same.Note that this condition does NOT
 change the last input stored from the get input
 action.

 "local flag $F is set" - return TRUE if the flag is
 set

 "local flag $F is clear" - return TRUE if the flag is
 clear

 "group is facing $D" - return TRUE if the party is
 facing in the specified direction

 "monster named $A is in party" - return TRUE if
 party member is a monster and is named $A

 "class $C is in party" - return TRUE if any party
 member is the specified class

 "it is daytime" - return TRUE if it between 6am
 and 6pm, inclusive.

 "counter > $#" - return TRUE if the counter's
 value is greater than $#

 "counter = $#" - return TRUE if the counter's value
 is equal to $#

 "party won last combat" - return TRUE if the party
 won the last combat initiated by the combat action (NOT
 by a random encounter)

 "global flag $F is set" - return TRUE if the global
 flag is set

 "global flag $F is clear" - return TRUE if the global

 its running effect(occurs each round of the spell duration), and its
 ending effect (occurs when the spell ends). Depending on the duration
 of the spell, the running effect and the end effect may not ever occur!

 Illusions cannot go up levels!

 NOTE: maximum possible experience a member can get is 4,000,000,000

 Extra-damage

 effects:

 Poison - target loses 1 point of damage per round

 Level drain - target loses 1 level, experience set to minimum for
 that level, and spell level is reduced (if necessary)

 Insanity - target will attack members of same group in combat

 Aging - for party members, each stat reduced by 1, to a minimum
 of 1 for monsters, aging acts as a level drain

 Possession - target's mind is controlled.If target is a party
 member: target will attack other party members monster: party can direct
 target's attack

 Stoned - target is petrified.No actions possible.

 Paralysis - target is paralyzed.No actions possible.

 Critical hit - target is slain.

 Item-zot - one of target's carried items loses 5 charges, to a
 minimum of 0.Item selected randomly.

 Point Phaze - target loses 5 magic points, to a minimum of 0

 Spell Point

 Regeneration:
 Spell points regenerate at the rate of 1 point every 5 minutes
 (50 rounds), if the mage is outside in daylight.
 Multiple running spells:

 If several spells are running at once and attempting to affect the
 same target, the result is unpredictable and can change from round to
 round!(Ah ... magic).For example, a long running Age spell and long
 running Youth spell are both cast on a member.Nothing may happen for
 a while, then his stats may start to decrease from age, then they may
 suddenly go back to normal.Remember, magic is not fully predictable.
 Otherwise, it would be science!

 Dispelling summoned monsters/illusions:

 During combat, summoned monsters or illusions disappear only at
 the end of a combat round, even if they are dispelled in the middle of
 the round.It takes a few moments for the ethereal link to dissolve...

 Monsters as party members:

 They act as act actual party members, carrying items and fighting,
 except that they will only use the "Attack" option in combat and will
 never use their ranged attacks for the party.Remember, if another
 party member attacks a monster member, it will immediately become
 hostile and attack, entering intraparty combat if necessary.

 world.

 Star Light Festival

 The small rundown village of Isil Thania is the setting for our story.
 Your band of adventurers has travelled from afar to witness the annual Star
 Light Festival in which an eerie light comes down from a star for one night
 only making the night into day.

 While sitting at the RAINBOW BAR waiting for the day of the Festival,
 a small twisted man approaches saying, "There's more adventure here for
 the brave of heart than meets the eye.If you want a real challenge ask
 the bartender about WINE." With that he giggles and disappears down a
 sewage pipe.

 Your first task will be to locate the RAINBOW BAR to the south of
 the Guild and enter the sewers below the city.Those of you familiar
 with The Bards Tale series will recognize these levels as the exact
 ones found in Bards Tale 1: Tales of the Unknown.

 Good Luck!!!
