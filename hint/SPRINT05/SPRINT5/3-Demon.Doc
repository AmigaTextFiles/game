INTRODUCTION

There are quite a few good 3D rendering packages for the Amiga.

These programs draw, or 'render',  a picture by figuring out how it should
look, given the subject matter, a camera angle, and lighting conditions.

For example,  a rendering program might be told to draw a house from the
vantage point of the driveway, with the primary light source being the sun
at some angle in the sky. The rendering program computes what the scene
should look like, given this information, and creates a painting.

Most of the rendering programs can go one step further and create a sequence of paintings that follow a progression in time. A car might be shown
driving up to the house. Each successive painting shows the car a bit closer.
When these painting are shown in quick succession, the car moves and you
have created an animation.

The subject matter, the items that are rendered in these paintings, are
called "objects". Houses, cars, and people are all examples of objects.

It is obvious that the tasks of designing these objects is a very important
part of the rendering and animation process.

Enter 3-Demon.

3-Demon is an object editor. Use it to create the objects that the other
programs render.

3-Demon is both powerful and easy to use. You can create any shape of 
object with any number of colors, and you work with the mouse extensively
in an intuitive, "What You See Is What You Get", environment.

Once you have created an object, 3-Demon can store it to disk in the various
formats that the other programs read.

THIS MANUAL

Here's a brief overview of how this manual is organized:

The first chapter, Building Blocks in a 3D World covers the fundamentals of working in three dimensions. How things are represented in three
dimensions. How 3-Demon objects are constructed.

Then,  The 3D Environment explains how the 3D world is represented
in 3-Demon. It discusses how objects are displayed by 3-Demon and then

				1

covers how to move around within the 3-Demon environment and alter the
3D view.

The Project Menu covers the commands in the Project menu. These
include opening and saving an entire scene, printing and generating an IFF
picture, and quitting the program.

Editing an Object discusses how to edit an object. This covers all of 
the commands in the Edit menu, with the exception of painting surfaces.
There's so much to how surfaces are used, that this merits a separate chapter, the one that follows, Surfaces.

Although editing in 3-Demon is usually done in a WYSIWYG style, there
can be the need to work with an object in the more traditional, wire frame
blue print mode. This is done in the "Flat Views" screen. The chapter
Flat Views explains how to enter and use Flat Views.

3-Demon can construct one object out of multiple objects. The Object
menu has commands that are used to manipulate entire objects. Moving
them. Combining them. How they interact with each other. And much more.
These are covered in the chapter Working with Objects.

You can create a list of commands that move, scale, and rotate an object
in any way you'd imagine. These are called "Transformations". Although
this is accessed from the Object menu, there's a lot to it, so this has its
own chapter, Transforming an Object.

The chapter Opening and Saving Objects covers how to load and save
objects in the formats the different programs use.

The File Requester explains how to use the 3-Demon file requester for
opening files and saving them to disk.

Command Summary provides a quick reference of all the 3-Demon commands.

We recommend that you read the Tutorial. This is a guided tour of 3-Demon, walking through the process of creating and editing objects.

If you are a programmer and would like to understand 3-Demon's file format, the chapter 3-Demon File Format explains it.

Finally, for reference, there are the Glossary and Index chapters.

				2

BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING...

...make a backup of your 3-Demon disk. You can use the standard WorkBench method to do so:

	Step 1 Stick a blank disk in a drive. If it is unformatted, WorkBench
	       will label it "BAD".

	Step 2 Drag the disk icon for 3-Demon onto the icon for the blank
	       disk.

	Step 3 Once the disk is copied (the blank has been renamed to be
	       "Copy of 3-Demon"), put your 3-Demon master disk in a safe
               place.

The disk is not copy protected, so you can use the copy disk instead of the
original. This also means that if you have a hard disk or recoverable ram
disk, 3-Demon can be copied to that and will run from there.

WHERE DO I START?

Reading the entire manual before doing anything with 3-Demon isn't very
entertaining. Here's a more reasonable plan of attack:

Read Building Blocks in a 3D World and The 3D Environment.
Then head straight for the tutorials. Do them all. As you work through
the tutorials you will find yourself checking back to the other chapters to
resolve questions.

Be inquisitive as you learn. If there's a menu command or a knob or an
icon in a window and you wonder what it does,  go ahead and try it. If a 
tool is displayed, it is there for you to use.

Bon Voyage!

BUILDING BLOCKS IN A 3D WORLD

Before we do anything else, it's a good idea to cover the basics of 3D graphics
and how objects are represented in the 3D world.

THE 3D WORLD

In the real, three dimensional, world outside, things can be described in
terms of their width, height, and depth. And, their position might be
described in terms of how far they are North, East, and Up. For example, 
Harry's refrigerator is 3 feet by 6 feet by 2 feet and we can find it on the
map at three hundred feet North, two hundred feet East, twenty feet Up (in
his tree house), relative to City Hall. When Harry walks out of City Hall, 
he knows he can walk three hundred feet North, two hundred feet East, and
climb twenty feet up a rope to get that bologna sandwich.

What this all says is we can use three numbers to describe where things are
in the three dimensional world. These three numbers tell where a point is
relative to an origin. In the example of Harry's refrigerator, the origin is
City Hall. These three numbers are called the 'coordinates' that describe a
point.

AXES

Imagine three lines running through City Hall. One runs due North. This 
is called the North Axis. One runs Due East. This is the East Axis. And, 
one runs straight up. This is the up axis.

When we give a position as three distances, we are actually giving it in
terms of three distances along the three axes. Harry's refrigerator is 300
feet along the North axis, 200 feet along the East axis, and 20 feet along 
the Up axis.

THE 3-DEMON WORLD

In a 3-Demon's world, the three axes are not called North, East, and Up.
Instead, they are called X, Y, and Z. The origin isn't City Hall, it's just
the center of things, often the center of the screen. Instead of feet, we
just use plain numbers as a unit of measure. So, if the coordinates for
Harry's refrigerator are 300, 200, 20, then it is 300 in the X directions, 200 in
Y direction and 20 in the Z direction.

				4

REPRESENTING OBJECTS IN 3D

The object you create is a recreation of a real world physical entity. Examples of objects would be a cube, a sphere, a chicken.

In the real world,  these objects have mass. To describe them accurately
involves knowing what they are made of on the inside as well as on the
outside. However, if we are only interested in what an object looks like, we
can describe it purely in terms of its outer surface. Yes, a car has an engine
under the hood, but if all we see is the paint job, windows, and wheels, 
that's all we need to know about.

So, as far as graphics programs are concerned, objects are defined not by
what they are in the real world, but by what their outer surface looks like.
These surfaces can be plain and flat, or complex, like swiss cheese.

POLYGONS

We construct this outer surface using polygons. For instance, a polygon
cube is composed of six squares, one square for each of the cube's six sides.

A red cube is made of six red squares, one for each side.

				5

POINTS

But how is a polygon described? The best way to describe it is as a set of
connecting points. A square is made up of four points.

Now we need to describe a point. This is where all the talk about defining
a position in 3D space comes in. A point is defined by three coordinates -
one for each of the three axes X, Y,  and Z.

If we were to construct Harry's refrigerator out of polygons, the front bottom left hand corner would have a point at 300, 200, 20. The right front
bottom corner would be at 300, 203, 20.

Fortunately, although all the points can be defined as X, Y, and Z numbers, 
3-Demon never requires that you deal with these numbers directly. Instead, 
you can simply grab a point with the mouse and move it. After all, when
Harry had Whabam Bros Moving put the fridge in his tree house, he didn't
say, "Put it at 330, 200, 20." He said, "Put it in the tree house. Don't forget
to hook up the ice maker."

So, a polygon is made up of a bunch of points. When one of the points is
moved, the polygon's shape changes. This is how objects are edited in
3-Demon.

TRIANGLES

There is a problem with polygons. It has to do with moving a point in a
polygon. If a point that is part of a polygon moves out of the plane of the
polygon, it creates a strangely twisted polygon moves out of the plane of the
polygon, it creates a strangely twisted polygon. Say that a sheet of paper
resting on your desk is a polygon. It has four points, one for each corner. If
you move one of the points by lifting a corner of the page up off the desk, 
the paper bends. You can, however, crease the paper between to opposite
corner points to create two triangles, each of which is flat. Then, if you
move the same point, the two triangles on either side of the crease will stay
flat. In fact, you can move any of the points and the two triangles will stay
flat.

Triangles are magic. You can move any point of a triangle without creating
a 'twisted' triangle. So, once you've broken a polygon into triangles, you
are safe to move any points.

Since 3-Demon places so much emphasis on editing points, given the magic
of triangles, it makes sense to outlaw all polygons larger than triangles.
Larger polygons can simply be build out of triangles.

				6

So, 3-DEMON does not talk about building objects our of polygons. Instead, 
3-Demon works with triangles.

BACK FACES

There are two sides, or faces, to a triangle, just as there are two sides to a
piece of paper. Normally, when you are building an object out of triangles, 
all of the inward faces will never be seen. It is the outward faces that are
given colors and are drawn. For example, we build a sphere out of triangles.
Each triangle has two sides. One faces out, it represents the surface of the 
sphere. The other side of the triangle faces in. Nobody can see it. This
inward side is called a 'back face'. With an object like our sphere, there is
no need to display the back face.

There are times when you might want to display back faces. You could
have a triangle floating free in space.

3-Demon has several tools for working with back faces. You decide if you
wish to see the back faces. You can flip the back face of a triangle to the
front. And, you can add a triangle that covers the back face of a triangle
with a front facing triangle.

LINES

In addition to triangles, you can work with straight lines in your object. A
line has two end points.

SHARED POINTS

Several triangles and lines can share a single point. This has a powerful use.
When a shared point is moved, all triangles and lines that use the same point 
will change shape as the shared point is moved to a new location.

SURFACES

As you build objects with 3-Demon, you will want to paint them. You can 
select a color for the surface of each triangle that makes up an object. In
addition, you can describe how that color behaves. How does it reflect
light? Is it transparent?

				7

Each object owns a set of surfaces. Each triangle, line, and point that make
up this object is painted with one of these surfaces.

Example surfaces might be "red brick", "steel", and "toe nail".

THE OBJECT HIERARCHY

Often, an object will have a moving part. For example, Bruno the dog has
a tail. It is easier to make Bruno's tail wag if it is a separate object, even
though it is attached to old Bruno. However, when Bruno moves, the tail
has to move with him. as a separate object, it won't.

It would be nice if there were some relationship between the two objects
that said when Bruno moves, the tail moves with him, but when the tail
moves, Bruno doesn't move with the tail.

Such a relationship doesn't exist. There is the HIERARCHY of objects. One
object can belong to another object. Using this capability, we have the tail
object belong to the Bruno object.

An object that belongs to another object is often called its child. And, the
object which owns this child is called the parent. A parent object can have
any number of children. Each child can, in turn, have its own children.

				8

THE 3D ENVIRONMENT

Before you start to make objects, it would be a good idea to discuss the
3-Demon environment - how you, the artist, interface with the three dimensional object you are creating.

THE MAIN VIEW

When Pierre the sculptor fashions a lump of clay, he has to see exactly
what he is doing. If there is a particular part that he wishes to work on, 
he moves the clay around so that he sees that part. Naturally, he orients
himself so that the view gives him the best possible feedback of what he is
doing with his hands.

For example, when working hard on a bust of his favorite sculptor, he feels
the need to make the nose just a little less prominent. To get the best view
of what he is about to do, he turns the bust sideways so he is looking at
the face in profile. Then, as he scrapes at the nose with a scalpel he can
see exactly what he is doing.

You can see that if he were to reshape the nose while looking at the bust
head on, he would have a very hard time gauging what he is doing. The
length of the nose would be represented by how far from Pierre it is rather
than how wide. From a side view, though, he can easily gauge the length
of the nose.

				9

3-Demon works much the same way. You are a sculptor creating an object.
You can view the object you are working on from any angle so that what
you see is really what the object looks like.

This rendition of the object is called the Main View. It occupies most of
3-Demon's screen.

As you work on the object, you are free th change your orientation so that
you can see the object from whatever angle makes the most sense, much
like Pierre walking around his lump of clay.

				10

And, where Pierre uses his fingers to push and prod the clay, you use the
mouse to perform the same task.

Sadly, there's nothing that takes the place of that gallon of cheap table wine
that Pierre always has on hand for inspiration.

Editing tends to be straightforward because you see what you are doing.

If you are working on that bust of Pierre and recognize that the nose really
should be more prominent, you position the bust so it is in profile (just as
he did) facing right, then drag the nose right, extending it.

When moving points, orient yourself so that the points will be moving up
and down, right and left.

Similarly, when painting, you orient yourself so you can see the parts you 
wish to color. Then you click on a triangle to give it a selected color.

The whole process of creating and editing a three dimensional object in
3-Demon involves moving the object around to get a good view of it, then
working within that view.

THE DEPTH VIEW

Pierre knows how far away the piece of clay he is working on is because he's
got his arm extended. We don't have that physical feedback because our
mouse is purely two dimensional.

When we create a new point, it is not enough to just point and click with the
mouse. This only tells us where the new point is in up-down and left-right
coordinates. What it doesn't say is how far away the point is.

So, an additional view is provided that will show us how far away the parts
we are working on are and let us specify how far away new additions should
be.

				11

The Depth View shows how far away everything is. And, with the Depth
View, you can specify the distance you wish to work at.

The Depth View exists to the right of the Main View at the top of the
3-Demon screen.

We will learn how to use the Depth View later in this chapter.

So, we've got a Main View where we do all our work and a Depth View
that helps us deal with depth.

The rest of this chapter is a tour of the 3-Demon commands that manipulate
the two views. It would be a good idea to have 3-Demon running while you
read this.

MOVING AROUND

At the bottom right hand side of the 3-Demon screen is a set of buttons
that can be used to navigate around the objects you are working on.

ROTATE COUNTERCLOCKWISE

				12

This rotates the view counterclockwise by 45 degrees.

ROTATE UP

This rotates the view up 45 degrees.
This is like walking under the view, the objects turn up over you.

ROTATE CLOCKWISE

This rotates the view clockwise by 45 degrees.

ROTATE LEFT

This rotates the view left by 45 degrees. This is like walking around the
right side of the view, since the object is turning to the left as you go by.

ROTATE CENTER

				13

This resets your viewing angle, placing you at the start position with no
rotations.

ROTATE RIGHT

This rotates the view to the right by 45 degrees. This is like flying around
the left side of the view, the objects turn to the right as you move by.

MEMORIZE ANGLE

This simply memorizes your present position. You can return to it later
with the Recall Angle button (See below).

ROTATE DOWN

This rotates the view down by 45 degrees. The objects rotate down, so we
end up seeing more of the top, as if we were flying over the objects in the
view.

RECALL ANGLE

				14

This returns the view to the position set with the Memorize Angle button.

Rotate Left-Right 

This is a knob that you can drag to change your viewing angle. It performs
the same work as the Rotate Left and Rotate Right buttons, but it allows
you to turn the view by any amount, rather than being restricted to 45
degree increments.

Imagine a vertical axis running through the center of the view, from top to
bottom. Turning this knob spins us around this axis.

Rotate Up-Down Knob

This knob performs the same work as the Rotate Up and Rotate Down
buttons, but it allows you to turn the view by any amount, rather than
being restricted to 45 degrees.

Imagine a horizontal axis running through the center of the view, from left
to right. Turning this knob spins us around this axis.

Rotate Clockwise-Counterclockwise

The 3D Environment

				15

This knob performs the same work as the Rotate Clockwise and Rotate
Counterclockwise buttons, but it allows you to turn the view by any amount, 
rather than being restricted to 45 degrees.

Turning this knob spins us around the center of the picture. Turn the knob
clockwise and the picture turns clockwise by the same amount.

CHANGING THE PERSPECTIVE

To create the effect of perspective, 3-Demon uses two pieces of information:
The position of an imaginary eye and the position of an imaginary screen.
3-Demon computes what an object would look like as seen from the position
of the eye, and draws that on the screen. Imagine that the eye is an X-Ray source, shining through the object. The X-Ray image of the object is
projected on the screen.

An object that is closer to the eye will "project" larger on the screen.

3-Demon lets you reposition the eye and screen. To the right of the Depth
View are two icons that can be dragged up and down.

The Eye

This represents the position of the eye. Move it close to the object and
things get very distorted, much like a fish eye lens. Objects that are close
are drawn very large, while far away objects stay small. If the Eye is far
from the object, it behaves much more like a telephoto lens. In this case, 
objects that are close are drawn just about the same size as objects that
are far.

The Screen

				16

This represents the position of the imaginary screen the objects are 'projected' onto.

Play with the eye and screen icons around to see how they affect they view.

Shifting and Scaling the View

You can also shift the center of the display away from the origin. And, you
can change the scale of the view.

As it turns out, neither of these need to be done often, if at all, so their
commands are only available on request. To access them, go to the View 
menu and select the View Control Box option in the Display menu item.

A window will open up in the bottom left hand corner of the screen.

This is the View Control Box. It can be turned on and left running or shut
down at anytime. It has the commands to shift and scale the view.

Scale

This changes the display size of the viewed objects. All the way to the right
and they are full size. Drag it to the left to make them appear smaller.

				17

This does not actually change the size of the objects. It only changes the
drawing scale.

X Shift

Drag this to the right to move the center of the world to the right. Once
again, this is not moving the objects themselves to the right. Instead, it is
moving where we are looking to the left, so everything appears to move to
the right.

Y Shift

Drag this to the right to move the center of the world up. Once again, this
is not moving the objects themselves, only shifting our view.

Z Shift

Drag this to the right to move the center of the world closer to the viewer
 (the eye).

Notice that each time you change one of these the Main and Depth views
are refreshed. If you close the View Control Box, the changes made will not
be lost.

				18

Distance and Grab Range

When you add new triangles or lines to your object, you need to say how
far away they are in depth. The vertical and horizontal positions are given
by the mouse, but the depth is not.

So, using the Depth View, we specify the depth. In addition to the Eye
and Screen icons, there are two more icons that can be slid up and down.
These are the Distance and Grab Range sliders.

The Distance Slider

Drag this to determine the depth that new parts are placed at. Think of it
as a sheet of glass that can be dragged between you and the screen. New
points are painted on this sheet of glass. But, when the sheet of glass moves
again, the points stay where they are, they don't move with it.

Notice that the Distance Slider is accompanied by a solid black line through
the Depth View to show where it lies.

The Grab Range Slider

In the Depth View both the top and the bottom of the display have a
pattern of white dots masking the picture. What these say is that anything
under the white dotes can not have their points moved. Only points between
the two banks of dots can be grabbed. The area between is called the Grab
Range. The Grab Range makes editing easier because it lets you isolate
only the portions of the view that you wish to edit.

This slider sets the Grab Range:

				19

This sets the two sides of the Grab Range. This is done by having the Grab
Range be centered on the Distance slider.

Play with the two sliders to see how you can manipulate the Grab Range.
Notice that only the points of the test object that are within the Grab
Range are illuminated.

THE DEPTH CONTROL BOX

Sometimes, it would be useful to give precise numbers for the Drag Range, 
Distance, Eye, and Screen. To access these a window that lets you edit
these, go to the View menu and select the Depth Control Box option in
the Display command.

A window should open up in the bottom left hand corner of the screen.

This is the Depth Control Box. Like the View Control Box, it can be turned
on and left running or shut down at any time. Whenever one of the sliders is
grabbed, the number in the Depth Control Box is updated. And, whenever
you edit one of the four in the Depth Control Box, the sliders are updated
and the picture redrawn.

If you close the Depth Control Box, the changes made will not be lost.

				20

ALTERING THE DRAW STYLE

You can control how 3-Demon draws an object in the Main View. The rendering of points, triangles, and the triangle edges can be selectively turned
on and off. The drawing of triangle back faces can also be turned on and 
off. And, you can decide whether objects be drawn as shaded gray objects, 
or in color without shading.

The commands to set the draw style are found in the Draw Style menu
item of the View menu.

EDGES

This flag determines whether the edges of triangles should be drawn. When
it is off, the triangles appear borderless. When it is on, they are drawn in
black if they belong to an object that is currently being worked on or white
if they belong to any other object.

If Edges are turned on, but Triangles are turned off, you end up with a 
wire frame display which has the one slight advantage of taking a little less
time to draw.

POINTS

This determines whether the points should be drawn. Only the points of
the object selected that are within the Grab Range are drawn. If you find
the points obnoxious to look at, turn them off. However, they are useful for
editing because they indicate where the points that you can drag are.

				21

TRIANGLES

This selects whether triangles should be filled or not.  If they aren't,  you
get a wire frame object (or nothing if Edges is also turned off).

BACK FACES

Every triangle has two faces. Normally, only the face we are intended to
see is shown. When you create a triangle by drawing it, the side facing
you is automatically set to be the front face. If you then move around to 
view it from the back, you see the back face. With solid objects, like cubes
spheres, and chickens, you never see the back faces because they always face
the inside of the object.

By default, back faces are not displayed for two reasons. Displaying them
doubles the display time on the average. And, it's possible for slight errors
in the display of an object to occur because a back face managers to stomp
on a front face.

There aren't too many reasons to display back faces, because there are two
commands in the Edit menu that take care of most issues. One command
creates a front face to cover a triangle's back face. The other flips a
triangle so the two faces are reversed.

But, there will always be some sneak who wants to snoop around behind 
things, so the option to display back faces is available.

SHADED

This gives you the option of having the objects drawn shaded. The primary
purpose of this is to give a better feel for the three dimensional nature of
an object. Here is an object drawn shaded and unshaded:

				22

There are limitations to the shading. There are no colors. Instead, each
object is drawn on a gray scale ranging from white to black. And, the light
sources can not be positioned. There are two lights at opposite sides of each 
object. This guarantees that we don't have one side shaded and the other
side in the dark.

But, the purpose of this is really to give a feel for the depth of the object, which can make editing easier. 3-Demon's objective is to make object
editing as easy as possible, not to do fancy rendering.

DISPLAY SELECTION

The Display item in the View menu lets you make some choices about what 
is displayed.

				23

FLAT VIEWS

You can call up a new screen that views an object as two 'flat' views.
These lack perspective,  so parts of the object that are close are of the same 
scale as parts that are far away. And,  the objects are drawn as wire frames.

The left view displays the object as seen from the top, the right shows it
from the side. This is like looking at a set of blue prints of the object, as
opposed to a photograph. The blue prints are great for exact measurement
and calibrating points. The photograph (the Main View) gives a better feel
for what the object really looks like.

See the chapter "Flat Views" for more on how to use the screen.

DEPTH VIEW

This is used to turn on and off the Depth View display. If you aren't using 
the Depth View (some tasks, like painting the surfaces on triangles, don't
require depth information), you can turn it off from here. With it turned
off, the Depth View simply won't be updated each time the Main View is.
This can save quire a bit of time if you are working with large objects.

VIEW CONTROL BOX

We already talked about this one. This controls the opening and closing of
the Edit Control Window, the one with the Scale and Shift sliders.

				24

DEPTH CONTROL BOX

And, we also talked about this one. This controls the opening and closing of
the Depth Control Window, the one with the numeric inputs for Distance, 
Grab Range,  Eye and Screen.

DISPLAYED REFERENCES

Reference, the third menu item in the View menu, lets you turn on and
off three types of reference displays.

ORIGIN OBJECT

This creates an object that is shaped like the three axes, X, Y and Z. Use
this to keep track of how you, and the objects you are working with, are
oriented.

				25

Because it is an object, it rotates with the rest of the objects when you
move around the view. In fact, all operations that can be done on objects 
can be done to this.

If the Origin Object already exists, this command removes it.

GRID OBJECT

This creates an object that is a wire frame grid. You can use it to calibrate
objects you are editing. Since it is an object, it can be edited, copied
combined into other objects, etc.

If the Grid Object already exists, this command removes it.

GRID

This puts up a reference grid that is displayed behind all drawn objects.
The grid is not an object. It does not rotate with the rest of the objects.
Instead, it stays constant.

				26

When you select the Grid, it opens a requester asking how far apart the
grid lines would be.

Because of perspective distortion, objects closer to the Eye will appear
larger than objects at the back, which might make the grid somewhat meaningless. But, the grid is displayed as if it were placed at the distance set by
the Distance Slider (remember that sheet of glass?). Since new points are
always placed at that distance,  it works great for adding points.

If you are editing points that already exist, slide the Distance icon to the
depth of the point you are working on, and the grid will be correct. For
more accuracy, use the Depth Control Window to set the distance. Or, if
a little error is acceptable, just move the Eye down to the bottom of the
screen. This results in the least possible perspective distortion.

And, if you are really looking for accuracy, go to the Flat Views screen.
That's what it's for.

MOUSE COORDINATES

You can have 3-Demon display mouse coordinates in the upper left hand
corner of the Main View. The fourth menu item in the View menu, Mouse
Coordinates, selects this.

				27

There are four options. There are three different mouse coordinate modes
and the option to turn off mouse coordinates.

Because we are dealing with three dimensions and the orientation of both an
object and the viewer might be skewed, there are different ways to interpret
and display the position of the mouse.

WORLD RELATIVE COORDINATES

If you are moving objects around or doing any operations where you need
to know the relation of one object to another, you probably want to know
what the coordinates are relative to the world the objects reside in. No
matter what angle you look at an object from and no matter which object
it is,  a point in three dimensional space will remain constant.

OBJECT RELATIVE COORDINATES

If you are editing an object, you will probably want to know what the
coordinates are relative to the object itself. So, no matter what angle you
look at an object from and no matter how you might move that object, the
coordinates of all points in that object should stay constant.

				28

VIEW RELATIVE COORDINATES

Finally, you may wish to have the coordinates relative to the Main View.
No matter how you look at things, X is always left to right, Y is bottom to
top, and Z is front to back.

				29

THE PROJECT MENU

The far left menu is the Project menu. This has commands that mostly
pertain to the 3-Demon working environment. This working environment
is composed of all of the objects that are loaded at one time and display
parameters, such as the Distance and Eye sliders, that control how the
objects are viewed. This working environment is called the "scene."

With the exception of About all commands have something to do with the
scene.

NEW

Use this command to clear the scene. If there are any objects, they are
deleted.

OPEN

This command opens a complete scene from disk to work with. Like the
New command, any objects that are currently in the scene are thrown away.

After you select this command, a file requester will open. It will only display
the names of scenes that have been saved. Select the scene to load. For
more on how to use the file requester, see the chapter The File Requester.

				30

SAVE

This command saves the complete scene to disk. All objects are saved, as
is all display information. If you wish to leave a 3-Demon project and come
back to it later, save the scene with this command. Later, use the Open
command to pick up where you left off.

Once you have selected the Save command, a file requester will open. Use
it to select the name of the file requester, see the chapter The File Requester.

SAVE IFF

This creates an IFF picture file. The picture in the Main View is saved.
Since most Amiga paint programs read this format, this means you can save
the image you are looking at and load it into a paint program.

What is being saved is purely a two dimensional picture. All information
describing the objects, surfaces, etc., is no longer part of the data.

PRINT

Like the Save IFF command, this takes the picture in the Main View, but
sends it to the printer instead of a file.

Make sure you have a printer connected and Preferences set for that printer
before you use this.

QUIT

Parting is such sweet sorrow. It's getting late and you have to show up to
work early in the morning. Select this command to leave 3-Demon.

Naaah, call in sick!

				31

EDITING AN OBJECT

This chapter covers the tools 3-Demon provides for editing an individual
object. All of the options for creating, moving, painting, and deleting the
triangles, lines, and points that make up an object are explained.

All of the commands that pertain to editing an object can be found in the
Edit menu.

But first, we need to select an object to edit.

SELECTING AN OBJECT

Only one object can be edited at a time. If there is an object loaded that
you wish to edit, you must make sure that it is the one selected for editing.

To select an object for editing, go to the Object menu, select the Select
command, and click on the object you wish to edit. Notice that the object
that is selected for editing has its edges all drawn in black, while the other
objects have their edges drawn in white.

If the object you wish to edit isn't loaded, select the Open command in the
Object menu and load that object. It will automatically be the selected
object.

Finally, you may very well wish to start from scratch and create an object.
If there are no objects displayed, you need do no more. 3-Demon makes
sure there is always an object available to work on. If there are none, it
will create one and make it selected for editing. Although you can't see this
object because it has no triangles or lines, you can start creating.

Otherwise, if there are objects in existence but you wish to start a new
one, you can ask 3-Demon to create a new object with either the New or
New Child commands in the Object menu. The New command creates an 
object that is at the same position in the object HIERARCHY as the currently
selected object. The New Child command creates an object that is the child
of the currently selected object. In either case, the newly created object
becomes the selected object and you are now free to edit it.

Notice that objects created with the New and New Child commands have
a small gray triangle in the top left corner of the view. This provides a
handle on this object, since without any triangles or lines there would be
no way to select this object for any of the operations in the Object menu.

				32

ADDING TRIANGLES

The simplest mode of construction is building with triangles.

To build triangles, select the Triangles command in the Add sub menu.

The mouse pointer should turn into a hammer. To create a triangle, simply
click on the screen in three places, the corners of the triangle. A triangle
will be drawn. Create a second triangle as a complete separate set of three
points, or use some of the points that went into the construction of the first.
It's a good idea to have adjacent triangles share points along their border.
This sticks them together so that if they are edited later, by moving the
shared points, they say adjacent.

Here are two triangles that share two points:

				33

DEPTH

The dimensions of the triangle are determined by the coordinates of the
mouse each time you click to create a point and by the depth of the Distance
slider as shown in the Depth View. If you want the triangles to be closer, 
drag the Distance slider down, drag it up to make the triangles farther.

MOUSE COORDINATES

You might turn on the display of mouse coordinates to help show where each
point is placed. Turn it on with the Mouse Coordinates command in the
View menu. Select the Object option, this displays the coordinates in
the coordinate system of the object, which makes the most sense for what
you are doing.

CHANGE THE VIEW

After you have created a side of your object, turn the view so you can create
another face. Do this with any of the rotation buttons or knobs in the lower
right hand side. Notice how the Depth View rotates as well. You probably 
should also adjust the Distance slider to where you want the new face to
lie.

Create some more triangles.

SHARING POINTS

Once again, you can create triangles that share points with other already
existing triangles. In particular, you may wish to connect a triangle with a
triangle that you created at a different angle. If the point of the triangle
you wish to attach to is within the grab range (set by the Grab Range slider), 
it will be drawn as a square. Points out of range are not drawn. You can

When you connect with a point that already exists, the coordinate of that 
point remain unchanged. This means that if you connect with a point that
is at a different distance, the triangle will bend back to that point. This
gives you the ability to easily "connect the dots" between triangles drawn
on different planes.

				34

POLYGONS

As you may have noticed, there is an option in the Add menu called Polygons. It doesn't actually give you polygons, rather a quick method to create
a bunch of triangles strung together to fill out a polygon.

With this option, you click points as you did with triangles, but you continue
after the first three, clicking along the outline of the polygon. Complete the
polygon by clicking on the first point.

LINES

You can also create lines. These are simply two points connected by a line.
Select the Lines command. Creating lines follows all of the same rules as
creating triangles, just click twice instead of three times.

SPINNING AN OBJECT

This is a fun one. With this you can draw an outline and have it spun
around the axis created by the line between the first and last point.

When you select the Spun command,  a requester opens asking how many
sides there should be to this spun object.

				35

Select the number of sides you want, then start to draw the outline. Once
again, you draw points by clicking with the mouse. Each new point is
connected to the last with a line. If you'd like to abort, move a point, or
tell 3-Demon to spin the object, click on one of the points you have already
put down. A pop up menu will appear.

Select the option you'd like. If you select Move Points, the mouse pointer
will turn into a magnet. You can then drag points to new locations. When
you wish to stop moving points, click somewhere where there isn't a point
and the pop up menu will appear again. This time, select Add Points
to go back to building the outline.

If you select the Abort option, the outline you have drawn so far is thrown
away.

If you select the Spin It option, 3-Demon will go ahead and spin the object.

Unlike adding triangles, lines, and polygons, spinning creates a new object, 
rather than sticking it into the one you are working on. This is to provide
extra flexibility. Usually, after creating a spun object, you need to move it
a bit before joining it with the other parts of whatever you are working on.
By keeping it separate, you can manuever it easily with the commands in
the Object menu. When done, there is a command in the Object menu to
combine two objects into one.

You can create a spun object with the Main View positioned at any angle.
However, they are often easiest to work with if the angle is zeroed first (the
center button).

CREATING A SLICED OBJECT

After the Spun command in the Add sub menu is Sliced. With this, you
draw an outline, as you would do when spinning an object. It then takes

				36

this outline, fills it in, and creates a stack of these at a depth that you
define. You can use this to create raised letters, for example.

When you select this command, a requester opens asking how many slices
you want and how far apart they should be spaced.

The distance apart times the number of slices ends up being the total depth
of the object. 

Once again, you draw points by clicking with the mouse. Each new point
is connected to the last with a line. If you'd like to abort, move a point, 
or tell 3-Demon to add a slice, click on one of the points you put down. A
pop up menu will appear:

		Add Points
		Move Points
		Add A Slice
		Abort

Select the option you'd like. If you select Move Points, the mouse pointer
will turn into a magnet. You can then drag points to new locations. To
return to adding points, click somewhere where there is no point and the 
pop up menu will appear. Select Add Points to continue adding to the
outline.

				37

If you select the Abort option, the outline you have drawn so far is thrown 
away.

If you select the Add A Slice option, 3-Demon will go ahead and add a
slice. If this is the first time, it will fill in the outline and create the
sides of the slice. If this is the last time, it will fill in the top to
complete the slice. If this is any time in the middle, between the first and
last slices, it will add another slice, building towards you. Notice that the
Distance slider moves with it. When the object is completed, the Distance slider
returns to its original position.

The reason to have multiple slices is you can edit them as the slice grows.
For example, you could use this to build a banana. Start with a group of
closely spaced points, then pull them outward with the first few slices, then
back in as you reach the tip.

You can always move the depth slider yourself to influence the height of
each slice.

Turning the view while building a sliced object creates an object that twists
and turns with you.

Like spinning an object, slicing creates a new object. If you wish to put it
into something you're working on, use the Combine command in the Object
menu.

ADDING BACK FACES

Every triangle has two faces. However, only one is to be displayed. Usually, 
the second face (called the 'back face') faces into an object and should not
be displayed. However, there are times when you need to see the other side
of a triangle.

The last command in the Add sub menu is Back Faces. After selecting
it, simply click on all of the triangles that you'd like to see the back faces
of. For each of these, a new triangle will be created, facing in the opposite
direction, so now there are two triangles back to back.

DELETING TRIANGLES AND LINES

The second command in the Edit menu is Delete. Use it to remove unwanted triangles and lines. After selecting this command, click on the
triangles and lines you want removed. Remember you can rotate around

				38

the object to get at triangles on the other side. To delete a triangle, click
somewhere in it. To remove a line, click somewhere on the line.

MOVING POINTS

The third item in the Edit menu, Move is used to grab points or groups of
points and drag them to new positions, stretching the triangles and lines
connected to them.

		EDIT
		~~~~
		ADD
		DELETE
		MOVE	POINTS
			GROUP
		SURFACE

There are two options. The first, Points lets you grab a point and drag it.
The second, Group lets you draw a box around a group of points and drag
all of them.

When you select one of the options, a requester opens:

This selects the magnetism of the point or points you are moving. All the
way to the left is no magnetism. All the way to the right is a magnet so
strong it could have been made with superconductors. If a point is
magnetic, points near it will be influenced by its movement and move some, 

				39

too. This gives an elastic feel to the object. If there is no magnetism, only
the selected point or points will move.

DRAGGING A GROUP

If you had selected Group, the mouse pointer will turn into a small rectangle
with an arrow in it. This indicates that you are to draw the box. Click
where you want the top left corner to be, then drag down and over for the
bottom right corner. Let up when you have defined a box that captures the
points you wish to move. All of the points that were illuminated (within
the Grab Range) will be dragged.

The mouse pointer will then turn into a magnet. Click anywhere on the
screen (though it makes the most sense to click in the box) and drag the
mouse. All of the points within the box will move with the box. If magnetism has been turned on, other points close to the box will also move.
When you let up from the mouse, the pointer turns into the little box again
and you are ready to define another box.

It's important to understand what's going on with the Grab Range. This is
the range of points that can be grabbed to drag. If the rendering of points
has been turned on (it makes a lot of sense to do so when moving points)
only those points that are illuminated will be in the drag box. To alter
the grab range, move the Distance and Grab Range sliders on the right.
The Distance slider sets the center of the grab range, while the Grab Range
slider sets the range forward and back that can be grabbed. The grab range
is displayed in the Depth View as everything between the two fog banks
 (patterns of while dots) at top and bottom of the display.

DRAGGING INDIVIDUAL POINTS

This is simpler than dragging groups of points because there is just one
mode, you don't flip between grabbing points and dragging them. Simply
click on a point with the mouse and drag it to a new position. If there is
magnetism, points near the selected one will move with it. This is displayed
with rubberbanding lines, so you know what's going on.

As with dragging groups of points, only points within the Grab Range can
be grabbed to drag, so adjust the Distance and Grab Range sliders to the
right of the Depth View appropriately.

Remember that you can constantly change your point of view while working
with the Move command. Changing the view angle will change the direction

				40

of movement since the plane of the window that you are dragging along
always faces you.

SURFACES

As you may know, each object can have a set of different surfaces. A surface
describes the color and reflective properties to paint the triangle with.

By default, each object is given a set of five surfaces which you can change.
Until you make a different selection, the first color in that set is used to
paint the triangles you create.

ACCESSING THE SURFACES

To design surfaces for an object and select which ones to paint with, there
is a window, the Surface window. To open it, select one of the options in
the Surface sub menu:

TRIANGLES Edit the surfaces for this object and use a surface you select to
          paint triangles.
    LINES Edit the surfaces for this object and use a surface you select to
	  paint lines.
   POINTS Edit the surfaces for this object and use a surface you select
	  to paint end points. Some rendering programs want the color
	  information stored in the points that border triangles, rather
	  than in the triangles themselves.
   OBJECT Edit the surfaces for this object and use a surface you select
	  to paint the entire object. This is slightly different from the
	  previous three commands. This command lets you paint an
	  entire object with one sweep of the brush. All of the Triangles, 
 	  Lines, and Points are painted at once.

Most often, you will choose the triangle option.

PAINTING WITH SURFACES

Once the Surface window has been opened, you can go ahead and paint
your object. To paint, simply click on the item you wish to paint, and it
will be filled with the selected surface color.

				41

So, if you had selected to paint triangles from the Surface submenu, clicking
on triangles will change their surfaces. If you had selected to paint lines, 
clicking on lines will change their surfaces. And, had you selected to paint
points, clicking on points will change their surface. You can also select the
points to paint by clicking on the triangles or lines that they define. Click
on a triangle and all three corner points are painted at once.

The Object option is simply a method for painting an entire object in one
fell swoop. With this, each time you select a surface in the Surface window, 
the entire object is given that surface, triangles, lines, and points.

The Surface window is very large and probably obstructs the view of the 
object being painted. You can resize it to get it out of the way (but still
be able to select other surfaces) or completely close the window down and
continue painting. As long as the mouse pointer remains a paint brush
(which will be the case until you select a new command from the menu), 
you will be able to paint.

For a much more complete discussion of surfaces, see the chapter Surfaces.

DIVIDING TRIANGLES

Sometimes you'll have an object that needs a higher degree of definition in
one area. For example, you could create a head with the spin tool. Some
parts of the resulting object would need more resolution, in particular the
eyes and mouth. The solution is to subdivide the triangles in these areas
so you have more to work with.

The Divide command in the Edit menu does this. After selecting it, click
on the triangles you want subdivided. Each triangle you click on will be
broken down into three triangles:

				42

QUANATIZING

Quanatization is a powerful tool for cleaning up slop in an object. What it
does is resolve a point to an imaginary grid. You set the spacing of the
lines in that grid. This spacing is also called the resolution. When a point
is quanatized,  it is shifted to the closest cross point in that grid. Here's a
triangle before and after Quanatization:

You can quanatize points to any resolution.

Quanatization in 3-Demon is complicated by the fact that you may wish to
quanatize with the reference grid being positioned in the coordinate system
of the object,  the world,  or the view.

So, when you select the quanatize command,  you are given three reference 
options: World,  Object,  and View,  with a fourth option to simply turn off
Quanatization,  Off.

If you choose Object,  points you quanatize will be quanatized against a grid
that is also positioned within that object. If you have scaled or rotated the
object with a transformation list*, these will not effect the Quanatization.

If you choose World,  the Quanatization will be based on world coordinates, 
rather than the coordinates of the object itself. If the object has no transformations applied to it,  the result will be the same as with the Object
command. But,  if the object has been altered by some transformations
(you have created a transformation list for it that rotates, scales, or moves
it), the Quanatization will be applied to the result of those transformations, 
rather than the object itself.

*The use of transformations is covered later in its own chapter. Don't be
concerned if you don't know what a transformation is.

				43

Finally, the View option uses a Quanatization grid that is oriented to the
view. The Quanatization is lined up with the angle that you view the object
from. Rotate, scale, or shift the view,  and the Quanatization changes with
it.
For the first three choices, a window opens letting you set the Quanatization.
Then, you select the points and triangles to quanatize simply by clicking on
them. If you click on a point,  it alone will be quanatized. If you click on a
triangle,  the three points at its border will be quanatized.

QUANATIZING NEW POINTS

After you are done QUANATIZING,  the Quanatization will stay in effect unless
you turn it off. If you go back to adding new points,  and the new points
will be quanatized.
So, if you'd rather not have that happen, remember to turn Quanatization
off with the Off command.

FLIPPING A TRIANGLE

Triangles can only face in one direction. There's a front face that is intended
to be seen and a back face that points inward. Sometimes, the front and
back faces need to be swapped.

The Flip command in the Edit menu will flip a triangle so that its front
and back faces are swapped. Select the command, then click on all of the
triangles that need to be flipped.

Click twice on a triangle and it remains unchanged since it has flipped twice.

This command is very useful for loading files that were created with Sculpt
3d. Sculpt triangles can face in either direction. As a result, about half of
them face the wrong way. Use this to flip the errant triangles to face out.

COMBINING POINTS

The Combine command in the Edit menu combines two points into one.

When using it, select the first point. Then, select the second point that you
want to merge it with. The two points become one and all of the triangles
and lines that use the two points now share the one.

Then, select another first point, etc...

				44

This is handy for "sewing" up the seam between objects that are being
combined.

				45

SURFACES

As you build objects with 3-Demon, you will want to paint them. You can
select a color for each triangle, line, and point that makes up an object. In
addition, you can describe how that color behaves. How does it reflect 
light? Is it transparent?

So, there is a need to describe both the color and how it behaves. All this
information in bundled into something called a "surface".

You can assign surfaces to triangles, lines, and points.

Each object owns a set of surfaces and each triangle, line, and point within
that object is painted with one of these surfaces.

For example, an object made of bricks and steel would have two surfaces
defined. One, called "red brick", would describe a red color and the surface characteristics of brick (opaque, matte finish, etc.) The other surface, 
called "steel", would be gray and highly reflective. All triangles painted
brick would have the brick surface selected. The steel triangles would have
the steel surface selected. Should new triangles that are made of glass be
added to the object, a surface describing glass would be added to the set of
surfaces, and the glass triangles would select it.

THE SURFACE WINDOW

To design, edit, and name surfaces for an object, use the Surface Window.
And, when painting surfaces onto triangles, lines, and points, the Surface
Window serves as a palette. With it open you can choose surfaces while
you paint.

To open the Surface Window, select the Surface command in the Edit 
menu.

				46

There are four options:

Triangles  Edit the surfaces for this object and us a surface you select to
	   paint triangles.
Lines	   Edit the surfaces for this object and use a surface you select to
	   paint lines. These are the lines that you create with the Lines
	   option in the Add menu, not the borders of triangles.
Points	   Edit the surfaces for this object and use a surface you select
	   to paint end points. Some rendering programs that do smooth
	   shading use the colors of the points around a polygon to 
	   describe the colors to paint it with. 3-Demon doesn't render in
	   this manner, but it lets you specify a color for each point, and
	   will store that in its file format. However, when it draws a point, 
	   it does fill it with that color.
Object	   Edit the surfaces for this object and use a surface you select
	   to paint the entire object. This is slightly different from the
	   previous three commands. While they are designed to let you
	   interactively edit the different surfaces and paint individual
	   items with these surfaces,  this command lets you paint entire
	   object with one sweep of the brush. So, there is no need
	   to select a surface and then paint a triangle or point with it.
	   Rather, each time you select a surface, the object is flood filled
	   with its color.

Most often,  you will choose the triangle option.

				47

Here's the surface window:

THE SURFACE LIST

The box in the upper right contains the list of surfaces for this object. Each
surface is represented by a descriptive name and a colored box. Select a
surface by clicking on its name. Should there be more surfaces than the
box can display, use the scroll bar and arrows on the right.

The color of the selected surface is displayed in the large rectangular box
in the middle of the window.

				48

THE COLOR KNOBS

There are six knobs that you can grab and drag to change the color of a
surface.

RED, GREEN, AND BLUE

The left three knobs describe the color as a composite of three pieces of
information: the quantities of red, green and blue that make up the color.
This is actually how colors are described inside the Amiga.

The R knob stands for Red, the G knob stands for Green, and we haven't 
yet figured out what B stands for.

You can alter a color simply by grabbing a knob and turning it.

You will probably find that describing a color in terms of its Red, Green, 
and Blue parts is confusing at times. Hence the need for a second system:

HUE, SATURATION, AND INTENSITY

This is a much more intuitive method for describing colors.

Hue is like a color wheel. Grab it and rotate it. The color will gradually
change from red to purple to blue to green to yellow to red again.

Saturation describes how distinct the selected color is. When saturation is
turned on full, the color is bold. As the saturation is turned down, the color
becomes blander and blander, eventually blending into a wash of gray.

Intensity determines how dark the color is. It is analogous to a light dimmer.
With intensity turned completely off, a color becomes simply black. As the
intensity is turned up, it gets brighter and brighter, just like turning up that
light dimmer. For those romantic, candle lit colors, have intensity turned
most of the way down.

The best way to understand Hue, Saturation, and Intensity is to experiment
with them. Notice that as these parameters are changed, the Red, Green, and
Blue values are updated.

SURFACE CHARACTERISTICS

There is a collection of sliders in the bottom half of the window that adjust
how the surface behaves when exposed to light. Depending on the rendering
program you are using, all, some, or none of these parameters make it into

				49

that program's file format. If the renderer supports a surface feature, then
it will be found in the file. Of course, all of these are saved in the 3-Demon
file format.

AMBIENT LIGHT

This represents how much light the surface emits, regardless of where the
light sources are. This is useful when you can't afford to model every single
light source in a scene, but you'd like to wave a magic wand and say "there's
this much light hitting these objects." For example, a starship in the night
sky is illuminated by thousands of stars, but rather than computing how
much light from each star hits the ship, you categorize that as ambient light
and simply state how much ambient light there is. Objects can be made to
glow in the dark by turning up their ambient light.

DIFFUSE REFLECTION

When a surface has a matte finish, it reflects light in all directions. It looks
dull, as opposed to shinny. This is called diffuse reflection. A piece of normal
paper (not the glossy magazine variety) is diffuse. On the other hand, a
mirror, which reflects in only one direction, has no diffuse reflection.

To increase the diffuse reflection, pull this slider to the right. This will
increase the brightness of this surface in the presence of light. All the way
to the right, and it'll behave like a day-glo sticker. All the way to the left, 
and it will be black (if the other reflection values are also turned down.)

SPECULAR REFLECTION

				50

When a surface has a glossy finish, this is due to specular reflection. Specularity reflected light bounces off the surface at the same angle it came in
at. Specular reflection is what makes a mirror work. Some dishwashing
liquid manufactures promote their products by showing how the specular
reflection of a plate increases dramatically after washing.

To increase specular reflection, pull this slider to the right. An object with
glossy highlights would have the specular reflection all the way to the right.
A non glossy, flat surface would have it all the way to the left.

METALICITY

Specular reflection can be very sharp or it can be dull. The duller it is, the
more it is like diffuse lighting. The sharper it is, the more it behaves like a
mirror. This is often called Metalicity because metal surfaces tend to have
sharp specular reflection.

Remember that if your renderer does not support this attribute, there is
little point in playing with it.

REFLECTION

This slider simply states how reflective the surface is. All the way to the
right and the surface reflects a lot of light, all the way to the left and it
doesn't.

TRANSPARENCY

If your renderer supports transparent and partly transparent surfaces, this
slider comes into play. Glass is completely transparent and the slider should

				51

be all the way to the right. Rose colored glasses are somewhere in the
middle. Most surfaces are opaque, no light can go through them, and the
slider is all the way to the left.

REFRACTION

Refraction is a characteristic of transparent solids. When light passes from
one transparent object to another of differing consistency, it bends. Did
you ever notice that when somebody stands in a pool, the part of them
below the water seems to be at an odd angle to the part above the water?
That's refraction at work.

Refraction gives that wonderful distortion associated with looking through
a glass ball or any glass object.

All the way to the right, the refraction slider represents a strong index of
refraction. The index becomes nothing at the far left. Glass would be two
thirds to the right, water about one third to the left, thin air just about at
the far left.

SPECIAL ID

There are almost certainly other surface characteristics that have not been
included. Should a renderer that needs some additional obscure information
come about, the Special ID parameter offers a way of providing additional
information.

Each triangle in a Sculpt 3D object can have one of several surface types
assigned to it. At the time of this writing, these types are 0 for dull, 1 for
shiny, 2 for mirrored, 3 for luminous, and 4 for glass. And, 128 is added
to the number if Phong shading is enabled. When 3-Demon loads a Sculpt
3D object, it stores these numbers in the Special ID field. The sliders
are adjusted appropriately, but you can adjust the Sculpt texture simply

				52

by editing the number in Special ID. To remove the influence of the Special
ID number, clear it. Then, the sliders will define the reflectance, etc.

NAME

Each surface has a name. By default, it is simply a color,  but it makes
sense to change it to something more descriptive, like "Green Dog Tongue"
or "LA Smog Sunset".

Click on this and edit to change the name of your surface.

ADDING SURFACES

To add an additional surface to the list of surfaces, click on the right mouse
button and move the mouse to the menu bar. From the drop down menu
that appears, select the Add option. This will create a new surface and stick
it in the list.

There is no limit to how many surfaces you create. 3-Demon lets you define
and use any number of surfaces. But, 3-Demon itself can only use twelve of
those to paint with, so it will do its best to match colors it can't paint to
ones it s painting. *

However, when you load your 3-Demon object into a rendering program
that supports more colors, they will be there to use.

DELETING SURFACES

To delete a surface, select Delete from the menu. The surface that currently
is selected will be removed. All triangles,  points, and lines in the object
that used this surface will now use the top surface in the list instead.

If there is only one surface left, this command will not work because there
must be at least one surface for the triangles, etc.

*Actually, 3-Demon does an intelligent job of selecting which surface to paint
with based on an analysis of which object is currently selected and which
surfaces are used the most.

				53

LOADING SURFACES

You can also load a set of surfaces from disk with the Open command in
the Menu. This will load a set of surfaces and add them to the ones you
already have.

SAVING SURFACES

Likewise, you can save your palette of surfaces with the Save option in the
menu.

Loading and saving surface sets can be useful. You may have a set of
surfaces that describe a particular style of object or scene. For example, 
you could have files called "building materials",  "ocean colors" and "vomit"
which you call up when there is a need for a particular set of surfaces.

PAINTING SURFACES

Once the Surface window has been opened,  you can go ahead and paint 
your object. To paint,  simply click on the item you wish to paint,  and it
will assume the color of the selected surface.

So, if you had selected to paint triangles from the Surface submenu, clicking
on triangles will change their surface. The same is true for points and lines.
However, the Object option is simply a method for painting an entire object
in one fell swoop. Each time you select a surface in the Surface window, 
the entire object - all points, lines and triangles - is given that surface.

The Surface window is very large and probably obstructs the view of the
object being painted. You can resize it to get it out of the way (but still
be able to select other surfaces) or completely close it down and continue
painting. As long as the mouse pointer remains a paint brush (which will 
be the case until you select a new command from the menu), you will be
able to paint.

				54

FLAT VIEWS

You can call up a screen that shows an object as two 'flat' views. Instead of
drawing you a photograph-like image, as the Main View does,  Flat Views
draws what look more like two blueprints of the object, viewed from two
angles.

To display an object as two 'flat' views, select Flat Views from the Display
menu item in the View menu.

The Main View and Depth View are replaced by two side by side views of 
the object.

The left view shows us the object head on,  this is the view of the object in
the X Y plane. The right side shows us the object in the X Z plane. This
is the same as looking at the object from the top down.

For both of these pictures, the object is not projected in perspective. This
means that a part of an object that is close is shown exactly the same size
as if it were far away. Although we've lost a depth cue, we've gained greater
accuracy because we now know exactly where a point is.

The Flat Views screen can only be used to perform operations that move
points around. There is no opportunity to add or delete points, color surfaces, or do the other operations that are available when working with the
Main View.

It is intended for cleaning up an object that has already been created.

DRAGGING POINTS

You can grab points and drag them to new locations. Simply click the
mouse on a point in one of the views and drag it. Both views will be
redrawn with the dragged point illuminated in red.

				55

EDITING A POINT

Below the two views is a group of gadgets. The three on the left called
"X Coordinate",  "Y Coordinate", and "Z Coordinate". These display the
current values of the three coordinates of the selected (red) point.

	X Coordinate	0
	Y Coordinate	0
	Z Coordinate	0

You can click on any of these numbers and edit it to move the point somewhere else. When you hit the return key, the two views will be redrawn
with the point moved.

CHANGING THE SCALE

You can alter the size of the displayed object by dragging the Scale slider.
Pull it to the right and we 'zoom' in on the object - it gets larger. Pull it
to the left and the object gets smaller. This only changes the display scale, 
we are not changing the actual size of the object.

Quanatization

You can specify that all points you drag resolve to a multiple of some
number. This is called "quanatization". For example, if Quanatization is set
to 5, all points must be multiples of five. A point that was at location
3, 42, 20 becomes 4, 40, 20 after it is quanatized. It's a way of cleaning up slop
in an object.

	Quanatization  10

				56

You may not want the points you are dragging quanatized. If so, a Quanatization of 1 results in no Quanatization. You can change the Quanatization by
clicking on the number and editing it.

If you'd like points to line up with the grid lines, set Quanatization to the
same value as the Grid Resolution. Then when you drag them, they'll fall
directly on the grid cross hairs.

GRID RESOLUTION

	GRID RESOLUTION  30

Edit this number to specify how far apart you'd like the grid lines to be.
Notice that when you make the grid very fine (a small Grid Resolution), 
the lines are no longer displayed.

QUANATIZE

This button automatically quanatizes the entire object to the resolution
given in the Quanatization box. Quanatization is great for objects that are
composed of straight lines and right angles, because it rigidly forces them
straight. It's lousy for curved objects, for the very same reason.

You might wish to rotate or move your object before you quanatize, to align
it properly with the grids. Use the Transformation Window to do this (see
Transform,  below).

The best way to understand Quanatization is to play with it. Create an
object and try different Quanatization values on it.

				57

TRANSFORM

This opens a Transformation window for the object. With the TRANFORMATION window, you can rotate, scale, and move the object. Rotation comes in
handy because it gives you the opportunity to edit the object from different
angles. The Center option in the Transformation window's menu is good
for centering your object in the two displays. See the chapter "Transforming
an Object".

SHIFT

This opens the View Control Box. The View Control Box has four sliders
that control the two views.

	VIEW CONTROL BOX
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	Scale
	X Shift
	Y Shift
	Z Shift

Scale is identical to the Scale slider in the Flat Views screen. Move it to
make the object larger or smaller in the display. Notice that when you move
it, the other slider also moves.

The three Shift sliders move the orientation of the display along the three
axis.

	X Shift moves both displays from the right to the left.
	Y Shift moves the left display up and down.

				58

	Z Shift moves the right display up and down.

Using the View Control Box,  you can zoom in on a particular part of the
object that you wish to edit. First, position the part that you wish to edit
in the center by pulling the Shift sliders until it is in the center of both
displays. Then, zoom in by dragging the Scale to the right.

You can close the View Control Box at any time or leave it open when you
return to the Projection screen.

D O N E

	D
	O
	N
	E

We're not sure what this does. Someone suggested clicking on it to see
what happens, but we're just a little nervous. Rumor has it that D O N
e stands for Don't Offend Nature, Elrod.

				59

WORKING WITH OBJECTS

Although the primary focus with 3-Demon is editing within an individual
object, there's plenty that can be done with objects as a whole, and some
of these operations augment the editing process.

BUILDING AN OBJECT OUT OF OTHER OBJECTS

It's useful to break an object you're working on into separate parts, or
objects. Editing operations can be performed on each independently. When
each part is complete, the last step is to position all of the parts into their
proper places, then combine them into one object.

For example, to build a car you might design a car body object and a wheel
object. When both are done, four copies of the wheel object are positioned
in the wheel wells and combined with the body object to make one complete
car.

You might build a library of parts saved on disk. Call up appropriate parts
as building blocks for putting together a more complex object. These can
be everything from simple geometric parts - spheres, cubes, and cones - to
trees, wheels, and chicken parts.

With this method of building an object out of several parts, there are several
things we need to be able to do:

	Scale an object larger or smaller so it's the proper size.
	Grab an object and move it anywhere.
	Orient an object so it faces in the right direction.
	Combine two objects into one.
	Make an identical copy of an object.
	Save and load objects to disk.
	Create a new object.
	Select an object for editing from the Edit menu.
	Delete an object.
	
				60

The commands to do all of these operations, plus a few more, can be found in the
Object menu:

	OBJECT
	~~~~~~
	New
	New Child
	Open
	Open Child
	Save
	Delete
	Select
	Move
	Combine
	Copy
	Transform
	quanatize
	Resolve Points
	HIERARCHY

CREATING A NEW OBJECT

3-Demon makes sure there is always an object to work with. If you don't
have any created, 3demon will automatically create one and make it the
selected object so you can proceed to immediately edit it.

So, when the program starts, there is one object already created by default.

And, should you delete an object and there are none left, 3demon will create
a new object.

THE NEW COMMAND

Use the New Command to create a new object.

As a point of reference, a triangle, colored gray, is created and attached to
this object. This gives you something to grab for operations that require
selecting an object by clicking on it. Otherwise, the object would be completely invisible. Once you have started to build the object by adding your
own triangles, this reference triangle can be removed.

				61

SPUN AND SLICED OBJECTS

The Spun and Sliced commands in the Add section of the Edit menu can
also be used to create new objects. These commands are discussed in the
chapter Editing an Object.

LOADING AND SAVING OBJECTS

To load an object, use the Open command. It gives you three file format
choices: 3-Demon, Videoscape, and Sculpt 3d. Generally, you should keep
your files in the 3-Demon format because it is the most flexible. However, 
the other two options are there for loading objects created by or for these
other programs.

Objects can be saved with the Save command. This gives you the option of
saving to six different file formats: 3-Demon, Videoscape, Sculpt 3d, Silver, 
Gossett, and Forms in Flight. Once again, it is best to save in the 3-Demon
format if you intend to reload an object with the Open command. The other
formats are provided so you can pass objects on to these programs after you
have finished creating them. Which is what 3-Demon is all about.

For more on the file formats and how to open and save objects, read the
chapter File Formats.

COPYING AN OBJECT

To make an exact duplicate of an object, use the Copy command. After
selecting Copy, simply click on the object to copy and drag the mouse to
the location you want it copied to. A duplicate of the object is placed
there. It's a good idea to drag the copy to a new location so you have two
distinctly separate object, rather than leaving the copy superimposed on
the original.

COMBINING TWO OBJECTS

To combine two objects into one, select the Combine command. Then, select
the source object. This object will become part of the destination object.
Finally, select the destination object. The two objects will be combined.

				62

DELETING AN OBJECT

To delete an object, select the Delete command. Then, click on the object
you wish to remove. If this object has children, they will be removed with
it.

SELECTING AN OBJECT FOR EDITING

Edit operations, such as moving points, painting surfaces, and adding triangles, can only be done on one object at a time.

The object that is chosen for editing, the selected object, is drawn with its
triangle edges in black. All other objects have their edges in white. And, 
points are only painted in as squares in the selected object, while the other
objects don't have their points drawn.

SELECTING BY DEFAULT

Whenever you use a command in the Object menu that does something to
an object, that object remains selected.

The only exception would be the Delete command, which removes the
object you choose.

THE SELECT COMMAND

To simply select an object for editing without doing anything else to it, use
the Select command. Just click on the object you want and it is selected
for editing.

MOVING AN OBJECT

There are two ways to move an object. The simpler is to grab and drag it.
This is done with the Move command. With this command, you simply click
on an object and drag it with the mouse. Of course, you are only moving it
in two dimensions (left-right and up-down). So, to move it anywhere, you
need to drag the object, then change the view angle and drag again.

The more sophisticated approach involves opening a transformation window
for the object and moving it with a MOVE transformation.

				63

A transformation is a command that tells 3-Demon to alter an object in 
some way. There are three transformation types: MOVE, SCALE,  and ROTATE. A MOVE transformation shifts the position of the object. A SCALE
transformation changes the size of the object. A ROTATE transformation
rotates the object.

So, to use a MOVE transformation, select the Transform command and
click on the object. A transformation window will open.

Move the object by installing a MOVE command in the transformation
window's Transformation List. The Transformation List is the list of transformation commands on the right side of the window. Each command can be
selected for editing by clicking on it. The selected command is displayed
in the Transformation Control Box, which fills the left side of the window.
Depending on the command, the TRANFORMATION control box is different.

				64

The transformation list will stay with the object after you close the window.
To create the MOVE transformation, go to the Add command in the Transform menu (the menu that is active when the Transform window is open)
and select Move.

Then, to move the object, select the Move transformation in the Transformation List and drag the X,  Y,  and Z sliders in the Transformation Control
Box.

Close the window when you have the object where you like. Or,  keep it
open and resume doing other tasks. Then, you can move the object at any
time. Of course, the window can be closed and reopened with no loss of the
newly created MOVE transformation.

There's a lot to say about working with transformation, much more than
this cursory discussion. You should read the chapter Transforming an
Object to learn more.

SCALING AND ROTATING AN OBJECT

Scaling an object changes its size. Rotating an object changes the orientation so the object faces in a new direction. Both of these operations are
implemented as transformation operations.

So, as with the second method for moving an object, this means opening
a Transformation window.

Open the transformation window by selecting the Transform command, 
then click on the object. The transformation window will open.

SCALING

To scale the object, you need to install a SCALE command in the Transformation List. Go to the Add command in the Transform menu and select
Scale. A Scale transformation should appear in the Transformation List.

Select the Scale transformation by clicking on it in the Transformation
List. The Transformation Control Box will display the current scaling in 
the X,  Y,  and Z directions.

Drag the X,  Y,  and Z sliders in the Transformation Control Box. Observe
how the object shrinks when you pull the sliders to the left and grows when
you pull them to the right. If the LOCK button is on, the object will change

				65

shape in all directions regardless of which slider you pull. To stretch along
the X,  Y,  and Z axis independently, turn off the LOCK button by clicking
on it. Then the sliders will work separately.

ROTATING

To rotate the object, you need to install a ROTATE command in the Transformation List. Go to the Add command in the Transform menu and select
Rotate. A Rotate transformation should appear in the Transformation List.

Then, to rotate the object, select the Rotate command in the Transformation
List.

Select the Rotate transformation by clicking on it in the Transformation List.
Three knobs will be drawn in the Transformation Control Box. These knobs are
just like the rotation knobs in the Main View, each knob corresponds to turning
the object around one of three axes. Grab one of these and turn to rotate the
object.

MUCH MUCH MORE

Once again, there's much more to say about working with transformations,  Read
the chapter Transforming an Object.

Sigh,  If only I had a remote transformation window that worked on real objects.
I'd stretch my enemies. Or make them short and fat. Move them into
uncomfortable places. Rotate them.

PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER

Now we have the tools to build an object by breaking it into multiple parts.

Back to that example of the car and the wheels:

First a wheel and a car body object would be created. Then, three more copies of
the wheel object would be created with the Copy command. Finally, the wheels
would be positioned with the Move command and possibly scaled and rotated with
the Transform command. Then, it would be all be put together with four uses of
the Combine command.

				66

WORKING WITH AN OBJECT HIERARCHY

3-Demon supports hierarchy objects. While working in this manner is not
absolutely necessary for creating objects,  it is an elegant approach.

Here are the rules for hierarchial objects in 3-Demon:

	One object can be the parent of several objects.

	When a parent object is moved, all of its children move with it.

	When a child moves, it does not effect its parent.

	The HIERARCHY can be any depth. An object can have grandchildren
	and great-grandchildren.

For example, we have Bruno the dog and his tail. Bruno is the parent object, the
tail is the child object. When Bruno is moved, the tail moves with him. But when
the tail is wagged by rotating it side to side, Bruno is not violently wagged
along with his tail.

In order to work with a HIERARCHY of objects, we need to be able to:

	Create an object that is a child of another object. We start by
	creating the parent object,  then moving on down as we build the
	children.

	Load an object from disk and make it a child of another object.

	Edit where an object is in the object HIERARCHY. If an object isn't
	where it should be in the HIERARCHY or we need to do some major
	redesign of the HIERARCHY, we should have a way to do it.

Needless to say, there is a command for each of the above requirements.

				67

HIERARCHY

You can manipulate the position of an object in the object HIERARCHY with
the HIERARCHY command. Select this command, then click on an object. A window
opens with the HIERARCHY and name of the object.

If an object is at the top of the HIERARCHY, all it will have to describe its
position is its name, as in the above example.

If an object is the child of another object, the parent's name is first, followed
by a slash, followed by the child object:

This scheme is very much like what we use to describe directories and
subdirectories in AmigaDOS. As we move down the tree, each object is separated
by a slash, just as when moving down a directory tree from the top.

To change the position of an object in the HIERARCHY, simply edit it to reflect
where you want it to be. If the new destination is legal, it will be taken from
its current position and placed there. Of course, all of its children will go
with it.

Suppose we have two objects,  'dog' and 'tail'. They are both at the top of the
tree. We'd like 'tail' to belong to 'dog'. Select the HIERARCHY command and
click on the 'tail' object. The HIERARCHY window should be:

CREATING A CHILD OBJECT

In addition to the New command, there is also the New Child command. This
creates an object that is the child of the most recently selected object. Like
the New command, this new object has a gray triangle built into it,  so you can
have something to grab.

				69

LOADING A CHILD OBJECT

And, there is the Open Child command which behaves identically with the Open
command, but it loads the new object as a child of the currently selected
object. For example, if you are working on an object called 'dog',  you might use
this command to load the child object 'tail'.

QUANATIZING AN OBJECT

Quanatization is a powerful tool for cleaning up slop in an object. You can use
it from the Edit menu on a point by point basis,  or here to clean up the entire
object at once.

What Quanatization does is resolve a point to an imaginary grid. You determine
the spacing of the lines in that grid. this spacing is called the Quanatization
resolution. When the point is quanatized, it is shifted to the closest cross
point in the grid. Here's an object before and after Quanatization:

You can quanatize points to any resolution.

Quanatization in 3-Demon is complicated by the fact that you may wish to
quanatize with the reference grid being positioned in the coordinate system of
the object, the world, or the view.

So, you are given three reference options: World,  Object,  and View.

				70

If you choose Object, points you quanatize will be quanatized against a grid that
is also positioned within the object. If you have scaled or rotated the object
with a transformation list, these will not effect the Quanatization.

If you choose World, the Quanatization will be based on world coordinates,  rather
than the coordinates of the object itself. If the object has no transformations
applied to it, the result will be the same as with the Object command. But, if
the object has been altered by some transformations (you have created a
transformation list for it), the Quanatization will be applied to the result of
those transformations, rather than the object itself.

Finally, the View uses a Quanatization grid that is oriented to the view. The
Quanatization is lined up with the angle that you view the object from. Rotate, 
scale, or shift the view, and the Quanatization changes with it.

For each choice, a window opens letting you set the Quanatization. Then, the
entire object is quanatized.

RESOLVING DUPLICATED POINTS

In the process of creating, editing, combining, and QUANATIZING objects, it's easy
to create multiple instances of the same point. These are not only wasteful but
annoying. Annoying because they make editing harder.

For example, you have two triangles that share a point. When you drag the
point, both triangles change:

				71

However, if they didn't share the point but, instead, simply had duplicate points, 
the move operation would look like this:

This is frustrating when the artist intends that both points be the same.
So, the Resolve Points command comes to the rescue. Select it and click on an
object. 3-Demon will find all duplicated points and make them the same.

				72

TRANSFORMING AN OBJECT

Although it is possible to edit an object simply by grabbing points and moving
them in space, sometimes it's necessary to perform an operation that moves the
entire object, often in some complex manner. For example, you may have a head
object that you'd like to stick on a body object, but, sadly, the head is facing
in the wrong direction. And, the head is just a little too small in proportion
to the body. What you need to do is turn the entire head around, make it just a
bit bigger, and move it into position on the body.

THE TRANSFORMATIONS

There is a set of three operations that can be applied to an entire object to
do this sort of magic. One operation rotates objects in space, one scales their
size, and one simply move them. These operations are called "transformations"
because they transform the object in some way. The Move command in the object
menu is a simply example of a transformation. it takes the object and
transforms all points by adding constant X,  Y,  and Z values to them.

Here's how each of the transformation work:

MOVE

This is the simplest. It is often called 'translation'. To move, or translate, an
object, offset values for the X,  Y,  and Z directions are given. These are then
added to the X,  Y,  and Z coordinates of all of the points in the object. So, to
move an object forward by 100 in the X axis, the X move coordinate would be set
to 100, while the Y and Z coordinates would be 0,  for no movement in those
directions.

SCALE

This transformation multiplies the X,  Y,  and Z coordinates of a point by X,  Y, 
and Z scaling factors. For example, to make an object half size, the X,  Y,  and Z
scaling factors would all be 0.5. Then, when multiplied against the object, all
points would have half their original values. To make things a little more
sophisticated (and therefore confusing), you are not required to have similar
scaling factors in all three directions. You can stretch an

				73

object along one axis by having the scaling factor on that axis be 2, while the
scaling factor on the other two axis is 1.

ROTATE

Rotating an object in in 3d space is not as simple as rotating in two
dimensions. In two dimensions (a flat sheet of paper), you can simply say, 
"Rotate by 35 degrees" and your object turns in a circle by that amount. But in
three dimensions, it can rotate around any arbitrary axis. It could be "flip
over backwards" or "turn sideways". One way to deal with this is to define a
rotation as being composed of three separate rotations, each around one of the
axis. The way 3-Demon rotates an object in 3d space is to rotate it first a
given amount around the X axis,  then a given amount around the Y axis, then a
given amount around the Z axis.

Bake to our problem about the head and the body.

	Rotate First, a rotation transformation would be applied to the head.
	A rotation of 180 degrees around the Y axis (which is up and down, so
	the head would swivel from front to back) and rotations of 0 around the
	X and Z axes would orient the head directly.

	Scale Then, scaling factors of, say 1.1 would be applied against the
	X,  Y,  and Z axis and a scaling transformation performed to make the
	head just a little bigger.

	Move Finally, a move transformation with the proper offsets in the X,  Y, 
	and Z directions would place the head squarely on the shoulders.

USING TRANSFORMATIONS

3-Demon lets each object have its own set of transformations. You create this
set, and it is composed of any number of transformations in any order.

				74

To create and edit the transformations that belong to an object, select
'Transform' in the Object menu. Then, click on the object you wish to edit. A
Transform window should open for that object:

THE TRANSFORMATION LIST

In the right hand box is a list of transformations. We'll call this the
"Transformation List". The transformations are listed from top to bottom in the
order in which they are applied to the object. In the case shown here, the
object is first moved, then scaled, then rotated.

				75

MENU COMMANDS

To add a new transformation to this list, move the mouse to the top left hand
corner of the screen, click on the right mouse button, and pull down the menu.
There are six choices:

	TRANSFORM
	Add
	Delete
	Move
	Open
	Save
	Center

ADD

Select this to add a new transformation to the Transformation List. There are
four choices:

	TRANSFORM
	Add		Move
	Delete		Scale
	Move		Rotate
	Open		Move, Rotate, Move
	Save
	Center

				76

The first three, Move, Scale, and Rotate, create a transformation of that type and
install it in the transformation list.

The fourth command, Move, Rotate, Move, creates two MOVE transformations with a
ROTATE transformation stuck in the middle. The first MOVE transformation will
automatically have X, Y,  and Z offsets installed that are calculated to move the
object to the center of the screen. The second has offsets that are the
inverse, they move the object back out to where it is. The ROTATE transformation
is initialized with no rotation.

An explanation:

When you rotate an object with the ROTATE transformation, it is rotated around
the origin. But if the origin is not the center of the object, it will look like
the object is orbiting around the origin, rather than spinning around its own
center.

The solution is to move the object to the origin, do the rotation, then move it
back out again. The Move, Rotate, Move command does just that. It create a MOVE
transformation that moves the object to the origin, a ROTATE transformation that
spins the object, then another MOVE transformation to move the object back to
its original position.

You can then rotate the object with the ROTATE transformation and the object
will spin around itself, no matter where it is located in space.

DELETE

Select this to remove the currently selected transformation in the list.

MOVE

You may wish to move a transformation from one point in the list to another.
Select the transformation you wish to move by clicking on it in the
Transformation List, then select this command, then click on the position in the
list you'd like the transformation placed.

OPEN

You can load a list of transformations from disk with this command. If you
already have some transformations, the new ones will be appended to the end of
the list.

				77

SAVE

You can save the list of transformations.

CENTER

You may wish to have your object centered squarely at the origin. It is easiest
to do rotation and scaling transformations on an object that is centered at the
origin, then use a move transformation to put it at its destination. The Center
command recomputes all of the points in the object and shifts them so it now
hovers around the origin. To compute just where to be, it uses one of two
methods, given as subitem choices that you must select.

With By Volume, the center of the object is calculated as being the central
point between the farthest reaches of the object. If you have an object with
lots of fine detail at one end, and one big triangle, the center will probably
end somewhere in the middle of the big triangle.

Withy By Density, the center of the object is calculated as being the average of
all the points, so an object with a high density of points at one end would have
its center biased there.

You can experiment with both methods and see which fits your object best.

THE TRANSFORMATION CONTROL BOX

When an item in the Transformation List is selected, the data about it is
displayed in the large box to the left. This we'll call the Transformation
Control Box. There are three styles of Transformation Control Box, one for each
of the transformation types:

				78

If there are no transformations in the list, this box will be empty. To create a
transformation, use the Add menu command described above.

At the top of all three Transformation Control boxes is a button that describes
what type of transform this is. Click on it to change the transform from MOVE
to SCALE to ROTATE.

MOVE

The MOVE command gives you three sliders and three number entry boxes. The
three number boxes display the current X,  Y,  and Z values that the MOVE
transformation offsets the object by.

If you wish to change one of these values, click on the number and edit it. When
you hit the return key, the MOVE transformation is updated and the main display
redraws with the object moved (if you click on the main display you'll see our
friend the weightlifter at work.)

There are also three sliders that can be grabbed to move the object. Grab a
slider, pull it to the left for a negative offset. The resulting value is
displayed in the number entry box and the object is redrawn. Notice that the
slider bounces back to the center, so you make the negative offset greater by
pulling it left again.

SCALE

Working with the SCALE transformation is very similar to MOVE. The control box
looks almost the same, with one obvious difference. There is a button called
LOCK. When LOCK is activated (which it is by default), the three scaling factors
(X, Y, and Z) are locked together. If you edit one, 

				79

the others are changed by the same amount, so the scaling is uniform in all
directions. Turn off LOCK, and all three must be edited separately.

Once again, there are the three number entry boxes. This time, the numbers are a
floating point values that are multiplied against the object to scale it. So, 
they are initialized to one, which results in no scaling. A value of two doubles
the object in size. A value of 0.33, or one third, shrinks the object to one
third size.

And, you can grab the sliders to change the scaling. Pulling a slider all the
way to the left decreases along that axis (or all three if LOCK is on) by
exactly one half while pulling all the way to the right doubles the size.

ROTATE

Like the other two, the ROTATE control box has three number entry boxes. These
correspond to the three axes the object is rotated around. Each is an angle
from 0 to 360 degrees.

You can also alter the three rotation axes by grabbing the circular knobs and
turning them. These knobs rotate the object relative to the current heading of
the object, so they don't simply alter the corresponding X, Y,  and Z rotation
values. This results in a more intuitive interface. You might think of this as
flying the object, where the rotations of X, Y,  and Z affect the heading of the
object, or 'airplane' just as Pitch, Yaw, and Foonleysplat would. Play with the
knobs to get a feel for how they affect the object's movement.

THE OBJECT'S NAME

In the top left hand side of the window, the object's name is displayed. If
you'd like, you can change it by clicking on it and editing it. Descriptive

				80

names like "dog" or "foot" are much more appropriate than "Object #N" which is
what the objects are named by default.

CONVERT

When you apply transformations to an object, the points in the object itself are
not changed. Instead, when the object is displayed, the transformations are
applied and the object looks like it have been transformed. *

Although it is not necessary, you may wish to make all the transformations you
are doing to the object permanent. Clicking on the CONVERT button changes all
of the points in the object to be what the transformations make it look like.
And,  the transformations are all initialized.

For example, once you have successfully sized, rotated, and moved the head onto
the body, you could hit the CONVERT button to permanently alter the head to be
what you see. Then, you could remove all of the transformations with the menu
Delete command because they would no longer be needed.

There's a very good reason for not having the transformations alter the points
directly. It avoids distorting the object through the accumulated numerical
errors of lot of transformations.

For example, suppose you want to make the head of our example very small, a pin
head. You use a scaling transformation that reduces it by a factor of one
hundred. The head had coordinates that were all between 0 and 100. They all
become either 0 or 1, because there are no fractions. Then, you change your mind
and decide to make it big again. This time, scaling up by a factor of one
hundred results in coordinates that are all 0 or 100, with nothing in between, so
now you have a block head. **

This is a gross example of what can go wrong, but even the slightest of errors
will accumulate over time and become unacceptable.

*You will notice that when you remove a transformation or change it from one
type to another, whatever it did to the object is cleared and the object reverts
to its former state.
**Admittedly, having a block head around is not as irritating as a pin head, but
in the 3D world we have limited patience with lower orders of intellect.

				81

By preserving the original coordinates and only using the transformations to
alter how the points are displayed, we avoid this problem.

In fact, you can have two transformations one after the other in the
Transformation List, the first scaling an object down by one hundred, the second
scaling it back up, and there will be no distortion introduced.

LOTS AND LOTS OF TRANSFORMATIONS

It's obvious that you can have lots of transformations in the Transformation
List, with multiple uses of each of the three types. This may not seem to make
sense at first. Why have several rotations when any conceivable rotation can be
done with one?

Depending on the ordering of the transformations, they will effect each other.
Two like transformations with a different transformation between them will not
combine to give the same result as if they were adjacent.

An example: Let's say our object is a planet. To simulate its orbit, we have a
Transformation List that goes ROTATE, MOVE, ROTATE.

The first ROTATE rotates the planet around its own North pole.

Then, the MOVE command moves it the distance of the planet to the sun it orbits
around.

The final ROTATE will now rotate it in that orbit, because the center of the
rotation has been moved to the sun.

Try it.

TRANSFORMATIONS AND CHILDREN OBJECTS

All child objects that belong to an object that is being transformed will be
transformed with it. But, when a child object is transformed, only its children
and not its parent object will be affected. This is very important. This is the
primary purpose behind having a hierarchy of objects.

Here's an example: A car is the object, a wheel belongs to it. When the car
moves, the wheel always moves with it. But when the wheel rotates and pivots, it
shouldn't affect the car.

				82

OPENING AND SAVING OBJECTS

From the Object menu objects can be opened (loaded) and saved on an individual
basis. And, since 3-Demon is designed to interface with other Amiga 3D programs, 
they can be in one of six different object file formats, including 3-Demon's.

You can use 3-Demon to create objects for five rendering programs. These are
VideoScape 3D, Sculpt 3D, Silver, Forms in Flight, and Gossett Graphics.

And, you can read objects created by 3-Demon and two other programs - VideoScape
3D and Sculpt 3D.

3-DEMON

You should always keep one copy of an object you are working on in the 3-Demon
format. You can not possibly lose anything by saving in this format, because
this is the format 3-Demon uses internally. Only when you are done and ready to
send your object to another program should you create a file in that program's
format.

Likewise, objects that are read in from other formats should be saved in the
3-Demon format until they are ready to be sent back.

LOADING 3-DEMON

To open a 3-Demon object, go to the Object menu and select the 3-Demon option in
the Open command. A file requester will open. It will display all 3-Demon
object files. These end with the extension ".object". Objects saved as part of
a project with the Save command in the Project menu can not be opened from
here, those files have the extension ".3demon".

Select the file you wish to open. For more on using the file requester, see the
chapter The File Requester.

The object will be opened.

SAVING 3-DEMON

To save an object in the 3-Demon format, go to the Object menu and select the
3-Demon option in the Save command. Then, click on the object you

				83

wish to save. Only this object, which includes all of its children, will be
saved.

A file requester will open. It will display only 3-Demon object files, these all
end with the extension ".object".

Select the file name you wish to save or type in a new file name. For more on
using the file requester, see the chapter The File Requester.

The object will be saved in the 3-Demon format. The transformation list and all
surfaces will be saved along with the triangles that make up the object.

VIDEOSCAPE 3D

Videoscape 3D itself does not have any facility for creating and editing
objects. However, it comes with some utilities for creating simple objects.
And, there is a large public domain library of VideoScape objects out there. So, 
3-Demon can open VideoScape objects as well as save them.

Just imagine, now you can put white walls on the Lotus.

At the time of this publication, VideoScape 3D only supports eight colors:
black, blue, blue-green, green, red, purple, yellow, and gray.

The original VideoScape 3D only supports six colors, blue-green, and purple are
missing.

LOADING VIDEOSCAPE 3D

To open a VideoScape 3D object, go to the Object menu and select the VideoScape
option in the Open command. A file requester will open. It will display all
files, since VideoScape 3D does not require an extension like ".object" or
".scene" added to the end of file names.

Select the file you wish to open. For more on using the file requester, see the
chapter The File Requester.

The object will be opened.

All polygons are broken down into triangles. Surface details are ignored.
Polygons made of two points are turned into lines. Individual points are
ignored.

3-Demon automatically creates eight surfaces for the eight colors.

				84

The object is scaled to fit the view (VideoScape objects can vary dramatically
in size) and centered.

SAVING VIDEOSCAPE 3D

To save an object in the VideoScape 3D format, go to the Object menu and select
the VideoScape option in the Save command. Then, click on the object you wish to
save. Only this object, which includes all of its children, will be saved.

A requester will open with instructions for saving in the VideoScape 3D format:

If you ask it to KEEP transformations, the list of transformations attached to
the object will be applied to it. For example, if you have a transformation that
rotates the object and KEEp is enabled,  the object will be saved rotated.
Otherwise, the VideoScape 3D object will not be rotated.

Select OKAY and a file requester will open. It will display all files, since
VideoScape 3D does not require an extension like ".object" or ".scene" added to
the end of file names.

Select the file name you wish to save or type in a new file name. For more on
using the file requester, see the chapter The File Requester.

The object will be saved in the VideoScape 3D format. Since this is an ASCII
format, you can look at the file in a text editor, if you are so inclined.

The biggest issue with generating VideoScape 3D files is they don't support
many colors. So, if you are creating an object for VideoScape, make sure you only
create surfaces for colors that exist. Other colors will be converted to the
closest fit. Pink becomes red. Orange becomes yellow.

				85

SCULPT 3D

Sculpt 3D has a lot of similarities with 3-Demon, so it's easy to pass objects
back and forth between the two.

Like 3-Demon, Sculpt only works with triangles.

Sculpt also allows an unlimited range of colors.

The only issue with Sculpt 3D is it doesn't recognize a difference between
front and back faces. This problem can be dealt with in several ways when
opening Sculpt files:

For every triangle that is loaded an additional triangle that faces in the
opposite direction is created. This ensures that every triangle is visible.
However, since there are twice as many triangles, the display time is increased.

Back faces can be turned on from the Draw Style command in the View menu. Now, 
3-Demon will draw all triangles, regardless of how they face. This creates the
same results as the previous solution, without doubling the size of the object.
However the back faces problem has not really been solved yet and programs like
VideoScape 3D that require the triangles properly oriented will still display
only about half of the triangles.

The object can be loaded without back faces being added or displayed. Then, the
Flip command in the Edit menu is used to flip all back faces so they face
forward. This provides by far the most satisfying results, but it requires some
extra effort on your part.

LOADING SCULPT 3D

To open a Sculpt 3D object, go to the Object menu and select the Sculpt 3D
option in the Open command. A file requester will open. It will display all
files that are in the Sculpt 3D format. These files end with the extension
".scene".

Select the file you wish to open. For more on using the file file requester, see
the chapter The File Requester.

				86

The object will be loaded and a second requester opened:

You are given several options. If the CENTER command is selected, the object
will be shifted to the center of the view. This is done not by moving all of
the points in the object, but by creating a transformation that shifts them
instead. See the chapter Transforming an Object if you are unsure about
transformations. Later, you can make the centering permanent by invoking the
CONVERT command in the transformation window for this object.

If the SCALE command is selected, a transformation that expands or shrinks the
object to fit the view is created.

Finally, the third command, ADD,  creates a back face triangle for every triangle
in the object. This doubles the size of the object but guarantees that you see
the entire thing.

It's usually a good idea to sue the CENTER and SCALE commands, they position and
scale the object so it is immediately easy to work with.

If you are feeling lazy and would rather not flip the back faces (gwan, getta job
yuh lardass lout), turn on the ADD command.

When you have selected the options you want, click on OKAY and the object will
be displayed.

				87

SAVING SCULPT 3D

To save an object in the Sculpt 3D format, go to the Object menu and select the
Sculpt 3D option in the Save command. Then, click on the object you wish to
save. Only this object, which includes all of its children, will be saved.

A requester will open with instructions for saving in the Sculpt 3D format:

If you ask it to KEEP transformations, the list of transformations attached to
the object will be applied to it. For example, if you have a transformation that
rotates the object and KEEP is enabled, the object will be saved rotated.
Otherwise, the Sculpt object will not be rotated.

The command to REMOVE back faces finds all instances of back to back triangles
and removes one of them. Since Sculpt doesn't care which direction a triangle
faces, there is no point in having back to back triangles. Of course, objects
created with 3-Demon will rarely have additional back face triangles, unless you
intentionally create them. But, had you opened a Sculpt 3D object and instructed
3-Demon to create back to faces at the time of loading, this option will remove
those back faces.

Select OKAY and a file requester will open. It will display only Sculpt 3D
files, these all end with the extension ".scene".

Select the file name you wish to save or type in a new file name. For more on
using the file requester, see the chapter The File Requester.

The object will be saved in the Sculpt 3D format. If you have Sculpt 3D
running, you can now open it from that program.

				88

SILVER

3-Demon only saves in the Silver format. Silver files can not be loaded.

SAVING SILVER

To save an object in the Silver format, go to the Object menu and select the
Silver option in the Save command. Then, click on the object you wish to save.
Only this object, which includes al of its children, will be saved.

A requester will open with instructions for saving in the Silver format:

If you ask it to KEEP transformations, the list of transformations attached to
the object will be applied to it. For example, if you have a transformation that
rotates the object and KEEP is enabled, the object will be saved rotated.
Otherwise, the Silver object will not be rotated.

Select OKAY and a file requester will open. It will display only Silver object
files, these all end with the extension ".silver".

Select the file name you wish to save or type in a new file name. For more on
using the file requester, see the chapter The File Requester.

The object will be saved in the Silver format.

FORMS IN FLIGHT

3-Demon only saves in the Forms In Flight format. These files can not be
loaded. Forms in Flight supports thirty two colors, each of which is user
definable. Although this is certainly a respectable amount, 3-Demon allows

				89

unlimited colors. So, if you are creating an object for Forms in Flight, it's
best to keep your list of Surfaces under 33 in length, preferably 16 and under.

SAVING FORMS IN FLIGHT

To save an object in the Forms in Flight format, go to the Object menu and
select the Forms in Flight option in the Save command. Then, click on the object
you wish to save. Only this object, which includes all of its children, will be
saved.

A requester will open with instructions for saving in the Forms In Flight
format:

If you ask it to KEEP transformations, the list of transformations attached to
the object will be applied to it. For example, if you have a transformation that
rotates the object and KEEP is enabled, the object will be saved rotated.
Otherwise, the Forms In Flight object will not be rotated.

Select OKAY and a file requester will open. It will display only Forms In
Flight object files, these all end with the extension ".mmo".

Select the file name you wish to save or type in a new file name. For more on
using the file requester, see the chapter The File Requester.

Two files are created. One is the file name with the extension ".mmo". This
holds the description of the object. The second file ends with the extension
".mma". This is an animate file. Since we 3-Demon can only create an object, not
an animation script, this file is almost empty. However, this file is needed in
order for the ".mmo" file to load properly. So, if you plan to copy your files
from one disk to another, make sure you include the ".mma" files.

				90

GOSSETT GRAPHICS

3-Demon only saves in the Gossett Graphics format.

With the Gossett format, the colors of the points determine the color of the
object, not the colors of the triangles. So, make sure you are painting the
points when preparing an object for Gossett.

SAVING GOSSETT

To save an object in the Gossett format, go to the Object menu and select the
Gossett option in the Save command. Then, click on the object you wish to save.

A requester will open with instructions for saving in the Gossett Graphics
format:

	SAVING GOSSETT GRAPHICS OBJECT.
	KEEP    transformations.
	OKAY

If you ask it to KEEP transformations, the list of transformations attached to
the object will be applied to it. For example, if you have a transformation that
rotates the object and KEEP is enabled,  the object will be saved rotated.
Otherwise, the Gossett Graphics object will not be rotated.

Select OKAY and a file requester will open. It will display only Gossett
Graphics object files, these all end with the extension ".gossett".

Select the file name you wish to save or type in a new file name. For more on
using the file requester, see the chapter The File Requester.

The object will be saved in the Gossett Graphics format.

				91

THE FILE REQUESTER

Whenever you open or save something to disk, the 3-Demon file requester is
displayed:

	Available Volumes
	ASDG-RAM:
	RAM DISK:
	3DEMON OBJECTS:

	DRAWER    3DEMON_OBJECTS:
	BRID
	HEAD
	HEAD 2

		FILE       HEAD
	SAVE	  DELETE     CANCEL

AVAILABLE VOLUMES

All disks that are currently in your Amiga are displayed by name. This includes
any RAM disk or hard disk devices you might have.

	AVAILABLE VOLUMES
	ASDG-RAM:
	RAM DISK:
	3DEMON_OBJECTS:

				92

If there are more than three volumes, click on the up and down arrows to scroll
through the list.

When you change disks, the list of volumes will be refreshed when the new disk
is placed in a drive.

To select a volume, click on its name in the list. 3-Demon will search that
volume for files.

DRAWER

		DRAWER    3DEMON_OBJECTS:

This displays the name of the current drawer, or directory, that is displayed in
the file list below. The drawer name can be anything that is a legal path for a
directory. For example,  "DF1:" and "RAM:c" are legal names, as long as DF1: and
the directory RAM:c do indeed exist.

THE FILE LIST

All files in the drawer are listed here.

	BRID
	HEAD
	HEAD 2
	OBJECTS   (DIR)

Well, not all files. Just files that are of the right type. For example, if the
File Requester is opened by the Open command of the Project menu, only scene
files are listed.

				93

In addition to files, subdirectories (drawer within a drawer) are also listed with
"(dir)" after their names.

		OBJECTS   (DIR)

To enter the subdirectory, click on its name twice. The Drawer name is changed
to reflect this and the files in that subdirectory are displayed.

		DRAWER   3DEMON_OBJECTS:OBJE

If we are in a subdirectory, the top item should be the parent directory:

		/PARENT   (DIR)

Click twice on this to return to the parent directory.

To open or save a file, click twice on its name.

FILE

If you are saving a file, it may not exist yet, so you need to create a name for
it. Use the File name to do this.

		FILE    CRACKER

Click in the box and type in the name. When you hit the return key, 3-Demon will
close the file requester and save the file in the directory given by the Drawer
name.

				94

SAVE

If 3-Demon displayed the file requester for saving a file, this button is drawn.
You can save a file by clicking on its name, then clicking the Save button.

OPEN

Or, if the requester was displayed by 3-Demon to open a file, in place of the
Save button is the Open button. Once again, click on a file name, then click on
this button to open the file.

DELETE

To delete a file, simply select it and click on the Delete button.

CANCEL

Finally, if you change your mind, you can always hit the Cancel button and leave
the job undone.

				95

	Open
	Open Child
	Save
	Delete
	Select
	Move
	Combine
	Copy
	Transform
	quanatize
	Resolve Points
	HIERARCHY

3-Demon creates and edits objects. There can be more than one object displayed
at one time. In fact, there is an object HIERARCHY where several objects can be
the children of another. Objects can be moved independently, combined, saved to
disk, etc. This menu covers all of the operations that are performed on objects
as a whole.

				97

NEW

This creates a new object to work with. Since this object does not be default
have any triangles to work with, it should be completely invisible. However, so
that you can select this object, an initial triangle is created, colored gray.
The new object is created at the same level in the HIERARCHY as the currently
selected object (it is a sibling).

NEW CHILD

This creates a new object to work with that is the child of the currently
selected object. As a child, any commands that alter or move the parent object
will also affect this one, though manipulations of the child will not affect the
parent. Once again, one gray triangle is created so you can grab this object.

OPEN

Use this to load an object from disk. Three object formats are supported:
3-Demon, Videoscape 3D, and Sculpt 3D.

OPEN CHILD

This also loads an object in from disk, but it places the object as a child of
the currently selected object called "car", you might use this command to load
the child object "wheel".

SAVE

You can select an object and save it in one of six formats. Select the Save
command, then click on the object you wish to save.

If you are saving a file to be read back in to 3-Demon, always save in the
3-Demon format.

The other five formats are for programs that render. If you are generating
objects for one of these renderers, save to its format.

DELETE

Use this to remove an object. Simply select this command, then click on the
object you wish to delete. All children of a parent object are also removed.

				98

Deleting the car removes all of the wheels, whereas deleting a wheel only
removes itself.

SELECT

Only one object is active at a time for editing (the Edit menu). The active
object is highlighted. Select the object to edit by selecting this command, 
then clicking on the object.

MOVE

You can grab an object and drag it across the screen. Select Move, click on an
object, then drag it. Move stays active so you can continue positioning objects.
Notice that a parent object moves all of its children, while the reverse is not
so.

COMBINE

Use this command to merge two objects into one. Click first on the source
object, then on the destination object.

COPY

This makes a duplicate of an object. Click on an object, then drag the mouse to
where you want the copy to be placed. Lift up on the mouse and the copy should
appear.

TRANSFORM

This opens a transformation window for the object that you select. With the
transformation commands, you can rotate, scale and move the object.

QUANATIZE

You can quanatize the resolution of the points in your object to a multiple of
some number.

You are given three options: World, Object, and View. Which you choose determines
what the orientation of the Quanatization will be.

If you choose Object, the points within the object will be quanatized
irrespective to how the object is positioned in the world around it.

				99

If you choose World, the Quanatization will be based on world coordinates, rather
than the coordinates of the object itself. If the object has no transformations
applied to it, the result will be the same as Object. But, if the object has been
altered by some transformations, the Quanatization will be applied to the result
of those transformations, rather than the object itself.

Finally, View takes it one step further. This includes the influence of the view
the Quanatization is lined up with the angle that you view the object from.

For all three choices, a window opens letting you set the Quanatization, then you
select the object to quanatize.

RESOLVE POINTS

This command runs through the list of points for the selected object and throws
away duplicate points. Duplicate points are points that exist at the exact same
point in space. All triangles and lines that included one or the other point
are made to share the same one.

HIERARCHY

You can manipulate the position of an object in the object HIERARCHY with the
HIERARCHY command. Select this command, then click on an object. A window opens
with the HIERARCHY and name of the object. By editing the HIERARCHY, you can
place it elsewhere.

THE EDIT MENU

	EDIT
	Add
	Delete
	Move
	Surface
	Divide
	quanatize
	Flip
	Combine

This menu supports the core of what this program is all about:  editing

				100

objects. The commands in this menu all pertain to the currently selected
object.

ADD

There are six ways to add to an object. These are given as submenu choices:

Triangles: Add triangles by simply clicking on the screen where you want the
end points to lie. Every three points creates a new triangle. If you click on a
point that already exists, it will be used, rather than creating a new one.

Polygons: This is almost the same as adding triangles, except the shape keeps
growing with each additional point added. To finish the polygon, click on the
first point.

Lines: Create lines by clicking on the screen where you want the end points to
be. Every two points creates a line.

Spun: Use this to create a spun object by defining an outline, then spinning it
around the axis determined by the first and last points. You will be prompted
for the number of sides. Add points by clicking on the screen. Each time you
add a point, a line is connected from the last point to the new one. Click twice
on a point to open a pop up menu with options. The options are to move a point, 
spin the object, and abort the operation.

The spun object is actually a separate object - it is not part of the object
you were working with. This is because it is rare that a spun object will be
exactly where you want it in space. By making it a separate object, it is
separate from everything else and it can be easily positioned with the Move and
Transform options in the Object menu. Then, once it is positioned correctly, use
the Combine command in the Object menu to make it part of another object.

Sliced: Use this to create an object that is made of equally spaced slices.
This is sometimes called "lofting". A window will prompt you for the number of
slices and the distance between each.

				101

Then, you draw the outline of the first slice by clicking on the screen. To
access options, click on a point and a pop up menu will appear, prompting to add a
slice, move a point, or abort the operation. When you add the first slice, the
first and last points will automatically be joined to make the base of the
sliced object complete. Then, you can build the sliced object up by moving
points and adding slices, until the top is added.

3-Demon does its best to fill in the polygon at the base and top of the sliced
object, but for complex shapes, it often misses a triangle or two.

Like spinning an object, slicing an object creates a new, unique, object.

Back Faces: Each triangle can only be viewed from one side. If you'd like the
other side visible, you can create a triangle that is identical, just facing in
the other direction.

DELETE

With this command activated, you can delete lines and triangles from your object
simply by clicking on them.

MOVE

There are two choices for how you wish to grab points and move them. The first
choice is Points. This enables grabbing individual points and dragging them.
The second choice is Group. This lets you draw a box and drag everything in the
box.

For either choice, you are prompted for the 'magnetism' of the drag pointer. If
the magnetism is strong, adjacent points will be influenced by the moving point.

Only points that are illuminated can be grabbed. To increase the grab range, 
slide the Grab Range icon (the farthest thing on the right) down.

SURFACE

Select this to edit the surface (color) characteristics of points, triangles, 
lines, and the whole object. A window with the list of surfaces will open and
you can work with it while painting your object. Whichever surface is

				102

selected in the surface window is the one you'll be painting with. Painting is
accomplished simply by clicking on points and triangles. With the window
closed, you can still paint.

DIVIDE

This simply subdivides triangles into three triangles. Click on a triangle and
a point appears in the middle of it, and three new edges radiate out from the
point. the provides a quick way to add detail to a face of an object.

QUANATIZE

You can quanatize points to any resolution.

You are given four options: World, Object, View, and Off.

Of the first three, which you choose determines what the orientation of the
Quanatization will be.

If you choose Object, points you quanatize will be quanatized irrespective to how
the selected object is positioned in the world around it.

If you choose World, the Quanatization will be based on world coordinates, rather
than the coordinates of the object itself. If the object has no transformations
applied to it, the result will be the same as Object. But, if the object has been
altered by some transformations (you have created a transformation list for it), 
the Quanatization will be applied to the result of those transformations, rather
than the object itself.

Finally, View takes it one step further. This includes the influence of the view
the Quanatization is lined up with the angle that you view the object from.

For the first three choices, a window opens letting you set the Quanatization.
Then, you select the points and triangles to quanatize simply by clicking on
them.

After you are done QUANATIZING and you go back to adding new points, the
Quanatization will stay in effect and the new points will be quanatized as well.
So, if you'd rather not have that happen, remember to turn Quanatization off with
the Off command.

				103

FLIP

This simply flips triangles around so their back faces are now front faces.

COMBINE

Combine two points into one. All of the triangles and lines that use the two
points now share the one. This is handy for "sewing" up the seams between
objects that are being combined.

THE VIEW MENU

View
Draw Style
Display
Reference
Mouse Coordinates

These commands affect the display.

DRAW STYLE

This has a bunch of options that you can select for how the objects are drawn.
You can turn on and off the rendering of Edges, Points and Triangles. You can
allow back faces to be rendered (normally, triangles that face away from the
observer are transparent.) And, you can select that the objects be displayed
shaded gray, which gives a better feel for their three dimensionality, but
removes the option of seeing their colors.

VIEW STYLE

You can turn on and off the top down view (Depth View) on the right side of the
screen.

The Flat Views option opens a window where the currently selected object can be
edited in the more traditional manner with two flat views: one on the XY plane, 
the second on the XZ plane.

The View Control Box command opens and closes the View Control Box which has
sliders to change the scale and position of the main view.

				104

The Depth Control Box command opens and closes the Depth Control Box which
displays the four depth sliders (Eye, Distance, Screen, and Grab Range) as numbers
which can be edited.

REFERENCE

There are two reference objects that you can turn on and off. These are a Grid
Object and an Origin Object composed of X, Y, and Z axis. Being objects, these can
actually be edited, copied, etc.

You can also turn on a non object grid with the Grid command. This grid behaves
differently from the grid object.

MOUSE COORDINATES

You can have 3-Demon display mouse coordinates in the upper left hand corner of
the Main View.

You are given three choices about how 3-Demon should figure out what those
mouse coordinates are. You might want to know what they are relative to the
object you are working on, relative to the world of all objects, or relative to
the view.

If you choose Object, the mouse coordinates will indicate where in object
coordinates the mouse is. This is good for editing individual objects.

If you choose World, the mouse coordinates will indicate where in the world the
mouse is. This is good for operations like dragging and object where you want
to know where in the world you are taking it.

The third choice, View gives you mouse coordinates based on your angle viewing
the objects. In this mode, X is always left to right, Y is bottom to top, and Z is
front to back.

The fourth choice, Off turns off the display of coordinates.

				105

THE 3-DEMON VIEW COMMANDS

These buttons, sliders, and knobs all reside in the 3-Demon screen.

VIEW ROTATION BUTTONS

Click on these buttons to rotate the Main View in the directions described by
the arrows. Each click rotates by 45 degrees.

CENTER ANGLE

Click on this to return the view angle to the starting angle.

MEMORIZE ANGLE

M
Click on this to memorize the current view angle.

RECALL ANGLE

R
				106

Click on this to return the view to the angle memorized with the Memorize Angle
button.

REDRAW

Redraw
Click on this to redraw the display.

THE EYE

This slider represents the position of a mythical eye that is used to compute
the perspective distortion for drawing in the Main View. Move it up to increase
distortion (it gets close to the object, creating a fish-eye effect), move it down
to get a telephoto, flat effect.

THE SCREEN

This slides up and down and represents the Main View screen that the objects
are draw on. Move it to change the display.

				107

DISTANCE

This sets the depth that edits are done at.

GRAB RANGE

This sets the Grab Range, the depth range where points can be grabbed. The Grab
Range is displayed in the Depth View as the area between two "fog banks" of
white dots.

				108

TUTORIAL

The best way to understand 3-Demon is to get behind the wheels. This tutorial
starts with simple stuff and works up to the more complicated issues. As we go
along, new concepts will be introduced and then demonstrated.

But, before starting the tutorial, please read Building Blocks in a 3D World and
The 3D Environment.

RUNNING 3-DEMON

We start by getting acquainted with the 3-Demon environment. To do this, we need
to open a scene. A scene is essentially everything you have in front of you
when 3-Demon is running. It includes all objects you are working on and all
display information.

To open a scene we need to use the file requester.

After opening a scene, we will move around with it.

	Step 1	If you haven't already, run 3-Demon. Do this by clicking twice
		on the 3-Demon icon in the 3-Demon disk in WorkBench.

		If 3-Demon is unable to run, there must not be enough memory.
		Close down other programs that are running. Try again.

	Step 2	Go to the Project menu and select Open. This command loads an
		entire scene, composed of a collection of objects and viewing
		parameters.

		The File Requester will open.

		The top box in the requester has volume names. These include
		the disk 3-Demon.

	Step 3	Click on "3-Demon" to tell it to display the scene files in 
		that disk. The names of the scene files are then displayed in
		the bottom box.

				109

		LOAD SCENE
		Available Volumes
		TODOR:
		ASDG-RAM:
		3-DEMON:

		Drawer    3-Demon:
		Example 1
		objects   (dir)
		Trashcan  (dir)

		File

	Save	Delete	  Cancel

	Step 4	Click twice on "Example 1". The file requester should go away
		and after some disk grinding, the display should look like this:

				110

	Step 5	Walk around the object, viewing it from different angles. First
		click on the Rotate Up button:

		Now the object should rotate up 45 degrees.

	Step 6	Click on the Rotate Left button:

		Notice how we are sneaking around the right side of the view.

	Step 7	Click on the Memorize Angle button:

			M

				111

		This memorizes the current view angle.

	Step 8	Move some more by clicking on the Rotate buttons (these all
		have arrows on them.)

	Step 9	Recall the memorized position by clicking on the Recall Angle
		button:

			R

		The object is now viewed from the same angle it was when we
		saved the angle with the Memorize Position button.

	Step 10	Play with the three knobs:

		With these you can turn in any direction and any angle from
		nothing to a full circle.

	Step 11	Click on the Rotate Center button to return to the position we
		were in when the object was first loaded.

	Step 12	Drag the Eye to the bottom of the screen:

				112

		This changes the perspective, making it flatter. Also, because
		the eye is farther away, the object appears smaller. Drag the
		eye close to the object to give it a distorted, fish-eye look.

	Step 13	Rotate the view and play with perspective until it seems to
		make sense.

EDITING THE OBJECT

Now that we have an object up and we can move around it, it's time to edit it.

We'll start by dragging points.

3-Demon will only let you grab and drag points that are within the Drag Range.
This is the area in the Depth View that is bounded by a pattern of white dots
above and below. Points that are within this "fog bank" can not be grabbed. The
limits of the Drag Range are set with the Drag Range slider while the Distance
slider sets the center of the Drag Range:

	Step 14	At this point, the vertices within the Drag Range are not 
		illuminated. Turn them on with the Points command in the 
		Draw Style item of the View menu.

				113

	VIEW			EDGES
	Draw Style		Points
	Display			Triangles
	Reference		Back Faces
	Mouse Coordinator	Shaded

		Now the points within the Drag Range are illuminated with
		square boxes. Notice that points on the far side of the object
		are drawn as well as points on this side, as long as they are
		within the Drag Range.

		All points that are illuminated can be grabbed and dragged.

	Step 15	Go to the Edit menu and select Points from the Move command.

				EDIT
				Add
				Delete
				Move		Points
				Surface		Group

				114

		A requester should open:

	DRAG POINTS
	    Magnetism

				Okay

		The magnetism slider determines how much dragging one point
		is going to influence other points. If the magnetism is all the
		way to the left, only the selected point will move. Drag it to
		the right and more and more points will be affected. Put it
		about a third of the way from the left and click on "Okay".

	Step 16	The mouse pointer is now a magnet. Use the magnet to grab
		a point by clicking on the point. With the mouse button held
		down, drag the point. Lift up when you have moved it to a
		position you like.

You can only move points up and down, right and left, but not forwards and
backwards. The points stay at a constant distance. So, if you grab a point that
was at the far end of the Drag Range and drag it across the screen, it still is
at the far end of the Drag Range.

So, if you want to move a point forwards or backwards, you need to reposition
yourself so the forwards and backwards become right and left or up and down.

This is done simply by rotating the view. If there is a point that need to be
moved towards you, click on the Rotate Right button twice. This orients the view
sideways. Now, dragging the point to the right accomplishes what you want.

				115

	Step 17	Experiment with editing from different angles. Click on buttons
		and turn knobs to change the view. Then grab points and drag
		them.

	Step 18	Select the Group option from the Move command. This lets you 
		drag a group of points at once. Once again, magnetism is
		applied to points outside the group, so the magnetism requester
		opens. Select the magnetism you want (or leave it alone) and
		click on "Okay".

	Step 19	Select a group of points you want to drag. Do this by clicking
		the mouse down at the top left corner of the area you wish to
		drag and pull the mouse to the lower right side of the group.
		A box will be drawn outlining the area. Lift up on the mouse
		when the box surrounds the group of points.

	Step 20	Click in the box and drag it. All points in the box will drag
		with it. Points that are outside the box but near its boundary
		will be pulled by the magnetic attraction. Lift up on the mouse
		when you have dragged the group where you want.

	Step 21	Box another group of points and drag them. Experiment with
		rotating the view and dragging groups of points.

PAINTING WITH SURFACES

Triangles are painted with "surfaces". A surface describes both the color and
the reflection and refraction properties of the paint.

Each object has a list of surfaces that the triangles within it are painted
with. At the very least, an object will have one surface that is used to paint
all triangles. There is no limit to how many surfaces an object may have, you
can create new surfaces and add them to the object.

Working with surfaces is composed of two parts:

	Creating and editing the surfaces.

	Painting the surfaces onto the triangles with point and click
	operations.

For a thorough education on surfaces, read the chapter Surfaces.

				116

	Step 22	To paint the triangle, select the Triangles option in the
		Surfaces command in the Edit menu.

		EDIT
		Add
		Delete
		Move		Triangles
		Surface		Lines
		Divide		Points
		Quantity	Object

				117

	This is the Surface Edit window. It gives you the tools to select, 
	create, and edit surfaces.

	Step 23 To select a surface, click on its name in the large box on the
		top right. Select "Green". Notice that the six knobs on the
		left change. These represent the color green as Red, Green, 
		and Blue values and as Hue, Saturation, and Intensity.

	Step 24	Grab the knobs and twirl them. Try all six. Play with them
		until you are comfortable with designing colors.

	Step 25	Move the Surface window so it doesn't obstruct the object.
		This can be done by dragging it to the side, and making it
		smaller by dragging the window's sizing gadget (the icon at
		the bottom right corner of the window) up so only the list of
		surfaces and color knobs are visible.

	Step 26	Paint the object by clicking on triangles. Since you had
		selected Green, the triangles you click on will turn green.

	Step 27	To get at triangles on the side and back, rotate your view of
		the object with the rotations controls (yuh know, the ones we
		used to walk around the object with earlier in this tutorial.)
		Rotate and paint.

	Step 28	Select another surface by clicking on its name. Paint with it.

	Step 29	Close the Surface window by clicking on its Close icon. This
		is at the top left. The window will shut down, but you can
		continue painting until you select a new command from the
		menu.

EDITING IN FLAT VIEWS

You can also edit an object as if it were described by two blueprints. This is
done with the Flat Views option. This replaces the Main View and Depth View
with two equally sized views. But these views are completely flat and the
object is draw as a wire frame. Working in this mode, you can perform operations
that move points, but none of the other features such as adding, deleting, 
painting, etc., are allowed.

				118

	Step 30	Enter Flat Views by selecting the Flat Views option in the
		Display command of the View menu. Two wire frame drawings
		of the object will be drawn. On the left, the object is
		shown from the top (the X axis is horizontal and the Y axis
		is vertical) while the view on the right is from the side (the X
		axis is horizontal again, while the Z axis is the vertical.)

	Step 31	Edit the object by grabbing points with the mouse and dragging
		them. Notice that the grabbed point is illuminated in red
		on both views. And, the coordinates of the point are printed
		in the X, Y, and Z Coordinate boxes.

	Step 32	To get a closer view of the object, grab the Scale slider and
		pull it to the right.

	Step 33	After dragging a point, edit its value directly in the X, Y, or
		Z Coordinate box. The picture will be redrawn with the point
		moved.
	
		The numeric inputs are very useful for making technically 
		accurate corrections to your object.

	Step 34	Click on the Shift button. The View Control Box should open.
		This has four sliders. The first is a scale slider identical to
		the other scale slider. The other three shift the image along
		the three axes.

	Step 35	Play with the four sliders. They're great for positioning over
		and zooming in on the part of the object you are editing.

	Step 36	Continue editing. If you are curious about the other controls
		in the Flat Views screen, consult the chapter Flat Views.

	Step 37	Leave Flat Views by clicking on "Done."

	Step 38	Notice that the View Control Box stays open and it controls
		the Main View just as it did the Flat Views. Play with this a
		bit to get a feel for it. You can always leave the Control Box
		open while you work, or close it directly by clicking on its
		close icon.

					119

		You can open and close the View Control Box from the Main
		View with the View Control Box option in the Display 
		command of the View menu.

CREATING A SPUN OBJECT

You can create an object that is defined by a curved line that is then spun
around an axis. This is a powerful tool for creating complex objects quickly.

Many objects can be created simply by spinning an outline, then pushing and
prodding the spun object into shape with the Move commands.

In this example, we'll create a spun object.

Although 3-Demon allows multiple objects to be on the screen, the old object
will get in the way of this tutorial, so we'll remove it first.

	Step 39	Select the Delete command from the Object menu.

	Step 40	Click on the object. A requester should open, asking if you
		really want to delete it. Click on "Yes". The object will be
		removed from the display.

	Step 41	Select the Spun option from the Add command in the Edit menu.
		A requester will open:

		SPIN AN OBJECT
		
		  Number of slides:  8

		  Draw as many points as you wish.
		  Click on a point for options.
		  The line from the last to first
		  point is the axis of rotation.
		
				            Okay

				120

The object is spun in a circle around the axis. It's like using a lathe to
create the object. Since the sides are made of triangles which are flat, 3-Demon
breaks the circle into a number of equal steps. The number of steps is the
number of sides. A spun object with fours sides is square and boxy. an object
with six sides is as circular as a snowflake. Increase the number of sides and
we get closer and closer to a very smoothly approximated circle. However, this
means more and more triangles, which can be very expensive. Remember, an object
with lots and lots of triangles will take longer for 3-Demon to work with and
longer for your rendering program to generate an image for. So, only use as many
sides as necessary.  Don't overshoot.

	Step 42	For this example, eight sides is adequate, so enter that number
		and click on "Okay".

	Step 43	Draw the outline. Simply click where you want each point to
		be and a line is drawn from the last point to the new one.
		Here's an example outline that describes a sphere:

	Step 44	To edit a point click on any point. A pop up menu will appear
		under the mouse. You can move the mouse pointer to the 
		selection of your choice. Select Move Points and the pointer
		will turn into the familiar magnet. You can now grab points
		and drag them at will.

	Step 45	Click away from any point and the menu will appear again. 
		This time, select Add Points to continue adding on to the
		outline.

					121

	Step 46	When you are ready to spin, click on a point and select Spin
		It from the pop up menu. Wait a few seconds while 3-Demon 
		creates the object and draws it.

ADDING TO AN OBJECT

Suppose you want to add more to your spun object. It needs more faces,  maybe a
line or two to turn it into that butterfly you had it mind. It's easy to add
new triangles and lines to the object. However, there are a few things to
understand first.

Creating triangles is done simply in a point and click fashion. Click three
times and you have created the three points that define a triangle.

It's actually not that simple. The mouse can only describe a two dimensional
triangle. We need depth information to describe a three dimensional triangle.

Enter the Depth View. Imagine that there is a sheet of clear glass placed
across the view so that you are looking directly at it. Anything that is drawn
is drawn on this sheet of glass. If the glass is brought closer to you, then
when new triangles are created on it, they are also closer because they are
drawn on that glass.

The depth of this sheet of glass is set with the Distance slider.

So, to create a triangle at a particular place, orient the view so that the
triangle will face you and set the Distance slider for the proper depth.

Almost always an object is made up of triangles that butt up against each other
and share edges. Since the edges of triangles are really defined by two
points, sharing edges means sharing points. So, if you are attaching a new
triangle to an object, you may wish to connect it to existing points.

This is easily done. Remember that all points within the Grab Range are
highlighted. If you are constructing a triangle and you click on a highlighted
point, instead of creating a new point, 3-Demon will use that point as a corner
of your triangle, even though it may not be at the depth of the Distance slider.

The best way to get a good grasp of all this is to try it out:

	Step 47	Select the Triangles option from the Add command in the Edit
		menu.

				122

	Step 48	Set the Distance slider so it is just behind the object you
		spun. To be in back it should be above the spun object in the
		Depth View, but keep it close (this is important for what we'll
		be doing later.)

	Step 49	Create a triangle by clicking three times on the Main View.
		Make the triangle overlap the spun object. Although the 
		triangle is behind the spun object, it is displayed.

	Step 50	Create a second triangle that is adjacent to the first. Do this
		by first clicking on two points that are in the first triangle
		then a third point. You'll now have a total of four points, two
		of which are shared, describing two triangles.

	Step 51	Click on the Redraw button. The Main View will be refreshed
		and the two triangles should appear behind the spun object.
		Notice that their points shine right through the spun object.

	Step 52	Move the Distance slider just a tad in front of the spun
		object. We're going to add triangles in front.

	Step 53	Make a few triangles. They should obscure the spun object.
		This time, when you click on Redraw, they still obscure the
		object.

	Step 54	Click twice on the Rotate Right button. This is the button
		with the right arrow. It rotates the view to the right, as if
		we were walking around to the left. Now, the front triangles
		should be on the right while the back triangles are on the
		left.

					123

		There is a good chance that some or all of them are no longer
		visible. This is because we are looking at their back sides. A
		triangle can only be seen on one side, the side that was facing
		out when it was created. If we rotate around to the back side
		of a triangle, it becomes invisible.

	Step 55	To check this out, click on the Rotate Right button one more
		time. All of the triangles should be invisible. However, if
		their points are within the Grab Range, these points will still
		be illuminated. This means you can still connect a new triangle
		to the vertices of a triangle that is facing the other way.

	Step 56	Select the Flip command in the Edit menu. This is used to 
		"flip" a triangle around so its back and front faces are
		reversed.

	Step 57	Click on a triangle that is currently invisible. The flip 
		command makes it visible on this side. Experiment a bit with
		the Flip Command. Look at what you've done from different
		angles.

USING SHADING

There is the option of viewing objects as gray shaded rather than colored. This
gives a strong feel for the three dimensional nature of the objects, at the
sacrifice of color.

	Step 58	Turn on shading. Do this by selecting the Shaded option of the
		Draw Style command in the View menu.

	Step 59	Experiment with editing with the object shaded. Move points.
		Add triangles.

	Step 60	Experiment with different Draw Styles. Turn off the drawing
		of Triangles and Points but leave Edges on so that 3-Demon
		draws wire frame objects.

USING TRANSFORMATIONS

At this point, it would be a good idea to read the chapter Transforming an
Object. Having said that, I'll proceed with a tutorial that is simple minded
enough that it won't matter if you read the chapter or not.

We'll use a Transform window to move, rotate, and scale an object.

				124

	Step 61	Go to the Object menu and select Transform. 3-Demon will
		now wait for you to select an object to transform. Click on
		the object you've been editing. A Transform window should 
		materialize at the bottom right corner.

	Step 62	Click on the drag bar (the top) of the Transform window. Now, 
		because this window is selected, if you press the right mouse
		button, the menu that belongs to the Transform window will 
		appear at the top of the 3-Demon screen instead of the standard
		3-Demon menu.

	Step 63	Go to the Transform menu and select Center. Either by Volume
		or By Density is fine.
                
		Your object should be redrawn in the center of the Main View, 
		unless you have shifted the view with the commands in the
		View Control Box.

	Step 64	Select Scale from the Add command in the menu. A Scale
		transformation is created and added to your object. The 
		Transform window should now look like this:

			TRANSFORMATIONS
			Spun Object #    CONVERT
			   SCALE            Scale
			X           L
			Y           O
			Z	    C	
				    K
			X  1.000
			Y  1.000
			Z  1.000

	Step 65	Move one of the X, Y, or Z sliders. See how it results in the
		object expanding or contracting, depending on which way you
		drag the slider.

				125

	Step 66	Turn off the LOCK button by clicking on it once. The LOCK
		button forces scaling to occur equally in all directions. Now, 
		with it disabled, scaling in the X, Y, and Z directions is 
		independent.

	Step 67	Experiment with scaling in the X, Y, and Z directions separately.
		Now you can stretch or shrink in just one direction.

	Step 68	Add a Rotate transformation from the Add command in the 
		Transform menu.

	Step 69	Play with rotation a bit by grabbing the three knobs and
		twirling them.

				126

	Step 70	Finally, add a Move transformation from the same menu.

	Step 71	Play with moving the object.

	Step 72	Find out if it's really true that the order of the
		transformations affects their result. Use the Move command in
		the menu to do this. Select MOVE in the list in the 
		Transformation window. Then, select the Move command. This has
		nothing to do with the MOVE transformation. Instead, it takes a
		transformation and 'moves' it to a different place in the list.
		Having selected Move, click on the SCALE transformation in the
		list. Voila! The list is rearranged.

	Step 73	Using the Move command to rearrange the list, compare 
		rotation prior to a move with rotation after a move. When an
		object is rotated, then moved, it spins around itself. But when
		an object is moved, then rotated, it spins in an orbit that has
		the radius of the move.

	Step 74	Leave the Transform window open and go off to do some other
		task. For example, you could drag points or paint surfaces.
		Meanwhile, the Transform window is still alive and you can
		use it to adjust and move the object while you edit it.

				127

		In fact, several objects can all have their Transform windows
		open at the same time!

That's it with the Tutorial. You're on your own Kiddo.

Don't be afraid to explore.

3-DEMON FILE FORMAT

3-Demon files are in binary, so it's just about impossible to edit them by hand.

So, this chapter is intended only for serious programmers who are interested in
writing software that can read and write the 3-Demon format.

The 3-Demon file format supports 7 different chunk types:

SURF - Surface descriptor list. Each object has a list of these, describing
different colors and surface characteristics. The list can be any length but
must have at least one surface.

VRTX - A vertex list. Each vertex carries the data to describe a point in 3D
space, and each also points to a surface descriptor. Each object has a list of
vertices.

TRNG - Triangle list. Each object has a list of triangles. Each triangle points
to three vertices (unless it is a line, in which case it points to only two) and a
surface descriptor.

OPTR - A matrix operation list. Each object can have a list of mathematical
transformations. The list can be any length. There are three types of operation:
ROTATE, SCALE, and TRANSLATE.

TRAN - A transformation header. This structure carries the operation list and
additional transformation information (which, for reasons that only made sense in
the earlier versions of the program include the name of the object that owns
this transformation list.)

OBJT - An object. If an object has children, they are all embedded recursively
within the parent object. Each object has lists of vertices, triangles and
surfaces, and a transformation structure and list of transformation operations.

SCNE - Finally, an entire scene. This carries all of the objects and all user
definable parameters that effect the display (for example, the position of the
eye and screen icons.)

The format isn't too different from an IFF format. Each chunk type is
introduced with a four byte identifier ("SURF",  "VRTX", etc.) followed

				129

by a byte count of the chunk. If a reader isn't familiar with a chunk type,  it
can simply skip over it.

There is no "FORM" or file type information at the start of the file, rather
just the identifier for the first chunk which must have everything else
embedded in it. So, when a scene is saved from the Project menu, the file we save
is entirely a SCNE chunk. Saving an object from the Object menu creates a file
that is an OBJT chunk.

SURFACES

Every object must save at least one Surface, so that all Triangles and Vertices
can point to it.

The Surface chunk starts off with a header that describes the size of each
surface item (so later releases can support more fields) and how many items there
are. Then, the list of surfaces follows. There are two fields (rgb and renumber)
that just ended up in the file because the whole Surface structure gets copied.
Don't worry about what you stick in those fields when writing.

Some of the surface parameters aren't used by 3-Demon. All of the information
about how the surface reflects light isn't touched by 3-Demon. However, 
different rendering programs use different combinations of these and the
intention is to give the user the opportunity to define what the renderer
should do, even though there is no feedback within the editor.

BYTES	NAME			DESCRIPTION

1	opacity			How opaque this surface is.
30	name			Each surface has a name.
1	reflection		0=non reflective, 255=mirror.
2	id			Id of next surface....

VERTICES

Prior to saving the Triangle list, a list of Vertices is saved.

The Vertex chunk starts off with a header that describes the size of each
vertex item (so later releases can support more fields) and how many items there
are. Then, the list of vertices follows.

The coordinates of the points are stored as fixed point numbers. The high word
hold the integer value, while the low word is the fraction. However, 3-Demon at
this point does not support the fractional part so we effectively have 16 bit
integers shifted left 16 bits. This does provide a safe upgrade path to higher
resolutions.

BYTES	NAME		DESCRIPTION

4	"VRTX"		Chunk header
4	length		Size of chunk
4	item size	Size of each vertex.
4	item count	Number of vertices.
2	id		Id of first vertex (count from 0 up.)
2	surface		Id of surface this points to.
4	X		X coordinate (integer).
4	Y		Y coordinate (integer).
4	Z		Z coordinate (integer).
2	id		Next vertex....

TRIANGLES

The Triangle chunk starts off with a header that describes the size of each
triangle item (so later releases can support more fields) and how many items
there are. Then, the list of triangles follows.

				131

This can also describe a line. If the 'type' field is clear, this is a line and
the vertices that compose it are the first two. If this is a triangle,  'type'
is 1.

The ordering of vertices is critical because whether the vertices are viewed
clockwise or counterclockwise determines whether we are looking at the front or
back face of the triangle. 3-Demon does not display the back face. If you are
writing triangles that come out invisible, simply flip two vertices and they
will face out properly.

BYTES	NAME		DESCRIPTION

4	"TRNG"		Chunk header
4	length		Size of chunk
4	item size	Size of each triangle
4	item count	Number of triangles.
2	vertex a	Id of first vertex this points to.
2	vertex b	Id of second vertex this points to.
2	vertex c	Id of third vertex this points to.
2	surface		Id of surface this points to.
2	poly id		Ignore.
1	type		Triangle=1, Line=0.
2	vertex a	Next triangle....

OPERATIONS

It's not required that these be supported. However, if the user saves an object
that has some radical transformations applied to it, reading without taking
these into consideration could result an object that is an odd shape. So, it
would be good to apply the transformations to the object while reading it in, if
nothing else. The transformations are ordered in the list in the order they are
applied to the object. This is important! If you apply transformations in a
different order, their effect will probably change.

The Operation list chunk starts off with a header that describes the size of
each Operation item and how many items there are. Then, the list of operations
follows.

Each Operation is composed of a command and three long word parameters.
Depending on the operation, the data type of the parameters change: For ROTATE, 
the parameters are angles with a degree range of 0 to 256, integer. For SCALE, 
the parameters are three scaling constants in fast floating point

				132

format. For TRANSLATE, they are fixed point numbers (integers shifted left 16
with a fractional lower 16 bits.)

BYTES	NAME		DESCRIPTION

4	x		X parameter.
4	y		Y parameter.
4	z		Z parameter.
2	command		ROTATE=1, TRANSLATE=4, SCALE=6.
4	x		Next operation....

TRANSFORMATION HEADER

Each operation list belongs to a Transformation header.

This has a name, the transformation list, and a padding of 128 bytes. The name is
actually the name of the object that owns this transformation list.

BYTES		NAME		DESCRIPTION

4		"TRAN"		Chunk header
4		length		Size of chunk
4		item size	Size of transformation data.
10		name		Name.
128		pad		Ignore this.
OPTR size 	operation list  The operation list (see above.)

OBJECT

An object is composed of a list of vertices, a list of surfaces, a list of
triangles, a transformation structure and its list of operations, and a list of
child objects. With this version, there is no additional information that
pertains just to the object, though a variable length field is included for that
purpose.

Although the reader can read the lists in any order, some ordering is important.
The Surface list must precede the Triangle and Vertex lists. Likewise, the
Vertex list must precede the Triangle list.

				133

There must be at least one Surface, although there need not be any Vertices or
Triangles (pointless, though...)

There should be a transform header, if for no other purpose than to supply the
object's name.

There can be zero or more child objects.

BYTES		NAME		DESCRIPTION

4		"OBJT"		Chunk header
4		length		Size of chunk
4		item size	Size of object data (currently 0, none follows.)
0		object data	Empty.
TRAN size	transform header  Transform header chunk.
SURF size	surface list	Surface list chunk.
VERT size	vertex list	Vertex list chunk.
TRNG size	triangle list	Triangle list chunk.
OBJT size	child object	Child object chunk.
OBJT size	child object	Another child object chunk.

When an object is saved as a file, the file name has the extension ".object"
added to it.

SCENE

A Scene is the whole project, which would be all of the objects and a bunch of
data about the current viewing environment.

If you are writing a program that can read and write 3-Demon objects, it might
be best to simply deal with the object format. There isn't much to be gained by
loading and saving scenes since all of the additional data is very 3-Demon
specific. However, if you'd like to be able to read Scenes, it's not that hard.
Ignore the Scene data and read in all of the objects. To save a Scene, set the
Scene data buffer length to 0, so 3-Demon won't replace preset parameters with
potentially dangerous garbage. Then, save your objects one by one.

The SCNE chunk starts off with the size of the entire chunk, followed by the
size of the Scene data, then the Scene data, then the Objects.

BYTES		NAME		DESCRIPTION

4		"SCNE"		Chunk header
4		length		Size of chunk
4		item size	Size of Scene data.
scene data size scene data	Ignore when reading, avoid writing.
OBJT size	object		First object chunk.
OBJT size	object		Another object chunk.
OBJT size	object		And so on...

Scene files end with ".3demon".

GLOSSARY

BACK FACE: A triangle has two sides. In 3-Demon, only one side is displayed. This
makes sense most of the time. For example, a sphere object has all of its
triangles facing outward. The back sides of all of the triangles that make up
the skin of the sphere face inwards, where nobody can see them. These are called
Back Faces. In other cases, a back face is seen, an obvious example being a
triangle floating alone in space. However, 3-Demon will still only display one
side of the triangle. Rotate around the triangles and it disappears.

COORDINATE: At the lowest level, everything in 3D space is described by points.
An object is made up of triangles. A triangle is described by three points.
Each point, in turn is described by three numbers. These numbers are its
distance from the origin along the three axes, X, Y, and Z. These three numbers
are called the "coordinates" of the point.

DEPTH VIEW: 3-Demon's primary display is the Main View. This provides a head on
shot of the object. To give a better feel for how far an object is from the
viewer, the Depth View shows the same scene as viewed from above.

DRAG RANGE: The Drag Range is the range of distance from the viewer within which
you can grab points. Points that are outside of the drag range are either too
close or too far. Points within the drag range are drawn in the Main View, the
rest are not. The Drag Range is depicted in the Depth View as the are between
two "fog banks" of white dots.

EDGES: In 3-Demon, there is a distinction between Edges and Lines. The term Edge
refers to the border of a triangle. An Edge is not a distinct entity in its
own right. A Line is.

FLAT VIEWS: The flat views screen lets you edit an object as two orthographic
projections. In other words, there are two views, one which draws the object with
the Z component of each point missing, the other draws with the Y components
missing. This has the advantage of absolutely no perspective distortion (see
Projection).

HIERARCHY: A useful way to organize objects is a HIERARCHY. In a HIERARCHY, one
object is a parent of several more objects, each of which might be a parent of
even more. And so it progresses down the tree, much like a pyramid. Anything
done to a parent object (move it, save it to disk, etc.) affects all of its
children and grandchildren. The reverse is not so.

				136

HUE: A color can be described in part by its Hue. The hue is the angle in the
color wheel of the color. Hue is used in conjunction with Intensity and
Saturation.

INTENSITY: Intensity is used in conjunction with Hue and Saturation to describe
a color. The intensity of a color is analogous to a light fader. As the
intensity is turned down, the color fades to black.

LINE: Like a Triangle, a Line is a primitive out of which objects are made. And, 
like a triangle, a line can have a surface, the surface is used to draw just the
line.

MAIN VIEW: This is the primary 3-Demon display. It fills up most of the Amiga's
screen and displays the objects that are being worked on.

ORIGIN: The Origin is the center of the 3D world. It has X, Y, and Z coordinates
of 0, 0, 0. It is where the three axes meet.

PERSPECTIVE: See Projection.

POINT: A Point describes a specific location in 3D space. A Point is described
by three coordinates, one for each of the X, Y, and Z axes. There is no other
article in 3-Demon that does this. Both triangles and lines are described
physically by what their endpoints are. If a point moves, the triangle goes with
it. A powerful use of this is the concept of Shared Points, where two or more
triangles share a point. When the point is moved, all triangles that use it bend
with it. This provides much of the power and flexibility of 3-Demon editing.

PROJECTION: Projection is the process of taking a three dimensional object and
putting it on a two dimensional screen, such as the Amiga's.

An orthographic, or flat, projection, of which there are two in Flat Views, simply
draws the picture as if one of the dimensions (X, Y, or Z) is gone.

A perspective projection, which is what the Main View display is, draws objects
from the point of view of an imaginary eye. Objects that are close to the eye
are drawn large, while objects that are far are drawn small. If the objects are
very close to the eye, the difference between near and far becomes very
pronounced and we get a fish eye effect. This is also called perspective
distortion.

REFLECTION: Reflection is a property of a surface. It describes how much of the
light that hits the surface bounces back off of it, is reflected. A very
reflective surface, for example day-glo paint, is bright.

				137

REFRACTION: Refraction is a property of transparent materials. Light bends when
it goes through one transparent material and into another. This is called
refraction.

RENDERING: This is the computational process of taking the description of a
three dimensional scene and creating a two dimensional image. 3-Demon renders
the image in the Main View by computing where all the triangles should be, 
computing shading if required, and drawing the triangles.

ROTATION: See Transformation.

SATURATION: Saturation is used in conjunction with Hue and Intensity to describe
a color. Saturation describes how bold and distinct a color is. As the
saturation is turned down, the color takes on more and more of a gray tone as it
looses its identity.

SCALE: The term Scale is used in several different situations within 3-Demon. In
all cases, the operation of scaling something makes it larger or smaller. The
view might be scaled to "zoom in" or "zoom out", or an object might be scaled to
make it larger or smaller.

SCENE: In 3-Demon, the entire working environment is composed of all objects
loaded, the viewing parameters, and all options that have been set by the user.
This is also called the Scene.

SHADING: When an object is rendered, simply painting all triangles directly with
the colors that are described for them rarely results in a satisfying sight.
This is because in the real world differently angled sides catch different
amounts of light and so are lighter or darker because of it. Recreating this
effect is called Shading.

In rendering programs, shading can get quite sophisticated. You define where one
or more light sources are and how intense each is. Then, the program calculates
how bright or dark each side should be and draws them accordingly.

3-Demon has a less sophisticated, gray scale shading scheme. This assumes there
are two fixed light sources at opposite sides of the object. Any side that
directly faces one of the light sources at a 90 degree angle is painted white.
As the angle moves away, the sides become progressively darker, reaching black at
180 degrees. For 3-Demon's needs, this is very adequate. It provides a strong
feeling for the curvature of the surface, enhancing the three dimensional feel
and thereby making editing easier.

SURFACE: A Surface is used to describe how a particular item reflects light. Some
programs use the term "texture" to describe the same thing.

				138

In 3-Demon, a surface describes a color and has a group of parameters, like
Ambient Reflection, that describe how it reflects light. Every triangle, line, and
point in 3-Demon is painted with a surface.

TRANSFORMATION: A Transformation is a mathematical operation that can be
performed on a point, changing it. There are three transformations that are of
particular interest in graphics work:

	Move, or translation, adds offsets to the X, Y, and Z values of the point.
	This simply shifts an object in space.

	Scale multiplies the point by a number, making it closer or farther from
	the origin, thereby shrinking or stretching it.

	Rotate alters the position of the point by rotating it about the origin
	by some specified angle. By transforming the group of points that
	define an object, we end up transforming the object itself.

VERTEX: See Point.
