                Circus Attractions Review by Herman vd Kamp

=====================================================================

When I got Circus Attractions to try this game out for this review, I didn't
expect it to be as exiting as it turned out to be when I played the game, or
I might to say games.

When  you open the box, you see that it contains a few things.Except for two
diskettes it contains a very nice little clown,made of metal.  The manual is
written in two languages, in english and in german.

Like  I  just  said,  you  can  play  some,  different,  games  with  Circus
Attractions.You  can play:  trampolining, tightrope walking, juggling, knife
throwing and jumping clowns.


>>>Trampolining.

My experience is that trampolining is the most difficult game to play of all
Circus  Attractions games.You play it by moving your joystick up and down to
bounce.It's  difficult  just  because  you have to find out what is the best
point  to  move  the  joystick up en when to move it down.  It did cost me a
whole evening to find it out and it is getting better now, but still I often
move  the  joystick  up or down too early.Move the joystick left or right in
order  to  make  a  forward or backward somersault.  With the firebutton you
slow  the  somersault  down  so you can get your feet right on the trampline
again.


>>>Tightrope walking.

In  with  this  game  you  see  a  lady you have to help balancing.She moves
automatically  forward  on  the  rope.There  are  several  ways  to help her
balance.   Move  the  joystick  left  or right to balance by using her arms.
Move  the  joystick  up/left  or  up/right  to  extreme balance by using her
arms.When the firebutton is pressed, the lady will jump up.  that is what is
called  a  scissorkick.   You  can  make a backward somersault by moving the
joystick  up  and  press  the  firebutton.   It's  even  possible  to make a
handstand  by  moving the joystick down and press the firebutton.  Press the
firebutton again to abort the handstand.

>>>Juggling.

The juggling game is nearly as difficult as the trampolining game.  You have
to  juggle  with  six  balls at the same time.By pressing the firebutton you
accept  the  items from the assistant.If one of the balls falls, it falls on
the  jugglers  toes.  LOOK AT HIS FACE!!  Move the joystick left to make the
juggler's  right  hand  throw the ball.Move the joystick down to balance the
ball  with  his  left  foot.   You  can  make the juggler jump by moving the
joystick up.  Throw a club with the left hand by moving the joystick right.


>>>Knife throwing.

With  this  game  you  have to throw some knives onto a rotating disk with a
lovely  girl  on  it.   You  can  move the joystick in all directions.  Your
assistant  gives  you  the knives.  In order to take a knife, press fire; in
order  to  throw  it,  let go the firebutton.  You should hasten to take the
knives,  because  in  case  you  don't  the  impatient assistant throws them
backward  into  the  audience.   In  order  to  add thrill to this game, the
assistant  tries to hand you a stick of dynamite now and again.  If you take
that,  you  will  explode.   Besides  the rotating disc, there are some more
targets,  giving  you  the oppertunity to increase your score.  For example,
try to hit the cowboy on his most vital parts, if you know what I mean.


>>>Jumping clowns.

Jumping clowns features three clowns and two seesaws.  The two seesaws stand
at the left and the right of the arena, and on each a clown stands ready for
action.   The  third  clown  then jumps down from a platform onto one of the
seesaws, huling his partner up into the air, who then tries to fall onto the
second seesaw in order to catapult the clown waiting there back to the first
seesaw.  This game is repeated until one of the clowns loses breath, balance
or enthousiasm.  Move the joystick left/up or right/up, the clowns jump high
into  the  air,  in  order  to reach a high trajectory to the target seesaw.
Moving  the  joystick left/right gives you a medium high flight.  Moving the
joystick  left/down  or right/down gives you a low flight.  Press fire:  the
clown waiting on the target seesaw changes sides on the seesaw.

I wish you a lot of pleasure and success!
