	This is a list of documentation needed from games that I know exist
as of May 1,1991. Obviously docs to newly released games after this in
1991 are also requested. Several games are preceeded by an * symbol. Those 
are games where the docs are definitely needed to play the game and are
important to this disk series. 
	Send docs, preferably on disk, although if you are lazy and you
wish to send a Xerox of the manual, it is acceptable. Send to:
