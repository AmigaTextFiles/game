OVERVIEW
--------
Skylar Mountain.
Dangerous.  Steep.  Downright scarey.

You were made for this mountain.

Ski like the wind, picking up bonus flags as you go.  Jump over rocks,
branches, and bushes for extra points.  Avoid hitting obstacles -- you
can only fall five times before you are disqualified.

The longer you stay up, the faster you ski and the more points you get
as you travel.  Bonus flags are worth 5,000 points each AFTER you reach
the Finish Line.

Good Luck!


-------------------

it's icon.

TITLE PAGE AND OPTIONS
----------------------
After the game loads, the title page will appear.  Three options will be
shown:  INSTRUCTIONS, HIT THE SLOPES, and EXIT.

INSTRUCTIONS ---- Gives instructions for the game.
HIT THE SLOPES -- Starts the game.
EXIT ------------ Exits the game.  (you can also press the <ESC> key
                                    during gameplay to exit.)

--------
GAMEPLAY
--------
You start the game at the top of Skylar Mountain.  After the starter says
"GO", the game begins.  Control is employed through a joystick (in port
2).  Moving the joystick left or right moves the skier in the same
directions.  Pressing the joystick button causes the skier to jump (over
obstacles like bushes, logs and rocks).

The object of the game is to get to the finish line without being
disqualified.  Falling 5 times results in disqualification.

Flags can be picked up for extra bonus points.  These points however,
are not added to the player's score until he/she makes it to the finish
line.


--------------------------------------------
FALLING DOWN (AND OTHER EMBARRASING MOMENTS)
--------------------------------------------
If the skier falls, the game will ask the player to POSITION SKIER.  This
is done by moving the joystick either left or right to obtain a good
starting position for the skier.  When satisfied, the player may hit the
joystick button to continue play.


-------
SCORING
-------
The longer the skier stays on his skis, the faster he goes down the
mountain.  As speed increases, the increment to the players score
increases.

Jumping over logs, rocks or bushes results in a 500 point bonus added to
the player's score.

Initially, picking up flags has no effect on the player's score.  Not
until after the player crosses the finish line are the flags worth 5,000
points each.


------------------
THE SCORING SYSTEM
------------------
To the right of the game screen are 3 scoring devices.  SCORE, BEST and
BONUS.  SCORE displays the player's current score.  BEST shows the best
score so far, and BONUS shows the number of flags the player has picked
up in a given game.


--------------
DISTANCE TO GO
--------------
Under the scoring devices is a box which contains a representation of
Skylar Mountain.  A small skier shape represents the player's skier and
the distance travelled so far.


----------------
PAUSING THE GAME
----------------
You can pause the game at any time by pressing "P".  To unpause the game,
press any key.


---------
HAVE FUN!

Hope you enjoy the game!!!
