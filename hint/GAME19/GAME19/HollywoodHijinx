HILDEGARDE MONTAGUE BURBANK

Well  pumpkin,Ive finally gone to join Buddy in Paradise.I sure had a lot of
fun  in  life,but nothing lasts forever eh?I will miss hildebub,our home for
so many years.We all had planty of wonderfull times there didnt we?

Well  now its all going to be yours.I know you love the old place as much as
I do.Youll take good care of it.

Your Uncle Buddy and I often talked about this and we agreed that everything
should  go  to  you.   Of  all our nieces and nephews,you were our favouite.
Buddy  gave  me the enclosed photo which he wanted me to give you along with
this letter.


Now dear,

We  are  fond  of you, but Buddy and I worked hard to build our business and
keep up our estate.  We don't intend to just throw it all away.  So although
we  think you are clever enough to manage everything wisely, we need to make
sure.That's why we planned a little test for you.

Hidden  around the house and grounds at Hildebud are ten treasures from your
Uncle  Buddys films.  All you need to do is find the treasures in one night,
and everything will be yours.  Now that doesnt sound too hard does it?

If  you cant find the treasures, too bad sweetie!W e will give the treasures
to some other nieces and nephews.  The one who cracks it gets it.

My  lawyer  will pick you up at 8:00 on the evening of the funeral and drive
you to the Hildebrand.  Good luck pumpkin,

Make your Aunt Hildegarde proud.

BEING OF SOUND MIND AND BODY I DO HEARBY SIGN THIS TESTAMENT IN THE
PRESENCE OF TWO WITNESSES.
