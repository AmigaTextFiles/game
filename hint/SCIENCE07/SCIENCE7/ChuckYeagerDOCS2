Gaining More Disk Space
------- ---- ---- -----
    If you need more disk space on your backup copy, DEL<Dos command>
Dup.exe, Install.bat, and Afscklst.txt from the root directory.

Controlling AFS Planes
----------- --- ------
    You control AFS planes in one of four ways: 1) using a joystick; 2) using
the numeric keypad, 3) using the mouse or 4) using the Maxx computer interface
peripheral. Read the following sections for umportant information regarding
joysticks and Maxx. See "Aircraft and Simulator Controls" for all of AFS'
keypad controls.
    Tandy Joystick Ports: if you own a: Tandy 1000, plug your joystick into
the 'right' port; Tandy 1000SX, plug your joystick into the 'left' port; Tandy
1000EX, plug your joystick into the 'rear' port.
    Recalibrating Joysticks: if your joystick loses synchronization with the
elevators, ailerons, and rudder, center the joystick and hit J to
recalibrate.
    Using the Maxx Computer Interface Peripheral: AFS is compatible with the
Maxx control stick, which simulates an airplane's control yoke. Set the Maxx
throttle slider all the way off(down), and start AFS. When AFS is running,
select Joystick from the Sys menu. If you accidentaly start AFS with the Maxx
throttle in the ON position, center the wheel, slide throttle off(down), and
press J to "calibrate joystick."

Menus
-----
    Press the Up or Down cursor key and press Enter to select a command from
the Main menu.electing a Main meny commands opens a menu containing the titles
of several pull-down menus. If you choose Intro Flight, Test Flight, or
Airplane Racing from the Main meny, you begin flying immediately. Press the
Esc key or the Spacebar tp see the menu bar in one of those cases. Select a
pull-down menu using the Right or Left cursor key, and press Enter to pull it
down. Press the Right or Left cursor key to open a different pull-down menu.
Press Esc to close the menu or the menu bar.
    Each pull-down menu contains commands,usually with first command selected.
Press the Up or Down cursor key to select a command, and press Enter to
activate it and return to flying. Active commands are red. Inactive commands
are white. Unavailable commands are blue. Select the Main Menu command from
the Option menu to return to the main menu. Many menus also contain blank
space that you can fill in with your own flight lessons or formation flight
maneuvers (see manual).

Configuring AFS For Your Computer
----------- --- --- ---- --------
    AFS attempts to configure itself for your computer each time you start the
program. However, if you have a color graphics adapter, AFS can't tell whether
you have an RGB or composite color monitor. AFS defaults to RGB, so change the
default setting in order to see colors on a composite color monitor. You can
also change other configuration items to match your own preferences. To change
the system settings: choose Intro Flight from the main menu and press Esc
until the menu bar appears across the top of the screen; select Sys in the
menu bar and press Enter. The SYStem configuration menu appears, listing
various configuration options (See "Sys Menu" below); use the cursor keys to
select an option you want, then press Enter. AFS closes the menu bar and
returns you to flying; to make another menu change, press Esc or the Spacebar
to open the menu bar.

Sys Menu
--- ----
RGB: sets the colors and character style for an RGB color monitor.
Composite: sets the colors and character style for a composite color monitor.
New Palette: changes the screen to a color scheme appropriate for an EGA card.
Composite 2: changes the screen to a color scheme appropriate for the Tandy
PCs.
Sound: turns on sound effects.
No Sound: turns off sound effects.
Joystick: chooses the joystick of Maxx for operating ailerons, elevators, and
rudder.
Mouse: chooses the mouse (Microsoft type) for operating the ailerons,
elevators, and rudder. This option is only available if you have
installed a mouse driver (see your mouse documentation for information on use
and installation).
Slow Mouse: chooses an older (white with green buttons) Microsoft-type mouse
for operating the ailerons, elevators, and rudder. This option is only
available if you have installed a mouse driver (see your mouse documentation
for information on use and installation).
Keyboard: chooses the arrow keys on the keyboard for oprating the ailerons,
elevators, and rudder.
Center Image: shifts the entire displayed image to the right a bit,
compensating for an off-center image.

Save Setup: saves the current airplane and palette/display settings so they
will be in effect the next time you start AFS.

The Flight Recorder and Buying the Farm
--- ------ -------- --- ------ --- ----
    The flight recorder may be damaged if you buy the farm while it is
running. So you may get unpredictable results if you try to replace an auger
job.

Removing Recordings from Menus
-------- ---------- ---- -----
    When you record maneuvers in Formation Flight, or lessons in Flight
Instruction, your recordings are added to the AFS menus. These menu items
reside in the AFS directory on disk a the file names you assign during the
recording session. For instance, if you record a maneuver called "Figure8,"
AFS creates files in the AFS directory, but all you see is the command
"Figure8" in the Maneuver menu. To remove the "Figure8" command from the
Maneuver menu, choose Return to DOS from the Main menu, and at the DOS prompt
type: DEL \AFS\FIGURE8.*. This command deletes all of the "Figure8" files, and
when you start AFS, the command is deleted from the Maneuver menu. This
procedure also works for the recordings you make in Basic, Advanced, and
Aerobatic Flight instruction. Simply use the name you assign to the recording
in the same manner: DEL \AFS\MYSTUNT.* (replace MYSTUNT with your own
recording name).

Using the Clear Race Command
----- --- ----- ---- -------
    The Clear Race command in Airplane Racing removes your race opponents
permanently -- even if you quit and restart the program. Each time you
successfully complete the course, AFS adds a new opponent until you reach the
maximum number of opponents for your computer's memory configuration. If you
want to reinstate all of the race opponents without running the course a
number of times, you must reinstall AFS on your backup disk.

Printing the Test Flight Checklist
-------- --- ---- ------ ---------
    There is a duplicate of the test flight checklist (Appendix B of the
manual) on your AFS master disk. The checklist is stored on disk as a text
file called AFSCKLST.TXT. If you have a printer, use the DOS print command to
print as many checklists as you need (see your DOS user's manual for more
information on printing text files).

Using a TV as a Composite Monitor
----- - -- -- - --------- -------
    Use your VCR to turn your color TV into a composite monitor. Plus the
composite Video Out signal from your computer's graphics adapter into the
Video In jack of your VCR. Switch your VCR to Camera mode so it recognizes
the video signal, and you have a composite color monitor. You may need to
asjust your TV in order to match the colors onscreen with those described in
the manual. If the display runs off the left edge of the screen, choose Center
Image from the Sys menu to shift the image right.

Enhancing AFS Performance
--------- --- -----------
    You can greatly enhance AFS' performance by using the CONFIG.SYS file on
your DOS system disk to increase the number of file buffers available. (See
your DOS user's manual for information on modifying the CONFIG.SYS file.) Add
the following line to CONFIG.SYS: BUFFERS = 24. Also, without a CONFIG.SYS
file, you can race against only two opponents. To race against five opponents,
add this line: FILES = 8. The changes you make to CONFIG.SYS take effect only
after you reboot the computer.
