to the game.

STARTER DUNGEON (Brilhasti Ap Tarj)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Located in Skara Brae at the Temple  of the Mad God.

Tell the Priest : TARJAN upon initial entry.

Within this dungeon you are looking for a certain ALIGNING word which you
may tell to the GOOD priest.  The true word he seeks is chaos.

After telling the Priest what he REALLY wants to know, you will be lead to
the dungeon of Brilhasti Ap Tarj.  This dungeon consists of about 4 levels
and it should be noted that for powerful characters this dungeon serves no
real significance to the game.  Within this dungeon you will come upon 2 of
the following Riddles which must be answered in order to gain access into
the lower levels.

I Have No Lips, Yet My
Kiss Is Deadly,
I am not a Razor Yet,
My after my Carass,
You need not shave again,
Your best friend,
I Will Kill You.

ANSWER: sword

Not sure about this next one as to the exact wording but it is something
like:

Light bleeds me,  and
kills me,
yet before and after,
I am there.

ANSWER: shadow

Accompanying these riddles in the same dungeon are 3 messages about
the wards Brilhasti has put upon his dungeon.

1. Spin, or be Spun.
2. Only a fool would frontly attack the second ward.
3. --forgot it..not important--

The first ward is a room of spinners, I have never found out what happen
if I didn't follow the spinners on the edge of the walls around to the
opposite wall from starting point and to the opening, but my guess is
something to the effect of a spider (remember..OR BE SPUN??) would be
waiting.

The second ward is followed the same as the first, follow the sides of the
walls around to the opposite wall and into the central opening..and do it
to the third if possible..Like I said, I can't remember everything.  That
should get you through most of the wards, Brilhasti is in a small room, I
think a 1 x 2 room.  Anyways, he wasn't extremely hard for my dudes to kill
(of course, I took my characters from Bard's Tale 2).  This is not a
guarantee, but I and 3 other people have taken 1st Level Chronomancers and
Bards with our groups and upon the death of Brilhasti, recieved 300000
experience points and were BOOSTED up to level 36 for the new level
characters, this brings the Chronomancer up to level 7 in spells too!

ARBORIA
~~~~~~~
First off, get an acorn or 2 from the acorn tree.  Leave the Arefolia
leaves alone as they aren't worth their purpose (breathing underwater).

Next locate the lake and the old fishermans hut (who incidentally likes
spinach).  Enter the old guys hut and talk to him.  Offer him a fair amount
of money and he'll teach one of your spell casters the GILL spell which
allows you to breath underwater longer than arefolia.  Give this spell to
your most powerful magic user as you'll need the spell a lot.

Now, enter the palace underneath the lake, cast the Gill spell and
move:

North 1.
West 3.
West 1.
Phase or Wall Warp a Doorway to the West.
Move completely West and then North 1 above the western doorway.
Phase door to the west.
Move completely West.

Keep doing this until you come to the spring of life.  Once you've
located the spring of life, use a canteen and use it to get at least
2 samples of the water, you'll need it.

Exit the opposite of the above.

VALLARIAN'S TOWER
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Most of this is pretty easy and it has only 1 puzzle that I know
of.  I believe on the 3rd level, when you take the stairs you'll
see a great Disc with an acorn size hole.  Place the acorn in
the hole and then Use the canteen or wineskin which had the water of
life.  The acorn will bloom into a wonderous oak tree and the disk
will be lifted and a doorway revealed.

Go through the doorway, up the stairs, and the Nightspear is
practically yours.

TSOJANTH GARNOTH
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Where do these people get these names????

Ok, this is a pretty straightforward dungeon too, just takes a little
time mapping.  The deeper down you go, the closer to Mr. T. you
get.  Once you find him, kill him as best you can.  Once dead, take
his head and heart.  The Nightspear will hold his spirit forever.

Now, exit the dungeon and proceed into the town.  Go to the Kings
castle and speak with the king after seeing the Head of Tso.. he
will allow you access into the sacred grove.

SACRED GROVE
~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is just a big maze, not too difficult (use the Online Map [?] with
RETURN to see every place you haven't been).  Once you locate Vallarian's
tomb, enter, and you'll see an eternal flame..don't leave now or your hair
will get singed.  Place whats-his-name's heart into the bowl inside
Vallarians chest.  Now use some Water of Life.  Now his heart should start
pumping (feel like Dr. Frankenstein??).

To the East now will be located a new door.  Follow this door around and
eventually you'll come to Vallarian's Bow and Arrows.  Return with them to
the old geezer at the review board.

GELIDIA
~~~~~~~
Locate the Ice Keep as soon as possible or you'll start freezing.

Once you've entered the keep, you'll find a lot of magic mouths saying
'Speak Thy Name Defender', all over.  You may Answer: Hawkslayer or Alendar,
in either case a stairway up will be revealed.  The upper level of the keep
has nothing of interest and is a decoy.

There are 3 spots (9N/10E) (9/1W) (0/10) where doorways are blocked by
various wards accompanied by a riddle.  These riddles are a spell for each
line of the riddle which you must cast in order to break the ward guarding
the doorway.

Lift The Veil (levitation)
Then Counter it (anti-magic
False Door Frees True Door (door phase)

Wolf to Sate Hunger (instant wolf)
A hero True, but not one at all (wind hero)
Focus its attention (force focus)
But better not be seen at all (invisibility)

Bright Light (greater revelation)
Loud Thunder (shock sphere)
Whispered Terror Term (fear)
Flaming Guide to lead the way (summon elemental)

Each of the doorways will reveal a tower, a Grey, White, and Black tower.
Within the highest level of the grey tower, you will find a phrase
telling you that your goal is a broken cross.  This cross is not
visible unless you are mapping or are using the online map.  If you
phase the door to the EAST while standing on this message spot, you'll
enter the inner chamber whereby you'll find the Grey Wizards.  Kill these
guys and take the Lens.  

The other 2 towers are fairly easy, but as with a lot of the dungeons to
follow, you'll NEED to phase doors eventually.  Once you have obtained
all 3 lenses, return to the Ice Keep and proceed to coordinates (9N/4E) and
place (USE) the 3 lenses.  They will open up Lanatir's tomb.  Once inside
the tomb and after you have located a puzzle which asks for a name of
Lanatir's Blood, type: CALA.  This was skillfully placed in the grey tower.
When you went up the stairs they put some more stairs on the same spot so
that you'd be tempted to go up rather than map this level on which the
answer to Lanatir's blood kindred was named.

After this you should have no trouble, return to the old guy at the review
board and prepare for Lucencia.

LUCENCIA
~~~~~~~~
Ah, such is true love, eh?  Poor Cyanis who loved Alliria so much, and
still today in his wretched state he guards the enterance to Alliria's Tomb
from afar in his own tower.  

Now, Cyanis was a wacked out flower child, he could have started his
own little commune in Oregon, but instead chose to grow roses on
Lucencia.  Now, before you can enter Alliria's Tomb, you have to retrieve:

A White Rose
A Yellow Rose
A Red Rose
A Blue Rose
...and from the bush that bares no roses, a Rainbow Rose.

First off, you have to go into the Violet Mountain, where lies the rainbow
dragon (don't you love these color coded scenarios?).  He's fairly easy for
you to kill.  When he's dead, get the 'ol canteen ready, its Miller Time!
Yep, that's right, pour some of that shimmering blood into your nearest
available waterskin or canteen.

Exit and go to our little bush that has no blooms and poor some blood on it.
Voila! a Rainbow Rose will appear.  Take it.  Now you're ready for Cyanis.

He's a fairly simple dude to find, just follow the stairs up.  Once you do
find him (it will be in a spiral chamber), he'll first sit crying, 'Why Why
why??', leave the room and come back and he'll go wacko, claiming you killed
his girl, Alliria.  Kill him as best as you see fit and take his triangle.

Leave and go to Alliria's Tomb.  Again, nothing important until you come to a
great black ball or disk, use the triangle and the disk will shatter, giving
way to a doorway.  Enter this doorway and go up and you are in Alliria's
Tomb.  Now, its all a matter of answering questions.

The Flower of the Ancient Link is the RED ROSE.
The Flower of Truth is the WHITE ROSE.
The Flower of Valor is the BLUE ROSE.
The Flower of Nature is the YELLOW ROSE.
Alliria's Flower is the RAINBOW ROSE.

Again, Voila, after going through and giving the ladies the roses, you'll
have access to Alliria's Belt.

Return to 'ol grandpa at the review board.

KINESTIA
~~~~~~~~
The Place of Machines!

Well, first off, you have to locate 2 keys, a Right key, and a Left
key.  If you found Ferofist, he kicks off and leaves you the following clue:

Bright Hand, True Hand
Thine are the months of 6 summers.

Sinister Hand, Dark Hand,
Three plagues upon each finger.

In Opposition, you ward the lair of my foolish deaty.

These are clues as to how many times to turn the keys inside the portal
in the workshop.

The Right Key (bright hand) is to be turned 18 times (6 x 3 months of summer)
and the Left is to be turned 15 times (5 fingers with 3 plagues).

Now, after gaining the keys and opening the portal, you are in
Urmech's Domain.  Urmech is this smart robot-type dude created by Ferofist,
who in turn created tons of his kind who went on a rampage and
destroyed all the dwarfs.  Eventually on the first level you'll find a pit
of Pitch, enter this pit and use your GILL spell again, and you'll find
another way up or down (can't remember).  This new area is Urmech's
Sanctum.  Find Urmech and when he asks you if we can settle this in a
peaceful manner, say YES, and he'll give you what you want AND let you try
out his latest gizmo which converts fighters into magicians (GEOMANCERS).

Return to the old guy at the review board.

TENEBROSIA (Nowhere)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Now this is sorta tricky...

You have to first go into the Shadow Canyon and retrieve the shadow lock.
If you find the spot where it tells you a Castle is only as weak as its
strongest wall, go EAST and find an Alcove (a wall going inward from the
rest of the wall) and phase door here.  This is the only entrance to the
inner chamber.  Within this massive inner chamber you'll find the shadow
lock.  Be sure and use the online map or you'll get lost.

Exit the canyon.

Now you must go to the (Gooey Stuff) Tar Pits and retrieve some tar from
the fountain in the center of the pits (very dangerous business!) by
using your canteen.  Exit the pits when done.

Gee, we're almost ready for the main dungeon!

Now, locate in the wilderness, the Dark COPSE, and enter it.  Within
the copse you'll find something resembling a PIT surrounded by trees.
When you are near this area, use the tar, the trees are so dry that they
burst into flames and allow access to the thing which turns out to be a
portable door.  Exit the Copse.

Now find the MIDDLE of NOWHERE, there's no mistaking this place, it tells
you that you are in the middle of nowhere when you get there.  Now
use the door, then use the lock and voila, you're now in Sceadu's domain.
Enter the dungeon and locate the portal down.  Once you are in the 2nd
level, move your party north to the exact center of the dungeon.
Phase the northern door, move west, then north, and walk through the
eastern door, and there awaiting you will be Sceadu himself.  Knock him
off and you're in business again.

Return to Old Man Wrinkles at the review board.

TARMALITIA
~~~~~~~~~~
Ok, now we're in the land that time doesn't know about.  Here we have Nazis
and Romans and all sorts of dudes running around killing and maiming.  Your
first stop is Berlin.  Now the object of these 9 cities is to attach the
right Ghostly Death's Head with the right City.  Here is a list of which
ones go to which:

Troy      : Ares
K'un Wang : Yen-lo-wang
Rome      : Mars
Hiroshima : Susa-no-o
Stalingrad: Svarazic
Nottingham: St. George
Wasteland : Sdiabm
Berlin    : Tyr

True Name : Werra

Once the sequence is completed, you'll have access to Tarmalitia, where ALL
of the warriors come together.  Do not Go Far East or you'll end up back in
Skara Brae, head south.  Werra is located in the southwestern area and he's
a pretty strange guy.  You kill him and he falls over dead laughing about
what a great fight it was.  Get his items and you can use the Northeastern
exit to Skara Brae if you want.

Return to the old guy.

Mourning time.  Well, you obtained all of the items the old guy wanted
but only return to find him dripping with blood.  Tarjan payed him a visit.
But before he dies the old guy tells you that in the building across from
the exitway of Skara Brae he has hidden all of the items, and they are
now for you to bare.  Then he slumps over and dies.

Retrieve the items and head south to the bubbling, noxious fumed, yellow
water area and cast an EVIL spell (chronomancer should now have it). 
You are now in Malefia, Tarjan's domain.

By now, if you haven't learned the NUKE spell from the Wizard's Guild in
Tenebrosia, you're in deep trouble.  The critters in here come with 9999 hit
points, guaranteed.  The main goal of this dungeon, Tarjan, will never be
reached unless you map like crazy.  All 3 dungeon levels are 22 x 22. 0-21
north and 0-21 East.  Before Tarjan, you have to locate 6 statues, each
pertaining to a certain god.  Use that particular God's item on the statue
and a phrase will appear.  After you have located all 6 statues and activated
them, you should locate Werra's Statue, or where it was situated (depending
on the order you found the statues in) and go around the corner.  Where there
once was an outline of a door, now stands a real door.  Pop on through.
Beyond this door lies a Sacrificial gathering and they decide you will make a
lovely sacrifice.  Beat the Hell out of these dudes as best as you know how.
WARNING:  You'll need a LOT of harmonic, crystal gems, or flare crystals for
these guys.  Have at least 2 fighters who can do critical hits well.  Strike
at the VORTEX's with your fighters and NUKE the rest.  You'll probably need
some assistance from DIVA (Divine Intervention) also to bring back your dead
dudes, if you have enough spell points, cast the DIVA spell with your lowest
going from 7-1, magic user slot..i.e. 7 is lowest. That way if your people
are dying quickly, if the magic user is in back far enough then he can re-
resurrect his friends as well as score a few points of damage on the enemy.

After defeating these guys, you'll next come up to the lava pit, where there
is yet another legion of doom awaiting you.  These guys are the hardest to
kill.  If you can kill these guys, you can kill anything.  Proceed as
before.

Once all are killed, move east and you'll be teleported to Tarjan's private
domain, a spiral chamber.

Follow it around, but when you come to the end, re-energize all of your
magic users, heal all your people, put a defensive order in, fighters first,
magic guys last, negative armor class (AC) before positive, and higher hit
points before lower.  Now, phase the door in the final spot (check the
online map) and you and tarjan come face to 90 feet away, face.

Kill off all of the main monsters, they are pretty easy, just NUKE them
all.  When you and Tarjan are alone, cast a PREC spell, because 'ol Tarjan
gets lonely really quick and tries to summon more.  Once you have done this
its just a matter of Cat and Mouse, although who the mouse is depends on the
strength of your party.  I just walked up to him and did some Kung-Fu, Monk
Style on him.  He's a real wimp.  Just use a monk or fighter to knock the
hell out of him and you've achieved your goal!
