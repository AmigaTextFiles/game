                          SOME TIPS FOR YA!


    RADAR  BLUE DOTS ARE YOUR NETS & PUPS
    RADAR  BROWN DOTS ARE DRIODS
    WHEN MENU COMES UP GOTO BACKUP AND LAY 4 NETS AND 4 PUPS ONTO MAP
    WHEN IN ARMOURY MAKE SURE YOU GET THE SUIT OR WHEN WALKING ABOUT
    YOUR AIR SUPPLY WILL RUN OUT FAST.
    ON TAKE OFF PRESS E FOR ENGINES.H FOR HOVER.PULL BACK MOUSE AND
    PRESS B FOR SPEED ONCE YOUR ABOVE BUILDING PRESS F FOR FLIGHT MODE
    FIRST HEAD FOR YOUR BLUE DOTS ON THE RADAR.
    FIND THE NET MISSILE PODS AND HOVER ABOVE THEM TO PICK THEM UP
    BE CAREFULL NOT TO HOVER ABOVE THE PUPS OR YOU WILL DESTROY THEM
    ONCE YOU HAVE PICKUP THE NETS PRESS N TO USE THEM.THEN FLY TOWARDS
    THE BROWN DOTS TO FIND THE DRIODS USE THE ROADS ITS SAFER.HIT TO
    MANY BUILDINGS AND YOUR DEAD DUDE!  ONCE YOU FIND A DRIOD WHEN YOUR
    CLOSE IT WILL LOCK ON THEN LET THE BASTARD HAVE IT IT WILL THROW A
    NET OVER THE DRIOD.CUT ENGINES AND LEAVE THE SHIP PRESS S TO ARREST
    AND THE P.U.P WILL BE SUMMOND.THATS ABOUT AS FAR AS I KNOW TRY WALKING
    INTO THE DRIOD ALSO DONT TRY WALKING ABOUT AT THE TOP OF BUILDINGS
    YOU MIGHT FALL OFF.
