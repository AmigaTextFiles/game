           THE DOX TO BATTLE COMMAND TYPED IN BY <><SCOOTER><>
           +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

THE WORLD:

THE WORLD OF BATTLE COMMAND IS DEPICTED IN SOLID-3D.THE REALISTIC LANDSCAPE IS
POPULATED BY HILLS,TREES AND BUILDINGS,CRISS CROSSED BY RIVERS,ROADS,RAILWAY
TRACKS AND ELECTRIC PYLONS.
THE GAME IS PLAYED AT 24 TIMES REAL TIME,ONE DAY OF PLAY TIME IS ONE HOUR OF
REAL TIME,AND THERE IS A DAY/NIGHT CYCLE LASTING 1 HOUR.ONE
`MISSION`,HOWEVER,DOES NOT FOLLOW IMMEDIATELY AFTER ANOTHER-YOU COULD FINISH 1
MISSION AT DAWN AND START THE NEXT AT MIDNIGHT.`MISSIONS`CAN TAKE PLACE AT ANY
TIME OF THE DAY OR NIGHT.

PLAYING BATTLE COMMAND:

THE ACTION IN BATTLE IS SPLIT UP INTO A NUMBER OF SEPERATE MISIONS,EACH WITH A
DIFFERENT OBJECTIVE THAT IS OUTLINED IN THE MISSION BRIEFING AT THE BEGINNING
OF EACH ENCOUNTER.
THE NATURE OF THE MISSIONS VARY FROM REQUIRING STRAIGHT FORWARD ARCADE
SKILLS(SUCH AS THE STARTER MISSION)TO THOSE OF A MORE COMPLEX NATURE.WHERE YOU
WILL BE EXPECTED TO USE REASONING AND DEDUCTIVE SKILLS,IN ADDITION TO A QUICK
TRIGGER FINGER.
YOU WILL FIND THAT,WHILE THERE IS NO SET ORDER ORDER IN WHICH TO ATTEMPT THE
MISSIONS,SOME MAY REQUIRE EQUIPMENT TO BE FITTED TO YOUR MAULER THAT IS NOT
AVAILABLE TO YOU UNTIL EARLIER MISSIONS HAVE BEEN COMPLETED.
THE FORMAT OF EACH MISSION IS THE SAME,HOWEVER,AFTER MAKING YOUR MISSION
SELECTION AND READING THE BRIEFING,YOU EQUIP YOUR MAULER AND CLICK ON THE
`START MISSION` BOX.
AN ANIMATION WILL NOW BE DISPLAYED SHOWING THE HELICARRIER CARRYING YOUR
MAULER FLYING IN TO DROP YOU AT THE BEGINNING OF THE MISSION.
THE SCREEN VIEW CHANGES TO THE VIEW OF THE MAULER-YOU NOW HAVE FULL CONTROL.TO
COMPLETE THE `MISSION` SUCCESSFULLY YOU HAVE TO ACHIEVE YOUR MISSION OBJECTIVE
AND THEN RENDEVOUZ WITH THE HELICARRIER AGAIN AT MAP CO-ORDINATES SHOWN ON THE
MISSION BRIEFING.
AT THIS POINT AN ANIMATION IS DISPLAYED OF THE HELICOPTER FLYING IN TO PICK
YOU UP,AND YOU ARE SHOWN A REPORT ON THE MISSION WHICH ALSO INFORMS YOU OF THE
SCORE YOU HAVE ACHIEVED.


CONTROLS:

THE BATTLE COMMAND USER INTERFACE HAS BEEN DESIGNED TO BE AS INTUITIVE AND AS
FLEXIBLE AS POSSIBLE,ALLOWING YOU TO CHOOSE EXCLUSIVELY KEYBOARD CONTROL,A
COMBINATION OF KEYBOARD AND MOUSE(OR JOYSTICK),OR PREDOMINATLY MOUSE(OR
JOYSTICK)
THE MAJORITY OF THE FUNCTIONS IN BATTLE COMMAND CAN BE ACCESSED USING MOUSE
ONLY.ON PRE-MISSION SCREENS,THE CURSOR IS MOVED BY THE OBVIOUS
UP/DOWN,LEFT/RIGHT MOVEMENTS,WITH THE LEFT HAND MOUSE BUTTON BEING USED FOR
SELECTING OR DE-SELECTING.

ACTIVE MODE:

DURING ACTUAL MISSIONS,THE ACTIONS OUTLINED ABOVE ARE THE SAME ACTIONS THAT
CONTROL THE MOVEMENT OF THE MAULER ITSELF AND THE FIRING OF THE WEAPONS
SYSTEMS.SO HOW DO YOU SELECT A FUNCTION WITHOUT USING THE KEYBOARD?.THIS IS
SOLVED BY SWITCHING BETWEEN ACTIVE AND PASSIVE MODES.
ACTIVE MODE IS A DEFAULT DURING A `MISSION`,WHERE THERE IS NO CURSOR SHOWN ON
SCREEN AND THE MOVEMENTS OF THE MOUSE CORRESPOND WITH THE MOVEMENT OF THE
MAULER.AT THIS TIME ALL OTHER FUNCTIONS CAN BE ACCESSED VIA SINGLE KEYBOARD
STROKES AS SHOWN IN THE KEY GUIDE SYSTEM.

IN ACTIVE MODE THE LEFT MOUSE BUTTON ACTS AS A FIRE BUTTON FOR YOUR WEAPONS
SYSTEMS.

PASSIVE MODE:

PRESSING THE RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON WHILE IN ACTIVE MODE TAKES YOU TO PASSIVE
MODE.THE MOUSE NOW CONTROLS THE CURSOR THAT HAS APPEARED ON SCREEN.AND YOU CAN
ACTIVATE DEVICES ON THE CONSOLE BY CLICKING WITH THE LEFT MOUSE BUTTON.DURING
PASSIVE MODE YOU HAVE NO DIRECT CONTROL OVER THE MOVEMENT OF THE MAULER.YOU
CAN RETURN TO ACTIVE MODE BY PRESSING THE RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON AGAIN.
IF USING A JOYSTICK OR THE KEYBOARD ONLY SEE THE KEY GUIDE SECTION(LATER ON IN
THIS TEXT)FOR NDETAILS OF HOW THE CONTROL SYSTEM WORKS WITH THESE DEVICES.
FOR A STEP-TO-STEP GUIDE ON HOW TO SELECT A BATTLE COMMAND MISSION AND
ARM-EQUIP AND RUN YOUR MAULER,READ THROUGH THE `YOUR FIRST MISSION` SECTION OF
THIS MANUAL.

THE MAULER:

YOU UNDER TAKE BATTLE COMMANDS MISSIONS IN A MAULER CLASS ASSAULT TANK,A
HEAVILY ARMOURED BUT HIGHLY MOBILE GENERAL PURPOSE WEAPONS PLATFORM,BECAUSE
ALL MISSIONS TAKE PLACE BEHIND ENEMY LINES-DUE TO A STALEMATE THAT HAS LONG
DEVELOPED IN THE ULTR WAR-YOU ARE DELIVERED TO THE VICINITY OF THE MISSION
OBJECTIVE AND RETRIEVED FROM A PRE-ARRABGED PICK UP POINT BY A HELICARRIER,A
FAST STEALTH HELICOPTER WITH A LARGE PAYLOAD CAPACITY.

THE MAULER ITSELF IS DESIGNED PRIMARILY FOR FLEXIBILITY.IN ADDITION TO ITS
STANDARD EQUIPMENT IT HAS SECONDARY EQUIPMENT SLOTS THAT ENABLE SPECIALIST
DEVICES TO BE FITTED TO THE TANK WHEN NEEDED-THESE WILL BE FITTED BY THE
MAINTENANCE CREW AUTOMATICALLY BEFORE THE MISSION STARTS.

THE WEAPONS SYSTEMS THEMSELVES ARE TOTALLY UNDEDICATED WITH 4 WEAPON MODULES
THAT ALLOW THE TANK TO CARRY ANY SELECTION OF WEAPON PAYLOADS,LIMITED ONLY BY
ITS PAYLOAD CAPACITY.THE MAULER CAN THEREFORE BE CONFIGURED TO MEET ALMOST ANY
MISSION REQUIREMENT.

STANDARD  EQUIPMENT:

THIS IS THE BASIC EQUIPMENT ALWAYS AVAILABLE ON YOUR MAULER.

ENGINE: THIS DELTA DYNAMICA GAS TURBINE DEVELOPING AROUND 2000 BRAKE HORSE
POWER AT MAXIMUM OUTPUT,GIVES THE MAULER A SPEED OF AROUND 90 MPH,NOTE POWER
CAN BE LOST THROUGH DAMAGE BY ENEMY FIRE.

VELOCITY GUAGE: THIS GAUGE APPEARS ON THE CONTROL PANEL AS A VERTICAL BAR
INDICATING THE VELOCITY OF THE MAULER .GREEN DENOTES SPEED..RED REVERSE.

FUEL GAUGE: AS WITH THE VELOCITY GAUGE THIS APPEARS ON THE CONTROL PANEL AS A
VERTICAL BAR GRAPH.THERE IS NOWHERE,OFFICIALLY,TO REFUEL BEHIND ENEMY LINES-IF
YOU RUN OUT,YOU`RE STUCK...UNLESS YOU KNOW DIFFERENT THAT IS!!

COMPASS: THIS IS A DISPLAY ON THE CONSOLE WITH THE SYMBOLS `N`..`S`..`W` ..`E`
MARKED ON IT.AS THE PLAYER TURNS,THE DISPLAY MOVES LEFT OR RIGHT TO SHOW THE
DIRECTION THE PLAYER IS FACING. THE DISPLAY WRAPS AROUND AS THE PLAYER TURNS A
FULL CIRCLE.

RADAR: THE RADAR IS AN ADVANCED TYPE,WITH A BUILT IN RECOGNITION SYSTEM THAT
ASSIGNS A TYPE TO EVERY DIFFERENT OBJECT ON THE BASISI OF ITS THREAT TO THE
MAULER. THESE OBJECT TYPES ARE DISPLAYED AS DIFFERENT COLOURED DOTS ON THE
RADAR SCREEN ON TOP OF THE MAP OF THE LOCAL AREA RETRIEVED FROM THE RADAR
COMPUTERS MEMORY.

THE COLOURS ASSIGNED TO EACH OBJECT ARE:

                 [-AMIGA/ST/VGA-]   [-ECA-]         [-CGA-]

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECONDARY EQUIPMENT:

THIS IS EQUIPMENT THAT IS NOT ALWAYS FITTED TO THE MAULER. IF A PARTICULAR
PIECE OF EQUIPMENT IS REQUIRED IN A MISSION,IT IS AUTOMATICALLY FITTED.

[REAR VIEW CAMERA] : SHOWS A VIEW FROM THE BACK OF THE MAULER IN THE AUX
MONITOR.THE ONLY CONTROL IS ON/OFF BUTTON BELOW THE AUX MONITOR.EYES IN THE
BACK OF THE HEAD ARE SOMETIMES USEFUL!!

[NIGHT-SIGHT] :ALLOWS YOU TO SEE AT NIGHT AND LOW LEVELS USING INFRA RED
SENSITIVE OPTICS,NORMAL 3D VIEWS ON THE MAIN CONSOLE DISPLAY AND THE AUX
MONITOR,IF APPROPRIATE,ARE REPLACED BY A LOWER RESOLUTION DISPLAY IN SHADES OF
GREY....USING THE NIGHT SIGHT DURING THE DAY WILL OVERLOAD IT AND YOU WILL BE
UNABLE TO SEE ANY DETAIL-AS ALL OBJECTS AND THE GROUND WILL BE SHOWN IN A
SINGLE SHADE OF WHITE SILHOUETTED AAGAINST THE HORIZON.
OVERLOADING THE NIGH SIGHT WILL ALSO DAMAGE ITS SENSITIVE OPTICS.THE CONTROL
FOR THIS DEVICE IF FITTED IS A SINGLE ON/OFF SWITCH BELOW THE AUX MONITOR.

[BINOCULARS]:MAGNIFYS YOUR MAIN VIEW SCREEN ONTO THE AUX SCREEN BY A FACTOR OF
2,4 OR 8 TO SHOW GREATER DETAIL ON OBJECTS AND OBJECTS TOO SMALL TO BE VISIBLE
NORMALLY. THE DEVICE CAN BE ENABLED AND DISABLED USING AN ON/OFF SWITCH UNDER
THE AUX MONITOR. THERE IS ALSO A ROTARY SWITCH TO THE LEFT OF THE AUX MONITOR
TO ADJUST THE MAGNIFICATION.

[HOMING SCANNER] :THIS IS LOCKED ONTO A PARTICULAR OBJECT AT THE START OF THE
MISSION,JUST LIKE A COMPASS IS PERMANTLY LOCKED ONTO NORTH.IT SHOWS YOU IF THE
MAULER IS CURRENTLY HEADING TOWARDS THIS OBJECT,AND IF NOT,WHICH DIRECTION TO
TURN IN ORDER TO BE DOING SO.
THE DEVICE IS VERY SIMILAR IN OPERATION TO THE COMPASS IN THAT IT HAS A BAR
THAT IS CENTRED IN THE DISPLAY WHEN THE MAULER IS HEADING DIRECTLY FOR THE
OBJECT.AS YOU ROTATE AWAY FROM THE CORRECT HEADING,THE SCANNER ROTATES TO SHOW
THE ARROW POINTING IN THE DIRECTION THE PLAYER HAS TO TURN TO LINE UP ON THE
OBJECT AGAIN. THERE ARE NO SPECIFIC CONTROLS FOR THE HOMING SCANNER AND THE
DISPLAY APPEARS IN THE TOP RIGHT OF THE MAULER CONTROL PANEL.

[PICK-UP BUTTON] :ONCE YOU HAVE COMPLETED YOUR MISSION OBJECTIVE.YOU MUST MAKE
YOUR WAY TO THE PICK-UP POINT SPECIFIED IN YOUR MISSION BRIEFING AND SUMMON
THE `HELICARRIER` TO TAKE YOU BACK SAFELY TO THE NORTHERN LINES.CLICK ON THE
BUTTON ON THE CONTROL PANEL OR USE THE KEYBOARD CONTROLS SPECIFIED.

WEAPONS:

WEAPONARY IS WHAT ITS ALL ABOUT!..THE MAULER HAS 4 WEAPON PODS,ANY NUMBER OF
WHICH YOU CAN FILL UP WITH LETHAL DEVICES BEFORE YOU GO ON A MISSION,SEE YOUR
FIRST MISSION SECTION FOR DETAILS ON EQUIPPING YOUR MAULER.

ONLY ONE WEAPON PODS CAN BE ACTIVE AT ANY ONE TIME,SELECTABLE FROM THE
KEYBOARD OR BY CLICKING ON THE APPROPRIATE WEAPON POD AT THE TOP OF THE MAULER
CONTROL PANEL..WHEN IN PASSIVE MODE.

THIS WILL ACTIVATE THE SELECTED WEAPON POD,AS SHOWN BY THE WEAPONS ICON
APPEARING IN THE WEAPON CONTROL WINDOW OF THE CONTROL PANEL,ALONG WITH ANY
PARTICULAR CONTROLS FOR THE WEAPON(UP/DOWM-LEFT/RIGHT).THE WEAPON POD ITSELF
ALSO SHOWS THE NUMBER OF ROUNDS LEFT IN THE MAGAZINE PLUS ITS CURRENT DAMAGE
STATUS.

A DESCRIPTION OF EACH MUNITION FOLLOWS,BUT REMEMBER THAT YOU WONT HAVE ACCESS
TO ALL WEAPON TYPES ON ALL MISSIONS,YOU`LL ALSO BE LIMITED TO HOW MUCH YOU CAN
PUT ON-BOARD YOUR MAULER BY WEIGHT AND WEAPON DESIGN CONSTRAINTS.

ALL WEAPONS ALSO HAVE A MAGAZINE SIZE,WHICH IS THE NUMBER OF ROUNDS THAT
WEAPON SYSTEM CARRIES.RUN OUT OF ROUNDS AND YOU`LL BE FIRING THIN AIR UNTIL
YOU SELECT ANOTHER WEAPON POD CONTAINING LIVE ROUNDS.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                             OFFENSIVE WEAPONARY:

[TURRET]

THE MOST BASIC ARMAMENT PROVIDED FOR THE TANK IS THE `PULVERISER` 120MM BATTLE
CANNON,WHICH FIRES SHELLS DIRECTLY FORWARD. THE BARREL IS A SIMPLE LAUNCHING
TUBE FOR SHELLS WHICH ARE POWERED,IN EFFECT UNGUIDED MISSILES. THEY ARE
UNAFFECTED BY GRAVITY,BUT THEY TRAVEL QUITE SLOWLY,SO YOU HAVE TO AIM WHERE
THE TARGET IS GOING TO BE WHEN THE SHELL ARRIVES.
THE BARREL OF THE PULVERISER BATTLE CANNON IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE MAULER`S
TURRET AND SO IS NOT REMOVED EVEN IF THE PULVERISER WEAPON SYSTEM IS NOT
FITTED.

THE WEAPON HEAD UP DISPLAY SIMPLY SHOWS THE NUMBER OF CANNON SHELLS
REMAINING,ONLY ONE CANNON CAN BE FITTED TO THE TANK AT ONCE. THE MAGAZINE SIZE
IS 60 SHELLS.

THE MISSILE LAUNCHER LOCKS-ON TO THE CLOSEST TARGET IN A CONE DIRECTLY IN 
FRONT OF THE MAULER. THE CURSOR WILL CHANGE SHAPE AND A FLASHING `LOCKED ON`
MESSAGE WILL APPEAR IN THE H-U-D(HEAD UP DISPLAY).THIS LOCKED ON STATE LASTS
FOR A LIMITED AND THE LAUNCHER CONTINUALLY TRACKS THE TARGET DURING IT.IF YOU
PRESS THE FIRE BUTTON AGAIN WHILE THE LAUNCHER IS LOCKED ON,A MISSILE IS
LAUNCHED AGAINST A TARGET.THE MISSILE WILL FOLLOW THE TARGET UNTIL IT HITS OR
RUNS OUT OF FUEL AND EXPLODES,IF NO TARGET CAN BE FOUND THEN NO MISSILE WILL
BE LAUNCHED.

THERE ARE 2 VERSIONS OF THIS MISSILE,HEATSEEKING AND RADAR GUIDED,HEAT SEEKING
MISSILES WILL ONLY LOCK ONTO TARGETS THAT PRODUCE A LOT OF I.R RADIATION SUCH
AS AIRCRAFT OR VEHICLES,WHILE RADAR GUIDED MISSILES WILL LOCK ONTO ALL TARGETS
HEAT SEEKING MISSILES HAVE A MUCH SIMPLER GUIDANCE AND TARGETING SYSTEM THAN
RADAR GUIDED ONES,AS A CONSEQUENCE THEY ARE SMALLER AND LIGHTER AND CAN FIT
MORE IN A MAGAZINE.THE MAGAZINE SIZE IS 8 FOR HEAT SEEKING MISSILES AND 5 FOR
RADAR GUIDED.

[SPECTRE I.R DECOY FLARES]

THESE ARE FLARES THAT YOU CAN LAUNCH TO DECOY HEAT SEEKING MISSILES.IF A FLARE
COMES WITHIN THE FIELD OF VIEW OF AN ENEMY MISSILE THERE IS A HIGH PROBABILITY
THAT IT WILL CHANGE COURSE TO FOLLOW THE FLARE RATHER THAN THE MAULER. IF USED
WHILE YOU ARE ALSO USING HEAT SEEKING MISSILES THEY MAY INTERFERE WITH THE
OPERATION OF THEM,AS WELL!!

THE FLARE LAUNCHER HAS 2 MODES OF OPERATION,SINGLE-SHOT AND AUTOMATIC. IN THE
SINGLE-SHOT MODE YOU LAUNCH A FLARE ON DEMAND BY HITTING THE FIRE BUUTON.IN
AUTO MODE..MAULER LAUNCHES A FLARE EVERY MINUTE OR IF THE CURRENT FLARE HAS
BEEN DESTROYED,TO GIVE CONTINUAL PROTECTION.
