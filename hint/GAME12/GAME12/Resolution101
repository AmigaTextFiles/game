YOUR TASK

RESOULTION 101..SUB SECTION (A)
IT IS HEREBY PASSED AS LAW THAT, FROM THE 19TH OF JANUARY 2038, ANY OFFENDER
HELD WITHIN A STATE OR FEDERAL OWNED PRISON OF THE U.S. OF NEW AMERICA WISHING
TO RECEIVE AMNESTY FROM THE GOVERMENT FOR ANY PAST CRIMES THAT HE/SHE HAS BEEN
JUDGED GUILTY OF, MAY RECEIVE HIS/HER AMNESTY THROUGH THE SUCCESSFUL
APPLICATION AND COMPLETION OF A STATE SHERRIF`S TERMINATION WARRANT. THESE
WARRANTS SHALL ONLY BE FOR THE TERMINATION OF THE MOST HIGHLY DANGEROUS
CRIMINALS IN THE U.S. OF NEW AMERICA- NFBI CLASSED `A` ONLY.

IT HAD TO HAPPEN. CRIME WAS RIFE AND THE GOVERMENT COULD NO LONGER CONTROL IT.
IN A DESPERATE ATTEMPT TO CONTAIN THE SOARING LEVELS OF CRIME THE US SENATE HAS
PASSED A NEW ARTICLE OF LAW-RESOULTION 101, UNDER THIS RESOLUTION CONVICTED
CRIMINALS ARE BEING OFFERED THE CHANCE TO EARN THEIR FREEDOM BY TRACKING DOWN
AND TERMINATING HIGH PROFILE CRIMINALS AND GANGLAND BOSSES.

YOU ARE ONE OF THE CONVICTED CRIMINALS AND YOU HAVE BEEN GIVEN YOUR
SEARCH/DESTROY LICENSE AND A THETA 4000 GROUND SKIMMER VEHICLE WITH A LIGHT
MACHINE WEAPON SYSTEM. YOU WILL ALSO BE GIVEN INSURANCE WITH THE INTERNATIONAL
VEHICLE INSURANCE CORPORATION(IVI CORP) WITH AN INITIAL INSURANCE RATING OF
FIVE(THIS IS BASICALLY YOUR NUMBER OF LIVES).

YOUR MISSION BRIEFING IS TO TRACK DOWN FOUR DRUG RUNNING CRIMINALS OPERATING IN
LOS ENVEGAS, A SMALL CITY IN THE SOUTH, AND CONFISCATE THEIR DRUG SUPPLIES HAVE
BEEN AMASSED TO CONVICT THEM YOU MAY PROCEED WITH THEIR TERMINATION.

EACH QUARTER OF THE CITY IS CONTROLLED BY A DIFFERENT DRUG RUNNER, THE EASTSIDE
BY TOBY KOMAZUKI, THE SOUTHERN BOULEVARDS BY JOHNNY PSYCLOPS, THE WEST END BY
JAKE JOUKOWSKI.YOU WILL CONFRONT EACH RUNNER INDIVIDUALLY.

EACH RUNNER IS ALSO INSURED BY THE IVI CORP.AND WILL RECIEVE A NEW VEHICLE EACH
TIME YOU DEFEAT HIM. THE RUNNER WILL THEN LIE LOW, RE-EQUIPING HIS VEHICLE,
MAKING IT EVEN MEANER AND TOUGHER AND RECRUITING EVEN MORE CRIMINALS WHILST YOU
CARRY OUT YOUR MISSION TO DEFEAT THE OTHER THREE SECTORS OF THE CITY.

WHEN YOU HAVE DEFEATED A RUNNER FOR THE THIRD TIME, HIS INSURANCE RATING WITH
THE IVI CORP. WILL HAVE EXPIRED AND YOU CAN FINALLY TERMINATE HIM FOR GOOD.
ONCE YOU HAVE TERMINATED ALL FOUR OF THE RUNNERS(IE COMPLETED 12 LEVELS) YOU
WILL HAVE WON THE GAME AND EARN YOUR FREEDOM.

HOWEVERE YOU SHOULD BEWARE THAT YOUR OWN INSURANCE RATING WILL BE REDUCED BY
ONE EVERY TIME THAT YOUR GROUND SKIMMER IS DESTROYED AND HAS TO BE REPLACED BY
THE IVI CORP. YOUR RATING WILL ALSO BE REDUCED BY ONE IF A RUNNER EVER MANAGES
TO COMPLETE HIS DRUG RUN. WHEN EVER YOUR RATING IS REDUCED YOU WILL BE ALLOWED
ANOTHER ATTEMPT TO DEFEAT THE CURRENT ACTIVE RUNNER.

IT IS NOT UNKNOWN FOR SHERRIF`S TO PLACE DISCREET BETS ON THE SUCCESS OF THEIR
MEN BEFORE EMBARKING ON A MISSION INDEED YOU HAVE EVEN HEARD RUMOURS THAT THE
SHERRIF IN CHARGE OF YOUR MISSION, SHERIFF STONE HAS PLACED HIS ENTIRE LIFE
SAVINGS ON YOU- TO WIN!, IT IS ALSO NOT UNKNOWN FOR CRIMINALS  TO MEET WITH
SEVERE AND HARMFULL `ACCIDENTS` AFTER RETURNING FROM MISSIONS EMPTY HANDED AND
WITH THEIR TARGETS STILL AT LARGE. SHOULD THIS BE THE CASE, THEN IT CAN BE
PRESUMED THAT YOU WILL MEET WITH A RATHER LARGE `ACCIDENT` IF YOU FAIL THIS
MISSION AND WILL BE MAKING A STAY AT THE PRISON HOSPITAL.

IF YOU RUN OUT OF CREDIT WITH THE IVI CORP(IE YOUR INSURANCE RATING REACHES
ZERO) YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE ANY MORE VEHICLES AND YOU WILL BE TREATED IN
HOSPITAL FOR ANY INJURIES RECEIVED FROM CRASHES BEFORE BEING RETURNED BEING
RETURNED TO THE STATE PEN!!!..

COLLISION OR BY COMING UNDER FIRE. WHEN YOUR ARMOUR HAS BEEN COMPLETELY
PENETRATED YOUR VEHICLE WILL BE COMPLETELY DESTROYED. ARMOUR `PATCHES` ARE
AVAILABLE FROM ANDROID MABELS `ODDS N ENDS`SHOP.

LOSS OF AN ITEM OF INSTRUMENTAION WHICH CAN BE REPLACED AT A SHOP. IN THESE
CONDITIONS,IF THE PARTICULAR FIRE IS RECEIVED FROM ENEMY MINES THEN THE DAMAGE

WILL SLOW DOWN, ENGINE BOOSTER PACKS ARE AVAILABLE FROM HENRY`S STATUS `ENGINE

FOLLOWING OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE TO YOU FROM THE SHERIFFS OFFICE:

SKIMMER.

RUNNER THAT YOU HAVE TO HUNT DOWN. THIS INCLUDES HIS NAME, THE LEVEL NUMBER

IF YOU HAVE JUST STARTED YOU WILL ONLY HAVE A LIGHT MACHINE GUN) OF EACH WEAPON
SYSTEM AND EACH HAS A CLASS OF 1-2-3 DESIGNATING IT AS LIGHT/MEDIUM/HEAVY.

THE DRUG RUNNER AND HIS GANG BOSSES: WHEN THE DRUG RUNNER BEGING HIS RUN THE
SKY WILL DARKEN.WHENEVER ONE OF HIS HENCHMEN APPEARS,A BOLT OF LIGHTNING WILL
PROCEDE IT FOR A SECOND TO SHOW YOU WERE THE HENCHMAN IS ABOUT TO APPEAR.

THE RUNNER HAS A SET ROUTE THROUGH HIS SECTOR, DROPPING OFF DRUGS FROM BUILDING
TO BUILDING-THIS IS CALLED HIS DRUG RUN. HE APPEARS IN THE GAME AS A
DISTINCTIVE ORANGE/RED SHIP STOPPING AT BUILDINGS TO DO HIS DEALS BEFORE MOVING
ON TO THE NEXT ONE. WHENEVER THE RUNNER STOPS OFF AT A BUILDING, THE WHOLE
BUILDING WILL DISAPPEAR SO THAT YOU CAN SE THAT THE RUNNER IS THERE.

DRUG RUNNERS ARE PROTECTED BY BODYGUARDS, SOME OF THEM WILL HANG AROUND THE
RUNNER AND FOLLOW HIS MOVEMENTS. IF HE COMES UNDER FIRE HE CAN DESPATCH ANY
NUMBER OF GUARDS TO PROTECT HIMSELF.

THE RUNNER CANNOT BE DEFEATED UNTIL YOU COLLECT ENOUGH OF HIS DRUG
CANNISTERS(SE LATER) AS EVIDENCE AGAINST HIM. IF YOU FIRE ON THE RUNNER BEFORE
COLLECTING ENOUGH OF THE CANNISTERS, THEN YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO HARM HIM. BUT
HIS BODY GUARDS WILL ATTACK YOU. THE NUMBER OF CANNISTERS THAT YOU NEED TO
COLLECT IS DISPLAYED ON THE DASHBOARD UNDERNEATH YOUR CASH BALANCE IN THE FORM
OF A CONTRABAND COUNTER.

THERE ARE ALSO A NUMBER OF GANG BOSSES WITHIN THE CITY WHO ARE MAINLY
CONTROLLED BY THE DRUG RUNNER WHO HAS GIVEN EACH OF THEM A SPECIAL TASK. EACH
BOSS HAS A NUMBER OF HENCHMAEN THAT FOLLOW HIM ABOUT TO HELP HIM CARRY OUT THAT
TASK. TASKS INCLUDE PROTECTING THE RUNNER GOING TO PARTICULAR POINTS IN THE
CITY, MAKING THE DRUG PICK UPS, DEFENDING PARTICULAR AREAS AND BUILDINGS OR
EVEN ATTACKING YOU(IF YOU HAVE UPSET THE RUNNER ENOUGH)

IF YOU DESTROY A BOSS YOU WILL AUTOMATICALLY BE ATTACKED BY ANY OF HIS HENCHMEN
THAT ARE STILL ALIVE. THE DRUG RUNNER WILL HAVE ORIGANISED ALL OF THE GANG
BOSSES AND THEIR TASKS IN A CUNNING STRATEGY TO PREVENT YOU FROM DEFEATING HIM.

ON THE LAST LEG OF THE DRUG RUNNERS RUN, A RED `RUN COMPLETE` WARNING LIGHT
WILL FLASH ON THE RIGHT-HAND SIDE OF THE DASHBOARD. WARNING YOU THAT THE RUN IS
ABOUT TO BE COMPLETED. IF THE RUNNER COMPLETES A RUN, YOU WILL SEE HIM LAUGHING
AT YOU AND SHERIFF STONE WILL `SEE TO IT` THAT YOU LOSE YOUR INSURANCE RATING.
YOU WILL THEN BE GIVEN ANOTHER ATTEMPT TO DEFEAT HIS RUN UNLESS,OF COURSE YOUR
INSURANCE RATING HAS EXPIRED, IN WHICH CASE THE AUTHORITIES WILL `PUT`YOU INTO
HOSPITAL FOR FAILING.

THROUGHOUT EACH LEVEL,MORE AND MORE CRIMINALS WILL APPEAR IN THE FORM OF
ROBOTIC SNIPERS,GUARDIANS,ASSASSINS AND DRONES THAT JUST HAPPEN TO GET IN THE
WAY. AND AS THE LEVELS PROGRESS,EACH RUNNER WILL BE PROTECTED BY MORE AND MORE
OF HIS BODYGUARDS AND GANG BOSSES MAKING YOUR TASK MORE DIFFICULT.

EVERY CRIMINAL IN THE CITY HAS A PRICE ON HIS HEAD AND YOU WILL BE CREDITED
WITH A BOUNTY FOR EACH CRIMINAL THAT YOU TERMINATE. YOU WILL RECEIVE A
PARTICULARY HIGH BOUNTY FOR KILLING BOSSES AND EVEN MORE FOR BOSSES MAKING A
PICKUP.(SEE LATER)

CASH AND DRUG CANISTERS:  AS YOU DESTROY CRIMINALS,THEY WILL DROP EITHER CASH
OR DRUG CANISTERS ON THE GROUND. YOU SHOULD DRIVE YOUR VEHICLE OVER THESE TO
COLLECT THEM.

CASH CANISTERS ONLY REMAIN ON THE GROUND FOR A SHORT TIME THEY DISAPPEAR. THEY
CONTAIN THE ILLICIT TAKING OF THE CRIMINALS AND WILL VARY IN VALUE ACCORDING TO
HOW IMPORTANT THE CRIMINAL WAS. REMEMBER THE BOSSES CARRY THE MOST CASH.

UNDER THE RESOULTION 101 SUB SECTION (B)1):  ANY MONIES CONFISCATED OR SEIZED
FOR OR ON BEHALF OF THE GOVERMENT, THAT ARE KNOWN TO HAVE
ILLICITLY,IMMORALLY,OR ILLEGALLY EARNED , MAY BE USED BY THE OFFENDER SEEKING
AMNESTY TO AID OR FURTHER HIM IN THE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF HIS/HER
TERMINATION WARRANT.

PUT INTO PLAIN ENGLISH THIS MEANS THAT YOU WILL BE CREDITED FOR ANY CASH
CANISTERS THAT YOU COLLECT AND THIS MONEY CAN BE USED BY YOU IN THE SHOPS AT
ANY TIME TO UPGRADE OR REPAIR YOUR SKIMMER.

DRUG CANISTERS CONTAIN THE ILLICIT CONTRABAND OF THE DRUG RUNNER AND REMAIN ON
THE GROUND FOR NEARLY A MINUTE. VARIOUS COLOURED CANISTERS CAN BE DROPPED BY
BOTH THE RUNNER HIMSELF OR ANY OF HIS HENCHMEN. EACH OF THESE CANISTERS
COLLECTED WILL CAUSE THE CONTRABAND COUNTER ON YOUR DASHBOARD TO TICK DOWN ONE
AND YOU WILL ALSO BE CREDITED WITH 50 NEW AMERICAN DOLLARS ON YOUR DASHBOARD
CASH BALANCE.

AS THE RUNNER MAKES HIS RUN, HE WILL DELIBERATELY DROP DRUG CANISTERS AT SET
POSITIONS ALONG HIS RUN. THESE CANISTERS COME IN ONE OF FOUR COLOURS AND EACH
HAS ITS OWN DIFFERENT EFFECT..

RED    `DRUG    ` CANISTERS- SAFE TO PICK UP
YELLOW `LIFE    ` CANISTERS- SAFE TO PICK UP-FOR EVERY FOUR OF THESE CANISTERS
THAT YOU COLLECT, YOUR INSURANCE RATING WILL BE INCREMENTED BY ONE.
GREY   `BOOBY   ` CANISTERS- BOOBY TRAPPED-THESE WILL EXPLODE AND DAMAGE YOUR
ARMOUR.
BLACK  `DEATH   ` CANISTERS  TERMINATED TRAPPED-THESE WILL EXPLODE AND DESTROY
YOUR GROUND SKIMMER CAUSING YOUR INSURANCE RATING TO BE REDUCED BY ONE.

SOMETIMES, WHEN A DROP IS MADE BY THE RUNNER, ONE OF THE GANG BOSSES WILL BE
ORDERED TO PICKUP THE DRUG CANISTER AND TAKE IT SOMEWHERE. THE BOSS WILL THEN
MAKE THE PICK-UP. ONCE THE PICK UP IS MADE, THE BOSS WILL FLASH AND TAKE THE
CONTRABAND ELSEWERE. DESTROYING THE BOSS WHILST HE IS FLASHING WILL CREDIT YOU
WITH A VERY HEALTHY SUM OF CASH.ALSO,DESTROYING A BOSS WHO HAS MADE A PICKUP
WILL CAUSE HIM TO DROP A NORMAL RED DRUG CANISTER,EVEN IF THE CANISTER HE
PICKED UP WAS NOT A RED ONE. THIS IS A VERY USEFUL WAY OF OBTAINING A DRUG
CANISTER WHICH WAS BLACK. IN SOME SITUATIONS, BLACK DRUG CANISTERS WILL BE THE
ONLY CANISTERS THAT YOU WILL FIND IN A SECTOR IN WHICH CASE THIS TACTIC WILL
BECOME ESSENTIAL TO BE ABLE TO PROCEED FURTHER IN THE GAME.

HENCHMEN HOLDING DRUG CANISTERS WILL ALWAYS DROP RED COLOURED CANISTERS WHEN
SHOT AND THESE ARE SAFE TO PICK UP.

STRATEGY

THERE ARE MANY WAYS TO APPROACH THIS GAME, THE BASIC STREATEGY BEING TO KILL
ALOT AND COLLECT THE RED CANISTERS, IT IS ALWAYS SAFER TO KILL HENCHMEN AND
BODY GUARDS BEFORE GANG BOSSES AND DRUG RUNNERS AS THESE CAN BE TACKLED IN
ISOLATION.

IT IS WORTH TRYING A LEVEL A FEW TIMES TO FIND OUT WETHER GANG BOSSES USED TO
PICK UP CONTRABAND, AND IF SO TO WAIT UNTIL THEY HAVE MADE THERE PICK UP,
BEFORE KILLING THEM. TO EARN MORE CASH AND CONVERT BLACK CANISTERS TO RED.

IT IS IMPORTANT TO KEEP BUYING WEAPONS-BIGGER GUNS= BIGGER POWER AND YOU NEED
EM AS LEVELS GO ON. YOU DONT NEED ENGINE BOOSTERS UNLESS YOU START TO SLOW
DOWN.
KEEP SHEILD LEVELS TO 1/2  AS TO AVOID TAKING ANY EXTRA DAMAGE. ALSO YOU CAN
FIRE THROUGH THE BUSH..YOUR ENEMIES CAN`T..KEEP MOVING , KEEP BUYING...
GOOD LUCK!!!!
