HOW TO PLAY

The Ship
 The Megablaster is a small but perfectly formed battlecraft. The basic
model is equipped with a thruster to aid movement, a simple blaster for
the purpose of destroying anything that moves, and a shield to absorb
collisions. When the shield runs out, the ship is destroyed with the
next hit it sustains. A squadon of 3 fighters are at your disposal.

Pick`n'choose
 The Selection Screen allows you to turn the in-game music on and off
by moving to joystick in the appropriate direction. You can also start
a one or two player game in the same way.

The Screen
 Your journey through time follows the process of evolution,
represented by five increasingly arduous horizontally scrolling levels.
Each has distinctive scenery and lifeforms-from the lowest form of life
in pre-prehistoric times through to metallic mayhem in the spaceways of
centuries to come. Sadly these creatures won't listen to reason. The
powerful radiation emitted by the Time Bombs planted at the end of the
levels has mutated the once harmless beings into crazed aggressors
which are now best shot or avoided.

Scenery
 The scenery doesn't damage your ship-unless you get trapped in a
corner and crushed as the screen continues to scroll. You can reverse
the direction of the scrolling by pulling back on the joystick when the
ship is at the bottom of the screen, which creates a larger playing
area of proportions more often associated with scrolling shoot'em-ups
of the horizontal variety. However the effect is short-lived, so be
careful not to get trapped in the maze-like landscape of the later
stages.

Big Boys
 A large guardian is found at the end of every level and each is
destroyed in a special way for you to discover. Only then will the Time
Bomb be defused. In the last four levels, large lifeforms appear not
only at the end but halfway through, and once again it's up to you to
find a means to an end.

Capsules
 Bored by the basic blaster? Beef up the ship by collecting the tokens
left by Special Capsules which occasionally float across the screen.

It's The Real Thing
 Creatures whichbite the space dust leave behind Real Cash, the
quantity and value depending on the size of the thing destroyed.
Collect the Cash and use it to buy equipment when you visit the shop.

Swop Shop
 Megablasters are given two opportunities per level to sell or buy
equipment (once halfway through and again at the end). This is...well,
the shopkeeper. Its name is unpronouncable in our language but loosely
translated it means "Crispin". He doesn't speak very good English, so
it's fortunate that his garbled speech is translated in the window
below.

Sell!
 When you first enter the shop you are invitedto sell the equipment
accumulated (it's displayed in the bank of video screens to the left).
Use the joystick to move the highlight to the desired position.
Pressing the fire button while the highlight is beneath an item doesn't
sell it but you are given a price (usually less than half of what you
paid for it). If the shopkeeper's offer sounds reasonable, move the
highlight to SELL at the bottom of the screen and press the fire button
to make the transaction. Your bank balance will be credited
automatically.

Buy!
 With the selling over, move the highlight to EXIT and press the fire
button to view the equipment up for sale. Over two-dozen articles are
in stock but only those you can afford are displayed in the bank of
video screens to the left. The procedure for buying equipment is much
the sameas selling it, only your bank balance is debited accordingly.

Death
 Should you lose a ship-all is not lost...Each level features six
Restart Positions, which means when you are unfortunate enough to lose
a ship, you won't be returned to the very beginning of a level but to
the last Restart Position passed.

High Scores
 A table of the top ten Megablasters is displayed on the attract
sequence. To see your initials in lights, get a score big enough to get
on the table then move the joystick left or right to advance through the
characters available. Press the fire button to enter a charracter into
the table.

EQUIPMENT
 There are three distinct types. These tokens activate weapons.

Advice
Crispin's tips on how to play, including which weapons may be most
suitable for a particular section. this information is more often than
not useful but sometimes misleading.

Side Shot
Causes bullets to emit from the left and right sides of your ship when
the fire button is depressed.

Zapper
Erradicates everything on screen in a blinding flash of light.

Super Nashwan Power
A devilish taster device which provides a full 10 seconds of Total
Destructive Power!

Heart (small)
Restores your ship's shield to half the maximum level.

Heart (large)
Restores your ship's shield to the max.

Speed-up
Who needs go-faster stripes when you have this little baby, eh?

Power-up
Improve the strength of your shot by boosting your bullets to up to
three times their original size!

Electroball
Sticks to your ship like Sharon to Darren until you hold down the fire
button...now you can move the ball (watch out-it's four times as 
sensitive to control as the ship) and use it to bash anything bad.

Autofire
No need to wear out your trigger finger, just hold down the fire button.

Dive
And you thought that parallax scrolling was just a frill. Press the
Space Bar to dive "into" the screen. A timer will appear and count down
from ten to zero, Whereupon the ship will come back "up".
Alternatively, pressing the Space Bar a second time gets you back up
into the swing of things. However, be careful not to come out of the
screen and crash into any scenery.

Megablaster
The boy-blazers' favourite shoots a stream of intense laser fire. A
maximum of three can be bolted on front of the ship.

Rear Shot
Clamps onto your behind and protects your rear from fear.

Mines (small)
Hold down the fire button to leave a trail of floating death which
explodes after a second or two.

KNOW YOUR ENEMY

 The lifeform found on each level come in all different shapes and
sizes, with individual characteristics for you to learn. Here are some
of the beings you can expect to do battle with...

Brachiopod
These shellfish creatures wiggle and giggle down the screen.
Fortunately they don't shoot at you.

Flatworm
The candy-striped creatures twist and shout but don't bother shooting
at anything.

Seeworm
These wriggly beings live in the rocks found in the centre of the first
level. They appear from the tubes attached to the rock and slither
around in a menacing pattern. Beware the pieces of body which shoot off
when shot.

Trilobyte
The crusty-skinned lovelies are understandably wary of your presence,
whichis why they keep their distance before they shoot-and they don't
even ask questions later.

Jellyfish
Pulsate around the screen having a good time. Kill them quick to ensure
they don't interfere with yours.

The Nautilus Shellfish
Watch out for this crustacean's probing appendage -it spits mines in
your general direction. Find a weak spot and pump it full of laser fire
until the calclum-coated creature explodes into a shower of Real Cash.
