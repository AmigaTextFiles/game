To Take Off From Carrier -- Hold Stick Left Or Right, then at end of ship
angle to the upper left or right. (landing gear will go in at a certain
speed by itself)


To Fire Machine Guns -- Hold Down Fire Button
To Fire Rockets,Bombs,Torpedo -- Push Fire Button Rapidly

Or you can use the MOUSE! to fire them..

Other Things to know -- Use Rockets to Destroy Anti-AirCraft Bunkers.
  Some ships will need more than 1 torpedo to sink it (Battleships &
Aircraft Carriers).

Proper Use of Torpedo -- Fly Level about an inch above the water (not a real
inch, just what you see on the screen). Look at the small window at the
bottom of the screen. When you ythink you are close enough, relaese the
torpedo!  BUT if you are too high or not level, it will explode. If you
release it too soon, it will run out of fuel, or if you release it too late,
you'll crash into the ship!!.

Sometimes Torpedo planes will attck YOUR ship, And a little red arrrow in
the screen at the bottom will appear. If this happens, you have two options,
SHOOT IT DOWN, or you can shoot the torpedo AFTER its in the water( I prefer
the first method myself)

Thats about all i have on it, so give my friends boards a call when you are
done playing it!.
