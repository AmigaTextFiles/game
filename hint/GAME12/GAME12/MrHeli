                Muddy and restore the balance of nature.  Use your trusty
                joystick to fly Mr. Heli deep into the heart of the planet

                as you go.  You may also use your weapons to destroy groups
                of bricks and uncover a small fortune in crystals which you
                may use to buy the surrounding power-ups.
