 INTRODUCTION
 ============

Why hello?!!!!!!!  First of all, I would like to say, that I am writing this
solution/solve/hint doc/etc. about 1 week after STAR GLIDER 2s release into
the market.  Yes!  I did indeed SOLVE the game within a time frame of about
4 days.  Just a little help from a friend, thats all.  I hope that you will
be able to get the same out of the game as I did: good,wholesome,clean 
entertainment.  SO, just sit back and enjoy the rest of the file and any
other tidbits thrown in.....

               -Laterzzz

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 MATERIALS NEEDED
 ================
 
   1 Working copy of StarGlider 2 (known hereafter as SG2)
   1 Atari ST or AMIGA (yeech) computer
   1 SG2 Novella & Play guide
  15 hrs of non-stop play of SG2 to solve it



 SG2 Info
 ========

    Be sure to read through the NOVELLA at least TWICE!  This will help
you in about completing 25% of the game.  SO read it if you havent!!
Oh yeah, if you pirated the copy, then you lucked out....>SIGH<


 SOLUTION
 ========

  Ok, here"s the situation....>Sound Familar?<  Anyways, after you have 
read the SG2 novella you are ready to begin.  The first step is to find
the MAIN DEPOT on planet APOGEE.  To do this, enter the tunnels and proceed
straight.  At the next junction, stop, and turn 180 degrees.  You should 
now see the tunnel split.  Now go to your right (you just came from the
left).  Proceed forward.   Keep going!  Next blast open the door.  Stay to 
your left....GO LEFT!  Then about 30 sec later you will be in the 
MAIN DEPOT.  This is where you will recieve your instructions and what 
materials are needed to construct the bomb. (Just like the Novella!)
After your little "chat" proceed back out of the tunnel and onto the 
planet.  Then go refuel.  You do know how to refuel dont ya?!  Well just
find the power lines and fly parallel with them going med speed.  There all
done ready to kill some Egrons?!  Well not yet.  Here"s a quick rundown of
completing the next 25-40% of the game from the begining.....Details, will
follow later on.







---------------------------------------------------------------------------


Go in order:
------------------

    APOGEE:  MAIN DEPOT ~ See above ^^^^^^^^ ok?
             
       EON:  Petrified tree (Looks like X-mas tree)
                 -Tractor beam it aboard
             Nothign else needed here
    
   CASTRON:  DEPOT ~ Enter tunnel entrance
                     Straight, then cutback (180 at first junction)
                     Straight, keep left
                     Get bouncing Bombs at depot
                     Trade Tree for CastroBars
                  
    DANTE:   Nodules ~ Find them on surface.  Tractor beam it up.

   APOGEE:   Return to MAIN DEPOT -  Give depot CastroBars & Nodules
                -Leave planet
  
 * In Space: Find pirate ships (RED) and shoot them
              -Their cargos will be out in space once ship is
                destroyed.
              -Find cast of Vistan Wine and tractor beam aboard.
             
              -FInd BLUE asteroids and beam aboard.

   APOGEE:  Return to MAIN DEPOT- Give Depot Asteroid & Wine

   BROADWAY: Find an EMMA-2 hover-car.  Tractor beam-it aboard.
              you now have Professor Taymar.
   
   APOGGE:  Refuel & and drop off Professor

   ALDOS:  Find & pick-up ~ EGRON Mini-Rocket
                            Nuclear Fuel (Small,hard to find)
             
   APOGEE:  Drop off Materials

   IN SPACE:  Just off of APOGEE Search for EGRON WHALE
                                       -This thing is big
                                        should not be hard
                                        to find.
                               ~ YES!  Beam it aboard.
 
   QUESTA:  Proceed to DEPOT (position 5502)
                Trade, you now have flat diamond.

   IN SPACE:  Find Pirate ships and destroy them.  You need
               Lump of mineral crystal

   APOGEE:  Return items to depot.  Bomb now should be almost complete.

   WESTMERE:  Using BOUNCING BOMBS to destroy EGRON PROJECTOR
                           -This is BIG!  Blue & Red

     -Continue with other moons until you run out of BOUNCING BOMBS.
     -Check status of bomb
     -when bomb is complete.......

   APOGEE:  Get the bomb from MAIN DEPOT
              -REFUEL if needed

   Proceed to ALDOS & Q-BETA
       Next to ALDOS you will see a YELLOW planet.
       Go towards it. and stop right before it.
       Use regular power - NOT STARDRIVE
       You see the yellow disappear & then see
          EGRON SENTRIES & the SPACE BASE!!!
               (YAYY!!!!  You made it!)

  AIM: Towards the center of the space base....The HUB!  Its red.
        If not, the bomb will not launce as the base is protected by
        the sentries.  Once the bomb, is launced, hit the STARDrive!

   BIG BOOM!  Ka-pow!  All done...you have won...You are victorious!

                         THE END...For now.......

          Perhaps a Sequel? Starglider III????? Nahh.....

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

 DETAILS
 =======

Down to the details.  Basically, the above should get you through MOST of 
the game, the parts in between, you figure them out. (Cant do everything
for ya!)  What follows next?  Well some hints as to where stuff is, general
hints, & what is what and where what is.....Get that?!   Allright....

* = Needs to be traded for items marked by a "$"



----------------------------------------------------------------------

 HINTS & TID BITS
 ================ 

   - All DEPOTS containing items on moons of MILLWAY are at
      position 5502.  ALL ARE IDENTICAL!!!
 
   - You cannot land on MILLWAY.  You will die before you get even
      half way there....So don"t waste your time.  

   - When is tunnel systems, an energy beam or closed door usually
      means there is a depot beyond it, so go for it!

   - Do not fire aimlessly!  You do have limited shots.  Pick carefully.

   - WEAPONS     * Bouning bombs are used primarily against the
                    EGRON projectors on the moons of Millway.
                    Use them wisely.  One is sufficient to knock
                    it out.....Get more bombs on CASTRON.

                 * Homing missiles, use only on moving targets....
                    Great for pirate ships.  Get more missiles
                    at depots on moons of Millway.

                 * Neutron Bomb...Aim at hub of Space Station.

   - Always refuel whenever you have the chance, you never know!
   
   - REFUELING   * Power Lines, the only planets that have these are
                    Apogee & Vista.  Just fly parallel with them at
                    half speed.  You FUEL will be energized first.
                    Then Shields & Lasers....It will take three passes
                    to energize ALL off them...
             
                 * Asteroids, just find them, stop, tractor beam them
                    and just wait.  About two should do the trick.  
                    Fast & easy!  

                 * Volcanoes, kinda hard....Hover high above the opening
                    or you wil get hit by the rocks....Takes awhile!

                 * SUN, Too hard!  You always end up wasting more power
                    then you get....Also dangerous!

    - Save your game OFTEN!  Really, if you wanna solve the game, save
       everytime you accomplish the next goal....Saved me a many times!

    - Check the status of EGRON space station with STATUS REPORT.
       Key "R" - This will also let you know how YOUR BOMB is coming
       along.

    - To build the bomb faster, get at least the first 4 items or so
       and then get the PROFESSOR.  In this way, he will start work on 
       the bomb while you colect the rest of the items.  If you wait to
       get him LAST, then you waste more time!  Just a suggestion....

    - Try to keep at least ONE EGRON Projector base out of commission
       as this halts all work on the space base, which in turn gives 
       YOU MORE time!

    - Tunnel network is in a GIANT CIRCLE....So if you get lost, you
       will end up at sometime back where you were....

------------------------------------------------------------------------

 CONCLUSION
 ==========

 Well, I hope this helps you in solving this great game!  ALOT harder
then the old Star Glider!  SHEW!  Also alot better....Hope they have
another sequel.....>SIGH<  Its been fun writing this solution and I hope
YOU had as much fun as I did.  SO give us a call sometime at the BBS and
maybe we will chat (I doubt it).  Latero dudezz!
  ** And don"t pirate this cool rad game, ok?**
