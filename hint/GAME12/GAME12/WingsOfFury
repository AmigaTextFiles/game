    It's 1943...        World War II..        Americans vs The Japs...

    This game is pretty easy to figure out, but there are a couple of 
  things you may have some problems with..   So I'll help you..

                   >> It's the least I could do! <<

    

TAKING OFF
----------
 
   Pretty simple, you'll just need to practice it a little.. Press 
 joystick left to accelerate your plane and JUST BEFORE your plane
 get's to the left edge of the AIR-CRAFT CARRIER, presss the joystick 
 UP DIAGONAL-LEFT..   You will then take off into the wild blue yonder!


DROPPING BOMBS
--------------
 
  If you press your fire button & hold it, you'll shoot your machine guns.

  If you TAP your fire button, you'll drop bombs!!


LANDING YOUR PLANE
------------------
 
  Whenever your plane get's damaged or you run out of ammo, it's a good 
idea to fly back to your AIR-CRAFT CARRIER to refuel & restock, & get
repairs...
 
 You must approach the AIR-CRAFT CARRIER from the "RIGHT" side (the side
with the little man waving you in).. 
 
#1 Approach from the "RIGHT" side.
 
#2 Decend in altitude untill your close to being level with the approaching 
   AIR-CRAFT CARRIER..
 
#3 Wait for your landing gear to come down.. <You'll see the plane's WHEELS>

#4 Press the joystick "UP" and you'll slowly decend & land smoothly upon
   your AIR-CRAFT CARRIER.
 
Once you've landed, move your plane onto the elevator platform (the place 
you started the game at), and press your FIRE button to decend into the
the AIR-CRAFT CARRIER to restock on AMMO & recieve repairs..

                A SUMMARY OF SOME JOYSTICK COMMANDS
                ===================================

Up (When Landing) - Slowly Decend for landing (when landing gear is down)

Up Left - Climb Left

Up Right - Climb Right

IF YOUR FLYING LEFT:
--------------------

  LEFT - Accelerates Left

  RIGHT - Turns your Plane around & starts you flying left.



IF YOUR FLYING RIGHT:
---------------------
 
 RIGHT - Accelerates RIGHT

 LEFT - Turns your Plane around & starts you flying right.


============================
 NOTE ABOUT TURNING AROUND =
============================

When your plane is turning around (to fly into the opposite direction),
you wil find that the plane has a tendacy to drop in altitude.. This
can e very unhealthy for you & your plane, & Uncle Sam probally wont 
appreciate it if you screw up his nice plane.
 
Remember to climb a little before turning around until you get real use
to the handling the plane..
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
  That should be enough to get you al up into the air & flying around!!
 
ONE LAST NOTE:  I have had probs using the trainer for this game.. This game
-------------   really does not need a trainer, & if you use one, you'll 
                probally get bored of this real cool game quick!
 

             THIS GAME IS AWSOME, USE WITHOUT A TRAINER!!
