           LEISURE SUIT LARRY IN THE LAND OF THE LOUNGE LIZARDS

Typed in by The PUMPKIN. Edited by PARASITE.


In my opinion the questions at the beginning are all in all
too hard to respond, even if you're eighteen or older,
because they are often too specific. So I decided to get the
answers, so that you havn't any problems. It was hard work,but
finally I managed to get 158 out of 160 (I guess that were
about 160), so in the end you have a real chance to  pass this
dummy test at any time...but remember: I didn't  see all of them
because of the hateful random-function, so there are surely a
few missing !
The big letters  I printed show you the  correct answers while
the little ones are those which were wrong. Sometimes there
were several solutions possible, so don't be worried if you see
more letters in a row.

HINTS
- The drunken man likes another drink ...
- The basin isn't empty at all ...
- The writing on the walls is quite interesting ...
- The trash bin is filled up with some stuff ...
- The taxi could lead you to a store ...
- In the store you can get a lot of things ...
- It's nice to share with other people ...
- Telephoning is not expensive ...

There are some things  left to do  before you enter the taxi,
but I did not manage to find out which ones. Of course this
list is not complete; it just represents my actual experience.
