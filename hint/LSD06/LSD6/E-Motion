SCENARIO
E-MOTION TAKES PLACE IN THE SUB-ATOMIC WORLD WHERE PARTICLES CAN
BE BROUGHT INTO EXISTENCE,ACCELERATED,COLLIDED AND
DESTROYED.STRANGE ELASTIC BONDS CAN FORM BETWEEN PARTICLES AND
COMPLEX LATTICES WILL BLOCK YOUR PATH.BUT BEWARE: NOTHING IS
STABLE IN THIS STRANGE WORLD,AND ONLY THE MOST EXPERIENCED AND
EXPERT NUCLEAR PILOTS CAN PREVENT PARTICLE MELT-DOWN.......

GAMEPLAY
E-MOTION GIVES YOU CONTROL OF A SHIP WHICH CAN BE ROTATED LEFT
AND RIGHT,AND MOVED IN THE DIRECTION IT IS CURRENTLY FACING.THE
SHIP IS USED TO PUSH COLOURED SPHERES AROUND THE SCREEN AND EACH
SPHERE MAY BE ONE OF THREE DIFFERENT COLOURS(CONTAIN ONE OF THREE
DIFFERENT SHAPES).AT THE START OF A LEVEL,THREE SPHERES PULSATE
SLOWLY,BUT AS THE LEVELS PROGRESS THEY PULSATE FASTER AND FASTER
UNTIL FINALLY THEY EXPLODE.EVERY TIME A SPHERE EXPLODES,ENERGY IS
LOST (INDICATED BY A BAR AT THE TOP OF THE SCREEN).WHEN THE
ENERGY BAR REDUCES TO ZERO,A LIFE IS LOST,WHEN ALL LIVES ARE LOST
THE GAME IS OVER.THE STRATEGY IS TO AVOID THE EXPLODING SPHERES
BY PUSHING TWO SPHERES OF THE SAME COLOUR (SAME
SHAPE)TOGETHER,WHEREBY THEY'LL BOTH DISAPPEAR HARMLESSLY.IF YOU
SHOULD ACCIDENTALLY PUSH TWO DIFFERENTLY COLOURED (DIFFERENT
SHAPED) SPHERES TOGETHER,A SMALL POD IS FORMED.INITIALLY THIS CAN
BE PICKED UP FOR AN ENERGY RECHARGE,BUT IF LEFT ALONE FOR TOO
LONG IT GROWS INTO A NEW FULL-SIZED SPHERE,WHICH MUST ITSELF THEN
BE DISPOSED OF.THE LEVEL FINISHES WHEN THERE ARE NO SPHERES LEFT
ON THE SCREEN.IF THERE IS ONLY ONE SPHERE LEFT ON SCREEN THEN
OBVIOUSLY IT CANNOT BE DISPOSED OF BY PUSHING IT INTO ANOTHER
ONE,SO IT EXPLODES IMMEDIATELY,TO FINISH THE LEVEL.

TO COMPLICATE YOUR PROGRESS,THERE ARE PIPES SCATTERED AROUND THE
THE SCREEN WHICH BOTH YOUR SHIP AND SPHERES WILL BOUNCE OFF.ON
SOME LEVELS SPHERES ARE JOINED BY ELASTIC BONDS WHICH MEANS THAT
TO PUSH ONE AROUND WILL RESULT IN IT DRAGGING OTHER SPHERES(OR
EVEN YOUR SHIP) WITH IT. MOST LEVELS HAVE ALL THE SPHERES THAT
YOU NEED TO FINISH,BUT A FEW HIGHER LEVELS LEAVE SOME OF THEM OUT
WHICH FORCES YOU TO MAKE NEW SPHERES BY PUSHING DIFFERENT
COLOURED ONES TOGETHER.

EVERY FOURTH LEVEL IS A BONUS LEVEL WHERE YOU HAVE THE CHANCE TO
SCORE BONUS POINTS BUT YOU CANNOT LOSE A LIFE. THERE ARE THREE
DIFFERENT TYPES OF BONUS LEVEL AND EACH ONE CONTAINS INSTRUCTIONS
AS TO WHAT MUST BE DONE TO SCORE POINTS.

THERE ARE 50 LEVELS IN ALL AND UPON COMPLETION OF ALL LEVELS
COMES THE CONGRATULATIONS SEQUENCE.

€THERE ARE 5 SECRET GAMES BONUSES TO BE DISCOVERED THROUGHOUT THE
GAME. WHEN EACH ONE IS FOUND,A MESSAGE FLASHES UP AT THE END OF
THE LEVEL IT WAS FOUND ON.

GETTING STARTED
E-MOTION REQUIRES A COLOUR MONITOR AND IS BEST PLAYED WITH A
JOYSTICK (THOUGH THE KEYBOARD CAN BE USED).WHEN THE GAME HAS
LOADED,THE TITLE SCREEN IS DISPLAYED,FOLLOWED BY THE HIGH SCORE
PAGE AND THEN A DEMO MODE.WATCHING THE DEMO MODE WILL GIVE YOU AN
IDEA OF WHAT TO EXPECT WHEN YOU START A GAME.
PRESS THE FIRE BUTTON TO TAKE YOU TO THE OPENING MENU,WHERE YOU
CAN PRESET ALL OF YOUR OPTIONS.

MODE: NORMAL,PRACTICE OR DEMO
NORMAL MODE: PLAY THE GAME.
PRACTICE MODE: TRY THE FIRST FIVE LEVELS WITHOUT THE BALLS EVER
EXPLODING.
DEMO MODE: RUNS THE SAME DEMO SEQUENCE AS SEEN IN THE ATTRACT
MODE.

PLAYERS: ONE OR TWO
E-MOTION CAN BE PLAYED BY TWO PLAYERS SIMULTANEOUSLY,EACH
CONTROLLING THEIR OWN SHIP.BOTH PLAYERS MUST CO-OPERATE TO FINISH
A LEVEL.THE PLAYERS SHARE ONE JOINT SCORE.

JOYSTICK/KEYBOARD CONTROLS
THESE CAN BE SET ACCORDING TO PREFERENCE.NOTE: WHEN PLAYING ON THE
ST ,WHEN PLAYING A TWO PLAYER GAME,WITH BOTH PLAYERS USING
KEYBOARD CONTROL,PLAY WILL BE RESTRICTED BECAUSE ONLY TWO KEYS
CAN BE DETECTED AT ONCE.

CONTROL MODE: NORMAL AND ALTERNATIVE
THE MODE THAT MOST PEOPLE WILL RECOGNISE AT ONCE IS THE LEFT-
RIGHT-THRUST MODE USED AS A DEFAULT.AS AN
ALTERNATIVE,THOUGH,THERE IS ANOTHER MODE WHERE LEFT AND RIGHT
WORK AS NORMAL ,BUT UP ACCELERATES AND DOWN BRAKES.

ROTATION SPEED: FAST OR SLOW
IF YOU FIND IT DIFFICULT TO CONTROL YOUR SHIP ,TRY ADJUSTING
YOUR ROTATION SPEED TO SLOW INSTEAD.THE SHIP WILL THEN ROTATE AT
HALF SPEED

AFTER SELECTING YOUR OPTIONS,PRESS FIRE TO START THE GAME.YOUR
PREFERENCES ARE REMEMBERED FOR THE REST OF THE SESSION,SO YOU CAN
