               COMPLETE DOCS FOR THE HANNA-BARBERA 
                ANIMATION WORKSHOP

MAIN MENU

When You Start Up The Hanna-Barbera Animation Workshop, You Are Presented
With The Main Menu Screen, This Screen Links All The Different Aspects Of
Animation Workshop Together. There Are 3 Main Areas To The Main Menu
Screen: Main Control Area Contains The 6 Main Control Icons For The
Program. Animation Control Panel Is Used To Control The Display Of
Animations. Exposure List Shows The Order In Which The Frames Making Up The
Animation Fall. 

Getting Started Quick

You Got Here! This Is The Best Way To Quickly Learn The Power Of The
Hanna-Barbera Animation Workshop. Here We Go... This Section Is a Series Of
Icons For You To Click Followed By a Description Of Where You Are And What
You See On The Screen. Just Click On Each Icon In Turn Using The Left Mouse
Button (Unless The Right Mouse Button Is Specified). 

Animation Basics

Animation Is a Simple Process. Usually It Either Copies Or Exaggerates How
Something Actually Moves In Real Life. Once You Know The Basic Steps, You Can
Create The Magic That Makes Still Drawings Come To Life. Remember That There
Will Always Be More To Learn, But Here's a Good Place To Start. 

Drawing

First, An Animator Must Be Able To Take Any Character Or Object And Make
Drawings Of It Doing Anything. Use Your Spare Time To Practice Drawing Any
Character You Like Doing Many Different Things. This Will Be The Best
Training For Your First Animation Projects. 

Changing Shapes

When We Giggle At a Funny Cartoon, It's Probably Because Some Movement Is So
Silly And Exaggerated, We Can't Help But Laugh. Here Are a Few Tricks That
Are Always Used To Make This Happen. 

Example 1: When Fred's Thumb Gets Stuck In His Bowling Ball As He Throws
It, His Arm Streches Way Out. All Objects Change Shape When They Are Making A
Strong Action. Rigid Objects Will Change Very Little, But Flexible Ones Will
Change a Lot. Exaggerating These Changes Can Be Very Useful In Creating A
Funny Scene. 

Example 2: When Dino Falls From High Above And Hits The Ground, His Body
Flattens, Then Stretches Out And Bounces Up Like a Rubber Ball. 

These Examples Are Called Strech And Squash. Nothing In Real Life Gets
Stretched Or Squashed As Much As Cartoon Characters, But This Exaggerated
Drawing Technique Is Constantly Used In Animation To Create Fantasy And
Humor. Next Time You Watch, The Flinstones, Notice How Many Times You See
Fred Or Barney Get Streched And Squashed. 

Timing

Timing In Animation Is The Speed That An Action Takes Place. There Are 3
Very Easy Rules. 

1. If You Want The Action To Move Slowly, Then Use More Frames And Make The
Drawings Overlap. 

2. If You Want The Action To Move At a Medium Speed, Then Use Less Frames And
Have The Drawings Slightly Overlap. 

3. If You Want The Action To Move Fast, Then Use Very Few Frames And Do Not
Let The Drawings Overlap. 

The Best Way To Understand How This Works Is To Look At The Sample
Animation Printed In The Bottom Left Hand Corner. Using The 3 Rules
Above, Practice Making Your Own Flip Books Using The Corners Of An Old
Book, Magazine Or Even a Telephone Book. 

Storytelling

Strech And Squash And Timing Are Important Techniques To Know, But There Is
One More Element That Makes The Real Difference, And That Is
Storytelling. This Is How You Get To Add Your Own Style And Sence Of Humor. A
Good Storyteller Knows How To Create Situations That Bring Reactions Like
Laughing, Crying, And Surprise. Once You Get An Idea Of What You Want To
Animate, Think About How You Can Add Something That's Totally
Unexpected. Remember That Animation Is The Perfect Medium To Let Your
Imagination Run Wild. 

Animation

Now You Know The Tricks Of Drawing. Let's Learn How To Animate. The
Dictionary Says That The Word Animate Means To Give Life Or Motion To. We'll
Go Step By Step And Find Out How To Give Life To Your Drawings. 

Step 1-Whats Happening?

The First Step Is To Know What You Want To Happen. Let's Say You Want a Cat
To Chase a Dog Up a Tree. Sounds Funny, So How Do You Make It Happen?

Step 2-Block Out The Action

Determine What Takes Place First, And Then Last, And Something Inbetween. The
Sketches Of These Poses Are Called Key Drawings. You Might Think Of Them
Like The Panels In a Comic Book. They Are Single Moments Of Activity. In Your
Chase Scene, The First Sketch(Frame 1)Might Have The Cat Running After The
Dog. The Last Drawing(Frame 10)Could Have The Cat Looking Up At The Dog
Trying To Hold On To a Tree Limb. (Frame 6)Might Be The Dog Scrambling Up
The Tree. 

Step 3-Breaking Down The Drawings

An Animator Creates Breakdown Drawings To Show The Secondary Movements That
Would Happen Between Each Key Drawing. In Your Case (Frame 4)The Dog Jumps
Onto The Tree Trunk. (Frame 8)Would Have The Dog Jumping To Catch The Tree
Limb. 

Step 4-Inbetweening. 

An Animator Creates All The Drawings That Fit Between The Finished Drawings
To Smoothen Out The Action. 

Step 5-Exposure Sheet

In 35Mm Film, There Are Usually 24 Drawings (Or Frames)That Pass By Every
Second. Next Time You Watch a Cartoon, Try To Guess How Many Frames Go Buy In
A Half Hour. It's a Lot, So An Animator Uses An Exposure Sheet To Keep Track
Of The Drawings, Frame By Frame. To Save Time And Money, Some Frames Are
Exposed Twice(Called Shot In Twos). Then Only 12 Drawings Are Needed Per
Second. Some Frames Are Only Used Once, But Others Can Be Cycled Over And
Over, Like The Movement Of Running. It May Take 4 Frames For The Dog's Legs
To Move Back And Forth Once, So Those Frames Can Be Repeated Over And Over
To Make It Look Like The Dog Is Running. 

Step 6-Shoot The Frames

Once All The Frames Are Drawn, They Are Put In Order According To The
Exposure Sheet And Individually Photographed Onto Film. Sound Effects, Voices
And Music Are Added. And That's It! You Now Have a Cartoon.

Disk Icon To Load a Background. 

Video Digitizing Hints

If You Are Lucky Enough To Have a Digitizer And a Video Camera Then Here
Are Lots Of Extra Things That You Can Do With The Hanna-Barbera Animation
Workshop. Some Examples Are Included In The Booklet. 

Note: You Do Not Need a Digitizer Or a Camera For Section 2

Section 1 - Entering Hand Drawn Animations

Pages 1-14 Contain a 14 Frame Animation Of Scooby For You To Enter. Set Up
The Video Camera Pointing At a Flat Surface As Described On Page 74. Enter
The Digitize Screen By Clicking On The Video Icon. Place The First Frame
(Page 1)Down And Modify The Brightness Control Until You Can Clearly See
Scooby On The Screen. Try To Make Sure That It Is Dark Enough So That None
Of These Lines Are Broken. When You Are Happy With The Picture, Click On The
Video Icon To Capture a Frame And Move On To The Next One. Turn The Page And
Position It In The Same Place And Repeat The Process Until You Have All 14
Frames Captured. Quickly Play The Adding Background. Now You See How This
Works, Try Drawing Your Own Animation And Entering It Onto The Computer In
The Same Way. You May Find That It Is Quicker To Draw With a Pencil On Paper
Than Trying To Draw Everything With The Computer. 

Section 2 - Copying a Picture From a Grid

This Is a Way Of Accurately Copying a Picture. On Page 15 Is a Picture Of
Dino. Load The Background Called Grid Into The Background Screen. Now You
Have The Same Grid On Screen And You Can Copy The Picture Box By Box From
The Page Onto The Screen. Draw Dino On The Foreground Screen So That When
You Have Finished You Can Wipe The Background Away And Put Your Own
Background In!

Section 3 - Stop-Frame Animation Using Cut-Outs

This Is a Very Powerful Form Of Animation And Can Quickly Produce
Outstanding Results. An Example Of a Fred Flintstone Cut-Out Is On Page 16
With Some Extra Parts On Page 17. In Order To Use Him, Cut Out The Different
Parts Of Fred And Join Them Together With Split Paper-Clips. It May Be
Easier If You Stick The Different Parts Onto Card And Then Cut Them Out
Very Carefully. Once He Is Joined And Can Be Moved, Place Him On The
Digitizing Area And Set Up The Camera As In Section 1. You Can Now Capture A
Frame, Move Fred a Little Bit And The Capture Another One And So On. With
This Technique You Can Quickly Build Up a Very Complicated Animation That
Would Take a Very Long Time To Draw.
