  Graphic and sound - the two key features in most computer games - are
deliberately played down in SPELL! For the real stars of this package are
the words themselves - the 5,000 we have included, and those you key in
yourself. The words are split into the categories that cause most problems
to young spellers. And each word has been expertly graded for age, so the
tests only use words considered appropriate for the age of the user, All
the words can be used in any of five different programs. the variety
ensures that boredom doesn't set in as a group of words is being practised.

    The programs are:

   IN A FLASH:  Watch the words flash on the screen then type it in.
                For beginners there's an option that allows you to
                leave the word displayed as it is entered.
   ROCKET       A variation of the popular hangman game. Spell the
                word correctly and the rocket will take off.
   LUNAR BUGGY: A word is being pulled across the screen by a buggy.
                Type it in before it falls over the edge of the cliff.
   ALL MIXED UP:Rearrange the letters into the correct order.
  CONVEYOR BELT:Watch and remember as the words pass by. Then see how
                many you can remember - and spell correctly. A test of
                memory as well as spelling.

                     GETTING STARTED WITH SPELL!

  Using SPELL! couldn't be easier. Just follow the instructions on disc or
tape label and you'll be presented with a list of five programs. Choose the
one you want.
  You'll be asked which word list you want. Choose from the ones shown or
select your own. If you select the last one you'll be asked for the name of
the list. (SEE BELOW)
  Then you'll be asked for the child's name and age. When you've done all
this, press the spacebar - and let the fun begin!
  If instead of pressing the spacebar, you hold down the CONTROL key while
pressing certain other keys you will have access to some hidden features.
The features and the keys to use are listed later.

                       THE WORDS USED IN SPELL!

  The 5,00 words that come with SPELL~ are in several word lists. The areas
they cover and the ages each is most suited to are:

                Area covered            Age range
                Vowel sounds            Any age
                Consonant blending      Over 6
                Prefixes and suffixes   Over 7
                Word families           Over 9
                Irregular spelling      Over 11

  Some categories are covered by more than one set of words. Simply select
it from the list that is displayed when you first enter the program.
  The final option on the list lets you use your own words. The flexibility
of the programs means that almost any text life can be used as a word list.
Any of these are suitable:


    *A list of words that a child has been given to learn. Just type
     them into a word processor. It doesn't matter if you put them all
     on one line or in a list down the page. Save them and they're
     ready to use in SPELL!
    *Any text such as a child's favourite story. Again just type it
     into a word processor, save it and use the file in SPELL!
    *You can use almost any text file that is supplied with any program.

  Note that it is not necessary to mark each word with a suitable age - a
simple list of words is all that is required. However, if you want to put
recommended ages in your list just follow each word with a space and the
appropriate number. If no ages are in a list the program will select words
at random.

                    THE HIDDEN FEATURES OF SPELL!

  There are seven special features hidden within the five programs the make
up SPELL! They are designed to allow parents and teachers to control such
things as difficulty level and the speed at which the words are displayed.
  They can be used whenever the words Press the spacebar are displayed on
the screen. Simply hold down the CONTROL key and press H (for Help) key.
The features and the keys you should press in order to use them are:

  Option        Press keys      What it does

  Case          Control+C       Lets you choose how the words are displayed
                                and how they must be typed in. There are
                                three choices
                                C=CAPITALS L=lower case B=Both
                                If you choose B the word is displayed as it
                                is in the word list. This makes it ideal
                                for checking things like peoples names. As
                                there are some of these in the words
                                supplied - which are based on popular
                                reading schemes used in schools - all the
                                programs start in this mode.

  Difficulty    Control+D       Gives you the chance to adjust the
                                challenge the program offers. These
                                are the levels you can select from:
                               *IN A FLASH has four levels. On the first
                                the word stays on the screen while it is
                                copied. On the others it disappears after a
                                short time - it is displayed longest on
                                level 2.
                               *ROCKET has four levels and they
                                determine how many times you are
                                allowed to type incorrect letters.
                               *LUNAR BUGGY has two levels. In the first
                                the buggy stops before falling over the
                                edge of the cliff, so it doesn't matter how
                                fast the word is typed. The higher level is
                                a test of speed as well as spelling.
                               *ALL MIXED UP has four levels and they
                                determine how much help you can get. On
                                levels 1 to 3 press the spacebar to re-mix
                                the letters. On level 1 and 2 press the
                                Copy key for part of the answer.
                               *CONVEYOR BELT has 10 levels and they
                                determine how many words you have to
                                remember.

                                ALL THE PROGRAMS START ON  LEVEL 2

                                difficulty of the words, even if it means
                                entering an age that is not the age of the

                       NOTE FOR PARENTS AND TEACHERS

  The 5,000 words that come with SPELL are split into categories covering a
range of common spelling problems. They are also graded to show their
suitability for different age groups.
  It is possible for a category to be picked which does not contain certain
words considered appropriate for the user's age. In such a case this
message will appear. YOU MAY FIND THE LIST YOU HAVE CHOSEN INCLUDES WORDS
TOO EASY/HARD FOR YOUR AGE. You can either press the spacebar to continue
or press ESC to select another list.
  The teaching of spelling goes hand in hand with the teaching of reading.
For children to be able to spell correctly they need to have a basic
grounding in the understanding of the word sounds. It would be impossible
to learn the average adult vocabulary of 10,000 words by repetition alone.
The word list with SPELL! have been designed with the following in mind.
  Children need to be aware of the sounds made by each constant and vowel.
Also they need to know how a sound changes when two or more consonants are
blended together - like "br" or "ch" or when an "e" is added to the end of
a three letter word, such as turning "car" into "care". This is the rule
known as MAGIC E. Add to this the different combinations of double vowels
that are possible - not just "oo" but "oa" - and it is easy to see why so
many children and adults have problems with the English language and
spelling.
  English also has silent letters as the "k" in "know", and many ways of
spelling the same sound - "ough" is especially difficult to learn. The Word
"families" category will help cope with different verb and noun endings.
There are also other rules that involve similar sounding words. These are
all incorporated into the design of SPELL! Due to the vast number of
irregularities there are many spellings which must be learnt by heart.
However, the majority can be accurately guessed by learning the simple
rules built upon in this program. To make the most of the skills taught in
SPELL! you need to use the traditional method of asking children to spell a
word out aloud. This program doesn't attempt to do this: it is where the
caring parent or teacher comes in.
