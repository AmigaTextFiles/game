CAR - A FORMULA 1 RACING GAME [DOC]



To start this game simply put the disk in the internal drive (df0:) and
reboot. This will enable 512k machines to run the program without you
having to disconnect any second drive etc.

This is a two-dimensional fully scrolling racing game. It uses the whole
screen (PAL or NTSC with "OVERSCAN"!) boasted with four channels realistic
STEREO sound. Sounds great, doesn't it? Well anyway, I hope you like this
game, since it took me more than two months to complete.

It is totally controlled by a Joystick, so you don't need to mess around
with the mouse here. On the other hand, if you don't have a Joystick; TOUGH
LUCK.

If you haven't realized it yet, the idea is to guide your car around the
selected track. Steer left and right with the stick as you would expect.
To accelerate/deaccelerate press the FIRE button and move the stick
forwards/backwards whilst holding the button down.

You can chose from 10 different tracks scattered all over Sweden (no polar
bears included). Each track has its individual high score list which is
automatically updated when you start/quit the game. Keep your disk
writeable, or your scores will be lost.

When you start the game it will try to load several files, containing sound
and data. Be patient. If you are using an Amiga with more than 512k the
program will show an intro-picture (VOLVO.pic) while loading. On an
unexpanded machine you will simply receive an error message, but don't
worry, it will not affect the performance of the game.

Note, if you have an American (NTSC, 200 lines) screen you should start CAR
with the parameter NTSC. (Write: CAR NTSC and press Enter/Return.) If you,
on the other hand have an European (PAL, 256 lines) screen, simply write:
CAR and press Enter/Return.

The program returns all memory and facilities, and doesn't interfere with
other tasks. EVERYTHING IS DONE BY THE RULES!

Enough, ENJOY THE GAME!
