Quest. You Can Choose Any Four Characters You Wish. To Select A Character
Click On One Of The Door Spaces. Use The Mouse To Click On The Arrows Left
And Right Under The Doorway To Toggle Through The Eight Characters
Available. The Order In Which The Characters Appear In The Doorways Will
Determine The Order Of Movement In The Game. For Example If The Barbarian
Appears In The Second Doorway From The Left, He Will Be The Second Character
To Move During The Game: If The Paladin Is In The First Doorway He Will Move
First In The Game. It Is Therefore Possible To Have Any Combination Of
Characters Moving In Any Order. You Do Not Need To Choose Four Characters If
You Do Not Wish To, But The Scenarios Are Designed For 4 And Even Then You
Will Need A Good Combination Of Brute Force And Magic To Succeed. The Fewer
Characters You Select, The More Difficult The Scenario. Choose Your Party Of

Way You Wish To The Following Attributes. 

Body   Combat   Perception   Strength   Mind      

The Five Points Are Represented By The Candle Of Life Force On The Left Of
The Screen. You Cannot Decrease Any Of The Character Attributes Below The
Default Minimum. To Alter An Attribute, Move On To The Appropriate Icon. An Up
Or Down Cursor Will Automatically Appear And Each Time You Click On
This, The Level Will Move Up Or Down By One. You Can Still Rearrange The
Levels After The Candle Has Extinguished By Taking Away Points And
Reallocating Them In The Same Way Until You Are Happy With The
Configuration. Click On The Cursors Underneath The Character Icon To Take
You To The Next Party Member. When You Are Happy With Your
Modifications, Click On The Arrow At The Foot Of The Page To Return To The

Map Screen/Play Game

The Map Screen Looks Something Like This: Your Current Location Will Be Shown 
By A Flag. The Possible Destinations To Choose From, At Any One Time. To 
Choose A Destination, Click Onto One Of The Icons With The Mouse And Your 
Flag Icon Will Move There. You Will Now Begin Your Next Adventure Or Enter A
Trading Post. As Well As The Scenarios That Make Up The Legacy Of
Sorasil, There Are Three Trading Posts Where You Will Be Able To Buy And
Sell Equipment And Hear Rumours That May Help You On Your Quest. At The End
Of A Scenario You Will Be Returned To The Main Menu. 

Trading Posts

There Are Three Trading Posts In Legacy Of Sorasil, Where You Can Buy
Weapons And Equipment Or Hear Rumours That May Aid You In Your Quest. To
Sell An Object Click On The S And You Will Be Presented With A Price List
Giving The Amount The Trader Is Willing To Pay You For A Particular
Object. To Select An Item For Sale, Move The Scroll Bar Using The Cursors
Until The Item Is Highlighted. The Item Will Now Appear Next To Your
Character Icon. Click On The Item With The Left Mouse Button, Drag It Onto
The Shop Counter And Click Again To Release It. The Item Will Now Disappear
From Your Inventory, And Your Gold Total Will Be Credited By The Appropriate 
Amount. It's Worth Bearing In Mind That These Traders Buy Low And Sell High. 
This Means You Will Always Pay More To Buy An Item Off A Trader Than He Will To
Buy The Same Item Off You!That's Business. To Buy An Item Click On The B And A
List Of All The Traders Current Stock Will Appear. If You See An Item You Wish
To Purchase, Move The Scroll Bar Until It Is Highlighted. The Item Will Appear 
On The Desk In Front Of The Trader. Click On The Item And Move It To Your 
Character Icon. Click A Second Time To Deposit It In Your Backpack. The 
Appropriate Amount Of Gold Coins Will Be Deducted From Your Purse. Several 
Items Are Subject To Availability And A Trader May Not Have The More Exotic 
Items In Stock For Long. You Should Also Note The Prices Of Each Item. 
Generally Speaking, The More Expensive The Merchandise, The More Effective It 
Will Be. Finally, Remember That Not Every Character Can Use Every Weapon. The 
Mage, For Instance, Would Have Trouble Lifting A Broadsword, Let Alone Hitting 
Anyone With It! Should You Be Foolish Enough To Attempt To Buy Weapons You 
Cannot Use, Don't Count On The Trader Letting You Know, He Is There To Make 
Money, After All, Happy Shopping!

Turn

The Game Is Divided Into Turns: You Move Your Characters First Then The Forces
Of Darkness Move Theirs. Each Of Your Characters Move In The Order You
Selected At The Start, And There Are A Range Of Options Each Can Carry
Out. These Are Represented By The Icons At The Foot Of The Screen And
Described In Detail Below. Each Character Has An Allocation Of 20 Action
Points Per Turn That Can Be Used In Which Ever Way You Wish. Complex Actions
Will Eat Away At These Points, So Spend Them Carefully. For Example: Actions
Such As Moving Use Less Points Than Searching The Surrounding Area For
Traps Or Treasure. As A Rule Of Thumb, 1 Movement = 1 Action Point, Whilst A
Search Could Cost 10 Or More. You Will Of Course Only Be Able To Carry Out
Actions If You Have Sufficient Points Left. By Using Your Points Wisely You
Will Find That You Will Be Able To Move, Engage In Combat, Or Cast A Spell
And Search For Traps In A Single Turn. The Actions A Character Can Carry Out
During A Turn Are As Follows: 

1. Movement   
2. Combat
3. Magic
4. Search For Secret Treasure
5. Search For Secret Doors/Traps
6. Look At The Map
7. Open Doors
8. Check Inventory

These Are Represented By The Icons In The Book At The Front Of The
Screen. When An Option Is No Longer Available To You The Icon Will Dim. When
You Have Completed A Character's Activities For The Next Character. When You
Have Finished Moving All Your Characters, The Forces Of Darkness Will Move
Theirs. The Map Will Appear On Screen Showing The Movements Of Any Monsters
And Any Combat Between Them And Your Party Will Be Resolved. The Screen Will
Then Darken For A Few Seconds Whilst The Data Is Updated And You Can
Continue To Move Your Characters Again. 

Movement

The Playing Area Is Divided Into Squares And Movement Into Each Square
Costs 1 Action Point. Characters Can Move Up To Their Maximum Allocation Of
Movement Points Per Turn, But They Do Not Have To Use All Of Them. Movement
Points Are Displayed In The Bottom Left Hand Corner Of The Screen. (Under
The Footprints). There Are Two Ways Of Moving A Character: 

Firstly, Using The Mouse, Click On One Of The Four Direction Arrows To Move
Your Character In The Direction You Wish. The Directions Available To You
Are Highlighted, Obviously You Will Be Unable To Walk Through A Tree For
Example. You Can Change Direction As Many Times As You Wish By Simply
Clicking On A Different Directional Arrow. 

Secondly, If You Know How Many Movement Points Your Character Has You Can
Use The Mouse To Click On A Square You Wish That The Character To Move
To. The Character Will Then Move To That Square Using The Minimum Number Of
Movement Points Possible. You Do Not Have To Use Your Movement Points All At
Once. You Can, For Example, Move, Engage In Combat Or Search And Then Move
Again, But Remember You Will Be Restricted By The Amount Of Action Points
You Have Used During Your Turn. A Character May Not Move Diagonally Nor Move
Onto An Occupied Square. You Can Move Through A Square Occupied By A Fellow
Party Member Only If There Is Room For You To Exit That Square. You May
Never Occupy Nor Move Through A Square With A Monster In It. 

Combat

Combat Is Split Into Two Stages: Attack And Defence But Both Are Moderated
By The Computer. To Engage An Enemy In Combat You You Must Stand On A Square
Adjacent To Them And, Using The Left Mouse Button, Click On The Sword Icon At
The Foot Of The Screen. The Cursor Will Now Change Into A Sword. Simply Point
The Sword Onto The Enemy You Wish To Fight And The Computer Will Resolve
Combat. If Your Characters Strikes An Opponent Three Times During An Attack
Round, This Indicates That Combat Was Successful And That A Hit Has Been
Made Against Your Opponent. The Time It Takes For One Round Of Combat
Depends Upon Which Character Is Fighting. The Barbarian And The Fighter Will
Use Up Less Of Their Action Points Per Combat Round Than The Other
Characters. You Cannot Attack Diagonally, But Up To Four Characters Can
Attack The Same Opponent. To Save Time Moving Between Character And Icon You
Can, If You Wish, Click On The Combat Icon With The Right Mouse Button. From
Then Onwards, Every Time You Press The Right Mouse Button The Cursor Will
Change Into A Sword And You Can Proceed To Engage Combat In The Usual
Manner. The Option To Take This Short Cut Is Not Restricted To The Combat
Icon, But Can Be Used With Any Other Icon I.E. Spells, Map, Search Etc. 

Magic

All Characters Can Use Magic Potions And Certain Characters Are Able To Use
Spells. The Effectiveness Of A Spell Or Potion Is Gauged By The Mind Points
Of The Caster. A Potion Of Lightning Bolt Thrown By The Barbarian Will Prove
Far Less Effective Than One Hurled By The Mystic And Of Course, Don't Expect
The Big Man To Do Much Else That Turn. The Greater A Characters Intelligence
The More Potent The Spell Or Potion And The Less Time It Takes To Cast. To
Cast A Spell Or Use A Potion Click Onto The Magic Icon. This Will Take You
To A Screen Similar To The Inventory, But Instead Of Equipped And Backpack
This Has Two Sections Headed Potions And Spells (Spells Can Be Used More
Than Once Whilst Potions Have Only One Charge). Use The Mouse To Click On
The Spell Or Potion You Wish To Use: The Cursor Will Now Change To A
Pentacle. Now Click On The Arrow At The Bottom Right Of The Screen, This Will
Take You Back To The Main Playing Screen. If The Spell Or Potion You Are
Casting Affects An Area Or Can Only Be Used On The Caster
Themselves(E. G. Potion Of Health)The Magic Will Now Work Automatically. If
The Magic Is Cast At A Specific Individual, The Pentangle Will Remain On The
Screen. Place The Pentangle Over The Character Or Monster You Wish To Cast
The Spell At And Click The Left Mouse Button. If You Now Decide Not To Cast
The Spell, Click The Right Mouse Button. If Your Magic Was Successful The
Effects Of Your Magic Will Appear On The Screen. Remember The Effectiveness
Of All Magic Is Dependant Upon The Mindpoints Of The Caster; Don't Be Too
Surprised If The Fighter Fails To Send The Wraith To Sleep. 

For A List Of Magic Spells And Their Effects See The Spellbook. 

Searching For Traps/Secret Doors

Click On The Door Icon With The Left Mouse Button And An On Screen Message

Traps/Secret Doors You Have Discovered It Remains A Hazard Until It Has

A Tool Kit In His Inventory Screen, The Other Characters Must Buy One). Once
You Have Discovered A Trap, Move Your Character With The Tool Kit To A
Square Adjacent To The Trap, Select The Toolkit Icon From Your Inventory And
Exit The Inventory. Click On The Trap You Wish To Deactivate With The
Cursor. The Square Is Now Safe To Walk Over. Monsters Do Not Set Off

Foolhardy As Traps Are Just As Dangerous To The Second Person Who Activates
Them As The First.

Movements Of The Forces Of Darkness For Their Corresponding Turn. Looking At
The Map Costs You No Action Points. You Can Scroll Around The Map By Using
The Four Arrows In The Bottom Right Hand Corner Of The Screen. This Will
