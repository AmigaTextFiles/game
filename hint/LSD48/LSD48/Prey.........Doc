"Something has happened on asteroid KG-42. Contact has been lost with
the colonists, and although faint life signs can be detected inside the
base they are not clear enough for us to beam up survivors.

We are sending you in to rescue them, but beware, we have received reports 
of poison gas filling the corridors so you`ll have to move fast. It`s causing
hallucinations in the survivors, we heard garbled radio communications 
before we lost contact - something about aliens.
 
Of course we`ve scanned the asteroid for non-human life forms, and we`ve
found nothing, so you`re perfectly safe...."

HOW TO PLAY

Your first task is to get to the MEDICAL section (see map) and refill your 
oxygen tank. To rescue the colonists you will have to manually check every
room in the station. Remember, we`re sending you in to rescue all of them. 
If you quit too early then you`ll be in deep trouble, those people are 
relying on you...  You will be kept in constant radio contact, keep your
eyes open, and good luck!

Usethe arrow keys on your CD controller to move around the station. Press
the RED button to bring up your current status. This tells you how many 
people you have rescued, and how many aliens you have killed. Press the BLUE
button to access your map. In map mode, press the up arrow to zoom in, the
down arrow to zoom out. Button A will locate the current target, and button 
B will quit back to your helmet viewscreen.

When fighting aliens, use the arrow keys to move right and left, button A to
attack (if you have suitable weapon) and button B or down arrow to duck.

Bye Guyz........
