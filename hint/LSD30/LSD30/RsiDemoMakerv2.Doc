                    RSI Demo Maker Kit Documentation
                    --------------------------------

                                -  NOTE -

               These Are The FULL COMPLETE Documents For The
            Use of The Red Sector Demo Maker And Should Not Be
                      Edited In Any Way Shape Or Form



So you went and copied the best demo maker ever produced and went
straight into the program without reading the dox first (don't we
all ?).  But now after hours of mega frustration and sweat you finally
get around to reading the instructions.

Up until now there have been none, but Android & Blackbeard of
DIANETIX ripped its arse off and found out the following....


Music Routine
-------------
Click on 'EDIT' to choose which module type you are loading.  Most
popular is the Protracker selection.


Music
-----
Click on load then wait for the directory to be loaded, then select
the module by pointing to it with the mouse pointer and clicking the
left mouse button (surprise surprise !).  Then click on Ok or Load
depending which version you are using.


Upper And Lower Scrolltext Codes
--------------------------------
Shift & S1-5    This should give you a grey 'S' followed by the number
                chosen.
                ie.  S3
                This gives the scrolltext its speed value and the
                default is 3.

Shift & B1-3    This gives you copper pulse bars.
                Choices are left,right & middle spread.  You can also
                edit the copper with 'EDIT' SCROLLBARCOLS.

Shift & M0-1    Mirror Effect 0=off 1=on.  Used in conjunction with
                the next command.  The mirror only works with the
                32 point fonts.

Shift & C1-4    This is the colour backdrop for your mirror.
                You have 4 to edit.

Shift & O0-1    This operation switches between 16 pt and 32 pt fonts
                in the upper and lower scroll areas.
                0 = 32pt    /    1 = 16pt

Shift & J1-4    This jumps your text.  Only works with 16pt fonts.

Shift & H       Holds Your text for a while.

Shift & L0-8    Displays a little logo for a while.

Shift & W1-6    Wibbles the 32pt font.  6 different effects.



Loading Your Own Graphics
-------------------------

1.       Load your image into the converter.
2.       Set the 'SAVE FILE AS' to IFF.
3.       Cut your picture with the sizes given below.
4.       Save em.  they are ready, but they must be exact !!

Little Logo     16 Cols         320 By 54
Big Logo 16 Cols                320 By 158
32pt Font       16 Cols         320 By 192
16pt Font 1pl   1  Col          320 By 48
16pt Font       8  Cols         320 By 48
8pt  Font       8  Cols         320 By 16
Vectorstars     4  Cols         128 By 15       8 Anims
Starfields      4  Cols          48 By 9        3 Sizes
Bobs            8  Cols         160 By 16       8 Anims

Use the other utils on the DIANETIX RSI Extras Disks to
create Vector Objects & Vector Balls.


Best just to mess around with all of these, some pleasing effects can
be created with the right co-ordinates, so here are some guiders
for various effects.


Plasma
------
This has 2 sine waves you must control ie. XADD1 - XADD2.

XADD & YADD are raster separation variables.
Speed etc. speak for themselves.  High speed numbers reverse the
direction of flow.


Vectorstars
-----------
When used in conjunction with a Vector Object, use the same X,Y,Z,
co-ordinates for both to create a 3D effect.

Most of the controls are self evident, but mess around.


Vectorballs
-----------
Angles X,Y,Z    -       Start Angles
Rotate X,Y,Z    -       Rotation Speed
Add    X,Y,Z    -       Object Path


Bob Effect
----------
BobNo    -      Starting Anim Frame
BobAnim -       Ending Anim Frame

             ************************************************
             * RSI Demomaker V2.0 Additions Start From Here *
             ************************************************

The Demo Menu
-------------

1.  You can find out the time length and amount of kilobytes
    taken when you save your demo.

2.  You can set a default timer to ask you to save your demo.

3.  You can now set the default DIR to read & write.

4.  I have found the addition of a genlock device compleately
    useless as it craches the program.

5.  The format command now works without producing a guru meditation.



New 32 Point Font Wibbles

                         -----------------

Screen Description
------------------

                   A - The one you will be using for multicolour
                       32 Point - 16 Point & 8 Point font sizes.

                   B - This is for 1 bitplane fonts which you can
                       design your sinus scroll text fonts which we
                       will cover at a later stage.

                   C - This is for the creation of Vectorfonts which
                       we shall cover at a much later stage as this
                       bit is not for the squeemish.  It is to
                       some degree a fairly advanced multipoint
                       structured font design centre which we can 
                       dedicate a whole tutorial to.



32 Point - This option will give you 16 colours to play with and 
           three boxes, one in the centre, and two on the left.

16 Point - This option will give you a smaller box and only 8
           colours.

10 Point - This is of no concequence unless you are a coder as
           the demomaker will not accept the size.

8  Point - This option gives you the smallest box with 8 colours.


Just below the size selection boxes are two windows, one contains
the word "TEXT" click in here to type aword of your choice, when you
press return you will see a representaion of the word using your
current designed font.  The small RED line above this box will show
you your entire font set when you click it.

SNAP - Fixes Your Designed Letter In Place 
COPY - Copies Your Letter To Another
UNDO - Will Undo The Last Command You Did
CLR  - Will Clear The Letter

Right of that are four boxes. 

1. Will horizontally flip your letter.
2. Will execute a vertical flip.
3. Will rotate your letter by 90 degrees.
4. Will activate / deactivate a set of crosshairs.
 
The brush menu contains: a square brush
                         a round brush
                         a single pixel brush
                         a custom brush brush !!

[ ] - The Grab Tool


Fills - There are two types: Colour Fill & Custom Brush Fill
        They are located below the brush menu and are next 
        to each other.

Vertical Slider: This controls the size of your current size PRESET brush.


Colour Menu
-----------

16 Colours Left & Right (Background & Foreground)
LMB On Either - Colour Selected - Boxes, Bring Up
Two Different Requesters Similar To Those In D-Paint.

- Fill Type - & - Colour Manipulation -

Displayed Below The Colours Are Your X/ Y Co-Ords.
 
Select Letter - Brings up an ASCII screen, click on the
                letter you want to alter

When you have saved your final font set it should be ready to
load straight into the demomaker.



	
                          Vectorball Editor      
		         -------------------

Once the program has loaded up you are faced with 3 choices:

1 - The Vectorball Editor
2 - The Transformation Menu (Anim)
3 - The Rotation Menu

First step is to make something !!!!.  So go into the editor.


The Editor
----------

View    -       This is the angle at which you see your object, you can have
                Front, Back , Top, Bottom, Left & Right.

Zoom    -       This closes & opens the gap between balls.

Raster  -       This is a "Snap To Grid" feature used to lock balls
                in a straight line etc.  

X,Y,Z   -       This determines the scale of your Raster.
Upper  

X,Y,Z   -       Moves balls to a more precicse measurement in all
Lower           3 axis.

Clear   -       Clears all balls and settings from memory, except
                the predesigned vectorballs (Ballart).

Total   -       Gives a total of how many ball are in use at
Balls           present time.  The maximum number allowed is 95.

Actual  -       Ballnumber to edit or move etc.  This operation can 
                also be done with the left and right cursor keys.

Ballart -       Allows you to skip through the predesigned ballart
                to choose your ball.  This operation can also be done 
                with the up and down cursor keys.


When on the actual working area, the left mouse button duplicates the
last object added provided you are on that ball.  The right mouse
button moves the ball to any destination in your current axis.




The Transform Menu
------------------


This is the area where things get juicy !!!!!

1       -       Load or create an object in the editor.

2       -       Save the object.

3       -       Alter the object in the editor to make an animation 
                frame.

4       -       Exit the editor (Your work is not lost) and enter
                the transform menu.

5       -       Get Object 1 from the editor (Frame 1).

6       -       Get Object 2 from the disk (Your first save of
                your object).

7       -       Click on "Test Trans",  now you see the object
                tweens from one object to another.


Variables:      You can alter:-  Object 1 Time - 0 to 99
                                 Object 2 Time - 0 to 99

                this is the amount of time the object stays on one
                frame before tweening to the next.

                                
                                 Anim Speed - 4 to 400

                                 Mode - Loop Anim or Restart Anim.


The Rotate Menu
---------------

Remember the RSI Helicopter ?

Well this is how you do the blades !!!
                               	     

Axis    -       This is the axis your ball will mainly travel in, only
                moving from that axis depending on the X, Y, Z 
                co-ordinates given.

Speed   -       This controls the speed of the rotation.

First   -       This means: Animate all balls from this one to the
Ball                        last one.

Last    -       This is:    The last ball of the above.
Ball                               

AddX, AddY, AddZ, add in pixels the variation from the main axis
from the first ball to the last.

Of course all data can be saved and loaded directly into the RSI Demo
Maker.  




                         The Vector Object Editor
                         ------------------------


Ok, upon loading, you are given a main menu.

1. The Object Editor
2. The Transformation Editor
3. The Rotation Editor

If You Have Delusions Of Grandure, Forget It !!!!

Learn To Make Something First .......


Ha, Bloody Ha, !!!

Serves you right for not reading these dox first,  The one major
bug in the program is that on odd occasions it will NOT draw a
circle, (This however only happens when some kind of garbled code
is in memory)

The thing to do is either load in an object, then clear it.
Ok, if you test the circle command now, you should find that it`s ok.

If NOT, Then try clearing the screen, then exiting the program.
When you re-enter, be sure to turn on the RASTERS.
