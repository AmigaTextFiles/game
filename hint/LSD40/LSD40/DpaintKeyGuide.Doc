 Brushes 
 
 Built in brushes. Right clicking invokes the resize brush option.
 when you move the brush to the screen, your cursor will have the
 word SIZE hanging from it. To increase or decrease the size of the
 brush, drag the mouse.

 You can also change the size of the current brush dynamically, even
 while you're painting. Press the (+) key to increase the size or
 the (-) to decrease the size.


 Dotted Freehand
 "Dotted Freehand"

 Keyboard equivalent: s - mnemonic - sketch

 Let you paint freehand with the current built-in (or custom) brush.
 Hold the left button to paint with the foreground color, or the
 right mouse to paint with the background color.

 Holding down the SHIFT key while painting constrains the tool to
 move either horizontally or vertically depending on which direction
 you move the cursor.

Continuous Freehand
 "Continuous Freehand Filled Freehand Shape"

 Keyboard equivalent: d - mnemonic - draw  D - Filed draw

 Click in the upper left corner to select Continuous Freehand Tool.
 Click in the lower right corner to select the Filled Freehand
 Shape Tool.

 Holding down the SHIFT key while painting constrains the tool to
 move either horizontally or vertically, depending on the direction
 you move the cursor.

 Use the Filled Freehand Shape Tool to draw filled freehand shapes.
 Holding down i as you click on the Filled Freehand Shape tool causes
 the tool to paint shapes that are filled and then outlined with the
 current brush using the settings of the Spacing requester.

Straight Line Tool"
 "Straight Line Tool"

 Keyboard equivalent: v - mnemonic--vector  V - spacing requester

 Paints a straight line in any direction.

 Holding down the SHIFT key while painting a straight line constrains
 the line to be either horizontal or vertical.

 Holding down the CTRL key as you paint a straight line, causes the
 line to leave "traces" as you paint.

 Right clicking the Straight Line Tool displays the Spacing requester.
 The Spacing requester let you specify the space between the paint
 "splats" deposited by the brush. Click to choose any or the 4 options.

 N TOTAL

 Defines the total number of "splats" that will occur along the line.

 EVERY  NTH DOT

 Spacing sets the number of pixels between each "splat" of the brush.

Airbrush
 "Airbrush"

 Paints using the Airbrush tool along the path defined by any tool
 affected by the Spacing requester. The number to the right of the
 button sets the number of airbrush sprays to be applied at each
 pixel along the path.

Continuous
 "Continuous"

 This spacing paints an unbroken path with no space between pixels. This
 is the default setting.

Curve Tool
 "Curve Tool"

 Keyboard equivalent: q - mnemonic - qurve

 Use the curve tool to draw an arc between two points. The width of
 the line is determined by the current built-in (or custom) brush.
 The curve works like the straight line tool, except that the line
 remains attached to your cursor, so you can specify the third point
 in the arc.

 > Select the curve tool, and position the cursor where you want the
   curve to begin.

 > Draw to where you want the curve to end, and release the mouse
   button.

 > Move the mouse in any direction to form the arc shape you want and
   click.

 Holding down the SHIFT key while painting with the curve too constrains
 the tool to move either horizontally or vertically as you paint the
 initial line, depending on the direction you move the cursor immediate-
 ly after pressing SHIFT . This is useful if you want the ends of your
 curve to line up horizontally or vertically.

 Holding down the CTRL key as you paint a curve causes the curve to
 leave "traces" as you paint.

 Right clicking the curve tool displays the spacing requester (see
 Straight Line Tool) for an explanation of the options.

Fill Tool
 "Fill Tool"

 Keyboard equivalent: f - mnemonic - fill  F - Fill Type requester

 Use the Fill tool to fill an enclosed area using the current settings
 in the Fill Type requester. To use the tool:

 > Move the paint can cursor over the enclosed area you want to fill
 so that the tip of the spout is within the area.

 > Click to fill the enclosed area.

 Holding down i when you click with the Fill cursor, fills outward to
 the background color. In other words, the fill spreads outward until
 it reaches areas of the current background color.

 Holding down the ALT Key when you click with the Fill cursor, animfills
 the shape. This means that the frames of your animation will flip, and
 the fill tool will fill outward on each frame from the point where you
 clicked. This option works with all of the Fill Types except the 
 gradient fills that use the gradient direction line to define the
 gradient.

 Right clicking the Fill tool displays the Fill type requester. The
 options in the requester are explained in the following paragraphs.
 When you return to the painting screen after choosing a fill type, 
 the current gradient (or pattern, if Pattern or Perspective is
 selected) and its orientation are shown in the Color Fill box in the
 title bar.
 
 SOLID

 Fills with the current color. If you paint or fill your shape using the
 left button, the shape is filled with the FG color. If you paint or fill
 your shape using the right mouse button, it is filled with the background
 color. This is the default.

 BRUSH

 Fills with one image of the current brush and sizes it to fit the filled
 area.

 WRAP

 Fills with one image of the current custom brush and adjusts it to the
 horizontal and vertical shape of the filled area. This gives the illusion
 of wrapping the brush around a 3D solid. The effect is most pronounced
 if you use it to fill a shape that is very different from the shape of
 the custom brush.

 PERSPECTIVE

 Fills with a pattern of the current brush in the current perspective
 setting.

 HBRITE

 Fills using the Hbrite painting mode. This is a special form of tinting
 that only works if you are working in Halfbrite mode. When you are not
 in Halfbrite mode, this option does not appear in the requester. Drawing
 with the right mouse button over Halfbrite areas reverts them to their
 full color counterparts.

 PATTERN

 Fills with a pattern made from a brush. to use this option, you must
 first click the FROM BRUSH button to create a pattern of the current
 brush. This pattern remains the current fill pattern until you click
 FROM BRUSH again to create a new pattern from you new custom brush.

 RANGE

 Fills an enclosed object with a spread of colors from the selected range.
 Type in the number of the range you want to see. Click to select one of
 the fill options, which specify the direction and type of the gradient
 fill. You can only use one fill at a time.

 HORIZONTAL       Paints the gradient horizontally.

 VERTICAL         Paint the gradient vertically with an even distribution.

 HORIZONTAL LINE

 Paints the gradient one line at a time and adjusts the gradient on each
 line so that it follows the contours of the shape being filled.

 GRADIENTS

 Deluxepaint supports two types of gradients: Linear and Radial. A linear
 gradient fills an object in one direction(in a line) and can either take
 the object's shape into account, or ignore it. A Radial gradient fills
 an object in all directions(radially) from the point where you click 
 until it reaches the boundaries of the object. Like Linear gradients, a
 Radial gradient can either take the object's shape into account, or
 ignore it.

 LINEAR GRADIENTS

 The linear gradients are LINE and SHAP(ED). When you fill an object with
 either of these options, a gradient directional line stretches from the
 center of the object to the cursor. Use this line to tell Deluxepaint
 the direction in which to fill the shape with the gradient. For example,
 if you move the directional line to the top of your shape and click.
 Deluxepaint fills your shape with the selected gradient from top to
 bottom. The first color in the gradient appears at the bottom of the
 shape.

 LINE

 Line fills the object with a uniform linear gradient, ignoring the shape
 of the object. Shaped fills the object with a linear gradient taking the
 shape of the object into account, so gradient line tend to follow the
 object's contours.

 RADIAL GRADIENTS

 The radial gradients are CIR(CULAR), CON(TOURS), and (HI)LIGHT. When you
 select any of them and click on a shape, a gradient directional line
 stretches from the center of the object you filled to the cursor. Move
 the cursor, which is attached to the directional line to the spot where
 you want the gradient to begin and click. Deluxepaint will fill your
 shape radially outward from the point where you clicked. Radial
 gradients are especially useful for drawing shadows and other consistent
 three dimensional lighting effects.

 CIR

 Circular fills the object with a circular (shaped) gradient radiating
 outward from the point where you click. Like the Straight linear fill.
 Circular does not take the shape of the object into account.
 
 CON

 Contours fills the object with the gradient taking the shape of the
 object into account. This creates a contour effect, reminiscent of
 topographical maps.

 HI

 Highlight is similar to Contours, but optimized to create a highlight
 effect. Like Contours, the object is filled with its shape taken into
 account.

 RANDOM

 When you click the Random action button, a check appears. With Random
 turned on, the border between any two colors in the gradient are randomly
 mixed. Click the action button a second time to turn off Random.
 
 DITHER

 Deluxepaint draws patterned gradients by dithering, which reduces the
 contrast between adjacent colors(without changing, the colors
 themselves). When Random is checked, you can adjust the degree of color
 mixing in the gradient fill. Drag the Dither slider left or right to
 decrease or increase the amount of dither. Setting the slider all the
 way to the left gives almost no mixing between shades. Moving the slider
 to the right increases the amount of mixing at the color boundaries.

Airbrush Tool
 "Airbrush Tool"

 Simulates the action of an airbrush by spraying with the custom brush.

 > Select the Airbrush tool. Position the cross-hair on the page and
   drag to paint.

 Holding down the SHIFT key while painting with the Airbrush tool con-
 strains the tool to move either horizontally or vertically depending
 on the direction you move the cursor immediately after pressing SHIFT.

 Right clicking on the Airbrush tool lets you size its nozzle. After
 right-clicking the tool, move the cursor onto the page and drag the
 mouse until the nozzle is the size you want, then release the mouse
 button.

Rectangle
 "Unfilled/Filled Rectangle"

 Keyboard equivalent r - unfilled R - filled; mnemonic  - rectangle

 Use Rectangle tool to paint rectangle shape using any brush. The upper
 left half of the tool paints a rectangle outline using the size of
 the current brush and the current settings of the Spacing requester.
 The lower right half of the tool paints a filled rectangle using the
 current settings of the Fill Type requester.

 > Select the Rectangle tool, and position the cursor on the page where
   you want the rectangle to begin.

 > Drag the cursor diagonally to form a rectangle. When the rectangle is
   the size you want, release the mouse button.

 Holding down the SHIFT key while painting with the Rectangle tool con-
 strains the rectangle to be the same number of pixels wide and high.
 You'll notice that this shape is not necessarily a square. This is be-
 cause the pixels in the Amiga display are not square. To paint a square
 turn on the BE SQUARE option in the Prefs menu. When BE SQUARE is on
 Deluxepaint IV adjusts the height and width of your square so that it
 appears square rather than being square in terms of pixel count.

 Holding down the CTRL key as you paint a rectangle, causes the rectangle
 to leave "traces" as you paint.

 Holding down i as you click on the Filled Rectangle tool causes the
 tool to paint shapes that are filled and then outlined with the current
 brush using the settings of the Spacing requester.

 Right clicking on the Unfilled Rectangle tool displays the Spacing re-
 quester. Use this requester to set the spacing between "splats" in the
 sides of your rectangle.

 Right-clicking on the Filled Rectangle tool displays the Fill Type
 requester. Use this requester to set the type of fill you want in
 your rectangle.

Circle
 "Unfilled/Filled Circle"

 Keyboard equivalent: c - unfilled  C - filled: mnemonic - circle

 Use the Circle tool to paint circles using any brush. The upper left
 half of the tool paints a circle outline using the current brush and
 the current settings of the Spacing requester. The lower right half of
 the tool paints a filled circle using the current settings of the Fill
 Type requester.

 > Select the Circle tool, and position the cursor on the page where
 you want the center of the circle.

 > Drag the cursor in any direction to form the circle. When the circle
 is the size you want, release the mouse button.

 The circles that Deluxepaint IV paints may not appear perfectly circu-
 lar. Circles are painted to be the same number of pixels high as they
 are wide. The circles do not appear perfectly circular because the
 pixels of the Amiga display are not square. If you want your circles
 to appear ;circular, turn on the BE SQUARE option in the Prefs menu.

 Holding down the CTRL key as you paint a circle causes the circle to
 leave "traces" as you paint.

 Holding down i as you click on the Filled Circle tools causes the tool
 to paint shapes that are filled and then outlined with the current
 brush using the settings of the Spacing requester.

 Right-clicking on the Unfilled Circle tool displays the Spacing reques-
 ter. Use this requester to set the spacing between "splats" in the 
 sides of your circle.

 Right-clicking on the Filled circle tool displays the Fill Type reques-
 ter. Use this requester to set the type of fill you want in your circle.

Ellipse
 "Unfilled/Filled Ellipse"

 Keyboard equivalent e - unfilled E - filled: mnemonic - ellipse

 Paints an ellipse. Width and shape of line is determined by brush.
 The upper left half of the tool paints an ellipse outline using the
 current settings of the Spacing requester. the lower right half of the
 tool paints a filled ellipse using the current setting of the Fill
 Type requester.

 > Select tool. Position cursor where you want the center of ellipse to
   be.

 > Move cursor in any direction to form shape you want.

 > Drag mouse in a circular motion to rotate the ellipse. The degree of
   rotation is shown in the menu bar.

 > When the ellipse is positioned in the orientation you want, release
   the mouse button.

 Holding down the CTRL key as you paint an ellipse, causes the ellipse
 leave "traces" as you paint.

 Holding the i as you click on the Filled ellipse tool causes the tool
 to paint shapes that are filled and then outlined with the current
 brush using the settings of the Spacing requester.

 Right-clicking on the Unfilled Ellipse tool displays the spacing
 requester. Use this requester to set the spacing between "splats" in
 the sides of your ellipse.

 Right-clicking on the Filled ellipse tool displays the Fill Type 
 requester. use this requester to set the type of fill you want in your
 ellipse.

Polygon
 "Unfilled/Filled Polygon"

 Use Polygon tool to paint polygon shape using any brush. Upper left
 half of tool paints a polygon outline using the current setting of the
 Spacing requester. The lower right half of the tool paints a filled
 polygon using current settings of Fill Type requester.

 > Select Polygon tool and position cursor where you want one of the
   corners of the polygon.

 > Click and then move the mouse in any direction to pull out a side
   of the polygon.

 > Click to tack down each corner of polygon. Clicking on Polygon's
   point of origin by pressing the SPACE BAR. This automatically
   completes the polygon by connecting your last corner with the origin.
   If you're using the Unfilled Polygon tool, pressing the SPACE BAR
   will not complete the polygon.
 
 Holding down the CTRL key as you paint a polygon causes the polygon
 sides to leave "traces" as you paint.

 Holding down i as you click on the Filled Polygon tool causes the tool
 to paint shapes that are filled and then outlined with the current
 brush using the settings of the Spacing requester.

 Right-clicking on the Unfilled Polygon tool displays the Spacing reques-
 ter. Use this requester to set the spacing between "splats" in the sides
 of your polygon.

 Right-clicking on the Filled Polygon tool displays the Fill Type re-
 quester. Use this requester to set the type of fill you want.

Brush Selector
"Brush Selector"

 Keyboard equivalent: b - new brush  B - previous brush; mnemonic - brush

 Use Brush Selector to create a custom brush from any image on page.

 > Select the Brush Selector, and move the cursor to the page where it
   becomes a large cross-hair.

 > Drag diagonally to enclose the area you want to use as a brush.

 To select a POLYGONAL brush double-click the Brush Selector. Brush Selec-
 tor now looks like a polygonal tool. You can surround area you want to 
 pick up a brush as though you were drawing with the Polygon tool. As
 with the Polygon tool, pressing the SPACE BAR completes the brush
 selection automatically.

 Using the left mouse button to pick up a brush simple copies the selec-
 ted area as a brush. Using the right button to select the brush cuts the
 selected area from the page to make the brush and replaces the area with
 the current background color.

 When you pick up a brush any colors that match the current background
 color are transparent. If you have AUTO TRANSP turned on in the Prefs
 menu, this additional rule applies; if all corners of the brush are of
 the same color, that color becomes transparent, regardless of whether
 it is the background color.

 You can retrieve your most recent custom brush or AnimBrush by right
 clicking the BRUSH SELECTOR or pressing B.
 
 Holding down the SHIFT key while selecting a brush with the rectangular
 Brush Selector will constrain the brush to be a square. This means that
 it will be the same number of pixels high as it is wide. Because the
 pixels of the Amiga display are not square, you brush may not appear
 square. If you want a square brush, turn on BE SQUARE in Prefs menu.
 
  Text
  "Text"

 Keyboard equivalent: t - mnemonic - text T - Text requester

 Use Text tool to add text to your picture.

 > Select Text tool and move the cursor to the page.

 > Click to place the text cursor. Type on keyboard to enter text in the
   current foreground color.

 The text will automatically wrap around the right edge of page and
 restart below the original cursor position. If page size is larger than
 screen, the page scrolls as you type off the edge of screen. The text
 tool does not automatically word-wrap like a word processor. To exit text
 mode press ESC or select another tool.

 Right-clicking the Text tool brings up the Font requester. Here you can
 choose what font to use along with size and features like BOLD, ITALIC,
 etc. Clicking on the up or down arrows by size changes size of font if
 available. Clicking SHOW shows the selected font.
 
  Grid
  "Grid"

 Keyboard equivalents: g - grid on/off; SHIFT-g - grid on and use brush
 handle location as a grid point; mnemonic - grid

 Tools affected by grid are: 
 
 Dotted Freehand           Straight Line
 Rectangle                 Circle
 Ellipse                   Brush Selector
 Text

 Right-clicking the Grid icon displays the Gridding requester. Use this
 requester to adjust the x and y spacing of the grid.

 Right-clicking the grid tool while in Perspective mode displays the
 Perspective Settings requester.  
 
  Symmetry
  "Symmetry"

 Keyboard equivalent: /

 Symmetry tool helps you paint symmetrical patterns around a central point
 or based on a tiling scheme. Symmetry works with all tools except Text
 and Brush Selector.

 Right-clicking the Symmetry tool displays the Symmetry requester. Use this
 requester to choose between the two symmetry modes (Point and Tile) and to
 set parameters for each of the modes.

 POINT SYMMETRY

 Works around a central symmetry point in either Mirror image duplication
 of each point or Cyclic. In Point Symmetry you can select the number of
 symmetry points by using the Order edit box. You can also set the
 location of the symmetry center by clicking Place and then the point
 on the screen where you want the center of symmetry to be.

 PLACE

 Lets you position the central point of your symmetrical pattern. To
 reposition the central point, click Place, move the large crosshair to
 the new location and click. Subsequent symmetrical drawing will be
 centered on the new location.

 TILE SYMMETRY

 Creates "tile" patterns. You can set the horizontal and vertical
 dimensions (in pixels) of the tile in the width and height edit boxes
 (Tile Symmetry requester only). Tile is useful in creating fill patterns;
 once you've created your symmetrical pattern, set the Grid to the same
 spacing as the tiles to pickup exactly one tile as a brush. Tile lets you
 create an entire pattern just by drawing one of its elements, and is an
 ideal tool for textile designers. If you want to use Tile Symmetry to
 paint over an existing picture, choose BACKGROUND>FIX from the Effect
 menu before you turn on Tile Symmetry. This will protect your existing
 picture from any inadvertent alternation.
 
  Magnify
  "Magnify"

 Keyboard equivalent: m - mnemonic - magnify

 The Magnify tool divides the screen into two parts and displays the 
 right-hand side in magnification. This tool is especially useful for
 detail work. When you are in Magnify mode, you can use any other tool
 on either side of the screen.

 > Select the Magnify tool. Position the Magnify box over the part of
 the image you want to enlarge and click with either button.

 This divides the screen into two parts, with the right part magnified.
 You can scroll the magnification window using the arrow keys or the n
 key, which centers the area under the cursor.

 To change the magnification scale click the Zoom icon. Clicking Zoom
 enlarges the magnified area; right-clicking shrinks it.

 You can set the Zoom level before you magnify an area. Changing the Zoom
 setting will change the size of the rectangle attached to your cursor
 when you are in the process of magnifying an area.
 
  Zoom
  "Zoom"

 Keyboard equivalent: > enlarge; < shrink

 Changes the scale in Magnify Mode. Click the Zoom tool to enlarge the
 image; right-clicking to shrink the image.
 
  Undo
  "Undo"

 Keyboard equivalent: u - mnemonic - undo

 Reverses the latest painting action as long as there has not been an
 intervening mouse click or a refresh of the screen such as that caused
 by pressing F9 or F10 to hide or show the menu and toolbox.
 
  CLR
  "CLR"

 Keyboard equivalent: K - mnemonic - Klear

 Clears the screen to the current background color. If you have multiple
 frames, an Options requester appears for you to indicate which frames
 you want to clear.
 
  Color Indicator
  "Color Indicator"

 Indicates the current foreground and background colors. Clicking  the
 color indicator ( or pressing the comma "," from the keyboard) selects
 the eye dropper cursor. This lets you select a new foreground or back-
 ground color by clicking a color onscreen. Click the on-screen color to
 select a new foreground color, or right-click to select a new back-
 ground color. 

 Right-clicking the Color Indicator displays the Mixer. Use the Mixer to
 arrange, modify, and mix colors for your palette.
 
  Palette
  "Palette"

 Clicking a color in the palette selects that color. Click to select a
 new foreground color and right-click to select a new background color.

 You can scroll through the colors in the palette to select a foreground
 color by pressing the [ and ] keys on the keyboard. SHIFT-[ and SHIFT-]

 Keyboard equivalent Right-Amiga l

 Brings up the Load Requester. The Disks button shows all the devices or
 disks mounted on the system. The Assigns button shows all assigns on your
 system. The Parent button takes you up 1 in the directory tree. The # of
 frames edit box near the bottom lets you load multiple pictures at one
 time, as frames of an animation. The pictures must all be in the same
 format. If you already have animation frames, those frames are discarded
 and Deluxepaint creates new frames as you load.
 
  Save
  "Save"

 Keyboard equivalent: Right-Amiga-s

 Displays the Save Picture requester. This requester works like the Load
 requester only it saves to disk.
 
  Delete
  "Delete"

 Keyboard equivalent: Right-Amiga-d

 Brings up the Delete file requester. This works like the Load requester
 only it deletes the file selected.
 
  Print
  "Print"

 Keyboard equivalent: Right-Amiga-p

 Displays the Print Picture requester. The print requester brings up the
 following.

 ASPECT

 Specifies the orientation of the picture on the paper, either Normal, the
 default, or Sideways. Click the Up-arrow button for Normal or the Right-
 arrow button for Sideways.

 IMAGE

 Specifies whether the printout will be a positive or negative image.
 Click the Plus button for positive or the Minus button for negative.
 
 SHADE

 Specifies whether the printout will be in color, in shades of gray, or 
 in black and white. Make sure the setting is appropriate for your
 printer. If you are using a single-color ribbon, click B & W. If you
 want to translate your image's colors into shades of gray, use the Gray
 setting. To print in full color, click Color. For your picture to print
 out correctly in the B & W or Gray settings, your palette should contain
 black, white, and a number of grays.

 PLACEMENT

 Specifies whether the picture should be printed against the left margin
 of the page or centered on the page.

 %/DOTS

 Controls the size of the printout by specifying the % width and % height
 of the printout paper. The DOTS options lets you specify the size of the
 printout in terms of the actual printer pixels. If the % option is
 active then the following parameters can be specified.
 
 % WIDE AND % HIGH

 These let you change the aspect ratio (the ratio of height to width) of
 the picture by setting the percentages for each. The default values are
 100% wide and 0% high. 0% is a special case and tells the printer to
 maintain the same aspect ratio as the screen version of the picture. To
 change the aspect ratio, leave the % wide at 100 and enter a new % height
 value. If the Dots option is active you can set only the printout width
 and height in dots.

 LINE FEEDS

 Specifies number of line feeds you want to insert when the picture is
 printed.

 COPIES

 Specifies how many copies of the picture you want printed.
 
 FORM FEED

 Lets you set whether or not you want the printer to move to the next
 sheet of paper before printing each image. This easily let you print a
 single picture per sheet of paper.

 CANCEL

 If you don't want to print and don't want to save any new settings.
 Click EXIT if you don't want to print, but want to save your settings to
 print later. Click PRINT to print the current picture. If you wish to
 Abort a print request before it is complete, take your printer off-line
 before you click the Abort button.
 
  Flip
  "Flip"

 FLIP

  Spare
  "Spare"

 SPARE

 The spare option presents a submenu with options for manipulating
 Dpaint's spare page.

 SWAP  Keyboard equivalent: j 

 Conceals the page and displays a second or spare page. This means you
 have 2 pages to work with. 
 
  Show Page
  "Show Page"

 SHOW PAGE  Keyboard equivalent S

 Hides the toolbox and title bar, and displays the entire document, if
 necessary in a reduced format. For example, in 640 X 400 page size in
 Lo-Res, it shows only every other pixel. If the page is oversized, you
 can move the rectangle to view a different area of the screen by holding
 down the left mouse button; dragging the rectangle to the area you
 want to view; and releasing the mouse button. You are returned to the
 current page ;with the area of the rectangle in view. Pressing any key
 returns you to the current page ;without repositioning the view.

 For more exact positioning of the rectangle you can move it with the
 arrow keys. The arrow keys move the rectangle one unit at a time. So with
 320 X 200 screen format with 640 X 400 page, the rectangle moves 2 pixels
 at a time. Holding down the ALT key and pressing arrow keys moves the
 rectangle in screen size increments.
 
  Screen Format
  "Screen Format"

 SCREEN FORMAT

 Displays the Screen Format requesters. If you select a number of colors
 that will exceed your available memory, DPaint will retain the format
 you have selected but use fewer colors.

  "Save"

 Brings up the Save brush requester. This is identical to the Save picture
 requester only for brushes.
 
  Restore
  "Restore"

 Keyboard equivalent: B

 Restores as the current brush the custom brush you last used after you've
 used an Animbrush, a built-in brush, or modified your custom brush with
 an option from the Brush menu. Restore does not reverse the effect of
 all brush manipulations in the Brush menu.
 
  Spare
  "Spare"

 The Spare option's submenu has options for manipulating DPAINTS spare
 brush.

 BRUSH>SPARE   Keyboard equivalent: ALT-n

 Moves the current brush to the spare brush position (which is hidden).
 If your current brush is an Animbrush, the current cel of the brush is
 copied to the spare brush position.

 BRUSH<>SPARE } Keyboard equivalent: ALT-b

 Swaps the current brush and the spare brush positions.

 METAMORPH     Keyboard equivalent: ALT-m

 Lets you create a special Animbrush that metamorphoses between the shape
 and colors of the current brush and the shape and colors of the spare
 brush. To use this option, you must first have a custom brush and a
 "spare" custom brush.
 
 When you choose Metamorph, the Make Animbrush requester appears. Enter
 the number of cels you want in the Animbrush. Enter a number and click
 OK. DPaint creates the Animbrush automatically.

 For best results, your custom brush and spare brush should be picked up
 with the same dimensions. This does not mean that the brush images must
 be the same size; but the area that you surrounded to pick up the brush
 images should be the same size.

 The resulting first and last cels of the Animbrush generally do not
 contain exactly the same images as your original custom brush and spare
 brush. Usually you will see some change in the colors of the first or
 last frames.
 
  Size
  "Size"

 The Size option lets you resize the current brush. The submenu presents
 the following options:

 STRETCH      Keyboard equivalent: Z

 Lets you freely stretch the current custom brush in any direction to any
 size. To stretch the brush, drag it to the desired size. Select RESTORE
 from the Brush menu to negate the effect of the stretch.

 Holding down the SHIFT key constrains the stretch operation so that your
 brush maintains the same aspect ratio (relative width and height)
 
 HALVE           Keyboard equivalent: h

 Reduces the size of your brush by 50% in vertical and horizontal
 dimensions.

 DOUBLE          Keyboard equivalent: H

 Doubles the size of your brush in the horizontal dimension. This option
 is useful for reproportioning images that you created in Lo-res and then
 move to Med-res, etc.

 DOUBLE HORIZ    Keyboard equivalent: X

 Doubles the size of your brush in the horizontal dimension.

 DOUBLE VERT     Keyboard equivalent: Y
 
 Doubles the size of your brush in the vertical dimension.
 
  Br. Flip
  "Flip Brush"

 FLIP

 Flip a brush about its X or Y axis. If you flip an Animbrush all frames
 will be flipped.

 HORIZ      Keyboard equivalent: x

 Flips the current custom brush about the X axis.

 VERT       Keyboard equivalent: y

 Flips the current custom brush about the Y axis.
 
  Edge
  "Edge"

 EDGE

 Modifies a one pixel boundary around the current brush.

 OUTLINE      Keyboard equivalent: o

 Adds a one pixel boundary around the current custom brush using the
 current foreground color. This is ideal for outlining text. To increase
 the thickness of the outline, on pixel at a time, select Outline
 repeatedly.

 TRIM         Keyboard equivalent: O

 Deletes a one pixel boundary around the current brush. You can  trim
 repeatedly.
 
  Rotate
  "Rotate"

 ROTATE

 Rotate the current custom brush in any of three ways.
 
 90 DEGREES      Keyboard equivalent: z

 Rotates the current brush clockwise 90 degrees.

 ANY ANGLE

 Let you rotate the current brush any number of degrees. Choose ROTATE>
 ANY ANGLE fro the Brush menu. Hold the left button down and drag the
 rectangular outline about its bottom left corner. Release the button at
 the desired orientation.
 
 SHEAR

 Gives you controlled distortion of the current brush. The top part of
 the brush is anchored, and you can drag the bottom of the brush in
 either direction.
 
  Bend
  "Bend"
 
 BEND

 Use this option to bend a brush horizontally or vertically. Choose
 BEND>HORIZ from the brush menu. Drag the brush outline left or right
 until it is the desired shape. Release the mouse button.

 VERT         

 Lets you bend the current brush in a vertical direction. Choose
 BEND>VERTICAL from the brush menu. Drag the brush outline up or down
 until it is the desired shape. Release the mouse button.
 
  Handle
  "Handle"

 Lets you specify whether the cursor holds a custom brush by its center
 or by one if its 4 other offset positions.

 CENTER      Keyboard equivalent: ALT-s

 Positions the arrow cursor, which represents the handle at the center of
 the brush. This is the default position.

 CORNER      Keyboard equivalent: ALT-x and ALT-y

 Positions the arrow cursor, which represents the handle at on of the 4
 corners of the brush. If you have a custom brush currently held at the
 center, selecting Corner moves the arrow cursor between the lower
 corners. Use ALT-y to move the handle to the top of the brush and toggle
 between the upper corners.

 The location of the arrow cursor the next time you pick up a brush de-
 pends on the direction you drag the mouse when you pick up the brush.
 If you drag down and to the right, the cursor will remain at the lower
 right. If you drag up and to the left, the cursor will move to the top 
 left. The same principle applies if you drag down and to the left or up
 and to the right. In other words, the corner you drag to is the one to
 which the arrow cursor will attach.

 PLACE      Keyboard equivalent: ALT-z
 
 Lets you position the brush handle at any position relative to the brush.
 To place the handle, pick up your brush. Choose HANDLE>PLACE. Drag in any
 direction to offset the cursor from the brush. When you release the mouse
 button, the cursor will hold the brush as you specified.

  Matte
  "Matte"

 Keyboard equivalent: F1

 Uses a custom brush in its original form. Those areas of the brush,
 which match the background color that was in effect when the brush was
 first created, are transparent. Matte is the default mode when you
 create a custom brush using the Brush Selector.
 
  Col
  "Color"

 Keyboard equivalent: F2

 Uses the shape of the brush and fills it with the current foreground
 color. those areas of the brush, which match the background color that
 was in effect when the brush was first created, are transparent.
 
  Replc
  "Replace"

 Keyboard equivalent: F3

 Uses the custom brush in its original form, except that no colors are
 transparent.
 
  Smear
  "Smear"

 Keyboard equivalent F4

 Smears any colors on the page when you drag a brush over them. This
 is like smearing a wet watercolor with your fingers, so the bigger
 the brush, the more pronounced the effect. Smear uses only the colors
 under the brush, and does not add any new colors. Current brush color
 is irrelevant.
 
  Shade
  "Shade"

 Keyboard equivalent: F5

 Shade helps you create subtle shading effects on those colors in your
 picture that are in a cycle range. Like SMEAR, Shade ignores the 
 current brush color but uses its shape. By dragging the brush over
 those colors in your picture that are in the currently selected cycle
 range, you can paint over each color with the next color in the range.
 You can paint with the next-higher color by using the left mouse button,
 and the next-lower color by using the right mouse button.
 
  Blend
  "Blend"

 Keyboard equivalent: F6

 Like SMEAR, Blend affects the colors under the brush by running them
 together. Unlike SMEAR, however, Blend uses additional shades by
 averaging the blended colors, whereas SMEAR uses only the colors under
 the brush. Thus, when you Blend two shades by painting over them, you
 are selecting a third shade from the palette, the closest one the
 program can find to the average of the two original shades.
 
  Cycle
  "Cycle"

 Keyboard equivalent: F7

 Uses the current brush shape and cycles through all the colors in the
 currently selected range as you draw. A range is selected if one of
 its members is selected. If a color is a member of two ranges, selecting
 it selects the first of those two ranges. If your current brush color
 is not within a cycle range, it paints with that color only. Use
 MULTICYCLE (in the Prefs menu) to achieve the same effect with a
 multicolored brush, where each color in the brush cycles through its
 range independently of the others.
 
  Smooth
  "Smooth"

 Keyboard equivalent: F8

 Softens hard lines and reduces the contrast between adjoining areas.
 DPaint finds colors in the palette between the two bordering colors and
 paints the boundary in intermediate shades. Smooth looks at the current
 palette and finds the colors closest to the ones under the brush. Thus
 if the palette contains a wide selection of colors close to the ones
 under the brush, (e.g.the selection of grays in the default palette)
 it will have more colors to draw from to create its weighted averages.
 Smooth is useful for creating airbrush effects and for eliminating
 jagged edges.
 
  Mix
  "Mix"

 The color of your brush mixes interactively with the colors already on
 the screen (in your image). This is particularly effective in HAM.
 
  Hbrite
  "Halfbrite"

 This mode is only available if your computer supports it, and if you
 have selected 64 colors from the Screen Format option in the Picture
 Menu. When you are in HBrite mode, painting with the left mouse button
 darkens colors on your painting to their half-brite equivalent; painting
 with the right button lightens colors that are halfbrite. This mode is
 especially useful in pictures with shadow and highlight effects.
 
 The Amiga supports only 32 color registers directly, but Halfbrite uses
 a trick to double the number of colors available on the screen. The first
 32 registers are standard color registers; the second 32 are halfbrite
 equivalents of the original 32. Pixels that use halfbrite colors point
 to one of the standard color registers and indicate that the color
 should be displayed at half its normal intensity. This means that the
 second 32 pixels are not independent of the first 32; you can change
 the color values only in the first 32 registers, and the change is
 automatically reflected in the halfbrite equivalent.

 Not all Amiga computers support Halfbrite. If HBrite is grayed out in
 the Mode menu, you can't select it.

  "Animbrush Load"

 Displays the Load Animbrush requester. This requester is identical in
 function to the Load Picture requester described under Load in the
 Picture menu, except that you are loading an Animbrush.

 When you load an Animbrush that has a palette different from that of the
 current picture, the picture's palette remains in place. Nonetheless,
 the brush palette information is loaded along with the brush; you can
 change to the brush's palette at any time by choosing PALETTE>USE
 BRUSH PALETTE from the Color menu.
 
  1 Save
  "Animbrush Save"

 Displays the Save Animbrush requester. This requester is identical in
 function to the Save Brush requester described in the Save option of
 the Brush menu.
 
  2 Pickup
  "Animbrush Pickup"

 Selecting pick up is similar to selecting the Brush Selector from the
 Toolbox. However, when you pick up an Animbrush, you pick up all the
 "cels" that make up the animated sequence in the Animbrush.

 Cels are to an animated brush what frames are to an animation. When you
 paint with an Animbrush, the brush cycles through its frames 
 automatically as you paint. The brush will continuously cycle on the
 current animation frame unless you hold down the ALT key when you press
 the mouse button down, in which case the brush will paint each of its
 cels separately into each of the animation sequence frames.

 Choosing Pick up displays the Pick Up Animbrush requester. To pick up
 the whole animation, click OK; drag the cross-hair to select the entire
 "animated" area. When you release the mouse button, DPaint attaches an
 animated brush to your cursor. You can use an Animbrush with any 
 painting tool, just as you would use a custom brush.

 If you want to make an Animbrush from only a few frames of your anima-
 tion, you only need to pick up those frames. Move to the first frame in
 your intended Animbrush and choose ANIMBRUSH>PICKUP. Type in the number
 of cels that will compose your Animbrush in the Pick up Animbrush re-
 quester. Click OK.

 Holding down the ALT key while picking up a brush with the Brush Selec-
 tor is the same as choosing ANIMBRUSH>PICKUP. The Pick up Animbrush
 requester appears. Type in the number of cels that will compose your
 Animbrush and click OK.
 
  3 Settings
  "Animbrush Settings"

 After you have picked up an animated brush, Settings displays the
 Animbrush Settings requester. Use this requester to control the Anim-
 brush.

 NUMBER OF CELS 

 Shows you how many cels of animation are in your Animbrush.
 
 DURATION

 Lets you set the number of frames it takes the Animbrush to move
 completely through its cels. You can also think of this as the rate at
 which the Animbrush transforms. For example, if your brush has 10 cels
 and you set duration to 20, your brush will stamp each of its cels twice
 before flipping to the next cel.

 CURRENT 

 Lets you type in the value for the brush cel you want to start with.
 This is very useful if you want to continue painting from a particular
 cel of your brush. When the requester is not displayed, you can step
 backward and forward through the cels of your Animbrush by pressing 7 or
 8 on the keyboard (not the keypad). SHIFT-7 steps to the first cel, and
 SHIFT-8 steps you to the last cel.

 DIRECTION

 These three icons give you the choice of flipping forward, flipping
 backward, or ping-ponging through the cels of your Animbrush as you paint.
 
  4 Use
  "Animbrush Use"

 Makes the last Animbrush you "picked up" the current brush. This lets
 you pickup an Animbrush, then pickup a regular brush, and then return
 to your Animbrush. You can also restore your Animbrush by right-clicking
 the Brush Selector. This toggles between a standard custom brush and an
 Animbrush.
 
  5 Free
  "Animbrush Free"

 Releases the memory used by the current Animbrush.
 
  Loa
  "Load"

 Displays the Load Anim requester. This requester works like the Load
 Picture requester. When you load an animation, it replaces the one
 currently in memory. When you append an animation, the appended anima-
 tion is added to the end of your current animation. It is also possible
 to load individual pictures into the frames of your animation using the
 Load Picture requester. To do so, go to the frame you wish to load a
 picture into, display the Load picture requester and select the picture
 you wish to load. Your animation will take on the palette of the pic-
 ture loaded. If you want to restore your animation's palette choose
 PALETTE RESTORE PALETTE from the Color menu. If you want to remap the
 picture just loaded to the Animations original palette, choose REMAP
 from the colors menu and select current frame from the requester that
 appears.
 
  Sav
  "Save"

 Displays the Save Anim requester, which works like the Save Picture
 requester described under SAVE in the Picture menu. The one difference
 is that the Frames edit boxes in the Save anim requester let you save
 a section of your animation as an animation rather as a series of
 pictures as in the Save Picture requester.
 
  Mov
  "Move"

 Keyboard equivalent: M

 Displays the Move requester. Use this requester to define a path along
 which your brush is painted in 3D, either on a single frame, or while
 stepping through an animation sequence.

 To use the Move Requester:

 > Stamp your brush on the screen at the starting position you want.

 > Choose Move from the Anim Menu.

 > Enter the Distance and Angle settings you want.

 > Set the Count edit field to the number of frames over which you
   want to animate the brush.

 > Select the Direction of your Move and Record.

 > Select any other settings that apply to your animation.

 > Click Draw to paint the animation with the settings you specified.

 DIST

 The Dist edit boxes let you specify the total distance in pixels that
 the brush will move along the X, Y, and Z axes in your animation. You
 can set the brush to move along the brush axes or the screen axes by
 clicking the Brush action button to the right of the Dist edit boxes.
 
 ANGLE

 The Angle edit boxes let you specify the total angle, in degrees that
 the brush will be rotated about the X, Y, and Z axes. You can set the
 brush to rotate around the brush axes or the screen axes by clicking
 the Brush action button to the right of the Angle edit boxes. Brush
 axes are active by default, which means the rotation is always based on
 the brush coordinate system. If the Brush action button is unchecked,
 any angle rotation takes place along the current axes of the screen
 coordinate system. The "screen", rotation system is an Euler system, and
 the order of rotation is always X, Y, and Z. When you rotate on more
 than one angle, or when the brush has been rotated previously, the
 rotations produced by the screen angle system are not always around the
 axes that are used for the Distance moves along the screen axes.
 Generally it's better to think of the screen angle rotations as "non-
 brush" rather than screen. All rotations occur around the brush handle.
 If you want your brush to appear as though it is orbiting around a
 point away from the brush, you would want to offset the handle from the
 brush.

 BRUSH

 Click these action buttons to toggle a check mark on and off. The option
 selects whether the Dist and Angle movements are relative to the brush's
 coordinate system or relative to the screen coordinate system.
 
 CLEAR

 Click to zero out all of the Move and Angle numbers.

 GO BACK

 Click to restore the brush's starting position (for the next movement)
 to the last place you manually clicked it down.
 
 CYCLIC

 Click this button to turn it on, if you are creating an animation that
 is cyclic (that is, one that starts and ends at the same position). For
 example, if you have 10 frames, and you want a brush to rotate 360
 degrees over the 10 frames to make it look as though it is spinning when
 you play the animation, you would turn Cyclic on. DPaint would calculate
 the rotation.
         
 EASE-OUT

 Set the number of frames over which you want the brush motion to
 gradually accelerate.

 EASE-IN

 Set the number of frames over which you want the brush motion to
 gradually decelerate.

 COUNT

 Set the number of times the brush is painted to complete the total
 movement and rotation as specified by the dist. and angle edit boxes.
 
 DIRECTION

 The Direction action buttons control the direction of your move and the
 order in which the frames of the animation are painted.
 
 MOVE

 Lets you choose to have a move drawn in one of two ways.

 GO FROM starts the movement of the brush from the point where you stamped
 your brush and paints forward.

 COME TO starts the animation at an earlier frame and moves the brush
 forward to the point where you stamped your brush.

 RECORD

 Lets you choose the order in which the frames of the brush move are
 painted. These buttons are available only if you have more than 1 
 animation frame.

 FORWARD 

 Paints the move by stepping forward from the point where you stamped
 your brush. This is the default setting and the one you will use more
 often.

 IN PLACE

 Paints all of the move on the current frame.

 BACKWARD 

 Paints the move in reverse order by advancing to the last frame and
 painting backwards. This option is useful when you are using Trails.
 
 PREVIEW

 Click to view (in "wire-frame" mode) the move you have set up. When the
 preview is complete, the Move requester return. To interrupt the preview
 and return to the Move requester, hit the space bar.
 
 TRAILS

 This button is available only if you have more than one animation frame
 allocated. Clicking Trails is like clicking on the Draw button except
 on each frame you get the sum total of all "trails" of the brush as it
 moves.

 FILL

 Works like draw, except that when you click it, the move you specified is
 used to draw a filled perspective plane based on the rotation of the
 current brush.

 DRAW

 Executes the move that you have specified, causing the brush to be drawn
 into animation sequence.

 CANCEL

 Restores any settings that have been changed and exits this requester.
 
 EXIT

 Exits the requester and keeps all of the settings that you have entered.
 
  Fra
  "Frames"

 Presents a submenu of options for manipulating the frames in your anima-
 tion.
 
 SET #

 Displays ;the Set Frame Count requester. DPaint will try to allocate as
 many frames as are requested. If there is not enough memory to allocate
 the requested number of frames, DPaint will allocate as many as memory
 will allow. You can use this requester to add or delete frames to your
 animation. For example, you could add several frames to the middle of
 your animation by stepping to the frame you want to add frames after,
 and changing the number of frames you want to add.

 Similarly, you could delete several frames from any point in your
 animation by stepping to the first frame you want to delete and changing
 the number of frames to the current count minus the number of frames you
 want to delete. For example, if you have 100 frames and you want to delete
 frames 41 to 50, step to frame 41 and set the number of frames to 90.

 ADD FRAMES 

 Displays a requester that lets you add any number of frames after the
 current frame. DPaint copies the contents of the current frame to the
 added frames and makes the last new frame the current one.

 Keyboard equivalent: + 

 Click on the + icon in the Animation Control Panel. ALT-= will auto-
 matically add a single frame to the animation.

 COPY FRAMES 

 Displays a requester that lets you copy the current frame to a range of
 frames or to all the frames in your animation sequence. Use the Insert
 Before edit box to place the copied range of frames in your animation.

 DELETE FRAMES 

 Displays a requester that lets you delete the current frame, a range of
 frames or all frames in your animation sequence. If you delete the
 current frame, DPaint makes the following frame the current frame unless
 you are already at the last frame.

 Keyboard equivalent: -
 
  Con
  "Control"

 Control displays a submenu of options for moving around in your animation
 frames and for playing the animation.

 PANEL ON/OFF Keyboard equivalent: ALT-a

 Displays the DPaint animation control panel. It contains a Frame Counter
 scroll bar and 15 control buttons for working through and playing your
 animations. Click an option on the Panel to select it.
 
 FRAME COUNTER

 The number of the current frame and the total number of frames in your
 animation appear in the left corner of the Title Bar. You can move to a 
 specific frame by dragging the Frame Counter scroll bar, clicking on 
 either side of the scroll box, or by clicking the Next Frame or Previous
 Frame icons in the Control Panel. Any movement you make is reflected in
 the numbers on the Title Bar.

 SET RATE

 Displays the Set frames per second requester. The default setting is 30
 frames per second (fps). The speed range is between 1 and 60 fps, though
 results of settings over 30 fps are unpredictable. you can set the
 frames-per-second rate by entering a number in the edit field and clicking OK.
 
 SET RANGE

 Displays the Set Play Range requester. Use this requester to instruct
 DPaint to play any range of frames, or all frames in your animation.

 PREVIOUS Keyboard equivalent: 1
 
 Steps the current frame to the previous frame in the animation sequence.
 If the current frame is the first frame, the position is to the last frame.
 
 NEXT     Keyboard equivalent: 2

 Steps the current frame to the next frame in the animation sequence. If
 the current frame is the last frame, the position is set to the first
 frame.

 GO TO    Keyboard equivalent: 3

 Displays the Go to Frame requester. This requester lets you position the
 current frame to any of the available animation frames. You can also 
 display this requester by CTRL-clicking the Go to icon on the animation
 panel.

 REPEAT LAST GO TO Keyboard equivalent: SHIFT-3

 Clicking on this icon brings you to the frame number set in the Go To 
 requester. You can display this requester either by choosing CONTROL>GO
 to from the Anim menu, or by CTRL-clicking on this icon.

 PLAY     Keyboard equivalent: 4

 Plays the animation at the speed set in the Set Rate requester. The
 animation will continue to cycle until you press the spacebar.

 PLAY ONCE  Keyboard equivalent: 5
 
 Plays the animation sequence once through from Frame 1 to the last frame.

 PING-PONG  Keyboard equivalent: 6
 
 Plays the animation sequence continuously as in Play but plays the
 sequence forward then backward then forward then backward and so on.
 Click or press the spacebar to stop.
 
  Met
  "Method"

 The Method menu contains two submenu options which can be used to specify
 the "memory model" of the animation sequence frames. The memory model
 refers only to the animation in RAM,not to the disk file. When you load
 an animation, it is loaded into your current memory model.

 COMPRESSED

 The Compressed Method, while a little more complex than the Expanded
 Method, offers the advantage of permitting many more animation frames
 in memory at one time. It is slower than the expanded method while
 animpainting, loading and saving are slower, and memory tends to frag-
 ment, making it easy to run out of memory.
 
 EXPANDED

 The Expanded Method represents the simplest of the two memory models
 where all of the memory for each animation frame is allocated. If you 
 are in low resolution mode and you have 10 animation frames, then you
 would need enough memory to hold 10 complete 320 X 200 images. 2
 advantages of this method are that the frame flipping for animpainting
 is very smooth, and you will not run out of memory to add an element to
 your animation within the allocated frames. If you set this option and
 then request animation frames, DPaint automatically inserts the maximum
 number of available frames in the Set Frame Count requester so that you
 don't have to guess how many frames you can create.

  Ranges
  "Ranges"

 Keyboard equivalent: CTRL-r

 Displays the Range requester, which you can use to define customized
 color ranges for the color cycling, gradient fill, and Shade features
 of DPaint. The requester lets you specify the colors in a range (max-
 imum of 32 colors) and how the colors are mixed. You can define eight
 ranges for each picture.

 TO DEFINE A RANGE 

 > The RANGE slider indicates the number of the current range. By default
   this is range 1. You can see the range of colors displayed on the
   range bar. Click to the right of the slider or drag the slider to
   the right to access an empty range bar.

   All range-based features depend on the Range number set in this
   requester. Once you've created ranges to work with, you can step
   forward and backward through them without entering the requester by
   pressing ALT-] and ALT-[.
 
 > To select a color for the range, move the arrow cursor to the row
   of colors in the requester and click one.

   When you click a color, it appears in the sample square. The arrow
   cursor becomes the color bead cursor. If you don't want to use the
   color you chose, click another with the color bead cursor. When the
   color you want is in the sample square:

 > Move the bead cursor to the range bar. Position the cursor where you
   want the selected color to fall in the range and click. The color
   appears in the range.

   The position of colors in the range control the cycle direction for
   each range, and also sets the direction of the range when it is
   used as a gradient. The start color is the color furthest left on
   the range. Any color cycling begins with this color.

 REVERSE  Keyboard equivalent: ALT-r

 You can reverse the direction of the color range, and therefore the
 direction of cycling and gradient by clicking the REVERSE action
 button.
 
 > Select another color and position it on the bar. Repeat this step
   until all the colors you want are on the bar, click it, move the
   bead cursor to another position, and click again.

 CLEAR

 To eliminate a color from the bar, click it, move the bear cursor off 
 the bar, and click again. The arrow cursor returns.

 To eliminate all colors from the range, click the CLEAR action button.

 Each color you place on the bar appears in the range sample. The
 gradient between colors, that is the transition of shades from one
 color to the next, is calculated automatically. You can place original
 colors far apart to create subtle blending of colors, or close together
 to create more abrupt transitions between original shades.

 SHOW

 Click SHOW to see the results of you color selections and placements.
 The band beneath the bar shows the gradual transition from color to
 color as it would appear if you had access to all 4096 colors in the
 color universe.

 RATE

 The Rate slider lets you control the speed of color cycling for each
 range.

 RANDOM

 When you click the Random action button, a check appears. When Random is
 on, the border between any 2 colors in the gradient is randomly mixed,
 depending on how you have set the Dither slider. Click the action button
 to turn off Random.

 DITHER

 Dither is only active when Random is selected. Dithering reduces the
 contrast between adjacent colors. 

 REVERT

 This returns the Range requester to the condition it was in before you
 displayed the requester.

 UNDO

 You can reverse the last change you made in the palette by clicking UNDO.
 
  TAB
  "Cycle"

 CYCLE   Keyboard equivalent: TAB

 Toggles color cycling on/off. Color cycling uses the range you define in
 the Range requester.
 
  Pal
  "Palette"

 MIXER ON/OFF  Keyboard equivalent p

 Displays/removes the Color Mixer. You can also display this mixer by
 right-clicking the Color Indicator. The Color Mixer is the master color
 control panel. From here you can mix and modify colors, create spreads,
 and copy or exchange colors.

 DPaint lets you modify colors with either the RGB or the HSV color
 mixing systems. RGB is the default. HSV simply breaks each color down
 into its Hue, Saturation, and Value.

 HUE refers to the color's position on the color spectrum.

 SATURATION refers to the strength of the particular hue and the extent
 to which the strength is "diluted" by some proportion of white.

 VALUE refers to the amount of light a color reflects off a surface.

 COPY

 Use the COPY button to copy a color from your picture or the palette.
 Click the color you want to copy. 
 
 > Click COPY. TO appears attached to the cursor.

 > Click the slot in the requester into which you want to copy
   the new color.

 Use the EX button to exchange the positions of two colors in the palette.

 SPREAD

 SPREAD helps you quickly create a spread of shades between two colors. 

 > Select the 1st color from the palette. Click SPREAD. TO appears
   attached to the cursor.

 > Click the second color.

 PICK

 Use PICK to select a new foreground or background color for your palette. 
 
 > Click PICK. The pointer changes to an eye dropper cursor. Position the
   point of the eye dropper on the color you want to become the new
   foreground or background color.

 > Click to make the color you clicked on the new foreground color.
   Right-click to make it the new background color. To copy the new
   color into the palette, use COPY.

 DELETE

 Use DELETE to remove one or more colors from the color set.

 > Click a color you want to delete.

 > Click DELETE. TO appears attached to the cursor.

 > If you want to delete only one color, click on that color in the color
   set. The color will be deleted. If you want to delete more than 1
   color, a range for example, click the first color in the range; click
   DELETE; move the TO cursor to the last color in the range; and click
   the color. DPaint will delete all colors between the selected color in
   the sample color box and the color you clicked on.

 UNDO

 You can reverse the last change you made in the Color Mixer by clicking
 UNDO.

 REVERT

 You can clear the changes you made in the Color Mixer by clicking REVERT.

 COLOR MIXING AREA

 Use the mixing area to interactively mix colors to to create new ones,
 and, if you wish, add colors to your palette. You can use colors in the
 picture, colors from the palette, and colors you mix to create new
 shades. 

 CREATING A NEW COLOR

 You can create a new color in the Mixing Area in 2 basic ways:

 1. Mix a selected color in the Mixing Area with one or more selected
    colors. The resulting color can be a new color.

 2. Edit a color by adjusting its values with the RGB/HSV sliders.

    Here's a step-by-step example of how to select a color from the
    current picture, edit, it, mix it with another color, and add it
    to the palette.

 SELECTING A COLOR

 > With a picture on your screen and the Color Mixer exposed, click the
   PICK action button.

 > Move the PICK cursor to the picture and click on a color.

   The color you clicked on automatically becomes the current foreground
   color. It appears in the sample-color box, so you can paint with it
   immediately. The color slot of the new color appears indented in the
   color set. This color can be edited. To edit the color in the mixing
   area:

 > Drag one or more of the RGB/HSV sliders to change the color values,
   which changes the color itself.

 MIXING A COLOR

 > Click a medium sized built-in-brush and paint in the mixing area.
  
 > Choose another color, and paint over the first color in the mixing
   area. As you combine the two colors, new shades are created. You can
   repeat this step as often as you like.

 > When you have created a color you want to use, click the slot in the
   color set where you want to place the new color.

 > Click the PICK button; click the color in the mixing area to make
   that shaded the new color.

 CLEARING THE MIXING AREA

 > Select the color you want to clear the Mixing Area to.

 > Click COPY. TO appears attached to the cursor.

 > Click in the Mixing Area. It is clear to the color you selected.

 ARRANGE  Keyboard equivalent: P

 Show the Arrange requester. It displays all 256 colors of a Color Set.

 USE BRUSH PALETTE

 When you load a brush from disk, DPaint continues to use the current
 picture palette, even though it may be different from the one the
 brush was created with. Use Brush Palette to switch to the brush 
 palette.

 RESTORE PALETTE

 Returns you to the palette you were using before the current palette.

 DEFAULT PALETTE

 The default palette is the palette DPaint uses when you first start
 the program. 

 LOAD

 Load a palette that you have previously saved, without loading an 
 image.

 SAVE

 Save a palette without saving the image.
 
  Set
  "Color Set"

 LOAD

 Displays the Load Color Set requester. Load in the first requester, a
 second Load Color Set requester appears. This requester let you include
 which colors from the Color Set are to be loaded into the current color
 set. To select colors, click on them. The ALL button selects all colors
 and the NONE button selects all colors.

 After selecting the colors you want to load, you can either ADD them or
 OVERWRITE the current Color Set. If you choose add the colors are added
 beginning in the first empty slot of your current Color Set. If you
 choose OVERWRITE, the colors you have selected are inserted into your
 current Color Set beginning at color 0 and the new colors overwrite the
 previously existing colors.

 SAVE

 Saves a 256-color set as a separate file.
 
  BG
  "BG -> FG"

 Changes all pixels that use the current background color to use the
 current foreground color. This provides an easy method of changing
 colors globally--all pixels in the current background color in the
 picture are changed to the current foreground color. 
 
  FG
  "BG <-> FG"

 Swaps all pixels in the current background color with the current fore
 ground color. This is similar to the BG->FG option, except that the
 change occurs in both directions.
 
  Remap
  "Remap"

 When you create a picture, DPaint "remembers" each color on the screen
 by remembering its location in the palette. If a picture on the screen
 was created with a palette other than the current palette, Remap finds
 the locations in the current palette of the colors it used in the 
 original palette and tells the picture to look there for its colors.
 
  Recompute
  "Recompute"

 This option is available in HAM mode only. Choosing this option recom-
 putes the picture data by doing a remap with the current palette. If
 you have loaded a HAM image from a different program, Recompute may
 reduce the fringing effects you see when moving a brush across the
 screen.
 
  Bush
  "Brush"
 BRUSH  Use the options in the submenu to modify the current brush colors.
 
 BG->FG

 Changes all pixels in the brush that are in the current background color
 into the current foreground color. This provides an easy method of making
 a global color change. Because you can select any color in the brush as
 either the FG or BG color at any time, you can make intricate color
 changes easily. This operation affects the brush colors only and does not
 affect the picture or the order of colors in the palette.

 BG<->FG

 Swaps the current BG color in the brush with the current FG color. This
 is similar to the BG<->FG option, except that the change occurs in both
 directions. This change affects the brush colors only and does not affect
 the picture or the order of colors in the palette.

 REMAP

 Use Remap when you load a brush that uses a palette different from the
 current palette. Remap looks at the colors used in the brush and tries
 to find the closest fit within the current palette. This option is
 different from USE BRUSH PALETTE in that it does not change the picture
 palette. Instead it changes the palette locations the brush looks at its
 colors.

 CHANGE TRANSPARENCY  

 Lets you change the transparency of the currently selected brush to the
 current background color. The Effect menu contains several special
 features. Its options let you create "stencils", "freeze" the BG, and
 define planes for drawing in perspective.

  Stencil
  "Stencil"

 Creating a stencil allows you to paint around an image without painting
 on it, as though it were protected by a frisket. Create a stencil of an
 image in either of two ways (painting and locking), or by using both
 ways together. You can "paint" an area to mask, see PAINT, or "lock" 
 the colors that comprise that image.

 A stencil will also apply to the brush when it is captured. Whatever
 colors in the brush were locked when the stencil was made become
 transparent in the brush.

 When you have a stencil active, an "S" appears in the Title Bar.

 SHOW

 Show dims the colors in your picture and displays the stenciled areas
 of your picture (if any) in a contrasting lighter color. The "S" in the
 Title Bar changes to "s". You can't paint on your picture while SHOW
 is active. Click to return to your picture.

 MAKE  Keyboard equivalent: ~ (tilde, below Esc)

 This displays the Make Stencil requester. You can reposition the reques-
 ter anywhere on the screen by dragging the Title bar.

 To make a stencil:

 > Click the colors you want to use to create the stencil. You can select
   colors by clicking them in the requester's palette, by clicking colors
   in your picture, or by clicking colors in the main palette.

   When you have clicked all the colors you want to protect, click MAKE.
   The colors you select define a mask that protects an area from being
   painted over. The shape of the stencil is what is created and saved
   not the color information, which means you can change the colors of
   a "stenciled" shape, and still retain the stencil. If you have
   several animation frames, DPaint automatically remakes the stencil
   as you move from one frame to the next, either manually or while
   using the Move requester.

 CLEAR

 Clears the current color selections in the requester.

 INVERT

 Inverts the current color selections. This is useful if you want to mask
 more colors than you want to leave unmasked.

 When you are using HAM mode, your Make Stencil requester also contains
 a Show button, a Fine Tune button and a Tolerance edit field.

 Show toggles the show stencil function on and off. This works like the
 STENCIL>SHOW option in the Effect menu.

 FINE TUNE lets you add or subtract individual colors from the stencil.

 The TOLERANCE edit field lets you click on a single color in your pic-
 ture and simultaneously lock (or unlock) all "similar" colors in the
 image. The Tolerance number determines how different a color can be 
 and still be considered "similar" to the one you clicked on. A low
 Tolerance number requires that the colors be very similar, while a high
 Tolerance number requires that the colors may be very different from
 the color you clicked. The range of Tolerance values runs from 0 to 48.
 At 0 tolerance, only colors that are identical to the color you click
 on will be affected. At 48 tolerance, all colors will be affected.

 REMAKE

 When you have a stencil active and you apply colors to your picture,
 the colors you apply are not protected, even though they may be locked
 in the Make Stencil requester. You can lock newly applied colors by
 bringing up the Make Stencil requester and clicking MAKE, or by select-
 ing REMAKE from the Stencil submenu.

 If you have several animation frames and you make a stencil, DPaint
 automatically remakes the stencil as you move from one screen to the
 next.

 PAINT  Keyboard equivalent: CTRL-s

 Uses your current built-in or custom brush to paint the area you want
 stenciled. The image under the stencil will be displayed in a "half-tone"
 mode. When you've finished painting the stencil choose PAINT again to
 exit this mode and activate the stencil. Stencils you create using 
 Stencil Paint are "area-based" and apply only to the current picture or
 frame. Also, if you choose MAKE or REMAKE to create a "color-based" 
 stencil, your painted stencil is discarded.

 REVERSE

 Has the same effect as clicking Invert in the Make Stencil requester.

 ON/OFF Keyboard equivalent: ` (below Esc)

 Toggles the stencil on and off. This maintains the stencil but turns it
 off temporarily so you can paint on the protected colors.

 FREE

 Creating a stencil uses memory, even though you may have it turned off.
 Free deletes the stencil and deallocates the memory it was using.

 LOAD

 Stencils can be loaded as separate items. They are full screen only,
 and can be loaded only to the position they occupied when they were
 created. In other words, you cannot create a page larger than screen
 size and load the stencil into the middle of the page. The Load re-
 quester works like all other Load requesters in the program.

 When you load or save a stencil, you are loading or saving only a
 layer of data that indicates which pixels in your picture you can
 or cannot paint on. You are not loading settings for Make Stencil
 requester. In other words, stencils you load are area-based, like the
 stencils you create in the STENCIL>PAINT mode. Area-based stencils do
 not apply across animation frames and are replaced by color based
 stencils you subsequently create using the Make Stencil requester.
 
  LightTable
  "LightTable"

 ON/OFF Keyboard equivalent: l

 Turns the Lighttable on or off. The Lighttable lets you see the animation
 frames that immediately precede and/or immediately follow the current
 frame (or the spare page), which gives you greater control while creating
 your animation. This effect simulates the "onion skin" techniques used
 by traditional animation artists.

 The lighttabled frames appear behind the current image in the BG color
 area and can be dimmed to a darker color in all screen format in all
 screen format modes except HAM.

 MERGE 

 Merges all of the currently viewed images into the current frame, and
 turns off the Lighttable so you can see the result as it actually
 appears. You cannot UNDO this command.

 DIM    Keyboard equivalent: ALT-l

 When dim is on, all frames displayed on the Lighttable, except the current
 frame, appear dimmed. You can easily see at a glance which frame you are
 working on. Dim is on by default. This option applies to all screen
 format modes except HAM.

 TWO/BACK  
 
 Shows/hides/ the frame that is two back from the current frame in the
 lighttable. For example, if your current frame is number 3, then two
 back shows frame 1 on the Lighttable.

 PREVIOUS

 Shows/hides the frame immediately preceding the current frame in the
 Lighttable.

 NEXT

 Shows/hides the frame immediately following the current frame in the
 Lighttable.

 SPARE

 Shows/hides the scratch page in the Lighttable.
 
  Backg
  "Background"

 FIX

 Fixes the BG by "locking" the current palette. This allows you to draw
 on it without losing any of the background. You can erase any paint
 you apply after fixing the background by click CLR or by painting with
 the right mouse button.

 FREE

 This "unlocks" the background, and merges it with anything that was
 painted over it, so that clicking CLR will clear the entire picture.
 It also frees up the memory that was allocated to fixing the background.

 LOCK FG

 The Make Stencil requester lets you create stencils based on colors in
 the palette. By locking a color, you make it impossible to paint on
 that color, wherever it may be on the page. By using a combination of
 Fix Background and Lock FG, however, you can define a stencil by area
 rather than color. When you select Lock FG, you define as a stencil
 those areas on the page that you have painted since fixing the back-
 ground. regardless of the color of those areas.
 
  AntiAlias
  "Anti Alias"

 Anti-aliasing is a smoothing process which eliminates or reduces the
 jagged edges apparent in lines that aren't precisely vertical or
 horizontal. The effectiveness of anti-aliasing is dependent on the
 range of colors in the palette. For example, to draw a smooth,
 oblique black line on a white background, you'll need to have two
 intermediate shades of gray in the palette.

 Anti-aliasing works with straight and curved lines, and with filled and
 unfilled shapes. It is especially good at smoothing the jagged lines
 in a brush that result from rotating or shrinking it in Perspective mode.

 NONE,LOW,HIGH  Keyboard equivalent: ALT-/

 Set the level of anti-aliasing used on your brush when you paint. None
 is the default setting and applies no anti-aliasing. Low lets you eli-
 minate some of the jagged outline in your images and brushes. The cost
 of removing jagged lines is painting speed, but is still faster than
 smoothing out an image by hand.
 
  Process
  "Process"

 The effectiveness of the Process options is dependent on the colors
 available in the palette. DPaint combines your foreground color with
 the color in your image and then looks for the color in your palette
 that most closely matches the color it needs. For best results, your
 palette should contain a range of colors between the colors in the
 palette and the color you are using to tint. The Process options
 obviously give the best results in HAM mode because all 4096 colors
 are available for painting.

 You can combine Translucency with any of the Process options to increase
 your control over the effect of these options. For example, Hue would
 normally directly substitute the hue of your brush for the hues in
 your picture. If you turn on Translucency with a setting of 50%, instead
 of substituting the hue directly, the resulting hue will be a 50/50
 combination of the brush hue and the picture hue.

 ON/OFF  Keyboard equivalent: ALT-p

 When you choose PROCESS ON, a P appears in the middle of the title bar.
 
 TINT

 The color you are painting with tints the color(s) underneath it in the
 direction of the color you are applying. Use this option if you want to
 create a shading or tinting effect over a number of colors on the screen
 or to colorize a black and white or grayscale image.

 HUE

 Use this option with any painting tool to adjust the hue of a colored
 area of your image. This option is useful for converting a multi-
 colored image into a monochromatic image. Note that this option will
 have no effect on grayscale images because a color with no Saturation
 is gray regardless of its hue.

 VALUE

 Use this option to paint the Value of the current brush into the colors
 in the image. this is an effective way to create shading effects. If
 you choose a light color to paint with in Value mode, darker colors you
 paint on will become lighter. If you choose a dark color to paint with
 lighter colors will become darker.
 
  Translucency
  "Translucency

 ON/OFF Keyboard equivalent: ALT-t

 When you choose Translucency, a T appears in the middle of the Title
 bar. Painting with Translucency on has the effect of laying a trans-
 parency or colored filter over a portion of your picture. The trans-
 parency is tinted toward the current foreground color. The degree of
 tinting is determined by the level (percentage) set in the Translu-
 cency requester.

 SETTINGS Keyboard equivalent: CTRL-t

 Displays the Translucency requester. The default setting is 50%. To
 change the setting, click on either side of the slider, or drag the
 slider to a particular position. Click OK to confirm your new setting.

 Here's an example of how Translucency works. Let's say you have a red
 object in your painting with the RGB value R:15 (100%) G:0 B:0 and
 that blue (R:0 G:0 B:15 (100%)) is your foreground color. If you set
 the translucency level to 50% and painted over the red object, the
 resulting color would be equal to 50% of the object's color, red, and
 50% of the foreground color, blue. The RGB value of the resulting color
 is R:7(50%G:0B:7. If this color (purple) is not in the current palette
 the closest color to this value will be used instead. Like the Process
 functions, Translucency give the best results in HAM mode.

 The percentage value for translucency refers to the amount of the
 original object that will show through the newly applied foreground
 color. For instance, in the example if the translucency level was set
 to 75%, the resulting color would be 75% of the existing color in any
 painting, red, and 25% of the foreground color, blue. The RGB value of
 the resulting color would be R:11G:0B:3.

 Translucency works with all the painting tools (except text, single
 pixel airbrush, or the 3 and 5 pixel built-in-brushes, and in combi-
 nation with the PROCESS options. By combining Translucency with TINT,
 for example, you can control the degree of tinting.
 
  Perspect
  "Perspective"

 The Perspective submenu contains options for manipulating a brush in
 three dimensions.

 DO  Keyboard equivalent: Enter (on keypad)

 Puts you into Perspective mode. Your brush is represented by a four-cell
 matrix, which you can manipulate with keypad commands. The amount of
 rotation for axes x, y, and z is given in degrees on the right side of
 the Title bar. The center of perspective is indicated by a cross-hair.
 You can paint an image of the rotated brush at any time by clicking.

 FILLSCREEN  Keyboard equivalent: - (minus on keypad)

 Fills the screen with the current brush, in its current state of rota-
 tion in 3D. The entire brushsize (not just the opaque part) is the
 default size for the Perspective Fill pattern.

 RESET       Keyboard equivalent: 0 (on keypad)

 Resets the brush to its original state before rotation, and returns all
 of the settings in the Perspective Settings requester to their defaults.
 NOTE: The keyboard equivalent does not reset the perspective center.
 It is useful if you need to reset your brush to its original orienta-
 tion without changing your perspective plane.

 CENTER      Keyboard equivalent: . (period on keypad)

 Allows you to set the Perspective center or horizon in your perspective
 "landscape."

 When you select Center, you cursor changes into a large cross-hair. The
 smaller, stationary cross-hair on the screen indicates the existing
 center. Move the large cross-hair to the new center you want and click
 either mouse buttons.

 Once you have set the Perspective center, the position of the unrotated
 brush relative to that center determines the  position of the perspec-
 tive plane when you rotate the brush. The greater the distance above
 or below Perspective center, the less pronounced the perspective level.

 SETTINGS  

 Displays the Perspective requester. When you are in Perspective mode,
 you can also display this requester by right-clicking the Grid tool.
 The following options are available:

 GRID

 You can use these edit boxes to set the dimensions for a grid in three
 dimensional space. When you first open the requester, the numbers in
 these boxes correspond to the dimensions of your brush; the Z dimension
 automatically takes the same value as the Y dimension. It is important
 to remember that the entire brush size (not just the opaque part) is
 the default size for Perspective Grid and Perspective Fill.

 FROM BRUSH

 Clicking From Brush set the X and Y grid values to correspond to the
 width and height of the brush. this is the quickest way to restore
 the perspective grid settings to the same dimensions as your brush
 without affecting any other settings.

 ANGLE STEP

 Specifies the rotation increment used in conjunction with the Shift key
 and the appropriate keyboard rotation key. This value defaults to 90°.

 SCREEN

 The default setting, uses the screen coordinate system when rotating the
 brush on the X, Y, and Z axes.

 BRUSH

 Rotates the brush relative to the current brush coordinate system.

 DISPLAY

 The ANGLE and POS buttons lets you choose whether the menu bar displays
 the angle of rotation or the position of the brush in three dimensional
 space. If COORDS from the Prefs menu is chosen, the Title bar shows 2
 dimensional coordinates. If you want to see 3 dimensional coordinates,
 turn off COORDS in the Prefs menu.

  Coords
  "Coords"


 COORDS  Keyboard equivalent: SHIFT-\

 This option turns on the coordinate display in the upper right-hand
 portion of the Title Bar. Simply moving the mouse displays the current
 position of the cursor, with the origin (0,0) set to the lower left
 corner of the screen. Holding down either mouse button temporarily re-
 sets the origin to the current cursor position and displays the dis-
 placement value from that temporary origin as you move around the
 screen. The readout is scaled in pixels.
 
  Fast FB
  "Fast FB"


 FAST FB

 Fast feedback. Turn on Fast FB when working with a large or complicated
 brushes while using the line or unfilled shape tools. Fast FB lets
 you draw your lines or shapes using the smallest (one-pixel) brush for
 feedback, and then completes the design using the currently selected
 brush. This increases response speed while you are drawing, but does
 not  affect the final image.
 
  Multicycle
  "Multicycle"


 MULTICYCLE

 Works in conjunction with the CYCLE paint mode from the Mode Menu.
 With MULTICYCLE turned on, painting with a multicolored brush in
 CYCLE mode cycles each color in the brush, provided the colors in a
 cycle range. When MULTICYCLE is turned off, using CYCLE with a multi-
 colored brush treats the brush as though it were a single color.
 
  Be Square
  "Be Square"


 BE SQUARE

 Because the Amiga's pixels are not perfectly square, circles and
 squares drawn with the shape tools are not perfectly round or square.
 If you wish to draw "true" circles or squares, select Be Square. This
 will square all the built-in-brushes, the appropriate shape tools,
 and symmetry. Be Square does not square gridding or perspective, and
 should be turned off when you are using those features.
 
  Workbench
  "Workbench"


 WORKBENCH

 Toggles the Amiga Workbench on and off. 
 
  Exclbrush
  "ExclBrush"


 EXCLBRUSH

 If you pick up a brush with ExclBrush (and the Grid) selected, you
 will exclude a one-pixel border on the right and bottom edges of
 your brush. This is useful if your brush has a colored border around
 it and you want to use the brush to create a pattern fill or perspec-
 tive fill. When DPaint creates your pattern, the border will be uniform
 throughout instead of being twice as wide where one copy of the brush
 is placed next to another.
 
  Autotransp
  "AutoTransp"


 AUTOTRANSP

 Modifies the way brush pickup works. With AutoTransp turned on, DPaint
 determines the transparent color by looking at the corners of the cap-
 tured rectangle or the points of the polygon to see if they are the
 same color. If the four corners are the same, color, that color becomes
 the transparent color, otherwise the current background color remains
 the transparent color.
 
  No Icons
  "No Icons"


 NOICONS

 When No Icons is on, your files are saved without the icon "info" 
 files. This option is useful if you don't ever expect to launch an
 application by double-clicking on a picture file. Saving without the
 icons saves space on your disks.
 
  Autogrid
  "AutoGrid"


 AUTOGRID

 With AutoGrid turned on, the perspective grid is resized automatically
 to match any custom brush you choose to load or pick up. It's as if you
 had clicked the From Brush action button in the Perspective requester.
 When AutoGrid is off, the perspective grid is not automatically resized.
 
  OriginUL
  "OriginUL"


 ORIGINUL

 When COORDS from the Prefs menu is on, DPaint displays the current posi-
 tion of the cursor on the right side of the Title Bar. By default the
 program calculates the origin; or zero point of coordinates (0,0) of
 the cursor position from the lower left corner of the screen. If you
 would rather have the origin calculated from the upper left, choose
 OriginUL. To return to the default origin, choose OriginUL again.
 
  FastAdjust
  "FastAdjust"


 FASTADJUST

 This option is available only in HAM mode, where it is turned on by
 default. FastAdjust tells DPaint NOT to attempt to correct the fringing
 effects that appear along the right side of your brush while the brush
 is moving. This improves the speed of brush movement and especially 
 helpful if you are using large custom brushes. If you find the fringing
 to be annoying or difficult to work with, turn FastAdjust off, and the
 fringing will be reduces.
