Ok well I'm no craker and my name is probably like an ant compared to 
the Grates such as IBM and FFC but I just thougt some people might 
like to know how to edit the roster in Gunship 2000...


This is what I'v figured out.....


The Codes in the Light green box 
02020202 020200202   These represent how many And what meddles you 
have.....

The Code the the Dark Green Box
0900 This represents your rank...

The Code in the Yellow box
100 this represents you status i.e. Active inactive dead shit like    
that. All you have to know is that ...100... = Active...



If you figure anything else out leave me a message on Beyond Paridise 
at +212-888-4773 in the USA... Cool ok   

Xelsed out.


GS2000 Amiga V3.01
==================

This file contains late breaking information essential to the play of
Gunship 2000.


Deep Strike Mission

To end a deep strike mission you must fly over the yellow line at the edge of
the map. Carry on until you reach the edge of the map and you will be 
prompted to end the mission.
If it was a wingman mission you should ensure your wingmen have either
exited the arena or are exiting in your formation. If you are prompted
to end the mission and there are still active members of your unit on the
map, just answer no (N) and you will be given the opportunity to command
the members of your unit who are still in the arena.

Never Write protect your playing copies of GS2000 as the program needs
to save the roster information to your disks.

If you receive a file error while playing GS2000 do not worry this just
means Amiga DOS has failed to read a file. The program will exit and need
to be reloaded to carry on playing. If this problem persists re-copy your
disks from the originals (remember to never run from the original disks).

Bases and Wingmen
Wingmen have to be instructed to land at bases by use of the B-key. If you
wish them to land at a FARP press the B-key twice.
