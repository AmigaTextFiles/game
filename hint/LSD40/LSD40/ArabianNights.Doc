LOADING THE GAME

Switch on your Amiga and insert the game disk.  After a short while a 
loading screen will appear shortly follwed by the main game screen.

INTRODUCTION

The sky was bright, the birds were chirping and the beautiful princess
Leila was on the balcony.  Not that you should be standing around all
day, no, you have work to do and the job of Chief Gardener's Assistant
Helper 2nd Class is a tough one.

Weeds to weed, plants to plant and brushes to erm, trim.  But how can
you work when princess Leila is high on the balcony, fending off a
huge winged demon.  Ah, how cute... wait a minute, a DEMON?!?.  Within
seconds you are scaling the palace walls to rescue your love.  Heights
weren't always your best subject but you can worry about falling later.
You have to rescue Leila.

You reach the top just as the demon begins flight, carrying Leila.  A
valiant leap later and you're hanging by the demon's feet.  It dives and
screeches but you refuse to let go.  Until the demon swipes it's other
foot at you and you are thrown groundwards.  After a few minutes of 
blackness you hear the palace guard, something about it all being your 
fault and how a life sentence in the dungeon would sort you out... 

INSTRUCTIONS

Your first problem is being locked up in the palace dungeons, but i'm 
sure that it wont take you long to figure out how to escape.  Once
that is sorted you've got toscue the princess to prove your innocence
Now, even though i'm sure the evil Vizier is on the nice side  of
cunning, evil, cheating and nasty, i don't think he will take all this
lying down, no, pitted against you are all his minions and four mean
Djinnis.  Good luck...

CONTROL

There are two options open to you on the Title Page.  They are `START'
and `OPTIONS'.  The options screen allows you to alter the difficulty
level at which the game will play.  Also on the options screen is the
Music Test and the Detail Level (For more information on this feature
read the section titled Expanded hardware).  To begin the game, simply
select `START'.  The game will proceed to load.

If you leave the Title Page for a while, the game will begin  running
a demo.  When the game is loaded for the first time, the demo will
simply be of the first level.  Each game after that, the demo will show
the player's exploits.  Every mistake and slip up...

There are several different control methods for each of the seperate
game styles.  All levels can be controlled by keys or joystick.  Arabian
Nights also allows for the use of two button joystick such as a 
megadrive joy pad.

The different control methods are:-

`Select' button is either 2nd fire button or <SPACE>
`Action' button is either 1st fire button or <RETURN>

It is necessary to combine moves to complete the game, such as attacking
with your sword while jumping to attack in mid air and running then
ducking to slide under obstructions.  Try them...

STATUS

While a lot of action will be going on in the centre of the screen, the
side panel and top panel also contain useful information.  The side panel
is on the bottom left-hand side of the screen and shows your lives and 
energy is represented by full bars and lost energy is shown as empty grey
bars.  The number of bars shown is how much energy points you can have.
It is possible to replenish energy with some energy pots and you can also
increase your total energy by collecting the magical amulets.  Lives can
be increased as well if you're lucky.

The top panel contains what you are holding and the score.  Each of your
hands are shown on the panel along with what you are holding.  Usable 
items appear in your left hand while weapons in the right.  These can be
changed in your inventory.

There is a special case on the mine cart level where your hands are not 
shown and neither is your score.  Instead you are given a little piece of
text to tell you who is in front as well as a timer.

INVENTORY

While playing Arabian nights, you will discover objects which may
prove useful for puzzles later in the game.  All of these items will be
kept in your inventory.

To bring up your inventory either tap the space bar or if you are using
a two button joystcik, press the second button.  To exit the inventory
tap the `select` button again.

The main area of the Inventory consists of the items you are carrying
A little picture of the item will be shown and can be selected by
pressing the f button.  If you have more than one of any items, a
number will be shown next to it.

On the right of this area is the health meter from the game screen.
When you use energy pots, you will see the effect othis screen.
Below this is what you are currently using.  Next to this is the
currency for this level and how much you have collected so far.  The
currency may be needed for certain puzzles in the game.  The more
you collect, the greater the bonus at the end of each level also.

There are two ways of collecting items.  You can either be given them
by talking to the different characters in the game or find them in the
treasure chests on each level.

Once you open a chest by touching it, it will open and a swirl ball
of energy will come out.  When you collect it you will be informed
what you have found.  Now, you can either use the item straight away
by pressing the `Action` button.  Or you can store it in your inventory
by tapping the `Select' button.  Some items are used straight away
such as extra lives and power-ups.

When you enter the inventory, you will be controlling a small red
box.  Move this box to the item you wish to use and then press the
`Action' button.  To exit the inventory, press the `Select' button.

Here's a small selection of objects you will probably find during
the game.

-> KEY IN A SQUARE <- Very useful for potential escapes.  the dungeon
                      key!

-> YING YANG AMULATE <- Mystical amulets give you more potential
                        energy bars.

-> BEND EDGE SWORD <- Hack and Slash away with your basic sword...

-> SWORD <- ...But this one fires projectiles!

CUSTOMS

Once a level has been completed, you will be taken to the Arabian
customs offices.  Collecting currency and items from each of the
levels attracts the attention of the officals and they want to speak
to you.  Don't worry, they are always fair.  Bonus points are given
for items they take.

This is where the bonus points are awarded for the mine cart level.

COMBAT

To rid the world of the evil crazed minions of the Vizier, you must
master sword play.  To attack, simply get as close as possible to
your `Victim' and press the `Action' button.  If you timed it right
the enemy will lose an energy point and perhaps, their life!

Power-ups are also available.  These enable you to fire projectiles
from your sword making it easier to attack.

The enemy energy bars will appear above yours and the enemy will
die once they are depleted.  Although, if the enemy hits you, or
you land on a spike etc.  You will lose an energy bar.  If you 
only have one left, it will flash to make it easier to spot.  Lose
all your bars and you die.  Remember to store those energy pots
for later when you really need them.

ENEMIES

Not all the creatures who attack you can help themselves.  Most are
under the influence of the Vizier's evil spells.  OK, alot of them
just don't like you but a few have resisted the spells and will
try and help you.  Don't expect help straight away though, some
may require you to help them.

KEYS

Unless you have the build of a 20st wrestler, locked doors can
cause problems.  Luckily doors with locks must have keys so all
you have to do is find them.  Remember though, not all doors can
be opened with the same key.  Use keys in the same fashion as you
would any object, select them from your inventory.

MONEY

In each of the levels you will find some form of currency.  
though it is not always coins, the inhabitants will always be a
bit happier to co-operate when money is involved.  The current
(!) is shown on your inventory screen.  When the level is complete
you will be given a bonus score for all surplus money so remember
to collect as much as possible!

PUZZLE

To complete the game you must complete some of the puzzles in the
game.  this sometimes involves bringing items to people, collecting
money or trading items.  It is important to remember what tasks
you were set while playing the game.

Some parts of the game are automated.  this means the computer will
take over control of your hero.  Don't worry, it's not going to 
lead him into a pit of spikes, just carry out a simple action.

If you find the puzzle a bit too hard, here's a couple of tips
There are lots of jewels all around the level but not at all of
them are easy to get.  Try going down holes in the wall to
reveal secret rooms.  Check everything and explore everywhere!

IDEAS

While running through a level, a light bulb might pop up above your
head and start flashing.  Don't worry!  Its the game's way of giving
you a hand.  They signify something out of the ordinary, a thought
or something you've heard.  To read those ideas, wait until they
are flashing then press the `Select' button.  Read them carlly
as they can be very useful.

GUARDIANS

The main line of defence for the Vizier is the four elemental
Djinnis.  They are Earth, Water, Wing and Fire.  Each has attacks 
associated with the element it controls and will use them to stop
you from progressing.  Your only chance is to defeat them in their
lairs.  Usually, you find each of the Djinnis at the end of certain
levels.  the levels mirror the Djin in it, so be cautious when 
travelling through a level.

TELEPORTS

One method of travelling around without using any boot leather is
to use the magical teleports.  Step into one here and pop out 
somewhere else, as easy as that.  Teleports are usually hidden
inside things.  On the first level these are big painted pots.
The rest of them, you will find yourself.  Remember, not all the
teleports are two-way so think carefully before stepping in.

SCORING

With so much to do in Arabian Nights, you can expect to attain a 
big score.  You are awarded scores for all sorts of different things
Disposing of an enemy will give you points and so will collecting
currency, completing tasks and finishing levels.

The mine cart level is a special case where you will be given 
points for finishing first, your time remaining and finishing
inside your cart.  There is also a special secret bonus but you
will have to find that yourself!

LOSING A LIFE

Eventually, rabid bird attacks, spike wounds and acid baths may
cause you to lose a life.  When this happens ypur life counter
will go down and you will begin the level again.  But dont' worry
you wont need to start the level from the start.  You will be
placed in a safe spot where you have already been.  This may be 
a couple of screens away from where you died.

For a few seconds after starting on a new life you will be invulnerable
to help you get away.  This is shown by your hero flashing.  When the
flashing stops, you will be able to be hit again.

If you manage to lose all your lives the game will end and return to
the title page.  Dont worry, try again, imsure you'll do better next
time

EXPANDED HARDWARE

If you are playing Arabian Nights on a machine with a faster processor
or extra memory, you will benefit in the game.  With a faster
processor, you will be given more action on screen.  More detail
will be assigned to the levels.  With more memory the game stores
the levels.  If memory all, the whole game can be kept in memory
cutting down on disk access.  With a little extra memory some
recently played sections will be stored.

 groundwards.  After a few minutes of blackness you hear the palace guard, 
 something about it all being your fault and how a life sentence in the

 INSTRUCTIONS

 Your first problem is being locked up in the palace dungeons, but I'm sure 
 that it won't take you to long to figure out how to escape.  Once that is 
 sorted you've got to rescue the princess to prove your innocence.  Now, even
 though I'm sure the evil Vizier is on the nice side of cunning, evil, 
 cheating and nasty, I don't think he will take all this lying down, no, 
 pitted against you are all his minions and four mean Djinnis.  Good luck..

 CONTROL

 The top panel contains what you are holding and the score.  Each of your 
 hands are shown on the panel along with what you are holding.  Usable items
 appear in your left hand while weapons in the right.  These can be changed 
 in your inventory.

 There is a special case on the mine cart level where your hands are not 
 shown and neither is your score.  Instead you are given a little piece of 
 text to tell you who is in front as well as a timer.

 INVENTORY
 ---------

 While playing Arabian Nights, you will discover objects which may prove
 useful for puzzles later in the game.  All of these items will be kept in 
 your inventory.

 To bring up your inventory either tap the space bar or if you are using a 
 2-button joystick, press the second button.  To Exit the inventory tap the
 'SELECT' button again.

 The main area of the Inventory consists of the items you are carrying.  A
 little picture of the item will be shown and can be selected by pressing the
 fire button.  If you have more than one of any item, a number will be shown
 next to it.

 On the right of this area is the health meter from the game screen.  When
 you use energy pots, you will see the effect on this screen.  Below this is
 what you are currently using.  Next to this is the currency for this level  
 and how much you have collected so far.  The currency may be needed for 
 certain puzzles in the game.  The more you collect, the greater the bonus at
 the end of each level also.

 There are two ways of collecting items.  You can either be given them by 
 talking to the different characters in the game or find them in the treasure
 chests on each level.


 ----------------------------------6----------------------------------------

 Once you open a chest by touching it, it will open and a swirl ball of energy 
 will come out.  When you collect it will be informed what you have found.  
 Now, you can either use the item straight away by pressing the 'ACTION' 
 button.  Or you can store it in your inventory by tapping the 'SELECT' 
 button.  Some items are used straight away such as extra lives and powerups.

 When you enter the inventory, you will be controlling a small red box.  Move
 this box to the item you wish to use and then press the 'ACTION' button.  To
 exit the inventory, press the 'SELECT' button.

 Here is a small selection of objects you will probably find during the game.
 

 KEY  -  Very useful for potential escapes.  The dungeon key!

 LITTLE POT  -  An energy pot.  This will give you back 1 energy bar.

 MEDIUM POT  -  Less common, this pot gives you 2 energy bars back.

 LARGE POT  -  Very rare.  A full 3 energy bars can be gained with this.

 AMULET  -  Mystical amulets give you more potential energy bars.

 SWORD  -  Hack and Slash away with your basic sword...

 SWORD WITH FIRE-BALLS  -  ...But this one fires projectiles!

 MAGIC LAMPS  -  Search out these beauties, you'll need them!

 
 ----------------------------------7----------------------------------------

 CUSTOMS
 -------

 Once each level has been completed, you will be taken to the Arabian customs
 offices.  Collecting currency and items from each of the levels attracts the
 attention of the officials and they want to speak to you.  Don't worry, they
 won't take anything off you that you will need and they are always fair.
 Bonus points are given for items they take.

 This is where the bonus points are awarded for the mine cart level.

 COMBAT
 ------

 To rid the world of the evil crazed minions of the Vizier, you must master
 sword play.  To attack, simply get close as possible to your 'victim' and
 press the 'ACTION' button.  If you timed it right, the enemy will lose an
 energy point and perhaps, their life!

 Power-ups are also available.  These enable you to fire projectiles from 
 your sword making it easier to attack.

 The enemy bars will appear above yours and the enemy will die once they are
 depleted.  Although, if the enemy hits you, or you land on a spike etc.  You
 will lose an energy bar.  If you only have one left, it will flash to make it
 easier to spot.  Loose all your bars and you die.  Remember to store those 
 extra energy pots for later when you really need them.

 ENEMIES
 -------

 Not all the creatures who attack you can help themselves.  Most are under 
 the influence of the Vizier's evil spells.  OK, a lot of them just don't 
 like you but a few have resisted the spells and will try to help you.  Don't
 expect help straight away though, some may require you to help them.

 KEYS
 ----

 Unless you have the build of a 20st wrestler, locked doors can cause pro-
 blems.  Luckily doors with locks must have keys so all you have to do is 
 find them.  Remember though, not all doors can be opened with the same key.
 Use the keys in the same fashion as you would any object, select them from
 your inventory.

 MONEY
 -----

 In each of the levels you will find some form of currency.  Though it's not
 always coins, the inhabitants will always be a 


 ----------------------------------8----------------------------------------

 bit happier to co-operate when money is involved.  The current currency (!)
 is shown on your inventory screen.  When the level is complete, you will be
 given a bonus score for all surplus money so remember to collect as much as
 possible!

 PUZZLES
 -------

 To complete the game you must complete some of the puzzles in the game.  
 This sometimes involves bringing items to people, collecting money or
 trading items.  It is important to remember what tasks  you were set while
 playing the game.

 Some parts of the game automated.  This means the computer will take over
 the control of your hero.  Don't worry, it's not going to lead him into a 
 pit of spikes, just to carry out a simple action.

 If you find the first puzzle a bit to hard, here is a couple of tips.  There
 are lots of jewels all around  the but not all of them are easy to get.  Try
 going down holes in the wall to reveal secret rooms.  Check everything and
 explore everywhere!!

 IDEAS
 -----

 While running through a level, a light bulb might pop up above your head 
 and start flashing.  Don't worry!  It's the games way of giving you a help-
 ing hand.  The signify something out of the ordinary, a though or something
 you've heard.  To read these ideas, wait until they are flashing then press
 the 'SELECT' button.  Read them carefully as they can be very useful.

 GUARDIANS 
 ---------

 The main line of defence for the Vizier is the four elemental Djinnis.
 They are Earth, Water, Fire and Wind.  Each has attacks associated with the
 element it controls and will use them to


 ----------------------------------9----------------------------------------

 Stop you from progressing.  Your only chance is to defeat them in their 
 lairs.  Usually, to find each of the Djinnis at the end of  certain levels.
 The levels mirror of Djin in it, so be cautious when travelling through a 
 level.

 TELEPORTS
 ---------

 One method of travelling around without using any boot leather is to use 
 magical teleports.  Step into one here and pop out somewhere else, as easy
 as that.  Teleports are usually hidden inside things.  On the first level 
 these are big painted pot.  The rest of them, you will have to find
 yourself.  Remember, not all the teleports are two-way so think carefully
 before stepping in.

 SCORING
 -------

 With so much to do in Arabian Nights, you can expect to attain a big score.
 You are awarded scores for all sorts of different things.  Disposing of an
 enemy will give you points and so will collecting currency, completing tasks
 and finishing levels.

 The mine cart level is a special case where you will be given points for 
 finishing first, your time remaining and finishing inside your cart.  There
 is also a special secret bonus but you will have to find them yourself!

 LOSING A LIFE
 -------------

 Eventually, rabid bird attacks, spike wounds and acid baths may cause you 
 to lose a life.  When this happens your life counter will go down and you 
 will begin the level again.  But don't worry, you won't need to start the 
 level from the start.  You will be placed in a safe spot where you have 
 already been.  This may be a couple of screens away from where you died.

 For a few seconds after starting on a new life you will be invulnerable to 
 help you get away.  This is shown by your hero flashing.  When the flashing 
 stops, you will be able to be hit again.

 If you manage to lose all your lives the game will end and return to the
 title page.  Don't worry, try again, I'm sure you'll do better next time.

 EXPANDED HARDWARE
 -----------------

 If you are playing Arabian Nights on a machine with a faster processor or
 extra memory, you will benefit in the game.  With a faster processor, you
 will be given more action on the screen.  More detail will be assigned to 
 the levels.  With more memory the game stores the levels If memory allows, 
 the whole game can be kept in memory cutting down on disk access.  With a 
 little extra memory some recently played sections will be stored.
