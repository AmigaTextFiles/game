                  KGB - THE FULL SOLUTION BY DANIEL PLATT
                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 This is the complete solution to KGB released by Virgin Interactive
Entertainment, as sent in to Amiga Format by myself. There is probably very
little difference between this and the solution which Amiga Format printed
(in issues AF90, AF91 and AF92). The reason there may be some changes is
that not long after I sent the solution in, I had a bit of a problem with
my hard drive and lost the original solution along with some other stuff.
I've compared this with the one printed and it is almost the same.
 Just before you start reading the solution, there are a few things you
need to know. Firstly, when you are talking to someone in the game and the
solution says for example 3rd, 2nd 1st, then that means you should select
the 3rd reply then the second and finally the first. If you don't quite
understand what I've just said (and I'm not sure I do ;) then don't woory
about it, it will become clear when you are playing the game. 
 Secondly, there is a section in Chapter 4 where you have to go through the
right door. The best thing to do is to save the game before you go through a
door, and then if it is the wrong door just load the saved game and try
again.
 Finally, if you want to try and make any sense of the plot and what
happens, then have a pen and paper ready and make a note of every major
thing you find out, as it will help you to understand what has happened at
the end of the game.
 Right, enough of me rambling on, on with the solution.....

 About the author of the solution

 In case you haven't already found out, my name is Daniel Platt and at the
time of writing (21st March 1997), I'm a 17 year old student doing my
A-Levels in Liverpool, England. My preferred music artists are :- R.E.M.,
Beck, Ash, The Prodigy and some Oasis songs. I worked on completing the
game between February  to April 1995 (I lost interest after this for a
while) and March 1996 to about August 1996.
 My current Amiga setup is : unexpanded A1200 with a 85MB hard drive
 Hopefully, if I manage to get to WOA in May in London, my setup after WOA
will be A1200 with '030 accelerator, 8 or 16MB fast RAM (I haven't decided
which yet) and a bloody big hard drive.
 For those wondering, it has been uploaded from a cybercafe (Internet cafe,
whatever you want to call them).
 If, for some reason, you feel extremely grateful to me then an e-mail would
be nice just to let me know that my effort has been appreciated. If you 
feel grateful to the extent that you want to send me something useful
:) (cash, R.E.M. singles, any spare 1Gb hard drives or A4000's lying around),
then e-mail me at daplatt@hotmail.com. I'm currently up to my eyeballs in 
studies etc. but I will try and reply to any mails you send.
 
 I hope you found this solution useful and that it may just stop you from
going involuntarily bald.
