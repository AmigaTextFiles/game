                         DE LUXE PAINT IV FULL DOCS !!!

                      COMPOSED  FOR  YOU  BY AlienX/Agnøstic Frønt

                         PART I : THE PULLDOWN MENU

                        LOAD PICTURE (Picture Menu)

KEYBOARD = Right Amiga L

This displays the LOAD PICTURE requester which allows you to load a picture
or sequence of pictures.

The first time you select Load from the Picture menu, the file requester
will display all of the available devices <DEV> and volumes <VOL> on your
system. Devices are the physical drives that you have attached (floppy,
harddrive or ramdrive). Volumes refer to the names that have been assigned
to devices. For instance you may have named a harddrive partition as "Work"
or "Graphics". Additionally, since the contents of a floppy drive changes
whenever you insert a different disk, a volume name is used to refer to
a particular floppy disk.

The file requester is used to enter a path to a specific file. Simply click
on the appropriate names in the requester to build a path to the desired
file. Your current path selection will appear within the Drawer field. When
you click on a file name rather than a disk or drawer name, the name is
displayed within the File field. 

The DRIVES button displays all physical drive units attached to your
system. These are the hardware names, such as DF0:, DH0:, RAM:, etc.

The ASSIGNS button will list all of the current logical assignments in your
system. These are names that have been added using the AmigaDOS ASSIGN
command and include any of the standard system assignments such as, C:,
LIBS:, DEVS:, FONTS:, ... etc.

The Pattern field lets you enter a "wildcard" pattern.  This allows you to
filter out the list so that it only displays file names that match a
particular pattern.  For most purposes the standard pattern is:

                                    #?

Entering this into the Pattern field will list all files in a directory. It
has the same effect as entering no pattern into the Pattern field.

                                  #?.pic 

This pattern will display only those files that have .pic at the end of
their name.

                                   Pic#?

This lists only files whose names start with Pic.

                                 Pic#?.pic

List only files that start with Pic and end with .pic.

(#?  is the basic AmigaDOS wildcard pattern, please refer to your AmigaDOS
manual - or "The Buddy System for AmigaDOS", for more info on Pattern
Matching).

NOTE:  The above functions of this file requester are also found in the
requesters used when loading brushes, animbrushes, palettes, stencils,
moves and animations (through other menu selections).

The "# of Frames" edit field of the requester allows you to load multiple
picture files to build an animation.  All pictures being loaded this way
have to be in the same format (same screen resolution and # of colors).  If
animation frames already exist they will be replaced by the newly loaded
picture files.  DPaint proceeds by loading pictures alphabetically starting
from the selected picture name and going down the list for the requested
number of frames.


**********************************************************************
                         SAVE PICTURE (Picture Menu)
**********************************************************************


KEYBOARD = Right Amiga S

This allows you to save a picture or sequence of pictures.


Saving a picture stores all of its attributes as well -- The palette,
stencil and perspective information is reloaded along with a picture.

If you have created multiple frames of animation, the requester will allow
you to specify which frame or group of frames to save.  These frames are
then saved as separate pictures with a corresponding number automatically
added to the end of the file name. For example if you specify as a File
name, 
                                   AnimPic

Then, DPaint will save the animation frames that you specify into the
specified directory as, AnimPic001, AnimPic002, AnimPic003, ..., etc.

It's a good idea to use extensions for all Saving processes to help
distinguish between the different types of files that DPaint works with:

         .anib      for animbrushes, 
         .anim      for animations,
         .pic       for pictures
         .br        for brushes
         .move      for move requester settings
         .pal       for palettes
         .cs        for color sets
         .sten      for stencils

Of course, these are just suggested extensions. You should use extensions
that will best help you keep your files organized.


**********************************************************************
                       DELETE PICTURE (Picture Menu)
**********************************************************************


KEYBOARD = Right Amiga D

The "Delete Picture" requester is displayed.  This allows you to delete any
file from a floppy disk, harddrive, or RAM directory (Drawer) without
leaving the program.


This function is not limited to DeluxePaint pictures.  Anything that can be
selected from the Delete requester can be deleted.  This is useful for
deleting files on a disk if space is needed.

                    * USE THIS FUNCTION WITH CAUTION! *


************************************************************************
                       PRINT PICTURE (Picture Menu)
************************************************************************


KEYBOARD = Right Amiga P

The "Print Picture" requester is displayed.  This allows you to print the
currently displayed picture screen.  Make sure that the correct printer
driver and other options from the Workbench Preferences are selected. Also,
verify that the printer is connected and ready to print before selecting
this function.


The print requester allows you to select from the following options:

Aspect:   lets you print a picture normally (the arrow pointing up), using
          the width of the paper, or sideways, along the length of the
          paper.

Image:    specifies a positive (+) or negative (-) image.

Shade:    specifies a black & white, grey-shaded or color printout.

Placement:  specifies printing along the left margin or centered on the
            paper page.

% or Dots:  specifies the size of the printout.  The % option allows you to
          enter the %Wide and %High while the Dots option lets you
          enter the size as the number of printer pixels. In effect, this
          adjusts the density or resolution of the printout.

          SEE -> `Page Size` for additional info

          NOTE: if you leave the %High value at 0 - the correct value will
                automatically be used to match the value used for %Wide.

Line Feeds:  specifies the number of line feeds inserted after a picture is
          printed to allow you to print two pictures on the same page with
          a specified amount of space between them.

Copies:   specifies the number of copies you want printed.

Form Feed: specifies whether or not you want the printer to advance to the
          next sheet of paper after printing a picture.

Cancel:   allows you to abandon the print function as well as any of the
          current print settings you may have made.

Exit:     allows you to abandon the print function but save all the current
          print settings for a later time.


************************************************************************
                        FLIP PICTURE (Picture Menu)
************************************************************************


This allows you to flip an entire picture about its x (Horizontally)
or y (Vertically) axis.  If multiple frames exist, you can select one, a
range of frames, or all frames of your animation to flip.

SEE ALSO ->    `FLIP BRUSH`


************************************************************************
                         PAGE SIZE (Picture Menu)
************************************************************************


This displays the "Page Size" requester which allows you to specify the
height and width of the page in pixels.  A Standard page size is always
equal to the current screen resolution.  You can create pages that are
larger than the actual screen display.  These types of images are known as
"SuperBitmaps".


The standard page sizes are:

Lo-Res     320 x 200
Med-Res    640 x 200
Interlace  320 x 400
Hi-Res     640 x 400  

Even though standard Amiga monitors can only display up to limited
resolutions, you can specify any page size up to that which your available
memory will allow.  This is primarily used for printing applications.  For
example, many of today's printers have a high resolution specified as the
number of dots per inch (dpi).  Laser Printers usually have a 300 by 300
dpi resolution.  So, if each pixel is printed as a dot on the printer, and
you printed a Lo-Res 320x200 pixel screen, the image would take up less
than a square inch on the paper.  In order to edit an image that would take
up a full 8 inches on a paper then, you would need to have a page size of
2400 in Width (since there's 300 dots, or pixels, per inch, 8 inches works
out as, 8 x 300 = 2400 dots!).  The corresponding Height value controls how
high the image will be - remember 300 dots for every inch.  Of course, the
limitation to Page Size is the amount of memory you have in your system.

NOTE: In order to print your image at the printer's resolution, make sure
     you select "Dots" from the Print requester and enter the height and 
     width values of the image as values for the requester. Also adjust
     the density setting for graphics printing from Workbench Preferences.
     (See your AmigaDOS manual.)

     SEE -> `PRINT PICTURE` for additional details on printing.

FULL PAGE allows you to create an image with the same aspect ratio as a
     a standard printed page (8.5" x 11").

OVERSCAN allows you to create an image which will fill the entire screen so
     that there are no visible borders when the image is output as a video
     signal.  The three options:  Standard, Full- Page, and Overscan, have
     preset values according to the current screen resolution.  Other
     values can be specified by typing directly into the Width or Height
     edit fields.

     NOTE: You must also select an overscan setting, either Standard or Max
           Overscan, from the `Screen Format` requester in order to display
           an image in overscan. Otherwise you will just have an overscan 
           sized page displayed within a standard screen. For minimal 
           memory systems, editing an overscan screen within a standard
           screen does not require as much memory as editing with an actual
           overscan display. 

Page Scrolling

You can move around to different areas of an oversized page by using the
cursor keys or the 'n' (centering) key.

SEE ALSO -> `SHOW PAGE`

***********************************************************************
                         SHOW PAGE (Picture Menu)
***********************************************************************


When working with a page that is larger than the current screen size, This
option allows you to view an image of the entire page.  The page is reduced
so that it will fit within the size of the current screen.  This allows you
to get a visual layout of the page. A flashing box outline is displayed to
indicate which area of the page you are currently working on. You can move
this box around the page (using the mouse or cursor keys) to work on
another area. Pressing any other key or releasing the mouse button will
return you to the editing screen at the new position.

SEE -> `PAGE SIZE`


***********************************************************************
                       SCREEN FORMAT (Picture Menu)
***********************************************************************


This displays the "Screen Format" requester which allows you to select the
number of screen colors and resolution.


LO-RES:  The DEFAULT screen size, gives you a screen that is 320 pixel wide
     by 200 pixels high, with a maximum of 4096 colors (in HAM mode).  If
     your Amiga supports Extra-Halfbrite (All A500s & A2000s and SOME
     A1000s - Check with your dealer or service-center), you can display a
     maximum of 64 colors without going into the overhead of HAM mode. 

     Although Extra-Halfbrite provides you with 64 colors, only the first
     32 are user-adjustable - the last 32 are just half-intensities of the
     first 32.

          SEE -> `HBRITE MODE`

MED-RES:  640 x 200 with a maximum of 16 colors.
    
INTERLACE:  320 x 400 with all colors modes up to HAM available.

HI-RES:  640 x 400 with 16 colors maximum.

OVERSCAN:  Activates overscan mode and allows you to paint directly into
     the borders of the screen so that the image fills the entire screen.
     Especially useful when outputting to video, but very memory intensive.
     There are two type of overscan:

     STD: should fill the majority of the video screen and conserves a
          significant amount of memory.

     MAX: fills the maximum area of the screen. Use this setting if the
          STD setting does not quite cover the entire screen. 


IF YOU NEED TO ADJUST THE POSITION OF THE SCREEN, PRESSING THE CTRL KEY
WHILE USING THE CURSOR KEYS WILL ALLOW YOU TO DO SO WITHOUT HAVING TO USE
WORKBENCH PREFERENCES.

***********************************************************************
                          LOAD BRUSH (Brush Menu)
***********************************************************************


This Displays the "Load Brush" requester which allows you to load a brush
file into the current screen.  Brushes are parts of a picture that have
been cut out with the Brush tool.  They can be saved so that you can later
use them in other projects.  If the brush was cut from a picture with a
different color palette, select the option `Use Brush Palette` from the
COLOR menu.

SEE  -> `LOAD PICTURE` for details on how to use the file requester.

ALSO -> `PALETTE`



***********************************************************************
                          SAVE BRUSH (Brush Menu)
***********************************************************************


This Displays the "Save Brush" requester which allows you to save the
current custom brush.

The current picture's palette is saved with the brush.

SEE -> `LOAD PICTURE` for details on how to use the file requester.



***********************************************************************
                        RESTORE BRUSH (Brush Menu)
***********************************************************************


KEYBOARD = SHIFT B 


This functions restores the last custom brush that was used and attaches it
to the mouse pointer.  The custom brush could be an animbrush, built-in
brush, or any brush created using the brush tool.  Clicking on the BRUSH
tool with the right mouse button also activates this function.

SEE ALSO -> `SPARE BRUSH`



***********************************************************************
                         SPARE BRUSH (Brush Menu)
***********************************************************************


In addition to the `Spare Page` feature, DeluxePaint IV adds the ability to
have a spare custom brush. This means that you can now switch between a
built-in brush, animbrush, and either of two custom brushes that you cut
out with the `Brush Tool`. More importantly, this spare brush feature
allows you to access the "Metamorphosis" feature.

Metamorph allows you to have one custom brush transform into the shape and
colors of another custom brush - resulting in a metamorphing animbrush.
DeluxePaint automatically takes care of Tweening (drawing the in-between
frames). 

Brush->Spare   After cutting out a brush with the `Brush Tool`, you must 
(ALT n)        use this function to copy the brush to the spare brush.
               This brush will be the starting shape for the Metamorph.

               You can then cut out another brush shape. The size of the
               brush is limited to available memory. A requester will be
               displayed if a brush is too big.

Brush<->Spare  This function lets you switch between the current brush and
(ALT b)        the spare brush for painting.


Metamorph      Once you have a spare brush AND another custom brush you
(ALT m)        can perform a metamorph. Selecting this function displays
               a requester where you enter the number of frames or
               transformation steps that you want in the metamorph. When
               you click OK, the Metamorph animbrush will be created using 
               a screen separate from your picture or animation frames.
               After the process has completed, the newly created animbrush
               will be attached to your pointer, ready for animpainting.

               See -> `ANIMBRUSH` `ANIMPAINTING`



***********************************************************************
                          SIZE BRUSH (Brush Menu)
***********************************************************************


STRETCH (SHIFT Z) allows you to size the brush horizontally, vertically or
     both, by moving the mouse.

     Holding down the shift key constrains motion of the mouse so that
     changes in the brush height are the same as those for brush width.
     This maintains the aspect ratio of the brush while you resize.

HALVE (h) reduces the horizontal and vertical brush dimensions by 50%.

DOUBLE (SHIFT H) doubles the brush's horizontal and vertical dimensions.

DOUBLE HORIZ (SHIFT X) doubles only the horizontal dimension of the brush. 

DOUBLE VERT (SHIFT Y) doubles only the vertical dimension of the brush.  

The - key decreases the current brush size

The = key increases the current brush size.

NOTE: These transformations can't be used on animbrushes. To resize an
      animbrush, enter Perspective mode, then hold down CTRL and move the
      mouse to size the brush along the Z axis.











     SEE -> `PERSPECTIVE`



***********************************************************************
                          FLIP BRUSH (Brush Menu)
***********************************************************************



HORIZ (x)      Flips the brush on its horizontal or x axis.

VERT (y)       Flips the brush on its vertical or y axis.



***********************************************************************
                             EDGE (Brush Menu)
***********************************************************************



OUTLINE (o)    Adds a one pixel border around the current brush
               using the current foreground color.

TRIM (SHIFT O) Removes a one pixel border around the current brush.

Additionally, some of the drawing tools can be made to automatically add an
outline to themselves by using the 'i' function. For instance, holding down
the 'i' key on the keyboard while selecting the Rectangle tool activates 
auto-outline mode. After you draw with the tool, an outline will be drawn
around its edge, automatically!  Whatever custom brush you have attached to
the pointer will be used to draw the outline.

This function works on the `Filled Freehand`, `Circle`, `Ellipse` and
`Polygon` tools also.



***********************************************************************
                         ROTATE BRUSH (Brush Menu)
***********************************************************************



90 DEGREES (z) Rotates the current brush clockwise 90 degrees.

ANY ANGLE      Variably rotates the current brush as you move the mouse.  
               Each time this option is selected, the brush reverts to its
               original orientation.

SHEAR          Fixes the top part of the brush in place and allows you to 
               drag the bottom part in either the left or right direction.



***********************************************************************
                          BEND BRUSH (Brush Menu)
***********************************************************************


HORIZ     Bends the current brush horizontally (left or right) as you move 
          the mouse left or right.  The vertical position of the mouse
          determines the bending point.

VERT      Bends the current brush vertically (up or down) as you move the 
          mouse up or down.  The horizontal position of the mouse
          determines the bending point.



***********************************************************************
                          BRUSH HANDLE (Brush Menu)
***********************************************************************


CENTER (ALT s) places the brush handle at the brush's center.

CORNER (ALT x or ALT y) places the cursor at one of the brush's four
     corners.

PLACE (ALT z) lets you place the brush handle by dragging the mouse.

NOTE: The location of the brush handle is very important when working with
      the functions of the Move requester or Perspective, since the brush
      handle becomes the "hinge" point for all rotations.

     SEE ->    `Move`    `Perspective`



***********************************************************************
                             MATTE (Mode Menu)
                                   (F1)
***********************************************************************


This mode reverts to the default mode as when you first create a custom
brush using the Brush tool.  In this mode, the areas of the brush which
matched the background color when the brush was first created become
transparent and all separate colors in the brush are displayed.



***********************************************************************
                             COLOR (Mode Menu)
                                   (F2)
***********************************************************************


This mode uses the shape of a custom brush and the current foreground
color.  Color Mode turns a multicolored brush into a single color brush of
the same shape.  The areas of the brush which matched the background color
when the brush was created remain transparent.



***********************************************************************
                             REPLC (Mode Menu)
                                   (F3)
***********************************************************************


This mode operates similar to the Matte mode by using the original form of
the custom brush and maintaining all separate colors.  However no colors
are transparent.



***********************************************************************
                             SMEAR (Mode Menu)
                                   (F4)
***********************************************************************


In this mode, colors on the Dpaint page become smeared as you drag a brush
over them.  The intensity of the smearing effect is dependant on the size
of the current brush.  Only the colors under the brush are smeared
together.  No new colors are added and it does not matter what the current
color of the brush is.



***********************************************************************
                             SHADE (Mode Menu)
                                   (F5)
***********************************************************************


This mode is similar to the Smear mode but uses the current brush's shape
instead of its color.  Only those colors which are within the currently
active color range are affected.  In this mode, the left mouse button
paints with the next higher color in the range while the right button
paints with the next lower color. Shade mode is very useful for creating
realistic shadows, since Shade can be made to darken areas and still allow
details to be visible.

SEE -> `RANGES` for details on creating ranges and selecting the current
        range.



***********************************************************************
                             BLEND (Mode Menu)
                                   (F6)
***********************************************************************


This mode is similar to the Smear mode but uses additional shades by
averaging colors (Smear only uses the colors currently under the brush)
When you drag a brush over two colors, a third intermediate shade, which is
the closest average of the two colors, is added.  This shade must be
available within the current palette.  Therefore the available colors in
the palette determines how much blending will take place.

Blending works best when you have more colors and color gradients in your
palette.

SEE -> `RANGES` for details on creating ranges and selecting the current
        range.
          
    -> `Palette` for details on creating color gradients.



***********************************************************************
                             CYCLE (Mode Menu)
                                   (F7)
***********************************************************************


This mode uses the brushes shape for painting. If a color range is
currently active, the brush will cycle through all the colors within the
range as you draw.

SEE -> `RANGES` for details on creating ranges, selecting the current
        range and adjusting color cycle speed.

    -> `MULTICYCLES` for multicolored brush effects.

    -> `CYCLE` for turning on color cycling mode.



***********************************************************************
                            SMOOTH (Mode Menu)
                                   (F8)
***********************************************************************


This mode removes the hard, jagged edges that can exist between highly
contrasting colors.  When painting over two adjacent colors with the
current brush, Dpaint locates intermediate colors that can fit between the
two colors to create a smoother gradient of intermediate shades.
Therefore, a wider range of colors in the palette results in greater
smoothing effects.

SEE ALSO -> `ANTIALIAS` for another way to get rid of the "jaggies"



***********************************************************************
                              MIX (Mode Menu)
***********************************************************************


This mode uses the brushes shape and current foreground color for painting.
A multicolor brush becomes a single color brush in the current foreground
color.  The colors directly under the brush determine the color that will
be painted on the screen.  The closest available color in the palette, that
lies between the brush and screen color will appear.

If you are in HAM mode, and the mix color does not currently exist in your
palette, it will be added automatically. Essentially, you get the same
effect as what takes place in the palette mixer area, except that the
mixing takes place directly on the painting screen.



***********************************************************************
                            HBRITE (Mode Menu)
***********************************************************************


This mode is only available if you are using 64 colors (Extra halfbrite
mode - Available on ALL A500's, A2x00's A3x00's and SOME A1000's).  In this
mode, painting with the left mouse button darkens colors in a painting to
their halfbrite equivalent, while painting with the right button lightens
halfbrite colors to their normal equivalent.

NOTE: Although Extra-Halfbrite provides you with 64 colors, only the first
     32 are user-adjustable - the last 32 are just half-intensities of the
     first 32. The palette controls can not be used to adjust the halfbrite
     colors directly. You must edit the corresponding color in one of the
     first 32 positions, then the halfbrite counterpart will automatically
     be readjusted. Additionally, you cannot copy to or delete any of the
     halfbrite color positions, but you can copy a halfbrite color to any
     other position in the palette.

                           ANIMBRUSH (Anim Menu)
***********************************************************************


An animbrush is a special kind of custom brush. It is actually a mini
animation that you can position within a larger screen animation.  This
gives you the ability to create complex movements and effects by simply
drawing with an animated brush.  As you draw with an animbrush, it cycles
through its individual frames.  There are two ways to create an animbrush,
using the `Metamorph` feature or by using the animbrush submenu functions:


LOAD      The "Load Animbrush" requester is displayed. 

          When an animbrush created from a palette different than that of
          the current picture is loaded, the picture palette remains in
          place.  The palette of the animbrush can be used by choosing the
          Palette -> `Use Brush Palette` option from the Color Menu.

SAVE      The "Save Animbrush" requester is displayed.  This requester
          works like the "Save Picture" requester.

     SEE -> `LOAD PICTURE` for details on how to use the file requester.

PICK UP   This works like the Brush Selector tool. However, you will be 
          cutting out an area from multiple frames. It is the movement 
          within this area, over successive frames, that will define the
          action of the animbrush. You specify the area you want to cut
          out by dragging out a rectangle. The same conventions used for
          defining regular custom brushes apply; using the left button
          copies the defined area & the right button cuts out (& removes)
          the defined area. A requester will appear. This lets you specify
          the number of frames to cut the animbrush from, starting with 
          the current frame. 

          When painting with an animbrush, all of its frames are cycled
          through as you paint.  Normally, this cycling occurs only on the
          current frame.  Holding down any Alt key will cause the
          individual frames of the animbrush to be painted on successive
          animation frames. This is known as AnimPainting.


SETTINGS  Displays the Animbrush Settings requester:


     NUMBER OF CELS      shows you the number of animbrush cels.

     DURATION            the rate at which the animbrush cycles through 
                         its cels.

     CURRENT             sets the starting brush cel used when painting.
    
     DIRECTION           specifies forward, backward, or ping-pong flipping 
                         through the cels of the animbrush as you paint.
        
     7 & 8 KEYS          (along the top of the keyboard; not the Numeric
                         Keypad) allow you to step forward and backward
                         through the cels of the animbrush.  Shift-7 steps
                         to the first animbrush cel and Shift-8 steps to
                         the last cel.

     USE                 Makes the last Animbrush "picked up" the current 
                         brush. This lets you use the last animbrush after
                         having picked up a regular brush.

     FREE                Gets rid of the animbrush and releases all memory
                         associated with it.



***********************************************************************
                           LOAD ANIM (Anim Menu)
***********************************************************************


The "Load Anim" requester is displayed.  This requester works like the
`Load Picture` requester.  Loading an animation replaces any that currently
exists.  If you select Append from the requester, instead of Load, then the
animation is added to the end of your current animation. 

NOTE: Animations must be in the same format and resolution in order to use
      the Append function.

SEE -> `LOAD PICTURE` for details on how to use the file requester.

Individual pictures can be loaded into frames of your animation by using
the "Load Picture" requester.



***********************************************************************
                            SAVE ANIM (Anim Menu)
***********************************************************************


The "Save Anim" requester is displayed.  This requester works like the
`Save Picture` requester.

SEE -> `LOAD PICTURE` for details on how to use the file requester.

You can specify the range of frames in the animation to save by entering
values for the "Frames __ TO __" area. Just entering the starting and
ending frame numbers.



***********************************************************************
                           MOVE ANIM (Anim Menu)
***********************************************************************


The "Move" requester sets up motion for brush animation.  By using the
Cartesian coordinate system, you specify values for movement along the X
(left & right direction), Y (up & down) or Z (in & out) axes.  This lets
you define a 3 dimensional movement for the current brush (the current
brush can be a built-in, custom or animbrush).  Additionally, you can
control whether the movement is drawn entirely on a single frame or through
a sequence of animation frames.

The first thing you must do is specify a starting position for the brush.
This is done by stamping the brush at the desired starting location on the
screen.  Animation is then achieved by entering appropriate values into the
Move requester and clicking on the DRAW button.


TIP: Here's a method to help you understand the X, Y, Z (Cartesian
     Coordinate system) a little more intuitively:

     - Extend your left hand and the following 3 fingers,

          your index finger should point straight ahead,
          your thumb should point straight up and,
          your middle finger should point to your right.

     - Now, think of your middle finger as the X axis. It is the horizontal
       axis, so movement along it goes either left or right. Positive
       movement along the X axis goes towards the right - the direction 
       that your middle finger should be pointing! - negative X movement
       goes towards the left. Now, imagine a ring on your middle finger,
       the way that you can rotate this ring represents the rotational
       movement possible on the X axis. This is would be like a flipping
       motion.

       Your thumb represents the Y, or vertical axis. Movement goes up or 
       down along the Y axis. The direction your thumb is pointing, up, 
       indicates positive Y axis movement. Negative Y movement is down.
       Rotation on the Y axis is like the movement of a spinning top.

       Finally, your index finger represents movement along the Z axis.
       Positive Z axis movement goes into the screen, or away from you, 
       while negative Z movement comes towards you. Rotation on the Z axis
       can be compared to how you would view a rotating fan or propeller.


DIST      Specifies the total distance that the brush will move along the X,
          Y, and Z axes.  The Brush button to the right of these entries is
          used to specify whether the movement is relative to the Brush
          axes or the Screen axes. All values relate to pixel units. So,
          an X value of 120 would cause the brush to move 120 pixels right,
          from the starting point (-120 would move the brush left;
          Incidentally, positive Y values move up, negative Y moves down,
          positive Z moves forward - away from you, and negative Z moves
          backwards - towards you).


ANGLE     Specifies the total angle, in degrees, that the brush rotate
          around any combination of axes.  The Brush button to the right of
          these entries is used to specify rotation relative to the Brush
          axes or Screen axes.

     REMEMBER: All rotations occur around the brush handle!  
          
          SEE -> `HANDLE BRUSH`


EASE-OUT  Sets the number of frames beginning from the first frame, over
          which you want the animation to gradually accelerate (this helps
          create more natural motion). Think of this as the number of
          frames you would like the brush to "ease out to start the
          movement".

EASE-IN   Sets the number of frames ending with the last frame, over which
          you want the animation to gradually decelerate.  Think of this as
          the number of frames you would like the brush to "ease in to
          end the movement".

COUNT     Sets the number of frames that you want the movement to take
          place over - starting from the current frame.

CLEAR     Zeros all of the Move and Angle values.

GO BACK   Restores the starting position of the brush for the next movement
          to the last place it was manually clicked down.  The default is
          to start the next movement where the last one ended.

CYCLIC    Specifies cyclic animation; one that starts and ends at the same 
          position.


DIRECTION BUTTONS   This set of buttons controls the direction of the move 
                    and the order in which the frames are painted:

          O-> GO FROM    starts the movement of the brush from the point                          you stamped it and paints on following frames.

          ->O COME TO    starts the animation at an earlier frame, depending
                         on the COUNT value, and paints forward to the 
                         current frame.

RECORD BUTTONS      specify the order in which the frames of the brush move 
                    are painted when dealing with an animation with more
                    than one frame.

          >> FORWARD     paints forward from where you stamped the brush.

          || IN PLACE    paints all of the moves on the current frame.

          << BACKWARD:   paints the move in reverse order, starting at the
                         last frame and painting backwards.

PREVIEW   Allows you to view the entire movement in "wire-frame" mode.
          Spacebar stops the preview.


TRAILS    Creates an animation using the specified Move settings by copying
          the newly painted contents of each frame in the movement, to
          every following frame.

FILL      For each movement a filled perspective plane based on the           rotation of brush is drawn.

          SEE ALSO -> `PERSPECTIVE`

DRAW      Creates an animation using the specified Move settings.

CANCEL    Restores any altered settings and exits the Move requester.

EXIT      Exits the Move requester but retains any of the entered settings.

LOAD      Lets you load previously saved Move requester settings by 
          displaying the "Load Move" file requester.

SAVE      Allows you to save all of the values and button settings in 
          the Move requester. This way you can use the same move effect
          for other projects.

SEE -> `LOAD PICTURE` for details on how to use the file requester.



***********************************************************************
                          ANIM FRAMES (Anim Menu)
***********************************************************************


SET #          Displays the Set Frame Count requester. This allows you to 
               Add or Delete frames; if the number you specify is greater
               than the current amount of frames, frames will be added to
               make the total number of frames equal to the number you 
               specified.  If the current frame is the last frame, frames
               will be added after the current frame.  If the current frame
               is in the middle of a group of frames, frames will be
               inserted after the current frame.


               THE CONTENTS OF THE CURRENT FRAME ARE COPIED TO THE ADDED
               FRAMES.

               If you specify a number less than the current amount of
               frames, then frames will be deleted forward, starting with
               the current frame, until the total number of frames is
               equal to the number you specified.


ADD FRAMES     Displays a requester that lets you specify the number
               of frames you want added.  These new frames are added after
               the current frame.  Additionally, the contents of the
               current frame are copied to all the new frames. The last
               frame to be added becomes the current one.


COPY FRAMES    Displays the "Copy Frames" requester. This gives you several
               options to choose from:


               By using the upper half of the requester, you can copy the
               current frame to either All Frames that currently exist or
               only to a Range of frames. To copy the current frame to
               a Range, enter a range of frames in the  __to__ area and 
               click on the Range button.

               The bottom half of the Copy Frames requester lets you copy
               a Range of frames and insert them before a specified frame.
               This allows you to copy "blocks" of your animation and place
               them at other points in the animation. This feature gives
               a kind of "Copy & Paste" function commonly found in
               word processing programs, of course, you are working with
               animation frames instead of words!

DELETE FRAMES  Displays the "Delete Frames" requester with the following
               options:


               Click on the Current Frame button to delete only the 
               current frame.

               The Range button lets you delete the frames specified by
               the values in the __to__ area.

               Clicking All frames will remove all animation frames from
               memory, leaving only the current frame available.



***********************************************************************
                         ANIM CONTROL (Anim Menu)

***********************************************************************
                          ANIM METHOD (Anim Menu)
***********************************************************************


There are two methods that DPaint uses in creating animations:

COMPRESSED     Allows many more frames in memory at once.  This method saves
               only the differences between frames.

     ADVANTAGES: allows for more frames

     DISADVANTAGES: slower while animpainting, loading and saving and more 
                    likely to run out of memory due to memory fragmentation


                     COMPRESSED METHOD IS THE DEFAULT


EXPANDED       Allocates memory to hold complete information for each and 
               every frame.

     ADVANTAGES:    animpainting is very smooth. memory will less likely run
                    out as elements are added to the animation within the
                    allocated frames.

     DISADVANTAGES: requires more memory than compressed method.  



***********************************************************************
                            RANGES (Color Menu)
***********************************************************************


Color ranges are used to create smooth gradients for fill patterns, for
color cycling effects, or for affecting the various paint Modes (i.e.  Shade,
Blend or Cycle).  Range creation and editing is done through the Range
requester (CTRL r):


Range Selection

DPaint IV, allows for up to 8 independently defined ranges. The slider
gadget at the upper left corner of the Range requester lets you choose
which range to work with. Simply drag the slider using the left mouse
button to change the current range. The current number is displayed to the
right of the slider.

Range Creation

The colors defined in the current palette (SEE -> `Palette`) are displayed
in a row towards the bottom of the requester. Up to 32 colors are visible
at a time. You can select other banks of colors using the arrow buttons at
the right end of the color row. At the top right corner of the requester is
the foreground/background color indicator. Since the paint screen is still
active and usable while the range requester is displayed, the color row and
color indicator take the place of using the toolbox area.

Towards the top center area of the requester is a segmented line.  This is
the range bar where you place colors to define a range.  The line has 32
segments which represent positions for defining up to 32 colors in a range.

To define a range, simple click on a color in the color row with the left
button.  A "color bead" will become attached to your pointer.  At this
point you can move to the range bar and place it in any of the available
positions by clicking on the line with the left button.  The color bead
will then become detached from your pointer.  Now you can continue to add
more colors, in any order or spacing, by repeating the procedure.

As color beads are placed on the range bar, those color beads that are
actually found in your available screen palette are marked with a black dot
at the bottom of the color bead. In HAM mode (See `HAM Mode`), 

The SHOW button is used to display the gradient created by your arrangement
of colors. The box below the range bar displays what the gradient looks
like in HAM (4096 Color) mode. The gradient is always displayed using HAM
in this box even if you are only working on screen with say only 16 colors.
If your colors on the range are separated by empty slots, DPaint
automatically displays additional colors in the gradient box when you click
on SHOW.  This lets you see any intermediate colors that help make the
gradient smoother.  If you are already working in HAM mode, the gradient
that is shown will be used during any gradient fill operations 
(SEE -> `Fill`). However, if you are working in a non-HAM mode, say with
only 16 colors, then a window will appear above the Range requester to
display the gradient that is possible with the colors in your palette.
Therefore you may not be able to get as smooth a gradient as you want
because you may not have enough actual colors to create it! Clicking on
SHOW a second time clears the gradient box.

As we touched on previously, the spacing between colors on the range bar
affects the gradient.  Simply increasing the spaces between two colors on
the range bar, causes DPaint to calculate more gradient colors. Again the
amount of available colors in your palette will affect how smooth the
gradient can be; In HAM mode DPaint can always create the smoothest
possible gradient. 

To smooth the color transitions within gradients, DPaint uses a process
called "Dithering". Dithering approximates the blending of colors by
using closely spaced pixels to represent saturated color and increasingly
spaced pixels for lower saturation. This way a color can appear to blend
more smoothly by dissolving into another color. There are two types of
dithering that DPaint uses. The default is "Ordered Dithering" where the
dithered dots take on a regular, even pattern. By clicking & activating the
Random button, "Random Dithering" is enabled. Random Dithering, as the name
implies causes the dithered dot pattern to be more irregular - more grainy.
This graininess can be adjusted with the Dithering slider. The Dithering
slider can adjust from a low setting where definite color bands are
visible, to a high, very grainy setting. By default Pattern Dithering is
used to create a regular patterned blend of colors.

     NOTE: the Dithering slider is only functional in the Random mode.
           Also, the SHOW gradient area in the Range requester always
           displays the smoothest possible HAM gradient. The effect of the
           Dithering slider is not displayed in the SHOW gradient area.
           For non-HAM modes, an alternate display window is used.
           Otherwise, you can see the effect of the Dithering slider from
           within the Fill Type requester.

The REVERSE button reverses the order of the colors placed on the range
line. This is useful for changing the direction of the gradient or the
direction for color cycling. The keyboard equivalent, Alt-R lets you
reverse a current range while you are painting.

CLEAR removes any colors from the range bar, clearing the gradient and
range definition.

UNDO takes back the last action performed in the Range requester.

REVERT resets the range requester to the settings that were present the
last time it was called up.

COLOR CYCLING is a very useful function primarily used for animation
effects. Color cycling shifts the positions of colors in a range, in
sequential order.

During color cycling, each color moves into the position of the next
neighboring color in the range (actually, the RGB values of a range color
are applied to the next neighboring in the range, but to keep things simple
we'll assume that colors are actually changing position).  This occurs
according to the speed set by the Cycle Rate slider. When a color gets
to the end of a range, it starts over at the beginning again. Hence, a
continuous cycling process. Color cycling is activated by the Cycle menu
item in the Color menu or by pressing the TAB key.

There are a few important things to remember about color cycling:

     1.   Only the colors that actually exist on the range bar will be
          involved during color cycling.

          Even though the colors you place on the range bar may generate a
          gradient that appears to have several colors, only those areas of
          the gradient which match a color on the range bar will be part
          of a color cycle - only those colors will cycle.

     2.   The spacing of colors placed on the range bar will affect the
          way colors cycle.

          When range colors are placed immediately next to each other,
          the colors will simply cycle through each position. However,
          when space is increased between colors on the range bar, an
          interesting thing occurs: a color separated by spaces will
          cycle through any intermediate colors in order to get to the 
          next color on the range. In other words, if you place a red
          color on the range bar, immediately neighbored by a blue,
          the colors will simply cycle between red and blue. However, 
          if you leave a few spaces between the red and blue, then the
          red will cycle through any intermediate shades (such as
          purples, if available) before becoming blue.
          
     3.   A color does not have to exist in your immediate palette. 
          Even in non-HAM modes, the palette provides access to the HAM
          color spectrum, you can access colors that are not in your
          immediate screen palette.  This is useful for creating flashing
          or glowing effects without having to use up all your actual
          screen colors.
     
     4.   In HAM mode, only the first 16 colors are available for color
          cycling. At least one of the first 16 colors must exist on 
          the range bar to make cycling possible. Additionally only those
          areas of the screen painted using a color out of the 16 can
          cycle.

                            CYCLE (Color Menu)
                                   (TAB)
***********************************************************************


Selecting this option toggles color cycling on or off. Color cycling causes
any colors in a range (SEE -> `Ranges`) to cycle through their range of
colors.  In effect, cycling causes a color to continuously shift its
position in the range.  This can cause a single color on the screen to
either flash, pulsate, or glow, depending on the colors in the range.  With
gradients, the effect can simulate motion - like flowing water.

In any case, a color range must first exist and must have a defined cycle
rate greater than 0. The direction of cycling is controlled by the ordering
of a range. This can be changed by reversing the range in the Range
requester.

                           PALETTE (Color Menu)
***********************************************************************


MIXER (p, or right button click on the color indicator in the toolbox)

     Displays the MIXER requester. This lets you define the color
     values in your palette. using a variety of controls:


          Clicking on the button at the far left of the screen switches
          between the RGB & HSV slider controls.
     
          The R, G, & B sliders adjust a colors RED, GREEN and BLUE values.

          The H, S, & V sliders control HUE (the color's position in the
          color spectrum ranging from red to purple), SATURATION (the
          amount of white in the color; with high SATURATION being pure
          color and low SATURATION containing more white), and VALUE (the
          amount of black in a color).

          SPREAD creates uniform gradations between two colors. First
          click on a starting color, click Spread, then click on the color
          that you want to gradation to proceed towards.

          EX (EXCHANGE) swaps the positions of two colors.

          PICK lets you choose a color that exists on the screen. The
          pointer will change to an eyedropper image so that you can
          click on a color to edit. The color you click on, will become
          the current color in the requester. Changing the values of
          a color will affect the palette and areas where that color exists
          on the screen. 

          NOTE: In HAM mode, only the areas on the screen that use the
                first 16 colors of the palette are affected by the sliders.
                Other color areas will not change when you move the
                sliders, even if you use the PICK function to choose
                the color directly from the screen.
                
          COPY allows you to duplicate a color to another position.

          DELETE lets you remove a color definition or a range of colors
          from the palette.   

     While the mixer requester is displayed, the painting screen is still
     active and the palette bar in the requester takes the place of
     selecting colors from the toolbox. 32 colors are available at a time,
     with more available by clicking the arrows to the right of the palette
     bar to move up or down to different color rows. Up to 8 rows or 256
     colors can be defined at a time.

     The mixing area lets you create new colors from other colors by
     electronically simulating the mixing of real paint.  You can then PICK
     colors you create in the mixing area and position them in the palette.

     NOTE: If you click OK in the Mixer requester or call up another
           requester such as the ARRANGE or RANGE requester, anything you
           have done in the mixing area will be lost. Use the keyboard
           equivalent, p, to toggle the mixer display and to keep the
           mixing area intact.

ARRANGE (SHIFT P)


     Displays the ARRANGE requester. This provides access to more palette
     colors at once. 


USE BRUSH PALETTE:  When a brush is loaded, Dpaint continues to use the
     current picture palette.  If you wish to apply the brush's original
     palette to the current one, select this option.

RESTORE PALETTE:  selecting this option will return you to the palette that
     existed before the last palette change or the palette of the last
     picture or animation that was loaded.

DEFAULT PALETTE:  Selecting this option will revert to the palette that
     DPaint uses when it is first loaded.



***********************************************************************                          Color Set (Color Menu)
***********************************************************************

A Color Set consists of specific colors selected from the current palette.
A Color Set gives you the advantage of being able to load and save colors
other than those in your base palette (SEE->`Save Palette`or`Load Palette`).
In other words, you can save all the colors currently defined in the
palette; Save Palette only saves the base colors -- the first 32 colors in
32 color mode, the first 16 colors in 16 color mode, etc.

Save Color Set 


     Selecting this option will display a requester similar to the
     palette's ARRANGE requester. Like the Arrange requester, this will
     display all currently defined colors in the palette. Status
     information at the bottom left corner of the requester lets you know
     how many colors are selected and how many color positions are empty,
     or undefined.  You can select or unselect specific colors simply
     by clicking on them (selected colors appear sunken into requester,
     while unselected colors appear raised) or you can use one of the three
     select buttons:

          ALL - selects all currently defined colors

          NONE - unselects all colors
          
          BASE - selects only the base colors for the current 
                 `Screen Format`.  I.E.  the first 32 colors in 32 color
                 mode, the first 16 colors in 16 color mode, etc. In HAM
                 mode, the first 16 colors are the base colors. 
     
                    SEE -> `HAM Mode` for an explanation of HAM

                 In Extra-Halfbrite or 64 color mode, the first 32 colors
                 are the base colors. Remember, the other 32 are actually
                 half-intensities of the first 32 colors.

                    SEE -> `HBrite Mode`
                      
     If you decide that you don't want to proceed with saving the color
     set, you can click on the Cancel button.

     The Save button will display the Save Color Set file requester to
     let you specify where and under what name to save the Color Set.

     SEE -> `Load Picture` for details on how to use the file requester.

     NOTE: It's a good idea to append an extension to a Color Set's file
           name when you save it. This will help you distinguish between
           other types of files. For instance you can use .cs as in:

                             RainbowColors.cs

           In fact, it's a good idea to use extensions for all the other
           save processes: 

               .anib     for animbrushes, 
               .anim     for animations,
               .pic      for pictures
               .br       for brushes
               .move     for move requester settings 
               .sten     for stencils
               .pal      for palettes


Load Color Set          

     Selecting this option displays the Load Color Set requester.

     SEE -> `Load Picture` for details on how to use the file requester.

     After seleting a valid Color Set file and clicking the Load button, 
     a requester similar to the palette's ARRANGE requester is displayed.
     This requester displays the colors in the Color Set and lets you 
     specifically select which colors to use.

     As in the Save Color Set process above, you can use the ALL, NONE and
     BASE buttons for selecting colors.

     Once you have selected all the colors you want, click the ADD button
     to append the selected colors to any empty color positions in your
     palette; your current palette will remain unchanged. This way you can
     install colors that were used in other projects for use in the current
     project, while maintaining the current palette.

     The OVERWRITE button will cause the selected colors to replace colors
     in your palette. starting from the first palette position.



************************************************************************                            BG->FG (Color Menu)
***********************************************************************


BG->FG:  Globally changes all pixels colored with the current background
     color to the current foreground color.  Only colors on the screen are
     affected. The Palette itself is unmodified.  

          * UNDO DOES NOT REVERSE THE EFFECT OF THIS FUNCTION! *

                           BG<->FG (Color Menu)

See `BGtoFG_Color` for related demonstration.

BG<->FG:  Globally swaps the color of all pixels in the current
     background color with the current foreground color.  Only colors on
     the paint screen are affected.

          * UNDO DOES NOT REVERSE THE EFFECT OF THIS FUNCTION! *



***********************************************************************
                         COLOR REMAP (Color Menu)
***********************************************************************


Even though pictures can contain the same colors, sometimes the arrangement
of colors within the palette varies. You can force a picture to use the
current palette colors by using the Remap function.  After Loading a
picture, first select `Restore Palette`, then select Remap. The Remap
function will attempt to rearrange the picture's coloring so that it will
look correct within the current palette colors.  Obviously then, Remap will
work best when the same or similar range of colors is available in the
current palette.  Otherwise, the Remap function will find the closest
possible matches to the original colors of the picture.



***********************************************************************
                         BRUSH COLOR (Color Menu)
***********************************************************************


BG->FG    Changes all the background colored pixels in the brush or
          animbrush to the currently selected foreground color.  This
          affects only the colors in the brush, not the picture.  The order
          of colors in the color palette also remains unchanged.  This lets
          you replace any color in a brush with another color.

BG<->FG   Swaps all the background colored pixels in the brush or animbrush
          with those in the currently selected foreground color.  Similar
          to the BG->FG option but the change happens in both directions.

REMAP     When a brush from a picture with a different palette than the 
          current picture is loaded, this option rearranges the colors of
          the brush so that it looks correct under the current palette
          arrangement.  DPaint will try to match colors as closely as
          possible to the currently available colors.  When
          remapping an animbrush, all frames of the anim brush are
          remapped.

CHANGE TRANSPARENCY  Changes the transparency of the current brush or
          animbrush to the currently selected background color.



***********************************************************************
                           STENCIL (Effect Menu)
***********************************************************************


A Stencil allows you to protect certain areas of an image from being erased
or painted on. Stencils are created by defining a particular area to be
protected. This can be done in either of two methods (or even a combination
of the two):

     1. By specific color

     2. By area


DEFINING A STENCIL AREA BY SPECIFIC COLOR


MAKE      The Stencil Requester allows you to select the colors you would 
(~)       like to lock. Locked colors can not be painted on, erased or
          picked up as part of a brush.


          In all non-HAM modes, the Stencil Requester displays all of the
          colors in your current palette for you to choose from. Just
          click on the color that you want protected and a black marker
          will appear to the right of the selected color box.

          Clicking on INVERT will reverse the settings of the Stencil; the
          colors you have NOT selected will become protected. The CLEAR
          button will deselect all colors from the Stencil requester.  Once
          you have decided what colors you want to protect, selecting MAKE
          creates a working Stencil.  The letter "S" will appear in the
          menubar to indicate that the Stencil Mode is active. The stencil
          can then be toggled on and off using the ACCENT key below the
          ESC key.


          The SHOW button lets you see the stencil areas on the screen.
          This is done by dimming the entire painting area. The areas that
          are currently defined within the stencil will be highlighted.
          This lets you see what areas are affected by your color
          selections so that you can make changes if necessary. If a
          it appears that your stencil does not cover enough area, simply
          use the left button to click or drag over additional colors.
          Click the right button over a color to remove it from the
          stencil.
          
               NOTE: You may have to reselect the SHOW button in order
                     to display the changes you have made.


          In HAM modes, the palette is not displayed within the Stencil
          Requester. You must select colors directly from the screen. This
          is done using the left buttons.  Click directly on a screen color
          to lock it.  A color box will display the color that your pointer
          clicked.  You can continue doing this for as many other
          colors as necessary.


          Tolerance lets you set the closeness of colors. In other words
          colors that are similar to the picked color will also be included
          in the stencil.  This is very useful for gradient areas.  A low
          tolerance value requires that colors be very similar in order to
          be included as part of the stencil.  High tolerance values let
          you include a wider variety of colors. Tolerance can range from

                                  0 to 48

          Fine Tune, is used to add or subtract single colors from a
          HAM stencil without having to change tolerance level. Only
          the color you click on will be added or subtracted from the
          stencil -- the tolerance level will be ignored. Click with
          the right button to subtract colors & use the left button
          to add stencil colors.         

    
REMAKE    When a Stencil is active, any colors you add onto the picture are 
          independent from those that are locked in the Stencil.  This
          means that if a new color is added to the picture it may not be
          protected even if it was selected in the Stencil requester.
          Selecting Remake from the Stencil requester will lock any newly
          applied colors that match the current stencil colors.


PAINT ON/OFF   This option activates or deactivates "Stencil Painting"
(CTRL s)  mode. In Stencil Painting mode, you can define a stencil by area
          rather than color. This is done by painting a stencil using any
          of the standard drawing tools and built-in brushes (i.e. Filled
          or Unfilled Line, Circle, Rectangle or Polygon, Airbrush, Brush
          and even the Fill tool). Creating a stencil in this mode is
          really simple. When Stencil Paint is active, a lowercase "s" will
          appear in the menubar and the entire painting screen will become
          dimmed. As you paint with a tool, such as the Freehand Line, a
          stencil is defined. This is indicated by the painted area
          becoming highlighted. Painting with the left button draws a
          stencil, while painting with the right button erases the stencil.

          To use the stencil, select the Paint ON/OFF option again or use
          its keyboard equivalent, Ctrl-S.

               NOTE: If you defined a previous stencil using the Stencil
                     Requester, it will be displayed when you enter
                     Stencil Paint mode. By using Stencil Paint, you can
                     further define the coverage of the stencil.


REVERSE   Performs the same function as selecting the Invert option in the
          Stencil requester (color settings for the Stencil are reversed;
          instead of the color you picked being protected, the colors that
          you did NOT pick become protected).

ON/OFF    Retains the information for a current Stencil, but allows you to
          toggle from active to inactive so that you can paint over
          protected colors. The keyboard equivalent is the ACCENT key
          below the ESC key.

FREE      ON/OFF will make a Stencil active or inactive but keeps the Stencil
          information in memory.  FREE completely deletes a Stencil and
          releases the memory that it takes up.

LOAD      Brings up a standard Load requester to allow you to load a saved 
          Stencil.  Stencils are loaded as full screen overlays and protect
          the areas that were defined when they were originally created.
          In other words, the shape of the stencil is used rather than the
          colors that were originally defined for it.


SAVE      Allows you to save a Stencil just like you would a Brush or
          Picture. You can change the colors that make up a Stencil at any
          time since the shape rather than the color information of the
          Stencil is saved.

     SEE -> `Load Picture` for details on how to use the file requester.
            `Lock FG` for another Stencil method.



***********************************************************************
                         LIGHTTABLE (Effect Menu)
***********************************************************************


DeluxePaint IV's LightTable feature is an animation tool that simulates
the device used by traditional cel animators. Cel animation is a procedure
that involves drawing animation frames on transparent film. This allows the
animator to overlay consecutive frames so that they can be used as
reference for drawing additional frames.

DPaint accomplishes this effect by allowing you to see up to two previous
frames of animation from the current animation frame. You can continue
painting on the current frame, without affecting the contents of the
previous frames.  This way you can use previous frames as reference frames
to paint more frames.  You can dim the Lightable and cause previous frames
to become less distinct so that the display is not so confusing. 

Additionally, DPaint allows you to see the next frame in a sequence as
well, so that you can draw in-between frames.

The options available for the LightTable are:

ON/OFF    Toggles the LightTable effect on or off.
(l)

MERGE     Combines the contents of all frames being currently displayed
          by the LightTable, into the current frame.

DIM       Lowers the intensity for all frames other than the current frame.
(ALT l)   This helps you distinguish between the images displayed by the
          LightTable.

TWO BACK  Displays the image on the frame that is two back; the frame
          previous to the previous frame, along with the current frame.

PREVIOUS  Displays the frame previous to the current frame, along with the
          current frame.

NEXT      Displays the image on the next frame, along with the current
          frame.

SPARE     Displays the image on the `Spare Page`, along with the current 
          frame.

     NOTE: You can use any combination of TWO BACK, PREVIOUS, NEXT or SPARE
           to display the desired frames you need.

           You must turn LightTable off if you want to Delete or Clear
           multiple frames.



***********************************************************************
                         BACKGROUND (Effect Menu)
***********************************************************************


FIX       Locks the current picture information into memory.  When you Fix 
          the Background, anything can be painted over it without changing
          it.  Any work you do after fixing the Background can be erased by
          selecting Clr without affecting the Fixed picture.  When the
          Background is Fixed, however, no colors that match the current
          Background color can be picked up.  Locking the Background is
          memory intensive.

FREE      Unlocks the current Background, so that it can be altered and can 
          be erased.  All memory allocated to storing the Background
          information will be freed.


LOCK FG   This provides an additional way to define a `Stencil`.  Normally
          a stencil is defined by color information.  When you lock
          a color, you prevent it from being painted on no matter where it
          is on the page.  Selecting Lock FG while using the Fix Background
          option will allow you to define a Stencil by area.  When Lock FG
          is selected, all areas on the page that have been added since the
          Background was last fixed are defined as the Stencil.  These
          areas can't be painted on regardless of the colors in them.



***********************************************************************
                          ANTIALIAS (Effect Menu)
***********************************************************************


Aliasing is the jaggedness that results when the computer displays diagonal
or curved lines.  The "stair-stepping", as it is also called, is more
visible in lower resolutions.  The AntiAlias effect tries to make the
jaggedness less apparent. This is achieved by decreasing the contrast
between an objects jagged edge and the background with intermediate shades
of color. The AntiAliasing effect automatically places a gradient that
blends an edge into the background.  This effectively gives the illusion of
a much smoother edge.

There are two levels of AntiAliasing, Low and High. Increasing the level of
AntiAliasing will provide smoother looking edges but can take more time
when large areas are involved.

                       Use the keyboard equivalent,

                                   ALT /

to toggle between None, Low and High AntiAliasing; A lowercase a in the
menu bar indicates that low AntiAliasing is activated, while an uppercase A
indicates High AntiAliasing.

Basically, you can use the AntiAliasing effect with most of the drawing
tools and Built-In brushes including: 

     Dotted, 
     Continuous,
     Straight Line,
     Circle,
     Ellipse,
     Polygon,

In addition, stamping down a custom brush with AntiAliasing on, will cause
the edges of the brush to be smoothed.

AntiAliasing also applies during use of the Move requester. 

     ** However, in order for AntiAliasing to work during a move, you must
        call the Move requester and stamp down the brush's initial position
        while you are in `Perspective` mode.

 SEE ALSO -> `SMOOTH MODE`

     The major difference between using AntiAlias and Smooth Mode is that
     Smooth Mode tends to blur edges since the gradient effect is used
     between the edge and the background. AntiAlias creates a smoother and
     cleaner edge by concentrating the gradient between the jagged points
     of an edge. 



***********************************************************************
                           PROCESS (Effect Menu)
***********************************************************************


The Process effect lets you perform image processing effects based on Tint,
Hue or Value. 

Processing is turned on or off by selecting the ON/OFF menu item or by
using the Keyboard equivalent toggle, 

                                   ALT p

One of the 3 processing methods currently selected will take affect during
painting:

     Tint

          The screen colors are tinted with the brush color. This is useful
          for colorizing black and white images. Additionally, tinting
          colors using a gray shaded brush will convert the colors into
          shades of gray.

     Hue
          Like Tint, screen colors are tinted towards the brush color.
          However.  Only colors are affected -- adjusting Hue on gray
          shades has no effect.

     
     Value
          Processes the screen colors' value towards the brush color to
          create shading effects. Painting with a light color will
          lighted screen colors whose value settings are lower than the
          brush's value setting. Conversely, painting with a dark color
          will darken screen colors whose value settings are higher than
          the brush's value setting.



***********************************************************************
                        TRANSLUCENCY (Effect Menu)
***********************************************************************


The Translucency effects lets you simulate light filtering. You can adjust
translucency from 0%, no translucency, to 100%, completely transparent.
This is done by adjusting a slider in the Translucency requester.



***********************************************************************
                         PERSPECTIVE (Effect Menu)
***********************************************************************


DO (Enter, on keypad) Activates Perspective mode.  The current custom brush
          temporarily changes into a 4 square matrix that represents the
          boundaries of the brush.  The matrix can be rotated in one of 3
          ways:  Horizontally on the brush's X axis, Vertically on the Y
          axis, or on its Z axis (Spin).  The amount of rotation on each of
          the Perspective axes is displayed in degrees on the right side of
          the Menubar.  Once the matrix has achieved a desired position,
          Clicking the Left Mouse button will draw the current custom brush
          into the current perspective.

     PERSPECTIVE ROTATIONS The Numeric Keypad is used to control the
          rotation of the brush:.

     7, 8 & 9       control rotation on the X-axis:

          8    rotates the brush so that the top part moves away from you. 
          7    rotates the brush so that the top part moves towards you. 
          9    returns you to zero X-axis rotation.

     4, 5 & 6 control rotation on the Y-axis: 

          5    rotates the brush so that the right side moves away from you. 
          4    rotates the brush so that the right side moves towards you. 
          6    returns you to zero Y-axis rotation.

     1, 2 & 3 control rotation on the Z-axis: 

          1    rotates the brush in a clockwise direction. 
          2    rotates the brush counterclockwise. 
          3    returns the brush to zero Z-axis rotation.

     Rotation occurs at preset increments of degrees.  To rotate around an
     axis in larger increments, Hold down the Shift key as you press an
     appropriate key on the Numeric Keypad.  The rotation increment
     defaults to 90 degrees when you do this.  To set the increment
     yourself, just call up the Gridding Requester while you are in
     Perspective Mode by clicking the Right Mouse Button on the Grid icon
     or by selecting SETTINGS from the Perspective sub-menu.  Pressing 0 on
     the keypad resets all 3 axes to zero and fixes the Z-axis (discussed
     below) but retain the apparent distance settings.  Pressing Shift
     along with Keypad 0 reverts all the Perspective settings to the
     default state as they were when the program was initially loaded.

     CLICKING ANY OF THE DRAWING TOOLS EXITS THE PERSPECTIVE MODE.


FILLSCREEN (Keypad - ) Fills the entire screen with the current brush
     in its current Perspective orientation.


RESET (Keypad 0 ) Resets the brush to its original state before rotation.


CENTER (Keypad . ) Allows you to select the Center of Perspective.


SETTINGS  Displays the Perspective requester.  Also displayable by selecting
          the Grid tool with the Right Mouse button while in Perspective
          mode.  The following options are available:

     
     GRID      Sets the dimensions for a grid in three dimensional space. 
               When the Perspective requester is first opened, the numbers
               in these fields correspond to the dimensions of your brush
               (Z value = Y value).


     FROM BRUSH - Sets the X and Y grid values to correspond to the width
               and height of the brush, restoring the perspective grid
               settings to the same dimensions as your brush without
               affecting any other settings.

     ANGLE STEP - Sets the rotation increment used in conjunction with the
               Shift key when using the Numeric Keypad for perspective
               rotations. The default is 90 degrees.


     TYPE (OF ROTATION)

          SCREEN - Default mode that uses screen coordinates when rotating
               around the different axes.  All measurements are angles of
               rotation from absolute zero.

          BRUSH - Rotates the brush relative to the current brush
               coordinate system.
          
     DISPLAY   Using the Angle and Pos buttons you can choose whether the 
               menu bar displays the angles of rotation or the position of
               the brush in 3- dimensional space.

WITH COORDS IN THE PREFS MENU ON, ONLY 2-DIMENSIONAL COORDINATES ARE SHOWN.
TURN COORDS OFF TO SEE 3D COORDINATES.


FIXING AXES    


When Perspective is first started, the Z-axis is fixed and the brush cannot
move through that axis.  To change the currently fixed axis:

     Press SHIFT 9(on keypad) to fix the X-axis
     Press SHIFT 6(on keypad) to fix the Y-axis
     Press SHIFT 3(on keypad) to fix the Z-axis

The ; and the ' keys move the brush plane forward or back along a fixed
axis without affecting its current Perspective.  Using the Shift key moves
in larger increments.

The CTRL key temporarily fixes the Y axis so that you can move the brush
forward or backward in 3D space by moving the mouse forward or backward.

***********************************************************************


Movement of the mouse is displayed as positions from the origin (the lower
left corner of the screen - (0,0)).  Pressing and holding down either mouse
button will temporarily reset the origin as the current position of the
cursor.  As the mouse is then dragged, the coordinates will show the cursor
position relative to its starting position.  Using this information, you
can create accurately sized and positioned objects.

* The OriginUL option in the Prefs menu changes the origin location
  to the UPPER LEFT.

TIP:  If you are trying to accurately position an brush using the
     coordinates, and find that you cannot move the mouse precisely enough,
     use the keyboard to position the brush in increments. If you hold down
     either Amiga key to the left or right of the spacebar, you can use the
     cursor (arrow) keys to move the brush up and down or left and right.

           SHIFT F       Displays Fill Type requester

                          REMEMBER: f for "fill"


The Fill tool is selected by clicking the Left Mouse button over its icon.
When selected, the cursor becomes the shape of a paint can with a spout.

Selecting the Fill tool with the Right Mouse button displays the Fill Type
requester:


SOLID:  fills with a single color Using the Left button fills with the
     current foreground color, while the Right button fills with the
     current background color.
    
TINT:  tints an area with the current fill color by replacing the
     Saturation and Hue levels of the screen pixels with those of the
     current fill color but does not change the Value of the pixels (see
     Palette lesson).  During this operation, the RGB values for the new
     tint color are calculated and the color in the current palette which
     most closely matches this color is used.  Therefore, the Tint effect
     is very dependant on the available palette colors.

BRUSH:  Sizes the current custom brush to fill in the selected area.

WRAP:  Distorts the current custom brush to fill the shape of the selected
     area to give the illusion of wrapping around a 3D solid.

PERSPECTIVE:  fills with a pattern of the current brush using the current
     Perspective settings (see Perspective lesson).
     
HBRITE:  If available on your system, this option will fill using the
     HBrite painting mode (see HBrite mode lesson).

PATTERN:  fills with a pattern created from the current brush using the
     From Brush function.

GRADIENT FILLS:  fills with a color spread from the cycle range of the
     current foreground color according to the following methods:



     HORIZONTAL - gradient is evenly distributed from left to right.

     VERTICAL - gradient is evenly distributed from top to bottom.

     HORIZONTAL SHAPE - gradient is evenly distributed from left to right
          but adjusted on each line to follow the contours of the current
          shape being filled.

Directional Gradients:

                               LINEAR FILLS

     LINE (Linear) - can be set to any angle or direction; a line setting
          tool lets you adjust the direction and angle.
     
     SHAP (Shaped) - another linear type gradient that can be set to any
          angle or direction. Additionally the contours of the current
          shape are taken into account.

                               RADIAL FILLS

     CIR  (Circular) - gradient is created using concentric bands of color.
          a line tool lets you adjust the center point of the gradient.

     CON  (Contour) - a circular type gradient that follows the contours
          of the current shape.

     HI   (Highlight) - creates a gradient that simulates highlighting.
          You define where the "hotspot" is positioned.


THE DIRECTION OF THE GRADIENT IS SPECIFIED BY THE DIRECTION OF THE COLOR
RANGE IN THE RANGE REQUESTER. Also, ALT r reverses the direction of the
current color range.

DITHER:   adjusts the degree of color mixing used in gradient fills.
          The default dithering type, with the Random box unchecked, is
          Ordered Dithering. This uses an orderly arrangement of dots
          to blend gradient bands.

     RANDOM - when you click on the random box, a check mark appears to
              indicate that it is activated. The dithering slider will 
              then become active - allowing you to adjust the mixing or
              coarseness of the gradient.

          REMEMBER: the dithering slider is only active in RANDOM dithering
                    mode.

H-B:  If HalfBrite mode is available on your system, this option enables or
     disables the use of Extra Halfbrite colors within the gradient.

Holding down "i" while using the Fill tool fills outward using areas with
the current background color as boundaries.

In Animations, Animfill can be activated by holding down the Alt key while
filling. The same area over all the existing frames will be filled.
