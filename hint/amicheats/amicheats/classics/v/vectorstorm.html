<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Vektor Storm makes you commander of a small space exploration fleet
that accidently falls through a black hole. On the other side,
reality is turned upside down as you discover an alternative,
fragmented universe where truth is false and right is wrong. Even
the very laws of physics have changed. Lurking in the infinite
darkness, an army of nasty alien life forms waits to destroy you and
your fleet. To return to this universe, you must first meet the
challenge set before you by your alien adversaries - beat them at
their own game. Your four ships must fight against and arsenal of
intellegent weapons on a series of battlegrids. The rules are
simple, the stakes are life and death itself.
