<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Volfied is the most incredible, action-packed science fiction game
to date. Volfied requires skill, strategy and extremely quick
reflexes. It alows you to use your flying skills and put them into
quick action, as you fight through 16 levels of challenging
gameplay. The game is crammed with masses of enemies and hidden
bonuses. Face Giant Crabs, Killer Ladybirds, Violent Insects, and
the ever-changing massive Boss Alien as you pick up extra power like
lasers, power ups and time stops. Simple in concept, but incredibly
addictive to play.

<P>
Get a score of exactly 10 points and press 'ESC' or the key right
under 'ESC'. Now go to the difficulty setting and scroll through
the options. You will notice a new option (CHEAT). You can now
start on any level with infinite lives. Your shields will also
last longer and the little enemies can't kill you when they run
into your path.
