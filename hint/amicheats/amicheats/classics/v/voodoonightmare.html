<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
All the nasties go to sleep at night. When you pause a game, the
day/night timer still runs. Thus it is possible to play only during
the safe night periods, and pausing the game during the dangerous
daylight.
</P>

<P>
MISSION 1: Feed the monkey on your back bananas. Eventually,
this will give him a bad case of diarrhoea, and he'll run off
to a secluded spot.
</P>

<P>
MISSION 2: Reunite the lion cub with his mum. Look in the
tree trunks.
</P>

<P>
MISSION 3: Save a sick native, buy medicine.
