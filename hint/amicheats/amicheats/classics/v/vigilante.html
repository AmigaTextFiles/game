<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Nothing like a well-delivered flying kick to stop these bald-headed
brutes. No pain, no dame! Better get a grip on your chako-sticks or
you won't get your girl. Those scuzzy guttersnipes have resurfaced.
This time threy're wreaking havoc on your home turf and they've
kidnapped your woman. There's no telling what they might do! Even
the cops have copped out. It will be up to you to save her. As
Vigilante, you must take the power into your own hands and stop
these maniacal mohawks before it's too late. Only you can defeat the
skinheads, deliver justice, and rescue your babe. Use your fists,
feet, or nail'em with your nunchucks, because these punks only fight
one way - dirty!
