<P>
Wait by the door to the airport and booby trap all doors. When the
other spy has got all the stuff, he'll get killed trying to get to
the exit - just go through the door which he tried to get through.
Pick up the stuff by searching the furniture and escape. If he does
get through, just beat him up and head for the exit.
