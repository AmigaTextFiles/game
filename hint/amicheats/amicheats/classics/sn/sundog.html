<P>
You can get shields for 350 cr to 400 cr, depending where you are.
To get them, go to the weapon store and click on the rapid heal, and
then click on yes, then instead of clicking on the rapid heal, go
right of it, so you are on a blank space. Click now and you will
have found a shield which you didn't have before in one of your
carrying squares. Though it says {SHIELD}, after one hit, it will
say shield (7).
