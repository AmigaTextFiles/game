<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
In this sequel to Speedball, players are challenged to turn the
worst team in Speedball history - Brutal Deluxe - into champions.
Players can be team manager or Speedball player and gear up with
helmets for greater intelligence, chestplates, and other weaponry.
Players can collect coins and tokens to purchase equipment and to
alter the game play. In addition to scoring points via the goal,
Speedball 2 - Brutal Deluxe awards players points for injuring the
opponent and for bouncing the steel ball off bounce domes and score
multiplayer ramps.
</P>

<H2>CHEATS</H2>

<P>
In the Knockout, draw with the first (easy) team. You must replay
them until there is a winner, so keep drawing and collecting more
money. As you build up your teams power, this becomes easier. When
your team reaches maximum strength you can begin thrashing your way
to the final.
</P>

<H2>TIPS</H2>

<H3>KICK OFF</H3>

<P>
Providing that you have built up your centre-forward to maximum
power on all stats, gaining possession of the ball when it comes
into play is actually a doddle. When the ball is thrown into the
arena, wait for you opponent to rush for it, and then barge in with
a well timed push.
</P>

<P>
With their centre-forward out of the way, this leaves a clear path
to your opponents goal with only the deflection dome to avoid.
</P>

<P>
Alternatively, if your centre-forward is sufficiently powered-up,
you can risk gaining possession as soon as the ball appears, and
then barge past.
</P>

<H3>TACKLING</H3>

<P>
As a rule, it is best to barge the player in possession from either
the rear or from the side. Aiming for a head-on confrontation
normally results in your player taking a tumble, whereas sliding
from behind allows you to turn on the spot and throw the ball to one
of your attacking team mates. Similarly, to avoid losing possession
never keep hold of the ball too long. And if you do risk a long
run, ensure that you keep weaving from side to side so that any
pursuing player's can't get too close. However, to avoid any risk,
it is better to keep the ball moving by passing from player to
player.
</P>

<H3>PASSING AND INTERCEPTION</H3>

<P>
Passing has been made as easy as possible and as your players get
more intelligent, tight moves can be performed. Always use the
wingers for runs up the side of the pitch as they might be able to
try for a sneaky shot at the accumalator during the run. Also when
performing long passes, if you have a player between the thrower and
the would-be catcher, make him intercept the floating ball as it
lessens the possibility of the oppositions defence collecting it
before it reaches the player it was intended for. Intercepting the
ball during an opponent's throw should be attempted in the same
manner, and is particularly effective if the player crosses the
ball's path from the side, as he can then turn and throw it down to
the waiting attackers.
</P>

<H3>ATTACKING</H3>

<P>
Thanks to the number of pitch-side features, attacking offers a
number of useful tricks. Whenever possible, use the score
multiplier to add extra pointage to any goal scored. A neat little
cheat here is to throw the ball into it mid-run and, if your timing
is spot-on, you collect it before it emerges from the tube and
before the opposition get to it.
</P>

<P>
Another advantage of using the multiplier is that it doubles the
number of players that are stunned when the ball is electrified
using the charger. This is an added bonus when the ball is thrown
towards the goal. If the opposing team position a defender between
the goalie and the goal, even the weakest of shots will get through.
It'll be sure to stun both the players on contact.
</P>

<P>
Another neat feature is the ability to bend shots. After touch can
be added by keeping the joystick pushed into the direction you want
to curl the ball after shooting. This enables shots to curl around
the goalie with ease and foxes most of the defenders, too.
</P>

<P>
In addition, if all else fails, simply run in and nobble the goalie.
As he tries to throw the ball, intercept it, and throw it back.
Then run in and barge him and slam the ball in.
</P>

<P>
Finally, never take a shot from directly ahead of the keeper,
because even if it curls, he will get to it every time - aim from a
diagonal whenever possible.
</P>

<H3>THE STARS</H3>

<P>
Throwing the ball at the pinball-esque stars adds two points to your
score - however, the opposition can remove them by hitting the lit
star again. As you become more proficient, experimenting with
certain angles as good positioning often allows you to light two
stars at once.
</P>

<P>
In addition, whenever you make a run, aim for a star (providing the
opposition aren't breathing down your neck) as hitting all five
grants the player an extra ten points which can't be taken away.
</P>

<P>
When you're ahead you can allow yourself the luxury of cancelling
out your opponent's stars.
</P>

<H3>GOALKEEPING</H3>

<P>
Intelligence is of paramount importance for goalies, as is strength.
As a goalie's intelligence is raised, he gets progressively more
daring and takes less risks. Likewise, the goalie doesn't come into
play until really necessary, and this avoids confusion between the
keeper and the defenders.
</P>

<P>
Never throw the ball across the goal.
</P>

<P>
Never keep hold of the ball for longer than is genuinely needed.
</P>

<P>
Breaking these cardinal rules means disaster, as the keeper will get
nobbled and a goal is almost certainly going to be conceded.
</P>

<P>
Finally, although the goalie can wander roughly quarter of the way
upfield, try to make the defenders do the running, leaving the
goalie free to cover his area if need be.
</P>

<H3>GOALKEEPER</H3>

<P>
It is essential to have a strong keeper, he must be able to win any
head-to-head tackles, losing almost certainly guarantees the
opposition a goal. Intelligence is also important. A goalie with a
high IQ is more likely to go after rogue balls or intercept passes.
He also needs to be able to clear the ball effectively, so
increasing his passing skills.
</P>

<H3>DEFENCE</H3>

<P>
A powerful defence stems from its ability to block. Concentrate on
boosting your defender's strength, power and passing. Don't
hesitate once a defender has the ball; pass it up field straight
away.
</P>

<H3>MIDFIELD</H3>

<P>
The midfield's there simply to pass the ball to the attackers so
build up their speed and passing ability. Midfielders are also
useful for operating the score multiplier to increase points.
</P>

<H3>WINGERS</H3>

<P>
Next to the centre-forward the winger are the most important
players. Possessing high strength, aggression and intelligence,
your wingers will concentrate on occupying the opposition goalkeeper
and defence, allowing the forward to get a good scoring position.
</P>

<H3>CENTRE FORWARD</H3>

<P>
The centre-forward is the anchor man of the team. His role is to
win possession at kick off, do the bulk of the team's running and,
most importantly, score goals. Strength, speed and a good passing
ability are a must. This must be the first player you build up.
</P>

<H3>SUBS</H3>

<P>
Substitutes are usually overlooked when a team is being built up,
which is a mistake. The centre-forward is generally the first
player to be injured in a match, so he needs to be replaced by
someone with almost equal skill.
</P>

<H3>TOKENS</H3>

<P>
Going out of the way to collect tokens can be risky, opening holes
in the defence or attack, so you need to be selective. Go for
tokens that have a lasting effect, these include Freeze, Shut,
Reverse and Transport. Any other tokens should be considered as
luxuries and aren't worth going after.
