<H2>TIPS</H2>

<H3>GENERAL ADVICE</H3>

<P>
Your ship is really the "character" you'll develop, by equipping it
with armament and other gear. Concentrate upon learning to fly the
ship first, for which a joystick is essential.
</P>

<P>
Use the QUERY option to pick up messages and detect other
spacecraft.
</P>

<P>
Firstly you must get yourself some decent weaponry. After docking
at Hiathra go see Orellian, the Imperial Representative and take
your Space Pilot's exam. The answers to this are:
</P>

<OL>
<LI>- 3.26
<LI>- type O
<LI>- F = M + A
<LI>- THE IMPERIUM
</OL>

<P>
If you don't have your Space Pilot's licence you can't buy any
weapons, shields, etc which doesn't help matters.
</P>

<P>
Don't think about becoming a pirate or bounty hunter until you're
armed to the teeth, naturally the most expensive laser is the best
(the Particle Beam); they're very effective in cutting up Manchi and
other baddies. Initially, buy the Sapphire.
</P>

<P>
Use the map to get through the Bassruti Mining Station. If you
start wandering around the monster may sneak up and have you. It's
a fairly thick monster and escape is impossible.
</P>

<P>
Talk to everyone on the base, especially VEDA (a green monster). If
he sells you some CONTACT LENSES, buy them. Go to the room where
CEBAK is (the girl who keeps talking about the greatest coin-op in
the galaxy, HIVE!). Inspect the far right SPACE SUIT on the back
wall and you should find a KEY CARD. When you have spoken to
everyone, go and see the SHIP OUTFITTER. Buy 4 extra CARGO PODS off
him. Then go to the Trader and buy 8 tons of either 1GB RAMS or
SUPERCOMPUTERS. If they don't have any of these, don't buy
anything.
</P>

<P>
Next go to the MICON I outpost. Sell the 1GB RAMS or SUPERCOMPUTERS
and buy EXPLOSIVES or FORGED CREDITS. The important thing about
smuggling CONTRABAND is to remember to have a different item in your
last CARGO POD. That way you don't usually get caught. Go and see
Sir Eld. He will ask you to do him a favour, so agree to do it. Go
back to HIATHRA Starbase and deliver the Statuette to The Imperium
Representatives. Sell the EXPLOSIVES or FORGED CREDITS but NOT
SUPERCOMPUTERS or 1GB RAMS. Return to MICON I and talk to Sir Eld.
He will give you some useful advice and give you a Stealth Box.
Repeat this HIATHRA to MIACON I run until you have enough credits to
buy a PARTICLE BEAM LASER. Now the fun begins!!
</P>

<P>
Here you must make a decision. Whether you will become a PIRATE or
a BOUNTY HUNTER. Being a pirate means that you get more combat
practice and get (most importantly) more money but this also means
that every ship you come across will attack you. If you're a Bounty
Hunter, at least the Merchant ships won't attack you.
</P>

<P>
The next item on the agenda is to get more ARMOUR. When you've got
500 of this and your REPUTE is FIERCE or higher, go and see DUCHESS
AVENSTAR at DENEBPRIME STARBASE in the DENEB system. Talk to the
STUDENT an Deneb who will tell you to go to NAR'SEE and say 'RAKBIT'
to one of the ALIENS.
</P>

<P>
Do this and go back to Deneb and speak to the student. She will
give you a MALIR ARTIFACT. Next go to the BASSRUTI system. Here go
to the MINING STATION. You are advised to save your position before
docking with the station as there are rather a few monsters running
around the station with an unsociable tendency to tear you limb from
limb.
</P>

<P>
When you have docked, go to the room directly down from the docking
bay. A monster should enter here so be careful. You must try to
get a table between the monster and yourself and then run through
one of the doors. When you are sure that you have lost the monster,
go to the room at the bottom left of the station (the one with the
SAFE in it) and inspect the CABINET below it. You should find some
NSBs. Now go back to the ship and fly to the ARCTURUS system and go
to the MICON II MINING STATION. Go to the MADMAN in one of the
corridors and talk to him. Select 'OTHER' and type 'NSB'. He will
ask you the name of his mission, to which you should reply 'FERRET'.
He will tell you to go and see GUT.
</P>

<P>
Go to the KOTH carrier and use the CARD on the LOCKED DOOR. Avoid
the ALARM SQUARES and go and inspect one of the squares on the TOP
WALL. You will find the TRANSMUTATION COIL as long as you have
bought the CONTACT LENSES off VEDA.
</P>

<P>
Go back to the BASSRUTI system and soar through the vacuum to the
FREE GUILD OUTPOST. Go to CHI-SHA and say you are a ROGUE. Select
'OTHER' and say 'LUX-23A'. Agree to help her and she will come on
your ship as a repair droid. Go and see OMAR and demand to see GUT.
He will tell you to go and destroy a TITAN first. This 'small' task
is not too difficult as long as you have 500 ARMOUR and decent
shields. When you have done this, go back and talk to GUT. Explain
KOTH'S plot and he will tell you to go and see a BAAKILI FAR TRADER.
Say to him 'MANCHI' and offer him the MALIR ARTIFACT. When you have
received the information, go and see GUT again. He will tell you to
go to TROCHAL to steal the CHIGONGER back.
</P>

<P>
First, go to the MICON IV MINING STATION in the ZED N27 system.
Once at the station search behind the locked door until you find a
PSIONIC SHIELD. Then, go to the TROCHAL OUTPOST in the SIGURE
system and go to see VILANIE. She will ask you to remove the shield
- DON'T! She will call the guards so quickly unlock the DOOR in her
ROOM and inspect next to the EGG. Pick up the CHIGONGER and go back
to GUT. Then go to ZED N27 and talk to PROFESSOR PROSK. Give him
the TRANSMUTATION COIL and ask him for the NULL DAMPER. Explain
about the EGG and enter in the CO-ORDINATES "GC 3409". Go to the
NAVIGATION CONSOLE and set course for the MANCHI HOMEWORLD. Dock
here, turn the disk over and look at the pretty pictures.
</P>

<H3>MAKING MONEY</H3>

<P>
Forget playing Hive, which takes too long to make credits. For
trading, outfit the ship with four cargo pods then load some cargo
aboard. The best trade route is to/from Denebprime, Deneb and Free
Trader's, Bassruti.
</P>

<P>
The cargo lists and prices change every 24 hours at each Station,
generally fluctuating four to eight credits either way.
</P>

<P>
At Free Traders, buy forged CRs, Explosives and X-Rated Holos to
sell at Denebprime. At Denebprime, buy Brandy, Exotic Pets,
Videogames and Souvenirs to sell at Free Traders.
</P>

<P>
You can often get better prices on all items elsewhere, but these
are the most efficient trade routes for making money in a hurry. To
sell contraband, you need Forged Cargo Papers from Robocrook.
</P>

<P>
If planning a life of piracy, pick a Scow for your first target.
Pack at least ten plasma torpedoes and three SM-1 and two Nova
missiles. A particle beam laser is also handy. When firing
missiles, be sure your opponent has an inactive counter measure and
isn't in an elude manoeuvre.
</P>

<P>
As you make more credits invest in Turbo-thrusters, more shielding
and a 75% ECM unit (By completing certain missions, you'll get more
gear).
</P>

<H3>ROBOCROOK & OTHER CHARACTERS</H3>

<P>
Robocrook appears randomly in bars across the quadrants. Keep
offering cash, and he may sell you some useful items: Forged Cargo
Papers, Keycards, the Ruby Cube. Other randomly appearing
characters to seek out are Ilricki (for useful information on Black
Hand and the Manchi), Wandering Spaceman, Veda the Ursellus (sells
Amoebic Lenses), One-eyed Pirate, and the Merchant. Bartenders
always have current information and tips, and you should talk to
everyone you meet for more.
</P>

<P>
It's possible to steal from safes, but expect to pay a fine and get
kicked off the base or planet if caught!
</P>

<H3>THE MISSIONS</H3>

<P>
Most of these may be completed in any order, though a few require
items from other missions. Each mission's starting point is noted
after its name.
</P>

<H4>STEALTH BOX: MICON I</H4>

<P>
Talk to Sir Eld on Micon I, Karonus. He'll give you a Statuette to
deliver to Orellian at Hiathra Starbase. Do so, saying it is not a
bribe. Return to Eld, who'll give you some valuable information and
a Stealth Box, which reduces the chances of detection by enemy
ships.
</P>

<H4>PILOT'S LICENSE: HIATHRA</H4>

<P>
This is obtained by answering multiple-choice questions when you
meet Orellian on Hiathra, Karonus. Ask him for the CRC-07 Form,
used to visit Koth Carrier.
</P>

<H4>CEBOK'S SISTER: KARONUS</H4>

<P>
Cebok tells you to find his sister on Lagrange for information on
Hive. Then deliver the letter to Cebok for more tips.
</P>

<H4>BEAM LOCK: DENEBPRIME</H4>

<P>
See Felsane on Denebprime for a quest to find the Beam Lock, which
makes it easier to target ships with your laser.
</P>

<H4>MICROCHIP DELIVERY</H4>

<P>
After meeting the Pirate in a bar and accepting the job, take the
microchip to Chisa at Free Guild.
</P>

<H4>NULL DAMPER: ARCTURUS</H4>

<P>
After finding Veda the Ursellus (who appears randomly in bars) and
buying the Amoebic Lenses for 250 CR, head for the ISS Koth,
Arcturus. Use a keycard to open the door to the restricted area,
then go through and immediately go to the left (to avoid the hidden
floor alarm). Examine the Power Generator in the back of the room
and get the Transmutation Coil. Take it to Professor Prosk on Micon
IV, ZED N27. Accept the Null Damper when offered.
</P>

<H4>REPAIR DROID: RANDOM</H4>

<P>
Eventually you'll encounter a Droid named LUX 23A, who wants you to
look for his Droid friend MAID. MAID is hiding at Free Trader's
under the name of CHISHA. Mention LUX and she'll come with you as a
Repair Droid. Return her to LUX, and you'll get no reward beyond a
good conscience. Keep her and you've got a very valuable Repair
Droid for your ship!
</P>

<H4>DUCHESS AVENSTAR: DENEBPRIME</H4>

<P>
After fifteen to twenty cargo runs between Denebprime and Free
Trader's, you should have enough credits to fully outfit your ship,
assuming you've been adding equipment all along. You'll need at
least 500 Armour, some missiles, good Shields and a Particle Beam.
Before you can successfully communicate with Duchess Avenstar on
Denebprime, you must prove yourself by killing a few Manchi in
space. (Destroying Vultures will help. After doing so, she'll tell
you about General Targon, AKA Rayson, and his mission's code
name....MAKE A CAREFUL NOTE OF THIS!!)
</P>

<H4>TARGON: MICON II, ARCTURUS</H4>

<P>
Though you can find him here, Targon is insane and needs an
injection of NSB before he can reveal anything to you. The NSB is
at Bassruti Mining, guarded by a mutant monster. To get it, land at
Bassruti, walk around the front of your ship to the left and down.
Wait a few seconds by the southern door; the monster will be trying
to get to you but will get trapped in a storage compartment. After
a few more seconds, enter the door to your left. Go through the
door to the lower left in the Generator Room. Keep going to the
left, and you'll be in the Inner Office. Head straight for the
filing cabinet in the corner and search it for the NSB. Retrace
your path back to the ship. If this method fails, try again, but
wait a little longer for the monster to get trapped. You have to be
careful not to accidentally lure him out of the compartment.
(Another way: lure the monster to the right side of the room,
keeping the trash pile between him and yourself. Go through the
southwest door, use the keycard on the south door, open the safe,
get the NSB and return to your ship).
</P>

<P>
Now you can head for Micon II, Arcturus, and find Targon rambling
around the halls. Talk to him and give him one credit. When you
get an OTHER option, take it and enter NSB. Then you'll get another
OTHER option, so type in the name of his mission that you should
have noted earlier. He'll spill all he can before going nuts again.
Take this information to the Duchess, who'll send you to find
Droughton Gut, leader of the Scarlet Brotherhood at Free Trader's
Outpost.
</P>

<H4>PSIONIC SHIELD: GRYPHON</H4>

<P>
You'll need this item, which protects you from the powers of
Vilinie, to complete the final mission. First talk to Omas in the
back room on ConvecEast Mining Station, Gryphon. He'll ask you to
rescue his wife from the Black Hand Cult. She's at the Meditation
Room in Trochal, Sigure. After you talk to her, she'll tell you
she's abandonded Omas. Return to him for the Shield.
</P>

<H4>DROUGHTON GUT: FREE TRADER'S</H4>

<P>
Gut won't talk to you until you prove your allegiance to the Scarlet
Brotherhood. To do so, attack a few Tankers or Scows, take their
cargo to Free Trader's and talk to Omar. He'll grant permission to
speak with Droughton. After doing so, he'll help you steal the
Chi-Gonger (Manchi Egg) from Vilinie on Trochal.
</P>

<H4>MANCHI EGG: TROCHAL, SIGURE</H4>

<P>
Due to a diversion by the Scarlet Brotherhood, the guards will be in
a state of confusion when you land. Go straight to Vilinie's room.
When she stops and tells you to remove the Psionic Shield, DON'T.
The guards won't respond to her summons. Go to the far right of the
room and pick the lock on the door. Enter, take the Egg and get out
of there!
</P>

<H4>ICHIKI & THE BAAKILI</H4>

<P>
After obtaining the Egg, return to Gut. He'll tell you to find a
Baakili trader and ask him about the Manchi. The Baakili also
require payment - some Dilithium Crystals from a trash pile outside
the back door of the bar in the upper corner of Ross Mining Station,
Deneb (keep searching until you find them). Keep searching bars
until you meet Ichiki, then ask about Manchi and pay him with Gems.
Write down the co-ordinates he gives you for the Manchi's home
system, Ja-Karn. Return to Gut and tell him your findings. He'll
direct you to Prosk, the mad scientist from Micon IV.
</P>

<H4>THE WARP DRIVE & END GAME</H4>

<P>
Prosk is working on the Warp Drive. When you tell him the situation
this time, Prosk will warp you to the co-ordinates you give him;
enter the ones from Ichiki. You've got to be heavily outfitted just
to reach the Manchi homeworld. Plot a course for the planet, and
SAVE the game frequently. This saves you the trouble of having to
start all over from the far corner when you get blasted by a pack of
Vultures. Once you reach the planet, land.
</P>
