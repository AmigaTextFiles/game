<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
The game is easiest if fought in this order:
</P>

<OL>
<LI>REAGAN, POPE
<LI>GORBY, POPE
<LI>AYATOLLAH, POPE
<LI>BOTHA, POPE
<LI>MARGARET, POPE
</OL>

<P>
Finally a couple of useful pointers: keep close to your opponent,
so they can't hit you back. Always move away from your opponent
when their helpers appear, and hit your opponent with your special
move, when they are using theirs.
