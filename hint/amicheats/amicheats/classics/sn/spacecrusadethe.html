<H2>CHEATS</H2>

<P>
While being attacked, press 'ESC' key repeatedly. This will reduce
attacker's score, inflicting less damage on your soldiers.
</P>

<P>
Choose your team, then press the corresponding key on the key pad.
With 1 being the team on the left, 2 the middle team, and 3 the team
on the right. Keep the key pressed down and move the pointer under
the door and click the LEFT BUTTON four times, then the RIGHT BUTTON
four times. The border should flash to let you know if it worked.
</P>

<P>
Other sources explain the above cheat procedure this way. For
unlimited action moves follow this procedure. On the squadren
selection screen choose your team and wait for the shuters to close.
Move the curser under the name of the team you have just picked.
Now press and hold down the appropriate keypad number depending on
what team you have picked:
</P>

<P>
'1' - Blood Angels<BR>
'2' - Imperial Fists<BR>
'3' - Ultra Marines
</P>

<P>
Now press the left mouse button four times and then the right button
four times. If you've done this correctly blue stripes will flash
across the screen indicating that the cheat mode has been activated.
</P>

<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
SCANNER: A bit of advice about the scanner - try not to use it!
Although it's nice to know what's waiting for you when you enter a
room, it also gives the aliens the chance to move in and attack you.
</P>

<P>
MARCHING ORDERS: It's a good idea to keep your squad fairly tight.
Stragglers make easy targets. However, don't bunch them too tightly
together. Set off a booby trap and, if Lady Luck rolls the dice
against you, the whole squad could be wiped out in one fell swoop.
</P>

<P>
The bolter-carrying marine is the least effective member of the team
and is fairly expandable. Use him as a scout to open doors and the
like.
</P>

<P>
BY YOUR COMMANDER: The commander is naturally the hardest geezer in
your swuas of marines, so use him wisely. For a start, when tooling
him up give him a powerfist and a powersword. Although this means
he can't engage in any long-range combat because he had no gun or
missile launcher, it does make him super powerfull in hand-to-hand
battles and when the aliens start amassing this can be areal life
saver for all concerned.
</P>

<P>
Your commander has six hit points and so can afford to lose one.
Your grunts, howeverm with their measly one hit point, can't. In a
big firefight with a gang of marauding orcs or gretchins, place your
commander in between your marines and the aliens to absorb some of
the shots and protect the boys.
</P>

<P>
On retrieval missions, always use your commander to pick up the
object. Use a grunt and chances are he'll get killed before you get
off the ship.
</P>

<P>
Melta bombs are by far the most effective one-off weapon available.
Use it to fry a Dreadnough or any other tough cookies encountered.
</P>

<P>
TIDY YOUR ROOM: If you're exploring and you come across a bunch of
monsters, make sure you mop them all up before moving on. A feeble
gretchin, left to it's own devices, can decimate a squad if the dice
rolls are in its favour.
</P>

<P>
In a room packed with aliens use a Blind Grenade and, if possible, a
Fire Order card - this should wipe them out in no time at all. This
technique is particularly handy on Level 2.
</P>

<P>
Missile launchers are excellent for mass alien slayings. If there's
a whole bunch of them standing together fire the missile between
them - with good aiming and luck on your side you could wipe them
all out in one go. Remember to use targetters with missile
launchers and power guns.
</P>

<P>
THE LONE WARRIOR: Even if you're playing a solo game, still use the
other marine chapters. They will help spread out the Alien Event
cards and keep some of the nastier ones off your back.
