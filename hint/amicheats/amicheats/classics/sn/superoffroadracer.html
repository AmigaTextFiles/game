<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Strap on your helmet, grit your teeth, and prepare to master mud
heaven with Ivan 'Ironman' Stewart's Super Off Road. Shake, rattle,
and roll your way through mud holes, jumps, matchoffs, and spin-outs
in the closest thing to genuine short-course racing you'll ever
experience. Race up to three players at the same time. Go
wheel-to-wheel on eight different staduim tracks and a total of 16
configurations. Trade winnings for accessories at the speed shop to
improve your chances at victory. Enough rough and tumble racing
excitement to turn you into a leam, mean, off-road machine.
</P>

<H2>CHEATS</H2>

<P>
Simply hold down the fire button while the game is loading only
releasing it when you come to the name/country selection screen.
You will then find when you loose a race that you have infinite
credits and money.
</P>

<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
Buying tires before level two will help you in turning corners.
</P>

<P>
Winning races by short margins will slow down the other cars in the
next level.
