<H2>TIPS</H2>

<H3>GENERAL</H3>

<P>
It is best to use the Turbo Boost in even amounts while you roar
around the track (depending on the course naturally). Use a bit
extra boost at the start to pull in front of your competitor
(especially if it's Bully Boy).
</P>

<P>
Try not to hit your opponent on a corner as you will most likely
come off as well. If you must hit him, try not to run into him -
best to nudge him from the side. A point that people don't think
about is when you've just taken a jump take your finger off the fire
button. It just wastes valuable boost units when the adrenaline
pumping.
</P>

<H3>THE COURSES</H3>


<H4>THE STEPPING STONES</H4>

<P>
Fairly standard high-rise racing up to the stones. Hit them at
about 140 and use the boost if necessary on the last few.
</P>

<H4>THE HIGH JUMP</H4>

<P>
Accelerate to top speed with full boost at the start to give you
enough speed to jump the pillar in the middle. You can bounce your
way over the pillar if you're speed isn't quite top-whack (causing
minor damage). However there's a fair chance that you'll slide
afterwards - if so bye, bye car!
</P>

<H4>THE ROLLER COASTER</H4>

<P>
Don't go too fast as you pass the start line otherwise you'll miss
the first corner - around the 150 mark should do it. It's pretty
obvious but the actual Coaster is THE place for picking up speed.
</P>

<H4>THE LITTLE RAMP</H4>

<P>
Hit the jump at around 150.
</P>

<H4>THE DRAW BRIDGE</H4>

<P>
DON'T hit the bridge while it is up - Just wait until it's on the
way down before attempting it (a little earlier if you're at the
bottom with the engine idling).
</P>

<H4>THE SKI JUMP</H4>

<P>
Don't go too fast on the first left turn or you'll go flying over
the next corner. After that you may as well go for it. This is one
of the few courses where it pays to go like mad (baring the first
turns, of course). If you reach top speed as you reach the jump
then you should (in theory) touch down neatly on the slope following
it.
</P>

<H4>THE BIG RAMP</H4>

<P>
A good speed is needed at the start for the first two 'small' ramps;
about 170 is best. You will need to be travelling at round 210 for
the big jump itself.
</P>

<H4>THE HUMP BACK</H4>

<P>
It may look easy but it sure as anything isn't, if you go too fast.
If you find yourself going over it at top speed you may well float
over and smack into the corner after the hump. Only use boost where
it is a necessity (at the start / finish mainly).
</P>

<H3>THE BEST DRIVERS AND HOW TO BEAT THEM</H3>

<H4>WHIZZ KID</H4>

<P>
At first, stay behind and follow him, watch out for his
characteristics and if you get a chance, boost directly behind him
until he blocks your vision (some knowledge of the track will help)
then pull left then right and he's outta your way. Save this till
the end.
</P>

<H4>HOT ROD</H4>

<P>
The same rules as apply to the Whizz Kid. Don't overtake till
nearly the end of the race.
</P>

<H4>THE DODGER</H4>

<P>
In my opinion he's the hardest. If you get to the 1st Division then
you should have a lot of skill. All you do is battle, you'll have
to ram him out of your way if you can make it to the top.
</P>

<H4>BIG ED</H4>

<P>
The most annoying thing about him is the way he wheelies just in
front of you when you get near, especially at the start. Take him
on the jump; speed up and jump over the big guy.
</P>

<H4>DARE DEVIL</H4>

<P>
The hardest of the lower order drivers but if you're good and know
the track you can boost in on the bends and take him on the outside.
It takes cool nerves and a joystick of steel.
</P>
