<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
The Duke of Aladda has died and left his last will and testament to
you, his only child and heir. The Duke's legacy is a gallant one,
replete with deeds of valor in the defense of Aladda. By his
efforts, the former capital of the western realm of the Aragonian
Empire has returned to a proud state. It is your father's deepest
wish that you once again extend Aladda's dominion and eventually sit
on the emperor's throne in the city of Tetrada.
</P>

<H2>TIPS</H2>

<H3>STARTING OUT</H3>

<P>
The Ranger is the best man to have as your leader because the
characters he comes with, (mage, priest, warrior and two rangers)
give you the chance to build up your mage from the very start, and
letting you get to those mega powerful spells like Pyro and
Disintegrate really quickly, thus being able to do much more damage
in battle, and from a distance where you can't be hurt.
</P>

<P>
Also, decommision all your troops at the very start and reinforce
your bowmen, as these are by far the best men to have as they can
attack armies without having to engage with them, and save a lode
those precious hit. Infintry and mounted cavalry are not a very
advisable because they always take a lot of damage and take too long
to get to the higher levels.
</P>

<P>
If you really want to have a few armies with melee weapons then go
the whole hog and get some cavalry. These blokes can take a hell of
a lot of stick and still come out almost undamaged; at higher levels
they can totally decimate the enemy.
</P>

<P>
Remember to keep an eye on how your cities are doing, but don't
spend too much on developement. The best thing to do is save the
same before you go to the next month. That way if anything nasty
happens you can reload it and try again, thus avoiding the
situation. Not all the cities have to be taken by force, and if you
can get one to become your vassel it guarantees you a profit each
month from that city.
</P>

<H3>DECISIONS</H3>

<P>
Muscle isn't the only thing you're going to have to use. If you
want your people to stay loyal you'll have to make the right
decisions. The man Olaf who's up for murder is innocent and should
be pardoned. When the Elven diplomat arrives and asks you to stop
developing the lumber do as he wishes and become allied with the
elves. Pay ransoms or the people's morale will go down.
</P>

<P>
Trolls will sometimes demand money from Sur Nova, but if you take
your forces to the Troll's village and capture it, you shouldn't
have any more problems. The Nomads don't give you many problems if
they become your enemy, but become their ally anyhow just to be on
the safe side.
</P>

<H3>UNKNOWN CITIES</H3>

<P>
There are a quite a few unknown cities in the unexplored lands of
Aladda, some of them friendly, most of them evil. Below are a small
guidelines on what to expect from these mysterious places and their
inhabitants.
</P>

<H4>TRANAVAN: CITY OF THE ELVES</H4>

<P>
Depending on how diplomatic you've been this place could be either
hostile or friendly. But if you've followed the tips you won't have
any problems.
</P>

<H4>GERNOK: CITY OF THE GOBLINS</H4>

<P>
This place is filled with goblin forces plus a few rather nasty
looking monsters with magic capabilities, but it's not too hard to
beat them. However, remains of the Goblins will come back after and
try to win back the city.
</P>

XAFANTA: CITY OF THE DWARVES</H4>

<P>
These chaps are having quite a few problems with the orcs of Zarnix,
and they will help you defeat the orcs in the pass just before
Zarnix.
</P>

<H4>MEDEVAL: CITY OF THE ELVES</H4>

<P>
This is yet another city full of Elves, however, unlike the first
city the Elves aren't so nice and are pretty tough cookies.
</P>

<H4>CHAR: CITY OF THE GIANTS</H4>

<P>
This is where those big nasties hang out. Defeating them is quite a
problem, but with a few cavalry to aid your bowmen you should be
able to capture the city. A good reason for taking this city is
that the giants have control of a lake near to Tentula, and once
you've got it back the city's income should increase a little.
</P>

<H4>TROLL VILLAGE</H4>

<P>
If you're looking for a tough battle then this is the place to come.
There are tons of Troll and you'll need a lot of men to defeat them.
You'll also lose a lot of men in the process. This should stop any
ran- somed demands from the iliterate Trolls and make life a lot
easier.
</P>

<H4>DERSH: CITY OF THE TITANS</H4>

<P>
Dersh is probably the last unknown city you'll come to, and it is by
far the hardest. A huge number of men will be needed to take over
this city, and nearly all of them will be lost in the battle.
