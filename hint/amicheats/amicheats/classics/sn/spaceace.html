<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Space Ace continues in the tradition of Dragon's Lair with
breathtaking graphics, animation and sound brought to life on the
Amiga. Our hero, Ace, is being attacked by the evil commander Borf
who has just kidnapped Ace's girlfriend Kimberly. Borf's plans are
to take over the Earth by changing everyone into babies using his
dreaded weapon... the Infanto Ray. It is your mission to save Earth.
Be valiant, space warrior, the fate of Earth is in your hands!
</P>

<H2>DEMO</H2>

<P>
Just as Borf is attacking you, pause the game (press 'P') and type
"DODEMODEXTER", press 'FIRE' and 'RETURN' then press 'P' to restart
the game. The game should now complete itself. If it doesn't work,
try doing it on your last life.
</P>

<P>
Some sources say to just type in "DODEMODEXTER" to demo the entire
game.
