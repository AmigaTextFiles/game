<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Spirit of Excalibur is an epic quest to restore the grandeur and
glory of Arthur's Roundtable. To top off the excitement, the game is
accompanied by a grand Wagnerian orchestral score. You explore over
100 beautifully-illustrated unique locations and listen to the
conversations of the colorful cast of characters in this rich
adventure game.
</P>

<H2>TIPS</H2>

<H3>INTRODUCTION</H3>

<P>
Spirit of Excalibur is Virgin Mastertronic's Fantasy Role Playing
Adventure, based on Arthurian Legend, primarily after the death of
King Arthur. It is the first of a two- part series in which Sir
Constantine, the rightful successor to Arthur's throne, must use his
power and forces to gain overall control of the land of Britain and
defend his lands against the many enemies who seek to remove him and
the Round Table from power.
</P>

<P>
In Spirit of Excalibur you, the player, are the controller or
mediator of all actions made by the characters represented. You
command all of the troops and knights that have allegiance to the
Round Table. When the Round Table is presented with a problem or an
advancing enemy force, it is up to you to coordinate the actions and
movements of the Round Table troops to successfully vanquish the
foes.
</P>

<P>
The game is divided into five major episodes . Each episode has one
primary mission goal and a number of smaller additional quests to
complete. Not all of the smaller sub-quests must be finished to
successfully complete the game. However, by completing the smaller
quests you will often gain the support of kingdoms that are not part
of the Round Table allegiance. These newly acquired allies will
then reward you by lending troops to you and giving you helpful
information or items that will aid you in completing your overall
mission goal.
</P>

<P>
Throughout the five episodes, your overall goal is to rule the
entire land of Britain. After each episode is completed, you will
see a map that displays all of the lands that are under the rule of
Constantine. If, at the end of the game you have successfully
gained control of the British domain, then you truly are worthy to
be the King. Good Luck!
</P>

<H3>GENERAL STRATEGIES</H3>

<P>
At the beginning of the game, and at the beginning of each episode,
you will be shown the Round Table and all of the knights that are
present at the Table, along with some text that will inform you of
problems that are currently facing the Round Table. This text gives
you a general idea of what type of problem you are faced with. This
text is rather vague and will not give you a detailed description of
your task. To obtain the knowledge needed to complete the episode,
you must talk to the inhabitants of the land. Many of these people
will offer an interesting piece of information, while others may
know little or nothing of the happenings in the realm. Be wary,
though, as some of the people you encounter will attempt to mislead
you with their tales and others may require a few bits of coin to
aid their memory.
</P>

<P>
If, due to your meager circumstances, you are unable to bribe an
honest answer out of someone, using a charm spell cast by one of the
magic users would certainly guarantee truthful answers. Use magic
with discretion, however, as you have a limited number of spells you
can cast before needing to replenish your magical abilities. More
powerful spells require ingredients to perform, such as the shield
spell. Many of the spells are very useful, while others will serve
little purpose for you in your quests.
</P>

<P>
In episodes where you are faced with a large number of enemy forces
moving on Camelot, look throughout the map for characters whose
troops you can use. Some will not help you at all, while others
will lend you themselves and their troops if you can aid them in
some way (for example, by rescuing a kidnapped maiden for them).
Still, others will not rally behind you until you have gained the
support of others whom they respect. Once you have a sizable number
of troops to command, join them together and send them to intercept
an oncoming force before they reach Camelot, for without Camelot,
you cannot succeed.
</P>

<P>
Take heed, if a character is killed in a particular episode, you
still may be able to complete that episode, but you may not be able
to complete later episodes without him/her. A few of the very
important characters whom you should never allow to die are:
Lancelot, Merlin, Nineve, Bedivere and, of course, Sir Constantine.
If other leaders are killed, you will still be able to complete the
game, but not without some difficulties. For instance, if Sir Ector
was killed in an early episode, the troops that he would have
commanded in a later episode would no longer be a part of the Round
Table's numerous armies. With a limited number of troops to work
with, your chances of success against a formidable foe are reduced.
</P>

<P>
When a normally armed character is to battle a magical foe, use
caution. The best character to handle a magical beast is a magic
user. Only if a character is very well shielded, with magical armor
and a magical sword, will they be able to stand against an evil
creature of Satan. Take note, many helpful and important items can
be found by searching a vanquished enemy's person. Look for what
the deceased foe has dropped upon the site of his death.
</P>

<H3>COMBAT STRATEGIES</H3>

<H4>SINGLE COMBAT</H4>

<P>
There are two modes of single combat: Automatic and Manual. The
game will automatically default to Automatic mode. Your character
will fight the foe without any interference from you. To Select
Manual mode combat, you must press the space bar or click on the
automatic icon on the left side of the combat screen. This will
switch you to Manual mode. In Manual mode, the commands are
different for each type of input device, as follows: MOUSE: Left
mouse button is a an overhead blow. Right mouse button is a low
thrust. KEYBOARD: <Ins> key is an overhead blow, and the <Del> key
is a low thrust. JOYSTICK: -- Due to the variations in button
placement from two-button to two-button joysticks, you will need to
experiment to find out which button activates which maneuver. One
button will produce an overhead blow and the other button will
provide a thrusting blow.
</P>

<P>
When in manual mode, the default position is the parry position.
You will not be wounded in this position. When attempting to
attack, your chances of being hit are increased. You increase your
chances of being hit when you attempt to strike your opponent. An
overhead blow produces more damage to the opponent but leaves you
more susceptible to opposing attacks. A thrust is less effective,
but leaves you in a better position to fend off further attacks.
The most effective way to defeat an attacker is to go immediately
into Manual Mode. When your opponent tries to use an overhead blow,
immediately give him a couple of quick thrusts. If you are not able
to defeat a foe with this strategy after few attempts, you are
probably fighting someone who is impossible for you to defeat with
the character you are currently controlling.
</P>

<H4>LARGE SCALE COMBAT</H4>

<P>
There are a few strategies to work with in large scale combat. The
basic commands of large combat simulation are quite easy to
manipulate. Simply click on the character you want to move. This
will highlight the action options available for that particular
character. After selecting one of the available actions, the force
you selected will carry out the action you commanded.
</P>

<P>
If at all possible, it is best to have your troops awaiting an
oncoming force in a castle or city that has a surrounding wall. It
is much easier to defend a city from an advancing foe than to do
battle with one in the rural areas of the kingdom. Two good
examples of cities which are best to defend are London and Camelot.
If you are defending against a larger force than your own, you will
have a better kill ratio if you stay in the battle for more than a
single melee round. Unless your troops are suffering severe losses,
it is recommended that you remain in combat for at least two melee
rounds.
</P>

<P>
Another good tactic to utilize during a longer term battle is to
have a number of your knights flank your opponent. This will reduce
your kill ratio during the flanking procedure, but should greatly
increase your kill ratio when your knights fall on the enemies from
the rear. Although this maneuver may help to sway the outcome in
your favor, it is best to only use the flanking procedure during a
very large battle when you have extra knights to spare.
</P>

<P>
Although it may seem wise to have your troops divided into two or
more groups when attacking a large foe, do not use this tactic.
Because of the system design, you can only control one battle at one
time. If you have two groups trying to attack a single foe, only
one of those troops will actually attack at one time, this will
leave you will a greatly reduced number of troops and you will be
defeated rather quickly. Mass all of your men into one singular
fighting entity, then go and do battle with your enemy.
</P>

<H3>EPISODE ONE TIPS</H3>

<P>
This first episode is mainly a training episode. It allows you, the
user, to see how each icon works, how to go between the Scene Level
and the Map Level and how individual and group battles take place.
In Episode One, you are told that Sir Constantine is to be the king.
However, many knights do not feel he has the ability to be a great
leader and will not follow his commands. Constantine is in York
when a messenger tells him that he must go at once to Camelot to
answer the challenges to his sovereignty.
</P>

<P>
You will then automatically be brought to Camelot. Along the way,
you should stop to talk to the travelers, holy men, and townspeople
as they will help inform you of events taking place in the episode.
On your journey to Camelot, you will be faced with two major
challenges: first, you will confront an evil Saxon knight and
second, you will have to defend yourself against a small Saxon
force. By making noble and skilled decisions, you should easily be
able to finish this episode. Remember to gather as much information
as possible while you travel towards Camelot.
</P>

<H3>EPISODE TWO TIPS</H3>

<P>
This Episode becomes a bit more difficult. You learn of a massive
gathering of troops in the north. These troops, led by the evil
Melehan, will soon march towards Camelot. Before too long, you will
also learn that there is another large army of Saxon invaders moving
towards Camelot. You are faced with a difficult task.
</P>

<P>
When selecting the characters for this quest, it is advised to bring
two knights, the leader of which should be one of the strongest
knights at the table. Bring along the holy man and all of the items
that you can. Also, bring along the magic user and all of the
potions that she has available. Don't forget to stop by Camelot's
treasury upstairs where you can collect several items. It is very
important that the leader bring an extra shield and extra helm. The
leader is the best character to wield the powerful Runic Blade.
</P>

<P>
At the beginning of the episode, you simply do not have enough man
power to stop the advancing armies. At the Map Level, send the
troops that you command to London. There, with the aid of Sir
Lionel, you can hold off the Saxon forces. There are two other
armies at Dover and Arundel. Send two more Knights from the Round
Table to each of these cities. These knights should be well
selected. You will need a fast knight to go to Arundel and a knight
with a special potion to go to Dover. These cities each have
problems of their own and cannot lend any aid to Camelot. If you
can solve their problems, you will gain the use of the leaders and
their troops. When you gain their fealty, send the troops to
London. With these troops you should be able to defeat Arcus and
the Saxon invaders.
</P>

<P>
Even with their aid, you will find that you cannot defeat Melehan
and his huge army. There are just too many troops there to defeat.
While Constantine is a good leader of knights, you need a leader of
Armies. You must find Lancelot Du Lac! Talk to the people and the
clergy of Britain, as they will lead you to Lancelot. But, be wary
when traveling west of Camelot, for there are evil leaders who will
kill you upon your arrival. Even if you survive an initial attack,
there are still more evil beasts to face. There is even a Maiden
who desperately needs your help and you must help her or you will
suffer a great loss of nobility. However, in order to help her you
will lose valuable time. Therefore, you must find a way to aid her
but still continue on with your quest for Lancelot.
</P>

<P>
After finding find Lancelot and defeating his powerful captors, many
more troops will come under your control. Send them to fight
against Melehan. If you have found Lancelot in a reasonable amount
of time, you should be able to stop Melehan and defeat his troops
and win the episode; if not, you must find Lancelot faster. It is a
good practice to save the game often in this episode just before
each of the major confrontations.
</P>

<H3>EPISODE THREE TIPS</H3>

<P>
In Episode Three, you are faced with a giant who is protected by
magical armor who no ordinary knight stands a chance of defeating.
Not even the powerful Lancelot can defeat the giant. You must find
items that will give Lancelot the power to vanquish this magical
giant. While the giant is in Camelot, Melehan , thought to have
been killed in the previous episode, is gathering a great army.
Along with his blood brother Morgolon, Melehan and his troops plan
to again march on Camelot. At about this time, King Andred of
Cornwall will learn of the giant and Melehan's advances, and he too
will begin to attempt an invasion of the lands of Camelot.
</P>

<P>
Because the giant has challenged the knights of the Round Table, you
must select a knight to go and face him. Select only one knight
from the Round Table. When the battle begins, you must withdraw
that knight or he will most certainly be killed. As time passes
throughout the episode, other knights will go out to battle the
giant and they too must be withdrawn or will suffer a horrible
defeat. Do not allow your knights to be killed by the giant.
</P>

<P>
If any of the following characters have been killed in the previous
episode, it is strongly recommended that you replay the previous
episode and be sure to spare the lives of these nobles: Lancelot,
Dinas, Bedivere, and Nineve.
</P>

<P>
Meanwhile, Sir Lancelot and Nineve will be traveling towards
Camelot. Do not allow them to reach Camelot or they will be killed.
Intercept them and send them to the cities of the land to gather
information. Lancelot can kill the giant, but he needs magical
items to do so. Sir Lancelot and Nineve must find EXCALIBUR! Only
with this mighty sword will Sir Lancelot have any chance of
defeating the giant. The sword has been lost for years now and only
a few have clues regarding its whereabouts. Seek the help of the
clergy.
</P>

<P>
Also at the beginning of the episode, Sir Bedivere and Sir Dinas
should be returning from the treasury at Tintagel. These two have
access to powerful armor that can aid Lancelot in slaying the giant.
Send them back to Tintagel, and get the goods found there. Then,
send Sir Bedivere and Sir Dinas to look for other clues that could
help aid Lancelot in defeating the giant. Again use care, some folk
you may question are sly and deceitful.
</P>

<P>
As Lancelot and Nineve are traveling the lands, word will spread to
rival King Andred of Exeter that Camelot is besieged by the giant,
and he and his army will begin marching through the lands. King
Andred is very powerful and he carries the Gauntlets of Power. His
weaponry, combined with his unshakeable faith in his abilities as a
warrior, make him a tough adversary. However, if you can send one
of your knights to defeat him in a fight to the death, his army will
cease in its march against Camelot. Be warned, he truly is a very
admirable fighter, and your knight will need powerful weapons and
armor to defeat him.
</P>

<P>
Only Lancelot can use Excalibur, but even with this sword he may not
be able to defeat the giant. If you can aid him by supplying
additional armor, then he will certainly be able to kill the giant.
After the giant has been killed, your leaders will move out of
Camelot to gather their armies and then return. Be sure that all of
the commandable forces are at Camelot. If you can get enough forces
to Camelot in time, you should be able to defeat Morgolon and
Melehan.
</P>

<H3>EPISODE FOUR TIPS</H3>

<P>
In Episode Four, fear is spreading throughout the land and you are
told of many folk simply disappearing in the night. You must send
Knights to find out just what is causing these disappearances before
you can even find a solution to it. Among these Knights include Sir
Lancelot, Nineve, and Baudwin.
</P>

<P>
During your travels, you will find some townspeople have been turned
to stone by an enchanted being. Discover how to return them to life
and they will tell you of a creature who is roaming the lands. You
must then seek the help of the clergy. There is only one holyman
who has the right resources to tell you of this creature. Be sure
to get the book that he used to find his information, as you will
need it. He will then direct you to a scholar who knows of these
creatures and of a man who can defeat them.
</P>

<P>
As your travelers seek information, you will learn that the last
great Saxon chief is planning to move against Camelot. Again, send
all of your troops to Camelot to defend it against the Saxon hordes.
Be wary, many of the roads are filled with evil creatures and
knights. If Sir Lancelot is not available, you will have to gather
a small army to kill them. The road from Lincoln to Camelot is
heavily plagued with these evil beings, so it is a good idea to have
Lancelot clear the way before sending your troops down from Lincoln.
With the support of the Round Table troops, you should have no
problem defeating the last of the Saxon chiefs, thereby gaining
control of the last of the lands of Anglia.
</P>

<P>
The scholar will tell of an old magician who, in times gone by, was
seen in the lands of Cornwall. Go to the capital of Cornwall and
there, with a bit of persuasion, you will learn of Merlin's dwelling
and that it is he who can kill the Demons.
</P>

<P>
Many evils are lurking on the paths to Merlin's cave. Be sure to
have Lancelot lead your group as it finds its way to the coast where
Merlin is. When you find Merlin, he won't be of much help; he has
unfortunately fallen prey to a magical prison of sorts. Nineve will
speak of a Fascinum which can be used to free Merlin. For Nineve to
use this item she will, however, require a number of ingredients.
Search the map for these items and you will be able to free Merlin
from his bonds.
</P>

<P>
Once Merlin is free, he will tell you that it was Morgan who cast
the spell which imprisoned him. Only Merlin can find the point of
evil where Morgan's evil is based. The resource that you took from
the clergyman has the information needed for Merlin to defeat the
evil. Make sure Merlin has the items required to cast the necessary
spell.
</P>

<P>
Send your party of Sir Lancelot, Nineve, Merlin and Baudwin to the
point of evil. Sir Lancelot must defeat various beasts and knights
before you can reach the evil being there. After each screen, be
sure the Sir Lancelot has his full hit points before continuing on.
You can replenish his health, along with the health of all the
others by the following means: administering a healing balm or holy
water will regenerate good health as will a healing spell cast from
a magic user.
</P>

<P>
When you reach the evil spawn of hell in the upper level of the
point of evil, have Merlin cast one of the spells that he has
learned from the book on the creature and you will complete the
episode.
</P>

<H3>EPISODE FIVE TIPS</H3>

<P>
Once again, in this level, you will find that there are evil forces
working in the land. Be sure to bring only the most powerful of all
of your people to battle the Demons that are plaguing the
countryside. Have Lancelot lead with Merlin, Nineve and Baudwin
following. Be prepared to meet with many difficult foes.
</P>

<P>
There is a rogue Priest running freely in the lands whom you should
pay no attention to. There are many in the land who have been taken
away by the Demons who are roaming about the land. You must assist
the people who are in need and lead them to their kin. By helping
the distressed people you will gain their loyalty to the crown and
gather information about the other locations where evil dwells.
After you have defeated a large number of your foes, you will have
to recharge your magic users. It is wise to gather as many flasks
of Holy Water as you can as these will make defeating the Demons
much easier. Be sure you talk to the leaders after you have rescued
their kin. This is the only way to ensure their loyalty.
</P>

<P>
Once you have located the origin of the evil, you will be only
halfway through your quest. The evil Morgan is far too powerful to
defeat without the help God. You must find the holiest relic in the
realm. There are few in the realm who know anything about this
relic. Look to the wise and old woman as she may be able to aid
you. With her help and Merlin's abilities combined you should be
able to find the location of the Holy Grail. Once you have found
the Holy Grail you now must find the key that will remove it from
it's bonds.
</P>

<P>
With the Grail in hand, you now have the ability to defeat the
powerful Morgan. She is very well guarded by many Demons and
beasts. It is best to save your leader's magic powers and defeat
the beasts without the use of magic as you will need your magic when
you face the powerful Morgan.
</P>

<P>
When you have reached Morgan, you cannot just use the Holy Grail
alone to defeat her. You must first Negate all of her power. Only
then, can you rely on the power of the Grail to help you defeat
Morgan Le Fay.
</P>

<H3>POTIONS</H3>

<H4>ELIXIR OF LOFTUS</H4>

<P>
A rather rare item to be found in the game. Only one is absolutely
necessary for completion. It would be very wise to save one and
have Merlin carry it. The other, when used, will allow any
character to convince any person that he or she is that person's
absolute best friend, thus allowing a player to request any item
from a character and receive it without the need of money or the aid
of a magic user.
</P>

<H4>VITALITY POTION</H4>

<P>
Also a rather rare item, by using this potion a character's total
number of hit points will be increased by one. It is good practice
to give these potions to your lead character which should primarily
be Sir Lancelot. Give these potions to him and have him use it each
time.
</P>

<H4>HEALING BALM</H4>

<P>
An abundantly found and very useful item. Give these to the lead
character of each group. When this he/she is fighting a formidable
foe (i.e. Sir Lancelot fighting the giant or Sir Bedivere fighting
King Andred). You can select for the character to use a Healing
Balm while in the midst of battle. To do this when at the single
combat screen, select Use Item with your cursor and then select
Healing Balm from the pop-up menu. Note: you can only select the
Use Item command when you are fighting in Automatic mode! Using
this balm, in some instances, can effectively double the character's
hit points. Each one of these potions differs in its actual balm
quantity. Some may only be used once, while other may be used as
many as five times.
</P>

<H4>PROWESS POTIONS</H4>

<P>
By using this potion, you increase a character's combat skills.
This can become very important when fighting a difficult foe. Give
one of these to Bedivere early in the game, and all others to
Lancelot when you can do so.
</P>

<H4>HOLY WATER</H4>

<P>
This is a multiple-use item. Each flask can be used up to four
times. By using this item on oneself or on a non-clerical magic
user character, you will heal one hit point to that character. By
using Holy Water on an evil or clerical magic user with low faith,
you will reduce that character's health by one point, which can be
very useful when battling evil characters such as Demons or Morgan
Le Fay. This item can only be found in holy places. Sometimes a
very noble person can simply request this item, while at other times
it requires a charm spell from a magic user to convince the clergy
to part with this item. Any character can use this potion but a
magic user should never use this on themselves. Only allow a magic
user to use holy water on an evil creature or another character.
</P>

<H3>MONEY</H3>

<P>
You will soon learn that each character starts each episode with a
certain amount of gold. Regardless of how much gold a character
finds or seizes in an episode, he will start the next episode with
only his default amount of gold. It would be very wise if, when you
take gold from your treasury, you take only what you think you will
need so that you don't waste any gold when switching from one
episode to another. If you find a large quantity of gold and you
would like to be able to access this gold in the future episodes,
you can hide it behind any locked door and the gold will remain safe
there until you unlock and retake the gold.
</P>

<H3>TRADE VS. BRIBE</H3>

<P>
In this section you will learn how to get the most bang for your
buck. Depending on the number of items you wish to acquire from a
non-player character, you will want to either bribe or trade with
the holder. If the character has only one item, it is normally
cheaper for you to trade gold for it. However, if you are going to
request a number of items, it would be much wiser to bribe the
character for all of the items rather than trade for each individual
item. Most items in the game can be traded for two or three gold
pieces. However, if you are going to trade for four different
items, this can become rather expensive. If you bribe the
character, you can receive all of the items and information
available from that character for about 5 gold pieces. Using this
alternative is wise if you are looking for a larger purchase.
</P>

<P>
How do you tell if a character has more than one item available?
Just select Action and then select a character. If there is more
than one character present, select the non-player character. This
will show you a list of items that the character is holding, then
simply 'ESC' and conclude which method of transaction you will to
use.
</P>

<H3>MAGICAL ITEMS</H3>

<H4>GAUNTLETS OF POWER</H4>

<P>
These are carried by King Andred of Cornwall in Episode Three and,
when used, will double the force a blow carries when striking a foe.
The only way to get these items would be to defeat King Andred in
single combat. This is not an easy task, although still possible,
for King Andred is rather weak without the aid of the Gauntlets of
Power. Be sure to save the game before challenging him to combat.
</P>

<H4>CROWN OF COMMAND</H4>

<P>
Two of these can be found throughout the game both in Episode Two.
One is very difficult to acquire; the other is easier to obtain, but
still deadly to the characters involved. The Crowns of Command are
used at a large scale battle. To utilize the Crown of Command,
simply select the character who is carrying the item from the left
side of the battle scene, then select Use Item and then select Crown
of Command. This will make the "do round" command available,
allowing you to control the battle by melee round rather than normal
time. This will give you more time to decide where you would like
each party to move.
</P>

<H4>RUNIC BLADE</H4>

<P>
This sword can be found at the beginning of Episode Two, in the
treasury in Camelot. Whichever character you select to use this
sword will enjoy dramatically increased combat skills. It is very
wise to use this item as soon as possible.
</P>

<H4>EXCALIBUR</H4>

<P>
The great sword that Arthur wielded proudly in the years before his
death. Lost after his demise, it was returned to its previous
holder. It can only be found in Episode Three at the lake where the
Lady lives. It is imperative that you find this sword and use it.
Only Lancelot can use this sword, and he can only use it once per
episode. Thus, if you select for him to use another sword, he will
not be able to use Excalibur again until the next episode begins.
</P>

<H4>ARTHUR'S SHIELD</H4>

<P>
This is part of the magical armor that Arthur carried when he ruled
the lands. You can find it at the beginning of Episode Three in the
treasury at Tintagel. This shield will increase a character's
defensive abilities when it is used.
</P>

<H4>ARTHUR'S HELM</H4>

<P>
This item is also part of Arthur's magical armor and can be found in
Tintagel. Using these items together make a character's defensive
abilities extremely high, making a successful attack against him
very difficult. Note with caution, that after using these items, a
character will discard his original armor and use Arthur's shield
and helm instead. If you find yourself in a position where you
would like two different characters to use these items in two
separate occasions, the one who uses them first must have the means
of using another set of armor instead of Arthur's. For instance,
if, after you have Bedivere defeat King Andred, you want to give the
armor to Lancelot to aid him in defeating the giant, you must select
Bedivere to use another shield and another helm before Bedivere can
give them to Lancelot.
</P>

<H4>RING OF JOSEPH</H4>

<P>
This item can be found in Episode Five at Holyhead. This magical
ring left behind by Joseph of Arimathea, a noble man who during his
life possessed the Holy Grail, is used to open the magically locked
door where the Cup of Christ is resting.
</P>

<H4>HOLY GRAIL</H4>

<P>
The Holy Grail is found in Anguish in Episode Five and can only be
used by the most pious of holy men who manifest extremely high
levels of faith. Using the Grail is the most effective way to
defeat Morgan Le Fey, although it is not an easy task by any means.
</P>

<H3>SPELLS</H3>

<H4>NINEVE</H4>

<H5>REPLETION</H5>

<P>
Casting any spell requires the use of Magic Points. After Nineve
has exhausted all of her magic points, she can no longer cast any
spells. If you find that it is necessary for her to cast more
spells, you must send her to Stonehenge alone. Once Nineve has
reached Stonehenge, select for her to use the spell of Repletion and
her magical powers will be replenished.
</P>

<H5>SUMMON UNDINE</H5>

<P>
Excalibur has been thrown into a lake. In this lake resides the
Lady of the Lake. She is the current keeper of Arthur's great
sword. The only way to find the sword is to find the Lady of the
Lake. There are many lakes in England and once you have reached the
lake that contains Excalibur, you must command Nineve to cast this
spell to summon the Lady of the Lake, who will then give the sword
to you.
</P>

<H5>HEALING</H5>

<P>
Casting this spell on a character will increase the character's
health by one hit point. You can only increase health to that
particular characters' maximum hit point value.
</P>

<H5>CHARM</H5>

<P>
Casting this spell on most characters will convince them that you're
their best friend, which in turn will make them very accommodating.
They will give you anything they have (except gold) and tell you all
that they know.
</P>

<H5>DEFEND</H5>

<P>
For Nineve to cast this spell she must have a Bat's Wing. By
casting this spell on a character, that character's ability to
defend themselves against magical attacks is improved.
</P>

<H5>SHIELD</H5>

<P>
Nineve must have a Hell's Bane to cast this spell. By casting this
spell on a character, that character's ability to defend his or
herself against normal non-magical attacks is increased.
</P>

<H5>DISENCHANT</H5>

<P>
This spell is used in Episode Four when you run into the Stoned
people. Casting this spell on a person who has been turned to stone
will return him to his living flesh state. Doing this to a Noble
man will ensure his loyalty to the realm. Seek out all of the Noble
people who suffer from this affliction.
</P>

<H4>MERLIN</H4>

<H5>REPLETION</H5>

<P>
This spell, similar to Nineve's Shield Spell, will replenish
Merlin's magical power when performed at the place of power,
Stonehenge.
</P>

<H5>HEALING</H5>

<P>
Casting this spell on a character will increase the character's
health by one hit point. You can only increase health to the
character's maximum hit point value.
</P>

<H5>POINT OF EVIL</H5>

<P>
In Episode Four, there is great unrest regarding an evil place in
the Forest Sauvage. If you search the area, you will not be able to
find the actual place where this evil is stemming from. However, if
Merlin casts the Point of Evil spell when you return to the Map
Level, you will see a castle of ruins in the midst of the forest.
Only with this spell will you be able to locate the evil place in
Episode Four.
</P>

<H5>NOMED NOMMUS</H5>

<P>
If Merlin casts this spell in the presence of a Demon, the Demon
will be killed. If you look carefully you will see that the Nomed
Nommus is simply Summon Demon spelled backwards. This is the most
effective way of defeating a Demon, although it does require a large
amount of Magic and a Belladonna every time that it is cast.
</P>

<H5>NEGRA POTIS</H5>

<P>
Casting this spell on a magic user will negate all power that magic
user has for ten seconds real time. It will also negate the power
of all other magic users in the room. The only type of magic that
is not affected by this spell is clerical magic. This very powerful
spell requires a number of items to cast: a portion of Holy Water,
a Fyrd's Stone, and an Elixir of Loftus. Use this spell against
Morgan Le Fey as this is the only way you will have a chance of
launching a successful attack against her.
</P>

<H5>NOSTRA PORTALIS</H5>

<P>
This spell is a bit of a red herring. There is no absolute need to
cast this spell anywhere in the game. However, doing so may bring
about some interesting results. Casting this spell will open a hole
to the dark world. If a hole like this is opened there is a chance
a Demon may find his way through the hole and into the lands of
Britain.
</P>

<H4>LANCELOT</H4>

<P>
Lancelot starts each episode with 5 magical points. Although he has
no spell casting abilities, there is a need for these magic points.
Using Excalibur requires exactly five magic points. Thus Sir
Lancelot can only use Excalibur once per Episode. If you give
Excalibur to another character after Lancelot has used it, Lancelot
will not be able to use the sword again until the next episode when
his magic points are naturally regenerated. It would be wise to
reserve the sword for Lancelot's exclusive use throughout the entire
game.
</P>

<H2>EPISODE SOLVES</H2>

<H3>EPISODE ONE</H3>

<P>
Episode One is rather easy to complete. To assist the player in
future levels, there are a few items hidden throughout this episode
that will become very valuable for the player in later episodes.
Your primary objective for this level is to move from York to
Camelot without being killed. On your journey you must prove
yourself a worthy successor of King Arthur by doing noble deeds and
acts.
</P>

<P>
When you start the game, you will be told of the current status of
Camelot and its surrounding lands. Then you will see a graphic of a
King Clariance speaking to Sir Constantine, telling him that he must
go to Camelot and claim his rightful throne. After reading this
text, click past it and you will automatically go to the Map Level
where you will see Sir Constantine again, automatically moving
towards Camelot. On your way, you will meet with different
characters at towns and on pathways. It is not necessary to talk to
all of the people you meet, but it is a good idea if you are new to
the game.
</P>

<P>
Upon reaching Lincoln, you will be challenged to a fight to the
death against an evil knight named Lupinus (see Single Combat
Strategies). If you defeat Lupinus, you will gain the fealty of Sir
Villars and his troops in future episodes. To be considered a
worthy King, you must be able to defeat an evil knight such as
Lupinus.
</P>

<P>
After defeating Lupinus, go to the Map Level and where you will
again see Sir Constantine moving toward Camelot. Approximately
halfway to Leicester, you will be met by Sir Bellengerus and his
troops. If you join with them, they will escort you to Camelot.
</P>

<P>
You should now be able to see another icon moving on the screen. If
you are unable to see another icon, move the cursor to the bottom of
the screen. This will force the map to scroll down, the direction
in which your characters are traveling. This other icon is Andulf,
a Saxon leader along with his troops who are moving against
Leicester. When Andulf and his troops reach Leicester, you will be
prompted to view or ignore a battle about to take place there. If
you view it, you will not be allowed to control any of the
characters moving; thus, it is recommended that you ignore the
battle unless you would like to view how a large scale battle works.
After joining with Sir Bellengerus, you will automatically move
towards Leicester. Upon reaching Leicester, your troops will attack
Andulf and you will again be prompted to view the battle. You
should be able to defeat Andulf rather easily. If you are prompted
to fall back to the walls due to heavy troop losses, select no and
you will continue fighting until you have defeated Andulf (see also
Large Scale Combat Strategies). Once you have defeated Andulf, you
will gain the fealty of Sir Gahalantine. These two acts of Nobility
will ensure your position as a worthy successor to King Arthur.
</P>

<P>
By returning to the Map Level, you with see that your group will
again be moving towards Camelot. You should intercept them by
selecting the horse icon. This will change your pointer to a red
arrow. Place the red arrow over the shield icon of Sir Constantine
and his group (Sir Constantine has a blue shield with three white
chevrons across it). Doing this will change your pointer to a red
arrow with a the word TO next to the arrow. Place the icon over the
town of Water Newton (Water Newton is just to the right of
Leicester). This command will send your group to Water Newton.
</P>

<P>
Once in Water Newton, you will meet with a Healer who has a few
items your future parties may need. Since the Healer has a number
of items that you will require from him, you should bribe him with
five gold pieces and select for Constantine to request each item
from the Healer. You will not be able to retrieve the gold you have
given him. Return to the Map Level and send your characters to
Rochester. Rochester is almost straight south of Water Newton,
approximately in the middle of your map. Moving these characters
will now require a slightly different command sequence. Because Sir
Constantine is at a city with another Round Table knight, you must
select the "G" or horse icon, select or click on the city that the
characters are in, and select or click on Sir Constantine from the
list of characters. Next, select or click on the city you which to
send the characters to, which is Rochester. Now, because Sir
Bellengerus and his troops are followers of Sir Constantine, they
will follow Sir Constantine to their common destination of
Rochester.
</P>

<P>
In Rochester, you will meet another Healer, who, again, will have
some items for you. Select Constantine to bribe the Healer with
five gold pieces and request each item from the Healer. Return to
the Map Level and send your characters to Salisbury. Salisbury is
just to the left of Camelot on your game map.
</P>

<P>
In Salisbury, Constantine will meet with an Apothecary. Have
Bellengerus give all of his gold to Constantine. Why? Because this
will make it easier for one character to hand out all of the items
in forthcoming episodes. Again, select Constantine to bribe the
Apothecary and request each of the items. When finished with this
task, feel free to travel the countryside, familiarizing yourself
with all of the different locations on your map.
</P>

<P>
Now send Constantine to Camelot where he will be met by a guard.
After speaking with the guard, select the GATE icon to go inside
where Sir Bedivere awaits you to give you the final text of the
episode. If you have successfully completed the previous
instructions, you will have won the episode. If you have made a
mistake, you will have to repeat the episode from the start until
you have gained a higher level of Nobility.
</P>

<H3>EPISODE TWO</H3>

<P>
NOTE: This episode may become a bit confusing as different
characters arrive at different locations at nearly the same time.
The movements of characters has been segmented to avoid a rash of
multiple messages which are character specific or character related.
Depending on your efficiency to initiate commands which halt time
relative to actions, there is a possibility that numerous different
characters will arrive in different locations and that these
different characters will require specific commands that may confuse
a novice user. To reduce confusion, read ahead through this episode
walk-through and familiarize yourself with each character's starting
place, destination and objective.
</P>

<P>
At the beginning of Episode Two, you will be shown a picture of the
Round Table and a few different knights. The knights that are
present are the only ones who are following the leadership of King
Constantine. You are told of great unrest in the northern regions
of the realm, and that someone must go and investigate the problem.
Melehan is moving towards Camelot. He and his troops are coming to
avenge his father's death. Not only are these men moving against
you, there is a large group of murderous Saxons moving through the
land as well. With the number of troops that you now command, you
have a very slim (or nil) chance of defeating both of these foes.
You are going to require the help of a great leader. The only man
known in the realm who possesses such a high level of leadership
abilities is Lancelot Du Lac. Once you have found Lancelot, many of
the other leaders and their troops will join him again in Camelot.
This episode is a true test of a player's skills. It would be wise
to begin saving the game frequently.
</P>

<P>
Begin by selecting Sir Bedivere to lead a party. Do not select any
other knights to follow him; we will use them shortly. After you
have selected Bedivere to lead, select the finished icon on the
bottom right area of the screen (or select 'f' from the keyboard).
You will now be in the main hall of Camelot. Go to the chapel where
you will meet with a holy man named Baudwin. He will offer a few
items to you. Select the Holy Water. He will now ask if you would
like him to join you. Select Join Party. After selecting for
Baudwin to Join Party, you will again be in the main hall of
Camelot. Return to the chapel and have Bedivere pick up the rest of
the items there. Now, click on the left side of the screen to go
back to the main hall. Next, you shall go to the Enchanter's Lab.
</P>

<P>
Click on the staircase in the main hall to go to the Enchanter's
Lab. Here you will meet with Nineve, who was a pupil of Merlin's
before his disappearance. Select Vitality Potion and Prowess Potion
from the items she will offer you. She will then ask if she can
join you on your quest. Again, select for Nineve to Join Party.
Have Nineve pick up the Bat's Wing, Belladonna and Elixir of Loftus.
Select for Bedivere to pick up the Healing Balm. Do not have any
character pick up the Dragon's Bane; instead, leave it in the lab
for now. Next ,you will go to the Treasury room by clicking on the
staircase in the background of the Enchanter's Lab. You will now be
in the entrance to the Treasury. There is a key and a knife here.
The knife is not needed to complete the game and should be left
there. The key opens the door on the right side of the room, but
leave it here for now. Nineve has a key already in her inventory,
so you may select for her to USE the key. After she has unlocked
the door, click on the area of the open door and you will enter the
Treasury. Once in the Treasury, have Sir Bedivere pick up the helm,
the Runic Blade, the shield and 30 gold pieces. Have Sir Bedivere
'USE' the Runic Blade. This will give him the added power that the
blade holds. Now have Nineve pick up the Fascinum Terrere ,the
Fascinum Laxus and the Fyrd's Stone. You are now finished with the
first part of character set-up and it is time to select the map
icon. The characters who are led by Sir Bedivere will now
automatically travel to Salisbury where they will meet with a guard.
It is not necessary to stop and talk to the guard, but if you feel
an urge to do so, then so be it.
</P>

<P>
You must now prepare another character for a different sub-task.
Select the Magnify action and move the cursor over to Camelot. Use
the Gate Icon to go inside and click on the left side of the screen
to go to the Round Table. Select Ector to lead a new party. From
the main hall, go to the Enchanter's Lab and have Ector pick up the
Dragon's Bane. From here, go up to the Treasury entrance and have
Sir Ector pick up the key, use the key and then drop the key.
Proceed to enter the Treasury. Command Sir Ector to pick up 20 gold
pieces. Select the Map Icon and Ector will now go to Salisbury
where Bedivere and his party are. When Ector arrives, DO NOT join
with Sir Bedivere. Instead, select to continue on or stop and talk
if you would like to view the scene. If you continue on past
Bedivere, also continue past the townsman.
</P>

<P>
It is time to start moving some of your characters to more strategic
positions throughout the land. Use the "G" command (or click on the
horse and rider icon), and send Sir Gahalantine and troops from
Leicester to London on your map. Again, select "G" or applicable
icon and send Villars and his troops from Lincoln to London. Rather
than entering Camelot at this point, just use the 'G' command to
send Sir Lavain from Camelot to Arundel. Sir Baldric has a small
problem which he will inform you of when Lavain reaches Arundel.
Send Sir Ector, who should by now be in Salisbury, to Dover, which
is on the eastern most side of the map slightly below the middle of
the map. Now, send Sir Melias, who is in Camelot, to Dorchester.
</P>

<P>
The characters you have commanded are going to start arriving in
various locations rather quickly. If you carried out the directions
accurately, they should arrive in the following order. Lavain will
reach Arundel, where he will meet with Sir Baldric. Stop and talk
to Sir Baldric. Sir Baldric explains that his daughter has been
kidnapped and that he cannot help the Round Table forces until her
safe return. After clicking past this text, you will be
automatically sent back to the Map Level. There will now be a new
icon just north of Arundel. This is Cynewulf, another Saxon.
Quickly select the GO icon and then click on Lavain at Arundel.
Next, click on the icon of Cynewulf. Sir Lavain will now seek
Cynewulf. Choose Lavain to go to Arundel earlier because Sir Lavain
is fast and will catch Cynewulf before he has a chance to escape.
Now would be a good time to save the game.
</P>

<P>
Sir Ector will encounter a traveler. It is not necessary for you to
stop and talk to this traveler as he will only tell you of a group
of Saxons that are gathering in East Anglia. Be careful when
traveling north. Sir Ector will now continue on his way to Dover.
</P>

<P>
Send Baudwin to Almesbury to build his faith, for he has a great
task to perform at the end of the last episode.
</P>

<P>
Send Sir Bedivere and his followers to Dorchester, now trailing
behind Sir Melias. We sent these two different groups to the same
place for a reason that will come up soon enough.
</P>

<P>
Now, Sir Lavain should catch up with Cynewulf. If, by chance, Sir
Ector runs across Cynewulf prior to Sir Lavain catching him, stop
and restore your latest saved game. Sir Lavain must be the one who
kills Cynewulf. Go There and fight Cynewulf. If you defeat him,
Sir Baldric's daughter will say that you must get word to her
father. If you do not defeat him, you must replay a previously
saved game until you do defeat him. After reading what the daughter
has said, return to the Map Level where you find the daughter now
leading Sir Lavain to Arundel.
</P>

<P>
At about this time Sir Gahalantine will be reaching London. When he
does, he will be met by Sir Lionel. Do not stop and talk to Sir
Lionel. He will just speak of his problems and why he cannot help
the Round Table forces.
</P>

<P>
Sir Melias should now reach Dorchester where he will be met by a
knight who will challenge him to a contest of arms. Decline this
challenge. Sir Melias has a very difficult task ahead of him in
which he will need all of his hit points to survive. As soon as he
arrives, send him to the point between Bath and Ilchester, at the
'T" in the road that leads to Glastonbury. We have sent Sir Melias
ahead, because he will meet with a maiden here whom we don't want
Sir Bedivere to meet.
</P>

<P>
Sir Bedivere will arrive at Dorchester about now and be met by the
same knight. Continue on past the knight and send Sir Bedivere
north and just slightly east to the edge of the tree line. Be sure
to save now. When Sir Bedivere sights the Fell Beast and prepares
for single combat select Go There. Sir Bedivere, with the aid of
the Runic Blade, should be able to kill the Fell Beast without too
much trouble. If he dies, restore your saved game and play it until
you can defeat the Fell Beast. During battle, if Sir Bedivere is
taking a large amount of damage, have him use a Healing Balm during
the battle. You need him fairly healthy in the near future, so if
you are having a very difficult time defeating this Fell Beast, just
continue on through the game. You do not have to kill this beast to
win the game. Just be sure that you have a good amount of distance
between Sir Bedivere and Sir Melias and send Sir Bedivere to
Glastonbury following Sir Melias. After killing the Fell Beast,
Select Sir Bedivere to pick up all he can see. Once you have done
this Search the Fell Beast until you find the Crown of Command,
which is useful when in the midst of a large scene battle. As soon
as you have returned to the Map Level, send Sir Bedivere to
Glastonbury (if you haven't already done so).
</P>

<P>
When the daughter reaches Arundel, she will meet with her father Sir
Baldric. Stop and talk to him and he will give his fealty to you
and the Round Table forces for saving his daughter. You will now be
automatically returned to the Map Level. Select Sir Baldric and
send he and his troops to London.
</P>

<P>
Sir Melias will encounter a maiden and you will automatically be
brought to the Scene Level where she will ask for your aid in
rescuing her sister from the evil knight who is holding her captive.
Select to Assist the maiden and she will lead Sir Melias to Lyonesse
Castle.
</P>

<P>
When Sir Ector reaches Dover, Magnify in on the castle and go
inside. Once inside, you will be met by Sir Palomides who will
challenge Sir Ector to a contest of arms. Decline his challenge.
Sir Palomides will also speak of a foul beast that is now plaguing
the roads leaving Dover. You will automatically be returned to the
Map Level. Next send Sir Ector slightly east of Dover where he will
meet with a Fell Beast. Go there to view the battle. As soon as
the battle begins, select Use Item and have Sir Ector use the
Dragon's Bane on the Fell Beast. You will be pleasantly surprised.
Once the beast is dead, return to the Map Level and send Sir Ector
back to Dover. Again in Dover, go inside and decline the contest of
arms. Sir Palomides will now give his loyalty to the crown. Send
he and his knights to London. Also, send Sir Ector to Rochester.
He will be traveling now to seek some more items.
</P>

<P>
When Sir Villars and Sir Baldric reach London, have them all join
together. As you may have noticed, there is a new icon moving
closer to London. This a Saxon leader named "Arcaus". You will
soon be in a large scale battle with these two groups. Sir
Palomides should also be able to reach London before Arcaus. Again,
have him join with all of the others there.
</P>

<P>
When Sir Bedivere reaches Glastonbury, Magnify on the holy grounds
and go inside. Once inside, you will meet with a man named Sir Bors
who is a holy man, and also a knight of the Round Table. He is a
difficult man and will not be willing to give you any good
information about Lancelot at this time. You are going to have to
take more drastic measures. Have Nineve use her magic to charm Sir
Bors. He will then be a bit more willing to talk to you. After
gaining this newly found knowledge, send Sir Bedivere and Nineve to
Cardiff.
</P>

<P>
By now, Arcaus should have reached London. Go to the battle and
take note of the actions going on there. Fall back to the walls if
you are prompted to do so. It may take a couple of rounds, but you
will defeat him. Once you have fallen back to the walls, be sure to
keep moving your characters that are on the map but not engaged in
the battle. Now would be a good time to read ahead a couple of
pages to know what to do with your characters once they begin
arriving at their various destinations. Also, keep a close eye on
your leaders. If one or more of them take more than two hits of
damage, be sure and retreat them from the battle. By defeating
Arcaus, you will gain the fealty of Sir Lionel who now believes in
the power of the Round Table.
</P>

<P>
Sir Ector will reach Rochester sometime during the battle with
Arcaus and his Saxon hordes, and he will be met by a townsman.
Continue past the townsman and wait until the battle with the Saxons
is over. Then, send Sir Ector to the small hut with is due north at
the top of the lands of East Anglia.
</P>

<P>
Once Sir Bedivere reaches Cardiff, he will be met by an old woman
who will tell him that the master is not home and that she does not
know when he will return. Maybe a little monetary compensation
would aid her memory. Bribe her with 5 gold pieces and she will
tell you of a man named Grud who is at Caerwent. This is the guide
that Sir Bors was speaking of. Send Sir Bedivere to Caerwent. Once
there, stop and talk to Grud. He will also require a small donation
of 5 gold pieces before he gives you some worthwhile information.
Not only will he be willing to tell you that his master has traveled
north, but also that he himself has a key that you will need. Have
Sir Bedivere request this key and return to Cardiff. This would be
a good time to save. Sir Melias is approaching Lyonesse Castle and
you will have a very tough fight ahead of you.
</P>

<P>
Sir Bedivere will again reach Cardiff. This time go inside the
castle where you will find a golden chalice and a locked door. Have
Nineve take the chalice, and command Sir Bedivere to open the door
with the gold key that he received from Grud. Go inside the room
that was locked and you will find a map and the Livre D'Sangrail, a
book which speaks of the many tales of the Grail. Have Nineve pick
up both of these items. If you use this map, it will show you where
Lancelot was going, to a destination some distance north of here,
which we have not seen before. If you return to the Map Level, you
will find a new castle between the castle of Chester and the kingdom
of York. Send Sir Bedivere to that location which is Morgolon's
Castle.
</P>

<P>
Sir Melias will soon reach Lyonesse castle. Outside of the Castle
is a powerful and evil knight named Morwick. You must do battle
with Morwick to save the Damsel whom he is holding. This is
extremely difficult and may take a few attempts, but is very
important that you complete this rescue if you want to control all
of the lands at the end of the game. If you can kill Morwick, you
are indeed a worthy fighter, for the ignoble Morwick will usually
run from combat when he realizes that he is about to be beaten.
Once you have defeated him, go inside where the Damsel is. As your
reward, she will give you a flask of Healing Balm and also control
of her lands in the area of Cornwall. Having taken the Healing
Balm, return to the Map Level and send Sir Melias back to
Dorchester.
</P>

<P>
When Sir Ector reaches the small hut, you should stop and talk to
the old crone. She will have little information for you, but she
will have a portion of Bat's Wing that you will need. You should
trade her two of your gold pieces in exchange for her Bat's Wing.
After acquiring the Bat's Wing, send Sir Ector to Water Newton.
</P>

<P>
Sir Bedivere will arrive at Morgolon's Castle and be met by two
guards. Go there and kill the two guards. Continue on inside,
where you will be met by two more guards. Have Sir Bedivere kill
these two guards as well. If you haven't saved recently, go back to
the Map Level and save the game. Now, go upstairs inside Morgolon's
Castle where you will find a brass key. Pick up this key and again
go upstairs. Next, you will be faced by a difficult opponent, a
Necromancer, who is a powerful magic user. You should be able to
defeat him if Sir Bedivere can strike the first blow; if not, be
prepared for a tough battle. Once you have defeated the
Necromancer, use the key to open the door. Inside you will find
Lancelot, who has been held captive by the Necromancer.
</P>

<P>
After saving Sir Lancelot, he will again rejoin the Round Table
forces, bringing with him a large number of his followers. After
reading some of his text, you will be returned to the Map Level,
where you will see a large number of icons now moving towards
Camelot. Intercept the following knights and send them to London:
Sir Galihodin, Sir Nerovens, Sir Balamore, and Sir Sadok. Send all
of the other new icons to Camelot except for Sir Lancelot. Send Sir
Lancelot to Salisbury, where he will meet a few of the other
knights. You now have a very large group of forces going to
Camelot, many of whom will meet with travelers and others on their
journey. Send your forces on to London. Once your individual
forces begin to arrive in London, have them all join with one
another.
</P>

<P>
Once you have all of your forces moving in the right direction, send
Bedivere to Cardiff. When Sir Ector reaches Cardiff, send him on to
Carmarthen to acquire some necessary items. Pay attention! You
will only be prompted that Sir Bedivere has reached Cardiff and then
you will see many messages coming up regarding troop movement
throughout the lands. Check to be sure that Ector is still moving
towards Water Newton, as he has a tendency to become lost in the
vast lands of the Round Table. Once Ector reaches Water Newton, he
will be met by a healer. Trade two gold pieces for the Healing Balm
that she has and then send Ector to Brough-on-Humber, just north of
Water Newton. Once in Brough-on-Humber, Sir Ector will meet with an
Herbalist. Again, trade with the Herbalist for the Healing Balm.
By now, Melehan should be almost to Lincoln, so be very careful when
moving Sir Ector. If Melehan meets with Sir Ector, he will have Sir
Ector killed. Sir Ector's journey is now finished and we will send
him to meet with Sir Lancelot and give him the items that he has
gotten on his travels. Next, send Sir Ector to London and then
onward to Salisbury where he will meet with Sir Lancelot.
</P>

<P>
Sir Melias should now have reached Dorchester. You may have him
fight with the guard now if you so please, but, when he has finished
with his squirmish, move him on to Salisbury where Lancelot should
be awaiting him. Once Melias reaches Salisbury, do not join him
with Sir Lancelot. Instead, stop and talk to Sir Lancelot. On the
Scene Level, have Sir Melias give the Healing Balm he acquired from
the damsel to Sir Lancelot and then send Sir Melias on to Camelot.
</P>

<P>
When Sir Bedivere reaches Carmarthen, he will be met by an
Apothecary, stop and talk to the Apothecary and bribe him for the
items that he has. After acquiring these three items, send him to
Cardiff and then on to the second small hut on the trail to
Salisbury. Once at the hut, trade with the old crone for the
Belladonna and send Sir Bedivere to Salisbury to meet with Sir
Lancelot. When Sir Bedivere arrives in Salisbury have him give the
following items to Sir Lancelot: Vitality Potion, Prowess potion,
all of the Healing Balms and Holy Water. Now have Sir Bedivere give
to Nineve the Belladona, the Mandrake, and the Hellsbane. These
items will be required for Nineve to cast certain spells in the
future.
</P>

<P>
King Constantine should now be sent to Salisbury to meet with Sir
Lancelot. Upon the King's arrival, select for him give to Lancelot
both of his Vitality Potions and both of his Healing Balms. Now,
have King Constantine give Nineve both of the Hellsbanes, the Bat's
Wing and the Belladonna. When you have completed the above actions
have Sir Lancelot use all three of the Vitality Potions and the
Prowress Potion. After having completed this, send all of the
members of the group to Camelot.
</P>

<P>
You should now be awaiting the arrival of Melehan, along with a
large group of evil knights he is commanding. Check to be sure that
each of the following knights and their troops are in London: Sir
Nerovens, Sir Balamoure, Sir Galihodin, Sir Palomides, Sir
Gahalantine, Sir Baldric, Sir Villars, Sir Lionel and finally, Sir
Sadok. If any of these knights are not present ,find them on the
map and send them to London. However, if all of these knights as
present, simply wait until Melehan and his troops arrive. With this
sizable group, you should be able to defeat him in just a couple of
Rounds. After doing so, you will have completed this episode.
Congratulations, you have just completed the most difficult episode
of the game.
</P>

<H3>EPISODE THREE</H3>

<P>
Before the start of Episode Three, you will see a cliff hanger of a
giant outside of Camelot. This giant has magical armor and can not
be killed by feeble non-magical attacks. Lancelot alone cannot
defeat this foe. He will need to use a magical item which allows
him to defeat magical beings. Lancelot must find Excalibur. Only
then will he stand a chance of defeating the giant. By doing so, he
will release all of the knights that are now held in Camelot. At
the start of this episode, you must choose a character to meet with
the giant. You can select any one of the characters displayed.
Once you have done so, go to the Map Level where you will be
prompted to view the battle. Always view the battles with the
giant. As soon as the fighting begins at the battle scene, select
for the character to withdraw from the combat, as only Lancelot can
defeat this creature. If you let other knights do battle with the
Giant, they will all be killed. Therefore, be sure to have them all
withdraw until Sir Lancelot brings Excalibur to slay the beast with.
</P>

<P>
At the start of the episode, select Lionel to face the foe. Again,
go straight to the Map Level. Immediately withdraw from the combat
when you meet with the Giant. Withdrawing will make Sir Lionel
suffer a loss of nobility, but this way he will keep his life.
</P>

<P>
Meanwhile, back at the Map Level, you will find that Sir Bedivere
and Sir Dinas are in the Dorchester area and that there are Bandits
close by. Send Bedivere north about a inch on the map until the
Bandits have passed and then send he and Sir Dinas to Tintagel.
</P>

<P>
Just north of Camelot, you will also find Sir Lancelot and Nineve
traveling towards Camelot. You must not allow them to reach
Camelot. They must be intercepted and sent to St. Albans.
</P>

<P>
Soon, you will learn that Melehan is again moving towards Camelot
starting in York, forcing King Clariance to flee from his realm.
This is yet another reason why you must defeat the giant, so that
you can free your knights and get them organized to defeat Melehan
before he can reach Camelot. There are also many groups of Bandits
running across the lands but, at this point, they do not present a
direct problem to the Round Table forces. Although these vermin can
kill any traveler and destroy many towns, they will not attack
Camelot.
</P>

<P>
Sir Lancelot should reach St. Albans where he will meet with a
townsman who will inform him that the Friar is not in and that he is
at Canterbury visiting the Arch Bishop. Send Sir Lancelot to
Canterbury. Do not send Nineve with him. Once Sir Lancelot's icon
begins to move, intercept it and send Nineve back to St. Albans.
She will again meet with the townsman who only has the same
information as before. Thus, it is recommended that you continue
past him and wait for Sir Lancelot to reach Canterbury.
</P>

<P>
Once Sir Lancelot reaches Canterbury, he will meet with the
Archbishop Dubric. Dubric will inform you that although the church
holds many relics of power, he has none that could be used against a
giant. He also tells you that Friar Albert has just left to return
to St. Albans. Go back to the Map Level and send Sir Lancelot to
Cambridge.
</P>

<P>
Now Magnify on St. Albans. Nineve, who is still there, will meet
and talk with Friar Albert. At this time, the Friar does not find
Nineve noble enough to go find the sword of Excalibur, let alone
wield it. A bit of magical persuasian would make him much more
willing to give you all of his information. However, as much as the
Friar is respected as a knowledgeable person, this time his
information is not exactly correct. Send Nineve directly to
rendezvous with Sir Lancelot at Cambridge.
</P>

<P>
By now, Sir Bedivere and Sir Dinas should have arrived at the
Treasury at Tintagel. Go inside of Tintagel, where you will see a
locked door. It just so happens that Sir Bedivere now has a new
iron key in his inventory. Have Sir Bedivere use this key and then
go in to the Treasury room. Inside, you will find Arthur's Shield
and Arthur's Helm. Have Sir Bedivere pick up and use both of these.
Once you have completed these actions, send Sir Bedivere to Exeter
to await Kind Andred's attack against the Round Table forces.
</P>

<P>
If Sir Lancelot reaches Cardiff first, he will be challenged to a
contest of arms by the guard there. Do not accept this challenge
unless you have a recent saved game. It is very easy to kill this
guard, but if you do you cannot get the very important information
that he has. The guard will tell you of a few places that would be
a fitting resting place for the magical blade. Once you have this
information, wait for the other character to arrive and join with
him/her. Now send Sir Lancelot and his companion to the east edge
of the small lake, which is just north of Oxford. Be sure that they
do not actually reach the lake itself.
</P>

<P>
On your way out of Cambridge, your characters will meet with a
traveler. This traveler will tell of Kind Andred, who is now
beginning to move against the Round Table. If Sir Bedivere has not
yet reached Exeter, you will have to select for him to seek King
Andred. Be sure and save before you do battle with King Andred. He
carries a pair of the Gauntlets of Power, which make every attack
twice as powerful as normal. With these gloves, he will be a worthy
opponent for Sir Bedivere, even if Bedivere is wearing Arthur's
magical armor. Once you have caught and defeated King Andred, his
troops, who hold little respect for the ignoble king, will stop
their advance and allow King Constantine to rule their lands. Now,
search the body of King Andred until you find both the Gauntlets of
Power and a brass key.
</P>

<P>
Once you have the key and the Guantlets, go to Exeter. Inside the
back of the castle, you will find a locked door. Use the brass key
to gain access to the room and get the Dragon's Bane, the gold, and
the Fryd's Stone, which are locked in the Treasury there. Once you
have these, send Sir Bedivere to the small lake where Nineve and
Lancelot are waiting. Be wary of the Bandits that are moving across
the lands in that area. If you are caught by the Bandits, both Sir
Dinas and Sir Bedivere will be killed, making the completion of this
episode virtually impossible.
</P>

<P>
Upon reaching the small lake, Sir Bedivere will encounter a Fell
Beast. Go there and use the Dragon's Bane to defeat the beast.
Return to the Map Level and have Sir Lancelot and Nineve go to the
small lake and meet with the others. When Sir Lancelot and Sir
Bedivere meet, you will be prompted to join, continue or stop and
talk to them. Stop and talk so that you can go to the Scene Level
and recover the lost sword, Excalibur. At the Scene Level, select
for Nineve to use magic and cast the Sumon Undine spell. This will
awaken the Lady of the Lake, who will give the sword to you. After
the animation of the sword coming out of the water, Magnify on the
small lake and have Sir Bedivere use the shield and the helm that
are in his inventory. Now, have Sir Bedivere give the following to
Sir Lancelot: Excalibur, Arthur's Shield, Arthur's Helm, and the
Guants D'Poeir. Lancelot should now use each of the items to
increase his attack and defense abilities to a level high enough to
defeat the giant. Next, have Sir Bedivere give 20 gold pieces and
the Fryd's Stone to Nineve. Once you have completed this task, send
Sir Lancelot and Nineve to Camelot to battle with the giant. Also,
send Sir Bedivere along with Sir Dinas to Cardiff. Again, be
careful of the Bandits that are traveling the lands.
</P>

<P>
Once you have defeated the giant, all of the people that are trapped
inside Camelot are going to begin to move to their respective
castles to gather troops to defend Camelot against the forces of
Melehan and Morgolon, who are slowly moving closer to Camelot. Once
again, there will be a large number of people moving at the same
time, so be sure that you get all of the troops to their correct
locations and back. As each knight reaches his castle, he will meet
with several knights or soldiers. Join with the soldiers and send
each Round Table knight and his troops to London. This is where you
will again stand against Melehan's army. Some of your knights will
meet with one another on their way to each castle. Do not allow
them to join with one another, or you will not have the total number
of forces needed to defeat Melehan.
</P>

<P>
Also at this time, send King Constantine to London where he must
meet with King Clairance. Be sure King Constantine meets with King
Clairance and stops to talk to him. He has a very important subject
to speak about. Sir Galihodin and his men are now also able to
move. Send them to Glouchester. Just to the west of Glouchester is
a group of soldiers who do not at this time have a leader. Send
them to Glouchester to meet and join with Sir Galihodin. After they
have joined, send them to London. The forces gathered there will
probably need their aid.
</P>

<P>
While all of these troops are moving about, start to collect some
more items. Sir Bedivere will reach Cardiff. After he and Dinas
arrive, send them on to Carmarthen, where they will meet with an
Apothecary who has a number of items that will come in handy. Bribe
the Apothecary for all of the items that he has.
</P>

<P>
Before Melehan reaches London, be sure to save your game. You
should now be able to defeat him with the number of troops you have
there. If you seem to be losing a large number of troops, fall back
to the walls and wait for the large group of forces coming with Sir
Galihodin. Once you have defeated Melehan and Morgolon, you will
have won the episode, and prevented these two from ever moving
against Camelot again.
</P>

<H3>EPISODE FOUR</H3>

<P>
At the begining of Episode Four, you are told about strange
disappearances occuring thoughout the realm. Many townspeople and a
number of Knights have strangely vanished in the Forest Savauge.
Someone must go and find the cause of these disappearances. Select
Lancelot to lead, with no other knights to follow him. You do not
have to have Baudwin join with you at this time, so just continue
straight up to the Enchanter's lab where you will meet with Nineve
again. When you greet Nineve, request the Dragon's Bane and the
Prowess Potion from her. Now have Sir Lancelot pick up the healing
balm and Nineve pick the Fascinum Tererre there. Go to the treasury
and pick up another 30 gold pieces to help persuade some of the
characters you will soon come across. Once you have done this, you
are ready to go to the Map Level and start shuffling some troops
around.
</P>

<P>
First order of business is to send Baudwin to Almesbury to continue
his studies of the Lord. Now, hearing rumors of another Saxon force
readying to move against Camelot, it is recommended that you move a
number of troops to Camelot to defend it against an upcoming attack.
You must defend Camelot directly because there are a number of
random attack routines built into the system for the last Saxon
battle. Send the following groups to Camelot: Sir Baldric from
Arundel, Sir Palomides from Dover and Sir Lionel from London. Once
again, send Sir Galihodin to Gloucester to meet with the leaderless
knights from Carlion. There are also a number of troops with Sir
Villars in Leicester, but the road from Camelot to Leicester is
heavily plagued with beasts that must be cleared away before Sir
Villars and his men can move down it. Along with Nineve, send Sir
Lancelot north to Leicester via London route to help clear the way
for Sir Villars and his troops. You will meet with many different
foes who will challenge you to a fight to the death on the way. Sir
Lancelot should be able to defeat these opponents without much
difficulity. Once Sir Lancelot reaches Leicester do not join with
Sir Villars. Instead, send Sir Villars to Camelot to help defend
against the soon to be moving Saxon force.
</P>

<P>
Now send Sir Lancelot and Nineve to Water Newton to meet with an
unfortunate townsman who has been turned to stone. Select Nineve to
disenchant the townsman. The townsman will now tell you of a Demon
who came to him and with a wave of his clawed hand turned him to
stone. You will have to visit Arch Bishop Dubric again in
Canterbury to gain more information about Demons and how to defeat
them. Before returning to Canterbury, stop by the hut just to the
northeast and stop to speak with the old crone. Now, have Sir
Lancelot bribe the old crone and collect the three items she is
holding. Give the Hellsbane and the Belladonna to Nineve, and have
Sir Lancelot keep the Dragon's Bane for his own use.
</P>

<P>
Send Sir Lancelot and Nineve south to Canterbury via London. You
must Magnify and go inside of Canterbury to meet with the Arch
Bishop, who will tell you about a book that he has taken from the
libraries of the church which contains information of Demons.
However, no holy man can use the tools of evil. He has no relics in
the Cathedral which are known to defeat Demons, but he does tell you
of a scholar who lives in Rochster who has knowledge of matters such
as these. Before sending Sir Lancelot and Nineve to Rochester to
meet with the scholar, have Sir Lancelot request the book from
Dubric. Only Lancelot and Constantine have enough Nobility and
Faith to receive this book from Dubric. Have Sir Lancelot give the
book to Nineve and then send them both to Rochester.
</P>

<P>
Soon, you are going to notice the Icon of Sygebright moving across
the land. Use great care when you move each of your characters.
The Saxons are now moving freely across the land. Be sure that Sir
Lancelot and Nineve stay a good distance away from the Sygebright
armies. If they were to accidently come across the Saxon army, Sir
Lancelot and Nineve would be captured and killed. Now, to reduce
the difficulty of the impending battle soon to come against the
Saxons, send all of the unnecessary Knights at Camelot to
Stonehenge. Doing this with make the large scale battle much easier
to control. When you see that Sygebright is getting close to
Camelot, move Baudwin to Stonehenge. He has a very important task
ahead of him and you must make sure that no harm comes to him.
</P>

<P>
Once you have reached Rochester, stop and talk to the scholar who
will tell you that only a powerful magician can defeat a Demon.
Now, this information is not entirely true; it is also possible to
kill a Demon with holy water. Having a powerful magican around
helps greatly. In fact, you are going to need a powerful Magician
to even locate the place where the Demons reside. The scholar
speaks of the old Magican Merlin. Merlin has not been seen lately.
However, he has been known to spend much of his time in the area of
Cornwall. There is a man in Exeter that has knowledge of Merlin's
whereabouts. You will be going there soon enough, but first you
have a few items to collect again.
</P>

<P>
Send Sir Lancelot and Nineve to Cambridge to talk to the Friar
there. The Friar has possession of some Holy Water that he will not
part with easily. Have Nineve cast the Charm spell on him and
retrieve the holy water from him. Now, send Sir Lancelot and Nineve
to Chichester. Once in Chichester, have Sir Lancelot bribe the
Apothecary and get all of the items that she has. Have Sir Lancelot
give the Hellsbane and the Mandrake to Nineve and have Lancelot keep
the Healing Balm for himself. Now send Sir Lancelot to Dorchester,
in Dorchester you will meet with another Apothecary. You should
again have Sir Lancelot bribe the Apothecary and give all of the
items to Nineve. Continuing the quest for potions and items, send
Sir Lancelot along with Nineve to Bath. In Bath, you will meet with
a goodwife. This goodwife has a very important item that you will
need to free Merlin once we have found him. Bribe the goodwife and
give all of her items to Nineve.
</P>

<P>
Sometime during your quest for items, Sygebright should have reached
Camelot. With the number of troops you have in Camelot you should
be able to crush him quite easily. Once you have defeated him, you
should send the characters gathered from Stonehenge to Camelot, as
there will be a couple of magic users that will be needing the use
of the stones. Also, if Sygebright did get to Camelot by way of
Almsbury and you have moved Baudwin to Stonehenge, you should now
move Baudwin to Glastonbury where he can continue his following of
the book.
</P>

<P>
Now that you have gathered all of the necessary items, there are a
few noblemen that have been turned to stone in northeastern regions
of the Cambrian Mountains. Send Sir Lancelot to Llandbardan, which
is just to the north of Cardigan. Watch Sir Lancelot carefully as
he may get lost. It is a good policy to let him go there city by
city rather than by traveling the whole distance at once. In
Llandbardan, you will meet with King Gywnedd, who has been turned to
stone. Have Nineve cast the Disenchant spell on King Gywnedd and he
will pledge his fealty to the Round Table forces. Having done this
again, send Sir Lancelot north to White Tower to meet with King
Hyfaiid who is suffering from the same affliction as the others..
Have Nineve cast the Disenchent spell on the King and then he too
will give his fealty to the realm.
</P>

<P>
With that done, send Sir Lancelot and Nineve back to Stonehenge.
She is going have to recharge her magic powers after disenchanting
all of the nobility in the land. Once Sir Lancelot and Nineve
arrive, Select for Lancelot to go to the Church of Almesbury. If
the church has been destroyed by Sygebright, you can still send Sir
Lancelot to the church but you won't be able to view the location
until it is rebuilt. Nineve will automatically follow Sir Lancelot
to the church. You must intercept her and send her to Stonehenge
alone. With Nineve in Stonehenge, Magnify on the magical stones and
you will see her standing among the stones. Have Nineve cast the
Repletion spell which will not only display a nice graphic, but will
also replenish her magical powers. With this done, send her back to
Almesbury and join forces with Sir Lancelot.
</P>

<P>
You will now go questing for Merlin. Send Sir Lancelot and Nineve
to Exeter where there is a townman who has knowledge of Merlin.
This is a very greedy townsman. If Sir Lancelot doesn't have enough
gold left to persuade him to talk, have Nineve bribe him or cast the
charm spell on him to gain his knowledge. The townsman will
reluctantly tell you that Merlin has a cave just to the northwest of
Exeter. If you return to the Map Level, there should now be a small
icon on the coast which represents Merlin's cave. Send Sir Lancelot
to the cave. Along the way he will encounter a number of beasts,
created by the evil Morgan. Sir Lancelot should have no trouble
clearing the path to the cave. Once you are at Merlin's cave, go
inside where you will find Merlin locked solid in a chamber of ice.
A spell cast by Morgan has put him there. Nineve knows of a spell
that can release him. Have Nineve use the Fascinum Laxus. Once he
is thawed, he can be added to the Round Table's arsenal of forces.
</P>

<P>
Next, you will need to recharge Merlin's powers. Send Sir Lancelot,
along with his noble followers, to Stonehenge where you will prepare
the characters for an upcoming battle with the Demon. With all the
characters in Stonghenge, give each of the following items to
Merlin: all of the Belladonas, Heyle's Book, all of the Fyrd's
stones, all of the Fascinum Tereree's, the Elixer of Loftus, one
holy water, and the Livre D'Sangrail (Lancelots book found on his
quests for the Holy Grail). Now have Nineve give any Holy Water she
has in her possession to Sir Lancelot, who will be able to use it
more quickly against evil foes than Nineve would. Have Merlin Use
Heyle's book. If you look into Merlin's spell casting inventory,
you will find that he now has three new spells, two of which you
will need to use. The third is a dangerous spell that should never
be used throughout the entire game. Merlin now has all of the
spells and items that he will need to complete the game. Have him
cast the Point Of Evil spell, which will show you where the evil
powers in the forest are when you return to the Map Level. Now have
Nineve cast the Shield spell on Sir Lancelot as many times as she
can until she runs out of magical power doing so. Send Sir Lancelot
and Nineve to the church and have Merlin remain at Stonehenge and
cast the spell of Repletion. Now that Merlin has his full magic
powers restored, send him to the church and have Nineve return to
Stonehenge. After she has replenished her magical powers, send her
back to the church. Have Nineve stop and talk with Sir Lancelot,
but do not have her join Sir Lancelot at this time. Instead, have
her continue to cast the Shield spell on Sir Lancelot until she has
run out of the items needed to cast the spell. Again, send Nineve
back to Stonehenge to replenish her powers, and then send her to the
church to meet with Sir Lancelot and Merlin. Now have her cast the
Defend spell on Sir Lancelot until she has run out of the item
needed to cast the spell. You have now completed the character
preparation needed to defend almost any being. Both Merlin and Sir
Lancelot should have very high attack and defense abilities.
</P>

<P>
Next, return to the Map Level and send Sir Lancelot and Merlin to
the ruins in the Forest Savuage. While Sir Lancelot and Merlin are
travelling to the forest, check to see if Baudwin at Glastonbury has
a faith level of at least 19. If he does not have a faith level
this high, stop Sir Lancelot and Merlin from reaching the ruins
until Baudwin has a faith level of 19. He is going to need a faith
level this high to be able to complete the next episode, and you
will not have time to allow him to increase his faith in the next
episode. When Sir Lancelot and Merlin reach the ruins, Sir Lancelot
will be met by a very evil, blue-colored Fell Beast and a number of
powerful evil knights. Sir Lancelot should be able to defeat each
of his opponents without too much trouble; after all, he is now the
most powerful knight the Round Table has ever seen. After Sir
Lancelot has defeated all of the knights, he will need to track down
the Demon in the upper level of the ruined castle. When you meet
with the Demon, Sir Lancelot will automatically prepare for single
combat. When the battle begins, have Merlin cast the Nomed Nommus
spell on the Demon by selecting Merlin, selecting Magic, and then
selecting Nomed Nummus.
</P>

<P>
The Demon will be killed by the spell and you will have won the
episode. The Round Table forces will now control the majority of
the lands of Britain.
</P>

<H3>EPISODE FIVE</H3>

<P>
At the start of Episode Five, you are again informed of evil
occurences in the realm. Select Lancelot to lead a party, but do
not have any other knights of the Round Table follow him. In the
main hall, you will meet with Nineve. Have Nineve join with Sir
Lancelot and continue into the Holy Chapel within. In the Chapel,
you will meet with Baudwin. Select for Baudwin to Join with Sir
Lancelot and Nineve. Make sure that Baudwin has a faith level of at
least 19; if he does not, you must replay the previously save
Episode Four game and for his faith to rise to 19. Next, go
upstairs to the Enchanter's Lab where you will meet with Merlin.
Select for Merlin to join your party. Continue on by going to the
Treasury where you will select for Sir Lancelot to gather up all of
the gold that remains there. Next, go to the Map Level, where the
first order of business is to send Sir Bors from Glastonbury to
Turnance. When he arrives, he will find a key. Take this key and
send Sir Bors to Holyhead, which is straight north of Turnance. The
best route for Sir Bors to follow would be by water, as this route
is much faster than traveling through the rugged lands of
Estregales.
</P>

<P>
While Sir Bors is traveling, send Sir Lancelot and his party to
Almsbury to meet with the Friar there. Do not stop and talk to any
travelers on the way because they will only request that you aid
them in a quest, and you have more important tasks at hand. Also,
beware of a rouge masquerading as a Holy Man who is near Camelot.
When Sir Lancelot meets the Friar at Almsbury, select Nineve to
charm the Friar and request the Holy Water from him. Now, command
Nineve to give the Holy Water to Sir Lancelot.
</P>

<P>
After he has received the Holy Water, send Sir Lancelot and his
party to the second hut just to the northwest of Almsbury. When the
party arrives, have Sir Lancelot bribe the old woman and request the
Belladonna from her. When Sir Lancelot has the Belladonna, have Sir
Lancelot give the Belladonna to Merlin. You are now ready to go and
do battle with the first set of Demons. Send Sir Lancelot to the
ruins you were just at in the end of Episode Four.
</P>

<P>
When Sir Lancelot reaches the ruins he will be met by a very
powerful Grey Fell Beast. However, Sir Lancelot should be able to
defeat the beast without the use of a Dragon's Bane. If Sir
Lancelot is wounded in combat during this episode, have him use a
Healing Balm to regenerate his health. Next, continue through the
gate. Sir Lancelot will now be challenged by a number of Fey
Knight. Again, Sir Lancelot should have no troubles defeating the
evil foes. Next, go into the castle where Sir Lancelot will meet
with a Demon. Again, have Merlin cast the Nomed Nommus spell to
defeat the Demon. Go upstairs where you will meet with a large
group of ladies that were captured by the Demon and his vermin
followers. One of the ladies will ask for Sir Lancelot's assistance
in escorting her to her husband's castle in Wroxeter. Have Sir
Lancelot assist the lady.
</P>

<P>
When the lady reaches Wroxeter, have Sir Lancelot talk to Sir
Peredur a number of times. Sir Peredur will not only pledge his
kingdom to the Round Table, he will also give Sir Lancelot some
important information regarding the evil Morgan. When you return to
the Map Level, you will see another castle in the northern region of
Estregales. This is Morgan's castle. Do not go there yet! You are
not yet ready to do battle with such a powerful foe.
</P>

<P>
Send Sir Lancelot and party to Tsuroc. Sir Owain is in Tsuroc and
he has lost his son to an evil Demon. Once Sir Lancelot reaches
Tsuroc, Sir Owain will tell you of the disappearance of his son.
When you return to the Map Level, you will see that another new set
of ruins has appeared on the map in the mountains to the west of the
first set of ruins. Send Sir Lancelot and his party to the new set
of ruins.
</P>

<P>
Sometime during Sir Lancelot's travels, Sir Bors will reach
Holyhead. Send Sir Bors inside of Holyhead where you will find a
locked door. Open the door with the key that Sir Bors collected in
Turnance. In the room, you will find a ring. Command Sir Bors to
take the ring and send him to Castle Anguish. In Castle Anguish,
Sir Bors will find the Holy Grail. With the Holy Grail in Sir Bors'
possession, send him to back to Holyhead and from there on to
Tsuroc. In Tsuroc, have Sir Bors go in the castle and talk to Sir
Owain. This will secure Sir Owain's loyalty to the Round Table.
</P>

<P>
Sir Lancelot will meet with a Demon just outside of the ruins. Have
Merlin again use the spell and kill the Demon, which will free Sir
Owain's son. Now, continue inside of the ruins where a woman's
scream has been heard. You will again meet with another Demon
inside the ruins. Once again, have Merlin use the Nomed Nommus
spell on the Demon. The Maiden who was to be sacrificed by the
Demon, will now automatically lead Sir Lancelot and the party though
numerous towns and then finally to Cardigan. When she has reached
Cardigan, Magnify on the city and go into the castle there. Inside
the castle, Sir Lancelot will meet and speak with Sir Selises who
will proclaim that he is pledging his fealty to the realm. With
this action perfomed, you have now secured all of the lands of
Britain. All that is left to do is defeat Morgan herself.
</P>

<P>
Send the party to Stonehenge and let Merlin recharge his powers.
Merlin will need all the help he can get, so send Sir Lancelot and
his party back north to Tsuroc where Sir Bors is. There are going
to be some Demons traveling the lands now. However, as long as none
of the Demons reach Camelot, you will not lose the game.
Unfortunately, you will lose some of your lesser characters, but you
can still complete the game without them. When Sir Lancelot meets
with Sir Bors, have Sir Lancelot stop and talk to Sir Bors. At the
Scene Level, have Sir Bors give the Holy Grail to Baudwin.
</P>

<P>
Now, you are prepared for the final battle. Send Sir Lancelot to
Morgan's Castle. Be absolutely sure to save your game. Before you
reach the castle, you are going to meet with a number of challenges
(six to be exact). The first three will be Fell Beasts. You can
have Sir Lancelot use three Dragon's Banes to defeat these foes
quickly. If you do not have three Dragon's Banes to use against the
Fell Beasts, Lancelot should be able to defeat them without the
exotic item. Sir Lancelot is now powerful enough to defeat even the
most powerful black Fell Beast. The next three Demons that Sir
Lancelot will encounter are a bit more powerful.
</P>

<P>
Merlin should only have two Belladonnas, which is going to make
killing the third beast a bit more difficult. Have Merlin quickly
dispose of the first two Demons with the Nomed Nommus spell. When
you reach the third Demon have Sir Lancelot use Holy Water on it
five times. This should kill the Demon. You will need two separate
flasks of Holy Water to kill this one Demon. Lancelot should have
at least two of these flasks; if not, Merlin has one. Be sure not
to use Merlin's flask of Holy Water more than three times. He is
going to need one portion to help defeat Morgan in the very near
future. If you do not have enough Holy Water to defeat this last
Demon, you must restore a previously saved game and collect one or
two extra Holy Waters that you neglected to gather previously.
</P>

<P>
With the third Demon defeated, you are now going to meet with Morgan
herself. During your first contact with her, she will tell you that
you have come to meet your deaths. Sir Lancelot will quickly jump
into battle with her. Before Sir Lancelot becomes gravely wounded,
have Merlin cast the spell Negra Potis. This will defeat all the
magic in the room. This spell only lasts for 10 seconds in real
time, so you must act fast now. Have Baudwin use the Holy Grail on
Morgan. With the power of God, you will have defeated the evil,
beautiful Morgan Le Fey.
</P>

<P>
Contratulations, you have completed the entire game! If you have
followed the directions carefully, you should now have all of the
lands of Britian under your control.
</P>

<P>
You have proven yourself worthy to be a ruler of the realm and all
of the Knights of the Round Table have pledged their allegiance to
you. Long live the Noble King.
</P>
