<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Do battle in the back alleys of the Big Apple. In the shadow of
ancient Chinese temples. In not-so-jolly old England. And win the
grudging respect of eight of the toughest, meanest street fighters
on the planet. Forget all the rules. This is strictly survival of
the fittest. You'll need power, speed, and plenty of street smarts.
Watch out for Geki and his Ninja weapons, Birdie's lethal head butt,
and the flying scissors kick of Gen. You've got a few tricks up your
karate sleeve; a martial arts arsenal that includes hurricane kicks
and dragon punches. Don't hold back for even an instant. No hold
barred, best two out of three competition. Fight in England, China,
Japan or the U.S.
</P>

<H2>CHEATS</H2>

<P>
On the title screen, type "STREETCHEAT" or "STREET CHEAT". During
play use the 'HELP' key to skip levels. Press 'DEL' to make your
opponent win.

<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
The technique for getting past Sagat of Thailand is to watch for his
fireballs and long reach. Jump high, kick and retreat. Repeat this
until he carks it.
