<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Stryx has been designed to have the smallest animated characters
without losing detailed definition, so creating the maximum
playfield on screen at once. With members of the cast around
two-thirds of the size of those found in Barbarian, Stryx is able to
feature a substantial number on screen at any one time. Involving
three distinct graphical levels and eight way scrolling, the
action-packed strategy game sees the warrior hero Stryx in a fight
to the death against Cyborg robots hell bent on destroying their
human masters. Half-man, half-robot himself, Stryx faces the
ultimate challenge of recapturing from the Cyborgs the keys to the
lifeforce, the fail-safe extermination system developed to prevent
such a machine uprising. Only by solving the graphical puzzle can he
deactivate the robotic assassins who are wandering the Dome Cities
seeking out human life ruthlessly destroying it.
