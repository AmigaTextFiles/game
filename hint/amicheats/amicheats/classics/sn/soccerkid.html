<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
Unfortunately there is no cheat mode for this game. There is
however some very handy special icons to be found in the trees
during play.
</P>

<P>
On various levels in the game (not too sure which) stand directly
under the trees and kick the ball straight up the tree trunk. If
there is a special icon to be found in that tree you will notice it
flash slightly. You must kick the ball up the tree and hit the
hidden icon four times and you will then receive an extra 4000
points. If you now repeat this process again and hit the icon
another four times you will uncover what special icon was in that
tree. These icons vary from invincibility to speed boots, just
collect them and away you go.
