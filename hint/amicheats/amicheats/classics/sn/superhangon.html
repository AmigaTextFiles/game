<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Nobody can resist the pure temptation to go just a little faster or
push a little harder. In this outstanding arcade translation we do
just that, we put the gamer on the edge and challenge them to live
there. Enjoy fast paced motorcycle racing action, where riders race
on four different continents, each representing different levels of
skill and difficulty. True-to-life animations of bike and rider.
Full screen track representation. Turbo mode gives the true feeling
of speed, and responsive acceleration to enhance playability and
excitement. Nothing can compare to the feeling of anticipation and
power as man and machine perform.
</P>

<H2>CHEATS</H2>

<P>
To activate the cheat mode you must beat the highest score on the
current continent highscore table (Africa is the easiest). Enter
'750J' into the highscore table and press the fire button, it will
now change to '....'. The cheat mode is now enabled. Now to summon
the cheat alteration menu hold down 'Ctrl', 'left Alt', 'Z' and 'T'
while the credits screen changes to the options screen.
</P>

<P>
After a short while the screen will turn black and it is at this
point when you should release all of the keys. If you have done
this correctly you will now be asked to enter new values for the
outer and inner road turn effect coefficients. You can do this
using the numeric keypad. These parameters simply determine how
well you handle the race corners. If you enter a high number you
will be more prone to skidding off on the corners. If you enter a
low number, say 20 and 10 respectively, when you come to a corner at
about 300 mph, you can corner with no problem at all, making it far
easier to complete a course.
</P>

<P>
Once you have activated the cheat mode you'll also receive a machine
gun! To make use of the weapon just hold the 'left Amiga' key
during play. It can distroy all other bikes and road side
obstacles.
