<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
A weapon dropped by other syndicate agents will contain very little
ammo but one dropped by the police or a guard will be fully loaded.
</P>

<P>
Persuade as many enemy agents as possible to get loads of cash, and
then equip your team with version 3 modifications.
</P>

<P>
In the very tough missions persuade some innocent people because
they can act as a shield and they also pick up any weapons they find
and fire them at whatever you fire at.
</P>

<P>
If you don't want to lose any members of your team and you think you
are going to die, then press the 'Esc' key and start the mission
again.
</P>

<P>
It is wise to save the game after each successfully completed
mission, this may be time consuming but it saves you having to back
track if you fail.
</P>
