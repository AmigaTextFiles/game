<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Things didn't go right anymore for our favourite hero: the ghost
BUBBLE. He thought he had found peace in the forgotten ruins of the
castle of Von Blubba. It seems now that he went wrong. The
atmosphere of the dark dungeons has changed since the arrival of the
new owner. In fact this guy didn't only decide to build an hotel on
the foundations of the old castle and in that goal has appealed a
specialized firm, but also all the infernal vibrations due to this
new activity triggered a lot of forgotten mecanisms designed to put
the most unremetting treasure hunters off. And we could also speak
about the surprising going past of extraterrestrials who took
advantage from their stay to install diabolical engines which the
radioactive emanations have transformed the local fauna into strange
and hostile creatures.
</P>

<P>
It's decided, BUBBLE packs another time to find a more peaceful
residence. But, contrary to usual beliefs, ghosts aren't completly
immaterial: they still have a soul, materialised under the shape of
a bubble and which follows them everywhere. As a consequence, to
escape from his castle, bubble will have to guide his soul by
breathing into the trapped maze which stand for the underground.
