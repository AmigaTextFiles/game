<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
This time Roger Wilco journeys from the 16-color past of Space Quest
I to the frightening future of  Space Quest XII, one step ahead of
the Sequel Police, a group of nasty assassins. Sludge Vohaul has
been reincarnated in a ghastly new form, and only Roger can stop his
nefarious plans. Roger emerges as a more complex character than in
the early games, and even gets to meet his yet-to-be-born son in a
future scenario!
</P>

<H2>SOLVE</H2>

<P>
For the first section of the game, look in pages 8 and 9 of your
Space Piston book and follow the walk-through provided. When you
have followed the walk-through successfully you will find yourself
in the sewers. From here:
</P>

<H3>SEWER ROOM</H3>

<P>
Go to the table and get the jar. Look under the pad on the table
and press the button that is there. When the picture show has
finished, go to the large contraption to the left of you and turn
the handle. The door will open, enabling you to go inside. Do so
now. You are now in the sewers underneath Xenon. Move to the left
hand side of the sewers and move down. A little thingie will start
to follow you. Let it follow you until the bottom screen, wait
until it gets near you and use the jar to scoop it up. Now quickly
get out of the way and wait until the slime has gone. Go from here
to the ladder and climb up. Go to the screen to the left and here
you will find a spaceship. Climb into the landing gear.
</P>

<H3>MAIN COMPUTER</H3>

<P>
Save the game now, in case you muck the next couple of commands up.
Go to the right hand screen and a time pod should appear. Quickly
get into it. When you are inside, enter any combination you like,
but note down what you entered. You might like to try different
combinations.
</P>

<H3>SPACE QUEST 10</H3>

<P>
When you land, get out of the pod and walk around a bit. Go left -
you will see something down the path, so go back to the time pod and
take the path near it. A large bird comes along and picks you up.
Oh dear! When your in its nest, wait until one of the evil guards
drops in, then search him and you'll find a piece of paper. Go to
the hole in the nest and click on it with the Hand icon to go
through it. In the next screen you will meet some nice young
ladies. Get into the sub. When you get to the hideout, wait until
a slug turns up. When the slug tries to eat you, press the button
that activates the lasers on either side of the chair. Now get one
of the oxygen tanks and shove it into the slugs mouth.
</P>

<H3>SHOPPING CENTRE</H3>

<P>
Pick up the card that the girl has dropped, then get on the walkway.
Go to the Men's clothing shop and talk to the droid there. When you
have your new clothes, pay the man. Next, go to the Mamolith
burgers and ask the Pig there for a job. You can do the arcade bit
if you want to, but it isn't compulsory.
</P>

<P>
From here, go back to the place where you came into the shopping
centre and get the cigar. Now go to the cash machine, which stands
next to the software shop. Use the card you picked up in the
machine. It won't work. Now go to the ladies clothes shop and talk
to the droid at the desk - she should give you some clothes. Pay
for the clothes and go back to the cash machine. Now you can use
the card and get some money out. Go into the software shop and look
in the bargain bin to get the Space Quest hint book, which should be
underneath the other software. Pay for the book and then look at
it. Use the stick icon to reveal the answers.
</P>

<P>
Go from here to Radio Shock and look at the catalogue. Look at the
electrical gadgets and go through them until you come to the adaptor
for the Pocket pal. Get the adaptor which is at the bottom right of
the screen. Now go back to the ladie's clothes store and into the
changing rooms. Get dressed. When you have finished, go to the
arcade. Go over to the Ms Astro Chicken and insert a buckazoid.
Play the game as many times as you want. After a while the game
will blow up. A time pod should appear. When a soldier comes after
you, just leave the screen and go to the zero gravity skate place.
Go to the top of this and wait for the guard to come after you.
From here, dodge the guard and go back to the arcade. Get into the
time pod.
</P>

<P>
To work out where to go, take the codes that are in the hint book
and type them out. Then type in the code that is written on the
piece of paper you found.
</P>

<H3>SPACE QUEST ONE</H3>

<P>
Go to the bar, where you'll find some nice people. When you've been
thrown out, kick over the bikes. Now go back to the bar, but on the
way there, jump out of the way of the biker. In the bar, get the
matches from the bar table. Now go back to the Time Pod - but
you'll have to jump out of the way of the bikers again. When you're
in the time pod, go back to the start of the game.
</P>

<H3>START OF THE GAME</H3>

<P>
Go to the far right-hand side screen. Use the acid on the door
lock. When you're in the tunnel, use the matches on the cigar.
This should show you where the lasers are. Now go to the Bunny,
look at it and take the battery out of it. Put the battery in the
computer. Look at the panel on the wall and type in any number you
like. The best way to get the lasers in line is to experiment. I
found that using 100 each time sometimes works.
</P>

<P>
When you've managed this, go to the room to the north. You'll now
be in the main computer. Wait till the droid appears from the left,
then go back to the previous screen. Go back to the main computer.
By now, you should have given the droid the slip. Go from here down
the left-hand path until you come to another room with a control
panel. Now use the numbers given in the hint book to open the door.
</P>

<P>
Go into the next room. You should now be given a screen with lots
of objects on it. Move all the objects onto the toilet, but not the
SQ4 one. Now leave here and goto the main computer. If you can't
find your way back, use your computer with the sockets that are
around the place.
</P>

<P>
When you get to the main computer to fight with Vohal, Move your man
with the cursor keys or joystick. Move to the middle of the
platform to fight, and after a while, you should be able to get him
into the middle of the screen. When you've done this, go down the
ladder. When you come back up, a disc will be in your inventory.
Click the disc icon on the disc drive. When the picture of the
screen appears, click on Upload beam, then Upload disc, then use the
arrows to change the arrow to Roger Jnr and click on Download beam.
</P>

<P>
You have now downloaded Vohaul and finished Space Quest IV!
