<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Featuring full-screen animation and digitized sound, Borf's Revenge
begins where Space Ace I left off - in the space ship of the evil
Commander Borf with Borf having just been turned into a baby by our
hero Ace. But just when you thought Earth was safe from the evil
commander, his little henchmen, The Goons, have blasted Borf a second
time with the Infanto Ray, bringing him back to his full age... and
evil. Lead Ace through battles with the goons and other of Borf's
allies until you must ultimately do battle with the evil commander
himself.
