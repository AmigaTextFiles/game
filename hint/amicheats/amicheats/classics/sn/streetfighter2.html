<P>
In two player mode, pause the game and type "7KIDS". The border
should flash. Quit the current game and restart a two player game.
You both can have the same fighter. For inviciblity, start a one
player game and place the cursor over blanka but don't hit fire.
Type "PATIENCE" in slowly and the border will flash yellow. Now
select your fighter as normal and press 'F10' at any time to top off
your energy.
