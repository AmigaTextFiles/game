<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
That snotty evil witch Margaret has been up to her tricks again.
She's turned the prince to be into a garden frog and imprisoned his
intended one in a horrible old tower. With the help of vitamins and
a bottle of Newcastle Brown Ale, our froggy hero becomes Superfrog!
Help our hero through six fantastic lands in order to get back his
girl and vanquish the evil old crone and her curse. Meet Spud and
Dudley; experience platform action full of fun, cartoon animation,
and daft sound and speech effects.
</P>

<H2>CHEATS</H2>

<P>
Hold down the right mouse button and the old frog face will flash
indicating that the cheat is active. You are now invincible.

<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
HIDDEN ROOMS: These can be found behind false walls, which are
moved by running into them. Often they are located above ground,
and will only disappear if Superfrog is going upwards. Wings make
the location of these walls easier.
</P>

<P>
EXTRA COINS: Lots of hidden gold coins can be located by jumping
into certain objects such as pictures, rings, lamps and shields.
</P>

<P>
LUCOZADE: Always drink this even if your energy level is full,
because it will give you extra time.
</P>

<P>
FALSE FLOORS: These are strategically positioned so that Superfrog
will fall back to near the beginning of the current level. They are
usually located below lonely bonus items (not fruit), so avoid
temptation!
</P>

<P>
FRUIT MACHINE: The HI/LO feature tends to be rather random. If you
have a high score go for the 2x score feature because an extra life
is awarded for every 200,000 points scored. Avoid gambling - you
hardly ever win.
</P>

<P>
SLIPPERY SECTIONS: Icy parts will often lead to dangerous areas
such as spikes, so it's not a good idea to go along them at high
speed. Jumping will slow you down considerably.
</P>

<P>
SPIKES/BLOCKS: Moving spikes and blocks causes the loss of an
energy bar. Stationary spikes result in the loss of an entire life,
so be careful.
</P>

<P>
DEFEATING THE WITCH: Stand on the middle platform and hit the witch
with Spud half-a-dozon times. Move to the left of the screen, then
to the middle after she has swooped down, and repeat the process.
