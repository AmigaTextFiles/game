<H2>CHEATS</H2>

<P>
Name your company one of the following:
</P>

<P>
"DO IT AGAIN" --------------- repeat a failed mission<BR>
"ROB A BANK" ----------- start with 1,000,000 credits<BR>
"WATCH THE CLOCK" ------------ time goes really quick<BR>
"NUK THEM" --------------- select any country/mission<BR>
"TO THE TOP" - all weapons, equipment, mods available<BR>
"COOPER TEAM" - start with all cash, weapons, mods, missions,
equipment
</P>

<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
A weapon dropped by other syndicate agents will contain very little
ammo but one dropped by the police or a guard will be fully loaded.
</P>

<P>
Persuade as many enemy agents as possible to get loads of cash, and
then equip your team with version 3 modifications.
</P>

<P>
In the very tough missions persuade some innocent people because
they can act as a shield and they also pick up any weapons they find
and fire them at whatever you fire at.
</P>

<P>
It is wise to save the game after each successfully completed
mission, this may be time consuming but it saves you having to back
track if you fail.
</P>
