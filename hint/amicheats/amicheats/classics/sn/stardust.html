<P>
When in space combat, fire your phasers and torpeoes at the enemy
vessel. Then press 'D' to get Scotty on the damage control. All
the action stops, but your phasers and torpedoes will still
recharge. When the action begins again you will be able to fire at
the target straight away. Repeat this process a few times and your
enemy will not last long.
</P>

<P>
Enter "INTRODUCTION" for the password, and stage one will be
completed, and you'll have 14 lives and are powered with the three
way shot, bouncer and buster. To skip a stage, quit the game while
on the stage you want to skip, and start the game again. You will
now find that the stage has been completed for you.
</P>

<P>
Enter "BNTRODUCTINM" for the password, and level one will be
completed and you will move on to the 3d section.

<H2>TIPS</H2>

<H3>WORLD 1</H3>

<P>
If you follow these steps carefully then clearing the first world
shouldn't be too much of a problem. Begin at level one, in the
left-hand corner of the war plan.
</P>

<P>
Tackle one meteor at a time and don't shoot at all the big boulders
at once as the screen will become filled with hundreds of smaller
ones, which are a lot harder to shoot or avoid.
</P>

<P>
In level one, try to pick up a gun power-up - represented by a (G),
then go to the bottom centre level and collect another. Your
three-way shooter will now be at full power. Destroy the small ship
that enters from the left and get the bouncer. Clear the other
levels, finishing with the level in the bottom-left of the plan,
with the bouncer powered up.
</P>

<P>
The first end-of-level guardian is best tackled by flying your ship
from left to right, so you can shoot the boss as well as the shots
that fly towards you. Try to stay at the same vertical position as
the guardian. As it closes its doors, rotate 90 degrees and fly
away, so that you enter on the other side of the screen. Repeat the
same manoeuvre until you have defeated the guardian. If something
goes wrong, hide behind the open doors of the ship because the shots
can't penetrate them.
</P>

<P>
If you get killed while trying to kill the end-of-level guardians,
when you reappear you will have full shields so you can fly straight
into the guardian with your shield up. This should kill the
guardian very quickly and easily.
</P>

<P>
You'll now enter the first warp tunnel. The mines are
indestructible and a lot smaller than the rocks. Because of this,
the rocks will sometimes block your vision. It's best to move
around instead of staying in one place. Focus your eyes on the
centre of the tunnel and this will give you more time to react.
</P>

<H3>WORLD 2</H3>

<P>
You'll encounter a wave of Stellar Blades. When they appear, they
will home in on you and attack. Your best defence here is to keep
moving around, so they don't get a chance to locate you.
</P>

<P>
In the top-centre level, a couple of bombers await you. Beware of
the exploding mines they leave behind, they can be destroyed with a
couple of well placed shots. In the bottom right level you must
tackle four huge Space Balls. Destroy one to break their formation
and this will make it easier to take out the rest.
</P>

<P>
In the bottom-left level you will find a squadron of Trilons.
You'll need shields to deal with these. Put your shields up and fly
straight towards them as soon as they appear.
</P>

<P>
When you face the end-of-level guardian, shoot its appendages while
evading the tailed eye. When all the appendages are destroyed your
shots can penetrate the main body. To defeat the eye, fly backwards
and forwards at the edge of the screen and this way it won't be able
to home in on you.
</P>

<P>
The special mission, should you accept it, is a tough one. Firstly,
your ship is constantly being pulled to the ground. Secondly you
must keep an eye on your fuel gauge. Remember, when you fly through
tight spots use your brake by pressing fire. For the warp tunnel,
use the same tactics as you did in the first.
</P>

<H3>WORLD 3</H3>

<P>
The bombers you face in the top-centre levels leave spinning morph
heads behind instead of mines. The heads rotate and breathe fire.
When they start to morph from the ball shape, do a runner or you'll
wind up dead.
</P>

<P>
In the bottom-right level you'll have to deal with the Thorn Balls.
They spin around, bouncing from the edges of the screen. Stay in
the centre of the screen and fire where you want by rotating your
ship.
</P>

<P>
In the bottom-left level an Orbit Plate awaits you and you'll
definately need you shields to face it. The Space Worm is best
taken out with missiles. Fly your ship around it and try to hit its
body parts. If all else fails, put your shields up and make a
kamikaze attack.
</P>

<P>
The guardian is quite easy to defeat. Fly behind it (not too close)
and shoot. When it stops, keep your distance and hit it with
everything you've got.
</P>

<P>
The third tunnel sequence features a lot of Thorn Balls on a
collision course with your ship. They bounce off the tunnel walls,
are much bigger than the mines and are indestructible, so avoid them
like the plague.
</P>

<H3>WORLD 4</H3>

<P>
This level introduces two new threats: the Speeders and the
Beetles.
</P>

<P>
The Speeders try to home in on you just like the Stellar Blades, but
they take more hits to destroy and are affected by inertia. Make
sure you keep moving around the screen while you shoot them. The
Beetles attack in groups and the best time to shoot at them is when
they begin to rotate.
</P>

<P>
The end-of-level guardian has three phases. To deal with it, you
must wait until it spins around, then you must accelerate, fly away
and turn around to shoot at it. When it stops it either morphs into
a plate or a ball. If it takes the form of a plate you can expect a
burst of shots. If it turns itself into a ball, look out for the
homing missiles. The best weapon you can use against this guardian
is the flamer. Enter the fourth tunnel and make sure you get every
energy power-up that you can see because you're goind to need your
strength for the final world.
</P>

<H3>WORLD 5</H3>

<P>
This world is what your shoot-em-up nightmares are made of. This is
where you will face everything the professor throws at you, before
he finallyhas a go.
</P>

<P>
In the top-center level you will encounter waves of Orbit Plates
flying from the bottom of the screen to the top. Shooting them
won't help, so concentrate on avoiding them and use your shields
when you get yourself into a tight spot.
</P>

<P>
The guardian of this level is the professor himself. He will attack
you with and egg-shaped machine which is armed to the teeth. The
egg will try to crush you, so keep moving and shooting.
</P>

<P>
When the egg stop, a hatch will open revealing a flame-thrower or,
maybe, a cannon. The flame-thrower has a limited range and it only
comes out of the top of the egg.
</P>

<P>
The other weapons include a missile launcher and a rapid fire plasma
rifle. When the egg is destroyed, Professor Schaumund himself will
appear, shooting at the sides of the screen at an incredible rate.
He is immune to your weapons so concentrate on avoiding his shots
and attacks by moving up and down in the top and bottom edges of the
screen. Defeat him and the 'I'm really quite good at the really
rather hard shoot-em-up Stardust' award will be yours.
