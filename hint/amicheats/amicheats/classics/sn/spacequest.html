<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Space-fantasy spoof featuring Roger Wilco, sanitation engineer
turned interstellar swashbuckler who must save his planet against
ship-napping Sariens. 3-D animated graphics, new windowing system.
</P>

<P>
NOTE: Several years after the first release of this game there was
an updated version made. The story line was the same, so the solve
below should also work with it. This updated version used the
following description:
</P>

<P>
Help Roger Wilco, sanitation engineer turned interstellar
swashbuckler, recover stolen Star Generator from villainous Sariens.
But if you think you know this game - Beware! Those Two Guys from
Andromeda whipped up some new space magic and modernized this
version with Amiga graphics, full-stereo soundtrack, celestial sound
effects, and enough new puzzles to explode a meteor. Now emulates
1950's sci-fi movie but with 90's style state-of-the-art animation
and point-and-click interface. Six low density disks, hard disk
installable. Supports Amiga 4-voice sound.

Go to the Left (twice). You'll soon lose your helmet, but you
cannot avoid it. Enter the lift, and once at the bottom, go to the
right.
</P>

<P>
The Sariens are able to recognise you so you'll have to kill them
before they do. When you leave a room, quickly hit 'F6' during the
loading of the next screen. If a Sarien is in that room it won't be
able to shoot you! If a Droid is in the room you can avoid it or
leave the room, then come back again hoping it has changed into a
Sarien!

killed with the grenade. SEARCH MAN - PUSH BUTTON. Go near the
Star Generator. LOOK SCREEN. With the arrow, dial code 6858, then

Enter the far right lift. Go to the shuttle. ENTER SHUTTLE - PRESS
LAUNCH. Time is running out fast after you started the self
destruct process, so don't hang around!!
