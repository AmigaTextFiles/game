<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
The arcade smash of the 1970's is back with a vengeance. Combines a
host of features from the arcade classic like Phoenix, Gorf, and
Galaxians. Optimized graphics and sound as well as loads of new and
exciting waves. Aliens swoop at you from all angles and in dozens of
different attack formations. Advanced players can find secret hidden
levels, and there are wacky bovine bonus levels. Instantly playable
and totally addictive.

<H2>CHEATS</H2>

<P>
Type in "KRIS" on the option screen and you will then be able to
skip through the levels with the 'F1' key.
</P>

<P>
When you collect the pod that produces four bases, placed at equal
intervals along the bottom of the screen, don't just leave them
there. If the invaders are quite low, shoot the bases up the screen
and into the alien swarms. This way you are guaranteed of killing
aliens as they die upon contact with bases, rather than allowing the
space fiends to destroy them before they come down.
