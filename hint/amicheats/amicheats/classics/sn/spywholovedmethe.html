<P>
Start the game and stop the car. Now type "MISS MONEYPENNY" for
infinite money and lives. Press 'F10' to skip levels.

<P>
If you don't want to use the cheat then on level 2, try to buy the
most expensive items in Q's armoured truck and make a note of the
map on the left-hand side of the screen.
