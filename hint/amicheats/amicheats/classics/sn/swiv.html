<H2>CHEATS</H2>

<P>
Pause the action and type "NCC-1701" then press the 'Return' key.
The screen should flash blue indicating the cheat mode is active.
This gives you infinite lives and you can select the various weapons
by pressing 'F1' to 'F6'.

<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
The Goose helicopter from Silkworm is in S.W.I.V. as well, and just
like before it is your only supply of weapons. All you have to do is
to simply destroy it to get them - not as easy as it sounds. It's
not too hard to see off, although you should be careful because it
swoops down to the bottom of the screen every now and then and if
you're in the way you'll be dead meat. However, by far the best way
to destroy it is to collect a shield (if there's one handy) and just
dive into the centre of it with all guns firing. The Goose will
succumb very quickly this way and you don't take any risks.
</P>

<P>
Now, what are the best weapons to have? Well, don't bother with the
compact bullets as they're not nearly as good as the spread fire.
The best thing to do is to pick up a couple of spread fire and then
grab hold of speed fire as well. The most you can get is five spread
fire, so once you've got them concentrate on the speed fire.
</P>

<P>
The big Guardian you come across takes quite a bit to destroy. But
with the right tactics you should be alright. When you approach the
monster get on the left hand side and fire like mad. This should
take out the small vehicle that comes out of the door on the left
and also inflict a bit of damage on the Guardian (provided you took
the advice on the weapon choice). Once the laser has stopped firing
(it shoots three times before stopping) move over to the right and
take out the small tank that came out of the other door. After the
laser has fired again go back to the left and continue the process
until the Guardian is destroyed. Remember, if you die you will be
invulnerable for a few seconds so go on top of the Guardian and
shoot like mad to inflict loads of damage. Just make sure you're not
still there when you become vulnerable again.
</P>

<P>
The next Guardian you come across is quite a way into the game, but
it makes up for the lack of them over the last loads of screens.
Here you will be confronted by three huge lasers and two smaller gun
turrets that will bombard you with a load of bullets every now and
then. The first thing you should concentrate your fire on are the
small gun turrets as they can locate where you are and make life
very hard. Once they've been disposed of you can take your time over
the lasers as they don't cause much of a problem.
</P>

<P>
Shields are very important in the game and should not be wasted. On
no account use them as a smart bomb because this is a waste. The
smart bomb will only kill the enemies on the screen and then you'll
be under attack again. Using it as a shield will give you protection
for quite a while, and is especially useful for tackling the Goose
ship as mentioned before.
