<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
The year is 4619. The mission: find colonizable worlds, gather
minerals and ancient artifacts, and learn the secrets of alien
races. As commander of an interstellar spaceship, players train a
crew of up to six members from five alien species: human, androids,
insect-like Velox, reptilian Thrynn, and Elowan, a race of
intelligent plants. A built-in fractal generator treats players to
beautiful color animation that brings unprecedented realism to
rotating planets and landing sequences. It includes 270 star systems
and 800 planets.
</P>

<H2>CHEATS</H2>

<P>
In the trade depot at the space station, buy 1000 units of endurium.

sell back 990 the you will get 2,714,000 MU'S.
</P>

<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
You must use a black egg to destroy the Uhlek Brain World. If you
do not, the Uhlek will not let you collect the Crystal Cone. They
will slaughter you and your crew with plasma bolts. Do not feel
guilty about destroying this planet. The Uhlek are bloodthirsty
killers.
</P>

<P>
You must collect the Crystal Orb to nullify the defenses of the
Crystal Planet so you can land on it. The Crystal Orb is found at
(132, 165).
</P>

<P>
You must collect the Crystal Cone to identify the control nexus of
the planet. The Crystal Cone is found in the system at (20, 198) on
the first planet.
</P>

<P>
You must collect a second black egg to use to blow up the Crystal
Planet (192, 152). Black eggs can be found: on the third planet at
(238, 189), on the first planet at (143, 115), and on the second
planet at (234, 20).
</P>

<P>
Using the Red cylinder (found on the third planet of the system at
(112, 200) at coordinates 59n, 64w) can help you find the artifacts
on the planets.
