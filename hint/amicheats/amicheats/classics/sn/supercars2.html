<P>
Enter player one's name as "Wonderland" and player two's name as
"The Seer" (only capitalize the first letter of each word). You
will now qualify regardless of your position and you'll have all
the extras too.
</P>

<P>
Also try player ones name as "I WALK THE HILL" & player two's as
"INWARDS". You will now have 99% of all weapons and will qualify
regardless of you finishing position.
</P>

<P>
Before you start playing the game type "HARD DRIVING" for infinite
money. Maybe that only the first Letter of each word is uppercase.
