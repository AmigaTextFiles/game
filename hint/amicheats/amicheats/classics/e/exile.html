<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
Unlock the doors of your spacecraft with the red buttons and leave
it.
</P>

<P>
Play around with objects (try getting the gun and the grenades).
</P>

<P>
Try killing the nerving birds (you will need the experience).
</P>

<P>
Bomb away barriers (perhaps doors) with grenades.
</P>

<P>
Remember:  Everything that happens to you will happen to every
object in the game.  Btw.  Everything will be teleported by the
Transporter (even the explosions)
</P>

<P>
Estinguish Fire with Water (I will not tell more)
</P>

<P>
Try dropping down grenades in chasms if there are many missile bases
down there.
</P>

<P>
Play with the keyboard.  Joystick control is very fuzzy.  You won't
get the feeling if you play with joystick.
</P>

<H3>KEYBOARD CONTROLS</H3>

<P>
Control of the hero:
</P>

<P>
"Q" ---- Fly left<BR>
"W" ---- Fly right<BR>
"P" ---- Ascend<BR>
"L" ---- Descend<BR>
'Tab' -- Change direction (very useful in critical situations)<BR>
'Ctrl' - Turn horizontal (I don't know what this is for)
</P>

<P>
Object control:
</P>

<P>
"," - Take object (arm gun, carry grenades or flasks...)<BR>
"M" - Drop object<BR>

</P>

<P>
If you drop or throw a grenade, it will get live and explodes
within a few seconds.
</P>

<P>

</P>

<P>
"O" - Aim at destination<BR>
"K" - Aim at destination<BR>
"I" - Center destination<BR>

</P>

<P>
Others:
</P>

<P>

"T" - Teleport home<BR>

</P>

<P>
These are certainly not all keys, but I didn't find out more.
