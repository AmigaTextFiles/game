<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
The exciting sequel to Eye of the Beholder is bigger, better, and
meaner! Forest, temple, catacomb, and three huge towers. More people
to meet, clues to learn, and mysteries to unravel. Better graphics
and important point and click interface make playing even easier.
Lots of new, smarter, meaner monsters - some of the nastiest ones
are human!
</P>

<H2>TIPS</H2>

Load the game as normal and select "CREATE NEW PARTY". When the
empty boxes appear, click on the top left box, then select race,
class, alignment and portrait. Now go to the modify box and
boost all the statistics in this order: STRENGTH, INTELLIGENCE,
WISDOM, DEXTERITY, CONSTITUTION, CHARISMA, AND HIT POINTS. Now
you can click on strength and boost it to maximum, regardless of
limitation put on the race or class of the character, so from
now on, for example, you can have a super-hard wizard with a
strength of 18/99.
</P>

<P>
At the character generation screen, always increase all stats
that you can (that includes hit points) to as high as they will
go.
</P>

<P>
If you want a mage, cleric or paladin to use a two handed
weapon as well as magic, then do the following. Put the weapon
down on the ground, and their spellbook or magic symbol in their
second hand. Click the right mouse button on this for a list of
spells to appear. Pick up the two handed weapon and place it in
the characters primary hand. As the list of spells is still up,
they can now cast spells and use a two handed weapon at the same
time. You will have to repeat this process after using the
compass etc.
</P>

<P>
On the wasp level, stand on the spot where the two rooms join (the
room to the south which has a crack in the wall - the hornet's
nest) and rest. This should generate four wasps which can be
killed easily to gain experience points.
</P>

<H2>EDITING THE SAVE FILE</H2>

<P>
This information contained below will tell you how you can modify
your characters through the use of binary manipulation. It will NOT
tell you how to win the game.
</P>

<P>
Now, in Eye of the Beholder I, there was one save file and one only.
Now I am pretty sure the info contained herein WILL work on Eye of
the Beholder I save files, in fact it was another cheat file like
this one that made me try it on Eye II, but I say again, no
promises. At any rate, in Eye of the Beholder II, there are several
slots in which you can save your game, each with so many characters
in which you can give it an individual name. At any rate, where in
Eye I there was one save file, named EOBDATA.SAV, there are several
in Eye II, one for each save slot, to be exact. These files have
the names EOBDATAx.SAV, where x is a number 0 through 6, I believe.
At any rate, the number on the end corresponds to the distance from
the top slot in the game. Therefore the highest up will be
EOBDATA0.SAV, the next one EOBDATA1.SAV, and so on, until the last
one.
</P>

<P>
Therefore, you must figure out which file contains the data you want
to alter, and then make a backup copy of it. You don't have to, but
if you mess up, and there is no data to restore, then you're stuck
with it. I thought I would warn you in advance, so you don't do
anything stupid. Now, you can either edit the backup file or the
save file, it doesn't really matter. I edit my save file directly,
namely because it saves time. If you edit the backup file, then you
have to rename the original save file to a backup, then copy the
backup file to the save file original name (Eye II WON'T know to
look for BOB.SAV), then run Eye II. It's easier to just edit the
save file directly, copying from the backup file in case you screw
up. You might want to make several backup files, at different
stages of the editing spree, in case you only want to back up one
small step, rather than start over again. But you should be able to
figure out this stuff from common sense, so I will get to the point.
</P>

<P>
Now, you will need a hex editor of some kind. OK, let's start
fiddling. Launch your editor and open the file in question. With
most hex editors, there will be a series of two-digit hex codes to
the left, and the ASCII equivalent to the right (here the ASCII is
shown below). It should look vaguely like the following:
</P>

<P>

</P>

<P>
Now, notice that most of the characters that are represented by hex
numbers other than 00 do not show up. No need to really worry about
that. As long as they are there on the hex side, you're ok.
</P>

<P>
First of all, notice the first line. This represents roughly the
title that appears in the save slot. This will most likely be in
all capitals (I have already done some editing with this file, as
you will see). Eye II automatically throws everything in caps, so
the only way to get them otherwise is to do it yourself here.
</P>

<P>
I will stress now that you want to do most of your editing on the
hex side. Hopefully your editor allows you to edit in either hex or
decimal areas. For names and such you can edit on the text side,
but for the most part you want to play with the hex numbers.
</P>

<P>
After the name, on the second line you will see the name of your
first character (that is, the character in the upper left hand
corner of your six. The next character would be in the upper right
hand corner, then the center ones, left to right, and finally the
bottom ones, left to right). This always starts with the hex
character 01, so leave the character to the left of the name alone.
Now, the name can take up 11 spaces, although I have never tested
that. It might be wise to leave a byte free between the name and
the abilities, which come next. You can type in the name any way
you want, but make sure the characters not taken up by the name are
left as 00.
</P>

<P>
Next come the abilities of your character, in the order Strength,
Percentage, Intelligence, Wisdom, Dexterity, Constitution, and
Charisma. These all take up two bytes apiece, and I assume the
first byte is current score, and the second byte is maximum score.
Whatever the case, make sure they are the same. The numbers are in
hex, so an 18 would be represented by 12, 19 by 13, and so on.
Don't edit in the text side here, because you are dealing with byte
values, not actual numbers. You won't see an 18 in the text, just
the character with the value 18d or 12h (a control character in
ASCII. 19d, or 13h, is the Carriage Return). Oh, by the way, the
percentage is also in hex, but since 2 hex digits will give you a
number as large as 255, you can represent anything from 1 to 100.
So, 64h is the equivalent of 100d. Might as well jack them all of
the way up if you're going to cheat. Now, this only works for
fighters. If you do this to a mage, the game will ignore it.
</P>

<P>
The abilities all take up 14 bytes right after the name. Next is
the hit point value, also in hex, a null byte (00), and then the hit
point value again, followed by another null byte (00). Once again,
I'm guessing, but I think you have current hit points followed by
maximum hit points (for injuries and such). Note the null byte
following each. I assume so this is in case you reach a hit point
total of 256 or higher, which could be feasable in Eye of the
Beholder III. What will happen is the second byte, now null, will
be used as the higher byte, much the way you add a 1 to the left end
of a number, like when 99 goes to 100. More on this later, when we
deal with the experience.
</P>

<P>
Next, there are two bytes, one that might be high up, like FC or so,
followed by one that should be null (00). I don't know what
function these perform, but they seem to be way up there for NPC's
and low for your generated characters.
</P>

<P>
Next is a series of four bytes that are useful only if you really
want to completely change your character:
</P>

<P>
The first byte is the Race and Sex, with even numbers being male,
and odd being female. Thus, 00 and 01 are human male and human
female, respectively. Likewise, the elves take up 02 and 03, the
half-elves have 04 and 05, the dwarves 06 and 07, the gnomes 08 and
09, and the halflings finish it off with 0A and 0B.
</P>

<P>
The next byte following that is pretty important. It states the
class of your character. I don't know all of them, but I have
deduced that 00 is fighter, 01 ranger, 02 paladin, 03 mage, 04
cleric, and 05 is thief. The multi-classed also have a single
digit, with 06 going to fighter/cleric, 07 fighter/thief, and so on.
I don't know all of them, but Amber, the mage/thief on the priets
level, is 0A. So you should be able to deduce the rest through
experimenting, and I will most likely have more complete results in
the next version of this file.
</P>

<P>
The next byte is the alignment of the character, with 00 as lawful
good, 01 neutral good, 02 chaotic good, and so on, ending up with 08
as chaotic evil.
</P>

<P>
The next byte you really shouldn't tangle with unless you want to
change the character's appearance. This byte selects the portrait
used on the screen. I don't know which is which, but each portrait
probably has its own two-digit hex code. Try different numbers and
see what you come up with (hell, you might come up with the head of
a monster!). I do know that the NPC's all have portrait numbers
high up, around FE and FF or so. Most likely the character
portraits are all down in the 00 to 30 range.
</P>

<P>
The byte after that doesn't seem to do much, at least not that I can
figure out, so I leave it alone.
</P>

<P>
The next three bytes detail the character's level. You probably
don't want to toy with these, as they will only be temporary (once
the experience points reach the turning point of a certain level,
they will put the character in that level, even if the level byte
says he's three levels higher). Each byte represents the level in
hex. Most characters will only have one of the three bytes used,
unless they are multi-classed (yeah, one for each class, as three
classes is the max you can have).
</P>

<P>
Then after those three bytes is the experience for each class, which
takes up four bytes apiece. Now, this is where it gets really
tricky. The best way to compute these guys is to have a really good
knowledge of hex, or to use a calculator that can readily convert
between hex and decimal. I use an HP 28S myself.
</P>

<P>
Now, this is tough. Take the four bytes, let's use an example from
one of my files. Calandra (not shown above in the sample text) has
an experience value here of C4 1E 05 00. Now, the right most byte
is the highest byte. To figure out the decimal value, feed in the
hex value byte by byte, starting with the right. So, you would
punch 00 05 1E C4 into your hex calculator (in hex mode, silly) and
convert to decimal. This will result in Calandra having an
experience point value of 335,556 experience points, putting her at
level 9. Now, if you want to have Calandra go up a level, the best
thing to do is not to give her enough points to make her level 10.
Rather, you want to put her at just ONE point below the next level,
that way when she kills a monster next (or anyone in the party
does), she will gain enough to go up automatically. That way her
hit points are updated, as well as the levels, in the save file.
Otherwise, you will confuse the program, and while you may have
enough experience, you will probably not get a level increase,
because the actual point boundary was never CROSSED, but avoided
entirely. I really hope I am making sense.
</P>

<P>
Now, to make Calandra 10th level, let's bump her up to one point
below 10th level boundaries, which are 500,000 for a fighter. So,
punch in 499,999 in decimal to your calculator, and convert to hex,
which should give you the value of 00 07 A1 1F. You would then go
to the hex codes (on the left side, of course) and punch them in
backwards: 1F A1 07 00. Note that you are not punching in the
ENTIRE number in reverse, just the bytes. So if you punched in F1
1A 70 00, you would completly screw your character up. In fact, you
might find the experience point value drastically different than
what you intended. Just thought you should know. That is what
makes it so tricky. Note that the fourth digit will probably be
unused, unless you have a very high experience level. This will
most likely be used in Eye of the Beholder III, when you will
probably be level 15 or higher. Or, because the numbers are
exponential, you might not see it until Eye IV or so.
</P>

<P>
For those of you who do not have hex calculators, there is a way to
figure out what you want, but it's pretty tricky. Each hex digit in
a number, like a decimal number, is nothing more than a digit from 0
to 10 (including A through F in hex) multiplied by a power. For
example, using decimal, 1 is actually 1 times 10 to the power of 0
(which is 1). 10 is actually 1 times 10 to the power of 1 (10)
added to 0 times 10 to the power of 0 (1), resulting in 10.
Therefore, 15 would be 1 times 10 to the power of 1, plus 5 times 10
to the power of 0, resulting in 10 + 5, or 15. Simple, right? One
hopes so (not only will I tell you how to cheat at your game, I will
have given an introductory course in hex math. Wild).
</P>

<P>
Now the principle is the same with hex, only you use sixteen as the
base, rather than 10. So, 01 is 1 times sixteen (or 10 in hex) to
the power of 0 (still 1), 10 is 1 times sixteen to the power of 1
(sixteen) plus 0 times sixteen to the power of 0, resulting in
sixteen (which is hex 10). Likewise, 01 00 is two- hundred
fifty-six, 10 00 is four thousand, ninety-six, 01 00 00 is
sixty-five thousand, five hundred thirty-six (I am spelling them out
so you won't get the humber systems confused), and so on. You will
notice that these numbers tend to resemble computer values in disk
or memory size. That should make sense.
</P>

<P>
At any rate, to figure out the value of Calandra's experience, we
would take the number shown in the file, C4 1E 05 00, write it
backwards (sort of), 00 05 1E C4, and then convert it. 00 can be
discarded, as can the first 0 in the next byte. That leaves us with
5 times 16 to the power of 4 (65536d), plus 1 times 16 to the power
of 3 (4096d), plus E (14d) times 16 to the power of 2 (256d), plus C
(12d) times 16 to the power of 1 (16d), plus 4, which should result
in what we had up above, 335,556. It is a hell of a lot more
tedious, and converting back is an even bigger pain, but if ya have
to...
</P>

<P>
That covers the experience part. The rest iis shaky, but I do know
that there is a great deal of space between the abilities, and the
physical posessions on a character. I can only assume that each
item has it's own two-digit hex code, and the location in the file
pertains to the location on the character's person. Now obviously
there are some places that will not accept certain items (putting
boots on as armor, and the like), so if you mess with those, you
could cause certain items to disappear. At any rate, I plan to
experiment with that next, and see what happens. What I will need
to to is compile a list of items and their respective hex codes, and
then list the places in order on the file. Most likely they
progress logically in the file, much the same as the characters do.
It's easier on the programmers to promote order, especially when it
comes to debugging.
</P>

<P>
And finally, there must be a location section, that states where the
characters are in the dungeon, what level, what square, what doors
are open, what monsters have been killed, do they have the mark of
darkmoon, do they have the pieces of talon, have they trapped the
medusas, what doors are open, etc etc etc. Because this stuff is
all incomplete, I plan to do more research at a later date. For
now, I will be content with what I have here, and hopefully you all
will too.
</P>

<H2>SOLVE</H2>

<H3>GENERAL</H3>

<P>
EYE OF THE BEHOLDER 2 (EOB 2) is similar to the prequel in the
graphics and sounds departments. Anyone who has played the first
game should feel right at home here within the first few minutes of
game play. But don't get too comfortable! Although the individual
levels in this dungeon are generally smaller and less complicated
than those in the first game, this is no cakewalk.
</P>

<P>
Survival is the biggest challenge in the game. You may generate new
characters for this game who will start at about level 7, or you may
elect to transfer your more powerful party from the first game.
Don't expect to see a lot of character advancements. New characters
will probably advance to level 10 or 11 by the end of the game.
This was no doubt planned in the design phase in anticipation of a
third game in the series.
</P>

<P>
Combat is very tightly balanced. Some monsters overwhelm your party
with sheer numbers while others can cast magic spells that can
destroy most of your party in the first round. You will need to
devise special strategies against different enemies, even spells and
items to be used against them should be planned out ahead of time to
insure success.
</P>

<P>
Unlike the first game in which there was a specific number of
monsters on each level and they did not randomly regenerate, most
monsters do regenerate in this sequel so that you can never clean
out a level and expect to explore in peace.
</P>

<P>
One very useful tactic in fighting really deadly monsters is the
melee-sidestep tactic. Here's a brief description for those not
familiar with it: when your party encounters a specially powerful
monster, back up immediately after each blow to keep out of melee
range. Check your map and look for any nearby area that is at least
2X2 in size. Continue to attack and then back up and lure the
monster into the area you have chosen.
</P>

<P>
Once you reach this area, attack the monster and then immediately
step to one side. If the monster also sidesteps to face you again,
hit it once and them immediately sidestep again. Do not try to
strike more than one blow as that might give it enough time to make
an attack. The idea is to keep attacking and staying out of its
range. It's tedious, but very effective against monsters that can
do serious damage with just one blow. Timing is often critical when
you use this tactic. You might wish to use a combination of the
mouse and the keyboard or even the keyboard alone. Practice makes
perfect!
</P>

<P>
You should definitely include a mage and a cleric in your party,
together with a couple of fighters. Certain rooms can only be
entered if you have a thief in your party. The thief however,
serves no other purpose and I do not recommend including one in your
starting party. You can recruit someone later in the game. I
should also point out that the cleric profession in EOB 2 comes with
the CREATE FOOD spell, which is essential to completing the game,
since it did not appear that there were enough rations to be found
in the game. Also, remember to use the Scribe Scroll to Spell book
option each time you pick up a mage scroll.
</P>

<P>
The dungeon levels are quite small, but the stairs gave me a lot of
problems as they did not necessarily lead to a different level. I
followed this rule of thumb when drawing the maps: whenever I took
a set of stairs, if the game stopped to load more data from the
disk, then I assumed the stairs led to a new level. I also marked
each matching pair of upstairs and downstairs with the same letter
in the hope that this would make it a bit easier for you to follow
the trail.
</P>

<IMG SRC=eyeofthebeholder2/symbols.gif ALT="Map - Legend">

<H3>FOREST AREA</H3>

<IMG SRC=eyeofthebeholder2/forest.gif ALT="Map - Forest Area">

<P>
This is an easy area. The only enemies you face here are the dire
wolves. They are not that ferocious and shouldn't give your party
too much trouble at all.
</P>

<P>
Pick up the rocks at (1) and (2). At (3) you will meet a woman who
wish to lead you to the Temple of Dark Moon. If you accept, the
game will whisk you directly in front of the temple. Since you are
quite done with the forest area yet, you should decline. As an
alternative, you can also kill her at this time. If you do, you
will get to read a parchment that hints at something rotten going on
inside the temple. If you decide to just decline her offer, she
will pop up somewhere else in the forest.
</P>

<P>
Take the stairs A to the hidden area of the forest. Here you will
find the mage scroll of BLUR (4), some rotten food (5) and leather
armor (6). Return to the forest and pick up the rusty dagger at (7)
and the rocks at (8) and (9). The two arrows at (10) should come in
handy later. (11) is a grave. There are five of them. You have
the option to dig up the graves but don't do it. There's nothing
valuable to be found and you will find your characters cursed for
their trouble.
</P>

<P>
That's all there is to discover in the forest. When you are all
set, go to location B where you will enter the Temple of Darkmoon.
</P>

<H3>TEMPLE OF DARKMOON GROUND LEVEL</H3>

<IMG SRC=eyeofthebeholder2/ground0.gif ALT="Map - Ground Level">

<P>
After entering the temple, there are several ways to continue. At
(1) if you smash the decorative windows on the north and south
walls, the 2 clerics will attack you. If you do not break the
windows at (1), then you will carry on a conversation with the
clerics at (2). You can also choose to attack them here. If you do
not attack them at (2), then you will meet another character at (3)
and learn about another missing person, Calandra. Choose any course
of action you like. It will not alter the rest of the game.
</P>

<P>
At (4) Note the 4 wind carving on the north wall. This will be
important later. At (5) is a door which you can open by pushing the
button on the right. If you haven't fought it out with the clerics
up to this point, they will forbid you from entering the door. If
you want to see more of the game, you must ignore them and enter the
doorway. At this point in time, the clerics will attack you, and
you may as well take care of them now.
</P>

<P>
You may argue that in this situation you are really the aggressor
and that there isn't enough justifiable reason to kill the clerics.
I'll just say that in order to carry on with the game, the clerics
have to be killed sooner or later, and leave the moral issue for you
to mull over.
</P>

<P>
At (6) there is a secret button on the west wall. Push it to open
the wall and reveal a teleporter. This teleporter leads to a small
resurrection chamber. At (7) is a plaque that tells you may use the
service of this chamber 3 times. At (8) is a holy symbol that takes
care of the actual resurrection process. We will be returning to
this area later in the game.
</P>

<P>
Here's a little surprise: There are actually _two_ identical
chambers. When you use the teleporters at (9), you will be
teleported randomly either to the temple ground level or to the
other chamber. You are allowed to use the holy symbol for
resurrection 3 times in one chamber only. The holy symbol in the
second chamber has no power. A good trick would be to drop a rock
or a bone in front of the holy symbol in one chamber. This way you
can quickly identify which room you have arrived at after using the
teleporter. I could not find any other use or purpose for the
second chamber.
</P>

<P>
If you have trouble using the teleporter(s) to return to the temple
ground level, try facing west and walking _backwards_ into the
teleporter.
</P>

<P>
We'll now do some serious dungeon exploration by taking the stairs C
down to the Temple Undergrounds.
</P>

<H3>UNDERGROUND LEVEL 1</H3>

<IMG SRC=eyeofthebeholder2/ground1.gif ALT="Map - Underground Level 1">

<P>
After descending Stairs C, pick up the rock at (1). There's a
keyhole at (2) but you don't have a key for that yet. Pick up two
more rocks at (3) and then open the west door at (4) by pushing the
button. There is another rock at (5). When you step on the
pressure plate at (6) the door to the north opens. Get ready to
fight a few guards at (7). You'll get a grey key, plus a weapon or
two as loot.
</P>

<P>
Push the lever at (8) to open the north door. You'll have another
guard to fight. Smash the barrel at (9) to get iron ration. There
are more iron rations on the alcoves at (10) and (11).
</P>

<P>
There is a pressure plate at (12) that opens the door to the east.
But the plate must be weighed down for the door to stay open. Drop
a rock at (12) and then enter through the door. There are a couple
of guards at (13) that you must take care of. Be sure to pick up
the lock picks after the fight. (14) is an empty barrel. You'll
find rations after smashing the barrels at (15) and (17). The
barrel at (16) contains 3 bags of magic dust which can cure
paralysis.
</P>

<P>
At (18) check out the east wall for a secret button. Push it to
reveal stairs H leading to Underground Level 2. But we want to
finish exploring level 1 before going down there. There is another
grey key in the niche at (19). You are probably tempted to try out
the grey key(s) in the keyhole at (20). But for reasons that will
be obvious later, let's not do that yet. We'll return to here after
we finish checking out the rest of this level.
</P>

<P>
Retrace your steps to (2). Use the one of the grey keys in the
keyhole. The door to the east is now open. Pick up the two rocks
at (21). Push the lever at (22) to fill in the pit to the south.
The pressure plate at (23) opens the east door and re-opens the pit
now behind you. You will have to stand your ground against 4 guards
that emerge from the door. You'll get 2 more grey keys after
defeating them.
</P>

<P>
The lever at (24) fills in the pit once more. Look for a secret
button at (25) to open up the secret passage to the east. Use a
grey key in the keyhole at (26) to open the south door. There are
more guards to fight here. There's an old dagger in the basin at
(27). Use another grey key in the keyhole at (28) to open the south
door. After defeating the guards that emerge, pick up the north
wind horn at (29). Read the parchment lying beside it. That should
give you a good idea where to use the horn and its three companions
when you find them.
</P>

<P>
As soon as you step on (30), the door to the north east will open.
There are two more guards that you have to defeat. You'll get
another grey key for your effort.
</P>

<P>
Now that we have explored all of this level, return to (20). Use a
grey key in the keyhole to open the south door. IMPORTANT: Before
entering the door, be sure to rest to recover all hit points and
spells.
</P>

<P>
At (31) you will find Insal the thief. Allow him to join the party
and feed him a food ration so he doesn't starve. Give him the lock
pick but nothing else. Put him in the middle row of your party so
that he doesn't get hit easily by during enemy encounters.
</P>

<P>
There are several doors in the game that can only be opened by a
thief picking the locks. There are no keys or other means to open
these particular doors. That's the main reason for recruiting
Insal. However, Insal will leave the first time you rest your
party. Thus, we must make a couple of detours and visit the doors
that require Insal's lock picking skill before the party has to rest
again.
</P>

<P>
Take the nearby stairs labelled H down to Underground Level 2.
</P>

<H3>UNDERGROUND LEVEL 2</H3>

<IMG SRC=eyeofthebeholder2/ground2.gif ALT="Map - Underground Level 2">

<P>
This level is populated by a few poisonous spiders, hence the webs
you see from time to time that block your path. The webs can be
easily destroyed by swinging your weapons at them.
</P>

<P>
Pick up the rocks at (1), (2) and (3). Be sure that you get all the
loots at (4) which include a cleric scroll of Neutralize Poison, a
mage scroll of Magic Missile and a copper key. There is also a
parchment here which showed part of the layout of level 1 and 2.
(Actually the parchment might be a hint that this region should be
part of level 1, but I had lots of trouble in accounting for the
stairs.)
</P>

<P>
You may want to check out the loop to the east. There is nothing
noteworthy there except you will be ambushed by a couple of spiders
each time you go through the loop. Note that you cannot open the
secret passage north shown on the map from the south. Return to
level 1 via stairs H.
</P>

<P>
Using the map GROUND1.IFF, find your way to stairs G and take it to
get to the other area on level 2.
</P>

<P>
Stairs G lead to a very short hallway with two doors. Push the
button on the door at (5) to open it. The only interesting thing to
note here is that if you fall through the pit on level 1 (there's
only 1 pit on level 1), you end up behind this door. The door can
then be opened by throwing a rock at it.
</P>

<P>
There is a keyhole at (6). Unfortunately I never found a key that
would fit it. Save the game here and then try picking the lock by
clicking the lockpicks over it. You may have to do it several
times. (Note that if you do not have a thief in your party, the
game will not allow lockpicking to take place.) If the lock pick
breaks, restore the game and try again. Successfully picking this
lock will open the door to the east. Pick up the skull and the mage
scroll of Lightning Bolt at (7). Return to level 1 via the stairs
labelled G.
</P>

<P>
On level 1, using the map GROUND1.IFF, locate the set of stairs
labelled C and take them back to the Temple Ground Level (GROUND0).
Take the stairs labelled D up to the Cleric Barracks (BARRACK).
</P>

<H3>CLERIC BARRACKS</H3>

<IMG SRC=eyeofthebeholder2/barrack.gif ALT="Map - Cleric Barracks">

<P>
Shortly after arriving at this level, you will confront an angry
priest. Your choices are limited. Attack him.
</P>

<P>
The reason why we are on this level at this time is that we need
Insal's lockpicking skill to open three doors on this level that
would otherwise remain close for the entire game. This being a
walkthru, I need to provide you with a solution that will let you
see as much of the game as possible.
</P>

<P>
As I have said before, Insal will leave as soon as the party tries
to rest. So what we need to do here is to survive without resting
until Insal can get the three doors opened. Your opponents on this
level are clerics. To a party with low level characters, they can
be rather tough. Be sure to save the game after each successful
battle.
</P>

<P>
Use the copper key in the keyhole at (2) to open the door to the
east. Pick the lock at (3) to open the north door. Pick up the
mage scroll of invisibility at (4).
</P>

<P>
Push the button on the door at (5) to open it. There are a lock
pick and a spell book at (6). At (7) push the button on the east
door to open it. Click on the bed at (8) and you will find another
copper key.
</P>

<P>
Use the copper key at the keyhole at (7) to open the south door.
There are 4 clerics that you must defeat at the other side of this
door and you will get another copper key once you beat them. You
can open the door at (9) by pushing the button on the door, but
there is nothing behind it. Do not waste time at the next door to
the south that is guarded by a magic mouth. It will be quite a
while later before you can get through that.
</P>

<P>
Use Insal's lockpicking skill at (10) to open the door to the north.
Pick up 2 magic dusts at (11). Next pick the lock at (12) to open
the door to the south. You should find a magic dust, a complete set
of elf bones and a parchment at (13). Reading the parchment will
reveal that the elf bones belong to Amber, the scout sent by
Khelben.
</P>

<P>
When you step on (14), the door to the south will open and you will
be attacked by another group of clerics. Pick the lock at (15) to
open the west door. (16) is a stone portal. Players of EYE 1 will
recognize it immediately. The portal can only be activated by stone
artifacts that you will find later in the game. There is a very
handy mage scroll of Improved Identify as well as another copper key
at (17). At (18) there is a button for opening/closing the door.
</P>

<P>
At this point, Insal has served his purpose. Drop him from the
party by CAMPING and then selecting the proper option from the menu.
(If you let him leave by himself while you rest, he will steal
things from your inventory!) Take a well deserved rest here to
recover hit points and spells.
</P>

<P>
Use a copper key in the keyhole at (19) to open the north door.
Push the button on the door at (20) to open it. Inside the room is
a cleric scroll of Create Food at (21). At (22) you have the
opportunity to eavesdrop on a conversation, after which you will
fight a couple more clerics. The button on the door at (23) opens
it but there is nothing of interest inside.
</P>

<P>
Retrace your steps to (24). There is a statue here. Swing your
weapons to destroy the statue. You will find a button on the wall
after hacking the statue to pieces. Push the button to open up the
passage south. At the end of the passage, you are surrounded by
three teleportation fields. The ones to the south and east simply
move you to just outside the door of the stone portal room. But the
one to the west will teleport you to the Soft Floor Room
(NTALON&SOFTFLR).
</P>

<H3>SOFT FLOOR ROOM</H3>

<IMG SRC=eyeofthebeholder2/ntalon&softflr.gif ALT="Map - Soft Floor Room">

<P>
You arrive at (1) in this room. There is a blue gem here.
Elsewhere in this 3X3 room, you should find a copper key, a green
gem and a red gem at (2), (3) and (4). In the center of the room is
a soft spot, but you won't be able to do much there at the moment.
</P>

<P>
Each of the 4 secret passages shown on the map can only be opened if
you place all three gems (blue, green and red) in the same alcove.
The gems will be gone forever as soon as the wall disappears to
reveal the passage. This means that you can only access one out of
the four hidden areas. Here's a description of what you will find
in each area to help you decide which passage you wish to access.
</P>

<P>
The eastern passage leads to some very nice items: you will find a
cleric scroll of Raise Dead, a +2 2-handed sword, a +3 platemail, a
ring of adornment, a skull, a femur, a parchment from Lord James of
Natingdale and a tropelet seed at (5). Unfortunately, the plaque at
(6) happens to be true. This is a trap with no way out. You will
be stuck here if you choose the eastern passage.
</P>

<P>
The northern passage leads to a door. When you step on (7), two
darts will be fired at you from the south. They will miss if you
are prepared and move away quickly enough. There is a warning
plaque at (8) and you will be attacked by clerics there. A tropelet
seed is all you get for your trouble.
</P>

<P>
The western passage leads to a 2-handed sword, 4 iron rations and a
tropelet seed at (9). There are 4 more iron rations at (10).
</P>

<P>
Personally, I think the southern passage is the most rewarding. At
(11) is a plaque that reads "Emergency supplies". You will find a
wand of magic missiles, a mage scroll of lightning bolt and a
tropelet seed at (12). At (13) there are 2 potions of extra
healing, a potion of vitality and a potion of healing.
</P>

<P>
When you are ready to leave the Soft Floor Room, stand one square
away from the center of the room. Then drop the tropelet seed on
the soft spot (14) (select the seed then click it on the round
spot). A teleportation field will appear. This will bring you back
to the exact same place you were before on the Cleric Barracks
level.
</P>

<P>
You have explored all you can on the Barracks level. Take the set
of stairs labelled D to return to the temple ground level.
(GROUND0). Use the teleporter T to go to the resurrection chamber.
At (7), click on the holy symbol on the wall. You will now be
offered an option to resurrect Amber, who turns out to be a female
thief/mage. It's up to you whether you want her in your party.
Return to (6) by walking backward into either teleport T1.
</P>

<P>
We are now ready to resume our exploration of the underground. Take
the stairs labelled C down to Underground Level 1 (GROUND1). Use
the map to get to the stairs labelled F. When you emerge from the
stairs F, location (32), check for a secret button on the east wall.
This opens a hidden niche which contains a sling and a cleric scroll
of Raise Dead. Follow the corridor and take the stairs labelled I
down to Underground Level 3 (GROUND3).
</P>

<H3>UNDERGROUND LEVEL 3</H3>

<IMG SRC=eyeofthebeholder2/ground3.gif ALT="Map - Underground Level 3">

<P>
Use a grey key in the keyhole at (1) to open the door to the west.
Location (2) is kind of tricky. Whenever you step here, you trigger
a fireball to shoot at you from the north. There is also a lever
here on the west wall. What you need to do here is face the west
wall, then step up to (2), quickly pull the lever and then back up.
If you do it fast enough, you can avoid the fireball. You may wish
to use the keyboard to control the movements and use the mouse to
click on the lever. Once you pull the lever, a skull key will
appear in the alcove at (3).
</P>

<P>
Use the skull key at the skull lock at (4) to open the west door.
When you step on (5), the door to the north will open and you will
be attacked by 4 undead warriors. The undead warriors can be quite
troublesome for a low level party. You should use the fight and
move technique whenever possible. Same thing happens at (6). When
you get here, the door to the east will open and you will be
attacked by a mixed group of cleric and warriors. You will get
another skull key after defeating this group. On the other side of
this door (7) is a button that opens/closes the door. This will
come in rather handy, as we shall soon see.
</P>

<P>
Use a skull key in the keyhole at (8) to open the door to the north.
At (9) there are another skull key, a +1 robe and a +2 dagger. (10)
is a door that can be forced open. You should save the game here.
Behind this door are many undead warriors and clerics (I counted
24!) waiting to do battle with you.
</P>

<P>
This is one technique that worked for me: after forcing open the
door at (10), take 2 steps inside to attract the attention of the
enemies. Back out immediately. Wait for the enemies to pursue, and
then lure them out of that area until you are standing at the
doorway between (6) and (7). Don't move too fast. If you lose
sight of them, they may not pursue you. Once you get to the
doorway, turn around and fight them. Save the game here when you
have a chance.
</P>

<P>
There are two reasons to choose this particular spot to fight.
First, this guarantees that you will not be attacked from the sides
or from behind. Second, when your characters need to recuperate,
you can back up one position and push the button to close the door.
If you time it properly, you can close the door and isolate yourself
in the room. (The door cannot be opened from the other side!) This
allows you the opportunity to rest and recover all of the hit points
and spells. When you are ready, open the door, quickly step up to
the doorway and fight again.
</P>

<P>
Beware that sometimes the enemies come in groups. After you
dispatch one group, there may still be more waiting back behind the
door that you forced open. As I said previously, I killed 24
warriors and clerics before I could move around freely inside the
forced door. At (11) there is a cleric scroll of Neutralize Poison.
At (12) there are 2 iron rations, a cleric scroll of Cure Serious
Wounds, a helmet and a +2 short sword "Sting". Finally at (13)
there are a cleric scroll of Neutralize Poison and a Darkmoon Key.
</P>

<P>
Retrace your steps and explore the east side of the entry stairs.
Go through the illusion wall at the SE corner to location (14). A
secret button on the south wall here opens up the passage south.
Push the button on the door at (15) to open it. You'll have to do
another battle here with warriors and clerics.
</P>

<P>
At (16) use the last skull key to open the door. There are two
clerics to fight here. You will get a cleric holy symbol and
another Darkmoon key when you defeat them. Push the button on the
door at (18) to open it. There isn't anything behind that east
door. The door at (19) can also be opened by pushing the button on
the door, if it's not opened already.
</P>

<P>
There are a pile of things to be picked up at (20): a skull key, an
iron ration, a +1 helmet, a +1 long sword, a +1 shield, +2 plate
mail and a spell book. At (21) you come face to face with Calandra,
the sister of the woman you met when you first entered the temple.
She is a level 9 fighter. Decide whether you want her in your party
or not.
</P>

<P>
At (22) you should find 2 clerics waiting for you. There's no
choice here but to fight them. At (23) there is button on the north
wall that opens the door to the south. At (24) the button on the
south wall opens the north door. There is a complete set of Elf
bones at (25). This should be picked up and carried.
</P>

<P>
At (26) the button on the north wall opens the south door. At (27)
you will meet and free another prisoner, Shorn Diergar who is a
dwarven cleric/fighter. You'll have to decide if you want him to
join the party.
</P>

<P>
At (28) and (29), there are buttons on the south and north walls
respectively that open the doors on the opposite side. Push the
button on the south wall at (30) to open the north door. There is a
skull at (31). Finally, open the south door at (32) by pushing the
button. There is a femur bone at (33). At (34) there are a potion
of vitality and a potion of cure poison.
</P>

<P>
The secret passage shown in this area can only be opened from the
east side (35). If you wish to try it, retrace your step to (35).
You'll find a secret button on the west wall which reveals the
passage.
</P>

<P>
The two Darkmoon keys that you have been carrying around can now be
used in the keyholes at (36) and (37). At (38) you will get a
vision of Khelben and sort of a recap of the story so far. There is
also a door to the west at (38) that you can open by pushing the
button on the door. There are quite a few things in this room: the
East Wind Horn, 2 potions of healing, a potion of speed and a
parchment which hints at a hidden passage. At (40) there is another
parchment which confirms the existence of a hidden passage.
</P>

<P>
There is yet another parchment at (41). You'll have to interpret
the significance of this one yourself. I never quite figured that
out. There are pressure plate at (42), (43) and (44). The first
time that you turn and step forward on each one, a fireball will
shoot at you from the wall you face. All of them can be avoided by
going backward and then ducking sideways when possible. There is
nothing noteworthy behind the plates at (42) and (43).
</P>

<P>
Step on the plate at (44), then back up to location (38) and then
sidestep once to the east. After the fireball misses, you can step
back onto (44) again without triggering another fireball. Examine
the east wall at (45). Swing your weapon at the wall. (You may
have to do that more than once). The wall will crumble and reveal
stairs going down. (Labelled O on the map)
</P>

<P>
At this point, you should return to the resurrection chamber and
resurrect the set of Elf bones that you found at location (25).
This turns out to be San Raal, a level 8 mage. Again you have to
decide if you want him to join your party.
</P>

<P>
Return to the stairs labelled O on Underground Level 3. The next
level is the infamous "no rest" level where your party is not
allowed to rest until the escape route is discovered. Thus you
should take the time to prepare the party as thoroughly as possible.
Have your cleric cast a Create Food spell. Carefully select all the
spells you wish your mage(s) to memorize and your cleric(s) to pray
for. Then rest until everyone is completely healed. Take the
stairs down to Underground Level 4.
</P>

<H3>UNDERGROUND LEVEL 4</H3>

<IMG SRC=eyeofthebeholder2/ground4.gif ALT="Map - Underground Level 4">

<P>
Resting is not allowed on this level. Therefore, the main goal here
is to discover at least one of the 2 escape routes as soon as
possible before fully exploring the rest of the area. When your
mage(s) and cleric(s) use up their spells, use the scrolls and
potions that you have accumulated in order to survive. The
margoyles that inhabit this level can be quite tough on low level
parties. Use the fight/move tactic whenever possible to minimize
injury.
</P>

<P>
The plaque at (1) gives an ominous warning. The plate on the floor
at (2) closes the entry door. This cannot be avoided. It is
impossible to return to level 3 through that door. Go all the way
to the end of this corridor then turn west and follow the trail all
the way to the end. Go north 4 spaces and then west. Go through
the illusion wall shown on the map. Get the spider key, the potion
of healing and the skull at (3).
</P>

<P>
Retrace your steps and open the door at (4) by pushing the button on
the door. Pick up the mage scroll of Remove Curse at (5). Push the
button on the door at (6) to open it. Use the spider key in the
keyhole at (7) to open the middle south door. There are buttons at
(8) and (9) that open the other 2 doors. However, it is better to
leave those 2 doors closed to reduce the chances of getting ambushed
on 2 sides.
</P>

<P>
In order to open the door behind the 9 pressure plates in this room,
weigh down the plates at the 4 corners as well as the one in the
center with items. A good choice would be all those rocks that you
have been gathering up to this point.
</P>

<P>
There are quite a few margoyles behind that door. One good thing to
try is to weigh down the 4 plates at the corners and then stand on
the middle plate. This opens the door. As soon as a margoyle
appears through the door, step away from the middle plate and the
door will close. This will ensure that you only have to fight one
margoyle at a time, which makes the "fight and move" tactic much
more effective. Repeat this until no more margoyle appears. Weigh
down the middle plate with another rock to keep the door permanently
open and enter it.
</P>

<P>
There is a secret button at (10) that opens up the passage to the
north. Pick up 3 iron potions and another spider key at (11). At
(12) is a stone portal similar to the one seen on the cleric
barracks level. At (13) there are a mage scroll of Haste, a +1 robe
and an amulet. Go south through the secret passage again then go
through the illusion wall at the SW corner and another one to the
north.
</P>

<P>
There are lots of items to get in this room. Push the secret button
at (14) to reveal the western passage. Pick up a long bow, 8 arrows
and a +3 cloak "Moonshade". At (16) there are an axe, a glass
sphere (shoots 1 Fireball), a spider key and a stone gem. At (17)
there are a potion of healing, a potion of extra healing, 2 arrows,
a glass sphere and a Dark Moon key.
</P>

<P>
The stone gem can be used with the stone portal at (12). Click the
stone gem on the portal and your entire party will be teleported to
the portal on the cleric barracks level where you can rest. To
return, simply click the stone gem on that portal. Now that we have
the ability to rest and recover lost hit points and spell, we can
explore the rest of the underground much more leisurely.
</P>

<P>
Use the map to go to (18) at the NW corner of the level. Use the
spider key in the keyhole to open the west door. Take the stairs
labelled P down to Underground 5.
</P>

<H3>UNDERGROUND LEVEL 5 (GROUND5)</H3>

<IMG SRC=eyeofthebeholder2/ground5.gif ALT="Map - Underground Level 5">

<P>
Level 5 is the lowest underground level. This is a rather small
level and the only out is through the set of stairs labelled P.
Resting is also not allowed on this level. Huge ants are the
enemies on this level, but they are far weaker than the margoyles.
</P>

<P>
There are no puzzles or secrets to fathom on this level. I'll just
highlight the locations of the various loots and items. At (1)
there are a silver key, a rock, 2 femurs and 2 skulls. At (2) there
are a +2 "Sa Shull" dagger, a femur, a skull and 2 rocks. At (3)
there are 2 femurs.
</P>

<P>
Be sure to pick up the west wind horn at (4). Here you'll also find
leather boots, +1 long sword, helmet, platemail and potion of Cure
Poison. There are many items lying on the floor at locations (5)
through (9). You'll find a skull, a helmet, a long sword, chain
mail, a dagger, a Dark Moon key, 2 femurs, a shield, leather boots,
2 more daggers and 3 darts.
</P>

<P>
Once you have gathered as much as you want, return to Underground
Level 4 again via the stairs P.
</P>

<H3>UNDERGROUND LEVEL 4</H3>

<P>
From the stairs labelled P, go south to location (3). Push the
button on the south door to open it. The pressure plate at (19)
opens the south door. There are a skull and a +1 staff at (20).
You should save the game at this point.
</P>

<P>
As soon as you try to pick up any of the items at (21), the two
secret eastern passages will open while at the same time, the door
will close. And you will be surround by about half a dozen
margoyles. The fight is tough but certainly not impossible, even
for a low level party. The items at (21) are a cursed sword "Hath
Kull", a +5 bracer of Protection and a +1 shield. There is a button
on the east wall at (22) which opens the door again.
</P>

<P>
The spider keyhole at (23) opens the door leading to the stone
portal room. The doors at (24) and (25) are opened by pushing the
buttons on the doors. There is nothing behind either door. When
you step on (26) the first time, the door will close on you. But it
can be reopened by pushing the button on the door.
</P>

<P>
There is a button on the north wall at (27) that turns off all 4
spinners that are shown on the map. It doesn't seem to serve any
other purpose. The doors at (28) through (32) can all be opened by
pushing the door buttons. There is a secret button at (33) that
opens up the passage east. Another button at (34) opens up the
northern passage. You will fight a margoyle here (35) that will get
you a grey key.
</P>

<P>
Use the two Dark Moon keys in the keyholes at (36) and (37). A
spider key will work with the lock at (38) and open up the door to
the north. Be sure to check out the alcove to the east at (39) and
pick up the South Wind horn and another Dark Moon key. Take the
stairs M. At (40), use the grey key in the keyhole to reveal a
hidden alcove. You will find a mage scroll of Fireball, a mage
scroll of Shocking Grasp, a mage scroll of Detect Magic and a cleric
scroll of Raise Dead. Take the stairs L to Underground Level 3.
</P>

<H3>UNDERGROUND LEVEL 3</H3>

<P>
Once you emerge from the stairs L, follow the very short hallway to
Stairs K, which lead to Underground Level 2.
</P>

<H3>UNDERGROUND LEVEL 2</H3>

<P>
From the stairs K, go west and take the stairs J. When you arrive
at the other end, you will see a few weapons lying on the ground at
(8). _All_ these weapons are cursed! They are: -2 dagger
"Vargon", -3 long sword, -2 mace "thumper".
</P>

<P>
At (9) you will find another keyhole where your last Dark Moon key
will fit. This opens up the southern passage which will lead you to
Stairs H that return to Underground Level 1. Watch out for spiders.
</P>

<H3>UNDERGROUND LEVEL 1</H3>

<P>
Use the map to navigate from Stairs H to Stairs C. These are the
stairs that return to the ground level of the temple itself. Your
underground sojourn is complete but there is still a lot of game to
go through.
</P>

<H3>TEMPLE OF DARKMOON GROUND LEVEL</H3>

<P>
Stand in front of the 4-wind carving at (4). Use the 4 horns in
succession. (You do this by putting each horn in a character's hand
and then _right_ click.) The carving disappears, revealing a
northern passage that leads to stairs E. We now begin our ascent to
the 4-wind Tower.
</P>

<H3>4-WIND TOWER LEVEL 1</H3>

<IMG SRC=eyeofthebeholder2/4wind1.gif ALT="Map - Wind Tower Level 1">

<P>
As soon as you come out of Stairs E, you will be greeted with a
vision that informs you about the Test of Faith. To the east is an
area covered with circular plates. Some plates are lit with a
steady blue light. The light moves over the rest of the plates
following specific patterns. Anytime you are on a plate that's lit,
you lose a big chunk of your hit points. A low level character will
only be able to withstand two to three zaps.
</P>

<P>
The optimum path to take to go through this area was outlined on the
map. Stand just to the west of the first tile. Be sure everyone is
well rested. Open your mage spell book to your favorite offensive
spell. (You will have a very tough fight at the other end.) Also be
sure to have a cleric spells of Remove Paralysis ready. Needless to
say, you should also have a saved game at this point just in case.
</P>

<P>
Wait till the light hits the tile just to the east. As soon as the
light moves away, start your jog to the east. Make your moves in
sync with the movement of the light beam. Whenever you have to
change direction, turn and face the new direction instead of
sidestepping. More than likely, you will get zapped once before you
reach the final tile. The tile marked with a dot enclosed in a
rectangle opens the passages to the east.
</P>

<P>
More than likely, your way east will be blocked by a Mantis Warrior
as you reach the last plate. Very quickly cast your offensive mage
spell and use your front 2 fighters to overwhelm the mantis. As
soon as it is destroyed, step forward to move away from the plate.
Your trouble is not yet over. You must defeat the 3 or 4 Mantis
Warriors waiting for you. Most mage spells such as Fireballs,
Lightning, Magic Missiles etc. work well against them. When you
defeat them, you will find a bone key and a dagger for your effort.
</P>

<P>
Use the bone key in the keyhole at (3) to open the north door. The
door at (4) is opened by pushing the button on the door. There is
an egg at (5). A Mantis Warrior emerges from the egg if you swing
your weapon at it. At (6) is a lever. Push it to turn off the
moving light beam. This will make your return trip much easier.
</P>

<P>
Push the button on the door at (7) to open it. The plaques at (8)
and (10) both contain cryptic messages subject to various
interpretations. Put something worthless (a rock or a skull) in the
triangular alcove at (9) and it will turn into a wand of lightning.
This only works once.
</P>

<P>
At the very south end of the eastern hallway (11) is a -2 cursed
long sword "Hunger". Take it and put it in inventory. Be careful
not to equip any character with this sword.
</P>

<P>
Follow the same path to return to the area near the stairs. As a
point of interest: at location (12) is a -2 cursed axe. There is
no reason to get that and the tile it is on is still illuminated by
the lethal light anyway.
</P>

<P>
At (13) push the button on the north door to open it. You'll find a
wounded Mantis at (14). You have the option of healing or attacking
it. If you heal it, it will wind up attacking you. Either way, the
result is the same. You must kill it and receive a mantis key in
return. Again at (13) push the button on the east door to open it.
You will find a prisoner there who will ask to join your party.
This is Tanglor, a level 7 half-elven fighter/cleric. Decide for
yourself if you want him in your party. Incidentally, this is the
last character you will find in this game that can join your party.
At (16) is a +1 short sword and a +1 shield.
</P>

<P>
At (17) both the north and west doors can be opened by pushing the
buttons on them. There is a +1 polearm at (18).
</P>

<P>
At (19) there is yet another lit plate. There is no avoiding this
one. Walk across it and take the damage. At (20) you will be
ambushed by a mantis warrior. It helps when you know it's coming.
The south door at (21) can be forced open. Inside you will find a
magic mouth at (22). The hint it has is plain enough. Feed it
three femurs and it will give you a bone key.
</P>

<P>
Push the button on the west door at (21) to open it. Use the mantis
key in the keyhole at (23) to open the door. At (24) you will be
told that some mantis warriors just threw a glass sphere at you. As
soon as the scene changes, sidestep to the left. You should be able
to easily avoid getting hit by the glass sphere (fireball).
</P>

<P>
At (25) you will see a pit two tiles away at (27). You should also
notice that there is a button on the south wall behind the pit.
Throw a rock at the south wall. It will hit the button and the
south wall as well as the pit at (27) will both disappear. However,
a new pit now appears at (26). Push the button on the east wall at
(25) to fill in this new pit. It is now safe to go south all the
way to the end of the corridor. You will find a mantis key and the
rock that you threw at (28).
</P>

<P>
Push the button on the door at (29) to open it. There are a mage
scroll of Dispel Magic and a mage scroll of Blur at (30). Push the
button on the door at (31) to open it. There is an iron ration at
(32).
</P>

<P>
Use the mantis key in the keyhole at (33) to open the door to the
south. This is a room full of mantis eggs. You have to swing your
weapon at the eggs one at a time and defeat each mantis warriors
that emerge from each egg. If you don't do this, you will be
ambushed by several warriors when you get to the south end of the
room.
</P>

<P>
Take the green gem from the carving at (34) and then put the gem
back in the carving again. This opens up the secret passage south.
At (35) pick up a Mantis idol, a glass sphere and a copper key.
</P>

<P>
Retrace your steps to (36). Use the copper key in the keyhole to
open the west door. Take the stairs A to 4-Wind Tower Level 2.
</P>

<H3>4-WIND TOWER LEVEL 2</H3>

<IMG SRC=eyeofthebeholder2/4wind2.gif ALT="Map - Wind Tower Level 2">

<P>
This level is inhabited by wasps, lots and lots of wasps. They are
not very strong, but they are fast. And their sting can be
poisonous and may cause paralysis as well. After climbing the
stairs A, the best way to travel is to go all the way to the west
and then turn south, hugging the west walls whenever possible until
you reach location (1). Here you will find a Cure Poison potion, a
femur and a copper key. If you turn north at this location, you
will see a lot of wasps hovering 2 to 3 squares away. At your
leisure, cast long range mage spells such as fireballs, lightning
bolts and cones of cold. The wasps are very susceptible to these
spells and you should have no trouble killing them all.
</P>

<P>
Return to (2) and use a bone key in the keyhole to open the south
door. At (3) is a pressure plate the function of which will not be
immediately obvious. In the next room there are 4 levers (5), (6),
(7), (8). These 4 levers open the next 4 gates shown on the map.
Each lever also opens a pit at the location of one of the other 3
levers. The pressure plate at (3) that you saw earlier reset all 4
levers.
</P>

<P>
Push the levers in the following sequence: start with (5) which
also opens a pit at (8); next push (6) which also opens a pit at
(5); then push (7) which also opens a pit at (6). At this point,
trying to push the lever at (8) will result in your entire party
falling through the pit.
</P>

<P>
You will have noticed, however, that the first 3 gates through the
southern hallway are now open. Moving through this hallway, your
party will tell you about a loose brick at (9). Examine the lower
portion of the west wall panel at (9) and you will notice that the
middle brick is sticking out farther than the rest. Push this brick
back in.
</P>

<P>
Now return to the four lever room. Boldly and confidently step up
to (8) to push the final lever. Surprise. You didn't fall through
the pits this time. You have just passed the Test of Faith.
Pushing the lever at (8) opens up the last gate. You can now travel
through the hallway without restriction. There is nothing of
interest in this area.
</P>

<P>
Use a copper key at (10) to open the east door. At (11) you will
see another vision. I hope you have better luck in interpreting the
meaning of his message. I didn't understand him at all. Both doors
behind the vision can be easily opened by pushing buttons on the
door. Teleporter 2 returns you to the stairs, after doing some
major damage to some of your characters.
</P>

<P>
Teleporter 1 takes you to a short hallway where you will find stairs
labelled B going up to 4-wind Tower Level 3.
</P>

<H3>4-WIND TOWER LEVEL 3</H3>

<IMG SRC=eyeofthebeholder2/4wind3.gif ALT="Map - Wind Tower Level 3">

<P>
After coming up Stairs B from level 2, follow the hallway to Stairs
C. Take Stairs C to the main level. Turn left from the stairs to
(1). The plaque here advises using corridor II as the way through.
(2) has a plaque that says "I", (3) has a plaque that says "III" and
(4) has a plaque that says "II". If you do not listen to the advice
and push the buttons to open doors (I) and (III), you will find a
Gas Spore (they resemble the beholders but are much weaker, just
remember to use long range spells and weapons. Avoid melee whenever
possible.) behind (I) and get hit by a fireball at (5).
</P>

<P>
Push the button on the door at (4) to open it. At (6) there is a
magic mouth that tells you about other magic mouths. Be sure to
sidestep to the right or left as soon as it finishes talking. It
has a tendency to spit out fireballs at you. Push the button on the
door at (7) to open the west door. You'll find some flying snakes
to fight at (8) and get a Dark Moon key when you win.
</P>

<P>
You will see a vision at (9) that tells you to choose a door. The
door to the west is the right one. After pushing the button on the
door to open it, you will find a bone key at (10). On the other
hand, if you choose the east door, you get admonished that you made
a wrong choice, but you also get a bone key and get teleported to
(19). Thus the choice really has no effect in the game. Note that
after a choice has been made, the other room disappears.
</P>

<P>
Push the button on the door at (11) to open it. The triangular
alcove at (12) contains 5 potions of Cure Poison and a cleric scroll
of Raise Dead. There is a secret button on the east wall at (13)
which opens the passage to the east. At (14) you will find a +2
banded armor, a +3 short sword, leather boots and a -2 cursed
polearm "Leech".
</P>

<P>
On the way back, note that the door at (15) has no keyhole or
button. The door is closed at the moment. The south door at (16)
can be forced open. You will find a couple packages of rotten
ration at (17). If you don't have any in your inventory, pick one
up. At (18) is another magic mouth, as well as a skull and a femur.
This mouth does not have any important information to impart.
</P>

<P>
Use the bone key in the keyhole at (19) to open the north door.
You'll find a few more Gas Spores in this area. Push the button on
the door at (20) to open it. At (21) you will find someone who
failed at the Test of the Cloth (strangely enough, your party
doesn't appear to have to pass that test.) Leave him alone and do
not attack him. If you try to attack him, the door will close and I
never found a way out of there.
</P>

<P>
Go through the illusion wall to (22) where you will find a plaque
that talks about greed. At (23) is a triangular alcove. Any item
that you put here will be turned into a rock. Check and see if you
have 5 rocks in your inventory. If not, put some worthless items in
the alcove until you are carrying 5 rocks. They will come in handy
very shortly.
</P>

<P>
At (24) you will find some flying snakes to fight and a ring of
adornment when you win. Use the Dark Moon key in the keyhole at
(25) to open the north door. At (26) you will find a potion of
extra healing, a composite bow, 5 arrows and a parchment showing a
bunch of illusion walls on a level that you have not seen yet.
Since you are using the maps and this walkthru, you don't really
need the parchment, but carry it around for the time being anyway.
</P>

<P>
Go to location (27) and check out the north wall carefully. The
middle brick at the bottom of the north wall panel is loose. Pull
it out. This deactivates the teleport T1 4 spaces west. If you do
not deactivate this teleport, it will keep moving you back
(invisibly) to (27), the net effect is that the corridor would
appear endless. Beware of the spinner shown on the map when you are
on your way to location (28). Push the button on the door at (28)
to open it. There is a potion of vitality in the alcove at (29).
</P>

<P>
At (30) push the button on the door to open it. You will find a few
flying snakes to fight behind that door. Don't forget to pick up
the Dark Moon key at (31) after you beat up on the snakes. Push the
button on the door at (32) to open it. Pick up the mage scroll of
Disintegrate at (33).
</P>

<P>
Use the Dark Moon key in the keyhole at (34) to open the west door.
At (35) feed a rotten ration to the mouth. At (36) put 5 rocks in
the mouth. Give the mantis idol to the mouth at (37). You don't
have what the mouth at (38) wants yet, so we will skip that for the
moment.
</P>

<P>
At (39) there is a closed mouth. The purpose of this mouth will
become obvious only if you need to make a return trip to this level
for some reason. Give the cursed sword "Hunger" to the mouth at
(40). The mouth at (41) takes a potion while the one at (42) will
take either a scroll or a parchment. (The map you picked up earlier
would be a good choice.)
</P>

<P>
Use the map and retrace your step all the way west to location (15).
This is the door that you noticed earlier without a keyhole or a
button. When you get there this time, you will notice that the door
is open. Feeding the mantis idol to the mouth at (37) opened it.
Behind the door you will find a red gem at (43).
</P>

<P>
Return to the corridor of mouths and feed the red gem to the mouth
at (38). Once that's done the door at the west end of the corridor
will open. But before entering the door, stop by location (44).
Swing your weapon at the west wall. This opens up the secret
passage on both side. You will find another mage scroll of
Disintegrate at (45).
</P>

<P>
Enter the door at the west end of the corridor of the mouths. You
will meet DRAN for the first time at (46). The door closes on you.
The only way you can go is to take the stairs labelled D up to the
next level, 4-wind Tower Level 4.
</P>

<H3>4-WIND TOWER LEVEL 4</H3>

<IMG SRC=eyeofthebeholder2/4wind4.gif ALT="Map - Wind Tower Level 4">

<P>
After climbing the stairs labelled D, following the short hallway to
stairs E. At (1) is a plaque that tells you about gathering 4 keys
for the upcoming door. Continue to the east you will find teleport
T. This teleport connects with 5 other teleports, 4 that lead to a
Dark Moon key each, and 1 that leads to a door with 4 keyholes.
Each time you step into any one of these 6 teleports, you will be
randomly teleported to any one of the 6 destinations. You must use
the teleports until you have gathered all 4 Dark Moon keys from
Locations (2), (3), (4) and (5).
</P>

<P>
After you have gathered 4 Dark Moon keys, enter the teleports until
you wind up in the room with the 4 keyholes. You are now on the
main level of level 4. Use all 4 keys in the keyholes at (6), (7),
(8) and (9). This opens the door to the east. You should save the
game at this point.
</P>

<P>
A word of warning is in order here. This level contains the
toughest enemies you have yet to meet in the game. The Will O'
Wisps have lots of hit points, are very hard to hit and their blows
pack a wallop when they connect. The beholders are even tougher.
Their Death and Disintegrate spells can wipe out your entire party
in just a couple of rounds. Fortunately, they do not regenerate.
Be sure to save your game each time you win a battle.
</P>

<P>
Never go toe to toe with the beholders. Even when you don't have
room to sidestep, back up after swinging your weapon(s). Keep some
distance from the beholder so that you have time to out run its
spells. Continue to back up until you reach a corner, then turn and
wait in ambush. Repeat this tactic as often as possible. I did not
find any spells especially useful on the beholders. The old
standbys such as Fireball, Magic Missile, Cone of Cold, etc did not
faze them at all. Neither did the cleric spell of Slay Living. You
are probably better off casting the mage spell of Haste and then
just hacking and slashing your way through.
</P>

<P>
At (10) the north door can be opened by pushing the button on it.
You will find the first beholder just behind the door at (11). Use
the tactic I outlined above, but lure it towards the west. If you
get stuck, you can step into the teleport and get some temporary
relief. Just be prepared when you return. The beholder will be
waiting for you. Defeating this beholder will yield a femur, but
you don't need any more of that. Leave it there if your inventory
is getting full. At (12) is another femur.
</P>

<P>
When you step on (13), the door to the south will open
automatically, and you will have to fight another beholder. Again,
lure it towards the west. After defeating this beholder, check out
the south wall panel at (14). The middle brick can be moved. Doing
so will open up the southern passage. There are 3 potions of
healing at (15). Go through the illusion wall and find a regular
dagger and a femur at (16).
</P>

<P>
There is one more beholder hiding at (17). You don't _have to_
fight this one, but that's the reason why you didn't want to lure
the first two in this direction. You would wind up having 2
beholders to contend with at the same time.
</P>

<P>
A plaque at (18) indicates that this is a safe place to rest to
recover hit points and spells. Beware of locations (19) and (20).
There are pressure plates at these locations that trigger fireballs.
You will find a Will O' Wisp near this area which will try to lure
you to step on the plates. Just avoid it.
</P>

<P>
Check out the west wall at (21). There is a button at the bottom
corner of the right edge of the wall panel. Push it to reveal the
western passage. At (22) is another plaque indicating that this is
another safe alcove. Use the map to navigate through all the
illusion walls until you arrive at location (23). Here you
encounter a beholder stuck in a hole in the ceiling. It does not
matter what option you choose here. The result is the same. Save
the game here first.
</P>

<P>
Push the button on the south wall to get lifted to the beholder
sublevel. You will find the previously stuck beholder waiting for
you at (25). Fight-and-sidestep should easily take care of it.
(Don't worry about stepping over the pit. This is one pit you won't
fall into.) At (26) there are a +2 halberd, a +3 shield and a +2
green crystal hammer. At (27) you will find a potion of healing,
leather boots, 2 daggers and a staff. At (28) there are a -2 cursed
bracer of protection and 2 femurs.
</P>

<P>
The green crystal hammer is the only item you must get on this
sublevel. You may descend to the main level at this point. But if
you wish to explore the rest of the level for more battles and more
experience points, push the button on the east door at (29) to open
it. You'll find 2 more beholders wandering around behind the door.
At (30) there are 1 iron ration, 1 rotten food and 1 femur; at (31)
a mace and a mage scroll of Fireball; a +4 dragon armor and a +2
short sword at (32). When you step on (33), you will be turned to
the north where there is one last beholder waiting for you.
Sidestep to the left quickly and then deal with it using the
familiar tactic of retreat and ambush. There are a skull, a femur
and a wand of Dispel Magic at (34).
</P>

<P>
Return to the beholder main level by pushing the button at (35).
This will take you back to location (24). Retrace your steps
through the illusion walls. At (36) you will received another
vision of Khelben. At (37) there is a plaque informing you about
the Test of Vision.
</P>

<P>
A word about the rest of this level that you are about the explore:
There are 4 pressure plates in this region. Stepping on these
plates causes the dungeon layout to shift and change. As far as I
can determine, stepping on these plates do not open up new areas or
allow new items to be discovered. They merely serve to slightly
alter the geography, enough to cause great confusion during
navigation. The map 4WIND4.IFF is correct provided that you do not
step on any of these plates, which are marked on the map to alert
you.
</P>

<P>
Also pay special attention to the three hidden teleports T1 through
T3 and the spinner. The teleports will move you to the new
locations without you noticing, while the spinner will quietly turn
you in the opposite direction. As it turns out, the area west of
location (37) does not contain anything of interest, although there
are a few Will O' Wisps that would add to the experience points.
</P>

<P>
At location (38) you should find a chain mail, a ring of sustenance
and a ration. Look for a button at the lower right corner of the
east wall panel at (39). Push it to open the passage east. Someone
discovers that you are not of the temple at (40) and you will see
two beholders in the room just to the east. Save your game here.
</P>

<P>
Here you have no choice but to face 2 beholders at the same time.
As soon as you take one step east from (40), the 2 beholders will
come after you. At the same time, the secret passage that you
opened moments ago will be closed _permanently_. If you plan to
fight them both, you should at least cast the Cleric spells of Bless
and Prayer as well as the mage spell of Haste ahead of time. The
key is to kill the first beholder very quickly. If you succeed in
doing that without taking a lot of damage to your party, be sure to
save the game. You should have little problem finishing off the
second beholder using the retreat and ambush tactics.
</P>

<P>
On the other hand, it is possible to run away from both beholders
without a fight. Take a step east from (40) and then immediately
retreat. Lure the beholders down either the north or south hallway
west of location (40). Do not move too far ahead of the beholders.
(If you do, the second beholder will take the other hallway and try
to sneak up on you from behind!) Once you lead them to the middle of
one of the hallways, turn around and move as quickly as you can
through the other hallway, go east past (40) and wind up at (41).
Here you will find a pedestal with a hand carving on it. Choose the
option of putting your hand on the carving.
</P>

<P>
What luck! Not only did you escape from the 4-wind Tower Level 4,
(you are now back on the Temple of Darkmoon Ground Level
GROUND0.IFF, just east of location (3)), but you have also obtained
a Mark of the Moon on your hand.
</P>

<H3>TEMPLE OF DARKMOON GROUND LEVEL</H3>

<P>
You are now just to the east of location (3). Climb the stairs
labelled D to go to the Cleric Barracks Level (BARRACK).
</P>

<H3>CLERIC BARRACKS LEVEL</H3>

<IMG SRC=eyeofthebeholder2/barrack.gif ALT="Map - Cleric Barracks">

<P>
From the stairs D, make your way to location (24). There is a mouth
here that will allow you to enter the door to the east only if you
bear the mark of the moon. Now that you have touched the hand
pedestal and gotten the mark, the door simply disappears.
</P>

<P>
At (25) is a green shield block further progress to the east. The
only thing that will break it is the green crystal hammer. Wield it
like a weapon and swing it at the shield. The area to the east
changes its layout slightly as you explore it. The shaded tiles on
the map represent walls that shift in and out of existence. There
is really nothing of interest in this area. The only important
feature is the set of stairs labelled A which leads to level 1 of
another tower.
</P>

<P>
For those who are thorough, there is a group of 4 clerics waiting
for you at (26). You will find a plate mail after the battle. At
(27) there is a niche. Put an item in it to open the secret passage
west. Going through this passage to location (28), you will find a
secret button on the west wall. Push the button to reveal more of
the passage. (Note: the only time you find the secret button is
when you go west from location (27).)
</P>

<P>
Take the stairs A to the Mark of the Moon Tower Level 1.
</P>

<H3>MOONMARK TOWER LEVEL 1</H3>

<IMG SRC=eyeofthebeholder2/mark1.gif ALT="Map - Moonmark Tower Level 1">

<P>
This level is very small and uninhabited. From Stairs A, follow the
corridor all the way to the west. Go through the illusion wall and
enter teleporter T1. At (1) push the button on the door to open it.
Pick up the polished shield and a mage scroll of Hold Monster at
(2). Push the button on the door at (3) to open it. Enter
teleporter T2. That all there is to do on this level. Use Stairs B
to go up to level 2.
</P>

<H3>MOONMARK TOWER LEVEL 2</H3>

<IMG SRC=eyeofthebeholder2/mark2.gif ALT="Map - Moonmark Tower Level 2">

<P>
The plaque at (1) near Stairs B provides the clue as to how to open
up the rest of the level. Stand in front of either one of the
carvings at (2) and cast the cleric spell of Dispel Magic at the
carving. The wall in the middle disappears. Cast the spell again
at the carving and the northern passage opens. Cast the spell a
third time to reveal the western passage slightly to the north. The
door at (3) can be opened by pushing the button on the door.
</P>

<P>
The character Alain at (4) has a short but interesting story to
tell. More importantly, he awards enough experience points to raise
the character of your choice by 1 level. To get his award, allow
the character that you choose to be touched by Alain when the option
appears.
</P>

<P>
Note that this is a one time only event. In order to achieve
maximum benefit, you should take a look at the statistics of the
character you want to advance. If the character is only lacking a
small amount of experience points to advance to the next level, you
should hold off visiting Alain until your character has advanced.
Returning to Alain then would then gain your character an extra
level instantly.
</P>

<P>
Push the button on the door at (5) to open it. Go east and watch
out for the 2 clusters of moving pits. It is not difficult to get
past them. Grab the soul gem at (6). Retrace your steps past the
pits and open the door at (7) by pushing the button on it. The
plaque at (8) is pretty clear about what needs to be done here. Put
the soul gem in the ornament at (9).
</P>

<P>
Go through the illusion wall a little bit to the west and pick up
the body gem at (10). Enter the teleporter T3 which allows you to
pick up the heart gem at (12). Enter the teleporter T2 and then
return to (9) and place the body and heart gems in the ornament.
This opens the door at (13).
</P>

<P>
At (14) you will find a row of 6 pits blocking your way west. Push
the button on the wall at (14) and wait there. Soon the pit P1 will
be filled. Move across it quickly. You will be greeted by a
bulette here, which should not be difficult to defeat.
</P>

<P>
The pressure plate at (15) is responsible for filling the pit P1
when it is weighed down. Put a rock or a bone on the plate to keep
P1 filled. What happened was that a bulette was generated when you
pushed the button at (14). When it randomly stepped on the plate at
(15), the pit P1 was filled in allowing you to cross safely.
</P>

<P>
Push the button on the door at (16) to open it. The corridor leads
to 2 separate hallways going south. You will notice that there are
pressure plates along both hallways. These plates trigger fireballs
which can be avoided but only if you take the proper route.
</P>

<P>
Take the western hallway. Stand on the tile just north of the first
pressure plate. Turn around so that you are facing north. Move
backwards 6 spaces. (A fireball will fire at you when you take the
first step. You will see it coming from the north. As long as you
stay in front of it, it cannot hit you.) Then, immediately and
without turning, move to the east (right) 2 spaces and then north
(forward) 1 space. Wait here a few seconds to make sure that all
the fireballs you triggered have disappeared.
</P>

<P>
Move south (backwards) 1 space, west (left) 2 spaces and then north
(forward) 2 spaces. You are now at location (17) on the map. There
is a lever here on the west wall. Push this lever. You should rest
and save the game here.
</P>

<P>
Push the lever at (18). This combination of levers opens the door
to the south. Quickly go south and enter the door. You will find a
bulette in this room. There is also a pressure plate here as shown
on the map. The bulette may randomly step on this plate. If you it
gets to the plate before you, you will get hit by a fireball
triggered from the south. This one is unavoidable, but it is
subject to the random movement of the bulette. Defeat the bulette
and pick up a shell key and a mage scroll of Improved Invisibility.
</P>

<P>
Return to (19) and face east. The pressure plate in front of you
triggers a fireball from the east as well as opens a bit just south
of (19). Avoiding the fireball is relatively easy. Go east
(forward) 2 spaces and north (left) 1 space. Wait a second or two
and then go to location (22). Pick up the very important crimson
key just lying on the ground.
</P>

<P>
There are many more pressure plates at the north eastern part of
this maze. But all of them are either duds or they trigger
fireballs that go off in other directions rather than aimed right at
you. It is actually rather safe, except for a bulette or two to
explore this portion of the maze. Be sure to pick up the polished
shield at (23).
</P>

<P>
Use the shell key in the keyhole at (24) to open the door. Click on
the mouth at (25) to learn of its challenge. Rest here to recover
all hit points and spells. Check everyone's inventory carefully and
drop any extra spellbooks and cleric holy symbols at location (26).
Cast the cleric spells of Create Food, Bless and Prayer and the mage
spell of Haste if you have them. You should save the game here.
</P>

<P>
Right click the mage's spellbook and select the level of spells you
may want to use during the challenge. I found the level 5 Cone Of
Cold spell very effective. Once you have the spellbook menu at the
right page, drop the book as well as any equipped holy symbol at
location (26). (Notice that the spell menu stays on the screen even
without the spellbook! It will disappear as soon as you CAMP,
however.)
</P>

<P>
Enter the teleporter T5. As soon as you are teleported, you will
face a group of 3 or 4 bulettes at(27). You need to kill the first
two as quickly as possible with magic to avoid getting surrounded on
two sides. This is where the Cone Of Cold really comes in handy.
Use the fight-sidestep tactic to deal with the last one to avoid
taking any unnecessary damage.
</P>

<P>
Go through the illusion wall to the north, read the plaque at (28)
and enter the teleporter T6. Read the plaque at (29). The
transparent wall blocking your way to the west can be destroyed by
repeat hacking and slashing. The catch is that each time you hit
the wall, your entire party will also take damage. Rest as often
and as long as needed to recover hit points. (Characters will still
recover hit points even without curing spells from clerics, but at a
very slow rate.) The wall takes a random number of hits to destroy.
Be sure to rest again after destroying the wall to return everyone
to full strength. You should also save the game here.
</P>

<P>
Step into the teleporter T7. As soon as you arrive at the
destination, you will be greeted by one final battle. This final
monster is not even described in the Bestiary. It looks a little
bit like the Mind Flayer and is not that difficult to defeat. Be
sure to pick up the Eye of Talon at (30). Go through the illusion
wall to the north and step into the teleporter T8 which returns you
to a secret room just east of the row of pits before the fireball
maze on the main level.
</P>

<P>
The plaque at (31) acknowledges the fact that you have beaten the
challenge. Pick up the polished shield at (32) and all the
spellbooks and holy symbols that you previously left behind at (33).
Go through the illusion wall to the west then travel south east.
There is a plaque at (34) that informs you that this is the SENTRY
area. You will have to fight a bulette around this area and receive
a crystal key after the battle. Use the crystal key in the keyhole
at (35) to open the door to the north.
</P>

<P>
Locations (36), (37) and (38) are three levers. On the south wall
at (39) is a button. Every time you move the levers to a different
combination and then push the button at (39), the layout of the area
to the south east changes! The objective here is to get to the
object protected by transparent walls. Go right ahead if you wish
to experiment.
</P>

<P>
The combination that will work is: (36) down; (37) down; (38) up.
Push the button at (39). The layout of the area will now match
_exactly_ with that shown on the map. The object of interest is at
location (41). It is an amulet of life. Get it and then leave.
The door at (40) can be open/closed by a button on the north floor.
There is a pressure plate behind the door and apparently bulettes
are continuously being generated right in the area also. But other
than that, I did not notice any other effect from the pressure
plate.
</P>

<P>
Retrace your steps and return to the SENTRY area. There are 6
pressure plates here and a wall that moves sideways (east/west) when
you step on the plates. You will find that no matter which plate
you start on, the wall will always be right in front of you blocking
you way south when you get to the front row.
</P>

<P>
Stand on the plate at (42) and throw either rocks or bones at the
plate at (43) until the wall moves completely to the west side.
Moving south now from location (42) will get you past the wall. At
location (44) there is a smooth hole on the west wall. Put your Eye
of Talon in the hole _and_ then remove it. The door to the south
will open. (Be sure to put the Eye back in your inventory. You
will need it again later.)
</P>

<P>
There is a pressure plate at (45). Stepping on this plate summons
three bulettes and at the same time, closes the door you just came
through. As long as you take care not to get surrounded by the
bulettes, the fight should not be too big a problem for your party.
The button on the east wall at location (46) reopens the door behind
(44). Take the stairs labelled D up to Level 3.
</P>

<H3>MOONMARK TOWER LEVEL 3A</H3>

<IMG SRC=eyeofthebeholder2/mark3a.gif ALT="Map - Moonmark Tower Level 3A">

<P>
Follow the hallway from Stairs D and go through the illusion wall to
the room to the west. The plaques at (1) and (5) indicate where the
doors lead to. Push the button at (2) to open the door to the
south. (I never did quite figure out the functions of the three
pressure plates.) Enter the open door and then the teleporter T1.
</P>

<P>
The door at (3) has a button. Push it to open the door. Pick up
the shell key on the floor at (4). Enter the teleporter T2 which
will bring you back to (2) again. Push the button at (2). This
time the door to the north will open. (As far as I can tell, the
north door only opens after you have been through teleporters T1 and
T2.)
</P>

<P>
Beware of the pits along the E/W corridor. They are not difficult
to avoid when you discover that the second tile from the west is
always solid. Enter the teleporter T3.
</P>

<P>
When you arrive at the destination, you will immediately notice the
guards to the north. They will not attack unless you attack first.
To the east is teleporter T4 that will bring you back to (2) again.
Use it only in an emergency. Rest here to recover all hit points
and spells. Cast the mage spell of Haste. Save the game.
</P>

<P>
When you approach the guards, you will be warned. In order to go
any further on this level, you have no choice but to attack them.
And as soon as you do that, the doors to the east and west will
open, and more guards will appear. The best place for you to be is
just to the west of T4. Here you don't have to worry about getting
surrounded by the guards.
</P>

<P>
I found that the mage spells of Fireball and Magic Missile worked
well on the guards while Cone Of Cold and Lightning Bolt did not.
After destroying the guards, be sure to check the floor for a
crystal key dropped by one of them. Enter the door to the east and
pick up a polished shield.
</P>

<P>
There is keyhole at (8) that will take the shell key to open the
north door, but there is no need to use a shell key here, since
there is another way to get behind that door. Go through the door
to the west and go through the northern illusionary wall. There are
a few more guards to kill in this room. Push the button at (9) to
open the door.
</P>

<P>
There is a mouth on the south wall at (10) that will try to summon
more guards as you walk by, but most likely none will appear since
you should have wiped out most of them by now. At (11) there is a
large pentagram on the floor. When you step on it, you get zapped
by a jolt of lightning or electricity and at the same time the door
to the east opens. I never found away to avoid getting hit when I
stepped on the pentagram.
</P>

<P>
The pressure plate at (12) closes the west door when you step on it.
And when you step off the pressure plate, the north door opens. You
will also find another pressure plate in the middle of this 5X5 room
weighed down by a pair of +1 Brahma boots and a mage scroll of Ice
Storm. It's ok to take one of the items. But if you try to take
both off of the pressure plate, walls will appear in the four shaded
areas and unavoidable fireballs will shoot at you from at least 2
different directions. It's best to leave one item on the plate.
Neither one is crucial in the game.
</P>

<P>
Enter the room behind the north door. At (14) one of your
characters will tell you that the room has a secret button. Examine
the west wall at (15). The middle lower brick is different from the
others. Pushing this brick will reveal the secret passage to the
east. There is a plaque with a somewhat cryptic message at (16).
</P>

<P>
Rest in front of the door at (17) to recover all hit points and
spells. You may want to save the game here also. Push the button
on the door to open it. At (18) there is a pressure plate on the
floor and a button on the west wall. When the pressure plate is
stepped on, it triggers fireballs from the south wall outside the
door. The button on the west wall closes the door.
</P>

<P>
When you enter the door and steps on the plate at (18) the first
time, you should be prepared and push the button on the wall to
close the door to block off the fireballs. At (20) is another plate
that also triggers the fireballs from outside the door. This area
is full of guards. (About a dozen of them!) I found that the best
tactic to use is to lure them into this hallway, then push the
button at (18) to open the door and quickly back up to (19). In
order to get to you, the guards have to step on the pressure plate.
Thus your attacks are aided by a unlimited source of fireballs.
</P>

<P>
When you do not see any more guards approaching in the hallway, step
up to (18) and push the button to close the door. Venture north to
(20) and peek into the rooms to the east and then west. If you find
more guards in there, again lure them to (18) and repeat the process
until you clean them all out.
</P>

<P>
At (21) there is another polished shield to be picked up. There is
a lever at (22). Pushing this lever will open up the secret
passages at (23) and (24). It will also reveal close to another
bunch of guards that can have you surrounded in a very short time if
you try to fight them in this area. Again, best strategy is to
return to (18) and (19) and use the fireballs to your advantage.
</P>

<P>
When this final batch of guards have been taken care of, return to
location (23). You will notice that the east wall is transparent.
Swing your weapon at the transparent wall. A few hacks should be
enough to break it down. At (25) is the Starfire wand. The
transparent wall at the other end (24) can be similarly destroyed.
There is a familiar looking hole on the south wall at (26). Put the
Starfire in the hole and then remove it. This opens the door to the
east.
</P>

<P>
Follow the winding hallway south. Go through the illusionary wall
to the west. Here you will find another polished shield, a +2
Jhona's cloak and a parchment map at (27). At (28) you will see a
rather suspicious vision of Khelben telling you that in order to
succeed in your mission, you must let the guards in the next room
kill you. Your suspicion will be confirmed if you pick up the
amulet of resurrection he left for you, for this turns out to be a
cursed item.
</P>

<P>
Push the button on the east wall at (28) to open the door. There is
a pressure plate at (29) that closes the door. A button on the west
wall at (29) opens the door at the NE corner. There are several
guards to fight after you open that door. One of them will leave a
tooth key. At (30) there is a +1 sling. Use the tooth key in the
creature skull at (31) to open the secret passage north. You will
also see a vision of Dran here.
</P>

<P>
Pick up the rock at (32). There are 5 pressure plates in the center
of the next room. The plates at (35) and (36) cause a teleporter to
appear either at location (33) or (34). There are also pressure
plates at locations (37) through (42) which are separated from the
main room by transparent walls.
</P>

<P>
The idea here is to weigh down the six plates (37) through (42) with
various objects. When you do that, the door at the NW corner will
open, allowing further access. First step on the plate at (35) to
move the teleporter at (33). Next, step on the first (north) plate
in the center column and then walk to just south of the pit in front
of the teleporter at (33). Throw an item at the teleporter. Now if
you turn east and look beyond the transparent wall, you will find
that the item you just threw landed on the pressure plate at (37).
</P>

<P>
Repeat the procedure by stepping on the second and third plates in
the center column and throwing other objects at the teleporter.
These objects should land on the plates at (38) and (39).
</P>

<P>
Now move the teleporter to location (34) by stepping on the plate at
(36). Use the same procedure to put items on the plates at (40),
(41) and (42). Once all 6 plates are loaded, the door at the NW
corner will open. At the same time, the glass walls leading to (38)
and (41) will also disappear, allowing you to step in and retrieve
all the items from all 6 pressure plates.
</P>

<P>
Enter the door and then follow the hallway and take the stairs
labelled E to Level 3B.
</P>

<H3>MOONMARK TOWER LEVEL 3B</H3>

<IMG SRC=eyeofthebeholder2/mark3b.gif ALT="Map - Moonmark Tower Level 3B">

<P>
The stairs labelled E leads to a hallway, and then a room, and then
another set of stairs labelled F.
</P>

<P>
Stairs F leads to a room of moving pits. It is not difficult to get
to the stairs G on the other side of the room. Just follow the
route shown on the map.
</P>

<P>
Stairs G leads to another room of moving pits. The route to get
across this room a bit trickier because it requires several
direction changes. I strong recommend that you turn and move
forward so that you can always look at the tile in front of you
before you step on it. There should be enough time to do that and
still avoid falling into a pit. Again, follow the route shown on
the map. This will lead you to the stairs labelled H.
</P>

<P>
The stairs H leads you into a room with a teleporter T5 in the
center. Be sure to check out the niche in the west wall at (1) and
pick up a ring of feather fall as well as a crystal key. Step into
the teleporter T5 to return to Level 3A.
</P>

<H3>MOONMARK TOWER LEVEL 3A</H3>

<P>
The teleporter T5 on level 3B takes you back to the doors that lead
to either a shortcut or the guards and wards areas. Go through the
illusionary wall to the east. At (43) use the shell key in the
keyhole. At (44) use the crystal key. Using these two keys cause
the glass wall to disappear. You are now able to go up the stairs
labelled I to Level 4. Be sure to save the game here first. You
will have a pretty tough battle as soon as you get to level 4!
</P>

<H3>MOONMARK TOWER LEVEL 4</H3>

<IMG SRC=eyeofthebeholder2/mark4.gif ALT="Map - Moonmark Tower Level 4">

<P>
As soon as you reach level 4 via the stairs labelled I, you will
have to fight a couple of Aerial Servants. They hit hard and they
have lots of hit points themselves. Step into the teleporter T1
which will take you to the main level.
</P>

<P>
You will have to defeat more Aerial Servants after being teleported.
T2 is another teleporter that will take you back to the area near
Stairs I. There's not much reason to go back there unless you are
desperately in need of a place to rest.
</P>

<P>
Push the button on the door at (2) to open it. The carving at (3)
tells you that you are about the enter the medusa labyrinth. It
also tells you the importance of the 6 polished shields, all of
which you should have found by now if you follow this walkthru.
Tell the carving that you are prepared to enter and it will open the
door to the east for you.
</P>

<P>
Put a polished shield at each of the locations (4) through (9).
Doing so will open the door at the NW corner. Before entering this
door, be sure to retrieve all 6 shields and give one to each of the
6 characters. It is also a good idea to keep a saved game here.
</P>

<P>
The medusa labyrinths are inhabited by medusae and Aerial Servants.
The medusae are not too tough. They can petrify your characters but
not very often. Carrying the polished shields probably help. Once
a character is petrified, however, only the high level mage spell of
Stone To Flesh or a bag of magic dust can cure him/her. The aerial
servants are very tough. You should save the game each time you
successfully defeat these monsters.
</P>

<P>
The labyrinths make up a rather complicated maze. However, there
aren't too many locations that need to be visited. Feel free to
explore every tile and fight every monster to gain experience
points. I will only highlight the important locations.
</P>

<P>
The door at (10) can be opened by pushing the button on the door.
There is nothing interesting behind the door. The doors at (11) and
(12) both have buttons. Push them to open the doors.
</P>

<P>
There is a tooth key at (13). There are also quite a few Aerial
Servants lurking around in this neighborhood. Be very wary. The
shaded tile is a walkway sometimes, and a wall at other times.
</P>

<P>
Be alert when you traverse the north/south corridor at the western
edge of the dungeon. The spinner turns you around 180 degrees. The
hidden teleporter T3 activates only the first time you step in it.
It brings you back to near the south end of the corridor. Nothing
happens during subsequent visit to T3. All the shaded tiles in this
area can change from walkways to walls as you travel.
</P>

<P>
There is a button on the south wall at (14). Pushing it will open
both doors that lead to the east. There are quite a few medusae
behind the doors and more than likely, you will get surrounded by a
few of them. Push the button on the door at (15) to open it. Pick
up the mage scroll of Invisibility 10' Radius and the Stone Dagger
at (16). Open the door at (17) by pushing the button on it.
</P>

<P>
To understand what needs to be done in this area, go to (18) and
read the plaque on the wall. There are 4 pressure plates in this
area at locations (19) through (22). The idea is to get a medusa to
stand on each plate, then closing off the doors leading to that
plate, thus trapping the medusa. Once you have done that to all 4
pressure plates, the door at (23) opens, allowing further progress.
</P>

<P>
Lure a medusa into a plate room by getting in front of her and then
walk backwards into a plate room. When she is standing on a plate,
cast the cleric spell of Hold Person. This will freeze the medusa
motionless for a short period of time. Close the doors leading to
the plate and she will be trapped inside. One word of caution, you
must leave the plate at (22) till last or you will end up trapping
yourself. A little bit of reflection while studying the map and you
will understand what I mean.
</P>

<P>
After trapping a medusa at (19), (20) and (21), close the north and
south doors that lead to (22). Use the east and west doors to move
through as you lure the last medusa into position. Once you have
successfully trapped the 4 medusae, the door at (23) opens.
</P>

<P>
Push the button on the door at (24) to open it. At (25) are 2
femurs, 2 skulls and the Hilt of Talon. There are a skull, 2 femurs
and a mage scroll of Flesh To Stone. At (27) pushing the lower
brick on the north wall will open the east passage. Use the tooth
key at the creature skull at (28) to open the door to the south.
</P>

<P>
At (29) click on the royal banner on the east wall then pick up the
mage scroll of Cone of Cold at (30). There is a pressure plate at
(31). Before stepping on this plate to find out what happens, order
your mage(s) to memorize as many level 5 Hold Monsters spells as
they can. Then rest to recover hit points and spells. Keep a saved
game at this point.
</P>

<P>
When you step on the pressure plate at (31), you would be surrounded
on all 4 sides by transparent walls. You will see Dran who is
thrilled to spring this little trap on your party. After some
suitable amount of gloating and threats from Dran, the pressure
plate opens up into a pit and your party is dropped to the next
level, level 5.
</P>

<H3>MOONMARK TOWER LEVEL 5</H3>

<IMG SRC=eyeofthebeholder2/mark5.gif ALT="Map - Moonmark Tower Level 5">

<P>
At (1) you find a mage scroll of Cone Of Cold. This level is
inhabited by Frost Giants who are terrible monsters because when
they strike, they inflict damage on every character in the party
with one blow. The beginning of this level is also the toughest.
You have to defeat a wave of 3 giants before you can rest, and the
next wave has 4 giants.
</P>

<P>
Fireball and Magic Missile will work against the giants, but I
prefer the Hold Monster spell. This works about half of the time.
When it works, the giant will stop dead in its tracks, long enough
for your two fighters to easily hack him into oblivion if you have
the mage spell of Haste running at the same time. I like it because
your party will take absolutely no damage this way.
</P>

<P>
If you wish to use this tactic, cast Haste before you meet the
giants head on. Then cast Hold Monster as soon as you are in line
with a giant. If the spell doesn't take, simply restore the game
until the spell works. And be sure to save after each successful
battle. After playing through with two different parties, it seemed
to me that the high level the mage was, the more frequently the Hold
Monster spell would work.
</P>

<P>
If you do not have enough Hold Monster spells to take care of the
last 1 or 2 giants in the second group of 4, try the fight-backup
tactics. There may just be enough room in the narrow hallway for
you to beat them without taking damage.
</P>

<P>
There is a button on the door at (2). Push it to open the door.
(You will find giants behind each and every door on this level, so
be prepared.) There are 3 moving pits in the hallway behind this
door. The pattern is such that it is impossible to get across
directly to the west end. You will have to detour to the north
after crossing the second pit and then wait for the right moment to
finish the journey west. There is nothing of interest at the end of
that hallway. I should note also that the illusionary wall shown on
the map only allows travelling from west to east, not vice versa.
The door at (3) can also be opened by pushing the button on the
door, but there is nothing else worthy of note in that area.
</P>

<P>
The door at (4) can be opened on either side with the push of a
button. There are 5 pits in a row along the east/west hallway south
of this door. If you try to cross all 5 pits to get to the other
side, you will never make it. What you have to do here is to cross
the first 2 pits and then turn south until you reach (5). This is
quite easy to do.
</P>

<P>
At (5) you will have to defeat a couple of frost giants. If you
wish, push the button on the door at (6) to open it, and fight 2
more giants inside. This will increase your characters' experience
points, but little else. When you are done, return to (5). You
should save the game here.
</P>

<P>
From (5), it is quite possible to go across the two pits to the
north, and then 3 more to the west. The trick lies in finding the
right moment to begin your trek. Study the pattern. You will find
that there are really 2 likely opportunities when you can start
moving north. One will quickly drop you through one of the pits.
Restore and try the other one. And I recommend that you turn to the
left when you have to change direction, rather than side-stepping.
</P>

<P>
The doors at (7) and (8) can be opened by pushing the buttons on the
doors. There is nothing behind either door except frost giants.
Fight'em or leave'em. Return to (7) and then pick the right moment
to cross the two pits to the north. This should very easy to do.
There is a frost giant at (9) that you will have to defeat. Again,
push the button on the door at (9) to open it and fight more frost
giants if you wish. That's entirely up to you. Save your game
here.
</P>

<P>
Study the pattern of the pits and move to location (10) as soon as
the pit there is filled. Push the button on the door to open it.
If the frost giant behind the door is not right at the doorway, take
a step forward to get away from the potential pit. Either way,
fight the giant and enter the door as soon as you can. Push the
button on the door at (11) to open it. There are 3 more giants here
waiting for you. Open the door at (12) the same way after you
defeat the 3 giants.
</P>

<P>
Finally! At (13) you will find a mysterious giant who tells you a
story about how Dran tricked the giants a long time ago. Be sure to
pick up the Talon's Tongue that he leaves behind. At (14) is a
stone portal. Use the Stone Dagger on the portal to return to the
Cleric Barracks level.
</P>

<H3>CLERIC BARRACKS</H3>

<P>
Using the stone dagger on the portal at the frost giant level (level
5 of the Moonmark Tower) returns you to location (16) on the cleric
barracks level. Exit the door to the east and then go south and
east a couple of steps. You are now in front of the crimson keyhole
at location (29). Use the crimson key in this keyhole to open the
door to the south.
</P>

<P>
At (30) you will find the unique looking wall carving. The rather
cryptic message from the frost giant should make some sense here.
This is where you have to use all three parts of the talon. Put the
eye, the hilt and the tongue of the talon in the carving. This
opens up the western passage. Be sure to pick up the +4 talon lying
on the floor.
</P>

<P>
Take the stairs labelled E. The area this takes you to is shown at
the north east corner of the map. You will fight a couple of
clerics around location (31). One of them will leave a flail which
didn't seem to be a particularly good weapon. Pick up the mage
scroll of True Seeing at (32). Return to the main level via the
stairs labelled E.
</P>

<P>
Location (33) is pressure plate. Stepping on this plate will
trigger fireballs coming at you from the west. Retreat and duck to
the south (right) to avoid it. You will see that the plate at (33)
is now depressed. Stepping on it a second time returns it to its
normal position but does not trigger another fireball. Be careful
of the fast moving pit. Getting past it to the Stairs F should not
be much of a problem. Take the Stairs F up to the North Talon
Tower.
</P>

<H3>NORTH TALON TOWER</H3>

<P>
This is a very small single level tower. The only thing tricky
about this level is the existence of three hidden teleporters that
can be very disorienting to unsuspecting adventurers. Pay special
attention to the locations of teleporters T1, T2 and T3 and their
destinations shown on the map. Note that there is also a
destination for a teleporter T4. This teleporter is in the South
Talon Tower that we will get to a little later.
</P>

<P>
Shortly after leaving Stairs F, you will be teleported by T1. Be
prepare to fight a cleric that can hurl some strong fireballs in the
area around location (1). Be sure to pick up the crimson ring he
leaves behind. There is a triangular wall niche at (2). Anything
you place in this niche turns into a glass sphere. You will need
three of these spheres later in the game. Check your inventory and
use the niche to generate all the spheres that you think you will
need.
</P>

<P>
At (3) there is a lever that turns off the teleporter T1 and at (4)
there is a second lever that turns off T2 and T3. Push both levers
to turn off all the teleporters. (Note: be careful to avoid T2
when you move from (3) to (4).) Now you can return to the stairs
labelled F. Take the stairs back to the cleric barracks level.
</P>

<H3>CLERIC BARRACKS LEVEL</H3>

<P>
After returning via Stairs F, be careful to avoid falling into the
fast moving pit just to the east. Also, be sure to move quickly
forward and then to the right after stepping on the pressure plate
at (33).
</P>

<P>
When you stand on the pressure plate at (34), you will notice that
the hallway extends one more step further to the west. Drop an
object here to keep the plate weighed down. When you stand on the
plate at (35), the wall on the south side at the end of the hallway
disappears. Drop another object to weigh down this plate. After
fighting some clerics, take the stairs labelled G up to the South
Talon Tower, where Dran is awaiting!
</P>

<H3>SOUTH TALON TOWER LEVEL 1 THROUGH 4</H3>

<IMG SRC=eyeofthebeholder2/stalon1.gif ALT="Map - South Talon Tower Level 1-7">

<P>
After emerging from Stairs G, follow the corridor to location (1).
Click on the banner on the north wall. You will find a crimson
ring. Push the button on the door to the south to open it. Inside
the room are a series of teleporters. Note that T2 and T3 both
teleport to location (2), while T4 will send you all the way over to
the NORTH Talon Tower (NTALON&SOFTFLR).
</P>

<P>
After entering the door at (1), enter teleporter T3. You will find
yourself at location (2). There is a parchment of sticky paper
here. Pick it up and put it in inventory, but do _not_ equip it.
Enter the teleport T6 to the south. When you materialize, you will
notice that T3 has disappeared. Look at the east wall at (3).
There is a circular carving here. Place a crimson ring over the
carving. The wall will dissolve and a void open up in front of you.
Enter the void.
</P>

<P>
You are now at location (4) on level 2. The west wall has a
circular carving that will allow you to return to level 1 if you use
a crimson ring. But we have no need to return. At (5) there is a
mage scroll of Fear. There are two more crimson rings lying on the
floor at (6). Every time you try to approach them, they will move a
square further away from you. To pick them up, drop the sticky
paper on the floor next to them and you will be able to walk up to
the rings and pick them up. The rings are only useful if you wish
to make a return trip.
</P>

<P>
The plaque at (7) is just another hint at using the sticky paper on
the rings. The circular carving at (8) should be obvious by now.
Put a crimson ring over the carving to dissolve the wall. Enter the
void beyond.
</P>

<P>
You are now at location (9) on level 3. Read the plaque at (10).
Explain to me what it means if you ever figure it out. Be sure to
pick up the MAPAJ coin at (11). Go through the illusionary walls to
the west. There is a +3 plate mail at (12), a +2 robe and a SHALL
REJOICE coin at (13). Take the stairs labelled H up to level 4.
</P>

<P>
Level 4 is very difficult, if not impossible to map. The walls and
walkways shift every which way depending on your movements.
Fortunately, there is only one item that you need from this level.
And it is at location (14). Follow the route shown on the map. Be
sure to turn and then move forward each time there is a direction
change. This route is guaranteed to take you to location (14)
successfully if you use it immediately after coming up the Stairs H.
</P>

<P>
You will meet a strange character at (14). Allow this character to
TOUCH you. He will exchange the MAPAJ and the SHALL REJOICE coins
that you found earlier with another coin. Be sure to pick up the
coin from the floor. The go south 3 spaces and then west to the
stairs labelled I.
</P>

<P>
There is another character at the NE corner that has a rather
cryptic message. There is a green force field in a hallway at the
SE corner. This force field can be eliminated by the mage spell of
Disintegrate. It was told to me that Insal the thief was behind
this force field, and that he also has a coin to give. I never
found Insal behind the force field myself. And I'll leave it up to
you to decide if you wish to explore this level further. When you
are finished, take the stairs labelled I up to level 5.
</P>

<H3>SOUTH TALON TOWER LEVEL 5 THROUGH 7</H3>

<P>
Level 5 is just one long winding corridor. Beware of fireball
hurling clerics, especially around location (1). You will find a
bracer of protection after the fight. Be sure to use the
illusionary walls to get to the last section of the corridor,
avoiding teleporter T1. Take the Stairs J up to level 6.
</P>

<P>
There are two coin slots (2) and (3) on level 6 that control the two
doors leading to the rest of the level. It is only necessary to
open one of the two doors. Use the coin in the slot at (2). This
opens the door to the west.
</P>

<P>
The rest of the doors at (4) through (7) can all be opened by
pushing the buttons on the doors. There are high level clerics
behind all these doors. Do not hesitate to use mage spells on them.
And move aside when necessary to avoid their spells. At (8), the
clerics will open the east door to fight you. You will find a +1
ring of protection after the battle. Take the Stairs K up to level
7.
</P>

<P>
There are only a couple of hell hounds on this level. Get rid of
them and you may explore in peace. There is a plaque at (10).
There are three altars at locations (13), (14) and (15), each one
protected by a force field. There are a couple of notched disks on
the walls at (11) and (12). Turn one of the disks all the way
around so that the notch is at the 12 o'clock position. Make sure
that the notch on the second disk is also at the 12 o'clock
position. This shuts off the force field at (13). At the same
time, the shaded wall next to the altar disappears. Approach the
altar and place a glass sphere on it.
</P>

<P>
Next, turn both disks so that both notches are at the 3 o'clock
position. The force field guarding the altar at (14) is turned off
and the shaded wall next to the altar disappears. Put another glass
sphere on the altar.
</P>

<P>
Repeat the same procedure for the altar at (15). This time turn
both disks so that both notches are at the 6 o'clock position. Once
you place a glass sphere on this third altar, you will see the hole
in the ceiling. Go to the east side of location (16). Pull the
ring on the wall and you will be teleported to level 8.
</P>

<H3>SOUTH TALON TOWER LEVEL 8</H3>

<IMG SRC=eyeofthebeholder2/stalon2.gif ALT="Map - South Talon Tower Level 8">

<P>
You are at location (1) when you first arrive at this level. Before
doing anything else, let me describe the area layout for you.
</P>

<P>
The room to the west (locations (2) and (3)) is a generation center
of mind flayers. Mind flayers are very tough because they cast
psychic blasts that can easily paralyze most of your party in the
first few rounds. You can never completely kill off all the mind
flayers. The game generates more of them all the time. If you do
want to explore the mind flayer rooms, make them your first
destination after arriving at this level. Head west into the mind
flayer room. You will probably be attacked by a salamander or two
along the way, but they are fairly easy to beat. Once in the room,
avoid stepping on location (2). Doing so will open both doors to
the west and immediately summon numerous mind flayers. If you do
not step on (2), you will have some time to check out all the
surrounding areas before mind flayers appear. The only point of
interest is the crystal ball at (3) which shows a few scenes
depicting some events in the history of the Darkmoon Temple.
</P>

<P>
The room to the north (4) is inhabited by salamanders. They are not
difficult to defeat and are especially susceptible to Cone of Cold
spell. Again, the game will continuously generate more and more of
them, so that clearing them out completely is impossible.
</P>

<P>
The room to the south (5) is empty and makes a nice resting place
when necessary. Be aware that both the salamanders and mind flayers
have the ability to open doors to come after you if they are close
enough to sense your presence.
</P>

<P>
The door to the east has no buttons or keyholes. There are,
however, two triangular niches on either side of the door, protected
by blue force fields. Cast the cleric spell of Dispel Magic in
front of each niche. The force field will disappear and you will
find an amulet of life and an amulet of death respectively. Doing
so also opens the door.
</P>

<P>
You will find a dying cleric when you enter this door. Pick up the
stone cross that's lying on the floor. The room north of here has
nothing of interest that I can find. You should rest here to
recover your hit points. It's also a good idea to check your
inventory and make sure your 2 fighters are equipped with the best
weapons that you have. Take the Stairs L to level 9.
</P>

<H3>SOUTH TALON TOWER LEVEL 9</H3>

<IMG SRC=eyeofthebeholder2/stalon3.gif ALT="Map - South Talon Tower Level 9">

<P>
At (1) push the button on the door to open it. Once you enter this
door, it will close automatically. There is no escape now until you
have successfully killed Dran. The doors at (2), (3) and (4) can
all be opened by pushing the buttons on them. You should cast the
mage spell of Haste and then save your game before opening the door
at (4).
</P>

<P>
You will confront Dran Draggore for a final time at (5). From this
point on, it's a fight to the death. I never found a spell that's
effective against Dran and trying to cast spells while doing the
"fight and dance" routine only served to mess up my timing.
Eventually, I simply resorted to pure hack n' slash.
</P>

<P>
The best way to battle Dran is to lure him south to one of the 2X3
areas. Swing at him once and then step aside. When he moves in
front of you, have the other fighter take a swing and then step
aside again. If he moves to your flank instead of in front of you,
you must quickly move forward and then turn around to track him.
With some practice, this dance routine is not difficult to perfect.
But you almost must use the keyboard for movement and the mouse to
swing the weapons in order to get the timing right. Every so often,
Dran will actually move _away_ from you. If your party is in good
shape, use this opportunity to save the game to record your
progress.
</P>

<P>
Don't be too quick to congratulate yourself when Dran goes down the
first time. Remember his namesake. The fight is only half over and
your trouble is just beginning. The second half of the fight
requires even quicker and better timing on your part but the
logistics are the same. Good luck. The people at Waterdeep awaits
report of your victory.
</P>
