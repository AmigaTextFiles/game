<H2>SOLVE</H2>

<H3>THE ENTRANCE</H3>

<P>
Operate the cupboard. Examine the book. Examine the notepad on the
desk. Operate the computer.
</P>

<H3>UNDERGROUND</H3>

<P>
Send Nodd back into the lift. Use the quadrocorder on the alien
door. Operate the quadrocorder. You now have two atmosphere
readings. To open the door you need to match the atmosphere to the
other side by operating the gas tanks.
</P>

<P>
QUICK SOLUTION: Operate the chlorine tank 5 times then the oxygen
tank 6 times. Operate the alien symbols.
</P>

<H3>MASTER CONTROL</H3>

<P>
At this point Yeno has to take one path and Nodd the other. One
path leads to the bridge, the other to the windmill.
</P>

<H3>THE BRIDGE</H3>

<P>
Operate the red button. Save first, because you can't save during
the puzzle. This puzzle is really evil. This is how it works:
Each square on the grid has a corresponding panel. Operating the
panel brings up a logical puzzle. If you get it right that square
will be activated. I won't give the solutions here as there are
only six possibilities in each case, so if you can't work it out
just guess.
</P>

<P>
When activated, a green square lights up the square in the direction
of the arrow. A red square will light up itself, but only if the
square that the arrow is pointing to is already lit. Each square
can only be activated once. If you reach a dead end, press the red
button again.
</P>

<P>
If you get through this first time, apply to join Mensa. When a
complete path is lit up, you can cross the bridge and enter the next
room (Teleport I)
</P>

<H3>THE WINDMILL</H3>

<P>
NODD'S SOLUTION: Operate the alien toolbox. Use the screwdriver on
the radio. Operate the panel. Take the regulator. Use the
amplifier on the slot. Operate the dial.
</P>

<P>
YENO'S SOLUTION: Operate the alien toolbox Operate the wheel. Use
the hydrospanner on the pipe section. Use the pipe section on the
exit.
</P>

<P>
BOTH CHARACTERS: Go through to the next room (The Alien).
</P>

<H3>THE ALIEN</H3>

<P>
Save now. As the warning says, you can die here. Taking a step
forward will activate the next sequence. When the alien appears,
shoot it, unless you want to die horribly. Examine the ceiling.
Shoot the ceiling. Go through to the next room (Teleport II). If
you didn't shoot the ceiling first, it's game over, man.
</P>

<H3>TELEPORT I/II</H3>

<P>
You should have one character in each of the teleport rooms. For
the purpose of this puzzle, it doesn't matter which character is in
which room.
</P>

<P>
IN TELEPORT I (following the bridge): Examine the notebook. You
will find a yellow card. Use the card on the platform. Operate the
controls until you see the other character. Operate the cupboard.
Take the bar. Use the bar on the panel. Take the cables.
</P>

<P>
IN TELEPORT II (following the alien): Take the box nearest the
door. Use the box on the scanner. Operate the scanner. Take the
sunglasses. Take the box back to the previous room, operate the
unit, and use the box on the unit. Return to Teleport II. Examine
the open box. You will find a blue card. Use the card on the
platform. Operate the controls until you see the other character.
Switch back to Teleport I.
</P>

<P>
BACK IN TELEPORT I: Operate the switch. Take the blue card. Use
the blue card on the card reader. Switch back to Teleport II.
</P>

<P>
BACK IN TELEPORT II: Take the yellow card. Use the yellow card on
the card reader. Go through to the next room (Corridor I). Switch
to the other character.
</P>

<P>
The next puzzle is different for each character.
</P>

<P>
YENO'S SOLUTION: Take the flask. Use the flask on the orange fluid
twice. Use the flask on the green fluid. Use the flask on the
yellow fluid. Operate the unit. Use the cable on both sockets.
Use the flask on the unit. Use the formula on the cupboard. Take
the door. Go into the next room (Water).
</P>

<P>
NODD'S SOLUTION: Use the cable on the socket, then on the door. Go
through to the next room (Water).
</P>

<H3>CORRIDOR I</H3>

<P>
No puzzle here, just go on to Statues.
</P>

<H3>WATER</H3>

<P>
YENO'S SOLUTION: Use the door on the water. Use the panel on the
water.
</P>

<P>
NODD'S SOLUTION: Use the cable on the water, then on the other
cable (by the door). The door here won't open until the other
character reaches Corridor II.
</P>

<H3>STATUES</H3>

<P>
Nodd should examine the strange symbols. Yeno should use the
quadrocorder on them. Walk over to the trapdoor. When the eye
appears, quickly operate the sunglasses. Fail, and you die. Go
through the door. The character will leave the sunglasses behind.
</P>

<H3>CORRIDOR II</H3>

<P>
Operate the switch. This opens the door in the Water room so that
the other character can get into the Statues room. When both
characters are through, make one stand on the pad on the floor, and
the other walk through the doorway.
</P>

<P>
Now watch the ending sequence.
