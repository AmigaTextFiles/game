<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Rescue Elvira from the ghastly Cerberus, the 60-foot tall,
three-headed demon who has found its way into our dimension and now
holds her captive somewhere in the depths of a huge film studio. The
game features more locales to explore, including three frighteningly
authentic movie studios, and more gruesome and vividly graphic
creatures to combat both physically and magically. Gameplay is
enhanced with realistic and spooky animated graphics, a haunting
original soundtrack, and a transparent interface that, working
together, completely embroil the player in an experience synonymous
with a first class horror movie.
</P>

<H2>SOLVE</H2>

<P>
Your initial mission was to rescue Elvira from the 3 studio. Each
studio will have a Elvira hidden somewhere. The first two Elvira
you find will always attack you. The real one will follow you.
After finding each Elvira, you will get a certain item which is
crucial at the end game. After that, you'll need to get the 3 items
enchanted by the Indian janitor at the basement. But first you need
to get his pipe first. Next, you need to find a holy man to draw a
pentagram. Then you'll need to summon the Cerberus and use the
sacred items to destroy it.
</P>

<P>
OUTSIDE STUDIO: Pick up the rock by the road side. Throw it at the
door to break the window. Enter the guard room. Open the closet
and get the security key from the dead body. Click on the keyboard,
drag the security key to the key hole. Enter security code to open
the main gate.
</P>

<P>
CAR PARK: Open the back of Elvira's car. Open the tool box and get
the tools. The wirecutter is inside.
</P>

<P>
LEVEL 1: There is a lift here where you can access the basement and
level 2. The 3 studio can be access from this level.
</P>

<P>
BASEMENT: There is an Indian janitor here. Talk to him for some
information. Don't mention the fire water until later on. The room
behind him is cold, and there is a spirit guarding the copper rod.
Cast a fireball to warm up the room before attempting to take the
copper rod.
</P>

<P>
LEVEL 2: There are many rooms here. Explore the place and try to
find the radio and the diskette.
</P>

<P>
There is a witch inside the custom room, kill it to get its eye.
Wear Sir Raleigh's costume. This will give you a rapier, the best
weapon you can get until you find the sword in the catacombs.
</P>

<P>
Get the 2 bottles of wine in the director's room. Save them for the
courage spell.
</P>

<P>
STUDIO 1: There a 4 level in the catacombs interconnected by
passages going up and down. The lift cannot be accessed until you
have reach level 4. Turn on the lift when you are at level 1,
otherwise you won't be able to use the lift later on.
</P>

<P>
A scorpion is guarding the scroll of binding inside a cave.
</P>

<P>
There is a pool in a certain cave. Cast breath underwater to go
down. Drop everything before you go down the water. Kill the
creature in the water and get the coil of rope at the bottom. It's
weight will not allow you to surface if you carry too much items
with you. Alternatively, you can cast buoyancy if you have found
the fish bones in Studio 3.
</P>

<P>
Somewhere in level 3 you will find a dead end with 2 vines which you
can cut. Cut the longer vine to swing across the gap. You will not
be able to swing back from there onwards. So, check your inventory
before you attempt this, if you don't have the radio or telekinesis
spell with you. Go back to the building and get it first.
</P>

<P>
Swing across and explore the place until you find the dead body.
Cast telekinesis to get the wallet from the web. Open the wallet to
get the lift key. You can see a large spider across the gap. Walk
to the rim and cast an ice dart at it, this will make it cross over
to this side. When it appears. move back all the way and get out
of this place.
</P>

<P>
Find the lift on this level. Open it and go to the other side.
Close the lift door otherwise you can't use the lift later on. If
you did not lure the spider across the gap, it will appear here and
attack you. And you will probably get killed in the process.
Follow the passage and descend the web. There is an Elvira here.
Get the tomahawk. Go down and take the lift to level 1. If you did
not close the door, you must walk all the way out.
</P>

<P>
STUDIO 2: There are many rooms in the haunted house. Get the
barometer in the living room, but don't enter the passage where you
see a lady figure. You need the turn undead to kill the undead that
is inside.
</P>

<P>
Enter the dinning room. Check to make sure you have at least one
fireball spell with you before you open the cupboard on the wall.
You will faint and get carried to a room full of dead bodies. Get
the boot and wear it. There are some wine and food here. Cast a
fireball to sound the alarm, a guy will appear and attack you. Kill
him and open the door.
</P>

<P>
The kitchen is infront and have many items which you can use. The
stairs lead down to the labs. Don't talk to the scientist unless
you have disguise yourself.
</P>

<P>
Go to the other lab. There is a frankenstein here, don't click on
it. If you have cut the wires from his head, you will need to
restore a saved game or the game cannot be completed. Get the brain
on the shelf and the test tubes. Use the brain to mix a turn undead
spell.
</P>

<P>
Go back to the kitchen, take the passage out. Cast the turn undead
spell on the undead that appears. Cast courage if you always faint
at the sight of it but remember that quite a number of courage
spells is needed through out the game.
</P>

<P>
Go upstair. There is a room fill with fire. If you enter without
the resist fire spell, you'll be killed. There is nothing in the
room though.
</P>

<P>
In a bed room, you'll fall asleep and a succubi will kill you. Cast
courage before entering. Get the tunning fork on the bed.
</P>

<P>
In the kid's room, get the toy cubes.
</P>

<P>
In the room with a dead body on the bed. Pull the bedsheet aside,
get the wallet and then kill the ghost that appears. Get the wallet
and take a look at the script. A set of photographs will fall out
which you can use to disguise yourself. Shift the bedsheet to
reveal a hidden button under the bed. Press it to access the secret
passage. There you can get the 10 black candles and chalice with
human blood. If you don't have the silver crucifix, the vampires
will kill you when you take the candles.
</P>

<P>
In the room with 2 wooden boxes. Look inside them to get the box of
matches. Get the ladder.
</P>

<P>
Go upstair. A vampire will run towards you. Use the tunning fork
to kill it. Use the ladder to go up the roof. Place the copper rod
at the roof. When you have reach high enough level, cast summon
storm here to animate frankenstein.
</P>

<P>
Go to lab, set right switch to maximum and then pull the left
switch. The monster will walk towards you. You'll need to click
its head to cut the wires. There is a door behind it, so you need
to kill it when it have move enough distance from the door. Click
on the door to open it, if you can't restore and try again. Behind
the door is Elvira. The magic bag is also here.
</P>

<P>
In the room where you find a ghost guarding the door. Stand one
square infront of it and drop a toy cube. The ghost will move
forward. Move forward, open the door and enter the library. You
might want to keep a saved game here so as to read the books when
you need them. There is a paper containing the way to mix a strong
poison in the book.
</P>

<P>
In the room with the fish tank. There are two ways to get the key
inside the fish tank.
</P>

<UL>
<LI>Cast telekinesis to get the key inside.
<LI>Another more interesting way to get the key is to disguise
yourself as the lab assistant and talking to the scientist. To
dress up as the lab assistant you need the lab coat and the fuzzy
wig and the makeup box which you can find in Level 2. Look for the
scientist inside the room oppposite the frankenstein room and ask
him to mix a strong poison. Then use the poison in the meat in the
kitchen and throw the meat into the fish tank and get the key.
</UL>

<P>
After getting the key. Turn and face the picture of the duck. Drag
it to your inventory. Click on the wall behind the picture to
reveal a wall safe. Use the key from the fish tank to open it. Get
the peace pipe.
</P>

<P>
STUDIO 3: Somebody encounter a vampire here, but i didn't. Maybe I
am carrying the crucifix or I am lucky?
</P>

<P>
Go to level 2 and dress up like a wizard. You need the wizard's cap
and gown. This allows you to deal with the wizard at the bottom of
the catacombs.
</P>

<P>
There is a dead priest here. Cast the resurrect spell to resurrect
him. Get the holy water from the basin.
</P>

<P>
Move the cupboard to reveal a trap door. The graveyards have 6
levels. There are many traps along the way. You can avoid spike
pit trap by clicking on the button and avoid it. Cut wire before
crossing. Most of the chest you find here are trapped, cast detect
trap to determine the type of trap present.
</P>

<P>
Carry enough ingredient to mix at least 6 holy blast spells before
attempting to rescue Elvira. You might need to cast brain boost to
increase the number of spells you can mixed. Prepare a fair amount
of courage spells. There are 2 levels where you need to explore
under the protection of the spell.
</P>

<P>
The bright red potion will increase your spell point. I have not
figure out the use for the rest of the potions.
</P>

<P>
Lets call the surface level 0. So you need to go to level -6 to
find Elvira. At level -4 and -5, there is a ghost that is flying
around. You can't really kill it, but it can't do any harm to you
if courage spell is active.
</P>

<P>
At level -6. there is magician that will attack you if you are not
dress up like a wizard. You can pysche out the wizard if you
disguise yourself as a wizard. Otherwise, cast fireball or nova to
kill him. Elvira can be found here together with the war lance.
</P>

<P>
An angle of death might appears after you reached the surface. Cast
5-6 holy blast to kill it. A blow from it is sufficient to kill you
so save before you go up to the church.
</P>

<P>
BASEMENT: Talk to the janitor. Mention fire water. Give him the
peace pipe, war lance, magic bag and the tomahawk. Talk to him and
he'll make the 3 items sacred.
</P>

<P>
STUDIO 3 - CHURCH: Resurrect the priest if you have not done so.
Talk to him and ask him to draw a perfect pentagram from human
blood. Give him the blood from the chalice you found in the altar
room. He will agree and draw the pentagram at the car park.
</P>

<P>
CAR PARK: Walk to the pentagram, but not into it. Place the 10
black candles on the pentagram. Light the candles with the box of
matches. Use the magic bag. Wait for Cerberus to appear. Cast
bind demon to hold it. Throw war lance at it. Hack out the heart
with the tomahack.
