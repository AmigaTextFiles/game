<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Strive for the gold in over 30 events including track and field,
swimming, diving, boxing, wrestling, and fencing. As an experienced
athlete, practice up to the day of the event. Or train an athlete
for the games, improving stamina and fitness along the way!
</P>

<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
Put an athlete on training for 3 hours. Then change the date back
to the 18th. Now put the athletes training down to one hour and 
the athlete will now be 95% fit.
