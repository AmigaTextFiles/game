<P>
You play the role of young Adam, who join Delphineus, the dolphin 
on a quest to find the great whale, King Cetus. First you must gain
the trust of the citizens of Eluria before they help you. Next you
are to fullfil the prophecy of the Oracle and to save Eluria.
</P>

<P>
You begin the quest at your home. Talk with your father. Look at
the seagull. Poor thing, it's covered with oil. Take the detegent
and the rag beside the box. Pour some detegent on the rag and use
it to clean the seagull. Before your father leave, he'll pass you a
bottle of fertilizer and a transmitter. Look at the tank of water.
It's full of oil, pour some of the fetilizer inside and let the
bacteria eats up the oil. Look at the cage, the gerbil is thirsty.
Get the water beside the cage and give it to the gerbil.
</P>

<P>
Take the letter on the chair. It contains your certificate and a
membership card. Take the letter on the chair and dump it in the
recycle box. Look at the computer. Look at it a second time to
play King Quest V. Get the aluminium can on the table and throw
into the recycle box. Pick up the trash bag. Look at the
blackboard. Click on the individual part of the drawing for more
details.
</P>

<P>
It's time to leave the room. Open the door with the combination
number 9731. You are now inside the swimming pool. Read the
instructions on the blackboard. Talk to dolphin a few times. Get
mackeral from the bucket and feed the dolphin a few times. Go
inside the pool and ride the dolphin. Get the frisbee and throw it
at the dolphin. Play with the dolphin until it starts talking.
Talk to it. It's name is Delphineus. Throw the frisbee at the
dolphin a few more times. Look at the propeller and see how it was
kept safe. Pull the lever beside the gate to open the hatch. The
dolphin will then swim away.
</P>

Days Passed...

The dolphin has return. Open the cabinet and get the swimming gear.
Wear the swimming gear and enter the sea. Swim around until you

servant, take the trident. Go to the temple again. Use the trident
to poke the three eyes. The Oracle appears, talk to it. Arrange
the mosiac. The Oracle will then ask you three riddles and tell you
to click on the picture to answer it. For my case the 3 answers
are: MAN, FISH and LOVE. (I don't know whether everytime the same
riddles will be asked or not) The oracle will tell you to gain the
trust of the citizens of Eluria before it tell you the prophecy.
