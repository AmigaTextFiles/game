<H2>TIPS</H2>

<H3>OPENING DOORS</H3>

<P>
There are hundreds of doors throughout the castle and many will be
locked. A collection of keys and lock-picks can be found and used
to open these doors. There are three types of door, which are:
</P>

<P>
Low Security Door ------- Use a lock-pick to open it<BR>
Grade 1 Security Door - Use a Grade 1 key to open it<BR>
Grade 2 Security Door - Use a Grade 2 key to open it
</P>

<P>
Each key/lock-pick can only be used once but any unlocked doors will
remain so until the end of the game. Beware of the Prisoner's
Quarters because many of the doors here lead into small empty rooms
- therefor precious keys may be unecessarily wasted. Explore all
areas as soon as possible and remember which contain useful items so
they can be collected early on in future games.
</P>

<H3>AVOIDING GERMANS</H3>

<P>
The Castle is regularly patrolled by sentries, who walk around on
selected routes looking to stop escape attempts.
</P>

<P>
Some Germans (if they think a POW is getting away) may open fire.
As these guards are skilled marksmen, they will need only one bullet
to kill a potential escapee. To minimise the chance of a Guard
shooting you in the back, place a solid object (such as a wall)
between yourself and the Nazi. Even better is to walk through an
unlocked door where you will be able to hide and should remain safe
for a while.
</P>

<P>
Wait in a room in 'Stooge' for a couple of minutes and the guard
should go away, as they rarely enter certain rooms at all. However,
leaving sanctuary too early may mean the guard is still snooping
around and you are likely to get arrested.
</P>

<P>
Beware when opening doors because sentries have a nasty habit of
waiting on the other side. Arrest in this situation is almost
unavoidable, as you will usually walk straight into the German!
</P>

<P>
Remember there are always at least two sentries patrolling each
courtyard at any time.
</P>

<H3>EQUIPMENT</H3>

<P>
Various tools and other important items can be collected to aid your
escape. Most are hidden behind walls, tables, bunks, etc, so you
should investigate every possible hiding place. Some of the most
important equipment includes:
</P>

<P>
Keys ----------------- Use these to open specific doors<BR>
Lock-pick ------------ Use these to open low-security doors<BR>
Uniform -------------- Disguise yourself as a Nazi<BR>
Pick-axe, Saw, Spade - Use to re-open disused tunnels<BR>
Candle --------------- Needed in tunnels to light your way<BR>
Stone ---------------- Throw to distract the attention of suspicious
guards<BR>
Pass ----------------- Use this with the uniform. It will be
discarded if stopped and interrogated by genuine guards<BR>
Papers --------------- Needed at the main gateway in conjunction
with the Pass and Uniform
</P>

<P>
Never carry too much equipment at once because if you're caught
every item will be confiscated and lost. Stash equipment in 'Safe'
areas (such as the Chapel) as these places are never searched by the
Germans. Although several trips may be required and this can be
time consuming, you run no risk of having valuable equipment
confiscated.
</P>

<H3>GENERAL</H3>

<P>
Pressing the 'F9' key will allow your POWs to go to sleep in a bunk
at their start location. This is very useful at night because the
Fatigue bar will diminish. If a tired POW is sent to Solitary, rest
him for a few minutes when he is returned to his Quarters.
</P>

<P>
Use the map supplied with the game as it gives an outline to each
sector of the castle. Although not every room is included, at least
it shows you roughly your current whereabouts.
</P>

<P>
Nazi guards will not hesitate to open fire if it looks as if you're
getting away. If a pursuing sentry stops running then it's a safe
bet he's about to fire - and they never miss. A good tactic to
avoid this is, if the German is not too close, to suddenly stop
running. The sentry will run towards you to make an arrest at which
point you should continue your escape and head for a door or
obstacle to put between you. As it takes a second for a Nazi to
raise and lower his rifle you will still be able to successfully
avoid him - but only if your timing is right! Fatigue plays an
important part in the game, especially after a POW has been doing a
lot of running.
</P>

<P>
If the Fatigue bar is filled, you will only be able to walk.
