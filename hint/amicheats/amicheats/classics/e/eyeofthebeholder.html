<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Eye of the Beholder, the first graphically based AD&D computer FRP
game, uses the mouse or keyboard and an easy point-and-click
interface to pick up objects, move or throw them, to ready weapons,
to cast spells, etc. In the Forgotten Realms city of Waterdeep, your
party of four PC's and up to two NPC's have been hired by the City
Council to discover the conspiracy hidden below the city.
</P>

<H2>CHEATS</H2>

<P>
Make two copies of disk 2 then make up your parties on both disks.
Play the game as usual, but when you find any secret passages or
walls, or unlock any doors, insert the other disk and continue
playing for a short while. This passes all the data onto this
disk. Replace the original disk and continue playing and now, if
you get stuck in the game and you have to start again, simply
continue with the other disk and all the doors that were previously
locked will be open. Plus, you'll be able to pick up the keys that
you needed to unlock them as a bonus!

<H2>PORTALS</H2>

<P>
The dwarves that built the halls beneath the Waterdeep sewers used a
series of magic portals to move quickly through their underground
empire. These portals are now used by Xanathar and his minions as a
system of high-speed transportation. These portals and the stone
items that trigger them make it much easier for the party to move
and explore. There are 16 different portals, each one requiring a
special enchanted stone item as a key. There are 7 different stone
items in EYE OF THE BEHOLDER: holy symbol, necklace, orb, dagger
medallion, scepter and ring.
