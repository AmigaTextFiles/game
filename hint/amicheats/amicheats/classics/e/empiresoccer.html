<P>
Select the ten minute game and hold down the fire button at all
times (even when your player gets the ball). Stop running but keep
the fire button pressed. The opposition will immediately slide
tackle you. This will almost always cause them to get fouled.
They will be given a yellow card (and eventually a red one) and
eventually be sent off the field. Continue this until there is 
only three players left on the opposing team (the goalie and two
field men). You might be able to get more players fouled out, but
it may be hard. You should now have all your players and will be
able to run circles around the opposing team.
