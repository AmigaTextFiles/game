<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Featuring the sultry Elvira, the world's most famous spokesperson
for ghouls and goblins, the game leads players on a ghostly and
grisly role-playing adventure through a demon-filled medieval
castle. Search for The Scroll of Spiritual Mastery' sealed in a
chest bearing six different locks. You must find this before
Elvira's relative, Queen Emelda, who recently rose from the dead. In
your search you will cast spells using the book of magic spells
while fighting off evil creatures.
</P>

<H2>CHEATS</H2>

<P>
When you die and the picture of your head appears and you are asked
if you want to play again, remove the disk and select 'YES'. You
should restart where you left off. Your life points will be zero
but you can do this over and over.
</P>

<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
In this game, healing spells is very rare. So if possible try to
win all combats without injuring yourself. This may sounds
difficult but it is possible. I did! The best weapon is the
crusader's sword, followed by the longsword. So, when you started
playing, get the longsword as soon as possible, it is in the
armoury. The armoury has lots of weapons and armours but don't take
the armor unless you are carrying very little items, get the shield
instead, choose the one which give the best protection. Weapons
skill improve through practice, so stick to the longsword at the
beginning. Don't waste your spells on the guards, save them for the
gremlins that are inside the garden maze. Fight at the in until you
reach the monster's lair. Cast two spells into the cave to finish
the monsters inside. Once the monsters in the lair is destroyed,
none will appear anymore. Get Elvira's ring and then use it to get
the crusader's sword.
</P>

<P>
Make a save before any fight. When in combat, try to guess which
direction the enemy is attacking, prepare to block when they did.
If you are injured, carry on the fight but load in the saved game
and try again until you have defeated the enemy without any injury.
At first it might be difficult, but once you have a weapon skill of
60 and above, combat is easy. So in the mean time, endure!
Remember one thing though, monsters get lesser and lesser as you
finish them off. So after a time, you don't have to worry about
combat anymore. To block an enemy attack correctly, all you need is
to block/parry at the correct timing, after a few fights, you should
be able to judge when to block/parry. As for attacking, you can try
any manner of attacking, but once in a while change your combat
style a bit to confuse the enemy.
</P>

<P>
Ingredients are very limited. So try to collect them when you came
across them. Click on anything you see in the screen. Click on
trees to get herb, click on plants to get flowers, leaves, etc.
Click on hole to look inside them. Click on skull to get the bottle
inside. So, you can see that almost anything that is visible is
worth clicking. Try not to avoid those area you have been to, they
might contains some useful items.
</P>

<H2>SOLVE</H2>

<P>
Enter the castle and be thrown in the dungeon by the captain.

the library and take the spellbook. Go to the weapon room. Take
the long sword and use it. Take the shield and use it. Take the
crossbow.
</P>

<P>
Go downstairs to the kitchen. Take the honey jar (on the right),
give the spellbook to Elvira. Ask her to mix the spell 'herbal
honey'. Drink the potion.
</P>

<P>
Go upstairs to the second floor. Enter all open rooms and quickly
go out if it is the vampire's room. For the other rooms, search
every piece of furniture to find arrows, Laudanum (in the mouse hole
of the bathroom), and a bible. Look in the bible and get the
parchment.
</P>

<P>
Go downstairs and to the courtyard. Go to the garden, search every
bush, every tree... to find ingredients (even a branch on the
screen can hide an ingredient). Search as long as you are outside
the castle.
</P>

<P>
Head towards the target. Use the crossbow 4 times. Get back the 3
arrows on the target. Go to see the man with a Hawk. Wait for the
bird to fly off. Use the crossbow when the bird is in the middle of
the screen. Take feathers, the gold key and your arrow.
</P>

<P>
Go into the garden house. Take 2 worms (on the corpse ), 1 mallet,
1 crucifix. Take seeds from the iron box, find and take an iron key
go to the entrance of the labyrinth. At each bad encounter, use the
2 spells (the little devils will explode far from you without
causing damage). Each time you see a plant, take it and put it in
your bag, (besides, it is subtle to put all ingredients there). In
the middle of the labyrinth there is a bush full of eyes. Use the
crossbow twice (that makes these eyes disappear). Enter the bush
and take Elvira's jewel.
</P>

<P>
Walk to the "fountain" (basin). Take all the plants (black
lotus..). Go back into the labyrinth. Go to the locked door in the
garden. Unlock the door (with the iron key). Enter the small
garden. Take all the plants except the verbena, lemon, the cabbage,
the onion and the foxglove that are useless (like the daisy).
</P>

<P>
Go back to the courtyard. Enter the dungeon. Enter every cell and
look for bugs. Besides, take 5 cobwebs. Normally, you should find
5 centipedes, 5 earwigs, 10 spiders and 5 scarabs.
</P>

<P>
In this maze, you'll find the torture chamber. Go there (you will
find it by trying all cells). Take the salt bag. Pull the ring on
the right (on the ground). Take the skeleton and the gold key.
</P>

<P>
To the courtyard again. Go down the well. Take the moss on the
walls. Instead of Elvira, a fat she-cook threatens you. Throw the
salt bag at her. Turn on your right. Take 2 bottles of white wine.
Take the ingredients out of your bag. Have Elvira mix "iridescent
pride" (not sure of the English name) on the passage. Click on the
passage and Elvira brings you a gold key. Have Elvira mix other
healing spells (wooden heart...).
</P>

<P>
Go upstairs again (leave the ingredients in the kitchen). Go to the
church (in the castle). Take the missal (made of manticore
leather). Go to the altar. Click on it, insert Elvira's jewel in
the hole of the cross. Enter this hole
</P>

<P>
Look at the fresco at the back and use the parchment from the bible.
Turn round and take the crown. Turn round again and use the crown
on the Skeleton-King. You can now take his sword. Use it till the
end of the game.
</P>

<P>
Go outside the church and go to the living room. Take the wooden
pike and the plant called 'Monsbera' ( Moonberry?) Go upstairs and
enter the vampire's room. Kill the vampire with the pike, take
Vampire Powder and search the room.
</P>

<P>
Go to the library and put away the objects you won't use any more:
old sword, empty bible, dagger, iron key...)
</P>

<P>
To the courtyard. Go to the smithy. Take the bowl in the embers.
Put the crucifix in the bowl. Dip an arrow into the bowl.
</P>

<P>
Go to the stables and kill the werewolf with the silver arrow. Take
horse hair. Pull the last ring and ...YES!!! A golden key!
</P>

<P>
Get back to the kitchen and have Elvira mix new spells: Knight
Elixir (?), Manticore, and Mushroom Tenderness (?). Goto the
courtyard.
</P>

<P>
Walk down to the catacombs. Look for the "Stone Monster" and kill
it. (Save before doing this 'cuz he's a bit hard to defeat') Once
you've killed it, take his stone (hence the name...) and enter the
room he comes from. Search the graves, take the brown key.
</P>

<P>
Get out of this room and search ALL the other rooms in there. Be
sure to search the LEFT graves before the RIGHT graves. When you
finally discover an empty grave, put the skeleton into it. When you
open the right grave, water spurts and... go for a bit of Scuba
diving guys!
</P>

<P>
Get back to the surface as soon as possible (the well), then swim
down the well and to the iron gate. Unlock the gate with the brown
key. Swim to the surface (and do this each time the computer tells
you you're choking).
</P>

<P>
Search the bottom of the swamps/marsh. And WOW! Another Golden key
on a corpse! Find the iron gate, re-open it and come out through
the well.
</P>

<P>
Make numerous fights to increase your SKILL (e.g. go round the
ramparts (The knight must be killed with the crossbow)). When
you're trained well, go see the captain at the entrance (that
sinister guy who had you brought to the dungeon at the beginning of
the game...) and SLAY him. Steal his golden key concealed under the
note on the wall.
</P>

<P>
Walk again to the torture chamber. Take the pair of pincers. Head
for the kitchen take embers with the pair of pincers. (Your pincers
will have a glowing tip.)
</P>

<P>
Go to the ramparts and to the ready-to-use cannon, and use the
pincers on the match. Go to the "destroyed tower". Close-up on the
chest and use the 6 golden keys from the left to the right. When
the chest is open, take the dagger and the parchment.
</P>

<P>
Head for the catacombs. Use the parchment to get rid of the
spectres. Walk to the intersection of two tunnels where one finds a
hole in the ground. Close-up on the hole. Use the Stone from the
monster in that hole.
</P>

<P>
Use each power-up spell you have. In the hole. Insert the sword in
the hole (in the middle of the star), it disturbs Emelda for a brief
moment.
</P>

<P>
Take advantage of it and use the parchment, then use the dagger.
</P>

<P>
EMELDA DIES !!!
