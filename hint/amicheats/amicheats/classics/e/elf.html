<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
You encounter strange experiences in your travels as Cornelius the
Elf. Your true love, Elisa, has been abducted by Necrilous the Not
Very Nice, and imprisoned her in his dark castle. To reach her, you
must traverse enchanted woods, underground mines, jungle swamps, and
snow-capped peaks, where bizarre, villainous creatures and devious
puzzles test your mettle at every step! Fortunately, your magic
ring can cast many spells, increasing in power as you tread deeper
into mystical lands of goons, goblins, and demons. You can even
control some of the background game features, helping you get to
where you think you should be. Numerous secret areas lie within the
forest, where vital clues can aid your quest, but beware - your own
ghost may materialize to haunt you!

<P>
On the first level go up to the sage and type "CHEAT", then enter
what he replies, which is "CHOROPOO". Press `W' to get the wolf
potion and the hardman potion can be obtained by pressing 'H'.
