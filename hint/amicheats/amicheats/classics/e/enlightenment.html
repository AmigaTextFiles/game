<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Trek through desert, swampland, caverns of darkness, and more to
destroy the evil Acamantor in this fast-paced action-adventure game.
Enlightenment conjures up all the power and magic you could ever
imagine in one game. Its fast-paced adventure keeps you blasting and
baffling your enemies at every turn. Superb effects in sight and
sound, 15 treacherous levels, 32 different spells and a two-player
option. Summon your master magician and elements to aid you in your
quest.
</P>

<H2>SECRET LEVELS</H2>

<P>
To find the secret levels at the start of the game immediately go
left to the desert, then continue left to the firezone. Head to
the upper most left corner of this area and you should see lava
with a patch on it that looks like a section of the firewall spell.
As quickly as you can, walk on this patch and you will be whisked
away to secret levels.
</P>

<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
When you reach a new unexplored plane, take out the disk and kill
the druid. Instead of returning to the village, you will be
returned to the plane you died on. Insert the disk, and start
playing again, use this as many times you want. However, there is a
problem with this, you lose all the spells that you had before, and
start the game with the normal compliment of spells, so you might
not last long on later levels, but you can explore the later levels.
