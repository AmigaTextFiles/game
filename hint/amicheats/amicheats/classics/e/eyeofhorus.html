<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Eye of Horus is an arcade, adventure game set in ancient Egypt, in
which the player relives the ancient myth of Horus. As Horus, the
player can transform from man-god to hawk at will in search of the
missing pieces of his Father's body. However, somewhere in the
confines of the tomb lies the awesome presence of your evil Uncle
Set who wants to destroy you!

<P>
After you type in the copy protection and it says to press fire,
type "SPAM" instead. The game will start, and you'll have infinite
lives and you won't need any of the keys.
