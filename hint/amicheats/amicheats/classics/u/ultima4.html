<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Fantasy role playing. Become an Avatar and lead your people by
demonstrating the virtues of Avatarhood. Hundreds of characters to
interact with. Difficult challenges, ethical dilemmas.
</P>

<H2>STRATEGY</H2>

<H3>CHARACTER CREATION</H3>

<P>
There is a way to determine your character's class. When the Gypsy
asks you to choose one of the virtues - Honesty, Compassion, Valour,
Justice, Sacrifice, Honour, Spirituality or Humility over another,
the higher virtue appears on the LEFT as choice 'A'. The eight
classes - Mage, Bard, Fighter, Druid, Tinker, Paladin, Ranger or
Shepherd correspond to the virtues in this manner: If you choose
all 'A' answers, you'll be a Mage; Seven 'A' answers and then a 'B'
will make you a Bard, and so on. The Bard, with his sling, and the
Mage, with spell-casting ability, begin with distinct advantages.
The size of monster parties on the surface is based on the size of
your group, so unless you enjoy lots of large-scale battles, don't
enlist any party members (except maybe a Mage) until you've become
an Avatar.
</P>

<H3>CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT</H3>

<P>
Half the game is devoted to developing the virtues. (see the
DUNGEON section for the secret to building strength and other
traits). Hawkwind, in Lord British's Castle, will inform you of
your progress. The numbers match the order of the virtues
previously listed and 99 means you're ready for elevation. Talk to
everyone you meet. Actions are also important, and improper actions
will cost you points. To earn Honesty points, never steal, pay less
than a shop's quoted price or lie. The trick question is: "Have
you never lied?", whose correct answer is "No". For Compassion,
give one piece of gold to beggars. Valour is attained by victorious
combat, but don't attack non-evil creatures or you'll lose Justice
and Honour points. And if you attack them while they're fleeing
you'll lose Honour! It's O.K. to fight them if they attack. Never
flee from combat unless in mortal danger, or you'll lose Valour.
Honour is attained by not cheating in shops and by finding the
runes, stone, bell, book and candle. Give blood when a Healer asks
for donations to earn Sacrifice points. You gain a few Spirituality
points each time you talk to Hawkwind. For Humility, always say
"No" when asked if you're proud of something or best at anything -
unless asked if you are the MOST HUMBLE.
</P>

<H3>THE MOON GATES</H3>

<P>
Each gate has THREE phases, which can be determined by the
three-part cycle of the moons. The first number below refers to the
gate as you enter it, the last three to your destination.
</P>

<P>
Gate Vicinity - Activation ----- Lat. - Long. - 1st - 2nd - 3rd
</P>

<P>
1 | Moonglow - | New Moon ------ | I'F" | O'A" | - 1 -- 2 | 3<BR>
2 | Britain -- | Crescent Waxing | G'G" | G'A" | - 4 -- 5 | 6<BR>
3 | Jhelom --- | 1st Quarter --- | O'A" | C'G" | - 7 -- 8 | 1<BR>
4 | Yew ------ | Gibbous Waxing- | C'F" | D'C" | - 2 -- 3 | 4<BR>
5 | Minoc ---- | Full Moon ----- | B'D" | K'G" | shrine 6 | 7<BR>
6 | Trinsic -- | Gibbous Waning- | M'C" | G'I" | - 8 -- 1 | 2<BR>
7 | Skara Brae | Last Quarter -- | H'O" | B'H" | - 3 -- 4 | 5<BR>
8 | Magincia - | Crescent Waning | K'H" | L'L" | - 6 -- 7 | 8
</P>

<H3>COMBAT & MAGIC</H3>

<P>
Prepare lots of spells and carry some extra reagents. Missile
weapons like slings are especially valuable. If you step back
instead of advancing towards monsters in the combat arena, they will
often move into the firing line. You can outrun them on a horse.
One effective combat tactic is to line your crew into two columns.
See the Virtues section on Valour, Justice and Honour for other
combat tips. Some spells aren't revealed in the manual: Gate
Travel (a f h), Undead (a c), Resurrect (a b c d e h).
</P>

<H3>THE QUEST BEGINS</H3>

<P>
The first stage of this solution is from the viewpoint of a Mage.
To follow it with another class, use the Moon Gates to reach
Moonglow. Search the chest next to Mariah for the Rune of Honesty.
Don't buy any magic herbs if just starting out. Instead, visit the
Lycaeum on the Northwest coast. Ask the Baron about the word and
he'll say: "VER" which is part of the Word Of Passage. Enter the
Moon Gate, West of Moonglow during a New moon and search for the
Stone of Humility. Enter during the next New moon and go to
Britannia.
</P>

<H3>SECRETS OF LORD BRITISH'S CASTLE</H3>

<P>
Go East in the Castle, open the door and find the WHITE DOT on the
North wall. These mark secret doors. Go North to the dot leading
East; outside you'll find Joshua and a riddle. Re-enter the passage
and go North into the Northeast Castle Rampart. Go West to meet
Shawn for tips on Humility. A ladder in this rampart leads to the
second level and the Prison; a secret door leads West to behind the
Castle and a ladder to the Dungeon Hythloth. A Healer is due South
of the first secret door. On the West side of the Castle you'll
find Hawkwind through the first door AFTER moving South. Go North
and East through the door just South of the ladder. Search in the
LOWER RIGHT CORNER for the Rune of Spirituality. Head upstairs to
meet Lord British, who will heal you if asked about Health and you
say "No". He'll also promote you to higher levels when you've
earned it.
</P>

<H3>BRITAIN AND PAWS</H3>

<P>
Buy a Sling. At the end of the long hall North of the Inn, search
for the Rune of Compassion. Enter the secret door in the Healer's
and Julio about nature for Honesty points. Keep the sea in sight
while moving South.  Cross the two bridges going East and enter
Paws.  Buy a horse.  South of the Stables, just below the
Stablehand, search for the Rune of Humility. The Herb Shoppe is
behind a secret door in the Armoury.
</P>

<H3>BLOODY PLAINS AND MANDRAKE ROOT</H3>

<P>
You need 900 gold for your next major purchase, so kill lots of
monsters on the way to Lord British's Castle. Get healed and head
East from Moon Gate 2, crossing the bridge and moving East until you
see mountains to the North. Go North, passing the eastern bridge,
and circle Lock Lake. Southeast of the lake you'll spy a pass
through the foothills that leads East and exits into the Bloody
Plains to the Northeast. To find Mandrake Root, stand on the SINGLE
SQUARE OF SWAMP and search during a New Moon. Go due East through a
small mountain pass that leads North and you'll find Vesperon the
South coast.
</P>

<H3>VESPER</H3>

<P>
Don't enter without 900 gold. Then visit the Guild and ask about
ITEM D. Use it to get your bearings; most of the sites listed in
the charts used, employ these co-ordinates. You can also pick up
Humility points in Vesper, whose walls are lined with secret doors.
</P>

<H3>ON THE ROAD AGAIN</H3>

<P>
Head back to Lord British, yelling at the horse to hurry if you're
seriously wounded. After checking with him and Hawkwind you're
ready to travel the land and build up your character by earning 99
points in each virtue and acquiring the runes and mantras needed to
enter the shrines. Complete this for all virtues and you'll have
attained Partial Avatarhood. First go to Paws and stock up on
ginseng and garlic, then use the Moon Gates and the sextant to reach
the following locations for the necessary items or information.
Later you can raise lots of gold by finding the Mystic Armour and
weapons; sell them and return for more, and repeat until rich.
Ships won't appear until later in the game, and Jhelom or Skara Brae
are good places to find one.
</P>

*** = In Library, West of Rob and Beth in Lycaeum<BR>
**** = Behind fire in Cove's Temple
</P>

<H3>THE BALLOON AND THE WHITE STONE</H3>

<P>
Enter the Hythloth Dungeon behind Britannia, exit immediately and
enter the Balloon. Climb and descend to fly it, and use wind spells
to steer. Fly West and North to the Serpent's Spine mountain range
and land at the Avatar Symbol for the White Stone. You can also fly
to Cove on the East shore of Lock Lake, otherwise accessed by
entering a whirlpool while on a ship.
</P>

<H3>ELEVATION AND EQUIPMENT</H3>

<P>
When you have all eight runes and mantras and are ready for
elevation, meditate at each shrine for three minutes. After
acquiring the items listed previously and talking to everyone for
clues, buy the best weapons: three Magic Wands, three Magic Bows,
one Crossbow, one Sling, and Armour for each character. Stock up on
Reagents and food, then say "Join" to everyone in the eight major
towns to recruit your party. The only tricky ones are the Shepherd
(enter Magincia, exit the gate and go South along the wall) and
Geoffrey, the Fighter in Jhelom who won't join until your party
reaches a high enough level. Now head for the Dungeons.
</P>

<H3>INTO THE DUNGEONS</H3>

<P>
Two goals await: Finding the Stones at the Altars and using them in
the Altar Rooms to get the 3-part Key. The Dungeons are connected
by the Altar Rooms, but all three Altars can be found in Hythloth -
so you can save time by visiting it after acquiring all eight stones
instead of going to the Altar Rooms in the other Dungeons. The
Stones are also necessary for getting through the Stygian Abyss.
You can raise your Strength, Intelligence and Dexterity by touching
Magical Balls in the Dungeons. This will cost the character some
hit points, which can be restored with a Heal Spell. The sections
on each Dungeon tell how to find these balls, the Stones and the
Altars. Peer at a gem when you first enter a Maze, then check it
again and compare with the directions if you get disorientated.
</P>

<P>
You can do them in any order; this path leads through the ones whose
Magical Balls do the LEAST damage, to avoid depleting hit points too
quickly. You'll have to decide which characters should touch a
Ball, since they only work once. When told to go UP or DOWN, in
these sections, this refers to using ladders, NOT casting those
spells. The Dungeons are connected by the Altar Rooms, so always
leave by the door you entered - especially in Dungeons accessible
only by boat. Otherwise you'll emerge outside a faraway Dungeon
when you cast an X-it Spell.
</P>
