<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Based on the smash-hit movie. The Untouchables virtually blasts its
way onto your computer screen. The game's spectacular busts, raids,
shootouts, and duels put you in control of Eliot Ness' elite squad
of Mafia-busters. You'll relive the knife-edge existence of these
fabled lawmen as they crusade against lawlessness and injustice
through the crime-infested streets of Chicago in the 1920's. Take on
the Mob as you lead the Untouchables on their most difficult mission
ever. Every minute contains explosive action and intense adventure,
and a thrilling denoument ends the game.
