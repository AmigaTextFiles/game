</P>

<P>
Enter the Transmorgifier and examine yourself. Keep on doing this

<P>
You now need to get the anchor from the Boat Wreck (SouthEast, South
of At the Big Oak). Bring it back to the Leap of Faith, and drop it

</P>

<P>
Go North nine times then East to the Monolith Room and look behind
the monolith. South, Up to Behind the Waterfall where you will find
the gold bar. Eat the Cheezspecs. Look through the clear lens and
it should tell you that on the bookmark in the trollish book is the
word "snorgumfert." Put the gold bar in the bucket (i.e. you must
be carrying all seven objects and can do so this way or as a
gorilla; it's ok to solve the game as a gorilla). Now you should
have all seven items from the newinfo list: tinted lens, paper clip
("thin piece of wire"), soda can ("metal cylinder"), went stones
("many stones of equal size"), bullet ("a piece of silver"), a bar
of solid gold, and the mirror provides the "image of a follower of
Duhda." So, snorgumfert and get the scope.
</P>

<P>
Go to the Courtyard, wear the slippers, and roll the newspaper. Go
East and then "Put slippers in vaporizer," and "Hit dog with
newspaper." Don't dawdle here or you'll get killed by the dog. Go
to the Acme CEO's Office and "Look through scope."
