<H2>CHEATS</H2>

<P>
The cheat mode is accessed by following these steps:
</P>

<OL>
<LI>While the game is running press "F2" to access the information
window.
<LI>Click on the "Prefs" button.
<LI>Change your Centurion's name to "iwannacheat". (Without quotes)
<LI>Click on the "OK" button to get to the main screen.
<LI>Press "C" (on your keyboard) to get the cheat window.
</OL>

<P>
You have these options:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>Invincible (If used on the base your Tekite glows like he picked
up an Energy Crystal III. Tekite (and Hovar,) are invincible (even
after the glow stops.) An interesting side-effect is you do not burn
ammo when you fire your weapons.)
<LI>Ice Mode (Enemy in room is frozen when you enter. You can
download info from the Kapones immeadately.)
<LI>All Weapons (Obvious, and very nice to have.)
<LI>Full Ammo (Really good for your Hovar Weapons as well. It also
maxes out your "spare ammo" for your Centurion's weapons. Word of
warning, since your ammo reserve is maxed out, any spare ammo you
pick up ends up in your inventory. You can fill up your inventory
very fast on some levels.)
<LI>Full Credits (If you get any more credits the number goes to a
negitive number. However, in the fast check out of the cheat mode,
spending money brings you back to normal numbers and there doesn't
seem to be any problems with this minor quirk.)
<LI>Door Access (Works about the same as having the Base Card.)
<LI>Enhanced (You get all Tekite Personal Enhancemants and nine of
each Weapon Enhancement. You must still manually add each
enhancemant to your weapons. If you want all weapons to be fully
enhanced, run this cheat once. Add the enhancemants to all the
weapons you can. You then run the cheat again to get nine more
weapon enhancements (your Tekite Personal enhancements will still be
with you as well.))
<LI>Full Map (Gets full base map. I don't currently know if it help
on the surface.)
<LI>Full Fuel (Vital on long surface missions. Yes, you can access
the cheat menu while in the hovar!)
</UL>

<H2>SOLVE</H2>

<H3>LEVEL 1: Blackout</H3>

<P>
Enter Base of CASTALIA (q.u.i.e.t.l.y.) and travel to the Research
room. Download information which tells of the research about
metamorphing the Tekite shape to the Commander shape through the
programming of the Transport Computer. Go to the storage room next
door and search room and locate the program instruction chip. This
room has a Kapone at a cabinet. If there is not too much delay the
Kapone will not turn and notice you. If observed you must destroy
that Kapone before leaving that section of the base.
</P>

<P>
Continue to search Section one of the base and you will locate a
Credit Card on a dead colonist, an amunition clip and an autofire
weapon enchancment. Another room will contain some colonists. Lead
the colonists back to the Main transporter room and transport them
to the Elderado Station.
</P>

<P>
There is a TED in the Workers Qrts which is needed to gain access
through the security door. Both security rooms are level 0 which
means once you gain access to the first by using the TED you will be
able to get the access code to use on the 2nd security room.
However, in case you stuff it up, there is a base card in the 2nd
section of the base which will give you access to all security rooms
in the base.
</P>

<P>
Return to the Transporter room and insert the instruction chip into
the Transport Computer. Transport to Translink Rm 1 and you will
change to a Kapone Commander. You will have approx. 12 minutes to
destroy the Comms room before the Morph FX will terminate and you
change back to a Tekite.
</P>

<P>
Locate the Supply room and purchase a detonator, search the Armory
room and locate a High Explosive hidden behind some blocks in the
room. Join the detonator to the high explosive to form Primed High
Explosives. This will need power applied to the detonator to
explode.
</P>

<P>
Take these to the Comms room on the way you should locate a corridor
with a switch. This needs to be turned off as it powers the
communication device in the Comms room. Go to the Comms room and
insert the Primed Explosive into the communications device.
</P>

<P>
Return to Corridor and throw the switch and the Comms room should be
destroyed. Now locate Commander and kill him. There is a Lockup
key being carried by a Kapone in this section which is required to
free the locked Colonists. Rescue the Colonsist, kill a few Kapones
and Bobs your Uncle.
</P>

<H3>LEVEL 2: Nomad</H3>

<P>
Before embarking on this operation, you should purchase as many
LS1200 or HG0500 missiles as possible from the hovar supply computer
in the Elderado Foyer. The foyer is located in the Elderado Station
and accessed by either F3 or using the mouse to select.
</P>

<P>
From here, transport to the surface and locate sector 60:07, killing
enemy ships along the way. Once you have reached this sector, slow
down! There are four enemy missile turrets on the far outskirts,
surrounding the base. There are five communication towers that need
to be destroyed, and the only weapon is missiles.
</P>

<P>
You need to select missiles and target each towers one at a time.
Quite a few missiles are needed to penetrate a towers shields. One
"trick" is to travel into the centre of the base near the middle
building stop. You will be just out of range from the missile
turrets, and you can target the outer four towers. You will need to
move out to target the central tower, avoiding any incoming missle
fire.
</P>

<P>
Once this is done, the operation will be a success.
</P>

<H3>LEVEL 3: Spark</H3>

<P>
You are in Base Aurora. First, make your way south to the supply
room that contains numerous colonists hiding there. Walk back into
the main transporter room and wait for them to file in. Select the
"StarShip" option on the transporter and wait for them to be
transported.
</P>

<P>
Now, transport yourself to the first translink room. Search the box
at the back of the room to get a TED. Transport back to the main
transporter, then west towards the first security room. Use the TED
to blow the security door, then go in and access the security
computer to get the access code and also to unlock the doors.
</P>

<P>
Now, go north and enter the colonists room to the west of the first
foyer, search the bed with the dead colonist on it and collect the
credit card. Now, go east then north and turn east after reaching
the hydroponics room. Continue north and enter the room east of the
next foyer. Destroy the Kapone here and pick up the weapon
container it dropped. You now have a gun.
</P>

<P>
Go west and pick up the hidden hologram projector on the north wall.
You need to take out the Kapone commander to get a base card, so be
careful. Once in the commanders room, search the bed to find an
empty fuse. Travel south, then west to find two colonists.
</P>

<P>
Make your way back to the first foyer north of the security room.
Tell the colonists to stay there. Enter the security room to the
east and then out the north exit. Travel until you get to the
lockup and rescue the colonists. Travel back to the foyer and then
to the main transporter and transport the colonists to the starship.
</P>

<P>
Now, go to the supply room to the south and buy a 100amp fuse wire
with the credit card. Now using the inventory window, drop the fuse
wire on the empty fuse and you now have a complete fuse!
</P>

<P>
Go west past the first security room until you reach the second
security room. Enter the room to the south and destroy the Kapones
and pick up the control key. Head back to the first security room
and then south to the T-junction. Enter the control room to the
west. Read the number on the key via the inventory and use that
number to access the computers. Examine the generator to find the
power fault. Head east to the reactor room and insert the fuse into
the generator. Head back to the control room and enable the
generator!
</P>

<P>
NOTE: There is an armory room to the east of the security room that
is near the lockup. You should go back there after gaining credits
and buy better weaponry and/or ammunition.
</P>

<P>
NOTE: LEVELS 4 AND 5 ARE MISSING!
</P>

<H3>LEVEL 6: Retrieve</H3>

<P>
The Tekite is held in a room and is brain dead, there is a popup gun
directly underneath the Tekite ready to destroy it as soon as its
moved off.
</P>

<P>
Interrogation room is partially sealed with the computer containing
the the broken Tekite CPU in the sealed section of the room. Can
see the sealed section but cant seem to get to it.
</P>

<P>
Entry to sealed section via a switch in the sealed section that
raises a wall in a nearby corridor. This allows access to a foyer
with a hidden door through to the commanders quarters. The
Commanders quarters has a hidden door that allows access to the
interrogation room into the sealed section thus gaining access to
the broken Tekite CPU.
</P>

<P>
Go to the supply room and purchase a blank Tekite CPU then through
the inventory join the broken CPU and Blank CPU thus gaining a whole
CPU with the Tekites memory intact.
</P>

<P>
Take the complete CPU back to the Restrained Tekite, insert the CPU,
the Tekite will now be able to follow you back to the Main
Transporter room where it can be transported back to the Star
Shifter. Must first place something on the popup gun as soon as the
Tekite Moves off it.
</P>

<P>
This will complete the operation.
</P>

<H3>LEVEL 7: Captive</H3>

<P>
You are in the base of Lares. First you will need to find the
neuroscrambler which is hidden in a cabinet within the store room.
Then transport to the translink room. Enter the commanders quarters
and stun the commander. Search the room and locate the lockup key.
Go to the lockup carefully travelling through the power pyramid
corridors to avoid as much damage as possible.
</P>

<P>
Once in the lockup room DO NOT activate the wall switch directly as
this is booby trapped. Rather, shoot the switch with the laser gun
to switch off the power pyramids. Unlock the hacker using the
lockup key (right hand colonist). Lead the colonist to the Central
Computer room where he will access a terminal to activate the
central computer. Once it is activated, go to it and insert the
neuro-scrambler for programming.
</P>

<P>
Wait until the broadcast message is received from the colonist
indicating that re-programming has finished. Search the central
computer to retrive the neuro-scrambler and then go back to the
commander and insert the neuro-scrambler. The commander will now be
friendly and follow you back to the main transport room. However, a
trap room will have been released at this time and you will be
swamped by revenging Lieutenants, so be careful.
</P>

<P>
After sending back the commander rescue the remaining colonists from
the lockup (and the hacker). If you dont have lockup keys to free
them then use a TED to destroy them rather then shooting as the TED
doesn't count against you (rogue/criminal). After transporting back
the last colonist the operation is complete.
</P>
