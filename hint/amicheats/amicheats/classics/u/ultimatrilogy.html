<H2>STRATEGY</H2>

<H3>THE BEGINNING</H3>

<P>
Once you create your character, and endow him or her with race,
type, and attributes, you are ready to begin your adventure. Each
race and type of character has its own advantages and disadvantages.
Obviously, a fighter is vicious in battles, wizards or clerics throw
potent spells, and thieves are good at thievery. Experiment with
different characters. Your first step, upon finding yourself in the
middle of a grassy plain, is to ready your armour (leather) and a
weapon (dagger). Thus prepared, you may then begin to explore the
world of Ultima.
</P>

<P>
You will encounter a number of strange creatures during your
travels. On land, you will find Orcs, Evil Trents, Hoods, Knights,
Bears, Wandering Warlocks, Necromancers, Hidden Archers, Thieves,
Dark Knights, and Evil Rangers. In the ocean, there are Giant
Squid, Ness Creatures, Dragon Turtles, and Giant Octopi. It is
likely that you'll be killed quickly. If so, you will be
reincarnated. (If you're reincarnated in the middle of water, keep
trying to move or attack. These actions will use up your food and
hit points, and you'll be reincarnated again -- hopefully on land
the next time.) However, your resurrected self is lacking in food,
gold, and weapons. Take heart! Although the process of building up
your points and possessions seems slow, if you persevere you will
"ultimately" be victorious. The following strategy hints should be
helpful:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>It is often advisable to avoid combat. Try to run away from an
enemy until you can build up your hit points.
<LI>Buy and steal as much armour as possible. If you are killed, you
will retain your armor, vehicles, and spells, but you will lose your
weapons.
<LI>To increase your gold supply, you can sell some of your armour.
<LI>As soon as possible, descend into a dungeon. By entering a
dungeon and killing a number of creatures, you will gain hit points,
experience points, and gold (and food, if you're killed in a
dungeon). You can do this again and again, building up your
character.
<LI>Always buy a drink from Varg the tavern keeper in a pub. He may
give you some helpful clues.
<LI>As you gain experience points, you will find that more advanced
weapons and transportation become available in the cities. Items
such as pistols, blasters, and phazors are invaluable in battles (in
fact, sea creatures will be "out of weapon range" until you get a
hold of, at least, a set of bow and arrows). By a strange quirk in
the game, you may be able to steal technologically advanced weapons
or armor even before they're available for purchase! Use of a
vehicle will conserve your food supply during your travels.
Seagoing vessels and air cars allow you to visit islands and cross
oceans. Once you've obtained a frigate or an air car, you can use
its cannons or lasers to fire on enemies. A space shuttle will be
required for space travel.
<LI>When you enter a castle, be sure to transact with the King. If
you have sufficient gold, he will sell you hit points. If you offer
service, he will send you on a quest for which you will be
handsomely rewarded.
<LI>Save the game frequently. You never know when 7 Hidden Archers
or 4 Ness Creatures might attack and kill you.
<LI>Beware of Wenches, Jesters, and Bards. They like to steal your
possessions.
</UL>

<H3>THE DUNGEONS</H3>

<P>
Dungeon experience is vital in order to increase your hit points.
It can also be fatal. If your character is a novice, it's best to
explore only the 1st or 2nd level of a dungeon. Then you can
retrace your steps, climb out of the dungeon alive, and repeat the
process. As you become stronger, you can descend deeper into a
dungeon. There you will do battle with increasingly powerful
creatures, but you may also gain hundreds of hit points and gold
pieces. You will encounter the following enemies in any dungeon:
</P>

<P>
Levels 1 and 2: Thieves, Rangers, Skeletons, Bats, Giant Rats
</P>

<P>
Levels 3 and 4: Giant Spiders, Cyclopes, Orcs, Gelatinous Cubes,
Vipers
</P>

<P>
Levels 5 and 6: Ettins, Minotaurs, Mimics, Carrion Creepers, Lizard
Men
</P>

<P>
Levels 7 and 8: Wraiths, Wandering Eyes, Liches, Tanglers, Gremlins
</P>

<P>
Levels 9 and 10: Daemons, Balrons, Mind Whippers, Zorns, Invisible
Seekers
</P>

<P>
Even if you have accumulated many thousands of hit points, some of
the more powerful creatures can easily destroy you. You will have
to discover, through trial and error, which weapons or spells you
should use against them. (Note: Only a wizard can use the Blink,
Create, Destroy, and Kill spells.) The following strategy hints
should help you in surviving dungeon travel:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>Use the Inform and Search command frequently. This will disclose
traps which you can then avoid (rope and spikes will save you from
falling through a hidden trap, but you lose them).
<LI>Use the Destroy spell to dissolve force fields.
<LI>Use the Blink spell to escape to another place on that level
(useful when monsters are attacking from all sides or when you're
surrounded by force fields and have no Destroy spells).
<LI>Map each level so you don't get lost. Or, purchase plenty of
Ladder Up and Ladder Down spells to allow you to move easily between
levels.
<LI>Remember: You cannot save the game from within a dungeon. Also,
you cannot put on any new armour if it has been destroyed (by a
Gelatinous Cube, for example).
<LI>You may wish to use an Unlock spell to open chests, and an Open
spell to open coffins. You will find additional gold in these
containers.
<LI>If you are on a quest (to kill a Balron, Liche, Cube, or
Creeper), do not dally on other levels. Go straight down to the
level where the creature you are seeking lives (using Ladder Down
spells), kill it, then get out of the dungeon quickly (using Ladder
Up spells). It is very easy to be overwhelmed by enemies on the
lower levels, and you could be killed. Gremlins may steal all your
food; Invisible Seekers may annihilate you before you can locate
them; Mind Whippers may destroy your intelligence with their mental
attacks.
</UL>

<H3>SPACE TRAVEL</H3>

<P>
You have been exploring the four continents of Ultima, crossing
plains and oceans, and increasing your attributes and possessions.
Suddenly, you find advanced weapons, armour, and vehicles in the
cities. Purchase a space shuttle as soon as you have enough gold.
The shuttle will carry you out into space where you will strive to
destroy 20 enemy vessels. If you do this, you will be designated a
"Space Ace". You will want to be a Space Ace before rescuing the
princess. If you destroy the enemy spacecraft, and return alive to
Ultima, you will have gained thousands of experience points and will
be ready to save the Princess. Space movement can be tricky, and
the following strategy hints should help:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>The first view you will see is your shuttle, motionless in space.
Nearby is a Base, a Star, and Ultima. You can use your shuttle for
continued travel, or you can dock at the base and purchase a
different vehicle (500 gold pieces each time you exchange ships).
The smaller vehicle has limited fuel, but a lot of shield power.
The larger vehicle has plenty of fuel, but negligible shielding.
Take the smaller ship since you won't want to go very far from base.
<LI>Docking with the base in order to exchange ships takes a little
practice. If you do not dock exactly at the entry point in the
base, you will destroy your shields and be disintegrated. Try this
method: One forward thrust until you are near the base; one retro
to stop your vehicle; one left turn or right turn to position your
ship in the direction you want to go; one forward thrust to get it
moving again; one retro to stop it; etc. In this way, you can
slowly and carefully position your shuttle so that you can make a
precision docking. Exchange ships.
<LI>Once you have a new ship, you must do a sector scan. This is
accomplished by the Inform and Search command. Note: You will
always be in the centre of the sector scan. When you start out in
space, you will be where the "B" is in the middle of the sector
scan. The blank lines indicate empty space, the stars indicate
stars, and the carets indicate enemy spaceships.
<LI>Since you don't want to get too far from your starting point, and
you don't want to get lost and run out of fuel, always check the
sector scan to make sure you know where you are. If the scan shows
enemy ships to the left, turn your ship to the left. If the scan
shows enemy ships below you, turn your ship downward. Apply thrust,
then go into View change. Now you're in open space. Hit the
Hyperspace key. At this point, you will be in a sector containing
enemy ships.
<LI>Once you've destroyed the enemy ships (usually three), go into
View change mode again. Stop your ship with one retro. If you went
left originally, you'll want to return right. If you went down
originally, you must turn your ship upward, and so on. Turn your
ship to the appropriate direction, and apply thrust. Change the
view again, hit hyperspace again, change the view again. You should
be near your origination point, by a base. You can exchange ships
again, or return to Ultima. This process can be repeated many times
until you become a Space Ace.
</UL>

<H2>THE GAME</H2>

<H3>SAVING THE PRINCESS</H3>

<P>
In each castle, there is a Princess imprisoned. You will see her
pacing in her cell in the lower right of the castle. The key to her
cell may or may not be in the possession of the Jester (hopping
around near the King). You must kill the Jester in order to get the
key. Keep trying until you get the correct key that will unlock the
Princess' cell. The following strategy tips should assist you in
freeing the Princess:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>You'll notice that the Jester sometimes comes near you as you
enter the King's throneroom. Try to get him to stay near the
entrance. Then you can kill him, and run (quickly!) down and over
to the Princess' cell. Hit "U" to unlock the door. The Princess
will follow you out of the cell if the correct key has been used.
If you have not obtained the correct key, and the one you have does
not unlock the door, follow the instructions below anyway in order
to try to escape with your life.
<LI>The moment you kill the Jester, the guards will be upon you.
They are virtually impossible to kill, so your best course is to
outrun them. First of all, try to position the Princess between
yourself and the guards. This will take a little practice, but
eventually you should learn how to line the guards up behind you as
you run for the castle exit.
<LI>Move quickly, being careful not to run into walls, trees, or
ponds. One false move, and you'll be trapped between guards. In
the far left room, try exiting to the north of the pond, and out
left. It's tricky, but possible. As you leave the castle, the
Princess will reward you handsomely and will tell you where to find
the Time Machine.
</UL>

<H3>BATTLING MONDAIN</H3>

<P>
Once you rescue the Princess and locate the Time Machine, you are
ready to do battle with the evil wizard Mondain. Board the craft
and launch. Although you are now an expert fighter (you've done
away with Balrons and Liches, right?), Mondain will nevertheless
engage you in the battle of your life. The following tactics should
help you destroy the Evil Gem, kill Mondain, save the universe and,
not incidentally, win the game:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>You must first destroy the Evil Gem. Immediately approach the
gem and hit "G" to get it. This action will destroy the gem. It
will also drain away most of your hit points.
<LI>If you do not destroy the gem immediately, you will not be able
to permanently kill Mondain. The Evil Gem that he created makes him
immortal, so you must destroy the gem before turning to Mondain.
<LI>Now, begin to attack Mondain. Kill spells will not work against
him; they only make him stronger. Just keep firing away until he
weakens. Persist in your attack even though he unleashes an
onslaught against you.
<LI>If your character is a wizard, you can use the Create spell to
place a force field in front of you, however, it's best to
continuing attacking Mondain. Hopefully, he will be weakening. You
can tell that this is happening because he changes into a bird and
ceases attacking you. Continue firing until you receive the message
that Mondain is dead and that you're victorious.
</UL>

<H2>LAYOUT</H2>

<P>
The game of "Ultima I" involves travel on land and sea and through
space and time. This file is to help you map a dangerous world.
The planet consists of four continents separated by oceans. These
continents contain many cities, castles, dungeons, and landmarks
which the traveler must explore. Once the adventurer has purchased
a seagoing craft or an air car, he or she may traverse the oceans
with ease. When sufficient gold and experience points are
accumulated, a space shuttle may be obtained for extraterrestrial
journeys.
</P>

<H3>CONTINENT ONE</H3>

<H4>OVERVIEW</H4>

<P>
Continent One contains two castles (Lost King and Lord British);
eight cities (Yew, Fawn, Britain, Montor, Grey, Paws, Moon, and
Tune); nine dungeons (Perinia, Lost Caverns, Mondain's Gate to Hell,
Unholy Hole, Mines of Mt. Drash (1 and 2), Death's Awakening,
Montor, and Doubt); and two landmarks (Pillars of Protection and
Tower of Knowledge).
</P>

<H4>QUESTS</H4>

<P>
Quest for King of the Castle of the Lost King: The King will ask
you to destroy a Gelatinous Cube. To do so, you must climb down to

so, return to the King who will give you a red gem. He will also
tell you that you will need four gems to launch the Time Machine.
</P>

<P>
Quest for the King of the Castle of Lord British: His Majesty will
send you to find the Tower of Knowledge. The landmark is located on
an island to the northeast of the continent. You will receive
additional strength from the King when you complete your quest and
return to him.
</P>

<H4>LANDMARKS</H4>

<P>
Pillars of Protection: This landmark is located on an island to the
northwest of the continent. Enter the landmark, and your agility
will be increased.
</P>

<P>
Tower of Knowledge: The Tower of Knowledge is on an island to the
northeast of the continent. Your intelligence will be increased
when you enter this landmark.
</P>

<H4>BARTENDERS' CLUES</H4>

<P>
Pubs: In the cities, there are pubs. Be sure to transact with Varg
the tavern keep, since he may give you clues such as: "Destroy the
Evil Gem," or "Best watch out for the wench."
</P>

<H3>CONTINENT TWO</H3>

<H4>OVERVIEW</H4>

<P>
This continent is located across the ocean to the east of Continent
One. Continent Two contains two castles (Rondorlin and Barataria);
eight cities (Snake, Owen, Gerry, Arnold, Linda, Helen, John, and
Wolf); eight dungeons (Scorpion Hole, The Labyrinth, Where Hercules
Died, Advari's Hole, The Savage Place, Horror of the Harpies,
Gorgon's Hole, and Dead Warrior's Fight); and two landmarks (Pillars
of the Argonauts and Pillar of Ozymandias).
</P>

<H4>QUESTS</H4>

<P>
Quest for the King of Rondorlin: The King orders you to kill a
Carrion Creeper. This dread creature may be found on the 5th or 6th
level of any dungeon. When you accomplish your task and return to
the King, he will give you a green gem and tell you that you must
use the Time Machine.
</P>

<P>
Quest for the King of Barataria: This quest involves locating the
Pillar of Ozymandias (on an island to the southwest of the
continent). The King will grant you increased strength upon
completion of the quest.
</P>

<H4>LANDMARKS</H4>

<P>
Pillars of the Argonauts: The pillars are located on an island to
the west of the continent. You are rewarded with various weapons
whenever you visit this landmark.
</P>

<P>
Pillar of Ozymandias: Increased wisdom is your reward for entering
the pillar (southwest of the continent).
</P>

<H4>BARTENDERS' CLUES</H4>

<P>
Pubs: If you buy a drink from a tavern keep, he may give you a hint
such as, "Best you should know about space travel, and that you must
destroy at least 20 enemy vessels to become an Ace!" or "The
Princess will reward you if you save her, and will give an
additional gift to a player of 8th level or higher."
</P>

<H3>CONTINENT THREE</H3>

<H4>OVERVIEW</H4>

<P>
Continent Three is located across the ocean to the east of Continent
Two. This land mass contains two castles (Black Dragon and
Olympus); eight cities (Poor, Ponder, Clear Lagoon, Gauntlet,
Nassau, Wealth, Imagination, and Stout); nine dungeons (The End, The
Metal Twister, The Long Death, Viper's Pit (1 and 2), Guild of
Death, Troll's Hole, Tramp of Doom, and Slow Death); and two
landmarks (Sign Post and Southern Sign Post).
</P>

<H4>QUESTS</H4>

<P>
Quest for the King of Black Dragon's Castle: The King orders you to
kill a Liche (which may be found on the 7th or 8th level of any
dungeon). If you complete this quest, His Majesty will give you a
blue gem and tell you that the Princess helps the Space Ace.
</P>

<P>
Quest for the King of the Castle of Olympus: On this quest, you
must find the Sign Post. It is located on an island to the
northwest of the continent. The King will reward you with
additional strength for completing this task.
</P>

<P>
Sign Post: This landmark is located on an island to the northwest
of the continent. Upon entering the Sign Post, you will receive
additional stamina. Southern Sign Post: Additional charisma is
your reward for finding this landmark. It is located on an island
to the southwest of the continent.
</P>

<H4>BARTENDERS' CLUES</H4>

<P>
Pubs: The tavern keep may let you in on the following information:
"One thousand years ago, Mondain the Wizard created an Evil Gem
which makes him immortal. You must traverse the lands until you
find a Time Machine. Go back in time to destroy the Evil Gem and

time." Or, he may simply say that this is a great game (as indeed it
is!).
</P>

</TT>
<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Ultima II</H1>
<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>The Revenge</H2>
<TT>

<H2>STRATEGY</H2>

<P>
Ultima II (The Revenge of the Enchantress) is Lord British's
exciting sequel to Ultima I. In Ultima II, you are challenged to
discover the secret of Minax, the evil apprentice of Mondain whom
you defeated in Ultima I. Once again, you must create a player
character who will roam land, sea, air, and even outer space,
battling strange creatures and increasing your character's
attributes and possessions. However, in Ultima II, you must also
unlock the mysteries of the Time Doors.
</P>

<H3>CREATING A CHARACTER</H3>

<P>
By allocating 90 points among 6 attributes and choosing race,
profession, and sex, you may create a player character who is
initially powerful or weak. For example, relatively high strength
is the key to being able to wear certain armour; high agility will
allow your character to wield certain weapons and steal more easily.
I had good luck with my Elf Thief ("Bugsy") who was able to steal
plenty of food, weapons, and armour. However, the Dwarf Wizard
("Hirsutus") I created endured a long, slow battle to merely stay
alive. Experiment with different combinations to find out which is
more successful and enjoyable for you.
</P>

<P>
A note about spellcasters: Clerics and Wizards may purchase spells
in Villages. However, spells are both very expensive and relatively
useless. Spells can only be cast within Dungeons and Towers and,
unfortunately, you can easily win the game without ever entering
either of those places.
</P>

<H3>BEGINNING THE QUEST</H3>

<P>
You start out with 400 hit points, 400 foods, and 400 gold. This
may seem like plenty, but it isn't. Your food disappears quickly as
you explore, your hit points diminish rapidly when you are attacked
by creatures, and your gold pieces must be exchanged for supplies
and equipment. However, you can always attempt to steal, and you
can purchase additional hit points by transacting with a King.
</P>

<P>
Your first task is to obtain a weapon and armour. From where you
are when you boot the game diskette, walk west and south into Towne
Linda (it looks like a cloverleaf). You will find both an armoury
and a weapons vendor there. After leaving Towne Linda, travel south
until you reach Le Jester Village (it looks like 5 small circles).
Villages are the only places where you can obtain additional food.
Now you're ready to do some serious adventuring. But, before you
begin your campaign in earnest, be sure to save the game. It's very
easy to get killed, and you will want to be able to return to the
status quo ante.
</P>

<P>
A word of advice: This game has an annoying "feature" involving the
save game function. First of all, unlike Ultima I, Ultima II has no
provision for two disk drives, so be prepared for frequent disk
swaps. Secondly, if your character enters a Town, Village, Castle,
Dungeon, or Tower (i.e., there has been interaction with the player
diskette), and you are then gravely injured or, perhaps, have spent
money on an item you are not allowed to use, and you then leave that
location (i.e., another disk interaction), you will not be able to
turn off your machine and reboot to find your earlier (healthier!)
save game position. The solution to this problem is this: When you
realize that your character has lost a lot of hit points while
within one of those locations, turn off your machine then and there.
Since no writing to the diskette is involved, you can then reboot
and recover your earlier position.
</P>

<H3>THE INHABITANTS</H3>

<P>
In order to gain experience points, valuable items, and gold, you
must slay many creatures. The universe of Ultima II is populated by
Orcs, Devils, Daemons, Thieves, Fighters, Clerics, Wizards, Balrons,
Sea Serpents, Guards, Merchants, Jesters, Seers, Oracles, Kings,
Queens, and, finally, Minax. Some you must simply kill; others you
must not kill but must transact with.
</P>

<P>
Transact with everyone you find in Towns, Villages, and Castles.
Clues to solving the game will be revealed to you (occasionally,
however, you have to offer gold to purchase a particularly valuable
hint or item). In one Town, you will discover that offering gold
results in significant increases to your character's attributes. As
I mentioned earlier, you can obtain more hit points by transacting
with a King (he pockets some of your gold as payment for this
service). Be aware, however, that after 99 your attributes will
roll over to 0! (Rollover occurs as well when any of your
possessions total more than 99 and when your hit points, experience
points, food, or gold climb above 9999). Don't be too greedy!
</P>

<H3>ITEMS</H3>

<P>
Utilize the "Z" (status) command frequently, especially after you
have slain a creature. You will notice that there are certain items
in your inventory which were not there before the battle. You will
learn what each of these items is for (e.g., magical boots save you
from a paralysis spell and tools allow you to escape from traps in
Towers or Dungeons), and will discover which creatures are more
likely to possess something you need.
</P>

<P>
There are a total of 20 objects for you to find, including:
Torches, Keys, Tools, Quick Swords, Wands, Staffs, Boots, Cloaks,
Helms, Gems, Ankhs, Red Gems, Skull Keys, Green Gems, Brass Buttons,
Blue Tassles, Strange Coins, Green Idols, Tri- Lithiums, and Rings.
Once you've obtained a particularly precious item (such as blue
tassles which you'll need to board a frigate or strange coins which
allow you to stop time), be sure to save the game state. Thieves
just love to steal from you, and you may want to recover your
earlier position. You will encounter an individual who claims to
own "one of everything." Offer him gold and find out!
</P>

<H3>TRANSPORTATION</H3>

<P>
You may buy a horse in a Town in order to conserve food as you
travel by land. However, frigates and planes are needed to traverse
the oceans. You will need a rocketship to enter space.
</P>

<P>
Frigates may be boarded (as they pass by you on a coastline) if you
already possess a set of blue tassles. However, planes and rockets
must be stolen. Planes are available in only one Town; you'll need
brass buttons and skull keys in order to fly a plane. Once you have
a plane, you can "walk" it through a Time Door (Time Doors are
discussed in the next file entitled "Ultima II -- Layout").
</P>

<P>
Rockets are found only in one Town and you'll need a number of items
in order to blast off (if you need extra Tri-Lithiums, you can find
hordes of the stuff on the highest level of a Tower or the lowest
level of a Dungeon). Once in space, explore and transact until you
discover the mysterious Planet X and the kindly Father Antos. A
note about spaceflight: Landing is the trickiest part of this task;
be extremely careful that you land on the grass, otherwise you'll be
killed.
</P>

<H3>DEFEATING MINAX</H3>

<P>
Ah, yes, the dread enchantress! She rules time and the universe,
ever so confidently, from her chambers within her Castle on Legends.
Do not attempt to destroy her until you have spent many, many hours
developing your character's abilities and have obtained weapons,
armour, and valuable items. One item in particular, a ring, must be
in your possession if you wish to pass unscathed through Minax's
force fields. She is unwilling to die easily and leads you on a
not-so-merry chase from chamber to chamber while her minions attempt
to kill you. You can deal with her lackeys by stopping time, but
only if you have sufficient quantities of strange coins. Persist in
your attack; she will ultimately succumb and she and all her works
will be destroyed!
</P>

<H2>THE LAYOUT</H2>

<P>
The cloth map and the pamphlet that come with the game are very
helpful. Study both and make your own notes as you continue your
quest. The map shows the world as it appears in the A.D. time
period with symbols representing the 20 Time Doors that exist. The
Time Doors take you from one time period to another, and there are
five such periods: B.C. (1423 B.C.); A.D. (1990 A.D.); Pangea (9
million B.C.); Aftermath (2112 A.D.); and Legends (no time). Once
you obtain a magical helm, you will be able to "V"iew your exact
location (note, however, that your helm disappears when you "V").
The following is an outline of the various time periods and the
locations of their Time Doors.
</P>

<H3>1423 B.C.</H3>

<P>
This is where you begin your adventure. You will find yourself in
Eurasia with connecting passages by land to North America, Africa,
and South America. Locations you'll visit include Towne Linda in
Italy, Le Jester Village in Africa, a Tower in South America, a
Dungeon in Greenland, Lord British's Castle in England, and a
Signpost in Australia (islands may be reached once you board a
frigate).
</P>

England in 1990 A.D.; 2) The North Central Time Door in Europe takes
you to the eastern peninsula in 9 million B.C.; 3) The NE Time Door
in North America takes you to Legends; and 4) The SE Time Door in

</P>

<H3>9 MILLION B.C.</H3>

<P>
In this ancient time, the continents as we know them have not yet
separated. This land mass appears to be one great island. You will
visit Baradin's Town, a Dungeon, and a Signpost.

</P>

<H3>2112 A.D.</H3>

<P>
This is the world of the Aftermath, a time of high technology and
destruction. Nothing remains in North America, South America or
Africa, but there is a Town (Pirate's Harbour) in northern Europe, a
Dungeon in Greenland, and a Signpost in Australia. You will need to
bring an airplane through the Time Doors in order to fly from North
America to Eurasia (where you will find a rocketship). There are 4
Time Doors: 1) In North America, the NW Time Door takes you to
South America in 1990 A.D.; 2) The SE Time Door in North America
takes you to Legends; 3) In Eurasia, the southern Time Door takes
you to the east of the continent in 9 million B.C.; and 4) In
eastern Eurasia, the Time Door takes you to Europe in 1423 B.C.
</P>

<H3>LEGENDS</H3>

<P>
You will visit Legends often in an attempt to break through Minax's
armies and into her sanctum. Her Castle in located in the center of
the continent; besides numerous creatures, there is only a Signpost
on Legends.
</P>

<P>
There are 4 Time Doors in a row south of the Signpost. Starting
from the west: 1) This Time Door takes you to the northeast of the
continent in 9 million B.C.; 2) This one takes you to Europe in 1423
B.C.; 3) This one takes you to England in 1990 A.D.; and 4) The
eastern Time Door takes you to North America in 2112 A.D. [Note:
Dates and Time Door locations may differ in various versions of
Ultima II.]
</P>

<H3>SPACE</H3>

<P>
Use your galactic map to plot the coordinates for space travel. You
will know you have reached the planet you are seeking when you find
Towne Basko and Castle Barataria. Be prepared to fight; the
inhabitants are belligerent and the thieves tend to steal from you.
Remember also to take extreme care in landing your rocket; instant
death results from one careless move. There are no Time Doors in
space.
