<H2>SOLVE</H2>

<P>
Exit inn & a warrior gives you a ball of light & axe. Enter the
storeroom & move the floorboards there. Go down the passage. OK so
now you know what you have to do - more or less. Hit the brick wall
with axe twice.
</P>

<P>
You need to open the gate by unlock the golden padlock with 4 keys.
</P>

<UL>
<LI>Cheez key: You have that. Just don't eat it.

<LI>Gold key: Examine your cheez cutter. Looks like a key ? Dip
it in the gold pool.

<LI>Silver key: The gambler has it. He seems to know your coin is
tails weighted. Put the coin the cheezdom machine. Kick it for a
refund. The new coin is heads weighted. Go ahead & flip.

<LI>Copper key: It's in the chimney. You need a baloon to go up it
or do a bungee jump down it. There is also a crown in the chimney -
time for a bungee leap. Wear the belt found on the skeleton.
Attach the bungee cord to the chimney hook & your belt. Jump. Get
the crown revealing a key which you miss. Remember to drop the cord
after you get the crown. Cover the geyser spout with the cheezdom.
Go NE. This time you grab the key & drop the cheezdom.
</UL>

<P>
Unlock the padlock with all the keys, gold last.
</P>

<P>
Go through the gate area. The bird statue asks for new life. Go
northeast. Someone gives you a backward time travel box. Put the
cooked egg in the box & press the button - raw egg.
</P>

<P>
Put the egg in the nest up a tree in the woods near the inn. Wait
for a bird to come & hatch it. Grab the chick. Go back & show the
chick to the statue - jewelled egg.
</P>

<P>
Go out through the beak. Show the cheez key to the bicorn & it
follows you. Go to the area with the fairy - sieve.
</P>

<P>
Go to southeast and east. Examine the stream here. Something
glistening? Dip the sieve in water - pyrite.
</P>

<P>
Still short of 2 valmids? Give your pillow to the idling Valley
Patrol - coin.
</P>

<P>
Give all your valuable stuff to the innkeeper.
