<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Fantasy role playing. Defeat the evil wizard, using navigational
strategies and ship-to-ship combat. Advanced dungeon graphics and
full color visuals. One to four players and roster of up to 20
characters.
</P>

<H2>STRATEGY</H2>

<P>
Lord British's "Ultima III: Exodus" is the third, and most
ambitious, offering in an outstanding fantasy role-playing series.
Every aspect of this game, from the documentation to the computer
graphics, is a logical, yet enhanced, extension of the earlier two
chapters of the "Ultima" saga. In "Exodus," however, there is a
fundamental new twist: No longer must a solitary character strive
to overcome the evil abroad in the land; a party of up to four
players may join the quest.
</P>

<H3>CREATING A PARTY</H3>

<P>
Start out by thoroughly studying the four booklets that come with
the game: The Book of Play, the Ancient Liturgy of Truth, the Book
of Amber Runes, and the Player Reference Card. You must then form a
party by designating race and profession and by allocating 50 points
among four attributes. Each profession has different valuable
characteristics, and part of this game's flexibility is that you may
try various combinations.
</P>

<P>
Perhaps the best initial party will be composed of an elf thief, a
dwarf fighter, a bobbit cleric, and a fuzzy wizard. A dwarf or
bobbit paladin, or a human ranger, may easily be substituted for the
dwarf fighter. It is certainly desirable to include both a cleric
and a wizard in your group because only they have the capacity to
develope advanced spell-casting powers.
</P>

<P>
In combat situations, each party member takes a turn in order.
Therefore, it is important to position the characters in such a way
as to take advantage of their particular abilities. Generally,
characters who have more weapon/armour options should be in first
and second place; the spell casters should be in the next rank. I
had very good luck with "Snatch" (elf thief) and "Devo" (dwarf
fighter) in the front, with "Wanda" (fuzzy wizard) and "Clarissa"
(bobbit cleric) in the rear. Since combat may seem too fast and
confusing at first, it may help you to give your characters mnemonic
names.
</P>

<H3>JOURNEYING ONWARD</H3>

<P>
Your little band begins its adventure near the castle and city of
Lord British on the grassy plains of the continent of Sosaria.
Immediately equip your characters with daggers and cloth armour.
Then, save the game. Frequent "saves" will help you to avoid
getting stuck with a group of dead bodies on your hands; if disaster
seems imminent, you can turn off your machine and restore your
previous game position.
</P>

<P>
Enter the town, where it is safe. Examining the player roster, you
will see that each party member possesses 150 gold pieces and 150
items of food. You should transfer extra gold to one character,
preferably a fighter type, so that he may purchase a bow.
Long-range weapons such as bows and slings are vital to surviving
combat. Of course, daggers may be thrown, but they are then lost;
it is useful to obtain an abundant supply. Remember to re-ready
and/or re-equip a player who transacts with merchants or you might
find a character with a bow and leather armour in her inventory
standing naked and empty-handed against eight Ttitans! It goes
without saying that your group must have adequate supplies of food.
</P>

<P>
Any player may attempt to steal from the gold-laden chests that are
located in weapons and armour shops; however, thieves have the most
success. Lower level characters haven't a prayer against guards, so
larceny is a risky endeavour. It is not possible to steal food in
this game; however, chests occasionally contain a valuable weapon or
item of armour. If you wish to steal with impunity, you can bribe
guards. Greasing guards' palms causes them to instantly disappear.
</P>

<P>
Gold, money, crass lucre: You will need copious amounts to advance
in "Ultima III." Sometimes you'll think it's money that makes
Sosaria go 'round! Although many of the clues vital to winning the
game may be freely obtained by transacting with people in towns and
castles, gold is needed to purchase not only important information
from barkeeps and oracles, but is also necessary in order to raise
your players' attributes, equip them with better weapons and armour,
and bribe guards. You may wish to create several "sacrificial"
characters whose sole purpose is to transfer all their gold,
weapons, food, and armour to one of your "real" party members.
Using this admittedly opportunistic technique, your "real" party can
become well-equipped even before its first foray.
</P>

<P>
A note about "roll over": Lord British has almost completely
corrected the problem (from "Ultima II") of players' "numbers"
rolling over to zero after 99 or 9999. Now, if you inadvertently
purchase more than 99 daggers, only 99 will show up (not 0) on the
status report. The same holds true for other equipment and players'
attributes. However, a bug remains in the food counter. Be careful
not to exceed 9999 items of food or very strange things will happen
to your players' names and armour. [Note: Rollover still occurs in
some versions.].
</P>

<H3>THE INHABITANTS OF SOSARIA</H3>

<P>
Within the towns or Lord British's castle, you will encounter
guards, merchants, barkeeps, jesters, oracles, or healers as well as
any of the regular player types such as fighters, thieves, clerics
and wizards. You must transact with almost everyone you meet in
order to learn the clues which are vital to winning this game.
Carefully explore every inch of every town; you can locate
informative individuals behind shops, within wooded areas, or on the
other side of locked doors. [See the "Layout" and "Clues" files for
more specific details.]
</P>

<H3>COMBAT</H3>

<P>
Much of your time, especially in the beginning stages of the game,
will be devoted to slaying monsters. On land, in the sea, and deep
within the dungeons of Sosaria your party will engage in combat with
more than two dozen species of monsters as well as renegade player
types. Examine your Book of Play for the descriptions of these
creatures.
</P>

<P>
Some monsters (orcs, goblins, and trolls) may be dispelled by your
wizard's "Repond." The undead creatures (skeletons, ghouls, zombies)
are turned by your cleric's "Pontori." When your cleric or mage
reaches his or her full potential, he or she (or "O"!) can cast
helpful (transport, light, heal, cure, map, resurrect) or
devastating (wound, negate time, destroy) spells. However, since
spell casting temporarily drains magic points, most combat involves
the use of weapons. Be aware that a cleric's use of the "P"
(Resurrect from Ashes) spell drains wisdom points.
</P>

<P>
The weapons available range from daggers to +4 bows (6550 g.p.) to
the mysterious "exotics." Naturally, as your players gain strength,
one arrow may be all that is needed to dispatch the dread balron.
Long-range weapons should, therefore, be obtained as soon as
possible. Since your party always gets to fire the first shot in a
combat situation, slings or bows can mean the difference between
life and death. Hand-to-hand weapons are relatively ineffective
because your players have to waste turns moving toward the enemy and
taking hits instead of fighting. Since daggers may be thrown, they
are more versatile than maces. The same is true regarding the use
of bows as opposed to swords. The ranger I created was more
successful and efficient with his simple bow than a +2 sword.
</P>

<P>
Armour is, of course, vital in protecting your players from injury.
Depending on their professions, characters may wear anything from
cloth to +2 plate (8250 g.p.). Try to obtain leather armour, at
least, for those players who may wear it; they will survive more
easily and will rapidly advance in experience levels.
</P>

<P>
Players' hit points are directly related to their experience. Each
character begins with 150 hit points at level one. As the game
proceeds and your players slay numerous monsters, their experience
points will increase. Remember, however, that only the character
striking the death blow wins experience points! As additional
levels are reached, the party should visit Lord British who will see
that his wizard raises the characters' hit points. However, after
level five, the Lord will refuse to raise the hit maximum. Instead,
he says: "Seek ye the Mark of Kings." Once your group obtains this
mark (one of four available -- each with a different purpose), Lord
British will raise your characters' hit points, according to his or
her experience level, to the absolute maximum of 2550.
</P>

<P>
If you want to build up backward players' hit points, you must
position them so that they may inflict the fatal blows. This may
even involve passing over (by hitting the space bar) a couple of
players in favour of your "slower" ones.
</P>

<P>
After your players reach level five or so, and have purchased decent
weapons, armour and, hopefully, a few powders (to negate time), they
may use the following procedure to rapidly build up more experience
points: Enter a town that has only two sets of guards stationed at
the entrance; attack and kill the guards; immediately leave the town
and save the game. Guards are worth 15 experience points each, and,
although they are extremely powerful, they don't throw fireballs or
poisoned bolts at your group.
</P>

<P>
While your party is still relatively inexperienced, try to avoid sea
serpents, men-o-war, and pirates. You can usually see these
opponents approaching, and can detour around them. Do not descend
below level four or so in any dungeon until your party is quite
strong; otherwise, the manes, devils, and wyverns, among others,
will surely decimate your group. Several monsters not only wound
your players, but poison them. However, when your party is healthy
and well-equipped, it can win thousands of experience points and
gold pieces by slaying these creatures. In the case of pirates,
your group can also commandeer a frigate; no experience points or
treasure is gained if the ship's cannons are used in battle.
</P>

<P>
Before your group obtains long-range weapons, try to avoid thieves,
cutpurses, and brigands. These characters love to steal the weapons
or armour that are not currently in use by players.
</P>

<P>
Within dungeons, the invisible gremlins like to steal food. Be sure
to carry plenty of rations or your band might starve to death!
</P>

<P>
Here is a list of various opponents and the experience points
received by players when they defeat these creatures:
</P>

<P>
01 = Merchants<BR>
02 = Jesters and Grasss<BR>
03 = Goblins, Trolls, Orcs, and Floors<BR>
04 = Skeletons, Zombies, and Ghouls<BR>
05 = Cutpurses, Brigands, and Thieves<BR>
06 = Golems, Giants, Titans, and Horses<BR>
08 = Fighters, Manes, Gargoyles, and Daemons<BR>
10 = Wizards, Pincers, and Bradles<BR>
15 = Serpents, Dragons, Griffons, Wyverns, and Guards<BR>
20 = Men-O-War, Orcuss, Devils, and Balrons<BR>
</P>

<P>
The tougher the enemy, the more experience points gained by your
players.
</P>

<P>
NOTE: Do not try to engage Lord British in battle; he is
invincible. He will allow you to take the chests behind the force
field, but will attack if you initiate violence within his domain.
</P>

<H3>HEALING</H3>

<P>
The natural result of all this fighting is injured, or even
deceased, party members. Be sure that you carefully map Sosaria,
pinpointing the locations of healing kiosks. Your group will have
to visit the healers frequently, especially if a character is
poisoned. As always, gold works wonders.
</P>

<P>
Of course, clerics as well as advanced wizards may cast healing
spells. Use their powers with discrimination since every spell
drains magic points which may be needed for an unexpected battle.
</P>

<P>
Healing fountains are located inside dungeons. A drink from one
will restore your players' lost hit points. You cannot tell whether
a fountain is healthy or poisoned without testing it. There are
four types of fountains: good, innocuous, harmful, and poisonous.
Save your game before descending into a dungeon and be careful!
</P>

<H3>TRANSPORTATION</H3>

<P>
There are three modes of transportation in this game: foot, horse,
and frigate. Most of the time, your players will be on foot and
their food supplies will diminish rapidly as they explore Sosaria.
Obtaining a horse not only slows the decrease in food, but allows
your party to out run monsters. There are only two places where
horses may be purchased or stolen: in the City of Dawn or the City
of Devil Guard. [Check the "Layout" file for the locations of these
cities.] Horses may be ridden through moon gates.
</P>

<P>
Frigates may be commandeered by defeating a pirate crew. Once you
have a frigate, your party may then traverse the seas, visiting
important islands and learning the secret of the whirlpool.
</P>

<P>
The whirlpool is both beneficial and harmful. It may destroy ships
that are docked and empty. Yet, by sailing into the whirlpool, your
party will be transported to the Lost Continent of Ambrosia where
the players will be able to raise their attributes and obtain the
four cards needed to destroy Exodus.
</P>

<H3>ITEMS</H3>

<P>
There are four valuable items which your players must purchase in
order to win the game. These are: torches, keys, gems, and
powders. Only in thieves' guilds can your party buy these special
items [check the "Layout" file for locations].
</P>

<P>
Torches, of course, are needed for light while the party explores
dungeons. Because of the prevalence of "strange wind" throughout
all of the dungeons, numerous torches should be carried.
</P>

<P>
Keys are used to unlock doors. They are particularly useful in Lord
British's Castle, the City of Montor West, and Ambrosia.
</P>

<P>
Gems give you a bird's eye view of your current location. Buy as
many gems as possible; you can use them to map dungeons, explore the
nooks and crannies of cities, and proceed effortlessly through
mazes.
</P>

<P>
Powders are, perhaps, the most valuable objects of all: They stop
time. Use powders frequently during fierce battles, especially in
the Castle of Death [Note: This may not work in some versions].
The incessant fireballs, though, are not affected by powders.
</P>

<H3>DUNGEONS</H3>

<P>
Unlike in "Ultima II," your group must explore all the dungeons in
order to win this game. Four "marks" must be obtained by each party
member. Marks are usually located in a wall on the 8th level of a
dungeon. The Mark of Kings is needed before Lord British will raise
the characters' hit maximum above 550; the Mark of Force is used to
pass uninjured through force fields; the Mark of Fire allows the
party to walk through fire; the Mark of the Snake is needed to
bypass the Silver Snake which guards the Castle of Death.
</P>

<P>
The best dungeon strategy is to use plenty of gems to locate ladders
and/or cast ladder up and ladder down spells. It is not wise to
linger on the upper levels if your group is simply looking for
marks. Enter the dungeon and descend, as quickly as possible, to
level 8. Then, obtain the mark and exit the dungeon. Of course, it
is helpful to explore all levels of all dungeons, but this can be
fatal if your party is weak.
</P>

<H3>MOON GATES</H3>

<P>
Ah, these mysterious and ephemeral portals! What is their secret?
By stepping into a moon gate, your group will be transported to
various locations, some of which are inaccessible by any other
means. There are eight moon gates, and the most important is,
perhaps, the one that delivers your players to the dungeon of the
Time Lord. Experiment with different gates and note their
locations, the timing of their appearances, and their destinations.
</P>

<P>
An understanding of the cycles of the two moons of Sosaria,
displayed on the cloth map and constantly counted on your screen, is
vital in your search for the legendary City of Dawn. [See the
"Layout" file for more details.]
</P>

<H3>DEFEATING EXODUS</H3>

<P>
Who or what is Exodus? The product of an unholy alliance between
Mondain and Minax, Exodus is more machine than monster. Could he or
it be a computer? Perhaps so: Exodus' powers are legion and he is
"turned off" by inserting four cards, in proper order, into slots in
his "body." The Time Lord, if he will, can tell your party the
proper order of the cards.
</P>

<P>
Do not attempt to destroy Exodus until your party is extremely
strong. Located within the aptly named Castle of Death, Exodus is
protected by an army of fiends as well as a continuous stream of
fireballs. Further, the usual weapons are ineffectual against
monsters in this castle; your group must be equipped with "exotic
arms" in order to slay these creatures in hand-to-hand combat.
</P>

<P>
After your little band battles its way to Exodus, it must conquer
the strange and invisible floors. The floors repeatedly attack
until they have been completely destroyed. The best strategy
against the floors is to have your cleric cast his "O" spell and/or
your wizard cast her "P" spell. Then, move forward step-by-step,
attacking in all directions. The floors are difficult, but
certainly not impossible to overcome.
</P>

<P>
A final note: If you try to leave the Castle of Death without
destroying Exodus, or if you linger near the entrance, your players
will have to battle the grasss. The same strategy should be used
against grasss as is used in combat with floors.
</P>

<H2>LAYOUT</H2>

<H3>THE CLOTH MAP</H3>

<P>
The map that is supplied with the game is very useful, especially if
you take out a sturdy black pen and mark locations on it. I used
triangles to designate castles, squares to represent towns, circles
for dungeons, and squiggly lines for moon gates. The map shows the
continent of Sosaria as explored by the late, great Hawkwind. Your
party will exceed even his accomplishments before the game is over.
</P>

<P>
Also displayed on the map are a series of drawings of various
locations as well as representations of the cycles of the two
Sosarian moons. The runes are not difficult to decipher. For
example, on the top left is a picture of the Castle of Lord British.
On the top right is Death Gulch. The moon of Trammel has a 48 day
cycle, and the moon of Felucca has a 16 day cycle.
</P>

<H3>THE CITIES</H3>

<P>
Here is a list of the cities of Sosaria, their locations, and their
important features:
</P>

<OL>
<LI>CITY OF LORD BRITISH: Located to the northeast of Sosaria, this
city overlooks a harbour. Within the town you will find a pub, a
grocery, a weapons shop, and an armoury. As always, be sure to
transact with everyone you meet.

<LI>MONTOR WEST: South of Lord British are the twin cities of Montor
West and Montor East. In the western town you will find a grocery,
two pubs, a weapons shop, an armoury, a prison, and four guard
stations. It is important to speak to two thieves who are inside
prison cells. Either bribe the many guards or be prepared for a
series of long battles if you enter the prison.

<LI>MONTOR EAST: Again, you will visit a pub, an armoury, and a
weapons shop. Guard stations abound, but you need not do battle in
this town. Simply transact with all the player types you meet;
valuable clues are to be had here.

<LI>CITY OF YEW: Within this holy city are dozens of clerics as well
as the Circle of Light, Rogation Worship, Sanescere healing kiosk,
and the Aliment food shop. Take care in this heavily forested town
else you might stumble into a wall of fire. The City of Yew is
located in mountains to the west of Lord British.

<LI>CITY OF MOON: Further west from Yew lies Moon. Moon may also be
reached by travelling southeast from Montor East. This small town
contains a grocery, a pub, and a healing stand. The forested areas
should be carefully explored for hidden clues; avoid those balrons,
though!

<LI>CITY OF GREY: Due south of Moon, on a southwestern tip of
Sosaria, you will find the City of Grey. This town has a pub, a
grocery, a weapons shop, an armoury, a thieves' guild, and a chamber
containing chests. Vital clues are to be had from a thief, a
fighter, and a cleric. Be sure to visit Grey often in order to
stock up on gems, powders, torches, and keys from the guild.

<LI>DEATH GULCH: Off the coast, on a large island to the southeast of
British, is Death Gulch. This town is heavily guarded, but violence
can be avoided. Here you will find a pub, grocery, weapons, and
armour. The daemon and guard at the front entrance may be
cautiously bypassed in order to enter the town. Bring keys. You
can also sneak into Death Gulch through the forested areas to the
north and south of the entrance. This town has several mazes, force
fields, and a river of fire. None is of much importance. Lots of
chests here.

<LI>CITY OF FAWN: On a small island off the coast of Sosaria, to the
northwest of British, is the City of Fawn. Here you will find a
pub, a food shop, a healing kiosk, and a thieves' guild. Four
clerics will impart significant clues.

<LI>DEVIL GUARD: This town is locked within mountains to the
southwest of British. To reach Devil Guard, your party must take
one of three moon gates [discussed below]. A pirates' frigate,
firing from the shore of a small lake with no outlets, attacks your
group when you visit this town. Devil Guard is a dangerous place,
but a very important one. Here, there are six fighters and one
thief who can give you winning clues. Devil Guard contains a pub
and grocery, a healing stand, another thieves' guild, and a stables.
You may purchase four horses here for 800 g.p.; they cannot be
stolen.

<LI>CITY OF DAWN: Dawn, the city of myths and magic! It is located,
for a brief moment only, in the forest southwest of British. Dawn
possesses the usual line-up of shops: food, pub, weapons, and
armour. However, you will also find another thieves' guild here as
well as an oracle and stables. Both the weapons and armour shops
sell advanced items. Bring thousands of gold pieces and your party
will leave Dawn very well-equipped. Horses here may be stolen, but
expect a series of battles with Dawn's many guards. There are three
clerics, hiding in the southeast corner of the town, who can tell
you much about "exotic arms." However, two of the clerics will not
let your party pass in order to transact with the third; you will
have to kill them. Prepare your group by bribing as many guards as
possible before dealing with the clerics.
</OL>

<H3>THE CASTLES</H3>

<P>
There are two castles in this game: Lord British and Death. Lord
British's Castle is next to his city. You will visit the castle
many times in order to transact with the Lord and to purchase cures
or healings. Most of the areas in this castle are unimportant;
however, by using keys to unlock doors, you can locate several
individuals who have important knowledge about your quest. In
particular, explore the prison, the winding corridors, and the
exterior of the castle.
</P>

<P>
The Castle of Death is the domain of Exodus. It is located on an
island off the southwest coast of Sosaria. Reach it by sailing past
the Silver Snake (be sure to bring horses with you!). If you
survive the dangers, you will find Exodus in a chamber against the
northern wall.
</P>

<H3>THE DUNGEONS</H3>

<P>
Only in dungeons may "marks" be found. Dungeons are hazardous
places. Not only do they house an abundance of vicious creatures,
but there are traps, gremlins, strange winds, poisoned fountains,
mazes, and dead ends. Here is a list of the dungeons of Sosaria,
their locations, and their important features:
</P>

<OL>
<LI>PERINIAN DEPTHS: This dungeon is located to the northeast of the
City of Lord British. There are two Marks of Kings on the lst
level, and another on the 8th level. A Mark of Fire may be found on
the 8th level as well. There is a healing fountain in the
southwestern corner of the 8th level.

<LI>DARDIN'S PIT: To the northwest of British is Dardin's Pit. The
Mark of Kings may be found in two locations on level 8.

<LI>FIRES OF HELL: Surrounded by fire, this dungeon is located in
mountains to the southeast of British. The Mark of Force and the
Mark of Fire are on the 8th level. There are also four fountains on
level 8, one of each type.

<LI>DOOM: Southwest of British, in a heavily forested area, is the
Dungeon of Doom. In the centre of level 8, you will find the Mark
of Force. All four types of fountains are on level 8 as well.

<LI>MINES OF MORINIA: North of the City of Grey, on the west coast of
Sosaria, are the Mines. The Mark of Kings is located on level 3 and
on level 8. Also on level 8 is the Mark of Fire. Your party will
use transport and ladder spells often in an effort to fully explore
this dungeon.

<LI>SNAKE: On an island off the southeast coast of Sosaria is the
Dungeon of the Snake. Important clues are to be had on levels 2 and
3. There are two healing fountains on level 6 and one healing
fountain on level 7. Both the Mark of Kings and the Mark of the
Snake are located on level 8.

<LI>TIME: This dungeon is completely surrounded by impenetrable
mountains and may only be reached via moon gates [discussed below].
There are two healing fountains on level 1, another on level 4, and
another on level 8. The Mark of Kings may be found on level 2 and
on level 8. Most importantly, the Time Lord himself resides on
level 8. Listen carfully to what he says.
</OL>

<H3>THE FORGOTTEN LAND: AMBROSIA</H3>

<P>
In order to raise your players' attributes and to obtain the cards
needed to defeat Exodus, your group must pass through the whirlpool
to a submerged continent. There are four shrines located on
Ambrosia: Dexterity (southeast), Wisdom (northeast), Intelligence
(northwest), and Strength (southwest).
</P>

<P>
Use gems to map this continent; the many mazes can be quite
confusing. Also, keys are needed to unlock several different doors.
Be sure to bring lots of gold!
</P>

<P>
Commandeer frigates from the pirates you encounter; you will need to
cross water to reach two of the shrines. The game cannot be "saved"
while you are visiting Ambrosia, but you can sail back into the
whirlpool to return to Sosaria.
</P>

<H3>MOON GATES</H3>

<P>
There are eight of these mysterious portals scattered throughout
Sosaria. Depending upon the phases of the twin moons, the
shimmering gates will teleport your party to various different
locations. Here is a list of the locations of the moon gates, the
phases of the moons when the gates appear, and their destinations:

<H2>CLUES FOR THE DESPERATE!</H2>

<H3>BARTENDERS' CLUES</H3>

<P>
In most cities, your group will visit pubs. Transacting with a
bartender, and payment of copious sums of gold, causes this little
tale to unfold:
</P>

<P>
"Ambrosia. Ever hear of it? Dawn City of Myths and Magic! The
conjunction of the moons finds a link! Nasty creatures, nasty dark,
sure thee ready, fore thee embark. None return so I'm told, from
the pool, dark and cold. Shrines of knowledge, shrines of strength,
all are lost into the brink. Fountains fair and fountains foul, all
are found in dungeons bowel.

the Lord of Time, and the one way is a sure find!"

"And so the sage said unto thee: If thou can solve my rhyme, you'll
learn of marks and playing cards and hidden holy shrines. Of marks
I say there are but 4, of Fire, Force, Snake, and King. Learn their
use in Devil Guard or death you'll surely bring. Shrines there are
again but 4, to which you go and pray. Their uses are innumerable
and clues throughout I say. The cards their suits do number 4,
called Sol, Moon, Death, and Love. Unto the Montors thou must go
for guidance from above. To aid thee in thy cryptic search, to
dungeons thou must fare. There seek out the Lord of Time to help
you if he cares."
