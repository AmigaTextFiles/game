<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Over four man-years in the making. Ultima V is the latest in the
saga. Takes place in the extraordinary realm of Britannia, and
features all new magic and combat systems. Lord British, benevolent
sovereign of Britannia, has been lost on an expedition to explore
the newly discovered underworld. Blackthorn has assumed the throne
and imposed martial law to keep peace, but he is soon seduced by
power and becomes a tyrannical dictator. Only you, the Avatar of
Legend, can save the true King and end Blackthorn's reign of terror.
Full-length music soundtrack.
</P>

<H2>STRATEGY</H2>

<P>
The cluster of locations around Britanny Bay is probably the best
place to start. Talk to everyone you meet for clues. Go out at
night for monster-hunting, but not far from the towns - retreat to a
town if you're in danger of getting killed. Look for Mantras and
Words of Power. When your group attains third or fourth level,
explore dungeons for loot. Buy ships, get a grapple, sextant, Black
Badge, Spy-Glass, lots of Skull Keys and the Magic Carpet. Stock up
on Mandrake Root, Nightshade and other reagents. Use the Black
Badge and get the Crown and Word Of Power from the prisoner.
</P>

<P>
While seeking one of the Shards, get the Mystic Armour. Get all the
Shards and names of the Shadowlords. Learn what to do with the
Shards. Destroy the Shadowlords and find their Keep. Get the
Sceptre and Amulet. Complete all the Shrine Quests if you haven't
already. Get the Sandalwood Box and stock up on supplies. Rescue
Lord British.
</P>

<H3>CHARACTER CREATION AND DEVELOPMENT</H3>

<P>
The keys to character development lie in the Shrines and in living
up to the virtues. Don't take food or crops, kill innocent people
or do other 'unAvatarish' acts that will cost you points in a
related Virtue and inhibit some characters from giving you clues.
To boost Compassion, give one piece of gold to Beggars. Never lie
or boast (say no when asked if you're proud of something, unless
asked if you are the most humble). To boost Karma, complete a
Shrine Quest, then return to that Shrine and give gold. People who
will join the party are mentioned in the "TOWNES, CASTLES & KEEPS"
section and in the TABLES. Release prisoners in Blackthorn or Yew.
</P>

<H3>COMBAT & MAGIC</H3>

<P>
Slings and Bows will serve you well until you get Magic Axes. You
can equip with more than one weapon, such as a Magic Axe and a Short
Sword. A Bow is good until you get a Magic Axe. Don't forget you
can fire missile weapons diagonally this time. Use them until the
enemy is within arm's reach. Step back as the enemy approaches, and
they'll move into better positions for you to hit them. Line your
team up in a pair of columns, keeping missile weapons and Mages in
the back.
</P>

<H3>GENERAL INFORMATION</H3>

<P>
You will be able to reach most places by foot, horse or Magic
Carpet. The In Por spell and the Grapple are essential for
travelling, especially when seeking the Shards. The exceptions will
require a ship or travel by Moongates. Avoid entering a location
when Shadowlords are present. (You will get an audible warning;
also, the trees will be bare of foiliage and the inhabitants will be
reluctant to converse with you. By using a telescope at night, you
can see the location of the Shadowlords). Some locations have
locked doors or moats preventing entry during the night. You may
have to wait until daylight, cross moats on the Magic Carpet, or
find secret entrances. Inhabitants follow certain routines and will
sleep, open or close shops, have lunch and so on only during certain
hours. Generally it is best to "hole up" outside until morning.
This also gives you an opportunity to revitalize spell points, heal
and sometimes be visited by Lord British, who may reward you or
caution you to follow a certain path to meet your goals.
</P>

<P>
Barkeeps will give you useful clues for a price. If short of cash,
save the game before you bribe a Barkeep; get the information, then
restore game. This may not seem 'Avatarish', but in the early
stages of the adventure you must be prudent at times! Secret doors
are marked with white dots in the walls, but these are sometimes
hard to see. A ship is needed to reach some places; consult the map
before setting out for a new location to see if this is the case.
</P>

<H3>LORD BRITISH'S CASTLE</H3>

<P>
This castle has five levels: four above ground and one below. Like
most locations, it can be plotted on a 32 x 32 grid. On the Ground
Level (near the stable), talk to Treanna. You may find items by
searching the level below, where you will find an Armoury and items
to be picked up by searching (but DON'T fight any Guards here!).
And don't take anything from the locked room down there, since it
belongs to Lord British. On one level above you may find an "orb"
with which you may view the floor the way you would with a gem.
</P>

<P>
On the second level above you will find Lord British's quarters (use
a Skull Key to enter, or blow the door off with a cannon). Here
lies the Magic Carpet at the entrance and a secret door that opens
if you play the harpsichord. The secret door permits you to obtain
the Sandalwood Box. (DO NOT SAVE THE GAME HERE!!). You may also
meet Saduj, who may offer to join you. (DON'T let him - he may
cause you to lose the Sandalwood Box). In this room you can also go
through the fireplace to a secret place. Going through fireplaces
costs you hit points so be sure you can take a few hits coming and
going. The stairway in Lord British's quarters leads to an
Observatory with a telescope. Don't go to the roof unless you have
Skull Keys.
</P>

<H3>BRITTAIN</H3>

<P>
The Towne of Compassion has an Inn and an Armoury. There are
sleeping quarters, terrace and a balcony on the upper floors. Talk
to Anon, Greyson, Terrance and Guenno.
</P>

<H3>EAST BRITTANY</H3>

<P>
Here there is a Healer and a Shipwright. Plans for the HMS Cape,
which permit faster sailing aboard frigates, are in one of the
drawers in the Shipwright's Quarters.
</P>

<H3>NORTH BRITTANY</H3>

<P>
There is an Inn, a Stable and a small garden. A little north of the
entrance is a tree stump with three gems. Talk to Joshua and Leof.
</P>

<H3>WEST BRITTANY</H3>

<P>
Here you will find two gardens, a Tavern and a Graveyard. The
gravestones have humorous epitaphs if you have the patience to
decipher them. Some graves yield corpses and loot if searched.
</P>

<H3>BLACKTHORN'S PALACE</H3>

<P>
Located on an island west of the southern tip of the Isle of the
Avatar, the palace is surrounded by a moat. You must be equipped
with the Magic Carpet to avoid some of the trap doors inside. Hug
the walls when going through the palace, because the traps are
normally centered away from the walls. If captured by guards you
will be taken to Blackthorn, asked to reveal the Mantra of a Shrine
and whether you do or don't, the second man in your party will be
tortured and killed. It is best to avoid detection. There are
three levels above and a basement level from the ground floor. On
the top level in the centre of the grid you will find the Crown of
Lord British. When worn, it protects you from magic spells. You
can avoid being captured by knowing the password and wearing the
Black Badge. If captured after obtaining the Crown, you can escape
in the following manner: In the dead of night, go to the down
ladder at the northern central part of the Top Level. Go down to
the bedroom and south to the wall and search for the secret door.
Take the down ladder on the other side of the door, then search
north for another secret door. Take the down ladder on the other
side of the door and you will be on the Main Level. Go directly
north through the triple doors, and the Magic Carpet will get you
over the stream.
</P>

<H3>BORDERMARCH</H3>

<P>
On the Upper Level, you will meet Dupre and Sentri, a pair of
Fighters you should chat up. Talk to Sir Simon and Tessa for
valuable information; an Armoury is available.
</P>

<H3>BUCCANEER'S DEN</H3>

<P>
This location has a Guild, Armoury, an Inn, a Tavern and a
Shipwright. Talk to Scally. You meet Geoffrey, an old friend who
wants to join you. Sven gives a clue on where to obtain a glass
sword. (It's a powerful weapon but disintegrates when used, so it
may not be worth searching for). You can get information on a
grapple for a drink for a woman.
</P>

<H3>COVE</H3>

<P>
Cove is southeast of Locklake and may be reached from there. You
may purchase reagents and obtain healing here. Speak to the Sisters
of Virtue about Tibse. Ambrose (around midnight at the Healers)
will speak to you of the Mystic Arms.
</P>

<H3>HUT IN DESERT</H3>

<P>
Talk to Sin'Vraal for the name of a Shadowlord.
</P>

<H3>EMPATH ABBEY</H3>

balcony with the Flame of Love. Toshi, a student will offer to join
you. Talk to Tim. Converse with Lord Michael (and say 'grapple').
Cory will give free food if you ask for 'squid' or 'shark'. Julia
offers to join you. The third level is just a walk around the
perimeter where you may find Tim at times.
</P>

<H3>FARTHING</H3>

<P>
In Farthing you may learn a spell from Temme and get a spyglass from
Lord Seggallion if you answer "VIRTUE". Talk to Quintin.
</P>

<H3>FOGSBANE</H3>

<P>
This is the lighthouse on the island just south of Brittain. Jotham
will speak of the Underworld.
</P>

<H3>GREYHAVEN</H3>

<P>
This lighthouse is on a peninsula South of Trinsic. Here you will
find Sir Arbuthnot, the royal coinmaker. David the Keeper will
provide you with a sextant when you ask about it. Talk to Lord
Kenneth, who will teach you to play the harpsichord. Be sure to
search, for you will find five gems, 50GP and a blue potion.
</P>

<H3>HUT ON ISLAND AT NA LA</H3>

<P>
Just a small hut and a graveyard occupy this small island. At
9:00am, a young mage, Sutek, arises and reveals the secret of
destroying the Shadowlords. Check out the small graveyard for
messages.
</P>

<H3>JHELOM</H3>

<P>
There are two levels, the second consisting mainly of sleeping
quarters. The first level has an Inn, a Tavern, an Armoury and a
Shipwright. You may obtain a magic axe outside the walls to the
East, but must first find the secret door in the Northeast section
on the main level. Talk to Thorne and the bewildered Mage who
speaks and responds to "backward" words. (Ask for a "Word of
Power", but spell it backwards - "Drow of Rewop", then say
"Dratsed"). Searching will net you food, torches and a scroll.
</P>

<H3>THE LYCAEUM</H3>

<P>
This Keep houses the Flame of Truth and has three levels. On the
first level is a stable. She also tells how to find a Shrine. On
the second level, talk to Mariah in the Healer's Room during the
day. There is a Library and a Tavern. Talk to Lady Janell, Rollo
and Lord Shalineth. The third level has a Healer and the Flame of

Some buildings on Minoc have second levels with sleeping quarters
and items if you search for them. The ground level has a Healer
(who does not charge for her services), a Shipwright and an Armoury.

find keys. Rew reveals a Mantra and more useful information. Talk
to Tactus, Fenelon and Fiona.

<P>
The towne of Spirituality has a drawbridge that is raised at
midnight. Here you will find an Inn, a Healer and a Shop selling
reagents. Kindor reveals a Mantra. Talk to Saul about Mandrake and
Nightshade. A wizard on the upper floor of the centre building
(after you defeat the bats) will answer to the word "OPPRESSION".
If you provide him with a name he will send you to Windmere to see
Elistaria and give you the password. Find and talk to the child in
town, son of a prisoner in Yew.
</P>

<H3>STONEGATE</H3>

<P>
See the paragraph on the SHADOWLORDS & THE SCEPTRE.
</P>

<H3>STORMCROW</H3>

<P>
A lighthouse located Southwest of Minoc, this has three levels and
two inhabitants. Information is scarce, but try anyway.
</P>

<H3>TRINSIC</H3>

<P>
On the upper level you will find sleepwalkers. Sindar gives a Word
of Power. There is a Stable, a Healer and an Armoury.
</P>

<H3>WAVEGUIDE</H3>

<P>
A three-level lighthouse off the West coast of Verity Isle, this may
not yield any information.
</P>

<H3>WINDMERE</H3>

<P>
Elistaria, in response to "IMPERA", gives you a badge that, if worn,
helps you in Blackthorn's Palace. She also says Thrud will provide
you with jewelled weapons for the resistance password.
</P>

<H3>YEW</H3>

<P>
The towne of Justice closes it's gates at night. Search the
cemetery graves for items. There is a Tavern, an Armoury and a
Reagent shop on the ground level and quarters on the lower level.
Janna will offer to join you. Ask Landon about the Crown. To reach
the lower level, go through one of the fireplaces. Chamfort will
tell you of resistance and a Mantra. If jailed, you will be taken
to the cells behind Judge Dryden's office and should talk with
Jerome. In another cell you will meet Felespar. Give him the
password of the resistance, and he'll give you a Word of Power. Ask
Judge Dryden of the oppression. Tell him Tactus of Minoc sent you.
Tell Greymarch that Froed is well, and he tells of the Sceptre.
</P>

<H3>VANQUISHING THE SHADOWLORDS</H3>

<P>
You may be able to defeat the Shadowlords in battle, but they will
return unless you get rid of them permanently. To accomplish this
you must first learn their names, obtain the Shards of Cowardice,
Falsehood and Hatred from the Underworld, and finally destroy them
at the Flames of Courage, Truth and Love. At the flames you must
yell their names and, when they stand in the flames, use the Shards
to destroy them. The Lords of the three locations of the Flames
will reveal to you the names of the Shadowlords. Use each Shard in
the Flame of the opposite alignment. The Shadowlord must be
standing on or in the Flame, positioned so he's due North of your
character and his icon is covering the Flame's icon.
</P>

<H4>THE SCEPTRE</H4>

<P>
Do not attempt to acquire the Sceptre until you have eliminated the
Shadowlords. Stonegate, the Shadowlord's fortress, is located at EK
JE. Just North of the Sceptre is a trap-door that leads to certain
death; equip the Magic Carpet before entering. A leather-winged
abomination guards the entrance. The answer to his riddle is "WELL"
but even if you answer correctly, he will still attack you.
</P>

<H3>OBTAINING THE SHARDS</H3>

<P>
The Shards are located in the Underworld, which may be reached by
dungeons. Be equipped with the Magic Carpet. The Shard of Hatred
is reached by either dungeon Wrong or Covetous. Falsehood is
reached from Deceit, and Cowardice from Hythloth. The In Por spell
(Blink) and the Grapple are needed for this phase.
</P>

<H4>SHARD OF HATRED</H4>

<P>
To descend in Wrong: Yell the Word of Power at the entrance. At
the exit, head South into a room. Kill off monsters, then descend
to Level 2 via the ladder in the middle of the room. Move South SIX
times, then West FIVE times to the ladder leading Down. (Watch out
for the pit trap and force field).
</P>

<P>
Descend to Level 4, then go South SIX times and take the ladder Down
to Level 5, where you may heal at the fountain by going through a
secret door North of you, then go West ONCE and North TWICE.
</P>

<P>
The other fountain, TWO spaces East, is poisonous! From where you
entered Level 5, head South TWICE then follow along either East or
West until you reach a chance to go Down, making sure to destroy
electric fields in your way (use An Grav spell or the Sceptre), then
descend to Level 6.
</P>

<P>
Wear the crown (to ward off Wisps as you enter Level 8). On Level 6
move East (or West) TWICE, then North TWICE and descend to Level 8.
On Level 8 move North TWICE, East ONCE, then face North to reveal a
secret door. Go through the secret door and West THREE spaces to a
healing fountain. Going East all the way, then South all the way
will bring you to the exit to the Underworld. Be prepared for
battles, electric fields and bomb traps.
</P>

<P>
In the Underworld, go South on the path to the fork, then go East on
it for a short while before heading South again. At the next fork,
move South. At the next fork, go West and look for a gap in the
High Mountains to your East. Find it and begin climbing East,
following the path of low mountains between the High peaks. View
the gem and you'll see a glen in the middle of some mountains; this
is the Shard. Keep climbing until you reach it.
</P>

<H4>SHARD OF FALSEHOOD</H4>

<P>
To descend in Deceit: At the entrance yell the Word of Power. From
the exit of the dungeon, go North through a secret door to the
ladder leading Down, then descend to find a healing fountain (you'll
neeed it after battling the Daemons on the next level). Go due
South down a hallway and take the ladder Down to Level 3.
</P>

<P>
You're now in a room filled with Daemons, where a force field blocks
the middle of the room (dispell it). Take the ladder Down at the
other end of the room to Level 4. Climb Down again to Level 5. Go
West THREE times from the ladder, then due South and take the ladder
Down to Level 6. Go West ONCE and search for the pit trap (in the
middle of an intersection). Find it, step on the spot where it is
and go North to take the ladder Down to Level 7.
</P>

<P>
Go West into the room and exit it to the North. Go North to the
wall, East ONCE, North TWICE to a ladder Down to Level 8. Go South
FOUR times from the ladder to the intersection, move East TWICE,
then face South. Go South through two rooms (behind some pillars in
here are some Dragons, which can be killed - but you can't get their
treasure; also watch for a trip that releases some monsters).
</P>

<P>
Now enter the next room South to the room with 5 Black Squares in a
wall (in the middle of the room) and a ladder Down on the other
side. Take a Torch in the upper right-hand corner, walk into the
space formerly occupied by the torch and push on the East wall
there. (On the way out, however, push the WEST wall in the LOWER
LEFT-HAND CORNER!). This allows you to access the first block,
where you'll defeat a monster. Push on the West wall there to open
a block to the East. Defeat the monster, enter the block he
occupied and push the East wall. That opens a wall to your West,
where you enter another block with a monster. Kill him, enter his
space and push the West wall. That exposes the block furthest to
the East and releases the Dragon. (Try to use Morningstars or
spells on him before you release him).
</P>

<P>
Go all the way Down to the space he occupied and push the East wall.
That releases the other Dragon. Kill him, then go East ONCE from
the space he occupied and push the South wall to open a wall so you
can access the ladder Down on the other side (but on the way out,
push NORTH, not SOUTH!). Take the ladder to the Underworld. (On
the way back out, push on the WEST wall in the LOWER LEFT-HAND
corner to open the wall. Then follow the previous directions,
except in the previously noted exceptions).
</P>

<P>
In the Underworld: You begin at (5) on the provided map). Go
Southwest over lots of mountaintops until you reach some large
caves. Then head Southwest to a major intersection, where you turn
Northwest and go Northeast at the branch. Go North a long way,
until the path switches West, through some rocky hills to the
Southwest and finally you will come to a lake. Look for the river
that flows South. Jump on the Carpet and take a ride down the
rapids to find the Shard on a small island.
</P>

<H4>SHARD OF COWARDICE</H4>

<P>
To descend in Hythloth: From the exit, descend to Level 7. On
Level 7, move South TWICE (through a secret door), West ONCE and UP
to Level 6. On Level 6 move West TWICE and Down to Level 7. On
Level 7 move South TWICE, East ONCE, South TWICE, then East FOUR
TIMES through a secret door. On Level 8 move West THREE TIMES to
the Underworld exit. (Mystic Arms are found near the Underworld
Exit in Hythloth).
</P>

<P>
In the Underworld: Carry lots of gems. Go to a clearing due South
(as far as you can go on foot). "BLINK" into the clearing to the
West, then go Northwest as far as you can walk and view a gem.
"BLINK" into the clearing to the North. Then go North and "BLINK"
over more mountains. Move West and "BLINK" across more mountains.
Go North and "BLINK" again. Head Northwest to the clearing, where
you'll find the Shard.
</P>

<H3>THE AMULET</H3>

<P>
The Amulet is located in the Underworld (go through the dungeon
Destard, then Southwest, using the Magic Carpet to avoid the
poisonous area), among the Graves of Valiant Warriors (near OE GJ).
(See Underworld Map).
</P>

<P>
To Descend Dungeon Destard:
</P>

<P>
You don't HAVE to enter through the dungeon: just follow the
journal of Lord British's last trip in the manual. But you should
exit through the dungeon by reversing these directions.
</P>

<P>
Yell the Word of Power.
</P>

<P>
From Level 1, head: S - S - E - E - E - E - S - S - E - E - E - E -
S - S then descend to Level 2.
</P>

<P>
From Level 2, head: S - S - E - E - E - E - S - S - E - E then
descend (through Level 3) to Level 4.
</P>

<P>
On Level 4, head: N - N into a room and fight off the monsters.
Then take the grate down to Level 5.
</P>

<P>
On Level 5, head: S - S - E - E then descend to Level 7.
</P>

<P>
On Level 7, head: N then E into a room and exit N - N - W - N - N
into a room, then descend through the grate to Level 8 (after a
battle!).
</P>

<P>
On Level 8, you may DES POR to The Underworld or travel to the exit.
Either way, you will have to fight your way through two rooms when
you re-enter the Dungeon. The exit to the Underworld (from the
ladder) is: S - S - S - S - S - S - W - W - S - S - W - W - S - S -
S to a room entrance and enter. (Demons and Wisps are in here).
</P>

<P>
When exiting from this room, take North, East or West exit if going
to the surface. If headed for the Underworld, go South, use any
weapon and hit the torch in the middle to open the South exit and
turn that half of the room into a lava field. (You'll need a
high-level party to survive this and the next room). Then exit
South and move South to the ladder to the Underworld.
</P>

<H3>DUNGEON DOOM: THE FINAL QUEST!</H3>

<P>
Here you will finally meet rescue Lord British. The dungeon is
located at the exact centre of the Underworld and is reached by
descending through Dungeon Shame. Use the Amulet to get through the
dark area to Doom. You must have the Crown, Sceptre, Amulet and
Word of Power for Doom. You also need the Sandalwood Box.
</P>

<P>
To Descend Dungeon Shame:
</P>

<P>
Yell the Word of Power. At first you appear to be locked in, but by
attacking rocks on the Southern edge of the level with magic axes,
you'll eventually reveal a Southern exit.
</P>

<P>
Go through the exit and take the first corridor on your left.
Follow it around to the descent to Level 7. A sign will inform you
that this is the "deepest" level.
</P>

<P>
On Level 7, go: S - S - S - S then descend to Level 8.
</P>

<P>
On Level 8, go: W then DES POR to the Underworld. The exit, if you
care to find it, is (from your entrance on Level 8): W - W - S - W
- S - S - E - E - E through a secret door.
</P>

<P>
To find Doom, travel East as far as you can go, then "BLINK" to the
Grassy Plain. Cross the water on the Magic Carpet.
</P>

<P>
You must have already killed all the Shadowlords before entering
Doom. Also required are the Crown, Sceptre and Sandalwood Box. UP
and DOWN Spells cannot be cast here, so you can only exit by saving
Lord British or by being killed. Rings of Invisibility don't work
well here. It helps to wear the Crown.
</P>

<H4>DUNGEON DOOM</H4>

<DL>
<DT>LEVEL ONE
<DD>Exit the room at (a) by walking up to the edge of the West wall and
using the Sceptre, which clears out the walls. Follow the hall to
the ladder down at (b).

<DT>LEVEL TWO
<DD>From (c), walk to (d) and take the ladder down.

<DT>LEVEL THREE
<DD>From (e), go due East through the secret door and East to the room
at (f), where you can go down.

<DT>LEVEL FOUR
<DD>You emerge from level Three at (g), but continue down the ladder to
level Five.

<DT>LEVEL FIVE AND FOUR
<DD>You emerge at (h) and go East, then climb up the pit at (i). You'll
be at the top of the '+' sign-shaped area (j) on Level Four. Go
South and search for the pit (k). Climb down the pit, and you'll be
in the East/West corridor on Level Five.

<P>
If you look at a gem, this area looks like a giant grid, with
endless hallways in each direction. Right now you are in between
intersections. (You're about to get bounced around between levels a
few times here). There are pits going up at the intersection in
this area. Go east to the first intersection, turn North and take
the first pit that goes up between intersections (this is NOT shown
on the maps). You should come out at (m) on Level Four.
</P>

<P>
Search for the pit at (l) in the area's Southwest corner, which
takes you to a ladder that goes down through Level Five and drops
you off at (n) on Level Six.

<DT>LEVEL SIX
<DD>Go West from (n) to the room at the junction, then move North to the
ladder and go down.

<DT>LEVEL SEVEN
<DD>From (o), go North to the room in the middle of the hall. Don't
just pass through. You must slay all monsters in the room. A Fear
Spell - followed by a Tremor or something like that - does wonders
here. Be SURE to wear the Crown here. After wiping out the fiends,
collect all their stuff. From a sandtrap in the centre of the room,
you'll find a chest. Open it, take out everything, and a ladder
appears under the chest. Go down this ladder. (If you've taken
extensive damage, leave the room and heal first).

<DT>LEVEL EIGHT
<DD>You emerge in a room (p) divided by a river. Kill off the Dragons
and Sea Serpents (a Fear Spell works well here, too). To cross the
river, you must activate a trip mechanism in the upper left corner
of the room. Use a magic axe, spears or a throwing axe and hit the
wall in that section. It's left of the two waterfalls. When you
hit it, the bridge is lowered so you can cross the river. This also
releases some monsters, but you can just race across the bridge if
you don't want to fight it out. Go West and climb the ladder to (q)
on Level Seven.

<DT>LEVEL SEVEN
<DD>In the room at (q), you want to go South but there is no exit. So
wipe out the monsters and push on the wall near the grate to
activate the trip, which exposes a section of wall to the North.
From where the grate is, go to the section of wall just revealed and
push on it, which opens an exit to the South. After going South,
search for a trap at the end of the hallway. This pit trap takes
you down to (r) on Level Eight.

<DT>LEVEL EIGHT
<DD>Go West from (r) and climb up the ladder to (s) on Level Seven.

<DT>LEVEL SEVEN
<DD>From (s), go West and South, searching for the pit trap on the
corner. Go around this one, search again and take the next pit trap
(t) down to (u) on Level Eight. (Be sure you're wearing the Crown
before going down the pit).

<DT>LEVEL EIGHT
<DD>On the island (u), first wipe out all the monsters. Choose one
character to go to the Northern section of the room, which appears
to contain an exit. After the exit seals itself off, someone should
push around on the little niche up in the walls of the room's
Northeast corner. There's a trip that opens an exit to the East.
Go East to (v) and climb up the ladder to (w) on Level Seven.

<DT>LEVEL SEVEN
<DD>In (w) is a giant brazier. Do not hit or push the brazier (unless
you enjoy being engulfed in hot lava!). To deal with the Daemons on
the other side of the barrier, use the Sceptre to chew it away. (If
you're wearing the Crown, the Daemons can't harm you). Then walk
through and bash the monsters. (Or you can stand near the wall and
attack them with a Morningstar, though this would take a long time).
Exit to the East, but search before you get to the end of the
hallway to avoid falling into a trap. After searching, you can go
down the pit to (x) on Level Eight.

<DT>LEVEL EIGHT: FREE AT LAST!
<DD>This room (x) has no exits. Walk up to the mirror. (Hopefully you
brought the Sandalwood Box!).

<H3>MOONGATES</H3>

<P>
When a Moongate disappears, you can search and find a Moonstone.
these may be carried, and when used at any (grassy) location, will
establish that Moongate at that spot. It is advisable to take one
or more of the Moonstones from gates that are not absolutely
necessary, because you can travel to the location by other means.
For instance, it would not be wise to remove the Moonstone from New
Magencia. Good candidates are the stones near Brittany Bay, Yew or
Trinsic, because these locations are easy to get to by Magic Carpet.
