<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Take one giant step beyond reality! UFO puts you at the controls of
an advanced spacecraft capable of aerodynamic and Quantum flight.
Your mision, scour planet Earth for the fuel needed to power your
galactic ships, then return to the orbiting mother ship to trade raw
fuel for supplies. You can explore subLOGIC Scenery disks in an
entirely new way with this easy-to-fly simulation.
</P>

<H2>CHEATS</H2>

<P>
After playing the game for a while and building up your stores save
the game. Now quit the game and go into your current save game
directory and make a copy of the base.dat file. Now boot the game
back up and sell everything you have (if you need money) or transfer
stores (not ships or personel) to other bases. Now save the game
again and quit. Next replace the base.dat file with a the copy of
the original that you made earlier. Now when you go back to the 
game you'll have all the money from the sales plus all the equipment
you sold. And, if you transferred anything those items will arrive
shortly. Continue the above procedure as often as you like.
</P>

<P>
You will be able to use alien weapons even though you did not
collect the technology from them. However you will have to research
the alien weapons technology. Same for UFO construction. You will
have access to researching all availlabe (or most) UFO ships and
Alien life forms, including researching the cyclona bust, which will
enable you to go to mars and destroy the alien base. Only an
avenger can fly to mars and equip your players with fusion ball
launchers and the most destructive weapons availlable for mars.
</P>

<P>
In order for the Cheat to work you must FIRST construct all 3 bases
on earth. Try to spread them out wisely!
</P>

<P>
Once you have done this. Make a backup of the file liglob.dat, and
then, use a hex-editor. Load the hex-editor into workbench and load
the file liglob.dat into the hex-editor.
</P>

<P>
If you change all the values to "FF" (like below) the following will
happen.
</P>

<P>
ffffffff ffffffff ffffffff ffffffff<BR>
ffffffff etc...
</P>

<P>
078 to 0F8 (Full Weapon for Base 1)<BR>
0F9 to 135 (Full Weapon for Base 2)<BR>
136 to 172 (Full Weapon for Base 3)<BR>
248 to 257 (Get all Jets and game Solution ??)<BR>
2E0 to 2F3 (Collect all alien life forms ?)
</P>

<P>
314 to 317<BR>
The Value for money must be set to 3B9AC9F8 for 999,999,999 dollars
US.
</P>

<P>
The awesome thing about this hack is that you also get to research
and build all the advances buildings such as psionic lab and fusion
ball defences etc.. early in the game!!
</P>

<P>
Also, after changing all the weapon values, you only need to
manifacture one of each item, and your inventory will indicate yu
have 255 or 226 of these items! (Although some items may be in the
research window, they might already be availlable.)
</P>

<P>
Best of all you get a lot of elyrium!
</P>

<P>
One draw back is that I was not able to find out the location for
the UFO power source and UFO Navigation. Once you get these from a
mission, I am not sure if these items will go to 256 (items) or you
might have to re-edit the save game file to update/refresh your
FF's.
</P>

<P>
Weapon storage buildings are not neccessary when using the cheat,
although it might help to build 2 or 3 of them.
</P>

<P>
One problem is the fact that your bases will have 255 scientists and
255 technitians (or whatever, can't remember their title). So you
will not be able to purchase soldiers in bases 2 and 3 until you
build enough Living space for all the 255 scientsts and other dudes
and the soldiers themselves. You can try selling Scientisis etc to
make space.
</P>

<P>
A Formidable ship is the Avenger with Fusion ball launcher/Ammo!
</P>

<P>
NOTE: When editing, be sure to have the current sector and ending
sector at the same location, and above all - backup your save game
file!
</P>

<H2>TIPS</H2>
 
<H3>GETTING STARTED</H3>

<P>
First of all, check your soldiers and sack any that have a firing
accuracy of less than about 60. Keep hiring and firing soldiers
until you have 10 good marksmen. This may take some time but don't
worry. The funding countries won't kick up a fuss as long as you
shoot down the UFOs with your interceptors.
</P>

<P>
You don't have to go for every UFO with your Skyranger - the larger
ones are the most worthwhile.
</P>

<P>
Buy three Avalanche launchers and missiles and equip your
interceptors with Avalanches only. They are undoubtedly the most
efficient. While you're at it, buy some Electro Flares and put them
on your Skyranger. They come in handy for your graveyard shifts.
</P>

<P>
As for your soldiers, equip them with rifles and grenades, then hire
30 more scientists and 10 more engineers. Let your scientists
research laser weapons technology to produce laser rifles for your
soldiers.
</P>

<P>
If you still have some money left, start building your second base.
The most efficient way is to build the bases roughly on the equator.
If the first one is located in Florida, the second one should be
built on the other side of the globe, in India or Africa. The next
base could be in Japan, on the tiny Pacific islands or in Europe.
</P>

<H3>MEETING THE ENEMY</H3>

<P>
Now you should be ready for your first encounter with the aliens.
If you've shot down a UFO, save the game. If it's dark, wait until
daybreak before you send in your Skyranger. If you can't wait,
don't forget those Electro Flares. Move your soldiers under your
Skyranger first and let them check the area. Turn them around on
the spot, until you've discovered the surroundings, then cautiously
move them on, always leaving them some movement points for their
automatic reactions.
</P>

<P>
After a successful fight you'll return with lots of useful stuff.
Don't sell it all, let your scientists research it. Start with
Alien Alloys (which leads to Personnel Armour) and then go for Heavy
Plasma (which leads to Plasma Beam). If you've already researched
Plasma Beam, equip your interceptors with these weapons as soon as
possible.
</P>

<P>
Keep all elerium if possible, it will be important later in the
game. Of course, if an alien attack on your base leaves you with
5000 units of elerium, you can sell 4000.
</P>

<H3>MIND GAMES</H3>

<P>
If you are too successful, the aliens will start attacking your
bases. Sometimes they terrorise cities as well so just send out
your Skyranger and get rid of them.
</P>

<P>
The aliens can only mind control your soldiers if at least one alien
can see them. There are three types of alien that can do this:
Sectoid Leaders, Sectoid Commanders and all Ethereals. Buy stun
rods and try to catch one of them alive (having built an Alien
Containment first, of course). Research the living alien. Now you
can build a Psi Lab and develop your soldiers' psionic abilities.
Some soldiers will get mind controlled more easily than others, so
sack them. Recruit and sack soldiers and train them until you've
got at least two or three with a psionic strength of 90 or more.
Put your super brains on your Avenger or Skyranger and let them mind
control the aliens.
</P>

<P>
Even if they don't succeed in the beginning, the practice will
accelerate the development of their skills. Once their psionic
abilities have reached 50 or more, they can even control Ethereals.
</P>

<P>
Try to catch living alien navigators, physicians and engineers to
research them. Alien navigators or engineers can tell you something
about alien crafts and their weapons or about new facilities for
tracking UFOs.
</P>

<P>
Finally, you'll have to catch a few alien commanders. They'll tell
you something about 'Cydonia'. Don't waste your time and money with
weak interceptors. Research the Avenger, send it to Cydonia and
kick some alien butt.
</P>

<H3>TACTICS</H3>

<P>
You can use the Blaster Launcher like a can opener. Make your own
entrance and send your soldiers through. If you don't need anything
from the craft, simply shoot it to pieces with four Blaster
Launchers and send in two or three soldiers to clean up the rest.
</P>

<P>
In a base, try to find the control room as soon as possible. The
first Blaster Bomb goes right through the tiny window at the side
and opens a hole in the second wall. The second Blaster Bomb goes
through this window to the elevator, then go up and left or right.
Enjoy the explosions! Even if you don't like this form of fighting,
it's worthwhile seeing it. You can find the elevator even in
complete darkness. If you put the cursor on it, you'll see the
elevator rays.
</P>

<P>
In the middle of the game, you should aim to have five to eight
bases. In the first base you should have two Psi Labs, two
Workshops, 20-30 soldiers (two Avengers with about 10 soldiers each
and 10 left behind to protect the base), 50 scientists and 80-100
engineers.
</P>

<P>
Building an Avenger with only a few engineers takes a lot of time.
</P>

<P>
Above all, save the game as often as possible. If you lose a
battle, or something goes drastically wrong, you can just reload and
try again.
</P>
