<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Spend an... unusual... day in a haunted mansion as you attempt to
find your brother and uncover the eerie secrets of an eerie house.
You don't want an invitation to this mansion! 
</P>

<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
To get past the ghostly lady, go towards the hall from the stairs,
enter the storage closet and take the No-Ghost bottle. Open the
bottle and go back to the hall. Operate the bottle on the lady.
</P>

<P>
To get past the dogs, say "INSTANTUM ILLUMINARIS ABRAXAS" to them.
</P>

<P>
You will find a key if you operate the knife on the left chair in
the lounge. This key is used to open the cabinet in the master
bedroom.
</P>

<P>
In the cathedral, say "SPECAN HEAFOD ABRAXAS" to the plaster head.
</P>

<P>
Reading other people's mail isn't polite, but it could save your
life.
</P>

<P>
Check the upstairs closet for something to take care of Miss O'Hara.
But be sure to open it before you use it.
</P>

<P>
The nightstand in the upstairs bedroom has a hollow ring to it.
</P>

<P>
The lamp in the servants room does it's job without electricity.
</P>

<P>
The servant won't let you read his diary, but if you could get him
out of the way...
</P>

<P>
Spray the Spider Cider on the railing on the veranda and leave the
porch. Come back later and the spider will be caught. Show the
spider to the servant to scare him away.
</P>

<P>
Read the book in the master bedroom.
</P>

<P>
The key in the chair opens many things.
</P>

<P>
Some dogs are afraid of lightning (Instantum Illuminaris Abraxas).
</P>

<P>
Talking heads need conversation once in a while, so brush up on your
Latin (Specan Heafod Abraxas).
</P>

<P>
A cross will some in handy later on but the secret trap door under
the altar is not the way to go.
</P>

<P>
The candelabra will protect you on your way to the maze. (Remember
to light it).
</P>

<P>
The amulet can take care of only one Zombie at a time so if you run
up against a buch of them, RUN.
</P>

<P>
There is one grave here that is different from the others and you
have only one bunch of flowers.
</P>

<P>
The key from the chair will open the cages.
</P>

<P>
Cage the bird and the snake and the cat will take care of each
other.
</P>

<P>
The boiuncing creature would just love a bird to play with. If you
find the creature it will leave the gem behind.
</P>

<P>
Put the gem in the gemshaped hole in the magisterium doorway.
</P>

<P>
The guardian demon could probably use some fruit. Water the one
plant in the greenhouse that is not dead and it will grow soon.
</P>

<P>
"Gold, silver and mercury - together they form a key." Look in the
study desk drawer and find the atomic numbers of these three
elements. This is the combination to the safe.
</P>

<P>
Hack the cookie jar with the axe and leave the cookie in the house.
The little guy will exchange the key for the cookie.
</P>

<P>
Light a fire in the entrance hall fireplace and throw the hingeless
box in the fire. The star will burn the ice under the door in the
lab.
</P>

<P>
The spider kills. Avoid it.
</P>

<P>
Operate then star from the hingeless box on the ice and follow the
evil genius.
</P>

<P>
Throw the evil genius down the bottomless pit before he wakes up.
The key you got from the little guy unlocks the door to the house.
</P>

<P>
Your brother's screams are coming from above the upstairs bathroom
with the odd light fixture. Wait until the water almost fills the
room and open the fixture.
</P>

<P>
Your brother seems delirious. Smack some sence into him.
</P>

<P>
A simple wooden cross will take care of the demon.
</P>

<P>
Follow your brother out the window.
</P>

<P>

</P>

<UL>
<LI>Getting in the coffin in the maze?
<LI>Not caging one of the animals?
