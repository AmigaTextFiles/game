<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Scientific role-playing. Assume the role of Time Lord, a mythical
time traveler, and seek out a time machine you must destroy at all
costs. Customize your character: decide on strengths and weaknesses
in fighting, diplomacy, dexterity, etc. Rock soundtrack, digitized
sound, speech syntheis. Smooth scrolling 3D colour graphics.
Sophisticated character interaction.
</P>

<H2>HINTS</H2>

<P>
This text is intended to help someone who has not yet finished this
adventure. I hope the hints below will give you enough guidance to
get through it.

<LI>
This game is essentially about locating Kurtz and the
Time-Transportation device (however, in the actual game it is called
a Time WARP device. Something that is a bit confusing towards the
end). You do not achieve this goal with lots of finesse or even
elaborate problem solving. You do it by being larger and carrying
bigger "sticks" than any of the characters who might get in your
way. In that sense, this is more or less a sci-fi Bard's Tale with
one character and a much less than satisfactory combat system. (I
picked up all sorts of items along the way- passcards, remote
control units, signs, etc. -that I never had any use for at all.)
You therefore have a decision to make from the very beginning: do
you develop your character slowly over time, getting killed a lot at
first but achieving the satisfaction that you EARNED the good
character? OR do you hack the game from the very beginning,
starting out with a decent character?

<P>
I warn you, if you want to develop your own character, you'll spend
a lot of time on the first few levels getting killed and re-booting
your machine (thanks to the fact that Jagware didn't put more
sophisticated save-and-continue and restore-and-continue commands in
the game).
</P>

<P>
If you do want to edit your character, however, it is VERY possible.
Thanks to the Plink author of Super_Timelord.txt I have discovered
how it is done. The 9th to 15th bytes in any character file contain
your character's Fighting, Marksmanship, Diplomacy, Dexterity,
Understanding, Tracking, and Quickness in that order. If you can
get your hands on a binary file editor, such as Plinks NewZap, you
can make your character as powerful as you like. The game is much
less frustrating this way.

The other difficulty with this game is mapping, which is a
nightmare. Unless you are VERY experienced at mapping and have a
LOT of patience, I suggest you put aside the normal graph-paper and
pencils and use this method:

<P>
Every time you enter a new room, note the room colour (ie- Dark
Pink, Red, Light Blue), the number of doors in that room and the
directions in which those doors lead. Draw a room that is
approximately the shape of the room you are in on a piece of paper
and lines away from the walls to represent doors (in the appropriate
directions). Move through a door, connecting the next room through
the line you drew and continue the process, much as if you were
mapping an Infocom game.
</P>

<P>
This method isn't neat, but it keeps you from getting lost, and I
found it more than adequate for finishing the game.
</P>

<LI>
There are three levels on the colony and then three levels on the
space station. The secret to finishing the game is finding a ladder
or elevator on each level to move to the next level, blowing away
all hostile aliens that get in your way.

<LI>
If you have questions about something in the game, I find it helpful
to ask friendly characters (Angel, Jessica, etc.). They can often
help you, but of course they aren't available on the advanced
levels. In general, any time you meet a character, look at them and
ask them who they are.

<LI>
Any time you encounter an item, look at it and take it. The GUM
MACHINES are an especially helpful item because they restore your
hit points. There is one on every level (after the first) and it
is usually near the entrance to that level. Beware, however,
because if you have low Understanding, you may be poisoned and die!

<LI>
The most important rule for this game is...SAVE OFTEN. I know it is
frustrating to continually be re-booting (you shouldn't have to) but
the odds are you will die at least once on every level (unless you
edit your statistics to astronomical heights).
