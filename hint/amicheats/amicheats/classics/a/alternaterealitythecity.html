<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Fantasy role-playing adventure game. Explore The City, fully
populated with new creatures. Secret doors lead to adventure.
Internal clock times sunrise and weather.
</P>

<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
Save your character often to a separate backup disk!
</P>

<P>
Have (or get) a fast copy utility. Do NOT use the backup utility
that comes with the game.
</P>

<P>
Copy your character to several disks when:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>You have many potions or
<LI>You are about to increase a level. Enter the game with each of
these disks, keeping notes on what potions you found or what stats
were increased. Use the best of the ones you tried, or re-copy and
try again!
</UL>

<P>
Avoid Brown Molds, Black Slimes, and Giant Rats as often as possible
until you are either rich and can afford trips to the healers, or
can defeat these monsters. Tricking them is a successful means of
defeating these disease giving creatures IF you have high enough
intelligence.
</P>

<P>
Do not carry more food, water, gold and gems then you really need
to. Excess weight will cause your character to become weary sooner
and reduce your adventuring time between stops at the inns.
</P>

<P>
Do not bother to examine or taste potions, just sip. Avoid too many
protection potions as this will cause your character to crash.
</P>

<P>
While still a lower level character, avoid being out at night or in
the rain.
</P>

<P>
When finding a weapon, always equip it as a secondary weapon in case
it is cursed.
</P>

<P>
ALTERNATE REALITY begins with the first of six scenarios in THE
CITY. Your character, after escaping from the spaceship in which he
was abducted from his home, will find himself facing the Floating
Gate in the City Square. Your character will have 3 packets of
food, 3 flasks of water and some money. Although food and water
will always be of concern in this game, you need not worry about
them at this time. You do need a weapon.
</P>

<P>
To the north and south of this position are shops. To the west is a
smithy's; and to the east, one of the three banks. Near the bank
there is a tavern, and near the smithy's there is an inn. Turn to
the west and enter the smithy's. Make an offer on a dagger of
slightly under whatever your character was given at the start of the
game. If the smithy will not accept this offer, try making an offer
on a stiletto.
</P>

<P>
Once armed, you are prepared as a beginning character to take on THE
CITY. THE CITY is primarily a game of mapping and building your
character for the scenarios that are supposed to follow.
</P>

<P>
Although the city square is reputed to be one of the safest parts of
town, it is not the cheapest; and you will need to find cheaper inns
and taverns in order to survive the initial development of your
character.
</P>

<P>
There are in THE CITY: 7 inns, 14 taverns, 3 banks, 15 shops, 4
smithies, 2 healers, and 12 guilds.
</P>

<P>
Inns provide a safe place for your character to rest and regain hit
points. Inns will also allow you to check the time.
</P>

<P>
Taverns supply food and water. Food packets and water flasks are
never offered for sale at the same time.
</P>

<P>
Banks will allow you to deposit your money in three types of
accounts with increasing risk. They will also purchase gems and
jewels.
</P>

<P>
Shops sell a wide variety of clothing which is of little importance
in this first scenario. Shops also sell compasses for 5 silver
pieces.
</P>

<P>
Smithies sell armour and weapons. As with the shops, prices vary
and few items are cheap.
</P>

<P>
There are two healers. Healers can serve a variety of purposes, but
are most useful for curing disease.
</P>

<H2>LOCATIONS</H2>

<P>
There are 12 guilds in THE CITY. In this first scenario your
character may not join the guilds, but they still have their
usefulness. Your first visit to a guild will improve one of your
stats or your chances of surviving. Guilds can also remove curses
from weapons and armour. Prices for these services vary from guild
to guild.
</P>

<P>
The map for THE CITY is 64 squares by 64 squares. Square 1,1 is in
the southwestern corner. When I give locations, I will be giving
first the number of squares north on the map, the second number will
be the number of squares east on the map. When I give the location
of a place, the coordinates listed will be those of the actual
place. If you must enter from a specific direction, and it is not
an obvious door, these directions will be listed after the
coordinates.
</P>

<H3>INNS</H3>

<P>
26, 32 - Prices high*<BR>
25, 33 - Prices high* (*these are both the same inn)<BR>
24, 33 - Reasonable<BR>

04, 32 - Very expensive<BR>
07, 61 - Cheap<BR>
53, 34 - Reasonable<BR>
55, 29 - Cheap
</P>

<P>
More hit restoring benefits seemed to be gained by renting a room
with a bath, but this is not a universal rule. Let your purse and
needs decide.
</P>

<H3>TAVERNS</H3>

<P>
30, 40 - Expensive<BR>
20, 33 - Reasonable, hours limited<BR>

57, 53 - Reasonable, can be entered from south or west
</P>

<P>
Food packets and/or Pemmican will never be offered at the same time
as water flasks. Menus change hourly. It is easiest to find food
on even hours, and water on odd. This is not universally true, but
a good guide. Almost all taverns sell food at midnight.
</P>

<H3>BANKS</H3>

<P>
28, 39 - Interest rates are lower but investment is safe<BR>
07, 31 - Higher interest rates, more likely to lose money<BR>

</P>

<P>
Banks that offer higher interest for your deposits are more likely
to have bank failures.

</P>

<P>
Potions can be helpful or harmful. The higher your wisdom and
intelligence, the more easily you will be able to identify the
potions. Some potions such as Fleetness and Protection+1 and
Protection+2 have a greater frequency of occurrence than do the
others. What a potion will be is randomly decided by the program
when you unseal the potion.
</P>

<P>
You can increase your control over potions by saving them, saving
your character, making backup copies, re-entering the game and
trying them. If you are not satisfied with the potions you got, you
can restore and try again. Treasure Finding will greatly increase
your ability to find money, potions and weapons!
