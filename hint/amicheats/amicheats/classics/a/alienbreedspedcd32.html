<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Alien Breed is another classic Team 17 title which is not to be
missed. Budding space mercenaries can stop chomping at the bit and
kick butt with this incredible experience. Completing the line up of
this tremendous CD is Quack, a cute platform game for 1 or 2 players
which is dangerously playable. All games remain more or less
unchanged from their original Amiga releases, although they have
been adapted to make use of the CD32 gamepad and all it's buttons.
