<P>
Pause the game (wait till the music is inaudible) and enter the
following sequence with the joystick:
</P>

<P>
U,D,L,R,F,D,U,R,L,F,D,R,F,R,D,F:
</P>

<P>
You should hear a "YA" if it worked. Use the following keys during
play:
</P>

<P>
'F10'--------------Completes level and goes to bonus game<BR>
'1'-'9'---Skip to the corresponding level (No bonus game)<BR>
'Z'--------------Move Aladdin anywhere using the joystick<BR>
'+'--Speeds up movement when used in conjunction with 'Z'<BR>
'-'-Slows down movement when used in conjunction with 'Z'<BR>
'0'----------------------------------Another pause mode??
</P>

<P>
On the bonus game, pause the game and use the 'TAB' key to cycle
through the bonuses until you get to the one you want (the free
guy). Now press the fire button and continue to hit 'TAB' until
your lives go up by one. You can keep doing this until you get
nine lives or run out of chances.
</P>

<P>
Or you could enter this other sequence:
</P>

<P>
U,D,L,R,F,D,U,R,L,F,D,R,F,R,D,F,U,U,F,D,U,D,F
</P>

<P>
The game should now unpause. The cheats do exactly the same thing
and only one will need to be activated. Use the keys listed above.
