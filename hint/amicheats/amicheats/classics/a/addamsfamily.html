<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Uncle Fester has lost his memory and fallen under the spell of
Abigail Craven, a conniver who wants to get her hands on the Addams'
hidden fortune. She manages to capture and imprison the members of
the Addams Family within their huge mansion. Only Gomez can save the
day by freeing Pugsley, Wednesday, and Granny and by restoring Uncle
Festor's memory. Then Gomez must find Morticia in the underground
vaults and confront the evil Judge in a kooky, spooky climax!
</P>

<H2>SECRET ROOMS</H2>

<P>
In the hall of rooms, walk left until there is a door above you.
Push up to enter a secret room; collect all the stuff in this room.
Then walk directly up that door and puch up, here you'll find more
treasures and goodies.
</P>

<P>
Pause the game by pressing 'SPACE' and then hit 'ESC'. You will now
be in the room with a continue door and an escape door (the level
end). Instead of choosing one of these options just keep walking
left until you come across another room full of extra lives.
</P>

<P>
To get 4 free lives each time your game is over, walk past the
continue door to the left and there is a room where you can collect
them.

<H2>TIPS</H2>

<H3>THE GRAVEYARD</H3>

<P>
Go left and climb up the hangman's noose. Get the fez and fly up to
the top left of the screen. Collect the invincibility pill and land
on the right chimney.
</P>

<P>
Go down the chimney and go down to the bottom left of the screen.
Walk left and you'll enter a new room. You will come to a very high
wall. To get over it you must jump onto the small wall beside it
and go one pixel to the edge.
</P>

<P>
Walk through the next wall and jump up and to the left. To get the
invincibility pill, walk through the wall to the right of it. Keep
on going and you will come to a room with three extra lives. Now
jump up on the chimney. Pull down on the joystick and you will
enter another room. Now leave that room and jump off the roof!
Walk right and go down the hole in the ground. Go left and you'll
find a bonus room. Jump up and right and collect the points. The
rest of the level is easy, just remember to duck under the bats.
When you reach the end go right and collect the money.
</P>

<P>
The is another level beyond this but ignore it, it's a waste of
lives. Exit the level. Now you are outside again, only there's a
lot more baddies. Make sure to avoid the nasty looking tree! Go
into the house. Go into the bottom left room. Climb the tree. To
kill the bird you must jump on his head six times. To do this, hide
at the end of a branch where you are safe. When the bird passes
beneath you jump on her quickly and go back to where you were. Once
the bird is dead leave the room.
</P>

<H3>WEDNESDAY</H3>

<P>
The room to the bottom right (Conservatory) contains Wednesday.
First of all the walking helmets can't be killed without you losing
a heart, so avoid them. Shortly before you meet the first three
spiders you should see a running shoe. Go right and walk through
the wall to find bonus room.
</P>

<P>
Just beyond the spiders is a switch. To get to it jump onto the
ledge beside the spikes, jump onto a flying nasty and then jump
again to reach the switch. By the way, this tactic is very
important; the game cannot be finished without it.
</P>

<P>
To complete the new room you must use the ramps effectively. Walk
up these to increase your jumping power. You will come to a point
where a dozen flying nasties are flying over some spikes. Jump on
them and when they are all dead you can fall into the secret room
beneath them. When this sub level is complete you will enter a new
room. Fall down onto the spike nearest to you and it becomes a
block. Go left and you will find an extra life and points. Jump up
and right for another power up and more points.
</P>

<P>
This level is full of spikes, so remember when there's a spike above
and below you, a short hop is most effective. When this sublevel is
completed you will enter a graveyard. Watch out for the pumpkins,
they drop fire on you.
</P>

<P>
Enter the little building at the end. Wednesday is in here. Bear
in mind the tactic I mentioned earlier on this level! You often
have to use the bubbles the fish fire as launch pads.
</P>

<P>
There is only one very hard point to this level which consists of a
number of small ledges. You must stand at the very edge of each
ledge and use large jumps to succeed. It's very frustrating I'm
afraid! To dodge the star-shaped guillotines you must pass under
them when they're up. To kill the end of level boss, dodge the
skulls and use the two bricks as launch pads for your jumps. Jump
when the skulls leave the screen. There is also a bonus room under
where Wednesday is standing.
</P>

<H3>GRANNY</H3>

<P>
Granny is in part of the top right room (Kitchen). When you enter
the room go left. The switch is at the very top of the level.
There are two bonus rooms, one is in the top right corner and the
other is in the top left one. Pull down on the top of the oven to
enter.
</P>

<P>
There are bonuses to the right of the information box, any of the
switches in this room let you get to them. To avoid the nozzles
which shoot fire you must jump just after they fire.
</P>

<P>
The bouncing fireballs can be avoided by jumping when they are at
their lowest point. To dodge the hopping fireballs duck under them
when they are at their highest point.
</P>

<P>
The flying stars travel in circles. Walk past them just as they
pass you. There are also slow moving stars and they can be dodged
by walking past when they are at their furthest point from you.
</P>

<P>
Speed is important in this level, many of the moving bricks pass
through lava, so you must jump on them before this happens. Always
go as close to a platform's edge as possible to maximise your jump.
</P>

<P>
When you reach Granny go to the far right-hand corner of the room.
The boss passes by you three times. The first time, he can be hit,
but on the other occasions he turns his spikes towards you.
</P>

<P>
You can duck most of the fireballs, but sometimes he fires a low
shot which you must jump over. When he is dead you will appear on
top of the oven. Walk past the level entrance and go into the deep
freeze.
</P>

<P>
You must kill as many penguins as possible because otherwise they
will follow you. You must use the tactic I mentioned earlier to get
past some of the higher walls. The snowman at the end of the level
can only be hit when he's in snowman form.
</P>

<P>
He's invincible when he becomes a snowball. Watch out for the
icicles; if you stand between them you will not get hurt. If you
kill the snowman then you are awarded four hearts per life.
</P>

<H3>PUGSLEY</H3>

<P>
The top room (Games Room) contains Pugsly. There are three types of
very harmful nasties on this level. The ball and chains can be
dodged by jumping past when they are at the furthest point away from
you. The nasty who fires the disk can be killed by jumping at him
when the disk has past you. Once he is dead the disk disappears.
Finally the chains of disks can be dodged by walking past when the
chain has just past you. Some of these chains also appear in the
Granny level. You must use the cannon balls as launch pads for your
jumps, as in the other levels. To kill the boss you must jump on
the top of his head when the discs leave the screen. Be quick
though, they reappear very quickly. Duck in a corner the rest of
the time, so you can't be hit.
</P>

<H3>UNCLE FESTER</H3>

<P>
The room to the top left (Portrait Gallery) contains Uncle Fester.
This level is quite long. The jumping nasties are easy to kill -
just jump on them when they are at their lowest point. In the case
of the flying ones, kill them when they are a standard jump's
distance away. The same goes for the unicycle baddies in the
majority of cases, as well as for the green mem, the knights, who
are unarmed, and for the men on green ducks with lances. There are
also knights in this level who throw swords. Jump on them when they
turn their backs on you. The suits of armour can be dodged by
walking past when the mace just passes you. If a jump is required,
then use a low-powered one, and wait until the mace is halfway
through its swing. Later on you will come across book worms. Use
the unicycle tactic on them.
</P>

<P>
The paperweights are best avoided, but if you must kill them use the
unicycle tactic again, only this time be quick, because the weights
move very fast. There are also spring-powered baddies, who follow
you like the penguins.
</P>

<P>
Jump at them when they are at the lowest point of their hop. You
will come to a room with a train in it. The track will kill you, as
will the sharp cogs. To avoid them look at their positioning, you
can either jump over them, or duck under them.
</P>

<P>
If you are going to jump over them then stand on the funnel of the
engine. If you want to duck, then stand on the lowest point of the
train, and duck.
</P>

<P>
Thw witch is very hard to kill, you must jump on her when she's at
the lowest point of her swoop. You also have to use Uncle Fester as
a jumping point by standing on his head. When she's dead, exit the
level.
</P>

<H3>MORTICIA</H3>

<P>
Morticia is in the middle room (Music Room). Don't forget you have
to save the others first. Go into the middle room and wait for the
music to stop. The wall at the right side of the room drops and you
can go in the door. In the third maze room go left until you reach
a door. This leads to a money pit and two new doors. The left door
leads to a bonus room and the right door leads to a new level. All
the nasties here use a movement pattern that some other sprite uses
elsewhere in the game. The bird uses the pattern of the green
flying eye in the snowman level. The green blob moves the same as
the bouncing flame in the oven. The rolling rock moves the same as
the snowballs in the deep freeze. There are skulls and ball and
chains too. There are also fish which can be killed by swimming
over them and touching your feet on them. Be warned though because
you move slowly in the water. There are flying mouse-like faces as
well, who move the same as the flying nasties in the garden level.
</P>

<P>
To kill the end of level boss you must dodge the hammers. Stand on
the right most part of the low right ledge when you want to hide.
To begin with he jumps to the right. Easy to kill this guy. Just
jump on him. Password here is "K1Y1H"
</P>

<P>
After your first attack, he hops once on the top of the pedestal and
then jumps to the left. From now on, however, he hops once on the
pedestal, then down onto the ground in the middle and then to the
right. He hops once more on the top of the pedestal, then on the
middle ground and then to the left. When he's dead you've won! But
you are'nt done yet! Go into the "tube" that the kid was standing
on and you will find a nice profitable drop! Enjoy the end
sequence!
