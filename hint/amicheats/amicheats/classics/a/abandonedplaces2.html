<H2>CHEATS</H2>

<P>
This cheat will increase your character's experience significantly.
Attack and kill any single monster (or group of monsters). When it
(or they) begin to visibly fade away, cast any 'HOLD MONSTER' spell
that you have such as 'DREAM' or 'HOLD EVERYTHING'. The creature
will cease dimming and just sit there. Now you can attack with
your fighters or cast attack spells (including 'FIRE AREA'). To
rake in experience points with no worry of the monster going
anywhere until the spell wears off. This can be verified by
watching the experience line in the character sheet grow while you
are attacking the faded creature. If you are quick enough, you can
refreeze the monster, otherwise just go and find another one to
repeat the trick.
