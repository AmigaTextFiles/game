<H3>DAY 1</H3>

<P>
Horny will 'attack' the principle during the assembly. After that,
you will be in the classroom with Ms Glass. Don't let Horny 'attack'
her if you want to carry on with the game. (You can try it out for
some fun). Willy should pretend to have a stomach upset to get away
from the teacher, but when the nurse question you, say it's alright.
</P>

<P>
Back in classroom. You can choose to be a good boy and sit down to
write your compositon until the class is over. You will miss some of
the fun if you did this. The alternative method (recommended) is to
sneak out of the classroom when the teacher falls asleep. (zzz...Z)
But before that, make sure you click on your table and get the piece
of wood and crayons. When you are outside the classroom, the coach
will stop you and demand a hall pass. Click on yourself to bring up
the inventory. Click on the white crayon and on the piece of wood,
this will write the word 'Hall Pass' on it. Click on the Hall Pass
and move it outside the inventory, this will clear the inventory
window. Give the Hall Pass to the coach. Go to toilet. Inside the
toilet, Spider will demand something from you. Give him the game
buddies. You are now free to leave the school. From now on school is
over.

letter the principle sent to your parent. (You must sneak out the
classroom to be able to do this) Get letter. Go inside house. Go to

properly treated.
</P>

<P>
Go to the dining room for dinner. Be a good boy and give the letter
to your father. He will get angry and give your Nintari key to your
sister for save keeping. After dinner, go upstairs. Mother will ask
you to bring the conditioner to your sister. Go to Brianne room,
help her to get back to bed (this might occur randomly) and this
will make the game easier. Go to bathroom. You will see the
conditioner and Nintari key on the table. There are a few way to get
the key form your sister. Firstly, you can used your frog on her.
This will scarce the hell out of her and you can take the key and
walk away. Secondly, you can get her diary from her room and then
used it on her. She will give up and let you have the key. (This is
not recommended, the diary have other purposes as well). Go back to
your room and unlock the Nintari system with the key. Play a few
rounds and then go to bed.
