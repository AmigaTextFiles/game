<H2>CHEATS</H2>

<P>
On the briefing screen, type "COKEBUSTERS" and the screen will
flash. You now have infinite lives.
</P>

<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
These are basically the same throughout the game, so i`ll keep this
bit brief. It`s important that you get some extra weapons as soon
as possible to beef up your arsenal. If you are playing in
two-player mode, try and get on either side of an enemy and knife
him from both sides. This should kill him nice and quickly.
</P>

<P>
The two most important weapons are the rifle and the grenades. The
rifle is the best weapon for seeing off the guards, and the grenades
take care of the men with flame-throwers quite nicely.
</P>

<P>
Be on the look out for extra lives. You pick them up by hiding in
the scenery, and if you find one you`ll hear a ping and a "1up" icon
will float away.
</P>

<P>
On the first section, there are two bonus lives quite near the end.
This should give you a healthy stock of lives to get through the
next few levels. My advise is to keep hiding in every nook and
cranny as you go along, until you find the extra lives.
</P>

<P>
There are some other tricky bits to look out for. The dog on the
second scrolling section cannot be killed, even with grenades, so
just hide in the scenery until he`s run past. Also be on the look
out for the snipers in the background.
</P>

<P>
Like the dog, they can`t be killed, so here`s what to do. Shuffle
out into the line of fire, and just before he shoots at you, roll
back into cover. Now quickly run past him. With practice, this
should get you past him with no trouble at all.
</P>

<H3>THE BARRACKS</H3>

<P>
The first building you reach will be the barracks, and it leads into
the first 3-d section. Your task here is to find some important
documents which will prove miguel tardiez`s guilt and all-round
fiendishness.
</P>

<P>
The two most probable locations for the suitcase containing the
documents are marked on the map with a red spot. Enter the room,
and shoot the guard inside. If the documents are there you`ll see a
little suitcase flash. leave the room and you`ll have the documents
in your hands.
</P>

<P>
Remember that the guards always patrol in a set pattern, and will
tend to go round and round the same block. Keep your eye on the
little map at the bottom of the screen to see where they go, and
then lie in wait for them. this applies to all the 3-d bits, so get
used to aiming and firing your gun before the guards spot and shoot
you.
</P>

<P>
The best tactics here are for one player to go and get the
documents, while the other takes care of the guards. If you`re
playing alone, then just go for the documents and try to avoid the
guards. Once you`ve got the suitcase, head out of the exit and into
the second scrolly bit.
</P>

<H3>THE INDUSTRY BUILDING</H3>

<P>
Ok, you`ve reached your second objective. This time you must find
and destroy tardiez`s drug supply and his stocks of filthy drug
money.
</P>

<P>
Again, the rooms to head for are marked with a red dot. Be careful,
as the guards will be patrolling those areas very heavily.
</P>

<P>
If playing two players, then it`s obviously better if you handle one
room each, whereas single players are going to have to be very
cautious.
</P>

<P>
To destroy the stocks, simply enter the room. There won`t be any
guards inside. Now press <FIRE> and you`ll throw a bomb into the
room.
</P>

<P>
Pop outside again. A couple of seconds later you`ll hear a big
boom, and your job is done. With both targets eliminated, head for
the exit and get ready for some more scrolly stuff.
</P>

<H3>THE CELLHOUSE</H3>

<P>
To get this bit, you'll have to do a bit of climbing (the doorways
are blocked). Simply stand in front of the building, push up and
fire to start climbing up the side.
</P>

<P>
Make sure you do it when there are no guards nearby or you will
probably be killed while you stand about swinging your grappling
hook.
</P>

<P>
The actual climbing bit couldn't be easier. Just waggle the
joystick to climb, but remember to avoid the searchlights. Once you
reach the top, you`re in!!
</P>

<P>
The actual cellhouse itself is the hardest 3-d section of all. Not
surprising when you realize that this time your target is miguel
tardiez.
</P>

<P>
Expect loads of guards, and watch out for them sneaking up on you
from behind! It`s best to split up for this bit as you`ve got a lot
of rooms to search.
</P>

<P>
You see, miguel is hiding in one of the cells. Unfortunately, there
are oodles of them to look through and his location appears to be
different in every game.
</P>

<P>
The best way of finding him is to start at the bottom of a corridor,
move forward one step, then turn left and enter the cell, go out,
turn round, and go into the other cell, come out, move forward
again, and so on.
</P>

<P>
It`ll take a while so it`s safest if you kill all the patrolling
guards before you start your search.
</P>

<P>
When you find tardiez, he`ll be lurking behind the scenery
somewhere, but you`ll know where he`s there cos there`ll be a
bodyguard in the cell.
</P>

<P>
Waste the bodyguard and out comes miguel with his hands up. Leave
the cell and he comes with you, in handcuffs. Go out of the exit
and you`ll leave miguel tied up on the roof.
</P>

<P>
Now you`ll have to absail down again. To do this, press fire to
slip down the wall and fire to stop again. Don`t slip too far or
you`ll die, and keep a look-out for the searchlight.
</P>

<H3>THE FINAL PIECE</H3>

<P>
You`re almost there now, with just the last mad dash to the
helicopter to go. This scrolly bit is fairly short, but there is a
rather fiendish explosive hidden in the scenery.
</P>

<P>
If you`re not careful you could be killed, so try and make sure
you`ve got enough lives left to compensate.
</P>

<P>
Once you see the chopper, run to it and you`ll take off. All you
have to do now is to stop off on the roof to pick Miguel up.
</P>

<P>
He`ll probably have tried to escape so run after him and he`ll come
hopping back. Leap back into the helicopter, and fly off into the
sunset for your mission analysis. Easy!
</P>
