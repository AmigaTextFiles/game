<H2>SOLVE</H2>

<H3>DAY 1</H3>

<P>
Gather as much information from Biff and Dusty on the first day, but
if you've got the information from previous games then don't worry,
as it doesn't change. Get into your car and go to the KBUG radio
station. Dusty will tell you of the latest ant attack to occur and
will give you a Geiger counter and a gun. Hang around for a while
until the afternoon, then go round to the Platt University lab,
where you will meet the boy Billy and his rather strange father.
When they start talking to you, ignore the gibberish that his dad
speaks but listen carefully to what Billy has to say. If you want
further information then try asking the fortune tellers and expect
to get home around eight o'clock.
</P>

<H3>DAY 2</H3>

<P>
Go out to the KBUG radio station again, where Dusty will tell you
about a threat from the G-men. Go back to the lab afterwards, where
Billy once again provides some useful information. At about one
o'clock go to Neptune Hall, where you'll find that Billy Bob has
managed to sprout a rather fetching set of antennae. Pull out your
gun and blast his antennae off. When he comes around he will give
you an important number, so make a note of it.
</P>

<H3>DAY 3</H3>

<P>
You should wake up at nine o'clock when Jakie comes round and knocks
on the door. Unfortunately, your early morning visitor is one of
the Ant- heads, so get the trusty old gun working and write down the
number again. Go to the Ore Plant and befriend the manager by
selecting choice A at the appropriate time. Take the train to
section M-3 and do the business against the ants, then get back to
the lab for some more useful info from Billy. Go to the Police
Station and get the old 'he must have tripped on his shoelace, your
honour' treatment so you get knocked unconscious. When you wake up,
the nurse will give you the position of the vault. Go to the vault
and get the records containing the conversion process, then make a
run for it.
</P>

<H3>DAY 4</H3>

<P>
Drop by Elma's and when he becomes an Anthead blast his stalk to get
the last number. Now you have all three numbers, try and get into
the hospital any way you can (preferably without injury). Get the
lift to the basement and find the morgue in the top right-hand
corner - you can spot it by the four black slabs and the safe.
Enter the numbers in the order you recieved them and you should be
able to get the secret documents which will cause the realisation of
the Antheads' existence, so now you can take them on face-to-face.
