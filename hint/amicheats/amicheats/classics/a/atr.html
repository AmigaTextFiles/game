<P>
In order to play the later tracks in two-player mode you first have
to reach them in a single-player game. Then lose a race and enter
your name as "ATR". Now go back to a two-player battle and you can
select any of the hidden tracks.
</P>

<P>
Go to battle mode and select Forest World. Choose track two and
race in a formula car. Let player one win all the races, and when
you get to the title screen, select battle mode again. You should
now be able to select the Space World.
