<P>
When the pink loading screen appears, hold down Caps Lock and type
"IMAGINE".
</P>

<P>
When the opening bit plays, type "PETEJOHNSONWANTSCHEAT". Now, when
you press S, it causes both exits to open, and you can go on to the
next screen without finishing it. 
</P>

<P>
Or, type "DALEY88" instead at the pink screen, and you can now
restart at the level you last died on!
</P>

<P>
While still on the title screen type in "TUESDAY 14TH" and when you
press the fire to start the game you will be presented with an
options screen that will allow you to obtain infinite lives, etc.
