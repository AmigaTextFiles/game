<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
Move alot! The enemies will not be able to hit you if you run
around the stage like a lunatic. Hold down the shift key (=run) as
much as possible.
</P>

<P>
It is important that you master the "strafe" technique! Preferably
use the "real" strafe keys, ie '.' and '/'. You could also use the
"force-strafe" technique 'RIGHT AMIGA', but then you will have to
keep up the fingerwork! Anyway, the important thing is for you to
take the corners, without loosing the view forward, to always be
prepared if an enemy should turn up and ruin you day. It is
possible if you use the "strafe" keys in the right way: eg, to take
a 90° corner to the left in a small corridor. When turning press
'CURSOR LEFT' and '/' at the same time, and you will slide around
the corner like never before! And the front-view was clear all the
time!
</P>

<P>
Configure the control so that it fits you perfectly! I for example
don't like jumping with '0', so I use '/' instead, since I think you
get much better control in the air that way! Furthermore I use
'DEL' and 'HELP' to look up or down! It is very personally how one
likes the controls. Experiment! The reward is perfect control over
the game, and maximum playability!
</P>

<P>
If the ammo or energy should run out play a couple of stages behind
you again, or start from scratch again! You will notice that you
have gained experince, and you will have fun playing stages you
before thought of as impossible. The result is more ammo and
health!
</P>

<P>
You have to learn every stage by heart, where the enemies are hiding
and how many they are. One tip is to start every new stage with
running and fooling around as far as possible (ie until you die) the
first times, to get a picture of the stage before taking on the task
of completing it. Make sure you know were the "big and bad" enemies
are, so that you don't get surpriced and loose control over the
situation.
</P>

<P>
Use the map! Let the map be your eyes when you cannot see whats
infront of you. The map can also reveal secret rooms (ie walls that
can be opened)! If you can't find a way of opening such a room,
it's probably not a bonus room, but a room filled with horrible
enemies that will open when you least expect it! (Never forget such
a room!)
</P>

<P>
If you think the game is to hard on you, you can play the 2MB
version! Ok, it might not be quite as good looking as the 4MB, but
it's easier. First of all the cool lightning effects dissapear and
the floors turn into one colour and everything gets lighter. All
this makes it easier to see what's in front of you! The best thing
though, is that the gray and the green robots gets exchanged with
only one type of robot. The blue (and easy) robots are all that is
left! This will make the game alot easier! The red robots with the
assualt rifles are still there though.
</P>

<P>
Secure the areas you have been to. You have to make sure 100% that
there are no enemies left behind! There is nothing worse than a red
rodent from behind when trying to fight a priest! Avoid fighting
against many enemies at once in a big open space. The best thing is
to fight one enemy in a small area where you are in full charge over
the situation!
</P>

<P>
The enemies can't shoot you though walls! It may sound obvious, but
it gives us the best technique when slaughering aliens. Around
corners! Use your strafe knowledges and take a peek around the
corner, shoot and then back again! Make sure you are using the
correct weapon, and be prepared to back if the alien should come to
close! Use the same technique with doors that are automaticly
closed! Often when you get hit by an enemy bullet, you are turned
around a random number of degrees. It is important to quickly
beeing able to straighten up and continue fighting in such a
situation.
</P>

<P>
The degree of difficulty is increasing until stage 8, to lower quite
a bit, and then increase again until stage 15, where it is really
difficult. When playing stage 15 you think that stage 3, wich is
very hard the first time, is a piece of meat!
</P>

<P>
When opening a door (or in any other way entering an unknown
territory) you should back out of it right away. Many aliens seem
to hear you and are standing there waiting for you! Back out
quickly and be ready to squeeze the trigger! If you come out of a
teleporter you can, when entering it, turn so that you come out of
it in the best possible angle!
</P>

<P>
The jetpack can take you to places never seen before. Experiment
and use the map to find bonus rooms! When flying you may look up or
down to get a better view.
</P>

<H3>WEAPONS</H3>

<P>
SHOTGUN:<BR>
A very good weapon. Make sure you always have ammo for the shotgun,
since it's needed everywhere in the game. Use the fact that the
bullets hit their targets immediatly, and that the weapon aims
automatically. Good "acute-weapon", ie have it ready when you don't
know what's in front of you.
</P>

<P>
PLASMA/TRIPPLE PLASMA:<BR>
Quite slow, but very powerful! Most efficiant in close up
situations. It mashes your opponent fast! Use the tripple plasma
in emergencies, when hords of enemies are attacking. This too is a
weapon you should always have ammunition for.
</P>

<P>
GRENADES:<BR>
Together with the rocket launcher this is the most powerful weapon.
Try to gather many aliens at one place then launch a grenade towards
them for maximum destruction. Beware of the explosion. It will
hurt you. If you look up or down you can controll the grenades
flight in a better way. Look up and the grenade will fly further
away.
</P>

<P>
ASSAULT RIFLE:<BR>
Like the shotgun, only much faster. The best place to use the
assault rifle is in small and narrow corridors where enemies rush
towards yo.
</P>

<P>
BLASTER:<BR>
Weak and slow weapon. Fits best when you can hit the baddies and
they cannot hit you. Since you often have a lot of ammo for this
gun it is recommended to use it when you need to save your other
ammo, or as a long distance weapon when it's hard to get a clean
hit!
</P>

<P>
ROCKET LAUNCHER:<BR>
Powerful and fast! Goes in a straight line until it hits a wall or
an enemy. Use it one the big and bad enemies. Be careful so that
you do not launch a round straight into the wall in front of you.
</P>

<P>
LASER/MEGA LASER:<BR>
It kills most things in its way, and it does it quickly. Play
Eraser and use the mega laser. Nothing survives! Unless the ammo
runs out. Save up and only use in emergencies! The laser bounces
on walls, which makes it a "tactics-weapon", with which you can
perform funny things. Observe: Mega laser is very fast, but not
the standard laser. This really makes them two different weapons
that are to be used differently!
</P>

<P>
MINES:<BR>
A powerful explosive with a delay. Best tactics: Run in front of a
door with hords of enemies behind that is automatically opened when
you pass, and put a mine there. Hopefully you will kill every
single baddie when they run out the door chasing you! Beware of the
explosion!
</P>

<H3>ENEMIES</H3>

<P>
ARNIE THE ALIEN:<BR>
Arnies favourite occupation is to gnaw and to howl! Give him a mine
to gnaw and he will stop howling. Seriusly, Arnie howls when he
sees you. If you can hear him, but not see him, turn around
quickly! Shoot him at long distances with the shotgun (one shot) or
with the assault rifle (two shots)! Don't let him come near you.
Sometimes he is impossible to hit when he is gnawing your leg.
</P>

<P>
TRICLAWS:<BR>
This modest little creature can be a real pain. Use the shotgun to
blow him away. But even though hotgun aims pretty goot, he can be
really hard to hit. If he comes to close to you he will eat up your
energy quickly. Beware of leaving one of these behind you -
eventually he will find you!
</P>

<P>
BLUE ROBOT:<BR>
There is not much to say about the blue aliens. Use as weak weapon
as possible (eg the blaster), to save up ammunition. Two shots from
the shotun is enough to kill the sucker. Use the strafe-technique
to avoid his shots.
</P>

<P>
GRAY ROBOT:<BR>
These have shotguns and are very dangerous, as they can hurt you the
moment they see you! Kill them fast. Use a powerful weapon if
needed.
</P>

<P>
GREEN ROBOT:<BR>
Not as dangerous as the gray, but quick! They shoot plasma-shots,
and many at a time! Use ie the shotgun at a far distance, and avoid
their shots by strafing sideways, or by using a corner.
</P>

<P>
RED ROBOT WITH HEADLIGHTS:<BR>
One of these can kill even the most skilled player! If you see the
corridor in front of you beeing lit up I suggest you RUN. The
robots have automatic weapons that will hit you at once. And they
shoot alot too! If you use the strafe-technique around a corner
together with a weak weapon, it is almost impossible to avoid beeing
hit! A wellthrown grenade, or maby a bazookashot, and you will come
home for dinner alive! If you stand in front of them, or try to
strafe in front of them, you will be a red spot on the floor in a
matter of seconds!
</P>

<P>
BLUE INSECT:<BR>
Like the blue aliens, only faster and they shoot more! At a very
close distance they can be really annoying, so make sure you shoot
them before the reach you! If you blow them full of lead they may
some times have difficulties shoting back at you!
</P>

<P>
YELLOW INSECT:<BR>
They shoot very quick, and their shots take a great deal of your
energy, as well as they spin you around 5.25 turns. Therefore you
will have to shoot them before they can manage to throw a couple of
rounds at you. Best put to death using a well aimed bazookashot!
</P>

<P>
RED INSECT:<BR>
Shoot plasmavballs, and lots of them if he sees you! Can only be
found on two stages - D and O.
</P>

<P>
FLOATING BALL OF JELLY WITH ARMS:<BR>
This one shoots plasmaballs at you, and you shound do the same thing
against it. They will quickly float towards you, so be prepared for
a closeup fight with lot of strafing. Watch out when you can't see
the one you where just chasing, he might be just above you!
</P>

<P>
KILLER BEES:<BR>
Can take a great deal of damage! And they are quick too. Try to
throw grenades towards them (look a bit up) and get a rythm. Plasma
does also work. If you get the right rythm, the bee cannot shoot
back. If not it will shot cascades of plasmaball towards you that
may be hard to avoid (although strafing works mostly).
</P>

<P>
INCA-PRIEST:<BR>
Dangerous fellows. They can shoot directly at you with no visible
bullet and the shot takes a temendous amont on your life! Best way
to avoid the shots is to stand in a narrow corridor, with the priest
outside in an open area. He may then have difficutlies aiming at
you. He will hit the wall instead. If he sees you he will shoot
directly! Take him out with the rocket launcher, or with grenades
if possible. Best though, is to avoid him completely and take
another way (although this is not possible most of the time).
</P>

<P>
SPIDERS:<BR>
Like the yellow insects, but more agressive and shoots cascades of
the powerful shots at you! There are only three of them in the
entire game, but thats enough for me. The first one is quite simple
to take out, but the next two are a bit more difficult! My
technique was: run, pull 20 mines (ie all I had at the time) out of
your pocket and put them on the ground after you, run, bazooka a
little here and a little there, waste all of you laser. In short:
find out new things to do until they are dead, or more likely: you
are dead.
</P>

<P>
THE BOSS:<BR>
The grean mean bastard in the end of the game. He will throw hords
of bazookashots at you if he sees you! Read more about him on the
last stage.
</P>

<H3>STAGES</H3>

<P>
LEVEL A:<BR>
This level shouldn't be too hard to manage. A good practice stage
before the real stages.
</P>

<P>
LEVEL B:<BR>
Now the degree of difficulty increases strikingly! I have heard of
many not making it beyond this stage. You must first take cover
somewhere. Run to the left at once, after killing the first robots.
You should come to a room in which you will find a robot and a
rodent. Kill them and wait for the enemies/carefully go back to
clean out the corridor. The next problem is the red robot. He
cannot go very far, so if you are a bit lucky you can quickly strafe
infront of him and then back out again to the "entrance" where he
cannot see you. If you stand infront of him he will splatter you,
so don't do so! You might want to use the map to orientate on this
stage. Remember that aliens like attacking from behind on stages
designed like this one.
</P>

<P>
LEVEL C:<BR>
Beware of the green jellyblobz that lure behind the door! Open it
and run like hell. They will probably come after you, so back of
and shoot when they are approaching. Strafe to avoid their
plasmaballs. From the blue room insects are pouring out! I think
that it's best to stand in the corridor before the room and blast
every so of a bitch that comes out of it. When nobody else is
coming you just walk into the room until yoou see some more and run
back to your hideout! Then we have the priest left. You better
avoid him completely. Stand in the corridor, so he can't shoot you.
When you see him walking around the pedestal (he will stop attacking
you!), wait a bit and then follow him. He can't see you - thus not
shoot you - if you keep to the opposite side of the pedestal. When
you are at the back of it, jump up and grab the key and RUN towards
the exit! Observe: Don't forget that there is a hidden door, and
behind it loads of goddies. It is to the right of the little
staircare inside the "maze".
</P>

<P>
LEVEL D:<BR>
The best teqnique is to try to gather every alien in a lump beneath
your ledge and give then a grenade to chew on. It is almost
impossible to not getting hit by the fire from the robots. When Mr.
Red appears you may either stay upon the ledge, and try to shoot him
when he pops up infront of you (it takes time. Watch out for him
bullets - he shoots quite a few), or run into the room and directly
left (watch out for the teleports), where a door has opened. Grab
the rocket launcher and blow him into small red slimy alienparts.
</P>

<P>
LEVEL E:<BR>
Good, You made it here! Now things get harder. First of all, don't
wait for the red robots. Instead quickly jump over the ravine. Get
rid of all the trash and grab the first key. Now go stand next to
the door that is furthest away from the starting point, with the
yellow insects behind. Open the door and step aside. Be ready with
the bazooka. Fire if you should see an enemy. You don't have any
time to think, so don't stand still too long, or you'll be barbeque!
Don't waste your ammo, especially not on one of the triclaws, which
are also in the room. Repeat the "sidestepping" procedure until all
the three insects are dead. You'll now get the next key. In the
next room you will find a door that is automatically opened when you
pass infront of it. Behind are loads of enemies that pour out of
it. You should run infront of this door and place a mine outside.
With any luck you'll kill all of the enemies in one big blam! After
this shoot the yellow insects with the bazooka, and locate the
switch. Just beside this is a secret room filled with goddies!
Pull the switch and seek cover in the secret room. From here you
can fairly simple kill the two priests with grenades!
</P>

<P>
LEVEL F:<BR>
After the first teleporter run to the "room". Stay here and try to
kill the enemies. They will come to you! When finished go to the
next teleporter, but continue straight on, and then up the wall
using the jetpack, and you'll find a nice place. In the labyrinth
you should use the assault rifle. Learn to orientate and use the
map. There are two red ones that may cause trouble, and an extra
one in one of the rooms!
</P>

<P>
LEVEL G:<BR>
When you've shot the first robot his buddies come to the rescue, and
they're red of anger. Make sure you quickly run to the
ventilator-systems (duck to get through), don't care about the
buddies. Go and shoot the generators, but don't get down in the
lava - you won't get up again! You can then relatively easy kill
alot of aliens from the tunnels. In the "last" room, shoot the
green jelly things before you open their doors when pulling the
switch! the last key is located on a ledge in the room closest to
the switch. Fly up there!
</P>

<P>
LEVEL H:<BR>
Look out in to the freedom for one nanasecons, and then avait the
enemies. Kill them all from the "startroom". The bees has alot of
stamina. Use the grenades and try to paralyse them! If you are
very short of ammo, you could start the stage with running out and
gathering as much as possible from the middle of the yard, and then
return home to the "base". There is alot to pick up on the stage.
Search carefully!
</P>

<P>
LEVEL I:<BR>
Now thing get a bit easier! Start off with walking straight forward
as much as possible. There are no enemies in the first part of the
stage. There are alot of rodents here, so use the shotgun of
assault rifle and make sure to kill every sucker before advancing!
Don't just walk in to a big room. Instead stand at a distance and
try to blow the enemies to hell, also, let them come to you !
Carefully search for small, and maby hidden paths. There are quite
a few of them. Eg at the end of the stage, where you are about to
jump over some walls, you can pull down a BIG wall, and in that way
avoiding confrontation with some real bad guys! This is a stage
where yo ushould try to avoid as much as possible!
</P>

<P>
LEVEL J:<BR>
Take out the red robots with a grenade or the bazooka, otherwise you
may get in trouble. When you take the green key, a door very close
by opens and a red one gets out. Put a mine in front of the door
before you quickly take the key! In the "elevatorroom", kill the
insect with a basookashot, aim carefully. In the same place there
is a "jelly", that seems to be stuck behind an elevator. Either you
will have to wait him out, which may take a while, or just ignore
him! With a little luck he won't see you! In the second part of
the stage the plasma gun is prefered. Don't forget the hidden room
with the medipac. Not to forget too is the water, that's a sight
you won't see everyday!
</P>

<P>
LEVEL K:<BR>
This is one of the hardest levels in the game! The stage is too
symetrical, and thus it's very hard finding your way around it!
Draw a map with all the rooms, keys and the way of doing everything,
or have a look at mine below! Be careful, as soon as you take a
key, new doors open and enemies ooze out. Be extra careful when you
teleport somewere. The green key in the oval in the middle can be
tricky the first time. Run arond the big square in the middle once
and the key will appear! The three priests you kill with alot of
bazooka shots. You should stay and await the enemies in most rooms
after taking a key. You will loose a lot of energy on this stage,
but don't give up. You can complete it with a bit of practice, and
some luck on top of it!Just make sure you always know where all the
bad guys are
</P>

<P>
LEVEL L:<BR>
This is a battlearena! Start with collecting the ammunition and
medipacs (ofcourse), and then go and try to shoots as many slimy
aliens as possible from your legde. Beware of bullets from far far
away. When you think you've mashed enough enemies, jump down and
run around shooting everything that's moving. Now go for the tough
bit. Place yourself on one of the platforms that are right next to
the big one in the middle. You should now be halfway up compared to
the one in the middle. Up there are two red robots and one
spider(!). They can hardly ever see you where you stand right now!
Quickly jump up into the slime. If you think you see an enemy right
in front of you, fire a bazooka and something towards it! With any
luck you'll hit the sucker. Time for a quick retreat! Stay down
until the shots fired at you have all passed, and then repeat the
procedure again until all three are dead. Never stay in the slime!
You'll get badly hurt either by the enemies, or by the slime! The
exit is in a tunnel in the middle of the slime. It will not open
until all enemies are dead.
</P>

<P>
LEVEL M:<BR>
You can avoid large part of this stage by doing it in this way:
Star with going into the slime, straigh ahead to the right. Here
are two important things. A teleporter and a key. The key might be
hard to find. When walking around, look up for a tunnel into the
wall above you. When you've got the green key, teleport back and go
into one of the tunnels right after the slime. You'll get a yellow
key. Now head back to the start position and go straigh ahead to
the left. Here are two doors with yellow insects behind, that opens
by pressure sensitive buttons in the floor. If you sneek right next
to the left wall all the time you can avoid opening these doors!
Take the red key, and walk back to the room before the slime. Here
is the "exclamation mark" key to the right. Now you can open the
door that is straigh to the right from the start position. Beware
of the priest! Never bother going to the left from the start, there
are only trouble in there. By The Way: Charge up the jetpack
before you exit the level. You'll need it soon!
</P>

<P>
LEVEL N:<BR>
Pretty tough stage, but there is a way of cheating: if you have a
fully charged jetpack you can avoid big parts of the stage! In the
"silo" you shall fly up to the to ledges. Otherwise you would have
had to activate the elevator in the silo, and that requires more
rooms to visit. With a little training I don't think this stage
should cause any trouble. You should do the stage this way (in
order to "cheat"): Start with cleaning out the enemies that are
rushing from the tunnel infront of you. The go down into the silo.
Kill the baddies and teleport up again. Now fly to the higher ledge
of the two in the silo. Take everything. Go down into the silo
again and take everything here aswell. Now fly up to the lower of
the ledges, and once again grab all that you see. Now go straight
ahead from the start, detroy the communication-centre, and wander on
the next level!
</P>

<P>
LEVEL O:<BR>
A very hard stage! There are four directions to choose from from
the starting point:
</P>

<P>
TWO SPIDERS:<BR>
No tactics here, just run and waste all of your power-weapons. You
will loose alot of energy here, and most often die. Thats why you
should take this one first!
</P>

<P>
TWO KILLER BEES:<BR>
The bees are a bit tricky. Run around alot like a lonantic until
they are both down at your level, otherwise they will hurt you alot.
Try to cocentrate on one at a time, and paralyse him. With one dead
there should not be to much fuzz about destroying the other one.
</P>

<P>
TWO KILLER INSECTS:<BR>
In this room you'll bump in to two red insects, like the one at
stage four. This means that they are really quick and they shoot
alot. Run to the left or right and in to a teleporter. You'll
appear at the teleporter on the other side. Stay and wait until you
see an insect, fire a couple bullets and then quick into the
teleporter again, otherwise you'll get hurt. Repeat this until the
two are blown away. Go down into the slime and destroy the
communication-centre to get out of the unplesant place!
</P>

<P>
LOTSA RODENTS:<BR>
This is the easy one of the four. To get to the ending you will
have to choose the right teleporter, otherwise you'll teleport to
the beginning again. This is the right way:
</P>

<P>
"Forward - Left - Right"<BR>
"Forward - Left - Left"<BR>
"Forward"<BR>
"Forward - Left"<BR>
"Forward - Right"<BR>
"Forward - Left"
</P>

<P>
You should do the stage in this order. After every part you'll
receive a key in the middle of the stage! After four keys you are
ready for the final stage!
</P>

<P>
LEVEL P:<BR>
This stage is "square circular". Keep to the outer limits. Try to
get our green friends attention, and make him follow you round,
round. Walk backwards, and always be "one length" infront of him.
If you do the right thing, you will always be at a corner and you
will see him coming round the corner "over there". He will fire at
you, and yo uat him. Use the bazooka and fire one or two times.
Back around your corner and run to the next one. Await him and
repeat it all over again, until he is spacegarbage! Then you kill
the four priest that like tho hang around in the middle of the
stage. Use every signle piece or heavy weaponry you've got, after
all, these are the last enemies you are to eliminate! When they are
gone, walk into the newly opened door.
