<P>
Within each version of the Amiga's operating system there are some
messages left behind by the Amiga development team. Methods of
finding and viewing these messages vary with each version of the
operating system you're running. You may find some of these take two
people to do.
</P>

<H3>WORKBENCH 1.x</H3>

<P>
The AmigaDOS 1.x secret messages give thanks to the original Amiga
development team.
</P>

<P>
NOTE: you need Workbench 1.2 to see the key-sequences, but they are
in both the 1.2 and 1.3 Kickstart ROMs.
</P>

<P>
Reboot your computer and make sure that the Workbench screen is
active. Have one person hold down both sets of Shift and Alt keys
on the keyboard. Then press and hold each of the function keys in
turn. A different message will appear for each key.
</P>

<P>
Here are the messages that each key gives:
</P>

<P>
'F1' -- "System Software: Carl, Neil & Kodiak"<BR>
'F2' -- "Graphics Software: Dale, Bart, Jim & =RJ="<BR>
'F3' -- "QA: Jon, Bruce, Stan, Kim & Jerry "<BR>
'F4' -- "LG Support: Caryn, Dave, Victor, Terry, Cheryl & Nancy"<BR>
'F5' -- "CBM software: Andy, Barry, Dave & Eric"<BR>
'F6' -- "Pics: Sheryl & Jack"<BR>
'F7' -- "Docs: Rick, Mitch, Peggy & Rob"<BR>
'F8' -- "Chips: Jay, Akio, Glenn, Edwin, Mark & Dave"<BR>
'F9' -- "HW: Dave, Bill, ChrisR & Josh"<BR>
'F10' - "Moral Support: Joe Pillow & The Dancing Fools"
</P>

<P>
You might also try popping a disk in and out of DF0: while holding
down the above key sequence. Early versions of amigaDOS 1.2 (the
enhancer kit shipped for the A1000) contained a rather vicious dig
at Commodore from the original Amiga programmers that would appear
when you ejected the disk. Later 1.2 releases with the A500 and
A2000 were toned down to the compliment "The Amiga, Born a Champion".
</P>

<P>
While holding the above combination of keys down click the 'left
mouse button' on the 'screen to back gadget' and re-insert the disk.
</P>

<P>
If you have WB 1.2 you'll see: "We made Amiga, They fucked it up"
</P>

<P>
If you have WB 1.3 you'll see: "Still a Champion"
</P>

<H3>WORKBENCH 2.x</H3>

<P>
A clue was mysteriously sent from within Commodore (then
owner/developer of the Amiga) to Dennis Atkin, author of the book
"Denny Atkin's Best Amiga Tips And Secrets". The clue read "Control
the alternate menus to shift into an enlightened state." Can you
figure out how to see the messages from the clue? I doubt it.
</P>

<P>
Here's what to do. First, click on the Workbench window with the
left mouse button to activate it. Now, press and hold down the Ctrl
key, both Alt keys, and both Shift keys. While holding those keys
down use the mouse to select any of the Workbench menu items. Then
release the keys and choose 'Last message' from the Workbench menu.
You'll see a secret message. Repeat this for every Workbench menu
item, each has its own message.
</P>

<H3>WORKBENCH 3.x</H3>

<P>
Two more mysterious notes were sent to Denny for AmigaDOS 3.
</P>

<P>
Clue #1: Control is given to those who are shifted four from the
start and do not give up on the alternate course.
</P>

<P>
Clue #2: When it is about time to learn the secrets of the master,
one must also qualify for the enlightenment.
</P>

<P>
Couldn't figure it out? Don't feel bad. This one is tough.
</P>

<P>
First, the technical description: The messages show up when the
About menu item is selected while the Ctrl, Shift, and Alt keys are
being held down and the Workbench Open count turns 16 due to the
requester appearing.
</P>

<P>
Here's the procedure in plain english:
</P>

<OL>
<LI>Boot your Amiga. If you have many Workbench tools (such as
AppIcons) running, You may end up being past 16 already, so you may
have to shut some of them down.
<LI>Press and hold down the right mouse button.
<LI>Press and hold down the Ctrl, left-Shift, left-Alt, right-Shift,
and right-Alt keys.
<LI>Select "About" from the Workbench menu.
<LI>Move the About window aside (don't close it!), click on the
Workbench window again, and repeat from step 2. Within 15 tries, a
different About box should open. If this does not happen, you may
have the Workbench.library open too many times. To make this work,
reboot without running the startup sequence, start Workbench (using
the LoadWB command), and try again.
