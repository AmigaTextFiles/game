<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
The evil Wizard has turned you into an Airball - with a slow
airleak. You must search over 300 rooms to find the spellbook,
which contains the ingredients needed to turn you back into a human.
Hurry, before you run out of air.
</P>

<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
You can locate the spellbook in the room that also contains the
candle. You must pick up and remove the blocks to get to it. With
spellbook in hand go back to the starting screen and drop the book
in the top left corner. Then follow the instructions you are given
to find the ingredients needed to finish the game.
