<H2>SECRET ROOMS</H2>

<P>
On level one go through the first door as usual. Then go to the
far right bottom and jump up to go through a secret wall to get
a special weapon, then exit. When you re-appear, jump on the
spring at the bottom left and just as you start flying upwards push
up so that you hit an invisible block with a door on it. Now go to
the right across the floating platforms, but instead of going
through the door as normal, stand on the edge above the door and
fire the weapon. Another invisible block should appear jump on
this block. Then jump up left and walk across the top of the
screen to the first secret block and go through the door and you
will enter a secret warp room.
