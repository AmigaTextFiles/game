<P>
Start off in the screen 'Statue of your hero'. You will see a statue
the same as yourself, all in green but bigger. On top of your statue
there is an enemy. Go to the tree on your right and climb to the
height of the enemy and shoot, make sure you hit him first. As soon
as he is dead his arrow will disappear so don't worry about dodging
that.
</P>

<P>
Get out of the tree and head left. Once you are in the second screen
climb up the ladder which will be just infront of you and shoot the
enemy at the top of the brown thing. Then press the left Amiga key
and you will be transported to the black object on top of a brown
square thing. This is meant to be a boulder (so the author says).
Shoot it and the two enemys will die. The 'magic' bolder that
doesn't move, roles on them apparently. Although I think it was more
that the author couldn't program the bolder to move.
</P>

<P>
Go into the next screen going left, you will see an enemy accross
the gap and a ladder going down. Go down the ladder and keep going
left until you are in the next screen. Drop down and stay still. As
soon as an arrow has fired past go left slightly until you drop a
little bit and then shoot. You will kill the enemy and his arrow
won't harm you! This is probably the hardest part of the game so
make sure you get it right. Once he is dead proceed left and drop
down.
</P>

<P>
Once you have dropped go right (it doesn't matter about the red
stuff it doesn't kill you) and go down a ladder, then keep going
right through two empty screens. The screen with the steps is the
screen before the enemy. Go through and shoot stright away. Then
goto the wizard and he will transport you to the castle.
</P>

<P>
At the castle doors press down or the cursor down key. Inside the
castle go left and up the ladder. Shoot the enemy and go right to
the top then pull right comming off the ladder. Get close to the
enemy and shoot him, then turn around and shoot him again. Then go
left and shoot him again. Keep going left and shooting him until he
gets to the left edge of the screen, shoot him once more and he will
die. The game is now complete and your castle is turned back into a
castle from straw.
