<P>
In two-player mode, after your opponent fouls in US pool, grab the 
cue ball and before you take your shot, push it in between two
other balls that are that are close together on the table, so that
the cue ball touches both of the other balls. This nudges the
balls a bit and if thay are in the right place you could set
yourself up a treat, or ruin your friend's plans. The computer
players don't mind, but your friend will.
</P>

<P>
In Speed Pool, put all of the balls apart from one, then line the
last one with the pocket. Select SAVE, then NEW to start with one
ball left on 0 minutes and 00 seconds.
