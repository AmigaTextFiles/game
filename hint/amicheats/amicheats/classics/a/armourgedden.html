<H2>CHEATS</H2>

<P>
When in the HQ, access the messages screen. Move the arrow so it
points to the first letter of the message highlighted in yellow.
Now hold down 'ESC' and press the LEFT MOUSE BUTTON. The message
{YOU WOULDN`T LET IT LIE} should appear. This indicates that the
cheat mode is active. You now have invincible craft and infinite
supplies of fuel and firepower. To turn the cheat mode off (you
need to do this to complete the game), simply access the message
screen again, point at the first letter of the message highlighted
in yellow, press and hold down 'ESC' and press the LEFT MOUSE
BUTTON. The message {LOOK AT THE SIZE OF THAT SAUSAGE!} should
appear. The cheat mode is de-activated.

Armourgedden also has an object editor. To enter it, use the mouse
to move the arrow to the top left hand corner of the secondary

verticle line. The keys to use are; 'F9' zoom in, 'F10' zoom out,
numeric keypad brackets rotate object, numeric keypad '7' and '8'
also rotate. Cursor left previous object, cursor right next
object, press 'ESC' to exit.
