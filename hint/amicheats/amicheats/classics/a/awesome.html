<H2>CHEATS</H2>

<P>
To become indestructable, gain infinite money and fuel, complete the
first attack level. When the shields/weapons screen appears, move
the cursor to the top left corner of the screen. This will place it
in the shields box. Now press 'FIRE' while hitting '+' on the
keypad. The screen will flash, indicating that the cheat mode has
been activated. If the screen does not flash, keep pressing 'FIRE'
and hitting '+' simulataneously. It will work eventually. Now
transfer all the energy to the weapons. Shields can still be
drained by hits and colliding with objects, but once it reaches 000,
the ship can not be destroyed.
