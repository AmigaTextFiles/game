<H2>TIPS</H2>

<H3>100M SPLASH</H3>

<P>
Run along the top of the water, then jump over the pelican. He will
fly off, then come back and carry you over half the course. If you
knock all three toucans off, two pelicans will carry you in turn.
In one-player mode, don't start running, just let the penguin kick
you until you fall into the water. This will give you a 10,000
point bonus and reset your time.
</P>

<H3>Juggling</H3>

<P>
Simply rotate the joystick madly to juggle all five balls.
</P>

<H3>Shell-Shooting</H3>

<P>
Go to the right, wait and then jump on the jelly limpet. He will
then catapult you through the roof where there is a king limpet,
bonuses and limpet mines.
</P>

<H3>Bouncy Castle</H3>

<P>
A forward or backward somersault followed by a twist will give you a
spring box. Use this to gain greater height. Do a twist at the top
of your jump to go through the roof for bonuses.
</P>

<H3>Long Jump</H3>

<P>
Make the jump and keep waggling while in the air for greater
distance. If you get a really long jump, prepare for a surprise...
</P>

<H3>Unicycle</H3>

<P>
The trick here is to rotate the joystick slowly and steadily instead
of maniacally.
</P>

<H3>Feeding Time</H3>

<P>
If the butterfly hits the fish, you will get a 1,000 point bonus.
Time throwing sweets to the fish so that you trap the butterfly
between the fish for a bonus.
</P>

<H3>Kipper Watching</H3>

<P>
Leave the clock and let it ring for a large bonus - watch the seals
though.
</P>
