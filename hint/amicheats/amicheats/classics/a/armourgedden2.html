Access the Equip screen, now move the mouse pointer to the top left
corner of the screen and press both mouse buttons and the 'Esc' key
simultaneously. You will now be returned to the Messages screen and
it will read "PYSGY GAME TESTERS MODE ON". The cheat is now active.
Repeating the above process a second time will produce the message
"SOMEBODY HAS TO PLAY IT FOR REAL" and thus turning the cheat off.
