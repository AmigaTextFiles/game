<H2>SOLVE</H2>

<P>
Before you start to play this adventure, read the documentation
thoroughly so that you have an idea of what is going on and who you
are.
</P>

<P>
The game itself is very strange. There are actually very few
problems. A lot of the adventure is a mapping exercise!
</P>

<H3>PART ONE</H3>

<P>
You start the adventure just after your awakening, being told by
Perelman that the simulation to test the plan can begin soon. Note
the various communications outlets at your disposal.
</P>

<P>
"PEOF"; you are now in Perelman's office. "Wait" till Perelman says
you can now enter simulation mode. The Social Science group wants
you to record several things which are listed for you. "Enter
simulation"; use the code wheel from the packaging and you find
yourself 10 years in the future in Kennedy Park.
</P>

<P>
This first section is to familiarise yourself with recording and
also to let you map the area. This map will form the basis for
other future simulations. In some cases, there are several ways to
record the information required in this simulation eg eating a meal
in a restaurant, as there are several you can visit. If your record
buffer should fill before you have recorded everything you want,
just "abort, PEOF, ask Perelman to look at recordings" and when he
returns, he will tell you want else he wants recorded.
</P>

<P>
The recording required are as follows:
</P>

<OL>
<LI>Eating a meal in a restaurant. Go to one, eg Roy's Pagoda.
"Record on, buy meal, record off".
<LI>Talking to a government official. Go to City Hall, "record on,
talk to official, record off".
<LI>Visiting a power-generating facility. Go into the power
station, "record on, look, record off".
<LI>Reading a newspaper. Go to Bodanski Square, "buy newspaper,
record on, read newspaper, record off".
<LI>Riding some form of public transportation. Go down into the
tube system, wait till a tubecar arrives. "Record on, enter
tubecar, wait" till the tubecar stops, "leave tubecar, record off".
<LI>Attending a court in session. Go into the court. "Record on,
look, record off".
<LI>Talking to a church official. Go into a church eg St Michael's,
"record on, talk to elder, record off".
<LI>Going to a movie. Go to the cinema , "record on, buy ticket,
in, record off".
<LI>Visiting your own home or living quarters. "Inventory, open
wallet, read licence"; you now know your address is Parkview
Appartments, Southway. Go there, "unlock door, w, unlock door,
record on, n, look, record off".
</OL>

<P>
"Abort, PEOF, ask Perelman to look at recordings". So long as you
have recorded all the things required, he will tell you that the
experts are pleased and it looks as though the Plan will be adopted.
As a result of your recordings, more accurate simulations will be
possible in future.
</P>

<H3>PART 2</H3>

<P>
At the start of this section, you will be asked to do some psych
tests. This is just a bit of fun, the answers don't mean anything
so you can reply whatever you want!
</P>

<P>
In a while, Perelman tells you the plan has been recommended for
full adoption in a few weeks. But he says he has a funny feeling
about it. If you "enter simulation mode" now, you can go to either
10 or 20 years into the future. So go into 20 (2051).
</P>

<P>
If you have a look around, you will see several things have changed
and the situation seems to be deteriorating. Record anything like
this that you can see and every so often, return and show them to
Perelman. If he wants more recordings, go back into the simulation.
Some things you can do are: "look" at Rockvil Reformatory, talk to
the elder in the church, read a newspaper. Go to the old station,
it is now the Church of God's Word. "Look" there and read the
pamphlet. Visit the soup kitchen, Heiman's World, the police
station, your own appartment. Go to Huang Hall, the city dump,
skycar factory, courthouse.
</P>

<P>
When you have spent enough time in the simulation and recorded
enough, you will find a new simulation, 30 years into the future, is
available. Do the same here (2061). Some useful recording for 2061
are: spend some time in your appartment and have a good look round,
the soup kitchen, the city dump, the skycar factory, Church Street
Park, the Health Centre, the church, read the pamphlet in the Church
of God's Word, visit the school, the stadium, the reformatory and
Huang Hall. Go to Kennedy Park and the airport terminal. Various
incidents also happen on the streets.
</P>

<P>
In a similar way, spending time and recording enough here will open
a 40 year simulation into 2071. Again, record changes and things
that happen in the street. Visit your appartment, the zoo, read the
banner in the zoo, go to the aquarium, fire station, stadium, bank,
athletic field, airport, cinema.
</P>

<P>
These are just some of the places you can go in each simulation.
Eventually, Perelman asks you to visit the last simulation in 2081,
50 years in the future, to see if everything turns around. This
simulation is very small and dangerous. Go into the inn, onto the
bridge over the river, examine the sack there, get eaten by dogs, or
killed when you enter certain locations. Show these recordings to
Perelman. He says the plan must be cancelled and he's going to
Washington!
</P>

<H3>PART 3</H3>

<P>
At the start of this section, you're informed that a WNNF device is
about to be added to your auxiliary systems and will be online in 4
or 5 hours. Perelman returns and tells you that he's been accused
of faking the recordings. He goes to meet some colleagues. There
is also a message given to you that the complex has been sealed for
security reasons.
</P>

<P>
"PEOF" and "wait" in Perelman's office. When Ryder enters, "record
on"; you make a recording of him threatening Perelman. Then
Perelman is taken away.
</P>

<P>
Now go to the roof with "RCRO". "Wait" till some men arrive.
"Enter interface mode" and "HVAC controller, turn off ventilation in
delta sector". "Enter communications mode, MACO"; in a while, the
men arrive and start working on one of the conditioning units that
house your brain. Eventually, the build up of fumes caused by you
turning off the ventilation causes them to pass out. This saves you
from being killed.
</P>

<P>
Now wait till the WNN feeder is active (check by entering interface
mode and looking at the active ports). When it is, "WNN feeder,
transmit record buffer, enter communication mode, WNNF"; you see
your recording of Ryder threatening Perelman being broadcast, thus
discrediting Ryder and his Plan!
</P>

<P>
Wait till Perelman contacts you telling you Ryder has fled. The
plan has been cancelled and you're a hero!
</P>

<P>
You now have one final simulation to enter and enjoy...
</P>
