<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Archipelagos is an action-strategy game where the players goals are
to destroy readioactive nodes and obelisks in an effort to make the
Earth inhabitable for humans. But the quest is hindered by wandering
necromancers, waste patches and malfunctioning air sweepers.
</P>

<H2>CHEATS</H2>

<P>
Finish the first two archipeligos and hit 'RETURN' to select
another.
</P>

<P>
Type "8421" and hit 'RETURN' twice. You can now go
wherever you want. (Possibly do it after booting.)
</P>

<P>
Enter "1" to "999" followed by 'RETURN' key to select island.
</P>

<P>
Firstly, you have to remember that all the minion rocks have to be
connected by land to the monolith. This doesn't have to be a direct
route, but just so that you can trace a path from rock to obelisk
without crossing water. The easiest way to do this is, when
searching for the stones, not to jump over the small stretches of
water you come across. Deposit a bit of land and then cross. That
way, before you know it, you've linked all the islands in the
archipelago.
</P>

<P>
Something else worth remembering is that the stones are widely
spaced. You don't have a time limit finding them, so wander around
for a bit. Note the position of the stone nearest the monolith and
destroy this one last. That makes your job of destroying the
monolith within the 90 second time limit a bit easier.
</P>

<P>
Now for a couple of odds and ends. The easiest way to get rid of
the necromancer is to build a piece of land, about three squares
long and one wide, jutting out from the coastline just before where
the necromancer will strike. He will teleport to another section of
land, after a delay. The lost souls are indestructible, so give
them a wide berth. Don't worry about running out of energy when
creating land, as the energy rocks are in abundance. Finally try
and find the blood eggs before they hatch. When they burst they
spread their poison to the whole lot of the connected islands, even
through the sand as well as the land connections.
