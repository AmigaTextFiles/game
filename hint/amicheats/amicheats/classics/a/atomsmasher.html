<H2>CHEATS</H2>

<P>
Type 'CATHERINE ZETA JONES' on the titlescreen and it'll say
{Ready}. Now start the game as normal and try pressing the
following keys:
</P>

<P>
'S'-----------------------Skip levels<BR>
'L'---Toggle infinite lives on or off<BR>
'I'--Toggle invulnerability on or off
</P>

<H2>LEVEL EDITOR</H2>

Type 'ZANDALEE' for the level editor. Here is how it works:
</P>

<P>
'ESC'-----------------Return to the main menu<BR>
'DEL'-------Totally clears the selected depth<BR>
'M'--Toggle between "block" and "baddie" mode<BR>
'[' & ']'------Toggle through existing levels<BR>

</P>

<H2>DESIGNING A MAZE</H2>

<P>
Each level consists of 3 layers, and pressing 'D' will go through
them. Depth 0 is where the backgrounds are designed, depth 1 is
where the ice, mud and mines go, and depth 2 is where you actually
design the maze. On depth 2, pressing the 'SPACEBAR' takes you to
the block select screen, where you can select any block by pressing
the fire button on your joystick. This then puts you in {block}
mode (which appears at the bottom right of the screen) where you
can place the block by pressing fire again.
</P>

<H2>PLACING CHARACTERS</H2>

<P>
Select depth 2 and press 'M' to go into "baddie" mode. Position
both players by pressing '1' and '2' at the desired position. You
can toggle through the baddies using the comma ',' and full-stop
'.' keys, and can place them using fire, or replace existing
baddies by first selecting the space, and then adding your
preference. Baddie characteristics can be changed by placing the
cursor over it and then using the arrow keys:
</P>

<P>
'Up'---------------------Increase baddie speed<BR>
'left'--Decrease rate the baddies drop hazards<BR>
'Right'-Increase rate the baddies drop hazards<BR>
 ---- (from 01 (fastest) to 99 (slowest) ----<BR>
 --- (00 means it'll never drop anything) ---<BR>
'Down'---------------Increase drop speed by 10
</P>

<P>
Pressing '9' will change the speed at which the baddies will then
appear. Once you've placed all the initial baddies, pressing
'RETURN' takes you onto the "que" screen, where you can place up to
50 replensished ones. Pressing '0' will change the time between
these baddies appearing. Any new levels can now be saved on a
blank disk by returning to the main menu and selecting the save
option.
