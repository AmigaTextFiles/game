<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Become the pilot of a realistic but playable F-16 simulation.
Controls, heads-up display, and radar conform to current avionics of
the F-16A. Game includes twelve missions which vary from air to
ground bombing runs to dogfighting up to three enemy MIGs at a time.
The most outstanding feature is the ability to go head-to-head
against an opponent on a second Amiga. Advance from 1st Lt. to
Colonel with increasing abilities such as the Immelmann, yo-yo's,
loops, and scissors. Incorporates real action sounds, including
engine start-up, machine gun, missile launch. Four cockpit views and
three tower views, zoom-in and zoom-out features. So realistic,
Falcon is being used in a military aircrew training program.

<P>
If your ammo runs low, press 'CTRL' and 'X' during the game and 
watch the extra 500 rounds and 9 sidewinders clock up on the
instruments. It maybe 'CTRL', 'L SHIFT', and 'X'. For a perfect
landing, hold the 'HELP' key down about 10 to 20 feet above the
runway.
</P>

<P>
If you get badly hit, don't bail out, instead swing round and head
for home. Press 'HELP' and the '+' on the keypad and keep them
depressed. The F16 will stay level and drop down. Switch to
tracking mode and rotate to side view. Just before touch down,
pitch up the nose and the plane will touch down successfully every
time. Select "end mission" and you will be rescued even if you are
in enemy territory.
