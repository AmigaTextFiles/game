<P>
On the menu selection, hold down 'CTRL' and 'C' to interupt the
program. Now enter "AI=AI+500000" and press 'RETURN'. Now type
"CONT" and press 'RETURN'. This adds 500,000 credits to your current
amount.
</P>

<P>
Here's a way of starting the game with lots of money.
</P>

<P>
Copy the game onto another disk - files are going to be changed so
don't use the original. Boot up the copy as normal, clicking on the
'FD II' and 'BOOT.BAS' icons as they appear.
</P>

<P>
Enter the game as normal. When it's up and running, select the
'QUIT' option from the Main selection of the pull down menu. A CLI
window now appears. Type "list" to list the 'FOOT.BAS' part of the
game.
</P>

<P>
Using the cursor keys, edit the program lines 1514 and 2547 to read
as follows :
</P>

<CODE>
1514 NEXT<BR>
NW=150+INT(RND*200)<BR>
NW=INT(NW/AP)<BR>
NV=200+INT(RND*300)<BR>
NV=INT(NV/AP)<BR>
AI=5000000pound sign+INT(RND*(500000pound sign/AP))<BR>
NF=(5000+INT(RND*3000))/AP<BR>
NP=INT(NP+NA+NF)<BR>
GOTO 332
</P>

<P>
2547 GOSUB 2548<BR>
IF RA=9 AND AI>300000pound sign OR AI>1500000pound sign THEN ]2547<BR>
GOTO 2548<BR>
]2547: RA=INT(AI/5000)<BR>
PRINT TAB(5);<BR>
PA5<BR>
PRINT "DIRECTORS WITHDRAW";<BR>
PA1	    "<BR>
PRINT TAB(30);<BR>
MONEY INT(RA)<BR>
PRINT TAB(38);"-"<BR>
JR=JR-RA
</CODE>

<P>
In line 1514 making AI equal 5,000,000 provides $5M starting budget;
this can be changed to suit, however Line 2547 making
RA=INT(AI/5000) stops the directors from withdrawing too much cash
every week.
</P>

<P>
Click on the 'close window' icon for the window containing the
program text, and save the amended program file by typing: save
"FOOT.BAS"
</P>

<P>
To run the amended disk, boot up the disk as normal, by clicking on
the FD II icon. When the BOOT.BAS icon is clicked the message BAD
FILE MODE appears. Accept this by using the OK box.
</P>

<P>
Close the CLI window containing the few lines of text, by clicking
on the close window icon.
</P>

<P>
Type "load". A message box appears prompting for the name of the
program to load. Using <LEFT MOUSE> click on the text bar and type
this: FOOT.BAS
</P>

<P>
When the OK message appears, type "RUN". The program should now
start as normal with plenty of dosh to spend.
