<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Take a satiric, twisted visit to the circus with this arcade-style
game, which uses slapstick humor and superior cartoon-style
animation. Take center ring on the trapeze or in five other events,
but look out for Fiendish Freddy, the cynical circus saboteur who
will thwart you at every turn.
</P>

<H2>TIPS</H2>

<H3>PHENOMENAL FEATS OF DIVING DARING (HIGH DIVING)</H3>

<P>
If you don't want to be flat and miss the water with a splat just
keep the autofire on all the way down. Just push in the direction
you want and Fiendish Fred won't bother you with his fan at all.
Use the overhead picture in the bottom left hand corner and just
keep the cross in the middle. Then you just do the same for all
four boards you jump from and Freddy won't make a bit of difference
to your score (if you want a good score, land in the water and keep
moving from left to right as fast as possible).
</P>

<H3>GENUINE JUGGLING GENIUS (JUGGLING)</H3>

<P>
If on the first level you don't drop anything then Fiendish Freddy
won't lob your death warrant to you in a shape of a bomb or a
nuclear missile. If you drop something and a bomb comes on just
push up and fire and Fiendish Freddy will be shaken. On the next
round a baby will join in the fun as it needs to be juggles
alongside the balls, all you need to do is get it in the pram. Drop
five items and you will have a very sore neck.
</P>

<H3>BREATHTAKING BRAVADO FROM HAZARDOUS HEIGHTS (TRAPEZE)</H3>

<P>
Looks easy but it can be very hard if you make a bodge of it early
on in the swing. If you want to keep going swing left to right all
the time. Be quick otherwise Fiendish will snip you to your doom.
</P>

<P>
Leave the swing an extra turn if you're not sure but don't chicken
out too many times as time is against you. Leave the swing for
about four seconds before you let go at the beginning. Hoops are no
problem: just wait until you see the rope on the other side and
then just pretend they weren't there. Make sure you are swinging
upwards when you press fire to let go otherwise you die.
</P>

<H3>TENSE TRAVEL TECHNIQUES ON TIGHTROPE (TIGHTROPE WALKING)</H3>

<P>
Make sure you're moving fast otherwise a cannon will make mincemeat
out of you. On the second level start moving out as soon as the
screen appears. If you don't, Freddy will punch you out of the
tent, he's that quick! You need to press fire once in the second
level to block the razor blade he throws at you. In the last level
you must need to move across as normal and press fire when Fiendish
Freddy uses the razor blades again. Timing is all important on the
third level. Look at the top left-hand corner and use that view to
guide you.
</P>

<H3>DEADLY AND DANGEROUS DAGGERS OF DEATH (KNIFE THROWING)</H3>

<P>
Picture the circle as a clock with an hour hand only, as soon as you
see the screen, just move to the outside of the circle and press
fire when the balloons reach the nine til half past nine position.
The knife should hit the balloon at the six o'clock position. The
rest is easy, just do that and you will complete the level easily.
</P>

<H3>COMBUSTIBLE CANNONS OF COLOSSAL COURAGE (HUMAN CANNON BALL)</H3>

<P>
For the Human Cannon Ball event all you have to do is count how many
handfuls your curvy assistant puts into the cannon, look it up on
the diagram and move the platform (the crash mat) along to the
relevant position and press fire.
</P>

<P>
Then all you have to do is leave the number of moves the diagram
tells you to (how many positions the cannon has to fall through) and
then press fire to send your Human Cannon Ball on his way.
