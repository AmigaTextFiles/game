<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Fly the F/A-18 Interceptor into combat to defend Air Force One.
Includes six combat missions, free flight, and a training mission.
In free flight mode you can try to fly under the Golden Gate Bridge
or over Alcatraz. Land on the U. S. S. Enterprise on a training
run. Variety of weapons, 3-D graphics, real-time digital map, first
person perspective, zoom function, ejection seat, and sound effects.
</P>

<H2>FUN</H2>

<P>
Taxi down U.S. 101, turn right at highway 92, pull up to the EA
headquarters and blow it away!
</P>

<P>
Select option 2 {FREE FLIGHT, NO ENEMY CONFRONTATION} from the main
menu. Then select zero instead of 1 to 4. The screen will go into
a spiral and scroll way south to 34 by 117 degrees, placing your
plane somewhere without a runway. This happens to be in the middle
of edwards air force base, where the F/A-18 was flight tested.
To take off you have to use the afterburners. 117 degrees is the
furthest south you'll be able to fly, but you can go in other
directions. Is there more to this back door?
</P>

<P>
In mission 6, once you've fired all your missiles, you can land on
the shadow sub (if it's still afloat) and it will refuel and rearm
you.
