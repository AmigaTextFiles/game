<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Identify the enemy and rock his world.  Fly the forward swept-wing
F-29, whose advanced avionics are revolutionizing aviation history,
or the explosively lethal F-22 Advanced Tactical Fighter. Just log
in and the ferious action begins. Choose a fighter, arm your
aircraft, and lead your squadron into the sky. There are four
intense battle scenarios and 100 different missions to fly. Dogfight
aerial opponents, make surgical strikes against land-based targets,
and attack the enemy on sea and land. F-29 features the latest in
aerodynamic technology, introducing ECOP controls, backwinder AAMS,
supercruise, stealth, and more!

<P>
Enter your name as "THE DIDY MEN" (with spaces, no 'RETURN') on the
enrollment screen. Click on the Colonel icon and press 'RETURN'.
Select the battle area as normal and select mission control. Accept
a mission (without selecting one) then go back and select a mission.
Now start the game and play as normal. When it comes time to land
simply press 'ENTER' on the numeric keypad and the plane will land
automatically.
</P>

<P>
To fly any mission with infinite weapons simply enter your name as
"CIARAN" on the enrolment screen and press 'RETURN' then load up
your pilot's log. The name should now read "OCEAN OK". Proceed as
normal from thereon.
</P>

<P>
Set up your mission as normal but do not enter the weapons selection
screen. Now when you start your mission you will have unlimited
Thunderbolt missiles. Fire away!
</P>

<P>
When you get killed on a mission, instead of restarting the game,
wait until the 'Service Terminated' screen appears and reset your
computer. Reload the game and your pilot should be intact.
