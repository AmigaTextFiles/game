<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
Don't rush through the levels; there's no time limit.
</P>

<P>
If you miss a baddie, go back and kill him.
</P>

<P>
It's much easier to kill baddies with a chest or boulder as only one
hit is required. This is much safer against those who carry
ingredients or health.
</P>

<P>
After completing a level you can return later. This is very handy
for stocking up on lives and health before you tackle the guardians.
</P>

<P>
On the first level there are three lives up for grabs.
</P>

<OL>
<LI>Instead of bouncing on the springy leaf, walk through the tree
and jump onto the platform. Jump quickly off before it falls away
and a chest will appear bearing what you seek.
<LI>After the springy leaf, on the second part of the level, walk on
until you see a chest appear on a high platform. Collect it by
jumping on an enemy's head and up onto the platform.
<LI>When you get to the stalk, jump up the first two leaves then
jump to the left. Another leaf will magically appear. Jump left
again to grab that third life.
</OL>

<P>
Always attempt to knock the helicopter pilots off the little
creatures and grab the machines before they fly off. They often
allow you to reach otherwise unobtainable lives and health.
