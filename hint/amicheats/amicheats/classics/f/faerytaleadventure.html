<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Guide 3 brothers on a quest to save the land of Holm from the forces
of night. Traverse caverns, mazes, forests, mountains, deserts,
islands, castles, and more. Over 19,000 playable screens, 3-D
overhead perspective lets you watch as goblins, skeletons, and ogres
pursue the brothers. Music changes to foreshadow action, just like
in the movies. Adjustable music and sound.
</P>

<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
The witch's castle is accessable through the maze of Grimwood
forest. You must enter the maze from the west and make your way
north-east. A cave must also be found. This should take you to the
Sunstone. The Sunstone should be used to kill the witch but this
might not work. You should be able to kill the witch with any
missile weapon as long as you avoid the witch's gaze. After you
kill her, you must get the golden lasso in order to ride the Golden
Swan. In the City of Azal, you will need the five golden statues.
These statues are located in: The Crystal Palace on the Isle of
Sorcery, The Battlefield in Grimwood Forest, The Castle south-east
of Marheim, The Watch Tower, and Hemsath's Tomb.
</P>

<P>
The best weapon in the game is the sword.

<H2>CHEATS</H2>

<P>
Save your position in the dungeons or caves. Then go through it and
open doors until you run out of keys. Now restore your position,
and you will have all your keys, but all the doors will still be
open. Repeat as often as you need.
</P>

<P>
Go to the dark evil castle. Stand right up against the force
field. Let yourself starve so that you faint. When you wake up,
you'll be on the other side of the forcefield.
</P>

<P>
Sometimes you can accumulate all the treasure you want by going near
the item, press 'SPACE', and then continue hitting "T". You'll
receive an infinite supply of that treasure.
</P>

<P>
Find the green turtle, jump on his back and start attacking.
Nothing will happen except your bravery points will keep piling up.
</P>

<P>
On the island with the Crystal Castle press 'RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON'
while speaking with the sorceress and luck increases to 65. Ask
the sorceress several times.
</P> 

<P>
A secret entrance to the fort exists. On the left side, near even
with the door.
</P>

<P>
If running low on Green keys, use a secret entrance for the fort.
It's on the left side, almost even with the door.
</P>

<P>
Beating the Turtle is not beating, it is pushing, so push the
turtle across the land, to use it in special places: The turtle was
programmed in asbestos, and can swim in Lava. It can be used to
enter the black citadel at the south. Also, while it is present,
you are not attacked, but by the time one has the turtle, one is
already invincible.
</P>

<P>
Save a game to a back up file and patch byte 18 to a non-zero value
and you know have these cheats at your disposal:
</P>

<P>
ARROW KEYS - Move very fast over any terrain<BR>
'B' ----------------------- Summon gold swan<BR>
'R' ------------------------ Rescue princess<BR>
'=' -------------------- Display coordinates<BR>
'F9' ------------- Increase time by one hour<BR>
'F10' -------------- Location in coordinates
