<P>
Kill four baddies on the bottom of the first level, then die, and on
the high score table type "BOB". This should give you infinite
lives.
</P>

<P>
On a really hard level, wait for ages until your time runs out.
A swarm of bees will now fly at you. Shoot as many of them as you
can. It does not matter whether you die. After losing a life, the
bees disappear, as have the baddies. You are then free to complete
the level with no foes.
