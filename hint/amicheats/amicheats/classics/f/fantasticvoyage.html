<P>
Based on the 20th Century fox film. Fantastic Voyage challenges
players to make their way through the human bloodstream in order to
destroy a bloodclot in the brain, fighting antagonistic white blood
cells, antibodies and other hazards along the way. The game features
unique organic graphics and sound effects.

On the title screen, press fire to start the game. When you are
asked to enter disk two, enter the second disk. After you insert
the 2nd disk the drive light should go on for a second and then
off. Now quickly press and hold the LEFT and RIGHT MOUSE BUTTONS,
the FIRE BUTTON, and the 'SPACE BAR'. Hold them until the drive
light goes out again. You should now be at the control room
screen. Press fire to start and you will now start with 99 lives.
