<H2>SOLVE</H2>

<H3>PART 1</H3>

<P>
Tell Rod to make the coffee and then get the tapes from the bin, the
tape bin can be found in the cupboard in the secondary control room.
Set the amplifier fader in the control room to a suitable level and
clean the tape heads with the cleaner. Play the tapes in the player
and the producer will storm in and sing the combination to the
cabinet in his office. Get what you find inside it and you've
solved the first part of Fish.
</P>

<H3>PART 2 - THE ABBEY</H3>

<P>
Get dressed and pick up the torch from the rubbish in the cab. Head
east until you get to the Abbey and find your way to the catacombs.
</P>

<P>
Open the sarcophagus lid and find the ceremonial cord. Go back up
to the ruined transepts and turn off your torch . Drag the pew past
the hippier until it`s beneath the arch; you can climb this by
standing on the pew. Tie the cord and collect the gargoyle. Put it
in its rightful place. Get the grommet from the chalice to complete
part 2. You may have to do this several times thanks to hippier
interference.
</P>

<H3>PART 3 - EXPLODING PARROTS</H3>

<P>
Timing is critical in this part so don`t waste any time. Go south
east to the smithy and free the budgie. Return to Mickie (mind the
bird) and get the disc from the stump when he leaves. Return to the
smithy and get the tools, gloves and mould. Wear the gloves and
place the disc in the crucible. Hold it in the fire with tongs and
pour it in the mould when it melts. Take this to the cool glade
avoiding Mickey and anywhere wet. Let it cool for a few turns.
When this is done smash the mould with a hammer and lo and behold
HYDROPOLIS!
