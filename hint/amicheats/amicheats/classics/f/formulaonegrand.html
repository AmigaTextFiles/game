<P>
Six International Circuits. Five different cars. Six-speed
gearboxes, lap records, and more. Up to three cars on the track at
the same time.
</P>

<H2>CHEATS</H2>

<P>
Go to the pits, escape from the game and go to accelerate time.
This should now finish the grand prix in pole position. It might
be that you have to do this on the last lap.
</P>

<P>
Slip into the pits after your first lap and then simultaneously
hold down the keys that make up the word "PALIR" and press the fire
button. Not only will you be unable to crash but the game will not
react as though you have pressed 'F4'.
</P>

<P>
Race a non-championship race and keep driving untill the last lap.
Then enter the pits and drive to your pit-crew. Wait for the
message "Race over". This way you will always win the race.
</P>

<P>
On the last lap go into the pits, apply your brakes and press <ESC>
to quit the race. Accelerate the time, and you should if you were
close enough to the leading pack, win the race.

</P>

<P>
A circuit that demands a great deal from the transmission with
numerous gear changes. The long left hander can also make it very
exausting for the drivers who have to fight the strain on their
kneck muscles.
</P>

<P>
It's important to be quick on the two long 200mph straights, cars
can be set up with very little downforce. However, this makes th
inner sections of the track more difficult to drive with the wheels
loosing some grip and the cars feeling jumpy and twitchy.
</P>

<P>
From the pits straight, flat out in 6th at 200mph, you sweep left
and thenright for Curva1 and Curva De Sol then wind up for the long
curva 2 lefthander and accelerate past reta oposta in 6th gear at
190mph. To slight left handers after curva 3 and storm through the
forth gear feradura. From here you need to get into a good rhythm
to take you through a series of slow winding bend: Laranji (2nd
gear, 55mph) then Prinhearinho, Bico Do Pato (2nd gear 55mph) and
finally, Merghulho. Curva 4 taken in 2nd or 3rd gear is next, a
bumpy slow left hander.
</P>

<P>
This corner is important in that taken properly it can put you in a
good position to approach the long left hander that leaves to the
pit straight Arquibancadas. Winding up through Subida its quite
possible to line yourself up to "get a tow", slipstream a car in
front of you and overtake.

</P>

<P>
A bumpy, brusing anti-clockwise circuit where the cars run little
wing and are often struggling for grip or clipping the kerb.
</P>

<P>
From the grid, you roar towards Tamburello, a long, fast 6th geat
left hander that pushes you into speeds in excess of 170mph.
</P>

<P>
Accelerating into Rettifiolo, the cars can reach 200mph before they
brake for Tosa, an off-camber tight left hander thats taken at 2nd
in 60mph. Here you have a good chance of getting on the brakes late
and overtaking but its not easy. Double back up the hill to a fast
left at Piratella, flat out in 4th, then change into 5th just as you
leave the bend.
</P>

<P>
Next, down the hill into the long left hander towards the Acque
Minerale chicane. The appoach is off-chamber and blind; you have no
view of the "S" until you are in it an 2nd at 50mph. Here, there is
a tendancy to bounce from one side of the track to the other and
many drivers spin off this corner.
</P>

<P>
Then flat-out through the small chicane at Variante Alfa and down
towards two bumpy left handers, Rivazza, that shake the car so much
you can hardly see where you are going.
</P>

<P>
Back in 5th, you approach Bassa, a right hand chicane that leaves
you a bit blind with no idea where the apex is, then weave through
Traguardo and back into the finishing straight.

Lap Record (Qualifying) - 1M 20.344 Seconds<BR>

</P>

<P>
The Qualifying laps for this circuit are very important because it
is practically impossible to pass anybody here unless they make a
driving error or crash.
</P>

<P>
The cars are set up for maximum downforce and suspension is a little
softer to deal with the many bumps on the course.
</P>

<P>
After the mayhem of the first bend at Sainte Devote, when the field
tries to squeeze through, you pass Roses Bar flat out in 6th at
170mph, great uphill straight but full of dips, bumps, and manhole
covers that make the car judder and thump.
</P>

<P>
Then to Casino, hard through the left-hander and quickly right
downhill, off camber, almost brushing the barrier as the road gets
narrower, slipery and very bumpy.
</P>

<P>
Mirabeau next; a tight simple, second gear bend. Accelerate sharply
then brake practically to a standstill for Loews. This is a first
gear, 40mph, hairpin that needs maximum lock (many drivers increase
the lock of the car for this Race). Often, there is a procession of
cars here and if your not in the first 6 then you have to wait your
turn.
</P>

<P>
Accelerate gently through Portier then flat out into the Tunnel,
3rd, 4th and 5th. The improved lighting in the tunnel means that
its not so much of a shock coming out of the daylight but you have
to be careful; the dirt, grease and oil does not get washed away by
the rain and this is not the place to skid. Roar out in 6th at
about 175mph, stay well out to the right and line up for the
Nouvelle Chicane. Take this fast in 4th, left- right zigzag but
this narrow section needs to be driven with utmost precision. One
touch of the kerb and your out of the Race.
</P>

<P>
Out of the chicane, flat out in 5th, the road widens and you head
for Tarbac and the Swimming Pool complex. in 3rd, 2 esses,
acceleerate briefly, brake hard and almost touch the barriers with
the right hand side of the car. La Rescasse next, than in 2nd for
Antony Noghes, accelerate out of this bend, roar through the gears
and then in 6th heading for the finishing straight.

</P>

<P>
A fast circuit comprising of a succession of hard braking and
accelerating. Drivers take off downforce which make the slower
sections much more difficult and emphasis the uneven surface.
</P>

<P>
From the start, the cars proceed into the slow left/right 1st gear
Island Hairpin, taken at 45mph. The drivers get a lot of wheelspin
as they leave this corner and build up to the long extended "s" bend
which they can approach in 5th at 160mph. Then its flat out in 6th,
180mph to 185mph along the back straight before slamming on the
brakes for the 1st gear, 40mph Pits Hairpin. Its very important to
get a good, fast exit out of this bend, then right, left, through
what is thought to be the most dangerous part of the circuit with
high concrete walls on either side of the track. Past Old Pits and
into 6th gear, than accelerate through the straight at
175-185-195mph. This is the fastest section of the track and leads
to one of the least favorite corners mong many drivers, down to 5th,
160mph, a quick right-left. Its very easy clip the kerb and spin
off here either on entry or on the apex, but if you come out of it
well, it sets you up for a charge down the finishing straight.

</P>

<P>
A hard, bumpy circuit, which needs lots of gear changes but
generally very fast. The cars require little downforce and becoaus
of the high altitude almost 20% of power is lost but this
compensated by a reduction in drag. Concentration is vital on this
course. Drift off-line and you find dusty parts of the track with
little grip. Mexico can also have vicious bumps that can cause a
lot of damage to the car and knock the breath from your body.
</P>

<P>
After a long straight, the fastest on the course in 6th at 190mph,
and one of the best places to overtake, you brake hard onto the 1st
corner, down to 55mph in 2nd or 3rd. Right, left, right into the
shorter straight flat out towards a long series of bends, the Esses.
Its easier if you can get into a rhythm because they are very
similar. When you hit the back streight in 6th and head for
Peralta, a notorious corner taken in 5th at 160mph and a challenge
to any driver, exit on a kerb than accelerate to 170mph past the
grandstand.

This new course in the World championships. Smooth and challenging,
doubling back on itself, with fast fourth-fifth gear corners and
first gear hairpins as well a long top-speed straight, Magny-Cours
has been built to appel to the Formula One spectators and TV crews
alike.
</P>

<P>
The circuit has several constant radius corners but the cars are set
up to carry less downforce. The 5 fast straights mean that
acceleration and top speed are more important than the fraction of a
second to be gained at corners when carrying more downforce.
</P>

<P>
After the pits straight, you roar into a fast left hander which
changes into a slow left hander at Big Bend. Taken in 4th or 5th,
this propels you into a slow left hander it Big bend then turns into
a long sweeping right hander: Estoril Bend. Taken in 4th of 5th,
this propels you into the long back straight, past the Golf Course
Bend, in top at 190mph.
</P>

<P>
After the fastest point, brake hard for the 1st gear hairpin at
Adelaide Bend and turn into the infield part of th course. Swing
into the 2nd or 3rd gear Esse then a short straight before
Nurburring, a slight right, then a sweeping right, then a sweeping
left which turns into a double- apex 180 degree bend that throws you
into another short straight almost parallel with the previous one.
</P>

<P>
Next, a 5th gear left handler, Imola, which leads into the fast 4th
gear bend at Chateau d'Eau then another short straight, under the
bridge and into the chicane before you take a good line sharp right
into the Lycee Bend, then flat out across the finishing line.

<P>
The circuit has been altered for the 1991 Championship because it
was considered far too dangerous. A bend such as Club corner taken
in 6th at 185mph with no run off track particually hazardous.
</P>

<P>
Copse is a forth gear corner that pushes you into a fast straight
leading to Maggots, where you swing into the "S" shaped Beckets in
2nd or 3rd. This slows the cars down and provides a better
specticle for the cars down and provides a better spectacle for the
crowd. Then the cars roar away from Chapel along the Hangar
Straight, under the bridge, towards the double apex right-hander
Stowe; taken in 3rd of 4th at 100mph.
</P>

<P>
After the Vale complex you have to take Club, a 3rd gearleft-hander
that throws you into the Abbey straight, a favorite overtaking
stretch. In 6th, at 185mph sweep into the Farm Straight and a fast
right under bridge towards Priory and Brooklands.
</P>

<P>
Two second or third gear left-handers followed by two right-handers
ending at Luffield, then its flat out along the fast Woodcote and
through the finishing straight.

</P>

<P>
There are 3 chicanes on the circuit, one fast and two that have to
be taken slowly. the rest of the course is a series of streights.
</P>

<P>
This means that to have good top speed almost all downforce is taken
off, and the cars are a horror to drive with no grip and twitchy on
any bend. From the start you take a 4th gear right hander at
140mph, then put your foot down till you hit 6th at 200mph for the
fastest part of the course. Brake hard for Chicane 1 which hooks
sharp right and can be taken in 2nd at 50mph but if you drive a bad
line you may be forced to drop to bottom gear. Up through the gears
again, flat out, 200mph for the sweeping right-hander then brake
again for another chicane which you take in 2nd at 50mph, come out
of that and roarinto Ostkurve, one of the fastest bends of any
championship course, take it in 6th, 200mph. Slow down for Chicane
2, drop to 4th or 3rd, then flat out for the rest of the straight
until Agipkurve. thisis the most difficult part of the circuit and
tends to wear out tyres prematurely. Drivers have not built up any
rhythm for the bends and all concentration is loston the long
straights.
</P>

<P>
Approaching Sachskurve, slip to 4th, line the car into the
right-hander, foot down, sweep round, then second gear to take the
hairpin, speed up, line up the car for the tight right-hander, brake
lightly and roar out of Opelkurve in 3rd towards the finishing
straight.
</P>

<P>
Hockenheimring is a good overtaking circuit but the slow chicanes
require brutal braking and brakes tend to cool off on the long
straights making them less efficient. Most drivers find it
difficult to establish a satisfactory rhythm on this course.

</P>

<P>
A tough but reletivly slow circuit with a large number of corners
and a few straights. Its difficult to overtake on this course and
you have to be quite patient, waiting for the right moment. Cars
are usually set upfor more downforce to gain the advantage of good
grip on the numerous bends.
</P>

<P>
Roaring away from the start, downhill, flat out in 6th at 185mph,
the pit straight is the main overtaking point on the course. Then
through the first of several constant radius corners at 130mph in
4th, a short back straight, then a double-apex left-hander leading
to a long sweeping right. Accelerate to 165mph in 5ht, sweep left
then go into another double apex bend. Slow down for a second gear
chicane, then drive hard into a whole series of fast corners before
the constant radius Pit Lane bend throws you into the long finishing
straight.
</P>

<P>
The twisting up and down nature of the track means that the average
speeds are quite low, about 105-110mph and tyres wear out quickly as
the drivers lose patience and try to exit corners faster than the
tyres will allow. Most teams find that drivers come in for a tyre
change much earlier than planned, if only to get away from the
queues that develop on this circuit.

Fast, challenging and exilerating, Spa is a favourite among Grand
Prix drivers. It successfully combines fast 6th and 5th gear
corners with good 1st gear hairpins and 2nd gear chicanes.
Generally cars are set up with little downforce.
</P>

<P>
From the start line, there is a short space of time before the cars
reach the 1st gear, 45rpm La Source hairpin, the scene of many
opening-lap shunts, as 26 cars brake from 160mph to 45mph while
trying desperatly to overtake each other. Then, its a Race up
through the gears, downhill in 6th at 180mph, you drop into the Eau
Rouge dip, a slight left, then sweep right uphill past Reidillon.
This is one driving line you cannot afford to get wrong, one error
and your off the circuit!
</P>

<P>
Speed up through Kemmel and into a long straight, flat out at
195mph, weave through Les Combes and then take Melmedy in 2nd.
</P>

<P>
This is a tricky 180 degree corner, downhill and off-chamber.
Pouhon is next; an extremely difficult left-hander that starts off
in 6th, then drops to 5th at 150mph. Through Les Fagnes and
Stavelot then brake hard for the Bus Stop Chicane. Bus Stop is the
drivers least favourite corner, to be quick you have to run over the
shallow kerbs, which is always a risk.
</P>

<P>
The weather is always a big factor at Spa-Francorchamps and it is
invariably wet which results in small, hazardous steams crossing the
circuit, making driversadjust their driving line.

Monza is always full of screaming, hysterical crowds being
marshmellowed by even more hysterical officials. The drivers absorb
the atmosphere and are spurred on to perform to their utmost,
especially if they are driving an italian car.
</P>

<P>
The cars run little wing to take advantage of the very fast
start/finish straight, Rettifilo, which is crossed at speeds
inexcess of 200mph. The track has been modified to make it safer
including the introduction of the 2nd gearVariante Goodyear, a
chicane that leads into the famous 5th gear Curva Grande.
</P>

<P>
Flat out towards Lesmos in 5th there is another 2nd gear chicane:
Curva della Roggia before the double right-hander Curva do Lesmos
corner. You take the first part in 4th gear then power up to take
the 2nd part flat out. These corners have to be taken just right
for any slight error will slow you down considerably and puy you in
a bad position for the 180 mph back straight, Curva del Serragilo.
</P>

<P>
Then its a tricky 3rd gear chicane Variante Ascari, come out of this
in 5th and change down Rettifilo Centro at 190mph in top and brake
hard for the famous Curva Parabolica, a fast, 180 degree
right-hander thats taken in 4th at 140mph. Accelerate to 160mph out
of the bend, then storm through the finishing line with your foot
down ni 6th.

<H3>ESTORIL: PORTUGAL</H3>

</P>

<P>
Estoril is a tough, tiring circuit with several long, constant
radius and some very bumpy straights. If the car is starting from
near the front of the grid then its wise to run a lot of downforce
to cope with the long bends, but it you are starting lowdown in the
order then you must use less downforce, otherwise you'll find it
very difficult to overtake.
</P>

<P>
The start/finish line is in the middle of the circuits longest
straight. cars accelerate to 190mph in 6th before Turn 1, trying to
overtake each other, before braking into 4th gear corner. Turn 2 is
another sweeping right-hander, then its up to 5th for the short
straight, brake hard for turn 3, the Martini Bridge Bend, a tight
double-apex right-hander. Its important to drive a good line
through the infield at estoril, avoiding the kerbs and the sandy,
greasy edges.
</P>

<P>
Turn 4 is almost a mirror image of the previous corner. Take the
left- hander in 2nd at 45mph, then Racew up through the gears, swing
through the slight right-hander, Turn 5, then flat out in 6ht at
180mph. This is probably the best place to overtake on the whole
circuit. Through Turn 6, a corner that begins tight then opens out,
foot down for a short straight and into the long series of fast
bends, Turns 7-8-9-10. Its important to maintain a good rhythm
through these bends, keep concentration, change up, change down,
brake hard.
</P>

<P>
The final corner before the pit straight, Turn 11, is a real
challenge for any Formula One driver. its a long, constant redius
sweeping bend that you enter in 4th and leave in 5th, accelerating
all the way, ready to get in position ot overtake.
</P>

<P>
Estoril is a circuit thats not only hard on gears and tyres but also
tough on tyres; the long sweeping bends often mean that many drivers
return to the pits earlier than planned as the heat and rough
surface take their toll.

</P>

<P>
A new circuit that has a wide range of corners from slow, 2nd gear
to fast 4th/5th gear and includes a very long 200mph overtaking
straight. In shape it is very similar to Estroril but the surface
is much smoother.
</P>

<P>
Drivers will have to compromise between downforce needed for the
many bends and the speed required for the pit straight. Most will
opt for little downforce and try to nurse their cars through the
infield section.
</P>

<P>
From the start, accelerate through the gears, flat out in 6ht
heading for Elf, a slow left hander. if you are not in lead, this
gives you a good opportunity to overtake under braking. then, its a
slight left before a long sweeping 4th gear right-hander that you
leave in 5th and speed up for the short straight to Repsol; a corner
which turns back on itself but whose angle progressively widens.
Next, a short burst of speed into seat, brake, drop to 2nd at 45rpm,
accelerate, then slight left, slight right before taking Wurth in
4th and roaring off to Campsa, a fast, 3rd/4th gear right-hander.
</P>

<P>
After that its right and left through Nissan and flat out, up to la
Caxia. This is another corner that starts tight and opens out.
Steer in, get on line early and as the corner widens, move to the
outside of the track. There is no time to put your foot down before
you reach the Banc Sabadell, along constant radius bend.
</P>

<P>
Next comes the approach to the straight. Sweepright, foot down ,
then right again take Renault in 3rd, change to 4th and charge out
in 5th before hitting 6th, flat out, past the finishing line.

<P>
An interesting, undulating course and the only figure of eight in
the Grand Prix. Tiough, 6th gear corners combine with 1st gear
hairpins to make tyre stops essential. Little downforce is set
because of the 3 long straights and the cars generally feel sluggish
in the corners.
</P>

<P>
The pits straight is a 6ht gear, 190mph charge where it is perfectly
possible to overtake, then its down to 5th for the First curve. You
drift the car to the left side of the track, down to 4th and Race
out of the corner.
</P>

<P>
Next you came to a series of 4th gear bends (The S curve). Driving
as tight a line as possible through these, you leave Dunlop Curve
with your foot down in 5th, going uphill and blind for the oncoming
left- hander. The car feels light as you roar over the bumpy crest
and come down hard for the 2 right handers Degner Curve and
Crossover.
</P>

<P>
You now pass under the circuit and approach at a slow 40mph for the
1st gear Hairpin Curve. This corner can play havoc with your rear
tyres if you try to exit too quickly and overspin the back wheels.
Now line up the car for the long double apex left hander. Enter in
4th but slow down for the 2nd part of Spoon Curve for its quite easy
to spin off here.
</P>

<P>
Next you get one of the fastest straights, 6th gear, 180mph,
sweeping left with both hands on the wheel, ease your car carefully
through the slow Casio Chicane then storm through flat out past the
finishing straight.

A hard, unforgetting street circuit that requires numerous gear
changes and is very tough on brakes and tyres. The last Grand Prix
venue of the champoinship season and always very exciting as teams
try to finish the year off with a win. Adelaide has been
responsible for deciding the outcome of several championship, the
most famous being Nigel Mansells blow out in 1986. Again, there is
a need to compromise; youll need a lot of 90 degree bends but you
will also need speed of the Jones and Brabhim straights.
</P>

<P>
After the start, you come to a fast 4th gear chicane at Wakefield
Road, take this at about 140mph then flat out towards the Finders
Street complex. The road is very bumpy here and the occasional
manhole cover will knock the breath out of you. Brake hard for a
difficult 2nd gear 90 degree right hander then left 90 degrees and
right 90 degrees. Through East TerRace and a fast off-camber
left-hander, drop down to 2nd gear and steer a good line to hit
Jones's straight in 5th. Foot down, then a slight right and into
Brabham straight, under the 2 bridges flat out, 200mph in 6th.
</P>

<P>
Next you step on the brakes to take the tricky 1st gear 40mph
hairpin and speed up into 3rd for a deceptive tightening corner stay
wide as long as possible hit the apex late, brake, change down, take
a line on the outside and follow the curve of the bend to give you
the smoothest possible exit angle. Past Pits and right through
Racecourse, brake hard, change down into 2nd for a good fast exit
into the finishing straight.
