<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
The climatic disaster that precipitated a new Ice Age has finally
diminished. As the ice and snow begin to melt, the people search for
a home safe from the rising seas. But there is no paradise to be
found, only the Saharan Empire - a brutal, totalitarian regime
determined to control and manipulate everything in its path; an
empire so powerful it can only be defeated from within. Your
mission: promote discontent and revolution among the empire's
populace through high-risk undercover operatians.
</P>

<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
To gain control of all the 41 islands, it's only necessary to
capture the following: Lobos, Ndola, Camargo, Makat, Dhafia, Ghazal,
Djoum, and Satara.
