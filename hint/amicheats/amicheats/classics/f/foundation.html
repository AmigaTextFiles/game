<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
Foundation is a strategy game based in a fantasy world full of magic
and war. You control a race of people brought together from
different times in history. The aim is to be victorious over your
enemies by taking over the land.
</P>

<H3>GENERAL</H3>

<P>
REPRODUCTION: Reproduction occurs in any building that contains
"Maidens" and "Male Units". The ratio of female births against male
births depends on the number of females (Maidens) in storage.
</P>

<P>
For example:<BR>
1 females left: 1:0 female/male ratio<BR>
2 females left: 1:1 female/male ratio<BR>
3 females left: 1:2 female/male ratio<BR>
...<BR>
20 females left: 1:19 female/male ratio
</P>

<P>
The birthrate is twice as high in the peasant huts compared to the
HQ. The birthrate is higher if there are more males in a building
(up to about 10). Maidens can give birth at any age.
</P>

<P>
Maidens will only give birth if both their morale and energy is
above 40%. After a birth, the father and mother of the child will
loose 10% energy and gain 10% morale and the new born will take the
fathers surname. The new born will have the same energy/morale
levels as the mother at the time of birth.
</P>

<P>
The fact that both mother and father loose 10% energy for each new
born means approx 1 unit of food is needed to recover that energy
loss. This means a population growth of 50 will require 50 items of
food to keep ballance and general food usage will rise by approx 15
items of food per year.
</P>

<P>
LIFE SPAN: If kept healthy, people live to around 60-75 years. If
they are unhealthy, they will probably not live to 60 years. And if
morale is low, it is likely that they will start committing suicide.
Health problems are more serious above the age of 50.
</P>

<P>
FOOD: Food increases the amount of energy a person has. Each
person eats the same amount of food, and looses about 5% energy each
year. Once the energy level of a person drops below 80%, they will
look for food to eat. The choice of food is random, and is made
from the menu of a particular building. If the chosen food is not
there, the person will go without food for another year and morale
will suffer. This means that a building with only half the food
items available will force the occupeants to go without food quite
often. So it is best to try and keep all food items in stock in a
building, although it is not neccesary to provide all food items all
of the time.
</P>

<P>
THE POWER OF FOOD: Most types of food will give a person 20% of a
extra energy. Eating food will also raise morale by 5%. In some
buildings the power of food is different:
</P>

<P>
Hospital - 40% energy, 10% morale<BR>
Tavern --- 15% energy, 25% morale<BR>
Church --- 20% energy, 20% morale
</P>

<P>
If a person drinks Wine you can add an extra 10% to the morale
figures above and subtract 10% from the energy figures above. So
for example drinking Wine in the Church will give a person 10%
energy and 30% morale. Drinking Wine in a regular building eg,
Headquarters will give a person 10% Health and 15% morale.
</P>

<P>
TRAVELLING SPEEDS:<BR>
Peasants/Maidens/Wizards generaly walk at speed 2<BR>
Guards and Knights walk at speed 3<BR>
Black Knights walk at speed 4
</P>

<P>
The percentage of energy and morale will affect these speeds but as
an example, the Black Knight will walk twice as fast as a Peasant.
</P>

<P>
RELATIVE STRENGTHS: All people in Foundation have 'Attack Powers'
and 'Shield Powers'. If you divide the Attack Power of the
'attacker' by the Shield Power of the 'victim' you can work out
approximate damage levels. Here is a chart showing the Attack and
Shield powers:
</P>

<P>
Unit ----- Attack - Shield
</P>

<P>
Maidens ------ ?? - 1<BR>
Scientist ---- ?? - 1<BR>
Peasant ------ 04 - 1<BR>
Wizard ------- ?? - 2<BR>
Guard -------- 10 - 2<BR>
Knight ------- 14 - 2.5<BR>
Black Knight - 18 - 3
</P>

<P>
(Extra attack points are added for extra experience levels of
soldiers but the values are lowered as energy and morale are
lowered.)
</P>

<P>
Now for a few examples of typical attacks:
</P>

<P>
Peasant attacks Guard -- 04 / 2 = 02 hit points<BR>
Guard attacks Peasant -- 10 / 1 = 10 hit points<BR>
Knight attacks Peasant - 14 / 1 = 14 hit points
</P>

<P>
The above figures would 'even out' a little when morale and energy
levels are brought into the calculation but generaly a Peasant has
about 30% of the attack power of a Guard and a Black Knight should
kill a Peasants in less than 5 hits.
</P>

<H3>GAMEPLAY</H3>

<P>
Try and keep your people INSIDE a building. If they are outside,
they will lose health because they have no food to eat.
</P>

<P>
Try to keep your population level UNDER CONTROL. A population of
around 200-250 will most likely be the most efficient level for most
circumstances. If you have too many peasants, you will need more
food, and more water, and more peasants to get the food and water.
So keep the population DOWN and you will find you can comfortable
supply everyone with what they need.
</P>

<P>
Do not overuse the speed-time functions. You can do productive
almost all of the time. Speeding up time while you are doing
'housework' enables the enemies to become stronger, faster. Be wary
of this feature.
</P>

<P>
If you are runing short of peasants, check your wood levels. If you
have enough wood to get by, reduce the number of WORKERS in the
forestors hut to one or two. This will reduce the number of
forestors required and you will end up with extra peasants to send
elsewhere
</P>

<P>
When you are getting ready to attack an enemy building, send 6 or 7
maidens in first to draw the guards away. Then when the guards come
out, send the maidens away from the building and the guards will
follow them. Your soldiers and peasents now have an easier time to
attack the building.
</P>

<P>
Maidens can produce offspring in ANY building as long as they have
food, water, and a mate. They do it faster in peasant huts, but by
keeping some in other buildings you assure that those buildings get
replacement workers even if there are no 'spares' in the castle and
also you increase the moral of the workers in that building so they
stay healthier and don't want to kill themselves. Happy workers are
good workers as long as they are also healthy and well fed. That's
all maidens do but these functions are totally critical to your
society. Keep maidens in every building if you can, but especially
in your most important buildings. Put maidens where the men are in
other words. Your men will thank you by living and working better
and your tribe will increase faster. Just make sure everybody has
food and water, and preferably all the foods they like.
</P>

<H3>MISSION TYPES</H3>

<P>
FAST/SMART STRATEGY: (0-2 years, Mostly rescue missions)<BR> On
rescue-missions, I think the first prisson can be done with this.
Find a safe path and guide your people that way, normaly it includes
finding no-man-land or walking along borders. (Usualy takes a
couple of attempts before it works.)
</P>

<P>
Fast Strike: (4->8 years, A few rescue, prisson-breaks,
'destroy-enemy-something', the later can/ must sometimes be played
'long')<BR>
Build 2 or 3 barracks, trade iron/wood/stone/ore/coal/oil for gold
and armour and make all your pessants into soldiers, then go for the
target. On later rescues you'll need to take a few strategic
buildings to get your people home. On later prison-breaks you MUST
make a secure path to the prison as you need almost all the men safe
home. (This type takes a first attempt where you only send your
knights out to locate the target(s), then restart and build the
army.)
</P>

<P>
LONG AND TOUGH: (+40 years, Destroy one/all enemy)<BR> Start by
building a farm, a pessant-hut and some water-supply. The next step
is to find what you can produce easy. If you are near water, you
can make some water-pumps and trade water for what you need, if
you're near mountains build mines.. Try and produce as many things
as possible yourselve, it's however often a waste to build 'masons'
and 'forresters',' as they 'run out', rather use your men and
resources on mines, water and food that last forever, then trade for
wood.
</P>

<P>
Always have spare men in your HQ to do transports, 2 or 3 is enough
at all times, be sure to construct pessant-huts as you go on, a base
ready for battle should have at least 5 pessant-huts with plenty
supplys.. Don't build warehouses unless you REALY need them, due to
bugs in the game they usualy gives more trouble than good.
</P>

<P>
If you have more than one mine, then have only ONE producing oil for
your labs, don't produce oil if you don't have any labs. Same for
farms, only produce grain if you have baker or brewery.
</P>

<P>
Build a lab early on and make sure it's filled with scientists,
you'll need the 'tourch' command to make a good battle.
</P>

<P>
Barracks can usualy wait until year 20, the soldiers you have from
the start is enough to guard until that time.
</P>

<P>
Don't put guards in houses build 'away' from the enemy, they'll
serve much better in the HQ if you get attacked.
</P>

<P>
If you choose to build an armoury early in the game, you should only
put 2 people at work there, more will use you your iron-supply.
When you build barracks you don't need to have 5 people in them from
the start, 2 is enough until you begin preparations for battle.
</P>

<P>
Don't start battle until you know how to tourch the enemy, then set
off with a good bunch of soldiers and 3-7 peasants, have the
soldiers distract the enemy and send in your pessants and burn
everything. It's importaint to burn down barracks, refinery,
armoury and farms (yes !!) belonging to the enemy, it might also be
good to burn the water-supply. When you tourch, then remember to
keep tourching a building until it's destroyed, simply done by:
Everytime a pessant has tourched a building and he leaves it,
quickly select him and ask him to do it again, now he will walk into
the building (the guards won't attack him) and wait until a wizard
appears and puts out the fire, then he'll tourch again, keep doing
it as long as the building stands (Don't worry, the pessant won't
die when the building drops.)
</P>

<P>
When the 'primary-supply' of the enemy is knocked down, go on and
burn the rest of his houses. When that's done (enjoy the
pessant-huts, sounds so funny) send the peasants and soldiers home
to relax a bit, wait 1 or 2 years and make the attack on the enemy
HQ. Repeat for all enemy if needed.
