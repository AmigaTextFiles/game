<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Players must master five basic mission to become a Squadron
Commander. Once all five missions are completed, players may
undertake Operation Conquest, the final scenario. By successfully
blowing away the enemy in Operation Conquest, players are promoted
to a more elite squadron. There are nine squadrons in all, and each
promotion becomes progressively more difficult to attain. The game
includes LANTRIN-guided Maverick missiles, Iron bombs and Durandals,
Advanced Tactical Air Reconnaissance System, and air-to-Air
missiles. More than 500 fixed and mobile targets are spread over
thousands of square miles on every mission.

<P>
If you`re fed up with landing try the following: Jetison all fuel
and weapons and climb to 65000ft. Stay there until the last of your
fuel runs out. Dive towards the ground and at 10 or 11 thousand
feet pull up hard. You will then be able to rise about 4000 ft and
then start falling towards the ground. Just as you hit the ground
the mission will end safely.
