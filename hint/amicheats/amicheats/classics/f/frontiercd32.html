<P>
For more cargo buy at least one ton of rubbish and go to a system
where you won`t be caught for dumping it. Then go to the cargo
screen and click a bit below the rubbish box. You should notice that
the remaining cargo has gone up but the ammount of rubbish has
stayed the same. Keep doing this and soon you`ll have enough cargo
space to get a large plasma accelator. If you do this in a small
ship, eventually you`ll be able to buy a class 7 hyperdrive and jump
a long way across the galaxy with somewhere around 50 tons of fuel.
