<H2>CHEATS</H2>

<P>
Start the game as normal with just one bazooka shell. Arm the 
weapon, press and hold the fire button. Now press 'ESC'. Go to
the armory and get rid of all your rockets. Now you can start the
mission with infinite supply of bazooka shells. The same applies
to all weapons as well.
</P>

<H2>TIPS</H2>

<H3>GENERAL</H3>

<P>
USING THE KNIFE: Your knife is a very powerful weapon when used
correctly and essential when on a stealth mission. As soon as you
see an enemy, hit the floor and wait for them to come to you. If
they dont, crawl (dont walk) towards them. When you in striking
distance, stand up and use your knife to stab them or, if you're a
professional, slit their throat.
</P>

<P>
USING FIREARMS: When using a gun, always lay down and fire as many
of the enemy guards are unable to hit you on the ground. Shoot them
as soon as you see them - if you know when they appear, its possible
to shoot them before they even come on screen. This is especially
important when killing the members of the elite enemy forces,
identifiable by their red berets. If you know that there is an enemy
soldier coming up that is not in you current firing range, prepare
your gun before you get to them so you are able to quickly shoot up
or down at them. This avoids having to aim while you are being shot
at from all angles.
</P>

<P>
USING GRENADES: These are essential when destroying land mines
placed by the enemy and can be directed to go in a specific
direction by moving the cross-hair around the character and
releasing fire to throw the grenade.
</P>

<H3>MISSION ONE</H3>

<P>
Equipment:
</P>

<P>
AKM Rifle<BR>
9 X AK47 Mags<BR>
5 X M26 Grenades<BR>
3 X Field Dressing Packs
</P>

<P>
Select the gun as soon as you start the mission. Drop onto the floor
under the truck and kill the enemy that aproaches as soon as he
comes onto the screen.
</P>

<P>
The leader of the enemy forces (the one with the beige beret) can be
found at one of the following locations: either down from Tango 8,
up from Tango 21, up frpm Tango 36 or up and left from Tango 37.
</P>

<P>
Once you have found him, kill him and the accompanying guard and
leave the building. When at Tango 28/29 you will need to use a M26
grenade to kill a soldier and destroy some land mines. Now advance
to your pick-up point at Tango 41.
</P>

<H3>MISSION TWO</H3>

<P>
Equipment:
</P>

<P>
AKM Rifle<BR>
4 X AKM47 Mags<BR>
2 X M26 Grenades<BR>
2 X Field Dressing Packs<BR>
5 X C4 Explosives
</P>

<P>
As soon as you land at the drop-off point, switch to the gun and
kill the enemy soldier with the red beret. Push on until you reach
the first hut at Bravo 7. Go inside to collect the first aid if you
need it, then leave and destroy the hut with C4. To destroy the next
hut at Bravo 10, you should first kill the two soldiers situated
around the hut, kill the enemy soldier at the top of the tower and
then finally destroy the hut. You will need to use a couple of M26
grenades after destroying the next hut at Bravo 14 and then progress
to Bravo 26 where you can blow up the hut for extra points. Now go
to the pickup point at Bravo 29 to complete the mission.
</P>

<H3>MISSION THREE</H3>

<P>
Equipment:
</P>

<P>
M177 CAR15 Rifle<BR>
5 X M177 Mags<BR>
5 X C4 Explosives<BR>
2 X M26 Grenades<BR>
2 X Field Dressing Packs
</P>

<P>
On this mission, you really need to search all the buildings, and
keep count of the number of SAM missiles you have destroyed - you
must blow up five to complete the mission. A good way to do this is
to lay the explosives but not detonate them as you can see how many
explosives you have laid by looking to see how many highlighted
detonators there are.
</P>

<P>
Advance to Alpha 7 and enter the building there. Kill the enemy
soldiers. Go upstairs, kill the other enemy soldier, place an
explosive by the SAM in this room if theres one here and then search
both soldiers to see if they have any ammunition. Exit and proceed
to Alpha 13. Go up the ladder and enter the door at the top. Follow
the stairs down and then down the stairs behind the crate in the
next room. You should now be in a room with four crates stacked in
the shape of an upside down T.
</P>

<P>
Behind these are more stairs. Go down these, which take you past the
wall and carry on until you find the exit out of the building,
placing another explosive next to any SAMs you see. Dont go out of
the exit, but instead go up the stairs where you may find another
SAM. Once this is destroyed, go back down the stairs and out the
exit, making sure to crouch down when you come out as two soldiers
are waiting here.
</P>

<P>
Kill them and progress to the next exit, then go upstairs and
destroy any SAMs you find. Find the exit from the building at Alpha
27 but do not leave the building. Instead go right and shoot as soon
as you enter the room. Go up the stairs, shoot the enemy and then go
right, where you may find a SAM to destroy. Go up, destroying any
more missiles you see and then down to the exit. Leave the building,
kill the enemy and go up the ladder at Alpha 28. Progress on to
Alpha 33 where you will be pick up.
</P>

<H3>MISSION FOUR</H3>

<P>
Equipment:
</P>

<P>
MP5 Sub-Machine Gun<BR>
2 X MP5 Cartridges<BR>
6 X C4 Explosives<BR>
4 X Field Dressing packs
</P>

<P>
You will be dropped at map reference point Omega 0. As this is a
stealth mission it is important that little noise is made, so use
your knife at all times. Wait until you see a log at Omega 1 and
then hit the floor and start to crawl. This will stop the enemy gun
from firing at you which is very important as this is, remember, a
stealth mission.
</P>

<P>
Crawl until you get past the gun bunker and kill the enemy inside.
Now move on to Omega 9 where you will find the first hut that
contains a hostage. Kill the enemy g uards outside the hut with your
knife and then go into the hut. Kill the guard inside and free the
hostage by cutting his bonds with your knife. Before you leave the
hut, drop a C4 plastic explosive pack in the hut so you can create a
diversion when all the hostages have been rescued. Repeat this
procedure for each of the hostages in the huts at Omega 12, 15, 18,
20, 23 and 24 and then progress to the pre-determined pickup point,
detonating the explosives to create that diversion along the way.
Mission accomplished!
</P>

<P>
HOSTAGE NOTE: After the successful hostage rescue operation, some of
the men on the front end mission roster that were previously listed
as 'Missing In Action' will now be active and available for duty.
