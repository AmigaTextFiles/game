Run the game from the CLI or Shell with the word "immortal" after
the program name followed by the level number you wish to play. For

<P>
Go under the arch and step twice on the pressure pad to close the
pit.
</P>

<P>
Walk right and take the transporter. Step on the pressure pad and
return. Now you can go down where the scroll is and take the
transporter that is located there. Move up to step on the pressure
pad beside the mirrors and return. You can now walk to the far left
of the arena. Step on the pressure pad and walk through the
automatic doors. Take the transporter at the top left of the arena
to collect the money. Go to the next arena by taking the exit at
the bottom.
</P>

<P>
Press the switch on the right to activate the maze transformation.
Now that the wall is gone, go around the bottom and up to the
transporter. Hide in the small alcove to avoid the rolling
booulder. Take the transporter. There are 9 transporters. Only
take the one on the top right. Walk up through the electric arcs
and collect the key. Return to the transporter. Take the
transporter at the bottom to return to where the boulder is. Use
the switch just near there. Returns as you did before. The guard
has now moved and you can open the door with the key. There is also
an underground bonus room to the right if you can find it. Take the

</P>

<P>
There are a number of hand prints on the wall. Press the second one

breather. Go back and take the exit at the top of the arena.
</P>

<P>
Walk right and collect the other bomb in the chest. Walk up to step
on the pressure pad. There is a different pressure pad near the
force field. Step on it to temporarily disengage the force field,
allowing you to walk through it. Go back and take the left path up
to the exit.
</P>

<P>
Walk to the bottom and destroy the homing domes and the orcs.
Remember to pick up money whenever you see some. Go through the
automatic doors. Slowly move down until you see a boulder come out
of the hole at the top. Quickly move back to where you were to
allow the boulder to roll past without hitting you. It will then
fall into the hole below and fill it up allowing you to walk over
it. Select the Nuke as your current weapon and place one just below
the cracked wall. The wall is now destroyed. Destroy the other
cracked wall and take the exit.
</P>

<P>

and 3 keys that are now there. Now open the 3 doors and collect the
Fireblade from the chest and get ready to use it. Make your way
through the maze destroying all the creatures and take the right

the Chain Gun and return. You will need to use this on Kilmando
wholooks like the other orcs, but is much stronger and smarter.
Destroy all the orcs. The exit will not open until Kilmando is
dead. Fight him among the stone columns and try and get some
distance between you beforeletting loose with the Chain Gun. Once
he has been killed, collect the gold at the top and take the right
exit.
</P>

<P>
There are a series of pressure pads here. Walk down over the 2 left
pressure pads. Once you're on top of the second pressure pad, walk
right and step on the pad there. Step on the pressure pad above
that and the one on the right. Walk down through the passage and
all the pits should now be closed. There is a hand print on the
wall, but it won't open until you've destroyed the 4 mirrors. Open
the door and destroy the homing domes. Talk to Karlos, then take
the right exit.
</P>

<P>
Kill all the monsters and talk to Gorland. Don't worry about the
combination switches yet. Take the left transporter and go through
the top exit. Use a bomb to destroy the wall on the left. Now that
there's a gap in the wall, you need to push a stone column through
there. The only column you can move is the one without a shadow.
Push the column 1 down, 4 right, 4 down and then left to the now
open wall. Push the column into the hole in the ground so you can
walk across and take the left exit.
</P>

<P>
There is a row of stone columns in this arena. You need to push one
onto the transporter to move it. To do this, push the 5th column 2
up, 3 left, 1 down, 3 right, then down to push it onto the
transporter. Go through the automatic doors and destroy the
crumbled wall. Walk carefully past the arrows and take the
transporter. Push the stone column that should now be there up to
the pressure pad to deactivate the force field. Now you can go
through the force field gate to the exit at the top.
</P>

<P>
This next section is a series of random mazes. You have to find 3
special keys. The maze will go on forever until the keys are found.
A key can be found on every 3rd maze, so keep walking up taking the
top exit until you get to the 3rd maze where you will find the first
key. Repeat this process for all 3 keys and you will get out to the
next arena.
</P>

<P>
Destroy the 2 breathers, get the key and blow the wall. Push the
first stone column you come across onto the transporter at the top.
The other columns need to be pushed onto the round buttons on the
floor. Once all the buttons have been covered you will be able to
open the door. Walk right and push the stone column that was
transported up into the hole. You can now walk up to open the door
and take the right exit.

Go right, destroy the orcs and go down. Open the automatic doors
and wait there for the rolling boulder to come. Don't get out of
the way until the last moment in order to let the boulder through
the door. It will then keep rolling until it reaches the pit. The
boulder fills the pit allowing you to walk over it to the bottom
exit.

the right exit into the next arena.
</P>

<P>
Go right along the bottom and collect all the pickups. Go back up
through the arch and collect the bomb on the top left of the arena.
The only way to open the force field gate is to get the orc who is
in the enclosed room, to step on the pressure pad for you. Move up
to the hole on the right and the orc will follow you and step on the
pressure pad. Quickly go around and through the now open gate.
Open the door with a key and take the exit.
</P>

<P>
Push the first stone column you come across up. Move the 2nd column
down and to the left and push it into the pit. Walk over to the
right of the arena and push the top column down and left onto the
pressure pad which will open the force field gate. Push the same
column down into the pit in front of it. Walk up through the now
open gate and destroy the breather. Go down and left to where the 2
stone columns together are. Push the left column down one. Go back
around and push the same column 1 left, 1 up, 3 left, and up into
the pit. Push the other 2 columns up into the other pits. Go left
