<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
Advancement in rank has nothing to do with the amount of credits to
your name. It is releated to the number of missions you complete
and ships destroyed. The only way to earn a lot of credits is to
haggle on the trade-net. By staying in the space station on the
net, and trading in guns, food and gold, you will quickly build a
fortune. Travelling to space stations requires you to jump until
you cannot get any further.

<H2>CHEATS</H2>

<P>
Load the game. Enter the net. Type "HELP", and get yourself an ID
number. Logoff the net. Press the 'BACKSPACE' at the bay doors.
Blast off into space, and find a spaceship for you to trade with and
get his ID number. Enter the net, logon, and press 'T' and
'RETURN'. You should be now in communication mode with the alien.
Say hello, have a chat, keep pressing a key or whatever until he
offers you some goods, such as Hypermint for example. At the
prompt, straight after he has offered you something to buy, enter
"1" and press 'RETURN'. He will say something like no chance, or
sign off. Logoff.
</P>

<P>
Now everything you buy or sell, you will buy or sell it for 1
credit, even if you put 100 credits as an offer, you will still buy
or sell it for 1 credit. This only applies to Black Market trading,
it will not work at a planet or space station.
</P>

<P>
Do same as above but enter a higher number, say "20000" when you
want to sell at a high price. Now, press 'T' and 'RETURN' to talk
to the alien, make certain that you have got something to sell.
Keep pestering him, until he says something like, "Have you got
anything to trade?". When ask for price enter something, but you
get the above set credits
</P>

<P>
The top routine, is only to be used in buying, as it is no good
trying to buy something, when it is set at 200000? Likewise, the
bottom routine is only used for selling, as you are a bit stupid if
you try to sell your wares for 1 credit!
