<H2>CHEATS</H2>

<P>
I'm not too sure if any of the following are official cheats or just
plain bugs. If they are bugs then please note that some of these
may only work on early versions of the game. This is due to the
fact that later copies are allegedly bug free.
</P>

<P>
In the Cemiess system, Precious Metals have a negative price. They
actually pay you to take them away! So you can fly to a
neighbouring system where they have a positive price and amass huge
amounts of money!
</P>

<P>
If you select a system around 650 light years away from your
position you will get an in range fuel reading allowing you to make
jumps of that distance making things much easier on long hauls.
</P>

<P>
To fly anywhere in the galaxy without exhausting your fuel supply.
First go to the map and move the cursor down to between 620 - 660
light years until you come across a system which stays in range and
hyperspace. It also works going up. Which is between 720 - 770
light years. It also works from side to side at approximately the
same range.
</P>

<P>
To get enough money to buy anything you want start at system Lave,
sell your hyperdrive, buy a passenger's cabin, get a passenger, and
then try to buy a cheaper ship (you may have to press '1' instead of
clicking for this to work). Frontier has got a bug, the money you'd
receive if selling your ship to get a cheaper one is added to your
credits, but you never get that cheaper ship because you can't give
your ship away if there are passengers onboard. Repeat this often
enough and you'll never have money problems during the game. This
bug seems to be fixed in the 1.05 version of the game for the Amiga
and in the American PC version.
</P>

<P>
Go to any spaceport, buy a ton of rubbish (this seems to only work
with rubbish), leave the station and then hyperspace to another
system (that's for not being fined for illegal dumping). Make sure
you are in free flight (you can't dump with the autopilot turned on,
and we really are gonna dump something) and accellerating (for not
being hit by dumped cargo). Now do the following: Go to your
ship's inventory. You see all your cargo, and the last should be a
ton of rubbish. You also see the buttons for dumping the Cargo.
Look at the rubbish button, imagine there was one more button below
that and click right there. You just dumped cargo that you haven't
loaded, and your ship gained one ton of space.Do this as often as
you want, but be prepared that dumped cargo might damage your ship.
</P>

<P>
When the military ask you to destroy a target, fly to the planet and
spot the target from space. Then lock on to the target and fly
towards the edge of the planet above it with the time control set to
three arrows. As soon as the distance to the target is below
4,000Kms, fire a missile and the target will be destroyed. This is
an easy way to gain money and rank.
</P>

<P>
When you carry a risky passenger or parcel and you're told you're
going to regret dealing with someone, lock onto the ship that sent
the message and switch to autopilot. The attacking ship will not
fire or fly in your direction, enabling you to destroy it safely.
</P>

<P>
To become ELITE in no time. Buy a mining laser on your front gun
mounting and fly to a suitably sixed body i.e Phobos in orbit around
Mars. Fire at the moon from a range of about 3km and press the
Accelerate time button to the second top setting, whilst holding
down fire. Shortly, a message will appear from the Interpol saying
"Well done, commander" or some such other thing. Click on the time
button again and in a wee while, you will be promoted up one rank!
Keep on doing this and you will become a ferocious ELITE warrior in
no time! P.S If this one takes a few minutes to tell you the
message, don't worry. Also, if the LASER doesn't work on the front,
fit it too the back.
</P>

<H2>SOFTWARE ENHANCEMENTS</H2>

<P>
Making Frontier run on any screen mode is possible with
<a href="aminet/game/patch/Frontier2AGA.lha">Frontier2AGA.lha</a>
from AmiNet/game/patch/. This patches Frontier to use the same
Screenmode base as your frontmost screen. Might even work with
graphic boards (not tested).
</P>

<P>
There also exists a frontier trainer on AmiNet/game/patch/:
<a href="aminet/game/patch/FrntTrn2.lha">FrntTrn2.lha</a>. This
patch allows you to activate a special cheat mode by pressing the
'DEL'-key. Then you can change many of your ship's attributes, you
can even try to fly a thargoid! Having a little falcon with 8000
tons of cargo space, four big plasma guns, any possible equipment,
the acceleration of a missile and a size 8 hyperdrive for jump
distances over 400 ly is no dream any more.
</P>

<P>
For all those of you that always wanted to exit Frontier back to
Workbench / Shell <a href="aminet/game/patch/frontierpatch.lha">frontierpatch.lha</a>
on AmiNet/game/patch/ is what you've been looking for. This patch
allows you to exit Frontier by pressing X in the main screen.
</P>

<P>
For German Frontier/Elite2 users <a href="aminet/game/patch/FrontierGerman.lha">FrontierGerman.lha</a>
on AmiNet/game/patch/ (where else...) fixes some mistakes in the
German translation and adds an exit patch which allows you to exit
Frontier from the mainscreen back to Shell or Workbench by simply
pressing X.
</P>

<P>
And the last one out there for all those Trekkies playing Frontier:
<a href="aminet/game/patch/FrnTREK1.1.lha">FrnTREK1.1.lha</a> on
AmiNet/game/patch/ changes any screen texts to make you feeling
Trekked. The Imperium changes to Romulan, Imperial Courier to
Warbird and so on.

<P>
DONGLES AND OTHER STRANGE BEASTS: There have been reports of
problems with Frontier on an Amiga if a dongle occupies the 2nd
joystick port. If you cannot control your ship because it starts to
spin uncontrollably remove the dongle and try again.
</P>

<P>
SHIPS IN SYSTEM MAPS: Ships are marked in the system map as little
crosses in the color in which the ships would appear on the scanner.
Your own position is marked with a purple dot regardless of the type
of your ship and your hyperjump cloud will be marked with a blue
dot. You will see the blue dot also for the hyperjump clouds of
ships that you had selected before they jumped out of the system.
Sometimes it is even possible to use your cloud analyzer on such
clouds. You can not center the map relative to ship marks.
</P>

<P>
PLANET SELECTION: A planet or station can only be selected if it is
annotated with its name. This annotation is only performed when the
game assumes that the object is clearly visible. The heuristic that
is used for this decision sometimes fails badly. Therefore some
planets can only be selected if the system is zoomed and rotated
until the observer's position is near the planet. Try it with Pluto
in Sol '0, 0'. It really is selectable!
</P>

<P>
AUTOPILOT: Your autopilot tries to fly to your target in a straight
line. If there is a planet between you and your target, the
autopilot will happily try to fly through the planet, crashing you
in the process.
</P>

<P>
If you don't want to risk crashes because of high gravity or other
mishaps that could confuse your autopilot you should always land
using time acceleration at least at level 2. If you don't watch it
too closely your autopilot definitely performs better.
</P>

<P>
DOCKING: Docking your ship in a space station without causing
damage can become a quite complicated task for large ships. You
have to remember that your forward view from a ship like the Panther
Clipper is not centered in the ship but instead you look out of your
forward window that may be high above the center axis of your ship.
As a result you have to aim not at the middle of the docking bay of
a station but at a point somewhere in the upper half of the back
wall of the dock. One nicely working trick is to use the outside
view to look at your ship from a point in front of it and align your
ship such that you look at it from within the station and it keeps
well clear of the dock walls. In a station you may keep your
landing gear up to keep your ship as small as possible.
</P>

<P>
INITIAL TRADING: As a beginner you will want to make fast cash to
be able to buy a better ship that brings you to all the wonders of
the universe. You can earn your money with trading. As a beginner
you should choose a trading route where there is no risk of being
attacked by pirates. Sol and Barnard are two such systems. You can
carry luxury goods from Sol to Barnard and robots back. Sell all of
your initial equipment you don't need, to make room for merchandise.
You won't need missiles, laser or your scanner. As soon as you have
left Merlin (on Ross 154) you can sell your atmospheric shielding
too at the next starport, if you avoid planets with atmosphere in
the future. On the route between Sol and Barnard this will pose no
problem, because there are enough space stations in either system.
Be sure to check the bulletin board when you bring robots to Sol.
Very often you can get a better price there than on the stock
market.
</P>

<P>
You cannot afford Luxury Goods or Computers in the very beginning.
Carry Fruit and Vegetables to Barnard instead until you have enough
cash to switch to more profitable goods. Buy a bigger ship as soon
as you have enough money to pay it AND enough cash to buy some
initial cargo for your new ship too.
</P>

<P>
Another good route in imperial space has been reported to be Facece
to Vequess and back. You can perform military missions on one way
and carry slaves back, if you don't mind the moral implications.
</P>

<P>
CREW MEMBERS: Every day at midnight the bulletin board is updated
and may show new potential crew members.
</P>

<P>
It is a very bad idea to fire someone of your crew. Your reputation
will suffer badly. If you repeat this several times, it will take
you a very long time (sometimes years!) to hire crew members again.
</P>

<P>
PASSENGERS: Passengers want to be delivered to their destination in
one month or less. If they get impatient, they will tell you so,
leave at the next starport and refuse to pay. The main problem is,
that your reputation will suffer badly and future passengers may
even refuse to be transported by you. You can persuade them
sometimes by asking several times. You should be careful with
passengers that tell you, that they owe someone money. They will
most probably refuse to pay at the destination port. For some
systems you need a permit to enter. The only way to get a permit is
to transport a passenger or parcel to such a system. The people
that give you military missions assume that you already have a
permit.
</P>

<P>
CHARITY: If you give money to charity, you will get a better
reputation and people will trust you more. This means that you can
get 10% more money for deliveries, get all or part of the money in
advance and more people will want to work for you (?). Your
reputation will also grow if you succeed with passenger transports
without receiving too much damage to your ship. Therefore giving
away your money is not really necessary if your reputation is not
too bad for passengers to accept you carrying them.
</P>

<P>
DUMPING RADIOACTIVES: One way to get rid of the radioactive waste
from military drives is to dump it into space right out of your
cargo bay. If you are in a system where a strong police force is
watching, this can get you in trouble even if you dump directly
after your jump into the system. In such systems you should simply
sell your waste or (if radioactives are illegal) find a reliable
merchant on the black market who takes it back.
</P>

<P>
You can have loads of fun if you try a few highly illegal dumping
places. A space port is a very nice place to dump your waste on.
Some people prefer to dump their radioactives into the still open
landing bay of an underground spaceport. You can even fling your
waste into a long range cruiser that waits outside of some space
stations. Of course you can do the same with mines for the thrill
of finally seeing a mine hit something!
</P>

<P>
There seem to exist systems where you can get real money for your
radioactives. Look out for systems in the state of civil war.
Sometimes you can sell your radioactives there on the black market.
</P>

<P>
COUNTRYSIDE LANDING: Lower your speed and raise your nose until you
fall with approx. 3 m/s. When you are down to 10-15 m, cut your
speed to 0 and align your nose with the horizon. Don't forget to
lower you landing gear!
</P>

<P>
MINING: Select a system with little or no registered settlers, look
for an unnamed planet above 0 degrees and below 200 degrees without
a starport or station and unload your MB4. Wait a few months and
land near your mining equipment. Pick it up and leave. If you try
again at the same place you will find less and the third time you
will find nothing. This is not dependent on the time you let your
machine work or the amount of minerals the machine has produced.
Only the number of trials counts.
</P>

<P>
A builtin camera (you get it for your first reconnaissance mission)
does not prevent you from using the mining machines. Just use the
camera icon in the near of the mining machine. Frontier will know,
that you don't want to take pictures.
</P>

<P>
FUEL SCOOP FROM A GAS GIANT: Autopilot to the target, aim at the
horizon and set your speed to 15,000 km/h. Use time acceleration
and decelerate to keep the target tunnel frames coming at constant
speed; when the atmosphere gets visible, aim for the middle and
reduce your speed to 4000 km/h, go back to normal time. The fuel
scoop will first fill up the cargo space and then the internal
tanks.
</P>

<P>
FIGHTING: There seem to exist a lot of misunderstandings with
respect to fighting. The first one is, that your movement vector
has to point to your enemy to move towards him. This is not true.
Your movement vector is shown as the vector of your movement with
respect to the currently selected reference mass. This is totally
insignificant for a fight, because there only the relative
velocities of the fighting ships count. This also means, that you
don't have to decelerate for a fight. Your attacker will have a
similar velocity vector as you or he wouldn't stay in your vicinity
for long.
</P>

<P>
Important are the tiny differences in your movement vectors that
result in movements of your ships relative to each other. If you
both fly parallel with 10,000 m/s in the same direction and
accelerate towards each other, this will have the same effect as
when you don't move at all and accelerate towards each other. What
counts is the resulting relative movement. To make a long story
short: Simply ignore your displayed velocity during a fight. It
doesn't matter at all!
</P>

<P>
What does count is your velocity relative to the attacking ships.
You cannot measure it directly, but you can select an attacking ship
and watch the distance change to get an estimate of your velocity.
This is the only velocity information that helps you to maneuver
during a fight.
</P>

<UL>
<LI>Always switch your engines off while fighting and use mouse
direction control and acceleration/deceleration buttons for
maneuvering.

<LI>Ignore the indication of your velocity vector. It is
insignificant for a fight.

<LI>Be careful not to shoot yourself with your own turret mounted
lasers.

<LI>If you attack a ship with your front laser, aim 5 deg past it,
accelerate until near, decelerate and follow accelerating while it
flies by. Shoot it from behind.

<LI>You can shoot incoming missiles: evade with full thrusters,
u-turn, select with annotation (to make the missile visible) and
shoot.
</UL>

<P>
I have developed a standard sequence for fighting that uses a little
cheating to compensate for the very poor HUD and the bad interface
to the functions you need during a fight:
</P>

<OL>
<LI>When the attack warning comes up, stop time.

<LI>Switch off your engines.

<LI>Select the outside view of your ship and zoom out as far as
possible.

<LI>Switch on the id labels to identify the attacker.

<LI>Move the outside view until the attacker rotates into your view.

<LI>Select the attacker and activate your radar scanner to get type
and damage info.

<LI>Remember the position of the attacker on your scanner.

<LI>Switch back to the front view.

<LI>Restart time.

<LI>If you use your front laser, rotate your ship to face the attacker
and use your engines to accelerate at the same time to evade the
initial attack.

<LI>Perform any maneuvers necessary and shoot to get rid of the
attacker.

<LI>Select the system map and reselect your initial target.
</OL>

<P>
Some players find it sufficient to use the id labels, so they don't
have to deselect the original flight target and select the attacker.
I found the distance information the selection provides very helpful
though. Especially when I have to use a powerful laser economically
because it can be fired only a limited time until it overheats and
needs time for cooling.
</P>

<P>
MILITARY MISSIONS: Be careful not to accept military missions that
clearly cannot be finished in time. You will have to look at the
destination starsystem, estimate your travelling time through
hyperspace and the time you need in the target system to reach your
destination. A good distance estimate is to add 10 AU to the
orbital distance of your destination. If your destination is
orbiting another planet use the orbital distance of this planet
instead and add the orbital distance of your destination to the
result.
</P>

<P>
If you don't get missions from your local military agent, don't
despair. Often it is sufficient to change the starport in the same
system to get missions. If all else fails and you don't want to
change the base for your military career, simply make a small
hyperspace jump out of the system and back. In the mean time your
military agent may have changed his mind. If he still has nothing
to do for you you should ask yourself a few questions. Would you
give someone like you military missions? For whom have you worked
in the past? Are you really trustworthy? See, you know the reason!
</P>

ASSASSINATION:

<UL>
<LI>Always save the game before accepting a contract.

<LI>Don't arrive in your target system too early. If the police has
enough time to investigate, the victim will be warned. This makes
it very difficult to finish a contract in systems like 61 Cygni '-1,
1' or Omicron Eridani '2, 0' where you have to travel 40 AU or more
to the next station. Don't even think about a mission for Alpha
Centauri '0, 0' or Cegreth '-1, -3'. Such missions can only be
accomplished if you cheat. For details see the Autopilot Break
below. It seems to be ok. to arrive at the target system about one
week before contract time.

<LI>Don't wait too long in front of the target station or port, the
victim may get frightened and refuse to start. 15 minutes before
contract time seems ok. There seems to be a way to force victims
out of a station if they refuse to start. If you attack the
station, the launch bay must be cleared for the police vipers. If
your victim is in the station, he/she will be in the launch bay and
get forced to start as soon as you attack the station.

<LI>Don't wait directly in front of the station, the victim may run
into you.

<LI>Don't wait directly above a star port. If the launch bay
doesn't close after your start, your victim cannot start.

<LI>You should never try to watch the take off of your victim in
accelerated time. In most cases your victim will sneak past you
while you are dreaming your time away and be gone before you even
know it.

<LI>Don't attack too close to a star port or station, the victim may
try to land again.

<LI>If you have to attack near a star port, don't use missiles too
early. If you do, your victim might try to evade the missile and
crash in the process. If your victim kills himself, you failed.

<LI>You can use missiles to prevent the victim from hyperjumping
while you attack. If you fire a missile before you use your lasers,
the local authorities will charge you only 600 credits for illegal
weapon usage. Otherwise you will get fined 10,000 credits for
piracy and murder. One very nice attack method based on this trick
is to wait at some planet far from your destination until you can
spot your victim on the system map. As soon as it appears, target
it and fire a missile. This is already sufficient to prevent your
victim from hyperjumping and you can approach now and do what you
came for.

<LI>If the victim hyperjumps, use a cloud analyzer and simply
follow. Select the arrival cloud and wait until the victim arrives
or you can be sure it made a misjump. If you are not fast enough to
overtake your victim on the direct route, you can always use a
wormhole route that is nearly always faster. A drawback of the
wormhole route is, that your entry point of the target system may be
far away from the entry point of your victim.

<LI>If you are too far from your victim when he or she starts, use
the system map and watch for a ship mark on the map that belongs to
your victim. Select it and proceed as usual. You can verify your
selection via communication. Don't call, just verify the
registration number.

<LI>If you have more than one assassination on your list, collect
the money for the first one before you try the next. Your employer
seems to actively look for you to pay you and spreads rumors of your
profession in the process. This obviously warns other victims.
</UL>

<P>
With these points in mind I have succeded with every contract (civil
or military) that I have accepted so far. In every case a victim
didn't show up I could find a reason from the list above and
succeeded in the next trial.
</P>

<P>
On the other hand there have been reported lots of problems with
victims not showing up or refusing to land at the port of
destination. Some of these problems seem to stay even if you use
every trick in the book. In such a case your only chance is to
reload a saved game from the time before you accepted the contract.
</P>

<P>
RECONNAISSANCE MISSIONS: One problem with such missions is, to find
your target at all. It should work if you approach the planet until
it nearly fills your screen. If the military base is visible, you
should see it as a grey pixel that can be selected. If you don't
see it, fly to the back of the planet or simply wait a few hours (in
accelerated time) until the planet rotates the base into your view.
The maximum distance to take pictures from is about 80 km. You get
excellent pictures if you fly below 10 km. One nicely working
method for an approach is:
</P>

<OL>
<LI>Use autopilot and maximum time acceleration until you arrive in
the "vicinity of the planet".

<LI>Use time acceleration 3-4 and 50,000 km/h to fly to 7000-8000 km
distance.

<LI>Orbit the planet and lock on the target when it is at the
horizon.

<LI>Save the game.

<LI>Aim a little below the horizon and descend to 1000-3000 m.
</OL>

<P>
On planets with high gravity this is the most difficult part. I
always save a game before actually reaching the planet so I can try
different routes to the target station. The problem on planets with
high gravity is, that you don't get height information until you
cannot decelerate anymore in time to avoid a crash. You have to
approach such planets very carefully. Another problem is, that you
can control you descent only via the velocity readings because you
cannot see your actual velocity vector or the target tunnel with
your nose up high enough to make a controlled descent to your
target. You can aim at your target with your nose up, if you use
the outside view.
</P>

<OL>
<LI>Continue towards your target with 10,000 km/h and time
acceleration 2 until your distance is down to 200 km.

<LI>Decelerate to 5,000 km/h and switch off time acceleration.

<LI>From a distance of 80 km downwards you can take pictures. I
usually fly between the towers or a small distance above. After you
have taken the pictures, accelerate with full power and make your
escape.

<LI>After having taken my pictures I often pick a few interesting
enemies and practice my fighting skills before jumping out of the
system.
</OL>

<P>
A few times I managed to rough land between the buildings of a
target station. The stations don't seem to have a starport, but
only a hangar out of which the interceptors start. It is
interesting to watch them materialize in front of this hangar (and
crash shortly afterwards).
</P>

<P>
Reconnaissance missions to imperial stations are most difficult,
because you are attacked by Imperial Couriers with 20 MW lasers.
For my Asp with up to 10 shields this means that you are history
with only one direct hit. If you fly very low between the buildings
of a target station you must be extremely careful, not to be rammed
by an enemy ship that suddenly appears directly in front of you.
</P>

<P>
BOMBING MISSIONS: If you have succeeded with reconnaissance
missions and shot a lot of excellent pictures you will find bombing
missions very boring. You can fire your nuclear missile from 500 km
distance or even more without adverse effects if the station lies
within your line of sight. The crater that replaces the station
after a successful attack is no hole in the ground. It hovers above
the planet just where the station used to be. If you rough land at
the position of the station you land actually below the crater.
Very strange...
</P>

<P>
RATINGS: If you want to improve your combat rating fast, there is
one simple trick. Buy a Panther Clipper and equip it with about 300
shield generators. It is nearly invincible now. Select a system
with lots of pirates. Anarchies are very nice and some
dictatorships also work very well. Jump into the system and switch
off your engines. Accelerate time to the maximum and wait for the
pirates to come. When they arrive, simply wait. They will crash
into you and you will get the bonus for destroying them. Only one
ship can get dangerous to you and this is the Imperial Courier which
is very often equipped with a 20 MW laser. Fight this one and do it
carefully because once this gun starts to hit you, your shields will
degrade very fast and you don't have the engine power to evade
quickly.
</P>

<P>
After you have cleaned up the system, jump to a neighbor system and
back or still better, simply jump to another anarchy. Repeat until
you run out of fuel, are bored too much or have advanced to ELITE
after 6000 destroyed ships.
</P>

<P>
As soon as you get reconnaissance missions from the military, you
can advance even faster. Pick a mission to a station on a planet
with low gravity and fly towards it. From approximately 500 km
downward you can watch interceptors start continuously. All you
have to do is to reduce your velocity or switch off your engines and
wait until they start crashing into you. In the near of imperial
stations it is not as easy, because you will have to actively fight
the attacking Imperial Couriers that would cut you into pieces
otherwise. They are quite easy to destroy, if you adapt your course
until they approach you in a straight line. Then you can activate
the autopilot and fire as soon as they are in range. As long as you
move to follow one of the Imperial Couriers the others are usually
too clumsy to hit you hard enough to cause damage. Other ships can
safely be ignored. They will crash into you from time to time or
reduce your shields a few percent if they hit you with their lasers.
Keep well above the planet to avoid crash landings.
</P>

<P>
You can accelerate all this still further if you use an energy bomb
to wipe out a lot of enemies with one keypress. This works most
satisfactory if you are surrounded by lots of police vipers after
some little disagreements with the local authorities.
</P>

<P>
SLING SHOT: Aim just past a large gas giant and get fast enough
(700 km/s for Jupiter). Switch off your engines and watch. Speed
and distance are critical. You will have to practice a bit to get
the feeling.
</P>

<P>
SIGHTSEEING: You can fly through all the domes on planets without a
breathable atmosphere and land between the buildings. If you do
this for the transparent domes at Ross 154 you will find in one dome
administration buildings of Vega Line, Sirius Corporation and other
trading houses and in the second dome the usual combination of
concrete blocks and green patches in between with scattered brick
houses. It is definitely fun to fly between the buildings and look
at your surroundings. Agriculture domes are a bit boring, because
they contain nothing more than lots of green balls at ground level.
</P>

<P>
Domes that are not tranparent, can be entered too but contain
absolutely nothing. It is interesting, that they are no obstacle
for you though. At least they are good for some very strange
graphical effects if you land in one of these domes and use your
outside view to look at your surroundings.
</P>

<P>
In every major city with more than the space port and a little
industry you can find little churches with working clocks. The
cities are structured as large blocks of ugly concrete buildings and
patches of green between them with scattered brick houses and every
now and then a little church. Try to rough land in the vicinity of
such a church and watch the clock on the church steeple. Use time
acceleration for better effect. If you are close enough you can
even read the roman numbers on the clock face. The buildings give
you an interesting impression of the size of your ship. A Cobra MK
III looks huge compared with this tiny little church. And have you
ever seen a huge space ship standing in the graveyard behind a
church? It looks definitely strange.
</P>

<P>
At some time in the future I will look for one of the bridges you
can see in the intro sequence of the game. This will be my last
action before voluntary retirement. A kind soul already gave me the
tip to look in the near of New San Francisco on Earth, Sol '0, 0'.
Do you really want me to retire?
</P>

<P>
OTHER GALAXIES: If you use the galactic view and zoom out of the
galaxy you can see lots of other galaxies that are arranged in a
regular grid. These galaxies are all copies of your home galaxy, so
it is really not worth the effort to try and find wormhols to
distant galaxies. There is only one galaxy and a lot of mirror
images.
</P>

<P>
THARGOIDS: A lot of oldtimers from the era of the original Elite
game still remember the menace of the Thargoids and miss them in
Frontier. Nobody has seen a Thargoid in Frontier yet but in an
interview David Braben shall have told that there is a single
Thargoid ship in a system far out in the galaxy. I personally think
this is only a trick to keep us playing Frontier until add-ons
appear. But who knows?
</P>

<P>
If you fly bombing missions to federal bases you can sometimes see
two big violet octagonal ships that look just like the good old
Thargoid ships but they are not disturbed by your approach. Perhaps
the Thargoids sleep for a few hundred years after the exhausting
fight with mankind?
</P>

<P>
ENEMIES ONE AT A TIME: Maximum time acceleration will separate
groups of ships to get them in line, waiting for you.
</P>

<P>
PERFECT AUTOPILOT: Your autopilot always succeeds if you use
maximum time acceleration.
</P>

<P>
PLANET LANDING WITHOUT FUEL: While you still have fuel, use the
autopilot to align with your target planet, switch to maximum time
acceleration and wait for the landing sequence. Switch back to
maximum time acceleration and you are save.
</P>

<P>
ZERO TIME SHOOTING FROM GUN TURRETS: If an attacker approaches, get
him in sight of a laser turret, stop time, select the attacker, aim
the laser and test fire (you see the blue or the explosion light
effect if you hit). Keep firing while releasing the time stop.
Repeat if necessary.
</P>

<P>
MISSILE FIRE WHILE DOCKED: You can fire missiles even from within a
space station. This might help in case of the passenger/no crew
problem described in the Bugs / Bugs section.
</P>

<P>
CERTAIN MISSILE HIT: Switch to maximum time acceleration after
firing the missile. Your missile will hit even if you use a nuclear
missile and/or have 900 km distance to your target.
</P>

<P>
ENGINE UPGRADE FOR IMP COURIER OR IMP TRADER: The only way to get
an upgrade for the non-removable engine in an Imperial Courier or an
Imperial Trader seems to be to let it fail due to maintenance
neglection and then put in a new engine. The new engine will be
fixed just as the original drive. To let time pass in a controlled
way select a route between two star systems an perform lots of
jumps. If you select Barnard <-> Sol, you can sell all your
equipment except for the autopilot and load your ship with fuel for
the jumps. After 10 or 11 months you should stop jumping around to
avoid a misjump. The few remaining days you can simply wait outside
a station until your drive falls off.
</P>

<P>
AUTOPILOT BREAK: You can activate the autopilot for immediate
deceleration from arbitrary high velocities in the vicinity of your
selected target, if you use maximum time acceleration.
</P>

<P>
CRASH AVOIDANCE: Assume you have to perform a mission on some
planet, reached it and find out that you are too fast to be able to
decelerate in time to avoid a crash landing. What can you do? The
correct way is to watch the crash, reload a previously saved game
and try again. The Frontier way is to use time acceleration to
avoid the crash. Simply switch to maximum time acceleration just
before the crash. You will make a big jump through the planet and
be safe at some distance at the other side.
</P>

<P>
This is not really a bug but more or less a consequence of the
implementation of time acceleration. Collisions are detected if
your ship collides with an object at a given time frame of the
simulation. When you accelerate time these time frames are farther
apart and so are your positions in space if you are moving. If your
position at one time frame is above a planet and at the next time
frame on the other side of the planet Frontier will not detect the
collision that should have happened in between.
</P>

<P>
FAST ASCENT TO ELITE: You can use the properties of time
acceleration to acsend to ELITE status very fast, once you get foto
or bombing missions. Just buy a Panther with lots of shields, get
yourself an imperial foto or bombing mission and stop about 10 km
above the target station. Next destroy all ships in your near. You
can use your turrets and the zero time shooting feature to achieve
this. Now you can select the first level of time acceleration. The
ships that now start from the station fly directly into your shields
and are destroyed. The only thing you have to watch very carefully
is your height above the planet. You can expect a 'right on
commander' message every 7 to 10 minutes. These messages reset time
acceleration, so you will have to destroy all ships in your near
again and select time acceleration until the next message comes up.
After a few hours of work you will have advanced to ELITE status.
</P>

<P>
You can not use higher time acceleration levels because then the
destroyed interceptors are not counted.
</P>

<P>
NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE POLICE: If you have been caught selling or
buying illegal goods or having them on board, the police will fine
you. If the officer is not corrupt, you can always lower your fine
to the original amount if you claim you "haven't done it".
</P>

<P>
Most of the bugs can be circumvented in one or another way. The
only bug that really annoyed me is the crash that happens after you
have unloaded a mining machine and leave the system (PC only). This
bug makes the mining part of the game unplayable and should have
been found if the game had been beta tested at all. The many
program confusions and crashes during heavy fights are a nuisance
that can only be partially avoided with frequent game saving.
</P>

<UL>
<LI>The german translation is a complete mess. Most of the time it
gives you crippled nonsense texts and hides important information in
a ruined screen layout. Game and manuals are full of spelling
errors and sometimes you have to translate text back to English to
be able to understand it at all.

<LI>The protection scheme sometimes gets confused and asks for the
first letter of e. g. page 8238,line 27764, word 29263.

<LI>The attack and missile warnings and the "photograph taken"
message stay on the screen much too long, hiding vital scanner
information. In case of an attack warning you can stop time as soon
as the warning is given, select the attacker and start normal time
again. The warning is sometimes repeated, but then you already have
some hints about the position of the attacker.

<LI>In some systems (mostly large systems with more than one sun, e.
g. Cegreeth '-1, -3]' the reference mass selection is broken and
will not switch to the nearest planet or station. In some cases it
is sufficient to avoid the autopilot and fly by hand. In some
systems even this does not work (because of discretization problems
if the reference mass is too far away?) and the target will jump
around wildly. Sometimes it helps not to use maximum time
acceleration or fly by hand. If this does not help either:

<OL>
<LI>Avoid such systems.

<LI>If you absolutely have to dock or land in such a system use the
autopilot to accelerate under maximum time acceleration, switch off
your engines until you are 1-2 AU from your target and reactivate
autopilot (still under maximum time acceleration) to decelerate and
teleport to your target.

<LI>If 2. fails, try again from another angle.
</OL>

<P>
Reconnaissance missions to such systems are very difficult, because
you cannot use the teleport-and-decelerate trick. Furthermore the
drawing of the target planet gets totally inconsistent with the
drawing of the station to be filmed, resulting in "flying" stations
that seem to be located above the planet and other strange effects
that make navigation by hand a matter of pure luck. I got such
missions to Micanex C,Da '3, -4' and Hoethan A,B3b '3, -5'.
</P>

<LI>Bombing missions for systems like Candaess '2, -4' lead to
problems too. You cannot hit the flying station above Candaess
A,B1b because the nuclear missile seems to have a fixed velocity
between 15,000 and 25,000 km/h. Because the gravitation reference
is never switched to the planet, you have to adjust your velocity
relative to Candaess C,D. In my case I had to select around 28,000
km/h to be able to approach the station at all. Whenever I fired my
missile it somehow decelerated and never reached the station. The
only trick that worked was to fire the missile from a distance
around 900 km and use the missile-hit feature/bug to destroy the
station. You can do this only from a great distance because you are
unable to switch to full time acceleration if the interceptors are
near you.

<LI>In systems with a central supergiant, the simulation of this sun
is broken. In the Betelgeuse system '59, 14' I got no gravitational
effect of the central sun and could fly right through it. The
displayed disk sometimes transformed into a rotating rectangle (e.
g. at 1.39 AU distance) and sometimes vanished completely (e. g.
at 0.8 AU distance). The supergiant was never selected as reference
mass.

<LI>If you are near a planet that was not selected as reference mass
(see above), you can watch the same effects for this planet as have
been described for supergiants.

<LI>Sometimes the scanner may fail without damage report. All
systems seem to be ok., but the scanner doesn't show the attacking
ships. It has been reported that you can fly through these ghost
ships without damaging them or you. This seems to happen mostly in
the near of the famous "flying" stations above planets that have not
been selected as reference mass. The attacking ships also fire at
you but seem to be unable to hit.

<LI>Be careful not to accept delivery missions to systems without
bases or spacestations. You might not be able to deliver.

<LI>You sometimes get reconnaissance or bombing missions from the
military that are impossible to accomplish, because there is no
planet in the denoted system. These missions are cancelled as soon
as you select them but they stay in the mission list.

<LI>If you are stuck in an underground base but have enough fuel and
your engines are ok., there is no safe way to start but you can try
out a few alternatives that have been reported to work in some
cases:

<OL>
<LI>Use maximum time acceleration just after you have got launch
permission. When you get the message that your launch time expired,
switch to maximum time acceleration again.

<LI>Build up a little motion, pull up your landing gear and use
maximum time acceleration to warp through the wall.

<LI>Buy lots of shields and fly through the wall.

<LI>Perform takeoff as if all were normal (up gear, increase
throttle, pull up nose) this might result in your ship starting
normally.
</OL>

<P>
For some of these methods a few retries might help (save the game
before you try anything!). If nothing else helps, select a target
for a hyperjump and force a misjump via 'ALT' + 'F8'.
</P>

<LI>Some versions of the game for the Amiga don't allow you to jump
into the van Maanens '0, 1' system. Neighbor systems are reachable
without problem, the star map shows the system as reachable but you
cannot trigger the hyperjump to van Maanens.

<LI>On planets with a breathable atmosphere you are sometimes
cleared for landing on pads that are already occupied by other ships
that seem to have landed far from their destination pad.

<LI>Mountains are sometimes placed directly on the landing pads of a
starport on planets with a breathable atmosphere.

<LI>Sometimes a starport is reported to be busy even if there are
free landing pads and no incoming ship exists that may have been
assigned to the pad.

<LI>If you do not have enough crew and a fugitive passenger on
board, someone might attack you from outside a station, preventing
time acceleration to wait for enough crew and (through the
passenger) also the selling of your ship. The only way to solve
this dilemma seems to be to use the missile bug to shoot the
attacker from inside the station (?).

<LI>The autorefuel system may magically empty your internal tanks if
you try to fill them by hand. I had this effect in a Panther
Clipper once even without the autorefuel system.

<LI>When a passenger gets impatient waiting to be delivered and
leaves at the next starport, you get cabins that are falsely
reported occupied, preventing you from selling your ship or using
the cabin again. The only way out of this situation seems to be to
buy an escape capsule and use it at the next opportunity. You will
lose your ship but you can at least buy a new one.

<LI>If you have more than one MB4 mining machine, you must always
deal with the last one on your list first. If you by accident
destroy or even sell another one first, the game crashes (?).

<LI>Do not leave a system with mining gear left behind. The game
will crash. This seems to be a problem that appears only in the PC
version. As in the missile fire bug on the Panther this is a bug in
the EMS handling that hits you whenever you hyperjump.

<LI>If, as a result of your asteroid mining operation, many objects
appear in your neighborhood, the game may crash (?).

<LI>You have not fulfilled a killing contract if your victim
crashes.

<LI>If you fly towards the horizon of a planet, strange graphical
effects may happen, showing pie slices of the planet flashing
everywhere. Also the horizon may jump wildly up and down.

<LI>The same effect happens if you are in the midst of a fight at
the right height above a planet. Your enemies will wildly jump
around making them impossible to hit. Interesting enough they don't
seem to have the same problems.

<LI>You can fly through mountains, transparent domes, buildings and
the walls of spaceports.

<LI>On some star ports ships of contract targets seem to be unable
to start without crash. This happens preferably on planets with
gravity comparable to earth gravity or higher. Example: Lion
Transport in Manchester City on Matthews World in Behoqu '2, -4'.
The only workaround I have found is to avoid contracts to such
targets.

<LI>The height calculations are broken on some planets, e. g. on
Hoopers World in 82 Eridani, where I got a distance reading of 0.65
km for a target that was at the starport (not yet started!) and my
height was shown as 2345 meters. Another example is Mitterand's
World in Liabeze '2, -4'.

<LI>For the upper gun turret on the Tiger Trader at elevation angles
above 50 deg, 5 MW beams fill the whole lower screen or strange
crossing beams are shown, hiding possible targets.

<LI>Missiles that are fired from a Panther Clipper crash immediately
without hitting anything except the own ship. This makes many
bombing missions impossible to accomplish with a Panther. The bug
only appears after hyperspace jumps (EMS access on the PC) and you
can avoid it if you dock at a station or land at a starport before
you try to fire a missile. You can shorten the extra time you need
for this if you use the Autopilot Break to reach the point of your
intermediate landing as early as possible. This makes bombing
missions to systems with spaceports possible but still leaves a lot
of impossible cases.

<LI>The trajectory drawing for planets or stations shown in the
system map sometimes gets confused and draws straight lines from one
point of the trajectory to the screen border.

<LI>A jump into the Beta Lyrae system '-146, 85' crashes the game.

<LI>The attempt to get system info for the Andolqu system '-76, 29'
crashes the game.

<LI>If you select system info for an unexplored system, you get the
info for the last selected explored system.

<LI>If you select population info for an unexplored system, the game
may crash.

<LI>Sometimes you may get a starport reported to be located on a
sun. While being docked at Gilmour Orbiter in Tau Ceti, system info
showed a starport on the sun Exbephi B '-1225, -853'. The starport
vanished when I jumped into the system. Also a population of
100,000 to 1 Million was reported for Ethfala '-2174, -879' which is
a binary system without planets!

<LI>If you recenter the star map to your position you will still get
the system info of the system you looked at before recentering until
you have moved the cursor away from your current system and back.

<LI>Sometimes a selected star is not surrounded with the green
circle at the position of the star but at the wrong end of the pin
which shows the system's height with respect to the galactic
ecliptic.

<LI>The ships section of the documentation contains at least 19
errors.

<LI>The masses of Panther, Kestrel and Hawk do not add up to the
total mass of 1775t, 20t and 18t respectively.

<LI>The reverse thrusters of the Eagle MkII are way too weak to be
meant this way. The available 4g should probably be 14g.

<LI>If you switch between the status screens of your display, your
ship may get drawn erroneously on the contract list page.

<LI>In the repair section of the shipyard, hull damage is not
measured relative to the actual hull weight and can exceed the
actual hull weight by a large amount.

<LI>After a heavy fight the repair section of the shipyard may get
confused. I once got as a damage report the message of the police
officer that arrests you if you haven't paid your fines. The repair
costs were 26315 credits.

<LI>Another effect in a similar situation produced damage reports
for all my thrusters that kept reappearing at each entry of the
repair screen even after repair. Save and restore of the game
didn't help. I had to return to a saved game from before the fight.

<P>
The effect can be reproduced if you buy a new ship and immediately
buy a new drive for it. If you now enter the repair screen, all
your thrusters are reported to be damaged. You can try to repair
them with very strange effects that cause repaired thrusters to get
damaged from the repair of other thrusters. If you have succeeded
with the repair and no thruster is reported damaged anymore, you
will get the old damage reports again the next time you enter the
repair screen.
</P>

<P>
The effect can be ignored and will vanish after you have refueled
and taken off to the next starport.
</P>

<LI>You can get game crashes during a fight. A few times I got
strange beeps from the speaker in my PC that got lower and lower
until the game froze. The exect situation was a fight where I was
receiving damage by an enemy laser when he was hit by my front laser
simultaneously.

<LI>The ejection system may be triggered if you try to rough land
with a large ship (?).

<LI>If you crash during a failed attempt to rough land, the game may
crash with a memory exception.

<LI>The system map allows centering on planets only if the planet is
annotated with its name. The annotation sometimes happens only
shortly before the planet vanishes from the screen. For some
planets it is very difficult to find a rotation/zooming combination
that works, for some planets like Phiagre A,B2 '1, -3' I have not
yet found a setting that makes the planet selectable.

<LI>When you have docked at a station using maximum time
acceleration, the system map still shows your position outside the
station.

<LI>If you hyperjump while traffic control is warning you you will
get a final warning message and a fine from the star system you jump
into.

<LI>In early versions of the game for the Amiga there is a bug that
may confuse the bulletin board that then shows parts of the
stockmarket section. One trick to avoid this problem is to always
return to the top of the bulletin board before leaving it. If the
damage is done, you can accelerate time to wait until midnight. The
bulletin board will then be reset and corrected.

<LI>The manual states that the game is completely playable via
keyboard, but I have not found an equivalent to a right mouse click
on the keyboard. Therefore rotation control for the system and
sector maps seems to be dependent on the mouse.

<LI>A mouse click that misses a function icon or the scanner display
in the lower part of the screen deselects the current target. As a
consequence you often have to reselect your target only because you
missed some icon by a small amount.

<LI>Released mouse keys sometimes keep autorepeating.

<LI>The joystick cannot be calibrated and is way too imprecise (even
with a high quality joystick).

<LI>If the system map would follow the events outside, you could
watch your progress in the map without having to switch repeatedly
between main view and map.

<LI>It should be possible to center the system map relative to a
displayed ship.

<LI>There should be a possibility to fast zoom out of the system map
just enough to make your ship or the next planet visible.

<LI>It would be nice to have a stack of autopilot targets: select
your flight target, push it and select a target for a fight, return
to your flight target...

<LI>If you don't use the autopilot, it is very difficult to land on
planets with high gravity, because you have no easy way to estimate
your current position relative to the planet without deselecting
your target. It would be nice to have a switchable height meter
that gives you readings all the time (not only from 50.000 m
downwards) in addition to your information about the target
distance. Also some velocity information like rate of descent and
velocity with respect to the planet surface would be extremely
helpful. Why not switch to a HUD that contains this information in
the near of a planet, if your autopilot is not activated?
