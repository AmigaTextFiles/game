<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Traveling through time you do battle in one of the most destructive
combat systems available, the Walker. Jumping from one historical
battlefield to the next you blast everything in sight as wave after
wave of combatants fall under your twin gattling cannons. Decimating
your foes, the Walker works toward its ultimate goal: the
destruction of your present day enemy. With a unique control system
that allows you total control of the Walkers movements and attack
capabilities, uou can take your Walker to new heights in destructive
power.

<H2>CHEATS</H2>

<P>
As soon as you appear on level two (don't move the walker at all),
type "EAT LEAD MUDDY FUNSTER".

<P>
On the title screen (the one where it says press fire to start)
simply type in "WALKER" and a red line will appear in the center of
the screen. Now during play, try any of these cheat key
combinations (you may have to hold them for 5 seconds):
