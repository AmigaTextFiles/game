</P>

<P>
Go back into the cave to the right and use the rope with the planks.
</P>

<P>
Use the bound planks with the stone to cross the gap and enter the

<P>
A closer look at the sword reveals a catch, use the catch and then

the way.
</P>

<P>
Open the trap and then use the cauldron (change the copper ball) on
the acid, you'll need to use it twice with the acid (see #34)empty
the trap. A mechanism will now be visible in the side of the trap,
all you have to do is push the keystones in combination. A secret
hide will open in the back wall, you'll find either elixir or an
effigy. If you find the elixir just push the keystones again and
this time an effigy will appear. If you get the effigy first then
don't bother about the elixir, you won't need it.
</P>

<P>
Now go back and take a closer look at the stele. Use the acid with
the stele and read the runes, these will tell you what to do with
the sun and moon stone. Put the sunstone in the square-shaped niche
first and then the moonstone on top of that. All you have to do now
is put the effigy in the other niche and hey presto! you've opened
the Stele.
</P>

<P>

the flute to summon Urm and give him the strawberries, he'll then
give you a bar of gold. Use the gold with the half-statue and then
use the fish statuette with the water, you'll then be able to swim
across. If you have the elixir then you can use that on the monster
instead and then cross the bridge.
</P>

<P>
Try and pick up the massive strawberries-Urm will beat you to it and
eat them all! But he'll leave you a huge pile of gold. Pick up the
sword and use it with the rock this will block one of the holes.
Use the cauldron with the hole just in front of the pile of
gold, then just point at the hole on the bottom right hand edge of
the platform to chase the orvivor Grab the flying beastie and use it
on the pile of gold, clearing the path allowing you to continue.
</P>

<P>
Pick up the torch. Use the venom with the snake to change it back
into quartz. Pick up the tiara and use it with the copper ball to

parchments to change the shape of you and the dragon, keep using
them until you change the dragon into a wasp. Use the trap on the
wasp and then use the flute to summon Urm again. Give the cherries
to Urm and then use him on the wasp trap, he'll move it out the way.
Exit to the right of of the screen.
</P>

<P>
This bit is a bit difficult to explain as the puzzle is different
each time you'll load it in. Use Petroy on the mechanism and he'll
give you a clue on how to solve the puzzle. Basically, the puzzle
consists of 4 stones and you'll have to press them in a certain
order to open the door. Pick up the phial below the mechanism
before you leave the the room.

at the fountain and pickup the lichen, place it on the hearth. Push
the numbered teeth in the right order to start the water flowing,
the combination is: -12, 4, 6, 3. Use the phial on the enclave and
use the rag with the water. Place the wet rag on the coil and then
push the stone. Pick up the magnifying glass and use with the beam

not quick enough plugging the hole at first.
</P>

<P>
Pick up the key and use it on the lock to open the door. Go into

you:
</P>

<P>

<P>
Venom + Pollen --- Growing Potion - Makes Plants grow<BR>
Venom + Truffle -- Luciferys ------ Turns rubys into fire<BR>

click on the lever. Pick up the key and go back outside.
</P>

<P>
Change the cauldron into the sword, use it with the bushes and use
the key in the lock to open the door. Now, change the sword back

</P>

<P>
Ok now it gets a bit tricky, use Petroy on the hidaways in the room
and he will tell you the number of each one. This diagram should
help you understand how to lower the drawbridge.
</P>

<P>
<PRE>Room       /\/\/\/\/\/\     Key

                __ 4
   __          |__|         ----    = Drawbridge
3 |__|</PRE><TT>
</P>

<P>
Touch inside hideaway number 4 (next to the statues hand), Click on
it three times until the monster spits some glue at you. Use the
bowl with glue to pick it up. Use the glue on the firefly and then
use the firefly glue with hidaway number 1. Pick up the broken
jewel. Use the glue on the flawed jewel and then use the flawed
jewel on the broken jewel.
</P>

<P>
Change to the sword into the cauldron and mix up some more Vitalys.
Use it on the jewel to bring it to life. Change the cauldron back
into the sword and use it on the crack. Pick up the firefly when it
lands. Use the firefly on hideaway number 3. Pick up the jewel which
appears next to the drawbridge and bring it to life with some more
Vitalys.
</P>

<P>
Turn the cauldron back into the sword and use it with the crack.
When the firefly lands pick it up. Use the glue with the firefly
and use it with hideaway number 4. Pick up the twig, use it with
the opening and then pick up the jewel. Change the sword into the
cauldron, again! and mix up another batch of Vitalys. Use the
Vitalys on the jewel to bring it to life. Change the cauldron into
the sword and use it on the crack. Pick up the firefly when it
lands, use the glue with it. Use the firefly/ glue with hideaway
number 5. Use the copperball with the hole and then push the
copperball to reveal a lever, pick up the jewel.
</P>

<P>
Ok, now you will have 5 lit hideaways, each containing a lever.
When any of the levers are used a stone pedestal will rise in the
middle of the room. When the levers are used in a certain
combination `ALL' the letters on the back wall will light up, it
doesn't matter if all of the stone pedestals aren't raised as they
will automatically come up when you have lit up all the letters.
This is the combination I used but you can use any combination as
long as you have all the letters lit up at the same time:
</P>

<P>
LEVER - Use # Of Times 
</P>

<P>
1 ----- 1<BR>
2 ----- 2<BR>
3 ----- 3<BR>
4 ----- 4<BR>
5 ----- 5
</P>

<P>
Once you have lit all the letters, use the bow to fire arrows at the
letters to spell the word `K R A A L'. Be careful with your aim if
you hit the wrong letter all the lights will go out! If you do this
right the drawbridge will open.
</P>

<P>
Pick up the heart by the skull. Click on the nail on the left wall,
just above the skull. Keep clicking on the nail until you manage to
pull it out of the wall.
</P>

<P>
This diagram of the lock will help you understand how to escape.
</P>

<P>

</P>

<P>
Alright, now insert the nail into hole number 6 (see above) and click
on the needle. Now one of the bars will rise, move the pointer below
the bar while it's up and you'll discover a pin.
</P>

<P>
Now all the carving of the two suns means is that you insert the
nail into hole number 7 on the right dial and the pin into hole
number 3 on left dial. Now, click on both of the needles and all
the bars should go up! Before you leave the cell don't forget to
put the heart into the heart-shaped orifice on the right of the
screen.
</P>

<P>
Okie Dokie, you're nearly there now, so dont give up! As soon as
you get on to this screen click on the levers straight away.
Now, you must get this be right or you'll mess it up and it will be
game over. You'll see 3 levers on the screen.
</P>

<P>

</P>

<P>
Starting from the right with lever no.3 move it all the way down
then back to the top again, a total of 4 clicks. Do the same with
lever no.2 and then with lever no.1. If you have done this right
the swinging blade will slow down.
</P>

<P>
Click on the carving and type in "DJEL" the hideaway above will open
up. Pick up the knife and the bamboo. Use the knife with the
bamboo, and you'll begin to carve a flute. Use the knife with the
flute again to finish making it and then use it to summon Urm. Pick
up the stone and then use it in the hole in the carving. Now, type
in the name "AZEULISSE" the other hideaway will now open. Pick up
the statue and use it with the other statue in the first hideaway.
Pick up the grains of sand and use them in the Revuus. Thats all
folks!
