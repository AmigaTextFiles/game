<P>
Get your man outside the ring and pick up the steel chair to beat up
any harder Fighters that you are having trouble with. This should
help you to get further.
</P>

<P>
When you are about to go into a joystick waggling battle, follow
these steps:
</P>

<OL>
<LI>Pause the game
<LI>Plug the mouse into the joystick port you are using
<LI>Unpause the game, and move the mouse rapidly from side to
side. This will enable you to waggle quicker than your
opponent
<LI>When your character has won the move, pause the game and
plug the joystick back in
<LI>Repeat this whenever you get into a grapple
</OL>

<P>
Place the chair outside the ring (next to the bottom left turn
buckle) just up a bit. Now jump into the ring and you should have
the chair.
</P>

<P>
Climb up on to a corner post, and instead of jumping into the ring,
jump the other way. Weird gravity!
</P>

<P>
During a two player practice game, get 1 player to climb onto the
top of the top left turnbuckle, then get player two to be as close
as possible to him. Player two should drop and kick the player,
then he will turn into a "ghost". He can pick up the chair and
take it into the ring. Press 'Esc' then compete for the title,
and the chair will still be there.
</P>

<P>
Pause and type "HULKHOGANWEARSTIGHTYELLOWKNICKERS" and then unpause
the game. The fight will then finish with you as the winner.
</P>

<P>
During play, use the numeric keypad and type "14785963". Now press
'RETURN' to skip levels.
</P>
