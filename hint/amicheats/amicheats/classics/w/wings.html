<H2>CHEATS</H2>

<P>
Each letter of the word wings on the main menu does something. To
access them hold down 'CTRL', 'L SHIFT', and 'L ALT' while holding
down the right mouse button. Keep holding the keys and the right
mouse button and click on the letters with the left mouse button.
</P>

<P>
"W" ---------------------------- Music on/off<BR>
"I" - Turns caps lock into an autofire button<BR>
"N" ---------------------- Skip flight school<BR>
"G" ----------------------------------- Guess<BR>
"S" -------- Save game without having to exit
</P>

<P>
To access the cheat mode you have to go to flight school. To get
an awesome pilot click on the bullseye on the airplane at the top
of the flight school menu. The screen will either flash or you
will get a requestor asking if you want to quit (say no). Then
create a new pilot with the name "Orca The Killer Tomato" type as
it's printed. Orca doesn't need school. To access a menu option
(much of which is no longer useful or active) create a new pilot
and name him " Who is The Riddler". Make sure to put the two
spaces before the name. Don't use the 'RETURN' key to enter it,
hit the 'ESC' key instead. Now follow the prompts.

<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
BALLOON BUSTING: The first thing to do in Balloon Busting missions
is to take out the AA gun. It isn't too hard so give it a try.
</P>

<P>
DOG FIGHTS: When involved in a dog fight with other planes always
attack from above. This is because if you attack from below the
other plane will climb which is very annoying. By attacking from
above you drive the other plane down rather than up.
</P>

<P>
BEING TAILED: When you are being tailed hold the joystick to the
bottom-right. You should turn off to the right and out of the other
planes line of fire.
