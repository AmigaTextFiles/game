<H2>TIPS</H2>

<H3>LEVEL 1: Mor the deserted planet</H3>

<P>
Mor never was, in fact, a populated planet. Its distance to its sun
was far too great for any form of intraterrestial life to evolve.
However, many living entities frequently visit Mor, and the lesser
hoodlums of the Great System use it as their hiding and meeting
site. Acts of cleansing have failed due to lack of general
interest. There is no vegetation on Mor, and the planet is very
poor with valuable minerals, however the beautiful stone structures
never cease to amaze and amuse tourists.
</P>

<P>
The Tourist Agency for Eccentrics has included Mor in its network,
and because of that, built passages up to the city of Zeli.
</P>

<H3>LEVEL 2: The city of Zeli</H3>

<P>
The city of Zeli was built to honour the goddess Zeli, the chief
deity of the ancient people. Legend says Zeli hates everything
decorative and superfluous and prefers effectiveness over beauty,
due to which the city includes many fascinatingly elaborate devices,
which many cultural races nowadays use. Some information sources
claim that the temple is now inhabited with a religious tribe known
as the Children of Zeli, who wish to follow in their ancestors'
footsteps.
</P>

<P>
The ancient people have even included in their constructions
passages down to Mor and up to the world of dreams.
</P>

<H3>LEVEL 3: The world of dreams</H3>

<P>
There has always been a world of dreams, though not always in this
very form. This particular world of dreams was born when a little
human child dreamed up his own paradise. When the child matured,
the world of dreams became concrete, and nowadays attracts many
visitors due to its natural beauty. Since the gravity in the world
of dreams is freely variable, structures can float in air in curious
formations.
</P>

<P>
The child's wakening from his sleep caused passages down to the city
of Zeli and up to the wheat fields to appear.
</P>

<H3>LEVEL 4: The wheat fields</H3>

<P>
The wheat fields are vast. Their total area is greater than that of
an average planet. Amazingly, very few beings live on the fields,
for they are not needed to control them. The wheat tries to take
care of itself, in which it usually succeeds. The lack of
maintenance and supervision attracts pests and criminals. The
fields are the main food source of the Great System. Many
institutions buy their wheat directly from the fields.
</P>

<P>
For export of the wheat, passages down to the world of dreams and up
to the temple of Stagm have been constructed.
</P>

<H3>LEVEL 5: The temple of Stagm</H3>

<P>
The temple of Stagm was built to honour Stagm, who is the equivalent
of a devil in the ancient people's mythology. The temple is very
small, because very few ancient people wanted any part in
constructing such a foul temple, and thus the temple had to be kept
small due to lack of workforce. However nowadays people take
religious matters less seriously, and people have started to like
Stagm and his followers again.
</P>

<P>
Foreseeing events of this type, the ancient people have decided to
include passages down to the wheat fields and up to the ice caverns
of fear.
</P>

<H3>LEVEL 6: The ice caverns of fear</H3>

<P>
The ice caverns of fear are a cold, hostile place. No beings live
there in any form of permanent residence and very few even visit
them, because it is so cold there. The greater thugs of the Great
System use the caverns as their hiding and meeting place. Acts of
cleansing have failed due to far too hostile conditions. It is a
shame that the caverns are so hostile and deserted, for they contain
many fascinating ice structures.
</P>

<P>
On the ground, some of the ice has melted, creating passages down to
the temple of Stagm, and up to Unspace.
</P>

<H3>LEVEL 7: Unspace</H3>

<P>
Some beings say Unspace is a boring place. To other beings it is
very fascinating. It is not clearly known what Unspace actually is,
but the most accurate analyses show that it consists of all the
matter which was permanently lost in other places, and has sculpted
itself into beautiful forms in Unspace. Some beings have even been
reported to intentionally lose matter in a place, and then travel to
Unspace to enjoy the matter there.
</P>

<P>
All disused passages in other places have here evolved into passages
down to the ice caverns of fear, and up to Mysteria.
</P>

<H3>LEVEL 8: Mysteria</H3>

<P>
There is no official coverage on Mysteria. In fact, according to
the head of the Great System, it does not even exist. However,
daring explorers and adventurers claim to actually have been to
Mysteria. Their speech is tainted with rumour, but it seems that
Mysteria includes giant bubbles. These may float on top of a form
of solid floor, but mostly the structure of Mysteria is so far
unknown.
</P>

<P>
The explorers and adventures say that they have departed from this
place via passages leading down to Unspace.
