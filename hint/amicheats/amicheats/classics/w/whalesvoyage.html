<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
If you're building up a team, you should take care for an expressive
kind of profession. It is strongly recommended to select two
professions that are mentally privileged, and two professions having
their privilege in physical abilities.
</P> 

<P>
Regarding the different characters, you should take care to follow
these rules:
</P>

<DL>
<DT>Soldier:
<DD>A Soldier requires to be full of power and health. His
dexterity will effect in favour of his aiming accuracy while in
combat. Don't expect him to talk like a rhetorics professor,
though.

<DT>Aranian:
<DD>An Aranian is 'good' at everything, but NEVER 'excellent'. He
needs to possess a certain amount of power, mental energy and
health. With an Aranian joining your party, you'll get a monk
skilled in fighting, who also got magical powers and rhetorical
abilities.

<DT>Psionician:
<DD>A Psionician is VERY BAD in fighting and of poor health, but
anyway he may be useful for your team because he's able to cast the
most powerful spells (Brain Blast, Resurrection... ) and he is a
very skilled talker.

<DT>Medicin:
<DD>A Medicin is not a particularly good fighter, but very
experienced in talking and always of full health. He hardly knows
any fighting spells, but almost any kind of healing methods.

<DT>Biochemist:
<DD>A Biochemist fights the average way; he's experienced with
essences and able to make use of technical skills.

<DT>Headhunter:
<DD>A Headhunter is very used to the rough way of life from the
gutters. He's a very good fighter, acts very quickly, he's not dumb
and a little bit skilled in talking, too.

<DT>Everyone:
<DD>May be activated as a Closer. But you should only activate a
Closer while in PURSUIT, otherwise you would have to re-open every
single door all the time.

ANNOTATIONS:
</P>

<P>
<SUP>1)</SUP> This character should be used as a carrier of your
smaller extras you will be collecting during the game, because his
load will soon grow too heavy if he carries too heavy items.
</P>

<P>
<SUP>2)</SUP> This character can (and thus should) be used to carry
your heavy weapons, he's the most suitable character for assigning
this task to.
</P>

<H2>SOLVE</H2>

<P>
In this solution, we're going to focus on the following party: an
Aranian, a Soldier, a Psionician and a Headhunter. Other
combinations, however, are also possible.
</P>

<H3>ON THE 'WHALE'</H3>

<P>
At first, you need to land on Castra, because you're starting as a
character devoid of any financial powers.
</P>

<P>
Now go to Greg Morgan (at the west side in a niche after you've
crossed a shopping passage) and ask him what he's doing and how you
could help him. The only way of killing time is to roam around,
because you cannot get hold of a shrinking device at this early
stage.
</P>

<P>
Towards south of Castra, you can see an old man being hit from
two hooligans. Chase them away and lend the old man (it's George
McMil) a hand so that he's able to stand up. If you talk to him,
you will get his phone number you should write down somewhere.
</P>

<P>
Getting to Walter Wim, the weaponer, he excitedly tells you that
his daughter Winnie has disappeared. You can find Winnie near the
passage where you just met Greg Morgan before. So just go there,
get her and give her back to her father. Thankfully, he hands you a
rifle gun, a pistol, a thermo grenade and ammo. Let the Soldier
take the rifle and load it. The Aranian should take the grenade and
the second pistol. Equip both characters with the weapons.
</P>

<P>
You should've reached the second level now. Instruct the
Attacker how to reload the weapon automatically and to activate it
at once. The Headhunter should learn how to manipulate computers.
All other skills can be assigned according to your feelings, but
beware that any use of mental skills (that will cost you a lot of
energy) cannot be made unless you've reached the higher levels.
This means, it's not sensible to use it at earlier stages because
you would only keep wasting precious energy.
</P>

<P>
Leaving the store, you're robbed by a thief whom you need to
shoot down.
</P>

<P>
Now you can make your way towards Max Flesh's store in the
southwest corner of the city. If you like, you can buy a compass or
similar things, but take care to save up at least 720 credits for
you. Here, while you're talking with the men, you get the mission
to bring a heart to Lapis to a guy named Jack Nock. This mission
will reward you 100000 Credits!! Taking the heart, you find out
really soon that other obscure guys are behind this organ as well.
Now you have to escape as fast as you can (beam yourself up to the
'Whale')!
</P>

<P>
On the 'Whale': at first, call George McMil, who can provide
you with a shrinking device he sends to you via 3D Fax because of
his great thankfulness. Use this device to beam yourself to Penthe
and to meet Greg Morgan. Shrink him and you get to know that he
also knows Jack Nock well, and that he wants to get to him, too.
Pick up the CD Morgan's image is saved on and beam yourself back to
the 'Whale'.
</P>

<P>
Here, you gas up (approx. 700 units ), in order to be able to
make it to Lapis, and start.
</P>

<P>
In Lapis, you'll meet a guy named Krueger. He insists on being
able to get everything imaginable, but he points out that he needs 3
weeks each to get it. This guy will become really useful much
later. Furthermore, he's telling you about a new disease, called
'Hypo Coco'.
</P>

<P>
Look for Jack Nock (near the stair-shaped house in the northern
east side of the city). If you give the heart to him, you'll be
rewarded with 100000 Credits ! He is also pointing out to be able
to un-shrink the go-between. Giving the CD to him, you get to know
Greg Morgan to be a deceiver who had wanted to get to Jack Nock to
kill him and snatch the heart. Yes, Greg Morgan must be eliminated.
Jack Nock is very concerned Morgan had been killed by the party, and
he asks you to come back later. Now you can use the money that you
own now for trading items.
</P>

<P>
If you do NOT have an Economy Scanner among your inventory yet,
you should take raw materials from Lapis or Inoid to the technized
planets (eg Castra), and high-tech goodies to the less difficult
cities. Equip the 'Whale' well with weapons and protector screens,
in order to defend yourself against possible attacks of pirates.
</P>

<P>
Now head to Lapis to Jack Nock's home. Arriving at his flat,
you realize he has been killed. Search his dead body thoroughly,
and you will find a scrap of paper with a phone number written on
it. You can see the heart nowhere anymore, though.
</P>

<P>
Back on the 'Whale', you should call the number written on the
scrap of paper, and from an unfriendly voice, you'll get to know
that this heart has probably been taken to Inoid and that it's on
you to get it back.
</P>

<P>
It's strongly adviced to visit the local merchants on every
planet you're travelling to, in order to get the newest weapons. To
minimize the loss, you should sell your old weapons and some items
left behind by dead enemies. Beware that prices of ammo and other
items are HIGHLY DEPENDENT on the tech level of the planets, so
don't be surprised if they turn out to be VERY EXPENSIVE sometimes.
</P>

<P>
Having arrived at Inoid, visit the hospital and talk to the
unfriendly clerk that doesn't want to let you pass. He won't help
you unless you tell him you're 'infected by Hypo Coco'. Then, he
will get Doc Steinhag who will lock you up in a room at the north
side of the hospital. Now you should move to the door to the north
which can be opened either by using a toolbox or by computer
manipulation.
</P>

<P>
The next room contains the heart you were looking for. Snatch
it, go outside and close the door again. Move around in the room a
little and Doc Steinhag will come back and throw the healthy part of
your party out of the building.
</P>

<P>
Back on the 'Whale', you should call the unfriendly voice again.
Now you're asked - in a little more friendly way now - to return to
Lapis to find a hidden mine. You'll get the needed coordinates. To
get there, you'll need a Planet Glider and a Glider Locator.
</P>

<P>
Inside the mine, you'll get to meet the contact man, Jenns
Nippel, in the very southwest corner of the mine. He'll explain
what's about the heart and what he's acting as in the revolution.
If you give the heart to him, you will get another 100000 credits
and a new mission: you're told to escort a freighter to Nedax.
</P>

<P>
After having beamed back to the 'Whale', Commander Tenz, the
freighter's captain, will call you up. On the way to Nedax, you're
attacked by a very powerful troupe of the Federation, which means
you MUST make sure before to be well-armed, otherwise you won't be
able to save the freighter.
</P>

<P>
Commander Tenz is very thankful and asks the crew to visit Kevin
Grove in Aqua (on Nedax, too), who will provide you with essential
information. In Aqua you'll meet Kevin (beard and bald head) who
will tell you about the co-operation between the Pirates' Union and
the Revolution. You're asked to play counsel between Sam van Varn,
the pirates' leader, and Mr. Wostock, a renowned representative of
the Revolution. You're told to meet Sam in Necth, which is another
town on Nedax.
</P>

<P>
Having arrived at Necth, you realize that you're being pursued by
four policemen who mercilessly try to track down your party. After
you've finished with the last one of them, he'll lose a broken
garment and an also broken weapon, which you must pick up. In a bar
in the north of Necth, a barkeeper will tell you about a man having
been in his bar recently who was supposed to be arrested by the
police, but managed to escape anyway.
</P>

<P>
On the table that the barkeeper will show you, you can see an
ashtray which shows a phone number that has been written on the
ashes. Remember this number.
</P>

<P>
Return to the 'Whale' and call this number. You will speak with Sam
Van Varn. He had to escape from the four policemen who were
astonishingly well-informed about the meeting. He can tell you
about the crew because he could see them fight and he had been asked
by Mr. Wostoc to come to the mine on Lapis, where he and the crew
were to meet Jenns Nippel. Unfortunately, he didn't know what Jenns
Nippel looked like, hoping for the team to join him soon.
</P>

<P>
Back to Lapis, you need to make your way to Jenns Nippel's niche.
Here, you're being shocked by an extremely delicate accident. Sam
Van Varn had killed Jenns Nippel because he thought he was a
pursuer! Sam is in obviously nervous shape, and he asks the crew to
keep the accident as a secret, otherwise this would endanger the
unification of the pirates and the Revolution. You should put the
broken garment and the broken weapon next to Jenns's corpse. As Mr.
Wostoc shows up, you must convince him Jenns Nippel had been killed
by the CIA. After successful conversation, both you and Mr. Wostoc
beam up, and tell your crew that they should go back to the 'Whale'.
</P>

<P>
Here, you'll get a call from the Headquarters, where they are
surprised about the crew's success. Before they could kill him,
Greg Morgan managed to transmit important information to the Sky
Boulevard. This data is stored in the station's central computer,
and must be deleted!
</P>

<P>
On the Sky Boulevard, you're getting taken by surprise by an
army of clerks and policemen. At first, you should look for
Ergerson, who can tell you the location of the computer room, but
who expects an automatic rifle from you in return. Giving him the
item he demands from you, Ergerson will tell you that the rooms
you're looking for are located behind those of Mr Wellsgolf,
however, Mr Wellsgolf will only let you pass if he gets a blue paper
from you.
</P>

<P>
Now you must find a station where you can get the paper mentioned.
BUT : to get a blue one, you must get a yellow one first; to get
the latter one, you need a green one, and for the green one, a red
one is required first. You can get the red paper without any
problems. The red paper can be exchanged into a green one, same
with the yellow one you'll get if you give a green one, and finally
you'll hold the blue one in your hands at last.
</P>

<P>
This requires the crew to run across the whole length of Sky
Boulevard. Mr Wellsgolf will accept your blue paper, BUT he demands
another 10000 credits from you if you want him to keep everything as
a secret. Now you can get into the computer complex, which,
however, is heavily protected by a extremely powerful guard.
Talking makes no sense here, so you need to go towards the east, and
go that far so that patrolling guard is out of your view. Here you
should put up a CP4 Trap (you can get these on Castra, for
instance). Now move to the very north of the station, where you can
see a power station. Use a toolbox or computer manipulation to turn
the lights off. It's strongly recommended to have an infrared
device with you, in order not to get lost in the dark, but you can
also do it without it. Oops, the guard seems to have been entirely
trapped, there's only a tiny remainder left from him.
</P>

<P>
Now go inside the computer room and delete ALL data, again by using
either the toolkit or computer manipulation. Then leave AS FAST AS
YOU CAN.
</P>

<P>
Back on the 'Whale', you should call the HQ and they'll glorify you
for all your efforts. But before they can tell you more than the HQ
being on Inoid now, the speaker seems getting killed at this very
instant.
</P>

<P>
On your way to Inoid, you're radioed by a pirate of the union,
who seems to be in lots of trouble. You should destroy ALL Federal
ships. Thankfully that he is, he tells you about Louis 17, a little
asteroid hidden between Nedax and Inoid, and he invites you to come
there.
</P>

<P>
On Inoid, you should visit the HQ, which is in the west, now. Here
you don't find any corpse, though, but anyway you can easily realize
that a fight had happened here and the intermediary seemed to have
been kidnapped.
</P>

<P>
Now it's time to fly to Louis 17. The Orbit merchant will provide
you with some very useful (but anyway very expensive) extras for the
'Whale'. On this planet, you should also visit John Freeze, who can
also sell you good weapons, but the most important thing he has for
you here is a BOMB. This is a MUST to buy because it's essential at
a later stage.
</P>

<P>
On Louis 17, there's not much going on at the moment, because almost
everybody is at a meeting about the Revolution. At the time you
meet Max Schimmel, the pirate, you should try to get everything out
of him about that kidnapped guy. However, he doesn't know any
special things about it, but he mentions that he has got a friend,
Erasmus, who's always well-informed. Erasmus lives in Wocony,
another town on Louis 17, is red-haired and wears black sunglasses.
After Max having given you this precious information, you should
give a little present to him. He will inform you that Erasmus will
only talk with you if you give him a red sardeen.
</P>

<P>
Yeah, you do remember the guy 'Krueger', don't you ? He told you
that he can get everything imaginable. So, why wait any longer?
Head back to Lapis and visit him. IN FACT, he offers you a red
sardeen!
</P>

<P>
Having got the fish, fly back to Wocony and look for Erasmus. After
giving him the sardeen, he's willing to give you everything he
knows; amongst all this, there's an information about the contact
man being held captive on Dymy, a city on Arboris. On Arboris, you
have to find Dymy first, because only Arboris's capital is known to
you so far. You'll find the prison at the utmost south of the city.
Of course, the entrance is locked!
</P>

<P>
But no problem for you, anyway. Place yourself into the niche north
of the entrance and wait a little bit until a guardian opens the
door for a little while, to catch some fresh air. Now the door
isn't locked anymore. Be sure to keep the Sonic Absorber switched
on, otherwise you would have to fight with the whole party of
guardians! Using the Absorber, you can easily kill one guardian
after another.
</P>

<P>
BE VERY CAREFUL with your Plasma Thrower, though, because you could
accidentally kill the prisoner inside his cell !! Inside a little
chamber, you can find a keycard you are able to open all cells with.
One of the cells contains Ems Krull, the intermediary. He tells you
that the Federation lead by General Noth provides a powerful fleet
you CANNOT attack because it's protected by a cloaking device. This
device can be found in another mine on Lapis. You get the
coordinates from him and head to Lapis.
</P>

<P>
Be sure to have VERY GOOD WEAPONS and WELL-EDUCATED CHARACTERS
to be able to defeat the huge army stationed in this mine. Having
either killed or escaped from all soldiers, you must use either the
toolbox or computer manipulation to make the three computers
disfunctional that are controlling the cloaking device. After that,
General Noth will appear, but he's beaming himself away immediately.
</P>

<P>
Back on the 'Whale', you get to know that General Noth has fled
to Sky Boulevard, and that you're supposed to destroy the whole
station in the computer room using a BOMB.
</P>

<P>
On Sky Boulevard, you're getting attacked from every direction. The
beamer will only work directly at the Warp Link. Standing in the
computer room, you need to put down the bomb you bought on Louis 17.
After activating the bomb be sure to escape quickly enough towards
the Warp Link and back to the 'Whale'. (The time remaining is
displayed in a window.)
</P>

<P>
From inside the 'Whale', you can safely watch the explosion of the
Sky Boulevard and the peril of the clerking system of General Noth!
</P>

<P>
Congratulations, you made it!
</P>
