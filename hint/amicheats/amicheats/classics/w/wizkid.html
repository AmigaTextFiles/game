<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
A long, long time ago (1987), Wizball, Wizard, and Nifta the cat
banished Zark from the land of Wiz for being naughty. Nifta had
eight kittens, and Wizard and Wizball got married and had a kid -
Wiz Kid. But Zark came back one night and kidnapped Wizard, Wizball,
and Nifta. He threw Wizard and Wizball into - dungeons and put Nifta
in the turtle jail. Your mission as Wiz Kid is to collect as many
kittens as possible, release Nifta from Chokey, and battle on to
Zark's castle.

<P>
Go to the shop with all five stars and over a hundred pounds, and
buy another star. You'll get an extra hundred pounds. You can
achieve the same by getting the balloon back to the shop and buying
another balloon. This can be done as many times as you want.
</P>

<P>
A secret room on the first section will warp you to any level in
the game. Simply buy the token from the shop and exit as the body.
Now go down the well and enter the Gents toilets. Use the token on
the bubble gum machine and you'll fly up to a secret room with
another Gents toilet door and an exit. Go through the Gents, then
you'll appear in a room with a Ladies and Gents door. Go over to
the right and enter an invisible door (Go to the far right and it
should be found there). Now go through the Gents to the following
patterns to enter the desired section of the game.

<P>
The directions for the various choices are given below. If you
choose the wrong door or wish to return to this screen, go through
the invisible door on the right.

<H2>SOLVE</H2>

<P>
On round 1, collect 150 wizdollars and buy a token from the wizshop.
Exit the shop with wizkid in body mode, raise the bucket in the well
by leaping up and down on the handle, then go down the well and
enter the gent's toilets. Use the token on the condom machine, then
wizkid will be transported to the entrance of the secret cave.
Enter the caves by going through the door on the left and leave by
going through the hidden door on the right, now go back through the
door on the left again and the current room number will be displayed
at the top of the screen.
</P>

<P>
Going through the door on the left will take wizkid to the cave
number which equals the current cave number multiplied by two, and
then added to one. For example, going through the left door in room
6 would take wizkid to room 13. Going through the door on the right
will take wizkid to the cave number which equals the current cave
number multiplied by two, for example, going through the right door
in room 5 will take wizkid to room 10. Going through the hidden
door on the right will take wizkid back to the cave entrance so you
can either go back in or return to the start by going through the
door marked exit. Using these methods you can enter a number of
rooms with loads of features:
