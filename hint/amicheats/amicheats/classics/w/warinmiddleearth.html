<P>
If Gandalf goes to Derdingle, 1,000 huorns will go to Hornburg and
1,000 Ents will go to Isengard. Aragorn can be found at Bree and
Merry can be found at Buckland. Five-hundred trolls can easily
handle everyone from Minas Tirith, Osgiliath and Cair Andros.
</P>

<P>
Items: Never give anyone an item that person already possesses -
they're lost forever. So if you send Faramir to pick up a blue
potion (healing) north of White Towers, he can no longer take the
one in Grey Havens. It takes a bit of careful planning to get all
the right items in the shortest amount of time. Also, give the
right item to the right man and keep in mind that gaining allies
should be given top priority. It's no use fooling around with
healing potions or nice weapons if Dain, Thranduil and other leaders
are immobile because they haven't received their "tokens of war".
</P>

<P>
The sooner you can mobilise your troops the better your chances will
be once Saruman and Sauron start moving out of their own little
backyards (actually, you can beat them to it).
</P>

<P>
Battles: Overkill works. If you attack 2000 Orcs with 2000 cavalry
(cavalry is very effective) you'll probably beat all the Orcs and
lose less than two hundred cavalry. If you attack those same Orcs
with five hundred cavalry chances are you'll lose the battle (and
thus all your cavalry) and never inflict serious losses on your
opponent. One thing: there's a fine balance between the exact
right battleline and needles losses. If you make a stand (say,
defending Minas Tirith) with lots of leaders and a whole range of
different troops - rangers, infantry, light infantry, knights, tower
guards and cavalry - then 250 trolls will inflict losses in all
these categories, thus causing you to lose several hundred troops
each round of combat. If you attack those same 250 trolls with
nothing but (for instance) cavalry there's a good chance you'll come
out with no more than fifty dead, perhaps even none. The two most
valid rules seem to be overkill, and concentration of troop types.
</P>

<P>
When defending Minas Tirith, you'll find that sending all cavalry
(or all Elves, or knights, but not the three combined) to nearby
Osgiliath will work quite nicely. Oh and by the way, I never did
find out (not yet, that is) what the gnarled staff and the coil of
rope are all about!!
</P>

<H2>SOLVE</H2>

<P>
Seeing how The Lord of the Rings is not exactly like any other book
and may indeed be seen by many as the most comprehensive,
extraordinary and brilliant work of fantasy in history some further
infomation may be appreciated. First of all, the guy who did the
game concept (he's just one of the names in the credits but it seems
that's just well- mannered modesty) is Mike Singleton and he's seen
by many as the Numero Uno in wargame simulation; he was doing stuff
like that back in '64. C-64, that is. He's the kind of guy who
makes you wonder how it's possible to get hundreds of different
pictures onto a few disks and still leave enough room for such side
effects as a program.
</P>

<P>
From the first versions of War in Middle Earth on the 8 bit
computers came complaints concerning errors in spelling. As you may
or may not be aware, professor Tolkien's consistency in the
development of Middle Earth resulted in immense background
"research"; not only bloodlines of every important character in the
book but also a coherent set of Elven runes and indeed large parts
of fantasy languages were developed and subsequently integrated into
his work. I can thus imagine how it would irritate the Tolkien
admirer if through sheer neglect a good deal of this Middle Earth
lore were misspelled. I am happy to say that on the ST version
mistakes seem to have been minimised; the only error I've found yet
(but I'm not a fanatic in searching for them) was Forland spelled
Forlond. No big deal even if I do feel that these things should be
done with care.
</P>

<P>
A word about the sort of game we're looking at. War in Middle Earth
is not an adventure; the whole thing is icon-driven and thus mouse
operated. It is also not exactly a wargame: characters are
required to interact with other characters and depending on the
outcome enemy units (Saruman and Sauron and their allies) may take
certain decisions. War in Middle Earth, I dare say, is more than
most adventures, role-playing games or wargames; if I were to give
it a description I would say it's a fairly uncomplicated but
extensive multi-feature fantasy simulation with great detail and
equal success in each aspect. (Attentive readers may correctly
perceive a circumlocution of the more direct phrase "Good stuff - go
and buy").
</P>

<P>
Let's take a look at the forces moving in Middle Earth. In East
Emnet Eomer and a hundred and twenty cavalry make their way to the
north of Dol Goldur, the Sorcerer's Tower of old. In North
Ithilien, Faramir and two hundred rangers trace their steps across
the fields and northern border of the lands of Gondor and head west.
Frodo, with Sam and Pippin following him, makes for Tuckborough,
then goes on to Woodhall, and meets Merry in Buckland. Keeping in
mind Gandalf's warning about the feared Nazgul, the riders in black,
Frodo leads his friends through the old forest and suddenly finds
himself at the house of Tom Bombadil. Tom gives some advice to the
party and, carefully entering the dangerous Barrow Downs, Frodo and
companions head for Bree. In the rest of Middle Earth, forces large
enough to take or lose a city, a region or a whole country slumber;
some gathered in fortresses, others spread out over the countryside.
</P>

<P>
On the side of the good forces, Dain and his thousand Dwarves,
Thranduil and his Sylvan Elves, Denethor in the mighty city of Minas
Tirith, Theoden, Theodred, Bard and many others not yet aware of the
imminent danger keep their watch, semper paratus. And on the side
of the forces of evil, fifteen hundred Orcs are spread over the vast
range of the Misty Mountains, a thousand Orcs guard Dol Goldur,
Saruman's Hand Orcs, Uruk-hai and Dunlendings reside in
once-beautiful Isengard, while only the slightest tip of Sauron's
potential forces - already around thirty thousand Orcs and hundreds
of deadly Trolls - are visible in Morannon, Minas Morgul and also
near Mount Doom and Barad Dur. Invisible the many small but deadly
dark forces that roam the land - Orcs, Trolls, wargs, bandits,
spiders, and, feared beyond all, the ancient Balrogs. And all the
time the nine dreaded Nazgul search the shire for a token of the
ringbearer.
</P>

<P>
Tired, dirty, and, what's much more for a hobbit, hungry up to the
point of starving, Frodo and his friends collapsed on the blanket of
late autumn leaves spread out over the withered grass. "We made
it!" Too much out of breath to answer Pippin's exclamation, Sam sat
down on the field, legs crossed. After a few minutes, he looked at
Frodo and said, "Well, maybe all this running around in dead
people's places is all right for the three of you, but I've had
enough of adventures already. There's nothing I fancy more than a
good hot meal and a seat in front of a fire." Frodo looked at his
friend with sympathy. "Well, Sam Gamgee, only the day before
yesterday we escaped those fearful black riders, and now we have
actually killed a wight in the Barrow Downs, and what's more we've
met Tom Bombadil himself, and all you do is complain." Sam's face
slowly showed a pained, guilty expression, though his love for food
and fire were still apparent. "And what's more," said Pippin in a
surprisingly enthusiastic voice, "we've heard magnificent stories.
And we've found a lot of nice things; right now we each have our own
Elven blade. Not to forget the wonderful magic potions we're
carrying." "And a fine staff, even if we don't know what it's good
for," concluded Merry. "Well that's all very well but I'd easily
trade both staff and potions for a strong draught of ale and a full
plate of hot food, thank you very much." "Maybe tonight," sighed
Frodo, "when we reach Bree."
</P>

<P>
That night in Bree the ranger Aragorn met the party and, knowing it
was far from safe to stay in any one place for a longer period of
time, the five of them immediately left for Midgewater Marsh. All
the time gathering information on the whereabouts, movement and
destinations of the nine dark riders, Aragorn tried to keep away as
much as he could from the road that connected Bree to The Last
Bridge and, beyond that, to Ford of Bruinen and finally to fabled
Rivendell - their initial destination. The party slept near
Weathertop but once they found out that the Nazgul frequented the
place on their search they decided to leave it alone and travel
through the open land. When they came near the last bridge,
observation taught them that all black riders moved toward the Ford
of Bruinen - so they waited until the last of the black riders, the
mighty Nazgul Lord himself, had left in that direction and then they
immediately followed.
</P>

<P>
Near the last bridge they came in a fight with five wargs but
Aragorn's ancient sword cut right through the first four vicious
wolves while Pippin killed the last one with his Elven blade. Only
Sam was slightly wounded in the fight. Then, on the road through
the forest, the company met Glorfindel and under his elven guidance
they evaded both wolves and Trolls on the forest road when finally,
emerging from the treeline and almost in sight of Rivendell, the
company passed the great river near Ford of Bruinen and was suddenly
attacked by all the nine Nazgul at once. If it hadn't been for the
help of Elrond, things would have been for the worst. But as it
was, one mighty attack after another, initiated time and again by
valiant charges from Elrond and Aragorn, felled each foul Nazgul in
turn until none of the wretched creatures were left.
</P>

<P>
And the party reached Rivendell to rest and recuperate from their
wounds and to hold council in the presence of Elrond and Gandalf.
In the meantime, Eomer had quietly crossed the plains of the Brown
Lands, the small bands of marauding bandits evading the larger force
of his horsemen, and had picked up the long lost ring of Thrain
north of Dol Goldur, the former Sorcerer's Tower on the edge of
Mirkwood. He was now in possession of the ring but, before
returning it to their rightful owners, decided to make a double
bargain when he learned that in a ruin near Mount Gundabad a
treasure could be found that belonged to Thranduil's Sylvan elves.
Eomer and his cavalry rode north. Faramir, having crossed Cair
Andros and passing through Edoras, Hornburg and Isen Ford, headed
further west in search of more recent treasure.
</P>

<P>
In Rivendell, the party met Bilbo, the initial ringbearer, and
listened to the old Hobbit's advice. It was a sentimental meeting
amongst the hobbits and even the most mischievous Elf seemed to
sense that theirs was a grave and sad parting. For Frodo, there was
mithril mail as a present from Bilbo and long farewells from all
others as the Fellowship prepared to move on. Frodo had been
appointed ringbearer and it was now his duty to try and destroy the
cursed One Ring by bringing it to age-old Mount Doom in the middle
of bare and sinister Mordor itself and there unmake it in the only
possible way. He was to be assisted by Sam, Pippin, Merry and
Aragorn as before, but now Legolas, Gimli and Boromir had joined the
party, and they would all travel under the capable guidance of
Gandalf the Grey. And Gandalf knew, like he had known for a long
time, that now was the time for his final work in the greatest
confrontation between good and evil in the worlds of Middle Earth.
</P>

<P>
Having learned of important treasures throughout the land and
realising full well that the temporary incapacitation of the Nazgul
offered a certain degree of safety, Gandalf decided it practical to
split the company in two and gather some of the items that would
increase the chance of success of their newborn quest. Aragorn and
Legolas would, with all possible speed, search for various valuable
items in or near Belegost, Forland, Grey Havens and White Towers
while Gandalf and the others obtained tokens of power near Mount
Gram and Annuminas. Then they would meet each other in Ost-in-Edhil
and continue their journey.
</P>

<P>
And so it happened, and while Eomer brought the heirlooms of the
Elves and Dwarves to their respective owners and thus gained their
assistance in the final battles, Faramir and his rangers searched
for healing in a small town near the mouths of the rivers Greyflood
and Isen and continued on to rendez-vous with Gandalf, Aragorn and
the others near Ost-in-Edhil where - so they had learned from Cirdan
- an ancient blade had been washed ashore. "Gandalf?" "Yes,
Aragorn, I know. We must decide on which way to pass the
mountains." "Why not south?" asked the seasoned ranger. Gandalf
slowly shook his head. "Because of Saruman. He has been perverted
by Sauron and wants the ring for himself. We cannot risk it. We
must cross these mountains." Aragorn did not argue. "Where? The
passes are probably snowed in." "I know. We shall try to enter
Moria through Hollin Gate."
</P>

<P>
Once more Aragorn said nothing, but his mien clearly reflected his
worry. No sane man could hope to enter Moria and leave the place
unscathed. But then Gandalf was no ordinary man. When they had
travelled across the fields for several days (not completely alone
as Gandalf had picked up signs of Gollum following the party) they
arrived at Hollin Gate. Gandalf spoke the ancient elven words and
opened the passage through the mountains, but immediately the party
was challenged by a fierce creature that seemed to consist mainly of
flames. An ancient Balrog attacked them, and Gandalf instructed his
friends to leave him and continue their quest. In the ensuing
fight, the Balrog was hurt badly, and Gandalf was struck a mortal
wound.
</P>

<P>
The individual members of the company tried to get together and
enter Moria as fast as possible, but Gimli, Legolas and Aragorn were
separated from the others by the presence of the burning creature
following them. Although Sauron's servant was badly hurt, they were
still no match for the ancient evil - at least, that is what Aragorn
judged. After two hours of pursuit, Gimli suddenly turned around,
charged across a small glade and attacked the Balrog with his
hammer. By the time Aragorn and Legolas were aware of the assault,
the fight was over.
</P>

<P>
Gimli sat, totally unhurt, with before his feet nothing but a black,
burnt patch of grass where the Balrog had been dealt the mortal
blow. Half stunned, all Gimli could say was "And that's for
Gandalf." Aragorn just stood there, too tired and too awed to speak.
Legolas seemed unmoved, but the inflection in his voice betrayed
both the sadness for Gandalf's defeat as well as admiration for
Gimli's heroic revenge. "My dwarven friend, you have great valor.
If we could all match you the dark lord would never stand a chance."
Legolas paused. "But now we must leave; there is no more time."
"And we must go south," whispered Aragorn, "for now I must bring the
Red Arrow to Edoras as fast as I can. And we must hope that our
friends will survive Moria."
</P>

<P>
Faramir and his rangers were the last to enter the tunnel, just
before the age-old doors swung shut again. By the light of torches,
the company - Boromir leading the hobbits and rangers - slowly moved
through the stone dungeons. Much further north, Dain (who had found
the old dwarven hammer north of Erebor) and a thousand Dwarves were
on their way to Mt. Gundabad to destroy the Orcs there. More to
the south, Eomer, Thranduil and many Elves were going to Goblin town
to do the same. With the consent of his allies, Eomer meant to deal
out a death blow to all the enemies inhabiting the Misty Mountains,
thus ridding this part of Middle Earth of Sauron's troops. And
after the Misty Mountains, he intended to seek out the enemy in old
Dol Goldur.
</P>

<P>
Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas passed through the gap of Rohan south of
Isengard and continued on toward Edoras where they hoped to meet
Theoden. Boromir, the hobbits and Faramir with his rangers were
totally outnumbered by the five hundred Orcs at Dol Amroth, but with
a great charge they managed to decimate their opponents before the
final attacks started. Faramir was slightly wounded, several dozen
rangers lay dead on the rocks, Boromir was severely hurt, but all
the orcs were killed. The party continued on, left Moria and
started toward Lothlorien. Dain's company reached Mt. Gundabad and
ran the Orcs over in a single charge, not one Dwarf was killed.
Eomer and Thranduil's company attacked the Goblin town but the enemy
was dug in and had to be searched out; several dozen Elves and nine
cavalry died in the progress of annihilating the last of Sauron's
servants in the Misty Mountain range. Both Dain and Eomer started
their journey towards Lorien.
</P>

<P>
The first to reach Lorien was none other than Gandalf'; not killed
by his opponent's foul blow but rather transformed into a more pure
and strong form. Now, Gandalf the Grey had become Gandalf' the
White. And after speaking to the lady Galadriel, Gandalf' left for
Edoras. Boromir's company reached Lorien and was also welcomed by
the beautiful Elf queen, and Frodo received gifts from the lady of
light. Faramir and his rangers decided to stay in Lorien and help
defend the fabled city should the need arise. Boromir, Frodo, Sam,
Pippin and Meriadoc left for Minas Tirith. Aragorn and company had
reached Edoras, and when the Red Arrow was presented to Theoden King
the latter gave orders to rally all cavalry in his lands and
promised Aragorn that Saruman would soon pay for his betrayal.
</P>

<P>
And Aragorn went to Minas Tirith to offer the Sceptre, token of the
power of the King of Numenor, to Denethor in order to mobilise as
soon as possible the complete strength of Gondor. The battle for
Isengard was short; forewarned as Theoden was his thousands of
cavalry took the initiative and attacked, rather than awaiting a
certain siege and offensive in Hornburg. Theoden King led the
troops that simply ran over Saruman's Hand Orcs, Uruk-Hai and
Dunlendings. Although Saruman had more forces than the initial few
thousand, they were dealt with easily.
</P>

<P>
Soon Orthanc was empty, save for some royal infantry left behind to
guard the white tower. And Theoden and the hordes of Rohan moved
off toward Minas Tirith to assist Aragorn, Gandalf and all the
others in the decisive battles. Crossing the lands where small
bands of Orcs, Goblins and bandits were searching for the
ring-bearer, Boromir led the hobbits (and Gollem who had persuaded
Frodo to be allowed to join the company) south. But soon, in a
desperate fight and chase, Pippin and Merry were cut off from the
others. Boromir, Frodo, Sam and Gollum killed all twenty Orcs but
Boromir was again wounded.
</P>

<P>
They did not find Merry or Pippin again and had no choice but to
continue south, towards Minas Tirith. Already, Frodo could feel the
increasing weight of the ring bearing down upon him. Pippin and
Merry got lost in the ancient woods of Fangorn and there they met
one of the oldest inhabitants of Middle Earth, Treebeard. They
looked at him in awe and listened carefully to his slow dark voice
giving them advise on their journey. The next day, they travelled
further south and met the entire company of Theoden. And Dain,
Thranduil, Faramir and Eomer greeted each other in Lothlorien and
readied themselves to overthrow the Orcs in Dol Goldur.
</P>

<P>
Already, troops were gathering in Minas Tirith. Aragorn had offered
the Sceptre to Denethor and what Gandalf had not been able to
achieve the old token of war now did for him; they received the
reluctant help of the stewart. Now all troops gathered under the
leadership of Gandalf the White behind the time-worn but still
mighty battlements of the walls of Minas Tirith. Denethor was
there, with his infantry, his light infantry and the elite tower
guards. Imrahil was coming forth from Dol Amroth with his company
of valiant knights. Hirluin, Dervorin and other leaders travelled
the lands of Gondor to assist in the final battles.
</P>

<P>
Pippin and Merry accompanied Theoden, Theodred, Erkenbrand,
Dernhelm, Elfhelm and some seven thousand cavalry on their way to
venerable Minas Tirith. Boromir had been left by Frodo, Sam and
Gollum because Frodo knew that not the fabled city but threatening
Mount Doom was his ultimate destination. Boromir now went back to
his father, Denethor steward of Gondor. Helped by Celeborn himself,
Eomer, Faramir, Thranduil, Dain and all their cavalry, rangers,
Elves and Dwarves crushed the orcs in Dol Goldur and travelled
southeast to reach Minas Tirith in time. And then, as an expected
but not less feared, sudden and awesome sign, as if their leader had
smelled the impending danger on a whiff of the western winds,
Sauron's troops began to move at last. And all over Mordor rose
immense clouds of dust that hid yet betrayed the presence of
thousands and thousands of Orcs, Goblins, Trolls and Half-Trolls,
wainriders, Balchoth, corsairs, Westrons, Easterlings, the Harad and
the Umbar, Morgoth and Shelob. And Sauron. "And I say no hobbit in
his right wits would even think of crossing those mountains.
</P>

<P>
Look at that colour; it's just not natural," Sam complained when he
established that Frodo was actually going to travel on into
murderous Mordor itself. "Well, you can see why they're called the
ash mountains, Sam. And I still say we have to go. I can't hold on
much longer, it's becoming too heavy now." "I...I could try to..."
Sam stammered as he saw Frodo's cold eyes guessing his intent,
seeing things much darker than Sam Gamgee could possibly ever even
grasp. "NO! No one takes the ring from me!" "Smeagol take ring?
Smeagol take precious to safety, yes, not to nasty hot mountain or
evil land of Mordor. Smeagol take ring now?" "I say no! If I have
to take it, I take it myself."
</P>

<P>
Slowly, with the pleading but cunning glances from Gollum and the
worried eyes of Sam studying him, Frodo relaxed. "I'm sorry, Sam.
It's just..." "I know." He took up his pack and tried to sound
cheerful. "Well, if we're going to pass through, we might as well
do it before some patrol finds us." And the three of them went
through the old, old tracks near Cirith Ungol and tried to evade the
countless Orcs literally pouring from the mountains. The siege of
Minas Tirith was a fact. But rather than follow Denethor's
suggestion of staying safely behind the wall, knowing that each
attack would cause unnecessary losses, Gandalf and Aragorn planned a
more offensive strategy.
</P>

<P>
Within the walls of nearby Osgiliath, all the cavalry held its base
for sudden charges. Apart from them, large troups of Elves and
Dwarves took short trips into the surrounding land to find and take
by surprise the many isolated troups of Orcs and other evil allies
that had not yet reached Minas Tirith. In the magnificent city
itself, Gandalf resisted one assault after another, killing Orcs and
Trolls until the fields were black with their blood, leading Imrahil
and his knights into charge after frantic charge, assisted by the
infantry and the tower guards. Among the forces of good, many died,
and even more were wounded. But while the greatest strength of
Mordor relentlessly pushed through the plains and gathered outside
Minas Tirith, the Dwarves and Elves returned, both strongly
reinforced by their comrades coming down from Dol Goldur and from
further up north, and finally Erkenbrand and all cavalry returned to
Minas Tirith to take the last stand.
</P>

<P>
And when all the remaining cavalry and infantry had barricaded
themselves within the strength of the fortress, even the full power
of Sauron could not break them and all attempts to breach the walls
were futile. Then, when all the fields in front of Minas Tirith
were littered with the rotting bodies of their precious friends and
their foul opponents, Gandalf, bitter for so much bloodshed but
determined to finish the war forever, ordered all troops on a forced
march to Mordor. While Gollum, Sam and Frodo made slow and tedious
progress through the wastes of Mordor, already in sight of Mount
Doom, the Dark Lord turned his attention to his last hope - the One
Ring.
</P>

<P>
But just as he started to feel that he might have been tricked
within his very own land, his mind was absorbed by the turning tide
at the gates of Morannon. There, his good counterpart led a large
force of all his ancient enemies - Dwarves, Elves, rangers and
uncorrupted humans - against his personal guard. And the forces of
good passed into the burned wastes of Mordor. When Gandalf and
Sauron came eye to eye in the dark tower of Barad Dur, all those
below, both the forces of good as well as the servants of evil,
heard a thundering crack, and as the maker of the One Ring realised
that his utter defeat was guaranteed by Frodo's fullfillment of the
quest, he led out a great howl of anguish. Now, the defeat of
Sauron was a fact. SO ENDS THE WAR IN MIDDLE EARTH.
