<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
The very first time you attack the berserker, hit him with
everything you have, including the MDC. He will then keep following
you. When Solbase says to take him anywhere, go to CH010 and he
will get sucked into a black hole.

<P>
To evade missiles, your best bet is to fly away backwards in front
of them at a range of about 3000 m.
