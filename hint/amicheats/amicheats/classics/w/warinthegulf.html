<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
War in the Gulf pits a crack unit of M1 tanks against the invading
Iraqi forces in northern Kuwait. Utilising the same technology as
Team Yankee, War in the Gulf is a game of immense tension and hectic
action set against a backdrop of hundreds of burning oil wells in
the oilfields near the Kuwaiti border.
