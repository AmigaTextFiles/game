<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Puts players into the subconscious mind of a hospital patient as he
undergoes surgery. Here the player encounters giant wasps,
carnivorous rose bushes, a psychopathic lawn mower and a little girl
who is not all sugar and spice. In confronting the many unusual
challenges in Weird Dreams directly affects the patient's health on
the operating table. Anyone claiming to have figured at all out will
need more psychiatric help than the designers of the game.
