<P>
Find the key under the lid. To get the book, insert, push, and
remove the key.

<P>
To find the flask, go to the weed, then go north, west, then south.
When you get the flask, fill it by the stream.
</P>

<P>
To get out of the ungetoutable room, do this: open the chest, get
the garment, remove the doublet, burn it, wear the garment, examine
your hands, wash them, look in the mirror and wash your face.
</P>

<P>
You can avoid killing the traveller on the bridge by looking at the
water and closing your eyes.
</P>

<P>
In the caves, throw the flint to get past the skeleton. When you
see the hunters by the fire, look around, climb the tree, look
around again, then drop the touch powder on the fire.
