<H2>CHEATS</H2>

<P>
Here is a handy cheat for jumping through the missions. When you
take off from the Claw speed up until you reach around 400kps and
then wait a few seconds. Now turn around and head straight for the
Claw with your after- burners on. Eject just before your ship
disintegrates and voila! - you'll be ready to start your next
mission.

<P>
Launch WING COMMANDER in the following manner. From cli cd to the
directory where WC is installed or DF0: if playing from floppy.
Now type "Wing h0 Origin&tonic" and press 'RETURN'. Make sure you
type it exactly as shown. Now during play hold down 'SHIFT' and
press 'F5' to destroy any targeted target.
