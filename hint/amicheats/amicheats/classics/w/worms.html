<H2>CHEATS</H2>

<P>
On the title screen, Type in "TOTAL WORMAGE" for SHEEP MODE. If you
are using a joypad press GREEN, UP, PAUSE, PAUSE, YELLOW (which
spells GUPPY - a tribute to the late Bananafish). This gives you 3
sheep, 1 banana bomb and a minigun straight away (go into Weapon
Options if you need an UNLIMITED SUPPLY of sheep)
</P>

<P>
The "legendary prod move" is a not available in any shops. To
activate get next to your victim and press AWAY, AWAY, TOWARDS,
TOWARDS (in other words, if your worm is facing right press left,
left, right, right)
</P>

<H3>SECRET MOVE</H3>

<P>
Stand next to a worm (not your own) and then press away, away,
towards, towards then do a prod and you get a secret move.
</P>

<H3>TWO VS TWO MODE</H3>

<P>
Select your four players, then select two of them again (They get
circles instead of stars) you are now ready to play team worms.
</P>

<H2>CUSTOM LEVEL OPTIONS</H2>

<P>
The custom level option is EVEN MORE EXCITING than you thought. You
can set the gravity, friction, sky and water colours for your
levels. Instead of saving your level as FISHCAKE.WRM, save it as
FISHCAKE.????.WRM (the 4 question marks being 4 numbers).
</P>

<UL>
<LI>The first number is gravity and can be between 1 and 5 (1=very low,
3=normal 5=very high). Mars and alien levels have a gravity of 2.
<LI>The second number is friction and can be between 1 and 5 (1=very
low, 3=normal, 5=very high). Arctic and alien levels have a
friction of 2.
<LI>The third and forth numbers are the sky and water colours and can
be between and 9 - fans of green water can now have a matching green
sky.
</UL>

<P>
You can also make your own message appear, when your level is
chosen, by giving your level file a comment. You can do this from
Workbench by clicking on your level files icon and choosing
"Information" from the Workbench menus. Then just type your message
into the "comment" field and click save.
