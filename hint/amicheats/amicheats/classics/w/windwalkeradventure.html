<H2>TIPS</H2>

<H3>SECTION 1: Getting Started</H3>

<P>
The first thing you should do in windwalker is training, get
yourself familiar with the various moves [especially the ranges and
recover time (ie. time to recover from the attack movement) of all
the attack forms that you have] and the enemies of course.
</P>

<P>
After "vigorous" training, you can venture forth into the "Real
World", the first thing you should do is to find some thiefs or
assasin and kill them for money and food. Use the money to buy
incense, food (if necessary). Then go to the shrine to the north
of the village (1st village) and talk to the monk about incense, he
will blessed your incense. Then read the scroll in the holy shrine.
This scroll will tell you how to use the incense.
</P>

<P>
When you burn the incense, you will be prompted for the "prayer" to
chant these prayers are recorded in the scroll in the shrine.
</P>

<P>
They are: Heal my Body, Restore my Honor, Empower my spirit,
Exorcise (fireball) their function are self explanatory, and they
required blessed incense.
</P>

<P>
If you are having trouble beating up the thief and assasin, here is
an easy way to "go about it". First, when you see an enemy and then
save the game, after you engage him, and the combat isn't going your
way, press 'q' and run away. This will get you back to the
"overhead" screen. Choose recall game and do the fight again until
you win.
</P>

<P>
You will see a blind man in front of the store, give him the money
he asked you and ask him about his shoe, buy this shoe, it will come
in use later.
</P>

<H3>SECTION 2</H3>

<P>
Get a boat near the shore and sail east of the holy shrine (1st
shrine) until you find the island with a house on it, this is the
explorer's house. Go inside and get the map in the cabinet, this is
the best map available in the game. (you will also find a scroll that
is a clue to solve the game but it's not important because you have
me). After that go to the monastary(mark as a walled circular
building in the explorer map). Speak to the older monk inside, he
will ask you if you want to join their brotherhood. You will of
course join them (because they will give you the Staff and Robe).
</P>

<P>
In order to join the monks, you 'll have to follow the way of life
for one day and observer the vow of silence. This mean following the
older monk the whole day. After that you are tested in combat
against yourself, if you win, you will get the staff and robe
</P>

<P>
There are scrolls on the second story of the monastary, the one
about Nubia is essential in winning the game. But read them all
anyway.
</P>

<P>
If you happen to see another boat in the sea hail it. If it is the
fisherman, ask him about buying supplies and buy 4 striped turtle
shells. (the shell is about 10 bucks each)
</P>

<P>
If you happen to pass an island where the Heron bird is resting
(standing) on, disembark and run into the Heron, this will gives you
some heron feathers.
</P>

<H3>SECTION 3: Getting Magical Talisman</H3>

<P>
There are four magical talisman in this game, each one requires a
special item and a striped turtle shell for the Shaman (living in a
cave on the Northwest corner of the Isle of Dead. [approach the
island from the northwest corner]) to make. Here are the list and
where to find them:
</P>

<P>
Talisman - Items required - Comments 
</P>

<P>
Invisibility - Blind man's shoe - Buy it from the blind man. Mantra
is: unseen presence<BR>
WaterWalk - water beetle manibles - While invisible attack a Water
beetle The beetles can be found in water in the Isle of Dead or a
cavern Northeast of the Imperial Palace. Mantra is: the solid path
<BR>
Invulenbility - Sea dragon's scale - While invisible and water
walking, at- tack a sea dragon. The dragons can be found in the
water of the Isle of Dead Mantra is: the armored one<BR>
Levitation - Heron's feather - Heron's feather. Mantra is: on the
wing
</P>

<P>
After obtaining the require item and a striped turtle, go to the
shaman and ask him about "things" and then the name of the talisman.
</P>

<P>
While on the Isle of Dead, and it happens to be full moon, go to the
cavern which is just southwest of the Shaman's cave where the tree
of Immortality grows, there the normal Panda guarding the tree will
reveal his true form as the God of Luck, he will give you the peach
seed that is required to win the game.
</P>

<P>
After you get the Invulenbility talisman, you have pretty much
finished the game, because when you use it, you won't take damage
from any combat and the talisman only drain your spirit at a slow
rate and the money from the defeated foes can be use to purchase
incense by the truck load and replenish your loss spirit. You can
literally start a massacre of the Warlord's allies.
</P>

<H3>SECTION 4: KILLING Enemies</H3>

<P>
Once you have the invulenbility talisman, walk into the palace with
your monk robe on. Go to the building in the back. March up (kill
any foolish guards who happened to be in your way (or maybe you just
hate his face)) the stairs and meet the warlord. With the talisman,
this should be no problem.
</P>

<P>
On any night of a new moon (preferably the 1st night), go inside
the palace (this can be done before obtaining the talisman but you
should had the monk robe on to pass through the guards at the front
door, unless you go inside the palace from the secret entrance from
the cave where the water beetles are), go to the building in the
lower right corner. Copy the scroll on the table and go upstairs to
the astral gate (you 'll see the alchemist waiting outside the gate
doing absolutely nothing.) wait until it is midnight (you can
actually sleep there), when the alchemist go in the astral gate,
cast an "exorcise" (fireball) at the gate. (this will sealed up the
gate and trap the alchemist within. After that you will have to go
back to the two shrines and save it from the spirit the Alchemist
brought from the Astral Plane. All you have to do is cast an
"exorcise" (fireball) at the pocessed priest (monk) in the shrine
</P>

<P>
Be careful while casting the exorcise, it takes a lot of spirit. You
need a full spirit to cast it.
</P>

<H3>SECTION 5: Saveing The Emperor</H3>

<P>
Assuming you have kicked the Warlord and the Alchemist, you 'll have
to save the Empreror who is now imprisoned and drugged. You 'll have
to make an antidote to free the emperor from the "Fu Ma Ren" drug.
You 'll have to get a copy of the Alchemist scroll to the medicine
man in the SW corner of the realm and he will informed you that he
has no knowledge of making the antidote and refer you to the 2nd
medicine man hiding in the cave just NE of the Imperial Palace and
give you a letter of introduction. Go to this 2nd medicine man and
he 'll give you a key (which open the cabinet in his house) and ask
you to fetch a copy of the scroll found in the cabinet. This scroll
will tell you the 5 ingredients needed for the antidote. They are:
</P>

<P>
Rhino horn - in the Warlord's cabinet in his room (get the keys
from the concubines)<BR>
Jasimine flower - From the Nubian Princess living in the bottom left
corner of the Warlord's house (back building in the Palace) The
Princess doesn't speak English, so when you are talking to her,
first say "Salah" (hello), then "dohnteh" (tea) and then
"pluumfir" (flower the Jasmine flower)<BR>
Seed from the tree of Immortality - from The Isle of Death (see
above)<BR>
Gold - given by the explorer when you go to rescue him in the
Thief's hideout<BR>
Jade - found underneath the throne in the throne room (central
building in palace)
</P>

<P>
Once you have all five of these ingredients, go back to the cave
with a copy of the scroll from the 2nd medicine man's cabinet. The
second medicine man will then leave the cave and go back to his
house to make the antidote, follow him to his place and wait until
he is finished to the Antidote. Once you have the antidote, go to
the jail (SW corner of Palace, and use invisibility to avoid the
Jailer). Go to the 3rd cell ( counting from left to right ) and
open the door with the key the Warlord had dropped when he fled.
There you will see the emperor and once you give him the antidote
and he 'll recover and Moebiuse will elevate you to the level of
"Windwalker" and End game
