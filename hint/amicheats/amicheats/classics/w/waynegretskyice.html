<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
This riveting simulation is packed with all the strategy,
excitement, and hard-hitting action we could squeeze into an Amiga.
Actual digitized fight videos drop you right where the playing gets
rough! Fully animated players, digitized stereo effects right from
the rink, extensive player stats, variable speed instant replay lets
you review the action in forward or reverse.
</P>

<H2>CHEATS</H2>

<P>
While you are playing the game and powering up the rink towards the
oppoment's goal with the puck in your possension, press the '?' key
to remove your opponent's goalie from his goal area. He'll reappear
in a forward position so you'll be out numbered, but it is better to
have an open goal.
