<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
You're a hard-boiled detective in 1938 L.A. Find the real culprit of
a murder case or face suspicion yourself.
</P>

<H2>SOLVE</H2>

<P>
This walkthru will help you to finish "Witness". Okay, you start
South of the house, where you just picked up a matchbook. Go North
twice to the front door and ring the bell. Phong will let you in.
</P>

<P>
Then just try to go East, and Phong will lead you to the Living
Room, where Monica and Mr. Linder are. Now, wait (get used to
doing that, because there's a lot of waiting in this one), and
Linder will eventually take you to his office. Sit down in the
wooden chair, and Linder will hand you a note. Read it, as it will
help waste some time. Now, just do anything (but stay seated!) to
make time pass. Show the matchbook to Linder for an interesting
reaction, if you like. In any case, you just have to keep waiting.
</P>

<P>
Eventually, Monica will come in briefly to announce she's going to
the movies. This is not what you're waiting for, however! So, keep
on waiting, and finally, the murder will occur. Linder will be shot
while you sit there, and you can't stop it from happening. Read the
description carefully at the moment the shot is fired. There's
something odd about it. In fact, the whole thing is a setup.
</P>

<P>
The first thing to do is stand up, then push the button. Instead of
ringing to summon the butler, it causes a strange click to be heard
from the clock. At this point, Phong will enter the room. Tell him
you want the keys, and he'll hand them over to you. Now, examine
the clock. Keyhole seems a little strange, doesn't it? The
doorbell rings while you're doing this, so as Phong goes to answer
the door, examine the keyhole.
</P>

<P>
I'll bet you're getting some ideas already! However, you'll need to
have the powder analyzed, and Duffy hasn't arrived yet, so wait
around until he does. Then get the powder analzyed (you can ignore
Stiles, he's only a red herring). While that's being done, examine
the window (you can't open the clock yet, it's the one key you don't
have). The green wire seems suspicious, so get it for future
reference.
</P>

<P>
Now, go West into the Hallway, then North twice, and open the
Butler's door. Go West into the room, and read the mystery book (by
the way, you can drop the telegram and note, they aren't important).
A gun receipt is used as a bookmark. The purchaser's name is
obviously phoney, but hang on to the receipt anyway. Okay, from the
Butler's Room, go East twice to Monica's room, then unlock and open
the back door. Go East into the Backyard, then South twice to the
office path.
</P>

<P>
Aha, a muddy gun! No fingerprints, alas, but you might want to take
it along with you, just in case. Now, go West into the Side Yard.
Hmm, more footprints here, but they aren't quite the same as the
ones on the office path. In fact, it looks like someone was
standing here for awhile. Wonder who it might have been? (No,
*not* Sergeant Duffy!). Anyway, go West again to the driveway, then
North and East into the Garage. Unlock and open both the garage
door and the workshop door, then go East into the Workshop.
</P>

<P>
The place looks like an electrician's paradise, and there isn't much
you can do here; but, there are spools of wire hanging around.
Could it be...? Examine spool, and you have established a link of
sorts between this place and the study. The green wire is obviously
from this room. Now, all you need is the person who put it there.
</P>

<P>
You now stand there waiting for Monica. Just keep waiting; she'll
arrive (saying "Wait for Monica" is easiest. It will take a while,
so if you want to hunt down Phong and ask him about the gun receipt,
you have time). When she does get there, she'll fiddle briefly with
the junction box (very suspicious!) before noticing you. Now, wait
until she leaves, then follow her. You *must* use directions here,
just saying "Follow Monica" won't work. Follow her all the way to
her room, and wait for her to come back out of the bathroom. When
she returns, ask her about Mr. Linder.
</P>

<P>
Her response will establish the motive. Now, wait some more, and
she will eventually leave the room. Follow her again, this time to
the office. As soon as you get in there, handcuff her. Somewhere
along the way, Sgt. Duffy will have left with the body, so you
can't arrest her until he comes back. In the meantime, you have to
find some very important evidence. So, first search Monica for the
key. When you get it, unlock the clock and open it. She's already
removed the gun, but you can search her for that, also.
</P>

<P>
Now, just wait until Duffy returns, and arrest her for the murder.
And that should be about it. By the way, if you try leaving her and
waiting in the office (so you can find the gun in the clock), you'll
find that, however hard you try, you won't be able to handcuff her
(which is necessary so she can be searched). So, you'll just have
to wait and follow her. As I said in the beginning, it's a pretty
simple game.
