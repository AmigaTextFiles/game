<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Keef the Thief is a unique role playing experience that mixes humor
with action in an adventure that includes dramatic combat,
multi-level spells, and puzzles to solve at every step. And your
goal is a simple one: become the absolute ruler of everything and
everyone! In Keef the Thief, your're young Keef, a juvenile
delinquent out on your own for the first time. You're faced with
survival in the Tri-City Area; a vermin-infested continent tangled
with thick, steamy jungles. If things aren't bad enough, rumor has
it that a supremely evil magician is trying to create the magic
necessary to rule the continent. Since you have delusions of
grandeur, you set out to beat him to it. Amusing narratives accompany
you as you explore the more then 25 complete levels, which are
inhabited by over 200 species of drooling monsters that think that
thief meat is sweet.

For something interesting in this game go up into the tree houses
near the left side of the map. When you see a commercial like
screen with a woman in it make this spell: RHINO HORN, BLACK PEARL,
NARCICUS ROOT.
