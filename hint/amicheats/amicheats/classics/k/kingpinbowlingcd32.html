<H2>TIPS</H2>

<H3>LANE CONDITIONS</H3>

<P>
One of the first things to note when you start the game is the lane
conditions. Before you start to bowl you'll be told how the lane is
playing and the effect it will have. Amateurs will flick past this
without a second thought, but it's important to take note of these,
as it will have quite an effect on how you play.
</P>

<P>
The lanes can alter the performance of the ball quite radically.
Some, for instance, may swing the ball to the right, others to the
left and if you're really lucky, it might play straight. The lane
report will tell you which direction it is moving the ball, but it
doesn't tell you how much. On your first couple of goes note how
much the ball is veering off course and alter things accordingly.
To compensate any movement the lane might be causing you can either
change your aim, or add a bit of after spin to the ball.
</P>

<P>
Another point listed in the lane report is how heavily or lightly
waxed the lane is. If there's a lot of wax on the surface, then the
ball will not spin so much. If there's hardly any wax the ball will
obviously spin quite a lot. The important thing to remember though,
is that the amount of wax changes as the game progresses. As more
and more balls are hurtled down the alley, the wax wears off,
meaning the ball will spin more and more the further you get into a
game.
</P>

<H3>TYPES OF BALLS</H3>

<P>
The bowling balls are different colours. The colours represent the
weight. Each weight performs in different ways, some spin well,
others are fast, and some are just so heavy they bulldoze through
all the pins.
</P>

<P>
To give you a rough idea of which ball does what, here's a little
list;
</P>

<UL>
<LI>Orange, 8lb, good for spinning and good speed, but easily
deflected. Best for those tricky splits and when you're after only
one pin.
<LI>Green, 10lb, good for spinning, average speed and average
deflection. Good for little clumps of pins.
<LI>Blue, 12lb, average speed, just above average spin and not
easily deflected. Good for all round use.
<LI>Purple, 14lb, a bit sluggish speedwise and bad for spinning, but
can blaze a path through most pins. Good for blasting away clumps
of pins, or on your first throw.
<LI>Grey, 16lb, the big `un, slow and bad for spinning, but once
this one gets rolling, nothing's going to stop it.
</UL>

<P>
As with real bowling, the game is all about using each one at the
appropriate time and also finding out which is most suitable to you.
</P>

<P>
If you're aim is bad, you may want to choose a light ball, so if you
send it off in direction of the gutter you can put on some spin and
turn it into a good shot. If your aim is okay, there's no reason
why especially on the first throw, you can't pick the big `un and
blast as many pins away as possible.
</P>

<P>
Learning how to use deflection is also imortant, especially for
split pins. Generally, if the ball is deflected off course by a pin
it's bad news, but sometimes you may want the ball to deflect so
that you can hit another pin. If this is the case it's best to use
a light ball.
</P>

<H3>GENERAL</H3>

<P>
As well as the above there's plenty of other handy little tips that
can be picked up through experience. One of the most important is
where to position the bowler to get the potential out of a shot.
Sometimes it's best not to line up straight in front of the pin
you're aiming at, but to come at it from the side, or use a bit of
spin.
</P>

<P>
Also the little arrow that flickers around in front of the bowler
goes faster the more umph you put behind the ball. Sometimes it's
best to throw a little bit slower and get the direction right,
rather than just throw as hard as you can and hope it goes in the
right direction.
</P>

<P>
Even if you do end up aiming it straight at the gutter, don't give
up on it. If you see it veering down one of the sides slap some
spin on, by pressing left or right on the joypad after you let go
and it will end up heading for the pins. Even if you just get one,
it's better than nothing.
