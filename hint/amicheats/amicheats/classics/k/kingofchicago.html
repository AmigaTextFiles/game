<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Chicago in the '30s. Prohibition, power struggles, and rampant
crime. Only the toughest of the tough survive. Capone used to call
the shots. But Big Al was sent up the river and Chicago is up for
grabs. Violence, intimidation, bribery, and treachery are your
weapons as you play the role of Pinly Callahan, an ambitious hood on
the make. You'll lead the Northside gang against the forces of the
legendary Capone mob in a deadly battle for control of the Windy
City.

<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
Well, since the game isn't cut-and-dry like a Sierra Game, I'll give
you a few pointers.
</P>

<P>
Try to get the game where it starts and you're in the chair saying,
"This is where I belong...." or you are standing in the hall saying,
"The boss will pull up in a few minutes...." Go on the bombing run
with the boys. Throw the bomb when you're at the window BEFORE the
one with the light. If it's the first window, throw the bomb as
soon as you're onto the screen. If you miss, don't worry, you'll
have a second chance.
</P>

<P>
The next thing to do is get Ben on your side, don't be direct at
first about "bumping off" the old man, but when you do ask him,
offer him 20 grand a month, he will accept 90% of the time. After
you kill the old man (you should be able to figure that out), first
take over the west side. Offer Alderman Burke two thousand a month
(Select "Buy him while he's still friendly" and "I'll bet he comes
cheap"). Either before or after you do this you should "hit the
dives". Bet a heap on the craps roll. If you lose, you'll probably
lose the game. If you win, you'll probably win.
</P>

<P>
Next, go for the East Side (The Loop). If you won the Craps game,
Alderman Burke will probably become mayor. From then on you're
pretty much all set. You should meet up with a problem where some
of your girls are being kidnapped. "I always said Dames was
trouble". Select things so that you end up getting out your
Tommy-Gun (Thompson) and "cruise the alley" (I can't be specific
because the actual quotes are different every time). Go up to the
room and select to shoot your way into the room. Blow off the
doorknob and then you'll see hands with guns coming out of the
darkness to shoot you. Make sure you're over the hands with your
sights before you shoot (take your time). You can get shot AT LEAST
twice before you die, maybe more, so stay calm and it'll get easy.
</P>

<P>
Next, go for The South Side. There may be several ways to win, but
this is my way (and it worked great). Select Make a Hit on
Santucci, select a bomb instead of a single bullet. The bombing run
is the same as before, use the same pointers as above. If the run
is successful, you'll then have to enter the smoking Palace and blow
away Guido and then Santucci, and then you've won!
