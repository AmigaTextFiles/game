<H2>SOLVE</H2>

<P>
The first level is outside of the castle, the second level is
inside, and the third is under the first level. Each level has its
own group of fighters, although the third level is somewhat
intermixed.
</P>

<P>
You must have completeD mastery of the controls in order to win this
game. If you can't control your man, practice. It is not too
difficult, using the joystick of course.
</P>

<H3>LEVEL ONE</H3>

<P>
When you start this level, you have just climbed the castle and you
are standing in front of an enemy. Notice this man's head. It is
by the head, or mask, that each fighter is distinguished from the
other.
</P>

<P>
Against the fighters of level one, there are two strategies you can
use:
</P>

<OL>
<LI>KICK IN THE FOOT METHOD: This method is almost "cheap." These
fighters will move towards you constantly. All you have to do is
stand back and whenever they move forward, do a downward kick three
times. If you do this a sufficient number of times, the man will
die. You might suffer a few blows, but that is no problem. You
will kill all the guards.
<LI>BANZAI METHOD: The other strategy you can use on the first
level guards is the so called banzai method. All you do here is
press both buttons all the time while moving forward. By pressing
both buttons, you will be kicking and punching randomly, thus
confusing and killing the guard. This method will not work on any
other level, i guarantee it.
</OL>

<P>
HINTS: Remember that the first level guard will always be moving
forward. Take advantage of this be remembering that he will be on
the wrong foot for an attack.
</P>

<P>
After you kill the first guard, run immediately. After the internal
display, an enemy guard will begin to run to you. Keep running when
the screen switches back to you. When it switches back to the
guard, and then to you, count to two and let up. You will be in
perfect position for an attack.
</P>

<H3>LEVEL TWO</H3>

<P>
The bird appears in this level. Please see the explanation of the
bird in the third level.
</P>

<P>
Note that the first guard encountered in the second level is a first
level guard!
</P>

<P>
This level is much like the first, except that the guards do not
move forward all the time. This eliminates the "kick in the foot"
method. Also, the banzai method will not work because the guards
are often waiting for an attack.
</P>

<P>
When you encounter a level two guard, he will usually, after the
usual tangle and seperation, begin a kicking sequence. By saying
the "usual tangle and seperation," i am alluding to the fact that
you will rush up to him, fight a bit, and then back off or be
knocked off. Anyway, when you seperate, the guard will do several
1-kicks, and then either move forward or being doing 3-kicks. A
1-kick is a single kick, while a 3-kick is a series of 3 kicks.
</P>

<P>
HERE IS WHAT YOU CAN DO: When the guard does a 1-kick, as soon as
his foot begins to retreat, move forward and punch. I usually
prefer to punch downward in this attack, but it is not that
important. Now, you might be asking what if he is doing a 3-kick
and i think it is a 1-kick? The answer is that you will get knocked
several times. Knowing that the first several times are 1-kicks,
you can either wait until he begins 3-kicks or just guess and hope.
If you guess wrong and the blows start falling, pull out because you
are in a bad position to kick, your legs are crossed, and you can
not benefit out of a 1 for 4 trade off.
</P>

<P>
If the guard begins to charge at you, the kick in the foot method
will not always work, mainly because the guard comes at you with a
kick already going. What you should do here:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>Hope he is doing a 1-kick and get knocked but the punch him.
<LI>Pull back quickly, wait until his foot is releasing, and then go
in for the kill.
</UL>

<P>
If you are losing the fight, i would recommend the second method.
</P>

<P>
THE FALLING GATE: When you get to the end of the second level,
there is a gate. If you run or walk through the gate, it falls on
you and you die. Always. This is what you do. Walk very slowly up
to the gate and get right next to it. Then quickly move forward and
back. You must do this fast of you will die. The gate will then
fall, but, not on you. As the gate begins to rise, run into it.
Notice i said, run, not walk. You will lose a point every time your
head hits the gate, but keep running and start early so you have
time. As you run through the gate, you get to the third level.
</P>

<H3>LEVEL THREE</H3>

<P>
The level three guards are not stupid and are fast. They will not
charge foolishly towards you, and will wait for the kill. Also at
this point, you have very few points compared to the guards, so be
careful and watch how many points you have.
</P>

<P>
The basic strategy that i employ when fighting level three guards is
this:
</P>

<OL>
<LI>Wait until the start doing kicks.
<LI>Move in quickly and hit them with a punch, maybe two if you are
lucky. If they stand there, kick them, if they move back, that is
fine. You just inflicted 1 or 2 points on them at no cost to
yourself.
<LI>If they insist on fighting, your best bet is to punch. In the
time that it takes to get a kick going, they will punch you away.
</OL>

<P>
Remember that if one kick nails you, more are coming, so get out of
the way fast.
</P>

<P>
THE BIRD: The bird is very difficult to kill. However, once you
get it down, it becomes easy.
</P>

<P>
After you have killed 4 level 3 guards, you will suddenly get a
large amount of points. You will get to a blocked door in front of
you.
</P>

<P>
When you go to kick it in, do an upwards kick. As soon as the door
breaks in, wait a millisecond, and then do 2 more up kicks. This
will knock the bird before it gets a chance on you.
</P>

<P>
From here on, it is up to you. I prefer kicking the bird and it is
easiest when it is on the top level. Just wait until the bird is 1
1/2 inches in front of you, and then kick 3 times. If you get it
good, if not, try again.
</P>

<P>
AKIMA HIMSELF: He really is no different than any other level 3
guard. Ignore the fact that he appears bigger and concentrate on
getting in 1 or 2 punches after some kicks.
</P>

<P>
Kill him, run into the room where the princess is standing. If you
walk, she kills you. Just run right into her.
</P>

<P>
One technique that i did not mention is spar fighting. In this
method, just wait until he is not kicking, jump up and punch. There
is a delayed reaction, so pull back right after you have hit the
button. You might think you will not punch, but you will and
usually hit. Sometimes you will get hit back, but not always. You
can use this technique on the level 3 guards which can be difficult
sometimes.
