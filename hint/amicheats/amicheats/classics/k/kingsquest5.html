<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Fans of the series will be happy to note the return of King Graham
of Daventry, hero of two previous King's Quest games. In a sudden
turn from his serene and untroubled life in the peaceful kingdom of
Daventry, Graham must once again don his adventurer's cap to rescue
his queen and his son and daughter, who have been kidnapped by the
evil and powerful magician, Mordack. With the help of a kindly old
wizard and a talking owl, Graham journeys to far lands on the most
exciting and perilous quest of his life.
</P>

<H2>Q & A</H2>

<P>
Q: What do I do in the streets of Serenia?
</P>

<P>
A: After you visit one of the shops in the town of Serenia, you
can find a silver coin in the street. It will be located just
outside the tailor's door at the entrance to an alley. There is
also a barrel in the alley entrance. Be sure to look in the barrel
and take the fish.
</P>

<P>
Q: What do I do at the Tailor's Shop?
</P>

<P>
A: You can get a blue cloak from the tailor. But first you will
need to get the golden needle from the haystack beside the Swarthy
Hog's Inn. Give the tailor the golden needle and he will give you
the cloak. Tip: You may need an army of help to find the needle!
</P>

<P>
Q: What do I do at the Shoe Shop?
</P>

<P>
A: The shoe maker is very poor and would like to retire. If only
he had enough money. Perhaps if he had a rare pair of shoes to
sell. You can get him such a pair of shoes from an elf in the
witch's forest.
</P>

<P>
Q: What do I do at the Toy Shop?
</P>

<P>
A: The toy maker will gladly accept the marionette you got from
grandpa gnome and his grandson. He will exchange the marionette for
a sled.
</P>

<P>
Q: How do I avoid dying of thirst?
</P>

<P>
A: Drink from a desert oasis. There are many of them to drink
from. In fact, in the extreme desert heat, an oasis provides a good
place to save your game.
</P>

<P>
Q: What should I do with the skeleton I found?
</P>

<P>
A: You will notice a shoe near the skeleton. Get the old shoe.
</P>

<P>
Q: Where can I find the skeleton?
</P>

<P>
A: The skeleton is in the desert. Start at the Bee tree, go west
4 screens. The next screen west is an oasis, enter this screen and
drink. Go west 2 more screens, then south 1 screen. You should now
see the skeleton. Get the old shoe.
</P>

<P>
Q: Where can I find the Temple?
</P>

<P>
A: Start at the Bee tree, go west 4 screens. The next screen
west is an oasis. Enter this screen and drink. Go north 2 screens
from the oasis, until you are next to the cliff. Go west 3 screens
along the cliff, you should see an opening in the cliff and a small
pool of water near the rocks. Make sure to drink from the pool. Go
north 1 screen at the opening. You should be at the temple.
</P>

<P>
Q: How can I find the Bandit's camp?
</P>

<P>
A: Start at the Bee tree, go west 4 screens. The next screen
west is an oasis. Enter this screen and drink. Go west 2 more
screens, then south 3 screens. You should now be at another oasis.
Drink. Go south 1 more screen, then go west until you reach the
tents (4 screens). You are now at the camp. Be sure to drink from
the large jug in the middle of the camp.
</P>

<P>
Q: How do I avoid being killed by the bandits in front of the
temple?
</P>

<P>
A: Hide from them behind the rocks on the east side of the
entrance to the temple. Spy on the bandits and pay special
attention to the staff that one of them is carrying.
</P>

<P>
Q: I'm at the bandits' hideout and there are many drunken bandits
around. What should I do?
</P>

<P>
A: At the bandits' hideout, enter the first tent. The bandit has
fallen asleep at his post! Be careful not to wake him. Sneak to
the back of the tent and get the staff leaning against the back of
the tent. Then leave the tent quietly. You can use this staff to
get into the temple.
</P>

<P>
Q: I'm at the bandits' hideout and the place looks abandoned.
What should I do?
</P>

<P>
A: If there is no one at the bandits' hideout, you'll need to
come back later. Go to the entrance of the desert temple and hide
behind some rocks on the east side at the base of the cliff. Spy on
the bandits and pay special attention to the staff that one of them
is carrying.
</P>

<P>
Q: What do I do with the staff?
</P>

<P>
A: Do you recall seeing the bandits open the desert temple with
the staff? Now it's your turn. Go to the desert temple and use the
staff to open the temple. When you get inside, quickly take the
gold coin and brass bottle from the floor and get out of the temple.
</P>

<P>
Q: How do I avoid being sealed up in the desert temple?
</P>

<P>
A: Save your game just before entering the temple. When you
enter the temple to get the brass bottle and gold coin, do it
quickly. There is just enough time to get these two items only and
then head out of the opening. Don't spend any extra time in here or
you'll be sealed up forever!
</P>

<P>
Q: How do I get rid of the witch?
</P>

<P>
A: Remember the brass bottle you got out of the desert temple?
Well, it's time to use it. Give the brass bottle to the witch.
She's so greedy that she'll snatch up the bottle and open it. Stand
back and watch her own greed be her demise.
</P>

<P>
Q: What should I get from the witch's house?
</P>

<P>
A: You'll need to take the pouch from her chest of drawers, the
spinning wheel from her trunk, and a key from her lantern.
</P>

<P>
Q: That witch keeps turning me into a frog. How do I protect
myself from her evil magic powers?
</P>

<P>
A: You'll need to see the Gypsy, Madam Mushka. Give Madam Mushka
the gold coin you got from the desert temple. She will give you a
magic amulet that will protect you from the witch's evil spells.
</P>

<P>
Q: I've seen a tree with a locked door on it near the witch's
house. How do I open it?
</P>

<P>
A: Use the key that you got from the witch's lantern to unlock
the door of the tree.
</P>

<P>
Q: What should I find inside the tree?
</P>

<P>
A: You should find a golden heart. Take it and give it to the
talking willow tree you saw outside the witch's forest.
</P>

<P>
Q: I've gotten rid of the witch, but now I seem to be trapped in
the witch's forest. How do I get out of here?
</P>

<P>
A: To get out of the witch's forest, go one screen west from her
house. Select the honeycomb from your inventory, and squeeze the
honey onto the trail. The pouch you took from the witch's house
contains some emeralds. Open the pouch by selecting your inventory,
then use the "hand" icon to open the pouch. Select the emeralds and
throw three of them (1 at a time) onto the trail. An elf will
appear and lead you out of the witch's forest.
</P>

<P>
Q: What do I do with the spinning wheel I got from the witch's
house?
</P>

<P>
A: Remember the grandpa gnome you saw in the main forest? You
now have something that will interest him. This is a special
spinning wheel, which he'll gladly trade you for his grandson's
marionette.
</P>

<P>
Q: Every time I go into the Swarthy Hog's Inn, a hardened
criminal knocks me unconscious, throws me into the basement, and the
game ends. What am I supposed to do here?
</P>

<P>
A: Unfortunately, you will have to be knocked unconscious by the
disreputable thug and thrown in the basement. However, if you made
friends with the rat outside the Baker Brothers' Bake Shop (by
throwing an old shoe at the mangy cat chasing him), he'll free you
by gnawing the rope that they've tied you up with. Once free, take
the rope and use the hammer the shoe maker gave you to break the
lock on the door. Go into the kitchen, get the leg of lamb from the
cabinet, then exit the Swarthy Hog's Inn through the back door of
the kitchen.
</P>

<P>
Q: Where do I get a gold coin to give to the Gypsy, Madam Mushka?
</P>

<P>
A: You can get a gold coin from the temple in the desert. It
will be on the floor beside a brass bottle.
</P>

<P>
Q: Cedric warns me to stay away from some bees in the hollow of a
tree. Should I stay away from those bees?
</P>

<P>
A: Heed Cedric's advice. After all, you don't want a swarm of
angry bees after you! However, if you see a bear attacking the bee
tree, offer your assistance. Remember the fish you got out of the
barrel in town? Throw the fish to the bear. He'll leave the bees
alone and the queen bee will reward you for your kindness.
</P>

<P>
Q: How do I get the dog to stop digging up the ant castle?
</P>

<P>
A: Be sure to pick up the stick at the base of the bee tree.
Throw the stick at the dog and he'll forget all about the ant
castle. And for your kindness, the king of the ants will vow to
help you with your journey later.
</P>

<P>
Q: How can I get the marionette from the little gnome boy and his
grandfather?
</P>

<P>
A: Do you remember the spinning wheel you got from the witch?
Well, that was no ordinary spinning wheel! Offer this spinning
wheel to grandpa gnome and he'll trade you the marionette for it.
</P>

<P>
Q: How can I help both Prince Herbert and the talking tree?
</P>

<P>
A: You will find out that the talking tree is actually Prince
Herbert's fiance. You can help her by returning her heart to her.
You'll find her heart locked inside a tree just one screen east of
the witch's house. Once you have the heart, return it to the
talking tree. She'll turn into the beautiful princess Alicia.
Since she'll no longer have a use for the harp she's been playing,
she'll toss it to the ground. Be sure to pick up the harp.
</P>

<P>
Q: Where do I get the silver coin to buy a pie at the Baker
Brothers' Bake Shop?
</P>

<P>
A: You can find a silver coin in the streets of the city. You'll
find it at an alley entrance near the tailor's shop.
</P>

<P>
Q: I've seen a large rat being chased by a mangy cat in front of
the Baker Brothers' Bake Shop. Should I try to help the rat?
</P>

<P>
A: Yes, throw the old shoe (you found beside the skeleton in the
desert) at the cat. The rat will be so grateful, that he'll help
you later in your journey.
</P>

<P>
Q: How do I get the poisonous snake away from the path it is
guarding?
</P>

<P>
A: When Madam Mushka's Gypsy caravan pulled away, they dropped a
tambourine at their old campsite. Shake the tambourine at the snake
and you'll scare him away.
</P>

<P>
Q: I've come to a snowy ledge where a now-frozen waterfall has
washed away part of the path I'm traveling on. How do I get off
this ledge without dying?
</P>

<P>
A: Use the rope you kept (from the basement of the Swarthy Hog's
Inn) and throw it over the rock on the edge of the cliff. You can
then climb up the cliff.
</P>

<P>
Q: I'm on the upper trail of the mountain now and the waterfall
has washed away parts of this trail as well. How do I join Cedric
on the other side?
</P>

<P>
A: Carefully walk to the edge of the cliff and jump onto the
small boulders of ice protruding from the frozen waterfall. You can
hop on these boulders to get to the other side. Once you get over
there, walk on the log. You've now joined Cedric.
</P>

<P>
Q: Help! Cedric's been captured by a wolf! Every time I run
after him, I slip and fall off the mountain. How can I rescue him?
</P>

<P>
A: Did you get the sled from the toy maker in town? You had to
trade him grandpa gnome's marionette for the sled. Use that sled
here to get down the mountain slope.
</P>

<P>
Q: I've seen a poor, hungry eagle outside Queen Icebella's
Palace. What could I give him?
</P>

<P>
A: Yes. Feed him the leg of lamb (that you got from the kitchen
cupboard of the Swarthy Hog's Inn). However, be sure Graham eats
some of the lamb before giving the leg to the eagle.
</P>

<P>
Q: Graham is becoming hungry. What can I feed him?
</P>

<P>
A: Feed Graham some of the lamb before giving the leg to the
eagle.
</P>

<P>
Q: Queen Icebella keeps commanding her wolves to kill me. How
can I avoid this?
</P>

<P>
A: Remember the harp Princess Alicia dropped? Well, play it for
Queen Icebella and she'll call off her wolves.
</P>

<P>
Q: How do you kill a Yeti anyway?
</P>

<P>
A: You can kill the Yeti by throwing the pie (you got from the
Baker Brothers' Bake Shop) into the Yeti's face. After you've
killed the Yeti, go into Crystal Cave and get a glowing Crystal.
</P>

<P>
Q: I'm on a very confusing and windy path above a swift river
coursing its way through a ravine. How do I get out of here?
</P>

<P>
A: You will notice a pool high up on the cliff where Cedric is
sitting. Move to the opening in the center of the cliff below and
Graham will climb the mountain to join Cedric. As soon as he gets
up there, he'll be captured by Roc and taken away to this two-headed
bird's nest.
</P>

<P>
Q: I've seen a rusty crowbar on the beach. Should I take it?
</P>

<P>
A: Yes. You never know when a rusty crowbar will come in handy.
</P>

<P>
Q: I'm at a hermit's house on the beach. I'm trying to talk to
him, but he's hard of hearing. How can I get him to hear me?
</P>

<P>
A: To get the old hermit to hear what you have to say, travel to
island of Harpies and be sure to pick up a conch shell on the beach.
You can give the conch shell to him, which he'll use as a hearing
aid.
</P>

<P>
Q: The boat, Cedric, and I keep getting eaten by a giant sea
creature. How can we avoid being eaten?
</P>

<P>
A: When you're traveling in the ocean, it's best to map your
journey to the island Harpies. The best way to avoid being eaten by
the sea creature is to travel a direct route to and from the island
of Harpies. When traveling from the beach where you found the boat,
go 3 or 4 screens east then south 1 screen. When returning from the
island of Harpies to the hermit, go west until you reach the shore.
</P>

<P>
Q: How do I keep the Harpies from eating me?
</P>

<P>
A: You can easily distract the Harpies from killing you by giving
them an object you have. Remember the harp you picked up from
Princess Alicia? Play the harp then give it to one of the Harpies.
They'll fight over it and that will give you a chance to escape.
</P>

<P>
Q: Cedric's been hurt on the island of Harpies. Where can I take
him to be healed?
</P>

<P>
A: You'll want to take Cedric back to the Hermit who is hard of
hearing. Also, be sure to pick up the conch shell from the beach.
You can give the shell to the Hermit, so he can hear you. He'll
heal Cedric by using special poultice herbs.
</P>

<P>
Q: I've seen a shell on the beach at the island of Harpies. Do I
need it?
</P>

<P>
A: Yes. You can give the shell to the Hermit, which he'll use as
a hearing aid. He has many things to tell you and will assist you
in your journey.
</P>

<P>
Q: I've landed on Mordack's Island. When I walk up the path
leading to his castle, two cobra dragon statues kill me. How can I
get past them without being fried?
</P>

<P>
A: Do you remember killing the Yeti for Queen Icebella? Well,
after you killed him, did you get a glowing crystal from Crystal
Cave? Use the crystal now to protect yourself from these dragons'
deadly breath!
</P>

<P>
Q: How do I get into Mordack's Castle?
</P>

<P>
A: Don't go into the castle through the main door. Instead, walk
up the path on the west side of the castle. You will come to an
opening in the ground covered by a grate. Use the crowbar to pry
open the grate. You do have a crowbar, don't you? If not, you can
find the crowbar to the north of the hermit's house.
</P>

<P>
Q: I'm lost in a maze inside Mordack's Castle. What am I
supposed to do in here and how do I get out?
</P>

<P>
A: You will find two things in Mordack's maze; a Dink and a door.
When you find the Dink, give him the tambourine you got from the
Gypsy campsite and he will dance a crazy dance. While he's dancing,
one of Dink's hairpins will fall to the ground. Use the Dink's
hairpin to open the locked door.
</P>

<P>
Q: I'm in Mordack's supply room. What am I supposed to get here?
</P>

<P>
A: Get the bag of peas out of the cupboard on the west wall.
</P>

<P>
Q: I'm in Mordack's kitchen and there's a woman cleaning the
floor. What does she want?
</P>

<P>
A: Yes. Approach Cassima and give her the locket that you found
in Roc's nest. In return for your kindness, she will help you later
on.
</P>

<P>
Q: Every time I enter the hallway beside the kitchen, one of
Mordack's henchmen captures me and throws me into a prison cell in
the basement. How do I get past this henchman?
</P>

<P>
A: When you see the henchman coming at you, throw the bag of peas
at him. He will slip on the peas and fall unconscious. Quickly
walk past him into the dining hall.
</P>

<P>
Q: I've been thrown into a prison cell in Mordack's basement.
How do I escape?
</P>

<P>
A: Do you remember seeing the woman, Cassima, cleaning the
kitchen floor? Well, you needed to give her the locket that you
found in Roc's nest. Had you given her the locket, she'd have freed
you from the prison cell. Also, be sure to look in the rat's hole
in the prison cell and get the moldy cheese with the fish hook (that
you found on the island of Harpies). That moldy cheese will come in
very handy.
</P>

<P>
Q: I'm trying to go up the stairway beside the dining room, but
another one of Mordack's henchmen captures me and returns me to the
prison cell in the basement. How do I get past this one?
</P>

<P>
A: This henchman is a little easier to get around than the first
one. Go into the dining room and walk to the northeast corner of
the dining table. The henchman will try to block your way. But
he's big and moves very slowly. Quickly walk around to the other
side of the table and walk right past him!
</P>

<P>
Q: I'm sneaking around Mordack's bedroom and a very mean cat
keeps alerting Mordack that I'm there. How do I keep this cat
quiet?
</P>

<P>
A: Remember when you landed on Mordack's island and wrecked the
boat? Well, right on the beach was a dead catfish. Did you get the
fish? If so, throw it at the cat and while he's eating the fish
carefully approach him and trap him in the empty bag of peas. But
do be careful, for he's a vicious cat!
</P>

<P>
Q: I'm in Mordack's study. What's worth reading?
</P>

<P>
A: Go over to his desk and take a look at the old tome. When you
thumb through the pages you'll acquire the tiger spell, the mongoose
spell, the rabbit spell, and the rain cloud spell. Wait in the
study until you see Mordack return to his bedroom and go to sleep.
Next, go into his bedroom and take the wand from his nightstand.
Tip: You must bag a cat before Mordack shows up!
</P>

<P>
Q: Every time I go into Mordack's laboratory, he sees me and
kills me. How do I avoid him killing me?
</P>

<P>
A: Don't go in the laboratory when Mordack is there. First,
you'll want to go to Mordack's bedroom and then to his study. Read
the old tome in his study and wait there. After awhile, Mordack
will return to his bedroom and go to sleep. Go back into his
bedroom and get the wand from his nightstand. Now you can safely go
into his laboratory.
</P>

<P>
Q: I've got Mordack's wand. Now what?
</P>

<P>
A: Go up the spiral staircase and put both Crispin's and
Mordack's wands into the machine upstairs. Next, put the piece of
moldy cheese (you got from the rat's hole in the prison cell of
Mordack's basement) into the machine. This will drain the power
from Mordack's wand and at the same time charge up Crispin's wand.
Finally, remove Crispin's wand from the machine.
</P>

<P>
Q: I've gone up a spiral staircase in Mordack's laboratory and
have found a machine. How do I use it?
</P>

<P>
A: Put both Crispin's and Mordack's wand into the machine. Next,
put the piece of moldy cheese (you got from the rat's hole in the
prison cell of Mordack's basement) into the machine. This will
drain the power from Mordack's wand and at the same time charge up
Crispin's wand. Finally, remove Crispin's wand from the machine.
</P>

<P>
Q: I've successfully drained Mordack's magical wand, but now he's
turned into a giant dragonfly. How do I defeat him?
</P>

<P>
A: Be sure to get the spells by thumbing through the old tome in
Mordack's study. Then when Mordack comes after you as a dragonfly,
select Crispin's wand from your inventory. Point the wand at
Mordack and you'll be able to select from four spells. To defeat
the dragonfly, select the tiger spell.
</P>

<P>
Q: Mordack has turned himself into a dragon. How do I defeat
him?
</P>

<P>
A: Be sure to get the spells by thumbing through the old tome in
Mordack's study. Then when Mordack comes after you as a dragon,
select Crispin's wand from your inventory. Point the wand at
Mordack and you'll be able to select from four spells. To foil
Mordack's plans to destroy you this time, select the rabbit spell.
</P>

<P>
Q: Mordack has turned himself into a cobra. How do I defeat him?
</P>

<P>
A: Be sure to get the spells by thumbing through the old tome in
Mordack's study. Then when Mordack comes after you as a cobra,
select Crispin's wand from your inventory. Point the wand at
Mordack and you'll be able to select from four spells. To defeat
the cobra, select the mongoose spell.
</P>

<P>
Q: Mordack has turned himself into a ring of fire. How do I
defeat him?
</P>

<P>
A: Be sure to get the spells by thumbing through the old tome in
Mordack's study. Then when Mordack comes after you as a ring of
fire, select Crispin's wand from your inventory. Point the wand at
Mordack and you'll be able to select from four spells. Select the
rain cloud spell and you'll rid your kingdom of Mordack.
