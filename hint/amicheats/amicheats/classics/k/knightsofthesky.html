<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
A simulation of aerial combat and gallantry in World War I. You are
a hunter stalking Germany's most celebrated pilots, including the
infamous Baron Manfred von Richthofen. Using news and intelligence
reports as well as your own intuition, you track down the 16 men
whose successes diminish your own. In the gallant tradition of the
ancient knights, you challenge each to determine who is truly World
War I's Ace of Aces.
</P>

<H2>CHEATS</H2>

<P>
If you're doing badly and your plane is heavily shot, land in a
field & keep the engines running. Drive to a friendly airbase
avoiding any trenches. Enemy planes try to shoot you but always
miss, they do however fly in front of you so you can zap them.
</P>

<P>
After take-off, hit 'A' to accelerate time. You will now be immune
to enemy gun fire. Now climb well above the clouds, until a certain
altitude is reached. Soon, all the enemy aircraft will hang
motionless in the air, allowing you to shoot them all down.
