<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Set in an alien solar system where all violence has been
eradicated, the hottest inter-planet TV game show is The Killing
Game. In this game competitors are selected from each planet and
have to negotiate the defenses on opposing planets. These play areas
are all based inside cylindrical arenas which are slowly filling
with water. The object is simply to reach the exit at the top of
each cylinder without being destroyed. The player will take the part
of a competitor from one of the planets involved. They will travel
between the various worlds taking the challenge of the natural
terrain of each planet. The arenas will vary from planet to planet.
Some will be made of Caverns, Roman Temples, Organic Materials, and
other forms. There will be eight planets, and three cylinders on each
planet making twenty-four levels in all.
