<P>
This cheat involves the woodland section on the first level. Use
the spade to help you find the five apples. Take these apples and
throw them at the quest shield that hangs on the wall, and make
each character consume two rabbit pies from the inventory screen.
Continue with your quest and you should find that your hit points
never decrease.
