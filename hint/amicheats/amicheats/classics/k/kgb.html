<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
There is a section in Chapter 4 where you have to go through the
right door. The best thing to do is to save the game before you go
through a door, and then if it is the wrong door just load the saved
game and try again.
</P>

<P>
If you want to try and make any sense of the plot and what happens,
then have a pen and paper ready and make a note of every major thing
you find out, as it will help you to understand what has happened at
the end of the game.
