<H2>CHEATS</H2>

<P>
You can always make the other guy miss the shot totally just by
holding down the fire button while he attempts to make a shot, it
will be blocked, knocked over the net or you goal keeper will save
it.
</P>

<P>
When the oppostion take a penalty against you, press 'P' to pause
immediately after the ball is kicked. Now hold the joystick in the
direction the ball is travelling. Unpause, and your keeper should
be a hero.
