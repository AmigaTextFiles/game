<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
To get past the mosquitoes you need the bottle from the oasis. You have
to dig to find it. Inside are Anti-maleria tablets. Use the rope to get
past the swamp, then go north into the quicksand. Quickly throw the rope
and then pull until your free. To cross the bridge, throw the spear,
then go to the bridge, and when it starts to collapse, type "RUN" then
jump.
