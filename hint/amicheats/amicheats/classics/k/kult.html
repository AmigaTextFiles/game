<H2>TIPS</H2>

<UL>
<LI>Don't waste your Psi-Powers, they are needed much later on in
the game. If you run out of it early you can't complete the game.
<LI>Don't fight the guards in the Monster's Orbit. You will be
instantly killed.
<LI>If you go onto the concourse before you become a divo, you won't
be able to complete the game.
</UL>

<H2>SOLVE</H2>

<P>
How to complete the five ordeals.
</P>

<H3>THE TWINS</H3>

<P>
Object needed - GOBLET.
</P>

<P>
Go to the source on the left hand side. Inspect the fountain and
press the eye. Fill the Goblet and go back to the room called 'THE
TWINS'. Open the left-hand serpent and empty the goblet into it.
Get the die that emerges from the serpent then open the right hand
serpent. Throw the die, and note the number thrown. Put the die
into the right-hand serpent and go to the room facing you. The
hands are in a dice formation (except for the middle one) Pull up
the hands until they resemble the formation you threw earlier, then
push the serpent's head on the wall. The sliding partition should
open; note down the shape which it covered. Go back to the fountain
room and inspect each cube (each is patterned). Lift the cube which
resembles the one you found behind the sliding partition.
</P>

<H3>IN THE SCORPION'S PRESENCE</H3>

<P>
Object needed - FLY.
</P>

<P>
Pray to the statue then enter the room called 'THE WEB'. Look at
the web on the floor and crawl on it. Give the mistress the fly;
show affection but don't be too saucy with her. Feed the fly to the
blue spider and get the red one. Leave the room, and then put the
red spider into the statue's mouth. Don't listen to the man who
pops out, just pass through the trap door.
</P>

<H3>THE WALL</H3>

<P>
Object needed - DAGGER or you can use the PSI-SHIFT.
</P>

<P>
First choose the third zone, then the second zone; this means that
you can unlock the sliding wall when you open either door. Go
through either door, left or right, and inspect the step. Then take
a look at the slot on the Sculpted Warrior and climb onto the step.
Either put your dagger into the slot, or if you haven't got one, use
Psi-Shift. You will be spun around by the wall. There are now TWO
separate gaps in the wall, one which goes straight on, and the other
is a dark, black strip; it depends on which door you have taken.
Move the cursor to go down the black passage, not straight on.
Stick your hand in the gap on the floor. Return the way you came,
and this time go straight on.
</P>

<H3>DE PROFUNDIS</H3>

<P>
Object needed - ROPE.
</P>

<P>
First of all, wait. Then lasso your rope onto the hook on the
ceiling. When the Granite Monster lurks towards you, jump onto him.
Wait a few minutes.
</P>

<H3>THE NOOSE</H3>

<P>
Object needed - none.
</P>

<P>
Do not do as the Poormouth says. Use either the lantern, or your
Solar Eyes Power. Grab hold of left hand rope and climb up. Push
the lever, remove the noose-rope and he will fall. Take the
left-hand piece of rope. Inspect the hollow on the platform.
Finally, leave and go to the Master's Orbit.
</P>

<H3>AFTER THOSE ORDEALS</H3>

<P>
Give all five skulls to the Protozorg underneath the trader. He
will announce that you are a divot. Go to the concourse outside the
ring, and remember, if you are asked any questions, show the egg you
were given. Once you are in the concourse, ignore the guard and use
all the violence you can muster on the upper right-hand guard; then
enter the upper right-hand passage.
</P>

<P>
Go left. Inspect the toad's head and poke it's eye. Use the
Lantern (if you have it) or the Solar Eyes to see. Inspect the
lever and the trap door. Use Psi-Shift on the lever and pass
through the trap door. Next keep going straight through until you
meet Norma Jean and Ash. You MUST do as Norma Jean says. Don't
move !! Tell her the truth...talk to both of them and then use your
Zone Scan. Lift your block on the floor and get both objects, the
beam and the flask. Unwrap the bandages from the mummy, go to the
left and keep going forward.
</P>

<P>
By going through the trap door you will enter the Threshold of
Truth. Kill the priestess and put the egg in the opened mouth.
Next off, take a look at the Lantern. Read the book, then use your
Psi-Shift on the statuette to retrieve it on the left-hand side,
near the ceiling.
</P>

<P>
Leave and go to the refectory, then go to Saura's Repose. Put the
statuette you found into the niche then go to the Presence of God,
and then to Placating the Powers. Kill the first priestess, then
make use of Psi-Shift on Saura's Mark, aiming it at her dagger. Use
Brain Warp on the character, Sci-Fi, then giver her the flask to
drink. Go to Saura's Repose, putting the monkey into the small
tunnel. Enter the Presence of God and wait. Go into the passage.
Wait. Use aggro on the god, Zorg, and then use Brain Warp on
Pratozim, who is holding Sci-Fi hostage. Use Psi-Shift on trap
door, and finally, throw the knife or dagger at Pratozim.
