<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
The peaceful land of Turnvale has been seized by the enchantress
Selena - and so, it seems, have you. Enter the world of Virtual
Theatre, and innovative new graphic adventure system where fantasy
becomes reality, and characters take on a life of their own. You are
Diermot, an unlikely hero caught up in a web of sorcery and
intrigue. Match your wits against the cruel temptress and her
monstrous creatures, the Skorl. Just who is this Selena, and what is
she after?
</P>

<H2>SOLVE</H2>

<P>
As soon as you find yourself in THE CELL you have to...
</P>

<P>
PULL TORCH, and move closer to the door, so when the guard goes in,
you leave immeditely. When you leave.. CLOSE DOOR and then LOCK
DOOR, so that he won't hurt you. TALK TO PRISONER, and he'll
ask you for water, go to GUARD ROOM, GET KNIFE, GET BOTTLE, LOOK AT
BARREL, USE TAP ON BOTTLE, USE KNIFE ON SACK LOOK AT SACK, and then
go right to TORTURE ROOM, you'll see the guy... USE KNIFE ON
LEATHER CORD, it's fixed to his feet... From now on he'll follow
you wherever you go. Go back to THE OUTER CELL, and GIVE BOTTLE TO
PRISONER, he'll tell you 'bout the way of escape'. TELL RATPOUCH TO
PUSH BRICKS, when he leaves go after him...
</P>

<P>
You are now in the SEWER OUTLET.. (some village map will help ya)
Go to THE FORGE, GET TINDERBOX (on the floor), TALK TO LUTHERN,
leave and go to SEVERED ARMS, TALK TO EILEAIN, leave and talk to
MALLIN (the guy in green clothes), he'll give you METAL BAR, go with
it to VILLAGE SHOP, and GIVE IT TO EWAN, he'll give you some money
and GEM. Go to MAGPIE TAVERN, TALK TO MARKUS, BRIBE MARKUS, TALK TO
MARKUS once again, then TALK TO MALLIN, go to THE FORGE, TALK TO
LUTHERN, go back to MAGPIE COURTYARD and TALK TO GRUB, the guy lying
on the ground. Ask him 'bout the BLACK GOAT'. Now TALK TO LUTHERN,
(again, shhh), go to SEVERED ARMS and TALK TO EILEAIN, she'll give
you the DIARY, EXAMIN DIARY, go back to MAGPIE TAWERN and GIVE GEM
TO NELLIE. She'll give you a FLASK. DRINK FLASK.. See blacksmith,
GIVE FLASK TO LUTHERN, so he'll empty it for you. Nice going. Now
go to MARKET PLACE, GIVE LOCKPICK TO RATPOUCH... And at this moment
you should save the game, because you don't know what will happen
next.. LOOK AT DOOR, you'll see a lock. TELL RATPOUCH TO USE
LOCKPICK ON LOCK.
</P>

<P>
Now you're in the TAIDGH'S HOUSE... LOOK AT APARATUS, USE OIL
BURNER WITH TINDERBOX, USE FLASK ON TAP (it's on the very right side
of the APARATUS).. Go to MIDDLE STREET, and DRINK FLASK.. Enter
THE DOOR, and TALK TO SKORLS.. You'll set the girl free.. Now you
can go and talk to anyone you want, there are many funny situations,
so check'em out, you should talk to Skorls, Luthern, Gwyn, Eilaine,
Ultar, Morkus, Gereint and Grub.. (BUT!! You can't go to the
CASTLE WALL, coz you'll lose the magic..)
</P>

<P>
When you get bored, walk to CASTLE WALL, so you'll turn to DIERMOT
again. Now... TALK TO GOEWNIE, you can find her in APOTHECARY
WORKSHOP. Go to BLACKFRIARS ROW and LOOK AT NOTE. Find MALLIN and
TALK TO him. He'll give you a book, now go to MONKS LODGE and TALK
TO TOBY. GIVE BOOK TO TOBY, he'll tell you how to fight SELENA..
Remeber the INGREDIENTS he'll tell you. Now leave and go to APTH
WORKSHOP. TALK TO GOEWIN, tell her it's for a dragon, but she won't
have COWBANE, leave... And now you have two ways to do it. You can
go and find COWBANE yourself, or TELL RATPOUCH TO GO TO THE FORGE,
AND THEN ASK CATRIONE FOR COWBANE, AND THEN GO TO SMITHY STREET AND
THEN GET COWBANE, FINISH. He'll be back so ASK RATPOUCH FOR
COWBANE, now you got it, so GIVE COWBANE TO GOEWIN. TALK TO GOEWIN,
so she'll give you the potion. Now TALK TO GOEWIN again, leave and
go to SEVERED ARMS, TALK TO ULTAR, go to WEREGATE, TALK TO
GORGOYLES, go to APTH WORKSHOP and TALK TO GOEWIN, she'll meet you
at the gate.. TALK TO GOEWIN. Go inside and play around with the
skulls, you can TELL her to PULL or PUSH skulls. You'll get to the
room with no skulls so save the game before you go ahead.. Now
fight this guy, hope you beat him up... The trick is to
point your mouse on DIERMOT and then.. You'll figure it out after
few times.. Well, you'll see the monster.. USE POTION ON DRAGON,
and then TALK TO DRAGON, commend him to help you, so you'll get an
eye.. Now let him sleep, leave the caves...
</P>

<P>
TALK TO GOEWIN.. Go to THE FORGE and TALK TO LUTHERN, then TALK TO
MELLIN, he'll tell you about the SKORL.. Go to the MARKET PLACE and
when you see Skorl going to VILLAGE SHOP, LOOK THROUGH THE WINDOW,
you'll hear the conversation, Skorl leaves then, TALK TO SKORL,
he'll tell you about the barrel, go to VILLAGE SHOP, TALK TO EWAN...
</P>

<P>
So now, Skorl will take you to THE CASTLE.. LOOK AT CASK, the one
in the left corner, so you'll see the BUNG.. Now go to THE KITCHEN,
GET TONGS, LOOK AT CARCASS, GET FAT, now TALK TO MINNOW, tell him
you've come for Selena, TALK TO him once again, and ask him to tell
his master that someone is in the WINE CELLAR. As soon as he
leaves, go to the left USE TONGS ON BUNG, and hide yourself in the
very right corner of the room. Skorl comes in and sees the wine...
Now go left to THE GATE ROOM and USE FAT ON LEVER, TELL MINNOW TO
OPERATE LEVER, while he does it, PULL WINCH. The gate will open..
Now go back, and make sure to save the game (AGAIN), because you may
have some problems on the bridge.. After you pass him, head to the
left so you'll see Selena.. Now you can have many kids with her.
</P>

<P>
Well, that's it.. The whole thing.. Because the english version was
not complete you can take disk c from german version, and it will
work.
