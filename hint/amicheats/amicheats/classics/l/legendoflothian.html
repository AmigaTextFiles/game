<H2>SOLVE</H2>

<P>
First, visit Larkspur. Take the rope from the girl in the extreme
upper right corner. Then travel to the Lothian castle, where you
should go along the central corridor leading to King Lothian, but go
through the door that leads to the brig instead.
</P>

<P>
Talk to the prisoner standing right next to the bars, and he will
give you a key. Leave the castle and go to Rastun, where you get a
lantern from a man in the upper left corner area (in the mountains).
Next go to Asraela, and take the axe in the hut.
</P>

<P>
Go to the Forlorn castle (enter with the key), and first go to the
garden in the very center of the first floor. Take the rose. Now
you could use the key to go into the dungeon (the treasure there is
the Orb of Sight), but you need only go to the second floor and take
the compass from the man in the observatory. Use it to get to know
coordinates.
</P>

<P>
Finally, talk to Lord Forlorn and say Yes. Leave the castle and go
to Wenhea, where you must give the rose to the pretty girl. She
will give you her mirror in return. Go to the ruins of Heslon (kill
the Medusa with the mirror before entering), and grab the unicorn
with the rope.
</P>

<P>
If your inventory seems full, go back to the Forlorn castle and say
Yes to Lord Forlorn. This will take away the mirror. Otherwise
just go to Marlot, where you should show your gemstone to the man
selling ships (unless you've got 5000 gold to spare!), and he will
give you a ship.
</P>

<P>
Enter the ship. There's no need to visit Trubly, but you should go
to the mountain cave instead. Enter with the lantern and find the
wizard. Talk to him and he will give you an amulet. Use it.
</P>

<P>
Then go to the magic tree, possibly visiting any shrines along the
way. The chant for the Shrine of Protection is "SUKANG" and the one
for the Shrine of Might is "JINSOM". You can now safely walk along
the marsh, thanks to the amulet. Chop the tree with the axe, and go
to the Forlorn castle one last time.
</P>

<P>
Give Lord Forlorn all he wants, and he will give you a horn. Go
back to your ship and go to the evil castle, which you enter with
the horn. Now take a good look at a map (or draw one of your own)
and memorise the traps. They take away 1...7 health points a time
if you set them off. To progress, you must set at least some traps
off. NEVER SAVE A GAME WHEN YOU ARE ON A TRAP!
</P>

<P>
Find the stairs and descend. Now find the potion and get it, but
don't drink it yet. Instead go to the evil sorcerer. Drink the
potion (this will cure all your wounds) and talk to the sorcerer.
Kill him and take the spellbook that is left.
</P>

<P>
Go back to your ship, sail to the Lothian castle and enter. Go to
King Lothian and use the spellbook on him.
