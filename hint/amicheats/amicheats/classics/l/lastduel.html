<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Journey light years away, if you dare, to two warring planets.
Double trouble on a grand cosmic scale. The worlds are anticipating
your arrival. Their fate is totally in your hands. Save the queen.
Crush the Galden uprise and return control of the planet to its
peace-loving inhabitants. The fighting will be fierce, deadly,
incredibly fast and furious. You may not survive. Accept this
assignment only at extreme risk. Fight your way through 6
increasingly challenging levels of confrontations. Attack 3-headed
monsters, aliens with ultra-powered laser weapons. Blast your way
through a mad maze of intrigue, Galden's Route, a black hole where
nothing escapes. An extraterestrial S.O.S. has reached Earth.
Will you respond?
</P>
