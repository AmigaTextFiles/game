<TT>

<H2>SOLVE</H2>

<H3>TREEHOUSE</H3>

<P>
We start off as Brandon the grandson of... your grandfather. Pick
up the garnet (red jewel) on the table. Pick up the note from the
table. Pick up the saw from under the table. Click on the big pot
(you get an apple). Leave this place.
</P>

<H3>OUTSIDE: FOREST 1</H3>

<P>
Two screens to the right you will find a pond of (salty) water.
Click on the pond and get a teardrop. Proceed to the right.
</P>

<P>
A leaf should fall and will turn into a (green) peridot. Pick up
the peridot. (On your way around this place, you will find an
Amethyst. If you do find it, pick it up also. It's a purple
jewel.)
</P>

<P>
After you pick up the peridot, go up and then left. Here is the
Forest Altar. Pick up a lavender rose here. Go to the right. (The
Amethyst usually appears here.) Let's proceed back. Go left, left,
down, left, left, left, left.
</P>

<P>
Here lies a half-dead willow tree. Use the teardrop on the willow.
Merith comes a long at this moment and asks you if you want to play.
Merith has the marble so follow him to the right. Follow Merith
until he has disappeared.
</P>

<P>
Go to the south. Go south again and then to the left. There's
Herman. He tends this bridge, which is now broken. Talk to Herman.
Give your saw to Herman.
</P>

<P>
Leave the cave to the right and go north and north again. Go all
the way to the left until you can no longer proceed that way. Now
go up and enter the church building.
</P>

<P>
Brynn enters the room. Talk to Brynn. Give Brynn the note. She
will decipher it for you. Give Brynn the lavender rose. You now
have a silver rose. Leave this place and go south.
</P>

<P>
Go all the way to the right and then up. Merith should be here.
Just watch. Pick up the marble when Merith is gone. Go to your
right.
</P>

<P>
Here is the forest altar. Use the marble on the altar. Use the
silver rose on the altar. You now have the amulet.
</P>

<P>
Now go left and all the way south and then left again. You're back
in the cave, and by this time, Herman should have fixed up the
bridge. Now you can cross the bridge safely.
</P>

<H3>AREA 2: FOREST 2</H3>

<P>
Once across the bridge, proceed to your left. Enter the hut.
</P>

<P>
Talk to Darm the wizard. He will tell you to find a quill for him.
Leave the hut and go south.
</P>

<P>
This is a small forest and is a near quadilateral shape so it is not
hard to find your way around. During your exploration, you will
find certain gems and jewels. It would be convenient to put these
in front of the golden plate altar once your inventory is full.
</P>

<P>
Look for three items. An acorn (on a tree), a walnut and a
pinecone. Once you have found these items, go to the screen (at the
bottom of the area) where there is a hole in the ground. Drop these
three nuts into the hole. A Pseudobushiahugiflora will appear and
will give you the first stone to your amulet. It allows you to have
the power of healing.
</P>

<P>
Now go north a few screens until you see a bird nest with a bird on
it. Click on the yellow stone on your amulet. Pick up the quill.
</P>

<P>
Go back to the hut and give the quill to Darm. In return, he will
give you a magical scroll. You can try this scroll out if you wish.
Once you have the scroll, Darm will tell you about the birthstones.
The first birthstone you seek is at the fountain in the river.
</P>

<P>
Go to the river and click at the bottom of it. Voila, a SUNSTONE.
During your exploration around this forest, you should have found
quite a few gems and jewels. (i.e. Onyx, Topaz, Opal) Anyhow, the
other three birthstones you need are in order: (SUNSTONE) GARNET,
TOPAZ, and RUBY.
</P>

<P>
To get rubies, grab a few from the ruby tree. Use the yellow stone
on your amulet after you've gotten your rubies. Once you have all
the right stones and have placed them in order, you will get a
flute.
</P>

<P>
Now go to the bottom right screen of the forest. Here is the
entrance to the fiery dragon cave. Let's go in.
</P>

<P>
Well, here's ol' Malcolm trying to stop you. Once he throws one of
his knives at you, throw it back at him. Malcolm will chicken out
but he shields the cave now. Here's your chance to use your flute.
</P>

<P>
NOTE: Before you enter the cave, make sure you have some empty
slots in your pockets. You will no longer need the flute nor the
note. Nor do you need any gems. Drop the apple outside of the
cave. So you should only have a scroll when you enter the cave.
</P>

<P>
Enter the cave.
</P>

<H3>IN THE LABYRINTH</H3>

<P>
The Labyrinth is pretty deep and dark. If you wish to explore this
labyrinth on your own, you can draw a grid map for yourself. It'd
make it a lot easier.
</P>

<P>
Here I will just direct you through the labyrinth from the cave
entrance where there is a pond of water:
</P>

<P>
Go right. Go right. (Gate will close behind you) Go right. Pick
up three fireberries here from the bush. Go up. Drop a fireberry

</P>

<P>
You have now reached the Cavern of Twilight. Pick up the gold coin
and the rock at the right of the screen.
</P>

<P>
Go right. Pick up three fireberries. Go right. Drop a fireberry

</P>

<P>
Go up. Drop a fireberry here. Go right. Pick up two fireberries.
Go right. Drop a fireberry here. Go up. Pick up the rock. Drop a
fireberry here.
</P>

<P>
You should now have five rocks, two emeralds, a gold coin and a
scroll. Now return to the gate.
</P>

<P>
To make your life easier, go: down, left, left, down, down, left,
up, left, down, left, down, right, down, left, left, left, up, up,
up, right, up, up, left, left, left, down, left, down, down, down,
left, up, up, left, down, left.
</P>

<P>
Okay. Put all the rocks on the counterweight thing. The gate
opens. Let's get out of here. Go to the (wishing) well. Drop in
the golden coin. Et voila, you have a moonstone. Let's go back
into the cave, and into the Pantheon of Moonlight.
</P>

<P>
To make your life easier again, start at the gate and go: right,
up, right, down, down, right, up, up, right, up, right, right.
</P>

<P>
Here we are at the Pantheon of Moonlight again. Use the moonstone
in the altar. It should fit nicely. Now the two purple wisps will
combine into one and combine with you. You now have a purple stone
in your amulet. Eager to find out what the purple stone does? Save
it and see. Click on the purple stone. Your are now a ball of
(purple) moonlight.
</P>

<P>
Travel: right, right, right, right, down, down, left, down, left,
down, right, right, right, right, down, right.
</P>

<P>
Here we are. You're at a river of fire. Now I'm going to let your
worry about your inventory. When you run out of room, drop an item
somewhere, but make sure you can find it at your convenience.
</P>

<P>
Go to your right two screens. You will be clobbered by a tree.
</P>

<P>
You will wake up in Zanthia's home. After a brief conversation, she
will tell you to fetch magic water. Pick up the empty bottle. Go
left three screens.
</P>

<P>
Here you meet Malcolm. Malcolm has taken a magic lamp (or whatever)
from the fountain. You have to get it back.
</P>

<P>
I think you go all the way down, one screen to the left, and a few
screens up. You should find a place on fire. If you are not in the
right place, find it yourself.
</P>

<P>
Once you find this place, use your magical scroll once more. This
will be the last time you use this scroll so you can throw it away
if you like.
</P>

<P>
Get the lamp and find your way back. Use the lamp on the magical
fountain and get some water. Drink it. You now have a blue stone
in your amulet. Get some more magic water. Go three screens to
your right to Zanthia.
</P>

<P>
Give Zanthia the magic water. Another brief conversation with
Zanthia and she'll tell you to gather some blueberries.
</P>

<P>
Go two screens to the left. Here would be a great place to drop
items which you might need later. Such as the emeralds, gems,
jewels.
</P>

<P>
Blueberries are: extreme South, extreme Right, Up, right, up.
Somewhere there. It shouldn't be too hard to find. Get one
blueberry, it's all you need.
</P>

<P>
Go back to Zanthia and she'll probably tell you to get some fresh
blueberries. Go get another blueberry. Come back to Zanthia and
she should be gone. Put the blueberry in the pot. The liquid
should turn bluish.
</P>

<P>
Here are the potions which you want to make ----- Amount
</P>

<P>
(BLUE) SAPPHIRE + (BLUE) BLUEBERRIES = BLUE POTION - 1<BR>
(RED) RUBY + (RED) EXOTIC FLOWERS = RED POTION ----- 2<BR>
(YELLOW) TOPAZ + (YELLOW) TULIP = YELLOW POTION ---- 1
</P>

<P>
Go get your sapphire, rubies, tulip, topaz, apple and rose back in
forest 2. You need the apple & rose for later on in the game. Even
though you've used the jewelry, they should reappear.
</P>

<P>
Make sure to click on the purple stone before you re-enter the cave.
Once in the cave. Go all the way down and all the way to the left.
Get the items
</P>

<P>
To get the EXOTIC FLOWER go back to Zanthia's place and click on the
carpet. You've discovered a secret doorway. Go in.
</P>

<H3>AREA 4: FOREST 4</H3>

<P>
Well, the exotic flower, should be to the NORTH EAST. (UP AND
RIGHT). The exotic flowers are on a beach where there are two
golden unicorns at the side of a chopper landing place. Pick one
up.
</P>

<P>
Go and mix your potions now. Once you have a blue potion, a yellow
potion, and 2 red potions. Go through the secret doorway again.
</P>

<P>
From here, go: 2 screens down, 1 screen left, 2 screens down, 1
screen right, 1 screen up.
</P>

<P>
You should now be at a place where there are two big green crystal
towers.
</P>

<P>
MIX BLUE POTION WITH RED POTION. Result = magical purple potion.
</P>

<P>
MIX RED POTION WITH YELLOW POTION. Result = magical orange potion.
</P>

<P>
These are all the potions you need throughout the rest of the game.
If you want to play around with the other potions such as the Go
back to Zanthia's place. From there, go to the fountain. Go down
and to the left. The grail should be floating in the air here.
Click on the blue stone.
</P>

<P>
Hmmm... you didn't quite get the grail did you? Let's go 1 screen
to the right. Click on the door.
</P>

<P>
Drink the purple potion. You're inside. The pipsqueak wants
something good. So why not a rotten apple? Give the pipsqueak the
apple.
</P>

<P>
Go outside and get the royal chalice. Once you have the royal
chalice, let's go to the chopper landing site. (You know, the one
with the two gold unicorn statues.)
</P>

<P>
Once you are there, drink the orange potion.
</P>

<P>
IMPORTANT NOTE: Make sure you have the following before you drink
the orange potion: the key, one lavender rose, the royal chalice.
</P>

<H3>CASTLE LAND</H3>

<P>
Once you reach the island, go to the right. Put the rose on the
grave. Your mother will appear (as a ghost). She will speak cast
stone of your amulet. The red one.
</P>

<P>
Go one screen to the right. Go right again to the castle. Click on
the red stone. Use the key in the keyhole. You're in.
</P>

<H3>IN THE CASTLE</H3>

<P>
Once in the castle, Malcolm will welcome you inside. Go right. Go
up. Go left. In the foyer, go to the second door to your right.
Go right.
</P>

<P>
You're in the kitchen. Pick up the sceptre. Leave the kitchen.
</P>

<P>
In the foyer again, go the the second door to your left. Go left
into the library.
</P>

<P>
Pull out the following books: "O" pal, "P" otions, "E" nchantment,
"N" ature.
</P>

<P>
Get the crown. Go upstairs. Go left. Go up. Here you should meet
Herman. Click on the yellow stone on your amulet. Go left. Pick
up the mallet, and play - DO FA MI RE (green, white, gold, blue.)
</P>

<P>
Get the key from the safe. Go back downstairs and to the big door.
Use the gold key in the door. Go to the library and step into the
half circle.
</P>

<P>
The trap door turns and you're into the catacombs. Find your way to
the green force field. Click on the blue stone on your amulet. Go
up. Go left and left.
</P>

<P>
Click on the false stone on the ground. Pick up the key. Leave the
catacombs and go back to the big door. Use the key in the door. Go
