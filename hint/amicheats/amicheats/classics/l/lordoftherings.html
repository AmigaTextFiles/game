<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Based on the classic Tolkien saga, this is the first in a trilogy of
games. Combining the elements of graphic adventure and role playing,
it uses full-screen, top-down graphics, a point-and-click interface,
an off-line paragraph system, and four-directional scrolling to
maneuver players through the seven map world of Middle Earth.
Primarily a game of exploration and information gathering, combat
always remains an option, as Middle Earth is inhabited by orcs,
wargs, dark riders, and a whole cast of Tolkien monsters. Starting
out as Frodo, the hobbit, players can recruit characters to join
their party as they progress through the game.

<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
Explore the SHIRE (starting point) Completley. There are items in
this area the you will need later in the game.
</P>

<P>
If the game tells you there is a chest in a room, use the SKILL
picklock, to open it. PIPIN TOOK has this skill.
