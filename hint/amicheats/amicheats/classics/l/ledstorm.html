<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Enter the world of L.E.D. Storm, a world like no other. If you're
looking for a yellow brick road, dream on. This is a land of evil
robots, rabid wolves, dark tunnels, cars packed with TNT, narrow
roads and deep drop-offs. Test yourself and your nerve through 9
challenging stages of realism, on a roadway elevated high above the
ground. Synthesized music heightens the drama and the excitement.
Pick up energy boosters along the way for extra fuel and to shield
you from enemy attack. Don't bother to check the weather map. Dark
clouds and storms are moving in fast.

<H2>CHEATS</H2>

<P>
When the title screen appears, try typing one of these:
</P>

<P>
"AMIGADAVIDBROADHURSTWANTSTOCHEAT"<BR>
"AMIGA DAVID BROADHURST WANTS TO CHEAT"<BR>
"DAVID BROADHURST WANTS TO CHEAT" (put two spaces between the
second and third words)
</P>

<P>
For the one that works a message flashes saying "Cheat mode active"
and "Hello to Carol...". This makes your energy/fuel deplete much
slower making it much easier to complete the levels.
