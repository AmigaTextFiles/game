<H2>LEVEL CODES</H2>

<P>
The codes actually form a sentence which is reversed and split to
form the level codes. The sentence is "Ooer sounds a bit rude
missus". So enter these level codes:
</P>

<P>
1- "SUSS"<BR>
2- "IMED"<BR>
3- "URTI"<BR>
4- "BASD"<BR>
5- "NUOS"<BR>
6- "OOER" or "EROO"
</P>

<H2>CHEATS</H2>

<P>
On the high score table, enter "ILLBEBACK". This will give you
infinite lives and let you choose levels with 'F1-F6'.
</P>

<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
To kill the Dragon throw a smoke bomb under him.
</P>

<P>
If you want to have a better bushido, attack the enemies with the
same weapons they use or without weapon.
</P>

<P>
Before you begin your quest to confront the evil Kunitoki for the
third and possibly final time, take it easy and practice moving your
on-screen Ninja around the screen. Sure, this mysterious assassin
dressed in black is exceptionally adaptable and agile but he can be
a bit fiddly to control at times. Better to make those embarrassing
moves now, before the real action begins.
</P>

<P>
In particular, somersaulting and turning on the fly will prove
essential later on. If you can't handle a nifty hop skip and a
jump, you can forget it. Please remember that plenty of Bushido
power is needed in order to complete the game. Taking on and
defeating an opponent with the correct weapon will substantially
increase your rating.
</P>

<P>
Shuriken throwing stars are probably the most devastating weapon,
try to get close to your target before using them. If you're
feeling a bit hard, more Bushido power is awarded to a Ninja warrior
who uses hand-to-hand combat to tackle an armed enemy. Stealth is
important but don't take it too far.
</P>

<P>
Cowards, on the other hand, will lose this essential source of power
if they decide to leave a screen without defeating an opponent.
Such dishonour in real life would have resulted in instant death!
</P>

<H2>SOLVE</H2>

<H3>LEVEL 1</H3>

<P>
Pick up the leather glove on the first screen and rooftilers nails
from outside a group of huts to make a climbing glove, then climb up
the cliff to get the glass lamp. This restores your energy to a
full whack and allows you to pick up some gunpowder. Leaving the
empty lamp, climb back down and collect some gunpowder to join with
the lamp and build a bomb.
</P>

<P>
Pick up two branches and the chain to make the nunchukas. Collect
the sword, extra life, shuriken and piece of bark. Now climb back
up the cliff and go to the screen with the rock. Drop your bomb
next to the rock to create a huge explosion which fills the gap
directly below.
</P>

<P>
Climb back down and collect the end of level scroll lying behind the
rock. Go to the end of level boss and defeat him using your sword.
Exit through the doors.
</P>

<H3>LEVEL 2</H3>

<P>
The sword, piece of bark, nunchukas and shurikens are still in your
possession. Collect the rope to climb down near the wall plant.
</P>

<P>
Release a lily pad from the reeds using your sword, then hop skip
and jump onto and over the lily pad. Collect the bellows, extra
life and end of level scroll. Hop skip and jump back over the lily
pad to the next end of level guardian. Give him a good kickin' and
leave via the doorway.
</P>

<H3>LEVEL 3</H3>

<P>
Bellows are added to your collection of objects saved from the first
level. Collect a plug then drop it into the whirlpool to stop the
waterfall. Pick up a shuriken, extra life, staff and end of level
scroll.
</P>

<P>
Defeat the inevitable EOL guardian and leave the level by using the
exit revealed when the waterfall stops.
</P>

<H3>LEVEL 4</H3>

<P>
You now own a sword, shurikens, nunchukas, bark, bellows and staff.
Grab the climbing staple, hop skip and jump onto lava platforms to
climb up and collect end of level scroll, extra life, dust mask, key
mould and ingot. Climb back down, hop skip and jump to the left of
this lava.
</P>

<P>
Then, using the strange looking protective mask, enter the room
filled with dust and seize some flux. Go to the platform near the
pouring lava, hold the key mould and perform a pick up action to
gain the key to the gate at the end of level screen. Don't forget
to get rid of the tough guy first though!
</P>

<H3>LEVEL 5</H3>

<P>
After the frolics of level four, you're holding a sword, bark,
nunchukas, shurikens and staff. Steal a piece of cheese and give it
to the mouse, you will be then given the jewelled sword handle.
</P>

<P>
Search for extra energy, an ink pot and vial of life, then find the
climbing staple so that you can get the skull. You must give this
to the statue who will come to life and present you with an end of
level scroll for the portal.
</P>

<H3>LEVEL 6</H3>

<P>
Find the crowbar and the quill. You have a sword, bark, nunchukas,
shurikens and staff. The bark, ink and quill will make a scroll.
Use this to release a spirit from the cockpit of the crashed plane.
</P>

<P>
Make sure you've received the trendy-looking bandana to cross the
barrier before fighting the baddie with the jewelled sword.
</P>
