<P>
Build your castle using five stone and three wood. When it has been
built, extend it for a couple of minutes by way of a few extra
walls, a gate house, and a bit of a moat. Click on End Design, and
demolish it straight away for 65,000 stone and wood.
</P>

<P>
Wait for a merchant to arrive. Sell 100 stone four times, then buy
2,000 of each weapon. Your gold will increase rather than decrease -
and as you can see this is quicker than constantly selling stone or
wood. But don't buy more than 2,500 of each, or you'll start losing
money big time.
