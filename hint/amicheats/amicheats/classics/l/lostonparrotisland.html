<P>
On the title/option screen, type "NOTLOST" and a map screen will
appear. Press the left mouse button and you will appear at the life
boat. Use the life boat to see the ending.

<P>
NOTE: You may have to type "NOTLOST" more than once. Probably
something to do with the fact the game was coded in amos.
