<H2>TIPS</H2>

<H3>GENERAL</H3>

<P>
Save the game before you fight or cross the rivers! (You can
restart after you lost your life or power.)
</P>

<H3>FIGHTING</H3>

<P>
I am not good at things like this so I developed the following.
Enter a screen where there is to be combat. Get in a telling blow
without getting hurt and then back out. Save the game and then
repeat until you kill the guy. If it is a screen where the guy
revives after you leave (yes, it happens alot) don't save it here
but wait for a save screen. I did it this way and won.
</P>
 
<H3>LEVEL 1: The Wastelands</H3>

<P>
Get all the flashing objects. You don't have to kill all the
enemies. However, you must pick things up in order. You don't have
to cross the rivers in this level, you will endup circling around.
</P>

<P>
After you get the sword, numchucks (chained sticks on a dead body),
smoke bomb, key, and a little bag. Then you go to the place where
you found the smoke bomb. The color of the river is red (probably
lava), jump to the upper right corner (you will be at another
screen). Then, you will find the apple (extra life, if you still
have 3 lifes, you will get a total of 4 lifes. Also if you have low
power status, press contrl-H to kill yourself (get the apple first),
then you can get another apple). Later on, you will find the ninja
star (these is limited, save them).
</P>

<P>
When you get to the screen where you see a pink dragon, the only way
to pass this screen is to throw one of your smoke bomb (you must
throw the bomb in front of the dragon), then the dragon will fall to
sleep, walk over and you have passed the first level.
</P>

<H3>LEVEL 2: The Wilderness</H3>

<P>
You have more things to get, I don't think that you can enter the
house in the first screen of the 2nd level. Get the claw in that
screen (it's very small, in front of the stone lion (right side))
</P>

<P>
Later on you will find apples again. When you reach the screen with
a tall cliff, you have to climb up the cliffs (with the claw, of
course). When you get to the screen with a brick wall, climb down
backward. Don't forget to hold the claw.. (Do it on the right side
of the wall, the white part on the bottom of the wall is ok.)
</P>

<P>
Cross the river on the next screen. In this area you find the glove
and ninja magic which makes you flash. Get the glove and then the
magic. Hurry to recross the river, go up and cross the river again.
Hurry, fighting if you have to, and find the two stone dragons, the
second one will fire at you but if you have ninja magic still
working fast enough you can get by. You have passed the 2nd level.
</P>

<H3>LEVEL 3: The Gardens</H3>

<P>
You will find another apple tree, get it. First you have to get a
golden necklace on the budda's neck (where you have to cross the
river through the rocks on the river) This river has a blue dragon,
don't pay any attention to it, it won't fire at you.
</P>

<P>
After you get the thing, go back. Find the flower. Pick up with
flower with your glove. Keep going ahead. When you see a small
river (with no rocks), jump over the river.
</P>

<P>
Later on, you will find a golden Budda Statue, kneel in front of it
with the golden necklace and you have passed level 3.
</P>

<H3>LEVEL 4: The Dungeon</H3>

<P>
This is the fun part with nice graphics, don't even think about
fighting the gaint spider, or killing the ghosts or mice (you don't
have to kill them anyway). The easiest way to kill the skeletons is
to kick them once.
</P>

<P>
Again, find the apple and a rope. Walk around until you find a
chamber with 2 rows of steel rings on the wall (like a ladder), kill
the enemy and climb up with the rope.
</P>

<H3>LEVEL 5: The Palace</H3>

<P>
Get the apple again (This is the last one). On the same screen, use
the key to enter the door. You then want to go left.
</P>

<P>
In this screen, you can get by the guard without fighting and he
will commit hari kari. Sort of neat. You will then be in a room
with a giant statue. Save it here.
</P>

<P>
Get next to the statue and slowy (clinging as closely as possible to
the statue and facing up, toward the statue) work youR way slowly
around the statue. The sword will eject and you will be safe.
</P>

<P>
This next part is crucial in my opinion. Proceed forward to the
next screen and almost (not quite) kill the guy there. Then go back
to the statue screen and go up. (Note if you save the game on the
screen with the statue, you will have to get by the statue again).
In the upper screen, kill the guard and get the Ninja magic. This
is short lived and you have to move quickly. Return to the screen
where you almost killed the guy, finish him off and exit using the
red stairs. If you do not have sufficient magic, you will die on
the stairs.
</P>

<H3>LEVEL 6: The Inner Sanctum</H3>

<P>
This level starts as a hallway in which there are four rooms. The
fourth contains poison (needed later) and the third the passage to
continue. Each room has a guard outside and there is one in the
third room. Trying to figure it out, I found that the level is a
wrap around. Therefore the best way to go on (with the least amount
of fighting) is to exit up the screen instead of down. This puts
you in front of the fourth door.
</P>

<P>
Kill the guard, then go get the poison. Come back and kill the
guard again, go to the third room (exit up), kill the guard, enter
the room and kill the guard. The exit the door way up and hold the
flower. Walk to the last big vase at the end of the room. The
flower will be put in the vase causing a secret passage to be
revealed. SAVE THE GAME.
</P>

<P>
The next part takes practice. Hold the poison bottle and carry no
weapon. In the next room, you see a grey dog, walk slowly and when
the dog wakes up, throw the posion bottle. You must throw it right
in front of the dog. Then you enter another room with a giant
statue with a big arrow . In the upper side of the corridor where
you enter, there is some red (blood?) on the carpet. This is
concealing some ninja magic. Get it and you are by. Don't save it
now, wait for the next screen. There is one guy to kill and then
the master. He is tough (wearing armour) but beatable. Then you
are in the last screen. Save your game.
</P>

<P>
Put away any weapon. There are two squares, you must jump and land
inside the smaller. Then take the scroll and watch the ending.
</P>
