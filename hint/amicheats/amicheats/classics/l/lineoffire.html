<P>
When on the joystick select screen, type in "OPERATION FERRET".
This should give you infinite lives/energy, but if it doesn't work,
try typing it with a full stop at the end. Also, now pressing '0'
to '9' allows you to skip levels.
</P>

<P>
You could also try pressing the 'HELP' key once the game has loaded
for a secret message and now type in "WHAT A BUMMER" for infinite
credits and the level skip.
