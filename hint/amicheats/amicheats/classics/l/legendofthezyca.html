<H3>GENERAL</H3>

<P>
You can only save your game in the temple in the beginning. When
you have reached the holy pagoda, you can find a device that let you
save the game anywhere you like.
</P>

<P>
Don't waste your spell points casting healing spells when you are
near any town. Just save your game in the temple when your hit
points are low. After that go out to get killed (shouldn't be
difficult). The game will be restored when you get killed. Upon
restoring the game, you will be given FULL hit points. This is
useful when you are low in cash and level. Note that poison is not
removed when you restore the game, but there is no need to cast
spell to remove it because the enemies will poison you again and
again.
</P>

<P>
? OPTION: The following action will be executed randomly:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>Stand still doing nothing
<LI>Attack three times
<LI>Restore hit points
<LI>Lose half your hit points
<LI>Execute a special attack with an attack power of 3000
<LI>Half your attack power
<LI>Execute an attack with double your current attack power
</UL>
