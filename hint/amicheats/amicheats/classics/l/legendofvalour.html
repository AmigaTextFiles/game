<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Fantasy becomes reality in Legends of Valour, a single-character
graphic adventure from industry veteran Strategic Simulations, Inc.
Set in the mythical city of Mittledorf, valour vanquishes its
opposition with the smoothest scrolling three-dimensional graphics
ever seen in a fantasy role playing game. Isolated inside the
fortified medieval town, players create their own character by
choosing their appearance, occupation, and lifestyle. Personality
traits such as strenghts, memory, manipulation, health, and appeal
vary with the character's race. After character generation, the
player experiences over 45 exciting quests, each with its own
mysteries, plot, and potential outcomes. The non-linear gameplay
enables the player to explore the 28 square miles of town in any
direction, including numerous shops, taverns, hostles, temples, and
guilds.

<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
Find some treasure and pick it up, then find a person. Throw the
treasure at the person. Now he (or she) will drop a bag of money.
And remember that the persons with the most money are often the
women.
