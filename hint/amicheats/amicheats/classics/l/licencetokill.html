<H2>CHEATS</H2>

<P>
Use 'F8' as a level skipper. This might only work on some of the
early released versions.
</P>

<H2>TIPS</H2>

<H3>LEVEL 1</H3>

<P>
Destroy the escaping jeep as soon as possible. To do this stay in
line with it and point the nose down by accelerating.
</P>

<P>
Remember to stay on the road, otherwise Sanchez's men will get you.
</P>

<H3>LEVEL 2</H3>

<P>
Stay away from the open door by taking cover close to the walls.
</P>

<P>
Running towards the enemy can make them run away, but dosen't get
rid of them altogether.
</P>

<P>
Shooting the oil drums conserves bullets, but keep well back,
because they destroy everything in their vicinity.
</P>

<H3>LEVEL 3</H3>

<P>
To grab the tail of Sanchez's plane, keep away from the clouds and
press the fire button to attach the tow cable. Don't do this until
Bond is close enough, but make sure you fire in advance to allow
reaction time.
</P>

<H3>LEVEL 4</H3>

<P>
Stay under water when boats and snipers are around. Keep a full
tank of oxygen and don't surface unless divers appear. Try to get a
harpoon gun by stabbing one of the divers, and save it for the
arrival of the seaplane, fire the harpoon at it and climb up the
cable.
</P>

<H3>LEVEL 5</H3>

<P>
When you're inside the truck, you'll be under attack from other
vehicles.
</P>

<P>
Trucks can be destroyed by ramming them repeatadly into the
roadside. After a little of this treatment, the trailer is
released. leaving the rig to do the damage, and this must be
knocked out too.
</P>

<P>
Watch out for jeeps, because they carry missiles. Avoid their
firepower by staying out of line, and destroy them by driving over
them.
</P>
