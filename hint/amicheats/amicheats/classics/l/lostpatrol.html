<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Dateline: June 7, 1966. Following a peaceful stint of rest and
recreation in Saigon, a chopper carrying six G.I. grunts and a Staff
Sergeant crashes in the rugged central highlands of Vietnam. The
seven soldiers face a nightmare trek across 57 miles of harsh
terrain, infested with booby traps and enemy forces. With little
food and less ammunition, their chances of reaching a safe haven are
less than slim. So you have to ask yourself. Are you a survivor? As
Sgt. Weaver, your mission is to lead the men to safety. You are in
command.
</P>

<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
Rest for 50 minutes and for no loss of food your strength is
restored by a few points. This restores all of your remaining men
to 99 percent. Keeping up your men's strength and morale is vital.
Giving your men 50 minutes' rest a night, or during the day when
it's too dark to arry on, will slam your energy and morale levels
to max. Even if you don't have much food, you don't have to worry,
as your men will not eat it.
</P>

<P>
On reaching the first village (the first white cross on the map),
search the area to find a hole in the ground where the villagers
appear to be hiding. You then have two options: ENTER TUNNEL or
USE GRENADES. Gomez is useful at this point, but if he is dead, go
for the USE GRENADES option.
</P>

<P>
Start off questioning the villagers normally by aking them "Where
VC?" Once you have an answer, start the hard questioning, or a
village boy will get hold of a gun and shoot one of your men.
