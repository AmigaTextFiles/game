Go East, South, East. Walk up to man, "show man ticket" then go
North, onto the boat.
</P>

<P>
*Boring Sequence*
</P>

<P>
Go East, into your cabin. Walk to the back of the cabin, "get
fruit", walk through door to the East. Don't go near the woman, she
will whip you to death!
</P>

<P>
Go West, back into your cabin, stand behind the closet, "Wear
swimsuit", walk back through door to the East, walk over to the
cabinet (don't get too close to the bed!, "open drawer", "look in
drawer", "get kit", walk through door to your cabin, and leave your
cabin.
</P>

<P>
Go up to the third deck and walk as far East as possible. You'll now
be at the pool. "Use sunscreen" go to the nearest sunbed, "lie
down". Do NOT follow the woman that approaches you.
</P>

<P>
"Stand", walk into the pool, "Swim" (Or you'll drown ) "dive",
swim to the bottom of the pool, "get top", swim back up. Swimming
is easiest with the mouse, clicking on the bottom of the pool every
time his arms point forward. But you'll have to use the keyboard
when you get to the very top. If your not fast enough here your
lungs will explode.
</P>

<P>
Swim to the edge of the pool, "get out", "use sunscreen", leave the
pool and go back to your cabin.
</P>

<P>
When in your cabin, stand behind the closet and "wear suit". Leave
your cabin and walk up to the very top of the boat (The resteraunt).
</P>

<P>
In the resteraunt, walk to the end of the bar and "get dip". Now go
to the far West of the third deck (The barber shop) walk over to the
chair and "Sit".
</P>

<P>
Leave the Barber shop and walk up the stairs to the bridge. Once
there, sneak over behind the captain and "Pull lever". Sneak back
out of the bridge and make your way to one of the lifeboats (The one
to the far left). Stand next to the railings by the boat and "Jump
into boat".
</P>

<P>
As you sail away from the boat do the following: "Use sunscreen",
"Eat dip", "Wear wig" If all goes to plan you should now crash land
on a beach.
</P>

<P>
Go South and you should find yourself in some wilderness, you'll
walk about lost in it for a bit... when you get close enough, "get
flower" from the middle of the screen. Dont worry if you miss it,
you'll get more chances.
</P>

<P>
When the sequence finally ends you'll be in a posh resteraunt. Walk
over to the man and "Talk man". He will tell you to sit and wait,
so walk over to the chair and "sit".
</P>

<P>
Once the Maitre'd has finished seating the other guests you will be
shown your table and given some food. !Do not eat the food! Walk
over to the buffet and "Examine buffet" then walk over to the cheese
and "Take Knife".
</P>

<P>
Now leave the resteraunt and you will find yourself back in the
wilderness, now's the time to get that flower if you missed it.
</P>

<P>
When you've found your way you'll be in a guestroom. "look" to get
your bearings and then walk over to the nightstand and "take
matches" now walk into the bathroom and "take soap" from by the
sink.
</P>

<P>
Leave the Guestroom and after a while you'll find yourself in the
Barbers. Walk over to the chair and "Sit". When he's finished
you'll be a blonde, now leave the shop, bak into the wilderness
where you'll find yourself back on the beach.
</P>

<P>
Go west "look", walk to the far West of the screen and "Get bikini".
Now go East and South back into the wilderness. When you walk into
the resteraunt, just leave again.
</P>

<P>
One in the Guestroom stand in the dressing area behind the bathroom
and "Wear bikini". Now "Put dough in top".
</P>

<P>
Walk South back into the wilderness and you will find yourself in
the Barber shop again, once there walk over to the chair and "sit".
When finished, leave South and you'll end up on the beach. Once on
the beach, walk East and East again.
</P>

<P>
In the next bit you'll have to edge yourway along a cliff face, but
dont worry, you cant fall off even if you try. Try and fall off
really far towards the end to see how far his legs stretch.
</P>

<P>
As you corner the last cliff face type "Wear suit". You'll now find
yourself at the airport.
</P>

<P>
Walk up to the two dancing men and "give man flower" (be careful not
to get too close) O.k, now walk into the airport where you will see
some never ending qeue's, where the qeue you are in will never get
shorter, what fun!
</P>

<P>
Ignore the qeue's and walk off to the West where you will find
another Barber shop. Walk in and up to the lady, "look lady", walk
to the chair and "sit". When finished, leave the barber shop.
</P>

<P>
If you want to see one of the amusing deaths now (I suggest you save
first) sit next to the lady on the chair and then follow her when
she leaves.
</P>

<P>
Assuming that you didn't do this or have loaded your saved game from
outside the barber shop, go East and East again.
</P>

<P>
Walk over to the man and "talk man", he'll ask you for your
passport, "Give man passport". After looking through your
possesions he'll let you through the gate to the East which will
open when you walk up to it. Walk through it and you'll find
yourself in the X-ray room.
</P>

<P>
Now stand next to the conveyor belt and wait for a bag with a bomb
in it to come by, when the bag comes to you, "get bag". You might
also like to get other bag's and see what's in them for fun. If you
dont think you'll be able to spot the bag then just get every bag
that passes you by.
</P>

<P>
Once the automatic sequence is finished, the qeue's will have
cleared. Walk up to the lady and "buy ticket".
</P>

<P>
When the lady has finished, go East and show man passport. Go East
and East again. Walk up to the snack bar and "Buy food" when you
are brought the food "look in food" !!!Dont eat it!!! You'll now
find a pin in the gravy, "take pin". Now walk over to the vending
machines to the East and "Put money in machine" you'll now get a
parachute. Quickly walk up the conveyor belt and after a bit you'll
find yourself in the waiting room. Walk over to the counter and
"get pamphlet" then "give man ticket". Walk on to the plane and
you'll end up in your seat.
</P>

<P>
After takeoff "Get bag", "Give man pamphlet", "stand", walk East to
the back of the plane. Find the emergency door, "Pick lock", "Move
handle", "wear parachute", "open door". You will now be sucked out.
Quickly "open parachute" and you should land on an island.
</P>

<P>
You'll now find yourself hanging from a tree in the parachute, "cut
rope" to free yourself.
</P>

<P>
Now walk over to the stick (North and East a bit) and "Get stick".
</P>

<P>
The next bit is dangerous, in fact, this whole island is, so be very
careful and save lots.
</P>

<P>
There is a hive of killer bees on the small tree to the south. Walk
over to it and "crawl" then exit South. (Or dont and see what
happens.) (By the way, did you notice anything about that rock you
just passed?)
</P>

<P>
In the next bit there is a snake in the tree so walk up to the
branch and just as it is about to attack you "Use stick". (Or don't
and see what happens.) When you have done this walk off the screen to
the South East.
</P>

<P>
The next screen is a swamp. Follow the dry path on the swamp (the
path actually looks more like a reflection than a path) or jump into
the swamp and see what happens. (This bit is best done with the
mouse.)
</P>

<P>
This next screen is really fun, save the game and then try walking
through the river. However, if you don't want to die then the way
to do it is to swing from the vines. Walk over to the far right and
next to the water of the bank you are on and type grab vine. You
will swing across, then, quickly type it again (Or press F3) to grab
the next one, do this until you reach the edge. Now walk up to the
tree and "get vine". Now exit the screen to the East.
</P>

<P>
*Automatic Mode*
</P>

<P>
When the sequence is finished you'll be standing next to a chasm
with a tree on the other side. Go South, then East, walk over to
the burnt out fire and "get ashes" now go back to the chasm and
stand right next to the edge, now "throw vine" you'll get to the
other side.
</P>

<P>
Now go North until you reach the edge of the volcano, covered in
ice. Stand next to the edge where the ice slopes up and "use ashes"
Once past the ice, walk up to the very top of the volcano.
</P>

<P>
Ok, now stand very close to the hole in the volcano (not too close
though or you'll fall in) "Put bag in bottle" "light bag" "drop
bottle".
</P>

<P>
The elevator door will now open, so walk in.
</P>
