<H2>CHEATS</H2>

<P>
Load in several of the players that come pre-rolled on the disk, and
load an original of your own. Go sell all their equipment, have
them withdraw all monies from the bank, and transfer to you.
Create new characters and do the same as often as you need, and
you'll have plenty of gold to properly outfit your stalwart band.
