<P>
On mission one, just before you rescue the first captive, save the
game. Now, as soon as you have rescued him and moved on to mission
2, reload the game and rescue him again. Now, when you finish the
level you`ll be on level three. Redo this until you are on the
level you desire.
</P>

<P>
If you hang on to the data crystal after the first mission, you can
use it to find other captives on the other missions without hunting
for clues.
