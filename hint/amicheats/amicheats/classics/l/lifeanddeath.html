<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
You are the surgeon! Talk with your patient, read charts, order
x-rays, ultrasound, blood tests and other lab work. Make decisions
that determine whether your patient lives or dies. In the operating
room, your skill with the scaplel while monitoring on-screen EKG,
pulse, blood pressure and other vital signs will determine whether
your patient goes to recovery... or the morgue!
</P>

<H2>TIPS</H2>

<H3>APPENDECTOMY</H3>

<P>
Here's how to perform an appendectomy - don't try this at home!
</P>

<P>
Having successfully diagnosed the patient as suffering from
appendicitis, on entering the operating theatre, the first job is to
wash your hands and put on your rubber gloves.
</P>

<P>
Now clean the area with the antiseptic (the skin's colour is
lightened as a result), and place the drape over the top left corner
of the patient's abdomen. Dose the victim up with antibiotics and
put some blood on the Intravenous Drip.
</P>

<P>
Now comes the fun. With the skin all germ-free, pick up the scapel
and make an incision from the top left of the area to the bottom
right, ensuring that the cut is kept as straight as possible. As it
starts to bleed, clamp the bleeding areas with the scissor-like
clamps and cauterise them with the tool provided (assuming that you
know what tools do what, if not look at the manual).
</P>

<P>
Clean away the blood with the sponge and pull the skin apart with
the retractor. The muscle layer below is now revealed. Now repeat
the incision and blood-stemming as before.
</P>

<P>
The next layer contains no blood, so hack and slash it back.
Following that is the transverse muscle layer - this has to be cut
from top-right to bottom-left. Retract this and you should see the
Cecum.
</P>

<P>
Next, scrape a little fat away from the top-left area using the
scalpel, but be careful not to cut it. Now raise the area with a
clamp and use the scalpel to make a tiny cut. Cut along the
left-hand side of the Cecum in a top-left to bottom-right incision,
ensuring once again to keep it straight. As it opens up, take a
sample of the liquid that can be seen inside, then use suction to
get rid of it. Now raise the Cecum using the hand icon and pack the
gap with your gauze. This reveals the appendix.
</P>

<P>
Click on the appendix with the hand icon to raise it. The next
thing you should do is take the gauze from the top tray (it looks
like a toilet roll) and drop it under the appendix to prevent it
from falling back into its usual hole. Be careful not to slash
anything as you'll get poison everywhere, kill the patient, and ruin
your overalls.
</P>

<P>
Grab hold of the side of the appendix with the hand icon and click
twice to extend it. Grab the forceps with your shaking hand and
click on the extended appendix. Even a skilful surgeon needs a
couple of attempts to find the right location. Don't worry if you
miss, the patient's anaesthetised, so he won't mind.
</P>

<P>
Plant a clamp at either end of the mesoappendix artery. Clip a hole
in the upper-middle of the appendix. Sew in a suture in the hole.
Place a clamp at the top and cut where the forceps meet the
appendix.
</P>

<P>
If you're lucky the appendix should be out and the patient should
survive. Slap the organ in the middle to invert the stump which
used to be attached to the appendix. Sew in a suture here and you
can start to stitch the hole up.
</P>

<P>
Once you've cleared up, use the retractor to release the various
layers of pinned-back fat and skin. Sew up each layer except the
last. Skin clips have been use to prevent scarring.
</P>

<P>
If you're feeling mean you could always switch the anaesthetic off
before the patient wakes up. Don't forget to remove all
clamps/forceps/scalpels/ digital watches before closing your patient
up.
</P>
