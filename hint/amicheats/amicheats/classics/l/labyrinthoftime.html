<H2>SOLVE</H2>

<P>
The game begins in the subway car and all you have in your inventory
is a single quarter. Don't use this coin in anything other that the
pay phone at the end of the hall in the 50's Diner on the upper
level. Got that? Good. When wandering around the various levels and
areas of this game, click the eye icon on the various walls and
lights etc., there are some very nice pics in this game.
</P>

<H3>BEGINNING</H3>

<P>
You'll begin the game in a subway car on the middle level. You can
exit the middle level in one of three ways; by using the elevator in
the hotel, by falling through the city street when you cross against
the red light which is through the south exit door in the subway, or
by the stairs which you will come to after making your way through
the MEDIEVAL MAZE. As the exit door to the south of the subway car
is secured all you can do is bravely exit the subway car by the west
exit and walk into the hotel.
</P>

<P>
When you first enter the hotel there will be two doors, one you can
open and one is locked. Go into the one you can open and have a look
around. Nothing of importance happens here, but it is worth checking
out. You will go back to the locked one later, when you find the
key.
</P>

<P>
The only other room of interest is Number 14, the other rooms you
can't enter anyway as they have do not dirturb signs on them. This
is the room with the wardrobe in it (which is locked) and the key to
it is located in the western town on the upper level. There is one
other door you can enter on this level, which is the door to the
mirror maze which is located across from the elevator which is in
the south hallway of the hotel.
</P>

<P>
For now we will go to the western town and get the key for the
wardrobe. To get to the western town, go up in the elevator. The
door you see straight ahead of you goes to the theatre, go through
there for now and walk through the balcony section and out the other
exit this will take you to a wall.
</P>

<P>
Notice the slider puzzle on the wall, the correct alignment for the
slider pieces is located in the construction site at the end of the
hedge maze on the upper level. When you eventually find this area
you will line up the pieces in the right sequence and the wall will
open.
</P>

<P>
Now go back to the lobby by the elevator, the door to the detectives
office is locked, you will get this key later. Now turn right. you
will be facing south at this point, walk through the doorway and
down the hallway. As you exit the hallway, notice the temple
floating in the air, this is your ultimate objective. At this point
turn right and head,across the crystal cliffs, through the cave
entrance and down the tunnel. At the end of the tunnel turn left and
go through the multi-colored doorway into the railway car.
</P>

<P>
Have a look around the railway car and the town. The locked door at
the west end of the railway car is never opened, I never found a key
for it. The door at the east end of the railway car gives you
another view of your objective. The only places of importance are
the newspaper office, the sheriff's office and the mine tunnel.
</P>

<P>
Nip into the sheriff's office and open the drawer on the desk, look
in the drawer and take the brass key inside. Oh, and while you're
here, pop into the saloon and grap the bottle of whiskey, you can
take a drink from it periodically if you wish.
</P>

<P>
Now head back to room 14 in the hotel when you are finished
exploring. Open the wardrobe, look inside and take the journal and
the card. The journal has an interesting story in it and will later
reveal a clue when you have accomplished a couple of tasks, more on
that later. The card is used to turn on the various teleporters in
the game. For now we will head for a teleporter which is located at
the end of the mirror maze.
</P>

<H3>MIRROR MAZE</H3>

<P>
Go to the doorway across from the elevator and walk inside, now go
through the insanely laughing clowns mouth and follow the map below.
</P>

<P>
When you get to Morgan in the centre of the maze, do not use your
quarter in him unless you save your game first. If you put your
quarter in before saving your game, he will tell you, "You will wish
you had that coin back" and then you will have to start over as you
can not finish the game without that quarter. So save your game
first and then plunk in your quarter and watch the animation.

<P>
Once you make it through the maze you can use the cardkey in the
teleporter slot, After using the cardkey you must press one of the
buttons to teleport. The green button will teleport you to the
library, the blue button to the museum.
</P>

<H3>MUSEUM</H3>

<P>
Pressing the blue button takes you to the museum where you should
pick up the alien belt (I never found a use for this, outside of the
fact it flashes). There are also three levers here, pulling the
levers will place or remove bridge sections, they are also used in
conjunction with some other levers later in the game.
</P>

<P>
Pulling the left lever will remove a bridge section from the mine
and the one under the subway causing the subway car to be crushed
but don't despair as it can be 'pumped up' with the bicycle pump
which is found in a toolbox at the construction site on the upper
level after you solve the slider puzzle. You have to crush the
subway anyway to get an item you need. After the car has been
crushed and you pump it up, check out the legs sticking out from
under the subway car, it ain't Kansas anymore. Also as I mention
later in the solve, I have played two complete games and one time
the subway was crushed and one time it was not. I'm assuming that
pushing the left lever back up causes the subway car to be crushed
as you replace the bridge section when you do this and it is sitting
on top of the subway car. When you leave here make sure all levers
are down.
</P>

<P>
Next press the green button to teleport to the library, the orange
button takes you back to the control room. The cave and the
mountain road can be reached by teleporting from the southern-most
room of the library. The first time you exit the cave and walk
across the road, you will narrowly dodge the falling rocks and they
won't injure you. However, to cross back you must be wearing the
helmet which is found in the south-east corner of the medieval maze.
You will not be able to pass the rocks if you aren't wearing the
helmet. Safety first.
</P>

<H3>CRETAN PALACE</H3>

<P>
After crossing the mountain road and dodging the falling rocks you
will be facing east in a Cretan hall. Walk down the hallway and go
through the doorway. You will be in another Cretan hall, there are
two exits from this hall. If you turn left you will end up on a
bridge platform, this is were you will cause pieces of a bridge to
appear to get to the doorway in the temple. For now turn right and
go through the doorway, you will be in the Cretan Palace, have a
quick wander round and take the Labrys which you can find in the
central room inside the large circular well. Also note the design
on the door in the palace, you need to place an artifact there from
King Minos tomb. Below is map of palace.

<P>
After getting the helmet make your way to the upper level and the
50's diner through the northwest exit from the maze.
</P>

<H3>50's DINER</H3>

<P>
Upon exiting the Medieval Maze you will be in a wierd cave, go
through the doorway in front of you. After climbing the stairs, the
first object you'll find is a can of paint. This is very important
so be sure to take it.
</P>

<P>
Now turn to your right and enter the diner. Have a look around
check things out but do not use your quarter in the jukebox. After
checking out the diner exit it were the sign is for the telephone
and head down the hall to the pay phone (another view of the
Temple), drop your quarter in the slot on top of the phone. After
inserting the coin in the slot, thirteen coins will fall onto the
stool underneath the pay phone.
</P>

<P>
Pick up the quarters. Use a coin on the jukebox, and get the silver
key from the coin return. After retrieving the silver key, go back
to the pay phone and put a quarter in the coin slot for the pay
toilet. Now enter the hedge maze.

<P>
After dashing through this maze you'll enter a construction site.
Take the screwdriver lying on the workhorse and jote down the
numbers on the west wall. These numbers are the solution to the
theatre slider puzzle.
</P>

<P>
You also have the silver key, it's now time for a long walk back to
the detective's office on the middle floor. On the way through the
Mirror maze you can plunk some quarters into Morgan and he will give
you some advice in the form of riddles. See below.

</UL>

<P>
Use the silver key to open the detectives door and take the iron key
which will open the jail cell in the sheriff's office. I never
found a use for the Falcon statue or the notes.
</P>

<P>
Just hang onto the key for the jail cell right now as you do not
really need it until later on near the end of the game, but if you
want you can check out the jail cell and get the gun under the
blanket. The gun is never used in the game. You can also do this
later near the end of the game.
</P>

<P>
So where to next? Go to the slider puzzle on the wall outside the
theatre, and line up the slider puzzle like it was on the wall in
the construction site. Ah, forgot to write it down did you, here it
is.
</P>

<PRE>7  2  9  10

<P>
Once you solve the puzzle the wall will open reveailing another
entrance to the construction site. Look inside the toolbox to get
the gold key and the bicycle pump. Never got the spigot to turn in
the keg.
</P>

<P>
Once you have the golden key you can open the locked door in the
hotel across from the washroom. Note the door in the rock wall with
the combination lock. In the servant's room note the message on the
wall.
</P>

<P>
There is a blank sheet of paper in the closet which you must use
with the printing press in the western town on the upper level. I
never found a use for the broom, bucket or teapot. Once you have
printed the newspaper, return it to the servant's room and place it
underneath the sign on the wall. Also while you are in the Western
Town, go into the mine and push the mine cart down the tracks, it
will crash through the door as the bridge section has been removed
by pulling the left lever down in the Museum. While there get the
lantern behind the door and you can get the sword in the stone if
you want and become the King of England. I never found a use for
it.
</P>

<H3>SURREAL MAZE</H3>

<P>
Next you're going to need the shirt so return to the subway car and
pump it up with the bicycle pump. Hm, I re-played this game as I
wrote the solve to make sure it was correct and the subway car was
not crushed. There was still some legs sticking out from under the
subway car, but this time there was a different message when you
looked at the legs. With the subway car crushed and pumped back up
the message said "You don't seem to be in Kansas anymore". This
time the message was "You wonder if Minos will get your little dog
to". The only thing I can remember doing different in the museum
was to leave all three levers pulled down. My original game I did
not leave all three levers down, also if you pull the left lever
down and then push it back up you will see the bridge section lying
on the crushed subway. Though this could be what crushes the
subway, by pushing the lever back up the bridge section does in the
subway.
</P>

<P>
Once the subway car is restored go south to the locked door. The
door can be opened by unscrewing the screw in the latch with the
screwdriver and then taking out the screw. Once you remove the
screw you can open the door and enter the city streets. If you
still have a quarter left you can buy a newspaper, but I never found
a use for it. Nor did I ever find any keys for the doors on the
street. Actually all you can do is walk down the street and attempt
to cross the intersection. Whereupon you fall down to the bottom of
a well. Now walk ahead and you will be in the main room in the
Surreal maze. You will be facing the chair and the TV. Follow the
directions below exactly and you will make it to the Ziggurat.
</P>

<P>
Okay go S,S,S,S,S,W,W,W,S.
</P>

<P>
On the third south you will be in the main room again, but that is
okay, after all it is a surreal maze, on the fifth south you should
be in the room with the red brick wall and pulsating black doorway.
Also the frame around the doorway should be wood curved at the top.
When you turn to the west you should be facing the stone doorway
with the curved top. After three wests you should be back in the
red brick room facing the stone doorway. Now if you did it
correctly turn and enter the Ziggurat. If it didn't work try it
again. This is the most reliable way I found to find the Ziggurat.
</P>

<P>
Now head west and go up the stairs and push the column you find
there. After the column is moved it will open the two doors halfway
down the stars. Go down the stairs and enter the lefthand door.
Hm, kind of dark, time to turn on that lantern, and follow map
below. For now do not move the red switch as you will be teleported
after moving any switches in the Ziggurat and you might as well have
the shirt with you. The three switches you find here operate
different parts of the bridge in conjunction with the ones in the
museum. So go to the yellow lever pick up the dirty shirt and push
the lever. Also on the map were it shows there is an entrance to
another room, I never got in there. If you left any of the two
right levers in the museum up, not sure which one there will be a
bridge section leaning against the wall.

<P>
You will now find yourself on the bridge platform with one section
of the bridge in place, the dirty shirt must be taken to the laundry
chute on the upper level in the hotel and dropped inside. The shirt
will appear, clean and pressed, later in the servant's room under
the sign.
</P>

<P>
Now what do I do about the combination lock - how do I open it?
Well, the combination to the lock can be found in the journal which
you found in the wardrobe in the hotel on the middle level.
However, the combination will only appear after you have cleaned the
shirt and put the newspaper you printed under the note in the
servant's room. The locked door will allow access to King Minos
tomb.
</P>

<P>
Now at this point when I read the journal it turns out the number
was wrong. The combination is the date for the last entry. In my
game the date was 4/8/12, which is obviously wrong as the year does
not follow the rest of the journal. The correct combination is
4/8/72, don't forget zeros in front of the 4 and 8. Open the door
and enter King Minos tomb and wander down to the sarcophagus and
open it and pick up the Cretan ornament. There is also a pith
helmet that you can pick up but I never found any use for it. I
wonder were this ornament goes, look familiar, no? You place the
ornament in the door in the Cretan palace, once opened move the
throne and take the other can of paint.
</P>

<P>
Now you will have to return to the Ziggurat and pull the purple
lever to place another section of bridge, after pushing the lever
you will be back on the bridge platform with two sections of the
bridge in place, with one more to go. Now once again make your way
to the Ziggurat and pull the final red lever. Hurray you are once
again on the bridge platform with your bridge completed.
</P>

<P>
Now head to the museum and look inside the broken display case.
There will be something there. It appears only after the bridge is
finished. Take the Mayan Talisman and head for the bridge. Oops,
ended up in jail for theft did we, never fear you have a key. If
you haven't been here before check out gun under the blanket. Now
release yourself from jail and head for the bridge yet again. Once
there cross over and enter the maze centre. You will be facing the
minotaur. Notice the light shining on him, well do something about
it. Get rid of the light, how you say, well paint over the mirrors.
Now place the Labrys in the indentation were the minotaurs head was
and then use mayan talisman on the pyramid keystone. It will be
blasted to pieces. Now sit right back and enjoy the ending
animation. To the best of my knowledge Labyrinth II never came out.
