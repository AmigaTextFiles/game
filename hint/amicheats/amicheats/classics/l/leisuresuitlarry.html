<H2>SOLVE</H2>

<P>
This solve doesn't get all the points, but it finishes the game.
(score 215 of 222)
</P>

<P>
The 1st step is to enter the bar, go to the bathroom and read the
walls several times until you get the password. Then go to the sink
and get the ring. you can (must!) use the toilet if you want. Go 
to the bar and buy a whiskey. Go to the drunk next to the bathroom
wall and (kick him to wake him) give him the whiskey and he'll give
you the remote control. Get the rose too. Go back into the bar and
knock on the big door.. when he asks you for the password.. tell him
"KEN SENT ME", then enter. Turn on the T.V. with the remote. Keep
changing channels until you find a channel he likes.. he'll move
from the stairs. Climb up and voila! The prostitute: Don't hop
into bed with her until you get the rubber. You just need the candy
on the bench. Get it. go out the window, and go to the fire-escape
ladder. You'll fall into a dumpster. Search it and get the hammer.
Exit the dumpster and go left. Call a cab at the street.
</P>

<P>
Now go to the casino and go through the lobby. Get the card in the
ashtray. Now gamble a bit until you have about 250 dollars. Go
outside. Sometime in the game when outside the casino, a guy in a
barrel will come up and ask you to buy an apple. Buy it. Call the
cab.. tell him to go to the store. enter the store and buy a
rubber. Also get the (magazine and) cheap wine in the back.
(never enter the cab with the wine.. the cabbie will get drunk and
kill you) pay for the wine and exit.. Wait for the russian looking
guy to come from the left. (Ignore the dog) When he comes, give him
the wine.. not money. (Look at phone dial number, answer the
questions) Once you have the knife go right and show the pass to
the bouncer at the disco door. Go in and sit down at the table with
the lady. Smile and give her the ring, the candy, and the rose.
Ask her to dance. When you finish off with the dancing ask her to
marry you. She'll ask you for $100. Give it to her and meet her at
the marrage chapel. It's east of the casino front. Enter and go up
to the front. Type "MARRY", and you'll get married.
</P> 

<P>
Go up to the honeymoon suite. (fourth floor, door with the heart,
push four). Knock, and enter. She'll be on the bed, and {NOT IN
THE MOOD!?!} Turn on the radio and listen to it. You'll get a
number to call to get the wine delivered that she wants. Go to
the casino and get some taxi fare money. Go to the phone in front
of the store, (answer the phone if it rings) call the number and
have them deliver it to the {HONEYMOON SUITE}. If they say it
probably won't show up, you screwed up on the typing. Go back to
the casino and go to the suite. Be sure that you have the knife.
Enter and pour the wine. Things will take they're course and
you'll find yourself tied to the bed. (THE BITCH!)
</P>

<P>
Use the knife and free yourself. Get the rope and leave. Go to
the casino again and using some saving, use the dollar and get
about $50. (go to cabaret. find a seat and sitdown. listen to
act.) Once you have it, go to the bar and knock on the door
again. Go up the stairs and screw her now that you have the
rubber. Remove the rubber after you've used it. Go out the window
and this time go to the right of the balcony. Tie the rope to
yourself and tie it to the railing. Type "GO WINDOW" or (reach
out) something so your hanging in front of the window on the right.
Break the glass with the hammer. Get the pills. Pull on the rope
and untie yourself. Go down the fire escape and call a cab again.
Go to the casino and go to the eighth floor. Talk to the lady at
the desk until the game tells you that you'll need some medicine or
something. Give her the pills. She'll run off and leave the desk
unguarded. Push the button and enter the open doors on the right.
Enter and go up and right. When you're in the room with the bed,
open the closet door. Enter it and type, "LOOK". Get the doll...
(look at doll. inflate doll. look at doll. use doll.) then wait as
you run after it. When you're near the hottub, (remove clothes)
enter it. Look at the lady. smile, and give her the apple. Things
will then run they're course, and voila!
