<P>
When starting a new colony name it "Charlotte". This will allow you
to see all maps instantly, other European ports, check other county's
statistics, and gives you $50,000. When you access the other
countries european ports you can spend all there money. Do this by
recruiting loads of people, but you can buy anything.
</P>

<P>
If you rename your colony to something else you can then start
another colony called charlotte and get another $50,000.
