<H2>TIPS</H2>

<H3>PLAYING AGAINST AN ALIEN OPPONENT</H3>

<P>
The aliens never seem to attack your planets until very late in the
game, after they have colonized a lot of the uncolonized planets in
the universe. I can not guarantee that the aliens will attack late
in the game but it is very likely that they will leave you alone
until at least turn 150. As soon as possible build an exploration
ship and send it with a couple of other combat ships (for
protection) to the surrounding planets, this serves two purposes -
to look for planets to colonize and to look for alien life-forms.
</P>

<P>
When you find alien life-forms and the empire offer you fleet forces
or resources. (a transporter partially filled with food, material
and energy) I would recommend that you always take the fleet forces
because spaceships are usually much more useful than a transporter
partially filled with food, material and electricity, also the
empire can send the spaceships to any planet instantly which cuts
down the time spent exploring the universe for good colonizable
planets.
</P>

<P>
The details of fleet forces and resources obtained at different IQ
levels can be seen below:
</P>

<P>
Life Form IQ - Fleet ------ Food - Material - Energy
</P>

<P>
- 1 -------- Fighter -------- 15 --- 0 ------ 15<BR>
- 2 -------- Dreadnought ---- 30 -- 60 ------ 30<BR>
- 3 -------- Cobra Ship ----- 45 - 180 ------ 45<BR>
- 4 -------- Pulsar Destroyer 60 - 240 ------ 60<BR>
- 5 -------- Battlestar ----- 75 - 360 ------ 75
</P>

<P>
When the aliens attack your planets in overwhelming numbers and you
do not have a realistic hope of recapturing it, it is most important
to destroy the energy storage units so that when you come to destroy
the planet with your planet destroyer and the aliens have built a
planet shield you can destroy the planet since you need twice as
much energy as is contained in the planets energy storage units (if
you have demolished the energy storage units that should be 20
energy units).
</P>

<P>
When you no longer have a use for the colony station on your
colonized planets it is a good idea to demolish them - this gives
you 11 units of material and 1 more place to build things and the
you still have the space for 4000 people that you had before you
demolished it. The aliens tend to build more objects on their
planets, the higher the difficulty level. On the easy level they
tend to build 4 objects - typically an alien central unit, a nuclear
power plant, a ground defence unit and a space port.
</P>

<P>
On the suicide level the maximum I have seen the aliens build, given
time is 10 objects - an alien central unit, 2 nuclear power plants,
2 planet defence units, a space port, 2 energy storage units, a
planet shield and an anti spy satellite antenna. This gives the
aliens a maximum of 620 units of energy and the alien central unit
produces 24 units of material per turn regardless of which
difficulty level you are playing on.
</P>

<P>
Do not leave your spaceships in orbit around planets colonized by
the aliens as they will build tripods(alien troops) endlessly until
you leave which can cause problems later on if you decide to invade
the planet with troops.
</P>

<H3>COLONIZABLE PLANETS</H3>

<P>
It is difficult to say how many planets should be colonized to their
full capacity as it largely depends on how quickly you defeat the
aliens and the difficulty level you are playing at.
</P>

<P>
Level --- No. Of Planets To Colonize
</P>

<P>
Easy ---- 1-2<BR>
Medium -- 3<BR>
Hard ---- 4<BR>
Suicide - 5-6
</P>

<P>
The best planets to colonize are planets with the highest food and
mineral wealth (petrol and metals) though mineral wealth is more
important since greenhouses can be built to provide food but mining
sites cannot be built.
</P>

<P>
There are two main ways to defeat the aliens - one is to invade
their planets with spaceships and troops (Very difficult and time
consuming), two is to keep building spaceships, and research until
you reach Tech. level 9 and then build a planet destroyer and
destroy all the planets that the aliens have colonized and then wipe
out the aliens with your large fleet (Much,much less difficult and
much,much less time consuming). It is best to choose which of these
methods you are going to use near to the start of the game (needless
to say I would recommend the second method). If you choose the first
method you will need to build barracks - one or two per planet
should be enough and troop transporters.
</P>

<P>
If you intend invading the alien planets with troops, you will need
approximately three or four times as many troops as there are
tripods defending.
</P>

<P>
If you choose the second method you will need to build lots of
fusion power plants (6 or 7), 7 or more energy storage units and a
planet destroyer on the same planet - it is best to build these
units on the planet furthest away from where you think or know the
aliens are so that it takes more energy when you use the planet
destroyer and that way if the aliens have a planet shield you are
more likely to destroy their planet. The most important part of this
game is that you can only ever build 35 objects on a planet. But
remember you can bulldoze them for the return of half of the
material it cost to build them. The bulldozer facility along with
the increased number of different constructions gives the game a lot
more flexibility, this means that the number and type of objects
built on your planets will be different from game to game. Always
remember to demolish constructions on your planets after they have
ceased to be useful,especially irrigation units, snow melting units
and universities.
</P>

<P>
When tech level 5 is reached you should build fusion power plants
and demolish any energy collectors, coal power plants and nuclear
power plants. If you use method two, after you have destroyed all
the alien's planets, the planet destroyer, extra fusion power plants
and extra energy storage units can be demolished.
</P>

<H3>MOTHERSHIP</H3>

<P>
The mothership is a very powerful spaceship and the only ship
capable of repairing itself. Destroying it will stop the aliens
colonizing other planets but they can still wipe you out with combat
ships and troops. When you have built a planet scanner and think you
have enough combat ships to protect your planets try and find the
mothership by sending some fighters to all of the planets or you can
just wait until it finds you and then track it with the planet
scanner and send enough ships to destroy it. (12-15 pulsar
destroyers (at Tech. level 8 or above) or equivalent should be
sufficient) You will have to chase the mothership from planet to
planet as it usually moves, once it has encountered resistance.
</P>

<P>
Do not attack the mothership with small numbers of ships as it will
destroy them and by the time you have attacked it again it will have
repaired itself.
</P>

<H3>SPY SATELLITE</H3>

<P>
The only time when building a spy satellite is justified is if you
use an energy cannon to attack the alien planets. It is quite useful
to be able to see the result of your attack.
</P>

<H3>TECHNOLOGY LEVELS</H3>

<P>
Tech. Level - Discoveries - Research
</P>

<P>
1 -------- 10 --- Scan Beam Disturber And Anti Spy Satellite Antenna<BR>
2 -------- 20 --- Irrigation Unit,Exploration Ship And Spy Satellite<BR>
3 -------- 40 --- Snow Melting Unit And Cobra Ship<BR>
4 -------- 80 --- Pulsar Destroyer<BR>
5 ------- 160 --- Battlestar And Fusion Power Plant<BR>
6 ------- 320 --- Planet Scanner And Stargate Ship<BR>
7 ------- 640 --- Energy Cannon<BR>
8 ------ 1280 --- Planet Shield<BR>
9 ------ 2560 --- Planet Destroyer<BR>
10+ ---- 5120 --- Nothing Special
</P>

<P>
Note: Stargate ships are discovered at Tech. level 6 NOT Tech. level
5 as may be written in the colonial conquest manual.
</P>

<H3>PLAYING AGAINST A HUMAN OPPONENT</H3>

<P>
Playing against a human opponent is more difficult than against the aliens.
Humans can use energy cannon or planet destroyer against you.
The number and type of buildings built on your planets is roughly the same
as against the aliens but all of your planets should have universities,
because being the first to develop an energy cannon or planet destroyer can
accelerate victory. A planet shield is also advisable so there is less chance
of the above happening.
</P>

<P>
The planet scanner becomes a more useful piece of equipment. It can be used to
discover which planets your opponent has colonized because from time to time
spacecraft will move between the planets and it is likely that the busiest
planets will be colonized, it will at least tell you which area of the universe
is being colonized or explored.
</P>

<P>
Building spy satellites is still a waste of time and resources as your opponent
may have an anti spy satellite antenna and knowing what is happening on their
planets is not a major advantage, and you can only be 50% sure of the number of
spaceships in orbit around the planet.
</P>

<H3>BUGS, ANOMALIES AND STUFF</H3>

<P>
When you start a new game the planet the computer allocates you can
never be explored for life forms.
</P>

<P>
When you build a food robot on grassland it gives you 3 units of
food NOT 2 units as the help feature may display.
</P>

<P>
After the planet destroyer is used, it should self destruct
afterwards, but if you have enough energy you can take 2 or 3 shots
with one planet destroyer in the same turn by selecting the option
more than once from the special commands menu.
</P>

<P>
Colonial Conquest can be multitasked by pressing the left Amiga and
A keys. If you use the planet editor it is worth knowing that when
you design your own planet and come to save it and you use the 'GB'
keymap you will need to press the 'Z' key instead of the 'Y' key, to
save it.
</P>

<P>
If you are using a mouse blanker on your system, then it may cause
some problems when you run Colonial Conquest.
</P>

<P>
FOOD ROBOT: Only build food robots on the 2 most plentiful land
types, and only enough of them to feed the population taking in to
account natural food sites.
</P>

<P>
GREENHOUSE: On planets with few mining sites, greenhouses are best
built on desert or ice terrain but on planets with a lot of mining
sites (more than can be mined by your intended population size)
build them on mining sites since 1 shield of material is also
gained.
</P>

<P>
GRANARY: 2 granaries per planet are best since this gives you a good
supply of food to sell to the empire in exchange for damaged combat
ships.
</P>

<P>
MINING ROBOT: These are best built on sites were metals or petrol
are present. When enough food has been produced for the population
and you have built all of the structures you require, use the
remaining mining sites to build as many mining robots as possible.
</P>

<P>
ENERGY STORAGE UNITS: 2 energy storage units per planet is a good
idea especially if you intend to to install a stargate ship when
Tech. Level 6 is reached because stargates now require energy to
function. If you intend to build a planet scanner or energy cannon
on the planet, 2 energy storage units is fine, but if a planet
destroyer is built a minimum of 3 is needed to be able to fire from
reasonably long distance.
</P>

<P>
ENERGY COLLECTOR: Provides 2 units of energy. Not worth building at
all.
</P>

<P>
CITY COMPLEX: 4 city complexes are best to give a population of
36,000 but on planets with plentiful mining sites, 5 can be built.
</P>

<P>
GROUND DEFENCE UNIT: Ground defence units can be omitted since the
aliens rarely if ever attack your planet with troops until many
turns after they have captured it. If you do build ground defence
units they are very quickly destroyed if the aliens attack.
</P>

<P>
BARRACKS: If you use method one, 1 or 2 barracks per planet is fine
providing you have or intend to, colonize additional planets, this
does not strain the resources of any one planets to much. If you use
method two barracks are obsolete.
</P>

<P>
COAL POWER PLANT: Provides 4 units of energy. Only worth considering
when you first colonize a planet and need more energy to build a
city complex or you want to build a high energy consuming
construction (such as a planet destroyer) and you do not have quite
enough energy and you are sure that you won't need any more energy.
</P>

<P>
NUCLEAR POWER PLANT: Provides 8 units of energy. Only worth building
if you have a small number of shields or you have not reached Tech.
level 5, where-after you can then build fusion power plants.
</P>

<P>
FUSION POWER PLANT: Provides 16 units of energy. As soon as these
become available and you need more energy to build one. Remember you
can always demolish energy collectors, coal power plants and nuclear
power plants. This not only gives you more space on your planets but
more energy production as well.
</P>

<P>
SNOW MELTING UNIT: These are only really useful when you have a
planet with a lot of ice terrain. It would be best to colonize
another planet, but if you do build one remember to demolish it
after it has changed the ice into grassland.
</P>

<P>
IRRIGATION UNIT: These are only really useful when you have a planet
with a lot of desert terrain. It would be best to colonize another
planet. If you do build one remember to demolish it once it has
changed the desert into grassland.
</P>

<P>
UNIVERSITY: Only 1 per planet is needed. It can be omitted if you
are pushed for room or if you have universities on other planets.
</P>

<P>
MEDICAL CENTRE: 1 per planet is essential to stop viruses breaking
out.
</P>

<P>
ENERGY CANNON: Not really worth building as the alien planets have a
maximum of 10 constructions so your chances of hitting anything are
quite slim.
</P>

<P>
PLANET DESTROYER: It takes 4 energy units, a long time to build and
at least 700 energy units to fire, but it is very useful to destroy
the alien planets especially on the hard and suicide levels since it
is difficult to destroy all of their vast numbers of spaceships, and
destroying the alien planets stops them producing spaceships and
then you can build up a large fleet of combat spaceships and destroy
them.
</P>

<P>
pLANET SHIELD: The planet shield is no use at all when playing
against the aliens as they do not build energy cannons or planet
destroyers.
</P>

<P>
PLANET SCANNER: This device uses 20 energy units for a short range
scan and 50 energy units for a long range scan. 1 per game is
needed, which is best built on the most central planet in the
universe, since with a long range scan the movements of the alien
spaceships can be seen throughout most of the universe.
</P>

<P>
SCAN BEAM DISTURBER: Not worth building since the aliens don't
produce spy satellites.
</P>

<P>
ANTI SPY SATELLITE ANTENNA: Not worth building as the the aliens
don't build spy satellites.
</P>

<P>
SPACE PORT: 1 per planet is absolutely essential.
</P>

<P>
COLONY SHIP: It is best to build colony ships with 3 or 4 colonists
aboard and establish colonies, as early in the game as possible.
</P>

<P>
STARGATE SHIP: Stargate ships should be built at your earliest
opportunity when Tech. level 6 is reached. Stargates should be
established at all of your colonized planets. The distance between
stargates does not effect the amount of energy needed to make the
jump. The amount of energy needed to make a stargate jump with each
of the different spaceships can be seen below:-
</P>

<P>
Type Of Spaceship - Energy needed for Stargate Jump
</P>

<P>
Fighter ------------ 2<BR>
Transporter -------- 3<BR>
Exploration Ship --- 4<BR>
Troop Transporter -- 4<BR>
Colony Ship -------- 5<BR>
Dreadnought -------- 7<BR>
Cobra Ship -------- 12<BR>
Pulsar Destroyer -- 17<BR>
Stargate Ship ----- 18<BR>
Battlestar -------- 22
</P>

<P>
TRANSPORTER: The best use for the transporter is to move between all
of your planets, loading and unloading food, material and energy as
needed. It is especially useful for collecting energy for a planet
destroyer attack.
</P>

<P>
EXPLORATION SHIP: Build an exploration ship as soon as possible
after Tech. level 2 is reached and send it out with a couple of
combat ships as backup to explore planets for alien lifeforms and
colonizable planets.
</P>

<P>
TROOP TRANSPORTER: Only worth building late on in the game if you
have troops to transport.
</P>

<P>
COMBAT SHIPS: Fighters are only really worth building to protect
exploration ships and to explore the universe early on in the game
for good colonizable planets. It is difficult to say which combat
ships are the best to build. Dreadnoughts take less time and
material to build and aren't that powerful. Cobra Ships are take
more time and material to build but are more powerful. I find that
Pulsar Destroyers and battlestars are best to build as they are very
powerful and give you more time to get reinforcements to a battle.
