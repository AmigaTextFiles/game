<P>
During the platform section, type "COLIN BROKE MY WALKMAN". This
will give you infinite lives.
</P>

<P>
You could also type "COLIN BROKE MMY WALKMMAN" on the section where
you have to collect nickles. The reason why you have to type two
M's is because the 'M' key calls up the map screen and does not 
register the first 'M' as part of the cheat.
