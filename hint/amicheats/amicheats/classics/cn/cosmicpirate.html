<P>
Pause the game with the 'SPACEBAR' and press full stop. A
requester will appear, now type "GZAIMASEN" and you should hear a
sound letting you know it worked. Once the cheat is in effect you
are invicible and if you call the requester and type "GIMMESHIPx"
(where x is the mission A-Z). This only works before you enter the
sector with the spacetruck.
