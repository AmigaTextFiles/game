<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Your mission (should you choose to accept): rescue an American
ambassador from a group of fanatical terrorists. If you are up to
the challenge, then step forward and join the global action of
Codename: Ice Man, a new genre of adventure/simulation game. Ice Man
allows you to experience a futuristic nuclear attack submarine
sumulator. Guide this advanced stealth sub across the globe and into
combat with enemy warships. New enhancements of SCI produced a very
authentic simulation. Using an optional mouse, you can work the
gauges and steering wheel in the submarine. Also, an improved parsor
provides a much more life like feel to the action. As Johnny
Westland, a member of an elte U.S. Navy Seals (Sea, Air, Land)
commando team, you must travel undetected, via a state-of-the-art
nuclear attack submarine, to rescue the ambassador and time is
running out! Set in the futre, Codename: Ice Man takes you from the
sun-splashed beaches of Tahiti, underneath the polar icecap and to
the dusty, heat seared desert of North Africa.
