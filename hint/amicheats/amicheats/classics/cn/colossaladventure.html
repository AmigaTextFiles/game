<H3>NOTES</H3>

<P>
There are several `random' elements within this adventure, so it is
not possible to indicate EXACTLY where or when they occur. The best
thing to do is follow the procedures, detailed in these preliminary
notes, to deal with each problem as and when it arises.
</P>

<P>
The first Dwarf you meet will throw an axe or small knife at you.
It always misses the first time. Ignore the knife but get the axe.
From then on, when you meet a Dwarf, throw the axe and take it
again. One throw will usually suffice but you may have to repeat
the action.
</P>

<P>
When you have some treasures the Pirate will rob you. To retrieve
them (also the chest, which is itself a necessary treasure) go to
the West End of the Hall of Mists. Now follow these directions
EXACTLY: South, East, South, South, South, North-East, East,
North-West.
</P>

<P>
You will now have found the chest containing your stolen treasure.
Take the chest AND your stolen treasures and proceed EXACTLY as
follows: South-East, North, Down, East, East, Say `Xyzzy' You are
now back at the Small Brick Building. Deposit the chest and
treasures and resume where you left off. The Pirate will not
return.
</P>

<P>
When you are told that the lamp is flickering, this is a warning
that the batteries need replacing. Go back to the Small Brick
Building and Get The Coins. `Say Plugh' and then `On Lamp' then
proceed EXACTLY as follows: South, South, Up, West, West, West,
West, West, South, East, East, Climb.
</P>

<P>
You will now have found the Vending Machine and you should `DROP
COINS'. The machine will dispense new batteries and your lamp is
automatically `recharged'.
</P>

<P>
Now proceed: North, Up, East, East, East, East, East, Down, North,
North, Off Lamp, Say `Plugh' You are now back at the Small Brick
Building. As the coins were a necessary treasure, this procedure
will deduct TEN points from your final score!
</P>

<P>
This solution cuts a few unnecessary corners out, and fully utilises
ON/OFF LAMP and the magic words: PLUGH, PLOVER and XYZZY to reduce
the chances of needing replacement batteries.
</P>

<P>
The `Endgame' will materialise when ALL treasures have been
collected and shortly after you are informed that the `Caves are
closing'.
</P>

<P>
Finally, each time you `SAVE' your position, ONE point is deducted
from your score.
