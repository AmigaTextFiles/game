<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Ambushed, captured, and knocked unconscious, you awake with no idea
who attacked you or how you arrived in Tilverton. The mystical power
of the azure symbols ensnares your will like metal bonds. When the
bonds glow, you must do as they command. Your only hope is to search
the Forgotten Realms for members of the alliance who created the
bonds and regain control of your own destiny. This exciting sequel
to Pool of Radiance lets you transfer characters from Pool and
Hillsfar. Features include new player character types, high-level
advancement, deadly new monsters, and over 24 new spells.

<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
In case anyone was wondering, The `Wizard in Red' refers to
Dracandros. He is the owner of the Crescent Moon bond. The
`Woman in Green' refers to the leader of the Cultists of Moander.
They, of course, are the owners of the Mouth in the Hand bond,
which is the symbol of the God Moander. The `Lord of the Black'
refers to the leader of the Zhentrim, or `Black Network', an evil
alliance of priests, mages and thieves that operate out of Zhentil
Keep. They own the big `Z' in the Triangle bond. Lastly, `The
Flamed One' is, of course, good old Tyranthraxus. He owns the
Flaming Bond, which is the Symbol of Tyranthraxus.
</P>

<P>
To defeat Tyranthraxus, you must gather the Amulet of Lathander,
which is in Zhentil Keep, the Helm of Dragons, which is currently
being kept by Dracandros in his castle near Haptooth, and the
Gauntlet of Moander, which is kept by Mogion (the Woman in Green!)
in Yulash. You must take these items to the Pool of Radiance.

<H2>SOLVE</H2>

<H3>1st BOND: THE FIRE KNIVES</H3>

<P>
The first thing you should do after creating your characters is to
go to the armoury and the general store. Get your characters
equipped as best as possible. Also visit the High priest of the
temple of Gond and the Sage Filani. Also go to the tavern, wait
there having drinks etc.. until the tavern keeper asks you to
leave. Leave, go to the side entrance, then got to the front and
enter the tavern again. To explain what just happened, Princess
Nacacia just got abushed by the Fire Knives as she tried to enter
the tavern. Stay in the tavern if you need some info. Go to the
Inn (where u start) and rest, Memorise spells etc.. If you
transfered Pools of Radiance or Hillsfar Characters then first get
them to train, in the hall. Now you will soon be starting the chase
for the Fire Knives. Go North, and head west just after the general
store and you should automatically get into a fight with the purple
guard. While you were fighting, The fire knives have nicked Giogi
Wyvernspur from The carriage. After you defeat the guards (Its your
first fight, You DID defeat them didnt you?), Either surrender or
run down the nearest alley. The Thieves Guild will send someone to
get you out. The guild master gives you a sewers map and the Fire
Knives attack. Kill them off and head south to the sewers. You
should go to the vault on this level because it contains quite a few
magical items as well as some coins. (I've also done maps for the
game and they can be found in another archive. They aren't
nessecary to complete it, but they do show the important places in
each dungeon saving you from going everywhere.). Go South through
the sewers and youl come across three seperate exits in the
southernmost end wall. Two are normal doors, One is a secret door.
There is also a secret Training Hall somewhere is the South East of
the sewers. After exiting the sewers There are only a few places to
go that are of any real interest. One is the armoury in south, as
there are a few Magic Items here. However the most interetsting
place is the South West corner where you get your bond removed and
meet Nacacia, Azoun, Vandergahast and last and least Giogi. Before
this however, you should rescue The Cleric, Gharri, from the torture
chamber. After having your bond removed go to the standing stone.
This is where you should always go when you have a bond removed
because the man there (Tyranthraxus) tells you who to kill off next
and where they are. He does this so he has full control of you for
himself. At this time he should say "Seek Red to the South.". He
means the Renegade Red wizard of Thay, Dracandros.
</P>

<H3>2nd BOND: DRACANDROS, RED WIZARD OF THAY AND THE HELM OF DRAGONS</H3>

<P>
Go south till you reach the village of Hap. Your first task in
removing the bond is to free the village. This is quite easy and
should pose to much of a problem. The village has been taken over
by an efreet and his Drow minions. You will find help in the inn in
the form of one Akabar El Akesh. He is a mage of some very small
level and is almost, but not exactly, useless. If you go into the
south building immediately you will be severly wasted. If however
you kill of some drow patrols first, then the Efreets forces will be
severly reduced and easy pickings. After obliterating the efreet go
to the caves. Go South East when you enter the caves and as long as
you have a female member in your party, you will meet Silk of the
swan mays. She will give the 1st Female in the party the mark of a
swanmay and will ask you to do something for her. Go to the sulphur
baths and get the chests from them. There are several magic Items
in them including a Longsword +2 Dragon slayer which will help I you
decide to kill of the dragons. Exit the caves via the dracolich.
If you need XP, then kill him, Otherwise leave Crimshank alone.
When you enter the tower you will meet dracandros. He will teleport
you to the top of the tower where a host of evil black dragons are
waiting. They force him to remove the bond. You now have to
choices. Attack the dragons, and be passive. If you attack the
dragons you had better hope you can kill them, but if you do you get
quite a few XP and get the stuff that Silk wants. You should now
head slowly down the tower. On the third floor there is a drow
lord. Save your game before finding him because he is sometimes
hard, sometimes easy to kill. On the 3rd floor theres a dragons egg
which Silk also wants. There are a lot of wyverns hanging around in
the tower and unless the party is relatively strong it may be an
idea to avoid the rooms theyre in. In the tower somewhere is a
special place called the Test of The Sphere. In this test a
character controls a sphere of annihalation and must, by
concentrating on it, force it into an opposing mage. Your character
doesn't have to be a mage, I did it with a ranger. If you win you
get some magic Items. If you lose youre disintegrated permanent
like. On the ground floor after leaving the tower you will be
attacked by Dracandros himself. Destroy his forces and him and you
are well rewarded. Dracandros has stacks of Magic on his corpse.
Re-enter the caves if you killed the dragons and got the egg and
Silk will give you some treasure. Unfortunately this isnt magical
Though it will help if youre broke. Go back to Haptooth and id all
magic and Rest/Fix/Memorise all chars and spells etc.. No go to the
standing stone. Tyranthraxus says:Seek the woman in green to the
NW. By This he means Mogion a cultist of moander who resides in
moanders pit.
</P>

<H3>BOND 3: MOGION, THE GREEN CULTISTS, A GOD AND THE GAUNTLET OF MOANDER</H3>

<P>
Go to and Enter Yulash. You should enter by asking permission. You
will be taken to see the commander. Walk around the room until the
spies try to escape kill them and you wont have to worry about the
red plume guards in the check points. There are only two places you
must go to in Yulash, The first is the middle of the city to get the
wand of defoliation. and the secon is the North East to enter the
pit of moander. Enter the pit and follow the sights and sounds of a
recent battle. You will find Alias and DragonBait. Allow them to
join and head for the stairs in the South East. Go down and go
straight North take out the slug and the cultists and continue north
till you reach a pair of doors. Enter and attack Mogion when you
get a chance. After insuring the death of Mogion and her Cult you
will be attacked by a parts of a God. Called "Bit'O'Moanders" they
are reasonably easy to defeat, using spells like Stinking Cloud, and
Hold Monster. Search the Altar for some treasure and leave the pit
by the exit door on the first level. Now visit Tyranthraxus at the
standing stone again and hell tell you to "Seek Black to the
North.". The black lord is Fzoul Chembyrl, one of the higher
members of the Zhentrim.
</P>

<H3>BOND 4: FZOUL, DEXAM AND THE AMULET OF LATHANDER</H3>

<P>
Go to and enter the city of Zhentil Keep. Here you may buy numerous
Magic Items and various goods you may need to restock. Buy all you
need and then follow the path around until you meet Olive Ruskettle,
The halfling Bard. Follow her and enter the door in front of you
when she leaves. You will find Dimswart the sage. Take him with
you and make your way to the chapel. DONT follow the woman until
you've searched the altar. One of the weapons you find there is
cursed so be careful. Follow the Hooded Woman (Medusa) and she will
take you to Dexam the Beholder. He will disintegrate Fzoul,
removing your bond and leave. You must find and kill Dexam to get
the amulet of lathander. He is in the South West Corner of His
Temple with a few minotaurs and his Medusa. Another place of
interest here is the dead elfs body which has a few items on it.
Avoid the North East Corner because there is a trap there that
teleports you to the dead elf causing you damage. For the last time
go to the standing stone and Tyranthraxus reveals himself and goes
to his temple in Myth Drannor.
</P>

<H3>BOND 5: TYRANTHRAXUS AND THE POOL OF RADIANCE</H3>

<P>
This is the last part of the game so make sure your characters are
all max level or youll be slaughtered. In the Burial Glen fights
with spiders can NOT be avoided however fights with Thri-Kreen can
by parlaying and saying that Tyranthraxus is your master. Always
Rebury the skeletons and replace the bones in crypts. There are
five things which should happen before you continue. You should go
to the Spirit Queen in the Tomb in the North West Corner and get the
magic Items she gives you. You should follow and kill of the Red
Plume soldier (who is really a Rakshasa.) and get his bow and
arrows. You should meet The Nameless Bard (Finder Wyvernspur). You
should kill the thri Kreen in their lair. And finally There are
Knights of Myth Drannor wandering around. Dont enter the ruins
without meeting them. To reach the ruins simply go east and enter
the east forest. Follow the woods not the path. In the ruins there
are only a few things to do. You should first save the guy running
from the hell hounds and go and get his treasure. Next go visit the
old Rakshasa and speak Haughtily to him and he'll offer his
assisstance. Somewhere in the ruins a rakshasa is wandering around
and asks you to help him raid the treasure room. Assisst and get
the treasure. Go break up the gambling game in the North West as
well. Note: Save frequently. If you encounter a patrol just give
them dosh. Finally Enter the sewer grate located somewhere in the
North West Quadrant. You will now find yourself in the temple.
Head west until you find Tyranthraxus and then when he runs off go
north and up the stairs. Now go to the North East and enter the
South Door. You are now in the final battle with Tyranthraxus and
his 12 High Priests and 48 Margoyles. The easiest way to kill him
is to all be invisible with either the spell (Not very effective) or
the Dust of Disappearance (infinitely Preferable). Once you have
defeated him you will be teleported to Shadowdale where a feast will
be held in your honour.
