<H2>SOLVE</H2>

<P>
You start in your room. You have been accused of murdering someone
you never met, and you must prove your innocence. EXAMINE the
BACKPACK, you will find a RECORDER, a CASSETTE and HEADPHONES. Get
out of your room (E), and go downstairs to the Dining Room
(N-N-N-S-E). OPEN the KITCHEN Door, and enter (N). SHOW GREENBACK
(Cash) to Alex, he will sell you a BOTTLE OF WINE and you will get
some COINS. Get out of the KITCHEN, CLOSE the kitchen door and USE
COINS with JUKEBOX to create some noise. Now you can enter Alex's
room to the NORTH-EAST. Take the SECURITY-KEY there and go to the
CLOSET Room (SW-W-S). Use the SECURITY-KEY on the door to the left
and enter the CLOSET (W). Take the FLASHLIGHT and the TOOLKIT.
</P>

<P>
Get out of the CLOSET and go to the SHOWER#1 on this floor (E-N-W).
You find the shower is not to your taste, so you USE the TOOLKIT on
the SHOWER and wreck it! Your character will go tell the hotel
manager that there is a wrecked shower and you find yourself in the
RECEPTION. EXAMINE the POSTER and the GUESTBOOK in the RECEPTION.
Get back to the SHOWER (N-N-W) and you will find that the manager
left his master key there, TAKE GENERAL KEY, it will open almost all
the doors in the hotel. You are now free to wander around the first
floor. When you figure out that there is nothing to do on this
floor, you proceed upstairs. Once upstairs, use the GENKEY on the
door to the West of the staircase and enter the TEL# room. EXAMINE
the PHONE, your character will remember the hotel's phone number for
you. Time to take a shower, get out of the room and to the shower
on this floor (E-S-E-SE) and ACTIVATE the SHOWER. you will discover
a small piece of paper on your shoes, and you will find yourself
back in your room...
</P>

<P>
You are back in your room but you have a feeling that there is more
to this shower than meets the eye, so you decide to go back and take
a look (E-N-E-SE). When you get in, you find Gwendoline taking a
shower, ooooo! Don't talk to her! Instead, now that the Young's
have left their room (you'll find the husband in the Men's room) you
can go in and satisfy your perverted little mind.
</P>

<P>
You get out of the shower, and USE GENKEY on the door to the East.
Enter the Young's room. TAKE the SHEETS, USE CASSETTE on RECORDER,
ACTIVATE RECORDER and hide it under the bed with USE RECORDER with
BED. Ah, you just can't wait! Leave the room and leave the door
unlocked, the Youngs will think that the maid came and picked up the
sheets. While you're in this corridor, use the GENKEY on the NORTH
door and enter the Baumanns' room. USE the SCISSORS with the SHEETS
and you will make a ROPE; this will be useful soon. Get out of the
room and lock the door behind you (USE GENKEY again on the North
door). Now you need to move around a bit and let the Youngs alone.
Let's go downstairs and up again (W-N-N-N-S-E), you are back in
front of the Youngs, and the RECORDER is lying on the floor. TAKE
RECORDER, ACTIVATE it to turn it off, and OPEN RECORDER to take out
the tape. You need something to listen to that tape!
</P>

<P>
Get out the corridor and go the the SE room (W-S-S). Use the GENKEY
on the South-East door, and enter the room. EXAMINE the NIGHTSTAND,
you will find a WALKMAN and some BULLETS. Time to do some prank
calls! But first, let's give the Russian chess player a lesson. Go
back into the corridor and enter the Southern room. Talk to the
Russian and ACTIVATE the CHESSBOARD on HIM. You'll beat him and
he'll leave the room crying, hahaha! Take the CHESSMAG and read it.
Get out of the room and back in again; SHOW that fake the CHESSMAG
and have him beg for mercy!
</P>

<P>
Enough fun with that guy. Go back to the shower and wreck it with
the TOOLKIT (N-N-E-SE-USE TOOLKIT ON SHOWER). Once again, your
character will go to the reception and complain that there is a
wrecked shower. You are now all alone in the RECEPTION! Use the
GENKEY on the East door and enter the manager's room. EXAMINE the
NIGHTSTAND, you will find a COMBINATION. Now, you need to occupy
that manager before he comes back. Here's what you will do: USE
CASSETTE w/ WALKMAN, USE HEADPHONES w/ WALKMAN, ACTIVATE WALKMAN,
USE PHONE with WALKMAN. You dial the hotel's number and the manager
picks up in some room! You are now free to explore the basement
while he listens attentively to the Youngs having fun! Go back in
the RECEPTION, and EXAMINE the CARPET. You will find a TRAPDOOR,
OPEN the TRAPDOOR, ACTIVATE the FLASHLIGHT, and USE ROPE on
TRAPDOOR.
</P>

<P>
Ahhhh, the TV cable! Ah-Ah! Once you are in the basement, TAKE the
ANTENA-CABLE, you will pull it out. ACTIVATE the ROPE to get back
up, CLOSE the TRAPDOOR, ACTIVATE the FLASHLIGHT to turn it off and
go back in the manager's room to retrieve the WALKMAN. ACTIVATE the
WALKMAN to turn it off, OPEN WALKMAN to take out the tape, get out
of the manager's room and USE GENKEY on the door to lock it behind
you. Go back to the Dining Room, you will meet the Japanese guy
there (N-N-E). SHOW him the BOTTLE OF WINE, he will get drunk and
he will give you a BUILDING KIT. Hmmmm, no instructions, darn. I
bet they are in his room! Go back upstairs to his room (W-N-N-S-S)
and use the GENKEY on the East door. Enter the room and TAKE the
MANUAL.
</P>

<P>
Now is a good time to take a look at the guy you've supposedly
murdered. Get out of the Japanese guys room and go to the
electronically locked one (W-N). USE the COMBINATION on the LOCK
and enter the room. TAKE the GUN and EXAMINE the DEAD BODY, you
will find a special LIGHTER. USE the GUN with the AMMUNITION to
load it and USE the LIGHTER on the PIECE OF PAPER, it will turn into
a FORMULA. You're almost home free!
</P>

<P>
Go back to the Youngs' room (E-E), and once again use the GENKEY to
open the door. Let's do some more recording. USE the MANUAL on the
BUILDING KIT, it will turn into a SENDER and a RECEIVER. USE the
TOOLKIT on the PHONE to take it appart and USE SENDER on the PHONE.
You have placed the bug into the phone, get out of the Young's room
and go back in the Shower (W-SE). USE the CASSETTE with RECORDER,
USE HEADPHONES with RECORDER, ACTIVATE the RECORDER and USE the
RECEIVER with it...
</P>

<P>
Your receiver picks up a very interesting conversation between
Russian spies, and your recorder is faithfully taping the whole
thing! You now have all the evidence you need to clear your name
(No, you'll never be able to convince anyone that you're not a
drunk, but that's another story). Don't you think it's time to use
that nice GUN? Get out of the shower and back into the Youngs room!
Your GAY friend will meet you there!
