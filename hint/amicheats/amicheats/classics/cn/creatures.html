<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Distress calls received from deep space report hostile alien life
forms, and you are the only space security captain within range.
Will your light phaser (sold separately by Actionware) be enough to
stop the aliens? And what of the rumors describing an unstoppable
beast that lurks within the walls of the space station? This may
turn out to be your worst nightmare, for it is... Creatures! Also
uses mouse.

<P>
Plug your Joystick in port 2. Load the game and wait for the title
music to start. When this happens, on the high score table the
clydes will stop. Waggle your joystick furiously. The clydes should
do a dance and turn grey. You now have infinite lives, except on the
torture screens.

<P>
Pause the game and type "A FINE KETTLE OF FISH". This gives you 
infinite lives and use of the following keys:
