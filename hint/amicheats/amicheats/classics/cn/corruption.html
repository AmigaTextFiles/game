<H2>SOLVE</H2>

<P>
You have done well in the Scott Electronics deal. David Rogers
offers you a partnership in Rogers and Rogers (you are Derek
Rogers). You get a BMW and a different office on the second floor.
Margaret Stubbs is your secretary. David's office is on the floor
below, you must go through his secretary's office to get to it.
</P>

<P>
You are carrying a briefcase (contains a personal organiser and the
Times), and wearing a jacket (pocket has a credit card and keys),
tie, trousers, shirt.
</P>

<P>
David's secretary is Theresa Jenkins. The company lawyer is Bill
Hughes. David gives you a list of early bookings and tells you to
take it to the dealings room at the end of the corridor. He gives
an envelope to Margaret and says for her to sign the cheque and take
it to him by 11:30. He has to sign an affidavit for Bill.
</P>

<P>
Follow David and "listen at wooden door". You hear that Bill has
the affidavit in his car. He gives David the keys and says to put
it in his safe.
</P>

<P>
Go to the dealings office. Someone takes the list from you and says
the Fraud office is looking for David. You'd better tell him. Go
to the bathroom and into the cubicle. Open the cistern and see a
bag of white powder. Put it back and close the cistern. David goes
into the bathroom at 9:30. After he leaves, you see the bag has
gone. The mirror has scratches on the surface. If you ask Theresa
about the powder, she says David may know something about it.
</P>

<P>
NOTE: If you ask the chemist about the powder, he can't help.
</P>

<P>
Go to Margaret and get the letter. She says she was going to take
it to David but you can. Look in it. Read it and examine the
cheque. It's addressed to Blue Dolphin Security, 22 London Rd, EC2
and the cheque is made out to a Mr Charpontier for 60,000 pounds.
Go to Bill's office and get the magazine from his desk. Read it.
</P>

<P>
Go to Theresa's office. At 10:00 she leaves and goes to the
bathroom. Open the drawer of the desk, get the brass key and uase
it to unlock the door to David's office. Go in. On the desk is a
cassette. Get it. Go back out, lock the door and close the drawer.
</P>

<P>
Get the perfumed letter from the shredding machine. (Theresa won't
let you get it if she's there, if you ask her about it she says it's
from one of his women, I have to shred them all). Examine the
letter. It's in your wife's handwriting. Read it.
</P>

<P>
Go to the carpark. Inside the Volvo you can see a folder. Unlock
the BMW with the keys from your pocket. Get in and put the cassette
in the player. You hear a doctored version of a conversation you
had with David. Open the glove compartment and get the screwdriver
from inside it.
</P>

<P>
NOTE: DON'T use the car as it blows up!
</P>

<P>
Leave the BMW and break the window of the Volvo with the
screwdriver. Get folder, open it, read affidavit. It says David
didn't know anything about the Scott Electronics shares. (This must
be done before 11:25 when David collects the folder.)
</P>

<P>
Go to your office and open the filing cabinet. Get everything from
it - an amended ledger and a share certificate. The ledger shows
the expenses relating to your department. If you read it, you find
that your department is well in the black and making a healthy
profit. The certificate is for 20,000 shares in Scott Electronics.
(This must be done before 11:30(ish) when David comes up from the
car park and gets them - if you've taken them but are in the office
he asks if you've seen them, he then goes to Bill's office and you
can hear them arguing about you); Put everything in the briefcase.
</P>

<P>
At 11:00am, Margaret leaves the office. If you hadn't collected the
envelope, she takes it to David, then leaves in a taxi to go to
lunch. Get the phone and at 11:25 you overhear a conversation
between David and Bill about setting you up. One says it's too soon
but they've got to move quickly to save the company and Goddard
wants convictions.
</P>

<P>
At 12:00, Theresa leaves her office and goes to the park to eat her
sandwiches and feed the ducks. Get the phone at 11:10 in her
office, you overhear a conversation between David and Charpontier.
Charpontier supplies drugs. David says you've found out about the
insider dealing and may know about the coke. They're bound to find
out where the money's going to. Charpontier says he'll sort it out.
</P>

<P>
NOTE: If you ring home, a man's voice answers and you hang up.
</P>

<P>
(If you haven't done anything, at 12:24 you're arrested for insider
dealing, the evidence being the share certificate, cassette and
affidavit. David and Jenny are there together and you're found
guilty)
</P>

<P>
NOTE: In your organiser it says about meeting your wife for lunch
at 1:00. You can do this but it isn't essential. She is dropped at
the restaurant from a Porsche (David) and says she wants a divorce.
She leaves in a taxi at 1.57.
</P>

<P>
Instead, go to the park and hang about near the tramp. If you
examine him, he looks too young to have been on the streets too
long, and his clothes are too clean. Eventually he attacks you and
you end up in hospital.
</P>

<P>
NOTE: You can get to hospital in other ways; eg: by stepping into
the road twice in sucession, but you must be sent there by the tramp
as you can use this as evidence.
</P>

<P>
NOTE: BEFORE you go to hospital make sure you're wearing the
clothes and all your things are in the briefcase.
</P>

<P>
Nurse Stephenson leaves the ward after a while. If you don't get
out or if you get caught, you're put in bed and given an injection
by a doctor which kills you. In the ward is an empty bed. On it is
a pillowcase and some papers for a Mr Davis who is due to have
plastic surgery on his face and then taken by private ambulance to a
nursing home. Your things are on the locker by the bed and your
clothes are in a locker in the TV room.
</P>

<P>
NOTE: DON'T use "GET ALL FROM LOCKER" or the program bombs out!!!
If you weren't wearing all the clothes, anything you're carrying is
put on the locker and the program will again crash.
</P>

<P>
When she leaves, get up, get the briefcase and everything from the
empty bed. Put the briefcase on the empty bed. Go to the TV Room,
open the locker and get everything from it. Boris is wearing a
stethoscope (if you examine him) so get that too. Go to accident
and emergency, put everything except the papers into the pillowcase.
You hear footsteps, then after another couple of moves some more.
Wait once then go to the bed outside the operating theatre. Get the
bandage from it, wear it (you peek out through a gap). Lie on the
bed, put the pillowcase on the bed.
</P>

<P>
The nurses arrive, read the papers and call the ambulance. One goes
to check if you've left anything on your bed. You are bundled into
an ambulance.
</P>

<P>
Get off the bed, remove the pyjamas and get everything from the
pillowcase (clothes and stethoscope). Wear the clothes and get the
briefcase. Open the door of the ambulance. When the ambulance
stops at the lights at Le Monaco, go south to leave it. If you
don't, you're discovered as an imposter at the nursing home,
colected by the police and released, but you lose the stethoscope
and your jacket.
</P>

<P>
At 3:30, Theresa goes home. Go into David's office and get the
televsion. You see a hole behind it with a safe with a dial. Wear
the stethoscope. Put it on the safe and turn the dial several
times. The safe opens.
</P>

<P>
Get everything from it. You have a bundle of receipts, casino chips
for 500 pounds and a full ledger. Examine them. The receipts show
all payments made by the company in the last few weeks. Read them;
at least 5000 pounds is being paid each month to Blue Dolphin
Securities. The ledger is your partner's copy of the company
accounts for the last financial year. Read it; the company is
incurring some very heavy losses with large sums of money being paid
each month to an unamed company.
</P>

<P>
Go to the Police Station and tell the Sergeant about the bag. He
says you'd better see the Inspector and you're searched for weapons
then taken to the interview room.
</P>

<P>
The Inspector asks about insider dealing and pinning it on someone
and ask what you know. Tell the Inspector about the affidavit; he
says they'll need it for evidence so give it. Ditto the certificate
and cassette. He says it looks as though you're guilty. Tell him
about the conversation. He says that they may fear the production
of the company accounts.
</P>

<P>
Tell him about the full ledger. He says he wants both ledgers and
receipts. Give them and tell him about the receipts. Tell him
about Charpontier, and the envelope. Give it to him. Tell him
about the phonecall. He asks if any attempts have been made on your
life. Tell him about the tramp. He says your partner and
Charpontier have probably covered themselves against each other in
case one gets caught. Do you know what they may have done? Tell
him about magazine.
</P>

<P>
He says they need your help. They'll fit you with a radio, you find
Charpontier and get him to admit to setting up the assassin. Will
you do it? "Yes". You get wired up.
</P>

<P>
Go to Le Monaco and show chips to Waiter. He shows you through to
the backyard and says to knock on the door. Mr Prentice will let
you in. Knock on wooden door, you're shown in. You see a Teller
you can ask for credit, a Bouncer and a locked padded door to a
private room.
</P>

<P>
Ask Teller for credit. You're told you can have 500 pounds
repayable in a week. You must go to the private office. In there
three men are playing poker. The bald one is Charpontier. The
others are Mr Park and Mr Seeley. Charpontier says he knows who you
are and he's been asked to have you killed. One of his men is
looking for you at this moment and if he fails, the henchman
(Wesley) will do it. He says Mr Rogers stole a document and left it
with his lawyers. If you return it this evening, you can live.
</P>

<P>
Go back and open wooden door with credit card (it only has a latch).
Open drawer (of desk) with screwdriver. Get document and read it.
It gives all the details. Go back to Charpontier. The police
arrive after a few moves and justice is done!
</P>
