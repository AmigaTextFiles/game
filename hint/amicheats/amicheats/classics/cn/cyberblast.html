<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Your goal is to make your way through 64 levles of Fastrax Labs
until you find the missing control chip. Locating the control chip
closes the portal that allows the deadly aliens to enter our
universe. To complete a level, you must find and grab the crystals
and then locate and enter the exit within a specific time limit. You
pick up energy, points, laser pistols, bombs, and grenades. Each
character has unique speed, shields, strenght, zappower, and
shotspeed. Of course our journey is hampered by walls, enemies, and
many other threats to your life. Two-player simultaneous mode.
