<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Or does it? This is the official mobster game endorsed by the Mafia.
You don't own the town yet? That won't last long. Maybe becoming
mayor of the city would solve your problem. But what about using
mobsters to bribe, blackmail, and fight the big guys. Don't listen to
justice and order, have no scruples, and lead your gangs to gain
control over money and power. Who are you? The godfather, the femme
fatale, or the killer? You will have a realistic map of the city
where you can visit 200 locations and meet 10 important people.

Pause the game and type "HALTBAKK IS THE KING" for unlimited lives.
