<H2>SOLVE</H2>

<H3>PART I</H3>

<H4>DUNGEON</H4>

<P>
Okie Dokie, call `help' and the guard will appear and shout at you.
He drops a key on the way out. Pick up the key and unlock the
chains. Now, take a closer look at the back wall where the water is
dripping out, pull the mortar and you'll discover a paper clip. Now
insert the paper clip into the lock to pick the lock open.
</P>

<H4>CORRIDOR</H4>

<P>
Pick up the goldfish bowl off the table and make your way through
the corridor.Be careful, along the corridor are statues which whack
you on the head with huge mallets! On the way try to collect the
gems scattered on the floor and the coin on the table. These are
only collected for extra points.Exit through the door at the end of
the corridor.
</P>

<H4>LAKEBED</H4>

<P>
Wear the goldfish bowl so you can breathe and then walk over to the
fish stuck in the railings. Pull the fish free. Walk along for a
bit until you discover some mud on the ocean floor.Look at the mud
and a worm will appear, pick it up. Now, go to Mr. Fish's Shop and
give him the worm, in exchange he'll fill your goldfish bowl up with
oxygen.
</P>

<P>
Now, keep on moving until you see the electric eels, at this point
the fish you freed before will drop an oyster. Pick up the oyster
and give it to the turtle, you will now carry you over the eels.
</P>

<P>
Once over the eels pick up the cattle prod and continue walking.
When the sharks come towards you attack them with the cattle prod,
keep on doing this until you reach a giant clam. Wait until the
clam is closed and jump over it. Insert the cattle prod into the
plughole and you'll get sucked down.
</P>

<H4>POOL ROOM</H4>

<P>
Walk over to the bottom right of the screen and look around until
you find some seaweed. Go up to the wall and push the protruding
rock to reveal a secret entrance.
</P>

<H4>CAVE CORRIDORS</H4>

<P>
While you're wandering around the corridors pick up as many rocks as
you can and give them to the rock basher in the rock basher room.
Also, you need to find a gold coin, it's by one of the entrances..it
glints so you shouldn't have any trouble finding it.
</P>

<H4>ROCK BASHER ROOM</H4>

<P>
Give the rock basher all 18 rocks (three of each size) you won't be
able to collect them all at once so you will have to go back. The
rock basher will then give you a piece of string.
</P>

<H4>SEESAW ROOM</H4>

<P>
Pick up the plank and attach it to the boulder. Now, you'll need to
collect the monitor from another cave. Throw the monitor on the
plank to catapult yourself on the ledge, pick up the magnet and jump
down.
</P>

<P>
Go back to the room where you found the monitor and attach the
string to the magnet. Then throw the magnet down the hole and you
should now get a roll of wire attached to it.
</P>

<P>
Go to the corridor where the mud monster is (it's outside the rock
basher room) and attach the wire to the loops. When the mud monster
charges past, some mud will be left on the wire. Pick up the mud.
</P>

<H4>HOLEY ROOM</H4>

<P>
Alright, you will able to see a number of holes in the walls of the
cave. Look in the holes until you discover a little monster peering
out of one of the other holes. Look in the hole it comes out of and
it should then appear from another hole, look in that hole and so on
until you find some twigs.
</P>

<H4>WELL ROOM</H4>

<P>
Throw the coin into the well and a gameshow host appears, he'll
offer you three prizes; money, a beautiful woman or a helmet. Now I
know this is NOT my first choice or my second for that matter but
take helmet. Now, go to the corridor where the rocks are falling
and wear the helmet.
</P>

<H4>BUCKET ROOM</H4>

<P>
Jump in the bucket and attach the mud to the seaweed, then attach
the twigs to the mud and the seaweed. Don't question me, just do
it! Now all you have to do is wear the mask.
</P>

<H3>PART II</H3>

<H4>BRIDGE</H4>

<P>
A pirate will try to rob you as you walk towards the bridge. As he
falls over pick up the sword and attack him with it. Pick up the
bag of money.
</P>

<H4>THE VILLAGE</H4>

<P>
Go to the Mages Shop shop.Give the magician some money and he'll
teleport you to a cliff edge.
</P>

<H4>CLIFF</H4>

<P>
Walk along the cliffs edge and pick up the gloves in the first
alcove you come across. (just after the falling little monsters)
</P>

<P>
Walk next to the boulder and push it, then jump over the boulder.
Be careful, there is a large boulder which falls on you just after
you've jumped across.
</P>

<P>
Next, you'll see four buttons on the wall. Push the buttons in this
order, button 1, 2 and 4 - this will cause a bridge to appear.
</P>

<P>
Walk over the bridge and pick up the rope. Walk next to the blue
guy and wear the gloves, you'll automatically push him off allowing
you to get past.
</P>

<P>
This bit is a bit tricky, wait until the rocks stop falling and walk
to the first alcove. Wait until the rocks stop falling again and
then walk to the next alcove and pick up the chewing gum.
</P>

<P>
Now, walk on until you reach a gap. Wear the chewing gum to catch a
rock which falls on your head. Throw the rock, then walk across the
stone slab which you've knocked down.
</P>

<P>
When you come to the next huge gap throw the rope and then jump on
rope to climb across. Once you reached the other side look at the
carving on the wall and continue walking until you reach the end of
the cliff edge, shout `open sesame'. Walk into the cave and talk to
the parrot.
</P>

<H4>VILLAGE</H4>

<P>
Go and visit Sally See All and give her some money to tell your
fortune.
</P>

<P>
Go to Benn's Costume Shop and give him some money, he'll give you a
dress, walk into the changing room and try on the dress. Walk
through the open door.

</P>

<P>
Wear the spray and go to the igloo.Give the fish to the Eskimo and
pick up the fishing rod.
</P>

<P>
Go to the block of ice and click on the defend icon, and then on the
fishing rod to make a fire and melt the ice. Pick up the food next
to the puddle of water (I Think it's food, its a grey blob??).
</P>

<P>
Go to the monster and pick up the snowballs next to him. Stand next
to him and throw a snowball at him. Now, go to the walrus and have
a chat with him.
</P>

<P>
Now, go to the cliff (top right) and the walrus should now be asleep
next to the cliff edge, allowing you to cross over to the far ledge.
Walk over him and shout help.
</P>

<P>
Throw the food into the the water, a monster will appear and give
you a ride to the ice palace.

</P>

<H4>ICE QUEEN</H4>

<P>
Make your way to the throne. The queen will fire bolts of ice at
you. When she turns yellow in colour she's about to fire, all you
have to do is jump up to avoid them.
</P>

<H4>HAND</H4>

<P>
When the big meaty hand grabs you, just wear the sun tan lotion to
slip through its fingers to escape!
</P>

<H4>MAZE</H4>

<P>
Make your way through the maze, making sure to pick up the box of
matches on your way.
</P>

<H4>TROLL</H4>

<P>
Okie dokie, this bit is a bit tricky and I advise you to use the
joystick to control him. O.k move behind the pillar in the middle
of the room so the troll can't see you...the troll should now fall
asleep.
</P>

<P>
Walk over to the troll, be careful not to stand on any loose tiles
as they'll make a noise and wake up the troll. The route I found to
be the easiest is to go up around the pillar and straight across the
room.
</P>

<P>
Attach the match to the troll's foot and then click on the defend
icon and then on the matchbox to light the match.Pick up the fire
extinguisher and Benn will appear and take you back to the village.
</P>

<H3>PART III</H3>

<H4>VILLAGE</H4>

<P>
Go to the Mage's shop and give him some money, in exchange he'll
give you a pig mask.
</P>

<P>
Now, you will be able to walk past the guard by Sally See All's.
</P>

<H4>VALLEY OF THE LOST</H4>

<P>
Look behind the haystack to discover a piece of straw. Walk left to
the erupting volcano and pickup the tray. Be careful not to be
fried by the falling lava.
</P>

<P>
Go to the nose and insert piece of straw into it to make him sneeze.
Now that you got rid of the nose look at the pile at the bottom of
the screen, pick up the fountain pen and the stamp.
</P>

<P>
Walk on over to the pile of washing and pick up the sock.
</P>

<P>
Go to the pile of tapes next to the shipwreck and pick up a blank
tape. Walk over to the huge pile of gold and attach the gold coin
to the sock.
</P>

<P>
Now, go to the screen where there was a pair of lips and pick up the
remote control.
</P>

<P>
Go back to the letter box and pick up the letter. Attach the stamp
to the letter and post the letter. Go the tape recorder and insert
the tape into it. Make sure you're standing close to the machine
and push/pull the remote control.
</P>

<P>
Now, go to the guy with the ghetto-blaster and give him the tape,
he'll give you a magnetic keycard and disappear. Go into the cave
and stand by the far wall, shout `help' and pick up the bottle.
</P>

<P>
Alright, go to the locked door next to the band and insert the
keycard into the slot.
</P>

<P>
Now, this bit is a tiny bit tricky and might be easier with the
joystick. Notice the bag at the left of the screen, well all you
have to do to get it is use the wind to blow you towards it. Walk
left towards the bag until the wind starts to blow you back, then
move right until the wind starts to blow you back again, this time
you should be able to get close enough to the bag to pick it up.
</P>

<P>
Remember the robot guarding the shipwreck? Go up to him and hit him
with the sock filled with gold.
</P>

<P>
This bit is very hard to explain through text alone but here it
goes. Pick up one of the planks and walk to the middle of the
screen, as close to the waters edge as possible... you'll have to
be pixel accurate with this but the place you should be standing,
roughly, is where the sand starts to dip inwards in a curved shape.
Push/pull plank and our hero should lay the plank horizontally
ACROSS the sand-if he lays the plank down vertically towards you
you're in the wrong spot. Once you've laid the first plank
correctly pick up the second plank, stand in the middle of the first
plank. Push/pull plank and he'll lay the plank across the water to
the other side allowing you to cross. Cross the plank and pick up
the rag near the bag of the ship.
</P>

<P>
Go back to the screen where the cave is and a door will appear, walk
through it.
</P>

<P>
Stand by the patch on the wall at the top, throw the bottle and then
push/pull the rag to reveal a button. Push the button to raise the
gate. Walk up to the circuit board and throw the bag.Throw the tray
and once you're over the circuit board pick up the fan and pick the
lock with the paper clip. Make your way to the village.
</P>

<H3>PART IV</H3>

<H4>VILLAGE</H4>

<P>
Go to the Mage's shop and give him some more money.
</P>

<H4>GRAVEYARD</H4>

<P>
Pick up the bone and click on the push/pull icon and then on the
bone to dig your way out of the grave.
</P>

<P>
Pick up the shovel. Now, when the vampire runs at you move quickly
to the left and he'll fall into the grave.
</P>

<P>
Walk around the graveyard and pick up the crucifix, silver plate,
hoover and the symbols.
</P>

<P>
Now, the vampire will re-appear by one of the graves, stand behind
him and attack him with the shovel.
</P>

<P>
Now, he'll re-appear behind a tombstone, push the tomb on him. Go
back to the left side of the graveyard and pick up the garlic bread.
</P>

<P>
Make your way to the gates (to the right side of the graveyard).
The vampire will appear in front of the arch, eat the garlic bread.
</P>

<P>
Keep on walking, you bump into the vampire behind the tree. Attack
him with the crucifix.
</P>

<P>
Now stand in front of the closed gates and the vampire will appear
behind you. Stand behind him and attack him with the symbols, go
back to gate. The vampire will now open the gates allowing you to
continue.
</P>

<H4>CASTLE GATES</H4>

<P>
Walk up to the gates and push them open, carry on walking towards
the castle.
</P>

<H4>CASTLE</H4>

<P>
Go to the room on the left and walk over to the far wall and pick up
the ring (just in front of the little alcove).
</P>

<P>
Now, walk over to the library (the room on the right). The bookcase
at the back of the third aisle is false, just walk through it.
</P>

<H4>EVIL QUEEN</H4>

<P>
Defend yourself with the hoover when the ghost appears.
</P>

<P>

fire.
