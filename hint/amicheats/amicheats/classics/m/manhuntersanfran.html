<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
A plague of terrifying Orbs has overrun San Francisco, spreading
horror, tyranny and death. You are their pawn - a manhunter. Hunt
your own kind for the alien masters in this thrilling and horrifying
adventure game. Risk your life by turning against the Orbs to work
for the cause to free humanity.
</P>

<H2>SOLVE</H2>

<P>
You do not have to type in actual commands as in other sierra games.
You can move around with the arrow keys or use an joystick.
Directions are given as north, east, south, west, left, right,
forward, backward or travel (when needed). Some of the actions in
the game are activated by function keys, they will be shown as 'F1'
.. 'F10', or 'TAB' as the TAB key.
</P>

<P>
It is not our intension to give you a complete read out of the
people you can follow with tracker that's in the MAD. Instead we
will give all the locations that you can visit on that day, if you
track ALL the people.
</P>

<P>
Note down the hints you get, such as partial names, drawings
markings etc, etc. If you have trouble playing the arcade sequences
try using 'ESC' and go to easy arcade.
</P>

<P>
Remember, every time you die the arcade sequence will be reset to
hard!
</P>

<P>
Save your game as much as you like. It will prove to be the best
approach in case that you have forgotten something or worse you DIE!
</P>

<H3>DAY 1</H3>

<P>
You start day one in the spaceship, chasing phil. You crash into a
building (watch the corners), and make an emergency landing. You
see youself coming out of the ship (you can tell by the 3 on the
screen). To the left you can see a man lying under the ship. The
game is hardly 2 minutes underway and there's the first corps
already. Seems to be a tradition with the manhunter series. Don't
be afraid, many will follow.
</P>

<P>
Now move to the man lying under the ship. Move to take the ID card
and the manhunter assignment device (MAD). Use the INFO on the MAD
to type in the name on the ID card. Exit the info by typing "BYE"
and go to the tracker. Now track everyone you see.
</P>

<P> 
If you have done this properly you can visit the next locations:
</P>

<UL> 
<LI>The scene of the crash
<LI>Bank of canton
<LI>Warehouse
<LI>Ferry building
<LI>Embarcadero fountain
<LI>Hyde street pier
<LI>Manhunter appartment
</UL>

<P> 
(There will be more places you can visit, but first you must gather
some equipment an clues).
</P>

<P>
Exit the MAD and use 'F3' to travel to the manhunter appartment. In
the appartment open the drawer and get the cloth. (Note the hint on
it). Look out the windows and move arround to see some locations.
</P>

<P>
Now travel to the Warehouse and enter it. Play the game and enter
the room on the bottom left. Get the mallet right next of the desk
(look at the fish on the mallet). Move over to the desk and note
the writing on the desk.
</P>

<P>
Leave the Warehouse and travel to the Bank of canton. Enter the
tunnel. Look at the corps and take the note from the desk right of
the man. Get the piece of newspaper left on the desk. Note the
words on the glass door. BAT VOMIT. Never new bats could throw up.
(must have been something he ate). Just reverse the letters, and
there you have a name: "TAD TIMOV". Enter your MAD and enter the
name.
</P>

<P>
Leave the bank and move to the left. There's a dead man lying
there. You can look at his hand and his body. Take the fang from
his neck and take the laundry receipt. Leave this scene and travel
to the Embarcadero fountain.
</P>

<P>
Go into the fountain. You must press enter to spinout and reach the
tunnel on the right. Once in the tunnel you will have to fight of
rats. Just stand there and wait for the rats to come (put it on
easy arcade!).
</P>

<P>
If you have killed all the rats move to the right. Get the drivers
license from near the bed (note the name), and look at the corps.
Take The flask. Go to the MAD and enter the name of "MIC STONE".
Leave the fountain and travel to the Ferry building.
</P>

<P>
Look at the poster on the right wall. Leave the building and travel
to the Hyde street pier. Look at the fence, move to the left down
the stairs. Move the ( 3 ) under the pier and climb the pole.
Climb back and move to the tunnel on the right. Enter it. Don't
worry you'll survive (remember, you MUST have been eaten by the rat,
so don't restore the game).
</P>

<P>
Leave the pier and travel to TAD TIMOV'S appartment. Enter it. You
will be eaten by the dog. This is also nessecary. Now leave the
appartment. You will get an orb override and you must enter the two
names. END OF DAY ONE.
</P>

<H3>DAY 2</H3>

<P>
You are given the assignment to investigate a burning boat at pier
5. Travel there and track everyone. (There are a lot to track!)
</P>

<P> 
If you have done this properly you can visit the next locations:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>Pier 5
<LI>The temple
<LI>The shop
<LI>Transamerica pyramid
<LI>Dr's house
<LI>Laundry
<LI>Cable car barn
<LI>Private club
</UL>

<P>
There are more locations,but you will be able to visit them as you
gather more information and clues.
</P>

<P>
Now travel to Pier 5 and look at the boat. Look at the corps. Get
the muzzle. Move the arrow to the mouth of the creature. A broken
fang, how nice, use 'TAB', go to fang and press 'ENTER'. A perfect
fit.
</P>

<P>
Travel to TAD TIMOV'S appartment and enter it. When the dog attacks
you, use 'TAB' and use the muzzle. The dog is now harmless.
</P>

<P>
Get the camera from the bench. You have just one flash, so don't
spoil it. It may save your life someday! Look at the painting on
the left wall. HEAVEN VISION. Note the signs on it:
</P>

<P> 
Leave and travel to The temple. Move to the right open the door and
go to the man. Rememember the HEAVEN VISION SIGNS?. Take four
pinches from the second pot on the LEFT. Move to the pipe and smoke
it, then press 'ENTER'.
</P>

<P>
Watch the HEAVEN VISION of the girl turning into a monster. Get the
statue and look at the inscription. Leave the man and enter the
temple. Walk to the shield and get it. Play the game.
</P>

<P>
Now walk under the statue. You are now at the stairs. Use 'TAB'
and look at the dragon note. Seems to be some sort of code.
Guessed it already?. NO!
</P>

<P>
Well here's the explanation. The R3 is the L1 to R4. Just look at
the staue third from the right. Just look at the staue first from
the left. Just look at the staue fourth from the right.
</P>

<P>
The message is: The castle is the gateway to hell. Use 'TAB' and
look at the cloth. Read the text. Let's do just that. Go to the
second statue on the right and look at it. Use 'TAB' and use the
cloth. Watch the puzzle.
</P>

<P>
F oar P ruler.<BR>
For orb ruler, or something like that.
</P>

<P>
Now walk up the stairs. Play the acid game. (No we're not into new
beat, we're into the heavy stuff.) If you finish the game you will
find yourself in the ninja initiation room.
</P>

<P>
Watch the man in front of you get branded. When it is your turn
move the arrow to the box behind the man. Get one of the scrolls.
Now move the arrow to the right and jump out of the window. Note
WEST on the scroll. It could be a direction, but it is part of a
name. Enter the name "ZAC WEST" in your MAD.
</P>

<P>
Now you have another location you can travel to. Travel to The
transamerica pyramid. Move to the base of the pyramid and enter it.
Look at the wall on the right and get the gun. Enter the pyramid
again and move to the robot. Play the game.
</P>

<P>
It's a little bit tricky but it can be done. After finishing the
game and freeing the slave that the robot was beating up, travel to
the laudry and try to enter it. It is closed today, maybe it's open
tomorrow.
</P>

<P>
Travel to the docter's house and enter it. Look at the man on the
table, he's missing an arm. Move to the room at the back and look
at the man. Get the letter from his pocket. Note the name on it.
Now you have another name. Use MAD to enter it. ("NOAH GORING")
</P>

<P>
Look at the test tube on the desk. Use 'TAB' and use the empty
flask. It's now full. Mmmm a nice appetiser. Leave the docter's
house and travel to the scientists house (noah goring).
</P>

<P>
Look at the window. You can see coit tower and alcatraz and julius
castle. Remember that the gateway to hell is the castle. Maybe
this is it!.
</P>

<P>
Move to the table and notice the needle and thread. Somebody has
done some handy work here. Get the matchbook. Look at the files on
the floor and read them all. Travel to the wax museum and go to the
wax figure there. Remember the fish on the mallet?. Use 'TAB' and
use the mallet.
</P>

<P>
Press the button and watch the show. Move to the left. Just look
at this picture. Nothing to do here YET. Move left and climb up
the chimney. ZAC'S HOUSE. Leave the wax museum and travel to the
cable car barn and enter it.
</P>

<P>
Hitch a ride on the next available car. You're now in the cable car
barn game.
</P>

<P>
As you have seen when you tracked the person going here, he went to
the right side of a block, top row, farmost right. (If you don't
now what we mean track this scene again and watch carefully.) Don't
touch any other blocks or you'll be dead. And watch the robots.
Now flip the switch on that block and walk through the door on the
bottom righthand side of the screen. Look at the posters and look
at the dead man. Get the letter from the belt. Now go back and
leave the cable car barn.
</P>

<P>
Travel to the shop and note what the man has got in his hand. It's
a rat's finger. Leave the shop and select travel. You now get an
orb override. Enter the two names you've found. END OF DAY TWO.
</P>

<H3>DAY 3</H3>

<P>
You are given the assignment to investigate a human on the
chirardelli square. Track everyone.
</P>

<P> 
If you have done this properly you can visit the next location.
</P>

<P>
Travel to the chirardelli square. Move to the alley and get the
rats paw. Enter the alley.
</P>

<P>
After being revived again travel to the laundry. It's open now.
Show the laundry receipt to the girl there. Watch the show.
</P>

<P>
You are set free by the slave that you freed from the transamerica
pyramid. Get the walking stick and leave. Travel to the shop and
enter it. Give the rat paw to the man. At least he seems to like
it. Play the card game until you can get the rat masks as price.
Take the rat mask on the left. This is rat mask 1. (Tip: wait
until the cards are shuffled. Save the game. Pick one card. If
it's the wrong one restore and try another one. Do this if you
can't win.)
</P>

<P>
Leave the shop and travel to the wax museum. Hit the fish over the
head with the mallet. (Don't worry he's made out of wax so he never
gets a headache.)
</P>

<P>
Go to the middle screen. Look at the fresh meat on the pile. Take
a closer look. It's noah goring. Look at his tie. Remember the
needle and thread in his appartment. Use the fang to cut the tie.
Get the card.
</P>

<P>
Go to the left and climb up the chimney. Just intime for desert.
Don't restore but leave the wax museum and travel to the private
club. Take a closer look at the door and wear the rat mask. Knock
and you will go into the club.
</P>

<P>
Now you have to play with the dice. Look at the arm that the rat
shows you. Remember the signs on it. (Write them down.) When it's
your turn to play the rats will unmask you. When they do, use the
flask to distract their attention. Get the hatchet and leave the
club.
</P>

<P>
Travel to chirardelli square. Climb up the rope and go to the
right. There's a man hanging from the sign and he's throwing things
at you. This man has a ring on his neck and you must get it. In
order to get to him you must climb the sign. You must get very
close to him and use the walking stick to get the ring. When you've
got the ring you can just let yourself drop on the ground.
</P>

<P>
Now enter the window on the left. Use the ring to open the gate.
Phil is aware of your presence because he has the viewer. When you
move through the tunnel you will fall. When you drop into phil's
kingdom,, you will drop right ontop of him, ripping off his arm. He
also drops something. Get this. It's an orb on a stick .
</P>

<P>
When phil throws you into the rat pit use the camera to blind the
rats. Once on the pier descend the stairs and go under the pier.
Climb the pole and use the hatchet to make a hole. Now you're in
for a pretty long show.
</P>

<P>
Once in the warehouse use the hatchet to free yourself from the
crate. You find yourself in some sort of a detention block. Look
at the prisoner second from the middle row. Looks familiar, eh?
</P>

<P>
It's the girl who has turned into a mutant from the HEAVEN VISION.
Give the statue to her. If the mutant cries you've got the right
one. Now move to the left and take a look at the cell door machine.
Use the orb card to open it and use the orb-on-a-stick to fool the
camera. You are carried away buy the girl mutant.
</P>

<P>
When you are in the balloon take a closer look at the burner. Pull
the handle and use the matchbook to light the fire. Enjoy your
flight. And now for some serious landing.
</P>

<P>
Remember that the gateway to hell is the castle? Well when you are
flying over the city you can see coit tower on the right side of the
screen. Left from it is a castle. You have to land exactely on top
of it. Now you have reached hell. Look at the screen. At the left
you will see:
</P>

<P>
lava button<BR>
slave button<BR>
robot button
</P>

<P>
The object of this game is to kill the robots with lava and save the
slaves. Think this is hard, just watch the next game. We will try
to explain how to pull this off. If it doesn't work don't blame us,
try solving it yourself.
</P>

<P>
On the map you can see lava lakes, pipes, lava doors(green), little
rooms and three bigger rooms. Named HELL, FREEDOM and SLAVERY.
</P>

<P>
Move to the slave button and press it. Look where the slaves are.
Move to the robot button and press it. Look where the robots are.
Move all the robots to a room where there are NO slaves. You can
use the room above the FREEDOM room. If you have done that close
ALL the lava doors. The closed doors are represented by an *. Move
to the slave button and press it. Move ALL the slaves to the
SLAVERY room. Move to the robot button and press it. Move ALL the
robots in the room above the FREEDOM room to the little room on the
bottom of the screen. (Just above the lava lake at the bottom.) You
can recognize it by a pipe sticking out of the bottom with a dead
end. Now switch to lava again. Move to the top of the screen. You
can see the city there and the buildings. Move to the building
named: bank of america headquarters. Just below it you can see a
lava door. Direct under that lava door you see another lava door.
Open that one. Move to the bottom of the screen and open the lava
door above the room where you have put all the robots in. (The one
with the dead end pipe.) Now move a bit down and to the right and
open the final lava door. If all goes well you have killed the
robots and saved the slaves.
</P>

<P>
After the show is over move to the slave button and press it. Move
the slaves from SLAVERY to HELL (where you are). The slaves will
come and pick you up and carry you to FREEDOM. They will put you in
somesort of a giant drill. Remember the markihgs on the mans arm
that the rat showed you. Enter them on the screen. Press the big
red button above it and look at the map below.
</P>

<P> 
And now we can not help you anymore. You're on your own now. This
is the lava maze. You have to find a way through the maze and come
up in the city. The exit is two screens to the right and one up, in
the top corner right.WE FOUND THE EXIT, AND SO CAN YOU.
</P>

<P>
If you are out of the lava maze you will see phil escaping in his
ship. Watch this. Press 'ENTER' to continue and look at the middle
of the screen.
</P>
