<H2>CHEATS</H2>

<P>
Wait for the demo to start and type "PROFMANIAC". The screen will
flash letting you know it worked. This will give you infinite lives
and the ability to start at any level.
</P>

<P>
NOTE: The demo starts right after the highscore table is displayed.
</P>

<H2>SOLVE</H2>

<P>
CHEMISTRY LAB: From the starting screen, head left and trip the
switch that you find there. This turns off some of the deadly
electrical devices and allows you to enter a previously inaccessible
screen. Go up the ladder and walk to the left, then use the
conveyor belt to fall down and collect the crowbar.
</P>

<P>
Next make your way to the auto ladder. Use the crowbar and jump on
the lever three times.
</P>

<P>
Go up and collect the jam jar, before returning down and heading
right to where the other jar is. Go down two levels and head right.
Use the jam jars, and you will be able to read the tiny password and
pass through the locked door. Go right. Collect the hammer and
take it up to the top level.
</P>

<P>
Head left and collect the phial (there's a clue about a "strong
aroma"), and head down to where the 'test your strength' machine is.
Use the potion and the hammer and you will ring the bell, revealing
an oil can as your prize. Take this up to the top-right hand screen
and use it on the pipe and, voila, you have completed the level!
