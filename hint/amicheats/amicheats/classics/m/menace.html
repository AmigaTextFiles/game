<P>
This one's a bit tricky - type "XR31TURBONUTTERBASTARD" while the
game is in progress. try doing that without getting killed off! You
should now have a large supply of shields, cannon and lasers. They
will run out eventually so you have to type it in again.
</P>

<P>
Another cheat file lists the code with spaces between words! Type
"XR31 TURBO NUTTER BASTARD" and hit keys 1-6 to select a level.
Then press RETURN for extra weapons.
