<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
You must protect the Midwinter Isle, the last habitable oasis on
earth. Controlling up to 32 characters, you must defend an immense
playing area of over 160,000 square miles. You can ski, hang glide,
snow buggy, or travel by cable car across stunning glacial
landscape, shooting, sniping, and sabotaging the intruders.
Featuring a unique 3-D fully light-sourced graphics system and
unprecedented action sequences. Midwinter will keep you locked in
the Ice Age for a long time.

<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
If you start every game by clicking the mouse in exactly the same
place on the start screen, every game will be set up identically.
</P>

<P>
Don't bother with the tedious procedures of recruitment, just head
straight for enemy hq with some dynamite and introduce them to Mr.
Big explosion.
</P>

<P>
When you are on skis.  Don't stop to snipe.  Get as quickly as you
can to the nearest garage.  You need missiles against the bombers.
Try to get a Wolf snow-buggy.  You can dodge the mortars on skis the
same way as on a buggy:  turn quickly 90 degrees and speed off.  If
you stop to snipe, the mortars will get you.  When you get the
snow-buggy speed to your next point while blasting the bombers as
they appear.
</P>

<P>
Invulnerablity against missiles: Whether you are skiing or driving
a now-buggy, the moment you hear the missile being launched, stop
immediately and begin to turn around. Keep turning on the spot.
The missile will narrowly miss you then come back and keep pace
alongside you for a while until it finally speeds off to clobber
someone else not so smart.
</P>

<P>
Invulnerablity against mortars: Watch for the bomber. It will
always come over the horizon in front of you. If you are stopped,
wait until it is approximately half way to you (otherwise it may be
able to dodge your missile) then blast it. If you are moving fast
blast it the moment it appears over the horizon. If the bomber does
manage to drop mortars turn 90 degrees quickly and speed off.
