<H2>CHEATS</H2>

<P>
There are two introduction sequences available, depending whether
you hit the 'RED' or 'GREEN' button.
</P>

<P>
Sometimes you need to warp back to a junction because you took the
wrong branch or because of an endless loop you are flying in. Just
move to the map and place the outlined rectangle to the red mark you
want to warp to (place it with the 'YELLOW' or 'BLUE' button). To
actually warp press the 'GREEN' button while you are on the map.
</P>

<P>
Press 'PAUSE' after the game started (when your about to enter the
Pod Bay). Then enter one of the following combinations:
</P>

<P>
GREEN, BLUE, YELLOW, RED, YELLOW, DOWN, GREEN, RIGHT, RED, UP
</P>

<P>
or
</P>

<P>
RED, GREEN, BLUE, YELLOW, DOWN, DOWN, BLUE, DOWN, RIGHT, BLUE
</P>

<P>
or
</P>

<P>
YELLOW, RED, GREEN, BLUE, UP, LEFT
</P>

<P>
or
</P>

<P>
BLUE, YELLOW, RED, GREEN, BLUE, LEFT
</P>

<P>
The Title screen will turn black and white and the cheat will be
activated. With this cheat, you're invulnerable; you can also warp
around the map and have all the guns on the next level you play. To
warp around the map, simply bring the map up. There's a solid white
block displaying your location and another outlineed block, press
either the Blue or the Yellow button; to warp to that point, press
the Green button. The only drawback to this cheat is that all the
amazing cut sequences are in black and white. There are various
other codes which do the same thing at different parts of the game.
You can find these by pausing the game and pressing all the buttons
until you find one that makes a different sound to the others.
Press it then you have to find the next one that makes the same
noise. Keep doing this until it makes that noise and the cut
sequences are in black and white.
</P>

<P>
Also, at the start of level one, turn right and at the next
crossroads push up. Pause the game, press Yellow, Red, Green, Blue,
Up and Left. Unpause and you'll be completely invincible.

<P>
It seems that Psygnosis has put some music on the CD not used in
MICROCOSM. Just try track 2 from the game CD on your audio CD
player.
</P>

<P>
When you are walking into the pod base, try pressing the
LEFT button and keep it pressed until you arrive at the crossway.
Now all the level maps are upside-down.
