<P>
Enter "SEMPRINI" into the high score table. A couple of new options
will then appear on the main options page. The first will allow you
to select and start on any level up to the highest one you reached,
and the second option will allow you to show/hide the hidden
bonuses.

<P>
Enter your name in as "POOKY". Now when you next view the high
scores it will change to "NO IT ISN'T!". I think this is a joke from
the programmer who was also responsible for the Rick Dangerous
games.
