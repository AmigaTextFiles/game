<TT>

<H2>SOLVE</H2>

<P>
The basic premise behind Mechwarrior is that you're the only
surviving son of the leader of Ander's Moon. A group of Mechs
attacked the planet, killed your family, and installed a new
government on the planet. They also stole a valuable Chalice which
is a heirloom of family power or something. Your job is to track
down the killers, find the Chalice, and restore your family to power
on Ander's Moon.
</P>

<P>
When you start out, you will usually be on one of the Davion
planets, but might start out on a Kurita planet. Travel immediately
to the Kurita planet of Land's End.
</P>

<P>
When you get to Land's End, enter the bar and order a drink. The
barkeep will tell you to come back later. Go to the mech complex
and sell your Jenner, as you won't need it for a while, and can make
a nice profit here. Besides, it will be a lot more expensive to
haul it along with you where you're going.
</P>

<P>
Go back to the bar. The ruffian you meet there will tell you "Grig
can be found on...". Make a note of the planet he gives you and go
there. I have seen New Samarkand, Tabayama, and Delacruz often. It
will always be a Kurita world.
</P>

<P>
When you get there, you will meet Grig. Accept his mission to
deliver a packet to his agent on Dustball, and go there. Dustball
is a Steiner world.
</P>

<P>
When you get to Dustball, there will be a little scuffle. You can
either FIGHT then RUN, or RUN then RUN. Just make sure that you RUN
the second time. After that, go to the bar and order a drink. The
barkeeper will tell you to return later, but you can just order
another drink and he'll give you some information and the name of a
Marik planet, such as Gibson, Mosiro, or Sadurni. Travel there.
</P>

<P>
When you arrive on the Marik planet, go to the Mech complex. The
man there will tell you that you might find Kangaroo Jack on
Tancredi IV or Okefenokee (Davion planets). When you leave, you
will be shot at by a sniper. RUN.
</P>

<P>
When you get to the Davion planet, go to the bar. Order a drink,
and you'll be introduced to a guy named Kearny. He'll give you some
information, and a scrap of paper with an address on it, telling you
to meet him there. When you leave the bar, go ahead and follow the
address. Then HIDE and FIGHT.
</P>

<P>
When you finish that, read the news net. You'll note a few news
items in which you were involved. You'll also get a message from
Jordan Rowe, telling you where the Black Widows currently are.
That's your next destination. It will be a Kurita world like
Thestria or Proserpina.
</P>

<P>
When you get there, go into the bar. You'll see some of the Black
Widows, and get a story. CHALLENGE it.
</P>

<P>
You'll get in a fight, and some woman named Tasha will save your
butt. She'll tell you that Matabushi is your enemy, not the Black
Widows, and that Kearny was just trying to get you killed. Go ahead
and leave the bar.
</P>

<P>
If you read the news net, you'll see that Tasha gave you some files
supposedly from Matabushi telling about your family's execution.
Read on, and you'll find something about Matabushi announcing a new
commercial strategy. Another news item from Jordan Rowe will tell
you to meet up with Kearney on Albiero. Go there.
</P>

<P>
When you get there, you'll land in the middle of a battle, and see
Tasha. Follow her. You will see Tasha and Kearny confronting each
other, and have to decide whom to trust. I would suggest you trust
Tasha.
</P>

<P>
When the smoke clears, Tasha will give you a data disk explaining
the action which killed your family, and who was behind it. She'll
also give you five million bucks, which isn't too bad. She'll tell
you that the Chalice you're after is on a Kurita planet called
Kirchbach (as far as I know, this is always the same) guarded by
four Battlemasters and one Warhammer.
</P>

<P>
Another loose end to tie up is Grig. Head to the planet where you
first found him (New Samarkind, Delacruz, or Tabayama) and you'll
meet a bum. Ask him to GO ON with his story. Make a DEAL with him.
</P>

<P>
When you see Grig, WAIT for the situation to improve. You'll get a
chance when there are only two guards with him, STRIKE now. He'll
try to make a deal with you. Don't go for it, and PULL THE TRIGGER.
You'll pocket some easy cash.
</P>

<P>
You've now done everything you need to do except get the Chalice
back. The above actions should have taken about a year of game
time, meaning you've got about four more years to go. You should
have about 10.5 million bucks, so go ahead and invest in some mechs
and crew. SAVE THE GAME before you try to hire any crewmembers,
because the game will sometimes crash when you do.
</P>

<P>
You'll want to end up with a good crew and some good mechs, I would
suggest you get four Battlemasters. You'll need money for this.
</P>

<P>
Go around buying Mechs at industrial planets and
Mech-manufacturing planets (such as Alshain (Kurita), Herperus II
(Steiner), Calloway VI (Marik), Ares (Liao), and Marduk (Davion).
Other good planets include Amity, Alderbaran, and Galax. Buy mechs
at these planets, and travel to various backwater and out of the way
places like Land's End and Baxley. There are a huge number of these
planets. Anyway, you can sell Mechs at these places for a nice
profit.
</P>

<P>
Once you get cash, hire a crew and start practicing doing jobs for
the various houses. When your crew gets good enough, go to
Kirchbach and kick some butt.
</P>

<P>
End of game.
