<H2>SOLVE</H2>

<P>
Well, here we are again, all set for another adventure, but without
any elfin swords or magic lamps.  You awake on a deserted island
suffering from amnesia.  Your mission, if you accept, is to save
yourself and to regain your memory.
</P>

<P>
There are a few tricky puzzles to solve and saving the game at
various spots is recommended.  Also, as in other adventure games, it
is a good idea to map your surroundings.  The graphics are adequate
and the parser, although not as good as Infocom's, does work.
Remember to examine and search everything you find in your journey.
There are two unique commands built into this game.  The most
critical function is the "THINK" command.  When a clue is found,
type in the word THINK (followed by the clue that you found) and
hope for the best.  If you haven't thought enough you'll never solve
the game.  The other command is the "HELP CONDOR" function.  The
game has a help list built into the program that you can call on if
you need a push in the right direction.  The only problem is that it
can be called up only three times during the game.  After that you
are on your own.  Let's get started.
</P>

<P>
You awake on a deserted beach with a spectacular view of the ocean.
In fact, look at the ocean but don't go in the water.  Go North,
then enter the hut and take some straw.  Examine the trash can and
take the candle.  Well, you don't really need it.
</P>

<P>
Exit the hut then go East.  Take a piece of steel from the dory,
then go East again and take a vine.  Go West, West, South, and drop
all but the vine.
</P>

<P>
Go East, and you should be at the edge of a cliff.  Tie the vine to
a rock then go Down.  Enter the cave and examine and search all,
then take a rock from the ground.  Dig in ground.  Take the map,
then East, Up, West.  Look at the map, then North.
</P>

<P>
At this point, you might want to save the game.  Go North, North,
East, North, East, East, South, South, East.  Search the trunk and
take the bottle, but don't drink it.
</P>

<P>
Go West, West, North, West, West, South, West, South, South, South.
Drop the map, then take the piece of steel and the shell.  Listen to
the shell.  Type, "BANG ROCK WITH STEEL OVER STRAW TO MAKE FIRE".
Drop the rock and the piece of steel, then wait.
</P>

<P>
When the boat comes, offer the captain the bottle.  You should now
be on the pirate ship and the captain will have left you alone to go
exploring.  Go North, West, and talk to the doctor.  Go South, then
fight with the man.  Go South again and take the meat cleaver.  You
can also eat the fish if you like sashimi.
</P>

<P>
Go North, North, East, South, South, South, West, then cut the chain
with the meat cleaver.  Go East, North, North, East, East.  You
should now be in England.
</P>

<P>
Go East, East, East, South, and search the sleeping man.  Take the
hat and the money, then go North, West, West, South.  Give the man 5
pounds and take the pole.  Go North, West, and get the debris with
the pole.  Drop the pole, then take the newspaper.  Read it.
Remember to remember.  Go East, North, and talk to the man.  Give
the man 5 pounds and remember the password (it may vary with
different disks).
</P>

<P>
Go South, East, North, East.  This is another good spot to save the
game.  Talk to the woman, then give her the hat.  Go East.  Examine
the drink, then follow the man.
</P>

<P>
Go South, West, then take the hat and look inside the hat.  Rather
then leave a tip, you can kiss the woman.  Go West, North, East,
then type, "CHANDRALT" or whatever the password is in your game.
</P>

<P>
Give the man 200 pounds for your ticket then go West, South, South,
West, North, North, and enter the airplane.  Remember to remember.
You should now be in beautiful downtown Luxembourg.
</P>

<P>
Go North, West, then BOOTH 11.  Talk to the man.  If that doesn't
work, search the man.  Take the note and the ID card, then read both
of them.  Go East, East, North, North, West, Up, North.  This is
another spot to save the game.
</P>

<P>
Go West, then DUCK.  Examine the room and take all.  Read the
parchment.  Go East, South, Down, East, South, and now we are going
on a little nature hike.
</P>

<P>
Go East, East, East, South, and dig in the ground with the shell.
Drop the shell, then take the leaflet and read it.  It sure does
look like a bank account number.  Go North, West, West, West, West,
and talk to the woman.  Type in the bank number then open the box.
Take the gun, then drop the box.
</P>

<P>
Go East, North, West, Up, North, North, North, North.  This is it.
Save the game again, then East.  Shoot the man with the gun, then
take the message and read it.
</P>

<P>
Now, if you have remembered all the names and found all the clues,
you should regain your memory and solve the game by using the THINK
COMMAND.  Type "THINK ARCMAN".  "THINK BOB".  "THINK MASTERS".
"THINK JARED".  "THINK TYCOON".  "THINK LUXEMBOURG".  "THINK
WILLIAM".  At this point, a new screen should appear with the entire
story of your trials and tribulations.
