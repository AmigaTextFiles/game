<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
To get past the dog in the chambers of annubis you must have the eye
of horus from the pyramid level before, if you do not have this then
the level cannot be completed. You must also have the ankh symbol,
four jars and a headress from an egyptian monk (chambers of
annubis). Go to the dog, duck under the ankh symbol on the wall and
then select the ankh symbol, this will recharge your energy. Keep
recharging your energy then whilst your man is flashing colours
select the eye of horus symbol and press fire.
