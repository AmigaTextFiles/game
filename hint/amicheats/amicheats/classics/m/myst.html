<H2>SOLVE</H2>

<P>
There are several way to finish MYST. The easiest is to first
understand MYST Island, and then go to each Age as you discover it.
You can complete MYST in any order. The order that follows is
arranged this way just for my convenience in explaining. You can do
things in any order!
</P>

<P>
You should first go around the Island and flip all the "marker
switches that you see. (There are 7 you can switch and 1 on the
clock tower that you can't. There are 8 all together).
</P>

<P>
As you entered MYST, you may have noticed a "hidden" door that leads
down some steps into a room with a fountain or pool. Go in it and
drain the water from it by pushing the button in front. Then turn
around. You will see a scrap of paper on the wall. On this piece
of paper are three things with three numbers. You can ignore them.
Click on the paper. It opens and shows two numbers. Enter the
number of Marker Switches - 8. Turn back around and click the
button on the pool (known as the "imager"). You will see a message
that Atrus left for his wife, Catherine, telling her of his problem.
You can deduce from his message that your task is to figure out
which of his sons is guilty.
</P>

<H4>THE LIBRARY</H4>

<P>
There is a bookshelf with some ratty looking books. Find it. There
will be 4 legible books. Read them carefully and draw out any
drawing you see in them (Except for the book with only puzzle clues)
Pay attention, there is some good information in those books that
will help later. Then, find the red and blue books. There are
pages laying next to each one. Put the red and blue pages in the
respective books. Click on the book, and you will see a message
from each of of Atrus's sons, Sirrus and Achenar. They both tell
you to find the red and blue pages to set them free. This is the
point of MYST, so listen carefully. In each of the four Ages
(worlds) there is both a red and a blue page. You should get them
both (since you can only carry one page at a time, you'll have to go
twice to each Age). Next, to get the clues you'll need, click on
the map. It should have white outlines of where you have flipped
markers. Start the tower rotation by holding down of where you have
flipped markers. Start the tower rotation by holding down the tower
and watching it rotate. You'll see that when it passes some areas,
the beam turns red. Stop on the red spots! This tells you a book
that leads to another Age is stored there. (Atrus calls them the
"places of protection") Click on the painting that makes the
bookcase drop. Follow the tunnel and elevator to the top of the
tower. There will be two ladders. One with a book and one with a
key. The book ladder shows you where the book is, and the key that
you will need to solve the puzzle that leads you there. What
follows are explanations to each puzzle that take you to each Age.
</P>

<H4>TREE PUZZLE</H4>

<P>
This one is the hardest to figure out, I think, if you don't know
what's going on. The clue for this puzzle is 7,2,4. Inside of the
cabin, there is a safe right beside by the door. 7,2,4 is the
combination that you should use to open it. There is a a match in
it. Light the match, turn around, and go to the boiler. Put the
match in the slot in the bottom left-hand corner. Crank the handle
with the GREEN arrows. Go until you start to hear a loud sound.
Wait until it stops, then crank the wheel back the other way with
the RED arrows. Go again until you hear a loud sound. Go quickly
behind the cabin. You should see an opening in the tree coming down
at you. Climb in the opening. It will take you down. Click on the
book, and go to the Channelwood Age!
</P>

<H4>PUZZLE OF THE SUNKEN SHIP</H4>

<P>
The clues from the tower rotation are: October 11, 1984 10:04 AM,
January 17, 1207 5:46AM, and November 23, 9791 6:57 PM. Go back to
the planetarium and turn the lights off. Sit in the chair and look
up. Enter the dates into the machine. You will see three different
constallations. These will look familiar if you copied down the
constellations written in the books in the Library. These
constellations are matched up with symbols. They are Leaf, Snake,
Bug. If you go back to the tiny sunken ship in the pool, you will
notice pillars with animals and symbols on them. click on the
pictures on the pillars next to the pool. The tiny ship will rise
in the pool and the big one will also rise in the harbor. Go down
to the harbor, go into the cabin. Click on the book, and go to the
Stoneship Age!
</P>

<H4>GEAR PUZZLE</H4>

<P>
The gears are actually opened up by solving the puzzle at the clock
tower, which is in the water. By turning the two wheels or valves
on the shore, you can change the time of the clock. Set the time
for 2:40. A bridge will appear from the water. When you get into
the clock tower, there is a game like a slot machine. You have to
crank right, left, right and quickly pull while the wheels are still
going, so that only the top row moves to get 2,2,1. Return to the
gears, a trap door will open, exposing a book, click on it, and go
to the Mechanical Age!
</P>

<H4>SPACESHIP PUZZLE</H4>

<P>
The hint from the tower is 59 volts. If you go to the generator
room, (it has generators as far as the eye can see and a yellow
light on top of the building). There are 10 buttons that control
the yellow light on top of the building). There are 10 buttons that
control the power. Each one has a different value. Clicking each
one on will either add or subtract that value. There are many, many
combinations that will produce "59". There are also handles behind
the generator building that will reset everything. Now that the
power is on, you can open the Spaceship door. If you kept good
notes at the library, you will remember a piano key diagram. (OR
you can go back to the library now and get it!) There is a keyboard
in the spaceship that is the same as the diagram. 5 notes must be
reproduced in order, first on the keyboard, then on the
lever/control pannel in the nose of the ship. The easiest way to
get the same notes on the lever machine is to count the notes as you
raise the levers. This is tough and will make you mad! Count up
(in order 1-5), 8 notes up, 20, 23, 13, and 6 notes up. Then pull
the lever. It must be exact! It will play the notes. If you did
it right, a light comes on, and the next book appears. Click on it,
and go to the Selenitic Age.
</P>

<P>
You are now ready to proceed to each Age.
</P>

<H3>STONESHIP AGE</H3>

<P>
Go out to the little pump island. There will be three buttons to
click. Touch the one on the right. you will hear an engine type
noise that is the water being drained out of the lighthouse. Go to
this very same lighthouse. There is a small door above your head
when you are just standing in the main room. You will see a key on
the floor. It is on a chain that moves. At this point, you ask
yourself "huh?". If you turn around and look down, you will see a
set a stairs to go down. The chest down there is locked, BUT you
will see a drain of some sort on left hand side of the bottom of the
chest. When you turn it, water comes out. Drain the water, then
turn the handle the other way to close the valve. For you young
Sherlock Holmes', you now realize that a hollow, wood chest will
float! Leave and go back to the pump selector area. Touch again on
the third or right most button. Return to the now flodded
lighthouse. You can see the key on the floor to open the chest, and
take out the key from inside of the chest. This key opens the small
door above your head!
</P>

<P>
Go up and look around. There is a generator with a crank handle.
Turn it until the indicator tells you that the batteries are fully
charged. Go back and choose the second or middle button at the pump
place. Go back to the boat, and turn left. If you go forward six
times, you will see an small panel on the left wall. This one way
to get to a "secret" room. Don't go there yet! Keep going down the
stairs. At the door, press the button and go in. This is a
bedroom. To the right is a desk. (You can open the drawer if you
want-you'll see a curious looking needle). Left is a chest with
drawers. There are things in some of the drawers. We are looking
for drawer number four-it has the RED PAGE! Go back out of the room
and go up the stairs.
</P>

<P>
Go to your left and go down the stairs six times or clicks. Here
there is a small panel located on the wall to the right. This is
another way into the secret room. Go down the stairs all the way,
open the door, and go inside the bedroom. To your left on the bed
is the BLUE NOTE! If you turn around, you will see a chest full of
drawers. Open number six, it has half of the VAULT NOTE! Write
down its contents. Turn around, go out and up the stairs.
</P>

<P>
Find the telescope at the top and look into it. If you point and
click on the picture, you can move it. Click and drag to the left.
There are degree indicators. The three degree's without a picture
of the Island are 115, 135, and 180. This will come in handy! If
you haven't had to do so yet, you may want to consider going back to
the generator and getting a fresh recharge for the batteries. Go
back to the first door (cave-like) we entered on the boat and go
down 6 times or clicks. Remember the secret panel to your left? Go
into it. Walk down the hallway until the open room. If you look
down, you will recognize the rose drawing we saw in the compass.
The 135 degree marking we saw in the compass correlates to this
compass on the floor. Push the arrow button between South and East
(135 degrees!). The lights will come on! Ahead of you is a lamp
underwater. Cool picture. Get all the way out and go to the pump
buttons. Push the first (left) button, and go back to the cabin
door. Go down all of the stairs. At this point, you will see a
table in front of you. If you click on it, the MYST book morphs out
of the table. Open the book and go back home!
</P>

<H3>CHANNELWOOD AGE</H3>

<P>
This world is powered by windmill energy and water. So, before we
can do anything, we need to hook everything up right in the
windmill. To get there,follow these directions: (f=forward,
l=left, etc.)
</P>

<P>
F, F, F, FL, F, FR, F, FL, F, F, F, F
</P>

<P>
If you look down here, you will see a switch, much like the switches
controlling train tracks. Water (which=energy) can only flow to
some places at some times. We will have to throw the switches
correctly in order to power the things we need in this world. We
will use this particular switch as a reference point. I'll refer to
it from now on as the starting switch. Looking forward, you will
see the windmill. Go inside, so we can power up! There should be a
faucet handle at your feet. Turning it will start water flowing.
Energy will now start flowing on Channelwood.
</P>

<P>
HINT: You will be able to hear running water when you are standing
on top pipe that has water flowing through it.
</P>

<P>
Go back outside the windmill to the starting switch. Look down at
the switch, and make sure that the water is flowing to the left. We
can't get to the stairs yet (which we will need) Go: Forward-left,
Forward, Forward , Forward and check the switch. The water should
be going to the right. Foward-right, Forward and check this switch.
Water should be going right. Forward-right, Forward and check this
switch. Water should be going right. Go Forward-right, Forward,
Forward, Forward. A motor will be running. Open the elevator door
and get in. Throw the handle and take off!
</P>

<P>
NOTE: THIS IS TOUGH TO FOLLOW. Go: Forward, Forward-right,
</P>

<P>
Forward-right, Forward, Forward, Right, Forward, Forward, Forward.
From this room (lots of pots laying around) go Right, Forward,
Forward, Forward, Forward. Throw the Switch. In the distance
you'll see something moving. That's where we need to get to. Turn
around 180 degrees. Go Forward, Forward, Forward, Forward. From
this room (again!), go Right, Forward, Forward, Forward-right,
Forward six times, Right, Forward, Forward, Forward, forward down
the stairs. Open the door. Go forward five times. We're back at
the started switch. Change the water to go toward the stairs
(right). Go left, and then forward six times. Climb the stairs,
turn left, and there's the elevator. Flip the switch-it'll take us
to the third floor. Get out on the third floor.
</P>

<P>
Turn around 180 degrees. Go Forward-right, Forward, Forward,
Forward. This is a bedroom of some sort. There is a night stand in
the room with drawers. Go to is. The Red Page is in the left side.
On the right side, you'll find half of a white note-this is a Vault
note. COPY THE INFORMATION DOWN. IT IS VERY IMPORTANT!!! This is
one half of a note, with the other half in Stoneship. Leave the
room and go forward four times, forward-right, and then forward
again four times. This room has some smoke and mirrors, but we're
on our way out! Leave by going out the opposite door you came in.
Go right, forward, forward, forward-left and forward. Enter this
room to find the blue note! There are some messages in this room
using the machine. They are not that important. Go out of the room
and go forward twice, forward-right. Get back to the elevator.
Throwing the switch will get you to the second floor. Go down the
stairs.
</P>

<P>
Start from the starting switch. Change the switch to the left. Go
forward-left, forward, forward, forward. Change this switch so the
water goes right. Go forward-right, and forward. At this switch,
make sure the water is going left. We'll go forward-left and
forward. Go left with the water forward-left and forward get's you
to a bunch of forwards until you see and engine/pump lookin' thing
at the end of the path. Forward-right, forward, Forward, forward.
Flip the switch and watch a magic bridge appear! Follow the path
forward until the elevator. Turn around and trace the pipe left,
until it runs out. Find the crank here and crank it, the pipe will
extend. Turn around, head towards the elevator, but go past it back
to the bridge motor/pump. From here, go forward, forward, forward,
and forward-left. Go forward, forward-right, forward, look down.
Throw the switch to the other side. Turn left. and go to the next
switch. The water should be flowing beneath your feet. Turn
around, go forward, Right, forward, Forward-left, Forward,
Forward-right, and a ton forwards until you reach the elevator. Get
in. shut the door and throw the lever. Open the door and you'll
see the MYST book!
</P>

<H3>MECHANICAL AGE</H3>

<P>
You are facing a gear. Proceed inside the fortress. Go left. As
you enter the room, face the throne. There is a small indentation
on the bottom right-hand corner. If you click on it, a door
appears. Go inside. Inside the bottles is the red page. You can
grab it and skip to the rest of my instructions. To get the blue
page, go into the other room. There is a wierd looking object next
to the throne. It's a simulator. Next to the throne is an
indentation where the blue page is. (Also amoung the rooms on a
wine shelf is a note from Achenar to Sirrus. Achenar claims that
Sirrus is greedy)
</P>

<P>
Go over to the simulator. It demonstrates the rotating of the
Island. Push up the left handle, then the right. Pulling them back
down again after rototating will yield a sound depending on the
degree of rotation. You will need to be familiar with all 4 sounds
for 90, 180, 270, and 360 degrees. 90 degrees sounds like a high
ping, 180 like a spring coiling, 270 like a bird flapping its wings,
and 360 is a dull, hollow, metallic sound.
</P>

<P>
If you retreat into the hallway, you will see a small red button on
the wall. When you click it, the floor drops down. You will see a
display with two upside-down "c"'s. Line them up until they are red
in color. Turn around and go back up the stairs, click the red
button (thus elevating the floor back again). Walk into the
elevator.
</P>

<P>
In the elevator, choose the "up" button. Once on the top floor,
click the middle button and hurry and get out of the elevator. It
will descend the half a floor and you can climb in top of it. There
are controls on top of the elevator. You can now rotate the
fortress by pushing first the left and then the right lever,
waiting, and then pulling them both back down to check your
progress. You need to move it 180 degrees. (Spring coiling sound)
</P>

<P>
Rotate the island 180 degrees and 90 degrees to get to those
respective islands. Each one holds 2 of the 4 symbols that you will
need to enter to get back to MYST. There really isn't anything on
the islands but the symbols. (remember, the second time around to
get the page you didn't get before-don't move the fortress! Just
grab the page and enter the symbols. It's still the same!) Once you
have the 4 symbols, simply enter them into the machine on the
original island you started at (yes you have to move the fortress
back!). The symbols are: 1. upside down "c", 2. opposite
pointing triangles flanking a retangular box, 3. three small
triangles pointing up towards a ball, and 4. the left side half of
a full moon. Hit the red button, and the MYST book appears. Click
and get home!
</P>

<H3>SELENITIC AGE</H3>

<P>
You start in the spaceship. After you step off the path, you pass a
door on your right. Two clicks forward from the door, turn and face
left. If you follow the path, you will come to a small creek or
stream that you can hear. There is both a button to press, and the
blue page here. The button turns on a microphone. There are 5
microphones in all, and 5 different symbols for each. Get back on
the main path. Go up the the stairs in front and to the left of
you. Click on the button at the top of these stairs. You can hear
the volcano like chasm. Get back on the path and go until the large
clock. Click on this microphone. Continue forward and take a right
at the fork. Continue down the path, down some stairs, and find a
mike for a tower looking symbol. You will find the red page here.
Retrace your steps back to the fork. Go right. You will find the
final button to click at the wind symbol.
</P>

<P>
There is ladder here, go down it. Turn on the light. Turn around
and walk down the tunnel. Climb the ladder, and climb the stairs.
There will be a box looking thing with metal doors. Click it to
open. There are tuner buttons, 5 symbol buttons, and a "sigma" or
playback button. The object here is to "tune" in the sounds of each
object with where they are on the display. You can do this by hand,
letting the display tell you when you are close (the hand will blink
a lot). Or, you can enter the following numbers. To enter them,
click on the symbol for stream, volcano, clock, tower, or wind, tune
in the number, and move on to the last one.
</P>

<P>
Stream -- 153.4<BR>
Volcano - 130.3<BR>
Clock --- 55.6<BR>
Tower --- 15<BR>
Wind ---- 212.2
</P>

<P>
After entering the numbers, press the sigma or playback key and
listen close. The order played back is different. You need this
order to get into the shack. The order is: tower, stream, wind,
volcano, clock. Enter them into the panel on the shack you passed
earlier. Push the button and enter!
</P>

<P>
This demented donkey-kong country nintendo action sucks. It takes
forever of trial and error to map out where to go. Just follow
these instructions: Get into the driver's seat and press "FORWARD".
Here are the steps:
</P>

<P>
N, W, N, E, E, S, S, W, SW, W, NW, NE, N, SE,
</P>

<P>
exit the vehicle, click on the book and get back to MYST.
</P>

<H3>FINISHING MYST</H3>

<P>
If you haven't been doing it before now, you'd better make sure your
game is saved so that if you mess up, you can do it again. Go back
to the fireplace and get inside of it. Go ahead and turn the
switch. When you see the plate drop down though, you want to enter
the correct pattern. You should have written it down earlier when
you where going through the library books.
</P>

<P>
NOTE: It's pattern number 158 in the far right book, middle shelf.
</P>

<P>
Enter the pattern correctly by pushing on the slate in the right
area. When you're down, flip the switch. The fireplace moves and
opens. There is a GREEN colored book. Be careful! Open the book,
without double clicking on the page. Atrus will appear and talk to
you. Click off of the book to put it away. Get back in the
fireplace, flip switch. At this point, if you copied down the VAULT
notes we found, you would know that you are now supposed to make
sure that all the marker switches on MYST Island are switched (you
should have done this earlier), except the one by the boat dock
where you started out. Do this. Go down to the docks and flip the
marker off. The WHITE PAGE will appear. Go back to the fireplace.
</P>

<P>
Enter the correct fireplace code and pick up the GREEN Book. Now
you can travel to Atrus in Dunny by touching the page. Atrus is
working at a desk. Give him the page. He leaves to take care of
"something". You WON! Atrus will now tell you about an upcoming
adventure (MYST 2). Here are the ways to end MYST:
</P>

<P>
ONE: Drop the white Page, and take the Red page to Sirrus. LOSER!
</P>

<P>
TWO: Drop the White Page, and take the Blue page to Achenar.
LOSER!
</P>

<P>
THREE: Drop the White Page, and go Dunny without the White page.
LOSER!
</P>

<P>
You should have listened to Atrus. You'll have time to learn.
You're now stuck with him Dunny.
</P>

<P>
You can take the Myst book from the desk and go back. You are free
to explore all the ages of Myst. Notice that where the Red and Blue
books where are now fried, burned areas. That was the business
Atrus took care of when he took off for a second.
</P>

<P>
You're all done!!! Get ready for MYST 2!
</P>
