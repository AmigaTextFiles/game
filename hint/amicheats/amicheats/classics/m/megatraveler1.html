<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
A science fiction role-playing adventure. Explore unknown star
systems, trade and piracy, governments, and political structures.
Meet bizarre human and alien cultures and battle in fast-action
combat with futuristic weaponry. The first adventure will focus in a
sparsely settled area of the Imperium called the Spinward Marches.
The Marches are fertile ground for powerful adventures, literally
surrounded with cultures often characterized as other than friendly.

<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
A quick tip to gain cash. Find a high tech world with a low law
level and buy as many PGMP'S as possible, although there may only
be one initially. Then go to a lower tech, higher law level world
and sell the merchandise. The ideal planets are: LLUN/EFATE (When
using the trader character on the disk you can purchase a PGMP for
130500 credits) and STUR/EFATE (Where not only is there a PGMP
lying on the floor NESAR the gun shop, but they can be sold for
244500 credits). In no time at all and with a little cost (because
you are staying within the system) you will gain riches untold!
