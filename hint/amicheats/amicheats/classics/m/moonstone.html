<P>
Take a trip to Stonehenge, keep hold of any valuable items and
position the pointer at either the word GOLD, STRENGTH,
CONSTITUTION, or ENDURANCE and tap the fire button. The druids
should continue the ceremony and you will get an extra life without
losing any items what so ever. When you enter stonehenge and you
have to offer a magical item to DANU, Click on the strength (STR)
for an extra live. Do this as often as you like.
