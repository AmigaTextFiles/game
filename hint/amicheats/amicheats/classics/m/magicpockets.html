<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
The Bitmap Kid has been gifted with bottomless pockets, but some of
his favourite items, including his bike, have been lost. To
retrieve them, he must travel through four levels while destroying
highly intelligent enemies, such as froggers, slimers, rockers, and
hiders. In each world, the Kid uses the elements to affect the
world in different ways. For example, when the Kid throws clouds in
the jungle, they burst, causing plants to grow, creating new
platforms for him to hop onto.
</P>

<H2>CHEATS</H2>

<P>
When you loose your last life keep your finger on the fire button
and the game will start again with your previous score, when you
get to 100,000 you become super powered!
</P>

<P>
On the first level enter 3 secret rooms using the teleport helmet.
In the third room you will find a golden chalice. Pick it up and
you will start each level with full power-ups.
