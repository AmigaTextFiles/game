<H2>CHEATS</H2>

<P>
To earn heaps of experience points, make a backup of your original
play disc. Now boot and insert the disk that contains your
characters. Save them onto your second backup by going to the inn.
Buy three tickets (green, yellow, red or black) and try to win in
all three arenas. Remember to save after each victory. Once you
have a victory in each arena, go to the castle where the bishop is
held captive. Before enter- ing flick the write protect tab to
protect your disk. Then enter and free the bishop with the correct
key. He will give you 10,000 experience points if you have won
three fights of the same color. Exit and go to town. Open the
write protect tab and save at the inn. You can repeat this several
times. Once you have acquired mega-experience, save your party
using your original backup of the play disk.

<H3>HIRELINGS</H3>

<P>
Dead Eye and Red Duke are in Bozorc's (BOSS ORC) control in D1 at
14,01.
</P>

<P>
Sir Kill and Jed I are in Sarakin's Mines. Unfortunately, you have
to kill Sarakin first (and his undead friends!)
</P>

<P>
Might Nakazama and Lord Peabody's servant Sherman were last seen
having some problems with amazons near Native's Cove at 10,1.
</P>

<P>
A couple of guys are in prison in Atlantium, break `em out!
</P>

<P>
A couple of kids are in kept in prison by kobolds in kobold's HQ in
the dungeons beneath Middlegate
</P>

<P>
Buy fried troll's liver at bar in Vulcania. I think there are a
couple of hirelings who like your taste. But ya gotta demonstrate
your skills to them first. (So what is killing a dozen cripples
and misers.)
</P>

<P>
A couple of hirelings are almost dinner for the snowbeast in
Tundara. Kill the snowbeast (in the outer walls of the city), skip
the emerald ring or you will be accused of murder, and save the 2
hirelings.
</P>

<P>
A lichlord guards a high level wizard in Area D3.
</P>

<P>
A couple of guys are currently being held in prison in Castle
Hillstone.
</P>

<P>
Anyway, with the exception of Sherman, most of the hirelings are not
necessary to win the game. They are nice to have around. The most
a hireling can cost is 50000 gold a day. There is a list of all the
hirelings and their locations in the hall of hirelings in Castle
Xabran.
</P>

<H3>GENERAL</H3>

<P>
New tips appear in the bars every odd, even, 30th and 180th days.

</P>

<P>

</P>

<P>
Go to bar in Tundara and eat red-hot wolf nipple chips. Then go to

Gate spell.
</P>

<P>
For the clerical Divine Intervention spell, Go to the Druid's Cave,
and at 14,15 is a arch druid who needs a favor from you. Find
Horvath! Well, Horvath is within the cave (5,3?) find him and kill
him. Horvath is a pretty tough opponet so beware. If you succeed,
go back to the druid and he will grant you this spell.
</P>

<P>
For the Eagle Eyes spell, complete Nordon's quest in Middlegate, and
this spell is part of the reward.

know anyone who has actually got it.
</P>

<P>
For the Enchant Item spell, find the Gemmaker in the Gemmaker's Cave
(D1 - 10,12? - a bit north of Vulcania!) The Gemmaker is at 3,3 in

AGED.)
</P>

<P>
A list of all spells to be found is at the Hall of spells in Castle
Xabran.
</P>

<P>
On days 140-170 at B2 - 14,4 (the circus grounds), there is a
circus. Now try a few events there. You will probably lose, but
you do a consolation prize...A cupie doll! Now go (fly is quicker)
to D3 7,13? (somewhere there!) and meet this old raving hermit. He
will take the doll and direct you to the pool in the Inner Limits
(E2 - 10,11?). Bath in this pool (usually it is acid) and you will
feel like a WINNER! Go back to the circus grounds and choose a
category you want to improve on. For example, if you want improved
strength, try to ring the bell. Horseshoes for improved accuracy,
Kissing booth for better personality, Shell game for better
intelligence, Sack race for better speed, Head dunk for better
endurance, etc. +10 to the category.
</P>

</P>

<P>
You have to be both True and a Black Triple Crown winner to qualify
for the quest for Princess Lamanda (goal of the game). To finish
the game
</P>

<P>
GET THE FOUR WEAPONS (Tolidor, Fluxer, etc.).
</P>

<P>
GET THE ELEMENT ORB. (Dawns mist bog cavern - 10,15). You can't
leave with Orb in hand! There should be a teleporter in the dungeon
(very near the entrance), use that instead and you should end up in
Murray's Cave in Murray's Resort Isle. Another way is to transfer
the Orb to the hireling and then Dismissing my hireling. Now I can
leave the cave with no problem and I can find the hireling with the
Orb same and sound back at the original inn.
</P>

<P>
GET THE FOUR ELEMENTAL TALONS. Use Lord Peabody's time machine to
get to the 9th Century (Era 8), and go to Castle Xabran at C2 -
14,08.
</P>

<P>
GET THE FOUR DISCS. Using the time machine in Castle Pinehurst, or
through the vortex holes at the corners of each elemental planes,
travel back to the years 100, 200, 300, 400 to find the talons. The
locations of the talons are given above. Each shrine which holds a
talon requires the appropriate disc to open.
</P>

<P>
Now you should have all 4 talons and the orb. Go back to the 9th
Century again and find King Kalohn at C4 - 14,5 and see him fighting
the Mega Dragon. When he sees you with the talons and Orb, you will
haved changed history because history had said the battle would have
been lost. Now that the dragon has been vanquished, King Kalohn
will live after all. You return to the 10th Century and you go back
to Luxus Palace. Instead of Princess Lamanda, you now see King
Kalohn! He tells you of the final quest. To go to Square Lake and
try to stop the villain that is going to doom Cron.
</P>

<P>
You enter this fantastic maze. At the end of this simple maze, you
meet him. SHELTEM and his elemental friends. You should be able to
defeat him, but alas, can you beat his recorded message? He has
left a prerecorded message and REAL-TIME cryptogram puzzle. If time
expires, the world crashes into the Sun. Now, the encription
algorithm changes EVERY time so I can't help you with that. But the
message is the same every time:
</P>

<P>
We, the people of Terra, in order to form a more perfect union,
establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the
common defense. The answer of this is given already, Preamble.
Now, find the corresponding encryption and translate the word
Preamble to its encrypted code and then you are done! Cron is saved
from crashing into the Sun.
</P>

<H2>SOLVE</H2>

<H3>GENERAL INFO</H3>

<P>
You start at the inn of the town Middlegate with 6 prerolled or your
own characters. I myself used the characters that came with the
game and put them in this order:
</P>

<P>
Sir Felgar (knight), Terwin III (paladin), Sure Valla (archer), The
Hermit (robber), Gene Eric (cleric), Cassandra (sorcerer). When I
got hirelings I put them in slots 3 and 4 unless clerics and
sorcerers which I put in slots 5 and 6.
</P>

<P>
M&M2 contains 60 16x16 square mazes, which are divided in 5 towns
and their caverns, 20 outdoor mazes, 4 castle mazes, 6 castle
dungeon mazes, 16 caves and the 4 elemental mazes. To help you get
around and raise your character's abilities, be sure to take
advantage of the secondary skills. When you get hirelings, take
notice of their skills, so you can change those of your characters
if you want to. Remember to MAP everything and write down any hint
you get during your progress plus the exact location of these. Also
note, that drinks and food recipes can sometimes offer much help if
you use them properly. Remember to check in at an inn to save your
status if you get new vital information or complete a task and so
on. Some hints are more important than others like hints on special
battles, interleaves, keys and a few more.
</P>

<H3>MIDDLEGATE: The Beginning</H3>

<P>
Start exploring Middlegate. Go to the blacksmith and equip your
characters. Be sure to equip the fighters first. Find the
locations of the tavern, Otto Mapper, Track and trail, Edmund's
expeditions (the last three provide some vital secondary skills),
Lock and key, the temple, the mage guild, the training hall and the
Arena. Raise your characters up to level three by fighting and then
visit Nordon at 10,2. Accept his quest and go to the cavern at
8,15. In this cavern are many clues and hints, but to solve
Nordon's quest you need to go to 0,7. Return the goblet to Nordon
and get your reward. Follow his advice and visit his sister
Nordonna at 1,2. Accept her quest as well and resque Sir Hyron and
Drog in the cavern at 0,15. Return to Nordonna to learn about your
first hirelings and the secrets of the well at 15,15. Follow her
advices. It is up to you if you want to take the hirelings before
or after donating at each of the five temples (don't forget the
temple at Middlegate) but note that if you rest with the hirelings
you have to pay them. After getting the castle key (which is vital
to get into the castles, give it to your robber) you are ready for
next town. Of course you should finish exploring Middlegate and its
cavern first.
</P>

<H3>SANDSOBAR</H3>

<P>
Here you should begin finding the usual places - the blacksmith, the
inn, the tavern, the training hall, the temple and the mage guild.
Here are also good secondary skills for your robber. Explore the
slums carefully and note hints about Nature's day (of course you can
spare a dime for some poor beggars, don't you). Don't worry about
the graffiti at 11,3. You can explore the cavern at this point if
you like but perhaps you'll need more strength to finish it. When
you have had enough of this town for now its time for Tundara.
</P>

<H3>TUNDARA</H3>

<P>
Start as usual finding the same places as before. A little
wall-bunching is needed to find all the locations. You can try your
strength against the frozen animals if you like but don't go to the
region between the inner and outer wall yet unless you are suicidal.
Of course you can try your luck at the cavern.
</P>

<H3>VULCANIA</H3>

<P>
Here are some good secondary skills for your fighters. As before,
this is mainly a exploratory trip but don't forget the statues at
the town square. I wouldn't go to the cavern without the Levitation
spell if I were you.
</P>

<H3>ATLANTIUM</H3>

<P>
Don't waste your hard earned money - this is an expensive town!
Later, when you have earned so much that you don't know what to do
with it you can take advantage of some fine secondary skills and so
on but at this moment you should look at the statuaries located at
the east and west walls. The cavern is not meant for beginners!
</P>

<H3>YOUR FIRST TRIP TO THE OUTER WORLD</H3>

<P>
Now you are ready to start exploring the outer world. I strongly
recommend you start from Middlegate with 2 characters equipped with
the secondary skills Mountaineer and Pathfinder. A crusader and a
navigator could also come handy. When you leave town you will first
meet your guardian pegasus and hopefully will discover his name
later (it is not vital but try to take a linguist to C3). If you
have done as I told you and written down all hints you will be now
know what you want to look for this time. (Later on as your party
gets stronger, you will of course explore every single square in
every single maze in the game). You will by now have heard about
Castle Xabran, Lloyd's Beacon, Castle Pinehurst, Queen Lamanda and
many more. So lets start heading north to find Corak's cave at
C2-5,11. You can go there through the woods if you have 2
pathfinders but try to find the path. Enter the cave and get the
spell Lloyd's Beacon. You should be able to finish off the northern
half of the cave this time but unless you've got admit 8 pass found
in the cavern below Sandsobar you cannot enter the southern part and
its not to be bothered with this time anyway.
</P>

<P>
Back to the surface, go back to the main road and walk north to
Castle Woodhaven. Enter if you have a crusader and visit Lord
Hoardall at 9,11. Accept one of his quests if you like but note
that if you do, you must complete it to be offered other quests at
Castle Woodhaven or Castle Hillstone. So, I wouldn'd bother with
any other but the Lord's quest, which you have plenty of time to
solve.
</P>

<P>
Now leave the castle and find your way to Tundara. (This first
outdoor tour is very much like the guided tour around the towns; you
are learning your way around). Trail your way back to C1 and try
visiting 1,1 to get another quest, which as most of the quests in
this game, can be solved anytime you like. Go back to Square Lake
and take the trail that crosses the river below the lake. Follow
the river soutwards until you find a weird dude walking on the
river. Here you should be able to get the spell Walk on water by
now. Go back to the trail and head east until you see a sign
pointing north to the Luxus Palace Royal (queen Lamanda). Don't go
there yet. Instead backtrail to C2 and take the path that leads
south at 14,4. Follow that path to the woods and turn east. Walk
on to D3 and turn at 13,3 to the south. At the end of this road is
Castle Hillstone where you find Lord Slayer at 5,2. If you accepted
Lord Hoardall's quest you can do nothing here by now, else you can
accept Lord Slayer's quest. Go back and turn east at 13,10 (D4),
which will take you to Sandsobar. Now go back to the Square Lake
and explore the east side of the lake. You will find castle ruins
and later you should be able to determine which castle this is and
how to get there. Now it is time to find the way to Vulcania (maybe
you will have some nice fights on the way, I will wait meanwhile...)
Ahh, back already? Now we will take the road that leads to castle
Pinehurst on the west side of the lake (come on, you know which
lake). Don't bother with the circus until between days 140 and 170
(see part 11 of this walkthrough). At 14,7 at A2 you will find some
wagon tracks; this is the way to Sarakin's Mine, a good place to get
rejuvenated - but only when you are a lot stronger than now. Go on
to Castle Pinehurst and find Lord Peabody at 4,3. Accept his quest
(and this is a vital one for the solution of the game).
</P>

<H3>GETTING STRONGER</H3>

<P>
If you think I forgot about the road to Atlantium you're wrong! I
expect you to find your way to the island as you grow stronger. Now
it is time for you to raise your characters. This you do by
exploring the rest of the town caverns, the outside world and the
three castles already located.
</P>

<P>
Remember to take every hint and every location of anything you learn
about. Battle in the Arena, The Monster Bowl and the Colosseum if
you like using the appropriate tickets. As I told in the beginning,
take special notice to hints on keys, queen Lamanda and the triple
crown battles. If you stump upon new hirelings or informations
about those, you should free them and change hirelings as they will
almost certainly be stronger (and more expensive) than Nordonna's
sons. Don't miss the location of Mount Farwiew at D2-7,0. Also, on
your way you will find some encoded messages in three colors; green,
yellow and red, and the three clues to these messages, the green,
yellow and red interleaves, are located at three different places.
If you have problems decoding these messages, the solution is
written at the end of this walkthrough.
</P>

<H3>LORD PEABODY'S QUEST</H3>

<P>
Worried about day 93? Well, there are two ways to to get Natures
Gate. To have your own clerics learn it go to C3-1,9. Note the old
druid's food and let your cleric order it at the proper tavern. Go
back - and you've got it! The other way is to free the two captives
at Native's Cove at B4. Explore the area and don't give up until
you succeed. These two hirelings will probably be your best so far
(after I got much stronger and freed the prisoners at Sarakin's
Mine, I used them mostly throughout the end of the game). Go back
to Lord Peabody and get your reward, the license to use the time
machine!
</P>

<H3>QUEEN LAMANDA</H3>

<P>
Now you should be ready for Queen Lamanda. Go to Luxus Palace Royal
defeating Mandagaul on your way and visit the queen at 7,13. By
now, you should know that you have to win the triple green key
battle, the triple yellow, the triple red and the triple black.
Start by buying three green tickets at Middlegate and the green key
at Lock and Key Ltd. Win the three battles at the Arena, the
Monster bowl and the Colosseum. Then go to castle Woodhaven and
free the bishop of green battle from his imprisonment with the green
key and collect your reward. Repeat this process for the other
color battles. The bishop of yellow is in Castle Pinehurst, the
bishop of red is in Castle Hillstone and the bishop of black is in
Luxus Palace Royale. Now go back to the queen to find out that she
still demands some more deeds to be done before you can get an
audience. Time for more strenghtening.
</P>

<H3>CASTLE XABRAN</H3>

<P>
This is a good time for exploring this castle from the last century.
You know now where it is and how to get there, don't you? In this
castle, you should be able to find complete information about the
locations of all spells and all hirelings. Here are also 4 vital
objects for completing the game, the four elemental discs. Also, in
each of the other four castles, is a vital object for your main
quest.
</P>

<H3>THE CIRCUS</H3>

<P>
By the way this is not a necessary task. Go to the circus, then to
D3-7,13 with a cupie doll. Follow the old man's advices and then
return to the circus to raise the ability you like.
</P>

<H3>THE DRUID'S CAVE AND MURRAY'S RESORT ISLAND</H3>

<P>
To get most out of the island, you should buy at least one guided
tour from the agency at Middlegate. But go first to the Druid's
cave to get a lot of information, much strenght and at least one
spell. Don't forget to finish off Horvath and only then go to
Murray's island. Explore the cave (if you have problems defeating
the stone golems, then just skip them for now) to find the power oil
and some information on your quest and then try to visit Murray. To
do this, you must head the signs on the way to his room. He will
offer you a quest, accept it and return after finishing it for your
reward.
</P>

<H3>THE PLUS QUEST</H3>

<P>
Now you should be ready for the long and somewhat tedious quest of
the jurors on Mount Farwiew. If you, for instance, start out with
the knight's quest, you go to Middlegate Inn and get rid of all
other characters but knights and robbers (remember, robbers can help
in all quests). Then go to all inns and collect all hirelings that
are knights and robbers. Equip them and take off to defeat the
dread knight. After that you go to the mountain to confirm your
deed and then back to Middlegate to train your characters some 10
levels! Repeat this process for all the characters you plan to use
in the final quest. If you are not using barbarians and ninjas, you
don't have to finish their tasks.
</P>

<P>
After you have had all your favorite characters gain their plus, you
gather them together again and visit queen Lamanda. She will accept
them as the stalwart band to rescue her father from the battle with
the mega dragon, which happened last century. Remember, to get her
goodwill, all your characters visiting her must have won the triple
battles and finished their plus quests.
</P>

<H3>SOME MORE TRAINING AND MONEY-MAKING</H3>

<P>
Now you are almost ready for the elemental planes but I assume you
are getting low on money. No problem anymore! Your characters are
so strong by now that they will have an easy riding in the dragon's
dominion at D1, where a lot of money can be collected (I'm talking
millions of gold each time you visit the cave). Just don't bother
with the ancient dragon until you have discovered the secrets of the
desert at E2. Underways, don't forget to visit the nomad's cave at
E3 for a lot of information. And the gemmaker's cave at E1 should
also be visited at this time.
</P>

<H3>BELEMENTAL PLANES, THE ORB AND KING KALOHN</H3>

<P>
Now it is time to get the four elemental talons. To do this you
must have the four discs from castle Xabran. I will not give you
the excact locations of the talons but don't leave the elemental
planes until you have found the red messages as well (3 of those at
earth plane and 2 at the others). After collecting the 4 talons,
you go for the elemental orb. It is located in Dawn's cave (D4 3,8)
at 10,15. On the way you must defeat the orb guardians and to get
the orb, you must possess the fluxer, the todilor, the radicon and
the capitor. To escape from the cave with the orb, you must give it
to a hireling and then dismiss that hireling. He will return to the
inn you last checked into and wait for you there.
</P>

<P>
Now you visit your friend, lord Peabody, and use his time machine to
get to era 8. Go one step north and voops! You are watching king
Kalohn the vanguished preparing for the battle with the mega dragon.
The king will ask you for the talons and the orb. Accept his
request and you have changed history! The dragon is defeated and
the king thanks you and asks you to see him at Luxus Palace Royale.
Go there and get information on your final quest.
</P>

<H3>THE FINAL QUEST</H3>

<P>
The Square Lake Cavern is a very difficult one and you should by all
means have finished off the dragon's dominion first to get get a BIG
raise on your hit points (defeat the ancinent dragons, then explore
the upper right half and then the lower right half of the cavern).
When you at last after a great effort have killed the evil threat,
you'll have to solve a cryptogram in 15 minutes. This changes each
time you get there but the solution is always the same:
</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
WE, THE PEOPLE OF TERRA, IN ORDER TO FORM A<BR>
MORE PERFECT UNION, ESTABLISH JUSTICE,<BR>
INSURE DOMESTIC TRANQUILITY,<BR>
PROVIDE FOR THE COMMON DEFENSE...
</BLOCKQUOTE>
 
<P>
The answer is always PREAMBLE as stated, so encode PREAMBLE
according to the cryptogram and its solution, and you have saved
Cron! Congratulations!

For each individual to become true, see the jury which resides at
Mount Farview. Travel in groups of appropriate class. A Robber can
aid all others with their task.

If personal statistics you'd like to enhance, with circus games you
should take a chance. Win dumb prizes, but don't feel bad, you can
offer these toys to an old man who can be had. His hut in the
wilderness is dwarfed by a tree. For the toy, he gives you a tip
for free. Drink from the Inner Limits pool. Though once it was
acid, now it is cool. With thirst now thoroughly sated, go back to
the Cicus and play games to raise those statistics which you truly
hated.

To right ancient wrongs, the solution is very long. The Triple
Crown must first be done, with Arena, Monster Bowl and Colosseum to
be won. Next, the party must split individually so that each may
fulfill their personal destiny. Request an audience with the Queen
so the Chosen One can be seen. Travel through time with Talons and
Orb. Save the dead King from destruction and get the password.
Then visit the lake geometrics to find passage to that which you
must hurriedly fix.
