<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
In the Might and Magic tradition, explore the incredible islands of
Terra. Journey to the deepest cavern, discouver the secrets hidden
deep within dungeon walls, and wander beyond the beaten path across
terrain ranging from deserts to swamplands. Battle against
blood thirsty monsters as you seek to fulfill the quests of Kings and
ghostly Sorcerers. The tools you will use to reach your ultimate
destiny are your mind, might, and magic.
