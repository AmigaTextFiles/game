<H2>CHEATS</H2>

<P>
Press these keys to do the following:
</P>

<P>
'ALT', 'E' - Moves you to the next board immediately.<BR>
'ALT', 'P' - Gives you "Zap Gold", "Laser", Catch", and
"Brickthrough" capabilities.<BR>
'ALT', 'W' - Asks you what board you wish to play. Enter a number
from 1-50 and it takes you there.<BR>
'SHIFT', 'ALT', 'Y' - Gives you a free life, but you must already
be in cheat mode by using one of the other keys. Only works in
version 4, but try it in version 3.
</P>

<H2>NOTES</H2>

<OL>
<LI>The game doesn't actually look for the above key combinations to
activate the cheats. It looks for certain characters. For example,
instead of the 'ALT', 'E' combination it looks for the copyright
symbol. This means that for people with unusual keyboards or
keymaps the needed key combinations will be differant.
<LI>Once you use a cheat the game won't save your high scores.
