<P>
Fly the Dominion Dart as usual, fly to above 350 meters, level off
(your speed should be 1,781 kph) and fire a missile. Pick the
missile up once you get close to it and then land. Go to 08,08,
and take the crashed intergalactic craft and go to 08,06. Go
underground exit your ship and walk through the triangular door.
You now have access to the authors cheat room where you'll get keys
to every door, passes out of prison and the ability to carry lots of
goodies in your pockets.
