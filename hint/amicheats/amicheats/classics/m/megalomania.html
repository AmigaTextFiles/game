<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Play one of four gods, battling for control of planets. Direct your
people to multiply and populate and control island after island.
Begin with cavemen and simple stick and stone weapons, then advance
through the epochs, inventing more complex weapons, gaining
technological and strategic advantages, and eventually engaging in
the decisive battle for the world in the far future. Game also has
rare and slightly campy humor that keeps you laughing, even when
you lose.
</P>

<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
Pick a starting sector with the best elements for the inventions you
wish to make this time round.
</P>

<P>
Note the components and sector of any Ergonomically Terrific
designs. This is probably the best way to design that object and
reduces design time by half. If you see another sector later in the
game with the same elements available you'll know this design can be
knocked out in next to no time.
</P>

<P>
Look out for sectors with a plentiful supply of gatherable elements.
These are often the best places to quickly produce a Surprise
Attack! During the later stages, especially in Epoch three, its
advisable to find a sector with more sophisticated elements.
</P>

<P>
Eventually you should be able to pick the best seams to mine and
know the ones to leave alone.
</P>

<P>
It's always best to check the design menu whenever a new seam is
mined. A new design may have just become available.
</P>

<P>
What should you do if a seam or element is totally used up when
designing an object? Bin the design on the blueprints menu and
there's a chance you may be able to redesign it with the elements
you have left.
</P>

<P>
Shields and building weapons can sometimes increase your tech level
and reveal an element which could lead to the designs you require.
</P>

<P>
Inventions made from gatherable elements save valuable time and
manpower. Always wait until the clocks have ticked down to zero
before changing the factory to produce a new object.
</P>

<P>
Knowledge of the different elements in each sector can help you
figure out what the computer opponents are likely to arm themselves
with.
</P>

<P>
Try to keep your men balanced between tasks to maximise efficiency.
Only throw all your men into a single task during an emergency.
</P>

<P>
If time is on your side, try to leave as many men as possible to
reproduce in the tower. Men are your currency, bank wisely. There
are no overdrafts in Mega-lo-Mania!
</P>

<P>
Designing shields from just gatherables can be a lifesaver if you're
under fire but with some spare time.
</P>

<P>
Play sensibly. Don't send unarmed men to attack buildings as they
will have no effect. Play sneaky. Send one or two lambs to the
slaughter as a tester to see what sort of armies your opponents have
hidden away. Use the map to see what your enemies are up to.
</P>

<P>
Remember a building weapon man is twice as strong as an armed man on
the ground from the same area.
</P>

<P>
If an opponent is too close for comfort at the beginning of a game,
try to ally with him before he starts attacking you.
</P>

<P>
What should you do if your back is against the wall and you're about
to die? Try allying with your aggressor! You have nothing left to
lose. Use as few men as possible. See how low you can go...

<H3>TRICKY TEAMSTER TACTICS</H3>

<P>
SCARLET (Red):
</P>

<P>
Usually a good bet for a quick alliance but prone to infidelity.
Tends to attack frequently and with unpredictable armies can be
quite easily tempted into a battle in order to divert her men away
from duties at home. Try to avoid picking a starting sector next to
her or she could cause trouble. She likes designing army weapons.
</P>

<P>
OBERON (Yellow):
</P>

<P>
Likes to offer himself in alliance more than most and unsurprisingly
veers towards the less reliable side of remaining faithful. Oberon
is prone to erratic retaliation attacks but is a useful ally in
battle. Puts his hand towards any weapon design.
</P>

<P>
CAESAR (Green):
</P>

<P>
Not so easy to persuade to ally, but worthwhile and fairly reliable.
Seems to have the best balance between defence and attack. Prefers
building weapons. You should attempt to limit his territory.
</P>

<P>
MEDCAP (Blue):
</P>

<P>
A real tough cookie to turn into an ally but faithful as the day is
long. A careful tactician he rarely makes a false move. Hit Medcap
early to put him off balance. He likes designing building shields.
Tends to throw the occasional but devastating attacks.
</P>

<H2>CHEATS</H2>

<P>
At the start of each island, select as many men as you need to
conquer the island. Now place your castle on the island in the
normal way. Before the screen goes blank and you start the island,
make the number of men lower than you had originally chosen. You
should now start the island with the number of men you selected at
first, but all the men you put back into the 'man pool' will be
available for other islands in that Epoch.
</P>

<P>
The following cheat codes will give you lots of men per Epoch:
