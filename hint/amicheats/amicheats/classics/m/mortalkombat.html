<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
On the screen that tells you about {CODES}, type "VAMPIRE" the words
will turn white and you should hear a sound. This will turn off the
blood.
</P>

<P>
TO FIGHT REPTILE: On the bridge level you must double flawless your
opponent without blocking and then use your fatality move as one of
the various shadows passes over the moon. If performed correctly
text will appear across the screen announcing the fact that YOU HAVE
FOUND REPTILE !.
