<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
The object of the game is to prevent project 'Overlord' - a
satellite which can control people - from going into operation.
</P>

<P>
The men behind this are the chiefs of Gideon Enterprises and the Law
and Order party. To stop the satellite you need to collect the eight
passcards which were issues to the eight scientists involved with
the project (one of them being Carl Linsky). Be quick though, Carl's
wasn't the first death and it's certainly not going to be the last,
so make sure you visit the potential victims before anything happens
to them.
</P.

<P>
Check out every possible location. If you miss an object you're in
trouble. Quite simply, it may prevent you from getting any further.
</P>

<P>
Getting out and meeting people is the only way to gain information
and to progress through the game. And it's usually a good idea to
treat them with respect. Don't go in fists flailing. Be reasonable -
it's more productive and you won't get hurt. When interrogating
somebody try to find connections between them and other characters.
A great many people in the game are linkd and these links will need
to be exploited to help you get further in the mystery.
