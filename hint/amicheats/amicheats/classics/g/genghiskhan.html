<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Genghis Khan catapults the player into an era of world conquest and
domination. There are two seperate scenarios - Mongol Conquest and
World Conquest - each offering a game system that virtually never
puts the player in the same position twice, allowing for endless
hours of absorbing game play. As a player you attempt to build an
empire. Keep it by making your population happy, your treasury full,
your subordinates loyal, and your enemies at bay. The human side of
empire building has not been forgotton. Finding the right way to
approach a hostile empress is just as important as training troops
in battle. Do not let your guard down, and be ready for a host of
problems.

<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
If you get a land that isn't connected with an enemy, move
everything to your home country. The land will be safe, but if
another leader captures a nearby land, make sure you put something
back in or he will attack on his next turn. Don't move all your
forces into your command unit, or an enemy commander will wait till
he is down to his last few men and challenge you to a one on one
fight. If you loose he will get half your command unit.
