<H2>CHEATS</H2>

<P>
When batting, to get a lot of runs press 'P' when the fielder picks
up the ball to pause the game. The fielder will be frozen, but your
batsmen won't. Simply waggle the joystick and your batters will
run. You can now chalk up a high score. When you've had enough
simply press 'P' or 'Esc' to unpause the game.
</P>

<P>
You can also press the 'Spacebar' twice while your bowler is running
to start your bowl again.
</P>

<P>
NOTE: This cheat may also work on Brian Lara's WC Cricket as it is
effectively the same game.
</P>

<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
Don't always bowl at the fastest possible speed, a slower ball may
fool the batsman.
</P>

<P>
Right-handed computer batsmen seem to be weaker on the off-side.
The straight-drive can be the most effective stroke, but make sure
you don't edge the ball to the slips.
</P>

<P>
Don't forget to vary the position of the wicket-keeper to suit the
speed of the bowler.
</P>

<P>
If you find that you are a dab hand at bowling but your batting
leaves a lot to be desired, or vice-versa, then maybe it never
occurred to you that you can save the game and alter the skill level
for each innings.
</P>

<P>
You can also try picking a leg or off spinner when it's your turn to
bowl, then place the box as close to the bowler as possible and
inline with the wickets. Now, if you bowl with no spin, the ball
will bounce over the batsman's bat and hit the wickets!
</P>

<P>
NOTE: If you've never seen it rain, check out the name of the main
file on the program disk. It should be something like: '130593.AG'
- if you've got an earlier date, return your disk to Audiogenic for
a free update.
