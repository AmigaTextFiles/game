<H2>CHEATS</H2>

<P>
After starting the game (or during the game), quickly type "KAREN
BROADHURST" or "KARENBROADHURST" for invulnerability. The message
'cheat mode on' should appear if done correctly. Holes and time
running out will still kill you.
</P>

<P>
When the credits appear, type "DELBOY". "Cheat mode activated" will
appear, and you are invincible, providing he doesn't fall down a
pit.
