<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
Learn to use the side-step function if you don't already. It'll
turn out to be really usefull!
</P>

<P>
In every level, there's a secret room where you can found extra
weapons, health and some other usefull things. They are usually
walls with different textures.
</P>

<P>
In case you didn't know, the save-game function lets you save the
game after each episode (7 levels) and you can restart the game from
there after you have died or quitted to DOS.
</P>

<P>
There's also a "Defender" arcade-game in some levels where you can
win extra lives if you manage to complete the level (kill all the
green baddies).  An easy way to complete the game is that you just
fly in the top right or left corner of the screen and keep shooting
like crazy!
</P>

<H2>CHEATS</H2>

<P>
On disk 2 of gloom in the dir 'misc' there is a file named 'script'.
Use a XPK decruncher or Crunchmania to decompress this file. Now
load the file into a text editor and you will be able to edit the
script to start at any level. Now save the script and recrunch it
with Crunchmania or a XPK packer that supports Crunchmania.
