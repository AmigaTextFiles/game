<P>
NOTES: This is not the only possible sequence of events for
finishing the adventure, and does not include much scenery or
clue-hunting. Also note that you have find the locations yourself.
</P>

<P>
Go to the top floor of library and examine the table. Take the
money. Go to the bus station.
</P>

<P>
Buy the cabbage, brush, sandwich and clove (of garlic). (You should
examine the stall). Alternatively try buying the knife and killing
the greengrocer, then taking all except the corpse.
</P>

<P>
Find the cat (Furry Julie) either by waiting repeatedly, or by
exploring the locations before the manhole. She wanders through
these.
</P>

<P>
Give the sandwich to the cat and get her. (You can only pick her up
if you have fed her and not attacked her.) Go to the library
basement. The books there, if read, contain heavy handed clues. Go
down the hole, which closes, trapping you. You should be seeing
through the cat's eyes. Go East twice (to the Satanist's chapel).
</P>

<P>
Do not stay in the Satanist's chapel too long. Put all except Julie
into the coffin and get it. You can check to see that it has all
gone into the coffin. Go West twice, and then North.
</P>

<P>
Examine the stream (which is safe to drink from) and get the flagon.
You may have to drop the coffin first. Don't drop Julie, in case
she runs off leaving you in the dark.
</P>

<P>
Drink the ale. (You do not need the empty flagon, but it may, like
some of the articles on the stall, be used for mapping.)
</P>

<P>
Go to the underground lake (East) and either "float coffin" or "put
coffin in water". You will then be transported across the lake,
using the coffin as your boat. It will disappear, leaving your
possessions on the beach. Don't drink from the lake.
</P>

<P>
Get all and go up to the crossroads. Do not attempt to go North
until you have dealt with the Vampire, as the Werewolf will scare
the cat away.
</P>

<P>
There are two puzzles which involve doing something which has an
effect several turns later. There is no limit on the number of
turns taken, but it may be convenient to perform the action(s)
required, do something else, and come back later for the result. On
the other hand there is no penalty for, for example, using "wait"
(perhaps using "g" for "again" to save typing) for 12 or more times.
</P>

<P>
Firstly the clove of garlic which you got from the greengrocer is a
bit stale. If you go to the riverbank (South then West from the
crossroads) there are suitable planting conditions, but it will take
time for the wild garlic to grow.
</P>

<P>
Secondly, and it takes some preparation first, you need to get a
stake.
</P>

<P>
Get the can of creosote from inside the woodshed, then go out and
examine the woodshed, and get the woodworm. You will also need to
find and get the gloves found in the undergrowth outside.
</P>

<P>
Leave the sacred grove area and go West from the crossroads. South
from the track is a ruined cottage, with an enormous beam. Paint
the beam (you must have the brush and the can of creosote). You
will not have enough creosote for all the beam. Drop the woodworm,
which will take a while to get through the untreated section. A
stake is all that is left.
</P>

<P>
A job which may be done while waiting, is to obtain the sacred relic
of St. Mary Magdalen. Go to the Oak tree in the grove. It is
hollow and may be entered. Examine the acorns and leaves on the
floor inside to get the key to the convent, which lies East of the
crossroads. Unlock the door and go in.
</P>

<P>
The convent is a maze. Go North (or East or South), then N, E, S,
W. "Kiss Mary" (it gets a bit Leasure Suit Larry-ish here I'm
afraid), and when she goes back to heaven, get all. Find you way
out again.
</P>

<P>
With the saced relic, you can (by getting killed with it in your
possesion, and going to heaven rather than hell) find your way back
to the bus station. If you have lost the cat then so long as you
have not done anything to upset it, you should be able to find her
in her usual haunts, and, via the tunnels (the coffin will be back
in the chapel), get back.
</P>

<P>
To take on the Vampire, you need the cat, the stake, wild garlic,
the cross from the convent, and a spade (found by examining the
gorse bushes of the track, if you are wearing gloves). At the
graveyard, dig. Down, is the tomb antechamber. South of this is
the burial chamber.
</P>

<P>
In the burial chamber open the sarcophagus (the lid will break).
Out will come the vampire which you have to kill. Enter the
sarcophagus, and you will find that vampires have a better life than
expected; it leads to an appartment. You will need the sword.
</P>

<P>
East from the appartment will port you back to the burial chamber.
Go North and then Up to leave.
</P>

<P>
Before you attempt the werewolf, go to the garden (South of the
cottage) and examine the weeds. With the useless dandelions and
daisies you find some aconite (also known as "wolf'sbane"). Get it.
</P>

<P>
North from the crossroads are the downs, which are simply 4 similar
locations in a square, no tricks with twisted paths here. There is
a better than average chance of meeting the werewolf, who will scare
Julie. If you are carrying the aconite you will be able to pass.
If you want to fight the werewolf you may, but you may well lose and
it is a needless risk.
</P>

<P>
Beyond the downs are the mountains, and in the mountains you will
find the dragon's lair. When you get in, don't waste time, kill the
dragon. (You need the sword and you must have drunk the enchanted
ale from the underground stream). You may then take the Grimoire.
</P>

<P>
Get yourself killed (there is a convienient cliff not too far away,
or you could try paddling in the underground lake). Because you
have the holy relic, you go to heaven.
</P>

<P>
In heaven, examination of the concrete post will tell you that it is
a bus stop. "Wait" for a bus, and because you should still have you
tee-shirt, (examine it if you like), the bus driver will let you on.
Soon the bus will take you to the bus station, and you can then be
first to return to your class with a Grimoire.
</P>
