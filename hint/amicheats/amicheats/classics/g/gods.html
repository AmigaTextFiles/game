<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Ancient Greece has been taken over by the forces of darkness. As
powerful Hercules, players battle through four action-packed levels
to achieve immortality. Each level has three worlds of adversaries
and puzzles. Progression puzzles must be solved; reward puzzles are
helpful in advancing.
</P>

<H2>LEVEL CODES</H2>

<P>
This game may generate unique passwords for each copy sold.
TherEfore the codes listed below probably don't work on your copy.
</P>

<P>
2- "JZS" or "CEL" or "APV"<BR>
3- "SFJ" or "HHO" or "AVJ"<BR>
4- "USX" or "DRA" or "LHH"
</P>

<H2>CHEATS</H2>

<P>
Some early versions of this game had a cheat which give you infinite
energy. To find out if you have one of these early copies just
enter 'SORCERY' as a password.
</P>

<P>
Also try entering "MagicPockets" and "Coke" into the high score
table or during play. I don't know if they do anything but they are
in the game code.
</P>

<P>
On level two, buy a shield and a magic potion, then get three
fireballs and three stars. Spend all of your remaining money on
food and health. Collect all the gems in the usual manner, then
get a key and make for the exit. Now comes the tricky bit. When
you descend the last ladder, two thieves will appear. Make sure
that you don't quite have enough energy to survive a direct
contact! Before going down the ladder, release your magic potion,
then climbdown and open the door. Stand in front of the door
ready to leave, but don't push up yet! Wait until the thieves
jump down at you and as soon as they touch you push the joystick
up. You may loose that life, but then something rather strange
will happen. The bonus will start to whiz up for quite some time,
until the game starts again on world two with 28 extra men and
about five million points!
</P>

<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
Learn the levels before going for the bonuses. It's not always a
good idea to collect valuable items as it tends to make the monsters
much more aggressive. Sometimes it pays to lose a life before
entering a new level to fool the computer into thinking you're not
that good a player, this means the next stage will be easier.
</P>

<H3>MONSTERS</H3>

<P>
All the monsters encountered in Gods have attributes that define
their weaknesses, strengths and behaviour. The hit point "HP"
attribute sets how many times a monster must be hit before it dies.
A weak monster would have perhaps 10 hit points where a stronger
creature could have 250 or more. As you progress thru the game you
will notice that the monsters become more intelligent. This means
that they will be more effective at carrying out their objectives to
steal treasure, kill or avoid you. It's not wise to attack thieves
as they're usuall helpful.
</P>

<H3>WEAPONS</H3>

<P>
Weapons also have attributes which define their behaviour and
effective- ness. The weapons hit point score determines how
powerful it is. For example, to kill a monster with 20 hit points
would require 20 throws of a one hit point weapon (a knife for
example) or 4 throws of a five hit point weapon (like a fireball).
Weapons which go past walls are generally more effective. Overall,
the value of the weapon reflects its usefulness.
</P>

<H3>POTIONS</H3>

<P>
Correct use of potions can be helpful in completing many sections in
Gods. You can normally only carry three items so don't buy to many
potions in the shop, leave room for other objects necessary for
solving puzzles.
</P>

<H3>POWER POTIONS</H3>

<P>
These are used to increase the effectiveness of weapons. Buying or
picking up a power potion increases the damage done by all of your
weapons. The same effect can be achieved by getting multiples of
the same weapon. Considering power potions effect all the weapons,
they are obviously a far more economical way of increasing weapon
hit points than buying or picking up multiples of the same weapon.
</P>

<H3>EXTRA LIVES</H3>

<P>
Additional lives are found in treasure rooms but they can also be
awarded for clever play and scoring points. Extra lives can also be
given to a player that is doing badly.
</P>

<H2>SOLVE</H2>

<H3>LEVEL 1 - WORLD 1</H3>

<P>
The first world of the game is used to enable to get the player used
to the control method and solve some puzzles which are really easy.
</P>

<P>
The first key you'll need is the one to open the treasure room.
</P>

<P>
The world key is found in the treasure room and opens the door at
the end of the world. For a shortcut, reset levels one and two to
move block one. This will reveal a water crystal and power-up and
teleport you.
</P>

<P>

<LI>Pull lever seven within two minutes from the game start to make
platform two move.

part of the puzzle in World Two.
</OL>

<H3>LEVEL 1 - WORLD 2</H3>

<P>

right. Make sure you go over the top platforms as the bottom route
is more difficult but will give you bonus crystals.
</P>

snatch the room key on the way. Get the world key from stores to
exit on the right. Buy Shurikens and Normal Arc at the shop.

</P>

<OL>

above lever nine by pulling lever four. You will then be able to
jump down and open the treasure room door.

<LI>Push all four hidden switches to open the trap doors which form
the base of the treasure room. All treasure will then fall thru
onto the floor beneath the room.
</OL>

<H3>LEVEL 1 - WORLD 3</H3>

<P>
Pull switch two to close the trap doors and blow up the spike in the
pit. Get the giant jump to go up the trap doors.
</P>

Alternatively, you can wait for two minutes and a teleport crystal
will appear to move you up, although you will not get the special
bonus. Get the key on the top left platform to open the trap door
to the right.
</P>

<P>
Go up the ladder which leads to the towers. Go up the ladders to
the bridge and jump across the platforms to the left to collect the
trap door key. Go right and collect the teleport key. Open the
door by pulling lever eleven and this will teleport you to the
platform on the far left of the map. Collect the door key. Go
right and pull lever seven and drop down through the trap door.
Pull lever eight to teleport you to the top door on the right. Pull
lever nine to enter the treasure room and collect the lightening
bolt. Pulling lever ten will open the door and take you back.
Collect the world key and go down the ladder and when you reach the
bottom platform you will recieve a trap door key. Pull lever twelve
and go down to defeat the centurion protecting the temple.
</P>

<P>
Go up the ladder to the temple and enter the door to exit the level.
In the shop you should buy the Magic Axe and spend the rest of your
money on Power Potions.
</P>

<P>
How To Enter The Treasure Room:
</P>

<P>
Kill the wave of monsters which appear to the left of lever three.
They will give you a trap key. Reset lever three, which will then
give you a shield when you pull lever four to protect you when you
drop through the trap door to the treasure room.
</P>

<P>
To Move Block One:
</P>

<P>
You have to get to this point with more than two lives, more than
80,000 points and within 140 seconds from the start of this world.
</P>

<H3>DEFEATING THE END OF LEVEL GUARDIAN</H3>

<P>
The Centurion is the easiest of the bosses. Watch the Centurion as
he throws fireballs and note the point where they bounce the
highest. This is the place you should stand to kill the Boss
without getting hit. Move backwards and forwards at the same time
as the Centurion, keeping the same relative position in order to
avoid being hit.
</P>

<H3>SPECIAL BONUSES</H3>

<P>

a gold treasure chest.
