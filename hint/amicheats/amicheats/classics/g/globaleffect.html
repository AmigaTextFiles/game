<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Should you take a turn saving the Earth? You may choose to save,
rule, or create a world. Spread before a massive game area of 64,000
seperate locations, Global Effect simulates the interactions of
economical, industrial, environmental, and military factors in
managing world balance. You need to take into account other players
and the broader backdrop of environmental balance. Most options
available to the governments of the world will be available to you,
the leader of a task force sent on government missions to secure
distant worlds for the growing galactic civilization.
