<H2>TIPS</H2>

<OL>
<LI>NEVER EVER attempt to go to the sewers without the torch.
<LI>To get lots of points do any of the following:
<UL>
<LI>Go to the pizza party (a building without a sign on it). Waggle
your joystick left and right to eat pizzas. When you get splatted
by a pie you'll see a pizza monster!
<LI>Take the golf ball from the shed to the golf course (the scene
before the busty lady picture). Kick it to try for a hole-in-one.
If you miss you'll find the ball near the busty lady.
<LI>Jump on the settee and kick it. You'll then see it's ripped.
</UL>
<LI>Pick up the aniseed balls for invincibility (as long as you
carry them).
<LI>If Odie picks up the aniseed balls he won't take any of your
items.

<H2>SOLVE</H2>

<P>
From the start screen go left until you come to the front door with
the cat flap. Pick up the red rubber bone and drop it next to the
cat flap. Wait until Odie opens the cat flap and then move back to
the start screen with the green chair and go through the door. Pick
up the torch and go into the back yard. Enter the shed and fall
down the hole. Walk right until you come to an alley and then go up
to it. Carry on right and down until you get to Nermal. You'll
need to kick him repeatedly until he drops the mouse and then move
Odie to pick up the mouse and leave the sewer.
</P>

<P>
You should then drop the mouse off at the health shop. A spinach
doughnut will fall and you need to take this to the rat in the
sewer. Drop him the doughnut and he'll stop. Then go to the chest,
kick it and pick up the key. Take the key to the park and drop it
next to the lady on the bench.
</P>

<P>
The next step is to fetch either the bucket from the garden or the
spade from the shed and take it to the hardware store. By using it
in the shop you can gain a one dollar bill which may be used to buy
some bird seed from the health food shop. Take the bird seed to the
park and drop it next to the key. Quickly lift up the key and stand
still. The duck will pick you up and drop you in the dog pound.
Walk right and go up the alley. Go right again and all that`s left
to do is get a big smacker from Arlene.
