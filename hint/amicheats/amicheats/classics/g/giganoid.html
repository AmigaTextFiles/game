<P>
On the player select screen, press the 'CAPS LOCK' key, so the key
light is on. Now press and hold the 'CAPS LOCK' and press fire. A
message should appear letting you know the cheat is active. If you
held down the fire button a little to long the game may have
started and bypassed the message, but you should notice you have a
lot of lives.
