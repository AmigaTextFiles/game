<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
After centuries of oppressive rule by the Tyrans, Lord Mantrex and
his Star Warriors have rebelled and attempted to win the freedom of
the planet. After years of bitter fighting, the remnants of Lord
Mantrex's forces have gathered to face the final assault by the
Tyrant Deathbots. You, as Lord Mantrex, must defeat the Tyrans and
win back the freedom of Ganymed.
