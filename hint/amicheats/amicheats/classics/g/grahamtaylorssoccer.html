<H2>TIPS</H2>

<H3>TRAINING</H3>

<P>
For optimum results, train four times a week, and use team training
as often as possible.
</P>

<P>
Select your training method carefully as each program will have
different effects on your players skills; for example Circuit
Training for stamina, Outdoor Game for overall skills/set piece
practice, and Indoor Game for passing.
</P>

<P>
Avoid prolonged use of any single method, as this can reduce player
morale and may also lead to injury. In June you may give your
players a break, but resume training in July.
</P>

<H3>TRANSFERS</H3>

<P>
Before getting a player on loan it's wise to know how good he is, as
even a player from a higher division may have lower skills than most
of your own squad. Find an available player first and, when asked
how many weeks you require him for, enter a very high figure. This
should abort the loan, and then enable you to send out a scout to
have the player watched. Compare his skills with those of your own
players and, if suitable, go and borrow him.
</P>

<P>
When placing players on the transfer list, try not to price them too
highly, or you may scare offother clubs. Examine a player's value
from the Contracts screen and use a similar figure to this.
Remember either to send a scout or watch a player in action before
purchasing to avoid wasting valuable cash.
</P>

<P>
As you climb the leagues, think about getting rid of as many of your
old players as you can, this enables you to replace them with newies
with skills to match their opponents. Remember, one good player is
more valuable than two average ones.
</P>

<P>
The best type of player to go for first is a really good goalkeeper.
When in Division 3 try to save up £100,000-plus for your goalie, and
this will solve half of your problems.
</P>

<P>
It's possible to make money by giving a full contract to a trainee
(only select the very best), and then putting him straight on the
transfer list. Give him time though, and his skills will blossom so
you can sell him for a higher price.
</P>

<H3>GENERAL</H3>

<P>
When seeking a new job (or just starting) try to select a club that
attracts large crowds, as realistic ground capacities are included
in the game.
</P>

<P>
As a guide when starting out go for Burnley, Carlisle or Cardiff -
avoid Doncaster, Halifax and Torquay at all costs!
</P>

<P>
When picking your team, if necessary use players out of position
rather than opting for a trainee to fill a gap (goalkeeper
excepted).
</P>

<P>
Watch as many of your matches as you can, because the results will
be more of a realistic reflection of your team selections and
players skills.
</P>

<P>
Choose your words carefully when it comes to team talk. Generally,
try to use the responses 'praise', 'no comment' and 'reprimand'
whenever necessary.
</P>

<P>
Remember to check your players contracts and re-negotiate with
valued players regularly. A player out of contract may choose to
walk out on your club and you will not receive full value for him in
compensation.
</P>
