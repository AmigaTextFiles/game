<P>
To give your troops unlimited action points.

<P>
Lets say you have 3 action points left, and you are next to an
enemy. Attack the enemy unit using the "Attack" button on the troop
menu, then after the battle starts, click "Retreat" quickly. You
now 10 action points! You can repeat this as often as you like.
It's very useful for moving from Judukan to Baal in one turn!
