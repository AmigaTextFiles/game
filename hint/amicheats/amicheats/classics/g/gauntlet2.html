<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Arcade fans are talking about the home-computer version of this
game, which captures all the superlative graphics, sound, and
excitement of the coin-op megahit. Explore the Dark Dungeons in
search of treasure and power as you battle ghosts, demons and other
foes. Up to four people can play at once!
</P>

<H2>CHEATS</H2>

<P>
While you are adventuring, find a treasure chest and make sure you
have a key. Hold down 'INSERT' while you open the chest. Release
'INSERT' and hold the joystick down. Now pressing 'HELP' will give
you 5000 health points.
</P>

<P>
When you open a treasure chest hold down the 'HELP' key, then when
you open a second chest hold down the 'INSERT' key. A golden cross
should appear, collect this and your health points should rise to
50,000. You will also have 32,000 super shots for the remainder of
the level. The shots will vanish once you leave the level, and if
you pick up an amulet, the counter will be reset to 10 shots.
</P>

<P>
To avoid tricky levels, pause the game and wait for three minutes.
Press 'fire' and all the walls turn to exits. This happens anyway,
but if you pause the game, you don't lose energy, and won't get
attacked while waiting three minutes.
</P>

<P>
To get into the secret room, clear the dungeon completely, picking
up the super shots last, then go to the exit without pressing
'FIRE'.
