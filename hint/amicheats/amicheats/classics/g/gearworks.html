<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Get ready for some fast-paced fun! Gearworks is an addictive gear
game that allows you to transform twelve Wonders of the World into
time pieces. This visually innovative game will test your reflexes,
engineering skills, and your nerves. Remember, time is tick, tick,
ticking away! Just like any other machine there are bugs, in this
case poffins, that try to damage the mechanism by rusting the gears
and breaking off the mounting pegs. But there are ways around them,
like shooting them, but be careful not to use all your ammunition.
There is also an oil can that can lube up any rusted gears. It has
been called the Tetris of the 90's. Some have nick-named it the hair
puller. We think you'll call it endless fun!
