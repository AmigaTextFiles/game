<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Fifty years ago, the first Goldrunner, a brave and bold warrior,
defeated a powerful force of space pirates to save the world. The
past five decades of life on the Ring-Worlds of Triton have altered
the life of the human race. No longer a warrior, technology has made
man a new fighter. But the robots that defend his home have been
captured by pirates and turned against him. That's when the action
begins. Fly your single seated fighter to the platforms, outwit the
pirates' defense system, and recover the robots.
