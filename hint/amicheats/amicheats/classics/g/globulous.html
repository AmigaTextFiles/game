<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
The most important thing to remember is that all the puzzles can be
solved without losing a life, so if you lose a life and think its
the only way to solve the screen, look closely. Some of the
puzzles get pretty obscure after level 10, but once you eventually
beat them you'll kick yourself for not seeing the solution earlier.
</P>

<P>
Look before you leap. Think about how the screen will look from a
flipped perspective. A lot of jumps you make will be unnecessary
and waste time and switches if you don't.
</P>

<P>
Make sure you have enough switches, at least 10 per screen. It is
possible to get stuck on a downward slope with no way to get back
up or kill yourself, and the only way out is to press 'ESC' and
start the whole game over.
