<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
The Death Adder is tyrannizing the people of Yuria. Only three
heroes have the strength to stop the ruthless tyrant and regain the
throne. Tyris-Flaire, a beautiful and powerful amazon is empowered
by a special fire magic. Gilus-Thunderhead rumbles and tumbles to
the scene with his astonishing combination of lighting power and
gymnastic skills. And the Axe Battler has sharpened his giant sword
for battle. You must choose which challenger to send into the
dreaded path of the Death Adder. Your weapons range from razor-sharp
swords to curtains of fire. You can even joust with your foes.
Remember, one dose of magic can wipe away an acre of wvil.

<P>
Play in one player mode but with two joysticks. When you die,
press 'fire' on the other joystick and you should receive three
more lives.
