<P>
On the beginning of level one, turn around and face the tree that
follows you. Get close to the tree and jump up and throw your
stick over it. Now when you land turn around and the stick will
hit the tree a couple of times. If the tree is still there repeat
the previous steps, and the tree will eventually turn into a tiny
tree. Now go to the left and pick up all of the stuff. Make sure
you get the unicycle like thing with the head on it. Now you
should notice platforms have appeared throughout the level. Get
all the stuff that is on the platforms. When you finish the level,
you will be transported to a bonus level.
