<H2>TIPS</H2>

<H3>MISC</H3>

<P>
When you enter an area and hear a growl...backup and prepare to
fight!
</P>

<P>
Look for unlikely or seemingly impossible shot angles. By this I
mean it can appear that you are shooting over the heads of the
target but you are actually making hits. There are numerous
situations where you are firing down on your target, aim high and
you'll still likely hit your target. The level where the
scorpion-like creatures comes to mind. In one situation there are
several that can't get to you because they are behind short
barricades. All you can see are the tails. I found that by backing
up a bit and aiming upwards that I could hit and kill them even
though I really did not have a clean shot.
</P>

<P>
Keep in mind that you can buy the necessary keys if you cannot find
one or one is too difficult to get.
</P>

<P>
Remember...almost all of the seemingly impossible situations have a
simple solutions so just experiment.
</P>

<H3>FIGHTING</H3>

<P>
One technique that must be mastered is movement from side to side.
This allows you to aim/fire the weapon and dodge shots coming at you
at the same time. Rotating and firing the weapon is not a good idea
unless the attacker is right on top of you. My personal favorite
control configuration is to use a joystick and set the control menu
option to mouse. This seems a bit odd but what it does is allow
rotational movement in two ways, the mouse and left/right joystick.
Side to side movement is now the left/right cursor keys and
forward/backward is the up/down cursor keys. Forward/backward is
also the accomplished via the joystick as well. Even though the
control is set to mouse, I really don't use it much, mostly just to
make minor aiming adjustments or to adjust my course slightly when
walking down a hallway.
</P>

<P>
It's good technique to put some distance between yourself and your
opponents. This gives you time to dodge oncoming shots. Firing
while backing up (also using side to side movement) is very
effective. For this I will take my right hand off the joystick and
utilize the cursor keys while blasting away with the left hand on
the joystick fire button. If an opponent gets too near then I
switch my right hand back to the joystick so I can rotate and rid
myself of the attacker(s).
</P>

<P>
Another good technique is to walk part way into a room or hallway
and then back up. This will often cause the enemy to appear.
</P>

<H3>WEAPONRY</H3>

<P>
Boost the simple shot as soon as possible. This can occur as early
as the first world, second arena. Obtain the fireballs as soon as
you can. This will probably happen in the first world, fourth
arena. Boost this as soon as possible, probably the very next
arena. Stay away from the flamethrower, I think it's a waste of
credits. The plasma gun is powerful but buying it will delay the
purchase of more powerful weapons.
</P>

<P>
After boosting the fireballs you have a choice to make, go for
either the magnetic gun or the death machine.
</P>

<P>
What weapons will win the game for you? Two have worked for me, the
boosted magnetic gun and the boosted death machine. An unboosted
death machine would probably work. An unboosted magnetic gun might
possibly work but I don't think so. The magetic gun is far cheaper
than the death machine so it can be obtained much earlier. Trying
for the death machine means struggling along with boosted fireballs
until the third world, fourth arena at the earliest. This is very
challenging but once you get the death machine, look out! The rest
of the game becomes fairly easy. Whichever weapon you choose, boost
it as soon as you can.
</P>

<H3>ELEVATORS</H3>

<P>
For elevators going up you can sometimes see attackers and kill them
by aiming up and firing. Sometimes no attackers appear until the
elevator gets to its destination. In at least one situation,
starting up the elevator and then backing off of it will bring on
the enemy so they can be killed by firing upwards.
</P>

<P>
For elevators going down try firing over the edge to kill anything
that might be waiting for you at the bottom. Another technique is
to step onto the elevator and then step back quickly so that the
elevator goes down without you. This sometimes exposes the enemy
who can be killed now by firing downward.
</P>

<H3>SPENDING</H3>

<P>
At first, you will probably be spending lots of credits just to stay
alive. This will prevent you from buying the necessary weapons that
you need to take you further. As you become more skilled, though,
this will taper off.
</P>

<P>
Once you become adept using the fighting techniques, you will for
the most part only need to spend credits for weapons and for
boosting them. Only occasionally will you need to spend credits for
health and shields. Once you have obtained the more powerful
weapons you may often need to spend credits for energy however.
</P>

<H3>ADVANCING LEVELS</H3>

<P>
Your numbers (health, shield, energy) at the end of one level become
your starting point for the next level. If you have low numbers
then you might want to replay that level again if you think you can
do it better. Try to carry the best numbers possible from level to
level.
