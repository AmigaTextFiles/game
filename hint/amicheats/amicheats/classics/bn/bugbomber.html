<H2>TIPS</H2>

<H3>OPTIONS MENU & IN-GAME KEYS</H3>

<P>
Firstly, here is the Options Menu / Title Screen explained:
</P>

<P>
F1 - VS Computer / Opponent
</P>

<P>
Pressing F1 will swap play modes.
</P>

<P>
By The Way, you cannot quit the game (and it doesn't multitask
either) so make sure you've saved any work you were doing before you
start the game as you'll have to reboot after you've finished
playing!
</P>

<P>
The In-Game keys are:
</P>

<P>
'Help' - Lose one life<BR>
'Esc' -- Quits the current game<BR>
'P' ---- Pauses the game (press again to unpause it)
</P>

<H4>OPPONENT MODE</H4>

<P>
In this mode, you will be on your own!  You will face all the other
players playing (including the computer if turned on!  See below).
This doesn't work by levels, but rather by rounds & matches instead.
</P>

<P>
This is a great way of playing if you have more than two players as
with two players, there's no skill or tactics involved as you can
only go after one other player.  The addition of the energy egg
makes all the difference in this mode!
</P>

<P>
F2 - Change No. Of Players
</P>

<P>
This will change the amount of players against each other.
</P>

<P>
F3 - F6
</P>

<P>
This will change the controls selected for the player associated
with each function key:
</P>

<P>
F3 = Player 1<BR>
F4 = Player 2<BR>
F5 = Player 3<BR>
F6 = Player 4
</P>

<P>
The available controls are:
</P>

<P>
Joy One --- Joystick Port<BR>
Joy Two --- Mouse Port<BR>
Joy Three - 4-Plyr Adaptor Port<BR>
Joy Four -- 4 Plyr Adaptor Port<BR>
Key Left -- w, z, a, d, LShift<BR>
Key Right - Arrow Keys & RShift
</P>

<P>
F7 - Few Enemies
</P>

<P>
By pressing this key, you can change the amount of enemies that will
appear every round.  The options are:
</P>

<P>
Few Enemies --- A few appear<BR>
Some Enemies -- Some Appear<BR>
Many Enemies -- lots of 'em<BR>
Low Random ---- A Small amount of different enemies appears<BR>
Medium Random - A Average amount of different enemies appears<BR>
High Random --- A Large amount of different enemies appears<BR>
No Enemies ---- If you want it 'Just Players'
</P>

<P>
F8 - Rounds To Win
</P>

<P>
All this means is the first person to get the amount of rounds you
set it to wins!
</P>

<P>
F9 - Computer IQ Level
</P>

<P>
Pressing this key will alter the intelligence level of the computer
controlled opponents from 0 to 7.
</P>

<P>
F10 - Not available in Opponent mode!
</P>

<H4>COMPUTER MODE</H4>

<P>
In this mode, you will play (join forces if you have more than one
player playing!) against the computer where you will be set against
level after level of computer enemies.
</P>

<P>
This is an ideal option for experienced players as you can make the
IQ level of the computer high and have a real challenge (especially
if you are playing alone).  Also, this is the best option for people
playing it alone!
</P>

<P>
The rest of the options will look like this:
</P>

<P>
F2 - Change No. Of Players
</P>

<P>
This will change the controls selected for the player associated
with each function key:
</P>

<P>
F3 = Player 1<BR>
F4 = Player 2<BR>
F5 = Player 3<BR>
F6 = Player 4
</P>

<P>
The available controls are:
</P>

<P>
Joy One --- Joystick Port<BR>
Joy Two --- Mouse Port<BR>
Joy Three - 4-Plyr Adaptor Port<BR>
Joy Four -- 4 Plyr Adaptor Port<BR>
Key Left -- w, z, a, d, LShift<BR>
Key Right - Arrow Keys & RShift
</P>

<P>
F3 to F6
</P>

<P>
This will change the controls selected for the player associated
with each function key i.e.  F3 would change the controls used for
Player 1, F5 would change the controls for Player 3, etc.
</P>

<P>
F9 - Computer IQ Level
</P>

<P>
Pressing this key will alter the intelligence level of the computer
controlled opponents from 0 to 7.
</P>

<P>
F10 - Enter Password
</P>

<P>
This, although not shown on the screen as an option allows you to
enter a password in order to continue where you left off last time.
Example; if you got to level 33, you would be able to continue at
level 31 again (providing you wrote the password down when it
appeared at the end of level 30!).
</P>

<H3>INTRODUCTION</H3>

<P>
The Aim Of The Game is similar to that of "Dynablaster" and "Bomberman"!
In that you run around the screen, dropping Bombs and attempting to destroy
the enemy (or each other when there's more than one player!) to advance to
the next level.
</P>

<P>
But in this case, it's more complicated as there is more to life
than Bomb.
</P>

<P>
So the rules are simple - Kill, Kill, and Kill really!!!
</P>

<P>
By the way, here are the characters names:
</P>

<P>
Red Player ---- Punky<BR>
Green Player -- Martian<BR>
Blue Player --- Jailbird<BR>
Yellow Player - Neando
</P>

<H4>CONTROLS</H4>

<P>
Up, Down, Left, Right move the guy you control Up, Down, Left, and
yep, you guessed it, Right.  Now things get more complicated.
</P>

<P>
By holding down fire and letting go again will drop a block on the
location you are standing.
</P>

<P>
The following are moves activated by holding down the fire button
and moving the corresponding way on the joystick/joypad/keyboard.
</P>

<P>
I've included the keyboard controls in the table in case you don't
know them!
</P>

<P>
-- Function - | Key Left | Key Right- | - Action ------ | Points<BR>
Tapping Fire  |Left Shift|Right Shift | Lays block ---- | 1
</P>

<P>
Fire & Up ---- | - W -- | Up Arrow -- | Drops a bomb ------ | 1<BR>
Fire & Right - | - D -- | Left Arrow- | Drops a thunderbolt | 2<BR>
Fire & Left -- | - A -- | Right Arrow | Lays a mine ------- | 2<BR>
Fire & Down x1 | - X -- | Down Arrow- | Lays a energy egg - | 4<BR>
Fire & Down x2 | - X x2 |Down Arrow x2| Lays a painter egg- | 5<BR>
Fire & Down x3 | - X x3 |Down Arrow x3| Lays a cruncher egg | 10<BR>
Fire & Down x4 | - X x4 |Down Arrow x4| Lays a hunter egg - | 15<BR>
Fire & Down x5 | - X x5 |Down Arrow x5| Lays a tank egg --- | 20
</P>

<P>
Right, that should have you nicely confused.  If you are wondering
'x3' is meant to mean, it means tapping down three times.  Example:
</P>

<OL>
<LI>Hold Fire Button down
<LI>tap down once, twice, and again
<LI>Release fire button
<LI>Voila, one cruncher egg
</OL>

<P>
Be careful not to push/tap another way while doing the process
otherwise you end up doing something else instead!  Practice is the
key.  Getting it right is all important in mastering the game.
</P>

<H3>GENERAL</H3>

<P>
Remember too that only a certain amount of hatched creatures i.e.
tanks, enemy droids, etc.  can be on screen at one time which means
that once that limit is reached, nothing else will hatch (including
your own eggs) until something is destroyed i.e.  a enemy tank,
painter, etc.  but the eggs don't stop appearing unfortunately.
</P>

<P>
Be careful of a chain reaction when there are so many eggs on the
screen as eggs also explode and can lead to a BIG chain reaction as
one will explode on to another one which will explode and so on.
</P>

<P>
I think I should point out the icons and display on the side of the
screen when you start a game.
</P>

<P>
The game screen is split into two areas (roughly):
</P>

<P>
The area you control the players and the area that shows your
player(s) stats.  You have your energy level indicated by the
numbers, then the picture of your player so you can identify him (or
her case you happen to be female!) and a little status box which
will show you what your current action is when you push down on fire
and (try to) perform a move.  It's a handy way of keeping track on
where you are in a complicated move.
</P>

<P>
In this game, you have intelligence.  Not you, but the players
rather (though it helps if you do too) and this is indicated next to
the status box by a sad/happy face.  Now this may be obvious but the
happier your face is, the more intelligent you are and in order to
become 'intelligent', you need to pick up IQ+ icons which randomly
appear around the screen.
</P>

<P>
There are a limited amount that appear so help other players by not
collecting IQ's if you already have full IQ (very happy face!  There
is a limit as to how far it will go!).
</P>

<P>
This is also true with energy icons (EN+) which give you 25 energy
points and are vital in survival.  Yes, this is a strategic game.
There are lots of ways to go about the game but I am not going to
spoil it for you.
</P>

<P>
On the controls section, I included the amount of energy each action
takes (Yes, you don't get it all for free you know!) so you do have
to make things count on this game!  Of course, it doesn't cost any
energy points to walk around!  (But be wary that the less energy
points you have, the slower you go and vice versa, although there is
a point where you can't go any faster otherwise.  Terrible things
could, and probably, Would happen.
</P>

<P>
Right, the bomb!  The bomb will explode after a certain period of
time.  This all depends upon how much IQ you have (This is an
important feature of the IQ.  This affects pretty much everything
you do really as I shall go on to explain.) as the more IQ you have,
the longer it will take to explode!  The bomb damages anything in
its path so be careful it doesn't damage you!
</P>

<P>
Getting hit in an explosion will take off 25 Energy points!  Be
careful when you're lacking on points.  Get your friends playing
with you to help you out!
</P>

<P>
A mine will do the same as a bomb but obviously won't explode until:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>An enemy walks over it (You or the other players don't set it
off!)
<LI>It has been left for a certain period of time (dependant on IQ
again!)
</UL>

<P>
A block is a block.  Use it for...  I'll let you work that out.  It
is probably one of the most useful things except from...
</P>

<P>
The thunderbolt!  The weapon of doom against the enemy.  Laying one
of these will cause those vertical and horizontal lines to be danger
zones for the enemy as if an enemy steps into the 'line of fire',
the thunderbolt will shoot off and attempt to hit the enemy (like a
homing missile!).  But of course, it will only stick to the line it
is moving along and explode where the enemy was (otherwise it would
be a bit to chaotic) so remember to lay a few along the line!
</P>

<P>
Now for the eggs! Remember that they have to:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>Hatch which takes time (The IQ factor comes into play again as
to how much time!)
<LI>Cost moreenergy points than a simple bomb, mine, etc.
<LI>The amount of IQ ALSO affects their PERFORMANCE as to what they
do.
</UL>

<P>
A painter egg is very useful in that it 'paints' over ANY EGG it
crosses, even the enemies (Which simply means it will become your
follower and part of your team!) so you can gain a great deal of
helpers at not much of a cost.  It isn't particularly strong so keep
this in mind when you are creating it and thinking statistics!
</P>

<P>
A cruncher egg has the simple use of destroying blocks in it's way!
Not really useful unless you're trapped in and need to get out
without destroying yourself.
</P>

<P>
Hunter eggs are good as they have strong armour and can withstand
alot of damage.  They try and home in on enemies with the sole
purpose of damaging the enemy by ramming it.  This does affect the
hunter but usually it will survive depending on the strength of the
enemy.
</P>

<P>
Tank eggs are the ultimate fighting machine, or are at least meant
to be.  Basically, they are a strong force that can shoot
thunderbolts at the enemy the same way as the players can.  Only
snag is that they are only any good if you have ALOT of IQ and also
that they cost 20 Energy points to produce.
