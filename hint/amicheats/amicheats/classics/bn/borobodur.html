<P>
During play go to the right and flick the switch. Now get all the
way to the left and flick that switch. Jump on to the rising log
and ride it to the top. At the top jump to the right and flick
that switch. Now kill yourself and you should restart at the
beginning. Next go to the left once again and flick the switch
that activates the log. Quickly jump on the log and ride the log up
half way and jump into the opening on the right. Kill the monster
and go to the right and climb the rope. You will see three
platforms, jump on to the middle one. Get as close to the left edge
as possible and press and hold the JOYSTICK DOWN and press and hold
the 'SPACEBAR' until a message appears and says NOW YOU'VE DONE IT.
This will give you invicibility and stops the clock. Press 'RETURN'
to skip levels.
