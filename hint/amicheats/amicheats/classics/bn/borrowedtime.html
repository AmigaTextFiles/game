<H2>SOLVE</H2>

<H3>THE THUG</H3>

<P>
I wasn't able to do anything about him. It seemed that he appeared
when I had taken too many moves between finding evidence or
obtaining information. I usually received a warning about three
moves before he started blasting.
</P>

<H3>GAME BEGINNING</H3>

<P>
You are in your office. Answer phone. Read your case files (all 7
of them). Go east to the little office and read the note. Take the
east exit to the alley. This is where the action starts!
</P>

<P>
Go east to the Dixie Arms Hotel. Hide behind the chair. Crawl
north. Lock the door. Go up to the attic. Break the window. Take
the shard of glass. Go east to the ledge. Climb the cable. When
you get to the second-story window of the Dublin Rose Bar, cut the
cable with the shard of glass.Go down to the bar.
</P>

<H3>LEBOCK'S HOUSE</H3>

<P>
If you are having trouble finding or entering Lebock's house, go to
the bar. Talk to the thug. Show gun to the thug. This will loosen
his lip but not enough. Show gun again. He will tell you the
location of the house and the password. The big bruiser, Rocco,
guards the door. Say "TINPLAYER" then enter. Lock the door.
Search fireplace. Take scrap of paper. Go east through the
curtain. Take the candlestick and wait. Hit Rocco with the
candlestick. Go east and exit back door.
</P>

<H3>RITA'S APARTMENT</H3>

<P>
You'll get hit over the head and tied by your wrists to the ceiling
beams. There is a table nearby. Look at table. Get the matches
and the candle. Light match then light candle. Burn twine.
(Amazing what you can do with your feet!) Search the kitchen. Take
Receipt. If you search enough, you'll find a key but getting it now
will cause you problems. Oh, well, go ahead move the stove and get
the key. Now your hands are burned and you can only carry a few
things. It would be best to visit the doctor now.
</P>

<H3>DOCTOR'S OFFICE</H3>

<P>
Tell the nurse you are a patient. You'll see Mongo through a
doorway. He is receiving medical treatment. Don't call attention
to yourself; listen. Search desk. Take the bandages. If you have
already burned your hands, *APPLY* bandages to your hands. Ah,
that's better!
</P>

<H3>SHACK</H3>

<P>
In case you haven't found the shack, it's at the west end of First
Street (just west of the hot dog vendor). Break the door. Untie
Mavis. Take the tube and the novel. Read the novel and take the
bookmark; it's a claim stub!
</P>

<H3>DORIS POLK'S APARTMENT</H3>

<P>
Located at the intersection of Pershing and Polk. Talk to Doris.
Ask her about Mongo, Lebock, Farnham, etc. Show stub to Doris.
This might be a good time to visit the car park.
</P>

<H3>STILES' SAFE PARK</H3>

<P>
If Jake is there alone, leave and return later. If two men are
there fighting, help Jake. Get gloves and cans. Show evidence to
police. You should have:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>cans
<LI>gloves
<LI>stub
<LI>tube
<LI>receipt
</UL>

<P>
Mongo will tell you about the key and the P.O. Box.
</P>

<H3>TRASH PILE</H3>

<P>
Search trash. Get bone. Remember, this might be a good place to
hide.
</P>

<H3>VISIT FARNHAM</H3>

<P>
Located at 85 West Polk. A tough looking guy guards the door. Talk
to man. Enter building. Talk to Farnham. Notice the dogs and what
Farnham says to them.
</P>

<H3>HOUSE WITH FENCE AND DOGS</H3>

<P>
Say HIYO to the dogs. Enter house. Talk to Shuman. Untie Rita and
Wainwright. Talk to Rita. Talk to Wainwright. Get report. Police
will take Shuman away.
</P>

<H3>BRUCE LIGHT'S HOUSE</H3>

<P>
Located at Sixth, West of Main, (blue brownstone). Knock on door.
Enter. Look at bottles. Wait for Light to appear. Ask Light about
Mongo, Farnham, etc. If he's reluctant to talk, show gun. Go
upstairs (big deal, huh?) Search. When Light is able to talk,
question him again.
</P>

<H3>P.O. BOX. (Post Office)</H3>

<P>
Unlock box 999. Get poem. Read it. There's a number written on
the back. Head for the Park.
</P>

<H3>PARK</H3>

<P>
Located at 6th and South Main. Go south of the statue to Tool Shed.
Set lock to 6316. Get shovel. Dig at statue. Get suitcase. Go
north. Thugs are chasing you from south, north and east. Go west.
Hide in Trash Pile.
</P>

<H3>TRASH PILE</H3>

<P>
You are hiding from the thugs. Give bone to dog. Wait. When dog
starts to bark again, go east. You should now have enough evidence
against Farnham to go to the police.
</P>

<H3>END GAME</H3>

<P>
Take evidence to Police Station. Tell police to arrest Farnham.
You should have the following evidence:
</P>
