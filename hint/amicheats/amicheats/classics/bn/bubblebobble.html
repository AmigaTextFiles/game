<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
These two hungry Dino-Mights and they've got bubble fight'n fun down
tight. You and your brontosaurus buddies, Bub and Bob, are up to
your brows in bubble trouble. You've got to battle battalions of
bullies by blowing and bursting billions of bubbles. It's a
fast-paced bubble banquet through over 100 screens of slap-happy
suds. Got an appetite for fun, then get blowin!
</P>

<H2>CHEATS</H2>

<P>
These function key cheats don't work on every release of the game,
but give it a try.
</P>

<P>
Press 'F1' to advance 1 level<BR>
Press 'F2' to advance six levels<BR>
Press 'F3' to advance eleven levels
</P>

<P>
These sequences must be entered on the title screen showing Bubble
Bobble written inside a cloud.
</P>

<DL>
<DT>'LEFT', 'JUMP', 'LEFT', 'F1', 'LEFT', 'BUBBLE', 'LEFT', 'F1'
<DD>It will say power up at the bottom of the screen and you will
have fast feet, fast bubbles, etc.
<DT>'BUBBLE', 'JUMP', 'BUBBLE', 'JUMP', 'BUBBLE', 'JUMP', 'RIGHT', 'F1'
<DD>The screen will say original game mode and you will get the bonus
doors to treasure rooms whether you die or not.
<DT>'F1', 'JUMP', 'BUBBLE', 'LEFT', 'RIGHT', 'JUMP', 'F1', 'RIGHT'
<DD>This gives you super on the title screen. You play the game in
the same order as normal Bubble Bobble but with different monsters.
This is the only mode that lets you see the "True Ending" to this
game.
</DL>

<P>
If you lose your last dino in a treasure room. Normally, you only
get treasure rooms if you have reached levels 20, 30 and 40 without
dying, and you exit a treasure room if you die once, so the only way
to do this is if you are using the "original game" cheat that gives
you treasure rooms anyway. When you lose your last dino in a
treasure room, your level is recorded as 102, and then all the demo
screens turn to treasure rooms and the next game you play you get a
treasure room on level 1!
</P>

<P>
When you finish the game in normal mode you see a screen telling you
"But it was not a true ending.....". To get the true ending to the
game all you need to do is enter the Super Bubble Bobble cheat at
the intro screen and finish the game with out losing a man (easier
typed then done) when you finish the game you will see your parents
rescued as well as your girlfriends. That's all there is too it.
</P>

<P>
This is one of the first games to feature bonuses when you entered
the right initials in the high score table. Just finish a game and
enter the initials below, the effects are described next to the
initials. They mainly effect the second bonus object that appears
on the first set. The best way to reap the rewards is to bubble the
3 monsters and wait for the second bonus to appear, get the bonus
and then blow as many bubbles as possible so you get the maximum
points available. You might want to blow bubbles and burst them
while you wait or run along the bottom of the screen to make certain
bonuses appear on the next level.
</P>

<P>

<H2>TIPS</H2>

<H3>LEVEL TIPS</H3>

<P>
While in the first screen, bubble the first two monsters and then
fill the screen with hundreds of bubbles. Bubble and burst the
remaining monster and the remaining bubbles should turn into fruit
(usually bananas), each of which is worth 500 points. Also, Hold
down 'FIRE' after losing your last life, and you should get another
set of lives, though your score will be reset.
</P>

<P>
If you can get to levels 10, 20, 30 and 40 without losing a life, a
magic door will appear to take you to a treasure screen, and if you
can get up to stage 50 without losing a life, a magic door will
appear and take you to level 70.
</P>

<P>
On levels 7 & 22 wait a few seconds until an umbrella falls and grab
it, you will warp ahead 6 levels.
</P>

<P>
Beating level 100: Jump on the small platforms to collect all the
green potion bottles. They will give you lightning bolts. Straight
away fall to the bottom left hand corner, face in to the corner and
fire like hell. The big guy at the end very rarely goes into the
bottom corner, if he does don't worry just repeat the above process.
After 100 hits, he will turn into a bubble. Pop him and you've done
it!
</P>

<H3>GENERAL TIPS</H3>

<P>
Yellow bubblegum - increase bubble firing speed<BR>
Purple bubblegum - make the bubble travel further<BR>
Blue bubblegum --- increase the bubble speed across screen<BR>
Red shoe --------- faster moving Bub and Bob
</P>

<P>
The fireball bubble is randomly created. Whenever a bubble floats
onto the screen, there is a 1 in 4096 chance that it is incarnated
as a fireball bubble.
</P>

<P>
EXTEND bubbles appear only on "open levels" (levels where bubbles
fly in from a "hole" in the ceiling or the bottom).
</P>

<P>
EXTEND bubbles appear only when you've popped in the previous
non-open-stages 3 or more enemy-trapped-bubbles at once. The more
enemies popped at once, the more DIFFERENT EXTEND bubbles will come.
</P>

<P>
So if you popped 2 enemy-trapped-bubbles on one stage there won't be
any extend bubble on the stage. But if you popped 3 on one stage
the next stage will have 1 extend bubble. If you popped 4 the next
stage will have 2 extend bubbles and so on. This means that if you
pop 8 enemy-trapped-bubbles at once on one stage the next stage will
give you all 6 extend bubbles!
</P>

<P>
Any EXTEND letters that you haven't collected by the end of a stage
reappear on the next open level, but are randomly selected again.
So if you are offered a letter that you don't need, it may be worth
leaving it, and hoping it is reincarnated as a more useful letter on
the next level.
</P>

<P>
Each treasure room has a secret message. The messages can be
decoded by recognising that the first 26 characters stand for the
letters of the alphabet. This code is needed to read the message
you get at the end of the game that tells you how to do a Super BB
power up.
</P>

<P>
When time runs out, and the skels come out to get you, if you die,
when you're brought back to life, and STILL FLASHING (vital!), run
over and touch your friend's skel. POOF! No more skel.
</P>

<P>
The fruit bonus is NOT random. If the hundreds and tens digits are
the same when you kill the last enemy, all bubbles on the screen
turn into fruit (levels 90-99 have different items, not fruit). A
nice trick here: Have one player ready to pop the last enemies, and
have the other player shoot bubbles into a wall until the digits
match... THEN have the first player kill them. You see, the game
doesn't care WHOSE digits match - could be either. Bonus fruit on
every round!
</P>

<P>
The items that you get for a score of the format abcdd0 are shown
here:
</P>

<P>
score --- item<BR>
...000 - french fries<BR>
...110 - double scoop ice cream cone<BR>
...220 - creme caramel<BR>
...330 - burger<BR>
...440 - slice of cake<BR>
...550 - cupcake<BR>
...660 - mug of beer<BR>
...770 - sausage on a stick<BR>
...880 - white ice cream cone<BR>
...990 - double blue lolly
</P>

<P>
The items that you get for matching your tens and hundreds to your
partner's are listed here. Although both the tens and hundreds
column need to be matched, only the tens column affects what item
appears. They turn out to be the lowest 10 food items (the
vegetables). They are, of course, all worth 700 points.
</P>

<P>
points - item<BR>
...00 - green pepper<BR>
...10 - aubergine<BR>
...20 - carrot<BR>
...30 - onion<BR>
...40 - beetroot<BR>
...50 - turnip<BR>
...60 - parsnip<BR>
...70 - marrow<BR>
...80 - pea pod<BR>
...90 - mushroom
</P>

<P>
Bubbles also turn into fruit if the hundreds and tens digits of the
scores of both players are the same (but the hundreds and tens not
necessarily the same as each other). eg BOTH players scores end in
...120.
</P>

<P>
Bubbles turn to fruit all the time on levels 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25,
30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 85, 86, 92, 93, 94.

"hurry" means the item may appear if the previous level told you to
'hurry up', but no skel appeared.
</P>

<H3>SPECIAL COUNTERS</H3>

<P>
The game maintains a bunch of counters which keep a record of how
many times you have done various things. Once a counter reaches its
threshold, it is reset to zero and you get the item which that
counter is associated with. Counters are only checked at the
beginning of each round. If two or more counters reach their
thresholds in the same round, the one which is associated with the
highest numbered item is used. The other(s) will keep their value
for the next screen. The counters aren't reset at the beginning of
each game.
</P>

<P>
In the following, the ITEM_DATA line contains:
</P>

<P>
XXXX ( AA BB CC DD ) EE
</P>

<P>
XXXX is the address of the counter which is used.
</P>

<P>
AA BB CC and DD are the 4 possible thresholds which the counter must
reach before you get the item. Which one of the 4 values is used
depends on the 'difficulty' setting that the game is currently
running at:
</P>

<P>
CC for difficulty 00-04<BR>
DD for difficulty 05-07<BR>
BB for difficulty 08-0B<BR>
AA for difficulty 0C-1E
</P>

<P>
Initial difficulties are: 0D (v.hard), 0A (hard), 04 (easy) and 07
(normal). The difficulty changes throughout the game, going higher
when you gain extra lives, lower when you die, and other things
affect it, too, which I don't know about.
</P>

<P>
EE is non-zero if the bell should warn us that the item is around.
</P>
