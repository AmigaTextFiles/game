<P>
During flight type "Fenny" (type exactly as printed with capital
"F").

<P>
As soon as you finish typing it you are taken into view mode which
allows you to cycle thru all the aliens and all the objects in the
game. You also have complete mouse control over them.
</P>

<P>
You can make them rotate and zoom in and out by holding down 'LEFT
MOUSE' and moving the mouse. To go to the next object hit 'RIGHT
MOUSE'. Pressing both mouse buttons will return you to the game.
