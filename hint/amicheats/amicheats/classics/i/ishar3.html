<H2>SOLVE</H2>

<P>
At the start, visit the person opposite. He will indicate the
position of Typhus Mernith's observatory on the map. Go to a shop
near the city walls and buy some lime liquor, then go to the town
entrance and buy a pass from the guard. Visit Typhus, give him the
liquor and he will give you the playing card. He will then show you
where Mather Fudius is on the map.
</P>

<P>
Visit Mather Fudius and pick up the scroll from the ground. Go to
the inn and listen. When Erkh Moltus is speaking to you, buy him
some food then listen to him again. Answer 'Yes' when he asks a
question.
</P>

<P>
At Mather's, give him the card when he says 'Out'. Wait until you
see the gate, then click on it to go through.
</P>

<P>
In the forest, head east to find a passage where there is a bear. Go
past it, then south, all the way down. Head east to find a racoon on
a rock. Take the scroll and return to Mather's via the gate.
</P>

<P>
Give the scroll to Mather, take the key and when he indicates a
house on the map, go and fetch the magic flask and the pendant. Walk
to the tavern, south of the theatre, and put the pendant on. Listen
and recover the Kelonia powder. Buy the other potions in the shops
then return to the racoon, give him the potion and recover the item.
</P>

<P>
Go to the theatre in the rich town and enter it after 7pm. Listen to
Gulnar and give him what you got from the racoon. Wait for the gate
to appear at 2am and go through. In the jungle, head south-east to
find the tribe with a chief. Kill him, find a crystal to the
south-west and go back to the town.
</P>

<P>
Walk back through the theatre gate and head east. Walk for a short
while, then go south to find a piece of a meteor in a dead end. Go
back into town and find a garden in the rich town. The meteor is
near the north wall: put the piece you found in the jungle on it to
make the gate appear, and go through it. In the mountains, find the
event generator towards the north-west. Put the crystal on it and
then head back to town. Find the gate that has just appeared in the
north-western part of the town. Go through it before 12. In the
dungeon, you need to free the captive princess. She is in a room
filled with lava. You must pass on three slabs to make the cage
drop. Enlist the princess' help then go back to town.
</P>

<P>
Find an inn, and get some rest. In a dream, a character tells you to
go to a house indicated on the map. Go to this house, take the key
from the fountain and enter to find five guards' uniforms. Go to the
palace, wearing the uniforms and make the princess wear a helmet as
well. Take the helmet off in front of Zoltar and enlist his help. Go
back to the forest where Zoltar and Thina will leave.
</P>

<P>
Head back to the town where Mather will give you a second crystal.
Place the second crystal on the generator in the mountains and then
go back to town. Go back to the mountains again to find a belt on
the ground towards the north, then head into town again. Go back to
the forest wearing the belt, go east and at the end, head south.
</P>

<P>
Find a house with Zoltar's son and his wife. He hands you a key
while the wife protects you from the dragon-fire.
</P>

<P>
Head back to town. Go to the door which leads to the dungeon and go
through it after 12. Finally, find the dragon and defeat him. You've
completed Ishar 3 - well done!
