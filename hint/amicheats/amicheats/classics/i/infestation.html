<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Infestation takes computer games to a new level of realism by
creating a complete environment stunningly rendered in super-fast 3D
vector graphics. You are completely free to move within the game
world, examining and manipulating objects just as you would in a
real world. This mathematically generated game sees the player take
over the terrifying role of Kai Solor, agent for the interplanetary
Federation. The mission is to eliminate the threat of hostile
life-forms. Travelling to Xelos by interplanetary cruiser, it will
be necessary to enter station Alpha II, seek out the alien's eggs
and equipped with a sophisticated pressurized body suit complete
with a helmet, oxygen pack, battery pack, and cartridge pulse rifle
which provides more than just protection. As station Alpha II is
spread out over three levels, there are shafts, lifts, ventilation
tunnels, radiation areas, network terminals, and blast doors - all
of which need to be dealt with if the player is to survive.

<H2>HINTS</H2>

<P>
To get into the underground complex, first find a small, upright,
rectangular box with two flashing squares on it; thats the computer
terminal. Face the flashing squares, hit 'F2' to bring up the
computer, and enter the words "KAL SOLAR" to activate it. hit 'F2'
again to exit. On your way to the computer, you should have passed
a shower like structure. That's the transpoorter.
