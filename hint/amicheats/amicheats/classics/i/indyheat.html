<P>
On the equipment select screen (before you enter your initials),
press 'P' to pause the game and type "AMANDA". The border should
flash to let you know it worked. Now enter your initials and
select your driver and as soon as your done you should notice that
you now have 9 coins and 900,000 dollars. You can also pause the
game during play and type the cheat, and the next time you are at
the equipment screen you will be blessed with the coins and cash.
