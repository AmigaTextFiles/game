<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
In Level 4, walk around the ring on the floor three times to open
the floor.
</P>

<P>
In level 7, when Norlac dives underwater, you must hurry back and
throw yourself into the whirlpool rather than climbing the ladder.
</P>

<P>
In level 8, to defeat the dragon and Mordamir, use the BLINK spell
six times, then use the fire protection spell just before he
breathes fire at you, and not when he takes a quick breath. When he
pauses, hold up the amulet and Mordamir will spin in. Use the
STATUE spell three times to avoid being killed by the lightning,
then just as he starts his next spell, put up a SONIC spell. Use
STATUE twice more and when he animates the bones, hit the statue
just before they reach you. He will now say that you have no more
defences, so wait until he holds up the amulet then cast the
MAGNETIC spell. Bingo - end of game.
</P>

Prepare to use blink spells. You must blimk every time the dragon
breathes fire at you so timing is crucial. Blink just after the
dragons head moves back and you should avoid its flames. The dragon

releases the fire use the fire protection spell and the flames don't
harm you. Hold the amulet up again. Mordamir himself appears.
