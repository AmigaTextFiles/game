<H2>SOLVE</H2>

<P>
Listen to the wind when you arrive and look around carefully. When
you see a man, walk towards him. If you talk to him he will tell you
about the good pub guide. He can be enrolled in your team, but he is
a traitor, so take his gold and place him in the front row.
</P>

<P>
Now travel NE and near a pool you will find a young maiden called
Kiriela, who will prove an asset to the team, so enlist help and
place her in the second row having prepared a fireball rune.
</P>

<P>
You can now take a trip to Angarann where there are some wandering
Orcs for you to gain some experience on and get paid for doing it.
You should also visit Akeer who will give you a clue. Travel to the
pub and get drunk.
</P>

<P>
While in this state enrol a fellow warrior called Kirian. When
sober, assess your weapons and buy accordingly. Remembering that it
takes 1000 coins to save your adventure! Now head S and you will
come to a house with a large amount of gold. You can take the gold
because it's free. Take the bridge to Lotharia, where in one of the
pubs you will find the Unknown who can be taught the lightning
spell; you will need it later on.
</P>

<P>
Travel S and you will come to what looks like a bridge guarded by a
barbarian. It is, in fact, Lake City, so kill him, gain your reward,
eat and rest in the pubs. Targhan and Fhironn can be enrolled if
need be. Remember to take their gold.
</P>

<P>
Head S once more to cross the bridge and then turn S to find the
lizard's house and the gold in the bushes. From here, head E to
Rhudgast and when you reach the border turn N.
</P>

<P>
Travel around a bush-type maze and you'll encounter the White
Knight. Be warned - he will take some killing. The fireballs and
lightning are useful here. When you have fried him, take his helmet
as it will allow you to detect the predator later.
</P>

<P>
If you look around there is another bag of gold hidden in the
bushes. Go S from here and you will come across the spirit of
Azalghorm, who will tell you about three quests. If you follow the
river S you will find a pedestal with a Runic Tablet on it - take
this and it will offer some sort of protection later on.
</P>

<P>
From here head E, put on the White Knight's helmet and enter
Fimnuirh Forest. Find the predator, kill and take the fire rings
from him. At this point in the game it may be a good idea to go back
to Lotharia to rest and see what you can learn.
</P>

<P>
Head back to where you killed the White Knight, travel E until you
reach the river then head N. Eventually you'll find some dwarves who
are looking for a fight. Take their gold when you have killed them.
If you side step into the woods, in the distance you will see the
entrance to the Dungeon of Rhudgast Forest.
</P>

<P>
In here are four keys, two lots of food, three throwing knives, a
flask for mixing potions, a flask of oil, two treasure chests full
of gold and a runic tablet.
</P>

<P>
In here is also a very powerful giant, who is blocking the way to
the flask room. It's best to blast him with everything you've got
and then go back to Lotharia to recharge your psychic energy. The
skeletons in the dungeon regenerate, so kill them and collect as
fast as you can.
</P>

<P>
Go N to the river and travel E to the bridge, kill the dwarves and
then cross the bridge. Head E to the next river and then N to the
next bridge. This is guarded by a large minotaur, so have plenty of
psychic energy ready. There is a bag of gold lying around and also a
dwarf who will offer to join you.
</P>

<P>
Going N from this bridge is a merchant who will sell you a potion
for 5000 gold coins. After trading it is a good idea to recharge
your energies before crossing the bridge because there are a lot of
barbarians hanging around and also a giant called Gato who guards a
tortoise, which will be traded with another merchant for a useful
potion later on. Cross the bridge and head S to the large city of
Urshurak, which is full of orcs, shops, spell learning and, best of
all, plenty of good pubs. Search and listen well.
</P>

<P>
West of Urshurak is Kandomir where Jon the Alchemist lives. If
you're intelligent enough you'll be able to read a scroll that will
tell you about the potions you can make from the supplies that can
be found and bought in the shops.
</P>

<P>
It is now time to travel to Halindor which is north east of
Urshurak, where you learn that Erwin's daughter has been kidnapped
and is held in Elwingil.
</P>

<P>
You will rescue her, but be warned - one of your party will fall in
love with her and you will need a 'disrupt charm' before you take
her back to Erwin's house. If you are successful, Erwin will give
you a key to Valathar Dungeon.
</P>

<P>
In Zendoria there is a merchant who requires Turtle. It will be used
for the pig transformation potion. In Baldaron there is a rock
containing a magic sword. If you cannot pull it out, kill a few more
baddies and try again.
</P>

<P>
On the way to and from Elwingil are two fireball throwing wizards
for which you will need to distribute the fire rings from the
predator. In Gilaras there is another runic tablet which you can
collect, but before you do, you had better have a cure blindness
potion because as soon as you step over the border you will be
struck blind.
</P>

<P>
North of Halindor is the forbidden house which contains another
runic tablet, although 'brain wash' potion for all the party will be
needed. In Elwingil, the orcs regenerate every time you enter, so
take your time, go in and out, collect a lot of money and rest in
the pubs.
</P>

<P>
When you have gained enough skills, leave Elwingil and head for
Halindor then head E. In some birch trees you will find a
transporter. Take the transporter and it will take you over the
river into another Elwingil. Do not be confused - keep heading E and
you will come to Fhulbrod Forest. It is here you will find a trader
who will give you something for free. If you enter the forest and
try to find a clearing you will be attacked by dwarves, then you'll
find a pig.
</P>

<P>
This is really Morgula, a witch who was transformed, so now you know
why you want a 'pig transformation' potion. The witch has the much
needed Anti-Krogh spell. She has a very low constitution so give her
plenty of food. It is now a good idea to travel to a city to
strengthen her as much as possible for the task ahead.
</P>

<P>
Remember that in Elwingil lives Thorm, who has some monk's robes
that you will need later on, so go up to Thorm and collect them. By
now all your party should be on level ten and have collected 31,000
experience points - if not, it is a very good idea to go and collect
them because they will be needed soon.
</P>

<P>
You should also have four out of five members of your team carrying
runic tablets. Head back towards the Fhulbrod Forest and then head
N.
</P>

<P>
Make sure that all of the team have a 'brain wash' potion and you
can use a protection spell or something similar because you will
meet a very powerful wizard who could blind, inverse and bind your
party. Some effects wear off, but not inversion.
</P>

<P>
When you have despatched the wizard you will gain the entrance to
the Valathar Dungeon. Make sure that your team have been refreshed.
If they haven't then now is a good time to refresh them.
</P>

<P>
Having opened the door with Erwin's key you can enter the dungeon.
The first few rooms contain zombies that you can burn quite easily.
Be on the look-out for treasure and food, and most important of all,
try to find a key.
</P>

<P>
Leave through the opening and you will find at the junction that
there is a locked door. Turn right into a diamond-shaped room, this
is where the Black Knight lives. Instead of swapping tales about
good and evil and generally being polite, fireball him.
</P>

<P>
Continue into the next room and then turn right and enter a maze
that contains treasure, oil and yet another key. Open the locked
door in the Black Knight's room and follow the maze. Collect the oil
and eventually you'll come to a T-junction.
</P>

<P>
Turn left into a room with two levers and a key in it. Operate the
lever that was on the far wall as you first came into the room. This
lever opens the barred gate at the other end of the T-junction.
Going that way you will encounter a spider guarding some food, and
you'll also come across yet another key.
</P>

<P>
Now go back to the locked door and open it. Collect the oil and
travel up the top of the corridor. To the right is a giant to be
sorted out. Once the giant is defeated you will gain another key.
</P>

<P>
Go through the opening in the distance. You will be confronted by a
baddie through the archway, so fireball him. If you are running low
on energy at this point, go back and refuel - remember that the
zombies you killed previously will regenerate. Find the correct
combination of levers to gain an exit from these two corridors, at
the end of which there is a long corridor with a T-junction. Some
Blue Ghouls will appear from nowhere and attack you you; defeat them
with your team.
</P>

<P>
The left hand exit has some oil to be collected. The right hand exit
leads to some more ghouls and a spiral corridor which terminates
with a key and a transporter which will take you to the next dungeon
level. Now is the time to recharge again because there is plenty of
work to be done before you complete the game.
</P>

<P>
Use the teleport to go to the second level, immediately go left and
left again into a corridor with a lever and a door in it. This is a
gas chamber, so give each of the party a drink of the 'worgaz'
potion to protect them. Once you've done that pull the lever, this
will allow gas to enter the room, but the door will now open.
</P>

<P>
Search everywhere because there is a lot of treasure to be found. At
the other end of the room is another lever; pull this and you are
now through the gas chamber. There are two exits to this room, both
of which are guarded by some very deadly skeletons.
</P>

<P>
Search both exits and you will gain more treasure and a key. Now
head back to the gas chamber - remember to use the correct potion
again. Return to the teleport room that you first arrived at,
strengthen your team and then head S. After not too long you will
come across a treasure box and a corridor to the right. Contained
within is a Demon.
</P>

<P>
Protect your team of adventurers before attempting to kill it. This
diamond-shaped room contains two doors for you to search behind.
Travel E from the diamond-shaped room and you will come across a
lever. Pull the lever and travel down the corridor to the west and
you will find some oil. Carry on W and then turn S and you will have
a choice of three corridors. Each one leads to the same room.
</P>

<P>
This room contains the last runic tablet - however, it is guarded by
lots of spiders. There are also two hidden rooms; one to the south
and one to the north. Now go back to where you pulled the lever. It
might be a good idea at this point in the game to go and recharge
all the members of your team.
</P>

<P>
In the big room facing the lever is a maze complex containing more
treasure, oil and another room containing a talisman (it looks like
a jewelled broach). While you were wandering around you should have
found a wall with three levers.
</P>

<P>
These levers operate the last barred gate - it is the outside two
that need pulling. You can then travel up the last corridor and be
met by Medusa. It would be a very good idea to use the 'brain wash'
potion again and then go and kill her.
</P>

<P>
Be extremely careful though because around the next corner is her
pet dragon who will take some killing. Finish him off and then
strengthen your team. You will now need to be wearing the monk's
robes - after this transport there is no going back! Kill the monk
and then use the transporter.
</P>

<P>
You will arrive in a very long corridor which is guarded by three
powerful monks, if you've got the potions to recharge your team's
psychic energy then now would be a good time to do it.
</P>

<P>
After this you will confront Krogh himself, so protect your team of
adventurers and use the Anti-Krogh spell, hit as often as you can
with any weapon you can, because he has many hit points (the magic
sword takes off 720 points) and with any luck you should survive
having killed him. The defeat of Krogh means that your adventure is
at an end and Ishar is long gone and completed.
