<P>
While playing, press 'P' to pause the game and type "NCC-1701". Then press
'N'? The screen should flash. Press 'P' again to unpause and from there
on, both players should have infinite lives.

<P>
After defeating a Goosecopter, fire continously at one of the tokens.
After 32 hits, it will turn into a star, which when collected will yield
mega-powerful six-way fire. Just be careful not to hit the token again
before collecting it, or it will revert back to the one of the ordinary
power-up tokens.
