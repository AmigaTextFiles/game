<P>
At the end of level 1 make sure you only have one life left and
knock out all of the guns and green monsters, then crash into the
machine the monster was in. You'll start level 2 with infinite
lives.
</P>

<P>
Confront the end of level gaurdians with one life intact. Press
'D' then crash into it's dead body. You'll now have infinite lives.
