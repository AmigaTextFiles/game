<H2>CHEATS</H2>

<P>
On the title screen, type "DINGADINGDANGMYDANGALONGLINGLONG". Lee
and Ralph's noses will turn green. Now during play, press 'RETURN'
to skip levels and press 'TAB' to top of the sleep bar and to get 9
attempts to spell comic. Tapping 'M' will give you a full level
map.
</P>

<P>
To find 'COMIC':
</P>

<UL>
<LI>'C' is above the shop canopy and to the left of the nite club
<LI>'O' is past the bouncer
<LI>'M' is past the sewer water to the left
<LI>'I' is up and to the left past the telegraph cable above the car
<LI>'C' is along the top right of the map
</UL>

<H2>FUN</H2>

<P>
Pick up the beard near the first 'C'. Goto the sewer exit near the
traffic lights, hit the four arrows. Go through the sewer to the
right for a secret massage.
