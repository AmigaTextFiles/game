<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
In Savage, the player is a powerful warrior searching for his
kidnapped princess. To rescue her, the hero must battle his way
through three challenging game scenarios. In the first, the hero
beginning with only a battle axe, must survive the evil creatures
and unavoidable obstacles within a tunnel-ridden dungeon. Giant
dragons, strange, demon-like creatures and other unusual monsters
attack the player as he searches for weapons and treasure to
continue pursuit of his maiden. In the second level of play, Savage
is on foot, racing toward the castle where his princess is held
captive. The player must negotiate his way through fast-scrolling
screens, avoiding the obstacles that appear without warning to
intercept him. In the third and final level of play, the hero
telepathically communicates with a magical eagle that flies through
a mystical maze seeking to complete the quest. More evil demons,
strange creatures and lethal traps appear throughout in a attempt to
thwart the final stage of the rescue. Savage is a great diversion
from the real world.

On the title screen on part two, type "BRUISER" for infinite lives.

<P>
Right at the beginning of the game (blue sector) you will find a
well on the left. Run towards it and jump before you hit the wall.
Now you will find yourself at the other side of it. Keep on
walking to the left and you will notice the screen going crazy.
Waggle the joystick in all directions and after a while you will
find yourself in the red sector. Once in the red sector do the same
as in the blue sector. Now you go to the purple sector. Do the
same as in the red and blue sectors. A message appears that you
have completed game one and the code word for game two.
