<H2>GENERAL TIPS</H2>

<DL>
<DT>THE MOTHERSHIP
<DD>It follows you around generating meanies and can take many
hits. Ram rather than shoot.
<DT>HOMING WEAPONS
<DD>Retreat as fast as possible then shot them. Most homing
weapons have a limited range and can be out run.
<DT>BLITZKRIEG
<DD>The best attack is a fast one. Attack a generator by flying
along power barriers at full speed. Learn to recognise the edge
barriers. Barriers you can shut down never merge with the edge,
and nearly always lead to a generator.
