<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Adult graphic adventure game. As Captain Brad Stallion you must
locate The Tribe, a colony of beautiful female clones from the
planet Mondo who have been raiding the male population. Cruise
throughout the galaxy in a one-man vehicle.
</P>

<H2>FUN</H2>

<P>
First and formost, hit 'Ctrl-S' when you enter a room or when
something happens to see Sandie's reaction. Sometimes helpful,
sometimes not.
</P>

<P>
Blast off standing up. (Wonder how She-La survived at the end?)
</P>

<P>
'KILL SANDIE'. Didn't need that bitch anyway. Alternately, 'KISS'
her at the control panel, 'MAKE LOVE', 'RUB TITS', 'RUB SNATCH',
'JACK', ya know, the usual sex stuff. You can also use this sort of
stuff with the other ladies you encounter.
</P>

<P>
Break their hearts... When you get 'D'own with a woman, immediately
get back 'U'p. oooOOOOooo... Hell hath no fury like a woman
scorned, eh?
</P>

<P>
Piss of the guy in the space station... 'EAT EGG' and die of food
poisoning. 'PICK UP EGG' or 'PICK UP CHERRY' from the galley and
watch him blow his top. Of course, if you're feeling a little light
footed, 'KISS' him. You can also make the mistake of going to
'SLEEP' in the barracks or even in your own bed.
</P>

<P>
If you don't 'EAT CHERRY', you will die when you try and make love
with She-La. You can also die if you try to do anything to the
guards they don't like, such as running away, fighting 'em, or
trying to grab anything belonging to LaLust that you shouldn't. You
will also die if you forget to fix up the Sex-Ray.
</P>

<H2>SOLVE</H2>

<P>
Starting off you see your space ship. The magic word is 'SPACE'.
Go 'N'orth to your control panel and just to get the magic message.
'N'orth again to receive a very important message. Sit your butt
'D'own and 'BLAST' off for Fed Planet One.
</P>

<P>
Now get back 'U'p, and let's jam 'S'outh, 'S'outh and 'S'outh yet
again to get to the air-lock. 'OPEN' the air-lock and go 'S'outh to
exit the Thruster. Go 'E'ast to the car, and 'GET IN'. No
controls, but it wants your credit card so 'GET CARD' out of your
pocket and 'INSERT CARD' into the slot. You automatically go
cruisin' to the Pink Flamingo Hotel where you go 'S'outh and 'S'outh
again to get to the hotel desk. As in real life, never pass up free
money so 'GET COIN' and now we gotta pay the robot. 'GET CARD' from
your pocket again and 'GIVE CARD' to the robot. Go 'W'est to the
lift, and again, since you want to go up, 'GET CARD' from your
pocket and 'INSERT CARD' into the lift device.
</P>

<P>
You are in your room. Let's go to the bathroom first, so go 'E'ast
and ... instant woman capsules? Gotta get one of these. 'GET
COIN' out of your pocket (yeah, for such a studly dude, this guy
goes digging around in his pockets a lot) and 'INSERT COIN' into the
machine. 'GET CAPSULE', and who cares what that Sandie thinks. Go
'W'est back to the bedroom, and 'TURN ON COMPUTER'. What do we
want? Why, Lila of course, so tell 'em to 'SEND MAID' up to your
room. She is, of course, impressed by you. Give her what she wants
so get 'D'own on the bed and 'MAKE LOVE' with her. Yup, it's a
dirty thankless job doing things this way, but someone has to do it.
'ASK' her for some information about the Tribe and she will spill
her guts to ya. Our job is finished here, so go 'W'est, 'S'outh,
'S'outh, 'U'p into the BT, and 'N'orth, 'N'orth, 'N'orth to our
control panel. Sit 'D'own again and 'BLAST' off for what's his
face's space station.
</P>

<P>
When you arrive, get 'U'p, 'S'outh three times to get to the
air-lock, 'OPEN' it, go 'S'outh, 'OPEN' the space station's airlock,
and let's take a look around. Go 'W'est to the kitchen and 'EAT
CHERRY' since you're kind of hungry. We want to find the guy who
runs the place so 'E'ast and 'S'outh and you see him. We want to
'ASK' him about Mongo, but he won't tell you anything without
something in return so 'GET CAPSULE' from your pocket and 'GIVE
CAPSULE' to the horny guy. He gives you the navagational code to
the next place and like magic you're back at your controls. Sit
'D'own and 'BLAST' to Mongo.
</P>

<P>
Get 'U'p again, 'S'outh three times to the air-lock, 'OPEN', and
step out 'S'outh to take a look at Mongo. Yeah, very clever hills.
Go any direction twice (let's say 'N'orth, 'N'orth) and, uh oh, it's
the goon squad. A bunch of blue chicks wanna see what you're made
of so 'UNDRESS' for 'em. They toss you in prison with She-La who
will help you escape, for a price. Get 'D'own and with her and
'FUCK SHE-LA''s brains out. Exhausting, but you must go on so 'ASK'
her how to escape. You get booted down a shaft and end up in some
sort of lab. Go 'E'ast and, hey, lookie here, it's a Sex-Ray.
'PRESS GREEN' button to turn that sucker on. 'PRESS RED' to make it
fuck up. Now go 'W'est and 'W'est again to where you got two of the
amazon guards waiting there to capture you again. They take you to
La-Lust, but she looks like a shapeless yellow blob with too much
eyeliner. Still, screw up your courage and get 'D'own onto her bed
and 'MAKE LOVE' to her. Yeah, pretty impressive, but she wants to
show you the Sex-Ray in action, so do anything at all really (like
'N'orth). Ha, joke is on her. You wanna blow this fiesta before it
destructs all around you, so 'E'ast outta there. Whoops, looks like
our only hope is one of those Sky Bikes so 'RIDE BIKE' back to your
ship, go 'U'p into the Big Thruster. You're at the control panel.
Sit 'D'own a final time, and 'BLAST' off that hellhole and you have
won the game. Hit a directional key to see your prize and then
'Ctrl-S' if ya want to see the 'hey dude, you won' text.
