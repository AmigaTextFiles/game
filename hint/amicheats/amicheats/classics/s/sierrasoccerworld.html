<P>
If you get to the penalty shoot-out and you are not very good at
saving goals, then as the opposing team player is running towards
the penalty spot press 'C', 'F2' and fire. This should cause a
white wall to spring up out of the ground in front of him, and his
shots will either miss the goal or fly straight into your arm.
</P>

<P>
To stop the opposition from scoring penaties, press 'C', 'F2' and
fire when goalkeeping and a wall should appear and you'll never let
any goals in.
</P>

<P>
Choose to play a friendly match, and when picking your teams, press
'X' on the keyboard. The screen will flash and you'll be playing on
a blue pitch which makes the ball extra bouncy.
