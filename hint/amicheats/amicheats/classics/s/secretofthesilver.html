<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Set in TSR's Forgotten Realms game world, the gamer will explore the
most sophisticated AD&D fantasy role-playing games which include
mines, dungeons, ruins, and ice castles. The player will battle
monsters never before encountered, such as gargoyles, cloud giants,
hydras, and other fierce foes. With the use of higher character
levels, the user can invoke many other new powerful spells like:
barkskin, charm person, delayed blast, and the fireball.
</P>

<H2>CHEATS</H2>

<P>
Once you find any item you can make as many copies of it as you

<LI>Drop the dummy character from the party.
<LI>Repeat steps 4-6 as many times as needed.
</OL>

<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
SECRET OF THE SILVER BLADES is semi-linear. There are certain
objects that need to be found before you can proceed to the next
part of the game, but most of the missions in the game can be done
in any order. There is a preferred order though, since the battles
get progressively tougher as you get closer to the end. The
walkthru will indicate the order for those missions where the proper
sequence is necessary.
</P>

<P>
The game has a built-in hint book. If you feed 100 gems to the Well
of Knowledge, you will get a hint and outright answers in some
cases. Information that you can get from the Well is not duplicated
in this solve except for a few cases where the Well is vague.
</P>

<P>
There are two basic types of mazes in this game: huge and the more
normal 16x16 mazes. The map coordinates are always shown in this
game, but in the huge mazes, sometimes the map coordinates are
wrong. The error is usually in the "X" coordinate. Whenever
possible, both the correct and incorrect values are given in this
solve. Because of this bug, you may find the coordinates in the
solve do not match those in your game.
</P>

<P>
Be aware that some ranged spells are Touch range spells when cast
from a scroll, but operate normally when cast from memory. The ones
that are known to be Touch range when cast from a scroll are the
Slay Living, Disintegrate, and Death spells. There are undoubtedly
others.
</P>

<P>
There are several new monsters of note. The worst is the iron
golem. These are immune to most magic. Magic missile and fireball
will actually heal them. Lightning will slow them down. The only
way to fight them is to first use lightning to slow them down, then
hack them to pieces. Only magic weapons +3 or better will harm the
golems.
</P>

<P>
The Remorhaz automatically kill your characters if they succeed in
an attack. Fortunately, they have poor THAC0 values and can usually
be killed before they can strike.
</P>

<P>
Purple Worms also do something to your characters when they make a
successful hit, but all my characters have been fortunate enough to
be unaffected when hit.
</P>

<P>
Umber Hulks have a gaze that is equivalent to a Confusion spell.
Dispel Magic will restore your characters.
</P>

<H2>SOLVE</H2>

<H3>NEW VERDIGRIS</H3>

<P>
You start the game in the house of the Mayor of New Verdigris. Your
first mission is to free the Well of Knowledge from whatever has
captured it. There is a teleporter (3,0) in the Mayor's house that
will take you directly to the Well maze.
</P>

<P>
The first order of business is to explore the town of New
Verdigris.You need to locate the important places, such as the
armory, vault (the vault is a file VAULT.DAT in the save directory),
training hall, magic shop, bar, and temple. Locating these places
is left as a mapping exercise for the player. The exit from town is
at (15,8). It leads to the ruins of old Verdigris. In addition,
one of the private residences (3,9) has an old man who will give you
a Scroll of Protection from Dragon's Breath. You may need it for
the last Well battle.
</P>

<P>
Buy mirrors for everyone. You will need them for the basilisks and
medusa in this game. The Cute Yellow Canary does what you expect it
to do in the mines, but it is really useless. If you follow the
walkthru you will not need it. If you want to explore the mines
fully, you will have to pass through the poison air pockets and take
the hits anyway.
</P>

<H3>THE WELL</H3>

<P>
The map of the Well area on page 2 of the Journal is correct. There
are two errors in the map which may be corrected in your edition of
the Journal. There is a north/south corridor to the northwest of
the Well that is shown as being six squares long; it is actually
five squares long. There is also a door that is missing in one of
the western rooms. What looks like a dead end is not. The Well is
shown as part of the Old Verdigris ruins. There is a 16x16 blank
spot in the ruins that corresponds to the Well maze, but the Well is
actually a separate maze with its own map coordinates.
</P>

<P>
There are three battles that you have to fight to free the Well.
Each battle is triggered as you step into each ring of the Well, and
each gets progressively more difficult. Save the scroll you got
from the old man until the last Well battle, and have the character
with the lowest hit points use it. You face an increasing number of
bigger dragons with each battle. The last one is with a really big
dragon. You can rest any place in the Well after you have freed it.
</P>

<P>
Once you free the Well, explore every square of it. With a few
exceptions that are noted in the walkthru, all the teleporters
connect to the Well. You have to step into the squares that are in
the Well-end of each gate to activate the other end of the gates
(when you eventually find them). These gates are very useful for
getting back to town for training. They also come in handy for
resupplying when you are clearing some mazes that are far from town.
</P>

<P>
Another reason for exploring the Well area is you will find the true
nature of the owner of the Magic Shop. You will find a battle
between Bane clerics and the Black Circle. The best action is to
duck and wait out the battle. You will have to fight the survivors,
but you will also face a smaller force. Try visiting the square at
(4,14).
</P>

<P>
Afterwards, it should be clear the Black Circle is Evil. When you
return to town, it's time to have a long talk with Marcus, the owner
of the Magic Shop. Explore the Magic Shop and expect a fight in
every room. You can expect random attacks by Fire Knives until you
clear the Magic Shop. Once you get rid of Marcus, the prices in the
Magic Shop will drop drastically. The shop will continue to operate
until you have defeated the Dreadlord. Then, it closes up tight.
Towards the end when you have lots of money, stock up on wands of
magic missiles and +1 arrows, and store them in the town vault if
you wish to continue playing.
</P>

<H3>RUINS OF OLD VERDIGRIS</H3>

<P>
At this point, you can start exploring and mapping the old Verdigris
ruins. The maze is about 85x60 and needs to be carefully mapped.
Be aware that this is one of the huge mazes where the map
coordinates are not always correctly shown. There are two sub-mazes
in this maze: The Well is one, and the old administration building
is the other. Exiting these sub-mazes into the main ruins maze is
usually when the map coordinates become incorrect.
</P>

<P>
The first item you need to complete the game is an Amulet of
Eldamar. Journal entry 1 is the map to the amulet. You get the
Journal entry from the Well. The Well will hint as to the location
of another dragon hoard. It's not required that you find this
hoard, but if you want the experience points and loot it offers,it's
at location 11,0. Additionally, there are two other optional fixed
encounters with Bane clerics in the maze that will yield useful
loot. They appear to be triggered if you step into any one of
several different locations. The first square of the set you step
into will trigger the encounter. Each encounter appears to have a
different set of trigger locations. To trigger these encounters try
leaving the Well by the northwest door and explore north. Try
stepping into locations (56,29) and (59,22).
</P>

<P>
Other than the amulet, there is nothing vital in the maze. It's
only necessary to explore it to locate certain places you will need
to go to later: the old administration building and the mine shaft.
There are two mine shafts in the ruins. Only the one shown on the
map in the Journal works; the other is abandoned and there only to
confuse you.
</P>

<H3>OLD ADMINISTRATION BUILDING</H3>

<P>
The Black Circle Headquarters is in the old administration building.
There is a 16x16 blank spot in the ruins that corresponds to the
building, but the building is really a separate maze. Journal entry
38 shows the location of the building. You can get the Journal
entry from the Well, or you can find it yourself by exploring the
ruins.
</P>

<P>
Clearing the Black Circle Headquarters requires that you explore
every room. The important locations in this area are the room at
10,5 and the Inner Sanctum at 14,14. Both places have teleporters
back to the Well if you need to get more supplies, dispose of loot,
or get training.
</P>

<P>
There is a secret doorway at 8,4 that you have to look for. You
will encounter the clerk from Phlan in the building. Be nice to
her. If you played POOL OF RADIANCE, you will appreciate finding
out that her name is Sasha. After you clear out the Black Circle
Headquarters, wander over to location (54,52) of the ruins or
thereabouts. You will get the first of many opportunities to rescue
the clerk. Leaving the administration building back into the ruins
will almost certainly cause the map coordinates to be wrong; be
careful.
</P>

<P>
At this point, you have done all that is needed in the ruins. You
can finish mapping the ruins, or you can get on with the game. The
next step is to descend into the mines.
</P>

<H3>THE MINES</H3>

<P>
You can descend into the mines at any time, but it is better if you
wait until you have finished the ruins first. The battles become
tougher in the mines, and the experience points you get in the ruins
are useful for gaining character levels. At first, you can only go
to the Temple level. The Temple of Tyr is to the south. There is
nothing else of any interest on that level. You will have to fight
to get into the temple.
</P>

<P>
Derf Strongarm is at 14,2. There is a teleporter back to the Well
at 2,15. Explore the rooms in the west side of the Temple. There
is loot and information to be found there. Once you have learned
the secret of the Silver Blades and the Dreadlord from Derf, you can
descend into the rest of the mines to retrieve the parts of Oswulf's
staff. You need the staff before you can proceed to the next stage
of the game.
</P>

<P>
The mine mazes are large but simple. It is only necessary to note
the coordinates of the intersections, and which directions the
shafts branch off at each intersection.
</P>

<P>
The Well will tell you in which direction to proceed at each level
to find the staff, but if you want explicit directions, read on.
All coordinates are approximate since several of the intersections
are several squares in size. All directions start off from the mine
shaft at (50,50). There appears to be no coordinate problems in the
mines.
</P>

<P>
LEVEL 1: Go west to the intersection at (35,49). Go north to the
intersection at (38,44). Go west to the intersection at (18,41).
Go north. Level 1 has useful loot, so it is worthwhile to explore
that level.
</P>

<P>
LEVEL 2: Go west to the intersection at (35,51). Go north to the
intersection at (29,46). Go north. There is useful loot on this
level, too.
</P>

<P>
LEVEL 3: Go north to the intersection at (50,39). Go east to the
intersection at (69,37). Go east. This is the last level where
useful loot can be found. What you find below this level is mainly
gems. Gems are useful for the Well and for buying things from the
Magic Shop, but there are no more useful weapons and armor.
Encounters with Umbers in the mines at all levels will yield
weapons, scrolls, and armor.
</P>

<P>
LEVEL 4: Go south to the intersection at (54,58). Go west to the
intersection at (54,66). Go east.
</P>

<P>
LEVEL 5: Go north to the intersection at (45,44). Go west to the
intersection at (23,38). Go north.
</P>

<P>
LEVEL 6: Go west and continue going west at every intersection.
You will encounter giant snakes on this level; have Neutralize
Poison spells ready,and make sure the cleric who has that spell is
in the rear. (NOTE: It's a good idea to have a Neutralize Poison
spell ready at all times in this game!)
</P>

<P>
You will find Vala on this level. She is a worthwhile addition to
your party. There are several situations where you will find
monsters immune to magic. In those cases, what you need is lots of
fighters: Vala is a good fighter.
</P>

<P>
LEVEL 7: Go south and continue going south until you reach the
intersection at (56,71). The staff is to the west. There is loot
to the east, and you might want to pick it up on the way back since
it's fairly close.
</P>

<P>
LEVEL 8: Go south to the intersection at (50,62). Go west then, go
south, and keep doing so. The malfunctioning teleporter on this
level is initially the only way to the 9th level. To get to it, go
north to the intersection at (52,45). Go west to the intersection
at (43,43). Go west.
</P>

<P>
LEVEL 9: The teleporter on level 8 should place you in a room at
(58,30). (It did the two times I played the game, but the Well
hints the teleporter is random.) If you are teleported to another
room, you're on your own. If you do wind up at (58,30), it's a
straight shot to the mine shaft at (50,50).
</P>

<P>
You will find guards just before the mine shaft. Kill them and you
destroy the barrier. This enables you to use the mine shaft all the
way down to Level 10, or "B" (for basement?) as it is given in the
menu. There are guard stations in all directions from the mine
shaft if you want to take them out. All but the ones in the south
are close to the mine shaft, and it's real easy to run into them.
The southern guards are found by going south, west, then south again
until you find them.
</P>

<P>
LEVEL 10: This is the entrance to the castle dungeons. Go east and
continue going east until you reach the intersection at (80,50).
Then go south.
</P>

<H3>CASTLE DUNGEONS</H3>

<P>
There are three mazes in the castle dungeons. There is also a Black Circle
compound attached to the dungeon. Each dungeon maze has several
levels. To get to the next level you will have to either answer a
riddle, or fight the guards. You get experience points in either
case, and answering the riddle is much easier than fighting. If you
fail to answer the riddle, you are automatically teleported to the
Well, who will give you the answer for 100 gems. Once you get the
answer, you automatically answer the riddle the second time you
approach the stairs.
</P>

<P>
Any sphinxes found in the dungeon will give useful information if
you talk to them or rescue them.
</P>

<P>
DUNGEON MAZE 1: The important locations are: (3,6) a gate back to
the Well; (8,11) another gate back to the Well; (11,0) stairs;
(12,0) stairs (this one leads to the next dungeon maze); (15,7) if
you go east from the stairwell, you will enter the Black Circle
compound; (12,15) brass key (needed to complete the game).
</P>

<H3>BLACK CIRCLE COMPOUND</H3>

<P>
This mission is totally optional. You will meet Sir Deric as you
enter the compound. He has just escaped from the Black Circle and
is looking for his companions. Your mission (if you should accept
it) is to help him rescue his companions. Sir Deric has only a
mundane sword and is badly wounded. You will need a spare set of
weapons and armor for him. Basically, almost every room in this
maze contains battles. You do not have to fight them all if you do
not wish to.
</P>

<P>
Important locations are: (11,8) and (11,9) you can rest here;
(14,14) the first of Sir Deric's companions is found here (he will
give you an amulet that will enable you to find the other
companion); (7,8) once you have the amulet, go back to this location
(the amulet will show you the locations of various secret doors; the
rooms in the section behind the secret doors have lots of good loot;
there also several places to rest; the game will tell where you can
rest); (2,8) the entrance to where Sir Deric's other companion is
being held (Sir Deric leaves your party once this companion is
rescued); (1,4) another secret room to loot (there is a subtle game
hint that this room exists when Sir Deric leaves your party).
</P>

<P>
DUNGEON MAZE 2: The important locations are: (3,9) stairs; (8,15)
stairs; (7,10) stairs; (13,9) stairs to next dungeon maze; (6,3)
gate back to Well (if you cleared the compound, you will probably
want to return to town at this point to dispose of all your loot);
(1,8) silver key (needed to complete the game).
</P>

<P>
DUNGEON MAZE 3: The important locations are: (10,6) a prisoner you
can rescue (he will give the location of his treasure cache); (12,6)
the prisoner's cache (the password is NACACIA); (12,7) a teleporter
to (1,3) (there's lots of loot and a big fight at (1,3); there is
also a teleporter back to the Well at (1,3)); (12,13) blocked stairs
to the castle proper (this stair will open once you reach the
castle; you will have to use the roundabout way through the
crevasses first to get into the castle); (2,15) exit to the
crevasses; (9,13) gold key (needed to complete the game).
</P>

<H3>CREVASSES</H3>

<P>
The ice crevasses are huge but simple. This is also another maze
where the map coordinates can be wrong if you leave the maze and
come back. The required mission is to find the Frost Giants'
village. The optional mission is to rescue the Phlan clerk one last
time.
</P>

<P>
From the dungeon's exit, go east to the intersection at (44,82).
Going north gets you loot, but it is a side trip. Continue east.
At intersection (51,82) continue east. If you go east at (61,62),
you encounter the Phlan clerk. If you go south, you will find the
Frost Giants' village.
</P>

<P>
If you rescue the clerk, she will suggest you join her to find some
treasure. Agree to this and follow her directions. This will
eventually take you back to the Well. Afterward, you can backtrack
to (61,62). On the way back, the only intersection of any interest
is (14,48). Going east will yield loot.
</P>

<P>
Assuming you do not want to rescue the clerk, go south. At (99,79) go east.
There is a two-part battle to be fought there before you can
proceed. You will eventually find the entrance to the Frost Giants'
village. There is a gate back to the Well at the entrance.
</P>

<H3>FROST GIANTS' VILLAGE</H3>

<P>
The village uses the same map coordinates as the crevasses but is
really a separate 16x16 maze. Your one and only mission is to
locate the Frost Giant King and talk with him. Wandering around
will only result in lots and lots of tough fights and very little
loot. The big loot comes only from talking to the king.
</P>

<P>
Go due east from the entrance until you reach (58,87). Go south to
(58,95). Go west. Talk to the king. There will be a test of your
truthfulness by way of a two-part battle with the Black Circle and
fire giants. The result is a lot of loot from the king as a reward.
</P>

<P>
Once you win the king's trust, you must leave the village. You can
leave the village at the crevasse or castle exit. The crevasse exit
might be a good choice as you have a lot of loot that has to be
disposed of. You can return later and will be automatically passed
through the village.
</P>

<P>
From the castle exit of the village, go east to the intersection at
(26,86). This may also be shown as (58,85). Go south. From here
on, always go east. You will eventually reach the castle gates. If
you chose to go east from (26,86), you will eventually reach a gate
back to the Well.
</P>

<H3>CASTLE: FINAL BATTLE</H3>

<P>
The are three mazes which correspond to the three levels of the
castle.
</P>

<P>
CASTLE LEVEL 1: The rooms generally contain nothing but big
battles. There is a gate back to the Well at (6,9). There is a
teleporter at (9,15) that takes you to stairs leading to the second
level. All rooms are entered by waiting in the alcoves. There is a
secret rotating door in each alcove. Once on the other side of the
alcove, you cannot exit until you find the lever that reverses the
rotating door.
</P>

<P>
CASTLE LEVEL 2: For the most part, this level contains nothing but
battles as well. You can rest in the secret room at (5,2). The
storm giants at (6,1) will parlay and leave peacefully if you buy
their map. The room at (2,2) contains loot, but you need the amulet
in the room at (14,8) to get in. Around (9,4) you will run into a
patrol. The loot from this battle includes the current password
(STEELEYE). Also, no matter what you read, the password is always
STEELEYE. If you explore the southeast section of this level, you
will meet Sargatha again. If you wait, you will be attacked. If
you chase her, you will be captured and will have to fight your way
out of the dungeons again. Chasing is not advised.
</P>

<P>
The entrance to a maze that leads to the stairs to the third level
is at (4,4). The stairs are at (0,15) and behind a hidden entrance.
The corridor that starts at (9,15) does not lead to the hidden
entrance.
</P>

<P>
CASTLE LEVEL 3: This is the level where the three keys you found in
the dungeon are used. The Well will tell you in which order the
keys have to be used. Interesting locations are:
</P>

<P>
(12,11) Gate back to the Well.<BR>
(14,12) Gate to (12,15). Lots of loot and a big fight.<BR>
(13,9) Bash your way through this door.<BR>
(14,7) Go on in; it's not that hard a fight.<BR>
(11,2) You do not want to go in this door.<BR>
(8,9) The password is OSWULF.<BR>
(7,1) Golden boy has a girdle of giant strength, plate mail +5,
shield +5, and long sword +5. They should be the last items in the
loot list, but doublecheck by readying the items to see what they do
to your characters' statistics.<BR>
(3,4) Entrance to the Dreadlord's room.<BR>
(1,3) Secret entrance to the Dreadlord's hiding place. This is the
last battle. Have lots of lightning spells or wands of lightning
ready for this battle. The room is filled with golems. There is
also a gate back to the Well here. You might want to teleport to
the Temple of Tyr and discover Derf Strongarm's fate before
returning to town. There is a bug in the program that reincarnates
Derf after your visit.
</P>
