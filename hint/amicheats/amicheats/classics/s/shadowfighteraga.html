<H2>WARRIORS</H2>

<H3>SLAMDUNK</H3>

<P>
At over six foot ten, this Danish giant is one of the biggest,
meanest characters gracing the Shadow Fiighter circuit. Utilising
his height, he combines his mastery of Basketball with a vast
knowledge of all the martial arts, the result of which is one lethal
mother of an opponent.
</P>

<H3>SORIA</H3>

<P>
Hailing from the streets of Belgium. Soria, or the 'muscles from
brussels', is the world kick boxing champ. This ain't enough to
satisfy his huge ego though and he desperately wants to be hailed as
the greatest fighter on Earth. This ambition has led him to the
Shadow Fighter tournament, where he plans to earn eternal fame and
fortune.
</P>

<P>

<H3>ELECTRA</H3>

<P>
Don't be fooled! She might be a lass, but she's as tough as they
come, if not tougher! Her huge array of special moves (more than
any other fighter) make her one of the most lethal fighters around.
Life on the Paris streets has also taught her how to fight her way
out of the tightest corners and even when she looks down and out she
can pull out some extraordinary combos.
</P>

</P>

<H3>YURGEN</H3>

<P>
Unlike the majority of fighters at the tournarment, fame and fortune
are not listed as one of Yurgens driving forces. As a cop he's here
solely on business. A murder suspect is roaming large amongst the
fighters and it's up to him to find out who and bring them to
justice. For a cop, Yurgen seems to play extremely dirty. Not only
does he carry a truncheon into battle, he can whip out his gun and
shoot his opponents. This makes him a dangerous foe and one not to
be taken lightly.
</P>

<P>
Gun Fire -------- Down, Down/Back, Back + Fire<BR>
Power Fist ------ Down, Down/Forward, Forward + Fire<BR>
Earthquake Fist - Forward, Down/Forward, Down + Fire
</P>

<H3>CODY</H3>

<P>
As a baby, Cody was taught by his father to live, breath and crap
Kuto. Since then he has gone on to surpass him as the Grand Master
and has taken the martial arts to new heights. By perfecting many
special moves that were once believed impossible. Cody, is one of
the most complete fighters to grace the tournament.
</P>

<P>
Kuto Kick -------- Forward, Down/Forward, Down + Fire<BR>
Fast Punch ------- Rapid Fire<BR>
Flying Powerball - Back, Forward + Fire<BR>
Kuto Fireball ---- Down, Down/Back, Back + Fire
</P>

<H3>SALVADOR</H3>

<P>
Learning and playing his trade on the dark back streets of Madrid,
Salvador quickly established himself as the worlds greatest bare
knuckle fighter. His formidable strength together with an
understanding of the animal psyche (which allows him to harness the
power of his lookalike, the Panther) give him an unrivalled
combination of power, agility and speed.
</P>

<P>
Spinning Powerball - Down, Down/Forward, Forward + Fire<BR>
Turning Flip ------- Down, Up + Fire<BR>
Flash Panther ------ Back, Forward + Fire
</P>

<H3>FAKIR</H3>

<P>
By exploring his inner mind, Fakir has formed a truly awesome
partnership between body and soul. As a result Fakir is probably
the most focused and determined fighter. This makes him one of the
toughest fighters out there. His inner exploration has also
unlocked the secrets to ancient magical skills that allow him to
perform some devastating special moves.
</P>

<P>
Genie Hurricane - Down, Down/Back, Back + Fire<BR>
Mystery Fire ---- Down, Down/Forward, Forward + Fire<BR>
Teleport -------- Down/Forward, Down, Down/Back, Back + Fire<BR>
Magic Carpet ---- Forward, Down/Forward, Down + Fire
</P>

<H3>KURY</H3>

<P>
Kury is something of a enigma, preferring to keep his chequered
history and private life to himself. This has caused some heated
words amongst the fighters, but the sheer size of him and the
destructive power built into those arms and legs are deterrent
enough for any would-be pryers.
</P>

<P>
Power Smash Fist --- Down, Down/Back, Back + Fire<BR>
Body Drop ---------- Down, Down/Forward, Forward + Fire<BR>
Rock Roll ---------- Back, Forward + Fire<BR>
