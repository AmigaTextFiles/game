<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
It is the year 2017. Ruthless KGB fanatics have just staged a coup
d'etat inside the Soviet Union. As Sloan McCormick, young general
assigned to implement the S.D.I. project, only you can save the
United States from thermonuclear destruction. Will you succeed in
rescuing Natalya, the beautiful Soviet commander, from a dreaded KGB
torture squad? and will Sloan, single-handedly, destroy a crack
Soviet rocket fighter squadron? Pick up a joystick and find out in
S.D.I.!
</P>

<H2>CHEATS</H2>

<P>
When your in the russian space station, pick one man and keep firing
at him 10 or 15 times. No other men will appear and you can keep
doing it until you get the girl.
