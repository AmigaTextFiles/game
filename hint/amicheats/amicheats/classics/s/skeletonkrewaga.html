<P>
On the Character-Choice screen comes up type
"I WOULD RATHER BE WATCHING THE FOREST ". Then select END. Now
you can pick levels. When you press Enter you will get 9 lives.
</P>

<P>
On the title screen, type in "I WOULD RATHER BE WATCHING FOREST" and
press 'Space'. The bottom part of the screen will now change to
'CHEAT MODE ACTIVE ALL'. Now highlighting Options with the joystick
and moving it left and right means you will be able to select and
jump straight to any of the various levels within the game. Also
during play, pressing 'F1' to 'F4' will change the control method.
The full stop key will skip the current level and pressing 'Enter'
on the keypad will give you nine lives.
</P>

<P>
Try typing in "BLOOD AND GORE" and again hit 'Space'. The bottom
part of the screen will now read "CHEAT MODE ACTIVE ??3". What
effects this exactly has on the game I'm not too sure.
</P>

<H2>FUN</H2>

<P>
For fun, on the title screen type in 'LOTTERY'. The computer will
now randomly generate some lottery numbers.
