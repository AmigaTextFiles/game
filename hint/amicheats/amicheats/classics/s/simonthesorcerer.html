<H2>SOLVE</H2>

<P>
This solve is intended for someone who's stuck at some point in
the game, not for someone who just wants to play it all through with
no effort. If you haven't been exploring the game on your own you'll
have no idea where the places are that I'm telling you to go to.
</P>

<P>
First, go to the troll bridge. The troll won't let you by because
he's on strike. In one of the forest scenes there's a barbarian with
a thorn stuck in his foot. Find him, talk to him, and Simon will
pull the thorn out. The barbarian will give you a whistle for you to
blow when you need him. Go back to the bridge and talk to the troll.
He'll take the whistle from you and blow it. The barbarian will
appear and beat the troll up. The bridge is now open.
</P>

<P>
Beyond the bridge is an oaf. Talk to him. He needs water for his
magic beans. Go to the witch's cottage. There is a handle on the
well. Use it an the bucket will rise to the top. Get the bucket and
go back to the oaf. You'll pour the water on the beans and leave the
screen. Turn around and go back. The oaf is gone but some of the
beans are still there. Get them and go to the back of Calypso's
cottage. Use the beans with the compost. A watermelon will grow.
</P>

<P>
Get the watermelon and go to the screen with the bard. Use the
watermelon with the sousaphone. It will jam and you'll talk the bard
into giving it to you. Go to the sleeping giant and use the
sousaphone. The way to the upper mountains is now open.
</P>

<P>
Go to the tower. The bell won't ring because it has no clapper. Go
to the forge. The clapper is on the table. Get it, return to the
tower, and use it with the bell. Now use the bell and hair will drop
down from the top of the tower. Use the hair to climb up into the
tower. You'll end up with a pig called Repulser.
</P>

<P>
Take Repulser to the "candy house" (the house with the beehive
next to it) and use her on the door. Now you can get inside. Get the
smokebox and hat. Go to the pub. There's a box of matches on top of
the fruit machine. Get it and return to the candy house. Use the
smokebox on the beehive.
</P>

<P>
There's some wax on the beehive. Pick it up. Go back to the pub.
Talk to the barkeep and ask him to mix you a drink. While he's
making the drink, use the wax on the beer barrel behind him. Wait
around. He'll throw out the beer barrel and give you a voucher.
Leave the pub and pick up the barrel.
</P>

<P>
Go to Calypso's cottage. Open the drawer. Take the scissors that
are inside and return to the pub. Use the scissors on the dwarf. You
now have a beard. Go to the screen that the dwarf mine is on and
wear the beard. There is a rock lying on the ground next to the
mine. Pick it up and look at it. Enter the mine. When you're asked
for the password, you can say "beer" immediately because you looked
at the rock.
</P>

<P>
Inside the dwarf mine, try to go left. You'll be stopped by the
guard. Give him the beer barrel as a bribe. He'll go to drink it and
leave the path to the mining operation open. Unfortunately, the door
leading from the mining operation to the treasure room is locked.
</P>

<P>
Go to the Wise Owl's tree. Notice that the Owl drops a feather
when he first talks to you. Get the feather and return to the dwarf
mine. Go to the right. Use the feather on the dwarf who's sleeping
on the ground. He'll roll aside, revealing a key. Get the key and
use it to open the treasure room door. Give the treasure room dwarf
the beer voucher. He'll reward you with a gem.
</P>

<P>
Go to the dodgy geezer and talk to him. Offer him the gem. He'll
buy it for 20 gold pieces.
</P>

<P>
Go to the dragon's cave. The dragon has a cold. Go to the druid's
house (it's the house with the wagon wheel in front of it). There is
a cold remedy on the stump to the right of the stairs. Get it and go
back to the dragon. Use the remedy on the dragon and it will put him
to sleep.
</P>

<P>
Go to the mining operation in the dwarf cave. There is a hook with
a rope attached to it hanging next to the door to the treasure room.
Get it. Go to the forge. There is a rope lying on the ground to the
left of the barrel. Pick it up. Go inside Calypso's cottage. Pick up
the magnet that's on the fridge.
</P>

<P>
Return to the dragon's cave. Use the hook on the boulder hanging
above the entrance. This will let you climb above the cave. Use the
rope with the magnet. Then use the rope and magnet with the hole.
Keep doing this until the hoard runs dry.
</P>

<P>
Go to the woodman and talk to him. He needs an axe made of milrith
to cut through the enchanted trees in the area. He'll give you a
milrith detector. Go to the screen in the mountains with the small
statue and use the milrith detector.
</P>

<P>
The screen above the dragon's cave has a rock lying on the ground.
Pick it up. It has a fossil inside. Take it to Von Jones's dig and
give it to the hole. Von Jones will tell you to get the fossil out.
Go to the forge and use the rock with the anvil. The blacksmith will
break the rock open and reveal the fossil. Go back to Von Jones's
dig and give the fossil to the hole. Tell Von Jones that you marked
where you found it with your metal detector.
</P>

<P>
Go to the screen that you left your metal detector on. Look at the
dirt around Von Jones's hole and you'll see milrith ore. Pick it up
and go back to the woodcutter. He'll tell you that he needs it made
into an axe head. Go to the forge and use the milrith ore with the
anvil. The blacksmith will pound it into an axe head. Take the axe
head back to the woodcutter. He'll go out to chop down trees,
leaving the door of his house open.
</P>

<P>
Go to the dragon's cave. There's a fire extinguisher inside. Get
it and return to the woodcutter's house. Go inside and use the fire
extinguisher on the fireplace. Now move the hook that's in the
fireplace and you'll be transported down to a secret room. There is
mahogany on a shelf to the left. Pick it up and take it to the
woodworms' stump. Tell them you have it and they'll jump into your hat.
</P>

<P>
Go to the room at the top of the tower. Use the woodworm on the
floorboards. This will let you get to the ground floor of the tower.
There's a wedge holding the door shut. Pick it up and open the door.
</P>

<P>
Go to the druid's house. There's a ladder leaning against the wall
outside. Pick it up, take it back to the tower, and use it with the
hole in the floor. Go down the ladder and open up the tomb. You'll
be scared away, but come back and open it up again. There is a loose
bandage on the mummy. Try to take it and the mummy will fall apart.
Pick up the staff it drops.
</P>

<P>
Go to the back room of the pub. Give the staff to the wizards.
Then give gold coins to them to pay the membership fee. You're now
an official wizard.
</P>

<P>
Go to the druid's house. There is a specimin jar on the left side
of the upper level. Take it. Go to the Swampling's house. Use the
stew with the specimin jar. The Swampling will then tell you he's
run out of stew and go to get the ingredients for more.
</P>

<P>
Go to the screen containing the bridge over the gorge. In the
lower left hand corner of the screen are some vines. Go to them and
you'll climb down into the gorge automatically. Talk to Gollum. He
tells you that he's fishing for food. Tell him that you have genuine
swamp stew for him. He'll give you the fishing pole in return.
You'll automatically use it to fish the One Ring out of the river.
</P>

<P>
Go to the goblins' fortress. There is a paper under a rock below
and to the right of the door. Get the paper and take it to the
storekeeper. Go to the front of the store, leave the screen, and
then come back again. There should be a box there now. Open the box
and you'll be taken to the goblins' fortress.
</P>

<P>
Open the box to get out of it. Pick up the rat bone that's lying
on the floor. Look at the boxes and you'll see your spell box. Pick
it up and look at it. You'll find a piece of paper inside. Use the
paper on the door, then use the rat bone on the lock. Pick the paper
up again and you'll have the key. Use the key on the lock and open
the door. Go to the right. You're in the main cell block. Get the
bucket and go down.
</P>

<P>
Talk to the druid. He thinks you're a demon because he can't see
you. Remove the ring and talk to him again. He tells you that he
turns into a frog when he sees a full moon. Use the bucket on the
druid. Now pick up the flaming brand that's in the brazier and use
it on the druid. He'll turn into a frog. The commotion has attracted
the attention of the goblins so hide by opening the iron maiden and
walking into it.
</P>

<P>
Days later, the frog will return. Open the iron maiden, then walk
over to the frog and take the hacksaw that's in his mouth. Use the
hacksaw on the bars and you'll be free.
</P>

<P>
There is a gnarled old tree high up in the mountains. Talk to it.
It wants you to remove the pink splodge on it. Go to the shop. There
is a bottle of white spirit to the left of the storekeeper's heads.
Buy it, take it back to the tree and use it on the splodge. Talk to
the tree again and you'll be told four magic words.
</P>

<P>
Go to the witch's cottage. She first appears when you try to pick
up the broom. If you already tried to pick it up she'll appear the
moment you walk in the door. You must now fight a wizard's duel.
This is actually rock-scissors-paper played with transformations.
Keep going back into the cottage and playing until you win. You'll
get the broom, but the witch will cheat and turn into a dragon. Use
the magic word that turns you into a mouse to escape.
</P>

<P>
Go to the druid's house and talk to him. He tells you that he has
a potion for you, but needs a herb called frogsbane to help him with
his lycanthropy. Go to the Swampling's house. There is a chest on
the floor below the chair. Move it and then open the trapdoor that
is revealed. Go down the ladder. You can't go to the right because
there's a loose plank. Go to the shop and buy a hammer (it's hanging
on the wall to the left of the shopkeeper's heads). Return to the
Swampling's house, go down, and use the hammer on the plank. Now you
can go to the right and get to Skull Island. On top of the skull is
the frogsbane. Get it and go back to the druid's house. The druid
will give you the potion.
</P>

<P>
Go to the row of climbing pins in the mountains. Unfortunately,
there's one missing. Go to the woodcutter's house. There is a pin on
the table inside the house. Get it and return to the row of pins.
Use your climbing pin on the hole and you'll be able to climb across
the mountain.
</P>

<P>
The snowman on the other end won't let you pass. Go back to the
torture room in the goblins' fortress. On the floor between the
doors and bars is a roll of mints. Get them and return to the
snowman. Consume the mints and the snowman will be melted.
</P>

<P>
Beyond the snowman is Sordid's tower. The bridge will collapse as
you get close to the door. Use the broom and it will take you across
the gap to the door. Consume the druid's potion. You'll shrink and
automatically walk through a crack in the door.
</P>

<P>
Chippy will take you to Sordid's garden. Pick up the maple leaf
lying on the ground. Walk to the bucket and you'll automatically
pick up a matchstick. There is a stone lying on the ground near the
left edge of the screen. Pick it up and go to the left.
</P>

<P>
Try to pick up the lily leaf and you'll pull it to the shore. Use
the matchstick with the lily leaf. Use the maple left with the
matchstick. This boat can't get you to the other end of the puddle,
though, because the water isn't deep enough. Use the hair you got
from Chippy on the tap. Unfortunately, it's caked with rust. Get the
seeds that are near the left edge of the screen (you'll take the
boat over there automatically). Use the stone on the seeds and
they'll be pulped into oil. Use the oil on the tap. Now move the
hair and some water will flow out of the tap. Now you can sail your
boat all the way across the puddle.
</P>

<P>
On the other side of the puddle is a frog that will try to eat you
if you get too close. Look at the water just below the fisherman's
feet. There is a tadpole swimming in it. Pick it up. Talk to the
frog and threaten to hurt the tadpole. The frog will leave. Now you
can pick up and consume the mushrooms that the frog was sitting on.
You'll be returned to your regular size.
</P>

<P>
Open the door and walk into the tower's entry level. The chest
there is actually a monster, and you'll be forced to retreat from
it. The tree in the garden has a branch you can take. Do so, go back
into the tower, and use the branch on the chest. It will be rendered
harmless.
</P>

<P>
Go to the laboratory at the top of the tower. The teleporter there
could get you out of the tower, but the demons won't tell you how to
work it unless you can send them back to the pit. Sordid's spell
book is in the bookcase with the monster skull on it. Get it and
look at it. You find that in order to send the demons home you must
have eight candles, a mouse, a human skull, and know the true names
of the demons.
</P>

<P>
The demons won't just tell you their true names - you're going to
have to be sneaky. Go to Sordid's bedroom. If you look at the mirror
there, it will tell you that it can see out of any reflective
surface anywhere in the world. There is a shield in the entry level.
Get it and take it to the laboratory. The center table has a hook on
it. Use the shield with the hook. The shield is pretty tarnished,
though. There are some chemicals on the table. Pick them up and use
them on the shield. Now it will shine brightly. Go to the bedroom,
talk to the mirror, and ask to see the demons. You'll learn their
true names.
</P>

<P>
Pick up the pouch and the sock. Use the pouch with the sock. Now
use the pouch with the hole at the base of the stairs. You've just
caught a mouse.
</P>

<P>
Go to the entry level. There is a spear hanging in a rack of
weapons. Pick it up. Go to the torture room. There is a human skull
hanging from the top of the screen. Use the spear on the skull and
it will fall to the floor. Pick the skull up.
</P>

<P>
Pick up the chest. Move the lever. This will raise a stone block
and expose the top of another block. Use the chest with the exposed
block. Move the lever to drop the block and crush the chest. Move it
again to raise the block. Pick up the candles that were in the
chest.
</P>

<P>
Go to the laboratory, talk to the demons, and tell them that
everything's ready. They'll tell you how to operate the teleporter
and you'll send them back to the pit.
</P>

<P>
Go to the bedroom. Get the magic wand that's lying on the table
below the mirror. Pick up the book lying on the bed and look at it.
It will tell you that a wand can only be destroyed by being dropped
into the Fiery Pits of Rondor. Go back up to the laboratory, enter
the teleporter, and say that you want to go to the Fiery Pits of
Rondor.
</P>

<P>
The attendant at the pits won't let you past because you don't
have enough money to buy a ticket. He'll give you some free
brochures, though. Look at the brochures and you'll find an elastic
band. On the floor near the fire bell is a sapling and a pebble.
Pick them both up. Use the sapling with the elastic band to create a
crude catapult. Use the catapult with the fire bell and you'll set
it off. The attendant will run away, leaving the way clear for you
to enter the pits.
</P>

<P>
Go two screens to the right and you'll see Sordid. The fire
system put out the fire in the pit and he's trying to relight it.
Use the wand on him and he'll be turned to stone.
</P>

<P>
The wand must be destroyed in order to free Calypso and the other
heroes from its curse. Go back to the souvenir booth. There is a box
of souvenir matches on the right side of the counter. Pick them up
and return to the pit. Use the matches with the pit and the fire
will be relit. Use the wand with the lava and it will be destroyed.
</P>

<P>
One small problem...Sordid has come back to life as well! He'll
try to kill you by wrecking the bridge and teleporting you to the
empty space where it used to be. You're a little hardier than he
expected, though. There's a bucket of floor wax on your side of the
screen. Pick it up and go back to the right. Once he starts casting
his spell you'll have a few seconds to use the floor wax on him.
Sordid will fall into the lava and be killed. You are a winner!
