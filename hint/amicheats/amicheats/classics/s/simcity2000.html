<H2>CHEATS</H2>

<P>
Start a new game, any year on Hard level, type "FUND" until your
cash is at $60,000 (reply yes to all queries). Now go to the
budget menu and select bond repayments. Then click on repay bond
and answer yes to repay bond at 3%. You will now get $50,000 every
year.
</P>

<P>
When you start a NEW game, before doing anything else, use the fund
above cheat TWICE, then take out a regular bond (through the budget
menu). I've had interest rates of -15000% with this cheat, so you'll
get a few million each year.
</P>

<P>
When you have started a new city (in easy mode) take a loan. Go to
the map and type "Found". Then go back and make another loan, and
now you earn 1.5 million a year.

For a large amount of cash follow these steps:
