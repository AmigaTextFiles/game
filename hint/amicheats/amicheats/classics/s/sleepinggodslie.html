<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
A dying priest of the Kobbold Old Way bequeaths a sacred quest: to
find and wake N'Gnir, an Old God rumored to slumber in one of the
farthest flung of Tessera's eight kingdoms. Battle your way through
94 landscapes, fending off demons and bandits, befriending princes
and hermits, winning knowledge and strength as you travel. Arm
yourself with slings and crossbows, protect yourself with camouflage
and dragonskin, and find the Ring of Annihilation.
</P>

<H2>SOLVE</H2>

<P>
During this adventure, you will start with bare hands as weapons but
gradually gain more powerful weapons and better ammo. You must also
search for food (berries on bushes, apple trees, carrots, mushrooms,
swedes, etc growing in small patches on the ground).
</P>

<H3>CAILA AND TAIRA</H3>

<P>
You start in your home. Get the empty bowl, shuriken and 20
pebbles. Leave through the unlocked door (N Caila). Find the
hermit there. He asks you to find his map. Travel to W Marches and
get the back door key from the molehill and the pouch of renewal
from near the two trees (the trees are thirsty). Go to S Caila.
Avoid the mouse. Fill the bowl at the lake and go through the tree
gate. Go to E Taira. Kill the bandit outside the bandit's refuge.
Get the map. Inside, get the bread (food), mouldy cheese and tunic.
You can now pass the mouse as you have the cheese. Kill the hydra
(use sling and lead shot) and get the circlet. Go back to the
hermit. Follow his instructions. Go back to Taira and through the
rock gate that has appeared. Go to the tree to be transported to...
</P>

Meet Prince Gregor who has lost his crown. In Northern Sylvar, get
a useful hint from the molehill. Head towards one of the dwarves'
houses and kill the dwarf here. Get the lantern. Enter the
tunnels. Enter the eastern room with the baby spider and get the
rope. Go to the western room, kill the dwarf king and get his
crown. You will need the rope to leave the tunnels. Leave through
the NE entrance and find Gregor again. He gives you gold for his
crown. Go back into the tunnels, leave through the SW exit. Get
the belt of lung capacity from the molehill. Travel to the clearing
with the fountain. It transports you to one of the islands of
Delanda.
</P>

<H3>DELANDA</H3>

<P>
Shoot the seagulls to get gold coins. Go south by ferry to the
larger island. Kill a druid to get a gold sickle. Read the message
by the stones, and find the dying man to get a clue. Cut mistletoe
from the tree in the middle and you can pass between the stones. In
the land beyond the stones, kill enough peasants to get a short bow
and a fair number of arrows. Collect the armband of strength from
the molehill. Take the ferry south to the sandy island and meet
Princess Eloise to get her message and a bracelet. Collect the
lightfoot sandals from the centre of the island. These allow you to
walk on water on some occasions. Walk east across the water to the
island of the well. Hear the message from the well and get the
vial. Return to the dying druid and collect his soul. Go back to
the well and you'll pass into it. You find yourself in blackness.
Turn till you spot something - some greaves. Get them and leave
east to.....
</P>

<H3>SIMALA</H3>

<P>
To find warm clothing, head NE and you'll get warm boots from a
molehill. Leave north through an icy mountain pass to the lowest
plain. Leave east again, through another pass, to another icy
plain. To the east is a bandit's hideout. Kill the bandit to gain
a travelling cloak. Note the cave is sheltered from the wind. Go
back out and north (kill the snake) to the highest, most icy plain.
Get a useful message from the three Weird Sisters. Get the wood
they leave. Return south to the lowest plain and go west to another
cave. Kill the bandit and get his gloves. Meet the hermit inside
the cave to obtain a tinderbox and some advice. Go back to the
other cave where you light a fire, your head spins and you drift
to....
</P>

<H3>MORAV</H3>

<P>
Listen to advice from the three characters sitting by a fire and
also from a nearby molehill. Enter the temple to the south and kill
the sorcerer inside to gain a red robe. Go into the castle. Enter
the room of paintings and examine them to get a clue from one. Go
to the music room. Kill the guards in there, get the chain mail and
trumpet. Visit the dining room and collect the mug, plate and
quiver of renewal. Go to the door of the throne room and you'll
blow the trumpet to unlock the door. Inside, kill the guards and go
close to the throne to see a vision and be transported to.....
</P>

<H3>SUNDERABAD</H3>

<P>
The heat is bothering you so go west to the cave, kill the snake
outside and get the shades inside. Back outside, meet Princess
Lucia, Eloise's sister, to get some advice and a necklace. Look
inside the northwest pyramid to find a breastplate. Some of the
priests, when killed, drop a dagger. Use it to cut certain cacti
whose liquid restores some of your strength. Others drop a rod of
flame. Find the scarab in the northern rockier area, get her advice
and do what she says - go to the oasis in the southern sandy zone
and to the Pyramid but don't worry if you take longer than half an
hour! Follow the scarab inside and learn about the Maze of Light.
Go through the red door, in the next room through the red door to
the east, the same in the next room and you will find a yellow door
to your north. Go through the yellow door (an alarm goes off), meet
the archmage and get the box when he vanishes to be transported
to.....
</P>

<H3>ESTAMANE</H3>

<P>
Kill the sorcerer who attacks you and get the fireball wand. Get
the candle from the room of candles. In the room where the headless
woman attacks, kill her - she thanks you and leaves an amulet. Go
to the room with the Emperor (E, N, N) - you won't see him unless
you have the candle - and get his message. Go to the fountain room
and kill the sorcerer to get a lightning staff. Find Lucia and she
follows you when you return to the Emperor. You'll get a bottle,
helmet and some useful advice when Lucia meets her father. Go back
to the fountain and, as it instructs you, go to the Chamber of Lost
Souls. When the fountain tells you to follow the peasants, do so.
Meet the three witches again and get their message to find the
archmage down the east corridor. When you meet the archmage again
down there, attack him with the lightning staff. He vanishes. Get
the scroll. It is covered in runes which you can't decipher. The
room spins and you are in......
</P>

<H3>THE CORATINIAN STATE</H3>

<P>
Leave the cave and kill the dragon outside. Get the dragonskin and
the contents of its lair (coins, pellets, dragon spear) Go outside.
Go near the peasants and heed their advice - do not pass into the
central area yet. Go to the western marshes, meet the hermit and
hear his message. Follow him to the molehill in the west and enter
the mound that opens. Get the armour and shield and learn what you
have to do. Get the ring from the centre of the plains of ash,
return to the hermit to get cured. Follow him to the southern
marshes to another molehill and listen to what he says. Through the
boulder gateway you meet the witches again and they tell you what to
do and give you the history of the ring. Get the ring of total
annihilation that they leave and find the archmage in the northern
marshes. Attack him with the ring, he screams and vanishes. Return
to the chamber where you started to find him again. Use the ring,
he screams and disappears and a hole opens in the wall. Go through
and down the corridor to the door. Destroy the guardian. The
archmage reappears behind you. Use the ring on him again and he
vanishes. Enter the room, it's empty and the door shuts behind you.
You feel the room descend. The door opens. Go through into the
next room which is also empty. The device given to you by the
kobold starts to vibrate and glow softly. You hear a hum as the
other room returns. The archmage enters through the door but seems
frozen to the spot. The device burns your hand and you drop it.
Something happens to the archmage. His voice is changed. It's
N'Gnir returned to restore the land while you take a well-earned
rest!! Game complete!
