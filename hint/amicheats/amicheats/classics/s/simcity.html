<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
The city simulator strategy game. Year 3010: you become mayor and
planner of your city. Fully animated with graphics and sound.
Features include cars, boats, helicopters, and monsters. Includes 8
cities on the verge of disaster: San Francisco before the earth
quake, Tokyo before the monster attack, Boston before the nuclear
meltdown.
</P>

<H2>CHEATS</H2>

<P>
At any time, hold down the 'SHIFT' key and type "FUND". This gives
you an extra $10,000. It also causes an earthquake every
tenth time you do it, so do it before you start your city. In some
versions this only works when on the title screen and not during
the game.
</P>

<P>
Another cheat is to set the citizen's taxes to 0%. Then just before
tax collection (December or November if playing at fast speed)
quickly set the taxes up to 20%. Then after you collect taxes, put
it back down to 0%. This way the citizens think they are not
paying any taxes.
</P>

<P>
You can build land on water. Find a straight (horizontal or
vertical), stretch of coastline and string a powerline along it.
Next, move one square over, out into the water and string another
powerline parallel to the first. Repeat as many times as you want.
Then just bulldoze all the excess powerlines and you can build on
the new land. To make land you simply make a 3 lane highway across
any water source. When you make a road by putting 3 sections of
road on top of three section of road on top of three sections of
road (3 by 3) you make 1 section of land in the middle.
</P>

<P>
Here's a cheat for owners of Sim City Deluxe only. Load up Sim
Editor and then load up Big City from the More Cities drawer. Now
go to clear Unnatural Objects and clear all of the buildings away.
Then edit the terrain to your liking, but don't select Clear Map.
If it runs smoothly save and when you load it up you will have
$1,138,000,000.

<H2>TIPS</H2>

<H3>PLANNING</H3>

<P>
There are two routes that you can take with your city, fast and
unstable or slow growth and a healthy economy. A fast growth city
leads to all sorts of problems: overcrowding, pollution, high crime
and empty coffers in the treasury, like a computer version of
Detroit. Personally I like to create a huge urban jungle, totally
environmentally unfriendly with a crime rate that runs off the
chart; it gives you more to play around with.
</P>

<P>
On the other side of the coin, a slowly built city, if correctly
planned, will contain average sized buildings and an economy that
will be running in the black. Careful planning at the start of the
game is the key to a successful city. Bad planning leads to
transport problems, pollution, power stations in built up areas and,
ultimately, a massive redevelopment project.
</P>

<P>
Start with the power station. If you're aiming to build a big city
fast go for a nuclear station; it's expensive but the amount of time
my city suffered brownouts is unbelievable. Next step is to zone
the residential areas. Start with two adjoining each other, and
make them a healthy distance away from the power station. Next zone
two industrial areas, away from the residential areas. A commercial
zone should be placed near to these particular places. Link all the
separate areas by roads then hook them up to the power grid.
</P>

<H3>ENLARGING A CITY</H3>

<P>
In order to expand a city you need two things, an increasing
population and a profitable economy. Otherwise concentrate on
improvements tied into civic demands. Increase the amount of
residential zones by two. If all the industrial zones are full,
zone some more away from the previous ones. The same applies to the
commercial areas.
</P>

<P>
If you think your city is big enough with a strong economy build a
port; this increases trade with the city. It also has added bonuses
of increasing land value in the surrounding area making it perfect
for industrial zoning. Make sure that new residential areas are
built when the existing ones are full. If you don't it will give
the Sims something to moan about.
</P>

<H3>MAINTENANCE</H3>

<P>
In order to keep a city running smoothly you'll need to respond to
the demands of the Sims (when they say jump, you hit the ceiling).
</P>

<P>
It is also worth while remembering that every city will go through a
period without growth. At times like these it may be worth
increasing taxes for basic improvements, then lowering them the
following year.
</P>

<H3>SOS</H3>

<P>
If you're city looks like it's sliding down the toilet you'll really
have to work overtime. Start by concentrating all your efforts on
the residential zones, because once people start leaving on a large
scale your city is technically dying. Increase the tax rate by a
percent, and cut the transport budgets by ten percent, so at the end
of the year you have some money to spend. Invest in park and land
around the residential zones; this increases land value and makes
the area nicer for Sims to live in. Follow that up in the next year
by dealing with the problem which is receiving the most civic
attention; but if it proves too expensive deal with a problem you
can afford. Make a two percent tax cut for one year. The low tax
rate should attract people and promote industrial growth. On the
whole try to deal with the problems the Sims are moaning about,
followed up by a tax cut. Never try to make money by putting the
tax rate above ten percent. Unless you have a perfect city you'll
be committing political suicide.
</P>

<H3>MODERNISING YOUR CITY</H3>

<P>
Airports and sea ports are the key to bringing your city in line
with the times, and will make you some cash in the process.
Experiment with more park land, not just to increase land value but
to make the place look good.
</P>

<P>
Probably the most dangerous move you can take with the city is
replacing the roads with railways. This is a useful move as it
reduces traffic congestion, but it also soaks up more maintenance
money. Don't be afraid to experiment - if you think that it's a
good idea for every residential zone to have a power station or
industrial zone, try it. You never know - it might be very
successful.
