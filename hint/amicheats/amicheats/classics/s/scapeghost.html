<H2>SOLVE</H2>

<H3>PART ONE: NOVEMBER GRAVEYARD</H3>

<P>
The last thing you remember is driving in the car with Sarah on the
way to your meet with the drugs gang. All your undercover work was
about to pay off. Now you find yourself standing by your own grave,
with a priest, mourners and a detective. One of the policemen there
says he's glad the funeral is over, this is the part of the work he
hates - going to funerals for stupid bastards who get themselves
killed and their partner captured. Another agrees and says that
it's only because Mr Severian stumbled on them dumping Alan's body
that the crooks needed a hostage, otherwise the girl would be dead.
</P>

<P>
EXAMINE DETECTIVE; Severian, a new recruit to the drugs squad. He's
carrying a matchbook and newspaper. From what he says, talking to
himself, you realise he's one of the crooks. He set you up and
because you're dead, you're a convenient scapegoat.
</P>

<P>
No-one suspects what has happened. If you follow him, he pats the
vaults on his way out of the graveyard and mutters:"Who'd think of
looking in there". You realise it's where he stashed the drugs.
It's up to you to do something so that the crooks can't pick up the
drugs that evening to give the police time to complete their
investigations.
</P>

<P>
EXAM VAULT; You see a flash of white and inside you see a pile of
white plastic bags. EXAM BAGS; the sort you get from high street
shops but they contain narcotics.
</P>

<P>
After a while, a spotlight comes on in the graveyard and the shock
of the lights sends you back to your grave. When you recover, Joe
Danby turns up and offers to show you around. He introduces you to
the other ghosts and then asks to walk round with you.
</P>

<P>
The first thing you must do is to build up your strength. You do
this by picking up small, light things to start with and gradually
picking up heavier and heavier items. When you pick up your first
thing, Joe says it won't be long before you can lift something
worthwhile. You can only pick up one thing at a time.
</P>

<P>
Start with the thistledown, leaf or petal and pick up two of them in
total to start increasing your strength. Then get matchbook and
pebble.
</P>

<P>
Go towards the shed area and you will find a dog. It is making odd
noises and has something (a bone) stuck in its throat. "PAT DOG"
three times, following it if necessary till it knows you're a
friend. "GET BONE".
</P>

<P>
Go to David. He is very scathing about your lack of abilities to
move things. "PUSH URN"; it moves, David is impressed and says he
will help.
</P>

<P>
The Willmots are arguing over a wreath which Edna says is hers but
Bert won't let her have. Go to the faded wreath. On it is a card
showing it is Edna's. Get the yellow card. Go to your grave, get
the white card from your new wreath and drop it. Get the yellow
card again, put it on the new wreath. Try to get the new wreath.
You can't but the dog can. Go to the Willmots and "WAIT FOR DOG".
Edna says the cards on the wreaths are wrong but is still happy
about it. The Willmots will now help you.
</P>

<P>
Get them all to follow you and go to the shed. "EXAM LOCK"; it has
a barrel, short lever, medium lever and long lever. All the levers
must be moved out of the way before the door will open.
</P>

<P>
"JOE, WAIT 3, PUSH LONG LEVER", "BERT, WAIT 2, PUSH MEDIUM LEVER",
"EDNA, WAIT, PUSH SHORT LEVER", "DAVID, TURN BARREL".
</P>

<P>
They do so and the door is now unlocked. Try to pull the rope and
the dog helps. The door opens and the dog enters, grabs the bag of
biscuits from inside as his reward and goes off to eat them.
</P>

<P>
From talking to Violet before, you know she is afraid to leave her
grave in case she can't find it again because she was blind in life.
She wants something by it to make a noise. Inside shed, "GET BELL",
go to Violet. "PUT BELL ON BUSH"; it makes a noise so she can now
leave her grave.
</P>

<P>
To turn off the spotlight and enable you to go further south through
the graveyard, "JOE, WAIT, PUSH BUTTON", "PUSH BUTTON"; the
spotlight goes off.
</P>

<P>
To get rid of the vandals, in the shed "PUSH SWITCH"; the vandals
flee as the light goes on. "PUSH SWITCH" again to turn it off. The
colonel will now follow you.
</P>

<P>
To help Edith, she says she is cursed to remain by her grave till
the end of time. Joe says you must demonstrate the end of time to
her. "GET WATCH" from shed, go to Edith, "PUT WATCH IN VASE"; it
breaks thus demonstrating the end of time! She will now follow you.
</P>

<P>
Go to the sundial and "JOE, PUSH SUNDIAL", "PUSH SUNDIAL"; it breaks
and you can get the gnomon. Go to the bushes and examine them. You
can tell there's something in there. "SEARCH BUSHES" to find a copy
of Time magazine.
</P>

<P>
Go to the stonework and examine it to see a statue that looks like a
sleeping man. "WAKE STATUE"; you hit it and it wakes. It's another
ghost, Alex Pym.
</P>

<P>
Go to the wall which is leaning and "PUSH WALL". Everyone helps.
The wall collapses and traps the drugs so the dealers can't get them
that night, giving you time to find their hideout and clear your
name.

<H3>PART TWO: HAUNTED HOUSE</H3>

<P>
You start the next night by your grave, aware of a house north of
the cemetery. You must find the gang's hideout. Joe says you can
probably now heat and cool things and also reach through solid
objects. He says he will come with you to find the crooks.
</P>

<P>
To pass the green safely, go to the south green and wait till you
see pale headlights. Go south and north. You now see red tail
lights heading away from you and Joe says it's now safe to cross.
</P>

<P>
Outside the house, Joe says if you concentrate you might be able to
bring back visions of what happened. If you "CONCENTRATE" in
various locations, you will see what happened. You see yourself
burying something in the garden, you shooting one of the crooks in
the hall, the crooks clearing the house and burning papers in the
fireplace, one piece being trapped in the chimney shaft, two crooks
taking their dead comrade's body upstairs and returning without it
and then you being hit and taken from the house. The visions leave
you unsure as to whether or not Sarah, your colleague, was working
with the crooks.
</P>

<P>
After your vision of you burying something in the herb garden, "DIG"
and you unearth your plastic ID card. Get it and drop it in the
hallway.
</P>

<P>
"EXAMINE DIRECTORY" in the hall to find a bookmark. EXAMINE it;
it's an old envelope showing the postmark of the village near the
crooks' new hideout. You can't get it on your own so "JOE, WAIT,
GET BOOKMARK", "GET BOOKMARK". Now drop it in hall.
</P>

<P>
By the garden is a stream but the water makes you nervous. On the
water is a branch and on the branch is a map. To get the map, "COOL
WATER", it freezes. Get the map, examine it; it shows the crooks'
new hideout.
</P>

<P>
To get the paper from the chimney, it's too high up to get from
inside and Joe says it might be better to try from the other side.
If you reach through the wall from inside, Joe says it must look
funny from outside. If you reach through the wall from the outside
(by the ivy), you don't know where you are reaching. Joe says he
wonders if he could help. Go back inside, "JOE, WAIT 5, REACH
THROUGH WALL". Go back to the ivy and wait till Joe's hand waves
through the wall. Now if you "REACH INTO WALL" you know where the
chimney is and dislodge the paper. Go back to the lounge and get
the paper. It shows all the first names of the gang - it's a list
of their gambling debts. You realise it will help the police find
out their full names by narrowing down their search. Drop paper in
hall.
</P>

<P>
If you try to go upstairs, the ghost of Luke, the crook you killed,
attacks you and Joe saves you. To get rid of him, you must turn on
the light upstairs but not downstairs (as that will affect you.) so
in hall, "GET BULB, DROP IT, PUSH SWITCH"; the light goes on
upstairs and the ghost screams and vanishes. But now the light
upstairs stops you going up or turning off the switch downstairs.
You must fuse the lights. Go to the kitchen, "GET BULB, DROP IT,
GET FUSE, PUT FOIL IN HOLDER, PUSH SWITCH" and the fuse blows. You
can now go upstairs.
</P>

<P>
In the tank in the attic, if you "CONCENTRATE", you see Luke's body
being put in the tank. You find it in the tank and push off the lid
in your panic.
</P>

<P>
Get plug, go to the bathroom. You see a mirror. "THROW PLUG AT
MIRROR"; the mirror breaks, you see an alcove behind. In it is a
briefcase. Get it. Joe says you have enough evidence, now you must
work out how to get the police.
</P>

<P>
Drop all evidence in the hall - the paper, bookmark, briefcase, map
and card.
</P>

<P>
You have to summon the fire service and bring the evidence to their
attention or they will just kick it out of the way. To do this, go
to the attic carrying the plug and either "FREEZE PLUG TO BODY" or
"TIE PLUG TO BODY". Get the socket, go to the clock, "OPEN PANEL,
PUT SOCKET IN PANEL, CLOSE PANEL". Then "PUSH CLOCK"; it falls down
the stairs and drags the body down behind it. Go to kitchen, "PUSH
BOTTLE"; whisky vapour fills the room. "LIGHT VAPOUR, BLOW
CURTAINS"; the fire gets a grip, firemen arrive, see the body and
realise he was not killed in the fire.
</P>

<P>
They call the police.

</P>

<H3>PART THREE: POLTERGEIST</H3>

<P>
You awake at the start of the third night wondering if you are now
strong enough to bend metal and manifest to mortals. There is a
priest bending over the grave with two members of the gang,
preparing to exorcise you.
</P>

<P>
Go west so you aren't exorcised. You can't return to your grave
either as a free spirit or by being sent there by light as you will
be banished forever.
</P>

<P>
The crooks arrive and say they'll go and get the drugs so follow
them. They collect them, get into the van and it leaves.
</P>

<P>
It drives to a farm. They park in a barn and enter the house but
you can't because of the light inside. You realise it's their
hideout and that you must not only help the police get there without
being seen but also save the evidence. You get a hint during the
trip about the possibility of power cuts.
</P>

<P>
Near the farm is a shed with a generator and at the back of the farm
house, some dangerous-looking connectors with exposed wires. You
can't enter the barn as it's the place you died and the pain drives
you back.
</P>

<P>
Examine hay to find a sprayer and get it. Go to connectors and "HIT
CONNECTORS WITH SPRAYER" to short them out. One crook comes out to
start the generator but says it won't give much power. Go into the
house and you realise you can charge things with static and manifest
yourself. Examine the cupboard in the hall to see a circuit
breaker. "PULL BREAKER" so they can't put the lights back on
properly.
</P>

<P>
The gang are in the kitchen playing cards. There is a briefcase
there containing drugs and you know you'll need it as evidence.
</P>

<P>
John goes up to the attic to act as look-out and Sarah is taken down
to the cellar, tied up and gagged.
</P>

<P>
Follow John to the attic. The window looks out over the countryside
and you know you must distract John so he doesn't see the police.
You also know you must do this five times. Don't distract him till
you see movement outside the window and also don't do it straight
away as you have to "DRAG" this bit out a bit! If you wait too
long, he will spot the police and warn the others so you must time
it so you do it just before he gets suspicious.
</P>

<P>
At the right time, get bulb and drop it; the darkness and noise
frighten him. Get the broken glass.
</P>

<P>
Go down to the cellar door. You can't carry anything if you float
through the door so wait till Weasel arrives to check on Sarah. Go
in when he does, drop the glass and go back to the attic. At the
right time, distract John again - charge the holder so the static
makes his hair stand on end.
</P>

<P>
Go back to the cellar. "MANIFEST" so Sarah can see you and hear
you, then "CUT ROPE" using the glass. She goes and puts the hammer
on the shelf above the door and goes back to her chair, pretending
to still be tied up. Go back to the door and wait till Weasel
arrives again. When he enters, "PUSH HAMMER"; it hits him.
</P>

<P>
Sarah comes through. "MANIFEST" again and "SARAH, TIE WEASEL"; she
ties him up. Leave and she follows you, bolting the door behind
her.
</P>

<P>
Go up to the hall and she looks at the cupboard and says she ought
to find somewhere to hide. "SARAH, GO TO TAXI, DEFLATE TYRES, GO TO
CUPBOARD, HIDE IN IT, WAIT 20". She goes off to do it. You can't
deflate the tyres yourself as the taxi is in the barn where you were
killed.
</P>

<P>
Go back towards the attic and on the way you see a creaky stair.
"PUSH STAIR" to frighten John so long as it's the right time. Go
into the attic and wait for movement outside again, then "BLOW
CURTAINS". Wait again until the time is right and "COOL JOHN" to
scare him the fifth time. Now "MANIFEST"; he is petrified and fires
his gun at you. The others run upstairs to see what's wrong,
leaving the briefcase unguarded in the kitchen.
</P>

<P>
Go back to the hall and "MANIFEST". "SARAH, E, GET CASE, W, HIDE IN
CUPBOARD, WAIT 20". This is because the case is too heavy for you
to carry. She goes, does it and returns.
</P>

<P>
The crooks will now get ready to leave the farm but because the
police are now so close, they won't be able to get away, so long as
you slow them down a bit more. If you have previously examined
John, you know his jacket has a pocket which contains the key to the
van. Go out to the van and "LET DOWN TYRES".
</P>

<P>
When the crooks get to the van, they don't have time to inflate the
tyres. Wait till John arrives and "BEND KEY". They don't have time
to straighten it so they make a dash for it over the fields where
the police capture them.
</P>

<P>
Severian and the Professor go to the taxi. When it gets out of the
barn, it is going slowly because of the flat tyres so "GET INTO
TAXI". Inside, "MANIFEST"; you fight with Severian and because the
tyres are flat, the taxi slides and crashes. The police catch the
two of them when they run away.
</P>

<P>
The evidence is recovered and Sarah is safe and so can give evidence
to clear your name.
