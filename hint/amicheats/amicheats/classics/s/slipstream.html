<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
The nine streams of the Slip Stream have been overtaken by an alien
race who have infested the planet with various defense space crafts.
Each craft is powered by a crystal that lies at the end of each
stream. Object: Liberate the nine streams by destroying each power
crystal. After disembarking from the mother ship, destroy as much of
the landscape and defense crafts as possible. Watch out for
barriers!
