<H2>SOLVE</H2>

<P>
You begin the game in Calypso's cottage, so walk up to the drawer
and open it. You'll find a pair of scissors. Next, walk over to
the fridge and pick up the magnet. Leave the house and head towards
the village.
</P>

<P>
Pick up the rope outside the Blacksmith's shop (it's near the
barrel) and the bell clapper (on the banch near the door).
</P>

<P>
Walk behind the shop and head for 'The Drunken Druid'. Inside,
you'll find a box of matches on top of the fruit machine, so pick
them up. Then walk over to the dwarf and cut off his beard with the
scissors. Engage the nubile valkyries in conversation and then walk
across to the adjoining room.
</P>

<P>
Talk to the wizard's about becoming one yourself. If you're
persistent they'll send you off on a quest to find a crystall staff.
Leave the pub, and head off to the left.
</P>

<P>
Continue walking left past 'The Shoppe'.
</P>

<P>
Outside the village gates follow the path to the right.
</P>

<P>
Keep going right.
</P>

<P>
Offer to help the whingeing Barbarian by pulling the thorn out of
his foot, and in exchange he'll give you a blocked whistle. Take
the road going up.
</P>

<P>
At the juction turn right.
</P>

<P>
Walk past the owl. It will wake up and call you over for a chat,
but don't get too involved in a conversation because it talks
rubbish! The only useful purpose that the owl serves is dropping
one of it's feathers, so don't forget to pick it up before heading
off to the right.
</P>

<P>
Continue walking to the right.
</P>

<P>
At the five-pointed crossroads, take the first exit to the right
(going down).
</P>

<P>
Head on left past the spot where the Barbarian had been crying.
</P>

<P>
Turn off at the junction, heading down.
</P>

<P>
Continue walking right, past the fallen white tree.
</P>

<P>
At the junction turn right and head down.
</P>

<P>
Continue walking left.
</P>

<P>
Outside the witch's cottage turn the well handle to raise a bucket
of water, and pick it up. Back track up the path the way you came
from. At the junction turn right.
</P>

<P>
As you walk past the tree stump, the woodworms will start talking to
you. They will send you on a sub-quest to find some wood. This is
one of the funniest scenes in the game. Head off to the right.
</P>

<P>
Continue walking right until you find a path cross a bridge blocked
by a Troll taking industrial action.
</P>

<P>
Keep him talking until he notices the whistle round your neck.
Offer it to him for him to blow it, and watch the look of horror on
his face as th Barbarian jumps out of nowhere to kick the ungrateful
Troll into the river. You can now safely cross over the bridge.
</P>

<P>
At the Y-junction take the upper road and continue right, crossing
another stone bridge.
</P>

<P>
Talk to the idiot sitting by the tree. Use the bucket of water from
the well to soak his beans. Simon will then exit right. Make him
go back to pick up the beans from the puddle.
</P>

<P>
Use the map facility to return to where you met the owl. From there
head right. You'll come to the star-shaped crossroads again. Take
the path heading towards the top right.
</P>

<P>
You'll come across an excavation site. Have a word with the
ostentatious paleontologist digging in the hole. Continue heading
up the road.
</P>

<P>
You are now in the centre of the forest. Pick up the stone next to
the dwarf mine and examine it, as it contains a password. Take the
first set of steps leading above the mine.
</P>

<P>
Pick up the piece of paper near the big doors and examine it (it's a
shopping list). Go back to the entrance of the mine and follow the
road to the right.
</P>

<P>
Converse with the miserable wood-cutter until he shows you his metal
detector. Ask to borrow it.
</P>

<P>
Use the map to get you over to the crossroads. Once there, take the
path leading down the right-hand corner.
</P>

<P>
Join the clapper you took from the Blacksmith's bench with the bell,
and ring it. The maiden will cast her pony-tail out,
Rapunzel-style, so use her hair as a rope to climb up the tower.
</P>

<P>
After the maiden has transformed, pick up the piglet and return to
the village. Head up the little alleyway next to 'The Shoppe'.
</P>

<P>
Don't get to involved with the dodgy geezer, as at this stage he's
of little use to you. Walk past him to the other side.
</P>

<P>
Pick up the ladder which is leaning against the wall. Walk inside
the Druid's cottage.
</P>

<P>
Inside you'll find some cold remedy and a specimen jar. Pick them
up. Cross over to the left once you leave the cottage.
</P>

<P>
Use the little piglet to eat its way through the chocolate truffle
door, and enter.
</P>

<P>
Pick up the smoke box and hat and go back out.
</P>

<P>
Walk round to the beehive and use the matches to light the smoke
box. When activity within the apiary has ceased you can swipe some
nice wax. Now go back to Calypso's cottage and walk round to the
back yard.
</P>

<P>
Plant the beans taken from the idle idiot who you encountered
earlier in the magic compost, and pick up the water melon that grows
there. Go to the pub.
</P>

<P>
Ask the barman for a drink, and while he stoops down to look for it,
use the wax to block the tap of the barrel behind the bar. The
barman will give you a beer voucher as compensation for not having
your drink in stock. Leave the pub.
</P>

<P>
Pick up the defective beer barrel left outside by the publican.
</P>

<P>
Go to the dwarf mine. Put on the beard and go in, giving the
password you found on the stone outside the mine.
</P>

<P>
Make as if to walk past the sleeping guard. The accountant sitting
at the table will wake him. You'll be challenged by the guard, so
bribe him with the one thing that dwarves have effection for (other
than snow white!) - beer. He'll take you and the beer barrel down
with him into the cellar.
</P>

<P>
Once there, use the owl feather to tickle the snoring dwarf's smelly
feet. He'll keel over, revealing a key. Pick it up and go back
upstairs.
</P>

<P>
Go down the stairs where the guard stopped you. The accountant will
scream blue murder, but there's nothing he can do to stop you, so
you can afford a self-righteous smile as you walk past his bemused
face.
</P>

<P>
Unlock the safe door with the key.
</P>

<P>
Offer the beer voucher to the dwarf inside. He'll reward you with a
gem before unceremoniously turning you out. Don't forget to pick up
the hook under the safe door.
</P>

<P>
Use the map to get to the owl tree. Follow the path going right to
the five-pointed crossroads, and head straight on, going the way
that Simon is facing.
</P>

<P>
You'll come across a noisy busker playing his musical instrument
rather badly. Launch the water melon at his organ, which will soon
come into your possession.
</P>

<P>
Journey to the centre of the forest using your map, and go up the
stairs on the right.
</P>

<P>
Go into the cave and follow the stone path. Cross the swamp and
walk past the statues. When you reach the sleeping giant, use the
sousaphone to stir him from his deep sleep. He'll unwillingly knock
down a tree, providing you with an improvised bridge. Get across
and enter the dragon's cave for an amusing encounter. Return to the
village.
</P>

<P>
Walk up the little alley next to 'The Shoppe' and sell your gem to
the dodgy geezer for twenty gold pieces. Backtrack to the shop when
the transaction has been completed.
</P>

<P>
Hand over the shopping list to the shop keeper. Whilst there, you
may as well buy some white spirit and a hammer, with which you will
recieve a complimentary free nail (no expense spared, eh?). Venture
back to the swamp. Walk up to the house and knock on the door.
</P>

<P>
Unfortunately, you now have to consume the stew - indeed, you'll
have to eat a second bowl of the vile stuff. When the demented
swampling serves you with a third bowl, however, empty its
maggot-infested contents into the specimen jar. The swampling will
obsessively try to serve you more of its evil concoction, but will
mercifully find an empty cauldron. It will then head off out of the
house with its little net to fish some gunge out of the local sewer,
no doubt. Take this opportunity to reward the swampling's
hospitality by snooping around its home. Move the wooden chest.
Open the trapdoor beneath and climb down the ladder.
</P>

<P>
Hammer the nail on the loose plank, and walk across to Skull Island.
Pick up the frogsbane and use the map to get to the dragon's cave.
</P>

<P>
Use the cold remedy on the dragon to help him rest. Cast the hook
at the boulder on top of the cave's entrance and climb up. Tie the
magnet to the rope, and lower it down the hole to gain some gold
coins. Climb down.
</P>

<P>
Walk to the right behind the cave, and continue until you come
across some climbing pins with a gap. Forget about them - just jump
across the icy ledge beneath. You'll eventually come across an old
tree. Talk to it, then use the white spirit to get rid of the pink
splodge on its bark. If you speak with the tree again you'll get
some nagic words from it. Backtrack through the snow to the
gargantuan face etched into the rock. Pick up the smaller rock
scattered nearby. Go back inside the dragon's cave and pick up the
fire extinguisher. Goto the place where the giant is sleeping, and
head to the left.
</P>

<P>
When you reach the statue of the wizard, get out the metal detector
and find the milrith.
</P>

<P>
Goto the Blacksmith and place a rock upon his anvil. He'll break it
up, revealing a fossil within.
</P>

<P>
Use the map to get to the centre of the forest, and take the left
footpath to the excavations. Throw the fossil down to the digger.
When he asks you where you found it, tell him 'Craggy Peaks', and
he'll accommodate you by providing cheap labour.
</P>

<P>
Get yourself to Craggy Peaks, where you left the metal detector.
Dr. Jones has wasted no time on his new excavations. If you
examine the dirt you'll find the milrith ore. Next, it's time to
visit the wood- cutter again.
</P>

<P>
Tell him the good news. He, in turn, will send you to the
Blacksmith.
</P>

<P>
As you did with the rock earlier on, place the milrith on the anvil
and the Balcksmith will shape it into an axe-head. Take the
finished product to the wood-cutter.
</P>

<P>
The wood-cutter will take the axe and leave without shutting the
door to his house, so why not reward his faith in humanity by
breaking in?
</P>

<P>
Inside his cottage you'll find a climbing pin on the table. Feel
free to take it. Next, put out the fire with the fire extinguisher.
Move the hook in the fireplace to go down into the basement.
</P>

<P>
Help yourself to some mahogany and take it to the starving
woodworms. They'll jump into your hat. Use your map to get to the
crossroads. Take the path at the bottom right corner.
</P>

<P>
Climb up the tower where you rescued the maiden and the pig ealier
on. Unleash the woodworms onto the floorboards to get you onto
ground level.
</P>

<P>
Pick up the wedge securing the entrance door and then use the ladder
to climb down into the basement.
</P>

<P>
Open up the sarcophagus. You have to be quick with the next
operation other wise Simon will get cold feet and run off, leaving
you to try again. Search out the loose bandage with the mouse
pointer, and use the 'pick-up' command with it in order to take care
of the mummy. Pick up the crystal staff and take it to the four
wizards with whom you spoke in the pub.
</P>

<P>
The wizards will greedily ask you also to pay a registration fee of
thirty gold pieces. If you haven't got enough money, then venture
back to the top of the dragon's cave to fish out some more using the
magnet. You should end up with forty-one gold pieces altogether.
Give the wizards their money, and they'll give you a wizard's
starter pack. Take special note of the allegory with modern-day
banking institutions.
</P>

<P>
Use the map to get to the crossroads, and take the little alley
heading up to the right. When you reach the waterfall, search
around the bottom left-hand corner where you'll find a vine. Use it
to climb down.
</P>

<P>
At the bottom you'll find a Gollum impersonator angling. Swap the
swamp stew for the fishing rod to find the ring. Goto the village.
</P>

<P>
The shop-keeper has finished the order, so climb into the cardboard
box outside the shop.
</P>

<P>
When you arrive at your destination, open up the box and climb out.
If you search around the empty boxes you'll find your spell book.
Inside the book you'll discover a loose piece of paper. Search with
the mouse pointer between the boxes and the door to find a rat bone.
Slide the piece of paper underneath the door, then use the rat bone
to push the key off the lock on the other side so that it will fall
on the paper. Pull back the piece of paper with the key on it to
unlock the door. Open it and get out of the stockroom.
</P>

<P>
Pick up the metal bucket with the hole in it outside the cells, and
descend down the stairs.
</P>

<P>
Pick up the mints near the dungeon window. Chat with the Druid
who's tied up on the rack. After a while he will ignore you and
refuse to talk any further. Take off the ring of invisibility and
resume the conversation. He will put you through a test to make
sure that you're not evil. Pick up the flaming brand next to the
sharp objects. Place the metal bucket on the Druid's head. Use the
flaming brand on the bucket to turn the Druid into a frog. Open up
the Iron maiden, and hide in there for a few days until the frog
returns with a hacksaw. Use it to cut through the bars so you can
escape. Goto the Druid's cottage (where you picked up the cold
remedy).
</P>

<P>
The Druid will give you a magic potion in exchange for the frogsbane
found on Skull Island. Goto the witch's cottage.
</P>

<P>
Pick up the broom to conjure up the witch. Take up the hag's
challenge to a duel. Use the words given to you by the talking
tree. If you lose (the battle is a form of scissors, paper, stone,
using spells and counter-spells) just keep going back until you win.
Take the broom- stick as your reward. The witch will metamorphose
into a slovenly dragon. All you have to do is say 'Abracadabra' to
turn yourself into a tiny mouse. Make your escape through the
mouse-hole along the edge of the top wall.
</P>

<P>
Climb up the snowy mountains until you reach the ferocious snowman.
Use the extra-strong mints to melt him to oblivion. Continue your
upward climb.
</P>

<P>
When you reach the castle, use the broomstick to get to the door.
Drink up the Druid's potion and you'll shrink small enough to creep
in through the bottom.
</P>

<P>
Pick up the leafin the garden. Walk inside the rusty old bucket.
If you look around you'll find a match, and outside, near the
bucket, you'll also find a stone. Carry on walking left.
</P>

<P>
Use the dog hair to lasso onto the tap, then pick up the leaf
floating on the pond and bring it ashore. Use the matchstick as a
mast and the other leaf as a sail to make an improvised boat. Pick
up some seeds from the red pots next to the tap and bring them back.
Use the stone to pulp the seeds into an oil which you can use to
lubricate the jammed tap. Pull the hair to open the pub, and get on
the boat to cross the nowirrigated puddle.
</P>

<P>
You'll be confronted by a large frog on your arrival. Look in the
water, however, and you'll find a little tadpole. Pick it up and
use it as a hostage to negotiate peace terms with the amphibian
menace. When the frog flees you'll find some yellow mushrooms. Eat
one to return to your normal size.
</P>

<P>
Pick a branch off the tree and open the door. The wooden chest
inside will spring to life and chase you out. Go back and use the
branch to jam its lethal jaws. Pick up the spear from the rack and
the shield from by the stairs. Go on up.
</P>

<P>
Pick up the magic wand on the dresser, the green sack next to the
bed, the blue money-pouch on the bed and the book on the pink pillow
at the right. Read the book. Speak to the mirror, then go upstairs
to the second floor.
</P>

<P>
Pick up the chemicals on the bench in the middle of the lab, then
walk round to the bookcase and pick up Sordid's spell book. Use the
chemicals to renew the shine on the shield, and hang the shield on
the hook protruding from the front of the bench. See what bits of
inform- -ation you can extract from the lower-class demons, and go
down the stairs.
</P>

<P>
Talk the mirror into spying on the demons upstairs for you so that
you can find out their real names. Go downstairs all the way to the
dungeon in the basement.
</P>

<P>
Using the spear, knock off the skull hanging ceiling and pick it up
from the floor. Walk over to the other side of the dungeon and pick
up the chest. Return and pull the lever on the crushing machine
next to the footbridge. Place the chest on the block and push the
lever. Pull the lever to raise the block up again. You'll find the
candles you need for your demonic incantation amongst the ruins. Go
upstairs to the bedroom with the mirror.
</P>

<P>
Look down at the side of the staircase to find a small mouse-hole.
Put the cheesy green sock inside the blue pouch, and use it to coax
the mouse out of its dwelling, and consequently entrapping it. Go
upstairs for a chat with the demons.
</P>

<P>
If you help the demons return to their dimension, they will assist
you with the teleporter. They will give you the chalk with which to
draw the square on the floor. When you've exorcised them, walk over
to the teleporter and use it to get to the 'Fiery Pits of Rondor'.
</P>

<P>
When you materialize, search around with the mouse pointer until you
find a pebble nearby. Pick it up. To your left is a small sapling.
Pick it up. Talk to the attendant and he'll give you some
brochures. Look at the brochures to find an elastic band. Use the
band together with the sapling to create a catapult. Fire the
pebble at the red bell to get rid of the pesky attendant. Pick up
the souvenir matches at the corner of the stall and head for the
pits.
</P>

<P>
Cross the bridge, picking up the bucket of floor wax, and head for
the fiery pits.
</P>

<P>
Use the magic wand on Sordid to let him taste some of his own
medicine. Light up the fiery pits with the matches. Cast the wand
into the flames to return the statues to life. Sordid will attack
you, but you'll survive, so go back and use the floor wax on him.
If you don't succeed, try again until he falls over, then kick him
into the pit.
</P>
