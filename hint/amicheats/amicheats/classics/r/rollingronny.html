<P>
On the high score table, enter "CHEAT" for your name, this should
give you the power of flight. Press 'C' during play to fly. Press
'F9' for more money. If this doesn't work try typing "TRACTOR" for
you name on the high score table.
</P>

<P>
Try both of these: Entering your name as "RONNY" on the high score
list or typing in "MICHAEL" when you die at the end of the game will
give you the ability to fly. If this doesn't work, try pressing
'F9' to get all your energy back.
