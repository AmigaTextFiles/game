<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Rick Dangerous combines fast-action arcade adventure with humorous
graphics and strange sounds to give gamers an alternative to the
fight to the death genre of entertainment software. The hero, armed
only with a six-shooter, some dynamite, and a Big Stick, spends most
of his time trying to stay alive amidst the chaos and mayhem of a
variety of exotic, dangerous locales. Rick fights for his life in
four scenarios: an Amazon temple, where Rick must dodge hostile
tribesmen; an Egyptian pyramid, where Rick squares off against
ruthless assassins; a Nazi prison camp, where Rick fights to free
Allied POW's; and a Nazi missile base, where Rick is the last hope
of the free world. Each scenario calls for the fast reflexes and the
ability to solve puzzles appearing at a moment's notice, and leaving
little time to find the answer.
