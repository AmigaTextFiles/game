Each planet can contain 9 mines max. and 1 mining robot per mine,
but as many derricks staying in the place.

<P>
When you begin a new construction, verify if there is enough
electricity, if, not, build a second nuclear center.

The invention of the mining robot finished, buy 7 others and place
it in the mines.

Buy 3 satellites and dispatched one of them on the moon Apollo and
you will learn that she contains Raenium.
</P>

<P>
More important ores in the game are: Detoxin, Enorgon and Texon.

Dispatch an other satellite on Amnesty 2. The destruction of this
satellite unlatchs the research of a new launch average.
