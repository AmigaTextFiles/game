<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Experience action, romance, thrills, and spills of the old Saturday
morning serials. Action begins with an urgent message from the
future... a future that saw the Nazis win WWII. An underground group
of scientists in the 21st century risk lives to send you a jet
propelled rocket suit, ray gun, and secret decoder wheel. Skillfully
used against a cunning and ruthless foe, these devices help you
become the superhero that changes history and saves mankind.
</P>

<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
Rescue the professor as this slows down the nazis, they can't use
him to increase their efficiency. You will waste valuable time
unless you rescue him from the zeppelin while he is over the
atlantic shooting the gunner in the gondola is tricky, the best
method being shoot below the gunner and move left and right until
you are on target. Gradually move up until you hit the gondola.
When you hit it there is a flash, stop firing and after a few
seconds you'll be inside the gondola.
</P>

<P>
Find the supply of lunarium before the fort knox supply runs out,
so infiltrate the nazi base which recieves lunarium from the moon.
It is in south america or africa, once infiltrated, your agent
there will cary on sending you lunarium throughout the game. You
will have to storm the nazi base first.
</P>

<H2>SOLVE</H2>

<H3>STARTING THE GAME</H3>

<P>
When you have loaded the game and you are greeted with the option
menu, go straight to the War Room. Now move two of your agents to
South America, and place the other three agents in Africa. Forget
about flashy Joe on Germany, move them straight to these areas, then
exit. Now takeoff. Forget the fuel depot. Enter 23 into your tank
to get you to the Atlantic.
</P>

<H3>THE ZEPPELIN</H3>

<P>
On the first screen, the Zeppelin will move from left to right
across the screen. You can not hit it with your gun, but you can
destroy the torpedoes that are fired at you. Once ten torpedoess
have been fired, regardless of whether you have hit them all or not,
you go automatically onto the next screen.
</P>

<P>
On the second screen, the zeppelin is much closer. Here you have to
aim at the gondola just below the main airsack. Torpedoes are also
fired at you. Try to dodge them; do not bother about destroying
them unless they get in the way. The main objective here is to
shoot the gondola. If you successfully hit it, a green flash will
appear. Do not fire anymore, and you will go onto the next screen.
If you accidently shoot the airsack on the zepp, then it blows up
and you have failed this bit. But do not worry, as you have not
lost the game. See the `Barnstoff's Captured' section in this
solution for more details.
</P>

<P>
On the third screen, you will now be in the zeppelin gondola, where
Jane and the Prof are. After she says something to you, on the
FIRST time you successfully rescue them, you reply like this:
</P>

<OL>
<LI>"Loosen up Dollface"
<LI>"I like your style"
<LI>"I oughtta teach you"
<LI>"I took the scenic route"
<LI>"Can you use some help?"
</OL>

<P>
Once this has been entered, you automatically fly back to Fort Dix,
with Jane and the Prof. Later in the game, the Nazi's capture Jane
and the Prof again from the USA, in which you have to attack the
Zeppelin again, it happens three times in all. The second time you
successfully get into the Gondola your relies are:
</P>

<OL>
<LI>"I'm glad to see you too"
<LI>"I just want to help you"
<LI>"Can you use some help?"
</OL>

<P>
The third time, your replies are:
</P>

<OL>
<LI>"I'd be happy to leave"
<LI>"I just want to help you"
<LI>"Can you use some help?"
</OL>

<P>
These replies ALWAYS work successfully if you enter them in the
correct order.
</P>

<H3>THE WAR ROOM</H3>

<P>
You should return here after you have returned from the first
zeppelin raid. Your agents should be flashing so read the reports.
Your first objective is to find the Nazi Bases. The next objective
is to find the 5 Rocket parts, organise resistance in the west, and
knock Nazi effeciency down a bit.
</P>

<P>
The Temple base is nearly always in SOUTH AMERICA, whereas the
DESERT BASE is nearly always in AFRICA. Try these places for both
bases:
</P>

<P>
South America: Venezuela, Columbia, etc
</P>

<P>
Africa: Middle-East, Kenya, East Africa, Egypt, etc.
</P>

<P>
Once a base is found, organise resistance and fly to it straight
away. When you go for a fly, try to visit more than one country if
possible. ie, attack a Rocket Factory, then go to a base. Once
resistance is organized, Lunarium comes flooding in.
</P>

<P>
It is also useful having a bash at a Zeppelin Factory, or a fighter
base, or a brain washing plant just to slow the Zeppelins down.
Once the two bases are found etc, you must locate the 5 parts of the
Rocket. It is also usefull to try and get Canada, and all of South
America turned brown, which means resistance organized, as it gives
you extra time for locating rocket parts, as the zeppelins take
longer to occupy a country with resistance organized in it.
</P>

<P>
Try to keep two agents in the left side of the world, leaving three
agents to investigate the right part. If you have less than three
agents left, and you are still locating the two bases, FORGET IT -
start again! Once you have all 5 parts, and enough Lunarium, you
can construct your rocket and fly to the moon.
</P>

<H3>BARNSTOFF'S CAPTURED</H3>

<P>
If you blow up the zeppelin (silly bod!) then they are first taken
to Germany in a sub, when you get back to Fort Dix, you get a
message saying that they are going to get exterminated, and it
suggests you fly to Germany. Well I strongly advise you not too. I
have completed the game by ignoring this message, it is up to you,
but I advise you don't. If you forget about it, you later get
another message saying they have been taken to the desert base (one
of the Lunarium ones you are trying to find!). If you ignore it
again, they just get sent to the moon unharmed.
</P>

<P>
If you want to fly to Germany, when you get the message about Jane
and the Prof, then you get the Shoot Planes screen. If you kill
them (easy as there are only eight!) you land in Germany, where you
get immiediately captured, you then get interrogated, and you answer
as the zeppelin screen. I never got this right. I once told him
that "Hitler eats Babies" in which I escaped to another country, but
I did not free Jane and the Prof.
</P>

<P>
If you are unsuccessful, then when you get the next message about
them being taken to the Desert Base, fly to it (that is if you have
found it!) and you get captured again, with the same screen as
Germany! Which is why I ignored it as I could never get the answers
right! As I mentioned before, it is not necessary to go through
this bit.
</P>

<P>
If you fly to Germany when Jane and the Prof are not there, and
successfully shoot the planes down, then when you land you get a
message saying well done, and Nazi efficiency has gone down by 5%.
</P>

<H3>NAZI EFFICIENCY</H3>

<P>
This is where you can knock down the percentage in the top right
hand screen, to slow the Zeppelin down. You do this by your agents
reporting about a brainwashing plant, or looting of art treasure,
zeppelin factory. If you fly to the country, then all it is, is the
plane shoot, and once this is done you get a suitable message saying
efficiency down by 10%. It is only worth doing this in the early
stages of the game, as the plane shoot gets much harder later on.
</P>

<H3>ME 109'S</H3>

<P>
On this screen you are soaring above the clouds, ME 109's attack in
formations, the best way I have found is to stay at the bottom and
pick them off. This screen, in my opinion, is the hardest screen of
the game, except for perhaps the moon shoot out. Once you have been
hit three times, then kaput. You'd better have enough Lunarium to
get home!
</P>

<H3>TAKEOFF</H3>

<P>
Make sure you have loaded up with enough Lunarium - a heavy load is
harder to take off of course, but if you press the button, in time
to his legs being directly underneath his body, you should manage
it. Watch out for the lame seagull, and also watch out for the UFO
which appears from time to time on the screen where you soar up
through the sky.
</P>

<H3>THE ACK-ACK SCREEN</H3>

<P>
This is the attack on the Desert Base. It is at night, and ack-ack
batteries come at you from the top of the screen. If you fire your
gun a bit before the batteries, you will destroy them. Once you
have hit ten you have done it! You can only take three hits from
Flak! Very easy.
</P>

<H3>THE TEMPLE SHOOTOUT</H3>

<P>
This is also very, very easy. This places you in front of a temple,
where you have to knock out machine guns positioned at the windows.
Pull down on the joystick and the bullets miss you, you have three
seconds before the machine gun opens up, so rush to the window and
fire slightly above it, and KABOOM! If you get hit three times then
you have failed. Once you destroy all guns, the door opens and you
have done it!
</P>

<H3>THE PUNCH UP</H3>

<P>
When you fly to a rocket factory, upon landing you have to bash the
pulp out of a guard. There are four moves and two ducks, the ducks
are use- less. The first three guards are dead easy, the last two
can be sorted out if you keep the joystick pressed up, and press the
firebutton when his face is uncovered, knock his bar down, and BLAM,
you did it!
</P>

<H3>THE MOONBASE</H3>

<P>
Once you have the final rocket part and 500 units of Lunarium,
assemble your rocket, load the Lunarium and blast off! You will
then find yourself in the Mine. You have to shoot the women zombie
slaves from the platforms in similiar fashion to the Temple shoot
out. To hit them stay down until the girls cease firing, then move
over and shoot them. Be quick as they will escape on ropes and
return. Repeat the process carefully, for those on the right.
Don't forget that your vision becomes impaired due to the effects of
the Lunarium, so hurry. If you have succeeded, the world is saved!
If you are to slow, then Nazi's are in the Whitehouse!
</P>

<H3>THE ALIEN</H3>

<P>
Surprise, surprise... your not done. It seems the nazi's have gotten
their technology from some helping aliens. All you have to do is
shoot all the aliens eyes while avoiding his spit!
</P>

<P>
Once he's dead, your done! CONGRADULATIONS!!!
