<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
The proud Thorwalians of Arkania's Northern Beaches face a dismal
future. Rumors abound of a waiting army, banded together under one
powerful Orc chieftain, standing ready to lay waste to Arkania's
town and villages. All hope of survival rests on your ability to
discover the wherabouts of a legendary artifact thought lost with
its Wielder in the midst of Orcish territory. Can the renowned
sword, the Blade of Destiny, stop the siege?
</P>

<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
At the beginning of the game you should stay in Thorwal and equip
yourself. The best arms merchant is Grollo, the best merchant is
Stoerrebrandt-Grassberg and Minna Musporeiken for Herbs. Wand spell
#2 is very useful. As soon as you hear Hetman's announcement, head
over to his office to accept the mission. Just ask the Hetman about
payment and he gives you a writ for entry to Thorwal's armoury.
</P>

<H3>EVENINGS</H3>

<P>
In the evenings, an extended visit to the "Four Winds" tavern would
be useful. You might hear the story of the Ship of the Dead.
</P>

<H3>DUNGEON</H3>

<P>
In the south west section of Thorwal, look for the fortress. To
enter, bark at the young warrior guarding the gate and insist to see
Master Dramosch.
</P>

<H3>HEADING OUT</H3>

<P>
After beating the bandits in Thorwal, travel to Felstyn. There you
meet the man Hetman recommended, Isleif Olgardson. On the way to
Felstyn you'll pass Angobodirtal, visit Beorn Hjallason. After
meeting with Beorn and Isleif you may choose to follow the leads you
get.
</P>

<H3>TOURIST TIPS</H3>

<P>
Carry a sufficient supply of rope, you may need to build a bridge.
On the road from Rovamund to Nordvest you will come upon a body
carrying and amulet guarding against the spell Ignifaxus.
</P>

<P>
The marshes along the Bodir river are dangerous, you may lose
equipment and you might catch "blue cough".
</P>

<P>
Walking from Phexcaer to Hermits lake there is a possibility of an
ambush by Orcs. The orc leader is wearing an amulet guarding
against Transformation magic. Along the same route, some Gryphons
will bar the way. The solution to their riddle is WHEEL.
</P>

<P>
The march from Daspota to Rybon is interrupted by a meeting, a dying
adventuress tells you the location of the Daspota treasure. It is
on the road from Rybon to Thoss. Following the road further, you
will meet harpies and they give you information about some abandoned
ruins inhabited by the Dark Mage who is in possession of a segment
of the Map.
</P>

<P>
There is an abandoned Inn by the road from daspota to Ottarje, where
you can pause to rest, be prepared for a fight as the cellars are
inhabited by the undead.
</P>

<P>
There is a path branching off the road between Ottarje and Skjal,
leading towards a cave inhabited by spiders, plus followers of the
Spider demon MACTAN.
</P>

<P>
On the route from Ottarje to Orvil, explore the Wolf's Lair, also on
this route is the Druid Gorah's forest clearing (Umbrik Sevenstones
in Orvil tells you about this). When you arrive Gorah is in the
middle of summoning a creature. Don't bother attacking with
missiles. You will have to melee with the wolves. The faster the
victory the better, his forces are reinforced by Harpies and a sabre
toothed tiger if you don't make quick work of it and if that is not
enough he summons a demon. Once you have won, search his cabin.
Seek out the rune-bone Umbrik Sevenstones desires, get the rest of
the treasure.
</P>

<P>
On the riverwalk from Thoss to Liskor your characters will notice an
Orcish monolith on the opposite bank of the river. Cross over by
raft and destroy the idol. The gods will look favourably upon this
and it will increase your chances of a miracle.
</P>

<P>
The mountain path from Felsteyn to Orkanger is dangerous, your
characters are attacked by brigands. You do however, have a chance
to turn the situation around and ambush the brigands in their camp
as well. Near the end of the road is a cave occupied by Goblins.
</P>

<P>
There is a route not shown on the map between Skellen to Phexcaer.
There isn't a path branching of the route, so you are forced to keep
going until the end. There isn't a sign of human civilisation
beside a Temple of Firun, but you are compensated for by an any
amount of breakneck climbs, opportunities to get lost and a vast
highland moor offering ample opportunity to lose valuable pieces of
equipment. The highlight is the meeting with an elf woman who
leaves your characters with the recipe for a healing potion. Along
the way, you will stumble upon a cave housing an Orcish scouting
party. The cave contains important information. Also, the route to
Hyggelik's ruins start along this way, but until the characters find
enough map pieces, they won't be aware of its existence.
</P>

<P>
Along the road from Orvil to Rovik, you come upon a wolf pack
attacking a flock of sheep, and find evidence of the dark druid
Gorah.
</P>

<P>
Passing by Hermit's lake, you will walk into a dangerous swamp,
where you may lose time and equipment. On the bright side, this
route gives you the chance to meet the Unicorn and to climb to the
top of a rock needle where a vision grants tremendous amount of
information. Beware this is a dangerous climb.
</P>

<H3>WHERE ARE THE MAP PIECES?</H3>

<P>
The first map piece you should look for is in Angobodirtal. Abusive
treatment of Beorn Hjallasson will result in a map fragment.
</P>

<P>
Isleif Olgardson lives in Felstyn and will give you a map piece.
</P>

<P>
Ragna Firunjasdotter in Vidsland will aprt with a map piece only
after a polite request to look at it.
</P>

<P>
Yasma Thinmarsdotter used to live in Clanegh, but has since moved to
Thoss. She once owned a map fragment, but it was stolen by a dark
mage. She will tell your characters the exact location of his
fortress.
</P>

<P>
Umbrik Sevenstones is a Druid from Orvil. He will send the
characters on a quest and upon completion, will present the
characters with a letter of introduction to Tiomar Swafnildson in
Brendhil. Presenting Tiolmar with this letter will result in your
characters receiving a map fragment.
</P>

<P>
Eliane Windenbek lives in Varnhome and will send the characters on a
quest. When you complete the quest you'll get a map fragment.
</P>

<P>
Jurge Thorfinson is a resident of Skjal. When you visit him, he
will send you to Thorwal to ge a letter of introduction from the
Hetman. When you give him the letter he gives you a map fragment.
</P>

<P>
Treborn Kollberg is a travelling merchant willing to sell a map
fragment. Should the characters decline to purchase it they can
visit him in Clanegh.
</P>

<P>
The Unicorn can be found near Hermit's Lake. Upon meeting this
creature, keep calm and under no circumstances draw your weapons.
The Unicorn may reappear after one week, delivering a randomly
chosen map fragment.
</P>

<P>
After you collect all the map fragments, you should travel from
Skelellen to Phexcaer because along the way you will discover and
Orc's cave. Inside you will find an important document. After
receiving the document, travel from Vilnhome to Phexcaer and your
characters will lead directly to the ruins housing the sword.
</P>

<P>
The final part of the mission requires the team to return to
Phexcaer and march north to Hermit's Lake. About halfway along the
route, they will come across a gigantic Orcish army camp. Here they
have to choose a champion and hope the gods are smiling on them this
day.
