<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
The troopers are Cyborg Class 2-A, approved to carry heavy energy
weapons and tactical missiles for off-world combat. Specially
constructed landscapes in deepest space provide a nightmare
environment of deadly machines and hostile life forms. Mistakes are
fatal, but success will lead Rotox to the high powered weaponry he
needs to escape. Ten levels, state-of-the-art graphics, and music.
Weapons include scatter-bombs, grenade launchers, jet packs, and
heat-seeking missiles.
