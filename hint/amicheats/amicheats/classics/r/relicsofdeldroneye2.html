<H2>SOLVE</H2>

<H3>THE ISLAND OF DEBREEN</H3> 

<P>
Relics of Deldroneye II is an adventure filled with a sense of
mystery. And such an aura can be shattered forever by reading the
entire solution to a game before even playing it. It is advised the
following solution should be used to help you when your final effort
is a futile one. Anything less than that and you are denying
yourself the rewards that come with completing a game such as this
on your own. However, if you want to see it all, and see it now
then please read on.
</P>

<P>
You take control of Falcon on the bridge of his new spaceship, and
have narrowly escaped collision with an unknown vessel at the
expense of all your fuel and reserve power. You decide to steal the
nessesary power from the unknown vessel by manouvering your ship to
its side and cutting your way in.
</P>

<H3>MOVING THE SHIP</H3>

<P>
Use the laserpen on the Power In socket on the console to active the
view screen. Look at the view screen to read the situation. Now
use the laserpen on the Power Out socket to retrieve your valuable
power. Move right to the engine room and open the engine panel.
Feed power from your laserpen into the engine to activate it. Make
your way to the navigation room and open the PIV Door. Feed your
last unit of power from the laserpen into the computer via the Power
Input Valve. Talk to the computer and it will eventually feed some
vectors into the main computer back on the bridge. Before leaving
the room, open the power output valve door and restore the power to
your laserpen by taking it back. Go to the bridge and new vectors
will be available, so hit the button on the console and the ship
should move to the calculated vector, next to the Debreen vessel.
</P>

<H3>FORCED ENTRY</H3>

<P>
From here on in, you'll need a spacesuit to survive your exploration
of the Debreen craft. Go down the corridor from the junction
between the navigation room and the bridge, and enter the
suit-o-matic. You should now be adorned with metal clothing. Enter
the docking bay, press the Borble and make your way to the docks bay
exit. The huge Debreen outer wall looms to cover the whole entrance
to the docking bay. Use the last unit of power from your laserpen
to cut a hole in the weak part of the wall. Enter the newly created
hole and find yourself in a small alcove. Move to the automatic
doors and enter. In this long corridor, and at the foot of the door
you have just emerged is a small green device. Kick this device to
brake it. A small magnet will come loose, which you must collect.
Now continue down the corridor and have a chat with the robot
sitting in the tubing.
</P>

<H3>THE ELECTRIC LADDER</H3>

<P>
If you continue to the far left of this corridor and enter the door,
you will find a room with a very tasty ladder. Unfortunately, when
you climb it you will get stunned. Kick the panel below the slot
and look inside. The lever is too far so we need to reach it
somehow. Go to the next room at the end of the next corridor along,
and find the corpse of a dead alien explorer. On its remains are
some gloves and a belt. Take both, and then use the magnet on the
belt to form a magnet on a string style tool. Return to the cracked
panel and fish out the lever. Use this lever on the slot to
deactivate the defences of the zone. This includes the power supply
to the ladder!
</P>

<H3>THE TURRET</H3>

<P>
Ascending the ladder to the top will reveal that the Debreen craft
has been welded to the hull of an altogether different ship. This
new area is guarded with a trained laser turret, the walls are
clearly made of heat resisting material, where the floor is not and
is falling apart. Try and get to the door, and you'll get zapped
and fall to the bottom of the ladders. Don't worry, the spacesuit
is designed for such impacts. You will find it very difficult to
come to harm. Half way up the ladder you will find an alcove with
an empty energy cell. Take this from the wall and climb the ladder.
Show this energy cell to the turret and it will rather casually fire
at it, er, and you. When you regain your bearings, at the bottom of
the ladder, the energy cell will be on the floor next to you, FULL!
Return the energy cell to its socket, and you should have stabilized
the laser turret, and its mode will change to 'peace' green. Open
the newly available door, and enter.
</P>

<H3>METAL HELL</H3>

<P>
Again, a third ship has been welded to this Debreen junk-heap, but
due to a misscalculation, the floor was placed thirty-feet lower
than would have been ideal. Falcon falls and destroys the only
mobile robot in the complex when he lands IN IT! When the dust
settles, rip the pipe off the wall and enter the open door to the
right. In this dark room, take the Optiwire and container hidden in
the junk, use the pipe to crowbar open the dome to steal the brain
of the robot. Have a pleasant chat with the active immobile robot,
then nick his arm. Exit this spooky place and return to the first
metal room. Use the pipe to crowbar open the door and enter. Have
a chat with the guard robot, and when he starts to bore you enter
the adjoining open door. take the tape from the dispenser and have
a look at the dome. It needs repairing. Use the tape on the
optiwire to make a strong sticky wire. You can use this strong
sticky wire to reconnect the leads leading to the dome. Return to
the guard room and inform the robot he can have a break, but alas he
has not moved for so long he has rusted. Come to the rescue and
return to the first metal room. use the container to collect the
oil from the right wall, and give this to the guard robot. He will
squeek his way to the rest room for a very long vacation. Use the
robot arm you stole from the secuirty robot to activate the palm
scanner near the gold door. The doors will open and you can enter.
Inside, a brainy blob on a pillar greets you with kind words. Give
him the brain you took from the other robot and accept his advice,
and return to the first metal room. Try using the laserpen on the
metal door on the north wall. The effort was hopeful, but you will
see your efforts fail. Return to the blob with this news and he
will replicate a device which will enable you to charge your
laserpen to full power. By returning to the metal door, and firing
the laser, you realise doing so would be dangerous. The shiny
surface would reflect the laser. Return to the guard room and laser
open a panel hidden in a slight indent on the north wall. Take the
sandpaper like substance and use it on the door to make it rough.
Now fire the laserpen to gain access to the next segment of the
Debreen vessel.
</P>

<H3>THE HUAMIN CONFLICT</H3>

<P>
An opportunity to relax and enjoy the comic lunacy of two crazy
alien ghostlings. Simply take the spangley object from the wall in
the left room from where you entered the maze, and continually talk
from one alien to the other, twisting the facts and conveying
mis-information to your new alien friends. Eventually they will
destroy each other in an invisible fight to the death. As the
ghostlings disappear, so will the obstruction and you can use the
spangley key object on the floor of the room with the eye. The eye
will scan you and the door will open, awaiting your eager entry.
</P>

<H3>DESTINATION DEBREEN</H3>

<P>
Cross the spacewalk to the large doors and talk to the small sphere
set into the door. The centurion will not open the doors. Go to
the right and take the pole from the twisted piping. Go to the far
left and have a look at the junction box. Try using the pipe you
collected from the metal room to pull it off the wall and it will
break under the pressure. Now try the much stronger space metal of
the Debreen, and watch the junction box fall off the wall with ease.
When you return to the gate, a maintenance robot is busy finding the
error, whicn you recently created. He has had to open a small door
to get partly outside, and you get leap into the gap without the
centurion looking. Once inside, make your way through the sandy
corridors until you reach a room with a crater, and a metalic object
imbedded in the ground. Look for a button different from the rest
and press it. The Debreen will be brought from stasis, and revived.
Unfortunately, you have left the space-port open and have let out
all the special air the Debreen need to breath. He is slowly
pleading for his life, so you must quiz him on how exactly to close
the door and return to the port you entered. Find the hidden button
by walking around the port-entrance and then press it. Return to
the crater room and follow the Debreen into the newly revealed
secret door to the his control center.
<P>

</P>
When you enter the room, a large wall mounted display shows in vivid
detail the evil sight a Medivian Nose. The nose, horrifically,
being firmly attatched to a battleship and in the mood for
destruction. It fires three plasma bolts simultaniously and rocks
the entire Debreen vessel. Talk to the Debreen and assess your
situation, and reassess it! Exit his patient abode, and continue
right until you cannot progress any further. Find the hidden door,
and open it. Inside, you will find a garbage bat, which opens in
the barren void of space. You can also see the real, unmagnified
Medivian ship floating about. Take the green orb from the garbage
bay power system and place it in the small Deldroneye Weapon on the
floor. Using the small pressure socket, the green orb will slot
into place, and then run back to the Debreen Control Center. Ask
the Debreen to activate the Garbage system and it will activate,
instead, the powerful Deldroneye laser.
</P>

<P>
And as the passive Debreen seemed about to refuse the request, and
in a language Falcon understood well, the strange creature said,
"OK... Let's Fry'em!". No sooner had Falcons amusement formed a
grin wider than his own face, the Deldroneye laser was ripping
across the small distance to the Medivian ship.
</P>

<P>
The rest of the story opened Falcons eyes to further truths about
the Relics Of Deldroneye, but you'll just have to complete the game
and read THAT for yourself.
