<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
Play the military droid and lose. Then set the options to the
following:
</P>

<P>
Difficulty - Hard<BR>
Timer - Off<BR>
Bouts - 7<BR>
Cinematics - On<BR>
Shadows - On<BR>
Screen Shake - On
</P>

<P>
Now select two players, and on the handicap screen push left so
that the red bar moves about quarter into the player one side and
back again about six times until the screen flashes. After this
has happened, cycle through the opponents and after the sentry
droid, there she'll be. Player two can now play as her, with
special moves being; down, towards, up, for a mutation, or; down,
back, and up, quickly, to melt and reform.
