<P>
This cheat is recommended for intermidiate level computer users
only. If you don't know what the cheat is talking about don't
try it.
</P>

<P>
Find a car you want, but cant afford. Now, leave the game. Find
the name of the car you want and .txt, so if you wanted an Escort,
you would find Escort.txt. Now use a text editor (I use TXED) and
find a number (at the beginning). It should look something like
00000012345. Now, replace the places where the 12345 # is and put
0s in there place. Now just leave a trailing 1. Now the car will
cost all of $10. This is not only a way to get the car you want,
but makes it cheaper to just buy a new car each time instead of
refueling/fixing dammage.
