<DT>Stage 2:
<DD>When you are back in camp again, walk to the bottom left. There
is a black shed here. Throw knives at it from the bottom and the
POWs will be released. Now go back to your helicopter.
<DT>Stage 3:
<DD>Have another joystick in port 1 and pull it back while pushing the
other one forward. This makes your chopper fly faster. A word of
warning - don't let go!
