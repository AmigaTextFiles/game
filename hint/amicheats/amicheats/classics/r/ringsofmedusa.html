<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Far away there is a mysterious kingdom where the land blooms and
prospers and life is peaceful. But one day things begin to change.
Gradually the people become subject to an evil force. Revolts and
wars afflict them, and the once united realm splits into factions.
The king discovers that the evil goddess Medusa is attempting to win
his subjects into her power. She will stop at nothing to conquer and
rule the entire empire with her diabolical armies. You, the young
prince, see how your father's once so peaceful realm is being
destroyed. Your only thought is to stop the goddess Medusa and
reunite the kingdom. Challenge Medusa: find five hidden rings in the
kingdom and place them together in the temple of the Athenians. It
is your only chance to call Medusa to battle. Your mission is not
easy. Only your will for peace and your courage will accompany you.
