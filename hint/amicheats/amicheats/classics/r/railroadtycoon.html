<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
In Sid Meier's Railroad Tycoon, feel the pride and excitement of
creating an industrial empire in the Golden Age of Railroads.
Explore and develop new markets in the U.S. and Europe. Stay
up-to-date with locomotive technology. Compete against rail barrons
eager to crush you or brush you from their path.
</P>

<H2>CHEATS</H2>

<P>
Hold down the 'SHIFT' key and 'Y' key for lots of extra money.
(stop at 32,000,000)
</P>

<P>
To increase your cash balance by $500,000, enter the 'F1' screen.
Hold down the 'SHIFT' key and hold down the '4' key to produce a
dollar sign. You'll immediately inherit lots of money. Apparently
this only works from the main continent screen.

<H2>TIPS</H2>

<H3>WORKING ON THE RAILROAD GUIDE</H3>

<OL>
<LI>Start game in western USA, the easiest theatre.
<LI>Find two towns on the coast that are close together and have
harbours.
<LI>Build the first station at the town you are most likely to build
from again in the future. Then build the second station.
<LI>Select the Map level 'F2' so that you can see with ease what
supplies needs to be picked up.
<LI>Build a train with one mail and one passenger car.
<LI>Once you have enough money, start to improve your stations with
the following extras: post office, hotel, switching yard and
restaurant.
<LI>Repeat steps 01-06 when deveoping new lines and stations.
<LI>When you can afford it, buy 10,00 shares of your own treasury
stock. This helps to prevent other railroads from buying you out.
<LI>Its a good idea to build from cost to cost as you get a $100,000
bonus for building a transcontinental railway.
<LI>If you do well enough to exceed station limit and you find that
you can't expand anymore or your status stops increasing, try and
take over an enemy railroad. This is not an easy task, but if you
have enough money in the bank ($5,000,000 should be enough) you can
usually do it. The best railway to take over is the one that hasn't
bought much of its own stock - 20,000 shares at the most.
<LI>Buy-outs mean you have to be very fast and alert. Call your
broker and buy 10,000 shares of your target's stock. As soon as you
go back to the map, call the broker again and repeat the process
until you have 60% of his stock (make sure he doesn't have enough
money to block you out). If he has to sell a $500,000 bond then you
should be able to take him out.
<LI>Depending on the level of play you can take out 2 or 3 other
rail roads.
<LI>When you have done all of this you should be offered the top job
for your theatre. In the unlikely event that this doesn't happen,
you should start to make new railroads, build new stations and make
union stations between your railroad and the railroads you have
taken over.
</OL>

<H3>ON THE RIGHT TRACKS</H3>

<P>
Here are a few things to keep on your mind as you build your line:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>Rivers are key factors in evaluating where to build initially
and where to expand. The cost of building bridges and the danger of
washouts is significant. New York is a difficult location on the
map, due largely to the layout of the rivers. Rivers are less
troublesome in the Western US since they tend to flow east-west more
than north-south. England is least affected by rivers.
<LI>Ferries can be a great way to do an end run around a competitor.
Build the ferry line around the blocking position, then run down to
a city 'behind enemy lines'. Build a station with an engine house
and you're ready to start a second railroad. Don't forget to tear
up the ferry line to get a lot of your construction money back.
<LI>Mountains are a major issue in the eastern and western US. In
the eastern US you have to deal with the mountains early on (about
one third of the way across the map). Since you reach the mountains
early, you tend to have weaker locomotives, which makes the
mountains more of a problem. How you deal with the mountain
question in the eastern US is often a make or break decision
(especially as you're building on the northern half of the map). In
the western US you dont hit the mountains until you are two-thirds
across (assuming you're playing an east-to-west game). You have
more time to build up cash for assaulting the mountains than in the
eastern US. Since the exact shape of the mountainous region varies
from game to game, the location of optimal mountain passes changes
each game. The outlines of the land, the rivers and the locations
of cities remain the same in all four scenarios.
</UL>

<H3>TRACK BUILDING TECHNIQUES</H3>

<P>
When laying track into a specific area such as a city or a river
that has to be bridged, it's important to plan each square in
advance so you gain the best combination of efficiency and econemy
with those builds. Consequently, it's best to pause your track
laying as you approaching the area and study the lay of the land.
Some people use graph paper to sketch a solution, but a better idea
is to hit 'F10' to survey the area. A number will appear in the
centre of each square. When you move the cursor over these squares,
the numbers will disappear. This way you can try various layouts
until you find one that works.
</P>

<P>
There are some standard techniques to use when building Y's and
main-line interchanges. A standard Y will require two signal
towers. A standard main-line interchange will require three signal
towers. A semi-double track is designed to be used by two trains
that will travel at more or less the same speed.
