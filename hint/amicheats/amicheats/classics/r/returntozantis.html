<H3>THE STORY OF ZANTIS</H3>

<P>
Days before Falcons encounter with the strange vessel far from
planet Deldronis, the planet town Zantis was effected by a strange
silence. For centuries, the town had fallen under the protection of
the secret gang of aliens known as the Spam Syndicate. But for a few
days, the town of Zantis errupted into a place of continual crime.
The leader of the Syndicate had been stolen, and news travelled fast
in Zantis.
</P>

<P>
Falcon, summoned by the acting leader of the syndicate, was given
the honourable task of finding their leader and restoring peace to
the planet. No easy task for an exiled explorer with no money, no
weapon and only a six-foot lady frog as a friend.
</P>

<P>
Leaving the port, Falcon ventured to the only 'safe' taverno in the
town, Errosons Place. A tough joint at the best of times, but it too
had been overcome by the uncommon silence. The metal barkeep was
little help, who maintained that most of Falcons problems could be
solved without resorting to drink. Not that the barkeep had any
drink to vend.
</P>

<P>
Leaving none the wiser, aside from recounting the Tavernos wide
selection of chocolate, Falcon made his way down a side alley and
through a not-very-well hidden door to the syndicate. The stand-in
leader began the rantings of a clearly unstable mind, and confirming
that the situation was grave.
</P>

<P>
Falcon left quickly, and searched the town for anything that may
provide a clue to the whereabouts of the missing leader. An alien
trader had some information, and quite a few suspicous items to
sell. The information was useful, but the set of transporter cards
he produced would prove to be most helpful. In trade for the cards,
the alien would accept shells as payment. But finding two shells in
a potential warzone was clearly going to be difficult.
</P>

<P>
The first shell was obtained by bribing an old tramp on a beach to
reveal the hiding place of his treasured shell. Chocolate seemed to
be his weakness, and ate ravenously. The chocolate was mighty
expensive and Falcon made a mental note to ask the barkeep why they
cost so much. The shell produced a less that ideal trade, as the
card, when used on the hotel transporter unit, put Falcon in a small
room with a door leading back to the hotel street.
</P>

<P>
It was however fortunate in that Falcon found a rather handy
crowbar. A crowbar which would later open a sealed crate, revealing
a handy device for scooping meat. In turn the scoop proved even more
handy when eating live crab. The end result, of course, being after
the meal all you had was a shell. And the value of shells on Zantis,
at least for Falcon, was now very very agreeable. After cleaning the
shell in the ocean, to disguise it's recent status, Falcon used the
shell to trade for a second card.
</P>

<P>
This card placed Falcon at the entrance to a locked science lab.
Falcon was about to give up. Throw himself in the ocean and return
to the green slime of his youth, when the beach begger mumbled
something with reference to Falcons plight. After a short
conversation with the begger, and further exchange of the chocolate
cash, the begger revealed he used to work as a maintenance
technician. A maintenance card and a key where gladly handed over.
</P>

<P>
The key was able quite easily to open the lock of the science lab,
and inside lay the quivering green blob that was the syndicate
leader. His brain was being sucked out and deposited in some huge
glass computer, or so it seemed to Falcon. With stuttered clues from
the leader, and consultation with the acting leader back at the main
headquarters, Falcon retrieved something to restore the brain of the
endangered leader. A small triangular brain disk, hidden many years
earlier in a disused panel of the Virtual Timetable machine.
</P>

<P>
Falcon used the maintenance card he took from the begger to bypass
the access port to the panel, and used the brain disk in the glass
computer to restore the leader to his usual diplomatic self.
</P>

<P>
Immediately, the leader gave a skeptor to Falcon, for fear of his
captor. The skeptor could only be handled by the permitted holder.
Anyone else would be viciously eliminated by its power, and now
Falcon controlled a power equal to that of the ancient Deldroneye
and Medivian Empires combined. How on earth the kidnapper could have
subdued the leader and brain-washed him before this power could be
used was and remained to be a mystery to Falcon.
</P>

<P>
As Falcon left to track this captor, a snakelike figure blocked his
escape and declared himself to be the kidnapper. Not realising
Falcon had the power of the Skeptor, the large captor
ritualistically hurled friendly abuse and pathetic attempts at
goating but all for naught. The kidnapper had lost the moment Falcon
was handed the Skeptor, and soon-after this evil vilan was planted
in a nearby garden for all to ridicule. Such was his punishment.
</P>

<P>
Falcon honourably returned the Skeptor to its rightful owner, and
was in return given a magnificent feast. Rumours circulated openly
that most of the meat in the feast comprised of the slaughtered
leaders of all the rebelious factions responsible for crimes during
the riots. Falcon didn't eat much that day.
</P>

<P>
To complete repayment, as the syndicate termed the gesture, Falcon
was given a full tank of plasmafuel, and a very expensive spaceship
to put it in. A dangerous pair of fluffy dice. And finally, as the
previous owner was a gas lifeform, control systems and chairs where
installed.
</P>

<P>
Falcon bid farewell to his extended family, the syndicate. He knew
this was a relationship he would share to the grave. Criminals they
may have been, but they knew the meaning of honour, and extended
Falcon every courtesy. As Falcon lauched his new ship away from the
planet town Zantis, he reclined slowly as the full weight of his
adventure sunk in. He was on the up again, in a big way.
