<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Novel-sized role-playing adventure in which you work as an agent for
The Foundation to complete 14 missions and find Atlantis. Explore
over 140,000 locations. Digitized voice, 3D scrolling underwater

</P>

<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
If you fail a mission (ie. the mission is terminated and you have
not recieved a "reward" screen) DO NOT return to base or you will
lose all the health points spent on the current assignment.
Re-boot your computer and play the assignment again, so you will
be able to keep those precious experience points each time you
re-play the assignment.
