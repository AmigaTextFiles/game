<H2>GENERAL HINTS</H2>

<OL>
<LI>Shoot as many of the buildings as you can, as they block your
shots at attacking/hiding enemies.
<LI>Shoot the enemies at the bottom of the screen as the bullets
they fire needless time to get to you and can often trap you in
a corner.
<LI>Don't forget that you can shoot the enemies' bullets!
<LI>Try to pick up the bonuses straight away. The 100, 200 and 300
point bonuses are very useful if you want extra lives.
<LI>Collect special weapons straight away as their rapid fire
removes buildings faster, giving more breathing space.
<LI>The grey uniformed soldiers (the ones that take a few shots to
kill) can give a grenade or a special weapon. When he does, two
men carrying a stretcher will appear. Shoot these and they
will give you two grenades, collect them and then shoot them
again before they go, to receive two more grenades.
<LI>Never stay in corners for too long, the enemy has a habit of
zeroing in on you.
<LI>Don't waste grenades on buildings unless you really need to.
If you opt to shoot in small bursts at every building rather
than concentrating on one building at a time then a grenade may
finish the job a lot quicker.
<LI>Try not to get killed when the end-level guardians appear
otherwise your FOE meter will drop to zero and you'll have to
start again.
