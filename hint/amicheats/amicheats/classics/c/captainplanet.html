<H2>CHEATS</H2>

<P>
For this cheat you will need a copy of CAPTIVE. Load the game as per
usual. On the level selection screen, insert your Captive disc.
Press Fire and the screen will say "Disk Error". Now replace your
Captain Planet disc and the cheat will be active.
</P>

<P>
Complete the fire level and get killed on the water level. Now on
the high score table, enter "BBBB" for your name. This will give
you infinite continues.
</P>

<P>  
Run through the game as normal until you get to the level selection
page. Now type in "GO PLANET". Now, when the game starts hit 
'F10' and 'RETURN' together, and you should be taken back to the
level selection page, where you can choose any level.
</P>

<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
On the Heart level, after climbing the trees and killing the
beasties, you will be ready to enter the Eco-Copter. Next to the
Eco-Copter, you will see a tunnel going down to where you just came
from. Go down the tunnel and manoeuvre your way to the bottom
(avoiding the trees on the way). You will then find a bird. Land on
its back and you will gain 5000 points and an extra life.
</P>

<P>
On the fifth level, first of all you have to get rid of all the
toxic cans. When you get to the Eco-Copter, follow the slope (where
the boulders have been rolled) until you find some pit-ponies. Take
them up to where you came out and drop them into the field. This
should get you much closer to the end of the level.
