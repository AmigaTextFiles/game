<P>
Start the game, then hold the left mouse button, fire button, and
type "GROWLER". Now you can use the following keys:
</P>

<P>
'T' ------ full time<BR>
'N' ------ skip levels<BR>
'SPACE' -- (before car starts) for top speed of 900 km/h<BR>
'Z', 'X' - make your steering easier
</P>

<P>
Also after Nancy has told you about the car you are after, keep
pressing the 'SPACE BAR' repeatedly very fast until the game comes on.
Your car should be doing over a 1000 KMH. Before each new level
finishes talking, hit space and use a free nitro.
