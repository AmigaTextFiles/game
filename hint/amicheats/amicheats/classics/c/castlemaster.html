<H2>HINTS</H2>

<P>
There are 27 sprites including the dragon. These must be destroyed
before the Magister can be killed.
</P>

<P>
Maximum health is 12 weights (6 on each side) = Herculean
</P>

<P>
Lifting weights in the gymnasium increases your health.
</P>

<P>
Standing in hospital cures you up to normal health.
</P>

<P>
The spirit in the courtyard will only appear when a rock is thrown
at the flag.
</P>

<P>
To enter the junk room, fire at the plate (on the left of the door),
until it disappears, enabling the door to be opened.
</P>

<P>
To kill the dragon, shoot eyes, teeth and horns, until they
disappear.
</P>

<P>
To kill the Magister, shoot at his head (not eyes).
</P>

<P>
To confront the dragon, start on level 4 in the SW tower. Enter onto
the ballroom balcony, there is a break next to the last door, drop
down, and commence along the south passage.
</P>

<P>
To find the Magister, go to the SE tower and press the button in the
king's solar on level 4. Then reach across the second barrier in the
corridor, and activate the crank. Go round to the south passage (the
long way) and you will be able to enter the Magister's room.
</P>

<P>
A final piece of treasure appears on the table in the wizard's hut
after the key has been collected from the chapel roof. Use rock
travel to transport yourself from window in the gymnasium to the
wizard's hut, then collect treasure and transport back.
</P>

<P>
The key on the chapel roof can be difficalt to get hold of if you
don't know how to get up there. All you have to do is stand on the
drawbridge and close it. You will then be lifted up, making it
easyto get hold of the prize.
</P>

<P>
When trying to collect the pentacles in the caverns, fall down one
of the trap doors and kill the spirit. Collect the first pentacle
then go to the other caverns collecting the pentacles and killing
the spirits. This will make the going easier if you fall into a
cavern, since you're saved the hassle of tackling a spirit that
catches you unawares.
</P>

<P>
To get inside the display chamber, crawl inside the granary chest
and close the lid. Access is then as easy as falling off a rather
wobbly chair perched precariously perched on the top of a table.
</P>

<P>
Collecting the pentacle in the junk room isn't as obvious as it
seems. When you enter the room, crouch down, walk over the first
shelf and into the wall and stand up. Now do a U-turn and walk
forward to collect the item.
</P>

<P>
To move the big rock or open the pottery door, you need to have
maximum strength. If you haven't then fiund some food to top up your
energy then try again.
</P>

<P>
If you have the rock travel potion, you can get to the gymnasium
either from the Wizard's hut or from directly outside. If you're
having trouble finding the spirit in the dungeon, then try looking
for something else rather than the obvious. Still stuck? Well try
that rat-like animal at the back of the room...
</P>

<P>
Now for the big baddy himself. To kill Magister, the evil owner of
the castle, wipe out all the other spirits first. Now go to his room
and blast him in the forehead to destroy him.
</P>
