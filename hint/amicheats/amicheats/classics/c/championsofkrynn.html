<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Champions Of Krynn is the first AD&D fantasy role-playing computer
game to be set in TSR, Inc.'s most popular AD&D game world, the
DRAGONLACE world. The player guides a party of characters (up to
six player characters and two non-player characters) through a web of
intrigue and combat. Player characters include kenders and Knights
of Solamnia as well as most races and classes of characters from the
best-selling DRAGONLACE novels - Tanis, tasselhoff, and Caramon - as
they struggle to overcome the forces of evil. New features include
five different difficulty levels, moons with phases, and gods that
grant special abilities to their clerics. A special four color poster
featuring an original TSR painting is also included in the game.
