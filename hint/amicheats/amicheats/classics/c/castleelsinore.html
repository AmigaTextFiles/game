<P>
Any * following the object means that the object is a treasure. All
of them would give you bonus 5 points if deposited at the town hall.
Some of them could be used for other purposed. Unless described,
they are just treasures.
</P>

<P>
If the items you carry are already full, you might then deposit all
treasures in the town hall.
</P>

<P>
Seashore: Search from north end to south end of sea shore. You would
find a heavy ball and a rod.
</P>

<P>
Village: Exits are possible in all direction. Get waterpump, string,
sickle and document from locations around it. Town hall where you
deposit your treasure (for full credit) is located northwest from
this village square.
</P>

<P>
The churchyard is south of the village. In one of the yard there is
a freshly dug grave and a human skull. Get the skull.
</P>

<P>
Go seashore, tie string to rod, fish. Get coral*.
</P>

<P>
Go to bridge, west to oak tree, climb tree. With the sickle, cut the
mistletoe. Down and get the mistletoe.
</P>

<P>
Go forest, explore until you come up to the witch's camp. Get the
broom. Fly, south, south and there is a large circle. If you have
the mistletoe with you, you could pass the wraith there. Get the
emerald*, back to the arrival point, fly back.
</P>

<P>
Go to church's tower, ring the bell. Go to sea, wait until a huge
monster come. Follow it. The monster will go up the river, to the
churchyard (south of the freshly dug grave) and then bite the
tower's bell and tear up the tower's side revealing a downward
passage. In there you would find a Nordic idol*.
</P>

<P>
Get document, go castle. (The document is the pass)
</P>

<P>
Scattered in castle first level are: gold cross*, two yarns (one is
in linen storage and the other is in servant room), book, rug*,
statue* and oil lantern (your only light source).
</P>

<P>
Two events might happen here:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>If you newly entered the castle, a young page came and offered a
sword. Take it to defend yourself against the fighters in the
castle.
<LI>Sometime, a seaman come and steal your treasure. Let him do it.
You won't lose it. After all, this is the only way you could get his
only treasure.
</UL>

<P>
There is a large bulge behind a curtain in one of the room in first
level castle. Kill the bulge (A sort of thief is behind it), get the
crown*. You could bury the dead body in the churchyard's grave to
get additional treasure: jewel trinket*.
</P>

<P>
Scullery (south of kitchen): Go down the staircase. If you explore
the maze there, you would find a nordic pin* and an antique key (in
wine cellar).
</P>

<P>
A fountain west outside of castle: Empty it with the waterpump. Get
the coin*.
</P>

<P>
Queen's chamber: give yarn to queen and she would allow you to go to
her bedroom. Get diamond* there.
</P>

<P>
Tower: Give a young and pretty girl the book to calm her. You could
then go south. Get an oil painting* from there.
</P>

<P>
Ghost room: give crown* to ghost (That's what he wants). To pass the
barred door, load cannon with the iron ball, turn cannon and fire
the cannon. Pass the shattered door, get ruby*. The scholar? I don't
know yet.
</P>

<P>
King's chamber: Turn the bust (The bookcase slides away revealing a
passage) In there, you would find an ornate clock* and prince
chamber.
</P>

<P>
Prince chamber: Give the skull to him. In east door, there is a
vase*. In north door (unlock it first), there is a necklace*.
</P>

<P>
Room with three levers: Pull iron lever, north and get the jade*,
pull the bronze lever (A trapdoor open), break door, and find your
way to the sea shore. Now climb up the cliff, take the south trail
and follow it until you come to the smuggler's cave. Enter the cave.
In there you would find all your stolen treasures. In addition, you
would find the pirate's treasure, a jewel chest*. 1602 would bring
you back to the castle (A short-cut).
</P>

<P>
The cat: If you have the emerald* and ruby* (They are the size of
eye), give them to it. The cat would give you back an ancient
mouse*.
</P>

<P>
Once you completed collected all treasures, you had a very little
time to reach the townhall and deposit all your treasures there
before you are transported to an astral plane. Find your way here
and upon encountering an engraving letter 'OTTFFS???' on a surface,
respond with 'ENT' (One Two Three Four Five Six Seven Eight Nine
Ten). A door to south appears. Enter it. Put the sword on the altar
(A sword picture is on the altar). Exit. Now, everything is changed.
There is a riddle here. The answer is moon. North, and strive
yourself to east to meet the lady of moon.
