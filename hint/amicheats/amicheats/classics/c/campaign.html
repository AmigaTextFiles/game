<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
A war games simulator designed with 20th centery warfare in mind.
Set in Germany during WWII years 1939-1945. You control the
movements of over 100 different vehicles and 15 guns. Plan battles
using local factories, and supply convoys and airforce support.
Quad-tree system for storing maps allows maps up to 2000 miles
square.
</P>

<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
If you find yourself with light tanks facing up to much heavier
opposition on the simulator, use your speed and ram the enemy.
Then fully depress your gun and open fire, it only takes a few
rounds to obliterate your enemy (easier from side or rear).
