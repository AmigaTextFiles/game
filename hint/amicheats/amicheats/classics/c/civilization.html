<P>
When building things with settlers. Give the settler a command like
'r' for building a road. Then select the settler again with the
mouse. An information box about the unit will appear. Click this
box with the mouse and the settlers will start blinking. Now repeat
the command and selecting the info box until the road is complete.
This works with all settler commands like 'p' to clean pollution,
'm' to build a mine, etc... and allows you to build any item in a
single turn. Once the item is built selecting the info box will no
longer result in the settlers blinking and being selected.

Also on early ECS versions pressing 'SHIFT' and '1234567890T' lets

<H2>TIPS</H2>

<H3>YOUR FIRST MILLENNIUM</H3>

<UL>
<LI>Put down roots quickly. Your first city doesn't have to have
the world's greatest location: Better to get it up and running,
pumping out new units and improvements, than to lose valuable time.

<LI>Pursue writing before other cultural advances. No matter where
you start - island or continent - the development of writing lays
the groundwork for enhancing and expanding an exuberant intellectual
culture composed of libraries, universities, and intellectual
Wonders of the World which will serve your long-term goals on more
levels than any other development in the game.

<LI>Decide as quikly as you can what type of game you are going to
play. If you are going to pursue world conquest, for example, you
should begin building your armies and assembling your resources
before the first millennium ends. If you're going to play a game of
peaceful expansion and consolidation, you should shore up your
homeland's defenses against those enemies less benevolent than
yourself.

<LI>Multiply, multiply, multiply! The race in Civilization often
goes to the most fecund. By the end of your first millennia you
should have at least three cities functioning and growing, with more
on the way.

<LI>Because reproduction and creation of new cities is so important,
don't spend valuable settler time developing every square around a
city. You can create additional settlers to do that later. Do
enough development to get the city on sound economic footing, then
move on to start another community.

<LI>Place defensive perimeters around your emerging civilization.
Expand those perimeters as your civilization grows.

<LI>Build roads as you can afford the commitment of settlers. Not
only do the roads increase your productivity, they also lay the
groundwork - roadwork, as it were - for the rapid movement of forces
should you be invaded.

<LI>Put one city to work building a Wonder of the World as early as
possible. The addition of wonders does much to boost your score,
yet if you wait too long to create them, they may be acquired by
other civilizations.

<LI>Develop pottery by all means. You must have granaries if you
are to hold any hope at all of increasing your population and
growing your cities.

<LI>Be prepared to shift strategies: The road to failure is paved,
sometimes, with peaceful intentions, and not every would-be
conquerer can actually manage to conquer. Play with the flow of the
game, not against it.

<LI>Alternate your cities' labor force between agriculture and
resource development until the population is large enough to attend
to both. Agriculture results in increased population; resource
production boosts your treasury.
</UL>

<H3>YOUR FIRST CITY</H3>

<UL>
<LI>Generally speaking, you should build a militia unit and fortify
it immediately, then two more for exploration, before building
additional settlers, military units, or city imporvements. (If it
quickly becomes clear that your civilization is located on an
island, perhaps a single explorer is sufficent.)

<LI>Do not put off the construction of your barracks improvement.
Only with the establishment of a barracks can you produce veteran
military units that are strong enough to face the test of combat.

<LI>Don't forget to upgrade your defensive units once the barracks
is completed. Units such as militia that were created before the
barracks can then be used for exploration or disbanded.

<LI>Should the spiritual side of civilization become available to
you, put a temple in your first city. Establish the people's
happiness early on, and it's easier to maintain it as the game grows
more complex.

<LI>If your civilization is surrounded by other, stronger ones,
build city walls. Although expensive in construction and
maintenance, the walls amplify your defense force's ability to
withstand attack, perhaps buying you enough time to prepare a
militray response or seek a treaty.

<LI>Develop at least two agricultural and one resource square before
moving too far from your first city. These squares will give the
city time to feed itself and generate enough income to grow during
the early phases of the game.

<LI>Study the local terrain. If you've put down roots too quickly,
and find yourself in a less-than-ideal spot for long-term growth,
don't be afraid to move your capitol to a more fertile site once one
becomes available. (Don't move too quickly, though: Make sure the
new city is well established, defended, and growing before
relocating your government there.)

<LI>Concentrate on population at least two turns out of three: Your
goal is to have a civilization-wide population of at least one
million by the year 1 A.D.

<LI>Build a marketplace as soon as that improvement becomes
available. Better yet, buy the improvement. The increase in
revenue will repay the expenditure very quickly.
</UL>

<H3>YOUR FIRST ENCOUNTER WITH OTHERS</H3>

<UL>
<LI>Always accept the first treaty offer upon initial contact with
another civilization. It costs you nothing, and gives you time to
gather your resources, marshal your forces, and prepare a more
considered, and perhaps antagonistic, relationship with the other
civilization.

<LI>The treaty established, use your militia to hold enemy expansion
in check, positioning your units carefully, and fortifying them
against enemy sneak attack. Use militia because they are easily and
quickly produced, freeing your cities to concentrate the bulk of
their productive time on more important units, city improvements,
Wonders of the World, or civilization advances.

<LI>Have some backup for your border guards, especially if your
guards are militia or diplomats, whose defensive factors are low.
Stronger offensive units in reserve close to the border, or able to
reach the border quickly, can make the difference between a
successful enemy invasion and one that's turned back.

<LI>Once you've established a treaty with a neighboring tribe, get
some diplomats into enemy territory as quickly as you can. During
the treaty's tenure, your diplomats - and caravans, if you can
produce them - enjoy essentially unlimited freedom of movement
through enemy territory. This gives you the chance to obtain a good
portrait of the interior of your neighbor, learning whether he is
strongr or weaker than you.

<LI>If you encounter an enemy at sea, try to follow his vessels back
to their homeland, particularly if both of you are in triremes. The
enemy may already have mapped the shortest paths between landmasses,
saving you valuable exploration time.

<LI>Send caravans into enemy territory even if you plan ultimately
to wipe the enemy from the face of the planet. Earn income while
you can!

<LI>Use your ships to blockade - or observe - enemy ports. If
you're playing for world domination, you'll want to contain the
enemy to a single landmass. If taking a more peaceful approach, the
presence of your ships will allow you to "shadow" the other
civilization's vessels, giving you a good and useful picture of
their expansions.

<LI>Look for natural barriers to enemy expansion - an isthmus, a
large lake - and place defensive units in the only available paths.

<LI>If you can afford the allocation of units, place diplomats on
fortification or sentry duty at various spots within the enemy
civilization. They'll keep you posted of enemy troop and settler
movement.
</UL>

<H3>SECOND CITY</H3>

<UL>
<LI>Build your second city in the most ideal location you can find,
making up for the haste with which your first city was created.

<LI>Put your second city's citizens to work immediately on the
constuction of a barracks and a granary. Defensive forces should
accompany the settler unit from the first city. Move them inside
the new city, reassign them to it, and fortify them. Your new city
is instantly defended.

<LI>Send settlers from your first city to develop the land around
the second while it is busy producing the imporvements it needs.

<LI>If you have the funds, buy the second city's initial
improvements.

<LI>At least one of your first two cities should be a sea port.

<LI>Build a road between your first two cities as quickly as
possible.

<LI>If the enemy lies to the west, consider locating your second
city to the east, minimizing the chance it will be attacked.

<LI>Just as with your first city, establish a defensive perimeter
around your second to stave off barbarians and unwanted neighbors.

<LI>With your first city concentrating its production on units, you
might want to use the second for Wonders of the World, for
educational institutions. Or vice versa.

<LI>Use the unit production of your second city to generate
defensive forces for your third, and so on.
</UL>

<H3>TREATIES AND TRIBUTES</H3>

<UL>
<LI>Don't be afraid to reject entreaties from other civilizations.
They may take your "insolence" as an insult and embark on a war, but
they may also respect your independence and offer a treaty.

<LI>Get to know your neighbors: Some of them can be trusted to
honor their treaties, while others may stay friendly for no more
than a turn or two. The computer leaders built into the game have
distinctive personalities; it will behoove you to be observant as
your civilization and theirs become acquainted.

<LI>Occasionally you'll be asked to join another civilization in an
alliance aimed at yet another civilization. Weigh your response
carefully. It may be that you can strike a more advantageous
alliance elsewhere.

<LI>Think twice beefore paying tribute. Civilizations that demand
payment for peace are unlikely to leave you alone for long. Pay
only when you have no other choice.

<LI>Technology exchanges can be tricky. Your best bet is to
exchange technology only with civilizations more advanced yet weaker
than yours. Giving advances to strong, warmongering neighbors is
foolish.

<LI>Meet with other civilization leaders at least every third time
they request a conference. It's time-consuming, but otherwise your
avoidance is interpreted as a rebuff, and will lead to war.

<LI>Even possession of the United Nations Wonder of the World can't
completely protect you from treaty violations, especially late in
the game. If playing peacefully, initiate negotiations immediately
after the sneak attack; the enemy will offer a treaty. (This, too,
will likely be broken again before the war ends.) If playing a
warlike game, use the time bought by the United Nations to build and
position overwhelming military force of your own; then use it to
crush the enemy.

<LI>Pay attention when an enemy's words are backed by nuclear
weapons. Some of your enemies aren't afraid to use the Bomb, use it
without warning, and use it more than once. Even if your able to
eventually make peace with them, the pollution unleashed may ruin
your score. Your best bet is to wipe out nuclear-powered enemies -
if you can.

<LI>Weave together networks of alliances against strong enemies,
especially early in a game of conquest. By building a league of
weaker nations against stronger ones, you may be able to cut down on
the time required for world conquest, boosting your score.
</UL>

<H3>FINANCIAL TOOLS</H3>

<UL>
<LI>A city without a marketplace is financially and socially
crippled. At higher levels, the same is true of a city without a
bank.

<LI>If you're planning to sell a city improvement - a step that
should be taken in only the most dire of economic cicrcumstances -
do so quickly, before the improvement is rendered obsolete by
technological or social advance. Obsolete improvements can't be
sold.

<LI>Produce plenty of caravans, bearing in mind that each city can
support only three trade routes. Send out caravans from every city.

<LI>The game defaults to the three most valuable trade routes, but
you can waste a lot of time and energy on routes of lesser value
that will later be superseded. Send your caravans to the most
distant and largest foreign cities you can find: These generate the
largest amounts of income.

<LI>The one time you should consider selling city improvements is
just before they become obsolete. The development of gunpowder, for
example, renders barracks improvements obsolete. Since you'll have
to replace your barracks anyway, why not earn some money from the
old ones?

<LI>Another good opportunity to sell off improvements occurs when
you hold an absolute upper hand. Possession of the United Nations
Wonder of the World is a good example. Since your enemies must
offer to make peace with you, you may not need items such as city
walls, particularly those located far away from enemy borders. Sell
off the city walls, earn a fair piece of change, and relieve your
cities of the burden of supporting those walls each turn.

<LI>As you locate new civilizations with new, large cities, dispatch
caravans to establish trading routes. These may be more valuable
than routes already in existence.

<LI>Give your citizens plenty of luxuries. This helps them
appreciate your wisdom, often resulting in "We Love The King" days,
which earn you generous bonuses.

<LI>In the latter days of the game, when some of your cities may be
capable of producing vast engineering works in just a few turns, try
building these works, then selling them as soon as they're
completed. It's impractical advice for the real world, but can
generate lots of cash in the game.

<LI>Monitor the amount your civilization costs in maintenance each
turn, indexing that amount to your cash flow. If your treasury has
grown fat, don't be afraid to spend, spend, spend for improvements
or Wonders. Just keep enough cash in your treasury reserves to
cover half a dozen lean turns or so.

<LI>If you really have a healthy treasury that can cover a few
turns' loss of income, try this: Convert everything to luxury
income for your citizens. They'll reward you with points beyond
your wildest dreams.

<LI>Use caravans to help build Wonders. When a caravan arrives in a
city building a Wonder, you have the option of assigning it's value
to the completion of the Wonder. If you can build enough caravans
quickly, this can hasten completion of the Wonder.

<LI>As your income rises, adjust your taxation level. Boost your
science allocations, leaving enough in tax revenue to cover the cost
of maintenance with minimal growth each turn.

<LI>Trade routes among the cities of your own civilization, no
matter how far apart they're located, are rarely worthwhile.

<LI>Invest in factories and manufacturing plants as you are able to
build them, but create pollution-control corps of engineers (settler
units) to deal with their effluent. You'll need two settler units
per highly industrialized city to keep pollution under control.

<LI>Approaching the space race? Build the largest cash reserves you
can. Only global warfare is more expensive than getting into space.
</UL>

<H3>MILITARY UNITS</H3>

<UL>
<LI>Don't produce too many military units without a barracks.
Veteran units are, essentially, the only ones really worth
producing.

<LI>Develop mathematics as early as you can. This permits the
creeation of catapults, the first real "artillery." Only by
amplifying your abilities through the use of technology - catapults,
gunpowder, flight - can you enjoy an offensive edge.

<LI>Early in the game, use cavalry and chariots to "blitzkrieg" your
way through enemy homelands. Slower-moving units such as catapults
can be brought up later.

<LI>Upgrade your barracks the moment they become obslete, especially
if you are at war. Use your treasury to purchase new barracks in
those cities closest to the front or at the greatest risk of being
overrun.

<LI>Consider fortifying strong defensive units around enemy cities
rather than laying direct assault to those cities, especially if the
city possesses defensive walls or a large number of fortified units.
Seal off the city and starve it slowly with phalanx-level units if
possible.

<LI>Build plenty of seagoing units. Naval power cannot be
under-estimated in the world of Civilization.

<LI>Consider keeping a strong naval unit on sentry duty inside your
own harbors, especially if the war is going poorly. These units can
spring to life from withing the city, attacking enemy vessels which
might bombard your port.

<LI>Use the "go-to" function to place units on patrol, covering
large amounts of territory or sea with minimum input from you.

<LI>Disband military units no longer needed or of unlikely value to
your civilization. Don't forget to disband older defensive units in
cities being garrisoned by more advanced units.

<LI>Keep a strong offensive unit on sentry duty - not fortified -
along with your fortified defensive units in each city. The
offensive unit will "awaken" at the approach of the enemy, and can
attack in some cases before the enemy assault begins.

<LI>Cities susceptible to frequent attack by barbarians might need
more than one offensive sentry either inside or close to the city.
You need to kill the barbarians before they can pillage your
developed countryside.

<LI>Never stack military units in an open terrain. They are far too
vulnerable to being destroyed at a single blow, sometimes by a
less-powerful enemy.

<LI>Blockade harbors with city walls; bombard those without them.

<LI>Especially in the age of transports, when a single vessel can
carry eight units, escort your shipping with cruisers or
battleships. Your advanced military vessels "see" farther than
other units, and can alert you to the presence of enemy warcraft
lying in wait for your convoy.

<LI>An aircraft carrier bearing bombers and fighters makes another
good screening device for convoys.

<LI>Because of their extremely long range, nuclear missles are among
the best advance observers. Launch them from strategically located
cities, or from aircraft carriers, and use them to explore and
observe. Just be sure you leave sufficent moves for the missle to
return to a friendly city or carrier.

<LI>And be careful if you use nuclear missles in the manner
described immediately above. One slip of your typing finger, and
instead of surveillance your missle could unleash holocaust.

<LI>If your information reveals that an intransigently warlike enemy
has developed nuclear weapons, launch a crash SDI building program.
Only SDI can save your cities from nuclear attack.
</UL>

<H3>FEEDING YOUR CIVILIZATION</H3>

<UL>
<LI>A city without a granary grows slowly at best.

<LI>Look for the most efficent routes to follow if bringing
irrigation to your city's enviorns. Don't build more elaborate
irrigation channels than necessary.

<LI>Clear pollution from agricultural squares before other squares.

<LI>Replace granaries immediately should they be destroyed.
Granaries should be replaced before any other structure.

<LI>When laying extended siege, pillage or occupy enemy agricultural
squares, cutting off the city's food supply.

<LI>Take advantage of seafood: Those fish symbols in oceans and
lakes contribute mightily to cities located near them.

<LI>Irrigate oases when you have the chance.

<LI>If your granary is well stocked with foood, consider converting
one or more agriultural squares into forests. Just keep an eye on
food levels after you do so.
</UL>

<H3>WONDERS OF THE WORLD</H3>

<UL>
<LI>The most valuable Wonder of the World of the ancient world is
the Great Library, especially if playing against a large number of
enemy civilizations. You can't beat the boost in knowledge you get
when two of those other civilizations make the same advance.

<LI>The most valuable Wonder of the World of the Middle Ages is
Johann Sebastian Bah's Cathedral, especially if you're ruling a
republic. You can't beat it for generating quite a few "We Love The
King" days, with their concomitant increase in population.

<LI>The most valuable Wonder of the World of the modern world is the
Apollo Program, if you're playing a space race game: Only with
Apollo can you begin building your starship.

<LI>If playing a game of world conquest, the most valuable
latter-day Wonder may well be, ironically enough, the United
Nations. Because this Wonder forces enemy civilizations to
capitulate to you, you can marshal your fores almost at leisure,
gatthering them at critical spots before launching all-out attacks.

<LI>Be warned: Violating one treaty when you possess the United
Nations Wonder seems to violate all of them. When you're ready to
make war, make war on all fronts at once.

<LI>As soon as you have three cities, put one of them - probably
your capitol - to work building a Wonder. The other cities can
produce military and settler units, if need be, that can be
transfered to the capitol to shore up its defenses or further
develop the terrain around the city.

<LI>Use diplomats to seek out Wonder production in the cities of
other civilizations. Then either sabotage that production or target
those cities for capture, and the addition of their Wonders to your
empire.

<LI>If pursuing a peaceful strategy - trying to win through
diplomacy, financial strength, and expansion to the stars, focus
your attention on those Wonders of the World that force your enemies
to sue for peace: The Great Wall and the United Nations.

<LI>If playing a "peacful" game, build as many Wonders of the World
as possible, concentrating on those that boost your citizens'
happiness. Your score will benefit greatly.

<LI>When playing a peaceful game and concentrating on building
Wonders, don't forget that they must be defended. Put plenty of
strong units in and around cities holding Wonders of the World.

<LI>Some Wonders of the World serve all the world: The Apollo
Program is a good example. Use your diplomats to discover whether
other civilizations are further along toward completing global
Wonders of the World than you. If so, devote your resources to
creating something exclusive to your civilization.
</UL>

<H3>CONQUERING</H3>

<UL>
<LI>He who conquers the world fastest conquers the world best: If
playing for global domination, every turn is vital. The sooner you
conquer everyone the more points you get. There's no time to stop
and smell the roses if you want the world at your feet.

<LI>Strike the strongest civilizations first, with as much military
might as you an muster. Use your diplomats sabotage skills to keep
weaker nations weak, for easy destruction after the "big guys" are
gone.

<LI>Coordinate, coordinate, coordinate! Establish a treaty with a
civilization you plan to destroy. Flood the civilization with
diplomats even as you mass your assault forces along its borders.
When you hit, hit all at once, using diplomats for subversion and
sabotage before invading with ground forces. Break the enemy's back
during the first turn of the war.

<LI>If necessary, sell off improvements in your heartland to finance
the final stages of a war on the frontier. Use the funds to subvert
enemy cities first, to bribe enemy units second.
</UL>

<H3>AIRCRAFT</H3>

<UL>
<LI>As soon as you develop aircraft capabilities, begin cranking out
fighters and, later, bombers. Don't wait a single turn: You can't
have too large an air force, particularly in heated games of global
combat.

<LI>Try to garrison a couple of fighters in every city - not just
those near the front. Fighters can respond quickly to enemy
threats, saving you from the dangers of surprise attack, or invasion
from an unexpected direction.

<LI>Your fighters can attack - and keep on attacking. This makes
them especially valuable when you're facing waves of enemy units.
Go for stacked units first, of for transport raft that might be
carrying several units.

<LI>If your resources are running low, don't station your fighters
or bombers too close to the front - in harbors, for example. They
are too vulnerable there to enemy bombardment. Base them a few
squares back in a city or on board a carrier. Then, when enemy
ships or bombers appear, you can fly out to engage them.

<LI>Bombers have as much strategic value in Civilization as they do
in the real world. A squadron of bombers can turn the tide of war,
even against overwhelming odds.

<LI>If you're planning to make war on a civilization with whom you
enjoy treaty status, take advantage of the peace and get your air
force in position to attack. Try to target three bombers for each
city you're planning to hit, more if you can afford it. Attack
stacked units in the open first.

<LI>Don't overlook the surveillance capabilities of your aircraft,
particularly the bombers. Their long range makes them perfect for
exploring the interior of enemy continents and islands.

<LI>Carrier power is ideal for isolating and containing an enemy
island. Position a couple of carriers at either end of the island,
support them with cruisers to guard against enemy ships, and use
them to patrol the enemy coastline.

<LI>Remember the lessons of Desert Storm: Once you've launched an
air war, don't let up.

<LI>Desert Storm Lesson Two: Once the air war has taken its toll,
be sure you have plenty of fast, mobile ground forces in position to
mop up.

<LI>Desert Storm Lesson Three: In this Civilization, you don't have
to stop. If your air power has made it possible for you to roll all
the way over the enemy, do so, assuming that suits your overall
strategic plan.
</UL>

<H3>SEA GOING VESSELS</H3>

<UL>
<LI>Never send a loaded tireme out into uncharted waters. It's one
thing to risk a ship to loss at sea, quite another to risk valuable
units. Chart your course before moving cargo.

<LI>Early on, designate one or two coastal towns as major shipyards.
Manipulate their population and resources so as to be able to
produce ships at a rapid rate. (You should have another seaport
within easy sailing distance, to which newly constructed ships can
be reassigned in order relieve the shipyard of the burden of
support.)

<LI>Build fleets in the major oceans and gulfs, along with seaports
to support and load them. Cut down on the necessity for moving
ships all over the globe.

<LI>As soon as you can build cruisers, battleships, and submarines,
do so - their extended range of view is invaluable for spoting enemy
craft, and equally invaluable for opening up any remaining hidden
areas of the sea.

<LI>Use your advanced naval craft to patrol the coastlines of
unexplored enemy islands and continents. Advanced ships "see" an
adjacent two squares, which can give you a good picture of another
civilization's coastal defenses.

<LI>Don't forget naval power during ground assaults. Look for
isthmuses and narrows through which enemy ground transport must
move. Position a battleship or cruiser on either side of the
landmass and open fire on enemy units stranded in your sights
between turns.

<LI>If bombarding a fortified harbor with a value of nine or higher,
bring at least two warships. You'll likely lose one.

<LI>Transports are worth their weight in gold, not just for mounting
amphibious invasions. Fill your ships with caravans and send them
to all the corners of your world. A successful leader is one whose
merchant fleet is as large as his navy. And your merchant fleet may
be even busier.

<LI>Plot your invasion routes so the transport vessels reach
landfall on the first move of their turn. That lets you move the
ships after debarking some of their forces, spreading your troops
across the broadest possible front.

<LI>Submarines make terrific blockade vessels, but their limited
movement capability all but requires that you keep some fast,
long-ranged cruisers nearby to take their place shoul they be sunk.

<LI>Be careful, early in the game, about building ships before the
immediate area around the harbor is fully explored. You might wind
up with a landlocked tireme stuck in a lake with nowhere to go!
</UL>

<H3>MOVEMENT</H3>

<UL>
<LI>Use the Go-to key only occasionally. While it takes some of the
burden of issuing orders from you, it rarely moves your units along
the most effecient routes, nor does it take full advantage of the
movement benefits offered by rail transportation.

<LI>Pressing H will return your bombers and fighters to the nearest
friendly city or carrier, if the aircraft possess sufficent movement
points.

<LI>Moving through a city costs movement points. Build railways
around cities as well as up to them, letting you conserve movement
points for your units.

<LI>When engaged in a continental war, continue driving rail lines
to the front. It's worth commiting extra settler units to this
task, especially if you're conquering enemy territory at a good
clip.

<LI>Study the world map as it's revealed. Its layout can give you
good guidance in the placement of cities proximate to advantageous
sea routes.

<LI>Look for rail lines along the coasts on newly discovered
continents or islands, or enemy continents or islands you're
visiting. Debark your diplomats and caravans on squares with
railroad track and they'll be able to move farther when the next
turn arrives.

<LI>Centralize your embarkation points for units bound overseas.
The central locations need not be a city. Run a rail line to a
remote area near an advantageous shipping lane. Send the units you
wish to move overseas to that point first, picking them up with your
cargo vessel. Of course, you'll eventually want to put a city
there, and probably should do so sooner than later. It's also smart
to protect such remote loading zones with a ship or two, to prevent
enemy craft from sneaking in and opening fire on your sentried
units.

<LI>Build cities on remote islands to serve as island-hopping
airbases. These need to be the most viable islands for long-term
development, but should be well fortified against enemy assault.
Islands lying just off enemy coastlines make the most valuable
airbases of all.

<LI>Pillage enemy inter-city roads and rail lines if possible during
wartime. Cutting their lines of transport gives you the chance to
catch enemy units in the open, unable to move.

<LI>If forced into a long retreat, pick a spot at which to cut your
own transportation lines. Doing so in the right place can help you
establish a "killing field" where the enemy units will be halted and
vulnerable to your fire.
</UL>

<H3>DIPLOMACY</H3>

<UL>
<LI>The diplomat is arguably the most valuable unit in the game;
certainly it's the most flexible. Produce plenty of diplomats and
send them throughout the world.

<LI>Don't overlook the value of the diplomat as a "place-holder." On
sentry or fortification duty, your diplomat will alert you to the
presence of enemy forces. The advantage is that the diplomat can
attempt to bribe the forces over to your side, if you have the
money.

<LI>Stealing technology violates any treaties in existence between
you and your target. If you have several diplomats traveling inside
enemy territory, make sure all are in a position to make their move
during the same turn. Otherwise you run the risk of losing them to
enemy retaliation.

<LI>If a city looks vulnerable to subversion, try it. Weaker cities
can generally be subverted for less money than wealthier ones.

<LI>Try to get two or three diplomats in position around each of the
enemy's major cities just before you invade. Use the diplomats one
after another to sabotage enemy production and destroy enemy
improvements.

<LI>Don't use diplomats to uncover serendipity squares. They are
too easily wiped out by barbarians.
</UL>

<H3>ENERGY</H3>

<UL>
<LI>In terms of long-term scoring, the best energy sources are those
that pollute the least.

<LI>The game, or its designers, has a built-in bias against nuclear
fission: Be wary of building nuclear plants until you'vre developed
fusion. At the very least, build nuclear plants only in the most
socially stable of cities.

<LI>Build Hoover Dam. This Wonder of the World provides clean power
to your whole continent - and the game defines continent liberally.
</UL>

<H3>RULING</H3>

<UL>
<LI>Better to rule in Hell than serve in Heaven: You may not be
able to be as nice as you want while you play the game.

<LI>Get the Pyramid wonder and alternate your form of government
often, depending on your short-term goals.

<LI>Go for "We Love The King" days, earned by giving your people the
"good life" of luxuries. You'll end up with more people.

<LI>Try a strategy that focuses your attention and production on
cures for cancer, women's sufferage, and other social benefits. You
might be surprised at the effect this has on your people's
willingness to support your choices.
</UL>

<H3>SPACE TRAVEL</H3>

<UL>
<LI>If playing to win by reaching Alpha Centauri first, commit
everything you have to the space race once it begins. Spend the
time waiting for that beginning by building up your perimeter
defenses against attack. Once you've undertaken to build a
starship, you'll need the productive output of every city you can
spare, and you can allow nothing to interefer with that production.

<LI>Since starship modules take longer to build, start them first.
Have at least three cities of roughly equivalent size working on
module production.

<LI>Starship structural pieces are the easiest to build, yet are the
pieces you'll need in largest quantity. Find a couple of cities
that can crank these pieces out and get them going.

<LI>The more propulsion units your starship has, the faster it
reaches Alpha Centauri. The more colonists you attempt to deliver
to Alpha Centauri, the more your starships' weight. Try to install
two propulsion units for every complete colonist package -
habitation, life support, and solar power modules - you intend to
launch.

<LI>Guard your capitol! Losing it brings your interstellar program
to a crashing close.

<LI>Watch the clock. You must reach the Alpha Centauri system
before your reign expires, or all your work is for naught.

<LI>Watch the other civilizations' starship development. If they
launch before you do, you may want to make a mad dash for their
capitol in hopes of capturing it before their starship reaches its
destination.

<LI>Consider selling off some improvements in order to buy more
colonists and life-support modules. The more colonists you deliver
to Alpha Centauri, the higher your score.

<LI>Once your starship is launched, convert all starship-related
production to other ends. After launch, no further starship
production can take place unless your craft is lost or recalled by
the loss of your capitol. Shift your resources and production to
items likely to boost your overall score. Remember, after launch,
the game is counting its way down to the finish line.

<LI>Don't launch unless your arrival time is less than 20 years. If
it's more than that, add more fuel and propulsion units.
