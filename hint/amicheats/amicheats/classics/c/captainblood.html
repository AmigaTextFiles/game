Award-winning visual effects and a revolutionary icon language
transports science-fiction fans to a new dimension in this

dazzling graphics and digitized music and sound.

<H2>CHEATS</H2>

<P>
When you encounter a particularly friendly alien, ask it the
following question using the alien icons "CODE GG1". The alien
will then give you co-ordinates of another alien called GG. Go to
the specified planet and you can then ask GG for the co-ordinates
of all the other aliens around, by asking "CODE INFORMATION HELP"
if that doesn't work, replace 'HELP' with the name of an alien.
