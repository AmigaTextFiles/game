<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Your quest begins in your father's chateau circa 1920, where you
find his latest invention: A fantastic time machine. You are the
prime suspect of your father's murder, but a letter from him leads
you to think he has escaped into the future. You must find fragments
of a magnetic card needed to drive the machine home. Brilliant
graphics, full icon control.
</P>

<H2>SOLVE</H2>

<H3>INTRODUCTION</H3>

<P>
Generally, the game is a good one. The graphics are excellent, the
music is good, and the puzzles are tough but reasonably fair.
However, a few cautionary observations are in order before getting
into the walkthru.
</P>

<P>
We know of no way to read any the scroll or documents in the Amiga
version. This is a particularly unfortunate problem since it gives
some specific instructions which are needed to complete the game.
</P>

<P>
Second, the save/load features are slightly peculiar. The Amiga
version allows for complete installation on a hard disk. While the
disks aren't copy protected, only disks 2 and 3 have hard disk
support -- and _only_ for the root directory of drive "C" (no
folders allowed). It's certainly possible to copy the Boot disk and
Disk 1 to any place you wish, but a great many of the files have
duplicate names.
</P>

<P>
In addition, each saved game (which uses less than 700 bytes)
requires a separate disk. This is not a major problem since they're
entirely non-destructive; so, you can use any disk with a bit of
space, but it is annoying. Finally, there is no "quit" feature (you
must turn off or reset the computer), and dying requires a restart.
</P>

<P>
Third, the documentation is incorrect where it talks about things
you may drop. Any dropped item behaves in exactly the same way, no
matter where you drop it -- in the room where you pick it up, the
room you're to use it in, or any other room. The Amiga version lets
you drop as many items as you want, but finding them is far more
difficult. You must search most of the lower portion of the screen.
Fortunately, if you follow this solve, you won't have to do that.
</P>

<P>
One final comment: At times the game will display inset pictures on
your screen of various things you may have examined. Often, it is
the inset you need to use in order to get an item, or whatever else
you may be trying to accomplish. If something isn't working when
you know it should be, try using the inset instead of the original
(or vice versa, depending on what you were using before). We do
tell you which to use, however. So, let's get started!
</P>

<H3>THE CASTLE</H3>

<P>
Once you start traveling, it is difficult to return to the rest of
the castle, so we'll start by collecting everything we need in this
part. You begin in the Entrance Hall of your father's castle. If
you LOOK at the left newel post of the stairway, you'll notice it's
missing an ornament. Go east into the den, and you'll find it on
the bookcase to the right of the desk. It's the only important
thing in this room; so, GET the ornament, and while you're here,
DROP the letter (the one from your documentation), and go back west
to the Hallway. USE the ornament on the top of the left newel post.
LOOK at the urn and you'll find your first punchcard! TAKE the card
from the urn.
</P>

<P>
Go up and LOOK at the base of the statue. TAKE the key, and USE it
on the lock of the chest at the back of the room. LOOK in the
chest, TAKE the gloves, and drop the key. Now, LOOK at the upper
right-hand corner of the carpet, and you'll find another punchcard.
TAKE it, and proceed northeast into the bedroom. PULL on the handle
of the bedside table, then LOOK in the drawer. TAKE the piece of
paper. LOOK at the throw pillows on the bed, and TAKE the punchcard
you find there. LOOK under the bed, and TAKE the grapnel and rope.
That's all that's important here, and the other bedroom has nothing
useful. Head southwest and down to the Entrance Hall.
</P>

<P>
Go west into the dining room, then north into the kitchen. TAKE the
bottle on the counter.
</P>

<P>
PULL on the cabinet that is directly under the sink.
</P>

<P>
LOOK at the cabinet, and you'll get a smaller picture of the safe
that's hidden there! USE the paper you found upstairs on the safe.
</P>

<P>
Voila! It opens, and you see some money and a lighter. Ignore the
money, but take the lighter, then go south, east, and northeast.
</P>

<P>
Hey, it's dark! Not to worry. LIGHT the lighter, then go up and
east into the chapel. On the right side of the mantel in the rear
of the room is a candle.
</P>

<P>
TAKE the candle, LIGHT it, then UNLIGHT the lighter. It is
important to do this as efficiently as possible because the lighter
is almost out of fluid, and you'll need it later. LOOK at the book
on the lectern, and you'll find the fourth punchcard you need. TAKE
it and go west, down twice, then east to the Laboratory.
</P>

<P>
At this point your inventory is probably full, so DROP any one item
except the candle.
</P>

<P>
LOOK at the mirror on the wall, and a hidden switch will appear.
PUSH the switch (on the inset picture), and a secret door will open!
DO NOT GO THROUGH THE DOOR! Putting the ornament back on the newel
post activated the electricity so you could open the door. But if
you go through the door now, you'll get fried! Go west, up, and
southwest to the hallway. GET the ornament from the newel post,
then DROP it.
</P>

<P>
Go northeast, down, and east back to the Laboratory. PULL the
left-hand desk drawer, and LOOK in it. You'll find some fuses.
TAKE them, then go north into the Secret Room. Ah, ha! There's the
time machine!
</P>

<P>
USE fuses on the green square at the bottom of the fuse box on the
left rear wall, then PULL the lever next to the fuse box. The Time
Machine comes to life.
</P>

<P>
Don't be too eager to use the Time Machine just yet. You're going
to need whichever item you dropped in the Laboratory. So, go south
and search around until you find it. Use the GET icon on the bottom
portion of the picture. You'll just have to keep searching along
the bottom of the screen until you find your item, then go back
north.
</P>

<P>
This is a good place to save your game. We're ready to explore Time
now, so get ready!
</P>

<H3>INDIA, EGYPT, PREHISTORY</H3>

<P>
Okay we're ready to get started. To enter the Time Machine use the
UP icon (to leave it use the DOWN icon). So, ENTER the machine, and
SHOW the control panel.
</P>

<P>
If you follow this walkthru exactly, you should be able to follow
the rest of the instructions, because your punchcards will be in the
proper place in your inventory. In case you haven't followed along,
here is where the various punchcards in the Amiga version will take
you:
</P>

<P>
From the Urn in the Hallway: Prehistory<BR>
From Under the Rug: India<BR>
From Under the Pillows: Egypt<BR>
From the Chapel: Mexico
</P>

<P>
If you remove a card, those to its right move to the left to fill
the empty space, but their relative positions do not change.
</P>

<P>
USE the SECOND punchcard in your inventory on the slot in the
control panel.
</P>

<P>
Whoosh: You're in India! Go west, then north into the hut. The
Leper wants to shake your hand, but you don't want to get leprosy;
so, USE the glove, then TAKE the Leper's hand.
</P>

<P>
Just leave the glove on throughout the rest of the game: You'll
need it periodically.
</P>

<P>
The Leper will be so grateful he'll give you a piece of paper which
will allow you to take an elephant ride. He also asks you to get
some water from the sacred temple which will cure him. GET the
paper, and go south, east twice, then northeast to the Mahouts.
DROP the paper, and they'll agree to take you to the temple.
</P>

<P>
"Up" will put you on the elephant's back, and you'll automatically
end up at the temple.
</P>

<P>
Go east into the temple, and you'll find the sacred water. To get
the water into the bottle, do the following exactly:
</P>

<P>
USE<BR>
BOTTLE<BR>
GET<BR>
WATER
</P>

<P>
The text should say that you have the water. Now go west and up,
and the elephant will take you back to where you started.
</P>

<P>
Go southwest, west twice, north, and DROP the bottle.
</P>

<P>
The grateful Leper will offer you a key. TAKE the key, then go
south, east, and north, and you'll see a smaller picture of a door.
USE the key on the door and you'll be inside a hut.
</P>

<P>
On the table is a letter and a piece of punchcard! TAKE the
punchcard piece, and the letter, then DROP the letter. (It probably
has an important clue, but nobody can figure out how to read it!)
</P>

<P>
Go south, west twice, and you'll see a Fakir who has a scroll in his
right hand. TAKE the scroll, but don't hang around! Go east twice,
up into the machine, SHOW PANEL, and PUSH the toggle switch on the
left side of the control panel.
</P>

<P>
You made it home again! DROP the candle, then enter the Time
Machine. SHOW PANEL, and USE the SECOND punchcard in your inventory
on the slot.
</P>

<P>
You find yourself in Egypt! LEAVE the Time Machine and go
northeast. You should see a pedestrian-crossing here. If you
don't, _do not_ go north, or you'll get run over! (The northeast
direction in the Amiga version was VERY touchy; half the time you
ended up going east instead of northeast. You can also get to the
pedestrian-crossing by going east twice from the Time Machine.)
</P>

<P>
Go north twice, and you find yourself in front of a Pyramid. LOOK
at the bottom left stone surrounding the entrance. You're told the
stones are loose, and you find an amulet. GET the amulet.
</P>

<P>
Since we can't find a way to READ things, you'll have to trust this
walkthru.
</P>

<P>
The scroll says: "TOP, TOP LEFT, TOP RIGHT, TOP RIGHT." Using the
PUSH/PULL icon, PUSH on the stones in the order indicated by the
scroll, and the door will open. If you don't do this right, you
die. DROP the scroll.
</P>

<P>
Go north twice, ignoring the torch on the way. You don't want to
mess with all those snakes, so DROP the amulet, and they disappear.
Now, go north again, then west. USE the grapnel and rope, and go
up.
</P>

<P>
Starting from the left, use the PUSH/PULL icon and PULL the SECOND,
THIRD, FOURTH, and FIFTH levers into the down position. The
sarcophagus will open. In it you find a ring and another piece of
the punchcard. TAKE the ring and the piece of card.
</P>

<P>
Using the PUSH/PULL icon, return the four levers to their original
positions.
</P>

<P>
Go down, north, and TURN the right-hand torch on the wall to open a
secret passage into Nefertiti. Going down will take you outside to
the entrance into the pyramid. (If you hadn't returned the levers
to their original positions, you would have been impaled on spikes
in the secret passage.) Go south twice, west, and up into the Time
Machine. SHOW PANEL, and PUSH the toggle switch to go home.
</P>

<P>
A note here about dropping pieces of the punchcard. This was done
in order to make room in your inventory, but it is a bit of a pain
to find them again, especially in the Amiga version. From now on,
we will include a note on how many inventory spaces you will need in
a given time zone.
</P>

<P>
For the next time zone (Prehistory), you will need four free
inventory spaces. The punchcard you USE in the time machine will
release one inventory space; you can drop an item to free another
space.
</P>

<P>
In the secret room, DROP the piece of punchcard (if you need extra
inventory space), SHOW PANEL, then USE the FIRST card in your
inventory to enter Prehistory.
</P>

<P>
LEAVE the machine and go east. LOOK at the entrance to the hut, and
you'll find a bone. TAKE the bone. You will also find some dry
grass and a rock. If you have space, you can TAKE the ROCK.
</P>

<P>
Now, go east twice, and north to the remains of a fire. LOOK at the
fire and you'll find a piece of wood. TAKE the wood, LIGHT your
lighter, LIGHT the wood, UNLIGHT the lighter.
</P>

<P>
You may now drop the lighter. Toward the back of this scene you'll
see some small rocks. LOOK at the rocks, and you'll be told there's
a small rock there. TAKE the rock (if you didn't take the one from
the hut), then go east and south into the cave.
</P>

<P>
LOOK in the area of the candles, and you'll find another piece of
punchcard. TAKE the piece, then LOOK at the drawing that appears in
the left corner of the background. You should get an inset picture
on your screen showing the drawing's finer details. It's a drawing
of a temple with "13-H" written above it.
</P>

<P>
Go north, west, south, and west three times. ENTER the Time
Machine. SHOW PANEL, and PUSH the toggle switch to go home.
</P>

<H3>MEXICO AND THE FUTURE</H3>

<P>
We're about to embark on the most complicated scenario yet; be
prepared to save your game! First, DROP the piece of punchcard you
picked up in Egypt, if you want to. You only need one free
inventory space, and you'll get that from the punchcard. The branch
is also useless, so you may drop it.
</P>

<P>
Go north to the Time Machine. SHOW PANEL, and USE the remaining
punchcard on the slot. Suddenly, you find yourself in Mexico!
</P>

<P>
From the Time Machine, go east twice, and you'll see a tree on the
left side of the screen with a hole near its bottom. LOOK at the
hole, then TAKE the necklace. Go west four times to the warrior.
USE the necklace on his right hand near the bottom of the screen.
He'll draw you a map, and tell you to start from the three rocks.
</P>

<P>
(Just in case Psygnosis decides to change this, you'd better make a
copy of the map!)
</P>

<P>
Go northeast three times, then north to a small temple. LOOK at the
temple, and you'll see an idol. TURN the idol, and you'll find a
key. TAKE the key, go west three times, and you'll be at the three
stones the warrior told you about.
</P>

<P>
Save your game here! As mentioned before, the direction icons are
very touchy. If you're off by a pixel or two, you'll go in the
wrong direction and get killed.
</P>

<P>
Go northeast three times, north twice, northwest twice, northeast,
then east. You should find yourself in front of the temple. You
should still be wearing the glove. If so, LOOK at the bush in the
middle foreground of the picture. (If you're NOT wearing the glove,
a snake will kill you!)
</P>

<P>
You should get an inset picture of a slab with a slot in the middle
of it. USE the ring on the slot in the MAIN picture (not the
inset), go up, and beams of light will appear, indicating that the
door is now safe to approach. Going up again will provide you with
an inset picture of a door. You'll notice a small hole on each side
of the door. USE the bone on the hole on the RIGHT side. The text
will tell you that nothing happens, but if you go up again, you'll
find yourself in the temple.
</P>

<P>
You are now inside the temple facing a chest. USE the key on the
chest, and TAKE the final piece of punchcard! (If you have the
other three pieces of punchcard with you, they will automatically
become one whole punchcard. We guess punchcards worked differently
in the 1920s, before computers were invented.)
</P>

<P>
Go down, and save your game; then, go west, southwest, southeast
twice, south twice, southwest three times, southeast twice, and
southwest. You're back at the Time Machine. ENTER the time
machine. SHOW PANEL) and PUSH the toggle switch.
</P>

<P>
Now LEAVE the machine, and GET the three other pieces of punch card
you dropped in the room (if you dropped them). After you find the
second piece, you'll see a new inset picture appear. We have _no
idea_ what it represents.
</P>

<P>
When you find the fourth piece, the punchcard will automatically be
assembled for you, and you're ready for the final assault! All you
need in your inventory at this point is the glove, rock, picture,
and punchcard. ENTER the Time Machine (SHOW PANEL), and USE the
punch card in the slot.
</P>

<P>
When you arrive, LEAVE the Time Machine. Ahead of you, you will see
a door. To the left of it is what looks like a monitor with a
couple of buttons under it. PUSH the red button, and a picture will
appear on the monitor. In the lower right corner of your screen,
you'll see a console. PUSH the red button on the console, and a map
of the world will appear. Go west, the door should open, and a
guard with a gun will appear. In order to take care of him, click
in the following order:
</P>

<P>
HIT<BR>
MAN<BR>
ROCK
</P>

<P>
Someone suggested that you need to do more here before hitting the
man. So if this doesn't work, try fiddling around with something
first.
</P>

<P>
LOOK at the floor where the man fell; you'll find a suit, a gun, and
a strange key. You need the suit and the key, but you can ignore
the gun if you wish. USE the suit and you'll be wearing it.
</P>

<P>
Go north, east twice, and south to a small room with some equipment
in it. At the bottom right you will see a platform with a red
button on it. PUSH the button, and you'll see a picture of a
strange machine with an "X" on it. (Remember the position of the
"X"!) Now, go north three times, and west: There's the machine you
saw in the little picture!
</P>

<P>
PUSH on the area where you saw the "X," and a compartment will open.
Making sure you're still wearing the glove, TAKE the fuses out of
the open compartment.
</P>

<P>
The machine will stop functioning. Go east. There's a storage
compartment on your right which contains a spacesuit. This suit
will let you go out into space, but there's nothing out there, so
don't bother. Instead, continue south twice, then east.
</P>

<P>
If you're not wearing the suit, or if you didn't remove the fuses
from the machine, you'll get killed at this point.
</P>

<P>
If you're still alive, USE the key on the control box to the right
of the door. If you haven't brought the picture with you, the key
will have no effect. (It makes no sense to us, either!)
</P>

<P>
If you HAVE brought the picture, the servant will appear, confess
everything, and a picture of Humphrey Bogart will appear telling you
you've won the game.
</P>
