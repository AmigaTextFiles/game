<H2>CHEATS</H2>

<P>
When you land go and pick up the message from Ratt on Butre, then
return to the Swan and then land again. There will be another
message from Ratt. Pick this up as well. Repeat this 88 times (!)
and put all the messages in the backpacks, and when they are full,
carry them in the hands and one on the cursor, enter a base and
find a shop. You can sell all the messages and get about 18,500
credits.
</P>

<P>
Anyone who has played captive may have noticed the relationship
between the droids name, and the stats that the droid starts with.
For the name "ZAK", all but one of the stats is at the initial
maximum, the remaining stat is only one off! For the name
"Jonathan" all the stats are at the maximun.
</P>

<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
You have to fly your spaceship, the swan, to the planet BUTRE, (
co-ordinates 008w-072n ). While you are on the way place the chips
in the droids head. You now have to assign them a name. The chip
is in the backpack of each droid. Once this is done you will aquire
the ability to punch, which is the first means, for the time being,
of attacking. Once you are orbiting, zoom in on the white dot and
click on it. Your craft will land. Wander around till you find the
green door. A message from Ratt is at the door with a code on it.
This will let you in once you correctly execute it. Once inside
pick up the explosives and another message. Go to the end of the
passage and click the right mouse button on the forward icon. The
wall will move forward, most likely you will encounter your first
base aliens. You must explore the whole base by opening every
cupboard and door. There's a map here to help you find your way.
Pick up all sacks of gold whenever you destroy an enemy. As you
gain experience trade-em on attributes. Before you can get out of
the base you have to do two things. Find the professor and kill him
for the password for the computer so as you can get the planet probe
( from the computer ). Then you must find the generators and
destroy them by throwing the explosives in the top of them. Once
this is done you must exit from the base before it blows up. When
you are back in orbit place the planet probe in the map and it will
head of to the next planet showing you the way.
