<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
A game of strategic warfare combining wild arcade action and
stunning tree-dimensional graphics. You are at the helm of a
futuristic aircraft carrier equipped with fighter planes and
amphibious tanks, missiles and virus bombs. Use up to 4 aircraft
and 4 amphibious vehicles simultaneously, to capture over 60
islands. Features 3-D solid-filled graphics, smooth scrolling,
fabulous sound and special effects. Your choice of action or
strategy game, plus save-game options.

<H2>CHEATS</H2>

<P>
During game, pause and type "THE BEST IS YET TO BE" (with spaces).
The game restarts automatically, and displays 'Cheat mode activated'
in the message panel. When paused, pressing <+> and <-> on the
numeric keypad toggles Manta invincibility: the flying craft are no
longer vulnerable to aerial attack, although collision with large
objects is still fatal. Once a course has been programmed for the
carrier, Mantas or Walruses, engage autopilot and click on pause.
To avoid sloggin around inreal type, you will find that pressing 3
on the keypad and unpausing again takes the corresponding craft
directly to its destination. Likewise, pausing and pressing 2
replaces lost shielding, while tapping 1 refuels the craft in
question. 9 shows the current difficulty level, 7 speeds up the
game and 6 brings up the programmers' test palette!
</P>

<P>
While in the pause mode, type "GROW OLD ALONG WITH ME" (include the
spaces). You should now see the message {CHEAT MODE ACTIVE}.
Pressing the '+' key on the numeric keypad protects your mantas and
aavs from missile attacks. The '-' key can be used to turn this
off. Pressing the following keys in sequence: 'HELP', 'Q', 'S',
'CTRL', and 'ALT', gives you a little message. Pressing the '9' on
the keypad displays the current level. '6' and '8' have some other
effect. Returning to the title screen, press the '+' and '-' keys
to view all objects in the game.
</P>

<P>
While in the WALRUS arming menu, select nine Harbinger surface to
surface missiles and put them in the AAV. Select the AVATAR
CHEMICAL LASER and place it over the missiles. Then select the pod
you want (ACCB, VIRUS BOMB, FUEL) and place it in the AAV. Then,
when you've launched the AAV, look at it's weapons and you'll find
you have both missiles and laser! On returning to the carrier any
missiles you have left will be added to the ship's stores. Carry on
doing this and hundreds of missiles can be yours.
</P>

<P>
Try pressing 'CTRL' and 'M' on the main screen for some interesting
effects.
</P>

<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
Try always to cut of the path to the homebase (top right island) of
the enemy ship. It might get stuck without fuel and so buys you lot
of time to conquer a lot of islands.
</P>

<P>
Instead of reinforcing your supply lines, go straight for the
enemies home island, Nemesis, as it freezes the enemy supply line
and disables the enemy carrier.
</P>

<P>
Start the action game and set a course for Isolus (just east of
Thermopylae). Stay just out of range for approximately 10 minutes.
As soon as the message "Isolus is now an enemy island appears,
launch a manta and fly toward the north side of the island. The
enemy carrier will be directly ahead of you.
</P>

<H2>FUN</H2>

<P>
Pressing the following keys in sequence: 'HELP', 'Q', 'S', 'CTRL',
'ALT', gives you a little message. Pressing the '9' on the keypad
displays the current level. '6' and '8' have some other effect.
Returning to the title screen, press the '+' and '-' keys to view
all objects in the game.
