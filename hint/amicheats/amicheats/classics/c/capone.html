<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Action and adventure in Chicago's 1920s. Use your machine gun to
beat the gangsters. Liven up the action with The Phaser, a real
light gun sold seperately.

<P>
To find a special bonus, go to the front of the Post Office. Shoot
the ball at the top of the flag pole, and your score will raise. If
you shoot it again, you'll see a screen of programmers. Shoot it
again and you'll be invincible, standing in the bank. At the end
of that round, you will start at the beginning with warp speed.
