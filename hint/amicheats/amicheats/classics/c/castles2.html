<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
Use 'RIGHT MOUSE' to speed up the clock while waiting for an event
to occur. This works in both the Strategic and Tactical modes.
</P>

<P>
Defending military forces are always approximately one-half the size
of a player's total military force. The number of soldiers that a
territory can muster in its defense, in other words, is based on the
total size of the army owned by the controlling player. To be
precise, the number of each type of unit is equal to one-half of the
number of such units in the player's army, rounding up. For
example, a player with three infantry and five archers would defend
with two infantry and three archers.
</P>

<P>
The defender still has an edge, however. The strength of each
individual defensive unit is adjusted upward slightly to account for
the defender's superior knowledge of the terrain. The defender also
gets to choose where the battle will be fought. This offers a
significant advantage to the clever player. Finally, the attacker
will have a very difficult time winning unless the odds are greater
than 2:1 in its favor (this includes morale, which is not
immediately measurable, just as in real life).
</P>

<P>
The battle system works both ways: when you are attacked, you
defend with half of your forces. If you lose the battle, you may
then launch a retaliatory attack on the other player, who will
defend with half of whatever forces remain after the first attack.
Also, remember that every unit lost to either player removes one
unit of that type from the player's forces. However, since the
defender only fields an army half the size of its total force, it
can never be wiped out in a single battle. The attacker, however,
can be completely eliminated by a solid defender. A counterattack
after such a rout is usually devastating to the once-proud
aggressor.
</P>

<P>
The intent of this design is to encourage back-and-forth
skirmishing. It also places the greatest risk of loss on the player
who has the most to gain -- the attacker. This design applies to
both the computer players and the human players; they abide by
exactly the same rules. This includes the rule which provides at
least one Infantry and one Archer to a player with no military
forces. We assume that any territory -- human or computer -- is
capable of offering some defense to an attacker, however meager.
</P>

<P>
Your army's morale is based on the Happiness of your people.
Battles may be won and lost solely on morale. It has a very strong
effect on the outcome. Be sure to keep your Happiness at least as
high as that of your neighbors.
</P>

<H3>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</H3>

<P>
CASTLES II employs two sophisticated, multi-level artificial
intelligence engines for the computer players -- one for Strategic
mode, another for Tactical mode. Only the Strategic AI is discussed
in this analysis.
</P>

<P>
The Strategic AI consists of medium-level and high-level portions.
Actions are initiated through the same task mechanism used by the
human players. In fact, the AI players were tested by letting one
of them run the game in place of the human, even displaying results
on the same user interface.
</P>

<P>
CASTLES II was exhaustively playtested for six months. Every aspect
of the gameplay was critiqued and fine-tuned. This was an
especially complex task for the artificial intelligence routines.
Many of the AI algorithms were rewritten several times until they
became satisfyingly realistic. Fortunately, the computer players
use the same tasks as the humans. The tuning factors were based on
empirical adjustments derived from actual human playtesters. The
result is a series of opponents who play at a level equivalent to
that of an expert human player. The Easy and Impossible difficulty
levels in the game were created by adjusting delicately more than a
dozen factors in the playing style of each opponent.
</P>

<P>
The medium-level AI maintains appropriate levels of commodities and
military forces, and ensures the safety and security of the kingdom.
It issues Gather and Recruit tasks whenever it decides to increase
the level of a commodity or increase its military strength. The
medium-level AI can send Merchants (this is a good way to find out
if a computer player is experiencing a shortage of a given resource,
by the way). The medium-level AI also starts a Happiness task when
the peoples' morale drops, sends Scouts to neighboring territories,
and Polices the realm if it is being Sabotaged or Spied upon.
</P>

<P>
The medium-level AI does not think very often. During playtesting,
this AI was found to be extremely agile in its response to changing
conditions in the game -- far more agile, in fact, than any
reasonable human opponent. The frequency of its thinking was
reduced to compensate for this. One other adjustment was made.
Since the computer players do not get the benefit of plots or random
events, which often give "freebies" to the human player, the AIs
were given the ability to obtain one unit of a given resource if no
units are available in their stockpiles and the computer wants to
run a task that requires that item. This also compensates partially
for problems which arise due to their reduced frequency of thinking.
This only applies if they are completely out of that commodity. The
computer players cannot pile up large stocks of goods in this
manner. Also, they do not possess this special ability at the Easy
difficulty level.
</P>

<P>
The high-level AIs handle the more complex thinking in the game.
They use a modified version of a traditional AI approach to
prioritization of their various options. This keeps them from
becoming locked into simple patterns of action. Attack, Build
Castle, Saboteur, Spy, and Diplomat are high-level AI tasks. The
computer evaluates each task based on a large number of variables.
It may decide to attack a particular territory because it contains a
commodity that is in short supply, or it may back off if it finds a
castle there. It weighs all of the possibilities and chooses the
one which is the best means of achieving its goals.
</P>

<H3>BEGINNING</H3>

<P>
At the beginning of the game, your focus should be on grabbing
territory. This cannot be done in a haphazard manner, though. Your
most important goals should be:
</P>

<OL>
<LI>Build a solid, defensible perimeter
<LI>Possess all four types of resources
<LI>Crank your economy up to top speed as soon as possible
</OL>

<P>
Most of the players begin in one corner or another of the map. The
best strategy for these players is to aim for an initial size of
five or six territories. Conquer a few immediately, preferably by
building a "wall" of territories that you own, behind which may be a
few that you do not yet own but are inaccessible to the other
players (the other players cannot "leapfrog" and get to them).
Then, conquer these other territories. Territories will revolt if
not subjugated by a show of force. You must therefore begin to
build castles once you control four or five territories. Try to
build just one castle, preferably in a territory which borders every
other territory that you own. If you are very fortunate, or have
planned well, the territory in which you build the castle will have
Gold as a resource. Make sure that your castle is at least 100
points strong, so that it will prevent revolts in all neighboring
territories . The castle will not prevent revolts until it reaches
an appropriate level of completion. Be sure to start construction
early enough to ensure that your people will not revolt before the
castle reaches this critical size. One good way to speed up the
construction process is to skip the moat: it slows the construction
process significantly.
</P>

<P>
Politics also plays a critical role in the game, even at this early
stage. Make sure that your people are happy. Make sure that the
Pope likes you. And try to keep your enemies at bay by buying them
off occasionally until you can become strong enough to fight them
effectively. Tough Choices
</P>

<P>
Once you have your initial territories under control, you may choose
any one of several approaches to the game. The game can be won
through military conquest, administrative power, or political
expertise, although the obvious military approach is the easiest.
Make a decision now as to how you wish to proceed, and stick to it
as long as possible.
</P>

<P>
The game will place far more demands on your resources than they can
support. You must decide whether to make your people happy, build
alliances with your neighbors, build castles, or build a dominant
military force. Your basic strategy choice will determine which of
these will be emphasized.
</P>

<P>
There are a few general pointers that apply to any strategy. Keep
these in mind, and you will always be in control -- as much as
possible, anyhow. And, lest you think that these pointers are not
important, just remember that the other players ARE using them.
</P>

<P>
Use every ability point that you have. Even if you are not running
a Military task, for example, apply the otherwise unused Military
ability points to another task, such as a Gather. This will serve
the dual purpose of increasing the speed of the gather task and
giving you the extra push toward raising your ability rating. Your
Military ability will not increase as quickly as if you were running
Military tasks, but any contribution in the right direction is
helpful.
</P>

<P>
Stay friendly with the Pope. Monitor your relations regularly.
Remember that attacking a friend of the Pope (noted by the word
"Blessed" next to that player's name in the Council display) will
cause your relations with the Pope to decrease by one point. It is
very easy, therefore, to become excommunicated through carelessness.
</P>

<P>
Stay friendly, or at least on neutral terms (Relations of 4 to 6)
with your neighbors. The better your relations with them, the less
likely they are to attack or sabotage you. Also, your Merchants are
likely to get better deals if they are dealing with friendly
parties.
</P>

<P>
Maintain a reasonable army size. Make it too small, and your
neighbors may attack when their spies discover that you are a
weakling. Make it too large, and the maintenance costs will drag
down your economy.
</P>

<P>
Send Diplomats to "buy off" enemies who are attacking you. They
remember friendly actions and are less likely to attack if they have
reached a diplomatic agreement recently. Unfortunately, they cannot
recall armies who are already in the process of attacking, so your
Diplomat may be too late to be effective. Also, enemies remember
your hostile acts even longer than they remember the nice ones.
</P>

<P>
Think in terms of small campaigns. Before launching attacks, pick a
small number of territories to capture, build up your army and then
go. Don't bite off more than you can chew! After grabbing a couple
of provinces, consolidate your gains, rebuild your army and erect
castles for defense. Never get greedy, as an overextended empire
crumbles very quickly!
</P>

<P>
Always harvest your resources. You will use them up very rapidly as
everything you do costs money and/or goods. Try to resist building
a castle until your Administrative Rating hits 5, allowing you a
second task in that category. Then keep harvesting as you build.
</P>

<P>
If you don't have a good mix of commodities in the territories you
own, you can still have a good economy. Try to harvest the
commodity you have the most of and then trade them for what you
need. You'll need good relations with a trading partner to pull
this off, but it works well when you don't have access to iron and
gold. Always remember that the black market is risky, but it can
help bail you out of tight situations.
</P>

<H3>MILITARY MIGHT</H3>

<P>
Many players initially try to win the game through brute military
force. Unfortunately, being a leader means more than having the
largest army. You must also make friends with those who can be most
helpful to you. You must choose your enemies carefully. And you
must manage your realm well enough that it does not vanish in a
sudden spate of revolts. The following hints should assist the
determined militarist:
</P>

<P>
Obtain Knights as soon as possible. Build up to a Military Ability
Rating of 6 by recruiting and attacking. Don't police your realm
unless it's essential. Take a risk in order to build up your forces
more rapidly.
</P>

<P>
Build just enough castles to prevent revolts. You can build them
without moats if you're in a big hurry.
</P>

<P>
Make sure that you have plenty of Iron and Wood initially, so that
you can build a big army. Then make sure that you have plenty of
Food and Gold to pay for these forces. If you lose them due to
failure to pay, you may very well lose the game.
</P>

<P>
Choose your enemies carefully. Only attack one at a time. Trying
to conquer two at once will almost certainly end in disaster. Send
plenty of Diplomats to the other player to keep him off your back.
Besides, you can get better trading terms with that player until
you're ready to attack.
</P>

<P>
Ambush a weak opponent. Call a Council and see who is at war with
whom. Then attack a neighbor who is busy fighting someone else.
</P>

<P>
Don't attack Blessed players unless you have no other choice. The
Pope will cause you a great deal of grief. You should never need to
be excommunicated.
</P>

<H3>ADMINISTRATIVE ACUMEN AND POLITICAL PROWESS</H3>

<P>
CASTLES II may also be won through administrative might and
diplomatic savy. A player with six well-chosen territories and many
castles can prosper and win without spending enormous amounts of
effort on military campaigns.
</P>

<P>
The key to an administrative victory is maintaining the happiness of
your people and becoming allies with the other players. Run
Happiness tasks and send plenty of Diplomats to your neighbors.
</P>

<P>
Focus on obtaining Gold territories. You will need Gold to buy off
your neighbors and the Pope.
</P>

<P>
Build a moderate-sized standing army. If your neighbors suspect
that you have a small army, they are more likely to attack you.
Remember that losses affect the attacker more than the defender
(since the defender will never lose more than half of his army in
any given battle), so you can do a great deal of damage to someone
who dares attack you.
</P>

<P>
If you get attacked, send Diplomats. If relations improve, your
opponent will temporarily be less willing to attack again. Keep up
a steady stream of Diplomats and you may be able to avert a second
attack.
</P>

<P>
Send lots of Merchants and Diplomats. Political Ability points are
the most difficult to achieve, but you will have plenty of time to
get them since you will be spending fewer resources on military
actions.
</P>

<P>
When other players like you a lot (Relations of 8 or 9), trade will
be more advantageous. You can actually make a profit on trade if
you work hard at it. Every unit in your stockpile puts you closer
to victory.
</P>

<P>
Don't forget that your friends will turn on you when you Claim.
Relations will drop by one point with every other player. You will
suddenly be the target of numerous Saboteurs and Attacks. Be
prepared. Just before you claim, build up a substantial army with
plenty of Knights and Archers.
</P>

<H3>LONG-TERM STRATEGY</H3>

<P>
The goal of CASTLES II, ultimately, is to survive long enough to
become King. Once you have established your initial fiefdom, it is
time to put your overall strategy to the test. Focus on the
elements that you deem most important, as noted above. We won't
tell you how to win. There are many ways to win in CASTLES II, and
part of the fun is in discovering them for yourself. However, a few
general pointers for later in the game may be warranted:
</P>

<P>
Build a buffer of extra points before you Claim. Once the other
players get wind of your pending coronation, they will become
increasingly aggressive toward you. Claiming reduces relations of
all other players with you. This can pull you very rapidly into
warfare. Make sure that the loss of points due to the drop in
relations, plus the drops due to the attacks you will receive, will
not be so severe that the Pope decides not reject your claim.
</P>

<P>
Deciding when to Claim is a tricky decision. If you are the first
to try, everyone will take their shot at knocking you down. Waiting
for someone else to claim first is also a tricky path to follow
because you might not have enough time or power to knock him down,
and, if more players claim in the meantime, it'll turn into a free-
for-all. (Actually that becomes quite a fun endgame to be involved
in. Maybe that's not such a bad idea after all!)
</P>

<H3>TEN SURE WAYS TO lOSE</H3>

<P>
Attack two or three other players at once. Yeah, the more, the
merrier. It's fun to send troops in every direction, grabbing
territory as quickly as possible. It's fun to lose troops faster
than you can Recruit them. It's fun to beat back counterattacks
every two weeks. It's fun to restart the game every ten minutes!
</P>

<P>
Ignore the Pope: attack Blessed players: get Excommunicated. So
what if they are the Pope's friends? So what if eventually this
gets you Excommunicated? You're too tough to expect your people to
be happy. Besides, no iron-fisted ruler worth his garde-robe
worries about those Holy Rollers. And don't worry about the
precipitous drop in your army's morale because your people are
unhappy. Your army is three times bigger than any other in Bretagne
-- at least, it was the last time you checked. Besides, you don't
need to send no stinkin' Merchants.
</P>

<P>
Never send Diplomats. Diplomats are pansies. You kill them when
they come to you. Why send yours when Relations are always so bad
anyway? You don't need no stinkin' friends (see Merchants above).
Scorched earth --that's your style. Take no prisoners. Just build
an army and kill everyone at once. No problem. They'll never have
time to mount a counterattack. What if everybody hates you? Huh?.
What if? Are you talkin' to me?
</P>

<P>
Trade inefficiently: Rely on the Black Market for scarce goods.
Trade with people who hate you. Everyone is out to get you. You
have no friends, so why would you expect them to trade
advantageously with you? What's so bad about an occasional 2 :1 or
3:1 swap for something you really need? Losing one or two units per
trade doesn't really add up to much over thirty or forty trades,
anyway. Besides, how could you possibly have planned ahead for your
needs?
</P>

<P>
Let your army starve or go without paychecks. Why, when you were in
the military you went six, seven years without eating. Yeah, and
when you ate all you had to eat were rocks. Yeah, and when you got
paid you got paid in sticks. Yeah, and they were wet too! After
all, you only lose one military unit on the first delay. Why should
you care if it's your best unit? You have more Knights than you can
use, don't you? And don't worry about the fact that you lose double
the units after every further delay. You have more important
concerns than maintaining an army.
</P>

<P>
Ignore a commodity because it's not important. Who needs Food,
except to feed the army, recruit Knights, and make people happy?
Who needs Timber, except to build castles, recruit Archers, and make
people happy? Who needs Iron, except to build castles and recruit
Infantry? Nobody needs Gold, right? Right? ... Well, gold maybe
...
</P>

<P>
Don't build castles. The name of the game is CASTLES II. But that
has nothing to do with it. You're too busy conquering neighboring
territories to worry about those pesky revolts. And who needs
double commodities anyway? (see above) And you can always reconquer
the territories you lose. Your neighbors would never even think
about trying to capture a neutral territory that was once yours.
And how much protection can you really get from a pile of stone?
Ten archers posted on the walls can't possibly be very useful. Why
would you ever imagine that they might be safer up there, or might
be able to shoot arrows further? And what possible advantage could
there be to protecting all of your Infantry and Knights from enemy
Archers?
</P>

<P>
Never, ever Claim the throne. Why try to win, when you can have
lots of fun getting beaten to a bloody pulp year after year?
Masochism builds character. No, even better. Claim early. Just as
soon as your score creeps up to 7001. Yeah, that'll show everyone
just what you think of them. Those sniveling, wimps.
</P>

<P>
Change strategies every year or so. Yeah, keep duckin' and weavin'.
Bobbin' and dopin'. Move slowly and in different directions all the
time. Those computer players won't know what to do. Who needs to
focus on a consistent strategy? Planning never worked for Wile E.
Coyote.
</P>

<P>
Never send Scouts and Spies. Never call a Council. Why bother
looking at your neighbors? They aren't planning any hostile
actions. You're perfectly happy with two or three territories on
the wrong side of the river. You never worry when a new neighbor
shows up. He couldn't possibly have fifteen military units poised
on your border, a Happiness of 9, and a serious need for elbow room.
So what if Aragon just marched all the way to Albion's part of the
map? He can't possibly be winning the game. In fact, nobody else
could possibly be doing better than you. Just ignore them. You
always win on Impossible level, anyway.
</P>
