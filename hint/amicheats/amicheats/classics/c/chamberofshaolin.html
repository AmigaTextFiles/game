<H2>TIPS</H2>

<H3>SI ZHI BAN (TEST OF THE STICK)</H3>

<P>
Your master will attack you with the stick, using three different
moves; a leg sweep, mid swing and a high swing. The first two can
be avoided by jumping in the air, and the high sweep is dodged by
crouching down. If possible 60 of these attacks should be dodged so
that you can get the maximum bonuses to your attributes, any more
will not add to the bonuses. You will be able to sustain 10 hits
before you collapse from exhaustion, so care and quick reactions
will be needed. I found that a good tip was to take two steps
backward just after your master has stopped advancing on you, so it
gives you a bit more reaction time the stick hits, so if you're
quick enough you can just walk backwards and out of reach of the
attack.
</P>

<H3>SI ZHI ROU LUANG (TEST OF AGILITY)</H3>

<P>
Agility is something you're going to need plenty of if you're to
last very long against the opposition. Like the last test, this one
improves your strength, defence force and constitution, but it isn't
as hard to complete as the Test of the Stick, and you will get a
bigger reward at the end of it. Dodging is the name of the game
here, and the amount of energy you have left at the end will decide
what bonuses you get (65% or more will be enough to guarantee
maximum bonus points). Circular Yin and Yang signs are the only
things that can be touched, and when you do, 20% of your energy will
be restored.
</P>

<H3>SI ZHI JUN SI (TEST OF BALANCE)</H3>

<P>
This is the last chance for you to upgrade your defence force (and
get a bit more strength in the process). By jumping from one pole
to another you must collect ten symbols as quickly as possible.
Jumping from a fast moving pole to a slow one doesn't usually prove
to be a problem, but jumping the other way round is much more tricky
and care should be taken. Remember you're allowed three goes at
this test, so take chances on the first two goes, and if you still
haven't completed it, then take a bit more time on the third one; 26
seconds or lower will be enough for prefect scores on this test
which will upgrade your strength and defence force.
</P>

<H3>SI ZHI KUAI (TEST OF SPEED)</H3>

<P>
Kick the ball and release both boards, within about 25 seconds to
complete this test. The idea behind this test is pretty straight
forward and so is the method in which you can complete it. The
hardest part is quickly turning around, ducking and then quickly
kicking it, so that the ball goes in the opposite direction once
you've released one of the boards. When the second board has been
cut, keep your foot in the air so that the ball doesn't come back
and knock you over. Strength and attack force will be affected by
this test.
</P>

<H3>SI ZHI LI SI (TEST OF STRENGTH)</H3>

<P>
Just when your joystick thought it was safe to come out of the
cupboard - along comes a waggling event. As long as you can waggle
your joystick really fast then this test is a cinch. Get your hand
in the centre of the boards and waggle away, and if your arm is a
bit knackered at the end of the stage, have a few minutes rest
before you attempt the next set of boards. Four is the maximum
number of boards you will allowed to break, and once you've done
this, your strength, attack force, and constitution will be upgraded
by a lot of points.
</P>

<H3>SI ZHI HOU (TEST OF FIRE)</H3>

<P>
This is your last chance to boost those skills. Strength, attack
force and constitution will be the skills that benefit. As the man
throws the flaming basket onto the bridge (after avoiding them)
quickly kick each basket away. Be careful not to get trapped, and
get rid of the baskets as quickly as possible, for if too many build
up on the bridge you will fail the test. Around 30 baskets full of
energy will ensure that you get top marks.
</P>

<H3>YOUR VERY OWN CHARACTER</H3>

<P>
If you've managed to keep with the guidelines above then you will
now have a character whose statistics are all 100%.
</P>

<H3>COMBATING YOUR OPPONENTS</H3>

<P>
There are four fighters in all who you will have to kill before you
will eventually arrive at the city walls, and each will be that
little bit harder than the last one. Although you have quite a few
moves available, like most martial arts games you need only use one
or two to kill each opponent. I found that the easiest and best way
to defeat the fighters was to use just the Tiger Claw and the Jump
Kick moves. As a fighter approaches, use the Tiger Claw move, and
if you time it right you should be able to keep him at the right
distance throughout the fight. However now and then the fighter
will jump and avoid the blow. If this does happen, quickly do a
jump kick and, as he lands, your foot will collide with his head and
knock him to the ground inflicting a lot of damage. This will work
on all opponents if timed right.
</P>

<H3>THE CITY WALLS</H3>

<P>
Pretty easy this. All you have to do is run along as fast as
possible, and jump each time you see a boulder, and duck each time
you see a bird. Don't worry too much if you get hit, because you
will lose hardly any energy.
</P>

<H3>AND THE CITY GATES</H3>

<P>
This is what you went through all this vigorous training for; but
even with all that skill, will you have enough energy left to defeat
the dragon? As soon as you see the dragon, go forward and kick him
in the head and keep this up until he opens his mouth and breathes
some fire at you. When he does this, run to the left and when the
flames are about an inch away from the dragon, run forward straight
through the flames and start kicking the dragon again. Keep this up
and, provided you didn't get too badly beaten up by the fighters,
it'll be a piece of cake.
