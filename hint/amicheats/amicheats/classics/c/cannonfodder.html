<P>
Click on the LOAD icon and press and hold both Mouse Buttons for 5
seconds (and then release), a screen will appear offering you a
HARDMAN option and Level Section.
</P>

<P>
Go to the save game option, when the game requests a name type
"JOOLS". "Cheat mode active" will flash at the bottom of the screen
and the ranks and abilities of your men will have increased. It may
be "JOOLSA".
</P>

<H2>HINTS</H2>

<OL>
<LI>In Choppas, land on the enemy to kill them, safer than landing
and getting out.
<LI>I missions in which you have control of a lot of troopers
seperate the lowest ranking trooper from the rest and give him
all the weapons, make sure the rest are safe, then attempt the
mission with one trooper. If the trooper dies just press
'ESC'. This saves a lot of troopers later, such as in mission
18 phase 5 of 5 - The Door.
<LI>Troopers are able to throw grenades quite along way and over
walls, trees, and buildings. Use this to your advantage to
protect against Biggunz and Jeeps. To throw a grenade a long
way, simply position the pointer further than needed.
<LI>Buildings can be destroyed even if you can't see them. For
instance, if a trooper is in Biggun and there is a building
slightly off the edge of the screen, roughly aim at the
building making sure the pointer is at the very edge of the
screen and fire.
<LI>Learn to control Jeeps and Skidooz early on (how to skid
them). In later levels you may need good control to hit ramps
at correct angles otherwise you can blow up if you hit walls. 
This is also useful to get away from shells, rockets, and
grenades.
<LI>An effective way of destroying snipers is to just run straight
towards them and shoot you guns. Don't waste grenades on them
unless it is necessary.
</OL>

<P>
Here is some information on where the Supa Dupa range of weapons can
be found. There is only one of each Supa Dupa product, so they're
spread out across the game from mission eight onwards.
</P>

<P>
Supa Dupa Missile Boosta - Mission 8, Phase 3. Go to the bottom
right corner of the screen and it's hidden behind a big bush.
</P>

<P>
Supa Dupa Bullet Proofa Vest - Mission 12, Phase 4. After you've
blown up the turrets and boarded the helicopter, fly to the top
right corner of the screen. The vest is hidden in the fat snowman.
</P>

<P>
Supa Dupa Rank Boosta - Mission 16, Phase 2. Top left corner of the
screen. It isn't hidden and it looks like a sign for a general (four
stars).
</P>

<P>
Supa Dupa Troopa Boosta - Mission 20, Phase 1. This is a big yellow
S in the middle of the screen on quite an easy level. It's still
worth getting since it improves your rank until you die and it gives
you a Bullet-Proofa Vest, Missile and Rank Boostas for the phase.
Watch out when you pick it up though, because there is a spike
nearby.
</P>

<P>
Supa Dupa Troopa Boosta - Mission 22, Phase 2. It's in the bottom
right corner of the screen and is guarded by a turret. It's best to
blow up the helicopter with grenades to start with, then rocket the
turret before getting the Troopa Boosta.
