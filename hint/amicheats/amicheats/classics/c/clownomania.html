<P>
Clown 'O' Mania is the adventure of Beppo the Clown. Beppo has spent
his whole life exercising the laugh muscles of thousands of
enraptured audiences. One evening in the empty circus stands he
finds a map showing the way to a country full of priceless crystal.
From this day forth Beppo gives up his life as a clown and decides
to set off on a journey into a new world. Accompany Beppo through
this amazing crystal wonderland with 70 levels full of riddles and
tasks, 3-D screen construction and soft-scrolling in all directions,
hilarious upside down play, great music during gameplay and lots of
enemies and surprises.
