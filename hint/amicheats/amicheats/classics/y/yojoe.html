<P>
While playing, type in 'WELTRAUMKAKALAKEN'. If you do this
correctly the screen will flash red. This tools up both players
with full weapons and you will also be able to press any of these
keys during the game:

</P>

<H2>TIPS</H2>

<H3>GENERAL</H3>

<P>
Collect as many weapons as possible (especially the petrol bombs),
you'll need them. The petrol bombs are hard to see on the level two
so keep an eye out for them. Try not to waste them.
</P>

<P>
Slides: To travel up hold the joystick diagonally up. When you're
sliding down, push the joystick diagonally up in the opposite
direction to slow your descent (ie if you're sliding down right,
push the joystick up left), which will help you avoid shooting
baddies.
</P>

<H3>WEAPONS</H3>

<P>
PUNCH: A bit feeble really
</P>

<P>
KICK: Good for killing thugs on columns
</P>

<P>
SHURIKENS (throw stars): Good for reaching a baddie on another
ledge that is level with you but is separated by a gap.
</P>

<P>
IRON BAR: Excellent weapon because you can also use this as you're
jumping. Unfortunately, you can't crawl through tunnels while
you're holding it and you can't climb ledges but it does allow you
to jump a little bit higher (useful for getting out of holes on
level 3).
</P>

<P>
NUMCHUCKAS: Not as powerful as the iron bar, but it is faster and
you can climb ledges while you're holding it. The bad news is that
you can't use it while you're jumping.
</P>

<P>
PETROL BOMBS: Great for killing enemies below or above you, or
enemies that crawls around your feet, such as the rats. Best used
on big baddies.
</P>

<H3>BADDIES</H3>

<H4>LEVEL 1</H4>

<P>
THUGS: Don't try to kill them with punches or kicks (unless they
are on small ledges) as they will jump over you. If you are level
with them use the iron bar, shuriken or nunchuckas. If you are
below or above them use a fire bomb, you can also use the iron bar
if you are below them.
</P>

<P>
BATS: Use anything except fire bombs and punching (unless they're
flying low). Iron bar is best.
</P>

<P>
RATS: If they are above you, use a fire bomb or the iron bar. If
you are level with them you can only use a fire bomb as this is the
only weapon that can touch the floor. Otherwise jump over them. If
they jump at you, punch them.
</P>

<P>
VAMPIRES: Use nunchuckas or iron bar. Don't punch them as this
takes too long.
</P>

<P>
SKELETONS: When they are rolling around as skulls punch them and
they will die with only one hit. Don't use the nunchuckas as they
will roll straight under them (draining a lot of energy).
</P>

<P>
BARRELS: Punch them, jump over them, firebomb them or walk along
between them. Don't use the nunchuckas as they're no use against
them (unless they're bouncing or falling).
</P>

<H4>LEVEL 2</H4>

<P>
MUMMIES: If you're unarmed, kick them. If armed the best weapons
to use are the nunchuckas and the iron bar.
</P>

<P>
GUNS: If you're sliding, kick them. If you're stood on a ledge (or
jumping up a slope) use the nunchuckas or the iron bar.
</P>

<P>
BLOBS: See Guns.
</P>

<P>
SNAKES: Use anything except petrol bombs (too precious to waste).
</P>

<P>
ONE-EYED JUMPING STONES: Use the nunchuckas, they kill them the
quickest.
</P>

<P>
EXPLODING SUNS: When you get close to them they flash for a few
seconds and then explode (horizontally and vertically) in four
directions (Dynablaster style). Simply run away from them when they
flash.
</P>

<H4>LEVEL 3</H4>

<P>
FIRING FACES: Try to kill these before you deal with anything else,
because their bombs/bullets drain a lot of energy. Use the iron
bar.
</P>

<P>
INDIANS: Jump over their weapons and kill them with the nunchuckas
or iron bar.
</P>

<P>
MOBILE BOMBER: This throws bombs at you very rapidly.
</P>

<P>
BLADE: Avoid at all cost.
</P>

<H4>LEVEL 4</H4>

<P>
NINJAS: If you're unarmed use kicks. Otherwise use nunchuckas,
don't use shurikens because they jump over them.
</P>

<P>
RED BLADES: Avoid (quickly!)
</P>

<P>
SUMOS: Use anything, nunchuckas are best.
</P>

<P>
WALL NINJAS: Try to avoid these or use the nunchuckas on them.
</P>

<P>
GREEN CHESTS: These are actually baddies in disguise, use the iron
bar or nunchuckas.
</P>

<H4>LEVEL 5</H4>

<P>
PUNKS WITH CHAIN: Get in close and quickly use the iron bar.
</P>

<P>
GUNMAN: Jump over his bullets and use the iron bar (one hit!)
</P>

<P>
KNIFEMAN: Duck under his knives and use the iron bar.
</P>

<P>
MINES: As with the suns on level two they explode when you walk
near them so just jump over them.
</P>

<H4>LEVEL 6</H4>

<P>
MISSILE MEN: These fire homing missiles from above you, so you can
only kill them with the iron bar.
</P>

<P>
KNIFEMAN: See Level Five.
</P>

<P>
PUNK WITH GHETTOBLASTER/IRON BAR: Use iron bar.
</P>

<P>
FLYING CYBORGS: This is a flying robot with Professor X's face, use
the iron bar.
</P>

<P>
ROLLING CYBORG: This is similar to the flying version but rolls
around on one wheel, use the iron bar.
</P>

<P>
MOBILE BOMBERS: See level 3.
</P>

<P>
ONE-EYED STONES: See Level 2.
</P>

<H2>SOLVE</H2>

<H3>LEVEL 1</H3>

<P>
Level one has three big baddies, by using this route you will only
meet two of them and can avoid the vicious blade-wielding zombie.
</P>

<P>
Go right, through the doors, kick painting, drop down and kick the
two ledges on the right to reveal some goodies. Down the stairs
(avoiding barrels) and collect nunchuckas at bottom. Hit the blocks
on the right to reveal some more goodies.
</P>

<P>
Back up the stairs, hit thugs with nunchuckas. Walk right, kill the
bat and collect the petrol bomb. Continue walking right (jumping
over the spikes), kill the skeletons, collect the petrol bomb and
walk through the door.
</P>

<P>
Hit the stairs, jump onto them and kill the painting, continue up
the stairs, walk right (killing the skeleton) and jump into the
shower to recharge your energy.
</P>

<P>
Walk left, jump onto the ledge, up the stairs, kick the painting,
walk left until you reach another skeleton. Kill it and continue up
the stairs killing both the thug and painting with the numchucks.
Drop down and while avoiding the rat, hit the treasure chest to
reveal lots of energy.
</P>

<P>
Jump back up onto the ledge and walk up a few steps, turn around and
jump onto the first right ledge. Continue right (killing skeletons
and vampires), drop into the water, right, down ledges (keep to the
LEFT) and at the bottom you will find a tunnel containing lots of
goodies.
</P>

<P>
Jump/climb back up the ledges (avoid spikes on right), drop back
into the water and jump onto the first ledge on the right. Facing
towards the first thug and throw a petrol bomb at him, then jump
onto the next ledge and repeat for the other thug. Switch to the
nunchuckas, now jump up onto the ledge on the left, walk left up the
stairs, kill bat, over bridge, kill thug and bat.
</P>

<P>
Continue left until you see a small column, walk towards it (hitting
the barrels as they fall with the nunchuckas). When the rat walks
to the left of the screen, jump over the column and quickly throw a
shuriken at it.
</P>

<P>
Kick the first ledge and continue up, jump over the thugs's knife,
kill him and the bat, and continue left (avoiding the spikes), kill
the skeletons and the thug, drop down and walk right to discover
another chest.
</P>

<P>
Go left, kill painting, collect goodies from ledge, continue left,
climb up ledges killing thugs (don't worry about energy loss), and
continue right where you'll find another chest (energy).
</P>

<P>
Go up, collect energy (if required), jump up onto right ledge and
continue right (killing the skeleton, the painting and the thug as
you do), jump up onto the next ledge and use a shuriken on the thug.
Collect the energy and drop down onto the next ledge where you will
find another chest.
</P>

<P>
Down, right, up, collect shuriken, up, kill thug, jump right onto
the top platform and crawl along until you reach the end. Climb up
the ledges (killing thugs with nunchuckas) until you arrive at the
top (collect energy if required), and walk left.
</P>

<P>
Kill vampire, jump over the first column and hit chest, jump across
gap, kill bat, over bridge, jump left onto the next platform. Kill
thugs, use petrol bomb on third thug and climb onto ledge. Jump
onto the right ledge and jump into the shower to recharge energy.
Continue down left (avoiding the rat and spikes) and kill the thug
with the nunchuckas. Go up, walk left and a big baddie will appear.
</P>

<P>
As you enter the room pieces of the platform will collapse (be
careful not to fall), when they have collapsed jump onto the second
highest piece (so that you are almost level with him) and throw a
petrol bomb at him as he jumps up (if you time your throw correctly
you'll only need one, otherwise you'll need to use two). He will
die without even hitting you once!
</P>

<P>
Jump up onto right ledge, walk right, up left, collect gas cans and
chainsaw, now jump up the platforms onto the roof (collecting gas
cans and destroying the barrel dispenser as you do). Switch to the
nunchuckas, walk right (DO NOT walk left) and slide down the roof.
</P>

<P>
Continue right (avoiding spikes) and jump up onto the right ledge
and collect the iron bar. Continue walking right (avoiding more
spikes and killing baddies with iron bar). Jump right over the
column and Count Cosimo will appear.
</P>

<P>
The best weapons to use are the iron bar, the chainsaw and the
petrol bomb. The best tactic is to quickly run to the far right of
the screen. He will then warp to that position, now jump onto the
nearest ledge (to the left) and (very quickly, before he moves
again) throw a petrol bomb at him. If you stand perfectly still, so
will he, but he will also get fried by the bomb! If you don't have
any petrol bombs your best chance is to just charge at him with the
chainsaw. When you've defeated him walk right and you have
completed level one.
</P>

<H3>LEVEL 2</H3>

<P>
Walk right (over the spikes), kill snake, up stairs, up right
(kicking/punching the blobs). Walk right and slide down the slope
(avoid the spikes and killing the guns by kicking them). When you
get to the bottom, collect the energy and walk left.
</P>

<P>
Kill mummy, slide down the next slope (killing the blobs), kill
mummies, up left (avoiding the guns), up left, and collect
nunchuckas. Kill sun before it explodes (or avoid it). Slide down
right, kill snake, up, up left (avoiding guns), up right, wait for
sun to explode.
</P>

<P>
Go right, here you will face the first big baddie, use a combination
of kicks and nunchuckas to kill him. When he dies a hole will open
above, climb up, walk through the hole, and slide down left.
</P>

<P>
Collect energy, slide down right, avoid sun, collect petrol bomb,
down, kill snake, walk up the stairs (killing the one-eyed stones,
and collect the energy they leave behind). Go down the ledges,
collect the petrol bomb and kill the snake.
</P>

<P>
Continue down stairs (jumping over one-eyed stones and collecting
goodies), avoid sun, down, collect petrol bomb. Kill stone and
snakes, collect energy, left (over spikes), kill stone, left, hit
chest.
</P>

<P>
You will now meet the second big baddie. Quickly (and carefully)
make your way across to the left of the screen and climb onto the
ledges, from there you can throw the petrol bombs to drain a lot of
the baddies' energy, then finish him off with kicks and the
shurikens (on the top ledge above you).
</P>

<P>
Walk right (crouching down), killing mummies, collecting energy and
goodies, up ledges (avoid sun and collect shuriken), kill snakes
with kicks and nunchuckas. Continue up until you arrive at the iron
bar, collect both that and the shuriken.
</P>

<P>
Now proceed right up the stairs (collecting goodies), down, down
next stairs, kill snakes, down, kill snake, walk right and you will
meet level two's Meanotaurus.
</P>

<P>
Some sections of the floor collapse (every second stone), so jump
across these sections (left and right) hitting the baddie with the
iron bar (jumping over him when he charges you, and remember the
spikes). When he stands still (snorting) hit him like crazy (but
get ready to jump). When you've killed him walk right to the exit.
</P>

<H3>LEVEL 3</H3>

<P>
This level is ENORMOUS. If you use this route you will avoid
meeting TWO of the big baddies, which of course only leaves one!
</P>

<P>
Walk left up the stairs. When you reach the top avoid the firing
face by crawling underneath it and collect the nunchuckas. Avoid
the second face and jump OVER the first face block.
</P>

<P>
Collect the energy, avoid the next face, continue left, jump ONTO
the second block and fall with it. Kill the indian, jump onto the
third block (avoiding the spikes above). You will notice that the
next block is above you. Walk slowly left, the block will shake and
then fall, climb over it. Step onto the next block and fall with
it. Kill the next indian and jump onto the next block. Avoid the
block above (as before) and climb over it. Stand on the next block
and continue left, collect the iron bar and the energy, now hit the
statue marked "hit" until it explodes.
</P>

<P>
Walk back right and you will discover that a new hole has appeared,
drop down this (collecting the goodies). Kill the mobile bomber,
walk left (jumping over columns (watch out for the falling block)).
</P>

<P>
Continue left, jump over the first block, kill indian, left, jump
over second block. Stand on the third and fall with it. When the
firing face closes jump out of the hole and hit it with the iron
bar.
</P>

<P>
Continue left, drop down (watch out for the blade), walk right and
avoid the four falling blocks (climbing over each one after they've
fallen), collect petrol bomb. Continue right, kill both the firing
face and the indian with the iron bar and collect the chainsaw.
</P>

<P>
Switch to the iron bar, jump onto the first step (watch out for the
spikes) and kill the firing face on the wall. Now jump from column
to column to over to the right, kill the next firing face and
collect the energy. Kill the next face and the indian, continue
right (jumping over the spikes), avoid the falling blocks, continue
right, kill indian, walk down the stairs (killing the face and the
mobile bomber).
</P>

<P>
Go right, collect shurikens, left and stand on the hinge of the
firing face, he will then open allowing you to hit him. Continue
left and hit the face above you. Walk down stairs, hit the chest
and jump up onto the left ledge, kill the indian. Continue left
jumping over ALL the blocks (killing the baddies with the iron bar)
until you reach a gap. Jump over this and jump across the columns
until you are standing on the fifth one. Drop down to the left and
you will land on a yellow rock, walk off this to the right and
continue travelling in a down-right direction (killing the baddies
on the way of course). Don't worry about falling as you can't fall
of the screen.
</P>

<P>
Continue in this direction until you get to what looks like a mine
shaft, drop down this and collect the petrol bomb. Kill the indian
and walk off the end of the ledge, onto the one below. Jump off
this platform to the left and you should land on three small
columns. Jump off this ledge onto the ledges on the right, then
jump up onto the ones on the left and jump across to the where the
skeleton is.
</P>

<P>
Jump over the first column and kill the indian, now jump over the
second column and drop down left, kill indian, walk left and drop
off the end. Kill next indian, jump left onto the next ledge below,
kill indian and jump left onto ledge above and kill face.
</P>

<P>
Switch to the nunchuckas and jump left onto the facing ledge, kill
indian and continue climbing up the ledges travelling towards the
left. Eventually you should reach another firing face in a tunnel,
kill it and mobile gun. Walk left along the tunnel (killing
baddies) and drop down (avoiding blade).
</P>

<P>
Walk right (killing bombers and faces) and drop down, walk left
(killing more bombers and faces), drop down and continue down
(avoiding blades) until you reach the bottom. Walk right, up
(killing faces) and slide down. Walk left, kill the face, collect
the first petrol bomb (collect the second only if you're very fast)
and go right.
</P>

<P>
Kill indian and bomber, up, left, up (avoid blade), kill indian,
right, down, right, kill bomber, jump up and hit the bottom face on
the statue (use iron bar) to remove the block on the right.
</P>

<P>
Jump over the column, down, walk right along the tunnel an you'll
now meet Marcos Cane. This guy is easy to beat, every time you try
to hit him he jumps over you, so switch to the iron bar. Now if you
stand on one spot, but keep turning around (ie face left, then
right, then left, etc.) and rapidly tap the fire button he'll keep
jumping into the path of your iron bar and die easily! Walk right
and you're at the exit!
</P>

next ledge and collect the nunchuckas.
</P>

<P>
Return to the third ledge, jump up onto the ledge on the left, up
the two steps and jump onto the ledge on the right. Collect the
shurikan, walk up the steps (avoiding the red blade that fires from
the wall). Once the blade has passed jump up vertically and this
will activate the next blade (which you can then easily avoid).
Jump up onto the next ledge and collect the energy and the shuriken.
Jump up onto the next ledge, walk up stairs, as you collect the
goodies quickly walk down a few steps and a blade will narrowly miss
you. Continue up in this fashion until you reach the top.
</P>

</P>

<P>
Walk right (killing ninjas) and walk up the stairs (collecting
shurikan) killing the ninjas until you reach some small ledges.
Climb up these onto the roof and walk left (killing the ninjas and

</P>

<P>
When you reach the edge of the roof turn around and walk back to the
small ledges, drop down, kill ninja, left, collect shurikan, kill

the ledge on the left. Go left, kill stones, down, walk left and
you will meet the first big baddie.
</P>

<P>
The best tactic is to stand on the barrel and hit it with the iron
bar (constantly of course). Wwhen the arms at either side shoot out
towards you (the baddies pause before they do), jump straight up,

strange metal object. Jump onto this, then jump up right and you
will finally meet Professor X himself.
</P>

<P>
Avoid his metal legs, the mines he drops, and the homing missiles he
fires. Only hit Professor X, not the legs. Uuse the chainsaw, the
iron bar and the shurikens (the bombs are no use) and with a LOT of
luck you should beat him. When you've defeated him walk right,
where your (and Nat's) girlfriends are waiting, and that's it,
