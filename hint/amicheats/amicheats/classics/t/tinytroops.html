<P>
On the troop selection screen, move the mouse pointer to the top
left of the screen and type a two digit number (02, 03, 05, 07 and
so on) and you'll go straight to that level.
</P>

<H2>TIPS</H2>

<H3>WARFARE</H3>

<P>
Learn to co-ordinate your troops attack patterns early, by
concentrating all of your firepower on one of the enemy troops at a
time you will kill his troops off faster, effectively reducing his
attack strength as his numbers are depleted. By reducing his
numbers quickly, rather than having loads of one on one battles
going on his troops will get far less shots in, safety in numbers is
the key.
</P>

<P>
Try to arrange things so that all your troops engage the enemy at
the same time, delivering one huge wave of destruction to knock out
the enemies individual troops quickly, and so allowing them to get
as few shots off at your troops as possible. Separate the
individual troop types into separate groups and then send your
slower troops on ahead of the faster units and use your timing to
make sure that the backup arrives on time.
</P>

<P>
Waste the enemies grenades for him. move a single trooper or a
small unit to within range of enemy grenadiers and use hit and run
tactics against them, let your troops take a pot shot or two at
them, wait until they throw their grenades and then quickly evacuate
the area then start the cycle again until they have depleted their
ammunition. With practice you can run circles around enemy
grenadiers moving your troops a short distance every time a grenade
is thrown to a position where your troops can carry on firing at the
enemy almost uninterrupted. If there is a big battle going on, the
easiest way to achieve this, is to use your Armageddon and retreat
buttons to move your troops backwards and forwards.
</P>

<P>
Keep an eye on your troops during and after battles by clicking on
them individually to check their energy bars, when they become too
weak send them back to base for repairs, then try to get them to
rejoin the others as quickly as possible, or leave them to guard the
base if things are too hot on the front line. Better to have
fighting fit troops than dead or crippled ones.
</P>

<P>
When the enemy has superior firepower, it can be better for you to
take the battle nearer to your base by clicking on the retreat icon,
when this happens, some of the enemies firepower will be absorbed by
your base which is capable of taking a lot of damage, and this also
allows you to send badly damaged troops in for repairs and get them
back into the action quickly.
</P>

<P>
When your troops are firing at a target, to speed up their firing
rate use the forced fire option , first click on an individual troop
or box around a large group of them, then click on the attack icon
(the clenched fist), then click on the target. Every time you do
this your troops will fire another shot in addition to their usual
attacks, so the faster you can do this, the faster your troops will
fire.
</P>

<P>
Mines can be cleared by sending a fast unit such as a foot soldier
towards it, and by using the two point click movement option (right
mouse button) send him towards the mine and immediately back the way
he came in a v shaped movement just before he comes into contact
with the mine, this will ensure he escapes with the minimal amount
of damage.
</P>

<P>
Don't forget that pillboxes near to enemy bases can be used to wipe
out the base with devastating firepower.
</P>

<P>
Flame-throwers can be used to fire through walls and obstacles.
</P>

<P>
The converge icon can be very useful for getting troops out of
trouble or to stop them from chasing enemy troops into dangerous
places.
</P>

<P>
Remember, only normal footsoldiers can be used to take over
pillboxes.
</P>

<P>
Using the repair icon is a quick way to send individual troops back
to base without sounding a full-scale retreat.
</P>

<P>
Pillboxes will usually miss a fast moving target, though may hit
other units that are following nearby.
</P>

<P>
By using the multi-click movement option (the right mouse button)
you can make a troop run around a pillbox to find out which
directions it can fire in, and so figure out which direction you
should attack from.
</P>

<H3>BATTLE LEVELS</H3>

<P>
BATTLES 1,2&3: These are good levels for learning some of the basic
principles of warfare and dont really need advice as they are very
straight forward.
</P>

<P>
BATTLE 04: The tip here is to send most of your troops across the
bridges quickly, leaving at least four of them behind to guard the
base, do not engage enemy troops on the way across, otherwise you
will find all the bridges have been blown and won't be able to
complete the level.
</P>

<P>
BATTLE 05: Ignore the Generals advice, he's an idiot! or an enemy
agent! Keep your troops behind to eliminate the hit squads that the
enemy sends across to attack your base before sending your boys over
there, LISTEN TO THE GENERAL AND YOU WILL DIE!! Though it is a good
idea to protect your transports by sending them straight across to
the other side, not too close to the enemy base though.
</P>

<P>
BATTLES 06-11: These are also very straight forward levels that
dont really need advice.
</P>

<P>
BATTLE 12 SNAIL BOSS: Easy, just set all your troops on it, they
can take him no problem, though prepare to move them out of it's way
if it decides to charge at them.
</P>

<P>
BATTLE 13: Don't bother with the transporter, it's not worth the
effort, just select a standard foot soldier instead, the extra
firepower will help you end this level quicker.
</P>

<P>
BATTLE 15: Easy enough this one, the "thermals" are created by
attacking one of the trees to the right of the players base, then
getting your glider to fly over it and across to the other side of
the lake. Next you must shoot the switch that controls the train to
switch it off though this must be done when the train is near the
control box, then your troops will be able to travel along the
tracks towards the enemies side. The next step should be to take
over the first pillbox and lure the enemy towards it by sending one
of your troops into the enemies base then immediately back to the
pillbox.
</P>

<P>
BATTLE 16: Another easy one, just look after your base and let them
come to you.
</P>

<P>
BATTLE 17: For the first few minutes of this level it is best to
barricade the bridge near your base with your tank and a few
grenadiers until the enemies second attack wave has been eliminated.
Next send your transporter with two grenadiers on board down to the
bottom of the map to the south of the pillbox (the enemy pillboxes
on this level are programmed to only fire upwards) they will be safe
there. Then attack the bottom pillbox from underneath with the two
grenadiers, when this one has been destroyed send them up the screen
to attack the next one. Once this one has been knocked out send
your gliders over to join them. Kill the enemy troops that will
attack them, to make this easier you can send your troops upscreen
to lure the enemy in front of the pillbox you have just destroyed,
and take it over. Next send these troops left and over the bridge
and down to come up underneath the enemy pillbox and destroy it,
then hit the Armageddon button! Some of your troops will run in
front of the remaining pillbox and get themselves wiped out, so
knock this out and take it over before allowing your troops to
attack the enemy base. To speed up the destruction of the base, use
the pillbox to attack it as well.
</P>

<P>
BATTLE 18: Ignore the Generals advice, he isn't the military genius
that he tries to make out! Firstly send the transporter with two
foot soldiers on board to land just behind one of the pillboxes
(again they are programmed to only fire upwards) and set them to
attacking it, while this is going on, send the transporter back over
the railway track and reload it with two more footsoldiers and do
the same to the other pillbox. Then take over both pillboxes and
let them wipe out the enemy troops. Next send the transporter with
another two footsoldiers on board towards the train control box, hit
the switch to turn it off, send all your troops over to kill the
remaining enemy soldiers, and finally hit the Armageddon button,
total victory! You will also only need one transporter to complete
this mission.
</P>

<P>
BATTLE 19: This level can be completed just by letting the enemy
troops come to you again, blockade the bridge next to your base and
let him run into your troops. Or you could send your troops down to
the first pillbox and take it over if you wish to end the level
quicker, and then maybe move onto the next pillbox and take that one
as well either way is just as effective.
</P>

<P>
BATTLE 20: First action should be to take over the pillbox then
send a troop to fire a shot at the enemy tank, and then make him run
towards the pillbox to lure the tank onto it, the rest of this level
is easy.
</P>

<P>
BATTLE 21: Use your footsoldiers to take out the enemy troops on
your side of the tracks (not forgetting to waste the enemies
grenades while doing this). Next stop the train between the two far
right pillboxes, hide two grenadiers behind the train where they
will be protected from the pillboxes fire, and throw grenades over
the top of the train to knock out both pillboxes. Take over the far
right pillbox then after clearing some of mines lure the remaining
enemy troops towards it and finally press the Armageddon button.
</P>

<P>
BATTLE 22: Send your troops diagonally down to the right to fill
the gap near your base, wipe out the troops that the enemy sends
against you then move all your troops down towards the bridge to
attack the enemy there. Next Armageddon, simple.
</P>

<P>
BATTLE 23: Quite a hard one this, I found the best troop
combination for this level was three gliders, both grenadiers, the
troop transporter and four footsoldiers. The first step is to send
your four footsoldiers to the right to take care of the four enemy
grenadiers that fly over in the transporters, take out the top two
first after sending one troop on ahead of the others to waste their
grenades. Next send your three gliders up the cliff, landing them
right on the ledge so they don't stay in the air too long and get
shot down, use them to take out the anti- aircraft gun. Send the
rest of your troops over to join them in the transporter also taking
the opportunity to repair any damaged troops, though leave the
grenadiers behind for now, then move all your troops to the far left
of the map. When the enemy tanks start heading towards your troops
send the grenadiers over in the transporter to land just past the
pillbox near the enemy base and attack the pillbox. Once the
pillbox is destroyed, send any remaining troops up towards the enemy
base by pressing the Armageddon button, taking over the pillbox on
the way. The remaining enemy troops should chase your troops and
get wiped out by the pillbox, though if they don't it doesn't matter
as the mission objective is to destroy the enemy base.
</P>

<P>
BATTLE 24: As the General said, no advice really needed, though
don't send your troops straight across, attack the enemy as he flies
over to your side of the tracks.
</P>

<P>
BATTLE 25 TRAIN BOSS: Just use a few troops at a time to attack the
train and scatter the rest of them between the different layers of
tracks. If you try to use all of your troops to attack the train at
once, you will find it very difficult to control them, with a lot of
them putting themselves directly in the trains path and getting
themselves killed. It will also be much easier if you have the game
speed on slow. There is a large element of luck on this level, so
just keep trying till you get it right.
</P>

<P>
BATTLE 26: Ignore the crab, it isn't a threat, just let them come
to you, protect your base, then Armageddon.
</P>

<P>
BATTLE 27: Protect your base while using one of your foot soldiers
to lure enemy troops towards your forces, and wipe them out. Next
send all your ground forces up past the crab (being careful to avoid
it of course) and take out the anti-aircraft gun. The sonic boom is
designed to be used as a decoy for the anti-aircraft gun to shoot at
while you send your flying units towards it, but this is unnecessary
as the whole level can be completed with ground units. Ignore the
pillbox it isn't important, then just hit the Armageddon button.
</P>

<P>
BATTLE 28: This level can be completed in less than a minute,
simply send the mine layer down to the door of the castle, when the
door blows, click on the p.o.w. and then click on the repair icon
to send him back to tour base, should any enemy vehicles attack the
mine layer or the p.o.w. just set the rest of your troops onto
them.
</P>

<P>
BATTLE 29: I found the best troop combination for this battle was
to select all the tanks, both trucks and the flame-thrower. First
step is to intercept the convoy, you must hit the lead truck before
it gets to the base, or the mission will be a failure, send all the
tanks and the trucks to attack the lead truck. keep your
flame-thrower back for a moment then use him to attack the enemy
flame-thrower. The rest is easy, try to take out the convoy before
it reaches the enemy base, that way you won't have to face the
troops that the enemy has there, though you should have enough
troops to be able to face them as well. Next use the trucks to get
the pods and tow them back to your base to finish.
</P>

<P>
BATTLE 30: Take all your fast troops (cars and foot soldiers) to
the right to attack the enemy troops that will position themselves
there, leaving your tanks behind to protect the base. Then wait for
the enemy mines to detonate before sending your fast troops down the
right hand edge of the map towards the enemy base, attacking any
enemy troops you encounter along the way then wipe out the enemy
base, easy. For extra satisfaction your four tanks (should you
select them on the troop selection screen) are quite capable of
taking out the stompers that the enemy will send against your base.
</P>

<P>
BATTLE 31: Firstly use your trampoline to send your flame thrower
and foot soldiers over the rocks to the right and kill the two enemy
foot soldiers and grenadier. next send these same troops up the map
to attack the enemy pillbox from the right (this one is programmed
to only fire to the left). Wipe out the rest of the enemy troops by
luring them towards the pillbox, then free the p.o.ws. and return
them to your base.
</P>

<P>
BATTLE 32: You don't need the trampoline for this mission, Firstly
wait by your base and destroy the enemy troops that will attack it,
though move your grenadiers away from the battle so that they don't
waste their grenades. Next use one of your grenadiers to push the
rock up to the pillbox, being careful to avoid the crab, send your
other grenadier up to join him and use them both to attack the
pillbox from behind the rock. Once this is accomplished send your
other troops up to join them and use a foot soldier to take over the
pillbox, lure the rest of the enemy troops into range of your
pillbox and destroy them, then send your foot soldiers up and around
the castle, then to the right of the enemy base and down to attack
the other pillbox from the right. when this is done use a truck to
get the pod and return it to your base, again being careful to avoid
the crab.
</P>

<P>
BATTLE 33: Only one transporter is needed for this mission.
Firstly load your flame thrower and a foot soldier onto your
transporter and send them to attack the enemy missile launcher.
Then reload them back onto the transporter and return them back to
your base, while you are doing this, send one foot soldier to attack
the pillbox from the small gap just to the left of it then take it
over. Finish the level by luring the rest of his forces towards the
pillbox.
</P>

<P>
BATTLE 34: Forget about flying troops or transporters, just select
grenadiers and foot soldiers. First get all of your troops into a
nice tight formation then send them up the map so that they are
parallel with the right hand enemy pillbox, next storm the pillbox,
just get your troops to attack it, you will lose a few of your
troops but who cares? they are expendable. Next take over the
pillbox and let it wipe out most of the enemy troops and then lure
the rest of them towards it. you can then finish this level quickly
by taking over the left-hand pillbox and setting it to attack the
enemy base.
</P>

<P>
BATTLE 35: Protect your base and let them come to you again, move
your troops into a tight formation in the narrow passage just above
your base, send out foot soldiers to lure the enemy towards your
main forces then attack the pillboxes from above, next retrieve the
pods to complete the level, remember to look after your trucks if
they die then the level can't be finished.
</P>

<P>
BATTLE 36: Very difficult to explain without drawing a diagram but
I shall try. After killing the enemy troops that attack your base,
send your troops one at a time so that they don't get tangled up
with each other and get shot by the pillbox to the bottom right of
the map. Next use a foot soldier to push the rock up towards the
crab. Once the crab has stopped moving take out the enemy soldiers
nearby. To take out the next pillbox further up you will have to
skirt your troops one at a time around it on the right hand side to
get above it to the left. Next position your trampolines to enable
your troops to get to the anti- aircraft gun, skirt them around the
right hand side of the map so they don't get wiped out, then use the
trampolines to send your men into the enemy base to take over the
two pillboxes, wipe out the base to finish the level.
</P>

<P>
BATTLE 37: Start by protecting your base from the first couple of
waves that the enemy will send against you, then use foot soldiers
to take out the mines, make sure all your troops are in a good state
of repair then wipe out the rest of the enemy troops. You must keep
an eye on your mine layer and the truck, if either of these are
destroyed then you will not be able to complete the mission. Next
use the truck to retrieve the pod and then the mine layer to blow
the prison gate, send the p.o.w. back to base to finish the level.
</P>

<P>
BATTLE 38 LOBSTER BOSS: Click on one of your troops then use the
converge icon to group them all together, next send one of your
troops to one of the corners of the map, well away from the enemy.
By keeping this troop selected after the rest of your troops have
started attacking the lobster, you will be able to use the converge
icon to send your troops running towards him whenever they run into
trouble.
</P>

<P>
BATTLE 39: Very easy this one, send two troops immediately to take
over both pillboxes, let the rest of your troops eliminate the
forces that he will send against your base, then lure the rest of
them towards the pillboxes.
</P>

<P>
BATTLE 40: Protect your base for a while then send your troops
round the top of the maze eliminating enemy troops as you go. Next
send them into the maze one step at a time in small groups so they
don't get tangled and start roaming around, kill whatever you find
on the way. The green block needs to be pushed out of the way
before you can send a troop to rescue the prisoner, then send the
prisoner back to base, make sure he goes round the top of the map
unless the pillbox near the enemy base has been destroyed.
</P>

<P>
BATTLE 41: Protect your base and wait for the enemy to come to you,
some of them will be killed while crossing the car track. Next push
the block to just below and to the right of your base onto the
track, then wait for the all the cars to run into it. Send all of
your troops to the right or left of the map avoiding the pillbox
which can fire in all directions then down to the bottom and finally
Armageddon.
</P>

<P>
BATTLE 42: You don't need to worry about moving the blocks, just
protect your base and wait for them to come to you again, wasting
the enemies grenades and repairing your troops as needed.
</P>

<P>
BATTLE 43: Stay and protect your base and let the enemy soldiers
push the block onto the car track. Once the first wave of enemy
troops have been wiped out attack the ones that are guarding the
prisoner while using one of your foot soldiers to free the prisoner,
send the prisoner back to base. Ignore the troops that the enemy
has guarding his base.
</P>

<P>
BATTLE 44: Carefully send both of your trucks upwards across the
track, then to the right across the track there, next use your tanks
or other troops to block the path that is between the enemy trucks
and their base, the enemy trucks will then try to go around your
vehicles into the path of the cars on the track and get themselves
wiped out. Get the cargo pods and return them back to your base.
</P>

<P>
BATTLE 45: Only advice that can be given for this level is BE VERY
CAREFUL!
</P>

<P>
BATTLE 46: Forget about tanks for this level, you need to move
quickly for this one. Firstly you must move your troops straight up
to the top of the map using any objects along the way to protect
your troops from the pillboxes, immediately attack the topmost
pillbox from above, ignoring the enemy troops, take over the pillbox
and direct it to attack the missile launcher, you must do this very
quickly before the missile launches or you will lose. The rest is
relatively easy, rescue the top left p.o.w., then send your
remaining troops to attack any more enemy troops that may be left,
send the p.o.w. down through the top of the maze along with another
footsoldier to rescue the other p.o.w. inside the maze, then send
both p.o.ws. back to base to finish the battle.
</P>

<P>
BATTLE 47: Move your troops at least half a screen away from your
base to protect them from the kamikaze attacks, wait till the main
enemy invasion force arrives then retreat your troops back to the
base, wipe out the enemy quickly before they destroy your base.
Repair your troops then wipe out the rest of his army.
</P>

<P>
BATTLE 48: Send one of your foot soldiers up to the enemy base
carefully avoiding the cars when crossing the road, then carefully
retreat him back to your base If you're lucky, most of the enemy
troops will be wiped out while moving across the tracks, if you're
not, your troops will be able to take care of them anyway, rescue
the p.o.ws. and get them safely back to base and you're home free.
</P>

<P>
BATTLE 49: Move your troops along the inside lane of the track, all
the cars are running around the outside track, so your troops will
be safe there. When you get near to the enemy base, leave most of
your troops behind and just send one fast troop into the enemy base
then back to your main forces, try to lure the enemy troops into the
path of the cars to wipe out as many as possible and use your troops
to take care of the rest of them, destroy the base to finish the
level.
</P>

<P>
BATTLE 50: Protect your base from the first wave of enemy troops
making sure to take out the flame-thrower first, though try to save
some grenades to take out the flame-thrower inside the maze. Next
take out the two pillboxes attacking them from above though don't
get too close to the flame-thrower near the left-hand one, then take
over the left hand pillbox and set it onto the flame-thrower
straight away and leave it to wipe out the rest of the troops around
that area. Once this is done send any grenadiers into the maze to
lob grenades over the wall at the flame-thrower inside, return all
of your troops to base and carry out any necessary repairs on your
troops before sending a footsoldier over the car track to lure the
troops there back to your main forces at your base. Eliminate any
troops that the enemy has left then retrieve the pods to finish the
level.
</P>

<P>
BATTLE 51 DINO-BOSS: Send your troops against this one in groups of
four and it should be quite easy, remember to keep one of your
troops separate from the rest and constantly selected so you can use
the converge icon to get the rest of your troops out of trouble.
</P>

<P>
BATTLE 52: Don't use the tank for this level, just select the
flame- thrower, grenadiers, a foot soldier and a trampoline.
Firstly, send all your troops to the left so that it is parallel
with the left hand pillbox then charge it, send all your troops to
attack it, you will lose a couple of your troops doing this, but you
can afford to sacrifice a few. After repairing any damaged troops
move your them to the bottom of the ramp and attack the tank there,
then attack the car that will come towards your troops and again
send any damaged troops back for repairs. You must have at least
four foot soldiers for the next part or you won't manage this level,
and you must also have used up all of your grenades and all of the
flame-throwers fuel (if he is still alive) so that you can use your
troops to take over the pillbox Use the trampoline to send the
footsoldiers up onto the edge next to the bread bin, then use them
one at a time to take over the pillbox next to the battleship. You
will probably lose all of your troops doing this unless you are very
quick with the forced fire option (repeatedly clicking on the
pillbox then on the attack icon and then on the battleship).
</P>

<P>
BATTLE 53: Don't use any vehicles for this one, select grenadiers,
footsoldiers and a trampoline. Firstly use the trampoline to send a
foot soldier up to take over the pillbox near your base and use that
to wipe out the enemy units that will attack tour base. Next move
the trampoline down the map and use this to move all of your troops
onto the next raised level, attack all enemy units you encounter.
</P>

<P>
BATTLE 54: Send all of your troops including both trucks up the map
then across and down to the bottom of the ramp, destroy the enemy
tank and truck that are heading for the ramp, retrieve the pod and
return it to base.
</P>

<P>
BATTLE 55: I suggest that you play this level with the game speed
set on slow. Forget using the tank in your troop selection, use
bugskis and grenadiers. Firstly move all of your bugskis diagonally
up and left of your base a little way so that the enemy bugskis fire
will be absorbed by your base, next leave one of your grenadiers
where they first appear and send the rest of them down to the bottom
left of the map so that only one of them will use his grenades on
the two enemy foot soldiers that will trampoline towards them, when
they have both been wiped out and you have taken care of the enemy
bugskis, send all of your grenadiers to the right just beneath the
battleship and use the forced fire technique to use all of their
ammunition as quickly as possible before they get wiped out. Once
all your grenades are gone, leave your grenadiers where they are to
draw some of the battleships fire and send your remaining bugskis at
the battleship one at a time, sending them back for repairs as they
need it.
</P>

<P>
BATTLE 56: No advice really needed for this one, just protect your
base for a while, try not to waste grenades unless necessary, then
give them a good kickin.
</P>

<P>
BATTLE 57: This is another level that needs to be played with the
game speed on slow, unless your name is Data and your bloody mouse
works (sadly Im not (well not quite anyway), and mine didnt). First
you must immediately move your troops to the right where the two
movable sponge barricades are, ignore the two vehicles that are
speeding towards your base and get your kamikaze past the sponge
blocks without moving them. Next push the barricades and close the
gap quickly, set the kamikaze onto one of the enemy flame-throwers,
hopefully when he detonates he will take out all three of them.
Wait for the second wave of flame- throwers to arrive, keeping the
barricades in place and wipe them out then get your troops back to
base quickly to take care of the two cars that are attacking your
base. Carry out any necessary repairs while you are there and get
your troops back to the barricades quickly. With a bit of
persuasion you can re-open the barricades and send one of your
footsoldiers towards the enemy base in order to lure the last couple
of flame-throwers back towards the barricades, close the gap quickly
and hopefully you will have enough grenades left to finish them off,
if not be very careful.
</P>

<P>
BATTLE 58: Dont bother with the kamikaze for this level, use all
the grenadiers and make up the rest with bugskis. First move your
grenadiers up the map near to the battle ship and send them all in
to attack it, use the forced fire option to speed up their attacks,
then move all the surviving grenadiers (normal footsoldiers are now
useless) to the right and use them to attack any enemy bugskis that
are in range. Next use one of your bugskis to lure as many of his
towards your base one at a time as time will allow before he begins
his main assault, then wipe out his remaining forces.
</P>

<P>
BATTLE 59: Fairly easy level this one as long as it is done
reasonably quickly. Firstly send your troops to the right and take
out the bottom pillbox, ignore the one above it as you dont need to
go anywhere near it. Next take out the enemy flame-throwers at the
bottom of the ramp with your kamikaze then send your troops up the
ramp to the higher level and position your flame-throwers before the
barricade so that they can fire through it and take out the three
enemy soldiers on the other side. Push one of the barricades up to
the pillbox and position your grenadiers behind it so they can take
it out, send your troops to the left and down to the missile taking
out any enemy troops along the way, ignoring the enemy base.
</P>

<P>
BATTLE 60: Wipe out the enemy forces on the floor level, though
give the battleship a wide berth, it may shoot the p.o.w. while
trying to hit your troops. While you are doing this the enemy
forces on the upper level will be grouping around the battleship,
you can actually take these troops out from the floor level on the
left hand side, to do this, group your footsoldiers next to them
where they are wandering around to the left of the battleship, you
will be out of the battleships range here, which is why you need to
do this on the left side, not the right, the idea is to keep one of
your footsoldiers selected and standing next to the enemy troops and
just keep clicking on the converge icon to hold your troops in place
so they wont go running off trying to attack them from a better
position. Next attack the pillbox after carrying out repairs on
your troops, the rest is simple, rescue the p.o.ws. the one near
the battleship needs to be evacuated quickly before it gets wiped
out, dont try to attack the battleship you cant reach it, thats
about all there is to it.

BATTLE 61: Easy level, no special tactics needed, just go round
killing the little buggers.

<P>
BATTLE 62: This is another level that needs to be played with the
game speed on slow. Use your flame thrower to take out the first
kamikaze that attacks your base, away from the rest of your troops
and base, you will lose your flame-thrower doing this but it is
necessary. Next move all of your troops away from your base and let
the second kamikaze through without attacking it, your base will
take some damage but it can take it, use your vehicles and normal
footsoldiers (not grenadiers) to take out the enemy grenadiers when
they get to your base. After this take out the four enemy
flame-throwers carefully using your grenadiers one at a time from a
distance then use a footsoldier to push the sponge barricade across
the cooker top and under the battleship which will carry on trying
to shoot at the troop you use to put the barricade in place as long
as you leave him there. Next use your grenadiers to destroy the
battleship to finish the level.

BATTLE 63: You must be very quick to start on this one, it is best
to start the level with the game speed turned down. First move is
to find the missile launcher and destroy it before it takes out your
base, so you will need fast vehicles for this part of the level.
Send three cars round to the bottom of the ramp and your grenadiers
to stand on floor level to the left of the launcher. Next send a
fast car up to the flame throwers and fire a shot at them then send
him immediately back to base for repairs to lure them away from the
launcher, then wipe out the launcher and the two enemy grenadiers
that are there. The rest of the level is easy as long as you give
the pillboxes and the battleship a wide berth.

BATTLE 64 KITCHEN DUCK BOSS: The best way to deal with this one is
to scatter the troops at the start of the level, the send your
troops in to attack the boss, one or two at a time. This makes
moving your troops out of his way a lot easier, and ensures that you
don't have troops fighting amongst themselves trying to find an
unoccupied place to fire from, it also means that troops won't
become suicidal and place themselves right in the path of the duck
whenever he decides to charge his attackers.
