<P>
On the filling screen pop up a file and instead of entering your
name type in "Let me cheat!" (making sure you include the capital
and the exclamation mark). Now instead of pressing return, hit the
Reset button. The number next to the losses columm will now be 1,
and this shows you are in the cheat mode. Now type your name in and
you can get into the game as normal.
</P>

<P>
In this cheat mode there are two major facilities. If you press the
left 'Amiga' key and 'W' during a scenario you will automaticly win
the battle. And if you go to the map screen screen during the game,
and select a desination using the mouse, then pressing the left
'Amiga' key followed by the number of the unit you are playing
(1,2,3 or 4), that unit will instantly go to the the destination
marked. This cheat mode is the same for all three games in the Team
Yankee series.
