<P>
On the title screen, hold down 'G' and 'H'. Now release 'G' and
press fire. After you press fire you can release 'H'. Now during
play, whenever you need more energy go all the way to the right,
press down on the joystick, and press 'G' (while still in the
crouched position). This will refill your life meter. This cheat
doesn't work on the A1200 due to the way the keyboard is designed
internally.
