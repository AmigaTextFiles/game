<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
An ancient land is in turmoil since the king and his young child
disappeared 20 years ago. You as a hero-for-hire, learn much of the
distinctions between appearance and reality while completing your
quests. Over 60 characters, detailed cities and towns.
</P>

<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
Brown scroll kills all monsters on the screen, white scroll freezes
them for a limited time (act now!), green scroll teleports (use only
twice), white potion random energy refuel, green potion complete
refuel. Boots of speed are in treela, magic axe is in lankwell.
Save your game often! When playing at night, turn up the contrast
and brightness settings (it won't make the game any smarter,
though!).
</P>

<H2>SOLVE</H2>

<P>
First make your dude, I chose the Knight. Then when the game is
start go down the stairs and head for the man standing near the bar.
Ask him questions about Kingdom, and then you will have more options
to ask people. After this, go to the room to the left hand corner
of the bar. Talk to the Prior and he will ask you if you want to
take a mission for him, answer yes. Now leave the city by exiting
the inn and following the path toward the north If you keep
following the path (keep close to the top of the path) you will meet
a woodsman, talk to the dude and ask him of orcs, continue asking
him questions, go into his house and take the dagger. You can now
attack from far away. Now continue following the path, making sure
you check every hole you can see going into the forest toward the
north. Once you find it, follow the forest path and soon you will
reach the orcs clearing. Don't be fool, just run toward the urn in
the southwest corner of the screen and take the urn. Now head back
and give the Prior what you found. (Save your game now by going to
the inn and asking for lodging.)
</P>

<P>
The Prior sould send you to the castle to the se of the city. Enter
and look for the dude sitting on the throne. Talk to him, he will
send you on a quest for the 2nd object of power, The Tablet. Exit
the town toward the south and find you will find aa city ( it will
take a while head toward the east and south paths when you can).
This is not really a city but only an Inn, Save your game here.
Continue east and north when you can, will take you to another city,
talk to everyone and save your game. Now head toward the south and
follow the path (going east and south when possible) you will soon
reach the town. (Again save your game.) Talk to everyone and you
will soon learn about a trap door under the cellar. Enter the
cellar (behind the Bartender) and look for a thing on the wall (in
the ne alcove), this will allow access to the castle. Look for the
stair going up, be sure to stay away from the guards. Once you are
on the second stair look for the tablet, it is in a small room with
no doors. Now leave and save game.
</P>

<P>
Go back to the regeant and give him the tablet. (If you try talking
with someone the stone will think you are talking to it, ask High
King.) Your next mission is to find the assassin of the high king.
Go south from the original city (don't follow paths) and you will
soon hit water. follow the water toward the east and north and you
will find a bridge. Pass the bridge and head south, look for the
assassin's hut, it is around here. Enter it and ask the assassin of
High King, he will give you a scroll. Now exit his hut and head
toward the water (don't pass bridge). Follow water east. Don't
worry where it turns, just follow it. Soon you will reach the
Tablet city again. Enter the castle and go onto the 3rd floor.
Give the scroll to the dude in the throne, the warden. He will tell
you there is a spy. Exit the castle and talk to everyone and follow
up on every tip. If you do you will have an obtion to ask about
spying. Wait until nightfall (wait in castle) and go to the guard
to your right. Ask him about spying he will attack you, kill him
and take the scroll. Give the scroll to the warden, he will send
you on a mission to save his son.
</P>

<P>
Head toward the north and west when possible and you will soon find
a city with a duke in one house, he will tell you the warden's son
is near the mountains. Go toward the east (forget the paths) until
you hit mountainss. Now head south, you will see a big building.
Enter it, kill everyone and pick up the scroll on the table. Go
upstair with the key you'll find and free the son. He will tell you
to see Arial, he is in a tower. Go find him.
</P>

<P>
Once you find him, he will tell you to go to the ruins. But first
you need to go to the inn (the one that is only an inn, nothing
else) and talk to the guy next to the bartender, he will tell you
stuff, and soon you will have to obtion holy water. Save game and
experiment with the scroll you found. Go to every city and search
out the Prior Kane, he will give you holy water. If you happen to
find a man who offers to sell you an axe in your experiment. GREAT!
</P>

<P>
Now go back to the lone Inn. Save game and head to the middle of
the inn (near it's south wall). Now walk straight south until you
see ruins, you will find a door in the ruins. Enter it and search
around making sure you press all those knobs on the ground. You
will soon find the Evil Liche. Kill him by using holy water. Now
go back to Arial.
</P>

<P>
He will send you the the Crater. Find the Crater and enter it.
Again being sure you press all the knobs. Ok, now go find the
monestary in the mountains, enter it with the key your found in the
Crater. Now go searching around for an orb. Use the orb on the
Evil Cleric and you have won the game.
