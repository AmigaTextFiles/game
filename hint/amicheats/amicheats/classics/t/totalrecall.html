The life meter will still decrease, but you won't die. If you fall
in a hole you will still die!

First, go right, collect the gun, then run to the right and jump
over the first lift. Keep running to the next lift, go up three
times and walk onto the lift that is waiting when you arrive. Go
up, then left and collect the gun. Now go right to the next lift
and down once. Go onto the next lift, and go up as far as you can
see. Walk right, off the lift and run right to the next lift,
picking up the object on the way. Go up on the lift, run right and
go down three times on the next one that you come to. Run left, go
down on the lift and run left again to collect the object. Run
right to the first lift and go up, then go to the next lift and go
up twice. Run right and go up on the lift once, then run and jump
right. Collect the heart, run right,drop down through the hole and
run to the exit.
