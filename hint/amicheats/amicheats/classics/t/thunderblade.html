Control the world's most sophisticated attack helicopter in the
home-computer adaptation of Sega's #1 blockbuster arcade hit. Fly
over skyscrapers, mountains, deserts and the sea as you attempt to
accomplish the near-impossible mission of defeating the enemy.

<P>
On the high score table, type "CRASH" for your name. Press the
'HELP' key to skip levels.

<P>
To skip levels type in "CRASH" when the game has completely
finished loading, and the picture from the film {Blue Thunder}
appears. On pressing the 'H' key, the screen should flash to
signify that the cheat is active. To access the next level press
'HELP'.
