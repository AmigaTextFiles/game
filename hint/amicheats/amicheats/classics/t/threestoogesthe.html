orphanage from the clutches of the evil banker who wants to
foreclose. Rescue the old lady and her three beautiful daughters.

<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
Slow down the scene selector by entering the slapping game and
pulling curly's ear till time runs out.
</P>

<P>
When your on the 'Doctor Wanted' stage of the game, drive your
buggies at the same speed as the male nurse pushing the patient,
keeping a bit behind them. This enables you to run up a high
score without danger of collision.
