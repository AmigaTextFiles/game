<H2>TIPS</H2>

<H3>GRASSLAND LEVELS</H3>

<P>
MISSION 1: Slaughterhouse<BR>
Not exactly hard this one. The enemy are unarmed and seem to
positively enjoy running right in front of your big powerful guns.
I won't insult you by saying any more.
</P>

<P>
MISSION 2: Greande Test<BR>
Easy to complete, of course, but it's worth noticing that grenades
can be thrown over obstacles like sandbags and trees - missiles just
bang into them. Worth remembering for later (honest).
</P>

<P>
MISSION 3: Tank Test<BR>
Forget trying to shoot the enemy - just run them over in your tanks.
The enemy soldiers make a lot more mess that way. Nice squelcy
noise too. I hope these tips are proving hugely helpful so far!
</P>

<P>
MISSION 4: Chopper Squad<BR>
Right, a bit of tricky manoeuvering needed here. First, get a
couple of choppers from the landing point nearby and run your squad
to the sandbagged bunker and ammo dumps in the NE. This should
provide cover and extra ammo for your besieged team. Then send out
a chopper to dispose of as many enemies as possible. When this
chopper is destroyed send out the next one. With a bit of luck
there shouldn't be many enemies left by the time they reach the rest
of your team, who should be able to get rid of the remainder quite
easily. Be extremely careful not to blow the sandbags up with
missiles and remember not to blow yourself up either.
</P>

<P>
MISSION 5: Air Support<BR>
Your first chance to use an airstrike. As soon as the level starts,
call in a strike at 60-50, then jump in the chopper just south of
your start point and set out alone to dispatch the rest of the foe.
</P>

<P>
MISSION 6: Hot And Bothered<BR>
Supposedly an introduction to the considerable joys of
flamethrowing, but due to the flamethrower's limited range it is
actually much easier to just run the enemy down in your APCs.
There's also a chopper just south of where you start if you fancy a
bit of shooting action as well.
</P>

<P>
MISSION 7: Operation Cobra<BR>
Chinook time. Your base has been taken over and you need to get it
back. Use your single guy to pick up a chopper from 34-52, quickly
call in your Chinook to 40-20 or thereabouts and set off to engage
the enemy soldiers who are running towards the SE corner of the map.
A bit of sharp shooting from this chap should make life easy for
your reinforcements.
</P>

<P>
MISSION 8: Flush 'Em Out<BR>
Enemies at 70-70 need waxing. Quite a tough one this. Run both
soldiers to somewhere near the combat point, then send just one of
them in to set fire to the eastern section of the trees surrounding
the enemy position (this gives you more room for manoeuvre if things
don't go too well and you need to chicken out). Then shelter behind
one of the remaining trees waiting for one or two of the enemy to
run reasonably close to you so you can charge out and incinerate
them with the flamethrower. If your soldier gets hit a couple of
times, run him up to 63-20, where he should find a fine range of
crates crammed with health and ammo boosters to restore an ailing
hero. The just return to the fray. Of course, if your first
soldier pops his cloggs, you've still got the other one to finish
off the fun.
</P>

<P>
MISSION 9: Operation Yellow Chickens<BR>
Dead easy. Just kill a few bad guys with your APC and they'll be
soiling their trousers, waving their white flags and running to your
prisons in no time. As soon as this happens, you just, erm,
basically stand there.
</P>

<P>
MISSION 10: Operation Wildgoose<BR>
Large HQ at 90-60 needs cleaning up. You'll need all your weapons
here. First run some men over to the ammo dumps on the right hand
side of the map, and stock up on missiles. These can be used to
wipe out enemy helicopters in the SW and more importantly, destroy
incoming enemy chinooks before they can drop their cargo of soldiers
(each chinook needs to be hit by 8-10 missiles). The chinooks are
called in when the enemy gets to under 10 soldiers. So you'll need
to attack the base with grenades and guns blazing first, and then
scroll the screen frantically round to spot the incoming chinook as
soon as you hear the sinister laugh which tells you it's on its way.
</P>

<P>
MISSION 11: Operation Freedom Part 1<BR>
Easy. Rescue your trapped squards by grenading the prison in the
bottom right of the map, keeping a close eye on the grenade towers
nearby. Once your squad are released (move them away from the
grenade towers pronto), they should make fairly light work of the
opposition.
</P>

<P>
MISSION 12: Operation Freedom Part 2<BR>
Your stupid men have been captured again, there's a load or enemy
choppers on the way and you've got a spy in your midst. The spy is
actually the guy you control when you start the mission, so quickly
switch to another soldier and waste the traitor. Then find the
prison at 78-81 and destroy it to rescue your team. Kill any
marauding enemies and retire one squad to the north edge of the map.
Equip the other squad with missiles from 55-81 and send them out one
at a time to wipe out the plundering helicopters. Try and separate
the men you leave behind so they aren't all killed at once if they
suffer a surprise attack whilst you are away.
</P>

<P>
MISSION 13: Operation Certain Death<BR>
Unaccountably easy. Just attack opposition with tanks or
helicopters to make them surrender. Drop your helpers in at 10-10
because it's particularly scenic just there. Air strikes are
available if you want them, but you probably won't.
</P>

<P>
MISSION 14: The Ambush<BR>
First, lay a trail of mines across the wide paths between two
shallow hills just SE of where you start. The convoy will then hit
these, which prompts the enemy to call in an air strike and a
chinook with reinforcements. Split your team up to avoid the air
strike and leave loads of mines where the chinooks arrive at 24-27
and 32-07. The real fun starts when the enemy soldiers that manage
to land - they run after you, but instead of attacking when they get
near one of your soldiers they just stand there like total spanners.
Then you just run away and they follow you, so the trick is to try
and make them run right over some of the mines you've left behind!
</P>

<P>
MISSION 15: Total Anarchy<BR>
Very difficult - avoid. The enemy has loads of chinooks which they
generally deploy men from where your leaders are standing. Just try
and spot them early and get an APC there to run the soldiers over as
soon as they drop to the ground. If you let any chinooks drop their
load then you can kiss your troops goodbye.
</P>

<H3>DESERT LEVELS</H3>

<P>
MISSION 1: Operation Mantrap<BR>
Quick and easy. Stop the transporter carrying the official to base
at 10-90 by planting loads of mines on the transporter's route along
the bottom of the map, near the row of red flags. No trouble.
Well, as long as you remember your chaps drop mines just NW of where
they are standing and don't walk straight into the one you've just
dropped.
</P>

<P>
MISSION 2: Operation Ironside<BR>
Send an air strike immediately to 50-20 to wipe out a considerable
quantity of the enemy, switch to missiles and take out remaining
tanks using a single man at a time. Another easy one.
</P>

<P>
MISSION 3: Investigation<BR>
When you first meet the enemy helicopters they're all nice and
friendly, but needless to say they're just trying to win your
confidence. Use the 'friendly' time to rearm your troops will
missiles from 54-74 so you can be ready to retaliate as soon as the
foes open fire. They can call in a troop assist, so as usual you
should try and blow up the chinook before it drops its soldiers. It
lands somewhere around 40-40, I think.
</P>

<P>
MISSION 4: Warzone<BR>
Plenty of air strikes and chinooks at your disposal - make use of
them. Call in an early airstrike on the bridge at 60-30 for good
results and save chinook calls until youtr existing troops are on
the edge of extinction. Also get in as many tanks and helicopters
as you can. They are littered all over the place and improve the
average soldier's life expectancy no end, as well as his killing
power (both these vehicles have a far greater firing range than your
standard gun-wielding soldier, so you can eradicate enemies from a
safe distance). Your soldiers seem perfectly capable of finishing
this one without too much help from you, as long as you get the odds
in their favour at the start.
</P>

<P>
MISSION 5: Operation Blitzkrieg<BR>
The village is at 30-80, just to the left of your start point. But
after one minute and ten seconds (precisely!) your first leader
unaccountably gets blown to high heaven, so make sure you've moved
your other chaps a reasonable distance away from him before. Use
the remainder of this squad to run to 22-51 to pick up a couple of
helicopters and leave them hovering there while you send your second
squad into the village to take out as many of the twenty enemies who
suddenly appear there. As soon as your second squad leader is
killed one of your helicopters starts moving towards the village, so
find and take control of it as quickly as possible. Then just hover
and make full use of the helicopter's long range firing capabilities
to pick off the enemy as they run towards you.
</P>

<P>
MISSION 6: Hell Hath No Fury<BR>
You need missiles to take out the enemy chopper squad, so quickly
rearm from the dump at 51-13. Spread your men out a bit to minimize
the effects of enemy missile strikes, and use the helicopters at
59-61 and 78-46. Really easy that one.
</P>

<P>
MISSION 7: Operation Destroy<BR>
First, take control of your leader so that the amphibian transporter
comes across to you and you can get your team over the river. Send
your helicopter towards the prison at 73-25 and take out as many
guards as you can. Then rearm some soldiers with grenades and
missiles from the ammo dump at 78-13. Send them in one at a time to
blow up the prison (this must be done within 5 minutes) and start
taking out the rest of the baddies. Leave the rest in defensive
mode at the bunker round the prison, just sending them out one at a
time if they are needed. There's a whole hoarde of tanks at 04-72
if you want them.
</P>

<P>
MISSION 8: Operation Judas<BR>
Shoot the soldier who shoots at you, but don't kill him. Then
engage the enemy and - well, that's all you have to do somehow. I
don't know how it works, it just does.
</P>

<P>
MISSION 9: The Defector<BR>
By some means you have to kill the defector on this level, but he's
wearing a bullet-proof vest and can't be shot. In fact, I'm afraid
I don't know how to do this one. It probably has something to do
with hand-to-hand combat or the ammo dump with the electric fence
round it at 31-56, but my only advice is to make this one of the two
missions you don't bother with in this section.
</P>

<P>
MISSION 10: Operation Crater Maker<BR>
Easy-peasy. Do away with all incoming chinooks with a missile burst
before they can drop their soldiers. Then collect more missiles
from any of the dumps lying around and blast the ornate building
behind the electric fence in the NE corner of the map.
</P>

<P>
MISSION 11: No Chance<BR>
Take out the enemy scout A.S.A.P., then make for the helicopters on
the right hand side of the map. Use these to take out the chinooks
- in fact, if you destroy the first one before it drops its troops
you win the level without having to face any more.
</P>

<P>
MISSION 12: Operation F.O.T. Part 1<BR>
Obliterate any enemies that are around (there are quite a few) and
check out the big tank doobridge at 80-80 - perhaps having a go with
the jetpack found in the mini-compound nearby on the way - and try
and destroy it. Albeit you don't win, this will end the mission.
</P>

<P>
MISSION 13: Operation F.O.T. Part 2<BR>
A total cinch. Just drop all your available air strikes in the
7-80, 69-77 area and hey presto, you've finished.
</P>

<P>
MISSION 14: Operation F.O.T. Part 3<BR>
Take out all enemy forces with the help of choppers to be found just
north of your start point - send in one at a time and kill soldiers
from a distance. You've got two troop assisstants to use when
things start to look desperate. There's also a stash of useful
crate at 56-18. The enemy chinooks generally drop off more troops
in the bottom right corner of the map, so try and keep forces there
in readiness.
</P>

<P>
MISSION 15: Operation F.O.T. Final Chapter<BR>
First, move your squad down from their starting point to give
yourself longer to react to the incoming enemy chinook, which tries
to drop troops right on the head of your squad leader. There's some
extra ammo at 20-66 where you can pick up grenades to blow up the
pyramid concealing the scientist you need to kidnap at 64-60. The
scientist tells you the F.O.T.s can be destroyed with acid from an
enemy hut. Find this over on the west side, and use a flamethrower
with it on the F.O.T. at 80-80. Then before you know it, you'll be
freezing your butt off in the ice missions.
</P>

<H3>ARTIC LEVELS</H3>

<P>
MISSION 1: Operation Polaris<BR>
Another piddlingly easy one. Kill the bad guys (there is a tank
fleet at 05-75 and a helicopter pad at 00-12 to help you) and
prepare for an enemy chinook at around 46-21. Wipe it out and take
in the orders about the nuclear device you've got to neutralise. Go
to the prison at 72-27, blow it up and them blow up the submarine
hidden underneath.
</P>

<P>
MISSION 2: Swapping Sides<BR>
Needless to say, the supposed deserters to your side are all pulling
your pilsner and open fire on you as soon as they reach your start
point. Just get in a chopper and do you worst.
</P>

<P>
MISSION 3: It's A Secret<BR>
Frankly a right tough one. Use your two airstrikes well - if you
don't kill enough with these to get the enemy chinook called in, you
will almost certainly find yourself up a certain creek without a
certain water-propelling device. Run from the start point to the
ammo dump at 78-09, merrily dropping mines as you go. Restock on
mines and barricade yourself into the NE corner of the screen.
Remember to have a couple of half-circles of mines emanating from
the bunker round the ammo dump and going up to the edge of the map.
Then stand in the corner with your gun at the ready to pick off any
reds who do sneak through the minefield. Keep a particlularly close
eye on the sneaky devils who come up the very right hand side of the
map - drop a few mines there if you can.
</P>

<P>
MISSION 4: If It Bleeds, You Can Kill It<BR>
Kill the measly enemies and check out the strange craft at 30-30.
It turns out it's a UFO, which must be destroyed by a massive
missile and grenade bombardment. Keep off the iced water or The
Thing will get you.
</P>

<P>
MISSION 5: War Zone<BR>
A ruddy great battle, as the name suggests. Quite easy though, as
long as you save eack of your chinooks until the last possible
moment. This way you should always be on top, which frequently
leads to the enemy surrendering as soon as a single shot whizzes
past their easr. Use your air strikes as well, preferably wherever
the opposition bring in a chinook and keep healing yourself with the
crates that can be found at 29-27 and 00-60.
</P>

<P>
MISSION 6: The Great Escape<BR>
This one gives you the chance to jump on a motorbike and re-live
Steve McQueen's finest moment. You have to kill all the baddies to
escape and you can only do this by running over them. Only attack
in an open space so you don't get stuck against trees, and don't
chase after soldiers - only go for ones running straight towards
you. Once they're all dead, head for the fence in the bottom right
corner of the map, take a run up at one of the ramps next to the
fence and watch yourself leap to freedom.
</P>

<P>
MISSION 7: It's Free-zing<BR>
Once again the enemy spring a surprise on you, when the troops you
are supposedly rescuing by blowing up the prison at 64-13 turn out
to be much more hostile than expected. Use one guy to blow up the
prison, and keep him pumping missiles into the red crowd which
emerges even though this means certain death for him. The enemy
also call in a chinook which heads for your other men - move them
south (but no further than the river, unless you like seeing your
people eated by sharks) to give them chance to react with missiles.
There's a helicopter and some ammo at 22-09 if you want them.
</P>

<P>
MISSION 8: No Morale Values<BR>
Very hard. Call in a chinook immediately to boost morale and an air
strike, and make full use of the crates and ammo at 78-59 and 10-16,
and the tanks at 04-03. The game is over if you let more than three
deserters reach a prison, so try and collect your yellow-bellies in
your APC (or kill them) to stop them surrendering. Putting said APC
next to said prison is therefore not a bad idea.
</P>

<P>
MISSION 9: Trojan Horse<BR>
When you take a look at the strange object in the SW with a single
soldier, it naturally explodes, killing the poor chap standing
nearby and disgorges a veritable army of red scum. The key to this
level, as with many others, is to destroy incoming chinooks. On
this level they come in around the 41-30 area, so just scroll the
screen round to find them. There are jetpacks at 43-38, ammo dumps
at 65-23 and 01-34, and a chopper at 59-48.
</P>

<P>
MISSION 10: Operation Wolf<BR>
Takes a long time this one, but is still pretty easy to complete.
They have absolutely loads of chinook reinforcements - well, at
least three anway - which they usually drop somewhere in the
vicinity of your squad 1 leader. So move him to the south end of
the map and as soon as an enemy chinook appears at the top of the
map, move your leader away from where he was standing. The chinook
will continue travelling towards the place where he was when it
first appeared on the map. So, if you have made a note of your
leader's coordinates before you moved him you can call in an air
strike to that point just as the chinook is about to drop its
soldiers off. Oh, you've also got a couple of chinooks yourself.
</P>

<P>
MISSION 11: Trouble And Strafe<BR>
Wipe out the enemy with the help of the helicopters you can pick up
at 31-51 and 62-42, and take out all incoming enemy chinooks as they
arrive at 00-00 (so you've got to be quick) near your second squad.
But just killing the enemy is not enough - you've got to blow up all
the helicopters and stuff as well. Call air strikes at 31-56 and
78-72 to speed this along. There are some ammo dumps at 54-12 when
you need them.
</P>

<P>
MISSION 12: Driving Them Mad<BR>
You've just got a load of APCs here, and so your only option is to
run your foe down. Drive one van straight to 26-37 and take out as
many as you can as they run towards you. Then an enemy chinook
should be called, depositing its soldiers somewhere around 01-15,
always at a point where one of your APCs is standing. Just suss out
from the direction of the chinook's travel which APC it's heading
for, move another APC as near to the targeted one as possible
(taking care not to crash into it) and take control of the targeted
one. Just move backwards and forwards under the chinook as the
soldiers drop out of it. If you miss any, the other APC might take
them out, that is if you're lucky. Also remember the golden running
over people rule - don't chase after soldiers because they will
constantly fire at you and you can't pick up extra health to
replenish yourselves.
</P>

<P>
MISSION 13: Silence Is Golden<BR>
The scientist you need to rescue is in the very bottom left of the
map in an igloo. Send down choppers one at a time to obliterate the
enemy guards. When they call for reinforcements, switch back to the
rest of your team at the start point and take out the chinkooks with
the rest of your helicopters. Then blow up the igloo at your
leisure.
</P>

<P>
MISSION 14: Vice Versa<BR>
After you've bumped off a couple of your rogue generals the enemy
call in reinforcements big time - and these little devils are a bit
tricky to get rid off. The best policy is to deposit most of your
squad in defensive mode behind the buildings at 33-83 and make use
of the ammo dump there too. Then send out one soldier to pick up a
chopper from 71-81 or 25-17. When he is the only man left alive,
call in your reinforcements and leave them to it as you fly the
helicopter around, taking out as many enemy as you can from as safe
a distance as you can.
</P>

<P>
MISSION 15: Operation Genocide<BR>
A massive and rather smart battle. Success here depends on taking
an early advantage. Just call in everything you've got whenever you
feel the urge and make full use of any long-range weapons you can
find. This mission takes a long time and is very hard to begin
with, but it isn't too bad if you're prepared to use just about
every trick you've learnt up to this point.
