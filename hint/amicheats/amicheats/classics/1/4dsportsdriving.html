<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
When you crash, rewind the replay videotape until shortly before
the crash. Now select {CONTINUE DRIVING} from the menu and the
car is new again.
</P>

<P>
To win the race in no time start driving backwards in the beginning
and turn around after a few meters. Now, when you cross the finish
line you have the lap time.
