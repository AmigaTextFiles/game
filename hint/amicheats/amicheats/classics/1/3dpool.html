<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
3-D Pool is different from other billiard simulations. One
difference is that no cue stick is shown on screen. Instead of
lining the stick up to the ball and shooting, with perhaps one or
two angles from which to examine the shoot, 3-D Pool does away with
the cue stick. Player can rotate the table, providing unlimited
angles of view for any shot. Cue ball is always in center of
screen, and shots are made by lining up the object ball(s) with the
cue ball. Players have complete control over position of the cue,
amount and type of English on the ball, and the power behind each
shot.
</P>

<P>
3-D Pool follows Monte Carlo, or European rules, instead of standard
American regulation. Player in 3-D Pool can participate in practice
games, two-player matches where they can take on a friend, or even
in a tournament against computer players of varying skill levels.
3-D Pool also includes demo game and special trick shot feature,
where players can try to solve 20 of the most difficult and popular
trick shots in billards.

<H2>TRICK SHOTS</H2>

<P>
Here are some codes for trickshot solutions. The first four
numbers represent the table's orientation, the next three show the
tilt of the table, the next two show the strength of the shot and
the last two show the amount of right spin.
