<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Night Shift is an arcade-style computer simulation of a whimsical
toy factory. To keep up with increasing demand for its Star Wars and
Indiana Jones toys, toy factory Industrial Might & Logic hires a
night shift worker who must contend with ever-increasing quotas. In
the process, the worker has to cope with equipment failures,
lawyers, lemmings, and a surly boss to boot. Includes 30 'shifts',
with gradually increasing challenge. Choose to play as either Fred or
Fiona Fixit. Suitable for ages 10 and up.

<P>
Having got the BEAST running, the best place to stay is the paint
control area with the three dials and flush chain. Moving up and
down, try to position the scroll so that you can see both the colour
in the paint trough AND the toy moulds in use. This way you can
make sure that you've mixed the right colour for the right toy.
</P>

<P>
If you're not careful, a couple of toys can be painted incorrectly
when the moulds change. With good timing, you need never waste one.
If your BEAST is set up correctly, the first part of a toy to go in
for painting should always be the body. When you see the moulds
being changed, run to the required paint dial (or flush chain, if
necessary) and wait.
</P>

<P>
You should see the last head from the 'old' toy being pushed out of
the mould and enter the bin on the right of the screen. Then the
first body of the 'new' toy should be thrown into the left bin. As
the 'old' toy's head drops down the paint spray jets, quickly make
all the paint changes needed. By the time the jets react, the toy
head should have passed through and been painted the correct color,
while the jets are now ready to spray the new color on the new body.
</P>

<P>
Lemmings and lawyers are a pain. Keep jumping and they won't get
you. In the later levels, the lemmings start meddling with the
BEAST, unscrewing bolts and flushing the paint trough. Leave
flytraps beneath the area at risk to deal with that problem.
