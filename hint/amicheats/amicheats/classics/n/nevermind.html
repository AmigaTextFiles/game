<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
An interactive thinking man's animated puzzle which features 300
levels (essentially 300 puzzles) with a screen unique to each. The
object of the exercise is for the player to use the screen character
to rebuild a video wall picture which forms part of the screen by
picking up blocks and dropping them into the correct place. At
first, the animated character stands on a block, then presses a fire
button which allows the block to be carried to its destination.
However it becomes increasingly difficult as the player enters
different levels by dropping down a hole to cross a causeway to find
himself in the middle of another maze of blocks. The pictures become
more complicated and animated, and the player must circumvent rogue
chess pieces that appear to disrupt the proceeding. All of this must
be achieved against the clock, with times set from 30 seconds for
then entry level puzzle up to 10 minutes for a multi-island task.
