<H2>CHEATS</H2>

<P>
On the title screen, type "MAJORTOM". You should now find an
option to play a round on mars.

<P>
To get a hole in one everytime, choose to play as an amateur, then
start the game. When you putt, the {A MULLIGAN} option will
appear. Click on {OLD} and your shots should decrease by one.
Repeat until you are on stroke one, and put the ball in.

<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
The tricky control system can be best mastered by following these
tips. Don`t concentrate too hard on wrist snap, concentrate on the
double click more (Wrist snap only adds 10% more power). Get used
to less difficult clubs first, such as the three wood with it`s
larger strike bar.
