<H2>CHEATS</H2>

<P>
An easy way to kill off enemy armies is to, in battle mode, bring
your infantry to the bottom of the screen, move backwards to get
them into retreat formation, then move forward to the enemy. You
will see that the enemy cannot get quite as far down the screen as
you and so they are stuck trying to move downwards. Now you can
just advance and shoot them all down with minimal losses. This will
only work when playing the computer of course. It may be harder to
win if your human opponent has read this cheat as well!
