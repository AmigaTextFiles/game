<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
After destroying an empty oil tower via the 'K' key (LMB & RMB) send
an oil driller quickly to that oil source and build a new tower on
it. Now you can take 3-4 tankers of oil to become some more extra
credits. That can be twice, before the source is empty.
</P>

<P>
If you have a group of different units, you should press the
'CTRL' key while selecting their destination in enemy territory to
adjust the speed of all units of the group automaticly. This means
that no unit will be faster as the slowest of them!
</P>
