<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
A comical game of strategy and tactics. As a world leader, you must
compete against four computer controled opponents for global
supremacy. Experience propaganda blitzes, nuclear strikes, and some
interesting weather anomalies.

<H2>CHEATS</H2>

<P>
Get a 50megaton plane up and then try to use a payload of 100
megatons with him on the following turn. You'll get an error
message. Ignore it and click on 'nuclear war' for the next turn.
After that you'll get a good stock of weaponry which should help you
kill every bad dude in the world.
