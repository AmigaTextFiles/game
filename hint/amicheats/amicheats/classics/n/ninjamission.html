<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Of all the dangerous tasks given to the Ninja, this was to be the
most perilous in their long history. To enter the Temple of Death
and regain the glowing idols stolen from the Princess by the Hordes
of Darkness would call for all his skills in the art of combat.
Ninja does not disobey the word of nobility, however, so taking up
his weapons, he makes his way to Torii to begin his mission.
</P>

<P>
While playing, on entering a room, push the joystick in the
direction of the enemy and hold the fire button. This will freeze
them, making them a lot easier to beat up.
