<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Science fiction role-playing game in which the player must find out
why all the computer hackers in Chiba City have disappeared. Players
must use computer programs to break into databases and get
information.
</P>

<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
When you first begin, sell all your body parts. You can get along
just fine without them for now, and it gives you enough to get a
half way decent deck. You will eventually need to buy them back
before you start entering cyber-space, or you will be killed easily.
