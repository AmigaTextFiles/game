<H2>SOLVE</H2>

<H3>IN HONGKONG</H3>

<P>
Jake Masters (JM) goes to town. His first trip leads to the pub.
After a talk to the keeper Ho (1-1-1-1) , 2 dirty guys are
threatening him (1-2). In a talk he manages to persuade the Chinese
Chi to get with him on a rescue-trip (1-3-3 OR 3-3-2).
</P>

<P>
Chi fears going by plane. So JM leaves the pub, takes the paper and
constructs a little plane out of it, that he presents to Chi.
</P>

<P>
Chi has the idea to get herbs at the chemist's shop. Wu doesn't
react when JM talks to him. Chi manages to persuade the chemist. The
chemist needs "gull-guano". JM and Chi go to the dock. Chi gives a
prune to the gull. The gull shits and JM puts the shit into his
pocket.
</P>

<P>
Again at the chemist Wu. JM talks to him and puts the guano into the
mortar. He gets the herbs, a faked passport and a map. JM and Chi
visit Lomax before the journey. At the airport JM decides not to
show the ticket-collector his passport. Inside the plane JM takes
the crowbar, the rope and the anchor.
</P>

<H3>IN CHENG DU</H3>

<P>
After arrival a farmer appears who talks to Chi (3-2-3). Chi changes
his clothes against the farmer's. JM tries to catch the cow with the
rope. After several useless tries he gives the rope to Chi who has
less problems. With the caught cow they both go to the castle. There
they watch a farmer who is allowed to enter the castle with his cow.
Of course, Chi tries the same trick. JM gives him the anchor which
Chi connects to the rope.
</P>

<P>
Arrived inside, Chi puts on his ninja-clothes at once. At first he
explores the door-keeper's home and takes the keys. Then Chi sneaks
into the palace and listens to Li Deng's talk. In the big hall he
finds Kate and tells her he'll come back with help as fast as
possible.
</P>

<P>
Back in the entry-hall Chi goes into the dining-room and takes the
bottle. He goes on to the kitchen and narcotizes the dog with the
wine. He takes both the fried chickens. Then he enters the Cooks
room. There he gets the knife. He opens the door and discovers a
second entry to the big hall.
</P>

<P>
After exploring the palace Chi walks to the castle-wall. He throws
the anchor over the wall and pulls JM over it. To hide from the
guards, they both sneak back into the door-keeper's home. When the
danger is over, they both run into the palace. When the guards have
left the room, JM and Chi go into the dining-room. There JM throws
down the lamp and lights a fire.
</P>

<P>
Through kitchen and bedroom they arrive in the big hall. JM locks
the door and kills the snakes with his gun. Unfotunately he can't
stop the snakes from biting Kate. JM carries Kate on his arm and
escapes to the balcony. There Chi connects the rope with the
balustrade and all three they escape to the tank-garage. In the tank
JM uses the key and pushes the starter. Now follows the first action
scene (better skip it). In the plane JM gives the herbs to Chi.
</P>

<H3>IN KATHMANDU</H3>

<P>
JM leaves the plane and talks to Chi about the situation. JM goes
getting help, Chi walks back to he plane. There he takes a tent-roof
and a blanket and puts it around Kate. He gives her his
ninja-medicine and the guano-herbs.
</P>

<P>
JM talks to Ama (2-2-3) and after that he looks around in the
village. In the post-office he posts a telegram to Lomax. Then he
visits the restaurant and talks to the keeper (2-3). The keeper
sends him to Sardar (2). Now JM goes to the Lama.
</P>

<P>
After a short talk to a young monk he is allowed to enter. The first
talk to the wise man is resultless. JM goes to the local dictator.
After a wrong remark he flies into the prison. Chi runs to Ama and
she rescues JM.
</P>

<P>
JM has a short talk to Kate and after that he has a trip to the
scrap yard where he meets a boy. The boy offers, after a short talk,
a tube which is full of petrol for a swap.
</P>

<P>
Chi builds from a cigar-box, the eating-sticks and four coins a
play-car; for this he gets the petrol-tube. Now he goes back to the
Lama and receives some more news.
</P>

<P>
In the rstaurant he manages to persuade Sardar to help (1-3). JM
gives him his gun as a present and the revolution starts. The game
continues in Turkey.
</P>

<H3>IN ISTANBUL</H3>

<P>
On the runway JM gets no petrol from the seller. On the way to town
Kate and JM notice a little boy selling oranges. JM finds in a
side-road the officers' club and has a little call from there to
Lomax; after that Jake is caught by the sultan's crew.
</P>

<P>
Kate swaps her brooch at the seller's and gambles in order to obtain
more money. After that she goes to the orange-seller and overthrows
his cart. She says sorry and gets a flower from her young fan. Now
she buys a camel for 200.
</P>

<P>
Kate goes back to the shop and buys a saw. Now she rides on a camel
- back to the palace. In a side-road she meets a woman to whom she
gives the flower. Kate rescues JM and they escape to the town-gate.
There Kate gives the camel to the boy and JM whispers some words of
excusing (3-2).
</P>

<P>
Arrived at the airport they see bursting their plane into flames.
They escape to the station and buy a ticket for the orient-express.
</P>
