<P>
Select manual gears, and then press 'N' (for nuetral) during the
game when you reach top speed. You will now zoom around on the
circuit.
</P>

<P>
At the start, turn the car around 180 degrees. The display should
now show the "wrong direction" message. Head off under the bridge
until you get to a split in the road. Take the right hand branch
and keep going until you reach a checkpoint. Go through and turn
the car through 180 degrees until your heading the other way. Go
back through the checkpoint in the right direction and you should
hear a ping. Keep going to the finish and once under the bridge
let the clock run down to zero. You should now get a message
saying that you've qualified for the race.
</P>

<P>
Another trick is to repeatedly hit '4' (4th gear) until the program
has an error. Continue with 'RIGHT MOUSE'. Repeat until you get a
high score.
