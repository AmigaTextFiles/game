<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Inherit Uncle Buddy Burbank's Malibu mansion by finding ten
treasures hidden throughout the house and grounds. Search through a
lifetime's worth of Hollywood memories in your aunt and uncle's
collection of movie memorabilia.
</P>

<H2>SOLVE</H2>

<P>
So your Aunt Hildegarde has died but in order to inherit her
fortune, you must collect 10 treasures by 9:00 am the next morning.
This is all from memory so if I can't seem to remember how to do it
exactly, I'll give you hints on how to solve it.
</P>

<P>
How to enter the house: Go north and open the mailbox and get the
paper with the peculiar design on it. Go south, turn the statue
west, then turn it east, then turn it north. Aha.. a click to the
north.
</P>

<P>
How to negotiate the hedge maze: After entering the house, there is
a thin piece of paper in the dining room. Get it and put it on top
of the other paper with the peculiar design. Now you have the map to
the hedge maze. Be sure to print it out on the printer then good
luck! (Remember to have a shovel with you before you go in)
</P>

<P>
HOW TO MOVE THE CANNON: Get the cannonball from the pile and put it
in the cannon. Somewhere in the house you'll find a match. Like the
cannon with the match and it should move. Open the compartment and
get the mask.
</P>

<P>
GETTING THE DIAMOND RING FROM TOKYO: This part is a part I really
don't remember too well. It should be fun for you to figure out how
to do it... but I'll give you some hints anyway. Keep these things
in mind: Do NOT push the red button until I tell you. Keep pushing
the east button until you can't go anymore (due to the encounter
with the Tokyo army & air force). Press the buttons to destroy the
tanks & planes. Do not push red button. Black button kills tanks and
white button destroys planes. Anyways, after you defeat the tanks &
planes, it would be wise to save the game. Next you'll encounter the
rocket. After the truck launches the rocket, push green button then
push black button. Move east again. Now Save game if you are in the
Park but have not yet destroyed the monument. One of the buttons...
Blue I think will get the diamond from the monument. Now after
getting the diamond, keep moving east until the Chihuahua hits the
eastern part of the dome. When that happens (here is where the red
button comes in handy), push the red button three times. After the
dome has the hole, get the diamond ring. NOTE: Wear all treasure
that can be worn.
</P>

<P>
ELEVATOR/CLOSET: This closet is really an elevator. To go to the
floor you wish, just move the corresponding peg. For ex., basement
is the first peg, foyer is the 2nd peg, and the upstairs in the 3rd
peg. Go to the 3rd floor, exit and turn the newel that is on top of
the stairs. (This will stop the stairs from turning into a slide) To
get to the 4th floor (sawed off peg), get the bucket, put the
elevator on the foyer floor. Go to the pond in the garden and fill
the bucket with water, go back to the elevator as quick as possible
(use the patio door) and hang the bucket on the 3rd peg. Exit the
closet and go upstairs (providing that you disabled the stairs/slide
mechanism) and go to the elevator entrance on top of the stairs.
You'll be standing on top of the elevator and just wait... the
elevator will move up and you'll be on the 4th floor. To open the
chest, open the panel first.
</P>

<P>
COMPUTER: Get all the punch cards you can find. There should be
seven total. Turn on the computer and insert the punch cards in this
order: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet. Look at the
indicator lights. Call the number you get on the phone in the living
room. Go back down to the computer and look in the hopper. Suprise..
a toupee. Wear it.
</P>

<P>
SACK ON 3RD FLOOR: Get the sack before opening the window.
</P>

<P>
CHIMNEY: Enter the chimney in the living room. Drop all and climb
the chimney (keep going up until you get to the roof). Go east, go
down and get the penguin. go back up and west, then go back down.
Get everything. All treasures that can't be worn, you can just leave
in the living room.
</P>

<P>
SCREENING ROOM: Enter the little booth, put the filmstrip in the
movie projector and the slide in the slide projector. Turn on the
slide projector (take off lens of both machines) and focus the slide
projector. Turn on the movie projector. Look at the screen. Remember
what it tells you.
</P>

<P>
PIANO: At the piano, type what the word(s) that you got from the
screening room. Open the trap door. Down. Go south and get the
pillar from the niche. Go north. You can drop the pillar. Go up and
push the piano south. Go down then north and get the parking meter.
</P>

<P>
1st SAFE: Move the painting in the hall from the foyer to the piano
room. Remember the wax candles. Remember the # of fingers each
statue was holding up? That is combination. So, knowing the colors
of our flag, turn the dial accordingly. It goes right, left, right.
</P>

<P>
Have these items with you: All the wax statue candles.
</P>

<P>
GETTING PAST THE GAP IN STAIRS: Remember the skis in the closet?
Wear them at the top of the stairs and ski down. At the beach, get
the green match. Light one of the statues with the fire (not the
match). Go south, then west into the underground cave.
</P>

<P>
UNDERWATER PASSAGE: Drop all but the wax statues and the green
match. Cover the green match with wax (wax is dripping down from the
burning candle). You can drop the burning candle. Go down, down,
west, up, up, now you will be at the surface of the water. Go up
again (should be pitch black). Light the match then once of the
candles. Go north, and up.
</P>

<P>
BOMB SHELTER: This room involves a little thinking. First of all,
pull down the right end (the end below the hatch). Pull the chain.
Burn the rope. Stand on the right end. Wait... Now drop all... get
the ladder, put ladder in hatch. Get all. Down. Put ladder on hooks
(or was it in hooks????)... Look at the plaque. The Combination is
hidden in it. See the first letter of each of there 3 guy's names?
Those are the directions you will have to turn the dial. Also count
the letter in each person's name and that'll be the number to turn
to.
</P>

<P>
COME ON DOWN!: You opened the second safe and got the film reel,
note, and peg. You did read the note... did you? You're almost done
with the game. Go back into the house to the closet. Put the peg in
the hole. You should be in the prop room. Your evil cousin is here.
Attack him with any object you see. The first few attempts will be
in vain but do it anyway. Once you injure him, untie your Aunt. Now
you finished Hollywood Hijinx!
