<P>
Lose all your lives till you are on your last one. Now find a gorge
(2nd level) and wait till the time is at 01. As soon as the timer
hits 1 walk into the gorge. You should get times up and the game
will restart, but as soon as it does you will die again. Now it
will restart again and you will have 99 lives.
