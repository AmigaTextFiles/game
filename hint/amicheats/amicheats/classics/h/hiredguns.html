<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Any mission, any where, any time... for a price. With this as your
creed you can wind up in some pretty tough locations. Graveyard is
just such a place; a small moon, orbiting a planet called Yalhoth in
the Luyten System. Your team's current mission: to extract members
of an extreme political group being held captive by a rival faction.
With this objective in mind you battle your way through over 20
theaters of engagement, encountering a variety of adversaries and
dispatching them with efficiency. Collecting weapons, scanners,
manipulators and food, you and your team work your way through
Graveyard, in pursuit of your objective. Will your team survive? Can
you liberate the hostages? Enlist with the Hired Guns and test your
skills.
