<H2>SOLVE</H2>

<P>
Go to the pumpkin and smash it. Get the key, unlock the door,and
open the door. Go to the table and get the candle. Look in the hole
under the stairs, get the knife and whistle. Go upstairs and enter
the first room, open the closet, and get the mask. Go into the
second room, look at the mirror and remember the number (333).
</P>

<P>
Enter the third room, and enter the cubicle. After becomming small
go between the glass and the table and get the bung, re-enter the
cubicle and tell Igor to push the buttons until he pushes the blue
button. Get the mask on the way downstairs.
</P>

<P>
Enter the door across from the door you entered from, it should be
the kitchen. Go straight across and you should be outside. Enter the
shed (use the number you saw in the bathroom (333) as the
combination). Go straight ahead and get the oilcan.
</P>

<P>
Go back to the kitchen and put on the mask. Enter the room to the
right, walk around until the butler approaches you and say yes to
the chop.
</P>

<P>
Go back to the kitchen, type THROW CHOP but don't press 'Return'.
Enter the room on the left and press 'Return' when you get in. Move
rug, oil bolt, undo bolt, and open trap.
</P>

<P>
NOW WOULD BE A GREAT TIME TO SAVE THE GAME! Go between the two rocks
to the left of the door. Try to avoid the bats (this may take a few
tries, explaining the saved game). As soon as you enter the next
room SAVE AGAIN.
</P>

<P>
Go to the top of the screen and get the mummy to come at you. When
he gets close go down and to the right, he should be stuck behind
the rock. Get the gold and enter the tomb in the upper corner. Plug
the hole in the boat with the bung (PLUG HOLE WITH BUNG). ENTER
BOAT, CUT ROPE, and PUSH BOAT. When you get to the other side talk
to the man:
</P>

<P>
The answers are:<BR>
bilbo, narnia, bram stoker, c, man, bullet, yes
</P>

<P>
(That's right, if you haven't registered you have to lie to
continue.)
</P>

<P>
GET OUT. In the next room you have to give the gold to the guard.
Enter the room and say "hey" to Penelope.
</P>

<P>
NOTE: You have just won. I only got 181 out of 190 but solved it.
See if you can find the other 9 points, I couldn't seem to find
them.
