<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Hoi is an advanced game of strategy and reflexes made to challenge
your arcade skills. Five levels of many obstacles, puzzles, and foes
to evade and defeat. WARNING: The stroboscopic effect used in the
fifth and final level could trigger EPILEPTIC seizures. If you're at
risk, don't play level 5.
</P>

<P>
Try the following to gain access to the first four levels (the last
level, level 5, is only available when you complete level 4): On the
level-access screen, place the "LVL" mouse pointer in the far bottom
right of the green quarter screen. The bottom "L" must be
positioned in the corner with pixel perfect precision (two pixels on
the pointer will be hanging over the edge to the right). Click the
left mouse button, then shift the "LVL" mouse pointer to the very
top left of the screen (as far as you can physically move the mouse
to the top left) and click the left mouse button again. You should
now have access to the first four levels. Another source says that
after doing this you can also get 12 lives at any time by pressing
'F4' during the game.
