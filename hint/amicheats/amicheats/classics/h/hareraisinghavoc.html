<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Our hero Roger is left in charge of Baby Herman by Mommy, but faster
than you can say rubber baby buggy bumper, Baby Herman has
disapperared! Players will have to help Roger escape from a
seemingly endless string of predicaments to bring Baby Herman back
before Mommy returns home. Can Roger find Baby Herman in time? Has
he been kidnapped? Why would any responsible parent leave their
child with a cartoon rabbit? These questions and more are waiting
to be answered in Hare Raising Havoc.
</P>

<H2>CHEATS</H2>

<P>
Hold down the following keys: 'LEFT ALT','CTRL','SHIFT', and 'F5'
to skip scenes.
</P>

<H2>SOLVE</H2>

<P>
The enter key is the action key, and the arrow keys move old roger
around.
</P>

<H3>LIVING ROOM</H3>

<P>
Go left, press enter to lower the ironing board. Go right, just
past the ottoman (foot rest) and kick it left. One step left, pick
up magnet. Go to fishbowl, use magnet to get key. Not necessary
but you get more time later. Go to left middle seat of couch, jump
up and keep jumping until fan is turned on. Get down, go to right
seat of couch jump up and down until you wind up in the fan. You
must press enter as Roger goes left, bad timing and you hit the door
and must repeat this. When you go left the escape sequence
activates, going off ironing board to ottoman through top vent over
door.
</P>

<H3>KITCHEN</H3>

<P>
Turn on burners on stove. Use key on locks. If you get timer, fine
that's it. If you get cheese, put it down next to mice and grab
them when they come out. This gives you more time too for some
reason. Now go nest to right door and move old fashioned clothes
dryer. Now go left and eat stuff out of refrigerator until banana
peel shows (if you screw up from here, return to refrigerator and
cycle through food to banana again). Go over banana peel and hit
enter as you hit table or you will not go over the sink. On the
sink hit enter until all dishes are trashed. Walk left, stand on
burners. On light, use arrow keys to swing and hit enter when going
right, this activates the escape sequence through the dryer.
</P>

<H3>BATHROOM</H3>

<P>
My favorite. Although they add nothing to the solve, you should
throw the rubber ducky and even better, by the toilet paper hit
enter. I love it, he wraps himself in the paper. I think this was
my favorite superfluous sequence, even better that Jessica saying
"Did you hurt yourself" in the Construction sequence. Oh yeah, the
solve.
</P>

<P>
Move over to the chair, get up and get towel. get down, put towel
over water. go back, kick stool over towel. Get up, and get soap.
Go right, jump on scale until skylight is open. Go right, turn on
fan. Do not turn heater off!!! Pick up plumber aid which sticks to
right wall (if it sticks to left go pull it again it will go to
right wall). Go left, turn on water. Play with soap in water.
Soap goes on floor. Go step on soap that goes in toilet. Go back
up on shelf where you got soap. Go right on top on towels and press
left or enter to activate sequence, which does not require action
from you. You should land on scale, bounce off aid, into toilet,
down toilet, come out as bubble and float out.
</P>

<H3>BACKYARD</H3>

<P>
Walk right into rake. Whoops, just kidding. Turn water on. Going
left blocks water in hose. Then go right, press up and enter to
grab line. Use arrows to swing or you will drop. Go right, drop
past rake. Spill fertilizer on tree. Get bucket on far right.
(For fun, swing on tire and have dog bite your ass or grab the
burning steaks). Walk left through rake to water. Put bucket down
and let it fill. Pick up bucket. Go back across rope same as
before. Put water from bucket on steaks. (Step over Two Steps
exactly here or time will expire on fire and it will return). Grab
steaks, one will flop onto see-saw. Go to tree and shake i think
three times for apple to drop on see saw and send steak to dog. Get
on swing, swing right left and hit enter going left to get over
fence quickly or time will expire on dog and he will return.
</P>

<H3>STREET SCENE</H3>

<P>
Pick up ball. Put in hydrant. Turn on hydrant. Get on Pogo stick
and get on wire (you should have this concept down by now). Go
right on wire to bird. Drop down, get feather. Go back up on wire
and stop just lsft of clown. Press enter twice to tickle clowns
nose. Magnet will drop. Drop down, get into garbage can. Walk
over with garbage can on you and slowly bet magnet over to right
over the manhole, which will come up after you move off it. Dump
garbage can, come back press down and enter.
</P>

<H3>CONSTRUCTION SCENE</H3>

<P>
This one gave me fits for some reason. Check out jessica for fun.
Tilt the mixer. Get a brick, put it in the mixer. Get some
dynamiter, put it in the mixer. Elevator now comes down halfway.
Repeat brick and dynamite. Elevator now all the way down. Get
dynamite and set mixer upright. Get on elevator, kick bricks. Go
right, grab onto hook and drop into mixer. on wood, saw until you
drop into hole.
</P>

<H3>MILK SEQUENCE</H3>

<P>
Turn on switch, left side. Go to far right control (QC FIR QUALITY
CONTROL) and hit enter on all bottles with tops on them. Good ones
will go into the crates, bad ones will break. Go to first wheel on
left, press when empty dirty bottles come by, it will clean them.
Go to second wheel and press to label all bottles. Go to fourth
wheel and press enter to fill with milk (just inside arm is the
right timing, ill let you scope out the timing on the others, not
too hard to figure). Go to third wheel to add rubber tops to
bottles (tougher timing actually). Start at quality control and
repeat as necessary to fill all crates and get to roof
</P>

<H3>ROOF</H3>

<P>
Beats me, tried all five keys got the same result each time, through
the door and scolded by mommy.
