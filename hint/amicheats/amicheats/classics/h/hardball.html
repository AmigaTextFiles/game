<H2>VARIOUS HINTS</H2>

<UL>
<LI>Allstars are better than champs.
<LI>Only steal if you actually hit the ball.
<LI>Try to get a lot of runs early, as the computer team improves
towards the end.
<LI>Bunting rarely works.
<LI>Halfway through the match, swap Laws for Wells and Wratten for
Harris.
<LI>The best pitchers are OLIVER, PEREZ, LEARY, COOK. The others
will only be successful for a short while.
<LI>Never pitch fastballs to the center as they will usually
result in home runs.
<LI>Change pitchers after a few innings, because as they get
tired, their accuracy and speed get worse.
