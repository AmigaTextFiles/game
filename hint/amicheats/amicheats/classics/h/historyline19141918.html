<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
While playing on the German side, collect your units around the
artillery and wait for the approaching enemy. Then it's very easy to
stop the enemy soldiers while the artillery is getting stronger.
</P>

<P>
Be aware of the short range of the light artillery, and that the
heavy and medium artillery can't shoot one round when they have
moved.
</P>

<P>
Let's say you have a very strong artillery and the enemy is waiting
for this unit to move before attacking, and your heavy artillery
gets in the range of the enemy's heavy artillery. You should move
light artilleries next to it, and wait for the next round. When the
heavy artillery isn't able to react in the next round, your light
artillery can, and covers the front range of heavy artillery.
</P>

<P>
Repair damaged units. One fatal mistake when playing Battle Isle was
producing new units, and letting the experienced ones fight in the
frontline. Save your energy and spend on repairs. An experienced
unit such as Elite Infantry can withstand most enemy tanks for at
least two rounds until the reserve arrives.
</P>

<P>
Bunkers are very difficult to take even with air support.
</P>

<P>
It's not uncommon for even the best 'warriors' to lose their best
troops while taking the enemy's HQ because they forgot about the
bunkers.
</P>

<P>
When producing units, always make planes. Planes can only be
attacked by Flak Units or Elite Infantry, and they're the most
important in the game.
</P>

<P>
Try to destroy the anti-aircraft units first. Don't be afraid of
aeroplane losses at the beginning. Sure, it's important to recreate
the air squadrons, but because the computer will mainly build
infantry it's important that the anti-aircraft sites are destroyed
early on.
</P>

<P>
If the situation is hopeless then try and collect your remaining
units, make sure you have more than one infantry, then set one
infantry to the front and hold the others back. When you attack, the
computer will try to destroy the infantry, while you position your
artillery and bomb him into the dust.
</P>

<P>
Keep your strong units in motion, and save them from enemy attack.
This enables you to open more than one front and entangle the enemy.
Use your planes to weaken approaching troops while still out of
reach of the artillery.
</P>

<P>
The best way to win is to hold the positions you have at the
beginning of the game. Weaken the enemy troops whenever you can, and
then attack. Strategically, History Line is a rather more defensive
game than Battle Isle.
</P>

<P>
To make the game easier, go to the player options and press fire on
the human option. Then move down and press fire on the computer
option. Then, when the game starts, you'll have all the computers
units and he will have yours. Because the game usually gives the
computer more units, you'll now gain this advantage, and so you
should be able to beat him easily.
