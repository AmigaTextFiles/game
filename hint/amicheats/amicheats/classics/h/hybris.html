<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
You're a pilot of a missile cruiser flying over treacherous enemy
territory. Your skill and courage will take you from a minimal
scouting ship to an ultra-powerful mega-cruiser. Face attacks from
land, sea, and air as you try to earn your silver wings. As
commander, you determine which power targets to strike to give your
cruiser rapid fire, extra missiles, or even invincibility. Great
visuals; game play moves every frame.

<H2>CHEATS</H2>

<P>
Once the game is loaded and prompts you to press fire, press the
"SPACE BAR" instead. You will be able to change the speed of the
enemy bullets and other stuff, with the mouse and keyboard. On the
high score table, type "COMMANDER" on the high score screen (not as
your name) press 'F7' to activate the super weapons 'F1-F6'. You
should also be invincible. 'F10' turns cheat on/off and 'F8'
advances a level. On the title screen press 'SPACE' or 'ESC' for
an options menu.
