<H2>TIPS</H2>

<H3>1ST STAGE</H3>

<P>
Whenever possible hide behind walls, or in doorways if you are about
to be spotted by a searchlight, as lying down or doing a roll isn't
always effective.
</P>

<H3>2ND STAGE</H3>

<P>
When placing your men around the top of the building, put them all
on the same side, the best side is the bottom one. Now press 'F1'
which will show you the side where your men are placed. Scan the
top windows first for an empty room. You should see the men
dangling from ropes, if not then you have got the wrong side fool!
</P>

<P>
You should send your first man in on the top floor. If all the
windows have silhouettes, the hostages are the one's with a slightly
fatter silhouette at the window than the terrorist's silhouette. If
you shoot a hostage at the window by mistake, you might as well
start again, don't forget there are only 3 hostages!
</P>

<P>
When your first man has entered a window on the top floor, clean the
top floor of all terrorists (in green, hostages are blue - they also
don't move around much) When you have killed your first terrorist,
position gun where he once stood, so when you burst in on the next
one, you don't have to mess about positioning your gun, but can
shoot him straight away.
</P>

<P>
When top floor is clear move your man to the top right room, (the
one with only one door) & stand him in that room with his back to
the door. That way, when you have a hostage you can take him to
this safe room, and leave him, as any terrorists can't get in
through the door because one of your men is protecting the door, but
you can still get in and out.
</P>

<P>
Now bring another man in through the top floor, still leaving one
man in the top right room protecting hostages you leave there. Now
go forth and find them their hostages. If there is a terrorist,
with a hostage behind him. DON'T shoot the terrorist as you will
kill the hostage. Instead run straight into the room and straight
at the hostage/terrorist, so you and them occupy the same space.
Don't stop, keep holding forward & you should be on the other side
of the room, as the hostage follows you, the terrorist doesn't.
BUT, doing this you have to be very QUICK.
</P>

<P>
Now take the hostage to the top floor, the top right room, where
your 1st man is on guard. Walk into this room and back out again,
the hostage will stay there. Now you are free to go & get another
one. Once all hostages have been successfully rescued, Game over!
