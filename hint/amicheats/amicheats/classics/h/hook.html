<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Peter Banning is a respectable, hard-working married man with two
children - but his long-forgotten past has come back to haunt him.
He was Peter Pan! His two children have been kidnapped by his old
adversary, Captain Hook, and Peter must travel to Neverland to
rescue them and recapture his lost youth.
</P>

<H2>CHEATS</H2>

<P>
Go to the bait and tackle shop and pick up the mug next to the
candle. Then keep doing 'pick up' in the space where the mug was
and you'll get all the items you need to complete the game.
</P>

<H2>SOLVE</H2>

<P>
Starting your quest in Pirate's Square, your first aim is to get
suitable pirate clothing to blend in with the locals. Take a wander
along Mugger's Alley and find Dr. Chop's dentistry. Take the
rollerblind from the window and ask the Doc about gaining money and
clothing. Subject yourself to the Doc's dentistry ways and let him
pull two of your gold teeth.
</P>

<P>
Next stop is Jolliest Roger's Place. Ask the manager a few
questions, concentrating on Hook, the war and how best to get the
hat. Leave Roger's and walk behind Pirate's Square to where Mrs
Smeedle keeps her washing. Grab the pole and the anchor and take a
look at the jacket. Then make your way back to Pirate's Square.
</P>

<P>
From the square head towards the Pier and pick up the rope that's
lying around. Use the rope on the anchor and go to the Crossed
Swords. From there take the two cups from the tables and leave.
Make your way towards the Bait and Tackle and take the cup you find
there. Head upstairs to the balcony above the square and get ready
for some Infdiana Jones-style hijinks. Use the rope and the anchor
on the clock and start swinging across the Square. Grab the hat
from the passing pirate as you go. Well done Indy.
</P>

<P>
Knock on Mrs Smeedle's door and then quickly swing back to the
balcony while she's busy answering it. Head downstairs as quickly
as possible to Mrs Smeedle's washing line. Use the pole to get the
jacket from the line and examine to find a coin, which you should
take.
</P>

<P>
Now that you're rich enough, head back to the Jolliest Roger and
find Fake Jake. Talk to him and find out if he needs a drink. Give
the three cups to the bartender and pay him with the three coins.
He'll give you three foaming cups of brew in return. Give these to
Jake and watch him drink himself under the table. Once he's asleep,
take his trousers. Head back to Mrs Smeedle's and use the
rollerblind to gain some privacy while you change into your pirate
clobber.
</P>

<P>
Now your ready for Hook's ship. Look in the pots to the right to
get some more cash and head for for the town tailor. Ask her for a
metal detector and give her the money in return for a magnet. Head
for the beach and go treasure hunting by using the magnet on the
large X (despite what a certian Mr Jones would have you believe).
Make your way back to Hook's ship and find the Hoff-man himself.
Now prepare to go diving.
</P>

<P>
Take a look at the pulley base and the big shell. Use the pole on
the ropes and use the shell to haul yourself up towards the look-out
point. From here, go right to enter the Neverforest (that's never a
forest). Maze time folks, follow these directions to escape, right,
right, right, up, right, up, left, left, left, left, up, right,
right. After you've been trapped, enter the tree.
</P>

<P>
Go to the round pond and have a chat with Tinkerbell about
everything (you'll be amazed how much she knows about Bird's Angel
Delight). Head for the slingshot and chat to Ace about everything
(the tales of how molten lava is formed will be the talk of any
dinner party). Go to the workshop and pickup the arrow. Now head
towards the jogging area and do a Jane Fonda. Use the excercise
eguipment three times to tone up that body. That's right, can you
feel the muscles tightening?
</P>

<P>
Now go to the Avenger and take the net. Examine it and head for the
Four Seasons to get some dead wood. Use this with the string and
take the flower. Go to the chicken and use the conchshell on it.
Grab the eggs while she's startled and return to the workshop. Give
the eggs to the boy and go back to the round pond. Give the flower
to Tinkerbell then take the branch from the tree.
</P>

<P>
Walk to the slingshot then use the strong elastic on the broken
strap. Use the branch with the string. Return to the workshop and
use the bow with the panpipes. Take the pipes and head towards the
cliffside. Use yourself on the far corner of the fence. Keep doing
this (about three times in total) then ask Thudbutt what he thought
about your antics. Go back to the slingshot and use it on yourself.
Ask Thudbutt what his happy thoughts are then go to the dining area
and have a chat with Rufio. Say "Oh Rufio".
</P>

<P>
Go to the round pond again and walk towards the middle of the screen
to enter the Nevertree (that's never a tree). Talk to Tinkerbell
then examine the bed, the chair and the fireplace. Talk again with
Tinkerbell and your memories of long-forgotten but better times
should come flooding back.
</P>

<P>
Now that you regained your faith and discovered the truth about
Peter Pan it's time to go after the nefarious Hook. When the sword
fight commences use the following Monkey Island-Style taunts.
</P>

<P>
Peter Pan the Avenger!<BR>
Good form James.<BR>
Tick-tock-tick-tock, Hook's afraid of a dead old crock!<BR>
You kidnapped my kids Hook. You deserve to die!<BR>
Put up your swords. It's Hook or me this time.<BR>
Peter Pan the Avenger!<BR>
</P>

<P>
And that's the end. The game is finished. Sit back and enjoy the
reward that is the end sequence.
</P>
