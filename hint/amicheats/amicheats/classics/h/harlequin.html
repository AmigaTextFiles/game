<H2>SECRET ITEMS</H2>

<P>
Guide the Harlequin to the jigsaw puzzle section whilst carrying
the space hopper. When you fall from the kite, select the space
hopper and jump up to the lower of the two platforms above you.
Disengage the space hopper and jump across to the other platform,
then leap over the low wall. When you land, keep on firing to see
where the ground is and move across to the point where you're
walking on air. Run left until you cannot go further, jump up and
you'll hit an invisible warp. You'll be prompted to insert disk 1,
and now you can watch the end sequence.
</P>

<P>
Watch out for hidden bonuses located at the following locations:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>The first Tower's clock face
<LI>The clown's noses in the Learning Curve
<LI>The taps in the Sewerside
<LI>The trees and flowers in Cutesy Land
<LI>The pipe openings in the Organ Chamber
<LI>The ace of Hearts playing cards in The House of Cards
</UL>

<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
Using the space hopper on water will allow you to skim across the
surface without drowning.
</P>

<P>
Don't stray in the straws level too long. When the timer runs out,
the credit tokens disappear and aren't regenerated. However, if you
grab as many as you can and leave before the timer reaches zero,
when you re-enter the level, all the credit tokens should be back
again. By doing this two or three times you will gain an extra life.
</P>

<P>
When falling long distances, use the brolly power just before you
hit the ground. It may only save you a small amount of energy but
every little bit counts.
</P>

<P>
Heart pieces are located in the Rooftops, Hell, Cutesy Land and
Sheet Muzak.
</P>

<P>
Most levels change in some way during the game so make sure there
isn't an exit you've missed when you pass through a level which you
have visited before.
</P>

<P>
Save your game frequently as it will take a long time to complete
(roughly two and a half hours if you take the shortest route).
</P>

<P>
Any levels which have water are bound to have a Fish Power token
nearby so don't venture near it without one.
</P>

<P>
Something strange might happen should you hit the right notes in the
Organ Chamber.
