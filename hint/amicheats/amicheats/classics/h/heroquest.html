<P>
Read this, if you want to get loads of money (in the game).
Simply get your men to complete the first mission then enter them in
the last. As soon as they appear, get one of them to search and
collect the money if there's any there. Then simply leave via the
staircase with the money. Keep this up until you've got enough
money to buy the necessary equipment. As for the artifacts that you
can get during the game, well the same sort of thing can be done to
acquire these. Enter the mission, find the artifact and then get
out. Now just go back to the same mission and get someone else to
pick up the artifact in your quest. This way each of your
characters have the top of the range weapons and armour.
