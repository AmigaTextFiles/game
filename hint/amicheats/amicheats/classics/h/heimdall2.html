Your party should now be invincible, while still able to build up
their stats.

<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
In Loki's shrine use the empty bottle on the front to rise to a
rune, Urgha uses the rune spell to get invulnerability.
</P>

<P>
Should Heimdall or Ursha die, go to the Dwarven Isle in Utgard and
go to the shop where you can buy spells and weapons. If you go to
the inventory and click on the dead character's picture, you can now
sell any items that were held. Now take the items back and give them
to the surviving character.
</P>

<P>
When you complete a world, don't collect the restart book in the
Hall of Worlds, instead proceed into the next world and collect as
many bonuses as you can. Next return to the Hall of Worlds and
collect the book. Save the game using the save icon in the
inventory, and then load up again. You'll start in possession of the
items and money you picked up before you saved the game, but the
bonuses will have reappeared on the next world, allowing you to go
and collect them as many times as you wish.
</P>
