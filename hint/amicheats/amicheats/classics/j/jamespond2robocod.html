When you start the game, on the first roof you come to, above a
sign saying "Arctic Toys" you will find five objects, which are,
from left to right, an apple, an Earth globe, a cake, a hammer and
a tap. The first letters of each of these added together (AECHT)
is an anagram of the word CHEAT. Pick up the objects in the correct
order (Cake, Hammer, Earth globe, Apple and Tap) to receive an
invincibility shield lasting 10 minutes. When the cheat is
activated, flashing fish form around Robocod, and the music speeds
up. Also, if now you go straight into the first room, and then
exit immediately you will find that all of the castle doors have
been unlocked, allowing you to access any level.
</P>  

<P>
On the sports equipment level after the second spike are five
objects in a row, which, in order, are some Lips, a Violin, an
Earth globe, an Ice-cream and a Snowman. The first letter of each
of these added together spells out LVEIS, which is an anagram of
the word LIVES. Collect these in the correct order (Lips, Ice
cream, Violin, Earth and Snowman) for infinite lives.
</P>

<P>
In some point of the game (I do not know where), there are five
objects that spell out the word POWER. Collect them in the
following order: Penguin, Oil, Wine, Earth and Racquet.

<H2>SECRET ROOM LOCATIONS</H2>

<P>
There are two hidden worlds behind the main tower, another sweets
level (including a Liquorice Allsorts World, the infamous Bouncing
Jelly World, another Cake World and an upside down Jelly World)
and an extra scrolling section. To reach them, run along the ground
floor - avoiding the doors - then go up and over the first flight
of stairs. From the bottom of the second (smaller) tower, make
your way up to the landing above Dr. Maybe's final door and run left
into the wall. You'll disappear behind the screen and arrive in the
Secret Tower room. But who is Katie? 
</P>

<P>
Once you've finished the bath level, drop down to the bottom of the
castle, and walk left until you get to the small snowman statues.
Jump on these and they'll turn into a moving platform. Once you get
to the top of the screen, walk left into thin air and jump. By now
you should be next to some doors. Go through them for bonus city!!
</P>

<P>
Go to the same place after finishing the circus room (the last room
before the end of game baddy) and stand on the golden snowmen again.
A platform made of two bonud blocks should float upwards, revealing
a secret tunnel. At the end of this are even more extra lives and
stars.
</P>

<P>
Do as above after the sweets level, but go to the left of the
castle. Go on the snowmen once more, and at the top of the screen
grab the umbrella and collect all the goodies while you're floating
down.
</P>

<P>
On the second teddy bear level, keep jumping over the spikes until
you see a hole above you. Jump through this and catapult yourself
off the bus there. Once you've done this, get on the higher level
and keep walking left, bounce on the trampoline and collect the
wings. Now fly along the top of the screen to the right and you
should find a different exit. Go through this for a special bonus
level. 
</P>

<P>
Complete a level with does not feature a guardian and you will
always find something new when you return to the castle "selection"
screen. In one case you will find a whole sequence of lifts and
things (see above) that lead to a door that you cannot normally get
to. If you go to the very right of the factory screen and look down
you will see a load of crowns, which you can access after coming
back from other levels.
</P>

<P>
It is possible to finish Robocod by only doing half the levels. A
choice of two new doors to enter is given when the correct level is
completed. Start by completing the Fluffy Toys one and then by
doing the Cars one.
</P>

<P>
Finish the bath levels and as soon as you come out of the door run
straight to the golden snowmen in the bottom far left outside the
castle. Jump into these snowmen and you'll float upwards to the top
of the screen where you'll be met by a door. Getting through this
door is tricky but worth it. Inside are loads of extra lives and
energy stars. Go to the same place after finishing the circus room
(the last room before the end of game baddy) and stand on the golden
snowmen again. A platform made of two bonus blocks ahould float
upwards revealing a secret tunnel. At the end of this are even more
extra lives and stars.
