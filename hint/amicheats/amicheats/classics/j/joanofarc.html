<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Joan of Arc: Siege & The Sword offers five exciting action sequences,
including large-scale battles in open countryside, hand to hand
struggles with individual English soldiers, and perilous assaults on
soaring fortress walls as boulders and scalding oil rain down. This
history-based game blends action and strategy with a rich storyline.
The player takes the role of Charles VII and can raise armies,
collect taxes, ransom prisoners and send out spies. Up to 20 game
options are possible at every turn! Seventythree authentic
provinces and towns, and 31 historically-based characters, each with
different strengths and weaknesses, add to the challenge.
</P>

<H2>TIPS</H2>

<H3>DEFENCE OF THE WALL</H3>

<P>
As soon as the screen changes start pressing fire to launch rocks.
Use oil when time is short or when two or more enemies are coming up
the same ladder. Even though it says that oil is limited, there are
at least five cauldrons at your disposal.
</P>

<H3>ENTRY INTO TOWN</H3>

<P>
As soon as the screen has loaded push right and keep pushing right
until the end. When an enemy appears keep fire pressed until he is
slain. Release fire and your man should run straight up the
drawbridge. Repeat this until you get into town.
</P>

<H3>ATTACK ON THE WALL</H3>

<P>
Push the joystick forwards as soon as the screen changes. Keep
pushing forwards until the wall is taken. Use the fire button to
ward off the rocks until the top is reached.
</P>

<H3>GAME STRATEGY</H3>

<P>
At the start of the game ORLEANS must be taken. Select Start A
Campaign and then displacement to move north into Orleans. Here you
should encounter your first battle.
</P>

<H3>BATTLE TACTICS</H3>

<P>
Hold your ground and wait to be attacked. As soon as the enemy
move, shower them with arrows and then with mortars. Move your
troops forward to protect your archers and send your cavalry out
(they are likely to be killed). While your troops are fighting,
remember to fire your arrows if the remainder of the enemy moves
forward to attack.
</P>

<P>
On the defeat of the enemy, choose Offensive and attack Orleans.
Use the 'Entry in to town' and 'Attack on the Wall' tips to succeed.
After capturing Orleans move north east into Champagne and take
Rheims to crown the king.
</P>

<P>
After the coronation move north taking each town in every province
until you have reached the northern most province. Sweep
anti-clockwise until each province has been taken.
</P>

<P>
Joan's army soon becomes depleted; choose Royal Army and then
modification to top up her army. About 2,000 archers and 3,000
troops are enough. To pay for this collect the tithe in September
but forget about the other taxes. This will avoid any uprising, but
means that you will have to ransom some hostages. Choose Diplomacy
and then Liberation, deal with Henry VI and use Regnault of Chatres
and Tremoille as ambassadors, the meeting place does not really
matter.
</P>

<H3>RANSOM DEMAND GUIDELINES</H3>

<P>
Duke of Bedford -------- $4,000,000<BR>
Duke of Warwick -------- $2,000,000<BR>
Duke of Gloucester ----- $2,000,000<BR>
John Talbot ------------ $1,000,000<BR>
Count of Suffolk ------- $1,000,000<BR>
Cardinal of Winchester - $1,000,000<BR>
Captain Falstaff ------- $1,000,000
</P>

<P>
If you are really desperate halve the ransom. If your coffers are
overflowing, execute one of them using the Royal Justice Menu, which
will reduce the number of armies that Henry VI can control.
</P>

<P>
Any French characters caught should be executed promptly. If there
are no hostages when payday comes choose Helping Hand and kidnap
one. Do not try for the Dukes because these attempts are most
likely to fail. Remember to pay well - $20,000 is the right
incentive. If Joan is caught, Richemont, War General is a good
replacement.
