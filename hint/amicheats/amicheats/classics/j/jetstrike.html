<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
On the first mission of every level take the SU-25 Frogfoot loaded
fully with Maverick missiles. Fly over all the terrain destroying
every SAM and anti-aircraft site. This makes the following missions
easier and safer. After destroying all the SAM and anti-aircraft
sites, take the Harrier up with one drop tank and 2 x 2,000lbs
bombs. Watch for any enemy aircraft taking off to locate SPUDD's
aircraft base. Once located, use the Harrier to destroy the runway.
Now the SPUDD aircraft are grounded, before you start any missions
take a fighter plane up, and destroy those in the air. This should
leave you with total air supremacy enabling you to complete the
missions unhindered.
</P>

<P>
Persevere. If you don't complete a mission try again. It really
feels good on the last level when you see the SPUDD base go up in
roaring flames.
</P>

<P>
If you fly at a high altitude along a straight line, in every frame
there is a one in eight hundred thousand chance of a UFO appearing.
This means once every five and a half hours. But if one does appear
the aliens are so embarrassed about accidentally shooting you out of
the sky that they give you one of their planes with some pretty
impressive statistics - extremely high manoeuverability, a chain gun
with six times the power and a 32,000 pound payload under each wing.
</P>

<P>
The chances of one appearing on the CD32 version is one in a
million.
</P>

<P>
Also, if you manage to bomb Stonehenge, you will be cursed by the
Druids and it will be cloudy for ever.
