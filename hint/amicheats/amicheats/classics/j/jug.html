<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
You are an interactive humanoid composed of Titanium fleximetal and
other organic materials. First built in 36412 AD, you were nicknamed
JUG because of your barrel chested profile and the ability to
transform into many different shapes. Your duty is to seek out the
deadly tumor that is destroying the planet Spireaus. Trap doors
enable you to move up or down a level. The planet's immune system
will see JUG as a hostile and alien body. Beware of attacks from the
very planet you are trying to rescue.
</P>

<H2>CHEATS</H2>

<P>
On the title screen hold down 'ESC' and click the mouse pointer on
the right edge of the picture to activate the cheat mode. This will
give you infinite energy and lives.
