as 665, and then any other numbers after that, you will be in the

<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
Utilise audibles as much as possible. Fool the computer into
thinking you're attempting a long bomb (Hands and Shotgun and then
choose the teams best running audible before the snap). The same can
be done with passing plays. Set a formation and fool the computer
into thinking that you're going for a running play (Big and
Goalline), when at the line of scrimmage, choose the teams passing
audible once more.
</P>

<P>
If you're too far away for a field goal, when on a 4th down, go for
a fake punt. Fake field goals are also pretty useful in a tight
spot, but only as a last resort. When running with the ball, run up
field at an angle then, when a defender comes towards you, quickly
change direction when he dives at your feet. Hold down the
firebutton and you'll have the best chance of shaking the tackle.
</P>

<P>
When playing defence, select a good strong formation. Manoeuvre a
player from the centre zone to the line of scrimmage, and then into
a gap between the two men, pushing them along the line of scrimmage.
This often upsets the offensive line and you can get through to sack
the quarterback. Always try to strip the ball from the offensive
team if there are more than two of your defensive players around.
You should be able to take possession. Also, when you're running
with the ball and there's no way around a defender, try spinning
around to throw him off track.
</P>

<P>
When playing the computer in defence mode and it chooses a running
play, don't attempt to tackle the ball carrier. Instead, run in
front of him and he'll try to run around you. Block his change of
direction and he will run backwards trying to get past. Keep this up
and you will force him right back to regain lost yardage.
</P>

<P>
Always watch the game clock. A lot of people always forget about it,
and timing that all-important last scoring play can make the
difference between a win and a loss. When passing, concentrate on
the receiver windows as well. Choose the player who is free or ahead
of the defensive players. By watching the distance meters you can
tell who is in the best position to receive your pass.
</P>

<P>
Hands, Shotgun, Deep Outs and Post Up are all very effective
offensive plays and rate amongst the best to use. On the defensive
front try 4-3 Read and Wide Zone 2. Anyone who can take Atlanta to
the Super Sunday is a great player, but if you want a real challenge
try to get over 100 points against a computer-controlled Madden
team, then you're an all-star.
</P>

<P>
Another tip for the game is that sometimes you can get the ball back
when kicking off. When the kicking meter is on the screen, put the
direction full to the right with no power at all. Cincinnati,
Kansas, All Madden and Minnesota can get the ball back all the time.
