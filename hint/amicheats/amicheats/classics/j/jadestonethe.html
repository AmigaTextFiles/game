<H2>SOLVE</H2>

<H3>START</H3>

<P>
Ask Sajo about the Jade Stone, ask Sajo about the manuscript, ask
Sajo about Mallumo, ask Sajo about Putrons then go North when Sajo
leaves and ask him for the manuscript, examine manuscript and ask
Sajo about the Guardian, go Southeast when Sajo leaves and ask him
about Carmon (the answers are basically clues as to what you need to
do, etc.). Go down into the Dungeon, Question Putron, Charm or Kiss
Guard, Interrogate Putron, then return to the Hall and search the
various rooms (look at the object list above to help you find
everything).
</P>

<H3>KITCHEN</H3>

<P>
The Kitchen has cakes and a knife - search table for the latter and
examine oven to discover the cakes. To get the cakes: use towel to
get cakes or remove/get cakes with towel. The Dining Hall: examine
the table to find the book, then swap the book for the towel (you
can swap them again if you've done this before getting the cakes),
examine the book and make a note of what it says, then drop it -
collect it later if you want, but it just provides a clue for later,
and at this stage you'll probably need to only carry useful items.
The Town Square is just a 'pass-through' location, although the
Pedlar may be here, in which case examine pedlar to discover what he
is selling then examine the various items, buying the thread when
you can. To buy the map, you'll need a gold nugget. Buy the other
items available at the two shops (North and Northeast of the
Square), i.e., the meat, the hooks and the rope - they're all
needed.
</P>

<H3>MONEY</H3>

<P>
To get money: 2 ways (and you'll need to do both). Sell cakes to
baker, sell jewellery to pedlar. To enter the Temple: examine the
priests then remove shoes. To pass the robbers on the narrow road,
pray in the Temple of the Sun and take the talisman, then keep it
until the robbers run off. (If you've been robbed, don't worry -
just examine shelter in the dell in the wood to find your belongings
again). To carry more objects you'll need a bag. Examine woman and
talk to woman in the cottage (North of the village) then mend shawl
(but make sure that you first have the needle and thread). To help
the Lumberjack, examine him then tear petticoat, bandage hand/wound,
get logs. To catch the dog, type CATCH DOG WITH ROPE (make sure
you're holding the latter first, though) then just go to the house
Southeast of the Town Square and you'll be rewarded with a
tinderbox.
</P>

<H3>BROOCH</H3>

<P>
To get the brooch: first examine the pools (South of the cove),
then make a crabbing line with string and hooks (if you ask the
fisherman about crabs, he'll give you a hint), put bait on hooks
then either fish or lower line and you'll catch the crab, then get
brooch. To get the nugget to buy the map, give the brooch to the
hermit, ask hermit about ring (provided you have it, of course -
give a coin to the tramp then get the ring). To get salt, examine
slab at cove then scrape salt with knife.
</P>

<H3>CARMEN</H3>

<P>
Go East into his room, wait, say No to both of his questions, then
get cask, examine cask, examine powder, go West and ask Carmon about
Russinor/Glade if you want, but he's not allowed to be helpful. To
find Glade/Russinor free the little girl East of the clearing in the
woods by cutting the brambles, then West and play with the children,
then scatter the powder on the pool.
</P>

<P>
To move the rubble in the ruined cottage go to the Farmhouse then
quietly to the baby or rock baby gently then ask the Farmer to go to
the ruined cottage or tell him to go North, etc., at the necessary
locations, then go to the Cottage and ask him to move the rubble.
To get the dove, pick corn when in the cornfield, throw corn when
under gnarled tree, then play flute and he'll follow you to the
Marsh - if he does fly off, just repeat the process. To enter the
Marsh, drop the logs (given by the Lumberjack) then push logs or
make path with logs then carefully cross logs. In the Marsh go
South to the Lake, play the flute and get into the boat, provided
you have the dove with you, Marissa will give you a chalice, climb
into the boat to return to the other side of the lake. To pass the
Mist to the East of the Plains, you must be carrying the glow-worm -
found Northwest of the first location in the Marsh. At the Henge,
examine the chalice to discover some runes, read the runes (they are
just words written sideways so turn your head to read them - the
tramp will give you a clue if you rub the ring then ask the Tramp
about the runes - provided you have the chalice), put chalice on
slab, say the words on the chalice (POTENCO EL JADON) and the
Guardian will swap the chalice for the Jade Stone.
</P>

<H3>MALLUMO</H3>

<P>
In the Tavern buy a drink for the traveller, ask him about the Stone
if you want, then give him the map for a clue as to how to get
through the Mountains. At the Canyon go Up (listed in the exits).
To find the Passage, examine/cut/burn brambles on the ledge -
unfortunately a snake appears. To dispose of the snake you'll need
the stick and tinderbox - light stick, you'll go Down and the snake
will disappear into the passage, only to be eaten by the Bear! The
Army and your Father will charge into battle, and a time factor now
comes into play (should be ample time to finish, though, if you
leave the snake until you have everything you need, including the
sickle from the Barn, the armour, the sword - bent or otherwise -
you'll get a replacement if it is, provided you keep it, the
incense, tinderbox, Stone and the salt.
</P>

<H3>CASTLE</H3>

<P>
To enter the Castle, you must first dispose of the Putrons at the
camp - talking to them should provide a clue, also remember where
you found the incense and what was painted there, so in the Cave
light the incense then go to the Camp, examine the Putrons to find a
horn (and possibly a sword if your other one was bent), then go to
the Castle walls and to open the gate, blow horn.
</P>

<P>
In the Castle, you'll need to kill the sleeping Putron in the
Dungeon in order to get his keys. To get the keys, you'll first
need to dispose of the vulture at the top of the Tower, do this by
throwing meat, then examine turrets to find some wire, return to the
Dungeons and get keys with wire (can't), so bend wire and try again.
In the Guard Room the graphic is meant to help: examine the bed to
find a blanket. In the Untidy Room, examine the chairs, junk etc.,
until a piece of paper falls onto the floor then read it. In the
Hall look behind or pull tapestries to discover a panel, examine the
panel to discover a slot, open panel with key or insert key into
slot. In the Temple, examine the altar to discover the evil force.
Pour salt on the floor, say VENKI MALBONE (the piece of paper and
the book were your clues for this), examine the altar and pull
switch then go South.
</P>

<H3>ENDING</H3>

<P>
There are various endings but the one that earns you full points is
the following: Throw sickle at rope (to free Guy), you'll be
surrounded by flames so smother/extinguish flames with the blanket,
then throw the Jade Stone at the orb (however, if your Father has
been killed in the battle before you finish, your score will be
less). Other ways to finish are to throw the Stone at the orb
WITHOUT freeing Guy first; running out of time; kissing or marrying
Carmon; getting killed by Mallumo; dying from the heat of the
flames.
