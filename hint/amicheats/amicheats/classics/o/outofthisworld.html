<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
<B>NOTE:</B> This game is also known as "ANOTHER WORLD".
</P>

<P>
Thrusts players into another dimension where survival depends on
cunning, speed, and sharp senses. As scientist Lester Knight
Chaykin, the player is hurtled through space and time by a nuclear
experiment gone wrong. The player must dodge, outwit, and overcome a
host of alien monsters and deadly earthquakes that plague the alien
landscape that has now become home. Only a perfect blend of logic
and skill will get the player past the deadly obstacles that lie in
his path.
</P>

<P>
The use of polygon graphics allows the game to generate real-time,
rotoscoped animation in fluid cinematic zooms, pans, close-ups, and
scaling. Bridging the gap between cinema and action/adventure
games, this completely new style of storytelling allows players to
run, jump, kick, roll, climb, and swing quickly and smoothly. It
offers a complete atmosphere of sights and sounds with a continual
audio mix of digitized sound effects and musical score.
</P>

<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
There are three ways of working the gun:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>A single quick press will fire a thin beam for breaking ropes,
disconnecting cables and killing enemy personnel.

<LI>Hold down 'FIRE' until an energy ball appears then let go and a
shield will form. This stops laser shots.

<LI>Hold down the button until the energy ball swells and begins to
hum. Then let go and you will fire a big beam.
</UL>

<H3>THE BEGINNING - "EDJI"</H3>

<P>
After emerging from a pool of water, Lester Chaykin begins his
adventure. Walk right and stop on the edge of the next screen.
Using a combination of standing kicks and crouches, kill ALL the
slugs that fall from the ceiling and those that crawl across the
floor. Repeat this on the next screen. If you don't get
everything, things will be harder later on when you have to run back
along the same route. Keep going right until a huge black bear-type
monster falls in front of you. Turn left immediately and run back
the way you came. Don't stop. Run past the pool where you started,
onto the next screen and jump off the edge of the cliff, grabbing
the vine. Swing back to the right and drop. When you hit the
ground, run right again until both you and the beast are shot at by
the aliens.
</P>

<H3>THE PRISON - "HICI"</H3>

<P>
You wake up in a cage with one of the terrestrials. Rock the cage
by pulling left and right on the joystick until it crashes on top of
your captor. Pick up his gun. Follow the alien right and, upon
entering the next screen, shoot the monster. When you get to the
triple doors, turn around and make shields that last long enough for
your companion to open the doors. Run right when the doors open and
go down one floor in the lift. Go left and blast the door. Quickly
run back to the lift. Go down and up again as fast as you can; this
will make the guard think that he imagined the explosion. Go back
over to the hole above the guard and pull down before running left.
Push up and wait for your companion to open a hatch. He'll then
pull you up to the sewer level.
</P>

<H3>THE SEWERS - "FLLD"</H3>

<P>
Simple and quick. Left falls into the sewer. Left, right, right,
left, right and out.
</P>

<H3>THE fIRST RECHARGER - "LIBC"</H3>

<P>
Recharge your gun and blast the triple doors. Recharge again and go
right, past the blue dome and onto the next screen. Duck quickly
and shoot the alien with the Mohican. Run right and - just as you
are about to go off the edge of the screen - jump. You should land
on a ledge. Blast a hole in the mountainside and enter it.
</P>

<H3>THE CAVES - "CCAL"</H3>

<P>
Drop down the first and second holes onto the balanced rock. Turn
right and jump off the ledge of the next screen, where you'll find
some bones. Observe the falling rocks at the left-hand side of the
screen, they drop in a pattern. Time your run and stop in a clear
space. Take each of these two screens in two stages and you'll
pass. Keep going right and here you'll find the trickiest part of
the game. Suspended from the ceiling are various tentacles for you
to negotiate. Scattered across the ground are mouths which grasp at
your heels, waiting to rip you apart. Don't be afraid to get close.
The first set simply require you to hop over them, but the second
needs a swift combination of a long jump and skip. Run right and
blast the wall. Go back past the creatures to the falling rocks
which cannot harm you this time. Go up the slope and shoot at the
bat-like creature. Go to the far left edge. Jump up onto the
stalactite and wait for the bat to be grabbed by the tentacles.
Then quickly jump from one stalactite to another until you reach the
last one. Here you must do a big jump to land back on the balancing
rock. Jump off the left side and blast the support column from
underneath it. Run up the slope and keep going, jumping the holes
as you run, until you come across a huge cavern of water supported
by a slim column. Blast the column and run left, jumping the holes
again, until you find yourself standing on a small flat rock over a
hole. You will be shot up to the next ledge and all that's left to
do is to run past the waterfall.
</P>

<H3>BY THE WATERFALL - "KCIJ"</H3>

<P>
Run right and jump off the egde of the stairs, firing as soon as you
land. Go right and jump over the stairs and go to the next screen.
Make a shield and walk towards the doors. As long as there is a
shield in front of you, the alien will throw his bombs. All you
have to do is walk away from the doors, making them close, and the
plasma balls will rebound towards him. When he's dead, run right,
blasting the door as you go, and recharge your weapon. Now go left
past the waterfall and go down the stairs. Go back right and jump
down stairs. Duck and blast the alien then go up stairs and blast
the chandelier (this releases your companion). Go right and at the
bottom of the stairs, as you go onto the next screen, you will be
punched and knocked backwards. When your assailant has a hold of
you press fire to kick him in the nuts. Run left and grab the gun.
Duck and blast and then go right. When you're in the second arch
turn around, make a shield and turn again to make a shield on the
other side. Shoot the alien on the left, then the one on the right,
and then go right. This requires a lot of practice. Try not to
make a shield behind a column or you won't be able to see how much
damage it's received.
</P>

<H3>BY THE WATER-FILLED PIT - "EDIL"</H3>

<P>
Dive into the water and start swimming down. Don't hang around as
you've only got a limited air supply. Turn left when you reach the
bottom and swim straight past the hole in the ceiling to the second.
Swim up here and catch your breath. Now go straight down and into
the hole that you passed on your way in. Turn right at the bottom
and climb out. Blast the electric cable and go back the way you
came in, remembering to catch your breath. Climb out on the
right-hand side. Run right and duck when the alien is just about to
fire at you. Move forward so that you're close enough for the bombs
to discharge before hitting you. Shoot the blighter as he walks out
from behind the shields.
</P>

<H3>ABOVE LIGHTED AREA - "LALD"</H3>

<P>
Drop down the hole on the right. Turn right quickly and blast the
door. Run very fast, ignoring the laser fire that's going on around
you. Don't stop until you come to a grate. Stop just in front of
the plate in the roof and make a shield on your left. Keep making
shields until your companion rescues you. You will now be pulled up
through the ceiling and clamber into a tank. The directions for
pressing the correct buttons are: fire, down, fire, left, left,
down, fire, up, up, up and fire. You will now be launched into the
female baths.
</P>

<H3>FEMALE BATHS - "LFEK"</H3>

<P>
When you land, run immediately to the right or you're toast. As you
run along someone breaks through the glass window. Keep running.
When on the floor, push towards the control panel. When the alien
(red-eyed beast) is about to walk under the rectangle in the roof,
pull the first level by pressing the button. A laser will frazzle
him. Then quickly pull the next lever and crawl towards the light.
Lasers will fire into the floor just missing you. Don't worry, only
the third blast can harm you so you should have plenty of time. You
will be beamed up to the roof, reunited with your friend and
ceremoniously fly off into the distance together.
