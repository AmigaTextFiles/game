<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
When cruising the highway don't stop shooting, and always choose
the highest paid mission. Buy fuel carefully, only enough fuel for
that level, after level 1 you must buy a leanburner. Try to stay
in the middle of the road and travel fast, travelling slowly only
burns more fuel. Fire bombs are more useful than smart bombs when
you learn how to use them. Bulletproofing is necessary after level
2. When travelling through the barriers the best speed is 90-120mph.

<UL>
<LI>LEVEL 1:

<OL>
<LI>Select counterfeit money.
<LI>Fuel up to 14 notches on the fuel guage.
<LI>Get turbo, 4 battering rams and two flare bombs.
<LI>After the first bikes slow down or the gunners will kill you.
<LI>Destroy trucks from as far away as possible.
<LI>Slow to 100-150 mph to negotioate barriers.
<LI>If you stay in the middle lane when you come to the wrecks
 you wont die.
</OL>

<LI>LEVEL 2:

<OL>
<LI>Select kidnapped official.
<LI>Fuel up to half full.
<LI>Buy leanburner, a few bullet proofs, rams, and flare bombs.
<LI>After first bikes there's a nasty surprise in the valley below.
</OL>

<LI>LEVEL 3: DARKLANDS

<OL>
<LI>Select plutonium.
<LI>Fuel up to half full (if you have leanburner - if you don't
then fill up to the max.
<LI>Buy rams, bullet proofing, flare bombs and lives if you need
them.
<LI>The toughest part of the course is early on, so don't be
afraid to let loose with the flare bombs.
</OL>

<LI>LEVEL 4: THE GUTTER RUN

<OL>
<LI>Select illegal chemicals. fill up to max level.
<LI>Buy maximum rams, bullet proofs and as many lives as you can
afford and flare and smart bomb depending on your bank balance.
<LI>The barriers are every where on this level and you will need
to be at 90 - 100 mph to avoid them all. Try to save your
rams for later in the level.
<LI>The alleys in 4 are real mean. Smartbombs and bullet
proofing are your best chances of survival.
</OL>

<LI>LEVEL 5: GRAVEYARD

<OL>
<LI>Choose the president. Fill up to maximum fuel.
<LI>Buy everything $40,000 up front plus whatever you had from
the last level should be enough, lives should be on the top
of your shopping list followed by rams, proofing, brakes,
armour and weapons - don't bother with the wheelblades!
<LI>do the same as for the last level. Because your car's at
maximum everything, this level shouldn't proove too
difficult.
