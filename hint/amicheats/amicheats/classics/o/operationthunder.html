<P>
On the high score table enter your name as "WIGAN NINJA", to recieve
infinite lives. Also if you get a score of 50,000 or more die and
type "SPECCY MODE" on the high score table. This will give you
twice as many enemies. Press 'F8', 'F7', 'F6', 'F5', 'F4', 'F3',
'F8' and then 'F1' three times (oR 'F2' three times) ('F1' and 'F2'
are for what player is to have the sight). This will give you the
laser sight thoughout the game. Also, type "EDOM TAEHC" on the high
score table for infinite lives.
</P>

<P>
Usually you have to shoot equipment boxes to get the laser sight,
but press 'F8' and fire at the same time on the title screen and you
will start a 1 player game with laser sight. For 2 players press
'F2' instead of 'F8' on the title screen.

Hit the following keys in sequence to have the laser sight
throughout the game:
