<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
It's your serve. Now you can play pro-circuit volleyball year 'round
with Over The Net, the exciting new tournament beach volleyball
game from Merit Software. This European-designed program lets you
slam, dig, set, spike, and hit with arcade action so realistic
you'll be able to feel the hot sand under your feet. Sound effects
and excellent soundtracks bring an added dimension to the game on
your computer screen. Action-packed Over The Net is designed to
sharpen your competitive edge. One or two players can play from one
to five sets in a single session. Choose from five exotic beach
courts, from Timini to Miami to Ibiza - each designed to test a
different level of your skill. So what are you waiting for? It's
your serve.

<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
First, choose a one set game, play the sea-cup and enter one team or
two human players. When it's your turn to serve, move the
non-serving player up to the top of the court close to the net.
This will force one of the computer players to follow him. Now do a
jump serve (push up and fire), then hit the ball to the other
computer player by pushing right then down. The ball should drop
between him and the net and he should miss the ball. Hopefully this
plan should work. I don't know if it works with the other teams
like Coco, Freaks etc but it works with the Rollers and the Golden
Boys.
