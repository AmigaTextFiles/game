<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Beamed down to the planet Ixion from the Legion Ship, Cisskel,
aspiring Captain Ku-Kabul has to face the dangers and tests
specifically placed on this planet in order to prove himself worthy
of leadership. Failing any of the tests will end his career as a
Legion-Command Officer... permanently! To give him a fighting
chance, Ku-Kabul is fitted with twin laser cannons and refuelable
jet boosters. Using brains and brawn, he must find, collect, and use
objects to solve the many perplexing puzzles and defeat the hordes
of deviously powerful enemies that infest this deadly arena.
Powerful arcade special effects including full-screen three-layer
parallax scrolling running arcade speed, larger than screen aliens,
and a haunting musical score combine with furious gameplay to bring
you an incomparable arcade-like gaming experience.
