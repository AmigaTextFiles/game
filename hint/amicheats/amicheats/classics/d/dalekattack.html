<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
A lot of people are having trouble getting into the city from the
caves. After you have destroyed the tunnelling machine and survived
your encounter with the Super Dalek, go through the door he was
guarding. You will then find yourself in a small room with no
obvious exits. Use your grenades to destroy the floor section and
you will soon find yourself on your way to the city.
