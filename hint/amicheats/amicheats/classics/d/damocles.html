<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Paul Woakes, one of Europe's best-known programmers, has created an
ingenious and challenging real time 3-D adventure. Interactive
gameplay allows users to capture 3-D objects and relocate them at
will. Player-operated explosives give very graphic results. Use too
much explosive and you'll blow yourself up! Features include:
Frequent day/night changes with dynamic views of sun/moon/planet
risings and settings, 37 city sites, 3000 multi-room buildings and
over 200 movable gameplay objects. Buying and selling of objects
lends an interesting twist to the game.
</P>

<H2>FUN</H2>

<P>
On Midas reference 577-341 you can find a pyramid which contains a
magic crystal. To use it, you'll need the book from the trader at
Eris capital city (13-5). Reading the book while in possession of
the crystal will allow one wish to be granted. Try some of the
following wishes:
</P>

<P>
I WISH I HAD A CHEESE SANDWICH<BR>
I WISH I HAD MORE TIME<BR>
I WISH I COULD RECIEVE 1,000,000 CREDITS<BR>
I WISH THE UNIVERSE WAS MORE COLOURFUL<BR>
I WISH I KNOW HOW TO USE AUTHOR'S COMPUTER<BR>
I WISH I HAD MERCENARY 3 NOW
</P>

<P>
Once you've figured out how to destroy a planet, try the technique
on various planets. Especially Gaea, Dion, and Eris.
</P>

<P>
Blast the lock off the door of the Author's House and steal his
computer and his chair. They both have actual uses, and do quite
interesting things.
</P>

<P>
Blow up the Author's Computer with an explosive. Then get well
clear... that is, well clear of EVERYTHING.
</P>

<P>
Each planet and/or moon has some information and history associated
with it. Benson (your computer) doesn't always present it upon your
visit to said world. Keep trying until you do get it.
</P>

<P>
Try to land on the sun (Dialis).
</P>

<P>
Crash your spaceship in the ocean.
</P>

<P>
Land on the roof of a building, get out, then stroll over the
edge...
</P>

<P>
Get yourself locked into the jail on Metis.
</P>

<P>
There are lots of nice vantage points to watch Eris's destruction
from. Vesta is quite decent. The best place, of course, is on Eris
itself. If you're on the right part of the planet, you'll get to
see the comet plunging through the atmosphere directly towards you.
</P>

<P>
Watch the control towers at spaceports; they change color to warn
you when your ship gets near.
</P>

<P>
Lots of the stuff in Damocles is quite closely related to British
politics, although the passage of time since its release has
obsoleted some of the jokes. For example, the Lawson Banks are
named after Nigel Lawson, the chancellor of the Exchequer at the
time Damocles was being written (although by the time it actually
came out, he wasn't any more...) You can find the Prime Minister's
proposal for the poll tax in the basement of the Hall of Government
on Vesta; she predicts it will be well-received...
</P>

<P>
The Novagen offices are full of inside jokes and hints on the game.
You will find the keys in a pub on Dion East.
</P>

<P>
Noticed the road signs near the Novagen building on Dion? Novagen's
real offices are on Alcester Road, Birmingham, England, and the one
in the game bears an intentional physical resemblance to the real
one. The same goes for the Author's House.
</P>

<H2>THE 5 WINNING WAYS</H2>

<OL>
<LI>Find all eight explosives and the timed detonator. Go to
Damocles. Drop seven explosives and set the eighth to detonate.
Depart posthaste and collect reward: $10,000,000. Note that you
can bargain the State President o $25,000,000 by turning down her
first offers.
<LI>Ditto, but blow up Icarus instead before Damocles passes it.
Without Icarus's gravitational pull, Damocles's course is altered so
it misses Eris by a good margin. Collect $10,000,000 from the State
President and $25,000,000 from Lloyds' for solving the problem
without destroying Damocles.
<LI>Using the Nova Bomb instead of explosives, repeat #1 or #2
above.
<LI>Use the Magic Wishing Crystal on Midas and wish that Eris (or
both Eris and Damocles) would be saved. (the "Wishes Solution")
<LI>Using the Author's Computer, blow up Damocles (planet #29.)

* The key to the Acheron/Midas puzzle is in either sphynx. Go in
the hidden side door at the sphynx's knee. On the front wall is a
pyramid number, but you can only read it if you're carrying the
reading glasses from Lucan. Translate it into planetary
coordinates:

<OL>
<LI>Divide by 4096 and drop the fraction. Call this PX.
<LI>Get the remainder from step 1. Call this PY. The pyramids are
arranged in a large square, 4096 pyramids on a side. PX and PY
locate the pyramid in this grid.
<LI>Divide PX by 4.096 and drop the fraction to get the planetary X
coord.
<LI>Divide PY by 4.096, drop the fraction and add 250. This is the
planetary Y coordinate. Now go to Midas.
