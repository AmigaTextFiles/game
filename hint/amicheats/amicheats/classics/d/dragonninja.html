<P>
When ever you want or need more lives press 'LEFT ALT' and type
"IMAGINE". Then press 'RETURN'. This will give you an extra life.
You can have up to four guys at one time.

This next one I couldn't get to work, but it may work on other
versions.

<P>
During the game, type "TERRIFIC" and press 'L' to skip levels and
'F3' gives you infinite lives.
