<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Fantasy role-playing in an island world. Players must escape from
prison, find out why magic has been banned on the planet, and
prevent the unleashing of the dragons guarding the city-states.
</P>

<H2>CHEATS</H2>

<P>
If you do a "changetaskpri -1" beore running Dragon Wars, your Amiga
will continue to multi-task. Moving it to a lower priority works
great. I have run downloads, formatted disks, and played Dragon
Wars, all at the same time.
</P>

<P>
If you press 'Amiga-E', you will see the game's ending sequence (it
also ends the game, so be sure to save it before pressing Amiga-e).
</P>

<H2>SOLVE</H2>

<P>
The game provides pre-built characters but also supports characters
from Bard's Tale I, II, and III. Since I had saved characters from
a Bard's Tale game, I decided to use them to play Dragon Wars. Word
of advise on using Bard's Tale characters: first examine the
pre-built characters that come with Dragon Wars and write down their
stats and skills, create characters from your Bard's Tale game and
do the same. Compare the two sets of characters closely paying
particular attention to Magic skill/knowledge. There are five types
of magic in Dragon Wars: Low, High, Sun, Druid and Misc. Ideally
you will want your party to have knowledge of low, high, sun and
druid magic types or as many as possible. Choose which ever
character group has the best representation of knowledge in magic.
</P>

<P>
Dragon Wars includes an automapping feature which can be viewed by
pressing "?". While this is intended to remove the need of the
players to map the game areas on graph paper and is wonderfully
useful, I still mapped the game out on paper. The deficiency of
automaps is that you can take no notes on them, nor mark spots that
have a particular importance. While it was time consuming for me to
draw out the maps it was time well spent. I advise you to do the
same. If nothing else, the automap feature will ensure that your
drawn maps are accurate.
</P>

<P>
Except for the beginning of the game, where you go and when is
completely up to you. My notes are arranged after discussion of
PURGATORY (start game area) and the MAGAN UNDERWORLD in alphabetical
order and ending with SALVATION and DEPTHS OF NISIR which are the
end game areas. The notes listed in alphabetical order are by NO
means a recommendation of when you should do what. It is merely an
effort on my part to make this file easier for you to use.
</P>

<P>
Dragon Wars has a simple and fast save feature. To protect
yourself, though, you should exit the game from time to time and
copy the file data1 to another (save1 or Lansk or whatever name
reminds you of the point of save). These files are HUGE being close
to 300K in size but potentially worth their weight in gold!
</P>

<H3>PURGATORY: START GAME</H3>

<P>
Upon starting the game, you find your characters in the city of
Purgatory with absolutely no equipment, money or clothes.
Fortunately this sad condition is easily remedied. In the middle of
the north end of Purgatory there is an arena anxious for new victims
for their gladiators. "Fight gladiators barefisted and
barebottomed" you think... not to worry, the arena will offer to
equip your characters. They offer a range of low end equipment,
leather armor, maces, swords and all of it free for the fighting.
You're going to lose the fight, I might as well tell you that now,
but in most cases you are not going to die so while you'll get
thrown out of the arena a little worse for the wear, you will have
equipment. (I recommend that you save your game before entering the
arena just in case one of your characters should bite the dust.)
</P>

<P>
Now that your characters have basic equipment, its time to explore
your new prison, I mean home. There are such lovely things to do in
Purgatory. You can sell yourself as a slave in the slave market,
join the thieves guild, listen for rumors in the tavern and even ask
for a volunteer! Seriously, do ask for a volunteer in the tavern
which is in the north-east portion of the city. You'll pick up a
volunteer named Ulrik who has skills in Cave Lore and Axes. He's
not a great character, but he's nice to have along. Don't join the
thieves' guild which is located in the south-west portion of the
city. Here you should stoutly maintain your honor. Doing so will
give you a mini-quest to defeat the Humbaba monster in the
north-east corner of the city. When you do defeat the Humbaba,
return to the guild and you will be given 1000 gold pieces for your
efforts! The slave market is one way out of Purgatory but there are
others and there is nothing of great importance to find there.
</P>

<P>
There is a magic shop in the west side of Purgatory. For any
characters who have Low Magic, this is a great place to pick up the
spells for that magic and they are FREE. Along the north wall (west
of the arena) is the Black Market, a good place to buy some better
equipment with the 1000 gold you obtained from the thieves.
Probably the best use of your money at this stage is in better
armor. (Do not buy dragon stones at this point. They are expensive
and within Purgatory, unnecessary. On the south side of the city
there is a magic pool which will restore magic energy.)
</P>

<H4>BLACK MARKET OF PURGATORY</H4>

<P>
Hand Axe ---- 60g | Cloth -------- 25g<BR>
Small Pick -- 50g | Leather ------ 50g<BR>
Pick -------- 60g | Brigadine ---- 80g<BR>

Mace -------- 40g<BR>
Dagger ------ 30g<BR>
Short Sword - 50g<BR>

</P>

<P>

Crossbow --- 60g<BR>
Arrow (20) - 50g<BR>
Bolt(20) --- 60g<BR>
Javelin ---- 40g
</P>

<P>
There is a secret passage in the northwest corner of the city that
will gain you access to the outer wall. There are many encounters
in this wall area with guards which can generate additional cash
slowly. In the southeast corner of the outer wall there is a gap in
the stones leading to the waters below. Try using SWIM if you
decide to use this exit from Purgatory, but I recommend using the
Magan Underworld instead. You can also exit Purgatory in the the
southwest corner of the outer wall. Again, I suggest the Magan
Underworld as the best choice.
</P>

<H4>SKILLS, POWER REGENERATION, INVENTORY</H4>

<P>
Logic might dictate that this paragraph belongs before actually
getting into the game itself. I choose to include it after basic
notes about Purgatory because you need to have a rudimentary
understanding of how the game works to appreciate/understand the
advise I will give here. Dragon Wars is a skill based system which
means that any time your characters advance a level you have to
decide from three menu pages where you're going to put your "two
cents worth". The documentation that comes with the game advises
that you spread the knowledge/skills around among your characters.
This is good advise. There are so many options, there is no way
within this game that you can make one character completely skilled
so DON'T TRY. Decide which character will specialize in what
skills. You might want to make one concentrate on Lore (arcane,
mountain, forest, etc) and another on the thiefly skills
(pickpocket, lockpick, etc.). Get all the skills covered one way or
another, but spread the "workload" over all your characters.
</P>

<P>
Perhaps my only great complaint with Dragon Wars concerns the skill
based system. When a character advances a level you only get 2
points to apply to the skills/attributes. It is very difficult to
know how to spend these 2 points wisely. Many skills and attributes
cost 2 points to increase 1 point. Obtaining a new magic knowledge
costs 10 points! To give you an example of the significant cost
that reflects, my characters at end game were around 14th level and
they did not begin the game at 1st level (because I transferred
characters from Bard's Tale). That represents a lot of level
advancements in which I could make no improvements on characters I
wished or needed to obtain a new magic knowledge.
</P>

<P>
To cast spells you have to have magic power. Every time you cast a
spell some magic power is drained. There are two ways to regenerate
magic power. One is the use of Dragon Stones or Eyes and the other
is to find a magic pool that restores energy. Dragon Stones restore
20 points of power and Dragon Eyes restore 30 points. Magic pools
restore all magic points and have the added advantage of being free!
Dragon Stones can be purchased in many locations throughout Dragon
Wars for 250 gold. Dragon Eyes can only be found as treasure.
Magic pools are far and few between, but fortunately there are a few
in some excellent locations that you can take full advantage of
during the game. There is a magic pool in PURGATORY in the
south-east corner (there are actually two corners in Purgatory that
you could call south-east, the magic pool is located in the southern
most one of the two). Make good use of this pool to restore your
magician's power and allow you to heal your characters as you
explore this city.
</P>

<P>
Inventory is the other area where I experienced frustration with
Dragon Wars. Your characters can only carry so much which in and of
itself is acceptable. The problem arises when you run out of space.
Dragon Wars does not provide any means of storing items in a
location for use later. To further complicate matters some treasure
chests that you find will disappear after you have opened them so if
you were unable to take all the treasure, it will not be there when
you return. This is not true of ALL treasure chests, but being true
at all can cause problems. Some treasures are unique and needed to
solve the game. It is not always clear which items are important
and which are not. Some locations have numerous treasures available
and your characters are soon out of space. I managed to avoid
problem related to inventory in my own game, but it is worth noting
so that you manage your own character's inventory with care. You
will find lots of weapons in this game. Examination of an item
tells you what strength or dexterity or skill is needed to use it.
Examination does not tell you the kind of damage the weapon is
capable of inflicting. To get a rough idea of the power of a
weapon, look at its value on the SELL menu. The more valuable an
item is the better it is. Some weapons/items have spells on them.
Some of these are worth keeping in your inventory, but in general
don't carry around a lot of items for which you have no real use.
Sell them for the money. Now back to the game!
</P>

<H3>MAGAN UNDERWORLD</H3>

<P>
There is on the west side of the city an entrance to the Magan
Underworld. The Magan Underworld represents one of the largest
single areas in the game excluding the above ground world. Its a
wonderful place and accessable to many of the other locations in
Dragon Wars. The Magan Underworld is a very important place within
the game. There is so much to be found here that it is difficult to
know where to begin telling you of its wonders. Since this area
"wraps" upon itself, it is almost impossible to tell you where you
will find what in this area. If we use your point of entrance from
Purgatory into the Magan Underworld for reference, we can get a
general sense of direction. (note: place this point in the center
of your graph paper if you do decide to commit areas to hard copies)
</P>

<P>
To the north of your point of entrance you will find two buildings.
The smaller of the two contains stairs that will lead you to the
Lansk Undercity (a tough place for beginning characters, but has an
armory, healer and weapons shop not far from the stairs). The
larger building of the two, while located here, is only accessable
from Necropolis and contains the only means of resurrecting your
characters within the game. Also to the north is a small river and
lake. On the southern side of the lake there is a magic pool that
restores magic power. This particular pool provided me with endless
use so its handy to know exactly where it is located. In the center
of the lake there is a small island called the ISLE OF WOE. You
will not be able to reach this island until later in the game, when
you get the Golden Boots from Mud Toad's Priests, but it is a very
important location.
</P>

<P>
There is a doorway that leads by (on the north side) of the larger
of the two buildings to the area where you can see the location of
the ISLE OF WOE. This are is bounded by water and pits. IMPORTANT:
The first pit area to the west of the water in this area is safe to
walk upon. Doing so will result in 5 points that can be spent upon
character skill/attribute development. Don't miss this!! You
cannot fall into the pits in THIS area (not true everywhere else) so
check around until you locate this square. 5 points is too much to
pass by.
</P>

<P>
To the west of point of entry there are stairs leading up to the
MYSTIC WOODS. To avoid any confusion the means of returning to the
Magan Underworld from the Mystic Woods is to use the ability CLIMB.
I didn't realize this when I was first playing the game and it
caused me to restore the game to an earlier point. You can avoid my
difficulty. 3 squares south and 3 squares west of the entrance to
the Mystic Woods is the first of two treasures that can be found in
the Magan Underworld.
</P>

<P>
TREASURE 1:<BR>
Rusty Axe (str 18)<BR>
Speed Wand (casts Zak's Speed)<BR>
Bomb (3 quantity) (casts Zak's Speed)<BR>
Dragon Stones (10 quantity)
</P>

<P>
To the east of point of entry are stairs leading to Tar's Ruins
Underground. This is a relatively small area map that wraps upon
itself. There are secret passages that reveal treasures which I
will detail later. To re-enter the Magan Underworld, you must again
use the ability CLIMB.
</P>

<P>
To the south our point of entry to the Magan Underworld is an area
with many fires. Each of these fires causes damage to your
characters. There is in the north area of the fires the 2nd
treasure to be found in the Magan Underworld.
</P>

<P>
TREASURE 2:<BR>
Slicer (sword) (str 17)<BR>
Dragon Stones (10 quantity)
</P>

<P>
Also in the fire are is the entrance to the Dwarf Clan Hall. Early
in the game you do not need to access this area.
</P>

<P>
To the east of the fire area is a large pit and an path leading
south. This path forms a cross shaped area with an entrance to
SALVATION. Along the path you will encounter fairies that will ask
if you are willing to sacrifice a life to continue. Replying "yes"
will reduce you party to minimun life force. While there is reason
to use this path near the end of the game, you need not explore it
before hand.
</P>

<H3>OTHER AREAS LISTED ALPHABETICALLY:</H3>

<P>
BRIDGE between Isle of the Sun and Forlorn:
</P>

<P>
You need Citizen papers to cross this bridge.
</P>

<P>
BRIDGE between Lansk and Isle of the Sun:
</P>

<P>
Pikemen here will ask to search your packs and if allowed to do so
will ask a percentage in gold of what you are carrying to cross the
bridge. Refusal to pay results in an encounter with 3 pikemen.
This is not a difficult encounter and better than paying the fee.
Of note on this bridge is the building containing the Armory. Enter
the building once and you just get thrown out. Enter twice and you
can fight it out with the guards. If successful you can reach the
armory (there is a pit in the room before it which will cause damage
to your party) and reap the following:

Located on King's Island, Byzanople is only accessable from the
Siege Camp. As you enter this area for the first time, you will be
on the outside of the walls and if you get too close will be hit by
a lot of arrow fire. Directly north and 1 square to the east of
where you enter are stairs leading down. Alternately, there is also
an entrance in the southeastern area. Here you will need to move a
rock (strength) to reveal an opening. Both lead you to the Byzan
Dungeon. You will not obtain access to Byzanople proper until after
you have completed Byzan Dungeon. In the city there is a healer, an

barrier blocking your path to the east. You can by pass this
barrier with the use of Soften Stone. The eastern portion of this
area is also accessable from King's Island if you have the Jade Eyes

which will result in you being thrown into the dungeon under
Kingshome (see related notes).
</P>

<P>
KINGSHOME CASTLE:
</P>

<P>
Accessable from the Kingshome Dungeon (once only) and from King's
Island (if you have the Signet Ring, see Decaying City). If you
came up from the dungeon you will have a peaceful encounter with
Namtar in the north central area of the castle. Exiting his room
will cause the door to disappear forever. Doors in the north will
lead you into the wall area. On the west side is a gallery and a
closet full of Pilgrim's Garb (needed to take Pilgrim's ferry to

for beginning characters, be prepared to do everything at one time.
You will not be able to return here once you leave. You will find
your group in a prison cell which is not locked. To the south are
guards just waiting to beat you up. If you survive that, to the
east is a door that leads to stairs going up. Don't take them until
you have continued all the east and north to the last door in the
hallway. There are some big encounters here, but this last room
contains the King's armory:
</P>

<P>

<P>
Accessable only after restoring Lanac's statue in Mud Toad. You
will need the spell SOFTEN STONE to successfully complete this area.
The map wraps upon itself both north to south and east to west. To
the northeast of your point of entry, through several walls is a
large room in which three treasures will be found:
</P>

<P>
TREASURE 1:<BR>
Healing Potion<BR>
Battle Wand, Battle Power spell<BR>
Dragon Shield
</P>

<P>
TREASURE 2:<BR>
Fire Storm, (sun magic)<BR>
Zak's Speed, (misc magic)<BR>
Kill Ray, (misc magic)<BR>
Mage Fire, (low magic)<BR>
Dazzle, (high magic)<BR>
Sun Stroke, (sun magic)
</P>

<P>
TREASURE 3:<BR>
Lanac's Spectacles (needed to gain access into Magic College)
</P>

<P>
To the northwest of point of entry is an entrance to the Magan
Underworld. It is a one way trip.
</P>

<P>
LANSK:
</P>

<P>
Accessable from Dilmun (outdoors) or the Lansk Undercity (no way
back to undercity though), this is a bureaucratic nightmare. The
officials here will have you running all over the city to get paper
work done. This is easily avoided by making use of EZ Paperwork in
the Lansk Undercity. There is one treasure to be found on the west
side of the city.
</P>

<P>
TREASURE 1:<BR>
Druids Mace, Cure All spell
</P>

<P>
In the northeast area of the city, you will learn in the Quarter
Masters Office the Mog the Slave Owner has left his estate, which is
to be found on Forlorn, to you. The Quarter Master doesn't know why
Mog did this and neither do I!
</P>

<P>
Encounters in this city are nasty for beginning characters if not
impossible. They can and should be avoided until later in the game.
</P>

<P>
LANSK UNDERCITY:
</P>

<P>
Accessable to the Magan Underworld, this place was very useful to
me. Encounters here are rough for new and middle characters, but
you can do a lot of exploring here if you are careful.
</P>

<P>
There are four shops and a healer in this area that are all useful.
The armorer, weapon and healer are all on the east side of this
area. EZ paperwork and the Magic shop are on the west. The magic
shop is located through a secret passage which is easily found.
</P>

</P>

<P>
Paperwork: The Governors Pass is needed to cross a bridge between
Quag and Lansk. The Kings Ticket is needed to take the ferry. The
Citizen Papers are needed to cross the bridge between the Isle of
the Sun and Forlorn.
</P>

<P>
On the north of this area is a ferry to Kings Island. Use the Kings
Ticket for passage (not recommended for early characters). In the
center of this area is a dragon (he won't kill you). To access the
dragon's area, you must use a secret passage on the east side of the
center building. Rumors you will hear elsewhere will hint that the
Lansk Dragon conceals a gem. To get the gem you will need to use an
anhk which can be purchase in Mud Toad. On the west side of this
center building are stairs leading up to the city of Lansk. They go
up, but they do NOT come back down. Go this way only if you have
saved your game and are certain that you wish to.
</P>

<P>
MAGIC COLLEGE:
</P>

<P>
Located on the island of Rustic. You will need the Spectacles from
Lanc'toor's Laboratory located under Mud Toad before you will be
able to enter the college. The college consists of a number of
tests. In the first room, use any ICE spell. In the second room
use REV GLAMOUR and then any FIRE spell. In the third room use
CLOKE ARCANE. In the fourth room use no magic, just fight it out
with the philistine. In the fifth room use DISARM TRAP. In the
sixth room, walk north ignoring the comments (paragraph note 145) in
the next room. Utnapishtim will reward you with the choice of the
Soul Bowl, the Laugh Staff or the Sing Ring, choose the SOUL BOWL
which you will need at Zaton's marker in the Mystic Woods.
</P>

<P>

</P>

<P>
MUD TOAD:
</P>

<P>
Located on Quag, this city is sinking into the swampy lands upon
which it was built. You will probably be making many visits to this
city during the course of your game. Almost in the center of the
city is a broken statue the parts of which you will find scattered
through out other areas in the game. You will need to bring each
part back to this location and "use item" to restore the statue.
Doing so will reveal a latch that will allow you access to
Lanac'toor's Lab (see appropriate notes). Of other interest in this
city is the temple in the northwest corner of the city. Talking to
the priests there will indicate that you need to seal up the source
of the water ruining the city (create wall will accomplish this
nicely). After doing so, the priests will give you a pair of Golden
Boots which will allow you to access areas that you could not
previously (such as the Isle of Woe in the Magan Underworld). Also
of importance here is the shop in the southeastern portion of town:
</P>

<P>
Lantern ------- 10g<BR>
Ankh ---------- 50g, Use on Dragon in Lansk<BR>
Dragon Stone - 250<BR>
Short Sword --- 70<BR>
Broad Sword --- 80<BR>
Great Sword -- 100<BR>
Bow ----------- 60<BR>
Arrow(20) ----- 50<BR>
Bolt(20) ------ 60
</P>

<P>
There is a tavern in the northeastern corner of town in which you
will meet Berengaria after you have had your confrontation with
Mystalvision in Phoebus and have been thrown into and escaped from
the Phoeban Dungeon. Berengaria will give you the following spells:
</P>

<P>
Rage of Mithras, (sun magic)<BR>
Holy Aim, (sun magic)<BR>
Armor of Lite, (sun magic)<BR>
Major Heal, (sun magic)<BR>
Summon Salamander, (sun magic)
</P>

<P>
Within the city walls which you can access by using climb you will
find a treasure beyond an encounter with the city militia.
</P>

<P>
TREASURE 1:<BR>
Water Summon, (high magic)<BR>
Reveal Glamour, (high magic)<BR>
Barbed Flail, str 16<BR>
Lucky Boots<BR>
Mountain Sword, mountain lore 1 (2handed)
</P>

<P>
MYSTIC FOREST:
</P>

<P>
Located on the west side of the Isle of the Sun near Phoebus. From
the Mystic Forest you can gain entry to the Magan Underworld, Kings
Island, Quag, as well as the Isle of the Sun. There are a number of
interesting and important things to find and do here. In the
northwest corner there is a statue of Enkidu at the foot of which
you will find a Beast Horn which is powered with a summoning spell.
In the northeast side you will locate Mushrooms that will be needed
in the Necropolis later (only 1 is needed though you can get as many
as you like) On the east side is a shrine on an island. You can try
to reach the shrine by swimming but that will result in encounters
with some very nasty water creatures. An easier way to access this
island is to use the Golden Boots which you can get in Mud Toad (see
Mud Toad for explaination). On the island you can get the Totem of
Enkidu which you will need to cross Scorpion Bridge. To get the
Totem, you must use one of your weapons. I used a Ruby Dagger and
cannot say if using any weapon will work. In the southwest corner
there is a treasure(1). In the south area of Mystic Forest there is
a marker for Master Zaton. Use the Soul Bowl that you can get after
successfully doing the Magic College in this location and you will
get treasure 2.
</P>

<P>
TREASURE 1:<BR>
Death Curse, (druid magic)<BR>
Fire Blast, (druid magic)<BR>
Insect Plague, (druid magic)<BR>
Scare, (druid magic)

</P>

<P>
NECROPOLIS:
</P>

<P>
This island to the northeast of Quag is accessable from Smuggler's
Cove. The entrance into the large building that is this city is on
the northwest. You will experience many encounters with undead here
so come prepared. In the middle of the first room you will find a
treasure:
</P>

<P>
TREASURE 1:<BR>
Stone Trunk, use on statue in Mud Toad<BR>
Black Helm, Zak's Speed<BR>
Magic Chain<BR>
Dead Bolt(20)
</P>

<P>
On the west side of the city are stairs the lead down to the large
building in the Magan Underworld that you could not access from
there. In this building is the well that will allow you to
resurrect dead characters. On the east side of the city you will
find a door leading to an area described as being covered with webs.
There is an encounter with a giant spider for every square in this
room but the reward at the end is a teleporter that will get you off
of the island. In the center of the city is a large building. On
the south side there is a secret passage leading inside. Following
this passage will lead you to an encounter with the god Nergal.
Defeat his undead minions and use MUSHROOMS that you obtained from
the Mystic Forest to get the following items:
</P>

<P>
FROM NERGAL:<BR>
Silver Key, used to free Irkalla on Isle of Woe<BR>
Holy Spear<BR>
Fire Lite, (high magic)<BR>
Insect Plague, (druid magic)<BR>
Scare, (druid magic)<BR>
Inferno, (sun magic)<BR>
Big Chill, (high magic)
</P>

<P>
OLD BRIDGE:
</P>

<P>
Located on King's Island this bridge is a one way route to the
Decaying City also known as the Snake Pit. There is nothing of
importance on the bridge itself, only the note that the gate, once
you pass through, disappears forever. Don't worry about that, there
is another exit within the city.
</P>

<P>
OLD DOCK:
</P>

<P>
Located on King's Island and accessable from the island and from the
ferry (with a Kings Ticket) in the Lansk Undercity. Passage to
Lansk Undercity costs 500g. Wearing Pilgrim's garb (obtainable in
Kingshome Castle) will allow you passage to Nisir. In the southwest
corner is a statue that can be moved if you have a character strong
enough (24).
</P>

<P>
STATUE TREASURE:<BR>
Earth Summon, (high magic)<BR>
Ice Wand<BR>
IBM PS/2<BR>
Dragon Stones(7)
</P>

<P>
This treasure will disappear after you leave the dock.
</P>

<P>
PHOEBAN DUNGEON:
</P>

<P>
Accessable only by confronting and loosing to Mystalvision in the
north section of Phoebus. This is one of those areas where you need
to be prepared to do everything at one time or not at all. There is
no way back here once you exit. You will find yourself in a locked
cell that your thief character will not be able to unlock. Patience
(10 days worth) will result in Berengaria leaving the door unlocked
so that you can begin your escape. Exploration of the other prison
cells will reveal that the "druid is being tortured". At the
location where you see message 102, use the abilility Hiding to get
past the guard. You may go either north or south once past the
guard. The southern route is through a secret door. Follow the
passage until you see the message that you hear voices to the north.
Go north through another secret passage. One square further to the
west of where you hear the voices is a cave in that you can pass
with the climb ability and will lead you to stairs back to Phoebus.
Save these for last. Go north and explore the rest of the Phoeban
Dungeon. In the northeast section you will find a hunchback trying
to feed a prisoner to a dragon. West of that you will find torture
chambers and the druid. Use bandage on the druid and he will tell
you that the pass word is "HALIFAX". To the north of the druid is
another encounter with Mystalvision. Its a toughy and Mystal will
slip through your fingers but leave you the following treasure:
</P>

<P>
MYSTALVISION:<BR>
Armor of Lite, (sun magic)<BR>
Major Heal, (sun magic)<BR>
Disarm Trap, (sun magic)<BR>
Wood Spirit, (druid magic)<BR>
Holy Aim, (sun magic)
</P>

<P>
To the northwest of the area where you heard the voices you will
find two treasures, one of which requires knowing the password to
reach.
</P>

<P>
TREASURE 1:<BR>

* combine this with the Gatlin Bow and you have a deadly
combination! Having searched the rest of this level, it is time to
exit back to Phoebus.
</P>

<P>
PHOEBUS:
</P>

<P>
This city on the west side of the Isle of the Sun is not easy for
beginning characters. You may be able to get through some of the
encounters to access treasure but there is an big encounter in this
city (located in the north end of town) that should not be attempted
until later in the game.
</P>

<P>
There is a tavern in the northwest portion of the city where you can
find the volunteer Valar. Valar has knowledge of both Low and Sun
magic. He's a good addition to your party, but keep him at the back
as he is rather weak and vulnerable to attack.
</P>

<P>
On the southeast side of town there are parade grounds. Within the
parade grounds is a building. Entering here will get you drafted
into the army and removed to the siege camp south of the city of
Byzanople. I recommend avoiding this automatic draft until later in
the game.
</P>

<P>
There are 3 treasures to be found in Phoebus, two on the west side
and one on the north.
</P>

<P>
TREASURE 1:<BR>
Poog's Vortex, (high magic)<BR>
Sun Stroke, (sun magic)<BR>

sell it.
</P>

<P>
PILGRIM DOCK:
</P>

<P>
Located on Nisir, this dock is accessable from the Old Dock on
King's Island providing you are wearing Pilgrim's Garb (available in
Kingshome). Passing through the door in the south of this small
area results in a nasty encounter which is beyond the ability of
beginning characters. Once successfully defeating these monsters,
you will find a prisoner and a secret passage that leads you to the
mountain Salvation.
</P>

<P>
QUAG:
</P>

<P>
This area of Dilmun includes a Nexus in the north to Mystic Woods,
the city of Yellow Mud Toad and Smuggler's Cove. Murk trees live on
this area and are dangerous monsters capable of killing party
members without much difficulty. Proceed with caution. Northest,
but not connected to Quag is Necropolis. A bridge also leads to the
area of Dilmun that includes Lansk.
</P>

<P>
QUAG BRIDGE:
</P>

<P>
You need the Governor's Pass to cross. The pass is obtainable in
either Lansk or Lansk Undercity (easier).
</P>

<P>
RUINS: (See TAR'S RUINS (above ground))
</P>

<P>
RUSTIC:
</P>

<P>
Accessable with the ship from Smuggler's Cove. This Island to the
west of King's Island contains the Game Preserve, Scorpion Bridge
and a Strange Building (Magic College).
</P>

<P>
SALT MINES:
</P>

<P>
If you sell yourself into slavery in Purgatory you end up here.
There is nothing of great importance to be found here. You can skip
this area entirely with no ill effect upon your game. What you can
gain here is experience and eventually freedom. I recommend using
the Magan Underworld. When you are brought here all your equipment
is removed and you are in chains. Wandering around this area you
will find a cup, a pool (fill the cup), a handle, a treasure of
rocks and Dragon Stones (9 quantity). You will find a man to which
you give the water. He will give you his shoes. Using the laces
(use item) you manage to make a hammer with which you can break the
chains. Your gear can be found in a pile of rubbage. Thus re-
equipped you can challenge the guards and escape.
</P>

<P>
SCORPION BRIDGE:
</P>

<P>
Located on the island of Rustic. Scorpion men will bar your way
until you use the ENKIDU TOTEM (obtainable in Mystic Woods). Within
the bridge building there are several nasty encounters. In the
north of this building is a treasure:
</P>

<P>
TREASURE 1:<BR>
Bones<BR>
Barbed Flail<BR>
Magic Shield<BR>
Gold (1500)
</P>

<P>
SIEGE CAMP:
</P>

<P>
Accessable from King's Island or by being drafted into the army in
Phoebus. Don't worry about joining the wrong side, your stay in the
Seige camp is temporary. Near the southern entrance to the Siege
Camp is a healer. In the north of this area is a Black Market.
</P>

<P>

</P>

<P>
TREASURE 1:<BR>
Lance Sword, str 12<BR>
Silver Gloves
</P>

<P>
TREASURE 2:<BR>
Silver Arrow
</P>

<P>
Exiting the Siege Camp to the north will allow you to enter
Byzanople. After some encounters in Byzanople (see appropriate
notes) you will return to the Siege Camp through a secret
underground passage. There will be a sizable battle which is
definitely too difficult for beginning characters.
</P>

<P>
SLAVE CAMP:
</P>

<P>
Located southwest of Purgatory, use Bureaucracy to gain the escaped
slaves trust. There are six small buildings located in the Slave
Camp and three treasures, a campfire that will heal all wounds and
the volunteer Louie can be found here. Use one of your magic skills
when you locate the wizard watching you from his doorway otherwise
he will not allow you into his hut to gather one of the treasures.

</P>

<P>
Located on Forlorn. You can learn in Lansk that Mog left this
estate to you. There are two buildings on the estate, one large and
one small. Surrounding the estate are gardens with numerous
statues. Enter the large building through either of the entrances
on the EAST side (there is an entrance on the west side, but do
avoid it). There are four treasures to be found in the large
building:
</P>

<P>
In the southwest corner of the large building you will find the
artisan of the statues you have seen in the gardens. He is really a
Gaze Monster. Use the MIRROR to avoid being turned to stone.
</P>

<P>
SMUGGLER'S COVE:
</P>

<P>
Located north of Mud Toad on Quag, this is the pirate hang out of
Long John Ugly. On the northeast you wlil find a statue to Irkalla
at which you can pray. On the west you will find Long John's hang
out. Use Bureaucracy and pay at least 50g to enter. Inside you
will find two doors, one to the west and the other to the south.
Taking the southern door, Long John will ferry you over to
Necropolis, but he will not bring you back (there is a way, but it
isn't easy for beginning characters). The west door reveals the
pirates most precious possession, a ship! The pirates will fight
you to the death for this ship and they are a nasty bunch! They can
be defeated, but it is not easy. Defeating them gets you not only
unlimited use of the ship, but also a treasure. This treasure chest
will disappear even if you do not remove all its contents. Take the
gold and the Jade Eyes and the plate.
</P>

<P>
TREASURE 1:<BR>
Gold (3000)<BR>
Pilgrim Garb, (available also in Kingshome)<BR>
Old Peg Leg<BR>

<P>
SNAKE PIT:
</P>

<P>
This city is located on the southwest corner of King's Island and is
accessable from the Old Bridge. On the north you will find the
King's boathouse. Leave the lad who is guarding this building alone
until you locate the secret rooms in the center of the large cluster
of buildings in the center of the city. In the wooded area in the
north you will find Branches. Use the Branches at the old man in
the tree on the south side of this area will get you the BEAST CALL
spell (druid magic). The STONE HEAD needed for the statue in Mud
Toad is found on the west shore of this area. There is a large
cluster of buildings in the center of the Snake Pit. A secret
passage from the room with the jester leads north into the room
where you will find two treasures:
</P>

<P>
TREASURE 1:<BR>

Jewels, (worth 4000g)
</P>

<P>
TREASURE 2:<BR>

access through a secret door to a boat that will take you out of
this area and left near Kingshome.
</P>

<P>
STRANGE BUILDING: (See MAGIC COLLEGE)
</P>

<P>
SUNKEN RUINS:
</P>

<P>
Accessable from the Eastern Isles (with the ship from Smuggler's
Cove), you need to have accomplished freeing Irkalla from the Isle
of Woe prior to fully exploring this area. Irkalla would have given
you a breath water potion that will be needed to enter the lower
level of this area. The upper level features a locked door that
take a skill of lockpick 4 to open and two secret passages. In the
center area there is a treasure:
</P>

<P>
TREASURE 1:<BR>
Driftwood<BR>
Flotsam<BR>
Spiked Flail<BR>
Driftwood
</P>

<P>
Using the breath water potion you can enter the lower area. The map
wraps upon itself here and is relatively small in size. In one
large room you will fing a clam containing the SKULL OF ROBA. Do
not attempt to take the skull from the clam, just take the clam
(skull and all). There is a locker to be found in this area (must
be Davy Jone's) in which is the following:
</P>

<P>
LOCKER:<BR>
Trident<BR>
Dragon Plate<BR>
Dragon Sword
</P>

<P>
The locker is guarded by some pretty nasty creatures, so throw
everything you've got at them or be prepared to take a trip through
the Necropolis to the well of resurrection.
</P>

<P>
TAR'S RUINS (above ground):
</P>

<P>
This area is accessable from Forlorn or from the Tar's Ruins
underground. To reveal the entrance to the underground use strength
on a rock on the northeast side. On the west side you will find the
body of a dead hero:
</P>

<P>

Dragon Stones, (6)
</P>

<P>
On the southwest, you will find a cache of scrolls:

Exorcism, (sun magic)<BR>
Guidance, (sun magic)
</P>

you will see mural. These murals are an important hint on how to
deal with the Lansk Dragon.
</P>

<P>
TAR'S RUINS (underground):
</P>

<P>
Accessable from the Magan Underworld and from the Ruins on Forlorn.
The entrance from the Magan Underworld leaves you in a small
enclosed room. To return to MUnderworld, use the ability climb, to
explore this area exit through the secret passage to the north.
Immediately west of the square just described is another secret room
containing STONE ARMS which are needed in Mud Toad. This area wraps
north to south, east to west. It doesn't take too much exploration
to locate the other two secret passages that contain treasures:

</P>

<P>
TREASURE 2:<BR>

<H3>END GAME AREAS & STRATEGY</H3>

<P>
Prior to visiting Salvation it is a good idea to spend some time in
the Magan Underworld near the energy pool that restores magic power
CHARGEing up magic items with spells upon them. Of particular use
are HEALING POTIONS, BATTLE WAND (battle power spell), DRAGON HORN
(rage of mithras spell), and the SPEED WAND (zak's speed). You may
choose to carry others at this point, but the above will make your
life in this end game period much easier. The maximum charges you
can boost in any item is 49. It will take some time to charge all
the items, but setting up a macro will make this easier and is
certainly worth the time and effort. If you have already visited
Salvation and taken the treasure that is to be found there, be
certain to stock up on DRAGON STONES before entering into the end
game period. Clear out of your inventory anything that you do not
need so that you can carry more dragon stones.

SALVATION:
</P>

<P>
Accessable from Nisir or Magan Underworld. The exit to Nisir is in
the north and the stairs to the Magan Underworld are in the
southwestern portion of this area. On the west side there is a
treasure guarded by a rather nasty group of monsters.

TREASURE 1:<BR>
Mage Staff, worth 10,000g<BR>
Dragon Helm<BR>
Dragon Plate<BR>
Spiked Mace<BR>
Heavy Sword<BR>
Dragon Eye (28), restores 30 points of magic power
</P>

<P>
On the east side of Salvation is a shrine to the universal god (note
97), use the Freedom Sword at this area. Doing so will allow you to
cast INFERNO SPELLS using the Freedom Sword. Not far from the
stairs to Magan Underworld and treasure 1 is a door. Avoid it.
Close to this door is an area where you will get a message about an
intelligent man could figure out a way through this wall. Use
intelligence then use the ability climb. You will now be in an area
where (3 squares south and 2 squares east) you over look a chasm.
Use the Golden Boots to jump the chasm. Entering through the doors
here, you will begin to explore a large room when you will suddenly
find yourself falling into the Depths of Nisir.

DEPTHS OF NISIR:

Accessable only from Salvation, this area represents the most
complex area to map. The map wraps east to west and north to south
and include teleportals and turning floors. Use GUIDANCE to
maintain your sense of direction and look at the automap often.
Because the map wraps, it is difficult to give precise directions on
where you need to go. From your beginning location you need to go
17 squares north and 14 squares east to reach an area that will
teleport you to an otherwise unaccessable area where Namtar is
hiding out with his army. Using SOFTEN STONE is your best means of
getting there. Exploration of the entire area results in lots of
encounters which can rapidly drain your supply of Dragon Eyes and
Dragon Stones. Use CLOAK ARCANE for added protection against those
encounters you cannot avoid. Once you have reached the teleportal
that will take you to Namtar, walk south. Before you enter the
larger area (you are in a one square wide hallway) use the DRAGON
GEM. The Queen Dragon will answer and rout Namtar's army (thank
heavens) and Namtar, well sort of. Namtar will spring back to life
and you will fight him over and over again before you finally can
pick up his ashes. Once you have you will be teleported to the
Magan Underworld near the energy restore pool the location of which
you should by now be most familiar. You will have time to restore
your energy before Namtar springs to life again. Kill him and head
as fast as you can to the cross shaped area surrounded by pits
(chasms) in the extreme south (see Magan Underworld notes) of the
Magan Underworld. Namtar will spring to life yet again. Defeat him
and use his ashes(body). THis will result in his being thrown into
the chasm that spawned him and his destruction! YOU'VE WON THE
GAME!
