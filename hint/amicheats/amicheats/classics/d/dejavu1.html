<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
This is the first all-graphic adventure game from ICOM Simulations.
You wake up with a bout of amnesia and quickly realize that you're
being framed for murder. You'll feel as if you're in a 1940s film as
you gather clues to clear your name.
</P>

<H2>SOLVE</H2>

<P>
Notes: During the game you make little use of the keyboard, except
to type in the addresses to let the Cab Driver know where you want
to go. You must then use the available commands displayed on the
screen. The exact use of these commands is not described in this
solution as their actions will be obvious, and full details are
provided in the documentation accompanying the software. Also,
examine each room carefully during the game, as well as the objects
scattered around them.
</P>

<P>
You begin your adventure in the Bathroom. It seems that you have
been drugged. You don't remember who you are. Take the overcoat
and examine the contents of the pockets. You will find some small
change, a lighter with the initials J.S., some cigarettes, a
handkerchief with the same initials, some sunglasses and a wallet
with a key, plastic card and a 20 dollar bill.
</P>

<P>
Take the .38 revolver armed with six bullets, and open the door.
</P>

<P>
Look at the mirror...where have you seen that face before?!!
Leave the room...you're in the Hallway.
</P>

<P>
Directly to your LEFT is the Ladies' Bathroom. Enter this room
(while preparing a good explanation should you ever get caught in
there!). In the bathroom and to your LEFT, you notice an expensive
pearl earring; take it if you feel so inclined, but it is not
essential to your quest.
</P>

<P>
Leave the room and in the Hallway, head for the Bar in front of you
and climb the stairs to the second floor.
</P>

<P>
If you examine the pictures on the wall, you'll see yourself in some
of them! Enter the office.
</P>

<P>
Open the drawer. Inside, you'll find a bill with an address - 934
West Sherman.
</P>

<P>
Take the bill if you wish and open the door to your Left with the
key from the wallet.
</P>

<P>
In the Office, you'll find a corpse; Search the body and take the
keys to the Mercedes you saw before, parked in the street.
</P>

<P>
Open the desk and take the pen and key marked "Front".
</P>

<P>
Leave the room by going out through the window behind the corpse and
to the fire escape. Head for the third floor.
</P>

<P>
Enter that strange room through the
window......Hmmmmmmmmmm.......not the most reassuring place in the
world!
</P>

<P>
Carefully examine the trash can. You'll find a syringe. Take it.
</P>

<P>
On the window ledge, you'll find three capsules; Examine those also.
It seems it was here that they tied you up and drugged you.
</P>

<P>
Take the elevator to visit the rest of the building.
</P>

<P>
Inside the elevator, press the third button from the top, and you
end up in the Casino.
</P>

<P>
Insert coins into the machine until you win a jackpot. You will
indeed require a lot of change for the cabs.
</P>

<P>
Take the elevator again and press the basement button. You now end
up in the sewers!
</P>

<P>
Before descending into the sewers, SAVE YOUR GAME because you don't
stand a chance of defending yourself against the alligator that
roams down there and which appears from time to time!
</P>

<P>
Head for the bottom of the sewer and examine the whirlpool that
seems to remind you of something. Now, head for the exit but before
leaving, SAVE YOUR GAME again because if you go out in the backyard
alley, you risk meeting the big bad guy!!!
</P>

<P>
Get to the Mercedes down the street and unlock the door with the key
that you found on the cadaver earlier. Enter the car and open the
glove compartment.
</P>

<P>
You will find a photo there (I hope it's not a picture of your
wife!!), a car registration form in the name of Joey Siegel (do the
initials J.S. ring a bell?!) and the address 1212 West End St.
</P>

<P>
If you feel so inclined, try starting the car (Ah! the old car bomb
trick! I hope you had saved your game!!).
</P>

<P>
Get out of the car and go to your RIGHT. You should meet the
prostitute whom you promptly punch! Open her purse and go through
its contents. You find another 20 dollar bill and a revolver which
could become useful if you have the intention of shooting non-stop
throughout the game. As for the 20 dollar bill, take it if you can
find a way to make change for it, otherwise it's useless.
</P>

<P>
And now, go to the LEFT to the newspaper stand, examine the headlnes
and the date. This must be 1941!! Buy the paper and the merchant
supplies a few important details. Go to the LEFT where you might
meet the mugger. If you do, strike him, but take note of this: You
can meet and strike the mugger only 4 TIMES during the whole
adventure, so try to avoid him as often as possible by SAVING YOUR
GAME regularly.
</P>

<P>
You now face the weapons dealer shop. You may also meet a beggar
who offers you some information for 20 dollars. As you won't need
the money for the rest of the adventure, you may give it to him, but
you could also ignore him. You could also enter the store and
purchase the "special of the day" if you feel like it!!
</P>

<P>
Always to your LEFT, you're now in front of a taxicab. Go to it and
ask the driver to get you to 1212 West End Street, the address you
found in the Mercedes. The ride costs you 75.......pay and get out
of the cab.
</P>

<P>
Enter the building. In front of you is a private entrance. Take
the plastic card from your wallet to use the elevator. At the top
floor, examine the penthouse and on the fireplace is a photo and
another address (520 S. Kedzie). Leave the building, enter the
waiting taxi and go to that address.
</P>

<P>
You will now be in front of a house, the door to which you are
unable to open. Shoot the lock off with your pistol and enter the
house.
</P>

<P>
On the table you find a paper on which is written the number
combination: 33-24-36 (a pretty good number for a safe, eh?!). You
also find another expensive pearl earring. Now, all that's left for
you to do is to find the woman who might fit between them!
</P>

<P>
Open the desk drawer, take the diary and the key.
</P>

<P>
It is now time to head for 934 West Sherman. Enter the building and
head up the stairs to the office of Dr.Brody. Open the door with
the key found at 520 S. Kedzie. In the office, shoot a bullet at
the filing cabinet lock and you'll find various files in it.
</P>

<P>
First, read the Siegel file to discover the Diethanol Thimene
antidote called Bisodumitis. Read the other files too, to gain more
interesting facts.
</P>

<P>
Examine the contents of the medicine cabinet and take the
Bisodumitis (click on the bottle) and place the product into the
syringe.
</P>

<P>
Inject yourself with the contents of the syringe. The drug goes to
work quickly and you begin to remember.
</P>

<P>
Take the Sodium Pentathol capsule from the cabinet; it will come in
handy in a few moments. Get out of the office and go to the second
floor in front of Dr. Ace Harding's office door.
</P>

<P>
Unlock the door with the same key as for the other Doctor's office.
Fire a bullet at the shadow behind the door and enter the office.
</P>

<P>
Open the file cabinet and read the contents of the files. Open the
desk drawers and your memory comes back gradually (it will come back
with more regularity from now on). You can always take bullets for
the .38 if you like. And now, you must search for a new
destination.
</P>

<P>
Examine the map found in the Mercedes. The following address is
indicated: 1060 South Peoria Street, which is actually Joe's Bar,
the place you initially started from!
</P>

<P>
Time for another little visit. Unfortunately, the taxi doesn't go
that far and you must walk part of the way. You risk encountering
the mugger, so be careful. Walk to the bar on the RIGHT hand side.
</P>

<P>
(Enter the bar through the sewer if you like, but it's much easier
to use the front door since you found the key to it earlier).
</P>

<P>
Once you get into the building, go to the second floor office and
open up the safe since you now have the combination. Inside the
safe are a small box and a file folder. Take the key from the box
and read the file. Leave the office and head down he street towards
the Mercedes.
</P>

<P>
Open the trunk with the key found in the safe. You find there a
lovely (Hum!!) looking woman, tied up and gagged. Remove the bind
with a mouse click. Inject her with a dose of Sodium Pentathol and
she blurts out the address: 626 Auburn Road. Take a cab and go
there.
</P>

<P>
In front of the house, open the mailbox and take the ransom note
found there. Head for the house and knock on the door with the
knocker. A butler answers but refuses to let you in! Punch him
down too!! He falls unconscious.
</P>

<P>
Climb to the first floor and in the first bedroom you discover a
woman sleeping. Open the drawer and grab the notepad. Rub the
pencil on the notepad and you can now read the message writen on it.
How about that for informative clues!
</P>

<P>
Go to the other room and there, a man is stacking Z's!! Take the
attache case, open the drawer and take the letter left there. You
can eat the chocolates if you wish and the same thing goes for the
bologna sausage down in the kitchen too!! Leave the building and
head for 1060 South Peoria.
</P>

<P>
You now have all the elements you need to go to the Police Station.
But first you must get rid of the gun.
</P>

<P>
(Notice that from now on, the mugger may appear at any moment, so
SAVE YOUR GAME as often as possible).
</P>

<P>
A good place to rid yourself of the weapon is in the whirlpool
inside the sewer. Go through the backyard alley to avoid meeting
the alligator. Throw the gun down there.
</P>

<P>
Now head for the Police Station and with the evidence you have - the
notepad, diary and letter - you have the solution to the enigma.
</P>

<P>
Right on! You've solved this adventure and as a bonus you now get
to print your reward!! See you in Deja Vu II!!!!!!!!!!
