<P>
Go to the surface or the orbital stores room, hold down 'Shift' and
press 'C'. The screen should turn green. Now press 'Shift' and 'C'
again, and the game will resume as normal. Now click on the master
control icon and go to the stock screen. You will appear to have
one of every item, when in fact you have an infinite supply of
everything. Orbital space stations can now be built with one frame
section.
