<H2>SOLVE</H2>

<H3>KILL DAVID CRANE</H3>

<P>
The first thing to do is pick up your credit card which can be found
in your wallet, lying on the left hand side of Eden's desk
(bedroom). Leave to the right and pick up the red cartridge lying
on a crate at the top of the room. Examine the microwave and you'll
find a key which you need (I forgot it and it left me in a right
state!!) Next, go through the door on the right, down the lift and
into her garage. Pick up the screwdriver lying on the car. Leave
her flat altogether.
</P>

<P>
Go to your own flat, keying in 5106 at your door. Get the knife
lying on your bed and while you're at it, pick up a cup. Take the
cup to your kitchen (south) and use the tap (sink) with the cup to
fill it with water. Go back to your bedroom. Examine the cartridge
of Eden's with your network screen (put the card into the interface,
click on screen etc.). You'll get the code for Sartain Industries
(7833 needed later on). Get the red cartridge lying to left of the
keyboard and examine this cartridge in a similar way. This time
log on with "RYAN", password "BLACKDRAGON". Read the file "PRIVATE"
which will give you your friend, Louis' address.
</P>

<P>
Leave your flat and head towards Louis' house. Walk into the lobby
and get mugged (would you normally go somewhere where you KNOW
you're going to be mugged?!?). Once the thief goes away, go back
into the lobby and head for the room to the south. This is Louis'
room. Punch in 5238 at the keypad and in you go. First of all,
walk to the unit on the left hand side (where the microwave is).
Examine it and you'll find Louis' pool hall entrance card. Examine
the card itself by clicking on it with your right mouse button,
while in the inventory screen. This will give you the address of
the pool hall. Go and have a chat with Louis who's sitting on the
shitter. He'll tell you where to get a gun from. Take both of his
trainers which are also in the toilet (nice friend you are!). Click
on both trainers in the inventory screen with the right mouse button
to wear both shoes.
</P>

<P>
Leave Louis' flat and head towards Sparky's bar (Wehey! I've even
got a bar named after me, cool, huh? I'm not the fat slob behind
the bar though folks!). Go and talk to the bloke sitting at the
bar. He'll tell you where Crane is. Then have a bit chat with
Sparky (friendly me, as always!) who'll give you a loan providing
you put your credit card through the scanner on the bar. Once
you've got the loan, leave the bar and head towards the pool hall.
</P>

<P>
Enter the pool hall and talk to the assistant behind the bars. If
you moan on properly he'll let you use Louis' card to get in to the
hall. So place your card in the card reader and go inside. Use the
lift and when you leave go and talk to the barman who'll give you
Mr. Silverman's door code (5222). Keep walking to the left until
you get to his door, punch in the code and enter the room. Talk to
Silverman and put your credit card through the reader. He'll the
give you a gun. Take the gun and leave the pool hall the way you
came in (unless you can find another way).
</P>

<P>
Outside, make your way to the Regency Hotel. Walk over to the tart
at the reception and book a room. She'll ask you for your
credit card, so stick it in the scanner and out will pop a brown
passcard. Pick it up and go to the door on the north wall. Press
the switch on the control box and go into the lift. Use the lift
control box with the passcard to take you up to your floor. Leave
the lift, walk to the left and then down towards the fire point at
the bottom of the screen. Open the fire point and get the axe.
Then go back to the lift. Once inside the lift, use your knife on
the control box to reveal a green wire. Again use your knife to cut
the wire. This will disable the lift. Now, in the top right hand
corner of the lift is a handle. Use it. You'll end up on top of
the lift. Walk to the lift doors (south) and use your axe to prise
the doors open. Now don't get too excited with your gun here when
you see the two guards, through your axe first. Then you can use
your gun to shoot the other guard. Hurry quickly to the left and
down in the next room which contains a rockery/pond. Wehey you
dirty git! Just shoot Crane on his bed, never mind the bimbo. This
will take you to The Keepers.
</P>

<P>
Have a little chat with The Keepers if you wish. Head down through
two rooms until you get to the bottom where the purple crystal is.
Pick it up. Go to the room on your right and use the first door on
your right. Once inside use the key (which you got from the
microwave!?!?) to destroy the plinth and return you to your world.
</P>

<H3>KILL STERLING</H3>

<P>
I like this bit. Go home first of all and use your network screen
to read the newsnet. Read the "TVSPECIAL" and you'll remember how
to get to the Channel 6 studios. Leave your flat and go there.
Walk all the way around the building until you come to a road which
has some brown numbered markings on it. Go left here and talk to
the old bloke behind the desk. After having a nice friendly chat,
kill him. Go to the control panel/desk and press some buttons.
This will allow you access into the building if you walk to the left
of the barrier.
</P>

<P>
Once inside, walk to the desk. Pick up the leaflet and drop it
immediately. This should reveal a green passcard on the desk. Take
the passcard and walk to the room on the left. Use the passcard to
get into the cleaning cupboard (bottom of this room). Walk over to
the right of the cleaning cupboard and you'll find a fusebox. Use
your screwdriver to open it and a brown fuse will fall out. Take
the fuse and leave for the room where you got the green passcard.
This time go to the room on the right. Go up the screen into the
next room and use the ladders in the corner of the room.
</P>

<P>
Now the fun starts. Walk to the control box for the crane and open
it. Inside is a blown fuse. Throw it away and replace it with the
new brown fuse you got from the cupboard. Now activate the controls
and squash the poor sod below.
</P>

<P>
This time when you visit The Keepers, go down two rooms and to the
left, taking the first door. Put your key in the plinth etc as
before.
</P>

<H3>KILL SARTAIN</H3>

<P>
On returning to the real world go back to Eden's flat. Her door
number is 2865 as you should know. Go upstairs, back into her
bedroom (let her get a bath in peace) and examine her personal
organiser. This is just beneath the rotating fan. Press the "N"
key (on the organiser) 5 times and you'll get the address of Sartain
Industries. Leave her flat and head towards Sartain Inds. Use the
code 7833 at the doorway and in you go. A really hard part here
just blow up the computer screen with your gun and walk to the
left. Walk through the opening and closing doors, go up the lift
and prepare for a nice welcoming comittee.
</P>

<P>
Leave the lift and you'll see a couple of guards. Use your crystal
here and watch their guts fly all over the place. Go to the room
south of here and open the case. Get the document inside. Read it
now if you want, or after you kill Sartain. I'd read it now and get
it over and done with. Next go to the room on your right, up both
flights of stairs and onto the roof. Go to the left on top of the
roof and shoot the plane/craft with your gun.
</P>

<P>
Once again you'll visit The Keepers. This time go south once and
take the door on your right..
</P>

<H3>KILL MISS CHAPEL</H3>

<P>
As you appear in the car park, go left past the Mini (don't skit I
used to have one!!). Grab the wire cutters from the back of the
truck and leave the carpark by walking upwards.
</P>

<P>
After reading that document you'll know where her house is. Go
there, walk towards the thick wall and climb over. Go south and..
oh dear, someone's done you a favour. She's already dead. Never
mind, pick up the blue cartridge while you're here and leave (climb
back over the wall and head to the left).
</P>

<H3>KILL UNDERWOOD</H3>

<P>
Go to the boathouse. At the entrance to the beach, grab the piece
of railing south of the entrance. Walk to the right, near the
water. In this screen you'll see a junction box under the sand
above you. Use the junction box and you'll wipe off the sand. Use
it again with the piece of railing to prise off the covering panel.
Now use it again with your cup of water, see things go bang and then
climb through the hole in the window, to the right. You'll see
what's left of Underwood (not much). Kill her and back to The
Keepers where you want to go south two rooms and then left, taking
the second door..
</P>

<H3>KILL BECKETT</H3>

<P>
This is where I had to cheat (twice so if anyone knows how to do
this bit properly, please let me know!). Go home and examine the
blue network card you found at Chapel's house. What's the problem?
Well, you'll have to log on as Beckett without properly knowing his
password. Okay, its "SEPTIMUS" but I didn't find that out by
actually playing the game or talking to anyone else!! Read the
"BRIEF" file and you'll find out where the old church is. Leave
your flat and go to the church. Use the wire cutters on the right
hand gate to gain access to the church. Proceed through the doors
and you'll see a skeleton. Get the hand lying next to it (to the
right of the skeleton). Keep going south until you arrive at the
altar.
</P>

<P>
Remove the rubbish on the altar (two candlesticks and a white
cloth). Just pick them up and drop them. On the top of the altar
is a hole. Place that hand inside that hole (ooer!!). You'll hear
a clunk. Now push the altar to reveal a bigger hole. Slide
yourself down the hole.
</P>

<P>
Now you'll find yourself in a tomb. There's a jar to the left.
Examine it and take the red ball. Place the red ball into the
centre floor tile with the three oblique holes. Now you can get the
other two by moving the top off the tomb. Place them both in the
remaining holes and be sure to collect the rock which is inside the
tomb. Go through the open door to the right, collect the two rocks
in this next room and walk upwards. You'll find a statue here which
requires some thought to use properly. Again, I'm sure you must get
the correct symbol from somewhere else but I don't know where so
here's what to do: There are two parts of the statue which rotate.
Each part contains six markings with matching markings on the other
part. Start by keeping the top part still. Press the purple button
and listen for a clunk. If you hear a clunk, you can stop this
procedure here. If you don't hear a clunk, rotate the bottom piece
by one and press the button again. Repeat this until the bottom
piece has turned six times (the original marking will reappear).
Now turn the top piece by one and repeat the process of rotating the
lower part and pressing the button. Get the idea keep doing it
until you hear that clunk.
</P>

<P>
What a pain, eh? Okay, now you've heard that clunk move down south
as far as you can go and then go into the room on your right which
will contain a bed. In the upper right hand corner of the room
hides a rock. Take it. Leave the room, and keep going left,
picking up any rocks you see on the way. Then go up, picking up
rocks if any. You'll see a room with a cart, go left here and get
the remaing rocks. You should collect 8 rocks in total; load them
all onto the cart and give it a push. It will move southwards and
create a hole in the southern wall, two screens below. Go through
the hole and then to your left.
</P>

<P>
Go south down the steps and you'll see the priest who's entered
Entropy. To the right hand side of this room is a hole. Go down
this hole and walk to your left, taking you onto a railway platform.
Go upwards here, and upwards on the next screen. You'll then see a
hole in the wall on the left hand side. Go through this hole and
there's Beckett who'll give you a boring lecture. Wait for him to
shut up. Once he's shut his mouth, just LEAVE the room as soon as
you can. Don't waste time or you'll have to listen to his crap all
over again. If you manage to make it out of the room he'll get ran
over by a train and that's it!
