<H2>PASSWORDS</H2>

<P>
The password for the computer is "DEATH".
</P>

<P>
On level 81 (I believe) the username and passcode for the computer
that unlocks the doorway are: Username: "Seth", Passcode:
"Ostrich"
</P>

<P>
The only other password you need for another computer on a higher
level in the game is "Pestilence".
</P>

<H2>CHEATS</H2>

<P>
When you are killed, waggle your joystick in a circle while
holding down the fire button. You will restart at that position
with 7-8 lives
</P>

<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
In each room there are yellow triangles on the walls, use these to
open doors. In many cases you will need to fire your laser in order
to richochet off the walls and connect with the triangle, opening a
door you would not otherwise be able to open safely.
</P>

<P>
Basically in every room you enter, blow up everything. Press 'U' to
use items in your inventory, bombs, stop time, barriers, or shields.
Bombs of course can be used with button 2 on the joystick.
</P>

<P>
Stop time stops time. Barriers blow up things for you (make sure
they don't backfire on you and kill you instead). Shields protect
you from everything for a short period of time (the exception to
this is the green cannons, your shield will disappear after being
hit once by a cannon, so get rid of those mothers right away).
</P>

<P>
By the way use 'ALT' + 'S' to save the game and 'ALT' + 'R' to
restore. Saved game always starts at level beginning. So for
example if you saved your game in the middle of level 82, when you
restored it you would be at the entrance to the level.
</P>

<P>
Use 'CTRL' + 'J' to turn on the joystick. 'S' for your status.
'CTRL' + 'R' to restart (sometimes).
</P>

<P>
In order to save people, first secure the room by blowing up
everything and walking over those squares so they turn green. Then
walk up to the person and hit 'Enter' a few times to see if the
person has anything to say. If not, just walk with the person
(being very careful to keep the person from walking over electric
shock pads) over to the red arrow in the room, and the person will
walk out. At the end of the game I had saved approximately 40
people, so you know you'll be doing fine if you average about 4
people each level. Some people you attempt to save will turn into
"fire guys". Blow them up with a bomb immediately. You can discern
real people from fire dudes by firing bombs against the wall. If a
person shakes, he is real. If a person stays stationary, he is fake
and will decapitate you.
</P>

<P>
In one room in the game you will not be able to open one of the
doors unless you blow up one of the yellow rods. It will then
unlock (USERID). When you see a computer walk up to it and you'll
get some information about Genoq. Mostly they're not of much use,
but 2 of the computers ask for passcodes and are very important.
</P>

<P>
In one room you will walk to the computer and suddenly be
transported to a weird area with a guy resembling the T-1000 coming
after you. When this happens, restore the game and when you get
back to that room, Do not touch the computer. You do not need to,
and you can only lock yourself in the room by doing so.
</P>

<P>
Level 90 is the weirdest level of the game. You will encounter
Derrida (the person you want to give the package to). Just talk
with him and then touch him. Then walk to the right out of the
weird screen. Then continue walking diagonally right-down, then
diagonally right-up to get out of the EYE screen. Then talk to the
second Derrida and walk to the top of the cross and exit. Continue
walking right out of the next room. When you see the glowing dude,
wait until he starts walking then get the hell out of there to the
left. Follow the red-arrow path downward and walk to the keyhole at
the bottom left of the screen. Touch the thing when glowdude is
about to walk in front of the radar dish, and he will get fried and
explode in blood. Then walk out and back to the room you first met
the glowing guy in. Touch the computer for the fun of it and then
touch the jetpack and fly away to victory.
</P>

<P>
The white open triangles are keyholes. You need to find the key on
each level for each keyhole. Sometimes there may be like 5
keyholes/keys on a level. Just get the key and touch the keyhole
and the door will open.
</P>

<P>
You can shoot into transporters. This is valuable when you have to
shoot a yellow triangle from a distance to make a door open. The
bomb will enter the transporter and come out the other transporter,
connecting with the triangle perfectly (if you aim that way).
