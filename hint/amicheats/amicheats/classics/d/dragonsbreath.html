<H2>TIPS</H2>

<H3>MONTH ONE</H3>

<P>
Cast the following spell on dragon:
</P>

<P>
2 * Rasgon-rind and heat<BR>
2 * Churl-normal and heat<BR>
3 * Arolig-normal, heat and ¹/4 condense<BR>
2 * Mionacal-grind and condense<BR>
7 * Haloros-cut and condense<BR>
7 * Igele-normal and heat<BR>
2 * Churl-normal and heat<BR>
1 * Acrus-mix and heat
</P>

<P>
Although this uses up a lot of ingredients, it makes your dragon
unbeatable in a duel and devastating when attacking villages - it
can kill over 1000 people in any one attack! The dragon will have
full speed, strength, wisdom, eyesight and health.
</P>

<P>
Place two eggs in incubation on full heat. Look in books at ongoing
battles, then record them on paper; now go to the map of Anrea.
Send your dragon to a town with a population of about 900 on a
conquer and keep mission (Hanmon / Olom are good). Do not buy
anything from the traders yet. End your turn.
</P>

<H3>MONTH TWO</H3>

<P>
Go to the map of Anrea, then return the dragon to the lair and
inspect conquered villages and towns. Cast the following spell on
town:
</P>

<P>
3 * Tius-normal and heat<BR>
4 * Churl-normal and heat<BR>
2 * Acrus-grind and condense<BR>
1 * Churf-normal and heat
</P>

<P>
This spell should make the village or town into a city with over
1000 inhabitants. If more churl is added it will become even
bigger, always remember to calm the mixture down if it becomes too
potent; chife is very useful. Raise the taxes to full and repeat
the spell if desired., perhaps twice. Check in the library to see
if your dragon is guarding a piece of the talisman. If he is note
the name of the town or city. End your turn.
</P>

<H3>MONTH THREE</H3>

<P>
Forget about the city, it should grow without your help, sprouting
towns all by itself. Meanwhile, send out your mega-dragon to beat
up other towns. For example if your city is at war with someone
else, go out and kill that village or town. If any town with a
population greater than 1000 is at war, send your dragon on a return
after task mission to conquer the enemies. The reward depends on
how badly the enemy has been hit. With this dragon, the whole town
is usually knocked out completely, with huge loss of life -
sometimes the whole population is wiped out!
</P>

<H3>THE FOLLOWING MONTHS</H3>

<P>
Once dragons have hatched, try to find a trader who can sell you the
right ingredients for a mega-dragon. Keep using spells on new towns
formed from the original, soon you could have as many as 30
tax-giving cities.It's possible to have an income of up to 1000
gelds per month. With this sort of income you're sailing. Watch
the health of your dragons, and, unless you know of any good spells
for eggs or humans, don't waste ingredients on them. Soon you
should have an invincible army of eight mega-dragons. If you attack
all the other townes, the other two players are in trouble.
</P>

<P>
Although the training missions are easy, they are usually a waste of
time. Just set zeal to medium and you can easily remove on average
village. If zeal is set to high super-dragons usually wipe out the
townes they are attacking, instead of just conquering them.
</P>

<P>
Never avoid other player's dragons a you can always beat the hell
out of them and sometimes kill them - but keep your eye out for
enemy dragons.
</P>

<P>
Soon you may be able to buy ingredients in enormous quantities; your
maximum is 99.
</P>

much as possible taking egg costs into account<BR>
