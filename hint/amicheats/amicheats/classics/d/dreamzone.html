<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Graphics adventure game set in the land of your dreams. A mad
scientist's elixir has turned your dream world into a reality. It's
up to you to call upon your logic, imagination, persistence, and
sense of humor to locate and overcome the source of your nightmares.
Over 100 exotic locales to explore while conversing with multitudes
of people, animals, and things. Type simple English commands or
click on objects to collect objects, seek clues or invite company
on your journey.
</P>

<H2>TIPS</H2>

<OL>
<LI>Using the pull-down Options menu, select visible objects. The
game doesn't hide them in any interesting way, so there is really no
challenge in playing without their icons.
<LI>If you wish to see your inventory icons, just press the Option
key and they'll appear in the icon bar. Otherwise type "I" for a
complete list in text.
<LI>You can type ahead several commands in order to skip the loading
of intermediate screens. For those times you have to go back to get
something -- and there are several -- it really speeds up play. For
example, quickly type the following command (leave out the quote
marks and press the <RETURN>): "S" <RETURN> "E" <RETURN> "W"
<RETURN> Though you'll see text descriptions of all locations, only
the final picture will load.
<LI>There are a couple of nasty bugs in this game, so save your game
often. This walkthru will help you avoid the bugs.

<H2>SOLVE</H2>

<H3>PART 1</H3>

<P>
Here you are in your slovenly Bedroom. You see a sandwich, so get
it and save it for later. Wander south to the Bathroom (another den
of iniquity), and get the plunger and toothbrush. Don't use either,
but resolve not to be such a slob in the future. Now go north,
east, north (don't make any noise in the hall, or you'll wake up the
authority figures), then north to your rotten Little Brother's Room.
Use the toothbrush, or you'll have to listen to rude comments about
your personal habits. TALK TO BROTHER. Then ASK BROTHER ABOUT
PRESENT and he'll tell you where it is. Hm. Wonder what it is?
He's got it hidden in the chest. GIVE MONEY TO BROTHER. What a
sucker! He runs off to buy candy. Now, quick! OPEN CHEST and GET
GUN. It's just a squirt gun, but it's still handy.
</P>

<P>
Return to Bedroom (south and west), and OPEN DRESSER. GET PAJAMAS
and USE them. So what's next? The bedroom is pretty drab in black
and white so go to SLEEP and...guess what, Dorothy? You're not in
Kansas anymore!
</P>

<P>
Here, we'll go on a tour of interesting deaths so that you can see
all the graphics in the game. SAVE GAME here if you want the guided
tour of something gruesome. Or are you not that kind of person? Go
south and see how the Bathroom has changed. It's sporting a toilet
with tonsils; if you stay there a second too long, you'll die a
horrible, repulsive death. Restore your saved game, and go north
back to the Bedroom.
</P>

<P>
Go east and you find yourself in a strange, cosmic territory where
you are drawn toward the Path By Your Door. Go east again to the
Path By A Gate, locked, of course. You LOOK AT KEYHOLE and find it
strangely familiar. This is a dream, isn't it? Nothing's too
ridiculous; therefore, it seems perfectly natural to USE TOOTHBRUSH.
Pop, you're through the Dream Zone and find yourself in a strange,
new land. Bemused, you go east to the Town Square where you see an
imposing building. If you get cold feet (after all, you DID forgot
your slippers) and try to go back west, you'll find a horrid demon:
the source of all your terrors! So, take a deep breath and resolve
to go forward to meet your fate. (If you did go west, return to the
Town Square by going east again.)
</P>

<P>
Let's look around a little. We'll go north to the Secular Church.
Hm, an odd concept! GET WAFER and just hang on to it. You never
liked them without grape juice, anyway. Now go south twice. Ah,
this is more like it: The Rigor Mortis Saloon. Feeling that you
should have paid more attention to Latin, you try to go south past
Bonzo the Bouncer, but he refuses to allow you to enter because you
lack the proper I.D. Go west, where you find a Crowd in the same
predicament. No help there.
</P>

<P>
Go east twice and you're in a sleazy Alley behind the bar. There is
an individual here of questionable integrity who might sell you some
fake I.D. The fact that he appears to be an actual Fox doesn't put
you off at all. Looks like you're beginning to get the hang of this
place. LOOK AT FOX and TALK TO FOX. So far, so good. Now, try to
BUY I.D. Some criminal! He won't do a thing for you without Form
69B-12C.
</P>

<P>
Head west, north, and east into that imposing building: the dear
old D.O.I. (Department of Information). In the Foyer, ASK CLERK
ABOUT FORM 69B-12C. He sends you on the first step of a
bureaucratic maze to Room N3L-D. Hang onto your temper and this
walkthru. This is the most laborious part of the game. Be sure to
save a couple of times, or you might have to repeat the process.
</P>

<P>
Go north. You find yourself standing before a confusing Lift with
weird controls. Go up twice, then north four times. Go west and
you should be in Room N3L-D. ASK OFFICER ABOUT FORM 69B-12C. He
refers you to Room N4R-E, where you should see Officer S3R-D.
</P>

<P>
Go east, then south four times to the Lift. Go up, north five
times, then east to Room N4R-E. ASK OFFICER ABOUT OFFICER S3R-D.
(See, you're getting quite good at doing exactly what you're told.
Mum would be so proud!) This turkey (or is he a pig?) refers you to
Room N2L-D.
</P>

<P>
Okay. Go west, south five times, down twice, north four times, then
west, and presto! You're in Room N2L-D. ASK OFFICER ABOUT OFFICER
S3R-D. "Oh," you're told, "he's in Room S3R-D." Grrrrrr. (By the
way, you can't find him by going there directly...I tried.)
</P>

<P>
Go east, south four times, down, then south twice. Now you're at
Lift S1. Go up twice, south four times, then west, and at last!
Room S3R-D. The officer has a strange paperweight, so GET ROCK.
ASK OFFICER ABOUT FORM 69B-12C. (If you weren't already dreaming, I
would say, "You'll see that number in your dreams.") Well, HE says
he'll need Form 43A-81G from Room E4L-C. This is a great game to
play at income tax time.
</P>

<P>
Go east, north four times, down twice, north, then east. Now you're
at Lift E1. Go up three times, east three times, then north. And
now you're in Room E4L-C, where you duly and whereas ASK OFFICER
ABOUT FORM 43A-81G. Grit your teeth because this one wants TWO
forms: 11X-16B from E3R-D and 51M-970 from E2L-B. Just be grateful
they're in the same tower.
</P>

<P>
Put on your hiking boots (figuratively) and go south, west three
times, down, east four times, then south. (Imagine if you had to
watch all those screens load! Did you read the playing tips at the
beginning of this walkthru?) Now you're in Room E3R-D, where you ASK
OFFICER FOR FORM 11X-16B. Argh! He wants form 17D-16B from S4R-E.
</P>

<P>
So, north, west four times, down, then east twice and north to Room
E2L-B. ASK OFFICER FOR FORM 51M-970. Guess what? He wants form
16D-970 from Room S2L-A.
</P>

<P>
Go south, west twice, down, west, and south to Lift S1. Then up,
south, and east to Room S2L-A. The indignity of it all! You ASK
OFFICER FOR FORM 16D-970. Well, what a pig! he responds that he
won't give it to you. "So shoot me," he says. You've gotten so
good at doing what you're told, so SHOOT OFFICER and GET FORM
16D-970.
</P>

<P>
Now go west, north, up twice, and south five times, then west to
Room S4R-E. ASK OFFICER FOR FORM 17D-16B. This guy is too hungry
to help, so GIVE SANDWICH TO OFFICER. You automatically get the
form added to your inventory.
</P>

<P>
We're picking up a real head of steam here, so go east, north five
times, down three times, north, east, up, east twice, then north to
Room E2L-B. GIVE FORM 16D-970 TO OFFICER, and GET FORM 51M-970.
Beautiful. What symmetry!
</P>

<P>
Still with me? South, west twice to the Lift, then up, east four
times, and south to Room E3R-D. GIVE FORM 17D-16B TO OFFICER and
get form 11X-16B.
</P>

<P>
Go north, then west four times. (Let's get this over with.) Now
you're in the Lift. Go up, east three times, then north to Room
E4L-C. GIVE FORM 11X-16B to the nice OFFICER. Do the same with
FORM 51M-970. At long last, you have Form 43A-81G.
</P>

<P>
This is the final leg of the journey! Go south, west four times,
down three times, west, south, up twice, south four times, and west
to...ta-dah! Room S3R-D. GIVE FORM 43A-81G to that stupid pig
(OFFICER), and prepare to be indignant, feel your serotonin levels
rise, fall, or explode because he flat out refuses to give you Form
69B-12C because he has run out of receipts. It's right there on his
desk in plain view (though you can't see the icon). Go ahead! Do
it! STEAL FORM 69B-12C. The officer is terrified. He asks if
you're going to shoot. Go ahead and do it. As he expires, he tells
you to collect the official form for killing an officer. Follow
those instructions, too. Go east, north four times, up, south
twice, and east. In Room S4L-B, ASK OFFICER FOR FORM 22Z-13I, which
he actually gives you. West, north twice, down twice, south, and
west. GIVE FORM 22Z-13I TO OFFICER in Room S2R-A and get your
receipt. DROP it when you get out of the building.)
</P>

<P>
Return to the Foyer (east, north, down, and north), then EXIT
(tricky, tricky). Let's go get that drink!
</P>

<H3>PART 2</H3>

<P>
The Bar is sounding better and better, so go south and east to the
Alley, where you GIVE FORM 69B-12C TO FOX, and he gives you a
Missouri driver's license issued in your name. Go west, then SHOW
ID to BONZO, who will recognize you from now on, so you can DROP ID
and go south. Here you are in the Bar. You've seen better and
you've seen worse. Somebody left a leather jacket behind. Though
it doesn't go with your outfit, GET JACKET. When you feel Nature's
call, try to go west. The waitress informs you the keys to the John
are lost and that you will need form 43E-61Q. (Don't panic: we're
not about to go through all that again!)
</P>

<P>
Feeling more desperate, you go north, then up On the House, where
you see what you would expect to see in this seamy world: a Rat --
the first of several. This one's name is Nick -- a thief and a
fence. BUY KEYS FROM NICK. Great! Go down and south. Then TALK
TO TWINS. They offer you some gum, so ASK TWINS FOR GUM. But don't
use it. Your inventory is now a little full, so DROP TOOTHBRUSH,
PLUNGER, and RECEIPT (if you've still got it). If you want to look
at the "signature" in the game, go south and view the J.A.M Software
Wall. Good. Now go back north.
</P>

<P>
USE KEYS, and go west to the Bar John. Perched in the grimy sink is
another Rat with sharp teeth, named, oddly enough, John. (Note the
teeth -- they'll be important later.) Up against a dead end in the
game? Yeah, well, just EXIT. Surprise, you're now in a clown's
Dressing Room and have a very interesting view. (Ahem.) Check out
the legs, then go south to the Bigtop. The Freak Show sounds
enticing, so BUY TICKET (wonderful how your money is holding out,
isn't it?) and go east.
</P>

<P>
These are truly a couple of Freaks: a hairy, fat woman, and Grajunk
the Grajoinck, sort of an amphibian in sneakers. TALK TO GRAJUNK
and discover his ailment. GIVE GUM TO GRAJUNK. It makes him feel
so good that he hops into the icon line. It's great to have
company, isn't it? If you TALK TO HAIRY MOMMA, you'll find out her
speciality, but you can't do anything about it yet.
</P>

<P>
Go east and...wow! What a woman! The dude she's with is a little
strange. Everyone wants to give you this woman. She's willing, but
what would Mum say? You're tempted, but the image of the two of you
together doesn't go very well with your last year of High School.
So go west twice then south. TALK TO KIDS, and listen to them whine
and argue. Remind you of anyone? ASK ABOUT TOKENS. At this point,
you can also go east if you want to look at the closed Ferris Wheel.
You'll never see more of it. Go west then south, where the stupid
kids are now chasing each other in reverse. Go west to the Games!
TALK TO LADY, PLAY GAMES, STEAL TOKENS, and STEAL TEDDY. You're
really losing it, aren't you? Oh, well, it's only a dream.
</P>

<P>
The games get boring, so go east then south to the Air Terminal.
Ah, a way out of here! However, when you try to BUY TICKET, you
learn a ticket costs $100,000! Where could you get that kind of
money? Onward. Go north to the kids and GIVE TOKENS TO KIDS. In
return, they give you their sticky candy. Such a deal. But wait,
go north to the Bigtop, then east to the freak show, and GIVE CANDY
TO HAIRY MOMMA. She gives you the tonic. (You'll need it later,
but if you like, save your game and use it, then restore. It's
strange.) Okay, west, and north three times to the Bathroom, then
east to the Bar where the Bartender is desperate for hors d'oeuvres.
GIVE WAFER TO BARTENDER. In gratitude, he gives you a keg.
</P>

<P>
Go north then west to that silent Crowd. The pesky bunch won't let
you through. Take pity on the poor schlubs. Maybe they've been in
the D.O.I. too long. You speculate on the dangers of too much
information. SAY 'FREE BEER' (Note: be sure to use single quotes
instead of double, or the game will not recognize the answer). They
stampede to the Bar Door, dragging you with them.
</P>

<H3>PART 3</H3>

<P>
You go east in a daze and find that the fox is gone, and his place
has been taken by a nasty Loan Shark. Remembering that ticket, BUY
LOAN. You get a large tuna worth 100,000 big ones and a warning
about paying it back. Now go west twice, and you'll see something
new. It's a Bridge to the Orient. (Remember when you were little
and what you thought would happen if you dug a hole deep enough?)
</P>

<P>
Go west to the Palace Lawn and north to a Sword Smith. ASK SMITH
ABOUT SWORD, and whoa! It costs $100,000, too! The Smith is
willing to barter, though, so ASK SMITH ABOUT TRADE, and he'll tell
you about his lovely daughter imprisoned by the senile, old Emperor.
The girl for the sword, very B-movie. Okay. GIVE JACKET TO SMITH,
and he'll return the favour by giving you some rice.
</P>

<P>
Go south, west to the Colonnade, and try west again. The guards
won't let you in. It seems you have to defend the honour of the
house first. Puzzle this one out by going north twice to the
Emperor's Rock Garden. Go west twice and contemplate the beauties
of nature -- in short, DIG GARDEN. You'll find a beautiful vase in
a nest of worms. Leave them for now. Go west twice and south.
Whoops! It's an enemy Ninja, and he's buggy. So SAVE GAME (very
important). Now SHOOT THIEF and die. No problem. Restore your
game (you did save it, right?)
</P>

<P>
Note: When you get the window that tells you that restoring the
game will result in the loss of the current game, be sure to click
OK with the mouse. (If you press return, you will be unable to
solve this one.) SHOOT THIEF again. Remember what happened to the
Wicked Witch when Dorothy threw water on her? Right!
</P>

<P>
Full of honour and somewhat damp, go south three times to Sushi, the
rat brother, who's thin and sad. GIVE RICE TO SUSHI (after all,
what is Sushi without rice?), and he tells you that any rat brother
of his is a friend of yours. You'll get a nice favour later. Go
north four times, east twice. GET VASE and GET WORMS, then east
twice, and south twice. At last you can go west to the Throne Room,
where the wizened Imperial Lordship Istostuborntoletupass XXVII (try
saying THAT backwards!) and the Grand Vizier await you. The Emperor
won't talk to you until you BOW TO EMPEROR.
</P>

<P>
Now you are allowed to TALK TO EMPEROR. He starts moaning about his
pet rock. GIVE ROCK TO EMPEROR, and he gives you the freedom of the
house. Go south, west, and north. The servants keep moving the
walls around, but two can play at that game. MOVE WALLS until you
come to a Servant gloating over his private collection of Ming
vases. ASK SERVANT ABOUT VASES, and he'll tell you where they used
to be made. Remind you of anything? GIVE VASE TO SERVANT, and
he'll tell you that the Princess's door is now open to you. It's
all in knowing whose palms to grease.
</P>

<P>
Go south to the Rock Garden, then east three times, north twice,
west, south, north twice, then east to the Imperial Bed. (If by
some chance this doesn't work, it means you forgot to get the loan
from the Loan Shark.) Here she is, the girl of your dreams.
Literally. GIVE TEDDY TO PRINCESS and she joins you. A cheap date.
Also, GET ROCK. There are a lot of them around. Go north to avoid
the Emperor, then south and east to Daddy. He'll give you a sword
and take the girl. Too bad.
</P>

<H3>PART 4</H3>

<P>
Go back to the Bar and west into the John. Then EXIT and go south
to the Air Terminal, where you use the loan to buy the air ticket.
You can finally go south to the Airship, where the Captain joins
your party. He hints at a destination besides the usual one of
Paradisia. Remembering the view from the roof, you ASK CAPTAIN
ABOUT CASTLE. To get there you'll need the Pearl of Heavenly
Divination. Sounds Oriental, doesn't it? Maybe you missed
something.
</P>

<P>
Go north many times to the John, east, north, and west twice, then
south. You're at a Dock With Enticing Water where fishing is
allowed but swimming is restricted to couples. Try to SWIM anyway.
No dice. Use your favourite swear word. Oh, go ahead and type it.
Surprise! You got sent to the Romper Room, where all bad kids get
sent. There are a lot of clues on the wall. (Before getting rid of
the crowd, you can get out with SAY 'I'M SORRY'.) One of the clues
concerns marriage. USE SOAP and you're back looking at the crowd
again. This time LOOK AT GIRL. She's the kind Mum likes and she's
willing, so GET ENGAGED TO GIRL. Then go north, up, south, EXIT,
and north twice.
</P>

<P>
You're standing in front of a strangely familiar preacher. You
really have no other ideas, so MARRY GIRL, and if it does anything
for you, KISS BRIDE. Now back to the Dock (south three times, west
twice, and south). It was a lot of trouble, but now you can SWIM
and go Underwater. Here you see the entrance to a Cave. ENTER and
meet Jacque the Water Rat, and his oyster collection. What can you
find in oysters? Yeah. Jacque wants to make a submarine, so GIVE
KEG TO JACQUE and he gives you a pearl...uh, globe. EXAMINE PEARL
-- it's quite beautiful and useful.
</P>

<P>
Now EXIT, and go up. While you're there, USE WORM, and catch a big
$100,000 tuna. It appears to be the only kind they have here.
</P>

<H3>PART 5</H3>

<P>
Go north, east twice, south, west, and EXIT. Go south to Airship,
and GIVE PEARL TO CAPTAIN. SAY 'READY.' Whoops, you can't go yet.
It seems debtors can't leave. And there is also a knotty rope tying
you down (I'm telling you now, so you don't have to go back twice).
Go north six times, and ASK JOHN ABOUT TASK. He joins you. Go
east, north, east, and GIVE TUNA TO SHARK. (Don't get another
loan.)
</P>

<P>
Okay, back to the Airship. (Go west, south, west, EXIT, and south
six times). John gnaws the rope and runs away. Coward. SAY
'READY.' (If you had married the wrong "beloved," she would've
refused to go, and you'd be stuck because divorce is not possible in
the Dream Zone.)
</P>

<P>
You take off to Airship North View. (It's a good idea to save
here.) Go north and you're at the Castle Door with a pit yawning
attractively in front of you. (Note: For an interesting death, and
to see your pajamas, go north again.)
</P>

<P>
If you DON'T want to die, JUMP west, and you come face-to-face with
a most unappetizing drunk. TALK TO DRUNK, and get a sickening offer
but a good clue. This is just a dream, right? SHOOT DRUNK and GET
WINE, but for Heaven's sake, don't drink the stuff! Now JUMP east
and JUMP south back to the Castle Door. Wheeee!
</P>

<P>
Here's something strange, JUMPU. No, it's not a typo, just the only
way I could get the game to do it. You will be up in the Tower
looking at Rambone the Rat. The characters are certainly getting
uglier. He's a hairless Rat with a tattoo, a grudge, and a mean
disposition. TALK TO RAMBONE and learn his sad tale. Take pity on
him (since you can't shoot him without dying) and GIVE TONIC TO
RAMBONE. Grajunk (remember him?) is so happy that he jumps up and
knocks a hole in the ceiling. Go up and you're in the Key Tower
staring at a beautiful, heavy gold key. You want it, but you're
afraid of booby traps. So TRADE ROCK WITH KEY. Your wife does this
manoeuvre for you, and now you have a key.
</P>

<P>
Go down twice, then south. SAY 'READY' and take off. Go north six
times, then east and GET PLUNGER, then north two times. You're
getting pretty tired. Go west and face that Demon. What could be
worse after what you've been through? THROW WINE AT DEMON, and it
reduces him to goo. It's harmful goo, though, so be careful!
</P>

<P>
Quick! USE KEY. That rotten Grajunk grabs it and swallows it with
a porcelain burp. Now what does that remind you of? Good! USE
PLUNGER ON GRAJUNK. He coughs it up. Repulsive. USE KEY. And,
presto! You're back in your room but feeling kind of guilty about
your brother's present. (It seems your wife is gone. Oh, well, it
would have been hard to explain her at the breakfast table.) Go east
and north, and GIVE GUN TO BROTHER.
</P>

<P>
Now CLICK as suggested and see something interesting. CLICK again
if you want to play from the beginning.
