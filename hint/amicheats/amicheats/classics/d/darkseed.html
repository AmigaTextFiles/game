<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Sci-fi role playing game based upon artwork by H.  R.  Giger,
Academy Award winning artist for the movie Alien.  You are Mike
Dawson, a science-fiction writer who has just purchased an old
Victorian house.  You soon discover that you have bought more then
you imagined.  Control the fate of two worlds - the world we know
and the dark world of an ancient, dying civilization.  Unlock the
secret of a sinister plot and discover the dark passage to their
world, a place more terrifying than your darkest nightmare.

<H3>DAY ONE</H3>

<P>				 
What you will need and where to find it:
</P>

<P>
ITEM	----------- LOCATION
</P>

<P>
Aspirin -------- Cabinet in the bathroom<BR>
Library Card --- In the pocket of the raincoat<BR>
House Plan ----- On the desk in the study<BR>
Rope ----------- On the floor in the secret room no. 2<BR>
Watch ---------- Under the bigger trunk in the attic<BR>
Crowbar -------- In the boot of the car in the garage<BR>
Gloves --------- In the car's glovebox<BR>
Diary ---------- Large trunk in the attic<BR>
Bobby Pin ------ Floor of the library in front of the desk<BR>
Scotch --------- Buy from the store<BR>
Clock Case Key - Tuttle Tomb. Urn Room
</P>

<P>
The first thing to do when you get up on day one is to rid Dawson of
his headache.  If you don't he won't be able to think straight and
playing the game becomes impossible!  This is done by taking the
aspirin in the bathroom cabinet and, while you're there, taking a
shower (no-one likes a smelly newcomer).
</P>

<P>
Next, you want to wander into the spare bedroom to the right.  Use
the "!" cursor a few times to discover and examine the library
ticket in the pocket of the raincoat.  You may have to try more than
once but it is there, honest!
</P>

<P>
From here head on downstairs to the study.  Read the plans to
discover the secret rooms.  This having been done, you can now open
the bookcase on the right and enter secret room one.  Once you have
gone through it is important to open the door again and leave it
that way, otherwise you cannot use the turbo-lift in the Dark World.
</P>

<P>
Climb the ladder and take the rope before exiting to your bedroom.
Whatever you do, don't forget to leave the door open.  Go downstairs
again and wait for the postman to call (if you press 'T' the time
will pass quicker).  Open the door to the postie and recieve the
slightly unusual parcel before heading on up to the attic.
</P>

<P>
Shoving the large trunk on the right forward reveal the exit to the
balcony and the watch.  Pick up the watch and wind it by clicking on
it.  You can now find out the time, which is vital.  Dont forget to
wind the watch at odd intervals, or it runs down and you're left up
a deeply unattractive creek without a paddle.  Go out onto the
balcony, tie the rope to the gargoyle and you have a convenient rear
access.  Despite what you may have read elsewhere, do not use this
exit on day one as it tends to upset things.  Always enter and exit
the house through the front door for now.  So using the
aforementioned exit, take a trip down to the garage and take the
crowbar out of the boot.
</P>

<P>
Next you should obtain the gloves from the glovebox in the car, and
while you're there amuse yourself by sounding the horn and turning
on the radio - and don't forget to turn the thing off when you're
done!
</P>

<P>
Go back into the house, not forgetting to read the newspaper on the
pavement, and walk back upstairs.  The phone will ring so go into
your bedroom and answer it - don't take too long or you'll miss it.
It is the librarian telling you to come and collect a book.
</P>

<P>
In the meantime climb up to the attic and use the crowbar to get the
diary out of the big trunk.  Give it a good read.  Now go outside
and head towards the town.
</P>

<P>
Enter the library and find the bobby pin in front of the desk.  Next
talk to the librarian, she'll direct you to your book which you
should take and read.  Go back to her again and give her the library
card.  She'll tell you where to find the book it should go with,
inside which is the missing piece of the diary - definetly essential
reading.
</P>

<P>
On your way back, take time to go to the store.  You need to buy the
scotch, so first pay the store keeper and then take the demon drink.
Your alcoholic neighbour will now make an appearance and give you a
"Get Out Of Jail Free" card, which will come in very handy tomorrow.
</P>

<P>
Go past the house and take a trip to the graveyard and, beyond what,
the Tuttle Crypt.  Enter the crypt by following the instructions in
the diary exerpt and head on to the urn room.
</P>

<P>
You will find the key to the clock case in the urn on the far left
of the bottom shelf.  Take this and head back home.
</P>

<P>
Once home, use the key to open the clock case in the living room and
admire the John McKeegan nameplate.  Take the time to examine the
mirror and the Painting over the matle piece.  Put Dawson to bed
now, he needs his sleep and tomorrow is going to be a long day.
</P>

<H3>DAY TWO</H3>

<P>				 
What you will need and where to find it:
</P>

<P>
ITEM ------------ LOCATION
</P>

<P>
Mirror Fragment - Postman delivers it<BR>
Shovel ---------- Catacombs entrance<BR>
Diary Fragment -- John McKeegan's grave<BR>
Gun ------------- Police station<BR>
Stick ----------- Delbert's back yard<BR>
Headband -------- From Sargo in the dark prison corridor<BR>
Microfiche ------ From the Keeper Of The Scrolls
</P>

<P>
Following the bizarre and, it should be said, macabre dream, you
wake up as before and should shower and take your aspirin as before.
Before the postie arrives go and have a listen to the car radio -
you'll help Dawson discover that what goes on in one world is
reflected in the other, although we already knew that didn't we?
</P>

<P>
Go back into the house throught the front door - from now on it's
not only o.k to use the rope but often essential - and press 'T' a
couple of times before the postie arrives.  Take the mirror fragment
that he brings and use it on the mirror in the living room.  This
completes the portal to the Dark World, so take the opportunity to
cross over and see what gives.
</P>

<P>
Take the right hand door in the nursery to the room of skulls and
then take the room on your left.  This room contains the plans for
the embryo implantatin which confirms Dawson's worst fears.  The
plans can't be picked up so just use the "!" cursor to read them.
Take the right hand door into turbolift one room and step into the
lift on the far wall.  This will teleport you to the second
turbo-lift room, from which you should exit left onto the
observation deck.
</P>

<P>
Use the gloves (to avoid electrocution) to activate the switch
between the two exits.  This will unveil a previously hidden door in
the skull room, so go back there and go through the new door.  Keep
going left and you will find a shovel, of all things, which you
should pick up and save for use later on.
</P>

<P>
Leave the Dark World and take a jaunt to the graves and exhume the
body of John McKeegan with the shovel.  Read the last bit of his
diary, which advises you that you need to get the car started and
break the mirror, and suggests how this could be done.
</P>

<P>
When you get home you'll find yourself under arrest for blatant
grave robbery.  The "Get Out Of Jail Free" card will see you out
before long, but first you should stow the bobby pin, the gloves and
the money under the pillow - they'll come in mighty useful in a
while.  Get out by rattling the tin cup against the bars and giving
the card to the policeman.
</P>

<P>
You will just have enough time to steal the gun which is located
just over the desk on the wall.  Go and meet Delbert as arranged.
He'll meet you in your back yard rather than his, but follow him
next door.  He will studiously ignore you until you give him the
scotch.  He'll leave you, but take the stick that the dog leaves
behind.
</P>

<P>
Return to the Dark World and take the right hand door into the
skulls room and go through that door the lever opened.  Keep on
going right until you encounter Dark Fido, the dog - type guardian
thingy that guards the bridge over the abyss.  To get past him
simply throw the stick over the side and watch the stupid thing
chase after it!
</P>

<P>
You are now free to continue right to the Dark Police station.
Although you find your gun confiscated and yourself incarcerated,
this is exactly what you need to happen.  Test the synchronicity
theory by retrieving from under the pillow the items you stashed
there earlier.  The bobby pin now comes in very handy as a means of
picking the lock, but you may need a few attempts before you are
successful.  Once out you will meet a fellow prisoner by the name of
Sargo who, having seen what you've just done, offers you an
invisibility inducing headband in exchange for the bobby pin.  Seems
a fair swap, but don't use the headband now, it only works once and
for a limited period, so deploy it only when you need to - which is
soon.
</P>

<P>
Walk out of the passage and past the Drakketh Factory (which, like
the barber shop, you can't go in).  Now you will find yourself at
the front of the Archives building, and now is the time to use that
headband.  So, invisibility assured, you can walk past the guard and
into the chamber of the Keeper Of The Scrolls.  Turn the machine on
and you will see an image of the Keeper.  She will then give you a
roll of microfiche which will come in useful tomorrow, but for now
leg it home and get some shut-eye!
</P>

<H3>DAY THREE</H3>

<P>
What you will need and where to find it:
</P>

<P>
ITEM ------- LOCATION
</P>

<P>
Axe Handle - Delivered by postman<BR>
Scotch ----- Store<BR>
Car Keys --- Under Stone In Cellar<BR>
Stone ------ Cellar
</P>

<P>
Take your aspirin and shower as normal.  Go downstairs and hang
around for the postman to arrive.  He'll bring you a package from
the Keeper Of The Scrolls which contains the axe handle.  Useful
item this, but not straight away so save it for later.
</P>

<P>
Now take a trip down town, using the rope from the attic.  Always
use this as your entrance and exit from the house as police have
staked out the front, but are blind to the comings and goings from
the rear.  Go into the periodicals room in the library and turn on
the microfiche reader.  Pop in the roll of film and read the bit
about home improvements.  Dawson has now learned that the keys to
the car are in the hiding place in the cellar.
</P>

<P>
So hurry back home and pick up another bottle of scotch on the way.
Get inside the house using the rope and head down into the cellar.
In the middle of the floor there is a loose stone.  Pick it up and
pick up also the keys which are stowed underneath.
</P>

<P>
Now cross to the Dark World once again and take the stone to the
power nexus.  Use the machine on the left to ener gize the stone,
which should then be put together with the axe handle to make a
hammer.
</P>

<P>
Hurry back to the Normal World and go into the garage.  Fill the
petrol tank with scotch (what a waste!) get into the car and, using
the keys, turn on the ignition.  Leave the engine running as you
cross once more into the Dark World.  Enter the spaceship (the small
opening on the left outside the front of the hatchery) and use the
gloves on the lever to the left of the computer console.  This has
started the craft's launch sequence so get the hell out.  Once the
craft takes off you will find yourself back in front of the mirror
in the Normal world.  Smash the mirror with the hammer and the world
is saved and the game is won!  Enjoy the end-sequence.
