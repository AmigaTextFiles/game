<P>
First of all, collect the leaf and the match. Push the leaf under
the door and use the match on it. Collect the bucket of water and
use this on the blazing door. Once the fire has been extinguished,
go left until you reach the green Troll. Collect the pickaxe and go
right to chat with the Prince. He will give you a flying carpet,
but do not pick it up - it's a red herring. Keep on walking right
and collect the cage. In the next room stand right at the edge of
the cliff, jump right to land on the cloud and collect the piece of
paper that you'll find there. Fall off the cloud and use the
pickaxe on the boulder to reveal a secret cave.
</P>

<P>
After you've entered the cave, collect everything then stand on the
highest platform. Jump up-right and you should land in a small
passage where you should collect the golden nugget. Go to the river
and jump onto the boat. When it arrives at the opposite side of the
river, jump off the boat and walk towards the ferry man who will
take the golden nugget from you and let you pass. Talk to him and
he will ask you to speed up his boat. Look behind the stereo to
find a cherry.
</P>

<P>
On the next screen, drop the cage next to the Fluffle (he won't go
into it though). Climb up the platform to the above screen where
there is a large gap. Use the bridge building kit on it to form a
wooden bridge. Walk into the next room (which is called the 'Narrow
Ledge') then jump onto the clouds and onto the tower. When you are
in the tower, collect the Harp and come back out onto the 'Enchanted
TreeTops'. Look behind the tree house door to reveal a cherry and
go up onto the next screen where you should jump left off the far
left platform.
</P>

<P>
Carry on jumping across the clouds and into the next screen, called
'Heaven'. Give the harp to Saint Peter and he will reward you with
some Holy Cheese. Take the cheese all the way back to the Fluffle,
place the cheese in the cage and the Fluffle should enter the cage.
If you drop the cage in front of the Troll (guarding the castle
entrance), it'll become scared and scarper. Now you can enter the
castle...
</P>

<P>
Once inside the castle, go up the first lift and collect the motor.
Move onto the next screen and use the lift to travel upwards. When
the lift stops, go to the far right, collect the rusty key then
return to the lift and ascend once again. Collect the two cherries
on the next floor and then return to the bottom floor again. Walk
to the left and collect the bread. Once you have the loaf, take a
trip back to the ferry man, give him the motor and he will give you
a scythe.
</P>

<P>
Go right and climb over the trees towards the 'Narrow Ledge'. Jump
along the clouds, onto the tower and use the scythe on the ivy.
Travel right, up the lift and collect the horn. Go left up, the
other lift, walk right and use the lift there. If you jump left off
this lift at the very top you should reach a deserted tower. Use
the rusty key on the door and you will find Daisy inside but you
won't be able to wake her because you are not a prince. Go back
down and jump onto the upper platform.
</P>

<P>
From the lift, carry on left until you find a pair of tweezers.
Once the tweezers are collected you can jump up to land on a secret
cloud where you will find a cherry. Now it's time to go back to the
lion.
</P>

<P>
When you reach the lion, give him the tweezers and he will repay you
with a thorn. Go and see the Prince, give him the horn and he will
give you a joke book. Go right towards the tower and onto the
screen where the evil Dizzy is. Drop the thorn on the floor, go up
to the upper level and make the evil Dizzy walk onto the thorn. Go
back down and you should now be able to pick up the spanner. Take
the spanner back to the castle and use it on the lever to lower the
drawbridge. Cross the drawbridge, give the joke book to the upset
Princess and she will reward you with a flag. Take this flag up to
the top of the castle and place it on top of the flagpole. The
Prince should now appear and call the King. Talk to the King and he
will make you a Prince. Go back to Daisy, give her a big snog and
if you have collected twenty cherries, you've completed the game!
