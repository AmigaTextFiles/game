<P>
Escape further into the depths of the Dragon's Lair! Just when you
finally rescued Daphne from Singe the Dragon, along comes his
master, the Evil One, and steals her away again. Match wits with the
new challenges that confront you as well as totally new encounters
never before seen in the original Dragon's Lair. Muster all your
skill and cunning to free Daphne once again in the brilliant final
battle deep within the cavernous dungeons beneath the Castle. Escape
from Singe's Castle installs on any hard drive, runs multitasking
and even links with the original Dragon's Lair to allow you the
ultimate playing experience.

<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
You can play easy mode and still see all the screens. Select the
hardest possible setting before starting the game, including
disabling flip screen and choosing only 3 lives. Now click on the
game icon and do as if you were to start the game. When you are
prompted to click to play, just choose exit. Now select easy mode
and more lives and away you go.
