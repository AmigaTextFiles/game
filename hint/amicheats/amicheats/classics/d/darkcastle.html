<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Conquer numerous perils and defeat the Black Knight in the Castle of
Doom. Search the castle's halls; but watch out for the bats, rats,
vultures, mutants, magic brooms, and whip and rock wielding
henchmen. Fourteen levels of increasing difficultly. Animated colour
graphics and digitized sound effects.
</P>

<H2>CHEATS</H2>

<P>
The first thing you do is go to the shield room. Once there press
'W' (up) and 'S' (down). Keep them both pressed. This will cause
your hero to go up and down between the two screens. After half an
hour or so you will have about 25 lives, this is the only screen
you can do it on.
