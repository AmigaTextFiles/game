<H2>TIPS</H2>

<H3>CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT</H3>

<H4>FIGHTING</H4>

<P>
Fighter and ladin will gain levels much faster initially in the game
as the priest and magician will not be very powerful at low level.
Fighter and ladin can wear the heaviest armor and wield the most
powerful sword. At highest level, they can do 200-300 demage points
depending on the weapons used. Paladins can lay their hand on enemy
to demage them or heal your party.
</P>

<H4>PRAYERS</H4>

<P>
Priest should try to invoke prayers as soon as possible. The priest
will need to go to temple if he thinks he is qualified for a better
ring. Gaining levels will usually rewards the priest with one or two
rings. However, if the priest will have a better chance of getting a
higher ring if he is able to invoke the prayers of the gods
successfully.
</P>

<P>
The prayers to Ufthu are useful during combat. RALKOR will send an
arrow to strike the strongest opponent. KARNH will heavily injure
monsters adjacent to the priest. DROM will give strength to yourrty
so that they cause more demage. IDRIS is very demaging to all undead
creatures present. THOL will make your opponents less effective in
combat.
</P>

<P>
Prayers to Drutho are useful in dungeon exploring. UMESH will
attempts to translate the script on the wall. HOYAMOQ will try to
force the secret door open, usually a few prayer is required before
the door is opened. TAPU will reduce demage done to the rty in
dangerous area. BYNDU is the prayer with no arent purpose. MORPETH
will help to reduce encounters when exploring. BELAMOQ is the most
powerful door opening prayer, no secret door could withstand its
power if successfully invoked. However, it is usually not answered
and cost a great amount of virtue points.
</P>

<P>
Prayers to Gothur are for healing purposes. SIRDHE is the basic
healing prayer, it will heal a certain amount of wounds from each
character. HOLNAK will increase your fighting power. ELIS will heal
completely the character with the lowest hit points. TELIS will heal
therty completely, but it is only answered at an altar. BEYONG will
remove poison and plague from therty. Usually answered in a
sanctuary.
</P>

<P>
Prayers to Fshofth is necessary under certain situation. NULAMIR
will attempts to silent the enemies. TULAR is only answered at an
altar. If successfully invoked, it will increase the rty's food by
200 units. RULASAIR is similar to TULAR but can be cast anywhere,
however the increase is only 100 units and is more draining than
TULAR. EMANUI is usually answered in a santuary, it give growing
health. KUURAOTH is only needed to wake up the dark vision from the
mirror that can tell the future of Eriosthe. LAIRIAN is needed to
light the beacon.
</P>

<H4>MAGIC</H4>

<P>	
Magician gain rings depending on their frequent usage of spells from
articular discipline. For example, if you use fire spells
frequently, then you will get the next higher ring of fire earlier
than the other rings. Generally speaking, you will gain one or two
rings everytime you gain level.
</P>

<P>
The effects of the crystal spells are not given in the manual but
you can learn about them by casting CYQIEQARAQK, the tome of the
Seer.
</P>

<H4>THE TOME OF THE SEER</H4>

<P>
The great mystic Cyqie harnessed his own soul to create the spell
which destroyed him. CYQIEKUN shall draw forth flames of the hell in
which he is now imprisoned. So perish all who outreach their
station.
</P>

<P>
Range: 3 by 3 radius from the caster.
</P>

<P>
Your mirror may scry visions of the future, your globe may show
thest, but you are now, and forever slave to the present.
</P>

<P>
The great mystic Cyqie created the spell of ceaseless healing.
CYQIETUR shall form a pure blue globe. Those within shall be
contiually refreshed and restored.
</P>

<P>
The halls of the greatlace, which once thronged with life, are
silent now. Adron, why did you not smite the darkness? But the
beacon remains, and the darkness shall be swallowed by its light.
</P>

<P>
One from thest shall return. One who is captive shall be freed. One
who is once of the light shall be returned to the greatest light.
</P>

<P>
QADIOS is a mighty spell. It forms around those of pure heart the
womb of infinity safety. Focus your minds on great things and no
harm mayss.
</P>

<P>
The obsidian crystal survives in a solamn artifact. The hammer lies
broken, yet it shall break the darkness.
</P>

<P>
Behold the greatest of spells. MUZAQ shall call forth a black
trumpet, when the trumpet sounds, the cries of all the damned souls
in hell shall burst forth in a maelstorm of oblivion.
</P>

<P>
Effect: wipe out all enemies.
</P>

<P>
The kauri plaque is broken, the waking vision now sleeps. Areth: you
will never rule.
</P>

<P>
Behold the mirror that foretells the future. Pray that the dark
tower may crumble. Prayer that the vision can be disspelled. The
dark heart of Uukrul must be shattered, it has been foretold.
</P>

<H4>GENERAL TIPS</H4>

<P>
At low levels (1-6), therty will not be able to fight very well. If
you find that yourrty is taking a lots of punishment, try to let
them gain higher level before proceeding. Healing spells and prayers
are important, so ensure that you can cast/invoke them. Don't
proceed further if you find that you are having little
virtue/psychic points but head straight for the nearest sanctuary
and rest. When you have reach level 10 or more, only the strongest
opponents will be able to hurt you. At this stage, much time is
spent solving puzzles rather than fighting. The maximium level
possible is 15, at this level, the magician and priest will have all
their rings complete and will no longer need to worry about combats.
</P>

<P>
When you find a key in a certain level, it will usually unlock a
grate somewhere on that level. You will not be allow to drop it
before it unlock anything. If your character carry too many keys in
his bacck, he might not be able unlock the grate even though he is
carrying the correct key. If possible, don't let any character carry
too many keys. So it is advisable to store the key in the cache in
the sanctuaries after it was used.
</P>

<P>
Resting in higher levels sanctuaries will heal the rty much faster.
So, always teleport to the last sanctuary you found before resting.
</P>

<P>
Before you can invoke the prayer TULAR successfully, you will need
to buy food rations from the supply shop. Once you have learn to
invoke it, rest in sanctuary to reach full virtue points and then go
to the altars to invoke it. When travelling long distance, make sure
that you have at least 2000-5000 units of food.
</P>

<P>
If you cannot find a way to open any secret door, try ALTIS, HOYAMOQ
or BELAMOQ if possible. This situation usually occurs when you need
to speak a certain word to open the door. The words needed is
usually the answer to a riddle or a ssword found somewhere.
</P>

<P>
Teleporters are only active after you have find it. If you know its
name but have never been to it, then you can't go there.
</P>

<P>
Before you can cast the spell REAAM to identify your items. Go to
Sagaris and ask him to identify it for you. If the properties of any
items is unknown, a visit to Sagaris is usually rewarding.
</P>

<P>
Searching will reveal most secret doors. However, at higher areas,
you will need to cast the spell TALIS to reveal secret doors.
</P>

You will need to find the beacon codes, beacon commands and
instructions.
</P>

<P>
After that, go to the next level and visit all the 4 quadrants. Take
note of the 4 quadrant keys. There are 4 gargoyle riddles in this
area. The answers are: HAMMER, SAGARIS, PRIEST and MAGICIAN. If you
answered incorrectly, you will be sent to some other places. From
what I know, there are two different places. In the first place, you
can get out by walking through the walls. In the second place, there
is no way to get out by searching or walking. Instead, check the
inventory of your magician, a strange scroll is added to his bacck.
By reading it, the rty will be able to escape from here. Behind the
riddles are four prophecies about the future of Eriosthe.
</P>

<P>
Cast Adron's die to reach the next level. There will be another 3
riddles in this place. The first two riddles is obvious, as for the
third, inspect Areth's plague. After answering the riddles, you will
find Uukrul inside. Since you don't have the obsidian heart yet, he
will disappear before you can kill him. The fight is not difficult
though. Cast MUZAQ two times and he will disappear.
</P>

<P>
Now, search Uukrul's room, you will find two secret doors, speak
UUKRUL to open it. You will find another stone heart and a code
book.
</P>

<P>
By now you should have found at least 6 stone hearts already, go to
the heart urn and insert the hearts. You will then be able to get
the obsidian heart of Uukrul.
</P>

<P>
Use Adron's die to goto the hall with 5 dice squares. Step onto the
square with 5 stars and cast the die. Follow the map and find your
way to the Beacon Arming Machine.
</P>

<P>
Beacon Arming Sequence: use code machine, enter code, command, key
</P>

<P>
Example:<BR>
enter VGAK, DIVIDE, 6<BR>
result: north quadrant 1231
</P>

<P>
Alternative Arming Sequence: use code book, translate code, then
apply command with key.
</P>

<P>
Example:<BR>
using code book, V=7, G=3, A=8, K=6<BR>
therefore, 7386 DIVIDE 6 = 1231
</P>

<P>
Enter the arming sequence in the order north,east,south and west.
The beacon will then be armed.
</P>

<P>
After arming the beacon, go back to find Uukrul. Cast the obsidian
heart in his presence and he will be trapped in this plane forever.
His soul will always regenerate his hit points when he is critical,
only the obsidian hammer can split his soul and kill him. After
killing him, you will find an ornate key. Use the key to open the
grate in his room.
</P>

<P>
His treasure room contains large amount of money and some precious
items. But you should have no need for them now, so proceed to the
next sanctuary.
</P>

<H4>URXASZEL: SANCTUARY BEYOND THE BEACON</H4>

<P>
Sagaris will give you instructions when you reach here. There is
nothing in this place, but you will need to go to CHAOS to save
Mara.
</P>

<H4>CHAOS</H4>

<P>
At any teleporter, enter CHAOS and you will be here. A map of CHAOS
is given. In this place thessages warp around, i.e. if you head
north, after sometime you will reach the same old place. Most of the
walls are one sided, i.e. you can walk through one side of them but
not both. Many spinner traps are found here, so check your map and
coss. At certain locations, your coss will not work and you can't
map. Well, there is nevertheless a good news: there is absolutely no
fighting in this place. Just puzzles solving.
</P>

<P>
So, to aid you in your quest, i have found a very simple way for you
to rescue Mara. Follow the instructions closely unless you want to
do it your own way.
</P>

<P>
1. Give the 5 card of moving to your magician. When you step out of
the teleporter CHAOS. Walk to the elevator just infront of the cage
where Mara is trapped. You will be teleported to a place, head east
and you will find a teleporter there. It has button numbered 1 to 4.
</P>

<P>
2. Press 3. Walk east, east to get reach the card room. Get card.
But don't give the card to your magician yet. Go out and step into
the elevator again. Walk to teleporter.
</P>

<P>
3. Press 2. Walk north, then west to get the ornate key. Walk west,
west then face east. You will find a grate here. Open it with the
key and step into it. Read the map. Turn back and walk outside. If
you cannot find the grate, you can go to the teleporter again and
press button 3, then walk east then west to find the grate.
</P>

<P>
4. Give the 6th card to your magician. Walk into the elevator. You
will can to a place where you cannot map. You will need to touch all
six latches within 18 steps.
</P>

<PRE>. . R
L   .
.   E       A
C . . . . V .
    .
    .
    Y       @ <- you will be here when you step into elevator</PRE><TT>

<P>
You might need to perform this sequence a few time. Head north until
you reach latch A. Make sure the message "mechanism restarted" is
there, otherwise you need to move around until it is so. After that,
follow theth indicated: A - V - C - L - R - E - Y. When you have
done that, the cage imprisoning Mara will be opened.
</P>

<P>
5. Now find you way back to Mara cage. Make sure you don't touch the
latches again, otherwise you will need to go back and activate them
again. Walk inside the cage and save Mara.
</P>

<P>
6. Let your magician carries only 5 cards and walk into the
elevator. Walk east to the teleporter and press 3. Walk south and
you will be at the teleporter CHAOS. You can go to any sanctuaries
to save the game if you want to repeat the ending sequence.
Otherwise enter BEACON at the teleporter.
</P>

<H4>BEACON</H4>

<P>
Sagaris and Mara will be waiting for you here. You will need to
enter the last verse for the prayer LAIRIAN in order to light the
beacon. When the beacon is lit, sit back and watch the end game.
