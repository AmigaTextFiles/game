<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Twin brothers Billy and Jimmy Lee must join in deadly combat with
the savage Black Warriors to free Billy's girl Marion. Using martial
arts expertise and whatever weapons they can grab, Billy and Jimmy
pursue the gang to the secret lair of the Shadow Boss for a final
confrontation.

<H2>CHEATS</H2>

<P>
Start a two player game, then press both fire buttons and the "ESC"
key. You will now have unlimited lives.
</P> 

<P>
You can also get rid of the baddies by making them fall from ledges
in the game. If works especially well at the end of level II. Go
as far as the screen will allow then walk backwards, and fall down
from the raised area. You will back down onto the platform below.
Move down alongside the platform edge as far as you can and all the
baddies will fall down.
</P>

<H2>FUN</H2>

<P>
On the title screen press 'ESC' then type "YEP, I CHANGED THE CHEAT
MODE ON THIS VERSION". Now press 'RETURN'. Start the game and you
will be playing upside down.
