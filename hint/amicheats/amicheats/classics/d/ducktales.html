<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
In six different games, at three ability levels, you will search for
the world's rarest treasures in a variety of exotic places. One of
the first things to learn, however, is how to keep and send secrets
by using secret messages. The control center in Scrooge's office is
protected by Gyro Gearloose's Super Anti-Spy Security System,
preventing Glomgold's henchmen, the Beagle boys, from stealing
Scrooge's business secrets. The map of Scrooge's worldwide
operations can be seen by using the Secret Code Sheet to decode the
control center's secret password.
