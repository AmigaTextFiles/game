<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
From the creators of Deja Vu, Uninvited and Shadowgate comes this
interactive graphic adventure game. You've been abducted by two
thugs from Chicago, knocked senseless... and now, if you don't come
up with 100,000 in seven days, your number is up!
</P>

<H2>TIPS</H2>

<OL>
<LI>Take and wear the pants and trenchcoat immediately, since the
bedroom door will lock behind you.
<LI>From time to time, one of Malone's thugs will appear to warn you
how little time you have left; take one of the cigar rings that he
drops.
<LI>Before going outside, visit the Casino and play blackjack at the
table of your former sparring partner. To play blackjack, select
all of your chips (with the shift-click method if using the mouse),
then click on 'operate' and the table. Your friend will then deal
the cards. If your card total is close to 21, click on 'Hit' and
then the table; otherwise, click on 'Hit' and then the 'Self'
button. Ordinarily your former partner will let you win. When he
is replaced, use 'Shift-click' to select all your chips and drag
them to your inventory immediately. Otherwise the new dealer may
confiscate your chips.
<LI>Going South from the desert-related locations often leads to
getting lost in a desert maze.
<LI>Once you have enough money, head directly for the train station.
<LI>Do not wander around the Las Vegas desert, or you will be bitten
by snakes.
<LI>You should only travel East and West from the entrance to the
Lucky Dice Hotel/Casino.
<LI>You will need to travel to and from Chicago by train; boarding
trains for other destinations will get you killed.
<LI>In Chicago, you can travel to different locations by cab but
will have to SHOW addresses to the Cabbie, since he cannot hear you.
<LI>Wear the Police uniform only for the Morgue, and change back to
your regular clothes before leaving Chicago.
<LI>In places where you must wait, make time pass by double
clicking on objects (to examine them).
<LI>Ignore the bag lady near Joe's Bar, as well as all food,
bottles and the references to cigarettes, since these are not
connected with winning the game.
<LI>Turn your printer on before the finale!
