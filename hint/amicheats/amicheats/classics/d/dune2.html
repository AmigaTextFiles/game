<H2>CHEATS</H2>

<P>
When you get to the stage where you have no cash left and there is
no spice to be collected, send your harvester to the enemy camp.
It will be destroyed, another one will replace it and you'll
receive seven credits. You can repeat this as many times as you
like.
</P>

<P>
To harvest spice in no time at all click on a harvester who is 
harvesting spice and keep clicking on him. The percentage of spice
harvested goes up for each click on the harvestor. This saves both
time and money.
</P>

<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
Use Deviator to persuade your opponents to turn over to the other
side (Ordos's side). Then click on the attackbutton and attack
something towards the enemy buildings. Click on the attackbutton
again and wait for the vehicle to change to his natural colour.
Attack an enemy vehicle or a building. The opponents won't bother
and the vehicle can shoot the enemy (or his friends).
</P>

<P>
To destroy or weaken (so you can capture it) a Rocket Turret, use
rocket launchers or the Sonic Wave Tank. Than let it attack the
ground just in front of the Rocket Turret. If you are at the right
angle, you do manage to hit the Rocket Turret and it won't attack
you! You have to experiment a bit with it, as it isn't 100% proof.
Sometimes you do get attacked by the Rocket Turret, or your opponent
sends in some tanks, so keep looking!
</P>

<P>
Sonic Wave Tanks can be very usefull for defense, but NOT close to
your own camp. Try to find a bit rock that is near a path of your
opponent. Position one or more Sonic Wave Tanks and leave them in
guard mode. Enemy vehicles will drive past your Sonic Wave Tanks,
even if the tanks start attacking (but STILL in guard mode). That
way your enemies are weakened and your own Rocket Turrets can finish
them more easily.
</P>

<P>
If you have a Carry-all, make sure your Repair Facility is
surrounded by other buildings or vehicles. That way repaired
vehicles can't leave the Reapir Facility and the Carry-all will put
it back where it came from. Otherwise repaired vehicles will drive
just outside the Reapir Facility.
</P>

<P>
This tip only works using Ordos as your selected house. First build
up your base as normal with defences, then send a few tanks into the
enemy base to locate their construction yard and work out the
general layout of their other installations. The enemy will begin
to attack your base, but the defences you built up earlier should be
strong enough to cope with the intruders. Send a deviator launcher
between your base and the enemy base. When an enemy tank appears
use the deviator to change it into an Ordos tank. Then select it
and order it to attack the enemy construction yard. When you've
done this select it again and select Attack but don't click on
anything. When the tank changes back to the enemy's side click on
the construction yard again and the enemy tank fires on its own base
until the construction yard is destroyed. Repeat this process with
other enemy units and it is possible to defeat the enemy using their
own vehicles.
</P>

<H3>SPECIAL TACTICS</H3>

<P>
Always defend your base well with the best possible units. Until
defensive turrets become available leave units on guard, never send
them all out at the same time. Later on in the game, a group of
well placed rocket turrets will leave you free to concentrate on
attacking. Always place rocket turrets on the edge of the base so
they don't interfere with future buildings.
</P>

<P>
To stop the Harkonen forces wandering into your base and smashing
everything up, determine the direction of attack - as a rule, enemy
units attack from one direction. Then build a line of around half a
dozen concrete blocks extending from your base towards the enemy.
Now build another line of blocks cutting across your first line at
right angles, so that it faces the enemy. Now all you need to do is
build rocket launchers along the wall and that should stop most
units from getting near your base!
</P>

<P>
Don't forget to attack! The enemy will often send a constant stream
of units at you but it is important to build up a force and take a
shot at the enemy base instead of just defending your own. You can
often find the enemy base by following his units back there.
</P>

<P>
On the later levels build a Starport. This is a very important
building to own since it enables you to buy units from The
Merchant's Guild for anything upto half the price it costs to build
them! Keep checking for bargains, because the prices change
everytime you look.
</P>

<P>
If you have a Heavy Factory or a Starport, either build or order a
few extra Harvesters. This way you only need to build one Spice
Refinery. You should have about three Harvesters to maximise spice
production. Don't forget to build Spice Silos as the spice can
build up quickly. If you are short on credits, sometimes you don't
even need to build factories because the Starport will provide
everything, usually at a cheaper price. The down side however, is
that the Starport can run out of stock, which can be inconvenient.
</P>

<P>
A Repair Facility is almost essential once they become available.
Carry-alls can bring damaged units to them and take them back to the
battlefield.
</P>

<P>
If you capture enemy factories you can build their special units
such as The Deviator, The Devastator and The Sonic Tank.
</P>

<P>
Watch out for sneak attacks especially near the start of a level.
Your first encounter with an enemy house will often be when they
airlift troops near your base in a Carry-all. The troops can appear
on any side of the base so make sure all sides are guarded. After
that you can concentrate your defences on the side of your base
which faces the enemy one.
</P>

<P>
If you're having problems with the Harkonen forces wandering into
your bases and blowing everything up. The best form of defence is
this. Determine the direction of attack - as a rule, enemy units
attack from one direction. Then build a line of around half a dozen
concrete blocks extending from your base towards the enemy. Now
build another line of blocks cutting across your first line at right
angles, so that it faces the enemy. Now all you need to do is build
rocket launchers along the wall and that should stop most units from
getting near your base! Your most important building is the
Construction Yard (see attack plan). On the later levels the enemy
will sometimes try to concentrate their attack on it and Death Hands
are frequently aimed at it.
</P>

<P>
If it is destroyed you can no longer build any new buildings, so
guard it well. If you are unlucky and lose it, order or build a
Mobile Construction Facility and deploy it where the Construction
Yard used to be.
</P>

<P>
The Spice Refinery is another important building. If it is
destroyed when you are low on credits then you won't be able to
rebuild it because of the lack of money and you will not be able to
refine spice to earn credits. In this dire situation, your base
will eventually be destroyed, unless you have almost finished the
level.
</P>

<P>
On the last two levels you will be allowed to build a House Palace.
This can only be built once you have a Starport. It is very
expensive (999 credits) but is extremely well armoured and is free
to repair. It also gives you access to your House's Special Ability
(Fremen, Saboteur or Death Hand).
</P>

<H3>THE ATTACK PLAN</H3>

<P>
When attacking, the most important building to destroy is the emeny
Construction Facility - once you have done this they can't replace
any of the buildings you take out. You should also concentrate on
taking out the enemy defence turrets before finishing off the rest
of the base.
</P>

<P>
Victory is almost assured if you destroy the Construction Facility,
although the enemy usually has more than one of them in later
levels. Until tanks become available, the Harvester is one of your
most important weapons because it's a tracked unit and can be used
to squash any enemy troopers or infantry sent to attack your base.
</P>

<P>
It's useful to have a Harvester guarding your base especially if
you're fighting the Harkonnens, because they like using Heavy
Troopers which can be very difficult to destroy.
</P>

<H3>DESTROYING ENEMY PALACES</H3>

<P>
Destroying enemy House Palaces is very hard because they're also
free for them to repair. You have to launch an all-out attack
mainly with Missile Launchers and Heavy Tanks to stand a chance.
</P>

<P>
Destroying a Palace can take some time, but you can afford to put
all your units onto the task and provide air support with
Ornithopters. In effect you have to damage the Palace faster than
your enemy can repair it, but this can be done.
</P>

<H3>THE LAST FEW LEVELS</H3>

<P>
On the last two levels both opposing houses team up to destroy you.
This isn't as bad as it sounds - it just means you need to defend
your base a bit more against the extra units the combined enemy send
in. It also means you have to destroy two bases instead of one.
</P>

<P>
You can also build Palaces on these levels - as can your enemies -
and IX Research Centres which enable you to construct special units.
If you use these units well, and follow the attack plan, these
levels are not much harder than the others.
</P>

<H3>THE FINAL BATTLE</H3>

<P>
On this level you face the two enemy houses and the Emperor's Elite
forces. This level is extremely hard compared to the rest of the
game and you just have to muddle through. The enemies are always
attacking in great numbers and you really have to watch out for
Death Hands as the Harkonnens and The Emperor both have them - don't
forget to save your position regularly. Keep the same attack plan
since it's vital to start attacking even though your base is under
siege from the beginning. Use an Ornithopter to determine the
position of enemy bases since they're widely spread out over the
opposite side of the map to you, usually to the North.
</P>

<P>
Remember enemies have at least two Construction Facilities on this
level so it's important to hit them all. Isolate one enemy at a
time and destroy them before moving on to the next and try to
capture their factories so you can build the special weapons.
Captured factories are often situated in strategic positions close
to other enemies, which makes them ideal if your base is far away.
</P>

<P>
It's best to leave the Emperor's Sardaukar Base until last. The
Sardaukar have large numbers of all the standard units which have
been improved to elite status, coloured purple. The Sardaukar's
Troopers are hard to kill unless they're run over by a tracked unit.
They also have their Construction Yard very heavily guarded with a
further Construction Yard hidden away in a corner, so it's important
to explore the map.
</P>

<P>
The Sardaukar Base is also very heavily guarded. It has a
double-strength defensive wall around it with lots of Rocket Turrets
on the perimeter. The best way to destroy the base is by taking its
Construction Facility with a group of four or five Rocket Launchers
sited in a destroyed enemy base, so the Sardaukar cannot see them.
A quick surprise attack on the Construction Yard with Rocket Tanks
can destroy it before the Sardaukar can start repairs.
</P>

<P>
Now try destroying some of the defensive turrets and other
buildings. Rocket Tanks are extremely useful, so keep them well
protected unless you want them knocked out by a rogue Siege Tank.
</P>

<P>
If your enemy starts rebuilding, then they have a secret
Construction Yard which must be knocked out. Do this and eventually
the enemy's defences collapse, leaving the Sardaukar Palace to be
destroyed. This is very hard to achieve, so you just have to pile
all your forces onto it and wait. When the Palace is finally
destroyed you've completed the game and can watch the end sequence.
