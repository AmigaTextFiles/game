<H2>CHEATS</H2>

<P>
On the high score table enter "HINGSEN.J" for your name and use the
function keys to select events. If this does't work type
"HINGSEN-J" then press the 'DEL' key. The high score table should
say demo. Now type "-J" again and it should change to mega demo.
</P>

<P>
If you're having trouble getting this cheat to work then try this:
On the title/high score page, wait until the music finishes playing.
Now when you type in the cheat should hear a drum noise after each
correct key press. If you hit a wrong key then you'll have to start
again.
</P>

then cross.
