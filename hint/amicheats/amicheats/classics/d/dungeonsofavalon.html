<P>
Go to the adventures guild, and load in one of the characters
given at the start (let's say you chose amber). Create five
new characters, of any race or type. Make sure that all five
people have at least 130 gold pieces. Go to the weapon shop,
and pool all the gold, giving it to amber. Go back to the
adventurers guild and remove all players but amber. Now load
in the other five characters that are pre-made at the start
of the game. You can now start your quest with somewhere in
the region of 1000 gold pieces - unless you kit everyone up at
the weapon store, train, etc. You can repeat this as many
times as you want each go, giving you in effect infinite money.
