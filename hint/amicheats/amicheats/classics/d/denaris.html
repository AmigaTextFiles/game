<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Throughout time, man has been a victim of his own intelligence and
his insatiable thirst for knowledge. The planet Denaris is a
horrifying example. Scientists created Machines which became so
sophisticated they no longer depended on man, so began a rule of
tyranny. The Denarian people tried in vain to destroy the Machines
with a mighty ballistic missile, but from the ashes of the nuclear
fires the Machines rose up more powerful than ever. Trapped in an
underground stronghold, now the Denarians only hope for freedom is
the DS-H75 Eagle Fighter, an ultra refined space glider. Control the
Eagle Fighter in this epic crusade against evil... and win freedom
at last for Denaris.
