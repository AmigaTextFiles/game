<H2>TIPS</H2>

<OL>
<LI>If you die during a warp malfunction, the game skips the
tax-free shop and the next level. You can use this to your
advantage in the harder levels, especially in the Big Trouble
stages. So make sure you have plenty of lives left. When you get
to the level you want to skip, especially Big Trouble, just pray for
a warp malfunction! If you get a warp malfunction, just kill
yourself once (It's a good idea not to do this until there's only
one alien left on the screen).
<LI>If you buy extra lives when you already have four, you will get
armour instead (but for 400 credits instead of 600).
<LI>It is generally not a good idea to spend any credits until you
have 500. When you get 500 credits, buy the Super Weapon.
<LI>If you hold down the fire button (make sure to disable autofire
if you have it on) from the moment you grab the Meteor Storm
icon right up to the end of the Meteor Storm, you will get the
secret $5000 bonus (This only works in version 2.4+)
<LI>On Version 2.4, it is not a good idea to buy the $3000 weapon
until you're in levels 51-75.
<LI>The weapons that cost $750 and higher are generally not very
handy unless you have autofire (Ver 2.4). If you do have
autofire and have one of these weapons, what you have is an
incredibly nasty weapon!
<LI>You can also "cheat" by using a hex editor and editing the main
program. Just find the part of the code that lists all the
prices in the tax-free shop (make sure they are not part of the
menu, if you modify the menu in any way the game won't run!)
and change the numbers to whatever you want. This way, you can
make everything cost nothing if you want! However, you'll
still need $50 to enter the shop, and $400 for continues (or
$200, in version 2.3).
