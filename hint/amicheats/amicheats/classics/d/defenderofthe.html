<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
The age of chivalry! A time of lusty wenches and black-hearted
villians. The king has been murdered and England thrown into civil
war! Amidst the ringing clash of steel and the thunder of charging
steeds, the bold Saxon knights have chosen you to lead them in
battle against the hated Normans. Victory will not come easy. To
save England, your skills as swordsman and military leader will be
severly tested. But should you succeed, you'll win the Crown of
England and the love of many a beautiful damsel!
</P>

<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
If you begin the game at the lowest castle, move all your men in
your army and take the 3 high vassal/income territories below. This
will give you a lot of men in your army. Moved back to your castle
you will also be able to buy lots of men.
</P>

<P>
When sword fighting move forward, backward, strike, and repeat, you
should beat your opponents with no problems.
</P>

<P>
When jousting move your lance until it is just left of your
opponents shield, then down a little. Count the number of bounces
and on the 5th strike at the lowest possible point.
</P>

<H2>CHEATS</H2>

<P>
I was only able to get the first one of these to work.
</P>

<P>
While the game is loading hold down the 'K' key until the game is
loading. You should now start the game with 2048 knights.
</P>

<P>
To get 1,024 Knights: After conquering a territory, press these
four keys at the same time, while the drive is still running: 'H',
'J', 'K', 'L' or only 'K' ? If you do it just right, you'll have
1,024 knights both in your home and in your army.
