<P>
Better buckle up, you're about to experience all the engine-roaring,
tire-screeching stock car action of the movie Days of Thunder. This
heart-pounding adventure features the challenge of eight incredible
races on a variety of totally hot tracks. Choose a car, then
customize it for maximum speed and handling on the course.

Press 'P' to pause the game and type "COMEFLYWITHME". The screen
should flash. Now press 'P' again to unpause the game. This will
let you fly. Pull back on the joystick and soar into the air. Use
the fire button to move forward and the function keys to get a view
of yourself flying through the sky.
