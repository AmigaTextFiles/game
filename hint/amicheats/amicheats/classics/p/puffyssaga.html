<P>
Pause the game when your health nears zero, then run your fingers
along 'F1' through 'F7'. You'll get 2000 healths, 4 keys, 4 goms,
and you'll be transported to the next level. 
</P>

<P>
Also, if you have 2 goms, you can call up a map of the level by
pressing the 'F6' and/or 'F7' KEYS. Press 'F5' and 'F6' together
and you will be advanced to level 7. Press 'DEL' to go to level 8
press it again to go to level 9.
