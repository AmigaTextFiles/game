<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Eat and beat your way through 150 screens of awesome, nourishing fun
and relive the Prehistorik epic in this incredible platform game.
Armed with your Diner Club Anticus, proven to be the ancestor of the
baseball bat, you start in pursuit of the Hilarious Maxidocus and
take on armies of hairy spiders. Explore the virgin icefields of
Antarctica, lush tropic jungles, and the dark and mysterious caverns
of the shady continent. Don't worry about beatin' and meatin', it's
for the good of the T-bone tribe. The hunt for lunch is on; come and
get it!
</P>

<H2>HINTS</H2>

<P>
After killing the strange turtle-like creature on the first level,
you should come to a screen with two carnivorous fish bouncing up
and down in the water, along with four banks. To get to the secret
room don't jump over the first well. Instead jump inside it and
fall down into the secret room!
</P>

<P>
Later on the first level, look out for a ladder near some water
which leads up to a platform containing an egg. Climb the ladder
and take the egg, then go to the left into the water to find the
submarine room.
</P>

<P>
There is also a way to find some hidden extra food. Go to the
third screen of level three and jump forward hitting empty space.
The hidden food should now appear.
