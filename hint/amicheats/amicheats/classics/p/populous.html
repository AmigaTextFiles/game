<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Earthquakes are serious fun. Deities are the all-powerful rulers of
the worlds, but two deities in one world is one too many. You give
them good land. You tell them when to farm and when to fight. You
make them content beyond their wildest dreams, But then they become
raging arsonists. What's a deity to do?
</P>

<H2>TIPS</H2>

<H3>BUILDING</H3>

<P>
Double Click on the same point and then remove the top point,
allowing you to create an area of nine flat blocks in only three
clicks.
</P>

<H3>NOW YOU CAN TURF OR SPROG</H3>

<P>
Reduce the area of crop fields that a castle has and the size of the
building will be reduced. This lowers the capacity of the building
to hold people and will force a walker to leave if it is too
crowded. Use this method to force a walker from a large castle. It
is important to note that the largest castle uses an extra block
around the edge of it's crop fields. This land cannot be used for
direct settlement.
</P>

<H3>LAND MAINTENANCE</H3>

<P>
Keep your land clean and tidy, remove swamps, rocks, broken and bad
land. Without a strong clean landscape, your population will not
flourish. Remove swamps as they are a direct drain on your
population - especially bottomless swamps.
</P>

<H3>HOW TO DEAL WITH THOSE KNIGHTS</H3>

<P>
If the enemy starts to use knights against you, you have a number of
options open. Try ignoring the knight and letting it rampage
through your land and burn a few houses; but make sure that you
clean up the land and resettle behind it. Try to drown the knight -
the computer opponent will not often allow you to get away with this
but with practice it can often be achieved. The secret is to build
a tough leader that can defeat the knight in combat. It is possible
to use a system of buildings to create an artificial barrier to the
knight's progress by nipling the land, letting the knight fight
through the small houses, then removing the nipples to free some
flat land to resettle.
</P>

<H3>TOUGH LEADERS</H3>

<P>
Collect your people in a leader and then use the leader to assault
the enemy. This is one of the most satisfying ways of playing
Populous. A tough leader can also defeat opposing leaders, knights,
and can form a tough knight for your side.
</P>

<H3>PAPAL MAGNET MODE</H3>

<P>
Careful use early in the game can move your leader and people away
from the homeland and into new territory fresh for expansion.
</P>

<H3>WALKERS HAVE IQ</H3>

<P>
IQ is determined by the technology that the walkers have and the
number of times that they have been sprogged from a settlement. The
degrees of intelligence are reflected in the walker's ability to
locate new land etc. A low IQ walker will waste valuable time
circling a large castle trying to find some fresh unsettled land,
whereas the high IQ walker will spot the land five or six squares
away.
</P>

<H3>TECHNOLOGY</H3>

<P>
The technology which a person has directly affects the outcome of
any combat that they are involved in. The weapons factor acts as a
multiplier - and so weak people with swords are often a match for
stronger club-wielding walkers.
</P>

<H3>FIGHT MODE</H3>

<P>
This mode is very good for passive expansion. Your people will move
towards the enemy and will tend to settle as they go. This mode is
most useful when you are close to each other at the start of the
game.
</P>

<H3>THE FIGHTING LEADER</H3>

<P>
You can use your leader as a direct and controllable weapon, by
placing the magnet in the building that you want to attack and then
going into 'GOTO MAGNET' mode. Your leader will charge off and
attack the building, occupying it after the combat. But move the
magnet and off he charges. In this mode you are not settling
anything except the buildings that you are fighting over, so beware
of depopulating your lands or being out populated. Your leader is
constantly being supported by your walkers who are drawn to him.
</P>

<H3>HOW TO WIN GAMES</H3>

<P>
The most gratifying way of finishing games is by direct use of your
leader. A couple of tough knights certainly knock the stuffing out
of weak opponents. Aided by the leader you can quite quickly finish
the opponents off. Armageddon will draw the game to an instant
conclusion, but try swamping just before your armageddon if the
score is close on population.
</P>

<H3>COMPUTER STRATEGIES</H3>

<P>
Learn the tactics and strategies that the computer uses. Look at
the options it is allowed and decide which effects it will use. If
it can only flood then build higher; if it can only quake then get
ready to be shaken about. Learn the way the computer builds and
take advantage of it.
</P>

<H2>ADVANCED TIPS</H2>

<H3>NIPPLING</H3>

<P>
Turf people from castles by lumping or nippling the land around
them. Don't remove the lumps and let the walkers settle amongst the
smaller castles. Do this to a larger area around your castles and
then remove all the lumps. This will have a knock on effect that
should produce a number of new castles at the edge of your land, and
then you can expand out from these. This tactic also shortens the
time taken for a walker to settle after being turfed - a vital thing
to do on landscapes where the environment is harmful.
</P>

<H3>MULTISPROGGING</H3>

<P>
This is similar to nippling - and is designed to create as many
settlements from one as possible. A large castle that has a
reasonable population in it will reduce and produce a walker, so as
soon as that happens reduce it again so that another walker is
produced. The first walker will have settled and also can be
reduced to produce another. From one castle, four settlements can
be created. Flatten the land and you can create four castles from
one.
</P>

<H3>DETERMINATION</H3>

<P>
The best way to win any game is to out-build the opponent. Against
the computer at higher rates this is often quite hard; however you
can keep building after the computer has altered it's priority to
attacking rather than building. You must weather the attack and
continue to build as you can - eventually you can win through.
</P>

<H3>POOR MAN'S VOLCANO</H3>

<P>
Get someone into the enemy's land and then settle them. Scroll the
map to the furthest point from the flag of your building then raise
the land, upsetting as many of his houses as possible. This is a
cheap way of creating a volcano.
</P>

<H3>SWAMPS</H3>

<P>
These are quite simply the most lethal weapon that you have. He who
swamps first swamps hardest. Swamp his leaders, his knights and his
people. Swamps will significantly reduce his population and can
often keep the computer player down while you are building.
</P>

<H3>THE HANDY SWAMP PLATFORM</H3>

<P>
To counteract the effect of the computer swamping your leader, you
can place the magnet in an area of land that is lumpy and not
susceptible to swamps. Collect your leader here and then release
knights into his land. The computer will try to swamp and have no
effect, thus wasting manna.
</P>

<H3>BUILDING HIGH</H3>

<P>
If the computer has flood and a few other options, it is a good
tactic to build at two or three levels high. You can simply ignore
the flood and let it affect only it's own people.
</P>

<H3>DOUBLE VOLCANO</H3>

<P>
If you build a volcano, try to do it on another volcano, either two
together or on the side of another. Two volcanos together have more
effect than two separate. A double volcano is very time and manna
consuming to remove.
</P>

<H3>CHARGE</H3>

<P>
Getting your buildings amongst the opponents gives you the chance to
drown people, upset buildings and generally start attacking where it
hurts - his home. You will also have the advantage of being safer
from swamps and other effects. The computer will start to clean up
the land which your people are settling.
</P>

<H3>ZEN</H3>

<P>
Try building lots of settlements without bothering about turning
them into castles. This give you a larger number of walkers, but
they are weaker than the castle-sprogged walkers. Zen allows you to
ignore the special effects and concentrate on spreading and leading
your people with your leader. Building through the hills tends to
stop enemy knights, since they spend all their time destroying small
and rather worthless huts and tents rather than important houses and
castles. This is called the Sproggy Mountain Tactic, and you should
also build your castles at the back of the land with this buffer of
tiny settlements before it.
</P>

<H3>EXPANSIONIST POLICY</H3>

<P>
Learn the patterns of crop fields which are required by the various
buildings. Learn the fastest building techniques and learn how to
multisprogg and nipple. Then keep your land clean and build. Build
some more, you can win some very tough games this way. Keep doing
this until you have out populated the opponent and have enough
energy to armageddon. Do so and win!
</P>

<H3>THE LOUISIANNA TACTIC</H3>

<P>
If it moves swamp it, if it doesn't move swamp it anyway.
</P>

<H2>TWO PLAYER TIPS</H2>

<H3>DROWN PEOPLE</H3>

<P>
In the two player game the other player is less likely to notice the
drowning people. If water is harmful then leave the people drowning
in puddles, you will find that people die very quickly in water!!!
</P>

<H3>HOW TO SWAMP OFF PEAK AREAS</H3>

<P>
Swamp an area that is at the back or in an out-of-the-way place, and
the other player will take longer to find it and may not remove it
as quickly. This will allow more people to fall to their deaths.
Swamping after the other player has just swamped causes confusion
(and if possible also earthquake well away from your swamp). The
result will be that it looks like your retaliation was like a quake
- and that the nasty sounds are your people drowning in their own
swamps. Don't forget to tidy up after you with reference to these.

On the title screen, type "KILLUSPAL" to warp to level 999.

<P>
Fill the landscape with the maximum of 200 people to force one of
the three hidden monsters to appear.
</P>

<P>
First load the conquest game as usual, and click on the game setup
icon. Then select custom game and go to game options, changing
anything you like. Finally click on evil, then two players, and
then cancel. The enemy will now be unable to alter the landscape,
preventing him from making any progress.
