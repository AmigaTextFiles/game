<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Tackle the action-packed job of a paperboy in this arcade. Deliver
papers to subscribers (and smash the windows of non-subcribers) as
you avoid cars, workmen, cats, lawnmowers and burglars. Then head
out to the Paperboy Training Grounds for bonus points.
</P>

<H2>TIPS</H2>

<H3>GENERAL</H3>

<P>
A hundred points are scored for the successful delivery of a paper
into a mailbox or on a doormat.
</P>

<P>
Fifty points are scored for picking up a bundle of news-papers -
this also resets the number of papers you have to eight.
</P>

<P>
Bonus points are awarded for breaking windows, lamps and gravestones
and for knocking the lids off dustbins.
</P>

<P>
Go for as many broken windows as possible, as these will build up
your bonus total which is added to your points total at the start of
the target course.
</P>

<P>
Don't throw away your papers recklessly - make sure that you have
enough left for the deliveries before the next bundle pick-up.
</P>

<P>
Don't ride over drains or manhole covers as these will cause you to
crash.
</P>

<P>
Don't bump into anything that moves, as this will cause you to fall
off your bike - some hazards may be stopped in their tracks by
hitting them with a paper.
</P>

<P>
If you deliver a paper to every house with a mailbox (subscriber),
you will score a perfect delivery and will be awarded an extra
subscriber on the following day.
</P>

<P>
Don't hit the man in front of houses with mailboxes, otherwise you
will loose their subscription on the next day.
</P>

<P>
If you fail to deliver a paper to a subscriber's house, then he will
cancel his subscription and will not be available on the following
days.
</P>

<H3>THE TARGET COURSE</H3>

<P>
250 points are scored for hitting a target.
</P>

<P>
On the target course, ride flat out - do not slow down. Use your
papers to hit only the targets - not points are scored for breaking
the orange blocks with your papers.
</P>

<P>
Riding your bike over the ramps will replenish your supply of
papers.
</P>

<P>
If you complete the course in time, the remaining time will be
converted into bonus points and added to your points total.
</P>
