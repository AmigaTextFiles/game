<H2>GENERAL HINTS</H2>

<OL>
<LI>Buy a few young, cheap players and keep them in the squad for a
whole season. Next year, their price will have increased and you
should have no trouble selling them for a huge profit. 
<LI>Only buy players with very high agility ratings, as this effects
all their other attributes. If agility is high (about 200),
expect the player to become an excellent footballer, given a
season or two. 
<LI>Remove 8 or 9 players from your team, then after 2 or 3 big
defeats you will receive sponsorship.
