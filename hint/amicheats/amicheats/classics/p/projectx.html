<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
It's the same old story: someone else's mistake has become your
problem. The mad fools - the scientists did it for fun, they must
have. No one wanted massive, mutated, insect-like droids, the ugly
by-products of early biomechanical experiments - not me and certainly
not you. Dumped on the planet Ryxx and left to stagnate and fade
out, the sickening mutations not only survived but thrived. Their
intelligence circuits warped., they are now seeking revenge for
their tortured past. Fears of an all-out attack have forced the
Federation into action! Your mission is simple. Fly to Ryxx, into
the heart of the station the evil beings have made their lair, and
blow the whole thing sky high! Game takes player through six
sections. Two skill levels, choice of craft, choice of music or
soundfx, many special effects and sound/speech effects, password
system for players getting far into the game, and more.
</P>

<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
If you fly into the first end of level baddie when its jaws opens
up, avoiding its fire and being careful not to touch it, you will
be presented with a version of Space Invaders. Complete one wave
and you will be given three extra lives and be thrown back into the
fray.
</P>

<P>
When you die, pilot your flashing ship down below the score at the
bottom of the screen to have a free tunnel of aliens.
</P>

<P>
When you get to the guardian, stay at the very top right of the
screen. It can never reach you, and you can kill it with
homingmissiles without moving.
</P>

<P>
Always select the Crux II battle ship. Although it's quite slow and
has heavy inertia it packs a hard punch and starts off with enough
weaponry to ensure your ship soon becomes able to deal with stronger
enemies.
</P>

<P>
Don't use Speed power-ups on the Crux II until you've nearly powered
up your craft completely, otherwise the inertia is unbearable.
</P>

<P>
Power up your Plasma as soon as possible - you can power it up to
eight times. Once it's powered up five times it becomes very
effective.
</P>

<P>
Don't be tempted by the Laser or Magma weapons, they aren't as good
for general blasting.
</P>

<P>
Pack as many homing missiles on as you can, up to a maximum of four.
These are effective when there's lots of enemies on screen.
</P>

<P>
Power up the Build-Up weapon, and press 'A'. This enables you to
hold the fire button down and build up a massive laser, which is
useful against end of level nasties (e.g. the nasty on level one
can be destroyed with just one shot). Go back to autofire by
pressing 'A'.
</P>

<P>
Always play in Arcade mode if you want to progress further than
level 2!
</P>

<P>
Always keep your craft in the middle of the screen towards the left
side. This way you will always be aware of things approaching you.
</P>

<P>
Don't be greedy! There are more than enough power-ups available.
</P>

<P>
When killed, your weapon strengths decrease by 25%, so if you
collect two homing missiles you will be left with one.
</P>

<P>
It pays to dodge some enemies rather than fight to destroy them all.
</P>

<P>
When you reach the end of level two baddie, quickly fly into the top
right corner of the screen and stay there. Now if you're powered up
with homing missiles you can safely fire then at him until he dies.
Obviously the more missiles you have the quicker he'll die. I don't
know if you can perform this little trick in the special edition of
the game.
</P>

<P>
It was alleged that upon reaching the first end of level baddie, and
flying through it's open jaws, would transport you to a bonus stage
from which you could gain some extra lives. Well unfortunately it's
not true. This tip was printed by Amiga Action, whose purpose was
to see how many other Amiga magazines would copy from their own.
Quite a few did as well!
</P>

<P>
It's also been said that on level 2, just after you die, when your
craft is flashing, quickly fly down under the scenery and you'll
find yourself in an enemy free tunnel for the rest of the level.
Well it's true that you might not encounter any enemies down there
but you will find a few rocks, thus loosing some lives.
