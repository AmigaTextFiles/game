The extra ship is the pirate mothership. To reach it, collect the
grafgold key hidden on every ship. The grafgold keys are usually
found under crates and so on. Collecting a key keeps the pirates at
bay for a further three minutes. A 5000 point bonus is given for
completing a ship with grafgold key. Complete the final ship with
every grafgold key to be beamed aboard the pirate mothership for a
fight to the death.
