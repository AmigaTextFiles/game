<P>
Press '0' on the numeric keypad to enable these in game keys:
</P>

<P>
'1' ---- for slow motion<BR>
'D' ---- to put a zero in the counter<BR>
'Help' - to get an extra ball on the table
</P>

<P>
Choose a table, but before you fire the first ball press 'Ctrl' and
'Help'. Shoot the ball with the 'Return' key and then press 'Ctrl'
for another ball. You can then have three balls in play at once.
Press 'Help' again and you have unlimited balls.
</P>

<P>
Each time you lose a ball you can now press 'CtrL' and get another
one. If you want even more than three balls then you can press
'Help' and 'Return' together. You can then launch the ball and
press 'Ctrl' again to have more than three balls in one game.
</P>

<H2>TIPS</H2>

<H3>LAW 'N' JUSTICE</H3>

<P>
The most important thing you have to master on this one is use your
top flipper. It's easy to forget it's there, or even just not use
it, but you'll have to if you want to hit those lovely jackpots.
</P>

<P>
One of the best things to aim for, points wise, is the ramp, the
ball comes down when you kick off. The first time you get the ball
up there you get 5 million and then each time after 5 more.
</P>

<P>
Another thing to try is to get as many combos as possible. Each one
of these is worth 1 million to your score when you lose the ball.
So go for them, they're not too hard.
</P>

<P>
Other things to keep your eye open for is sparky's fire, worth 50
million, the street shoot out and the jail break.
</P>

<P>
This table has lots to aim for and plenty of points begging to be
taken, so realistically a good score has to be between 100 and 200
million.
</P>

<H3>EXTREME</H3>

<P>
The things to really go for on this table are all the combos.
Air-mountain-tunnel combos are all worth a fair few points and are
easy enough to do. Getting extreme, by hitting the button in the
bottom right hand of the table, is also quite easy and with a
jackpot of over 60 million up for grabs, it's worth trying to get.
</P>

<P>
Other features include bungee jumping, which is worth 5 million
first time and accumulates an extra 5 each time after, free falling,
or diving, which can be worth in excess of 50 million and speed.
Bungee jumping and diving can be activated by hitting the left hand
chute, whilst speed is a bit harder as you have to hit the right
hand chute four times.
</P>

<H3>BABEWATCH</H3>

<P>
It's different from Law `n Justice in that everything to aim for is
at the top of the table. There's very little at the bottom to hit.
This makes things more difficult. The chutes are hard to hit and if
you do, watch out as they're aimed so that the ball comes flying
down the middle of the table and past your flippers before you know
it.
</P>

<P>
You'll have to learn to use tilt on this one. Just a couple of
tilts either way will usually help, but don't tilt too much
otherwise your game is over.
</P>

<P>
For the big points on this table aim for the race chute and the
jukebox. Alternatively you can go for the Casino, or Gym and
there's points for the grabs there as well. If you did hit the Gym
and it says "Show Some Muscle", hit the Jackpot, or Casino chute and
you'll have 30 million.
