</P>

<H2>SOLVE</H2>

<H3>DAY 1</H3>

<P>
The adventure begins when you, detective Sonny Bonds, are getting to
work at Lytton Police Station.
</P>

<P>
First, yuo have to GET KEYS from ignition. Now OPEN COMPARTMENT and
GET LPD BUSINESS CARD. You will need it later. Ok, in order to
leave a car press F4. Go to the Police Station and UNLOCK DOOR. As
you are homicide officer, go to the Homicide Office.
</P>

<P>
SIT on a spare stool and LOOK BASKET. There you discover subpoena.
UNLOCK DRAWER, GET LETTER and READ LETTER. GET WALLET (you can OPEN
WALLET if you like to see what`s inside). C`ause drawer is now
empty you will CLOSE DRAWER. STAND and look around. There is one
quite interesting paper on captain Hall`s desk, so go near it and
LOOK PAPERS. You can see some words - write them down, they are
passwords to computer data bank. LOOK BULLETIN BOARDS near window
and you will see that your shooting scores ain`t too good. Don`t
worry, you fix that pretty soon. USE COMPUTER and TURN COMPUTER ON.
You can use it as a primitive dos based system - commands like DIR
and CD are available.Feel free to dig around in data banks, but be
sure to scan following topics : Personnel\Pratt_Lloyd and
Personnel\Haines_Calvin. When you`ve had your fill of this computer
type QUIT to end computer session.
</P>

<P>
Go to the Narcotics office and SPEAK TO LLOYD PRATT. He has a
drug-problem. ASK ABOUT DRUGS and you have saved Pratt from his
drug problem. Good work!
</P>

<P>
You must be thinking by now "what about that shooting stuff?". Be
patient, we are coming to it. First you have to get some equipment.
Go to the Locker room. In order to get your locker code LOOK BACK
OF THE LPD CARD. Now find your locker and OPEN LOCKER. GET YOUR
GUN from locker. You must`nt forget ammo, so TAKE AMMO CLIPS and
TAKE HANDCUFFS. CLOSE LOCKER. What are you waiting for, let`s go
to the shooting range!
</P>

<P>
GIVE GUN TO WEAPON OFFICER for quick trigger check. GET EAR
PROTECTORS from Mills and go to the free booth.
</P>

<P>
This seems to be a good time to give some tips about weapon usage:
</P>

<P>
'F6' -- load gun<BR>
'F8' -- Draw / Holster gun<BR>
'F10' - Shoot
</P>

<P>
To leave a booth, simply type LEAVE RANGE. When in booth, you have
to operate buttons, change targets, and do some other things.
Before doing anything else, (this will not apply to shooting, of
course), holster your weapon.
</P>

<P>
Ok, let`s get on with shooting. USE EAR PROTECTORS to pervent
permanent damage to your hearing system. Now load your gun with F6
and draw it with F8. Get a good aim and shoot. Only one shot at a
time will suffice. Lower gun and PRESS VIEW BUTTON. LOOK TARGET.
You will see that gun ain`t properly sighted. ADJUST SIGHT. There
is two screws - elevation and windage. Adjust them (with arrow
keys) and CHANGE TARGET. PRESS BACK BUTTON and shoot again. Repeat
this, until you got gun properly sigted. If you should run out of
ammo, go see Mills and GET AMMO. Don`t forget to USE EAR PROTECTORS
when you re-enter to the booth.
</P>

<P>
When you`re all done, exhaust current ammo clip into target. Go
back to the Mills and GIVE EAR PROTECTORS to him. You also should
GET AMMO - you newer know, when you may need some. Go again to
Homicide office, where captain Hall announces that Jessie Bains has
escaped and assigns you to this case. OPEN CABINET and GET BAINS
FILE. You notice that there is two photos of that bastard, so GET
MUG SHOT. CLOSE FILE and CLOSE CABINET. TAKE CAR KEYS from rack

streets! On the parking lot you find blue sedan. OPEN TRUNK and
