<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
It's the same old story: someone else's mistake has become your
problem. The mad fools - the scientists did it for fun, they must
have. No one wanted massive, mutated, insect-like droids, the ugly
by-products of early biomechanical experiments - not me and certainly
not you. Dumped on the planet Ryxx and left to stagnate and fade
out, the sickening mutations not only survived but thrived. Their
intelligence circuits warped., they are now seeking revenge for
their tortured past. Fears of an all-out attack have forced the
Federation into action! Your mission is simple. Fly to Ryxx, into
the heart of the station the evil beings have made their lair, and
blow the whole thing sky high! Game takes player through six
sections. Two skill levels, choice of craft, choice of music or
soundfx, many special effects and sound/speech effects, password
system for players getting far into the game, and more.
