<P>
On the filling screen simply pop up a file and instead of your name
type in "Let me cheat!" (making sure you include the capital and
exclamation mark). Now instead of pressing return, hit the Reset
button. The number next to the losses columm will now be 1, and
this shows you are in the cheat mode. Now type your name in and you
can get into the game as normal.

<P>
When you reach the map screen, where you choose which battle area to
attack, you are now able to get to any of the squares on the map
simply by holding down the right mouse button while clicking on any
square. In this cheat mode there are two major facilities. If you
press the left [Amiga] key and [W] during a scenario you will
automaticly win the battle, and if you go to the map screen screen
during the game, and select a desination using the mouse, then
pressing the left [Amiga] key followed by the number of the unit you
are playing (1, 2, 3 or 4), that unit will instantly go to the the
destination marked.
