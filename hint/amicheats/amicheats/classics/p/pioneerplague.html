<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
The first Amiga game in HAM mode is a new and exciting space
adventure by Bill Williams. Pioneer Probe Mark IV, the
self-replicating, terraforming, robotic spaceship, has gone out of
control! Its original mission was to find suitable planets for the
human race, but now you must stop the probe before it destroys all
the planets including the Earth. Four monitors, status instruments,
drones and photon missiles guide your way. HAM mode, dazzling
graphics, 4096 colors multi-level design and more.

<H2>CHEATS</H2>

<P>
When you're on a planet, shoot as many rockets as you can. Now when
the rockets are ready to go off, just press 'Q' and you'll be back
on the ship. Then go to the planet. The rockets will still be
there but the rockets will have reset. If you do this on all the
planets, you can't lose. This cheat also works if you are about to
die. Just press 'Q' before you explode. When you go back down
you'll be as good as new.
