<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
3-D racing action. Suspended in air, keep your racer from crashing
into floor, walls, and roof. Strain to hold a flight line against
crushing g-forces and buffeting aerodynamic loads. Push man and
machine to the limit - stretch the flight envelope for the fastest
lap times. Enter the robopits for engine repairs and body part
replacement. Full tune-up facilities. Adjust the airbrakes and
flaps, select the best fuel and filters for each planetary
atmosphere encountered. Tune your typhoon into a winning machine.
When you really cream your machine, the rescue recovery vehicle tows
you back into the pits. Travel to five different planets to race in
different gravities, atmospheres and climates. Perfect your racing
technique on the Oval track before attempting more treacherous
courses. Advanced courses test every skill you posses. Featureless
straight aways plummet into dimly lit caverns. Sweeping bends curve
up towards the sky. Fight for the flag against four aggressive
rivals, each with their own strategies and racing styles. Set up a
datalink between two computers for head-to-head racing action.

<H2>TRACK TIPS</H2>

<DL>
<DT>Oval:
<DD>The secret with this track is to use as much afterburner
as possible, but without blowing up your engines. Keep
your eye on the temperature gauge. This track is fairly
wide, so switch the centering field OFF and pick up
speed. Go around as fast as you can.
<DT>Antacorp:
<DD>A difficult track. Turn the centering field up to
four or five, which will put you in the middle of the
course. When you go through the underground chicane,
hold down the right shift key. This will take you
through the vertical scanner without slowing down; then
straighten.
<DT>Clortek:
<DD>Shortly after the start line, you will encounter a
trench. Don't waste your time flying through it; just
go over it. When you reach the pressure gate, which is
around half way, don't slow down. If you're going to
crash into it then slow down. Hopefully this won't
occur, but in this instance it's no use fighting the
consequences. When you come out of the exit, switch
the afterbunrers on. Go for speed on this next stretch.
<DT>Otyaka:
<DD>It's main section's underground, very dark and at first
quite difficult. The track careers from left to right
so turn the centering on at around level five. Once you
emerge into the open, you'll come across a nasty right
hand hairpin, so hold down the centering key again.
This section takes some practice.
<DT>Banzal:
<DD>So named because it really is the hardest track. Crank
the centering up as much as possible but reduce it down
to six if feasible and necessary. You'll encounter the
same kind of underground dip as on the Otyaka course, so
use the same tactics. If you get through this you are
GOOD.
<DT>Apocalypt:
<DD>This section has an alarmingly tight hairpin situated
three corners from the start. Take it using centring
mode. While underground you will go through a loop de
loop. You get through this using gentle movements of
the mouse, with centring set around six. This should
see you right.
<DT>Estoria:
<DD>Back into sunny climes and a fairly wide track. Bomb
around the course with a low centring setting or none at all.
