<H2>TIPS</H2>

<H3>PART 1</H3>

<P>
First, spell-casters make all the difference. The heavies in the
game can only be destroyed by blasts from the "fireflash" spell.
Spellcasters will last long to progress only if they have high
strength and dexterity ratings: only strong characters can wear the
better armor. At the same time, fighters are of best use if they
have a high intelligence level, and can learn to throw some spells.
Remember this is not a "real time" game -- it's safe for you to
leave the keyboard for a minute without coming back to find that
your party has been wiped out by the Julliard String Quartet.
</P>

<P>
Your primary goal, of course, is to defeat the evil one. To do this
you must search the dungeons in order to obtain five runes titled
earth, air, fire, water and gods. Nine rings must also be
uncovered, one of which can be purchased at a town.
</P>

<P>
It may be a good idea to create a minotaur shortly after the
beginning of the game. There is one important dungeon to which a
party will be denied access unless a minotaur is a member.
Minotaurs are good fighters, but their life span is shorter than
that of other creatures. So it may also be a good idea to wait
until other characters have aged a bit before putting the minotaur
to work.
</P>

<H3>PART 2</H3>

<P>
The first dungeon, just south of Pelnor, contains the air rune. It
can be obtained in a room in the upper left quadrant of the dungeon,
after first opening the gate by throwing a switch located in a
nearby room.
</P>

<P>
South of Pelnor is the second town, Pineville. To the southeast of
this town is the first of three lakes in which your party must swim
in order to receive the water rune. South of the lake is the second
dungeon which is really a chapel. In the middle of the southern
half of the dungeon is the earth rune. The southeast corner
contains a key necessary to get in to see the high priest, who is in
the southwest. He gives you important orders regarding Lord Wood.
</P>

<P>
South of Pineville is town number 3, Greensville. Directly to the
east is the dungeon belonging to the lizard men. Within the
dungeon, in the middle of the northern half, is the fire rune. In
the southeastern quadrant you can find a close relative of Lord
Wood. Ignore the girl and rescue the old man.
</P>

<P>
South of Pineville is a coastline, along which is a dungeon --
really the city of Woodville. Within, halfway down the west side is
the high priest of Gelnor. Enter 79 on his set of buttons (anything
else will end the game real fast). This will allow entrance to the
town's fountains from the south. In the fountain is only a scroll.
</P>

<P>
To the east of Woodville are some islands and an invisible town
which cannot be reached by non-magical means. Travel north to town
number 4, Hobbiton. To the east of Hobbiton is the castle of Lord
Wood. Within the castle, about half way down on the west, is Lord
Wood's room. In a closet is scrawled directions on navigating a
series of trap-door tiles found in the southwest corner. At the end
of these are the instructions for reaching the gods. Along the east
half of the dungeon, also about half way down, is the water rune.
However, this rune can't be obtained until the party has entered all
three magic pools found in Gelnor.
</P>

<P>
Town 5, Appleton, is really just an inn. You can only look around
inside by casting a transport spell from another town. There's
nothing else special about the inn/town, and it's located north of
Woodville City.
</P>

<P>
Traveling east of Hobbiton finds town 6, Splitwater. South of
Splitwater is a dungeon which is the home of J. R. Trolkin. This
is a nasty place to visit because you will be immediately sedated
and locked in prison. Pushing south from inside the prison, you'll
find yourself walking towards an arena. If you push west about two
steps after you enter the southern hall, you will work your way to a
control room (there's one other way to get here). You should push
all three buttons in the control room in order make an escape route
for yourself. South of the arena is J. R. Trolkin's room. Once
you defeat him, most of the fighting in that dungeon is over. South
of Trolkin's room is a closet which contains rings I, II and III
(the important rings are numbered -- if there's no number then it's
not a ring you need to defeat the evil one). If you push west from
Trolkin's room, you'll also find the door control room. Make sure
to push all three buttons if you haven't already done so.
</P>

<H3>PART 3</H3>

<P>
To the east of J. R. Trolkin's home is town 9, Dragonor. North of
Dragonor is town 7, Trollport. Just southeast of Trollport is the
second magic pool in which your party must swim. To get to town 8,
use the transport spell from any other town, and you'll be in
Phantasia. In that town you'll be able to purchase ring IX at the
armory. Outside of Phantasia, in the islands, go to the southwest
and swim until you find the third magic pool. You can then exit the
area by working down towards the southeast of the screen. Once
you've been in all three pools you may then go back to Lord Wood's
home and obtain the water rune, as described above.
</P>

<P>
North of Trollport is town 10, Northford. West of Northford is the
temple of the Desnebian Clerics. You will not be allowed to enter
unless a minotaur is in your party. You must also give the password
REVEN TONEM when asked. In the southeast portion of the dungeon is
the statue of the minotaur god. Deface it to reveal a passage from
that room going south. This leads to the casket room. The second
door on the west contains a key which will unlock a door located
about 1/2 way down the eastern side of the main temple. Beyond this
door, follow the hallway to a second locked door. Go south, make a
slight detour to the west, then continue south and follow the
hallway to some prison cells. Rescue everyone there in all three
cells. You'll earn a scroll, the key to the second door and some
advice. Go back and open that second locked door. Inside are rings
VII and VIII. Pushing north from the northeast corner of the room
is a quick way out of the dungeon.
</P>

<P>
North of Trollport, then east across a lake, is the dungeon of the
bleebs. This nasty race must be ancestors of modern day S.A.T.
question-writers. Visit every room in the dungeon. Enter every
pool except the blue ones. Take note on what each bleeb has to say.
Eventually you'll need to answer a series of questions based on
statements given by the various bleebs. At the first door the
answer is <green>. The answer to the first question beyond is also
<green>. The answer to the second question is <red or green>. The
answer to the final question is <red>.
</P>

<P>
West from the bleeb dungeon is the last town, Starville. From here,
if you have all four runes, all nine rings and a lot of experience
points, pushing 'M' should inform you that it is time for you to
visit the gods.
</P>

<P>
Transport to town 99, Olympia. Leaving Olympia is a depressing
process -- there's simply nothing outside. Move east to the next
screen. Explore the east coast carefully; the river man Charon is
almost directly east of your starting point. With his help you'll
be able to find the home of the gods. In this dungeon you'll be
examined for your experience and your battle power. If you are
approved, you'll be sent after the evil one, with the addition of
the rune of the gods. Transport back to Starville (town 11) from
Olympia and move west until you reach the dungeon of the evil one.
Some swimming is necessary.
</P>

<P>
Make sure you've come well equipped with healing and magic potions.
This dungeon contains several passages which lead south. You want
to enter the second one from the west. At the southern end you'll
be transported to the throne room of the evil one. If you've done
your scroll-work, you'll know that that his wealth is an important
part of his power -- destroy it or be destroyed. You'll be able to
follow him north and get hold of the magic wand. Don't destroy it
-- wave it when you have the option. When you meet the sage, don't
hesitate to continue chasing the evil one. When you reach the evil
one just keep throwing "fireflashes." What is the meaning of your
mysterious reward? Where do you go from your sudden change in
scenery? Did someone say the magic word "sequel?"
