<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
How to defeat the end-of-level guard that looks like a bulldog:
Watch his hand, and when he has moved his finger three times it
means he will reach for his gun - so shoot as quickly as possible.
Next time he will fire at you after moving his fingers five times,
and finally four times. By anticipating all of his quick-draws in
this way, you should always manage to kill him.
