<P>
During play hold down 'S', 'I', 'U', and press 'RIGHT ALT'. There
should be a slight pause and the ghosts will reset to the starting
position. This will give you infinite lives.
</P>

<P>
When the title screen appears, type "AVALON". The screen should
flash. You should have unlimited lives. If that doesn't work, try
the following:
</P>

<P>
Start a two player game. Make it as far as you can with player one.
With player two, you must be able to make it as far as the fairy to
collect your boots. Now that you have gotten your boots, you are
going backwards to where you started. Push the third cactus on the
way back, and a yellow pacman will appear. Get it, now kill player
two. Continue playing with player one. Every time player one dies,
get the yellow pacman with player two and kill player two
immediately. As long as you keep getting the yellow pacman with
player two, player one will never die.

<H2>HINTS</H2>

<DL>
<DT>LEVEL 1
<DD>Run to the third fire hydrant, and when you get there, jump over
it and push it to the left. This will give you a blue hat that will
make you invulnerable to the little ghosts that fall from planes.
<DT>LEVEL 2
<DD>Run to the third cactus, and push it to the left. You will now
be invulnerable for the entire level!
<DT>LEVEL 3
<DD>After getting your magic boots, push the third cactus, on the
way back, for a free life.
</DL>

<UL>
<LI>Jump on the roof of ghost's car to escape.
<LI>Only use powerpills when ghosts are in range, or else it is wasted.
<LI>When you reach the breaktime sign, jump when you are about 1 inch
away, for a bonus (depending how high you are when the level ends)
