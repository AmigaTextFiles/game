<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
PowerMonger takes you to a living world where each individual has a
home, an occupation, and a level of intelligence - all must be
accounted for in your strategy. PowerMonger casts you as the leader
of a displaced tribe newly arrived in an unchartered territory.
There are 200 territories to conquer before the world is yours. To
unite the land under your rule, you must win the allegiance of the
people by force, negotiation, or outright bribery.
</P>

<H2>CHEATS</H2>

<P>
Instruct your captain to invent something, pause the game, put the
game speed up to full, and wait a couple of minutes. Now unpause
the game, the captain will have kept inventing during the pause!
</P>

<P>
When you wish to invent in double quick time, click invent and
when your men leave, click on it again. This often makes a
catapult almost immediately, but this cheat only works once on
each island.
</P>

<H2>FUN</H2>

<P>
In winter, take a lone captain to the north of the map. Leave him
there, but keep an eye on him, because he'll start shearing
a sheep. Then, he eats it.
