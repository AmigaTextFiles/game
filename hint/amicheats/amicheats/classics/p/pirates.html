<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>

the thick of the action on the Spanish Main. Challenge your reflexes
with simulated sailing, sea and land battles, and swordfights.
Experience romance and intrigue from more than 50 foreign ports.
</P>

<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
When choosing nationality, choose english if it's your first game,
the others are harder (in the sequence French, Dutch, Spanish) but
in different historical periods each has it's own advantages and
disadvantages. As for difficulty levels, the more loot you get and
the less help from your crew, i think that the governors, Pirate
hunters and different nationalities have better memories, but dont
quote me on this. At the start of the game, when choosing skill
it's a toss up between Wit and Charm or Medicine. With Wit And
Charm you can charm the Governors daughters, but this only works if
you see them regualary, no use if you are at the other end of the
map. Medicine will Give you one last trip around the Spanish main.
</P>

<P>
I always choose Port royale to start from (if you choose English as
your Nationality You are nearly always at war with Spain, and
there's Santiago and Puerto principle to start off with, but the
choice is yours.) Have patience on your first voyage you will
sometimes get your boat blown to smithereens when approaching an
enemy city by sea, or lose most of your men in a land battle. More
of the tactics for those situations later. With no experience you
will lose land or sea battles due to having too few men, but with no
experience (reputation) you cannot get enough men to help you.
Joseph Heller anyone(Catch 22).
</P>

<P>
When fighting against unbelievable odds dont panic. Choose the long
sword. Keep using the slash-high attack to cause the most dammage.
You may get down to only one man left, but you can still defeat the
enemy captain. After you win, select send a prize crew so you will
have enough people to sail your ship.
</P>

<P>
Don't attack a nation your home country is allied with, it will
upset both of them.
</P>

<P>
The best way to deal with Sea battles i have found is as follows:
When sighted by a boat dont automatically sail away if in friendly
waters or close for battle in enemy waters, chances are you'll make
the wrong choice and undo a great deal of work for nothing, so take
your time and choose wisely.
</P>

<P>
If you sail out of your first port, hope you meet a pirate hunter.
IS HE MAD. No. Because if you win the battle you might get the
enemy's crew to join your's, thereby increasing your chances in
subsequent battles, and boosting your reputation. The best way to
deal with enemy craft in battles,is to, if close, raise sails and go
in close (by close i mean about 1-4 boat lenghths away.)
</P>

<P>
Dont forget the mood of your crew (which goes from Happy, Pleased,
Unhappy, Angry) can have a bearing on the crews cannon loading in
battles. If you cant get to the boat and want it for you're fleet
try and disable it with you're cannons, remembering to use battle
sails first, try and realise that you cannot fire straight at the
boat,your shots will miss if you try and shoot at the ship, aim a
little bit in front and that should work. Also if you let a pirate
boat go sometimes if you have a large fleet your tail end boat may
be captured, so watch out.
</P>

<P>
Choose a longsword for battles, good reach and damage. When
swordfighting see what the mood of your crew is, strong go in for
the kill, shaken go with CAUTION. The fight itself is different
matter. I Normally stick to slashes, the higher the rank the faster
they attack (and so will you) but its more tricky, much more. The
only thing i can say here is to practice, there is a pattern to the
attacks from you're opponent so take heart. When you've won the
battle you can take the ship or abandon it.
</P>

<P>
Take my advice, dont put all you're gold in one ship. Plunder
anything above a sloop, have 3-4 sloops, and go around the Spanish
main in these. I've found that if you have on big ship (above a
sloop) it's harder to steer, and fatal to go across reefs. Take
what you need from a ship, food is especially handy, if you have a
big crew and whatever else. Dont take something, just because
you'll get 10 gold more per item, when you're sacking 6 enemies
citys, it wont matter, you'll only get 1000-2000 more gold pieces.
The best size crew i have to go looting is about 225, so stick to
that. At the end when of a trip when dividing up the plunder have
as few crew as possible, the more crew you have the less money each
one will get and think less of you next time.
</P>

<P>
Attacking enemies ports can be tricky so here goes. Always try to
attack anywhere apart from the west side, it will turn out to be a
slow boat to leogane, cartagena, etc,etc. If the winds are light turn
back and try again. Indian attacks will reduce the number of soldiers
and nothing else, pirates take the towns gold and damages the
economy, malaria cuts down the number of troops in the fort and will
slow or even stop the economy, and gold mines turn a poor town into a
rich one fairly quickly. If you land near to the city (3 boat lengths
away or more) you might take all of the citys gold, or you might
not.
</P>

<P>
In land battles try and have more than the fort, then you'll go
straight to the fight with the fort's commander. If you dont have
enough troops then hide one of of your parties in bushes and lure
the forts troops away and past you're hidden party, then take the
luring troops off the screen and take the hidden ones to to fort.
It is important that you take the flag on the fort to enter it, if
it doesnt work try again, it will. If you reduce a city to 1 person
left when swordfighting, chances are you'll be able to see off the
old inhabitants and insatll a new nationality, this will do no harm
when you come to visit a governor for services to your crown (king).
</P>

<P>
Don't wed till you've got all your promotions, your oppurtunities
will be much better. Make conversation with all the governors
daughters, however, they might gather important information for
you from the governors mansion.
</P>

<P>
In port always visit the governor, no not for his daughter. Just in
case he wants you to do an errand. These are up to
you, sometimes there near sometimes they're not and can make you miss
a treasure fleet or such, so you decide, and save if you must. Propose
to the governors daughter only when you're rich and famous or should
that be, anyway if you dont prepare to be humiliated and have cheeks
the the same colour of the young ladys dress.
</P>

<P>
If playing at higher levels buy information about other cities,
because if you check when you first start a game the cities list
will be sparse. The old man who offers you a map must be quick on
his feet, because if you decide to buy it, 3 quarters is missing,
another saving oppurtunity methinks. Also if you've done you're
share of looting and feel that you might be promoted divide up the
plunder first, plan another expedition and then go to see the
governor, that way you'll get to know the whereabouts of some cad
who's got a map to one of you're family. On this point i can only
say to memorize the coastline, isles, and anything else, or you
could save the game find one of you're family and restart. After
you've found one of you're family they'll give you another map and
after you've calmed down you can go and track this down (believe me
its worth the effort, worth 4-5 rich cities effort). The family
you'll find is, Sister, Father, Mother, Uncle. If you do try to
sneak into an enemy port you might get seen by a guard, or not
served by a Spanish shopkeeper it depends on how rich the city is
(Struggling, Surviving, Prosperous, Wealthy) so keep an eye on your
crews stomachs, thats how much food you've got letf and be on the
lookout for a friendly port.
</P>

<P>
All the ships handle differently,some more slower than others. Some
steer better to 12 o'Clock and some to 9 o'Clock. Dont think that
smaller is quicker, could larger be faster?
