<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
Make it a habit to jump on the Pups heads to squash them, then punch
their helmets to gain an extra star. A fast-moving helmet,
incidentally, acts as a very effective weapon against land based
enemies.
</P>

<P>
When you're using the Putty Pod, it's always a good idea to take a
look around and get to know the level you're on. It is particularly
useful to search for those hard-to-find MIA Putties.
</P>

<P>
If you are very low on stars, try using the Putty Pod to find stars
that Putty can't otherwise reach, such as stars that are way into
the sky.
</P>

<P>
Before picking up the Putty Pod, try to always have the Nitro first.
This means that you can drop Nitro bombs on all sorts of enemies and
sandbag fortresses. Hint - If you bomb as many of the MIA Putty
Prisons as possible, it will make them easier to pick up.
</P>

<P>
When you bust open a crate, try not to eat all the food which pops
out - as long as you don't need it right away, that is. The food
will remain there, just in case you need that extra bit of
pliability later. If you are low on pliability, and you see Napalm,
try punching his backpack to get extra food. Remember - this can
only be done once per level, so don't waste the opportunity.
</P>

<P>
Dweezil is an important character for Putty to have around. By
punching him he will lie down and let Putty bounce on his stomach,
enabling Putty to reach any higher platforms. Make sure you pick up
the cat food again, once Dweezil has gone.
</P>

<P>
When there's a sandbag surrounding an MIA, and Putty hasn't got a
Nitro, call Dweezil. Let him kick Putty, and he will drop a Dweezil
bomb for you to use. Putty can pick it up in the same way as a
Nitro. Remember - Dweezil bombs have a short fuse.
</P>

<P>
Stretching also helps Putty get stars which are in hard-to-reach
places. Try to use your stretch as much as possible, because it
enables Putty to move up and down ladders and platforms much faster
than jumping.
</P>

<P>
Try using the melt function if Putty is being attacked. He will not
be hurt by bombs or enemy attacks this way.
</P>

<P>
Keep a sharp lookout for the astronaut '1UP' character. He flies
above Putty if he is being awarded an extra life, and Putty must
punch him to get it.
</P>

<P>
Having problems with a level? Take it slowly, then - because
remember, you're not playing against the clock. Try knocking the
bad guys out first before picking up the MIA Putties.
</P>

<P>
If you're lucky enough to find a chilly icon, then clear as many of
the enemy from the level as possible while Putty is flashing.
</P>

<P>
Should you see a star block, jump up and hit it from underneath.
Or, use your stretch from above to get a secret item.
</P>

<P>
Don't forget about Secret Agent Trevor. Pick up the dustbin icon,
and he'll sneak a useful item into the warzone.
</P>

<P>
When Putty is on a secret level, make sure that he absorbs all the
surrendering Pups. Each one gives Putty a bonus of 5 stars.
</P>

<P>
Try to kill the bazooka pups while they are parachuting from the
helicopter. Try not to let them build up, or you could suddenly
find a platoon of them shooting at you.
