<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
In Pro Tennis Tour, you are a professional tennis player, ranked
64th in the world. Your objective is to improve your ranking by
participating in major championships such as the Australian Open,
French Open at Roland Garros, U.S. Open, and Wimbledon. Each
championship event is played on its unique surface, whether it's
grass, clay or cement. Pro Tennis Tour has six training programs
where you can play either an opponent or against the computer. The
on-screen scoring display, realistic sound effects, and two-player
option give Pro Tennis Tour the look and feel of an actual tennis
game. Improve your service, master your tennis strokes, and enjoy the
3-D instant replay feature of your best shots.

<P>
Climbing the world tennis rankings! Play the first set; when the
score screen appears, press the fire button, then ESC. The screen
will then declare "Game, Set and Match" to your opponent. Even so,
you'll find your ranking has just dropped from 64 to around 54.
Repeat the process until you find an opponent you can beat!
