<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Pit your pipefitting prowess against a surging sea of sewage. Your
objective is to build the longest possible continuous pipeline,
racing against a stream of chemical fluid called Flooz. Piece
together the pipeline from various shapes of pipe, which appear in a
random order. There are thirty-six increasingly challenging levels.
Play solo, against a friend or team up in a joint battle against the
computer. But if you slow down for a second, it's Sludge City!
