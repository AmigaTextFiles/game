<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
On the final level where you confront Drax, walk forward, and when
the first fireball comes, jump, then do a forward roll into him. If
you can't even get that far then the best way to defeat an oppoent
is to roll into him until he reaches the side, then kick him, roll
in to him again and kick him, keep repeating this method and you'll
soon finish the game.
