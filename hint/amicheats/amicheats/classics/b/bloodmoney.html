<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Swap from submarine to helicopter to jet pack in your fight against
the monstrous creatures and alien weapons assaulting you from all
angles. Balance your budget throughout each of the four alien safari
missions. And buying extra weapons isn't just a frill, it's a
matter of life and death.
</P>

<H2>CHEATS</H2>

<P>
Press 'HELP' and then '1' or '2' and you will restock your supply
of lives or money, respectively.
</P>

<H2>SOLVE</H2>

<H3>LEVEL 1</H3>

<P>
Your choice of weapons can make all the difference between
completing the level with ease and scraping through with less lives
than you'd really like.  Front up and down lasers are the first on
the agenda and are probably the most useful, and combined long-range
bullets they come in very handy.  Backwards lasers are not
recommended however, although they will take out any enemies that
surprise you from behind, you should be ready for them and be
prepared to blow them away:  also, backwards lasers limit your
firepower.  If you are firing at aliens coming from the right- hand
side of the screen and have closed in to dispose of them, after
firing about five bullets you then have a gap where you then have a
gap where you have to wait for your rear bullets to leave the
screen.  Do not equip your craft with bombs.  These are very arkward
on level one because of the number of rotating barriers you have to
shoot into the right position.  You often have to come in close to
do so, but if you get too close the bombs accidentally hit the
barriers, putting them in the wrong position again.  Speed is
helpful but you need to be more careful with the manoeuvring.
</P>

<H3>LEVEL 1 - ENEMIES</H3>

<P>
Robot walkers are one of the first to make an entrance; shoot these
adversaries in the head a few times and then scoop up the reward -
they are worth quite a bit.  Gun turrets are the most common
nuisance and are dotted all around the planet terrain.  Although
they are easy to kill, these weapons are probably the most deadly.
Control towers are often the cause of death if not expected, because
they reverse your joystick movements, but only a couple of shots are
needed to destroy them.  Alien pirates sometimes appear on the scene
and can be quite annoying.  Although they don't kill you they steal
your money all the time they make contact.  Remember 250 credits is
equivalent to a life, but don't get yourself into a bad position
over them, it's better to loose your money than a life, and weapons.
barriers are spread widely through level one and require two tasks.
One is basically just shoot them out of the way, and two is to shoot
them until they rotate into the right position; some are unaffected
by anything and just hamper your progress.  Also contained within
the landscape are opening and closing gates; just dive through these
to pass - good timing is needed to survive.  Many other aliens
appear on this level, but all just take a couple of shots to kill.
Remember to collect as much money as possible but don't take
chances.
</P>

<H3>THE MOTHERSHIP</H3>

<P>
At the end of level one you will encounter the enemy's mothership
and to leave the planet with your plunder this opposition will have
to be killed.  The mothership's weak spot is the centre of the ship
and requires you to shoot it from the front, between the guns.  Stay
level with the mothership and when she fires at you, just simply fly
between the two bullets blasting away non-stop, it's just a matter
of time before she goes down.
</P>

<H3>LEVEL 2</H3>

<P>
The water level.  Guide your submarine through this underground
domain, avoiding the selection of marine life that assails you.  As
far as weapons go in this level, everything is recommended, except
for backwards fire for the reason mentioned in level one.  However,
bombs are most necessary and at least one is needed if you are to
complete the level without losing a life.
</P>

<H3>LEVEL 2 - MEANIES</H3>

<P>
Eels hide out in the various crevices within the rocky surroundings,
and perform the same task as the gun turrets of level one; giant
claws lurch forward from the passing scenery from time to time but
can easily be dodged, although they can't be killed; bumping into
fleets of armoured submarines are a touch annoying, and if you're
not careful some problems could arise, but if all goes well a
fortune can be collected for your bank account; floating mines have
been left bobbing within your path and they will need to be
detonated to make the going easier, but your trouble is not in vain,
each mine is worth 10 credits; rock walls mar your journey here and
there and just need to be blown to bits or or pushed out of the way
by an array of bullets to continue:  as before, pirates and other
sundry aliens appear in this level but require the same task as
previous levels to dispose of them.
</P>

<H3>CONGER EELS</H3>

<P>
Once again you must vanquish an end-of-level guardian before you can
continue any further into the game.  However, there is not just one
but three monsters to overcome, each one is in the form of a fire
breathing conger eel.  The first to come forth from it's lair is the
blue eel; to defeat this evil foe you must repeatedly shoot him in
the head.  Once destroyed, it is not long before his green brother
emerges from his hole.  The red eel is the final obstruction and he
is killed in the same manner as the previous two.
</P>

<H3>LEVEL 3</H3>

<P>
The ice planet.  Leaving your hi-tech space craft behind, you
venture into the unknown arctic tundra in your spacesuit, hopefully
equipped with some of the weapons you escaped with from the last
level.  More accuracy will be needed in this level that it's
predecessors, with icicles adorning most of the ceilings and floors
giving you less space to move about in.  Active volcanoes spit out
red-hot volcanic lava into your path making life less than easy in
the later stages of the level.
</P>

<H3>LEVEL 3 - NASTIES</H3>

<P>
Once again attached to most walls in regular intervals are the gun
turrets, and they act in the same way as before;protruding spikes
move vertically up and down the screen in some places and on some
occasions, and if not expected you will find yourself in a very bad
position; arctic seas will be encountered in the latter stages of
the planet, but although they look peaceful enough they harbour a
host of various enemies.  Missiles will be the first deterrent to be
launched at you and once you think the worst of it is over, gigantic
sea serpents will raise their ugly heads and try to snatch you from
the very skies that you fly in.  Unfortunately these serpents seem
impervious to any firepower launched at them.
</P>

<H3>THE ALIEN HEAD</H3>

<P>
Just when you thought the worst of it was over, a huge head will
enter from the right of the screen to attack you.  Straight away you
will notice ten lumps on the back of the alien; these will need to
be shot until they explode.  As soon as this has been achieved you
can then concentrate all of your firepower on the alien's mouth.
But beware!  During your struggle with the alien he will shower you
with bullets that come from an antenna that is projected from his
mouth.
</P>

<H3>LEVEL 4</H3>

<P>
The last and most deadly planet.  Here all your surroundings are
made of fire and any contact with the flames will deplete your
shields.  The main problems this planet presents are fireballs which
fly through the air in horizontal and vertical movements requiring
your best flying to avoid them.  All enemies on this level are just
basically incarnations of adversaries from the previous levels and
need no description of how to kill them, the only significant
difference being the formation that one particular alien comes in; a
whole row coming from both left and right of the screen and then
from above and below.  Also be careful of the eyes in the scenery as
they're not all harmless.  As before, the more equipment you can get
for your ship the better.
</P>

<H3>THE LAST GUARDIAN</H3>

<P>
At last you have stumbled your way to this final point in the game
and, as expected there is an end-of-level-guardian waiting to trip
you up, but this time his firepower almost equals that of yours (if
you have any extras, that is).  Six holes in the creature pump out
bullets in a steady stream and each hole must be destroyed before
the final assault is made.  Hopefully, you will have little problems
killing this final obstruction and you will soon be savouring seeing
the ending sequence - but was it worth it?
