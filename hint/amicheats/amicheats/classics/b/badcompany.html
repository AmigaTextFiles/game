<P>
During play, type "TIGER" now press 'F5' for infinite energy. Some
of the other function keys do stuff, but nothing that will help you.
Pressing 'TAB' or 'ENTER' (numeric keypad) seems to lock up the
game. If you accidentally hit either of those two keys, hold down
the left mouse button and press 'F1'. This will end the game and
bring you back to the title screen (atleast you won't have to
reboot).
