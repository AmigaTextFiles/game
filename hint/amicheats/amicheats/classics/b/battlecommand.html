<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
An arcade strategy game where the North/South divide is a
life-threatening issue, the Ultra War. Ten years on, the latest
phase of this siege has culminated in a World War I situation
arising, and a stand-off between armies massed over a long dug-in
battle front. You must succeed where other elite troops have failed,
and strike a blow for freedom against the oppressive Southern
Forces. Brains and priceless military hardware are your only
protection. Over 15 missions, four Weapon Pods to stockpile with
lethal devices, and a detailed manual included.

While you are playing, type in "CASTOR". The screen will flash green
and you will be invincible. You can also change your weapons by
pressing 'F6', 'F7', 'F8', 'F9', or 'F10' and you can change to
power of your selected weapon by pressing 'F1', 'F2', 'F3', 'F4',
or 'F5'.
