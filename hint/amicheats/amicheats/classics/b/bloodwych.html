<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
When you are being attacked by a monster that you think may be too
tough for your team, get the other player to lock their team behind
a wooden partition. Then you lure the monster past the section of
the partition that hides your accomplice. That player then
communicated with the monster with the monster through the partition
(make sure that they are facing it). They then keep clicking on
`COMMUNICATE AND RECRUIT' (this is better done using an autofire
joystick). You then hack the living daylights out of the monster
while your accomplice carries on hacking the living daylights out of
the `COMMUNICATE' option. This works with Zendik and the Entropy as
well as every other creature in the castle.
</P>

<P>
If you're patient enough, then a good way of starting is to recruit
your way through all of the Bloodwych characters taking their
belongings, then dismissing them. You can now sell all the weapons
you don't want, to end up with about 200 coinage. You will also
have a plentiful supply of food and keys, so remember to have only
one character carrying the keys to save on backpack space.
</P>

<P>
Usually, the best combination of characters is to have two fighters
at the front and two wizards at the back. It's difficult to say
which colours are the best, since they all have spells which come in
useful fairly often. The yellow Vivify spell is probably the best,
but red spells such as Vitalise, Fireball and Firebath tend to be
the most frequently used. Note that the first time you use the
Vivify spell, you will need about 70 or 80 spell points if the
character casting the spell isn't yellow.
</P>

<P>
Any items you come across can be sold to any creature, so long as
they're not one of the characters you robbed at the beginning of the
game. You can quite easily reach and maintain the maximum of 99
coinage this way.
</P>

<P>
As far as fighting goes, make sure you don't get trapped while using
the `hack and step back' method, only to realise that you haven't
saved the game for some time. Occasionally it is possible to worm
your way out of this situation by using the Confuse and Terror
spells and talking to the creature. Keep boasting to it about how
great you are and then threaten it. Every now and then the creature
will turn and run, but unfortunately this is quite rare.
</P>

<P> 
A tip which is used by quite a large number of Bloodwych players is
the old `hiding behind the door, technique'. Stand to one side of a
wooden door with a creature on the other side and keep clicking on
the fight icon until the creature opens the door. Sometimes it is
possible to get a hit in from both of your front characters and
close the door before the creature hits you. If the creature then
opens the door straight away, you don't need to click on the fight
icon again. If, however, there is a delay, then you'll probably
have to keep hitting it. If you're worried that one of your
characters is going to die, then lock the door using Magelock, as
it's quite easy to make the mistake of locking the door open if you
use a key. With the door locked you can give your characters a
rest, allowing them to recuperate and be ready for the next fight.
