<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
The truest simulation of FRP. From its novel-like plot to its
calculated die rolls, Bane fo the Cosmic Forge offers uncompromising
variety: 11 cars, 14 professions, weaponry, physical and academic
skills, a researched armament 400 items strong, six spellbooks, and
462 spell combinations. Full-screen animated graphics and digitized
sound intensify the gaming experience.

<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
The password to enter the door in the SE tower of the 1st level is
"SNOOPCHERI". Use the rotten cheese on the mousehole. Some small
help for playing the game successfully: When you create your
characters, it may be a good idea just to make all of them Dracons.
</P>

<P>
This is untested, but unless you have at least one of this fire
breathing race you surely wont survive the game. So maybe it would
be good to have more. Use a good mix of the classes, try to take
one of each spell class and a good solid thief that is at full
strength. Get a good enough thief and you dont need a fighter. It
may be slow, but keep rolling till you get the best character
possible. Be sure to make at least one character female, there are
places in the game where this is a must. Don't do it and be sorry
later! Diversify your skills.
</P>

<P>
Have each character specialise in a few skills relative to his
class. Do not worry about developing weapons skills, you have no
use for them if you created your party correctly. In fights early
in the game use DRACONS BREATH ATTACK, just be careful not to over
extend yourself. Rest after each encounter, backing up your hard
work. Always search the area after a combat. Search each square
you step in. Not only this, but search facing all four directions,
many things can only be found that way. Thieves are not always
true. If you find a lock and have your thief open it, allways
guess it is poison unless you are 100% sure (I.E. tried it before)
because it is better to suffer something else than to die by
getting this wrong. Don't bash doors early in the game! If your
characters are not very strong you will be sorry. Jammed doors do
you no good, as you might never be able to open them again. Same
goes for picking the lock. Wait till you get a caster capable of
conjuring knock knock with at least 18 points (prefereably 24) and
do it this way. It is much more sure. Once you know there are
secret panels or buttons, keep walking past them until you
discover them. You can find them by looking at the maps and know
where they are, sometimes it takes awhile to sense them.
