<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
For two years your people have struggled against invading forces.
With your army reduced to a handful and your artillery depleted,
further resistance seems impossible. But in a hidden underground
laboratory, a team of scientists has at last perfected a new kind of
fighting machine: a bionic arm that extends and contracts, providing
unheard of strength and maneuverability. Combined with a arsenal of
rapid-fire, armour-piercing, and heat-seeking weaponry, this will
put the power of an entire army in the hands of one man... one
carefully chosen soldier, who has what it takes to become a new
breed of unstopppable commando... a Bionic Commando. You are that
soldier.
</P>

<P>
Exit level 1 exactly when the timer reads 1, for 9 extra lives and
high score.
