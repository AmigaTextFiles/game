<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
In a world essentially composed of islands, you are Chief of State
and have complete control over the armed forces. Your goal is to
attack the islands and capture the most terrain possible. To carry
out your mission, you have at your disposal a port, an arsenal, an
airport, train stations, factories, an army, a navy, and an air
force. Each one of these forces is mobile and can accomplish the
strategies of your creation. Careful, you must take into
consideration the variables of the terrain: coral reefs, the height
of the mountains, etc. While defending your strategic points and
energy supplies, transport units and repair warehouses; demolish
those of your enemy and render him helpless. Show no mercy! The time
for confrontation has arrived!

<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
It has eluded most players on how to play against the computer. I'm
sure it is buried somewhere in the long documentation file. The
game defaults to a two player mode. Select options with the mouse
to get to the options screen. Click on the word "first". That is
the first level of the two player codes. Type in 'conra' or code
for any other game level that you wish to play. Then select exit to
play the game.
