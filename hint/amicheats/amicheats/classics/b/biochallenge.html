<H2>TIPS</H2>

<DL>
<DT>LEVEL 1:
<DD>Get the green armous as soon as possible. If you have all
of the amulet, don't go to the sphere unless you have
collected at least four lots of monster remains, you'll
need them to battle the end of level guardian. He's a
bit soft in the head, so time your jumps carefully, and
hit him there.
<DT>LEVEL 2:
<DD>There are four planets to visit, go to everyone if you
want to get maximum points. Again, the green armour is
very useful, so get it as quickly as possible. There's
loads of ammo for the guardian of this level,
unfortunetly that means there's loads of monsters to deal
with. The back of the guardians head is the weak spot.
<DT>LEVEL 3:
<DD>Stand on the slabs and summersault. There are six
planets here, and the transporters are more difficult to
so, so you have to watch more carefully.
