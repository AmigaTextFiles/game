<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
One and two player modes, vertical and horizontal scrolling, and
chameleon enemies who become almost invisible as they mimic the
background terrain. Battle Squadron delivers a unique, 3D
futuristic gaming experience. Earth's forces in 2400 A.D. have
traveled through space to retaliate against a devastating Barrax
Empire attack. You're in command of an Earth space cruiser, dodging
and darting across alien terrain, facing dozens of whirling air
enemies, and challenging intense fire from ground emplacements.
