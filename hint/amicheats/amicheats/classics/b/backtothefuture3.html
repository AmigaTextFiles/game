<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Back to the Future III offers progressively difficult action set in
the Old West. Each level is inspired by famous scenes from the
movie, so you may have the edge if you've seen it. As players assume
the roles of Marty McFly and Doc Brown at various stages of the
game, it's up to them to return everyone safely to their own time.
But Buford 'Mad Dog' Tannen isn't going to make it easy. Gamers
encounter a buckboard chase, shooting gallery, pie throwers, and a
harrowing train chase. Players assume the role of Marty and must
balance their way along the top of a speeding train collecting speed
logs and avoiding Buford's gang.
