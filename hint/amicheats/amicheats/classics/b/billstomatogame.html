<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
What a pair of Tomatos, Terry and Tracy are two of the hottest
tomatos in the patch. Freshly picked and off to be canned they
escape to pursue their dream of marriage and little cherry tomatos.
But as luck would have it, an evil squirrel has foiled their plan,
capturing Tracy and stashing her high atop his vine-top home. Can
love conquer all? It's up to you and Terry to save the fair Tracy,
solve challenging puzzles and brave the many dangers that lie ahead.
