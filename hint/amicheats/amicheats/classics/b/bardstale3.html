<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Someone or something has sealed the city's fate with an evil so vast
that a host of Paladins and an army of Archmages are outmatched.
Hard times call for subtlety. Smaller is better. Sneakier is best.
What the world needs now is a thief. A compelling role-playing
adventure with over 13 character classes and 80 dungeon levels.
</P>

<H2>FUN</H2>

<P>
For a bit of fun tell the guard at the mad gods temple "HAMBURGER".

<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
You will need a wineskin or canteen to get past Valerian's tower.
Learn the Gill spell from the fisherman then go to the lake behind
his hut, go in to the lake to get to the Crystal Palace, then find
the room with the Elixir of Life in it. Put water on the acorn by
the tower, then a tree will grow, lifting the stone slab and
providing you with a means of getting the Nightlance.
