<H2>SOLVE</H2>

<H3>LEVEL 1</H3>

<P>
LEFT, LEFT, RIGHT 7 TIMES, LEFT, RIGHT, LEFT, IN CAVE, AND RIGHT.
</P>

<P>
Repeated use of the heap chop is the most effective tactic against
the neanderthal man, but make sure you take a step back between
hits. Stay low to survive against the Sauron beast - if you don't
you'll lose your head. Chopping is the best tactic here, but step
back between each strike, Use the low chop against the Mutant
chicken, but wait until it's standing up right before you let loose.

<H3>LEVEL 2</H3>

<P>
RIGHT, UP, LEFT, UP, LEFT, LEFT, RIGHT, LEFT 3 TIMES, UP, AND LEFT.
</P>

<P>
The orc pushes you against the wall. Use repeated head chops to
kill him. Counter his stabbing manoevre with a low chop. When the
crab comes near, kick at it and then low chop it. If you miss take
a step back and try again. Carnivores are killed with the chop,
except when they leap at you - then a high chop is needed. The
stinger can only be killed by repeated high chopping - everything
else is useless.
</P>

<H3>LEVEL 3</H3>

<P>
UP, RIGHT, RIGHT, UP, LEFT, RIGHT, UP, RIGHT, LEFT, LEFT, UP, LEFT,
LEFT, UP, UP, RIGHT, RIGHT, LEFT, LEFT, AND UP.
</P>

<P>
Escape the grabbing tentacle by leaping the pit as it withdraws.
Floating eyes can only be killed with a high chop - every other move
has no effect. The Dungeon Master is the toughest creature of all.
If he punches at you, low chop him and if he kicks use the high
chop. When he is approaching, try a flying neck chop - that'll kill
him in one go.
</P>

<H3>LEVEL 4</H3>

<P>
Hit the fireballs, then try to leap across. Several low chops will
destroy it.
</P>

<P>
The first monster may seem formidable but he is really easily dealt
with. Just turn around and walk backwards into it, so you can push
your way onto the next screen. This manoevre costs you energy but
not as much as you would have lost fighting the beast head on.
</P>

<P>
The great demon is next. Begin this bout with a flying neck chop
and follow it up with a low chop. If you miss first them, retreat
quickly to get out of his range and repeat.
</P>

<P>
In a similar fashion to the orgianal Barbarian game, the final
confrontation is with Drax himself. The place to stand is directly
in front of the hanging corpse on the wall. From here you're in a
perfect position to execute a flying neck chop - the only move that
will finish the job.
</P>

<P>
When he reaches out, use an overhead chop to hit his arms; repeat
until death. Next, Drax himself! Wait until he pauses between
spells, and hit him with a flying head chop! The End...
