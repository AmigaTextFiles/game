<H2>SOLVE</H2>

<P>
Gather some ingredients together and make the Heal and Water spells.
Visit the West Wizard and trade the ingredients for the Travele
spell, and trade again for the Aulet of the Moon. Make the Travele
spell. Collect the key located near the Swamp Wizard's Tower. Go
to Ginit's Amulet, take the key, kill the skeleton guards, and take
the Amulet.
</P>

<P>
Go and see the Swamp Wizard and trade the Amulet for a Tablet
Fragment. Collect the Silver Ring from the South Wizard level,
killing the skeleton guards and grabbing the Ring as you go. Now
visit the South Wizard and trade the ingredients for a Stone Flute
(Compiler: Ideal for playing Rock Music with! Ha!Ha!) Go to the
North East top corner of the map and get the Veritas leaf. Visit
the Pine Wizard. Gather together enough ingredients for another
Stone Flute. Trade the Veritas leaf for The Name. Trade the 'Air'
ingredients with the West Wizard for the Smoke and Earth spells.
</P>

<P>
Journey to the top of the map and find the beehive. Here, cast the
Smoke spell and attack the hive. Now collect the Crystal. Go to
the West Wizard and exchange the Crystal for a Tablet Fragment. Now
go to the North Wizard and trade one of the Stone Flutes for the
Helmet, and the Talisman of the Moon for a Tablet Fragment.
</P>

<P>
Go to the East Wizard. Trade the Helmet for the Travele Spell (you
already have this but the Wizard must have the helmet). Then trade
the Name for a Tablet Fragment. There are a number of Flying
Banshees on the East Wizards tower level. When you are attacked by
one, immediately cast Earth at it, and follow it, continually
casting Earth at it until it is dead. Collect the Banshee wail -
cast Earth six more times.
</P>

<P>
Visit the Palace Wizard next. You can trade the Banshee Wail for
another Tablet Fragment. Go to the path that the Sorcerer's tower
is on (the red tower on the map). Locate and take the Swamp Fish
sparkle. Trade the sparkle for a Tablet Fragment with the Pine
Wizard. Go to the South Wizard and trade in the Crystal. Visit the
Sorcerer and he will charge your sword for you. Find Murk and kill
the beast with your newly charged sword. Well Done!
