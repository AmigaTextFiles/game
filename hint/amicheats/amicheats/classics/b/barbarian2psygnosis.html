<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Barbarian II brings Hegor the Barbarian into the '90s. Hegor must
fight his way through the dark forest near the village of Thelson.
Then he has to proceed through the barbaric landscape dodging deadly
traps and dealing with dastardly enemies before entering the final
conflict with Necron, deep within the evil Temple sanctuary. Your
mission is to find and destroy Necron before he completely destroys
the land and overruns the human race.

<P>
Hold down the 'HELP', 'M', and 'E' keys to replenish your energy. 
If you have an 'AMIGA ACTION REPLAY II' hold down the keys and
press the replay button (while your holding the keys). Then let up
on the keys now use 'X' to go back to the game. The computer still
thinks the keys are being pressed (the game crashes if you use the
ACTION REPLAY III).
