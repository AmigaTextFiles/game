<P>
On the title screen, (where the family is watching the TV
together) type "COWABUNGA" for unlimited lives.
</P>

<P>
Type "EAT MY SHORTS" you can now skip levels with the number keys or
the 'F' key.
</P>

<P>
Try typing "SHEEP IN A GROUP WEARING HATS" at some point for
infinite lives.
</P>

<P>
When you have the whistle, stand by the last window of the
Springfield Retirement Home and blow it. Now a guy should appear
and start throwing lots of money at you, so grab it and go on a
shopping spree!
