<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
It's two exciting games in one. Now you can thwart the Penguin or the
Joker and crack the word's most baffling crimes as Batman the Caped
Crusader. First a flock of web-footed warriors, then a barrage of
bomb-throwing buffoons. This could only be the diabolical doing of
you-know-who... an umbrella factory? Robotic penguins? Looks like
the infamous jailbird's out again on another felonious fling! Can
you locate the Penguin's master computer? Clip his wings and pull
the plug on his squawking thugs. Quik to the utility screen!
Batarangs! Batgrenades! And a banana, for boosted crime-fighting
energy. A booby trapped funhouse? A circus of clones? The crown
prince of crime is about to deal his most heinous hand ever! Can you
rescue the imperiled Robin? Dethrone the Joker and defuse his
troupe of doomsday duplicates?

<H2>SOLVE</H2>

<P>
Move right, pick up the disk and carry on right to the end of the
corridor. Go down through the door, continue right and collect the
key and badge. Move left until you get to the spanner, pick it up,
use it and then drop it. Continue left and collect the grenade,
then go right and up through the door. Go right until you reach the
room captioned 'Insert the disk' and use the disk. Go up through
the door and leave the cave.
</P>

<P>
Move right until you get to the ladder and climb it, collect the
banana which you can eat to replenish your energy. Return to street
level and go right (show the badge to the policeman and continue
right!) to collect the Batrope. If you hit the Penguin's men with
your Batarang eight times they will drop a packet of crisps which
you can eat to increase your energy.
</P>

<P>
Go left and collect the sweet (this, like the banana restores all
your energy). Carry on left and climb the ladder, move right until
you get to the torch, pick it up and go back right until you get to
the ladder. Return to street level and go right, collect the
trainers and carry on to the warehouse ladder. Climb the ladder and
go right till you get to the door, use the key and drop it then
enter the warehouse. Go left to the end of the corridor and through
the door, go right and then enter through the door. Move right
until you get to the room called 'Shadows everywhere' and go through
the door. Go left and collect the bread, then right till you reach
the dead end. Use the grenade to blast the wall and go through the
door. Go right and up through the door, carry on to the end of the
corridor and through the door. Continue right till you get to the
room called 'Getting you down' and use the Batrope. Walk left and
collect the lift key, now use the trainers.
</P>

<P>
Move right and up through the door, go right and then down through
the door. Go left and down through the door and use the torch. Go
right, up through the door and left, collect the dart and go back to
the place where you landed when you dropped in on the Batrope and
use the lift key on the lift, drop the key and go through the door
and along the corridor until you reach the room called 'Shadows
everywhere'.
</P>

<P>
Go through to door and left and throw the dart at the dartboard and
pick up the passcard. Leave the warehouse and go right and return
to street level.
</P>

<P>
Go right and stop at the screen called 'Clue: pass it on' and use
the passcard to enter. Go left and up through the door, collect the
key and leave the room, go right and up through the second door,
then go left and through the door. Go left and up the stairs then
right to the end of the corridor and through the door, pick up the
tape and then go left and through the door. Now go right and
through the door using the key. Pick up the disk and go down
through the door, head right and through the door, carry on right
and collect the trumpet then go left and put the virus disk in the
Penguin's Computer.
