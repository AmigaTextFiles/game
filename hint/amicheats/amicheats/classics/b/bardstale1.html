<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Let the Bard use his magical talent to help you defeat Mangar, the
evil scourge of Skara Brae. Sound effects, music, over 85 spells.
</P>

<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
Obviously, the first thing you must do is assemble your party.
There is a BEGINNING party (supplied with the game) already
equipped with a basic level of Armour, Instruments, etc. A much
better and unique option is to transfer characters over from
either WIZARDRY or ULTIMA III! These characters come over as
fairly senior level characters and make the beginning of this
game much easier. This is a highly desirable alternative.
</P>

<P>
If you create your own characters - which you MUST do for your Bard
- pay special attention to the DEXTERITY attribute. This attribute
determines who strikes first in combat, and can be the difference
between an easy encounter and one which is a struggle.
</P>

<P>
Magic users should have a HIGH IQ, while Fighter classes should have
a HIGH STRENGTH. It is recommended that you choose a Monk as one of
your Fighters. Their Armour class drops as their level rises.
Eventually the Monk will have an Armour class of 'LO' wearing only
a robe. They can also do the most damage unarmed in actual combat!
</P>

<H2>CHEATS</H2>

<P>
To get more gold than you will ever need (and then some), transfer
all the parties gold to one player. Save him to disk then load him
back up and transfer all to another. Keep repeating this process
till you have done it to all the players, then exit without saving. 
Load back up and all your players will have the amount of gold
equal to that of the entire party before. Reapeat until satisfied.
</P>

<H2>SOLVE</H2>

<P>
The starting party in this solution consisted of a Monk, 2 Paladins,
a Bard, a Magician and a Conjuror. At higher levels of the game,
you will want to trade in one of your Paladins and develop another
MAGIC user.
</P>

<P>
When you first leave the Adventurer's Guild, explore the City. Visit
Garth's Armoury, and find the Review Board (located next to the Inn
on Trumpet Street). Don't wander too far until you get a feel for
how you can survive. To restore HIT POINTS after fighting, visit a
Temple. There, all ills - including death - can be cured for a
price. After a fight, you will quite frequently find objects of
some type. Keep them all. If you don't need them, go to Garth's and
sell them for gold - you will need it!
</P>

<P>
Visit Roscoe's Energy Emporium located off the Gran Plaz on the
corner of Grey Knife Street. There you will get an idea of what it
costs to RESTORE SPELL POINTS.
</P>

<P>
Early on, when you are still short of gold, the best way to restor.
Spell Points is to go into the Adventurer's Guild and just wait.
This game is in real-time and Spell Points are restored as you just
sit there. If you wait on the street or in a house, you will almost
certainly be attacked.
</P>

<P>
When you find an object after a fight or in a Chest in the Dungeons,
experiment with it to find out what it is. There are no cursed
items. Quite a few objects have magical properties that are not
readily apparent. Here are a few of the objects that you will find
most useful, even though you won't run into these until later in
the game:
</P>

<OL>
<LI>KAEL'S AXE: Seems to be the best weapon, causing the most damage
 for your Paladins.
<LI>FROST HORN: For your Bard, when used in combat it causes 40 - 70
 Hit Points of damage to a group of Monsters.
<LI>MAGE STAFF: For your Magic Users, allows them to regain Spell
 Points even in a Dungeon (this is incredibly useful).
</OL>

<P>
It is left to the individual player to discover the usefulness of
the other items found during the game. After learning the game-play
by wandering around the City and being able to survive, it is time
to visit the Dungeons. This is where the battle with Mangar will be
won or lost!
</P>

<P>
There are FIVE Dungeons in the game that must be explored in the
following order:
</P>

<OL>
<LI>WINE CELLAR & SEWERS
<LI>THE CATACOMBS
<LI>HARKYN'S CASTLE
<LI>KYLEARAN'S TOWER
<LI>MANGAR'S TOWER
</OL>

<P>
Each contains something that will help in the subsequent stages of
the game.
</P>

<H3>WINE CELLAR & SEWERS</H3>

<P>
The easiest dungeon of them all is reached from the Inn on Rakhir
Street. Enter the Inn, ask to order a drink, then select WINE. You
will then be ushered into the Wine Cellar. I cannot overstress the
importance of MAPPING in this game. Whenever possible, have the
MALE SPELL in operation. This will help you avoid some of the traps
that are lying around. When you have an encounter and find a Chest,
always cast a TRZP SPELL to disarm any traps that may be guarding
the Chest.
</P>

<P>
Located in the Wine Cellar are the stairs down to the SEWERS. The
First Level of the Sewers contains almost nothing of interest. So
locate the stairs to the Second Level of the Sewers as quickly as
possible and get down there. The Second Level contains one very
important bit of information that you will need to enter The
Catacombs: the name of the Mad God. There are also two hints to
questions that will be asked in other Dungeons. Explore this level
fully to find all the hints and the Mad God's name. The Lowest
Level of the Sewers is next and contains one item of importance for
later in the game. Locate and take the stairs exiting from this
level. Make sure you know where the stairs lead EXACTLY. After this
(I hope you have been visiting the Review Board regularly to
advance levels and learn new spells), you are ready for the
Catacombs.
</P>

<H3>THE CATACOMBS</H3>

<P>
The Catacombs are reached from one of the Mad God's Temples, located
on the East side of the Temple. Ask to speak to the Priest, then
give him the Mad God's name: TARJAN.
</P>

<P>
The First Level of the catacombs is just a survival test at this
stage. Once you can survive there fairly easily, head for the
Second Level. This level has a clue in it about the Mad God. It
also contains a very nasty creature called a Soul Sucker that
lurks in the Southwest corner of the Second Level. If you decide
to go in there and try him out, make sure that you have your
character disk backed up. You will not be able to defeat him at
this stage of your development but, fortunately, you don't have to!
</P>

<P>
The lowest Level contains something you will need later. Once you
have reached the Third Level you must use a TELEPORT SQUARE to
enter the Wizard's Realm. The Teleport is located in the
SOUTHEAST CORNER of the Dungeon. Once you are in the Wizard's
Realm, you must defeat him to gain the EYE. After you have this
item, you are ready to tackle Harkyn's Castle.
</P>

<H3>HARKYN'S CASTLE</H3>

<P>
Harkyn's Castle is located in the NORTHEAST CORNER of SKARA BRAE.
At this point in the game, it becomes very important for you to
have filled your special slot with the most powerful character
your magic users can summon. If you are in the process of
developing a Wizard, a lesser demon is best.
</P>

<P>
The First Level of this castle contains one item of importance:
THE CRYSTAL SWORD from the SOUTHEAST corner of this level. You
will now begin to find some of the more powerful objects to
experiment with during your encounters. After obtaining the
CRYSTAL SWORD, head for the Second Level of the Castle. The stairs
are located in the NORTHEAST corner of the First Level.
</P>

<P>
The Second Level of the Castle has a couple of interesting things.
If you answer the riddle correctly ("SHIELDS") you get a MAGIC
MOUTH which can be used to cast the SOSI SPELL. You must also
obtain the SILVER SQUARE from the SOUTHWEST corner of the Dungeon.
The access to this is from a TELEPORT located towards the middle of
the Northern section of the Dungeon. The PORTAL to the Third Level
is located in the NORTHEAST section of this level.
</P>

<P>
The Third Level of the Castle contains the ENTRANCE to KYLEARAN'S
TOWER and some interesting opportunities. The answer to the Old
Man's question is "SKULL TAVERN". When you encounter the
Berserkers, located at 12E 5N of this level, take advantage. They
can be fairly easily defeated with the right magic spells. You
should have at least 2 Sorcerers capable of casting the MIBL SPELL.
It also helps if your Bard has a FROST or FIRE HORN to aid the
others along.
</P>

<P>
When you can defeat these guys easily, it is time to make another
Magic User. You can TELEPORT from the CASTLE ENTRANCE, fight the
Berserkers, TELEPORT back back to the Entrance, exit the Castle,
then do it again and again until your spells run low. At 60,000
Experience Points a crack, it doesn't take long to develop a
decent Magic User.
</P>

<P>
After this, it is time to attempt Kylearan's Castle. When you
approach, and fight the STATUE OF THE MAD GOD located in the
SOUTHEAST corner of this level, you will be teleported inside
the gates of Kylearan's Tower.
</P>

<H3>KYLEARAN'S TOWER</H3>

<P>
After the battle with the Mad God and your subsequent teleport
(you DID have the EYE in your possession?!), go ONE STEP forward,
TURN RIGHT, then kick the door down. You will then be entering one
of the two most difficult mazes in the game. Most of it is in the
dark and there are riddles that must be answered. Back up your
character disk BEFORE entering this maze!
</P>

<P>
Once you are in, watch carefully for teleports - they are
everywhere. It is extremely important that you map this maze VERY
CAREFULLY. After you have reached the ANTIMAGIC SQUARE from
wandering in a very small section of the dark, the next step
forward is a TELEPORT to 11E 12N.
</P>

<P>
Explore until you find a MAGIC MOUTH that asks you to "Name the one
of cold, foretold twofold". The answer to this one is "STONE
GOLEM". You will then be teleported again. After this, you will
enter a very large, dark area. In order to get out of this, you
must answer the question posed at 12E 2N which says: "Name the
Endless Byway and your path will be guaranteed". The answer to this
is the only street in Skara Brae with no end - "SINISTER".
</P>

<P>
You can then map your way through a lighted section to another dark
area. From this dark area you must obtain the SILVER TRIANGLE,
located at the very NORTH of the dark area. You can then exit the
dark area, going SOUTH from 1E 6N. After this, you will face the
CRYSTAL GOLEM (did you bring the CRYSTAL SWORD?). You can defeat
him with conventional weapons and spells, but somebody has to have
the Crystal Sword or he will reappear to block your exit!
</P>

<P>
At this point, you can exit the Tower to refresh your players or
continue on. If you exit, when you re-enter you must again answer
the endless byway question to continue. Upon reaching the end of
the Snakey Road on the East side of the maze, DON'T go through the
South door. Take the door that goes WEST. You will then enter
several rooms with Spinners and Teleports that make finding your
way almost impossible!
</P>

<P>
The way past these is SOUTHWEST. When you make it, you will be
teleported to 14E 1N. It is then an easy stroll to meet Kylearan
himself. He turns out to be the friendly Wizard and gives you a KEY
that allows you to get into MANGAR'S TOWER. He then teleports you
to the stairs exiting his tower. You no longer need the Crystal
Sword or the Eye, and you are now ready for Mangar himself!!
</P>

<H3>MANGAR'S TOWER</H3>

<P>
If you paid heed and followed the stairs from the Bottom Level of
the Sewers, you will know how to get inside Mangar's walls. If not,
go to the Wine Cellar, TELEPORT your party 17E 16N 3D, and take the
stairs UP. Then TURN RIGHT and kick the door in. You should be at
the Entrance to Mangar's Tower.
</P>

<P>
Level One is fairly easy to find your way around in. Follow the
teleports and walk around until you reach the MAGIC MOUTH on the
EAST side of the maze. What is tricky is that after leaving the
MAGIC MOUTH, you are now on Level Two of the Tower.......so BE
CAREFUL with your mapping!
</P>

<P>
Level Two is again fairly easy. From this level you must answer the
question located at 4E 15N to obtain the SILVER CIRCLE. The answer
to the question is "CIRCLE". You must then make your way to the
stairs located in the MIDDLE of the SOUTHERN side of the maze.
</P>

<P>
Level Three is the hardest maze of all, but by this time you must
be getting really proficient at mapping. You must wander around
this level and obtain quite a number of items. First of all, you
should get the MASTER KEY, for 50,000 Gold Pieces, from 19E 12N.
This Key allows you to enter Mangar's through the Front Gate,
instead of from the Sewers.
</P>

<P>
You must then find the CLUES to the SEVEN WORDS needed to access
the Fourth Level of Mangar's. Gratefully, you can teleport into
and out of this level. After finding the CLUES, you can then SPEAK
the SEVEN WORDS to the MAGIC MOUTH located at 10E 4N. They MUST be
entered ONE AT A TIME. The words are: "LIE WITH PASSION AND BE
FOREVER DAMNED". Stairs will then appear at 3E 9N. This is the ONLY
way to obtain access to the UPPER REACHES of MANGAR'S!!
</P>

<P>
The Fourth Level of Mangar's has only ONE tricky part. When you
first arrive, you have a LIMITED NUMBER of ways you can go. After
reaching a certain point, located in the NORTHEAST CORNER of the
level, doors appear everywhere. Don't be confused! Everything maps
the same, it's just that doors are everywhere!! Eventually, you
will find the PORTAL to Level Five in the SOUTHWEST corner of this
level.
</P>

<P>
Level Five is the home stretch. This easy maze leads you to the LAVA
PIT in the middle of the EASTERN side of the maze. There you DIVE
IN and are TELEPORTED to 10E 6N. You will then find the march up
the Hall of Harm to be fruitless if you didn't bring the THREE
SILVER ITEMS along. If you have the SILVER TRIANGLE, SILVER SQUARE
and SILVER CIRCLE, a door will appear directly NORTH of you.
</P>

<P>
After passing through this door, cast your REST SPELL to restore
everybody to HEALTH and proceed directly NORTH to the final battle
with Mangar!
</P>

<P>
The final battle itself is a large disappointment as it is fairly
easy to defeat Mangar and his Vampires, and meet Kylearan again,
who gives you 300,000 bonus Experience Points. After defeating
Mangar, you can then proceed ONE MORE SQUARE NORTH for the LAST
QUESTION of the game!
</P>

<P>
The answer is: "SPECTRE SNARE", which you then receive (it is good
for binding to your party any of your opponents in battle).
</P>
