<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
NOTE: This game is also known as "Shadow Of The Beast III".
</P>

<P>
Follow-up to Shadow of the Beast II. The Warrior Messenger's reward
for defeating the evil Zelek was the return of his human physique.
But celebration must be put aside until evil is banished from the
land once and for all. Now that Zelek's no longer a threat, our hero
faces his ultimate challenge against Maletoth - The Beast Lord. Four
massive levels, many intricate puzzles, multiplexed hardware
sprites, powerful music.
</P>

<H2>CHEATS</H2>

<P>
On the title screen, slowly type "DADDY DRAW THIS FOR ME" and press
'RETURN'. The shurikan should turn to a smiley face with the
programmers initials 'PJH' under it. During the game use the 'RIGHT
CURSOR' key for invicibility and the 'LEFT CURSOR' key to go back to
normal.
</P>

<H2>SOLVE</H2>

<H3>LEVEL 1: FOREST OF ZEAKRES</H3>

<P>
Run right and shoot the circular plants in the trees whilst avoiding
the purple blobs that are fired at you. Continue running right and
jump on the lift, then hit the switch once. Wait for the lift to
reach the top and run right, collect the gold and shoot the band of
goblins that are running towards you. Continue right and shoot the
wheel three or four times depending on how close you are, then run
across the platforms and jump up to collect the grenade.
</P>

<P>
Change your weapon to grenades and blow up the gun turrets on the
moving platforms. Collect the key on the fourth platform and then
return to the first platform (the one on the left). Wait until it
reaches the bottom and jump over to the left. Now use the key to
open the door and collect the gold. Return to the fourth platform
and jump right when it reaches the top.
</P>

<P>
Continue right and shoot the goblins. Jump down to the bottom and
run right, shooting the goblins. Shoot the meat on the spit until
it lands on the floor, push the meat to the right, leaving it under
the swinging spiked block (picking the key up on the way). Now run
left to the caged monster and use the key. Jump onto the ladder.
The monster will escape and go for the meat. The spiked block will
then fall on the beast and kill him instantly. This will enable you
to run past and collect the gold.
</P>

<P>
Jump onto the rocket platform and steer it to the left, then
straighten it up by standing in the centre so the loose rock will be
collected on your ascent. Once the platform reaches the top, run
left and push the rock down. Stand on the left-hand edge of the
swaying platform.
</P>

<P>
Wait for it to stop moving and jump the gap to the left. Run left,
up the hill, and shoot the metal spikes as they emerge and then run
past them. Repeat this until you reach the top of the hill. Run
left over the bridge and onto the edge of the cliff. Fall with the
rocks as the cliff crumbles.
</P>

<P>
Run left and kill the red demon by jumping when he fires at you then
retaliating yourself. When he is destroyed, pick up his skull as
you will need it later.
</P>

<H3>LEVEL 2: FORT DOURMOOR</H3>

<P>
Run right and shoot the switch to lower the drawbridge. Run to the
right, jump over the wheel and push it to the left until it joins
onto the battering ram, then push the battering ram all the way to
the right until it hits the door. Wait for the door to be knocked
down, dodging the fireballs in the meantime. Cross the bridge and
shoot the trampoline that the balls bounce on and then continue
right.
</P>

<P>
As soon as you stand on the large trapdoor, turn left and shoot the
bats, then run right and collect the gold. Go left and fall into
the small pit, then shoot the small gold block until it smashes.
Jump onto the larger trapdoor and slide down the chute. Run right,
jump over the table and push it left (into the bigger room). Jump
onto the table, duck down and shoot the switch on the left.
</P>

<P>
When the water rises, hit the switch on the right. Wait for the
water level to drop and then push right, collect the gold and climb
the ladder. Push the table into the water and shoot the
barrel-throwing monster, then jump the gap. Run behind the large
crate (marked fragile) and push it to the left until it falls down
the gap. Jump back across the gap and climb down the ladder, then
shoot the crate until it splinters and covers the water with
floating planks. Jump across the water by using the planks to stand
on.
</P>

<P>
Continue right and fall down the pit. Jump over the barrel and then
over the pit. Kill the red creature that is operating the levers
but don't let the crane hit you. Push the barrel to the edge of the
gap and then operate the three levers that move the crane in order
to pick up the barrel and place it on the right-hand side of the
conveyor belt. Go down the ladder and shoot the trapdoor on the
left. Leave the one on the right open and do not shoot the
creature.
</P>

<P>
Climb the ladder to the very top and go right. Kill the headless
creature by jumping up and shooting it in the neck. When it dies,
pick up the spiked ball and collect the gold on the right.
</P>

<P>
Walk all the way left, dodge the swinging ball and collect the gold.
Return to the ladder, climb part way down and jump into the barrel.
Shoot the switch on the right and immediately pull down to close the
lid of the barrel. Wait until the barrel finally comes to a
standstill, jump out and run left.
</P>

<H3>LEVEL 3: CAVES OF BIDHUR</H3>

<P>
Run right until you are past the two creatures on the bridge then
jump up and shoot them from behind. Continue right and jump onto
the first branch. Stand as far right as you can and face left, then
jump up the branches and shoot the nest and the four birds at the
top. Run right and jump off the edge. Keep going until you see a
table and shoot the left leg off it. Jump over to the other side
and blast the other leg off. This will leave you with a pivoted
plank.
</P>

<P>
Shoot the head on the wall so it drops onto the see-saw. Push the
whole plank as far left as it'll go, climb up the ladder and run off
the edge to the right, so that you fall on the right-hand side of
the plank. This will catapult the head up so it hits the bird's
cage and frees it. Stand in front of the bird and press fire. Once
you are on the bird, fly diagonally up and right until you see a
column of metal balls. You will also notice a set of adjustable
runners. First, adjust them so they will direct the balls into the
top of the cave and release the first three balls by shooting the
lever.
</P>

<P>
Now adjust the runners so they lead to the next cave down and
release the remaining balls. Once you have done this, fly straight
down the shaft below you and tackle the birds until one of them
drops a hammer. Collect the hammer and fly all the way back up to
the top cave.
</P>

<P>
Dismount from the bird and go through the gap to the right, dodging
left as soon as the slab falls. Change your weapon to the hammer
and push one of the metal balls to the left edge of the shallow pit.
Shoot the slab a few times to move it onto the metal ball. Keep
moving the slab to the right by way of putting metal balls
underneath it as the ones to the rear are freed.
</P>

<P>
Once the block reaches the right-hand side of the shallow pit, keep
throwing the hammers at it until it will go no further. Change your
weapon back to the throwing stars and use the slab as a step in
order to reach the higher platform. Go right and kill the monster
by shooting it repeatedly in the eye (you must leap over the
fireballs and attack the creature when it's retreating).
</P>

<P>
Once it is, go right and collect the empty flask from the lab. Now
return to the cave below. Fly past the bouncing balls to the edge
of the red lake. Dismount the bird, select the empty glass flask as
the current object, jump into the very middle of the red lake and
press fire to fill the flask to the brim.
</P>

<H3>LEVEL 4: NOSTHOMAK</H3>

<P>
Run right and shoot the flame-thrower whilst ducking the flames
until it is destroyed. Continue right, past the large steel ball
and go down the stairs. Shoot the leg off the small table and push
it as far right as it will go. Shoot the bats to minimise the harm
that they do to you.
</P>

<P>
Push the bookcase left until it is just before the library sign,
then climb up the ladder and jump on top of the bookcase. Jump up
and collect the hammer. Climb down the ladder and negotiate the
stairs, heading for the large steel ball.
</P>

<P>
Shoot the ball twice with your throwing stars then switch to the
hammer and start shooting at the ball rapidly until it is at full
swing. Jump onto the ball as it is coming towards you and let it
carry you up to the highest point of its swing.
</P>

<P>
The ball should now detach itself from the chain and roll down the
stairs. Continue right, past the sliding puzzle (it is not
necessary to complete the puzzle), go down the ladder and into the
crane booth. Pick up the small fish at the bottom of the top-left
tank and feed it to the top fish in tank three. Take the top fish
from tank three once it has eaten the small fish and feed it to the
fish in tank one. Take the fish from tank one and give it to the
remaining fish in tank three. Now take the fish from tank three and
feed it to the shark in tank two. Phew! Got that?. The small
shark will not harm you.
</P>

<P>
Move to the exit box and press fire. Climb up the ladder and run
through the tanks, taking care not to jump into the spikes. Climb
down the ladder after tank three and fall down the drop to the
right. Jump over the ball and climb down the ladder. Run right,
jump the small pit and then jump onto the ledge. Shoot the switch
to turn the furnace on. Stand next to the furnace, select the
hammers and keep shooting the furnace until it won't move any
further. You will see some spikes hanging from the ceiling from a
chain slightly to the right. Switch you weapon to the throwing
stars and shoot the spikes twice (you will see a small crack appear
in the chain). Now switch your weapon back to hammers. Keep
jumping up and shooting the spikes repeatedly with your hammers
until they are at full swing, then quickly change back to the
throwing stars and shoot the spikes when they are at their highest
point of their swing to the left. The spikes will then detach from
the chain and plug the shallow pit on the floor.
</P>

<P>
Go left and climb up the ladder. Jump over the large ball and push
it to the right until it falls into the furnace. Run right and jump
onto the small platform next to the furnace switch. Wait for the
block of ice to start melting and once the top of it is just below
your platform, jump onto it and then immediately jump onto the ledge
just to the right. Hit the switch on the wall which will turn off
the forcefield below you.
</P>

<P>
Wait a few seconds for the molten metal on the floor to cool and
then drop down from the platform. Collect the crystal on the floor
and walk right until you are directly beneath the other crystal
which is embedded in the next block of ice. Keep shooting the ice
with the hammers until it shatters and you will then be able to
catch the second crystal.
</P>

<H3>DEFEATING MALETOTH</H3>

<P>
Run and jump onto the platforms. When Maletoth appears, repeatedly
fire at his head.
</P>

<P>
HINT: Change platforms every time he goes past you and try to
destroy him as quickly as possible.
</P>
