<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
As in the first game in the series, players construct their
characters from the ground up. Players who have completed Quest for
Glory I may bring their seasoned Heroes to play in this second
installment. Set among the mystical and exotic background of the
Arabian Night, Trial by Fire reaches new heights of humor and
adventure.
</P>

<H2>SOLVE</H2>

<P>
So, we find ourselves in Shapeir. An oasis in the middle of the
vast desert. We start in the Katta's Tail Inn, talking to Abdulla.
Talk to him and he will tell you that you should explore the town.
But to do this effectively you will need a map of the town layout.
The Inn isn't the place to look for such a thing, so we decide to
leave this place.
</P>

<P>
When exiting the Inn, we enter a plaza, and in one corner there is a
fellow trying to sell some junk, like ashtrays, t-shirts, maps, hey,
did he say map? That's exactly what we need now! But when talking
the man we soon find out that the money from spielburg isn't
accepted here!
</P>

<P>
Fortunately, there is a moneychanger in this town, and if you follow
the instructions Ali Chicha gives you, you will eventually find her.
After exchanging your money for Shapeir money, return to the stand
of Ali Chicha. Buy the map and compass from him.
</P>

<P>
Now we have taken the first step to exploring the town. During the
following 12 or so days, all we'll have to do is to defeat several
elementals attacking the town. But there are other fun things to
do, as well.
</P>

<P>
The Magic-User will want to become a member of the WIT. To become a
such. You will first have to find where it's located. There are two
magicians in this town that you can ask, Keapon Laffin and Aziza.
However, none of those will tell you much. Perhaps give a pointer.
To find WIT, you will have to use the spell Detect magic to locate a
certain cul-de-sac. When you think you have found the right spot,
cast an Open spell to enter WIT.
</P>

<P>
Once inside WIT you will be asked why you seek admittance (answer
some-thing like magic), and will be asked to choose a mentor. You
can see pictures of different persons, among them Aziza. But she
says she don't know you well enough. Hmm.. Who is it on that
painting? Remember ol' Erasmus? Well, he seems to remember you,
and despite much moaning from other Wizards, he can be chosen your
mentor. Then, all you have to do is to pass those tests.
</P>

<P>
The first test is in a dark room, where you will have to use detect
magic, fetch and trigger to perform what Erasmus ask you to do.
Then it's on to the path of Wizardry.
</P>

<P>
First to block your way along this path is the element of air, in
the form of a fan. Make the fan move towards you and then levitate
to let it pass under you. Thus, the first obstacle has been
negated.
</P>

<P>
Next to hinder you is the element of earth. He can be coped with by
casting several calm spells after casting detect magic (or was it
trigger?). Just climb over the elemental when he is calm.
</P>

<P>
The third element is fire. To get past this one, extinguish the
fire with a calm spell. (Be sure to open the door with a fetch
spell first.) Then, after closing the door (another fetch spell),
cast a force bolt at the upper half of the door. The door will
allow you to cross the hole.
</P>

<P>
The last hinder is the element of water. It will have to be melted
with a flame dart, and then cracked with several well placed force
bolts.
</P>

<P>
Once you have finished this, you will be accepted as an initiate in
WIT. You do not want to remain there, however, no matter what the
other wizards say.
</P>

<P>
The Thief should seek out the moneychanger for more than one reason.
She just happens to be the local thieves' guild, and she will give
you an assignment if you identify yourself as a thief. Just follow
her directions, and remember to lift the rug. (If surprised, just
hide in the closet, but be sure you've oiled the hinges first.) As a
reward for a well done assignment, she will then give you directions
as to where more money can be found.
</P>

<P>
The Fighter will later be given the opportunity to join the EOF.
(Ask the adventurers' guild manager about this.) But it will take
some time before this happens. When it does, just follow the
instructions you get (the letters left at the adventurers' guild)
and simply break the chains when you're going to be 'executed'.
</P>

<H3>THE TOWN OF SHAPEIR</H3>

<P>
In the town there are the following locations of interest.
</P>

<P>
THE SAURUS PEN: Here you can buy your own riding saurus on day 2 or
3.
</P>

<P>
THE KATTA'S TAIL INN: Retire here when it's time to sleep. Also,
Omar the prophet will speak here on occasion.
</P>

<P>
THE ALCHEMIST: Here you can buy pills and sell
differentingredients. You can also buy the incense that will be
needed do defeat the fire elemental later on. Ask Harik on fire,
since this is his specialty. He will also be able to mix up some
dispel potions for you.
</P>

<P>
THE MAGIC SHOP: This shop is run by Keapon Laffin, a person attuned
to the element of air. He can provide information on the element of
air as well as spells and a magic rope. If asked for, he will give
away fool's earth (or something like that).
</P>

<P>
THE FOUNTAIN PLAZA: Here you can fill your waterskins, get dirt
from the flourist, buut a brass lamp to contain a fire elemental and
buy food.
</P>

<P>
AZIZA: The encantress will let you in if you answer her questions.
You can then then get information about the different elementals and
the enchanted tree in the desert. While she tells something about
all the elementals, she is most attuned to the element of water.
</P>

<P>
PALACE PLAZA: I think this is the place to buy a cloth bag, that
will be used to store a earth elemental later on. Aside from that
the only thing that can be obtained here is a pin that you're given
as a gift after defeating the elementals.
</P>

<P>
FIGHTER PLAZA: Here you should find Rakeesh, a paladin and a noble
warrior. He can lend you a magical, flaming sword to defeat the
earth elemental. He can also tell you 'bout the element of earth.
</P>

<P>
BLACKSMITH: This man sells swords and daggers, and also like
armwrestling. It's a good way to add to your strength. Also, on
his sign hangs the bellows that you will use to capture the air
elemental.
</P>

<P>
ADVENTURERS' GUILD: Here you can train, sign your name in the book,
and find different quests on the board.
</P>

<P>
ASTROLOGER: You can get your future told here. If there's anything
more to do, I admit I missed it.
</P>

<P>
MONEYCHANGER: As have been said, you change money here and get
assignments if a thief.
</P>

<P>
NEST OF THE GRIFFIN: Can be found if walking left along the cliffs
when entering the desert. Scare the griffin away, and then use the
magic rope or levitate to get a feather. (This can be tricky)
</P>

<P>
ENCHANTED TREE: Follow the cliffs to the right when entering the
desert to get here.
</P>

<P>
OASIS OF THE DERVISH: Ask the guard at the town gate for
instructions on how to find this place. What you want here is some
of the dervish' beard.
</P>

<H3>ON TO THE QUEST</H3>

<P>
When you've familiarized yourself with the Town, the elementals
should start to appear. The first one is the fire elemental, that
will ravage the gates plaza one day after it's first heard of. To
defeat this hot- head, get some incense that you spread on the
ground. Then lead the elemental into the alley and place the brass
lamp on the ground. When You run out of incense, use a full
waterskin to force the elemental into the lamp. Viola, you now have
a magic lamp!
</P>

<P>
Four days later, an air elemental will appear in the palace plaza.
This guy really doesn't like dirt, so if you throw some at him,
he'll be paralyzed for a while. When paralyzed, the elemental fit
just nicely in the bellows.
</P>

<P>
The next challenge is the Earth elemental. It will roam the streets
of the town an can be encountered anywhere buy in the plazas. To
defeat it, you'll have to use fire. The two ways to do this is to
use either the flame dart spell or Rakeesh's Soulforge. Be sure to
collect the remains in a cloth bag.
</P>

<P>
The last threat to the city is a water elemental appearing in the
foun- tain. The only thing that can drive it from the fountain is
the air elemental captured in the bellows. It can then be captured
in an empty waterskin.
</P>

<P>
The last important thing to do before leaving with the caravan to
Raseir is to have Harik make dispel potions. To do this, he needs
some ingre- dients. All of those you should already have collected,
except for one. The missing ingredient is the 'Fruit of
Compassion'. To obtain this, you will need to visit Aziza and ask
her on the plant. Then get to the tree and give it water, while
telling it about yourself. Give it earth and tell it about your
deeds. Lastly, give it a hug and tell her her name. (Julanar) The
tree will now bear fruit, and Harik should be able to make the
potions.
</P>

<P>
(Some things are omitted here, but those pose no problems while
playing the game.)
</P>

<H3>ON TO RASEIR</H3>

<P>
You will now traver to the town of Raseir, where evil rules. After
entering the town, enter the Blue Parrot. There you'll find the
head of the thieves' guild in Raseir - a really slimy guy. He will
have you steal a statuette of a falcon from the captain of the
guard. But first, you should meet a lady in distress. She wants
your pass, so that she can get out of the city. Of course, that
means YOU cant get out anymore, but we're supposed to be heroes,
aren't we? Give her your clothes and pass, and then you'll get a
mirror in exchange. Now to stealing the statue. Enter the central
plaza sneaking, and wait 'til the guard disappears. (as soon as it
gets dark) Then use the magic rope or the levitate spell to get to
the window on the second floor. Enter the room within and steal the
statue from the cabinet. (once again you'll have to use oil to make
sure those hinges doesn't make any sound) Upon returning to the
'Blue Parrot' you will be arrested as soon as you leave the tavern.
</P>

<H3>IN THE PRISON</H3>

<P>
Remember the pin the Katta gave you? Remember what associasions it
gave you? Well after talking to the Katta in the cell (and showing
him the pin) You skillfully use the pin to pick the lock to the
cell. The Katta then show you a secret passage leading out of here.
Don't forget your gear, though. At the other end you will part,
just to run into Ad Avis. He will hypnotize you and you will
suddenly find yourself in the lost city.
</P>

<H3>THE CRYPT</H3>

<P>
Since the prophecy seems unwilling to fulfill itself, you'll have to
help it a bit. With the help of the mirror, the stars will suddenly
be in the correct positions and the door to the crypt will open. Ad
Avis will then urge you to go into the crypt. Again you will fight
the elements. This time Water is the first to oppose you as an
underwater stream block your way. Every now and then there floats
past a log, could this be of any help? On the other side of the
stream there's a hole in the wall wich creates a strong wind. Use
force bolt ore brute foce to block the hole, and you've negated the
second element. You can then traverse the path to the room with
boiling lava. Once in there it helps to keep cool, if you find this
hard, you should pour something on yourself. On the other side of
the lava you will find a cliff and a door below it. To get down,
use the rope or the spell levitate. Once you approach the door, it
will start asking nosy questions. (only one, actually) The answer
to the question could be discerned from conversation with Abdulla,
but why you should think of doing this before you get the question,
I don't know. The answer is 'Suleiman' (Ben Daoud, I think) The
only thing now standing between you and the statue of Iblis is the
treasury. Just don't take any of those goodies, and you'll get
through this room without problems. Now you enter the room where
the staue of Iblis is located.
</P>

<H3>THE FINAL BATTLE</H3>

<P>
Just before you reach the statue, Ad Avis appears out of thin air.
He then seal the cave and leave you there to die. Fortunately, Ad
Avis has mis- interpreted the prophecy, and when looking carefully
you will find a ring on a stalagmite, containing 'He who is left
behind'. This being is a djinn, and has the power to grant wishes.
Since you have three, you can use two to improve your chracter,
while using the last to teleport back to Raseir. Once here, you
again meet the Katta from the cell, and he tells you that you should
sneak into the palace while the Kattas kepp the guards busy.
sneaking to the palace, you see a handkerchief tied to the
battlement. Wait until the guard moves away, and then levitate or
climb to where the hanky is. You now enter the harem. (Wish one
could stay there, sigh!) After a long scene, you will sneak past the
eunucks guarding the harem. Now we find ourselves watching how Ad
Avis is freeing Iblis. Since this is somthing that should be
avoided, our task is to stop him, but how? It is essential to stop
him from finishing the ritual, and since you cant get him from here,
you must use the rope to get to the tower. uce there, you can throw
a dagger at one of the candles and break the spell. However, this
will upset Ad Avis. He will do his best to kill you, but if you
duck, and throw daggers at him, you should be able to kill him. (I
had a hard time doing this, mainly because i never got across the
rope fast enough to stop Ad Avis from freeing Iblis)
</P>

<P>
Now all you have to do is to relax and watch the ending scene.
