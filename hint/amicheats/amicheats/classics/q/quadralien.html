<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
Once in the core, you can't quit. So choose droids with
good lasers, Jack and Spud for example. The Quadralien mother is
made up of 4 separate pieces grouped together and surrounded by
Earthling boxes. The mother can only be destroyed by blowing up
each box from a different direction. From the starting point there
are three exits: north, east, and west. Go east and destroy the
first box, return to the starting point, and go north to destroy
the second box. You will now have both droids to blow the
remaining boxes. Go west through the one-way force field, and get
the other. Don't forget to keep recharging.
