<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
As a player you will travel back in time to stop six wicked
sorcerers from creating a magic book of evil.
</P>

<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
While playing Wizards Squares, I find that the ball usually lands on
Red or Blue.
</P>

<P>
If you have low hit points, watch out for Slasher Boars. Also,
steer clear of swamps and mountains, as they contain the toughest of
monsters (Hurlers, Ice Urchins, Spikers,etc.). Grub Snufflers are
the best monster to meet because they have a much greater pro- fit
ratio. (hit points against gold carried)
</P>

<P>
The game is finished in the realm of sorcerers, in the Dungeon of
Despair. You must have about 10,000 hit points and many spells to
finish it. An absolute neccessity is the "Scroll of Scalna", which
can be found in the other dungeon in the realm. The Scroll is a
magical map, and it automatically maps your path.
</P>

<P>
Watch out in the dungeons, and constantly check ahead of you with
the "Xamine" command at the bottom of the list of commands, as bear
traps or spikes whip up and destroy your amour, or do up to 4000 hit
points damage.
</P>

<P>
Some weapons are better than others for killing certain monsters.
Here is a list indicating what weapon is best against some of the
different monsters.
</P>

<P>
Tanglers -------- Dagger<BR>
Wave Slappers --- Rapier<BR>
Spincers -------- Rapier<BR>
Mutant Carps ---- Cudgel<BR>
Slasher Boars --- Spear<BR>
Ramdarts -------- Bow and Arrow<BR>
Giant Cockroach - Fauchard<BR>
Spiker ---------- Staff
</P>

<P>
Make sure that you have plenty of food before descending into any
dungeons or tombs, as you may get lost and run out of food. This
will cause you to starve to death
</P>

<P>
Some magic items can help you in your quest - If you Use the wand of
power, you gain 200 hit points, and if you Use the moonstone amulet,
you gain 100 food.
</P>

<H2>SOLVE</H2>

<P>
Here are the moves you will have to do to complete this
quest......don't panic if you can't follow them closely, as
searching for some food will be unfortunately a hard task!
</P>

<P>
First of all, go to Bay View to buy rope and hooks - to allow you to
go through mountains - as well as a hammer.
</P>

<P>
To gain one level, you will just have to go to Redstone Castle, open
the door to the Hall of visions with the gold key (already in your
inventory at the start of the game). There, speak.......Mesron may
help you......you will have to do it after each 'big action'.
</P>

<P>
You will then have to gather lots of money, as living in Questron 2
is based upon money. When you are rich enough to cure yourself from
bad injuries, go to Redstone Castle and open every chest in sight.
This means that you will have to kill nearly all Guards, and thus
you will be at great risk.
</P>

<P>
The emerald key is located in the Northwest corner of the Castle, in
a room guarded by only one soldier, and where two chests stand. The
copper key is located in the Southwest corner of the Castle, near
the Guard dressed in red. You will have enough money to buy some
Hit-Points.
</P>

<P>
Your next goal is Rivercrest Cathedral and within, the Rivercrest
tombs.
</P>

<P>
Here, not very far from the entrance - it is the first door in the
hall to the East - lies the Moonstone Amulet. Bring it immediately
to the Holy One, in the Cathedral. He can help you. There is also
an Emerald Door - far from the entrance to the Southeast, which can
be opened with the emerald key found in the Castle. Not far from it
lies the Wand of Power.
</P>

<P>
Go back to Redstone Castle and the Hall of Visions to gain one
level. The best thing to do now is to go to Octapoint to buy some
weapons, clothes, spells and travel facilities.
</P>

<P>
Now go back to the Rivercrest tombs. Follow the corridor to the
Northeast until you find the Blind Robed Priest. Give him the fare
he wants and go through the passage he grants you. Go to the door
to the East, cross the room to the South door, go through it and
speak with the character standing there. He is Morle the Magician.
He will give you a mission (find and give him the Orb), and a brass
key.
</P>

<P>
Go back to Redstone Castle, open the doors that you haven't been
able to unlock with the other keys, and go to the Hall of Maps.
When you have memorised the maps, go to collect the Ord (just under
you!), the door opens with the copper key.
</P>

<P>
Return to Morle inside Rivercrest tombs and get his Orb back. He
will teleport you to the Realm of the Sorceror'.
</P>

<P>
You should be near Demph. Enter it and buy as many spells, Hit
points and as much food as possible. Buy also (if you can afford
it) a camel or some kind of terrestrian animal to carry you. You
will have to find a boat to get back to Landor. Go to Burnside.
Here you should find some for about 2000 gold pieces. Go to the
North of Burnside. You should see the boat on the coast. Sail
Norrth until you reach Landor (not far from Redstone Castle).
</P>

<P>
Go to the Hall of Visions and improve your abilities (you should be
an Apprentice now). Maybe you will have a key replacing all other
keys. You can go and consult the Sage that will improve your
abilitieas too.
</P>

<P>
Sail back to the Realm of the Sorceror's. Enter the dungeon located
on the Eastof the island. The equipment you need is randomly
distributed on each level. Open every chest until you have them
all. Don't forget to watch out for traps.......type X to avoid
them.
</P>

<P>
The Scroll of Scalna lies somewhere on Level 3, the Crystal Goblet
on level 4, the Agate Key on Level 6 and the Onyx Key on Level 8.
Now go to the surface.
</P>

<P>
Go to Twilight Cathedral and give the crystal goblet to the Holy
One. He will be very impressed!!
</P>

<P>
Go to the Great Fortress. You will have to execute all Guards and
open each chest to find some useful tools. Be sure you are strong
enough to try it. You should find the Sapphire Key to the East of
the Fortress, and the Ruby Key in the guard's quarters. Open the
door leading to Simon the Stooge with the agate key. Give him some
money so as to have your abilities increased.
</P>

<P>
Exit the Fortress and come back again (only then will the King talk
to you......well you DID slay all his guard company!). Go to the
two-door set. Open the first with the agate key and the second with
the ruby key. Go to speak to the King. Although he is angry about
you, he asks you to be his hero! No time to hesitate......he will
give you the Opal key (to open all doors in the Fortress). Go to
the last door left (behind the King) open it with the opal key,
follow the path to the Eternal Flame. Get it and exit the Fortress.
</P>

<P>
Go to Twilight Fortress, visit the Holy One (maybe some Bread of
Life?), and enter the tombs thanks to the Onyx Key. Find your way
to the Black Key. It is in a room to the far West of the labyrinth.
The Eternal Flame will help you to cross the dark passage. There is
nothing else interesting in the tombs so don't waste time there.
</P>

<P>
Go back to Landor and Redstone Castle. Go to the Hall of Visions.
Mesron will tell you that Seacrest is about to be attacked. Go
there as fast as you can! (you just have to go FOUR MOVES to the
right from the Castle, then go North until you enter the
village.......don't waste any moves, avoid all encounters as time is
of the essence.......once in Seacrest, you should face Mantor, and
his killer guards - if not it's too late). Get near to Mantor and
throw him a fireball (from the Book of Magic). He will vanish and
the guards will be free from the spell thrown on them. You have
saved Seacrest!!
</P>

<P>
Go back to the Hall of Visions. Speak twice to earn some
experience, and be considered as a Knight of Landor. Mesron will
tell you that Morle has been captured by Mantor.
</P>

<P>
Your Hit Points are now only limited by the number of Gold Pieces
you have. Try to buy as many as you can, more than 10,000 if you
want to survive (the end of the game costs a lot of hit points!!).
</P>

<P>
Go back to the Realm of Sorceror's, enter Demph and buy some spells
(Fireballs!).
</P>

<P>
Now you can enter the Dungeon of Despair: you are a Knight of
Landor and own the Black Key. Reach Level 8 of the Dungeon by any
available means.....beware the last trap leads to Mantor's
Lair.....he has thrown a spell that costs you about 40 hit points
each move you make (Mantor's Mind Zap).
</P>

<P>
Go East then North until you reach Morle who cries for you to hurry.
Find Mantor (just wander about for a few seconds to find him),
follow the corridors. Kill all annoying guards.
</P>

<P>
Once you have entered the main room where Mantor and his private
guards stand, try to reach the Book of Evil (in the centre) and
throw the Destruct Spell (from the Book of Magic) until Mantor
disappears.
</P>

<P>
Morle teleports you with his last psychic strength to Redstone
Castle where you are welcomed as THE HERO!!!
</P>

<P>
Well done, Count Of Questron, Baron of Landor!!
</P>
