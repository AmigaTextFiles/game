<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
1 or 2 player arcade platform romp that takes you and your smart
colored duck through 80 magical levels!
</P>

<H2>CHEATS</H2>

<P>
During a one player game when you die and have no more credits,
press fire on the joystick in the mouse port to restart the game on
the level you last died on.
</P>

<H2>TIPS</H2>

<P>
BASICS: There are eight worlds and ten scenes per world. To
complete each scene you must collect all the gold keys and make your
way through the open door.
</P>

<P>
EGGS AND BADDIES: Touching a baddie causes the loss of one armour
or death. Eggs can be thrown at baddies and it takes one hit to
destroy them in World One, two hits in World two, three hits in
World Three, and four hits in World Four upwards. Big baddies take
six hits in World One, eight in World Two, ten in World Three and
twelve hits in World Four and above.
</P>

<P>
PEACE BONUS: Completing a scene without throwing any eggs gives a
bonus of 10,000 points, double world points and doubles the egg
bonus.
</P>

<P>
EGG BONUS: Collecting the fruits and completing a scene gives an
egg bonus. Each fruit is worth one to six fruit points (red = 1,
purple = 6). In World One you need four fruit points for an egg
bonus, in World Two you need six fruit points, in World Three you
need eight fruit points and in World Four and above you need ten
fruit points for an egg bonus.
</P>

<P>
GEM BONUS: Collecting all six gems gives a gem bonus which starts
at 10,000 points and doubles each time you get it. The gem bonus
resets to 10,000 points when you die.
</P>
