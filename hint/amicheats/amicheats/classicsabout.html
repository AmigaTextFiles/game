<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>About Ami Cheats</H1>
</FONT>

<P>
This site contains cheats, level codes, solves, etc, <STRONG>for
Amiga Classic computer games</STRONG>. While some of the games
herein are also available for other systems (MS-DOS, Windoze, Mac,
etc.) the cheats for those versions may be different than the ones
listed here.
</P>

<P>
This site is the result of a collection i started in 1986.
A lot of the cheats are old and i don't remember where i got
them. My main sources have been magazines, local BBS's, working
them out myself, newsgroups, fido net, and more recently contributors.
To find out more about the author of this site check out

<P>
This site was 100% made with Amiga computer hardware and software.
It conforms to the HTML standards. I don't believe in using any
extensions since they defeat the purpose of defining a platform
independent standard.

<P>
If you have any questions, site design suggestions, or know of any
Amiga cheats, level codes, hints or solutions that are not on the
site please e-mail them to:

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>HOW THIS WORKS</H2>
</FONT>

<P>
You'll find an alphabet stream at the bottem. These letters
are links to indexes of all the game titles beginning with that
letter. There are also links to this page, an index of the entire
site and a page of Amiga game links. In the indexes some game names
have been shortened with abbreviations or dropping words in order to
make their lengths more manageable. The games full names are used
in the cheat pages. Click on the letter of the title your looking
for then the name of the title. Once you find the game your looking
for follow the directions listed there. I find it's best to write
down, save or print out a games cheats.
</P>

<P>
If a cheat doesn't work it may be that my source for that cheat is
wrong, you didn't do it correctly, or it only works with some
versions of the game. Some games have cheats for more than one
version listed. In some cases more than one game has the same
name. In these cases you'll see the production companies name in
brackets.
