Hi ! I am a married 31 year old male with one son that lives near
<A HREF="http://www.city.windsor.on.ca/index.html"> Windsor</A>,
<A HREF="http://www.gov.on.ca/MBS/english/index.html"> Ontario</A>,
<A HREF="http://canada.gc.ca/main_e.html"> Canada</A>. I started using
computers at about the age of 5 with a Commodore Vic-20. It was just
a game machine to me, but then i moved up to the Commodore-64 which
i programmed to death. In the mid-80's i got my first Amiga and it
was love at first mouse click. At first the Amiga was a graphics and 
sound toy, now i also do some programming. Through extensive reading,
friends, use and work i've also become adept with DOS and Windoze
computer platforms.

Of coarse, computers aren't my only interest. I also enjoy working
out, sci-fi, volley ball, the outdoors, reading, and learning
everything i can about everything. I do a great deal of reading
about computers and any sort of scientific topic, whether it be,
astronomy, partical physics, relativity, quantum mechanics, geology,
archeology, meteorology, phsycology, etc... etc... I'd also like to
note that the internet, and specifically the World Wide Web, has
greatly increased my ability to find new and wonderful topics to
learn about.

This site was 100% made with Amiga computer hardware and software.
It conforms to the HTML standards. I don't believe in using any
extensions since they defeat the purpose of defining a platform
independant standard.
