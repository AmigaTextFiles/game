                            Sundog SOLUTION

By ???  Edited by PARASITE.


              If you are going to make a try for solving Sundog, it's
         best to create a new character.  When buying abilities, take
         a lot of Charisma and Luck...it helps when avoiding the
         'nasties' who plague the game.  To conserve as many of your
         hard-earned credits as possible, replace all the missing or
         broken pieces in your ship as possible with shunts.  Certain
         pieces are un-shuntable, so some purchasing is necessary.

              Then, fill up on fuel and repair your ship, but don't
         buy auxiliary fuel, as this will take up space in your cargo
         hold.  Take out all your money from the Bank.  Buy a lot of
         extra food (don't over-do it though) and store it throughout
         the numerous lockers aboard your ship.  Now you should Warp
         over to Woremed, where they have the best illegal equipment
         credits can buy.  If you don't know how to warp yet, then
         don't use these hints...get familiar with the game first, or
         see HavokHintz #su0094.

              Once on Woremed, peek in the Bank and see if there is
         any more dough stashed there...a litle more money couldn't
         hurt.  Find a bar, and ask the bartender for Information
         about Buying a Cloaker and then a Ground Scanner.  Replace a
         Cryofuse in the force shield with the Cloaker, and replace a
         Scanner in Pilotage with the Ground Scanner.  The Ground
         scanner lets you see a few cities missing from your maps as
         well as get to them, and the Cloaker makes you invisible when
         your shields are on.

              Start your wheelings and dealings on Woremed...might as
         well, since you happen to be there already.  Buy as much as
         you can, and fly to another city by selecting Navigate and
         choosing City To City.  Sell, everything you have, because
         this is the only way for you to get credits to finance your
         mission.  Check to see if the warehouse has any Cryogens, and
         take note of whatever else is there too.  Don't buy any goods
         now, but collect the Cryogens and take them back to Jondd.
         One of your last actions should be to to pick up all the cash
         that is left on Woremed...there are other means of banking,
         but direct cash transactions are easier and less bothersome.
         If you don't take your dough with you, then you won't have
         anything at all back on Jondd.

              Once you get back to Jondd, buy a LOT of food, which you
         will need while travelling in the wilderness.  Leave Drahew,
         and hunt around for 'The Lost Colony', known as Banville
         Center.  Once found, your Ground Scanner will store its
         position in memory, and you will be able to land there
         directly.  Visit their warehouse, and find out which goods
         they need.  Remember to store your cryogens there, too.

              From here on, it's just a matter of finding where the
         goods Banville Center needs.  Just keep flying around picking
         up credits and the needed goods.

              However, a certain 'low class' element also roams the
         spaceways...pirates!  When faced with pirates (you will hear
         the alarm, believe me) select Tactical.  The least damaging
         (to you) method of dealing with the buccaneers of the
         spaceways is to wait for them to close in (your ship is
         moving...remember that) and try to Communicate.  Refuse to
         deal with them, and Bluff.  This usually doesn't work, so if
         not, select Cloaker from the menu, which will make you
         effectively invisible.   When the pirates reach the center of
         the screen, they will warp off, and shut off the Cloaker as
         fast as possible...its a real gas guzzler.  The pirates will
         leave you alone if your cargo hold is empty, or carrying
         cryogens.

              If you are the more agressive type, and hate to see
         these pirates walk all over you, then you'll want to pick up
         on Woremed a Concentrator and an Autoslew.  Put the
         Concentrator in your gun panel, and the Autoslew in the
         tactical panel.  However, pirates don't work alone as a rule,
         but you do...they have the advantage on number, so don't push
         your luck.  If you feel like a fight once in a while, then go
         ahead, but don't make it a habit.
