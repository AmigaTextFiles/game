STORY
Not having seen the movie, the following storyline is from a review.
The Navy SEALs are a special commando unit of the US Navy. One of their
helicopters has been shot down over the Gulf and the pilots captured by a
bunch of Arab terrorists (Iraqis of course).  A team of five Navy SEALs storm
their HQ to rescue their friends and destroy the Arab's collection of lethal
Stinger missiles.
You start in Oman harbour, sneaking around killing Arabs and setting time
bombs on the Stinger missile crates (handily marked with the stars and
stripes) and progress through the levels to Beirut, where you rescue the
hostages and go on to destroy the massive cache of Stingers in the city.

End.
