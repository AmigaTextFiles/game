FLYING THE MISSIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SPITFIRE
~~~~~~~~
"SNEAKERS"
 As you patrol at 19,000 ft, Dover CHL radar station has detected several
groups of incoming German bombers flying at low level.Your VIC has just
been vectored to intercept them as your radio crackles to life again to
warm of small of formations of enemy fighters at high altitude.

"SPOILER"
 The He 111s just taking off from Wissant airfield in France have a nasty 
supprise coming..as part of a particulary aggressive Spitfire squadron,you
and your mates decide to take your patrol a little farther out this morning.
Before you know it,you're over the coast of France and you've spotted a 
formation of German bombers as they begin their takeoff roll.This raid would
be a piece of cake were it not for the group of Bf 110s flying escort.

"DODODOWN" Designed by Wayne Cline
 You and two buddies take off from Hawkinge airfield on an alert from Fighter
Command .. a large group of German bombers is forming up over Calais. You are
on the offensive as you reach the coast of France and that some of the bombers
are still taxiing on the ground! Watch out for enemy fighter cover.

"PANIC"
 Ventnor radar has detected a large formation of German aircraft,most likely
Ju 87 Stukas,heading directly for a small convoy located SE of the Isle of 
Wight.You and your wingman scrambled from Warmwell airfild,and were to
renderzvous with other British fighters,but they were diverted to higher
priority areas to East.Intercept the oncoming storm of enemy aircraft before
they hit the convoy.

"GOODHVNZ"
 As you and your wingman patrol at 6,000 ft,Bf 110s approach to bomb Debden
airfield and the Hurricane factory at Langley.You've got enough time to 
intercept them,but their Bf 109 escorts will certainly make your job much
more difficult!.

HURRICANE
~~~~~~~~~
"BOUNCE"
 Oh,boy! A gaggle of Stukas just ripe for the picking..off that is.Follow
your Flight leader as he goes in to bounce the bombers,but watch out for
the Bf 109s flying top cover.And if you let any of the Stukas get
away,there are some people in Ventnor who'll be mighty upset!

"HURRI-UP"
 Dover radar reports a formation of enemy aircraft heading North from Calais,
Fighter Command has ordered a scramble from Manston to intercept the Germans,
but it's not known whether their target is Dover radar or the convoy in the 
Channel.

"123PUNCH"
 This in not a pretty sight...several groups of Ju88s are incoming toward
two industrial military targets and a radar station.Earlier attempts to 
intercept this attack were thwarted by heavy fighter escort,and there are
still some Bf 110s flying with the bombers.Your small flight of Hurricans
is all that remains to stop the raid.

"HEVYRAIN"
 South coast radar has detected small scattered formations of German bombers
approaching the area of Tangmere and points East.You and your wingman have
been vectored to intercept the closest of these groups.You'll have to handle
each group very quickly to prevent them from hitting their intended targets.
Watch for Bf 109s escorting.

BF 109 E
~~~~~~~~
"SWEEP1" Designed by Steve Smith.
 On a fighter sweep,you and your novice wingman encounter more than your
share of trouble Five Spitfires,with reinforcements coming  constantly,
challenge you to a duel and you have no choice but to accept,Destroy as many
enemy fighters as you can.

"JIM2" Designed by Vaclav Ujuk
 You and four other Bf 109s fly escort for a group of three Ju88s as they
attack the Dover CHL radar station.It's a good thing you've got some friendly
company on this mission,because you may encounter as many as 37 Hurraines!

"NITERAID" Designed by William W.Burns.
 Navigating by the light of a full moon,you are part of a daring mission to
bomb and strafe a pair  of targets along the Southeastern coast of England.
Along with three other Bf 109 E-4Bs, you'll hit Dover radar station,then
Hawkinge airfield.Protect your wingman from prowling Spitfires,and pick up 
and pick up and any ground targets they miss.

"DAVYJONZ"
 You and a wingman take off from Campagne-Guines to escort three pairs of
Bf 110s on a bombing mission to destroy a convoy,Reconnaissance reports many
enemy fighters patrolling the area..this convoy must be carrying something
valuable to warrant so much attention!

"AUDACITY"
 As a new member of the elite JG26 squadron you feel obligated to impress
your more experienced comrades.Mounting a camera onto your E4B,you take off
and find a suitable target just to goad the British into a fight.Tangmere
airfield seems a likely hotspot.After bombing.After bombing one of the 
hangers there,duke it out with the Spits and Hurri's that pursue you.Then
be sure to make it safely back to your home airfield so you can show off
your exploits on film.

BF 110 C-4
~~~~~~~~~~
"LORDHAHA" Designed by Roger Besaw
 (Winner of the 1990 Tournament)
 On a (hopefully) low profile,deep penetration mission,your orders are to
bomb Stanmore Fighter Command HQ. The object of this mission is not only
to damage Fighter Command's HQ but also to put a dent in British morale.
You can bet you'll meet plenty of resistance,but if you get in and out
quickly,you'll probobly survive.

"SUICIDE" Designed by Lawrence Holland
 You must have been crazy to accept this assignment! Piloting a lone Bf 110,
you are to fly accross the Channel and bomb the Dover CHL radar station.
Your timing could have been better as there are numberous enemy fighter groups
on patrol in the same areas you'll be flying through,Good Luck! 

"UCANDOIT"
 You and a wingman are to escort two flights of Ju87 dive bombers Northward
from their base at Cherbourg to attack a British convoy.Watch for
intercepting enemy fighters at any point along the flight patch.Once the
Stukas have sucessfully bombed their target,you are to fly Eastward,back to
you home base at Lille,(HINT: You can potentially earn more points if you
actually fly all the way back home.)

JU 87 STUKA
~~~~~~~~~~~
"TOUGH2" Designed by Steve Piotrowski
 For some reason,you've been sperated from the rest of your flight.But like
any good soldier,you push on to complete your mission:to bomb the Ventnor
CHL radar station.Unfortunately without any friendly planes around,you're
quite vulnerable to attacks by British fighters...sure hope you dont run
into any!

"STUKAMAN"
 On a mission that would challenge any Stuka pilot,you must not only dive
bomb the Spitfire factory at Southampton,but also act as escort for the four
other Ju87s flying this mission with you.Keep your eyes peeled on the way
home for enemy fighters..they'll jump at the chance for an easy Stuka kill.

DO 17Z-2
~~~~~~~~
"DODOBIRD"
 Fly in a tight formation of four Dorniers to bomb the Pobjoy Stirling
bomber factory.You'll have two Bf109 escorts,but this is only their fourth
flight as fighter pilots,so dont expect too much help from them.Spitfires
are everywhere,so you'll want to stay in tight formation as much as possible
to maximize the effectiveness of your group's combined firepower.

HE 111 H-3
~~~~~~~~~~
"ESPIONAJ" Designed by William W.Burns
 On one of the most important missions never to happen in World War II,you
are to land at Tangmere airfield at night to pick up a high level spy who
has captured the secret of British radar (yes,you'll have to use your 
imagination) As you make a power-off landing at Tangmere,you insturct your
gunners to strafe the Spitfires parked on the ground.Taxi past the hangers
just long enough to let your passenger jump aboard,then take off to the East
to bomb Poling and Tangmere,and then escort you for the remainder of your
mission. Good Luck!

"CLEANUP"
 In the afternoon of Adler Tag,you and your flight leader are on the tail end
of a raid to knock out radar installations along the Southeastern coast of
England.As you fly Southwestward along  the coast,watch each radar site to
see if any of the buildings there were missed by previous bomber
attacks.Also watch for enemy fighters being vectored to your area.

JU 88 A-1
~~~~~~~~~
"WHAM-BAM"
 Follwo your flight leader in to dive bomb the airfield at Martlesham.Since
there are three buildings to hit,and only two of you, you'll have to watch
him to see which structure he targets.You've only got one Bf109 escort,but
he's supposed to be one of the best .Still there will probably by heavy 
resistance,so be alert on both your attack run and the trip home.
