                    PART 2 THE SCRIBBLE! OVERVIEW
                             INTRODUCTION

   Welcome to the SCRIBBLE! Overview. In this section of the manual,
we are going to cover material about the program in a topical manner.
If you're looking for a command-by-command breakdown of the program,
that's contained in the SCRIBBLE! Reference Guide (part 3 of the
manual). Someone who has not used a word processor before today should
probably make certain they have gone through the SCRIBBLE Tutorial
before beginning here. The Tutorial will acquaint you with the basics
or writing with a word processor.

   SCRIBBLE! is a powerful full featured word processing program that
will help you produce beautifully formatted reports and documents. You
can use SCRIBBLE! to write memos, letters, reports or as an adjunct to
OnLine! (our popular Amiga terminal program) to create script files.

   A word processor is not just a fancy electric typewriter. The real
value of a word processor is in the two step process between creating
(typing) the document and storing it on electronic media (disks) and
the completion (printing) of the document. Because the document is not
printed as you type it, you have the opportunity to edit and revise it
before putting it on paper.

2-1
   With a typewriter, you are forced to re-type the entire document or
at least the page. The word processor's electronic file can be easily
edited with just a few keystrokes. The printer can then print out the
corrected version in a matter of minutes, no longer demanding the
writer's attention.

TWO STEPS TO A FINISHED DOCUMENT

   *Writing. Documents are created using SCRIBBLE! and your computer.
As each key is pressed, the character is displayed on the screen and
stored in your computer's memory. When you have completed typing your
document, the contents of memory (which is temporary storage) can be
stored on disk (for more permanent storage and later recall).

   *Printing. Printing is a separate process that involves taking your
document and sending it to the printer according to formatting
instructions that control margins, line spacing, pagination, special
printing features, underlines, etc. The final printed document may
look very different from the original version displayed on your
screen. As a matter of face, a single document can be generate a wide
range of printed documents depending upon the formatting and printing
instructions used.

2-2
WRITING A DOCUMENT

   Before you can write a document, you must start up the program. To
do this, either select the SCRIBBLE! icon from the Workbench screen or
type "SCRIBBLE!" at the CLI prompt and press RETURN. (If you're
running the program from CLI, make sure that your current directory is
the one which contains the SCRIBBLE! program file.)

   In either case, the disk drive will activate for a few moments
while the program loads. When SCRIBBLE has been loaded, a large blank
window appears wit  a cursor in the upper left hand corner. At the
bottom of the screen is a second window that functions as a status box
to show you the location of the cursor, various edit modes, and other
indicators.  You can begin typing.

2-3

   Look what happened when you get close to the end of the line.
SCRIBBLE! wraps the words around to the next line. This is an
important difference between a typewriter and a word processor. You
only use carriage returns when you end a line in the middle of the
page. (Like this line.)

   Go ahead and type some more.  Notice that when you do press the
RETURN key a paragraph a symbol appears. The symbol will not appear in
your printed document. It is only there to show you on the screen
where you have forced an end of line. As you type, notice that there
are a number of special purpose keys on your keyboard to help you type
fast and more accurately. The arrow keys position the cursor, which

2-4
is the reverse video block you see on the screen. This is a very
important item, since much of the "action" in word processing takes
place at the current cursor position. (When you type, this is where
the characters will appear, etc.) Following is a complete list of the
keys and their functions:

     KEY       FUNCTION

     ESC       Moves the cursor to the start of the current line.
     TAB       Moves the cursor to the next user defined tab
               stop. These default to position 6, 11 and every
               10 characters thereafter.
     CTRL      Used in combination with other keys to engage
               cursor motion commands.
     ALT       Used in combination with other keys to produce
               SCRIBBLE! commands (i.e., ALT-L will delete the
               current line of text).
     SHIFT     Used in combination with other keys to produce
               special commands (e.g. SHIFTed arrows move the
               cursor farther than unshifted and SHIFT-F10 will
               turn on the "background").
     F1        Displays an "editor help" screen that lists the
               various command keystrokes and their function.
     F2        Displays a "dot command help" screen that lists
               the various dot commands that can be used on
               format lines.

2-5
     KEY       FUNCTION

     F3        Centers the current line.
     F4        The "instant save" function. This stores the
               current document in memory into the same file
               that it was loaded from. (This filename is
               displayed following "Project on the status line).
     F5        If you are using multiple edit windows, pressing
               this key will bring the next edit window to the
               front (i.e make it visible).
     F6        Toggles the boldface character mode.
     F7        Toggles the underline character mode.
     F8        Toggles the italics character mode.
     F9        This is the "action" key. It is used at various
               times by different operations. It functions as a
               signal to SCRIBBLE!. One time it might anchor the
               cursor during a block definition, another time it
               might tell SCRIBBLE! to find the next occurrence
               of a search string, etc.
     F10       Opens and closes the "insert block" to facilitate
               rapid insertion of large amounts of text.
     DEL       Deletes the character under the cursor.

2-6
     KEY       FUNCTION

     BS        (Backspace) Moves the cursor one location to the
               left, and will delete the character previously
               in that location.
     A         (Right Amiga Key) Used in combination with certain
               letters, this key emulates some of the more common
               menu commands.

   The arrow keys are used to move the cursor around the document.
Their functions are divided into normal, shifted, and ALT operations.
To obtain a shifted or ALT function, hold the SHIFT or ALT key down
and press the arrow.

   Left             Move cursor one character to the left.
   Right            Move cursor one character to the right.
   Up               Move cursor one line toward the top of
                    document.
   Down             Move cursor one line toward the bottom of
                    the document.
   Shift-Left       Move cursor to the first character of
                    document ("home").
   Shift-Right      Move cursor to the last character of
                    document ("end").
   Shift-Up         Move cursor one page toward the top of the
                    document.

2-7
   Shift-Down       Move cursor one page toward the bottom of
                    the document.
   ALT-Left         Move cursor to the start of the current line.
   ALT-Right        Move cursor to the end of the current line.
   ALT-Up           Move cursor to the first line of the current
                    window.
   ALT-Down         Move cursor to the last line of the current
                    window.

PRINTING A DOCUMENT

   Before you can print a document with SCRIBBLE!, you need to use the
Preferences tool supplied by AmigaDOS to configure for your printer.
If you are not sure how to use Preferences, consult your Amiga user's
manual for details.

   A portion of the Preferences printer configuration allows you to
set margins for your printer. To work with SCRIBBLE!, you need to set
the the left margin to 1 and the right margin to 255. In this manner,
you assure that Preferences will not start wrapping lines (reserving
this for SCRIBBLE!).

   Once you have used Preferences to set up for your printer, you are
ready to print out a document. Obviously, you must first either load
some text from a disk file or type some in from the edit mode. When
the text is in the window and you're ready to print,

2-8
select the Printer subcommand of the Go command on the Print menu
(i.e., Print Go Printer). Your printout will begin immediately. NOTE:
What you do when you printer is not on the list supported by
Preference? At the end of this overview section, there is information
for advanced uses of SCRIBBLE!. We'll cover this in there.

ARCHIVING DOCUMENT FILES

   In order to store documents for future reference, you need to store
them on disk. How do you do this? Well, first you should select the
Archive Documents command of the Project menu. When the Archive
Requester appears, it will be displaying all of the files in the
currently logged directory. If this is not the drive you wish to store
the file on, select the Dir icon and enter the new drive and/or
directory name. (for example, if DF0: was the currently logged
directory, and you wanted to store the file in a directory on drive 1
called DOC-FILES, you would select the Dir icon and enter ("DF:1DOC-
FILES") when the requester appeared).

   Once you have the correct drive and/or directory selected, all you
need to do is select the Store icon. Enter the name of the file you
are saving. Since you chose Archive Documents instead of Archive
Document,

2-9
SCRIBBLE! will add the pattern ".doc" to the end of the filename for
us. Archive Documents also displays only those files with the ".doc"
pattern in them. This is a convenient way to keep your document files
segregated on a crowded disk.

ARCHIVING NON-DOCUMENT FILES

   If you use SCRIBBLE! to write a Script (.scp) file or other non-
document file for an application using a specific pattern in its
files, you'll need to use the Archive General command, instead of the
Archive Document command, and specify the pattern yourself, otherwise
the other application program may not be able to locate it.

   For example, if you write a script file for OnLine!, you would
select Archive General, make sure that you had specified the correct
drive and directory, and then select Store. When SCRIBBLE! prompted
you for a filename, you'd enter the filename with a ".scp" pattern at
the end (i.e., RBBS,scp).

CHECKING THE STATUS OF SCRIBBLE! DEFAULTS

   The Status command on the Project menu displays the current
defaults. These are the areas that will affect both the appearance of
the editor and the final

2-10
printing of the document. It is a good idea to always check the status
of the defaults before printing, especially if you do not begin your
document with a format line that sets them properly. You can also type
Amiga-S to view the current defaults (not to be confused with ALT-S,
which deletes all spaces from the cursor to the next non-space
character.

     | Page Length:          66             |
     | Page Offset:           0             |
     | Top Margin:            6             |
     | Bottom Margin:         6             |
     | Line Margin:          65   |    |    |
     | Justification:     Flush   | OK |    |
     | Characters Used:       0             |
     | Characters Free:   65322             |
     | Word Count:            0             |
     | Page Count:            1             |

   Select the gadget labelled "OK" to return to your edit window.

ERASING A DOCUMENT FROM THE SCREEN

   To erase the current document from memory, select the Erase command
on the Project menu. You will be asked to select Yes or No as a fail
safe precaution prior to erasing the document. When you verify the

2-11
Erase command, the screen will clear as the current document is
discarded. The blank screen is proof that you should never erase a
document that you have not stored onto a disk unless you are quite
certain that you will have no further need for it.

GETTING A DOCUMENT FROM ARCHIVE

   Select the Archive Document command on the Project menu. It will be
displaying the default drive and directory, and if this is not the
drive or directory that contains the file, use the Dir icon until you
see the filename you want to load on the screen.  Point to the
filename and click the left mouse bottom. The file should highlight.
Now all you do is select Get.

| Dir: Current                        Pattern *.doc             |

2-12
LEAVING SCRIBBLE! (QUIT)

   Leaving SCRIBBLE! is a two-step process. First, you must either
select the Quit command on the Project menu or type Amiga-Q. This
action will bring up a requester asking you to make SURE you want to
Quit. If you have saved any document currently in memory, you may
select Yes and exit SCRIBBLE!.

   CHANGING YOUR DEFAULT VALUES

   SCRIBBLE! lets you reprogram certain default characteristics such
as line length, ink and paper colors, justification, and margins.
These are all accomplished with the Default menu.

   The first option on this menu is Archive. This works in a similar
manner to Project Archive, except that it is loading and saving
"format files" instead of documents. These format files, which have
".fmt" at the end of their filenames, will remember each and every
setting you have specified with the Default menu commands. Later, you
can reload one of these files to instantly reconfigure SCRIBBLE!.

   SCRIBBLE will look for the file SCRIBBLE!.fmt in the current
directory when it powers up. If it is there, the values contained in
it will be loaded and used. It does not HAVE to be present. SCRIBBLE!
does have your favorite configuration as the new default.

2-13
TEXT JUSTIFICATION

   This can be controlled two ways. First, there is a command on the
Default menu which can engage right hand margin justification (both
margin smooth). This will also turn on justification for the display.
The program will add "soft spaces" on the screen to fill out each line
until the margins are smooth.

   To see these spaces, you can turn on the special "background"
display by typing Shift-F10. This shows all the spaces on the screen
that you did not type with the space bar as a reverse video "hash".
You can use this to see how many spaces are really at the end of a
line, or to see the soft spaces inserted into a line when
justification is on.

   This can be very useful when editing those lines. You see, if you
should happen to overtype a soft space with a regular one, SCRIBBLE!
can no longer add and subtract it as needed to keep the line smooth.
It will stay there permanently. By turning on the background you can
see the soft spaces and steer clear of them. In addition, there is a
command to temporarily remove the soft space from a line while you're
editing it. Typing ALT-R will make the soft space disappear until you
move the cursor off the line.

   In addition to the Default Justify menu command, there are a
sequence of dot commands that can be used in format lines to further
control text justification.

2-14
   A complete list of dot commands appears later in this section, but
the justification commands are:

     JU   Justification on or off.  This is a duplicate of the
          Default Justify menu command, and will override the
          current status of the command (i.e. you can have
          justification on the screen, and edit the document
          that way, but if you have a ".JU=N" command on a
          format line in the document, there will be no
          justification).

     FR   Engages "flush right" justification, in which text is
          printed smooth to the right hand margin, but ragged to
          the left. This is used when you want to set some text
          against the right hand margin (e.g. a date in a letter,
          or some numbers in columns.

     HI   Hanging indent. This command sets a column position
          where the text should begin when the PROGRAM wraps a
          line. If the line is ended manually, this does not
          take effect. Only when a line is wrapped by the program
          will this indent be used. This is useful in creating
          "bullet" paragraphs.

   The first two of the dot commands listed above are either on or
off. The parameters they accept are "Y" and "N" (e.g. JU=Y or FR=N).
The third is a column position, and as such is specified with a
numeric value (HI=10).

2-15
LINE LENGTH AND HORIZONTAL SCROLLING

   A full size SCRIBBLE edit window can display 76 characters on a
line. We make the distinction of "full sized" because you can use the
sizing gadget to shrink a window (as in the case of multiple windows
visible at the same time).

   Should your line length be greater than the number of characters
that will fit on the screen SCRIBBLE! will not be able to show you all
of the characters on the line at one time.  In these cases, horizontal
scrolling will automatically take place. Also, the proportional scroll
gadget at the bottom of the edit window can be used in displaying the
text not visible on the line.

   If your line length is LESS than the number of characters SCRIBBLE!
can display on a line, the program will automatically center your text
in the window. This does not mean that the extra margins will print on
the page. It is merely visual aesthetics.

   Line length can be adjusted from within your document with the LL
(Line Length) dot command (e.g. LL=55). This is useful when you need
to temporarily shorten the line length, as with an inset paragraph, or
when you want to edit the document with a line length OTHER than the
one you wish to print with. However, to have your line breaks
displayed properly, you should set the display line length to the same
value as your printed line length.

2-16
SETTING TABS:

   SCRIBBLE! features user definable tab positions. Even though these
do not show of the screen, you can still adjust them. If you use the
Default Tabs command, SCRIBBLE! will prompt you for a list of column
positions for the tab stops. For specific details look up this command
in the Reference Guide.

   Tab stops will be saved in the format files, so you should only
have to enter them once.

DISPLAY COLORS

   SCRIBBLE! is a Workbench compatible application, and as such uses
the four display colors defined for your copy of Workbench by
Preferences. However, you can decide what combination of colors to use
for the text (Ink) and background (Paper).

   As you change the colors with Preferences, the colors within
SCRIBBLE! will also change. The current color settings will be saved
in your format files.

   Many people find that changing colors in each window makes working
with multiple windows much more convenient and less mistake prone.

SETTING UP THE DEFAULT PAGE SIZE

   There are several commands on the Default menu that are used in
defining the default page size. One of

2-17
these is Line Length, which has already been covered. The others are
contained as sub-options under the Print command of the Default menu.

   The Page Length option lets you tell SCRIBBLE! how many lines long
each page should be. The default value is 66, which is standard for an
11 inch page with a line spacing of 6 lines per inch. Unless you are
printing on some other size paper, or with some other line spacing,
you should not change this value.

   The Page Offset value tells SCRIBBLE! how many spaces to print at
the start of each line when it's printing out your document. This will
not show on the screen, since it is only of value when printing out
hardcopy. In some applications, you many want to indent more on one
page than the next (the logical application here is printing text that
will be copied on two sided paper). To help with this, you can use the
dot commands EO (Even Offset) and OO (Odd Offset) to set a separate
page offset for even and odd numbered pages.

   The other two options of the Default Print command that affect page
layout are Top Margin and Bottom Margin. This are the number of lines
SCRIBBLE! will skip at the top and bottom of each page. This is used
to prevent the program from printing on the perforation of fanfold
paper or skip down over letterhead. The number of lines actually
USABLE on a page can be calculated by subtracting the top and bottom
margins from the Page Length.

2-18
   Once you have told SCRIBBLE! how long the page is, how long your
lines are, and how many lines you will be skipping for top and bottom
margins, it has a pretty clear picture of how big your page is. It
will use this in calculating the "current page" number that is shown
in the status window. If you use dot commands in your text that can
alter the page breaks at print time (HI - Hanging Indent, and CP -
Conditional Page are two good examples), the current page indicator
may not be accurate. In those cases, use the ALT-J command to jump to
the next printed page break.

  You can also define a setup string that will be sent to the printer
before any text. Remember that if you are using the normal SCRIBBLE!
printer routines, this will be sent via the Preferences printer drive,
so this setup code should be something that IT will understand. If you
are using the "print to file" function and printing directly to the
parallel port (i.e. printing to PAR:), then the string and all other
data will be sent to the printer untranslated.

CARRIAGE RETURNS, LINE FEEDS, AND OTHER FORMATS

   SCRIBBLE! places a paragraph symbol in the text wherever you press
RETURN. You can decide what this paragraph symbol will be when the
file is stored to disk. You may choose between a carriage return, a
line feed, or a carriage returned followed by a line feed.

2-19
   Standard Amiga text file format is a line feed, and this is the
power up default. However, a file that will be uploaded to a bulletin
board or information network will likely need a carriage return
followed by a line feed.

   When SCRIBBLE! loads a file, it looks at the text to see what
format was used when the file was stored on the disk. It then moves
the check mark for you, so that you can load, edit, and save a
document without changing the format and without altering it.

   If you WANT to alter the format of a document, just use the Default
Format command and move the check mark to a new location.

   You'll probably want to store your most commonly used format as
part of your default format file.

CHANGING WORDS AND PHRASES THROUGHOUT A DOCUMENT

   After writing a memo or report, you may have the misfortune of
finding out that Mr. "Smith" spells his name "S-M-I-T-H-E". With a
word processor, the change is easy, involving only two steps.

   First tell SCRIBBLE! what to search for. Select the Search command
on the Text menu. You will be asked to enter the character string to
find. Enter

2-20
"Smith". Immediately the cursor moves to the first location of Smith.
If all you want to do is "find" the various locations of Smith, you
can repeat the process by clicking the left mouse button or pressing
the F9 function key.

   To "change" the various occurrences of Smith to Smithe, go back and
select the Replace command on the Text menu. SCRIBBLE! asks you to
enter the change string (what you want the string to have found
earlier to be changed into). Enter "Smithe".

   SCRIBBLE! will search out every occurrence of Smith and prompt to
see if you want to change it into Smithe. Note the Search and Replace
commands are case dependent. If you instruct SCRIBBLE! to search for
"this", it will not find "This".

   Also note that a Search and/or Replace operation advance from the
top of the document down each time you run it. If you are planning on
searching for a string skipping the first few occurrences, and then
starting to replace it, you should define the Search string and then
immediately go into the Replace mode and use the Next option to skip.

   All you need do now is click the left mouse button or press the F9
function key to replace the "next" occurrence, which will be the
string you are currently positioned over.

2-21
USES FOR SEARCH AND REPLACE

   The Search command can be used in a mail list or catalog (if you
have typed in all of the information as a document file) to locate
individual records and files. For example, you could look for a
particular zip code in a mailing list, or a phone number, occupation,
etc. Unlike a file management program, there is no need to design a
special file. Just select Search and enter the string of characters
you are searching for.

   Remember that SCRIBBLE! is literal and case dependent. Make sure
that you have spelled the string properly and capitalized it just the
way it appears in the document. (Sometimes, if you are searching for a
word that may or may not be capitalized, you can omit the first
character. For example, search for "eturn" to find "return" and
"Return".)

BLOCK OPERATIONS: CUT, COPY, PASTE

   Performing a block operation in SCRIBBLE! is simple. First you tell
the program what sort of operation you would like to perform, and when
you tell it what text to perform the operation upon.

   There are three block operation commands on the Text menu. Cut is
used to delete text from one location and, if you wish, insert it at
another (with Paste). Copy is used to duplicate text from one

2-22
location in the document to another. And Paste is used to insert text
that has been cut or copied.

   When you select the type operation that you want your mouse pointer
will change shape and the "Action" indicator in the status window will
reflect the new mode. SCRIBBLE! will remain in this mode until
specifically told to return to the Edit mode.

   Once in the proper mode, it is a simple matter to define the text
you wish to operate upon. There are two methods, one using the mouse
and the other using the keyboard. You MUST use the keyboard method if
the text you wish to define is not completely displayed on the screen
at one time. If you can see all of the text you wish to operate on,
you can use the mouse.

   To define a block of text with the mouse, point at the start of the
block, press and hold the left mouse button, point at the end of the
block (which causes the text to highlight as you move), and release
the left mouse button. The block operation correct for the currently
engaged mode (Cut or Copy) will be performed as soon as you release
the mouse button.

   If you make a mistake when defining the block with the mouse and
you want to get out of the block definition sequence, just move the
mouse pointer off the edit window on the left hand or top borders. The
block definition will be instantly aborted and you can release the
left mouse button.

2-23
   Defining a block of text with the keyboard is equally simple. Move
the cursor to where you want the block to begin and press the F9
function key. Move the cursor to the end of the block, which will
cause the text to highlight as you move, and press RETURN. The
indicated block operation will be instantly performed.

   To delete a block of text, simply cut it and forget about it. If
you want to move the block, first you must cut it, and then select the
Paste mode. When you're in the paste mode either move the cursor to
where you want the block to be and press F9 or point with the mouse
(if you're moving it to a location on the screen currently) and click
the left button.

   Copying a block is identical, except that you must use the Copy
command instead of Cut. Copy just "takes a picture" of the text (which
is the reason for the mouse pointer taking on a camera shape). Then
when you use Paste and insert it somewhere else in the document,
you'll have two copies of the block.

   The block operation even work between windows. This is how you
would append two documents, for example. Load the first document into
window one, open a second window and load the second document into it.
Then either Cut or Copy the document in the second window and Paste it
into the first (or vice versa, depending on what you want to end up
with).

2-24
STYLING YOUR TEXT

   The same general rules apply when styling existing text. As you saw
in the list command keys covered earlier, you can change the style of
your text while you are typing it in by using the special function
keys assigned to this task. However, applying style to existing text
is another matter altogether.

   First, just as with block operations, you must define the style you
wish to apply. Select the Style command on the Text menu and a pop-out
menu appears with your choices listed on it. You may choose either
Plain or any combination of the other three. (This does mean that
Plain overrides the other settings.)

   Once you've defined what style to apply, the mouse pointer will
assume the shape of an artist's paint brush and the "Action" indicator
in the status window will read "Style". Now, just define the block you
want to style exactly as described above for the other block
operations.

   To remove all style from text that is already styled, you only need
to apply the Plain "style" to it. Plain is actually the absence of
other styles.

2-26
THE EDITOR'S TOOL BOX

   No word processor would be worth the disk it's stored on if it did
not include a host of text manipulation functions to make the job of
editing a document simpler.

   SCRIBBLE! offers you the ability to move, copy and delete marked
blocks of text. You can move quickly through a document, deleting and
inserting characters. Special printing functions like boldface and
underline are available, along with other advanced formatting
features.

   While many SCRIBBLE! functions utilize easy to operate menus, a
good number are also activated by keyboard commands. The flow of work
is made faster and more efficient by speeding the development of text
without distracting the user's attention to a menu. A number of
"transparent" commands are used for simple operations. They are
sometimes called "ALT commands", since they are activated by pressing
the ALT key, and while continuing to hold the ALT key, pressing one
additional key.

   Some commands use the "Amiga key" sequence, instead. This entails
pressing and holding the right hand Amiga key (the stylized A) and
typing the proper letter. Amiga keys are sued when the command is a
duplicate of a command found in the menu structure (such as Copy and
Paste). SCRIBBLE! provides these for many command menu commands.

2-26
   Look at the list of ALT key commands below:

     ALT D  Delete character under cursor
         E  Cursor to last line of document, but same column
         G  Imbed Printer control code
         I  Toggle the Insert/Overwrite modes of text entry
         J  Moves cursor to next (printed) page break
         L  Deletes the current line (permanently)
         P  Force new page
         Q  Quit changes to line
         R  Temporarily remove justified spaces from a line to
            allow better editing
         S  Delete all spaces up to the next non-space character
         T  Cursor to first line of document, but same column

2-27
PRINTING OUT YOUR DOCUMENTS AND FORMAT LINES

   If you wish to change the margins, spacing or other printer
characteristics temporarily, you can enter a format line into the body
of the text. A format line is any line which begins with a period
character. SCRIBBLE! will not print any of text on this line, but
rather scans the line for legal dot commands. A dot command is a two
letter command, an equals mark, and an argument (sometimes a value,
sometimes a Y/N switch). For example, to set a temporary left margin,
change the line length and active justification (which is something
you might do for an insert paragraph), you'd use the format line:

   .LM=10,LL=40,JU=Y

   Note that all three commands can be on the same line as long as
they are separated by commas.

   Remember that if this a temporary format, you must re-set to the
original specifications after the affected block. For example, you
might return to a format something like:

   .LM-0,LL=54,JU=N

   Dot commands will not alter the way the text looks on the display
screen. Only menu commands can do that. Dot commands will only be seen
when your text is actually printing (or when you use Print Preview).

2-28
IMBEDDING SPECIAL PRINTER CONTROL COMMANDS

   You can insert control characters to activate special print
characteristics that may be supported by your printer. Use the
following format:

  .#O/x=string of characters

   The "#O" tells SCRIBBLE! to use this code when it sees the ALT-G
symbol followed by a "O". The "x" is either O or 1 (1 means that the
string will produce a printed character, so justify it; O means that
the string is for printer control only). The string of characters can
be either (ASCH text or control characters (e.g. "A would send a CTRL-
A). Also allowed are decimal values, preceded by a percent sign (e.g,
%221 would send a 221 decimal). When reading decimal numbers, input
will be accepted until the next non-numeric digit (or for a maximum of
three digits, whichever happens first).

   Any ASCH character can be "programmed" into a document with this
feature following the insertion of the proper format line such as this
example.

   .#O/1=%175

   The "." tell SCRIBBLE! that a format line is coming. The #O tells
it that we are defining a code that will follow ALT-G, in this case
the numeral "O" (although it could be any between O and 9). The "/1"
tells you

2-29
that the 175 character will be a printable character; if you wish to
specify a non-printable control sequence such as superscript or
subscript, it should be followed by a "/O", that way it will not alter
text justification. The "%175" is the decimal equivalent of a
paragraph symbol on some printers. (Consult your printer manual for a
listing of characters and their decimal equivalents).

   Most printer manuals list the special characters on a reference
page. Usually each character is listed with its decimal, hexadecimal,
octal and sometimes binary code. SCRIBBLE! uses only the decimal
value.

   So in addition to the normal boldface, underline, and italic codes,
you can "program" ten more to be used at your discretion.

   If you are using a printer driver specified with the Preferences
tool, then you'll want to specify escape sequences that it understands
with these printer variables. (In other words, if you want to
superscript on your printer, instead of sending the code that makes
your printer superscript, send the code that makes Preferences
superscript on your printer.)

   The following list shows you what escape sequences Preferences
understands. Whether or not your printer driver supports this feature
is not assured. The Amiga ROM Kernal Manual, Volume 2, contains a list
of which printer drivers support which features, but that list is too
long to publish here. You can experiment

2-30
with trial and error to see which features work and which do not, if
you like:

   All of these sequences must be preceded by an ESCAPE (decimal 27).
This is VERY important!

   Some of the above list are duplicates of SCRIBBLE! functions. Where
this occurs, use the function built into SCRIBBLE!. Save these escape
sequences for things such as super/subscripting. And again, remember
that these are the escape sequences that Preferences knows and will
translate for your printer driver, if it accepts such codes. If a
function does not work with your printer, it is probably because the
printer driver supplied for your printer does not support it.

WHAT TO DO IF YOUR PRINTER IS NOT IN PREFERENCES

   It was obvious that many of you would not be using a printer that
Preferences supported a driver for. We therefore had SCRIBBLE! make
special provision to bypass the Preferences drivers altogether. In
these cases,

2-34
you must use printer variables to specify the printer control values
for YOUR printer (i.e. not from the table above).

   Instead of selecting Print Go Printer to begin your printout,
select Print Go File. When SCRIBBLE! prompts you for the filename to
print into, enter "PAR:" (minus the quotes). This is the name of the
parallel device. All data will then be sent to the printer completely
untranslated.

   It means that the on screen boldface, underline and italics cannot
be used, since these transmit Preferences escape sequences. And it
means that you cannot use the Print Forward feature, since this
assumes you will print to the normal printer device (PRT:). You'll
have to compensate by using the printer variables or deleting text
that has been already printed before.

   Hopefully, your printer will be among those listed in Preferences,
and you will not have these problems. But if you DO have the problems,
SCRIBBLE! should let you compensate.

FORMAT LINES FOR COMPLETE PRINTER CONTROL

   The following commands can be embedded into a document with format
lines. Remember, these format

2-35
lines will not be printed. They only control the way the document will
look.

   Note that format commands should be preceded by a period "." and
must be isolated on a line, not imbeded within a sentence, although
multiple commands may be placed on the same line, separated by commas.

     TEXT FORMATTING CODES

     .JU=Y/N   Begins justifying text
     .FR=Y/N   Begins printing flush right
     .HI=xx    Set hanging indent to "xx" column

   These codes are explained under the section "Text Justification",
covered earlier.

     SETTING SCRIBBLE! MARGINS

     .PO=xx    Set page offset (default 0)
     .EO=xx    Set even page offset (default 0)
     .OO=xx    Set odd page offset (default 0)
     .LM=xx    Set left margin (default 0)
     .RM=xx    Set right margin (default 65)
     .LL=xx    Set Line Length (default 65)
     .LS=xx    Set Line Spacing to 1
     .PN=xx    Begin page numbering with xx

     PRINTER CONTROLS AND MISCELLANEOUS

     .LF=Y/N   Line feeds after carriage returns
     ..text    Non-printing remark line
     .#x/x=ccc Define special print code

HEADER AND FOOTER FORMATS

   No word processor is complete without Headers (titles at the top of
the page) and Footers (titles at the bottom). SCRIBBLE! supports both.
Although it only allows a single line for a title, the format within
this line is most flexible with several built in convenience
functions.

   The symbol @ and # can be used to include the current date @ or
page number (#) within a title. When the @ symbol appears the result
is the date printed in the following format: DD-MON-YY.

   Here's a list of all the title commands (a title is a header or
footer), and some examples of how they work and what sort of output
they generate:

TITLE FORMAT
COMMAND             PRINT LOCATION

.HE Header          Top Margin
.FO Footer          Bottom Margin
.EH Even Header     Even Pages (Top Margin)
.OH Odd Header      Odd Pages (Top Margin)
.EF Even Footer     Even Page (Bottom Margin)
.OF Odd Footer      Odd Page (Bottom Margin)

2-37
   All these titles follow the same general format:

     .HE=Left/Center/Right

   Examples:

     .HE=@/Page #/SCRIBBLE!

   Header Results:

     11-MAY-86         Page 1          SCRIBBLE!

     .HE=//SCRIBBLE!

   Header Result:

                                        SCRIBBLE!

   Header Result:

   SCRIBBLE!

   .HE=/Page #/

   Header Result:

Page 1
2-38
   Footers work just like headers, except using ".FO" instead of
".HE". Also, if you boldface or underline part of the header/footer
text, then that portion of the header or footer will be boldfaced or
underlined when printed out.  However, take care not to apply any
special style to the format dot commands themselves. SCRIBBLE! will
not understand a boldfaced ".HE".

   SPECIAL PAGE CONTROL

     .SS=Y/N        Single Sheet paper used
     .HM=xx         Header Margin (xx lines)
     .FM=xx         Footer Margin (xx lines)
     .PL=xx         Physical Page Length (default 66)
     .PS=xx         Page spacing between pages (MB + MT)
     .MT=xx         Margin Top (default 6)
     .MB=xx         Margin Bottom (default 6)
     .CP=xx         Conditional Page (new page; <xx lines)

   Page Spacing (PS) is a combination of Margin Top and Margin Bottom.
Some people prefer to think in terms of Page Length (PL) - Page
Spacing (PS) = usable lines. If you choose to use this parameter, your
top margin will be set to 0 and the bottom margin to whatever value PS
is equal to.

   Conditional Page (CP) lets you tell SCRIBBLE! how many lines MUST
fit on the button of a page before it may start a paragraph on that
page. If, for example, CP is equal to "5", then SCRIBBLE! will check
to make sure that it can print at least 5 lines of each paragraph
before starting it on that page.

2-39
   Keep in mind that lines where you have manually pressed RETURN
(such as tables and columnar data), will be considered as separate
paragraphs. Sometimes this causes confusing results. This anti-orphan
feature is one of the dot commands that will cause the active page
indicator in the status window to be inaccurate. If you're using this
command, you may have to use ALT-J to correctly display your page
breaks.

PAGE LAYOUT

   Here's a diagram of a printed page and all the dot commands that
affect it:

|                                     | <- Top margin (MT)
|  Here's our Header!!                | <- Header (HR)
|                                     | <- Blank lines (HM)
|  Text of document                   |
|                                     |
|                                     |
|                                     | <- Blank lines (FM)
|                                     |
|  Here's our footer                  | <- Footer (FO)
|                                     |
|                                     | <- Bottom margin (MB)

   Just keep in mind that most of the time, the default values will
suit you just fine.  There is rarely a need to change items such as
the header and footer margins (HM and FM), which are the number of
lines printed

2-40
between the body of the text and the header or footers.

CONCLUSION

   This concludes the SCRIBBLE! Overview. In this section of the
manual, we've tried to tell you all of what you need to know about
SCRIBBLE!, from a bird's eye perspective. It's a lot of information,
but in time it will all make sense.

   The general flow of the text was designed to follow the menu
system. If you have questions, perhaps reading the next manual section
will answer them.

   This next section is the SCRIBBLE Reference Guide. This section of
the manual describes the entire command menu system, in command by
command order.
