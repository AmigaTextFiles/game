Introduction 
     
     MEAN 18 allows 1 to 4 people to play a round of golf at 
variety of famous and user designed golf course.  This is a great 
simulation of a classic game, combining a challenging blend of 
strategy and skill development.

COURSES

     The "course disk" contains ST. Andrews, Augusta and Pebble 
Beach, Bush Hill country club is included on the "program disk". 
All courses were designed using the COURSE ARCHITECT.

BACKUPS

     Since you will be able to modify your Mean 18 course disk 
using the  "COURSE ARCHITECT'. use the standard DOS procedure to 
make a backup fefore starting out.  The "program disk" is copy 
protected and is not copyable.  

GETTING STARTED

     Either run the game prg. to play or to make a new course 
run the Architect prg. ( Note! you may have to look for the 
Architect prg. in the root dir.)


                      PLAYING MEAN 18 GOLF

Selection Options

     At the bottom of the screen, you will be prompted to start a 
new game or resume a saved game.
If you resume a saved game, it will be restored and play will 
continue where you left off.
For a new game you will select the number of players from 1 to 4

SELECT SCORING:
     Stroke (Medal) - normal play for 1 to 4 players
     Match - 2 player - player who scores the best on holes wins
     Best Ball - 2 Teams - 4 players - lowest score for team wins 

For each player - Enter initials, professional\regulation tees, 
beginner/experienced.
Pro/reg tees: Each hole has 2 tees, pro is set futher back.
Beg/exp player: a beginner gets perfect aim and the caddy 
recommends the best club based on distance to the pin (you can 
change this club selection if desired). The experienced player 
must choose his own club and make more accurate shots.

BEGINNING PLAY:
     
     1. PRACTICE TEE - develop shot making skills with each club.
     2. PRACTICE GREEN - improve putting accuracy.
     3. PRACTICE A HOLE - play and hole.
     4. BEGIN GAME - start playing a round of 18 holes
     5. QUIT - ends the game.

ORDER OF PLAY:

     At the beginning of each hole, order of play is determined 
by honors, that is, which player or team won the previous hole.  
Once all players have teed off, the player farthest from the hole 
is always next.

MAKING A SHOT

     Use the ESC key at anytime to view available options.  Up 
and down arrow keys are used to change club selection.  Use left 
and right arrows to scroll the aim (a full 360 degree rotation is 
possible). "O" give you and Overhead view, "C" displays the 
scorecard, and "Q" quits the game.
     Note: At any time use ALT-S to alternatively toggle the 
sound effects on or off.

A complete shot requires 3 taps on the space bar as follows:


      ----        1. Tap once to start backswing. Each line on the 
  =-  ---- 100%   power guage (on the left side of the screen)
top of---- 90%    incrementally increases the power of your
swing             swing by 10% of the club's rated potential
      ---- 80%    distance (see club distance table below). Dark
 P    ---- 70%    area ar top (over 100%) indicates overswing
 O                which significantly reduces ball control and
 W    ---- 60     results in a longer (wider) show.
 E    ---- 50%    2. Press the space bar a second time to start
 R    ---- 40%    downswing at the desired point on the power
                  gauge. an arrow will mark the point where this
 G    ---- 30%    occurred. Stopping your backswing part way
 U                up will result in a shorter shot (useful for
 A    ---- 20%    chipping).
 G                3. The third (and final) tap will snap your 
 E                wrists at the bottom of the swing (line where 
      ---- 10%    swing began). Snapping the wrists early (above 
                  the line) will result in a hook (ball curves to
Hook              the left). Snapping the wrists late below the 
Straight--- 0%    line results in a slice (ball curves to the 
Slice             right).
      ----start   An arrow will mark this point.

SHOTMAKING TIPS

     From deep rough and sandtraps, a wood will result in a poor 
shot.  Use an iron, and even then make sure not to overswing, 
which will almost certainly result in a poor shot. Each shot's 
trajectory is a combination of your swing and a little bit of 
luck. When the ball hits the ground, it randomly bounces left or 
right. Also, when hitting from different terrains, you need to 
use a bigger club then normal to achieve the same distance. From 
light rough, this difference is about one club up. From deep 
rough and sand it is more like 2 to 3 clubs. Both beginners and 
experienced players must make this adjustment.

PUTTING

     Use the up/down arrows to aim your putt. The arrows on the 
green will indicate the direction of the undulations (breaks) 
which will cause the ball to move in their direction. Therefore 
you must anticipate the correct "line" the ball should travel in 
order to sink your putt.

TERRAIN

The following are types of terrain:
     
     1. Fairway
     2. Light rough
     3. Deep rough
     4. Sandtraps
     5. Water hazards
     6. Putting green
     7. Out of Bounds
     Note: In "COURSE ARCHITECT" see samples of terrain color and 
shading when designing or modifying a hole.
When landing in rough, or using short irons (ie:, 9 iron) the 
ball will come to a stop more quickly than normal. When landing 
on a green, it will "bite" more quickly than in the fairway. When 
landing in sand, it will come to a stop very quickly (all though
it may still skip out of the trap). When using a wood or long 
iron (ie: 3 wood, 3 iron) the ball will continue to roll farther 
unless it lands in the rough or a trap.
If a ball comes to rest out of bounds, a penalty stroke is taken 
(in addition to the stroke played), and the shot must be 
replayed.
If a ball lands in the water, a penalty stroke is taken (in 
addition to the stroke played). The ball must then be replayed or 
dropped somewhere along an imaginary line between the hole and 
the point where the ball last crossed water. The player is taken 
to the overhead view to make this decision.

TREES

When a ball hits a tree, it will either ricochet back towards you 
along a random angle (if you hit a solid brown or black part of 
the tree), or go through the tree (slowed down and exit sideways 
along a random angle).

GREENS

When all players have reached the green, the screen switches to 
an overhead view of the green with all balls lying on it. The 
player furthest from the hole putts first, and play proceeds 
normally, except that a player has the option of finishing their 
putt (like real golf etiquette).

SCORECARD

The scorecard shows the current score of each player. Dots 
indicate the player (match play) or team (best ball) which won 
the hole. At the end of 18 holes of play, you will have the 
option of printing the scorecard for a permanent record.

QUITTING

Players may quit at any time. However, the game only saves 
information on completed holes. When a game is "quit" while 
playing a hole, players will resume on the tee of that hole. 
Quitting also allows the option of restarting the game.

HALL OF FAME

The Mean 18 Hall of Fame is reserved for the top 10 scores for 
each course. It records the players initals, score, (for both 
front and back nine). skill level, which tees were used, and the 
date (input by the user). Only scores under 100 will be recorded. 
If you score over 100, a trip to the practice tee is probably in 
order!


                      COURSE ARCHITECT 
    
This feature allows you to design or modify an entire golf course
 
Note! Remember to make a backup copy of your course disk prior to 
using the COURSE ARCHITECT.  This preserves the original courses 
supplied with the game.

CONTROL

You must select one of the following type of controls:
     Mouse  - Joystick - Keyboard

SELECTION SCREEN

By using the appropriate control, move the cursor over the 
corresponding area of the screen (until the corner brackets 
around the item are displayed) to select on e of the following 
options:

     1. Change or enter course name (by typing up to 17 
        characters from the keyboard when prompted to do so).
     2. Design or modify skyline background.
     3. Modify trees and bushes.
     4. Design or modify all of any one of 18 holes.
Note: Use the fire button (mouse or joystick) or spacebar to 
      activate option

DESIGN AND MODIFICATION

When designing or modifying skyline, trees or specific holes, 
some or all of the following features may apply (note: some 
features may not be displayed on all option screens);

     You can select the view marker under and/or to the left of 
the wide angle (panoramic) display. These markers may be moved 
right\left or up\down to scroll the zoomed detail window 
displayed on the left of the screen.
     The white directional arrows on the screen may be used for 
fine scrolling of these images
     You may select on e of the following "paint brush" sizes:
              
                    . (small)   + (med)    # (large)
     You may select a color or terrain type with which to paint 
of fill.
     PAINTING - place the cursor over the specific area on the 
detail (or panoramic) view and press the fire button to change 
that spot (corresponding to current "paint brush" size) to the 
selected color.
     Note: while painting or scrolling you may hold the action 
button down and the activity will continue until released. If 
using the spacebar on the keyboard, the first press "locks" it 
down and the second press releases it.
     FILLING - select "FILL", then move to the specific area (as 
with painting above) and press the fire button. This will 
change that spot and all adjoining spots of the same color to the 
currently selected color. The adjoining spots effected must be 
horizontally or vertically touching (not on a diagonal) and 
corresponding spots adjoining them will also be effected.
     "CANCEL" - Undoes any immediate (unsaved) changes you have 
made on this screen.
     "SAVE" - permanently saves your design changes to the disk.
When designing a specific hole, there are several other options 
in addition to the ones listed above.
     "CLR" - (Clear) erases all terrain features except hole and 
tees.
     "TREES" - select "TREES" box on the right. The new screen 
will allow you to select one of six types of trees or bushes and 
(while holding fire button down) move it into the desired 
position on the course (then release the fire button). Use a 
similar procedure to remove trees from the course. There can be a 
maximum of 28 trees on any hole. You can also move the flag and 
hole (cup) any place on the green using a similar procedure.
Select "DONE" to exit from this screen.

     PAR - move cursor over PAR number and click fire button to 
change value from 3,4 or 5.

     TEES - select "P" or "R" to move the position of the Pro or 
Regular tee. Move the cursor to the new position on the upper 
panoramic screen and click the fire button to position it 
(indicated by the block dot) The old tee position will be 
"erased" to fairway color and must be painted out manually if 
another type of terrain is desired. Yard to hole are indicated on 
lower left of screen and will vary as the cursor is moved in 
relation to the hole. This number indicates "line of sight" 
distance from the Tee to the hole.
Note: When actually playing a hole this number may be larger 
since the distance is then calculated along the fairway.

     GREEN - (positioning) - click on "G" move cursor to the 
position where you want the upper left hand corner of the new 
position of the green (on the upper panoramic screen). 
The old green will be "erased" to fairway similar to the "Tees" 
above.

     GREEN (design) - select the "GREEN" box on the right of the 
screen to design the size, shape and undulations of the green. 
Then select a "paint brush" size and "FWY" to make the green 
smaller by painting in (adding) fairway. To increase the size of 
the green and to define the slope (undulations) select a slope or 
flat direction (center section ) from Diagram as indicated below. 
Use this to paint the desired areas. Select "DONE" to exit this 
screen.

NOTE: Although cup position is indicated on this screen it can 
only be moved on the "TREES" screen as described above.

     MODIFYING TREES - You may design / modify a tree to better 
suit the course environment using the Course Architect.
Pick any one of the six available trees from the "selection 
screen". You will then be taken to the "tree design/edit" screen. 
You will see both the "course tree" (on left) "overhead tree" (on 
right) represented in both "actual" and "zoomed" windows. You may 
edit both windows of each tree except for the "overhead tree" 
which only the  "zoomed window" may be edited.

     MODIFYING SKYLINE - You may design/modify the skyline in 
much the same manner as trees. The skyline will be represented in 
the "course" depiction only since it is not seen from the 
"overhead" view. The skyline in the game is made up of three 120 
degrees screens spliced together to provide a full 360 degree 
panoramic view when playing Mean 18. When editing a skyline, the 
left side and right side should "connect" to provide a sense of 
continuity.
