                                LOCK-ON

OBJECTIVE
Your mission is to pilot your fighter plane through successively
difficult stages, destroying as many enemy targets as possible.  There
are a total of 20 game stages.  Some of the enemy targets will fire
missiles at you.  The red missiles follow a straight path.  The blue
missiles are heat seeking and can track your plane.  Each time you are
hit by a missile, you lose a plane.  When you have lost all your planes,
the game gives you the option of resuming the game at a previous stage
level or quitting the program.

GAME PLAY
You have two weapons at your disposal:  gunfire and LOCK-ON rockets.
The gun will destroy targets that are aimed at by the crosshair.  some
targets require more than one hit to be destroyed.  You can LOCK-ON to
some targets. The LOCK-ON sound will be heard and the target will be
displayed in red.  A LOCK-ON rocket can be fired at these targets to
destroy them.

Your plane can hover.  Hovering will allow you more time to destroy
targets and is sometimes effective in evading enemy missiles.  You can
only hover constantly for a short period of time as the plane's engines
will overheat.

PLAYING HINTS
*Extra planes are awarded for achieving certain scores.
*Bonus points are awarded for accuracy in flying into the tunnels at the
 end of each stage.
*Some stages will have more than one exit tunnel.  These tunnels lead to
 different stages.  The extra tunnels will appear as you achieve certain
 scores within each stage.
