                          -------------------------

 The object of this game is to find the two Rings Of Zilfin and destroy the
 evil Necromancer Lord Dragos.

 TRAVELLING
 ----------
  To go from one location to another you must use the (X)it command.  After
 the save phase,  you are asked to choose from a list of roads.  A blinking
 cross on the map indicates your position.  It's best to mark eack explored
 area on a blank map.  You may want to return to some areas again.
  If there is no road in the  direction you have chosen,  a message will so
 inform you.  The maximum number of roads  leading  away from a location is
 four.  Once a road is chosen you can't go back.  You  must reach  the next
 location before going back.
  While in motion,  you can't issue any commands  until you  (S)top.  While
 walking,you can use the cursor keys to control your speed. The right arrow
 increases your speed, from One to Four.  This is of course fatiguing. Your
 fatigue loss is shown each five miles.  The left arrowslows you down.
  First use the SPACE BAR to stop if you wish to (G)et plants and mushrooms
 (D)rink from a pond, (T)alk to someone, or (R)est at night.
  Beware of Spy Birds of Dragos. If you do not kill all of them,  They will
 will return with more monsters until you defeat them all.
  Take enough food for the journey.   Wandering  monks  may  provide useful
 information and  eating plants may give you  extra powers.   Even drinking
 water form the ponds can have its benefits (And risks).
 
 EXPLORING LOCATIONS
 -------------------
  At each location, you are typically presented with a set of options.These
 appear in a menu, and you press a key to make a choice.  Let it known how-
 -ever, that all the options are not shown.
  Multi-Level  mazes  will  greet you in two places - In the Dark Tower and
 Castle Graz.   Here you  will move in four  directions.   At time you will
 encounter doors. (E)nter them, and hopefully (X)it.
 
 COMBAT
 ------
  At  times  the  power  of darkness will attack.  They can attack from the
 ground or from the air.You will be attacked with magic,such as destructive
 spells, or with physical weapons such as axes, poisionous pins, or muscle.
  You however,  are favored with both the  magic  spells  and  the physical
 weapons of a sword,  bow and arrows.  Armour protects against any physical
 blows, but not spells.
 
 AIR COMBAT
 ----------
  The  only  way  to  kill  the attackers from the air is with your bow and
 arrows or casting you 'Eevi' class spells.   When firing your arrows,  use
 the RIGHT and LEFT arrow keys to aim.  One hit  knocks the  enemy from the
 sky.
 
 GROUND COMBAT
 -------------
  All weapons and spells  can  be used in ground combat,  depending on your
 level and skill.   Here you must specify your direction of attack,   since
 the enemy can come from all sides.   You may fight with (S)word,  (A)rrow,
 or (C)ast an Eevei class spell.  After  issuing the  command you  indicate
 the direction you wish to attack.
  Striking with your sword is a question of Skill  level.  Once the hit has
 landed, two factors determine the damage inflicted:  Your strength and the
 type of sword.  There are ways to  increase your strength,   but these you
 must uncover in your travels.
  An  (A)rrow  scores a hit of  99% of the time.  The damage depends on the
 type of bow,and your strength.There's some randomness in the effectiveness
 of arrows.  The ash bows inflicts less damage,  and eventually will break.
 The Brom bow will serve you indefinitely, and strike harder.
 
 CHARACTER ATTRIBUTES
 --------------------
 STRENGTH - Determines the damage you can wreck on the foe.  Maximum effec-
            -tiveness depends both on your strength and on having a  weapon
            of an appropriate level. Your Maximum strength is 99.
 ENDURANCE- Measures to pain you can tolerate yet survive. Each strike from
            a foe reduces this rating, depending on their strength and your
            armour.  If this falls below zero, you die.  You start with 200
            points; maximum is 9000.
 FATIGUE  - The  embodiment  of  your  physical  condition.  Throughout the
            adventure you will discover many ways this can be increased.  A
            long climb,  a restless night, or more importantly, the casting
            of spells,  all  affect  the  fatigue.  Combat also reduces the
            fatigue rating. This must also be kept above zero if you are to
            survive.  You start with 50 fatigue points; maximum is 9000.
 SWORD KILL-The chance that your blows will land home with effect.  There's
            some chance your skill wil increase when you slay an enemy with
            your sword.  This becomes more likely as your skill grows. Your
            skill will not grow if you kill with magic or arrows. the skill
            level begins at 25 and can build to 66.
 MAGICSKILL-Determines the spells you can cast.  You start with no skill in
            this area and builds to 99.

                human blood

                Dark Tower. There they remained till Lord Dragos freed them

 south is Deloria,  to the west Sumaria,  and east is Begonia.  The  barren
 northern reaches are known as Dragonai and are inhabited onlt by the giant

 almost no one.

 GENERAL GEOGRAPHY
 -----------------
  The large and small forests of Batiniq are now very unsafe due to Dragos.
 Most  humans live on plains in  towns and  villages.  Deserts are hostile,
 full of danger and some rewards.  Most difficult of all for travel are the
 marshes, where death is as likely an outcome as life.
 

                                   HISTORY
                                   -------

 THE RINGS OF ZILFIN
 -------------------
  It was  long ago,  some say before the Toros Mountains had thrust up from
 mother earth.  In  that day,  great wars raged between the forces of light
 and the forces of evil.  The Zilfin wizards wrought two rings,  which were
 worn by the  first speaker  at the  Battle of Bihun.  Each ring alone  was
 ordinary.   But the two rings together,  on the hand of one being, were to
 give supernatural force.  After the forces of evil  were  beaten  back  at
 Bihun, the First Speakers of Zilfin wore the rings as badge of their rank.
 This natural order,  with its peace and prosperity,  lasted even after the
 Zilfin mysteriously vanished.
  Then came Lord Dragos.  His scroll declared the perversity of his purpose
 and the strrngth of his hand was soon felt. His demons he placed under the
 command of Dzomon,  himself a tower of demonic darkness.  Suffering spread
 through  Bantiniq.   There was now no trace of the Zilfins,  as though the
 foul  incantations of  Dragos had swept then from the land.   Night-flying
 Dragon Birds,  Illets, Guzus,  Dra-Hinns and others plagued once  peaceful
 forests.  Those caught in the open had no chance. Even the industrious and
 merry  elves  fled to  more  remote  forests for safety.  Travel and trade
 virtually ceased.  If the next village could not be reach by daylight,  it
 could not be reached alive.  Even during the day,goblins raided and robbed
  However, even Dragos was not able to  subdue the  monks  of  Batiniq.  An
 ancient  spell  perserved  them.  So some news was carried from kingdom to
 kingdom by the monks.  They were the only segment  of  society not totally
 isolated.
  Administration of the  provinces came under the Zorlims who extorted gold
 from the helpless populace.  Any  town  that was too slow to cooperate was
 left in a smoldering pile.
 Beseiged within their castles, the former kings of the  three realms were
 defenseless, hardly able to keep themselves, much less help the peaseantry
  The beatings wore on,  until it seemed  the people were almost senseless.
 Few lights shone in this dark age, like flickering torches on a  windswept
 moor.  The forces of evil neared their final victory.

 THE CASTLE GRAZ
 ---------------
  Two prizes still eluded Lord Dragos, however:The Rings of Zilfin, and the
 Treasure of Fulgarsh. Aside from these, the paltry resistance of the monks
 and the rumors of the zilfins, naught marred the ascendency of Dragos.
  As to the rings,when Dragos first arrived at Castle Graz, hiding place of
 the rings, he had not even been able to gain entrance.First,the castle was
 placed high atop Moun Grazdreng.  There secluded from the world, connected
 with no road or trail,  it  could only be reached by flying on the back of
 the giant Ankha birds. How the  Zilfins  had traveled there was not known.
 Flying  on the Ankha was not only dangerous but difficult to arrange.  The
 elves only knew how to summon these birds. 

 THE FATE OF DARMAG
 ------------------
  After the first speaker,  the next best known inhabitant of the place had
 been Darmag, the guard. Darmag resembled a large pupmkin,his root dug deep
 into the soil, and he was more like a vegatable then a human or a  Zilfin.
 His skin was  like a bark of a tree, hard and durable.  Though he appeared
 to be a plant, he possesed intelligence and magic.  He could also surround
 himself with a wall of energy that no one could penetrate.
  When Lord Dragos and his followers appeared,  Darmag refused to give way.
 Despites  all the efforts of Dragos,  Darmag held firm.   Then the cunning
 Dragos ordered chewba, the narcotic to be brought.  The chewba leaves were
 squeezed and their juice poured into the grounds near Darmag.Since he took
 his nourishment from the earth, his roots absorbed the drug.  His defenses
 failed and he fell into a deep sleep. So Dragos penetrated the Castle.
 Thereafter chewba juice was regularly poured into the soil,and Darmag was
 reduced into a drug slave.  He would follow any  order of Dragos,  begging
 for more chewba juice.

 SEARCH FOR THE RINGS
 --------------------
  Once inside, Dragos searched for the Rings He opened a door which was not
 opened for centuries, inside he found a little  black chest on a low stone
 altar. Inside was ONE ring, ONLY ONE.

 THE SECOND PRIZE
 ----------------
  The second prizr that had eluded Dragos was the Treasuse of Fulgarsh.  Of
 all the kings of this land, Fulgarsh was the most cruel.
  As his time grew near, Fulgarsh  feared that his  gold would surely  pass
 into the hands of  another.  As  he grew deathly ill,  a giant dragon flew
 down from the sky.  Bogum, Dragon of legend.  Through a window he spoke to
 the dying king.  Then astounding all,Fulgarsh arose and led the beast into
 his treasure room.
  Moments later the great chest was chained to the Dragons back and he flew
 away.  Where did the treasure go? Dragos never found it.

 A FINAL MAIGICAL WORD
 ---------------------
  Of all the witches, only one,  Zara claims to have found a eternal source
 of life.  Zara, the eternal sorceress, lives in a temple in  Begonia.  She
 does nothing without the expectation of payment.
