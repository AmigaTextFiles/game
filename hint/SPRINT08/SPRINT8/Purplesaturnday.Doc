                         PURPLE SATURN DAY
                         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

                         ON THIS DAY, THEY
                         COME TO VANQUISH
                            YOU, FRIEND



1.    THE AIM OF THE GAME, FRIEND:

     THE PURPLE SATURN DAY Games are held every Saturn year.  
Eight species take part, including humans(that's you!).
     The eight competitors are divided into four pairs.  The two 
individuals of each pair compete against one another in four 
competitions.
     The winners of these quarter-finals go on to the semi-finals 
and then to the final.
     The outright winner receives a kiss from the Purple Saturn 
Queen!

            
2.    THE FOUR COMPETITIONS:

     The four competitions are symbolized in four windows at the 
top of the podium.  From left to right:

                         -Ring pursuit
                         -Tronic slider
                         -Brain bowler
                         -Time jump

     In each window are displayed the latest scores: your score (at 
the top) and your opponent's (below your).


3.   TRAINING:

     Facing the empty podium:
     Click on one of the four windows representing the four 
competitions.  A robot will act as your opponent.
               
               Keys F1-F2  ..........pause
               Keys F9-F10  .........quit the competition.


4.   TO TAKE PART IN A COMPETITION:

     Click on the Saturn triangle at bottom center screen.  The 
competition table will display.  At the bottom of the pyramid 
you'll see all eight competitors grouped into their pairs.
     Score totals will appear beneath each character's label.  The 
human and his opponent are privileged to open the proceedings. 


     Click on a competition panel to compete.  You are free to 
choose the order of competitions.
     Click on the cross at bottom screen under the pyramid, to 
quit the competition.  The other species will then compete to 
finish the first round.  The winners will be raised a level in the 
pyramid for a further confrontation without you.  The ultimate 
winner receives the final reward on the podium.


5.   CHARACTER IDENTITY FILES

     Click on a character label at bottom screen to consult his 
species' ID file. 6 characteristic icons appear beneath the 
triangle:

                    -Agility
                    -Mental fluid
                    -Agression
                    -Temporal flux(ability to move through time)
                    -Size
                    -Eyesight

Beneath the species' name (upper right) are four windows containing 
top scores and success percentages is each competition: Ring 
pursuit, Tronic slider, Brain bowler, and Time jump for the 
selected race.

     Click on the triangle at the top of the character ID file to 
return to the pyramid.


6.   EVOLUTION OF SPECIES

     As the competition are held each Saturn year, the various 
competing species tend to evolve and change. For example, a Golgos 
competitor on the 3rd Purple Day won't necessarily have the same 
characteristics as the Golgos competitor on the 45th Purple Day.

     Species' evolution and performances are recorded on the disk.
     DO NOT WRITE-PROTECT your disk!


     

                         RING PURSUIT
                      (mastering Space)


*    THE AIM

     The idea is to fly in Saturn's asteroid ring around the 
planet.  Wrecked space-ships have been placed as markers along 
your route.  There are two kinds of marker:

     RED MARKERS:you must go by to the right of them.
     YELLOW MARKERS:you must pass to the left.


     This competition is a DUEL in which time counts for little.  
To win, you must score as many points as you can.  Only the 
competitor who is in the lead is obliged to pass the markers 
correctly.

     You score points:

     -when you're in front
     -by going to the correct side of the markers, when you're in 
      front.

     You increase your opponent's score:

     -by going by the wrong side of the markers, when you're in 
      the lead.

     You are allowed:

     -to push your opponent
     -to move away from the center of the asteroid belt in order 
      to catch up with your opponent.

                    TRONIC SLIDER
                  (Mastering Energy)


*    THE AIM.
------------
     The idea of this competition is to get as many fragments of 
pure energy as you can.  You'll be piloting a scooter on an 
orbital game area.

     THERE IS A TIME LIMIT.

*    GAME DESCRIPTION:
----------------------
     An energy-ball moves around the game area.  You must make it 
fragment by firing at it. The energy fragments are now yours to 
take.  Just fly your scooter over them to pick them up.  Don't 
forget that your opponent is also playing...

     Once you've picked up the pure energy fragments, the initial 
energy-ball will reform, and you start all over again.

     You can push your opponent to shake off some of the fragments 
he has collected.

     To pilot the Tronic Slider, don't hesitate to make slides and 
90-degree turns.

*    COMMANDS:
-------------
     -Mouse forward:.......accelerate
     -Mouse back:..........slow down

                         BRAIN BOWLER
                   (Mastering Mental Waves)


*    IMPORTANT
--------------
     This game may seem complicated at first.  In fact it is 
revolutionary! Read the following instructions carefully, and 
you'll soon be playing an amazingly exciting game!


*    THE AIM:
-------------
     Both competitors face a brain-wall.  The two sides of the 
brain are the two players' territories.

     Each player controls an electro-ball which he fires at the 
wall by clicking on the mouse button.  The balls bounce off the 
brain-wall and return to their starting-point.

     The idea of the game is to re-activate your side of the brain 
by guiding the electrical charges which more along the circuit 
towards the six pins linked to the central EXXOS.

          THERE IS NO TIME LIMIT.


*    GAME DESCRIPTION:
----------------------
     The targets placed on each side of the brain can change their 
state when struck by an electro-ball.

     You can hit a switch to open or close it.  This will block or 
release an electric charge onto its circuit.

     You can hit a charge which is blocked at one end of a bridge, 
to make the charge cross the bridge.

     You can take the energy from one of the four condensors (round 
components which light up when penetrated by an electric charge). 
The electro-ball will then return full of energy! This energy will 
let you activate on eof the eighteen chips, by hitting it with the 
energized electro-ball.

     The re-activated chip will turn red.  However, it won't be 
permanently activated until it has been penetrated by an electric 
charge, at which point will turn green.

     Red chip:.....vulnerable
     Green chip....permanently re-activated.
     This is extremely important, because your opponent will do 
all he can to steal the energy from your condensors, de-activate 
your chips(if they're red), open and close doors to block your 
progress, etc, etc!
     Of course, you can (and should) do the same to him!

     Once all the chips on your side have been penetrated by a 
charge and all pins linked to the central EXXOS have been lit up, 
then the game is over!The competitor to finish is the winner.

                          TIME JUMP
                      (Mastering Time)


*    THE AIM:
-------------
     Jump as far as possible into the future.
     To make your jump, you must capture energy three times, by 
clicking on sparks which cross the screen.
     The energy you catch will fuel a gravity catapult which will 
fire you through time and space.
     DANGER:this competition has C132 classification.

*    GAME DESCRIPTION:
----------------------
     Click a mouse button.  This will "wind up"the catapult and 
release the energy sparks.  You must then click to wind up the 
catapult completely, release... you jump, friend!

     Your trajectory will lead you past the "crown of seven suns".  
Beyond them, you will exceed the speed of light and therefore 
enter another dimension.  The more enrgy-sparks you captured, the 
further you will plunge through mind-altering visions of space-
time contraction, a vertiginous spectacle of theoretical vacuum, 
intrinsically extrapolational!


     NOTE: You can slow the energy-sparks down.  Do this by 
pressing repeatedly when winding up the catapult.  These 
forward/backward movements, if they're long enough, will slow the 
sparks down.  The idea is to get as close as you can to rupture-
point, when the ship will start vibrating.


*    COMMANDS
-------------

     Mouse button:......wind-up catapult
                        clicking on sparks
     
     Mouse movements:...movement of aim-sights.

*    CONTROL PANEL DESCRIPTION:
-------------------------------

     TOP:
     -opponent's score on the left
     -your score on the right.

     SMALL SCREEN RIGHT:
     -current magnetic Field tension

     BOTTOM:
     -left:.....clock
     -right:....speed
     -center....light which flashes when particles escape.


               GENERAL COMMANDS
