click the QUIT button on the screen to return to the mission in progress.

To load a mission,  hold down the ALTERNATE key and type L.  An information 
screen will appear shortly.  Eject the program disk from Drive A and insert 
the disk that has your saved mission.   Move the cursor over the disk drive 
icon  and click the mouse button to select the disk drive where  your  game 
disk is located.   Type the name of the mission you would like to load  and

SPECIFIC TO THE ATARI ST VERSION

You  may experience a crash of enough force to stop all Harrier  functions, 
but  not enough to destroy the craft entirely,  leaving you trapped in  the 
cockpit.  Press ESC to bail out.

When you crash the aircraft,  abort a mission or finish a mission, a combat 
summary screen appears on which you are prompted to press the RETURN key to 
continue the program.   Press the RETURN key TWICE in order to continue the 
program.




Typist's Notes:

Other than different key commands,  the first version seems to be the  same 
as this newer version.
