STARTING PLAY

    It's suggested that you start in the 2 player mode.  While the
other player stands motionless, try out some moves.  Get comfortable
with a couple of moves, then try someone that fights back.

    There are a range of punches, kicks and leaps available.  You can
move left and right, or do a forward or backward summersault.  There
are a number of punches and kicks: high, medium, low and others.  In
all there are 16 choices, based on eight joystick positions, and
whether or not the joystick button is pushed.


If you are facing right, these are your moves.

                    low punch       high kick

                          low sweep




                      WITH BUTTON PRESSED

                           jump kick

                      flip           flip

       back spin kick                     center kick

                  low kick           low kick

                       spinning lunge punch




   To change youre direction, do either a low kick or a high punch in
the direction you want to turn to face your opponent.  The spinning
lunge punch faces you first one direction, then the reverse.

   To block strikes to the head or stomach, walk backward - your
fighter will block.  Blocking against low kicks or sweeps is not
possible - leap out of the way or counter attack.

   Scores for the white and red players are shown at the top of the
screen.  Person vs person matches can last 60 seconds.  Person vs
computer matches last 30 seconds.  Watch the karate master in the
background - He flashes the score after each hit or knockdown.  You
recieve match points and score points.  Scoring is based on the
diffucaulty and impact of the move.  The person who wins this three
bout contest goes on to play the computer.

   When you play against the computer, match points determan the
winner.  Match points are either half or full point.  These are
indicated by the three dots for each player at the top of the screen,
wich change from red to a lighter color as you score.  If you are tied
at two poins each, the player who has scored the most points in the
round is the winner.  If that score is tied, the judgement is made by
who made the best effort.

   When you play against another person, the number of knockdowns
determans the winner.  These are determaned by the 12 dots at the
bottom of the scoreboard.  If you reach 12 knockdowns, you win.  If
time runs out, the player with more knockdowns is the winner.  The 3
dots at the top of the screen keep track of how many bouts each player
has won.  If both players each have an equal number of knockdowns, the
scores for that bout determan the winner.

   Top players get to enter there name in a list of best players.
Push the joystick to change the letters for your initials.  Press the
button to enter the letter.

   When playing against the computer you earn more points for hits
executed earlier in the match.  As you progress through the rounds you
earn higher belts: white, yellow, green, purple, brown, black.  Higher
points are earned for the more devistating blows: high punch, jump
kick, back spin kick.  You earn a full score for a full point hit and
a half for a half point hit.

         low sweep                400               200


   Between rounds you must pass tests of skill to advance.  To break
the bricks with your head, push the joystick forward immediately when
the master say go.  Pull back to duck, or forward to leap, to avoid
the flying spears and knives.


TIPS

   Use flips to get behind your opponent,and strike quickly.  Your
opponent may be slow to turn around and face you.  It takes percise
positioning for your blows to hit home.  You can exicute several moves
without pausing in between.  Simply move the joystick quickly to your
next move before your man gets to standing position.  This can
overwhelm you opponent.


                                              GOOD FIGHTING !!
