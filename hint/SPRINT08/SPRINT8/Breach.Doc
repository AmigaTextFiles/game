                                  BREACH
                        by Omnitrend Software, Inc.

BEFORE YOU PLAY...

Your computer must be in low resolution mode in order to play.

Due  to bugs in some versions of the ST,  use of the  underscore  character 
when entering file names will cause the computer to stop.

When  playing Breach with only one drive,  you must copy a scenario  (.SCE) 
file  and a squad leader (.SQL) file from the scenario disk to the  program 
disk before playing.

Breach  uses almost 512K of memory.   If the program reports that there  is 
not enough memory,  you may need to remove any RAMdisks or desk accessories 
(.ACC) files and reboot.
     

                              PLAYING BREACH

NOTES

Whenever the manual refers to "the mouse button",  and your mouse has  more 
than one button,  use the left-hand button.  Breach only uses the left-hand 
button.

"Clicking" means "press the mouse button".   "Shift-click" means "hold down 
one of the shift keys and press the mouse button at the same time".

The "current marine" referred to throughout the manual,  is the marine  who 
appears  in the center of the Combat Window and whose statistics appear  in 
the Marine Statistics Window.

STARTING BREACH

To  play  Breach,  boot  up the Breach Program Disk  and  double-click  the 
"BREACH" icon.   When the program finishes loading, the Breach title screen 
will  appear.   To  continue,  click  the mouse or press  any  key  on  the 
keyboard.

SECURITY CHECK

In order to play Breach,  you must correctly complete a security check.  To 
complete the security check, enter the word from this manual whose location 
is  given by the dialog box.   "Words" are any string of characters with  a 
space  or  punctuation at either end.   Once you have entered  the  correct 
word, the program will continue.

STARTING A NEW GAME
     
Select "New..." from the Scenario menu.   An item selector box will appear.  
All  of  the names that appear are scenario files.   These  scenario  files 
contain all the data for your combat squad,  the opponents, and maps of the 
combat  area.   What  you are going to create is a game file.   This  is  a 
combination of a scenario file and a squad leader file.   More on the squad 
leader file later.

Once you have selected a scenario file, the scenario item selector box will 
be replaced by a squad leader selector box.   This is where you select  the 
squad leader for your game.  A sample squad leader "SMITH" is included with 
your game.  Later on, you'll probably want to create a squad leader of your 
own using the Scenario Builder.

Now  you have to name the game file in which your current game is going  to 
be stored.

Once  you have done this,  the program will save the new game file  to  the 
disk and your game will start.

IMPORTANT  - When a game file is created,  it erases the squad leader  file 
you  have selected and incorporates it into the game  file.   This  ensures 
that the squad leader file can be used only by one scenario at a time.  The 
only ways to recover the squad leader file are: win the game in progress or 
delete the scenario with the "Delete..." menu entry.   Deleting a game file 
outside  of the game will also erase the squad leader file which  has  been 
incorporated into it.

ORDER OF PLAY

Player Phase - Each round begins with the player having the option to  move 
all, some, or none of his marines.  You can move a marine until he runs out 
of movement points or you click the Next icon.

To enter the enemy combat phase, shift click the Next icon.  If all of your 
marines have used up their movement points for the round, the computer will 
automatically enter the Enemy Phase.

Each Player Phase takes 30 seconds of game time.

Enemy  Phase - When the enemy attack phase begins,  the  marine  statistics 
window will change its title to "Attacks" and the legend "Enemy Movement.." 
will appear.

Enemy troops appear in the combat window only when they are attacking  your 
men.

At the end of the enemy phase, the player phase begins again.

MOVEMENT POINTS

Each  marine is given a certain quantity of movement points (mp).   All  of 
the  marine  activities except for changing the view scale  (more  on  that 
later)  take up a certain number of points.   For example,  moving  onto  a 
clear  terrain square costs 2 mp,  while firing the gun takes  5  mp.   The 
combat activities such as taking an object,  firing the  gun,  moving,  and 
using an object can all be mixed at your discretion during the same turn.

If you do not have sufficient mp for the activity you want to perform,  the 
computer will inform you with an alert box.

If  all of the movement points for the current marine have been  exhausted, 
the program will automatically advance to the next marine in the squad.

Movement points for each marine are based on:  the marine's suit type,  the 
vitality of the marine, and the marine's current encumbrance.

DEPLOYING YOUR SQUAD

The  marines  in  your squad always enter the scenario  through  the  entry 
square.  The entry square must be clear in order for your marines to enter.  
If a marine is unable to enter,  the program will jump to the enemy  combat 
phase.

You can continue moving a marine until he runs out of movement points, gets 
stunned,  or  you  click the Next icon.   Each time  you  click  Next,  the 
program  will advance to the next marine in the squad who is in the  combat 
zone, is not stunned, and has at least one movement point.

In  addition,  you can make any marine who is visible in the combat  window 
the  current  marine  by holding down the Alternate key  and  clicking  the 
desired marine.

Since  marines  carry  only their guns and  armor  into  a  scenario,  many 
scenarios  provide  a  staging area where the marines  pick  up  additional 
equipment which has been placed near the entry square.

If detectors and crack units are available, use them whenever possible.  By 
saving time searching for your objects,  you raise to odds of  successfully 
completing your mission.

ENCUMBRANCE

There  are 15 different types of objects which may be found in a  scenario.  
Each of those objects has an encumbrance value.   Encumbrance is a  measure 
of the object's bulk.  Obviously, the bulkier the type of object, the fewer 
of them the marine may carry.

Carrying  a large number of encumbrance points has 2  disadvantages.   One, 
the  weight reduces the number of available mp's per  turn.   Two,  marines 
carrying  a  large  quantity of encumbrance points are more  likely  to  be 
selected as a target by enemy forces.

MISSION BRIEFING

The mission briefing is a short description of your combat mission.

Briefings usually include information as to the type and strength of  enemy 
you  will  be  fighting  and  hints as  to  the  location  of  any  mission 
objectives.

VICTORY CONDITIONS

The victory conditions are:

     Rescue  prisoners  -  You  must rescue all of  the  prisoners  in  the 
     scenario if this is one of the victory conditions.

     Capture data packs - This works the same way as rescue prisoners.

     Exit combat zone - All of the marines in your squad must find and  use 
     the exit square if this is one of the victory conditions.

     Kill n% opponents - At least n% of the opponents in the scenario  must 
     be killed if this is one of the victory conditions.

     Scenario time limit - All of the other victory conditions in the  game 
     must be satisfied before the time limit expires.  All scenarios have a 
     time limit.

All of the victory conditions are non-exclusive, that is, more than one may 
be in effect for a given scenario.   Thus,  in order to complete a scenario 
you  may  have  to rescue prisoners and move all  of  the  squad's  marines 
through the exit square before the time limit expires.

MISSION STATUS

By using the Mission Status function, you can tell which victory conditions 
have been satisfied and which need more work.

The possible status displays are:

Victory Condition   Complete                   Incomplete

Rescue Prisoners    All prisoners recovered    Not all prisoners recovered.
Capture Datapacks   All datapacks recovered    Not all datapacks recovered.
Kill n% Opponents   Kill objective completed   More casualties needed.

FIGHTING THE ENEMY

If the enemy is using grenades and rockets,  avoid clustering your marines.  
Try  to keep at least one square between each one.   This  way,  you  avoid 
having 3 or 4 casualties from a single grenade blast.

Conversely, grenades and rockets are most effective against clusters of the 
enemy.   Unless  you have a large quantity of grenades or  rockets,  it  is 
wisest not to "waste" these weapons against single targets.

Battle robots are very dangerous opponents.  Two hits from their cannon are 
enough to destroy virtually any marine.  In addition, they move quickly and 
their  armor  is quite tough.   It is a good idea to use  grenades  against 
battle tanks before trying to destroy them with your marine's guns.

IMPROVING YOUR SQUAD LEADER

Your  overall objective is to improve your squad leader.   You do  this  by 
successfully completing scenarios.

The more active a squad leader is, the more likely he will see some kind of 
improvement at the end of a successful scenario.  Shooting accuracy is very 
important but cracking and detecting skills be honed as well.

It is rumored that squad leaders who are excellent shots and have a passing 
knowledge of detecting and cracking are sent to a special advanced training 
school  (STAR)  which gives them the skills necessary to  complete  a  STAR 
level scenario.

SAVING A GAME IN PROGRESS

In  order to save a game in progress,  you must be at the beginning  of  th 
Player Movement Phase.   You may select menu entries,  but clicking any  of 
the  icons  or the combat window will prevent you from  saving  your  game.  
This is the only point at which you can save the game before quitting.

CLOSING A GAME WITHOUT SAVING

Select  "Close" from the Scenario menu.   When the program asks you if  you 
want to save the game, click "No".

QUITTING BREACH

Use "Quit" from the Scenario menu to exit the program.   If you select this 
at the beginning of the Player Movement phase, you will be given the option 
of  saving your progress before closing.   At any other time,  the  program 
will quit without saving.


                            THE BATTLE DISPLAYS

THE COMBAT WINDOW

The combat window is the largest window on the screen.   During the  player 
combat phase, the current player marine will always appear in the center of 
the combat window.  During the enemy combat phase, the current enemy marine 
will appear in the center of the combat window.

THE MARINE STATISTICS WINDOW

The  marine  statistics window has several  functions.   During  the  Enemy 
Combat  phase,  information  on  enemy  attacks are  shown  in  the  marine 
statistics window.   During the Player Combat phase,  this window  displays 
the battle statistics for the current player marine.  These statistics are:

     Moves - the number of moves left in the current marine's turn.

     Vital  - the vitality of the current marine.   If the  vitality  drops 
     below 30%, it will be displayed in red as a warning.

     Health - the health of the current marine.   If this goes to  0%,  the 
     marine is dead.   When the current marine's health falls below 50%, it 
     will be displayed in red as a warning.

     Enc  -  the  current  encumbrance  of  the  marine  (NOT  the  maximum 
     encumbrance).  This figure will be displayed in green if it is greater 
     than  0.   This  serves as a reminder that the marine is  carrying  an 
     object.

     Shoot - the accuracy of the current marine's shooting.   If the marine 
     is  also a psionic talent,  this is a measure of his stun accuracy  as 
     well.

     Detec  - the percentage chance the current marine has of  successfully 
     operating a detector.

     Crack  - the percentage chance the current marine has of  successfully 
     operating a crack unit.

     Ammo - the current marine's ammunition supply in his gun.  This figure 
     does  not include ammunition in ammo clips he may be  carrying.   Ammo 
     clips  must  be  used in order for their ammo to be  added  into  this 
     figure.

COUNTDOWN TIMER

The countdown timer displays the amount of time remaining in the scenario.

WIDEVIEW DISPLAY

The wideview display is a 21 by 21 composite map of the terrain surrounding 
the  current marine.   It can be displayed by clicking on the Change  Scale 
icon.   Information  for this wideview is provided by other marines  moving 
through  the area,  scouts using detectors,  and infiltrators  using  crack 
units.   When  scouts  use wideview,  opponents appear  as  flashing  green 
squares.



                                 THE ICONS

DROP OBJECT  (arrow pointing away from hand)

Click this icon to drop an object.

A dialog box will appear with a list of all the objects the current  marine 
is carrying.   Note that the marine's gun and armor will not appear on this 
list  as they may not be removed.   If the marine is carrying more  than  5 
objects,  the space between the dialog box scrolling arrows will turn grey.  
Click on the name of the object you want to drop and then click "Ok".

There  are several reasons you might want to drop something.   A very  good 
reason  is  that  you  no longer want to carry  something  because  of  its 
encumbrance penalty.   You might want to transfer an object from one marine 
to another.  In addition, the shield works only if you drop it.

A dropped object always lands directly underneath the current marine.  Only 
one object may be in a square at a time.

It takes 1 movement point to drop an object.

USE SHAFT  (arrows pointing up and down of shaft)

Click this icon whenever you are on a liftshaft/dropshaft that you want  to 
use.

If the corresponding square above the liftshaft (or below the dropshaft) is 
blocked by another marine,  the mouse pointer will change into a stop sign.  
If the corresponding square is blocked by an opponent, the opponent will be 
killed and your level will be changed.

It takes 5 movement points to use a shaft.

TAKE OBJECT  (arrow pointing towards hand)

Click this icon to take an object.

You  can take any object directly adjacent to or in the same square as  the 
current  marine.   The object must be visible;  you cannot take  an  object 
directly from another marine.

The mouse pointer will turn into a pointing hand.  Click this on the object 
you wish to take.

Some objects have special messages written on them.   These messages appear 
whenever the object is taken.

Whenever an object is taken,  it increases the marine's total  encumbrance.  
Encumbrance affects the number of movement points your marine will  receive 
at the beginning of a turn.  Therefore, heavily laden marines will not move 
at their highest speed.

It takes 1 movement point to take an object.

USE OBJECT  (hand pointing at 3 buttons)

Click this icon to use an object.

A dialog box will appear with a list of all the objects the current  marine 
is carrying.  If the marine is carrying more than 5 objects, the space 
between the dialog box scrolling arrows will turns grey.  Click on the name 
of the object you want to use and then click "Ok".

All of the objects and their uses are detailed in the section "Objects  and 
Their Uses".

The objects require varying amounts of movement points to use.  They are:

        Object           Movement Points
        --------------------------------

        Grenade                 5
        Demo Charge             5
        Stimulant               3
        Ammo                    8
        MediKit                 7
        Rocket                  5
        Launcher                5
        Crack Unit              9
        Detector               15
        Grav Belt              10
        Shield                 N/A  (shield is activated by dropping it.)
        Prisoner               N/A
        Datapack               N/A

OPEN DOOR  (arrow pointing towards doors)

Click this icon to open a door adjacent to the current marine.

The mouse point will turn into a small key.   Place this key over the  door 
you want to open and click the mouse.   If you have enough movement points, 
the door will open.

The doors require varying amounts of movement points to open.   Glass doors 
require 3, Steel doors require 5, and Power doors require 10.

FIRE GUN/PSIONIC STUN  (picture of gun)

Click this icon to fire the current marine's gun.

The  gun  will fire in the direction that the marine  faces.   Each  firing 
consumes one round of ammo.

Whenever  this icon is clicked and there is at least one round of  ammo  in 
the current marine's gun, a beam of energy will be emitted.  This beam will 
travel  in a straight line away from the marine until it strikes:  a  wall, 
solid rock,  a shaft,  a closed door,  a fuel tank,  an opponent, or one of 
your own men.

When a beam stops in a particular square,  the computer determines  whether 
or  not  the beam hit the target.   This is based on the  current  marine's 
accuracy percentage.  If the beam does hit the target, a "splash" of energy 
will appear on the target.   This holds true for the opponents as well.  If 
the  beam  hits  an opponent,  the amount of health  damage  that  the  gun 
generates  is subtracted from the opponent's health,  minus the amounts  of 
protection his armor provides.

                           Suit            Gun
                           Protection      Damage
     --------------------------------------------
     Squad Leader             75%            40%
     Marauder                 55%            30%
     Scout                    55%            15%
     Infiltrator              45%            15%
     Psionic Talent            0% (1)        15%
     Enemy Marine             55%            30%
     Alien                    45%            15%
     Beast                     0% (2)        15%
     Overlord                 55%            40%
     Battle Robot             75%            40%
     Autogun                  75%            40%
            
      (1)  Psionic  talents carry a gun which  is  only  effective  against 
           injured or damaged opponents.
      (2)  Beasts' biting generates 45% damage.

For example,  an enemy marine (suit protection = 30%) is hit by a shot from 
your squad leader (gun damage = 75%).   The result is that the enemy marine 
would lose 45% health (75% - 30% = 45% loss).

The  same  holds true for your own marines.   Note that it is  possible  to 
shoot your own troops by mistake, so look before you fire.

Fuel tanks are useful to hit,  as long as you aren't too close to them when 
they  explode.   Being  in  the  midsts of a fuel  tank  explosion  is  the 
equivalent of standing on a demo charge when it goes off.   However, if you 
can  position  your marines correctly,  this effect can be  exploited  with 
impressive results.  A word of warning: fuel tanks will chain-react.

Psionic  Talent type marines execute psionic attacks by shift clicking  the 
gun  icon.   Enemies successfully stunned by a psionic talent will  not  be 
able to move or fire during the next enemy attack phase.

Firing  a  gun requires 3 movement points.   A psionic attack  requires  10 
movement points.

NEXT BUTTON

Click this button to switch current marines.   This will advance you to the 
next marine in your squad or, if you have just moved the last marine in the 
squad, loop back to the squad leader.  Shift click the Next button to enter 
the Enemy Combat phase.

CHANGE SCALE BUTTON

Click  this button to get a "wide angle" view of the  surrounding  terrain.  
Information  for this wideview is provided by other marines moving  through 
the area, scouts using detectors, and infiltrators using crack units.  When 
scouts use the wideview, opponents will appear as flashing green squares.



                                 THE MENUS
ABOUT BREACH...

The  "About Breach..." entry displays a dialog box with  information  about 
the program version and release date.

NEW...

"New..." is used to start a new game.  This is a 3 stage process.

First,  select the scenario you wish to play.  Next, select a squad leader.  
If there aren't any squad leader files on the disk, you will have to create 
a new one with the Scenario Builder program.  Finally, enter the name under 
which this current game is to be saved.

When all this has been done,  Breach will create a game file,  which  means 
that you now have a game in progress on the disk.

RESUME...

Use "Resume..." to continue a game already in progress.

DELETE...

The  mission  status  dialog  box  displays whether  or  not  each  of  the 
scenario's objectives have been met.


                               YOUR MARINES

BASIC CHARACTERISTICS

Movement Points - Each marine is given a certain amount of movement  points 
at  the beginning of his turn.   Almost all of the activities a marine  can 
perform use movement points (mp).  For example, moving onto a clear terrain 
square costs 2 mp, while firing a gun takes 3 mp.

Combat activities such as taking an object,  firing the  gun,  moving,  and 
using an object can all be mixed at your discretion.

If you do not have sufficient mp for the activity you want to perform,  the 
computer will inform you with an alert box.

If  all of the movement points for the current marine have been  exhausted, 
the  program will automatically advance to the next marine in the squad  or 
loop back to the squad leader if you were on the last marine in the squad.

Movement  points  allocated to each marine are based on the  marine's  suit 
type, the vitality of the marine, and the marine's current encumbrance.

Vitality  -  vitality is a measure of how well-rested  a  marine  is.   The 
higher  the vitality,  the more moves a marine has available in  subsequent 
turns.   If a marine were at the 50% vitality level,  he would have 50%  of 
his maximum number of moves available.

At  the  beginning of a game,  a marine's vitality is always  100%.   As  a 
marine  moves  about,  his  vitality is reduced at the  same  rate  as  his 
movement points.   So if a marine with 100% vitality fired a gun ( 3mp) his 
new vitality would be 97%.   Vitality is replenished at the rate of health% 
divided by 4, which means the maximum rate of replenishment is 25% per turn 
(100% health /4 = 25%).

If a marine's vitality is 0%, then the marine is considered stunned, and he 
may not move until the next round.

Health  -  Health  is a measurement of the amount of damage  a  marine  can 
absorb before dying.  When a marine's health drops to 0%, he has died.

Above 50% health,  a marine cannot be killed while taking hits.  Below 50%, 
however,  a marine can die while being hit,  even if the hit does not  drop 
his  health  to  0%.   As  the marine's health  falls  closer  to  0%,  the 
likelihood of this occurring is much greater.

Encumbrance - This is a measure of how many objects a marine can carry.

Carrying  a large number of encumbrance points has 2  disadvantages.   One, 
the weight reduces the number of available mp's per turn.   Two, the marine 
is more likely to be selected as a target by enemy forces.

Shooting  - Shooting is the measurement of a marine's accuracy with a  gun.  
For marines with psionic talent,  this is also a measure of their  accuracy 
with psionic stuns.

Detecting  -  Detecting  is the measurement of how well  a  marine  uses  a 
detector.

Cracking  - Cracking is the measurement of how well a marine uses  a  crack 
unit.


MOVEMENT

As with any other function,  moving your marine will consume some  movement 
points.   Each terrain type (grass,  rocks,  grating) consumes a  different 
amount of mp when it is entered.  In order to move your current marine into 
a new square, he must have at least as many mp as are required to enter the 
square.

     Terrain Type          MP Req'd       Terrain Type          MP Req'd

The current marine will always occupy the center of the combat window.

Marines  can  move in the 4 compass directions.   To move the marine  to  a 
particular square on his current row or column,  simply click the mouse  on 
it.   The marine will march into the square or as far as is possible before 
running into a wall or running out of movement points.

If the marine does not have enough mp to move into the square,  the  square 
is  not  of a type that the marine may occupy,  the square is  occupied  by 
another  player marine,  or the square is already occupied by an  opponent, 
the  mouse pointer will turn into a stop sign,  indicating movement is  not 
allowed.

To  change  a marines' facing without having to move the  marine  from  his 
current square,  hold either shift key and click on the adjacent square you 
wish the marine to face.  This takes 1 movement point (mp).

In  addition,  you can make any marine who is visible in the combat  window 
the  current  marine  by holding down the Alternate key  and  clicking  the 
desired marine.

COMBAT

Guns - All marines carry rifle-type energy weapons called "blasters".  Your 
marines  carry  4 different types of blasters.   Each specialty  carries  a 
specific one.   These guns may not be transferred or exchanged nor can they 
be destroyed by enemy fire.

     Specialty               Gun Strength
     ------------------------------------
     Squad Leader                75%
     Marauder                    55%
     Scout                       55%
     Infiltrator                 45%
     Psionic Talent               0% (1)

      (1)   Psionic  talents carry a gun which is  only  effective  against 
            injured or damaged opponents.


Regardless of weapon strength,  all guns use one round of ammo per  firing.  
In addition, all of the blasters use the same ammo clips.

Use caution when shooting around fuel tanks!   A hit from any blaster  will 
cause them to explode.

It takes 3 mp to fire a blaster.

Grenades  - Marines equip themselves with grenades by taking them from  the 
surrounding terrain.

Grenades will explode around friendly troops and it is possible to detonate 
one in the same square as the current marine.   Grenades will also detonate 
fuel tanks in the same fashion as blasters.  Caution must be exercised when 
using grenades!

Grenades explode in a 3 by 3 pattern,  with the target in the center.  Each 
square receives the equivalent of a hit from a 90% blaster.

Demo  Charges - Marines equip themselves with demo charges by  taking  them 
from the surrounding terrain.

When a demo charge is activated, it drops into the current marine's square.  
The demo charge ignores any objects which may already be in the square.

Demo  charges  will explode around friendly troops and it  is  possible  to 
detonate one in the same square as the current marine.   Demo charges  will 
also detonate fuel tanks in the same fashion as blasters.  Caution  must be 
exercised when using demo charges!

Demo  charges explode in a 5 by 5 pattern,  with the target in the  center.  
Each square receives the equivalent of a hit from a 100% blaster.

Caution:   Once a demo charge has been activated, it cannot be aborted, but 
will explode at the end of the current marine's turn.

Rocket  Launchers - Marines equip themselves with rockets and launchers  by 
taking them from the surrounding terrain.

A marine must have at least one rocket and one launcher in order to fire.

When a rocket is fired, it travels in a straight line until it hits a valid 
target  (i.e.,  a wall,  a marine,  etc.) or leaves the edge of the  combat 
zone.

Rockets  will explode around friendly troops.   Rockets will also  detonate 
fuel tanks in the same fashion as blasters.  Caution must be exercised when 
using rockets!

Rockets explode in a 3 by 3 pattern,  with the target in the center.   Each 
square receives the equivalent of a hit from a 90% blaster.

Caution:   Firing  rockets  at targets not readily visible  may  result  in 
damage to other marines or destruction of necessary mission objectives.

Psionic Stun - Only marines with the specialty of psionic talent can make a 
psionic stun attack.   If a stun attack is successful,  the affected target 
will be stunned for the next combat round.  In addition, since vitality can 
regenerate at a rate of 25% per round maximum,  it will take several rounds 
before the affected target is back to full movement strength.

Psionic  stuns  will  not travel through closed  doors  or  walls.   It  is 
possible to stun your own troops, so look before you stun!

TYPES OF MARINES

Squad Leader - The squad leader is your main character.   This is the  only 
type of marine who is created independently of any scenarios.

The long-range goal of Breach is to improve this character,  to it is  very 
important that he (or she) does not get killed in combat.  If this happens, 
the  squad leader's file will be erased.   On the other hand,  in order  to 
improve your squad leader's attributes,  he must be an integral part of any 
mission.   As the mission difficulty level rises, you will find it more and 
more necessary to use the squad leader in dangerous situations.

Squad leaders have a very powerful (75% damage) and heavy protective armor.  
A  squad leader is the only marine in a squad who can absorb  several  hits 
from a battle robot.

Marauder  - The marauder is the basic marine.   They carry a heavy  blaster 
and they have a fairly high level of mobility.

Marauders usually comprise the majority of any squad.

Scout  - Scouts have very light,  fast armor,  and carry the same  guns  as 
marauders.

Scouts  usually  carry detectors.   They are used when it is  important  to 
survey  the battle area or find mission objectives (possible prison  areas, 
etc.).

Infiltrator  -  Infiltrators have the same armor as scouts but  a  slightly 
lighter gun.

Infiltrators  usually carry crack units.   They are used when you need  the 
floor plans for the current level.

Psionic  Talent  -  Psionic  talents wear the  same  armor  as  scouts  and 
infiltrators  but they carry a very weak gun.   This gun is only  effective 
against heavily wounded enemy troops.


                               THE OPPONENTS

BASIC CHARACTERISTICS

All  of the intelligent enemies will guard any mission objectives that  are 
in their area.  If a marine is in the same area as a datapack, there aren't 
any player marines around,  and capturing datapacks is an  objective,  then 
the enemy will guard the datapack until a player marine enters the area.

The smaller intelligent enemies (overlords,  marines,  aliens) will use the 
shafts.

Enemy  marines,  overlords,  and  aliens  all  can  have  psionic  ability.  
Overlords  and aliens almost always do.   Their tendency is to  stun  their 
target in one round and shoot them in the next.

MARINES

The enemy marines are all of the marauder type,  but certain scenarios have 
weakened or enhanced marines to simulate squad leaders, scouts, etc.
Enemy marines will use rockets and grenades against your troops.

BEASTS

Beasts are slow and their only armor is their hide, but in large quantities 
they  can  be very dangerous.   Beasts attack by biting and a bite  is  the 
equivalent of a 45% blaster hit.  A beast can only attack adjacent squares.

ALIENS

Aliens  are  lightly armored and very fast.   They will  use  an  effective 
combination of psionic,  grenade,  and rocket attacks against your marines.  
Fortunately,  their blasters are rather weak and almost ineffective against 
marauders and squad leaders.

BATTLE ROBOTS

Battle robots are the most dangerous of all opponents.   A battle robot  is 
very mobile an the twin blaster cannon it carries will destroy all but  the 
luckiest marine with just 2 hits.

Robots do not use rockets or grenades.

Robots cannot use shafts but they can pass through doors.

OVERLORDS

Overlords are the elite of the enemy marines.

Overlords  come equipped with a short range vibrosword which generates  55% 
damage.   Using  the  vibrosword,  the overlord can  only  attack  adjacent 
squares, but overlords almost invariably are psionic talents.

Overlords  have  very  little armor,  relying instead on  fast  and  deadly 
attacks.  When forced into a defensive posture, they are quickly killed.

Overlords do not use grenades or rockets.

AUTOGUNS

Autoguns are the fixed equivalent of battle robots.   The only  differences 
between the 2 are that autoguns don't move and that they generally are more 
accurate.

These  are also very dangerous opponents and must be treated  with  extreme 
caution.


                          OBJECTS AND THEIR USES

ENCUMBRANCE POINTS

There  are 15 different types of objects which may be found in a  scenario.  
Each of those objects has an encumbrance value.   Encumbrance is a  measure 
of the object's bulk.  Obviously, the bulkier the type of object, the fewer 
of them the marine may carry.



     Object               Encumbrance Points
     ---------------------------------------
     Grenade                     1
     Demo Charge                 5
     Stimulant                   1
     Ammo                        2
     MediKit                     3
     Rocket                      3
     Launcher                    7
     Crack Unit                  9
     Detector                    9
     Shield                      1
     Grav Belt                   6
     Prisoner                    1
     Datapack                    1
     
Marines  carrying  a  large number of encumbrance  points  are  subject  to 
movement point loss.

WHAT THEY ARE AND HOW TO USE THEM

Grenade - A short-range energy grenade.

When  a  grenade is selected,  the mouse pointer turns  into  a  crosshair.  
Place  this  crosshair  over any point on the same row  or  column  as  the 
current  marine  and  click.   The marine does not need to  be  facing  the 
target.

Demo Charge - A medium range energy demolition charge.

When a demo charge is selected, the program confirms that you actually want 
to use a demo charge.   If you click "yes", the demo charge will be dropped 
in the same square as the current marine.   When the current marine's  turn 
is  over (running out of mp's,  selecting another marine,  or clicking  the 
"Next" button) the demo charge will explode.

Stimulant - A one-use syringe of a potent metabolic accelerator.  A shot of 
stimulant  will  raise  the marine's vitality level  by  50%,  up  to  100% 
maximum.   If the marine's health is 50% or less,  there is the possibility 
that he may die from heart-shock.

When a stimulant is selected, the current marine will use the stimulant.

Ammo  Clip  - Holds ammunition for the blasters that each  marine  carries.  
The ammo clip is compatible with all of the different types of blasters.

When an ammo clip is selected,  the current marine will add the contents of 
the ammo clip to his current ammo supply.  Each clip holds 50 rounds.

MediKit - Use of the medikit raises the marine's health level by 50%, up to 
100% maximum.

When the mediKit is selected, the current marine will use it.

Rocket - Basically a flying version of the grenade.  A rocket must be fired 
with a launcher.

When a rocket is selected,  the current marine must also have a launcher in 
order to use it.   The rocket will be fired in the direction of the current 
marine's  facing and will fly until it hits a target or leaves the  playing 
field.  A rocket has the same destructive force as a grenade.

Launcher - A light multiple-use rocket launcher.

When a launcher is selected,  the current marine must also have a rocket in 
order  to use it.   A rocket will be fired in the direction of the  current 
marine's  facing and will fly until it hits a target or leaves the  playing 
field.

Crack Unit - A crack unit is a special device primarily intended for use by 
Infiltrator  (IF)  marines.   If  it is successfully  operated  next  to  a 
computer or terminal,  it will dump all of the floor plans for the  current 
level from the opponent's computer system.

When a crack unit is selected and successfully operated, it will reveal all 
of  the  wall  and  interior squares on  the  current  marine's  level  and 
integrate  this data with any landscape which has already been revealed  by 
movement,  et cetera.   If the current marine is not next to a terminal  or 
computer,  the  crack unit will not reveal any new information and it  will 
show only the information which has been gathered thus far.

Detector  - The detector is a special device primarily intended for use  by 
Scout  (SC) marines which creates a radar scan of the surrounding  terrain.  
If  operated by a Scout,  the detector will also reveal any  enemy  marines 
within range and display them as flashing green squares.

When a crack unit is selected and successfully operated, it reveals a 17 by 
17 area of the current level,  centered around the current marine.  It will 
also integrate this data with any landscape which has already been revealed 
by  movement.   If  the  scan is not successful,  it  will  show  only  the 
information which has been gathered thus far.

Shield - A shield will absorb any incoming firearms, vibrosword, or psionic 
attacks,  friend  or  foe.   A shield does not  protect  against  grenades, 
rockets or demo charges.   In order to protect a marine, the shield must be 
in a square between the marine and the enemy firing at him.  If a marine is 
in  the same square as a shield,  the shield will not protect  him.   Every 
time a shield is hit, there is a 10% chance it will be destroyed.

This  object  does not need to be used because it  activates  automatically 
when dropped.

Grav  Belt  -  A marine using the grav belt will float  above  the  ground, 
ignoring terrain costs and movement restrictions.  The only terrain types a 
belt will not move through are closed doors,  solid rock, and walls.  Every 
time a grav belt is used,  there is a 10% chance that the marine will crash 
at the end of his turn.

When a grav belt is selected,  it remains active until the marine runs  out 
of  movement  points,  you click the use icon  again,  select  a  different 
marine, or click the Next button.  Once a grav belt is on, you mat not take 
or drop objects,  use shafts, open doors, use objects, fire the gun, or use 
psionic power until the belt has been switched off.  If the marine ends his 
turn over either a black or a water square,  he will be killed and  removed 
from the game.

Data  Pack  - Data packs are used for storing  information.   A  data  pack 
cannot be used.

Prisoner  - Prisoners are captured personnel from your own  government.   A 
prisoner cannot be used.


                                  TERRAIN

INTERIOR TERRAIN

Walls - The walls come in 4 types:  heavy, medium, thin, and storage.  Demo 
charges will destroy any type of wall;  grenades will destroy only thin and 
storage type walls.  Gunfire will not penetrate walls at all.

Marines cannot pass through or fly above wall squares using a grav belt.

Doors - Marines cannot move through closed doors.

Glass doors require 3 mp to open, steel doors require 5 mp, and power doors 
require 10 mp to open

Marines cannot fly above door squares using a grav belt.

EXTERIOR TERRAIN

Water  - Marines cannot pass through water squares,  although they can  fly 
over them if they are using a grav belt.

If a marine using a grav belt ends his turn over a water square, he will be 
killed and removed from the game.

Solid Rock - Marines cannot fly over or through solid rock squares.

SPECIAL TERRAIN

Shafts - Shafts require 5 mp to enter, and another 5 mp to use.

The Entry Square - In order for your marines to enter the combat zone, this 
square must not be blocked.

The Exit Square - If the current marine is on this square at the end of his 
turn, he will be removed from the combat zone and will no longer be allowed 
to fight.

Stun Fields - When a marine passes through a stun field,  there is a chance 
that  he  will be stunned and unable to move.   This  chance  is  inversely 
proportional  to the marine's vitality.   For example,  if a marine with  a 
vitality of 78% passes through a stun field,  there is a 22% chance that he 
will be stunned.

Empty (Black) Squares - Marines cannot pass through these squares, although 
they can fly over them if they are using a grav belt.

If a marine using a grav belt ends his turn over a black square, he will be 
killed and removed from the game.

                             SCENARIO BUILDER

Breach  includes  a  scenario builder that allows you to  create  your  own 
scenarios or modify existing ones.   To start the scenario builder, double 
click the "SCENARIO" icon.

FILE MENU

New - opens the mapping window and creates a new Breach scenario file.

Open  -  opens  an existing scenario file and displays it  in  the  mapping 
window.   The Open function will automatically display all available Breach 
scenario files.

Close  -  closes the current mapping window and disposes  of  the  scenario 
file.  If the scenario file has been modified, the computer will ask you if 
you  wish to save the scenario file before closing it.   clicking the  "go-
away"  box  on the upper left corner of the mapping window  does  the  same 
thing as selecting Close.

Save - saves the scenario file currently in progress.   If the current file 
is untitled, it acts in the same fashion as Save As.

Save As - saves the current scenario file.

Quit - exits Scenario Builder.

EDIT MENU

Whole  View - generates a compressed view of the entire current map  level.  
Click the mouse to return to the normal mapping mode.   If the click occurs 
on the whole view map,  the window will jump to the equivalent position  in 
the  normal mapping mode.   This serves as a shortcut for moving about  the 
map.

Thread  Object - jumps sequentially through the list of objects which  have 
been placed on the map.   When it jumps to the next object on the list,  it 
moves the map so that the object is in the center of the screen.

Thread  Opponent - jumps sequentially through the list of  opponents  which 
have  been placed on the map.   When it jumps to the next opponent  on  the 
list, it moves the map so that the opponent is in the center of the screen.

Fill  Level - fills the current level with the currently  selected  terrain 
type.  Fill Level will not overwrite objects or opponents.

Copy  Level  - copies the contents of the current level to  another  level, 
excluding objects and opponents.

Briefing - is the area where you enter information for the player about the 
scenario  you have created.   This might be part of a story,  or just  some 
technical information.

On the Atari ST version,  use the Arrow keys, Return, and the Backspace key 
to edit your entry (the Delete key is not supported).

Set  Victory  -  sets the victory  conditions  for  the  scenario.   Rescue 
Prisoners  means the player must take all of the prisoners in the  scenario 
to win.  Capture Data Packs works the same way.  Exit Combat Zone means all 
of the marines who are still living must go through the exit square.   Kill 
%  Opponents  requires  the  player to kill  at  least  the  percentage  of 
opponents entered in the box to win.

The scenario time limit must be set for every scenario.   The other victory 
conditions  must  be  met  before the amount of time  entered  in  the  box 
expires.  Time is in an hours/minutes/seconds format.

The victory conditions can be used in combination.   This means that if you 
select  kill 20% and rescue prisoners,  you must kill at least 20%  of  the 
opponents and rescue all of the prisoners to win.

New Marine - generates a marine for the player's squad.  Name the character 
and  select the character's specialty using the  radio-type  buttons.   The 
different  specialties generate different basic characteristics.   A  squad 
can have up to 19 marines.

Modify Marine - is used to change the basic characteristics of the scenario 
marines.   A  list  box  will  appear with the names  of  all  the  marines 
currently in the squad.   Select a marine by clicking on his name.   Delete 
will  remove a marine from the squad.   The Change button jumps to  another 
screen, where a marine's attributes can be modified.

New  Leader  -  is used to generate a  Squad  Leader.   This  character  is 
independent  of  any scenario.   (You can generate a Squad  Leader  without 
opening  the map window.)  After you have named the  Squad  Leader,  Create 
Leader  saves the Squad Leader file,  after asking for a  file  name.   The 
attributes  of  the Squad Leader may not be modified  directly:  they  only 
increase through actual combat experience.

Examine  Leader  - shows a Squad Leader's current  statistics.   After  you 
select a Squad Leader file name, his statistics are displayed.

LEVEL MENU

Use  the Level menu to select the level of the scenario map being shown  in 
the mapping window.  There are 5 levels in all.

PALETTE MENU

The Palette menu controls the parts & terrain palette.

The  blank  squares found on the objects and opponents palettes  will  only 
erase objects and opponents,  not the underlying terrain.   If a part  will 
not appear where you have clicked, then it cannot be placed on that type of 
terrain.  A scenario can have up to 30 objects and 40 opponents.

OTHER FUNCTIONS

click any terrain square on the palette to select it.   Clicking on the map 
window will place that square on the map.

Holding  a  Shift key and clicking on an enemy character will  display  the 
Modify Opponent dialog window.  Use this to change opponent attributes.

Holding the Shift key and clicking on an object allows you to write a short 
message  which  will appear whenever the player picks  up  that  particular 
object.  This can be used to hide clues within the game.

SCENARIO DESIGN NOTES

Avoid Featurism

A scenario could have 5 levels,  20 marines in the squad, 40 opponents, and 
30  objects.    Resist  the  temptation!    Scenarios  are  generally  more 
successful if they are quick to start and play.   Having to move 20 marines 
through a maze for 40 Player phases is NOT fun.

Supermen Not Wanted Here

Imagine a squad of 20 marines,  each with the maximum of everything against 
a band of normal enemies.   Boring!   Winning all the time is not the point 
of the game.   Try and create scenarios in which the player must  logically 
deploy  his  forces.   Good  scenarios should be a  test  of  the  player's 
decision-making ability, not the random number generator.

Liftshafts, dropshafts, and Levels

The map in Breach uses up to 5 levels.  These levels are organized like the 
floors of a building, with Level 1 being the bottom level and Level 5 being 
the top level.

A  liftshaft  always moves a marine from a lower level to the  next  higher 
one.   Thus,  using  a  liftshaft on Level 3 would move the marine  to  the 
corresponding square on Level 4.  A liftshaft on Level 5 will not work.

A  dropshaft  always moves a marine from a higher level down  to  the  next 
lower one.  Thus, using a dropshaft on Level 3 would move the marine to the 
corresponding square on Level 2.  A dropshaft on Level 1 will not work.

The corresponding square above a liftshaft must be clear in order for it to 
work.

The corresponding square below a dropshaft must be clear in order for it to 
work.


THE SCENARIOS

Included with your game are many scenarios that you can play and modify.  5 
of these scenarios are outlined and rated below.

BREEDER  by Haywood Nichols & Bill Leslie

Difficulty Rating:  Easy

Synopsis:  Wipe out an alien installation where man-eating beasts are being 
developed and rescue the Federated World citizens who are bing used as test 
subjects.

Strategy:   Keep an eye on the mission status.  Avoid spreading your forces 
to areas where they are not needed.

TOWERS  by Bill Leslie

Difficulty Rating:  Medium

Synopsis:  Recover an important datapack from the top of a heavily-defended 
building.

Strategy:   since  you  are not provided with very many  troops,  you  must 
discover an alternate route to the top of the UDP building.

ODYSSEUS  by Haywood Nichols

Difficulty Rating:  Hard

Synopsis:   Capture a United Democratic Planets warship by eliminating  90% 
of  its  crew and recovering any datapacks or prisoners that  might  be  on 
board.

Strategy:   Conserve your supplies for later in the scenario and distribute 
them evenly among your squad.

DEPOT  by Haywood Nichols

Difficulty Rating:  Very Hard

Synopsis:  Destroy a well-established UDP supply depot.

Strategy:   Depot  takes place on a very large map.   remember to  use  the 
crack  unit as soon as possible.   Dividing your forces into 2 squads is  a 
good idea.

ISLAND  by Bill Leslie

Difficulty Rating:  STAR Level

Synopsis:   A  single  man mission to rescue Admiral  Bresheliah  from  the 
depths of a UDP installation.

Strategy:  Speed is of the essence - try not to  over-burden yourself.  The 
recovery  ship is due east of the emergency exit grid square.   Don't  even 
bother if your squad leader isn't a STAR team member.
