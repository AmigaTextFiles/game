                              INTRODUCTION

In a far off time  when magic was real, and an evil queen 
threatened all that was good,  a trio of unlikey heroes joined in 
an epic quest.  The story of their adventures is recorded in  the 
magical scroll you now possess.

                             GETTING STARTED

Before  the  scroll  can  tell the  tale,  you  must  follow  the 
installation  and loading instructions on the enclosed  reference 
card.

                                THE SCROLL

The scroll tells the story of Willow Ofgood and his quest to save 
Elora Danan and defeat the evil Queen Bavmorda.  The scroll  will 
flow  past until its story is told and then it will begin  again. 
If you want to stop the scroll, or if you want to back up or skip 
forward,  use  the  controls on the enclosed  reference  card  to 
control the motion.

The scroll is more then just a story,  however. It is also a door 
way into the world of Willow.  Throughout the scroll you will see 
words  highlighted.  When  you  move the wand  to  one  of  these 
highlighted words and press the button, you will be drawn through 
the  scroll and into the story.  Once there,  you will guide  the 
actions  of  one of the heroes of the Willow saga in his  or  her 
part of the quest.

In ancient writings of this sort, each and every word may hold its 
own special meaning, so the player should explore the scroll very 
carefully-not all the words of power will be readily apparent.  A 
wise player will take nothing for granted.  For example,  if  you 
use  your  wand to select the words Daikini crossroads  from  the 
scroll-just below the image of Nockmaar woods- you will enter the 
Daikini Crossroads game in practice mode.

                            PLAYING WILLOW

There  are two ways to play Willow:in practice mode and in  quest 
mode.  The  first,  the practice mode,  is provided to allow  the 
would be hero a chancer to see the dangers that lie  ahead.  When 
you  play in this way,  almost every segment of the game  may  be 
accessed individually as many times as you like. You can also use 
it has a chance to learn your opponent weaknesses and  strengths, 
to  find  your way through treacherous mazes,  and to  hone  your 
magical  abilities  before actually attempting  to  defeat  Queen 
Bavmorda in the quest.

To practice any game, simply click on the appropriate word in the 
scroll.  If  you click by accident,  you can escape back  to  the 
scroll  by pressing the key on the reference card.  You can  also
quit a game the same way.

The quest mode of play is to start at the beginning of the story, 
and  play through each of the game segments in  order.  You  must 
successfully  complete each segment to save the child and  defeat 
the  queen.  You will have eight chances to fail,  one  for  each 
candle  in  the  Ritual of Obliteration that  Queen  Bavmorda  is 
performing to destroy ELora Danan. To play the game in this mode, 
click  on the word  WILLOW  at the beginning of the  scroll.  You 
will  be taken to the first game,  "Dungeons" and from there  you 
will  trace  the  journey of Willow step by step  to  victory  or 
defeat.

                              THE GAMES

DUNGEONS
The  child Elore Danan has been born in the dungeons of  Nockmarr 
Castle,  the  fortress of Queen Bavmorda.  You take the  part  of 
Ethna,  the  Daikini,  as  she  flees with  the  baby  through  a 
treacherous maze of cooridors.  You must find your way quickly-if 
you linger to long in one place the guards will surely catch you. 
The corridors are tricky and many of the rooms are traps,  so you 
must move carefully but quickly if you are to escape.

You will have the option of going left, right or straight-as long 
as there is a passage in that direction.  You can also  back  up. 
When  you back up,  you will remain facing in the  direction  you 
were going prior to backing up.

WOODS
The first part of Willow's journey is to the Daikini  crossroads. 
to  get  there  he must traverse treacherous  woods  filled  with 
searching Nockmarr troops and Death Dogs.

You  control  the  figure of Willow as  he  tries  to  reach  the 
crossroads.  Willow  can run in any of eight directions,  and  is 
armed with three magical acorns which can turn anything they  hit 
to  stone.  More acorns can be found in the woods,  but they  are 
scarce  so  use  them sparingly.  Avoid the Death  Dogs  and  the 
Nockmaar troops.  If you are attacked and cannot escape, throw an 
acorn at the attacker.  Don't fall in the pits or the swamp,  and 
be   sure  to  cross  the  river  only  by  bridge  or   stepping 
stones.  Speed is of the essence and you must move quickly on the 
path, but you will need to leave the path to find acorns.

DAIKINI CROSSROADS
Here  you  must  choose  which cage  holds  the  Daikini  warrior 
Madmatigan,  and which cage holds death. Select the right cage by 
moving the cursor to it and pressing the button.

SPELLCASTING
Spellcasting is a game of sorcery. You must use all your magic to 
transform  the  good sorceress Fin Razial back from  her  current 
beastial  form.  Because your magic is uncertian,  you must  play 
this game three times throughout the course of the adventure. The 
first time transforms Fin Raziel from a possum like creature into 
a  raven.  The second time she transforms from the raven  into  a 
goat. And the third time she finally regains her humanity.

At the bottom of the screen you will see a row of thirteen  runic 
charms.  Three  of these symbols must be combined in  the  proper 
order  to cause the desired transformation.  If the  symbols  are 
chosen  in the wrong order,  then Fin Razial will be  transformed 
into  some monstrous thing.  If a symbol that is not part of  the 
spell  is chosen,  terrible things will happen and you will  have 
failed.

ICE CAVES:  To escape the mountain top snow camp of General Kael, 
Madmartigan  and  Willow  must take a  desperate  run  down  the
mountian on an enemy's shielf. They find themselves in a twisting
network of icey  caves and  tunnels  which  they  must  carefully
negotiate.

At each junction you will have the option of going left, right or 
continuing straight. There is no way to back up and there is only 
one exit.

BATTLE
In  the  final  assault on  Nockmaar  Castle,  General  Keal  and 
Madmartigan  finally  face eack other in a battle to  the  death. 
Madmartigan  must  defaet  Kael himself on  the  steps  of  Queen 
Bavmorda's tower.

In  this contest of master swordsmen,  you control the figure  of 
Madmartigan.  There  are seven basic movements available to  you, 
and just the right combination will serve to defeat Kael.

Movements with joystick, mouse or numeric key pad;

                          without 'fire' pressed   

                     move left     jump      move right

                     move left     stand     move right

                     move left     duck      move right

                            with 'fire' pressed

                     slash high      jump    slash high

                     thrust middle   stand   thrust middle

                     slash low       duck    slash low

Note:  attack  direction  depends on which way the  character  is 
facing.  The game is won when either Kael or Madmartigan falls.

THE FINAL BATTLE
This game cannot be played in practice mode, it only is available 
if  you  overcome  all the previous challenges  and  have  proved 
yourself  worthy to face Queen Bavmorda in a test of  magic.  You 
must complete the necessary spell before she can  reach the altar 
and  destroy Elora Danan.  The mechanics are similar to those  in 
the  spellcasting game, but the spell is made up of nine  symbols 
instead  of  three.  The outcome is uncertian,  but if  you  have 
studied the lessons of Fin Raziel carefully, you will prevail.


                        CHANGING THE GAME

Once  you  have played through and won Willow,  you may  want  to 
reset  the  game to create new challenges for  yourself.  If  you 
select the Mindscape logo at the end of the scroll, you will have 
various  options available to you.  Among these is the option  to 
reset various settings in the game. If you choose this option all 
of the choices in the game which are variable will be  randomized 
to create a fresh game experience.


                       WILLOW REFERNCE CARD

                         GETTING STARTED

You need an Atari 520,1040 or mega with at least 512K. One or two 
disk drives and a color monitor. A mouse or joystick is optional.

( I am sure everyone knows how to load a game by now!)

                           THE CONTROLS

Willow  can  be  played  using  one  of  three  control  devices-
mouse,joystick or keyboard (numeric pad).  A general  description 
of  each  is given below.  Detailed instructions  for  each  game 
follow.

Mouse:
The mouse is normally used to move  a small,  wand shaped  cursor 
around the screen.  Selections are made by pointing to the choice 
and pressing the left button.  Occasionally,  specific motions of 
the  mouse in the direction you wish the on-screen figure  to  go 
will do the trick.

Keyboard:
When  using  the keyboard,  you will have  several  options.  The
cursor keys are always active and map the motions of a joystick.
If you have a seperate cursor cluster,  you may need to press two 
keys simultaneously to cause diagonal movement. In both cases the 
space bar will act as the fire button.

Joystick:
The joystick does exactly what you would expect. Moving it any of 
the eight directions causes corresponding movement on the screen. 
Whenever the fire button is called for,  use button #1. Button #2 
is never used in Willow.
