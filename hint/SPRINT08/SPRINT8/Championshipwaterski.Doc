Then type your name.

The All-Round Test:
If you choose the all-round test, you will take part in three 
events one after the other (jumping, freestyle and slalom).

The three separate events:
You will only choose jumping, freestyle or slalom.


1.  THE JUMP

This event is divided into two parts:
     -Approaching the ski-jump.  The only command needed is 
acceleration( --> ).
     The jump itself.  Use the directions <-- and --> to 
balance the jump.

N.B. You have three attempts. The best will be taken into 
account on the score table.

2. THE FREESTYLE

This even takes place on two courses, each being 20 seconds 
long.You have to reach a maximum score by doing the different 
movements one after the other.

There movements can be made in the centre of the wake or on 
the waves made by the boat.  To move the skier sideways, use 
the keys  <-- and -->.

The movements are obtained by pressing the FIRe button and a 
direction key or the space-bar and a direction key.
Make sure you press the FIRe button or space-bar at the same 
time as the direction key.


     Movements in the middle of the wake:
               180 degree step

             360 DEGREES  |  360 DEGREES
                      540 DEGREES


NB: With the keyboard you get the diagonal directions by 
pressing two keys at the same time.


Explanation of the figures:

     90 degrees is called a side-slip.
     180 degrees is a half-turn.
     360 degrees is a complete turn.
     540 degrees is one and a half turns.

     A somersault is a sort of half turn in the air! (a 
speciality of Patrice MARTIN).


Some of these figures can be done using the STEP method.  
This means that the skier puts his leg over the traction rope 
whilst rotating.



3. THE SLALOM 


This even takes place in a vast stretch of water.  You have 
to slalom between six buoys from left to right.


NB: You have to go between the first two buoys (they call 
this a gate), and above all, between the last two at the end 
of the course.  The buoys are very easy to recognize because 
they are close together.  As you go along, you will restart 
the course with a shorter rope.
To start the course, press the FIRE button or the space-bar.



                    Commands:


               To loosen the rope
                       |
                       |
    To go left<-------   -------> To go right
                       |
                       |
               To pull the rope

NB: Any time you want to return to the menu, press ESC.
