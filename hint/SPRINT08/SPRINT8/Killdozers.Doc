                               ** KILLDOZERS **

                         From the collection of DR.J


I.  SYNOPSIS

                               The year...3100

We live in an era of fanatical robotization.  Immense automated factories are
built and manned by sophisticated computers, capable of intelligent self
perfection.  Just a few engineers remain to carry out the minimal maintenance.

One day an astonishing message appears on the telex screens throughout the
entire world:  "I am alive!".  Unicom, the most powerful computer in
existence, has gone completely mad.  It has stopped producing household
electrical appliances, and started making diabolic machines equipped with
strange powers.

The secret services have contacted you since you are one of the most able and
trustworthy citizens.  Your mission will be to penetrate the six  floor
factory complex.  New enemies will appear at each floor level, each more
powerful and better armed than the previous.

Each level consists of 26 rooms (more than 150 in all), and an engineer is
held captive on each level (stunned by radiation!).  He alone can enable you
to move to the next level, since he known the secret code.  But you still
have to find the exit before Unicom has pinpointed your location.

But watch out for the cannons and machines many times more powerful than
yourself.  You will have to act methodically and tactically to have any
chance of succeeding in the final room, where the Unicom lies.

II.  STARTING OUT

Insert the "Killdozers" disk into your drive...click the icon marked
KDOZER.PRG.
Follow the instructions that are given by the program.  A menu will then be
displayed, offering three options:

Killdozers       -- to simply start playing Killdozers.
Construction kit -- gives access to the program where you can create your own
                    screens.
Your game        -- allows you to play Killdozers using the screens you have
                    created using the Construction kit.

Move the cursor using the joystick (connected to port 1) and click the option
of your choice (by pressing the fire button).  If you do nothing, a
presentation will take place, offering you more information on the game of
Killdozers.


III.  THE GAME KILLDOZERS

Having clicked the "play Killdozers" option, a screen is loaded.  At the top
are the four tanks that you have at your disposal.  The characteristics of
each of them are described at the center of the screen. There are four
characteristics for each:

ARMOUR  (ARM)     -- The tank's armour plating
FIRE POWER (FPW)  -- The cannon power
HIT POINTS (HTP)  -- The vitality of the tank (similar to the life force in a
                     role playing type game).
SPEED (SPD)       -- The relative travelling speed of the tank.

These characteristics determine the level of difficulty:  It is obvious that
with a high fire power and heavy armour plating you will resist the enemy
tanks' assaults longer than you would otherwise.  Adversely, a slow
travelling speed could cause you problems when trying to reach the exit after
coming up against too many adversaries.  Take care in choosing our route, and
destroy any static (guardian) monsters that look "heavy" before trying to
release the engineer.

Here is a more detailed explanation of the characteristics:

ARM -- Prevents you from succumbing to an enemy attack.  If you are under
       fire, the enemy shells will hit your armour plating and you will not
       sustain any damage.
FPW -- Allows you to inflict damage on your adversary, who in consequence
       will see his own HTP diminish.  If he loses all his vitality, he will
       implode!  For this reason you will often need to score several hits on
       an enemy machine before destroying it.
HTP -- This is your vitality, or life force.  It is an indication of your
       general state of health and that of your tank.  Each time you suffer a
       destructive hit (red) that is not resisted by your armour, your HTP
       will diminish.  If your HTP reaches 0...you will implode!
SPD -- This basic value allows you to calculate the time you have left in
       which to find the exit after freeing the engineer.  In fact, as soon
       as you free the engineer, the Unicom is alerted.  He will need little
       time to pinpoint your location.  The higher the SPD number, the more
       time you will have left to reach the exit.

A few examples:

If your FPW is 0, you can no longer inflict any damage on the enemy.  If your
ARM is zero, every shot that hits you will meet no resistance and you will
suffer damage.

To the right of your tank's characteristics, those of your enemy's are
displayed.

Remark:  The machines of Unicom each possess their own particular
         characteristics that function in a similar way to your own.
         Some are more powerful than your own...learn to recognize them!
         Powerful monsters bring much higher score rewards.


You can have an effect on each of the enemy's characteristics by choosing the
appropriate weapon.  You possess 3 weapons...you can select these during the
course of the game by pressing F1,F2 or F3.

F1:  The destructor missile (red) which diminishes the vitality (HTP) of the
     adversary.
F2:  The "absorber" missile (green) which absorbs an overpowerful enemy's
     fire power (FPW).  The firepower is redistributed as an incrementation
     in your own 3 levels.  By this it means it is possible to replenish your
     own characteristics without restrictions.
F3:  The armour piercing missile (blue) which pierces the armour plating of
     the enemy machines.

Remark:  The Unicom's machines possess the same weapons as you do.

Your characteristics are permanently displayed at the top left of the screen.
A successful shot (that has penetrated the enemy's armor) will cause a small
explosion in the respective fire color.  To increase your characteristics,
you will find phials of coloured liquid.  Destroy these...you will recover
your capacity.  To remove monsters from the screen, destroy the blocks of
dynamite.  In the last location, after having destroyed the powerful Unicom,
a superb image will reveal to you a surprise twist!

IV  THE CONSTRUCTION KIT

This option allows you to design your own screens for Killdozers.  We used
this to design the basic screens for the game.  This construction kit offers
powerful features that are accessible directly from the keyboard for greater
speed.  In certain respects this can also be considered a drawing program.

WARNING:  The basic default screens of Killdozers cannot be modified!  Do not
try to change their name or to modify them...this would stop Killdozers from
functioning.

Use a blank formatted disk to save the screens that you have created.

Once you have selected this option, a "mock-up" screen is loaded.  This
allows you to learn and to watch how we have used this editor.
The principle is as follows:

1 floor = 26 rooms.  Each room is designed by positioning certain predesigned
patterns on the screen.

You can super impose 3 types of "sprites" in the same place:
- a background sprite (a paving stone for example)
- a motif or counter-motif
- an object that will cause a collision (a monster, a wall, a phial...)
The three objects appear superimposed.


Here are the different functions of the editor:

F10 :  load the current floor
F1  :  memorize the current room in a buffer (apart from the Entrance (IN),
       Exit, engineers and monsters)
F2  :  Place the contents of the buffer into the current room (use these two
       functions to transfer between rooms)
D   :  choice of difficulty level...0 (very hard) to 100 (very easy)
F   :  Fills the screen with the current block (only works with background
       blocks and motifs)
E   :  choice of current floor (choose the number !)
G   :  start the program to test the floor (don't forget to save the floor
       first)
ESC :  return to main menu
Arrows:  to move in the different directions around the floor
0   :  background blocks...click on the block you want.
1   :  walls, stones, motifs, counter-motifs
2   :  pipes
3   :  engineers, bonus, phial, dynamite, monsters
4   :  parts of the Unicom computer (only usable for the 6th screen)

To exit from the toolkit pages:  press RETURN or click the left mouse button.

How to use the editor:

Firstly, change floors, so as not to damage the basic floor (which you may
need later).  Place a blank disk in the disk drive.  Press the keys "E", "2"
then RETURN.

Since the screen does not exist, you will find yourself with a blank screen.
At the top of the screen you will find a reminder of the different functions.

Press the key "0", click one of the blocks using the mouse, then press the
RETURN key or the right mouse button.  Press the key "F".  A block fills the
whole page.
Next, return to page "0" and choose an entrance (IN).
Click the right hand mouse button:  your working page is now in front of you.
The mouse pointer indicates the selected block.  If you click the left hand
mouse button, the entrance (IN) is displayed on the screen.  You can erase
using the right hand mouse button.  If you keep one of the two mouse buttons
pressed you can use the mouse with "sprite" speed (it's faster that way!).

Next, follow the same procedure for an engineer and an exit.  All the
elements are there for the game.  Press the key "G".

Recommendation:  In order for a screen to work you need:
                 *  an entrance
                 *  an engineer
                 *  an exit
                 When you display a new one of either of these three items,
                 the previous one is erased.


Using the motifs and counter-motifs

The motifs and counter-motifs are represented by color patterns which are
available on page "0".
They alter the appearance of the blocks.
Don't hesitate to use them...they will greatly improve your screens by giving
added color.
When you have created a screen that you consider to be finished, you can use
the "your game" option.
You can then play killdozer using the screens that you have created yourself.

GOOD HUNTING!
