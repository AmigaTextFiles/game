Bubble Bobble FAQ Version 2.00
------------------------------

Welcome to my update of the Bubble Bobble FAQ. Since Bubble Bobble has
now been emulated through the efforts of MAME a lot more information
about the game has come to light, especially from the author of the
MAME driver Chris Moore (chris.moore@writeme.com). He was able to
delve deep into Bubble Bobble ROMs and extract all sort of wonderful
information about my favourite game, stuff we all thought was random,
but now we know better. Contact me ghall@eis.net.au if you ever have
anything to add. If that address is no longer valid, you can always do
a search for "Bubble Bobble Home Page" on any search engine and you
should be able to locate me. This FAQ is based on the ARCADE version
of the game only, which is perfectly emulated in MAME.

What is Bubble Bobble ?
-----------------------

Bubble Bobble was an arcade game released by Taito in 1986. You have
to guide the two heroes Bub and Bob through 100 levels of adventure to
rescue their girlfriends. It was one of the first two player
co-operation games (although all co-operation goes out the window when
a 50,000 pt diamond goes down the middle of the screen and you race to
see who can get the points first ). It was one of the first games to
have joystick combinations that allow you to power-up your original
characters. It has spawned a couple of sequels, Rainbow Islands ( a
much better, but harder to find game ), Parasol Stars and in the last
few years Bubble Symphony and Bubble Memories. There is also the
Puzzle Bobble (Bust-A-Move) series of games that unite Bub and Bob
together in a completely different, but just as playable games.

Bubble Bobble gameplay
----------------------

One of the great things about this game was all of the different
hidden things that were discovered by playing the game. Basically you
have to clear each room of all the enemies to let you advance to the
next room. You did this by trapping the enemy inside your bubbles and
then bursting the bubbles. Along the way you could pick up powerups
and extra weapons that were only available for that room, some stayed
with you until you died. As a rule only one food bonus and one weapon
bonus per room.

The basic power-ups are as follows :-

Yellow bubblegum (sweeties)-increase bubble firing speed. 
Purple bubblegum (sweeties)- make the bubble travel further. 
Blue bubblegum (sweeties)-increase the bubble speed across screen. 
Red shoe-faster moving Bub and Bob.

A complete list of items is available at the end of this FAQ.

How to make the letters appear
------------------------------
1. EXTEND-bubbles appear only on "open levels" (levels where bubbles fly
   in from a "hole" in the ceiling or the bottom)
2. EXTEND-bubbles appear only when you've popped in the previous
   non-open-stages 3 or more enemy-trapped-bubbles at once. The more enemies
   popped at once, the more DIFFERENT EXTEND-bubbles will come. (I'm
   sure this is valid for ALL previous stages up to an "open-level";
   I hope I've described that well!)

   It goes something like this:
   Enemies popped at a time      Different EXTEND-bubbles to come
            2                                 none
            3                                 1
            4                                 2
            5                                 3
            6                                 4
            7                                 5
            8                                 ALL! (6)

3. When you're on an "open stage" you may want to try to pop more than
   3 enemies at a time because the upper table applies to the CURRENT
   stage, too (if it is an "open stage" that is).
4. Any EXTEND letters that you haven't collected by the end of a stage
   reappear on the next open level, but are randomly selected again.
   So if you are offered a letter that you don't need, it may be worth
   leaving it, and hoping it is reincarnated as a more useful letter on
   the next level.


Secrets and hidden stuff
------------------------

These codes must be entered on the title screen showing Bubble Bobble
written inside a cloud.

LEFT JUMP LEFT 1P LEFT BUBBLE LEFT 1P- it will say power up at the
bottom of the screen and you will have fast feet, fast bubbles, etc

BUBBLE JUMP BUBBLE JUMP BUBBLE JUMP RIGHT 1P-the screen will say
original game mode and you will get the bonus doors whether you die or
not.

1P JUMP BUBBLE LEFT RIGHT JUMP 1P RIGHT-this gives you super on the
title screen. You play the game in the same order as normal Bubble
Bobble but with different monsters. This is the only mode that lets
you see the "True Ending" to this game.


High score table tricks
-----------------------

One of the first games to feature bonuses when you entered the right
initials in the high score table. Just finish a game and enter the
initials below, the effects are described next to the initials. They
mainly effect the second bonus object that appears on the first
set. The best way to reap the rewards is to bubble the 3 monsters and
wait for the second bonus to appear, get the bonus and then blow as
many bubbles as possible so you get the maximum points available. You
might want to blow bubbles and burst them while you wait or run along
the bottom of the screen to make certain bonuses appear on the next
level, read further down to see what I mean.


SEX  pitch fork-flying cakes/vegetables/etc across the screen, turn enemy
     into 6k diamonds (don't bubble them)
TAK  octopus-turns bubbles into X's at end of level
STR  flamingo-turns bubbles into smiling turds at end of level
KTT  beer-turns bubbles into pizzas at end of level, what a perfect match !!!
...  knife-flying cakes/vegetables/etc across the screen, turns enemy into
     6k diamonds
I.F coke can-flying sunflowers across the screen, turn enemies into 6k diamonds
MTJ coke can-flying sunflowers across the screen, turn enemies into 6k diamonds
NSO coke can-flying sunflowers across the screen, turn enemies into 6k diamonds
KIM coke can-flying sunflowers across the screen, turn enemies into 6k diamonds
YSH coke can-flying sunflowers across the screen, turn enemies into 6k diamonds


Other tricks and tips
---------------------

This is one of the coolest cheats in Bubble Bobble. You get this if
you lose your last dino in a treasure room. Normally, you only get
treasure rooms if you have reached levels 20, 30 and 40 without dying,
and you exit a treasure room if you die once, so the only way to do
this is if you are using the "original game" cheat that gives you
treasure rooms anyway. When you lose your last dino in a treasure
room, your level is recorded as 102, and then all the demo screens
turn to treasure rooms and the next game you play you get a treasure
room on level 1!

Also, the fruit bonus is *not* random. If the hundreds and tens digits
are the same when you kill the last enemy, all bubbles on the screen
turn into fruit (levels 90-99 have different items, not fruit). A nice
trick here: Have one player ready to pop the last enemies, and have
the other player shoot bubbles into a wall until the digits match...
THEN have the first player kill them.  You see, the game doesn't care
WHOSE digits match - could be either.  Bonus fruit on every round!

The items that you get for a score of the format abcdd0 are shown here:

score item
...000  french fries
...110  double scoop ice cream cone
...220  creme caramel
...330  burger
...440  slice of cake
...550  cupcake
...660  mug of beer
...770  sausage on a stick
...880  white ice cream cone
...990  double blue lolly

The items that you get for matching your tens and hundreds to your partner's
are listed here. Although both the tens and hundreds column need to be
matched, only the tens column affects what item appears. They turn out to be
the lowest 10 food items (the vegetables). They are, of course, all worth
700 points.

points item
...00  green pepper
...10  aubergine
...20  carrot
...30  onion
...40  beetroot
...50  turnip
...60  parsnip
...70  marrow
...80  pea pod
...90  mushroom

Bubbles also turn into fruit if the hundreds and tens digits of the
scores of both players are the same (but the hundreds and tens not
necessarily the same as eachother) eg BOTH players scores end in ...120.
   ...120.

Bubbles turn to fruit all the time on levels 1,5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40,
45,50,85,86,92,93,94

Each treasure room has a secret message.  The messages can be decoded
by recognising that the first 26 characters stand for the letters of
the alphabet.  This code is needed to read the message you get at the
end of the game that tells you how to do a Super BB power up.


When time runs out, and the skels come out to get you, if you die,
when you're brought back to life, and STILL FLASHING (vital!), run
over and touch your friend's skel. POOF!  No more skel.

"True Ending" to this game.
-------------------------

When you finish the game in normal mode you see a screen telling you
"But it was not a true ending.....". To get the true ending to the game
all you need to do is enter the Super Bubble Bobble cheat at the intro
screen and finish the game with out losing a man (easier typed then
done) when you finish the game you will see your parents rescued as
well as your girlfriends. That's all there is too it.

Bubble Bobble or Bobble Bobble
------------------------------

Bubble Bobble is the original version of the game and Bobble Bobble is
the pirate copy, if you look at the cloud in the background you can
see the bad job they did of hacking the graphics. There is also some
variation in game play. On my board you can choose a Japanese version
of the game that comes up with a copyright notice at the beginning or
an English version of the game. There is no difference in the
gameplay. On the original board you can switch between BB and Super
BB. I have played a version where you could pick original on the board
and on level 6 , and subsequent levels, the guys in the white robes
will roll rocks at you. There seems to be many variations of this
game. Latest information suggest that there are at least 4 different
ROM sets for this game, eventually MAME will hopefully support them
all.

Other platforms
---------------

Bubble Bobble is available on the Apple II, IBM, Atari ST, C64/128,
Amiga, Gameboy, Game Gear, Playstation, Saturn, MSX and NES.

If you wish to play the actual arcade game on your PC/MAC/Linux etc go
get a copy of mame and enjoy it, MAME is actually the arcade game

conversions that are out there, unless you just want them for having
them's sake.

The following lists were made by Chris Moore, he wrote the driver for
MAME and has found out much more than anyone could by just playing the
game, for this we owe him our thanks. (chris.moore@writeme.com)

SPECIAL ITEMS
-------------

The game maintains a bunch of counters which keep a record of how many
times you have done various things.  Once a counter reaches its
threshold, it is reset to zero and you get the item which that counter
is associated with.  Counters are only checked at the beginning of
each round.  If two or more counters reach their thresholds in the
same round, the one which is associated with the highest numbered item
is used.  The other(s) will keep their value for the next screen.  The
counters aren't reset at the beginning of each game, which is why on
the arcade game there is generally a special item on the first screen,
but in the emulation the first game you play doesn't offer a special
item, since the counters are all reset when the machine is first
switched on.

In the following, the ITEM_DATA line contains:

        XXXX ( AA BB CC DD ) EE

XXXX is the address of the counter which is used

AA BB CC and DD are the 4 possible thresholds which the counter must
reach before you get the item.  Which one of the 4 values is used
depends on the 'difficulty' setting that the game is currently running
at:

     CC for difficulty 00-04
     DD for difficulty 05-07
     BB for difficulty 08-0B
     AA for difficulty 0C-1E

initial difficulties are: 0D (v.hard), 0A (hard), 04 (easy) and 07
(normal) for the 4 dip-switch settings.  The difficulty changes
throughout the game, going higher when you gain extra lives, lower
when you die, and other things affect it, too, which I don't know
about.

EE is non-zero if the bell should warn us that the item is around

The ITEM_ACTION sections (where I've put them in) are useful for
'cheating' in MAME.  Where it's like 'IX+$31', the address is E691+31
for P1 and E6C3+31 for P2.  So, for example, a cheat would be:
        boblbobl:0:e6f4:80:0:Long Range Bubbles (P2)
because e6c3+31 is e6f4.

'time' is how long the previous level took to complete.
It's stored in address f456, and can be displayed during the game
using 'mame boblbobl -cheat' and the 'memory watch' facility off the
'cheat' menu.

if (in attract mode - a no player game) {
        item = random ($14...$33)       (gives range $14...$33)
} else if (on level 1) {

FIREBALL BUBBLE
---------------

It appears that the fireball bubble is randomly created.  Whenever a
bubble floats onto the screen, there is a 1 in 4096 chance that it is
incarnated as a fireball bubble.  It looks as if at some point in the
design of the game it was intended for this kind of randomness to
happen more, since there is a routine which implements randomness with
a whole bunch of preset odds:

       ID      odds               ID      odds

       01     1 in 1
       03     1 in 2              19     1 in 64
       05     1 in 3              1B     1 in 128
       07     1 in 4              1D     1 in 256
       09     1 in 5              1F     1 in 512
       0B     1 in 6              21     1 in 1024
       0D     1 in 7              23     1 in 2048
       0F     1 in 8              25     1 in 4096 (default)
       11     1 in 9              27     1 in 8192
       13     1 in 10             29     1 in 16384
       15     1 in 16             2B     1 in 32768
       17     1 in 32             2D     1 in 65535

the odd thing is, though, that the routine is only ever used with an
ID of 25, and only for the fireball bubble.  This table can be used to
'tune' the rarity of the fireball bubble, by altering the content of
location 6e30 of CPU 0.  MAME provides a convenient way of doing this,
with its 'cheat' mechanism.

MAME BOBLBOBL CHEATS
--------------------

First edit the 'cheat.dat' file, and add lines like this:

boblbobl:0:6e30:01:0:fireball bubble - always!
boblbobl:0:6e30:07:0:fireball bubble - 1 in 4
boblbobl:0:6e30:15:0:fireball bubble - 1 in 16
boblbobl:0:6e30:1d:0:fireball bubble - 1 in 256

then run MAME using a command line like this:

        mame boblbobl -cheat

then you'll find there's a new menu entry on the gui, called 'cheat',
from which you can select the frequency you want!

Here's a bunch of other cheats that I've played with - just a random
selection that happen to be in my cheat.dat file - some are more
useful than others, and most of the spoil the fun of the game...

 where IX=E691 for P1 and IX=E6C3 for P2)

If you want to try any level just edit the line below
boblbobl:0:e64b:XX:0:Level XX where XX is the level number in HEX format
