KINGS QUEST III:

        When casting a spell and are asked to recite a verse, just press
        'RETURN'.

        The king's quest series of games uses the debug and interpreter for
        the programmers (up to KGIII).  Hold down 'ALT' and press 'D'.  Now
        let up on the keys and press 'RETURN' or 'ENTER' twice.  Next type
        "GET OBJECT" and press return.  The prompt 'OBJECT NUMBER:' will
        appear.  Now enter a random number.   Or, type "TP" and press
        'RETURN' and when the prompt appears enter a random number to be 
        transported to different locations.

        Neither of these cheats appear to work on the budget re-release of
        the game.
