NEUROMANCER:
                    
        When you first begin, sell all your body parts.  You can get along
        just fine without them for now, and it gives you enough to get a
        half way decent deck.  You will eventually need to buy them back
        before you start entering cyber-space, or you will be killed easily.



                         PLAYERS GUIDE


PART I    PLACES TO GO AND THINGS TO DO (REAL WORLD).
     Since this game is of a mostly nonlinear structure
(meaning that you don't have to most things in any particular
order), I've set this list up in alphabetical order. You can
usually do these things in any order you want, except for a
few.  But I'll let you find those out on your own.

ASANO COMPUTERS- You buy most of your hardware from this guy.
If you insult Crazy Edo, Asano will give you a price break.
He doesn't like Crazy Edo or his friends. By the way, get rid
of the deck you start out with (UXB) and get a Blue Light
Special when you can afford it. The Blue Light can hold more
programs. But as soon as you can afford one, get a cyberspace
compatible deck.

BANK GEMEINSCHAFT- You can enter the vault using the code
BG1066. Then you can use the jack inside the vault to reach
Cyberspace Zone 5.

BANK OF BERNE- Talk to the secretary about opening up an
account, she'll leave, then go into the manager's office and
use the jack to reach Cyberspace Zone 3.

BODY SHOP- Here you can raise quick cash by selling body
parts. Or you can spend quick cash buying them back. Use your
Bargaining skill to get a price break. You want to have all
or most of your original parts before you get into any heavy
cyberspace battles, though, cause the cheap organ
replacements you get when you sell a part don't hold up like
original equipment; your constitution is lowered.

CHATSUBO BAR (WHERE GAME BEGINS)- Talk to Ratz till you find
out all the information he has. Use PAX machine and read ALL
messages. Leave message to Armitage including your BAMA ID#
(056306118) and make a quick $10,000.

CHEAP HOTEL- Buy caviar (after editing bill) to give to Crazy
Edo.

CRAZY EDO'S- Trade caviar for Comlink 2.0

DONUT WORLD- Use Coptalk skills 1 & 2 to find out various
linkcodes and passwords from the surly cop there.

GENTLEMAN LOSER- Ask Shiva about "Chip" and "Guest Pass";
she'll give you those. Ask her about "Loser" and she'll tell
you the Loser's database linkcode and password. You can also
purchase Hardware Repair chip from her. But don't insult her
or come on to her, she'll kick your butt.

HOUSE OF PONG- Talk to the weird monk, but don't ridicule
him. Trade Holy Joystick (from Metro Holographix) for Zen and
Sophistry skill chips. The monks are ok if you don't make fun
of their beliefs (strange as they may be).

HITACHI BIOTECH- Sell lungs for experiment, and use jack to
reach Cyberspace zone 2.

HOSAKA- Pick up paycheck after editing employee records to
include yourself. Use jack to reach Cyberspace zone 2. You
can only pick up 1 check a week, no matter how many times you
put yourself on their employee roster.

LARRY'S MICROSOFTS- Buy Coptalk skill chip from Larry Moe.
After you get him arrested (see the entry about Chiba
Tactical Police in next part of this doc), go into the
Panther Moderns meeting room (see entry on Panther Moderns in
this part).

MAAS BIOLABS- After disabling their security system (see Maas
Biolabs entry in next part of this doc), use the gasmask to
survive the nasty virus they have floating around in there.
Talk to the robot and he will implant Cybereyes in you.

MASSAGE PARLOUR- Buy information from the hooker, Aikiko, but
watch out. Whenever you do, you'll get busted! And everytime
you get busted, you'll spend money!

MATRIX RESTAURANT- Ask Emperor Norton about "chips" and he'll
sell you Logic, Musicianship, and Software Analysis. Ask him
about "upgrades" and he'll upgrade some of your skills for
you (at a cost, of course). Ask him about "passwords" and
he'll give you some passwords. Use the PAX machine to check
messages and news.

METRO HOLOGRAPHIX- Talk to the Finn and get Icebreaking and
Debug skills (ask him about skills or chips). Ask him about
"joystick" and he'll sell you the Holy Joystick, which you
take to the House of Pong around the corner. Various warez
are sold here as well, but none that you can't download free
from databases.

PANTHER MODERN'S MEETING ROOM (In the back of Larry's
Microsofts)- Talk to Lupus Yonderboy about Sense/net, and
he'll give you the security pass for it. Ask him about banks,
and he'll give you a bank code to get $$$$ from. Ask him
about skills or chips and he'll give you the Evasion skill
chip.

SECURITY GATE- Tell the computer you're a Hitachi volunteer,
or, after editing Hosaka's employee roster, tell it you're a
Hosaka employee.

SENSE/NET- Give security pass and the Rom construct Library
code (0467839) to get the rom construct of the Dixie
Flatline.

SHIN'S PAWNSHOP- Get UXB deck from Shin. If you don't have
the cash, it's free.

STREETWALKER- Learn locations of several places around Chiba
by asking her about them. Find out the linkcode for Central
Justice () from her.

WAREHOUSE (Julius Deane's place)- Ask Julius about Fuji,
Hosaka, Musabori, Hitachi, and Tozoku, and he'll give you
info on each of them. Ask about hardware. Buy the gasmask,
Philosophy, Phenomenology, Psychoanalysis, and Bargaining
skill chips. Buy the Cryptology skill upgrade. Not all, of
course, in the same visit or you'll be broke.

ZION CLUSTER- Ask old rasta-dude about Gemeinschaft and he'll
give you the vault code (BG1066). Use Musicianship skill to
play dub for him, and he'll get another guy, Maelcum, to give
you a free ride to Freeside. This saves you $500.00 over
taking the shuttle to Freeside directly.


PART ][ DATABASES AND WHAT TO DO THERE
     There are 2 types of databases available to you in this
game: the ones you can reach with a link code and the proper
Comlink, and the ones that are only accessible from
cyberspace. Accordingly, this section is divided into two
parts describing each of them. The descriptions will include
the base's link code, password(s), what Comlink is required
to access the database, what warez can be gotten there, other
stuff that can be gotten or done there, its cyberspace
coordinates, whether it has an AI or not, and.  if so, the
AI's name and weakness.
     Some databases have message systems similar to the one
on the PAX system, and it's a very good idea to read ALL the
things available for you to read in every database. You'll
get valuable information this way. Again, these are in
alphabetical order, not in chronological order.
     I will list the information about the databases in the
following manner:
