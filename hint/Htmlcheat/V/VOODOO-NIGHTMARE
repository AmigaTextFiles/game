VOODOO NIGHTMARE:
                    
        All the nasties go to sleep at night.  When you pause a game, the
        day/night timer still runs.  Thus it is possible to play only during
        the safe night periods, and pausing the game during the dangerous
        daylight.

            MISSION 1:  Feed the monkey on your back bananas.  Eventually,
                        this will give him a bad case of diarrhoea, and
                        he'll run off to a secluded spot.

            MISSION 2:  Reunite the lion cub with his mum.  Look in the
                        tree trunks.

            MISSION 3:  Save a sick native, buy medicine.
