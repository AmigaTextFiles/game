JIMMY WHITE'S 'WHILWIND' SNOOKER:

        During play, press 'F7', 'F4', and 'F1' (you should hear a double
        click noise).  Exit to the main menu and select demo mode.  A new
        option should have appeared {DO A 147 BREAK}.  Select it and watch
        the computer play perfectly.

        When all the red balls are off the screen you can choose the color
        of the next ball to hit the pocket by pressing:
                        '2' - YELLOW       '5' - BLUE
                        '3' - GREEN        '6' - PINK
                        '4' - BROWN        '7' - BLACK
