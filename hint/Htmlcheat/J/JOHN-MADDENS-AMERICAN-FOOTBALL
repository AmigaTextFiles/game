JOHN MADDEN'S AMERICAN FOOTBALL:

        To get the ball back when you're kicking off (all the time with some
        teams).  When the kicking meter is on the screen put the direction
        full to the right with no power at all.  Cincinnati, Kansas,
        All Madden, and Minnesota can get the ball all the time.
