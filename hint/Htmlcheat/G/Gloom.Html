        On disk 2 of gloom in the dir 'misc' there is a file named 'script'.
        Use a XPK decruncher or Crunchmania to decompress this file.  Now
        load the file into a text editor and you will be able to edit the
        script to start at any level.  Now save the script and recrunch it
        with Crunchmania or a XPK packer that supports Crunchmania.  I used
        XFDcruncher/decruncher, which is available on Aminet.
