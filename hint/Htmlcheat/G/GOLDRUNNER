GOLDRUNNER:

        During play press 'I' to skip to the bonus level and press 'U' on
        the bonus level to go to the next level.  Hold 'F5' for a couple of
        seconds and you will become indestructable.  Press 'F2', 'F5',
        'F4', 'F3' one at a time for infinite everything.

        Type 'EASYMODE' on the high-score table.  From now on, F9 skips
        levels and makes you invulnerable.  F8 turns off the cheat mode.
