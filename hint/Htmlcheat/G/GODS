GODS:
            
        On level two, buy a shield and a magic potion, then get three
        fireballs and three stars.  Spend all of your remaining money on
        food and health.  Collect all the gems in the usual manner, then
        get a key and make for the exit.  Now comes the tricky bit.  When
        you descend the last ladder, two thieves will appear.  Make sure
        that you don't quite have enough energy to survive a direct
        contact!  Before going down the ladder, release your magic potion,
        then climbdown and open the door.  Stand in front of the door
        ready to leave, but don't push up yet!  Wait until the thieves
        jump down at you and as soon as they touch you push the joystick
        up.  You may loose that life, but then something rather strange
        will happen.  The bonus will start to whiz up for quite some time,
        until the game starts again on world two with 28 extra men and
        about five million points!
