YOGI BEAR'S BIG CLEAN UP:

        On the screen right after the title screen, the one with the
        animation, type "LETS LOOK AT WHAT YOU COULD HAVE WON".  Then type
        "SUPER SMASHING GREAT".  Now press 'P' to unpause the game and press
        the joystick button to start the game.  This will give you infinite
        energy and will enable the following keys:

                   'F1-F5'________Skip to corresponding level.
                   '1'-'8'______________________Select object.
                   'TAB'___________________________Open exits.

        On the same screen type "FRITH MODE".  I'm not sure what this does
        as of yet.
