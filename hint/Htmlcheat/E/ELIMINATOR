ELIMINATOR:

        Here are some of the level codes (press 'HELP' on the title screen
        and type one in):

            LEVEL 02-"AMEOBA"   LEVEL 06-"ENIGMA"   LEVEL 10-"ICICLE"
            LEVEL 03-"BLOOOP"   LEVEL 07-"FLIPME"   LEVEL 11-"JAMMIN"
            LEVEL 04-"CHEEKI"   LEVEL 08-"GEEGEE"   LEVEL 12-"KIKONG"
            LEVEL 05-"DOINOK"   LEVEL 09-"HANDEL"   LEVEL 13-"LAPDOG"
                                LEVEL 14-"MIKADO"


        There is a bug on level five.
        If you fall in the water when collecting the weapon icon on the
        right hand side, the program goes into a loop.

        To gain high scores, you should be prepared to lose ships at
        strategic points - just before the next 10,000 bonus - so you can
        shoot things twice and build up your score.
