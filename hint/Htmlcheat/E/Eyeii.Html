        1. Load the game as normal and select "CREATE NEW PARTY". When the
           empty boxes appear, click on the top left box, then select race,
           class, alignment and portrait.  Now go to the modify box and
           boost all the statistics in this order:  STRENGTH, INTELLIGENCE,
           WISDOM, DEXTERITY, CONSTITUTION, CHARISMA, AND HIT POINTS.  Now
           you can click on strength and boost it to maximum, regardless of
           limitation put on the race or class of the character, so from
           now on, for example, you can have a super-hard wizard with a
           strength of 18/99.<BR><BR>
        
        2. At the character generation screen, always increase all stats
           that you can (that includes hit points) to as high as they will
           go.<BR><BR>
        
        3. If you want a mage, cleric or paladin to use a two handed
           weapon as well as magic, then do the following. Put the weapon
           down on the ground, and their spellbook or magic symbol in their
           second hand.  Click the right mouse button on this for a list of
           spells to appear.  Pick up the two handed weapon and place it in
           the characters primary hand.  As the list of spells is still up,
           they can now cast spells and use a two handed weapon at the same
           time.  You will have to repeat this process after using the
           compass etc.<BR><BR>
           
        On the wasp level, stand on the spot where the two rooms join (the
        room to the south which has a crack in the wall - the hornet's
        nest) and rest.  This should generate four wasps which can be
        killed easily to gain experience points.
