ENLIGHTENMENT-DRUID II:

        To find the secret levels at the start of the game immediately go
        left to the desert, then continue left to the firezone.  Head to
        the upper most left corner of this area and you should see lava
        with a patch on it that looks like a section of the firewall spell.
        As quickly as you can, walk on this patch and you will be whisked
        away to secret levels.
