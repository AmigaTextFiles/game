        Make two copies of disk 2 then make up your parties on both disks.
        Play the game as usual, but when you find any secret passages or
        walls, or unlock any doors, insert the other disk and continue
        playing for a short while.  This passes all the data onto this
        disk.  Replace the original disk and continue playing and now, if
        you get stuck in the game and you have to start again, simply
        continue with the other disk and all the doors that were previously
        locked will be open. Plus, you'll be able to pick up the keys that
        you needed to unlock them as a bonus!<BR><BR><BR>

Portals<BR>
^^^^^^^<BR><BR>
The dwarves that built the halls beneath the Waterdeep sewers used a 
series of magic portals to move quickly through their underground 
empire. These portals are now used by Xanathar and his minions as a 
system of high-speed transportation. These portals and the stone
items that trigger them make it much easier for the party to move and 
explore. There are 16 different portals, each one requiring a special 
enchanted stone item as a key. There are 7 different stone items
in EYE OF THE BEHOLDER: holy symbol, necklace, orb, dagger medallion, 
scepter and ring.<BR><BR>
