X-OUT:

        On the equipment screen select the white bug ship and put it on the
        grid area.  Then choose the orange laser and drag it to the face of
        the shop keeper.  Keep clicking the LEFT MOUSE BUTTON until you get
        $500,000.

        Insert the disk, and hold both mousebuttons until the title screen
        appears.  When youre in the shop hold down 'HELP' and 'DEL' for a
        few seconds, now choose your ships as normal, but you have infinite
        energy.

        To get more cash at the beginning of the game, select the smallest
        ship (the one at the top), then the weediest laser (the orange one
        with single beam), and place it on the shopkeepers nose.  Hit the
        fire button to get the cash boost!
