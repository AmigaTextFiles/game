OVER THE NET:

        First, choose a one set game, play the sea-cup and enter one team or
        two human players.  When it's your turn to serve, move the
        non-serving player up to the top of the court close to the net.
        This will force one of the computer players to follow him.  Now do a
        jump serve (push up and fire), then hit the ball to the other
        computer player by pushing right then down.  The ball should drop
        between him and the net and he should miss the ball.  Hopefully this
        plan should work.  I don't know if it works with the other teams
        like Coco, Freaks etc but it works with the Rollers and the Golden
        Boys.
