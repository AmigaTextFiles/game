HEROES OF THE LANCE:

        SOME GENERAL TIPS:  

        Arrange your party so that the first line consists of two strong
        warriors, raistlin and goldmoon.  This allows you to use Raistlin's
        magic and the healing staff of goldmoon without too much hassle.
        Save tanis and riverwind for the later levels, where the bows come
        in handy.

        When fighting gully dwarves, use Tasslehoff who is the same height
        as them.  His sling stones will never miss.  Avoid fighting
        hatchlings, they're not worth it.  Just turn and run when you meet
        one; when you reach an intersection move into a new path and wait a
        little.  When you return, the hatchling will have gone.

        KILLING BOZAKS:  TWO METHODS:

        (1) Get raistlin to use a web, sleep or charm spell to stun it,
            then send a warrior to clobber it to death

        (2) Select Flint, who is a dwarf; 9 out of 10 times, the bozak's
            shots will go over his head; get close to enter melee combat,
            and use low thrusts to kill it.

        SPECTRAL MINIONS:  They're easy to kill, so use a warrior.

        WRAITHS:  A well-timed throw of an axe kills them every time.  If
                  you miss, use a sword and chest thrust movements.  Don't
                  let it get too close to you!

        SPIDERS:  Use low thrusts to keep them at bay.  If they get through
                  your guard, retreat until you can turn and fight again.

        The blue and green potions restore health, red slows down monsters,
        and yellow give your characters extra confidence.
