HEIMDALL 2 CD³²:

        When either the hero or the heroine die, go to the Dwarven Isle of
        Utguard.  Visit a shop and have a look at your inventory.  Click on
        the deceased face and you can now sell off their possessions and buy
        them back with the character who's still very much alive.
