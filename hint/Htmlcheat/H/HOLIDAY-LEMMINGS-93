                                    (HINTS)

        1.  If a Builder hits a steepish slope he will stop building and
            turn around.

        2.  On the early levels practice using the lemmings special
            abilities.  Try completing level one without Climbers and level
            two without Floaters.

        3.  On Blizzard level two, you will need to use the Digger/Builder
            method to block off the lemmings.

        4.  On Blizzard level 14 the exit is hidden under snow in the steel
            boxes in the bottom left corner!  Use Miners and Bashers to get
            there.
