HEIMDALL:

        If your character has just been killed and you want to restore your
        weapons, magic and crew members, but forgot to save the game
        beforehand, then read on.  Go to the 'save game' option at the
        beginning of the game (where the attribute options are).  When the
        instruction to insert your saved game disk appears, click on "no"
        and you will return to the items screen with everything you had
        before you were killed.
