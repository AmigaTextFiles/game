WINGS:

        Each letter of the word wings on the main menu does something.  To
        access them hold down 'CTRL', 'L SHIFT', and 'L ALT' while holding
        down the right mouse button.  Keep holding the keys and the right
        mouse button and click on the letters with the left mouse button.

                "W"__________________________________Music on/off.
                "I"_______Turns caps lock into an autofire button.
                "N"____________________________Skip flight school.
                "G"_________________________________________Guess.
                "S"______________Save game without having to exit.

        To access the cheat mode you have to go to flight school.  To get
        an awesome pilot click on the bullseye on the airplane at the top
        of the flight school menu.  The screen will either flash or you
        will get a requestor asking if you want to quit (say no).  Then
        create a new pilot with the name "Orca The Killer Tomato" type as
        it's printed.  Orca doesn't need school.  To access a menu option
        (much of which is no longer useful or active) create a new pilot
        and name him "  Who is The Riddler".  Make sure to put the two
        spaces before the name.  Don't use the 'RETURN' key to enter it,
        hit the 'ESC' key instead.  Now follow the prompts.

        Game Tips:

        BALLOON BUSTING- The first thing to do in Balloon Busting missions
        is to take out the AA gun. It isn't too hard so give it a try.

        DOG FIGHTS- When involved in a dog fight with other planes always
        attack from above. This is because if you attack from below the other
        plane will climb which is very annoying. By attacking from above you
        drive the other plane down rather than up.
     
        BEING TAILED- When you are being tailed hold the joystick to the
        bottom-right. You should turn off to the right and out of the other
        planes line of fire.

        If you run from a hard disk you can hit LEFT-AMIGA ESCape to toggle
        to the Workbench screen and back.
