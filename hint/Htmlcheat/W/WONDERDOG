WONDERDOG:

        When you find a hidden bonus room during play use the cursor keys
        to move around (up and down are reversed).  If you scroll the screen
        all the way to the right and let wonderdog go off the right side, he
        will appear back in the main game, but will start walking to the
        right and the level will end.
