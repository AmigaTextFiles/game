WAYNE GRETSKY ICE HOCKEY:

        While you are playing the game and powering up the rink towards the
        oppoment's goal with the puck in your possension, press the '?' key
        to remove your opponent's goalie from his goal area.  He'll reappear
        in a forward position so you'll be out numbered, but it is better to
        have an open goal.
