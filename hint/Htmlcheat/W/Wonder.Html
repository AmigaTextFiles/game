                    <CENTER>SOLUTION</CENTER><BR><BR><BR>


By COBRA of AERO.  Edited by PARASITE.<BR><BR>


This solution gives the full score of 501 points<!<BR><BR>

River Bank:<BR>
I sit with my sister Emily on a bench, and feel quite bored, so I decide
to stand and go to the East, towards the pear groves.<BR><BR>

Pear Groves:<BR>
Here I gather a pear<FONT COLOR = RED> (4/4) </FONT COLOR = RED>, as I walk around for a while, a rabbit with
pink eyes comes running by.  Then the pears starts to glow and turnes
into small lanterns.  I follow the footsteps of the rabbit and comes to a
hole, that the rabbit has gone through.<BR><BR>

Field/Rabbit's Hole:<BR>
I crawl into the hole, and go South, where I fall in a deep well, during
the fall I see a jar glass which I take with me.<BR><BR>

Passage:<BR>
Soon after I land on a pile of leaves in a East-West passage. Here I see
a door with the letter "C".  The door is closed.  I get of the leaves and
search them, here I find a key,the key is marked with the word : Locker,
and the number 10.<BR><BR>

Long Hall:<BR>
While searching the table I find a glass box, which contains a piece of
cake.  On the cover of the glass box I read the words "Eat me",above the
letters is a picture of a girl as big as a tree.  The bottle, says "Drink
me", and shows a very small girl.  The bottle seems to contain a magic
drink, I bring both things, and continue.<BR><BR>

Music Room:<BR>
Here the chairs are dancing to the music comming from what seems to be an
automatic grand piano.  I open the grand piano and finds a key "C" and a
key "G" (Music keys NOT regulary keys !) .  The "G" key however I can't
reach.  So I wait until a chair is near the grand piano, then I take the
music sheet, which makes the music stop playing, and the chairs stop
dancing.  Now I stand on the chair, open the bottle with the magic drink,
and drink the stuff.  Right away it makes me smaller!  Then I climb into
the grand piano and get the "G" key<FONT COLOR = RED> (15/19) </FONT COLOR = RED>.  Now I leave the grand piano
before I regain my normal size.<BR><BR>

Broom Cupboard:<BR>
I use the "G" key to open the door to the broom cupboard, where I find a
"Cardshoe" (To be used for picking up cards) .  Besides that I also take
the coat hanger and the overall.<BR><BR>

Long Halls:<BR>
Here I open the small door with the "G" key, since I'm too big to fit
into the overall I open the fan, and wave the fan<FONT COLOR = RED> (5/24) </FONT COLOR = RED>.  I now have the
size of the overall, which I then wear.  Then a rabbit arrives to the
scene, the rabbit thinks I'm Mary-Anne, and tells me to go to it's house
and get a pair of pink gloves and a fan, it also tells me that it will
wait for me at the Palace gates.  Then before it leaves it throws me a
key<FONT COLOR = RED> (3/27) </FONT COLOR = RED>.<BR><BR>

Enter Wonderland.<BR><BR>

By The Palace Gates:<BR>
Here I recieve a welcome by the Jack of hearts, which tells me to get the
treacle cake (A kind of syrup cake) the pantry of the Queen of
hearts.  He also give me the promise to fullfill my dreams and leave
Wonderland.  On a stick I see an insect, I take it, it disappears, and I
get the stick.  Then I go to the rabbit's house.<BR><BR>

Front Garden/Rabbit's House:<BR>
The brass sign on the door says :"W.RABBIT", I take the clothes peg from
the washing line, then I loosen the washing line from the tree.  I open
the door with the key I got from the rabbit.<BR><BR>

Kitchen:<BR>
Here I take the breakfast egg, and the cups from the cabinet.<BR><BR>

Garden Shed:<BR>
I go across the garden, behind the house into the shed where I see a
vice.  I put the clothes hanger in the vice, straighten it and open the
vice<FONT COLOR = RED> (8/35) </FONT COLOR = RED>.  Now I enter the house again and go to the top floor.
 <BR><BR>
Landing: <BR>
Here I open the standing clock,and finds the 6 of diamonds. (This is the
first of ALL 13 diamond playing cards you MUST find during the game).  As
soon as I get the card it disappears into the card shoe<FONT COLOR = RED> (1/36) </FONT COLOR = RED>.  Then I
take the right hand pouch.  The door to the rabbit's bedroom unfotunately
is closed,and there is a key in the keyhole, but, from the other side!
I notice a gap underneath the door so I decide to do the old trick.  I
put sheet of music in gap, and stick the straight coat hanger in the
keyhole, so it will force the key out, and it will fall on the paper!
Now I pull the paper back, and i now own the key to the rabbit's bedroom.
I unlock the bedroom door,<FONT COLOR = RED> (6/42) </FONT COLOR = RED>. <BR><BR>

White Rabbit's Bedroom:<BR>
When I enter the bedroom I see the things I came to get, the pink fan
<FONT COLOR = RED>(4/46)</FONT COLOR = RED>and the pink gloves<FONT COLOR = RED> (4/50) </FONT COLOR = RED>.  I also get the quartz bottle which
contains a magic drink.  I notice a white fluid which I can't bring, but
who knows it might be usefull later on.  Then I leave the rabbit's
bedroom and proceed to the castle to deliever the goods.<BR><BR>

Palace Grounds:  <BR>
Here I find a pair of garden gloves, which I bring with me.  There is a
wooden door in the corner, I examine it, but discover that it is locked,
and the keyhole is missing.<BR><BR>

In Front Of The Palace: <BR>
The well is surrounded by a mist of sparkling water, to get a bit of the
water I hold the cup in the mist<FONT COLOR = RED>(3/53) </FONT COLOR = RED>.  Then I try to get into the
palace, but fail, since I don't have the pass ! The pass is hidden in the
Duchess' house.  On the way to her house I notice a 30 feet tall elm
tree, which will be of importance later on in the game.<BR><BR>

Lounge/Duchess' House:<BR>
I open the door and enters here house, Then I get the red glasses case,
and the card 2 of diamonds, to get the card I must move the "Gazette"
from the table,get the card, and return the "Gazette", then the card will
disappear into the "cardshoe"<FONT COLOR = RED>(2/55) </FONT COLOR = RED>.<BR><BR>

Dining Room: <BR>
Here I spot the pass I'm looking for, it's lying in a glass case, however
the key for the glass case is not among my belongings, so I proceed to
the first floor.<BR><BR>

Duchess' Bedroom:<BR>
I go to the bed and find a pair of slippers,then I take of my shoes and
put on the slippers<FONT COLOR = RED>(1/56) </FONT COLOR = RED>.  Now I can sneak around.<BR><BR>

Cooks Bedroom:<BR>
To get to the kitchen I have to wear the garden gloves,then I go
to the dinner elevator and enters it. Since the smell from the
kitchen makes me sneeze all the time,I put a clothes peg on my
nose<FONT COLOR = RED> (5/61) </FONT COLOR = RED>.Then I pull the rope<FONT COLOR = RED> (2/63) </FONT COLOR = RED>.And go to the West into
the kitchen.<BR><BR>

Kitchen:<BR>
Since the plates are flying around here,I decide it's not a safe
place to be in,so I do what I have to do in a hurry !
I get the carving knife,opens the refrigerator,get the cream with
the help from the jar glass and the jug,and then close the
refrigerator !(Before the door closes and compromisses me).
Now I only have to get the glass key and then go to the dinner
elevator and exit the scene.<BR><BR>

Dining Room: <BR>
Now in possesion of the glass key,I open the glass case,and
get the pass<FONT COLOR = RED> (16/79) </FONT COLOR = RED>.I change my shoes,and take my garden gloves
of.To the South West of the house there is another gardening fork
which I take.Now on the way to the palace I make a halt by the:<BR><BR>

Horse Chestnut Tree:<BR>
When they look at the cream,they tell that it is the favorite
food of the Cheshire cat.I then put the cream in the saucer,and
the cat appears on the scene,it eats the cream and leaves the
scene again.By examining the saucer I now find a piece of sugar
on it.I get the sugar<FONT COLOR = RED> (6/85) </FONT COLOR = RED>.<BR>
I also find the left hand pouch,and then I move on to the castle.
<BR><BR>
Eastern Hall/Palace:<BR>
I give the pass to the guard,and then the rabbit appears,I give
the fan and the oink gloves to the rabbit<FONT COLOR = RED> (6/91) </FONT COLOR = RED> </FONT COLOR = RED>as a thank you I
recieve a paint brush from the rabbit.
<BR><BR>
Central Hall:<BR>
Here I search coat of arms,and discovers 2 heart cards which is
playing croquet with bat and ball.
I get the coat hook from where the coat of arms is hanging,and I
notice a jury roster in which my playing cards is listed in a
certain order.(The order in which I've got them ! This is *very*
important towards the end of the game).
Then I take a brief look at the Throne room,but enter it I
can not. <BR><BR>

Conservatory: <BR>
The only thing I can get here is the handle,I have to use it on
the clock,so I turn the handle clockwise<FONT COLOR = RED> (6/97) </FONT COLOR = RED>.
<BR><BR>
Palace Kitchen:<BR>
On the way to the kitchen I notice a crystal chest in the banquet
room,inside the crystal chest I see a invitation.Since the chest
is locked,I need to find the key ! in the kitchen I got to the
Royal chef which flutters around with a piece of paper.
I ask him about the paper and he tells me that he must prepare a
treacle cake for the majestys banquet.
Allthough he is missing the ingredients,which is listed on the
paper : Sparkling water,Sugar,Flour,Lard,Treacle and Breadcrumbs.
Since I allready have the sugar I give it to him.<FONT COLOR = RED>(5/102) </FONT COLOR = RED>.
Before leaving I take the steak with me.
<BR><BR>
Steps: <BR>
Now I go down the basement stairs,and unlock the basement door
with the key hanging there.Since there is something blocking the
door from the other side I can't enter,so I proceed to the:
 <BR><BR>
Guards Quarter's:<BR>
Here I see 13 lockers,since I have the key to number 10 locker,I
open the number 10 locker and find a key to the number 3 locker.
I open the number 3 locker and find 7 of diamonds<FONT COLOR = RED> (3/105) </FONT COLOR = RED>,and
the key for the number 7 locker,in the number 7 locker I find a
pair of boots which I take with me.(Note,don't pass the guards
at the entrance carrying the boots !) </FONT COLOR = RED>.So now it's time I search
the upper floor of the castle.
<BR><BR>
Queens Bedroom:<BR>
In the queens bedroom I find another card,the queen of diamonds
<FONT COLOR = RED>(4/109) </FONT COLOR = RED>,and in the queenside drawer I find a wooden key.
          <BR><BR>
Bathroom:<BR>
In the mirror cupboard I get a big lens and a bottle of nail
varnish remover.Then I proceed further up.
         <BR><BR>
Royal Observatory:<BR>
Here I find the fifth card the 4 of diamonds<FONT COLOR = RED> (5/114) </FONT COLOR = RED>.I open
the glasses-case where I find a small lens,Which I put here
together with the big lens,since I'm not tall enough to look
through the telescope.
Now I leave the castle,before I do it I however leave the boots
in the Eastern Hall,then I go to the:
           <BR><BR>
Walled Garden: <BR>
To get to the walled garden I first go to the tree house,open the
door,go to the West out on the limb.where I tie washing line to
limb,and then climbs down.
Now before I can go on I drop washing line.
In the garden I notice a hedgehog,which I at the moment leave
alone. <BR>
The wooden trapdoor has a small hole close to the edge,in which I
put the coat-hook,now I pull hook and the trapdoor opens<FONT COLOR = RED>(10/124) </FONT COLOR = RED>.
Through a secret passage I now enter the cellar of the palace.
   <BR><BR>
Cellar: <BR>
On the table I spot a green bottle containing the long searched
for sparkling water (Don't open the bottle,or else the fizz will
all be gone !) .Now I also see why the basement door was
blocked,there is a wedge,which I remove,then I open the door
<FONT COLOR = RED>(11/135) </FONT COLOR = RED> and go up the stairs to the palace.
        <BR><BR>
Palace: <BR>
In the kitchen I give the chef the green bottle<FONT COLOR = RED> (10/145) </FONT COLOR = RED>.Then
I go through the secret passage and back into the garden.
There I get the washing line,climb up and drop the washing
line,from then I go to :
         <BR><BR>
The Giant Mushroom:<BR>
The caterpillar which is blocking the way I give sherbet to
caterpillar<FONT COLOR = RED> (5/150) </FONT COLOR = RED>.
Now notice that the mushroom has a left and a right side,now
be *careful* .
Cut left side with carving knife,put chunk into left hand pouch
I do that 3 times,so I now have 3 slices from the left side in
the left hand pouch.
I do the same thing on the right side,but offcourse put the
slices in the right hand pouch.It is of outmost importance
to separate the right and left chunks,they may look alike but
their effect is very different,indeed !<BR><BR>

Path/Walled Garden: <BR>
I go the path North West of the walnut tree,by using the carving
knife against the wall,I can loosen a brick.
So I get brick with knife.(It's important that you slice the
mushroom before you use the knife on the wall since uding the
knife on the wall makes it blunt !) </FONT COLOR = RED>.
In the hole in the wall I see the next card,however when I reach
for it,it will fall into the garden,so I walk back to the garden
(The allready described route) </FONT COLOR = RED> </FONT COLOR = RED>and pick up the card the 6 of
diamonds<FONT COLOR = RED> (6/156) </FONT COLOR = RED>.<BR><BR>

By The River: <BR>
Here I find a dog,Who is waiting for me to play with him,so I
throw the stick,which the dog will bring back from the water.
I notice something shining in the dog's mouth,it's a silver
key'To get the key you must give the dog the steak<FONT COLOR = RED> (7/163) </FONT COLOR = RED>.
 <BR><BR>
Back Garden/Rabbit's House:<BR>

Wiggly Waggly path (Treacle Well):<BR>
Now I go to the treacle well,where I tie rope to jug and drop
jug,then I tie winch to handle,and.turn handle clockwise,the jug
now at the bottom of the well being filled with treacle.
Then I,turn the handle anticlockwise (Also known as counter
clockwise) So now here the jug comes,and I get the jug and
releases it from the rope<FONT COLOR = RED> (9/179) </FONT COLOR = RED>.Then I leave for the river
where the beavers at.<BR><BR>

napkin,in the hat room I find a canvas sack.<BR>
After I get the mentioned things I go to the:<BR><BR>

Mad Tea Party:  <BR>
In the teapot there is a clormouse,which is sitting on a card !
so to get there I have to become smaller. I eat a bit of the
mushroom from the right hand pouch and then I,get on teapot,to
get in,I eat another piece of the mushroom from the right hand
pouch,then,enter pot<FONT COLOR = RED> (6/185) </FONT COLOR = RED>.  <BR>
I notice the mouse is asleep,so in order to wake him up I say
something,which could be :Hello !.Now the mouse moves and I get
the card,the 10 of diamonds<FONT COLOR = RED> (8/193) </FONT COLOR = RED>.Then I climb out of the tea
pot,get off the teapot,to get off from the table down to the
floor I eat a piece of mushroom fromt the left hand pouch.
When allready down I leave and go to the mad hatter's house.
  <BR><BR>
Under The Footbridge:<BR>

napkin with the brreadcrumbs<FONT COLOR = RED> (20/237) </FONT COLOR = RED> </FONT COLOR = RED>and finally the lard
<FONT COLOR = RED>(25/262) </FONT COLOR = RED>.<BR><BR>

Royal Observatory:<BR>
By using the tea chest I'm now tall enough to reach to the
telescope,I put the tea chest down and stand on ttea
chest,and,put the large lens into the large end and the small
into the small end<FONT COLOR = RED> (7/269) </FONT COLOR = RED>Now I can look through the telescope
<FONT COLOR = RED>(12/281) </FONT COLOR = RED>To get a better view I have to close the left eye
however. I then turn the telescope towards the South East
untill I see thre tree house,where I see a card hanging on a

Before I leave the Palace I go to the Eastern Hall to get my
boots,then I leave through the cellar.<BR><BR>

         <BR><BR>

end up in the Long Hall where I was in the beginnig of the game.
Here I eat a piece of mushroom from the right hand pouch,and I
can now pass through the small door to the West.
       <BR><BR>
Passage:<BR>
Here I see the three spades (Cards) working as gardeners,they are
busy painting the white roses red,I eat a piece of mushroom from
the left hand pouch and I help the gardeners (Since I got the

Rock Ledge:<BR>
Now I have to listen to a long conversation between the griffin
and the turtle (You have to listen for as long as they talk,it
is *important* ) .The two are talking about playing cards,and I will
get a usefull information for the end of the game here.
During the trial of the dormouse a lower value playing card has
defended it self,sucessfully against a higher value playing
card,it was the 6 of diamonds against the ace of diamonds.
The reson for this is,that the 6 of diamonds were in the court
prior to the ace , and therefor had more value.
         <BR><BR>
Duck Pond:<BR>
When I am at the duckpond I change my shoes and wear the
boots,then i enter the pond<FONT COLOR = RED> (12/324) </FONT COLOR = RED>.Then I get the elleventh
card which is the 5 of diamonds<FONT COLOR = RED> (11/335) </FONT COLOR = RED>.North of the duck
pond,in the hedge I spot the door which I can open with the
wooden key I've got in the queens bedroom.
Before I go to the palace I take off my boots and wear my shoes,
remember to go around the duck pond when comming back due to the
boots which you now leave here.
                        <BR><BR>

With the crystal key I open the crystal chest and get the
invitation to the royal croquet game<FONT COLOR = RED> (3/385) </FONT COLOR = RED>.
To play croquet I need a ball and a bat,the ball I allready have

To get the bat I have to go back to the rabbit's house,once
again.    <BR><BR>

White Rabbit's Bedroom:<BR>
Since I allready have a clean paint brush I put the paint brush
in the white liquid and paints the breakfast egg white<FONT COLOR = RED> (7/392) </FONT COLOR = RED>
then I go to:<BR><BR>

Giant Elm Tree: <BR>
On the quartz bottle there is a picture of a man with a extreme
lon neck,so I open the bottle and drink the magic liquid
then I put the fresh painted egg in the mouth and wait until my
neck is so long that my head is in the tree crown.
Then I,drop breakfast egg into nest,and waits,untill my neck is
back to normal size,then I wait until my score is<FONT COLOR = RED> (19/411) </FONT COLOR = RED>.
Meanwhile the egg is hatched by the pigeon.
I open the glass box and eats the cake,I grow and take the
flamingo from the nest<FONT COLOR = RED> (8/419) </FONT COLOR = RED>then I wait until I'm back to
normal size again,and now I have a bat (The flamingo) for the
croquet game. <BR><BR>

South Of Duck Ponds:<BR>
I show the guard my invitation and waits until the guests are

Croquet Green/Under The Bramble Hetch: <BR>
After Ive been listening to the rules,I open the canvas sack and
get the hedgehog out,put it down and hit the hedgehog with the

it and once again hit the hedgehog with the flamingo.
This time the hedgehog roles into a hole,in which I find the last
card the Ace of diamonds<FONT COLOR = RED> (15/434) </FONT COLOR = RED> </FONT COLOR = RED>I get the card<FONT COLOR = RED> (13/447) </FONT COLOR = RED> </FONT COLOR = RED>and
leaves the ground as fast as possible.<BR><BR>

Tailors Cottage: <BR>
Now that I'm in possesion of "Suit of Diamods" (Meaning a

the key to the pantry,my playing cards have now turned into a
beuatiful suit which I give to the tailor<FONT COLOR = RED> (16/463) </FONT COLOR = RED> </FONT COLOR = RED>The tailor now
leaves the house and now I can get the key from the chefs
overall,<FONT COLOR = RED>(5/468) </FONT COLOR = RED>and head for the Palace.  <BR><BR>

Since Im now up to stael the treacle cake I then lock the door to
the guards room with the red key,and thereby prevents them of
capturing me<FONT COLOR = RED> (4/472) </FONT COLOR = RED>. <BR><BR>

Palace Kitchens/Pantry: <BR>
I unlock the door to the pantry,enter the pantry,and take the
cake<FONT COLOR = RED> (8/480) </FONT COLOR = RED> </FONT COLOR = RED>Then I wait for the Jack of hearts to arrive,he
congratulates me and pushes me into the courtroom !!!!!!!!!!
They acuse me for stealing the cake,and the list of jury members
is being presented,it is the cards of diamonds,in the order in
which I collected them (You must write down the order in which
they are being presented in) .The long text is without importance.
The trial goes like this: One of the diamond cards charges me of
a certain thing,I then have to choose a card that overrules this
charge,if overruled both cards are out of the trial.
Remember the conversation between the griffin and the turtle !
You always have to choose the card you picked up before the one
card that is now charging you !<BR><BR>

Here is an example:<BR>
This is how I picked up the cards: 6-2-7-Queen-4-9-8-10-Jack-3-5-King-
Ace.  <BR>
The first charge is brought up by the 7,so you have to select the
2 for defending you "Choose 2 of diamonds"<FONT COLOR = RED> (1/481) </FONT COLOR = RED> </FONT COLOR = RED><BR>
The next charge is brought up by the 5 "Choose the 3 of diamonds"
<FONT COLOR = RED>(2/483) </FONT COLOR = RED>. <BR>
Now the Jack is charging you "choose the 10 of diamonds"<FONT COLOR = RED> (3/486) </FONT COLOR = RED>.<BR>
Now the 9 is charging you "choose the 4 of diamonds"<FONT COLOR = RED> (4/490) </FONT COLOR = RED>.<BR>
Now the King is charging you "Choose the 8 of diamonds"<FONT COLOR = RED> (5/495) </FONT COLOR = RED>.<BR>
The last charge comes from the Ace "Choose the Queen of diamonds"<BR>
Now there is only 6 cards left and the trial can not continue,so
the case is dismissed and I go back to my sister Emily<FONT COLOR = RED> (6/501) </FONT COLOR = RED>.<BR>
                                     <BR>
