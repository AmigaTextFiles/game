WWF WRESTLEMANIA:

        Get your man outside the ring and pick up the steel chair to beat up
        any harder Fighters that you are having trouble with.  This should
        help you to get further.  When you are about to go into a joystick
        waggling battle, follow these steps:

            (A) Pause the game.

            (B) Plug the mouse into the joystick port you are using.

            (C) Unpause the game, and move the mouse rapidly from side to
                side.  This will enable you to waggle quicker than your
                opponent.
            (D) When your character has won the move, pause the game and
                plug the joystick back in.

        Place the chair outside the ring (next to the bottom left turn
        buckle) just up a bit. Now jump into the ring and you should have
        the chair.  Climb up on to a corner post, and instead of jumping
        into the ring, jump the other way.  Weird gravity!

        During a two player practice game, get 1 player to climb onto the
        top of the top left turnbuckle, then get player two to be as close
        as possible to him.  Player two should drop and kick the player,
        then he will turn into a "ghost". He can pick up the chair and
        take it into the ring.  Press escape then compete for the title,
        and the chair will still be there.

        During a tough bout, pause game, type in
        HULKHOGANWEARSTIGHTYELLOWKNICKERS and then unpause game.
        The fight will finish almost immediately with you the victor.
