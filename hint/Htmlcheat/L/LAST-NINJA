LAST NINJA:

        To get past the dragon at the end of level one, you must stand at
        the far left side of the path just at the beginning of the dragons
        rocky lair.  Throw a smoke bomb and if you are on target the dragon
        will fall asleep.  You can now walk past without getting killed.
