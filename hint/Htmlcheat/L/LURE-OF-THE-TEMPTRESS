LURE OF THE TEMPTRESS:

When you've been given the flask from nellie, drink it and then go and see
the blacksmith. Give the flask to Luthern and he'll empty it for you. Now go
to the market place and give the lock pick to Ratpouch and Save the game.
Look at the door, you'll see a lock, tell Ratpouch to use his lockpick on
it. Look at apparatus, use the oil burner with the thunderbox and the flask
on the tap (On the far right.) Go to middle street and drink the flask,
enter the door and talk to skoris and you'll set the girl free.
