LASER SQUAD:

        In laser squad, for fun do the assassins on level 1.  Buy no armour,
        give the corporal an M4000 with two reloads, the next two rocket
        launchers with four rockets each, and the last two nothing at all.
        Deploy in the entrance, in the gap in the outer wall , and take the
        house to pieces with the rockets, waiting for droids or Regix to
        show up - get them with Jonlan's M4000. I managed to do the scenario
        with one shot - it went between the leaves of the door, blew up
        against a wall and Regix was on the other side. end of story, fade
        to black.
