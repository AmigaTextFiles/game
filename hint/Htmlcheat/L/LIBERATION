LIBERATION:
    
        To duplicate any item as many times as you want do the following:
        
        First find a power point and stand in front of it.  Then select any
        item from a droid's backpack and drop it on to the floor so that the
        name of it appears in the text window.  Now pick up the same object
        and return it to the droid's backpack and engage the poser point so
        the lightning bolts are touching you.  Use the look right, look left
        command to move the view screen so that it is at an angle.  Move the
        cursor to the bottom of the screen and hold down the right mouse
        button so that the cursor becomes a hand and left click, at which
        point an object should appear on the floor and you can drop as many
        objects as you wish.  Look back to the normal view and when the
        power bolts stop you can pick up the objects that you dropped.
