    <BR><BR>
Go South and you should find yourself in some wilderness, you'll walk about
lost in it for a bit... when you get close enough, "get flower" from the
middle of the screen. Dont worry if you miss it, you'll get more chances.
<Font Color=Red>185/500</Font Color=Red>
    <BR><BR>
When the sequence finally ends you'll be in a posh resteraunt. Walk over to
the man and "Talk man". He will tell you to sit and wait, so walk over to
the chair and "sit" <Font Color=Red>186/500</Font Color=Red>.
     <BR><BR>
Once the Maitre'd has finished seating the other guests you will be shown
your table and given some food. !!!Do not eat the food!!! Walk over to the
buffet and "Examine buffet" then walk over to the cheese and "Take Knife"
<Font Color=Red>190/500</Font Color=Red>.
<BR><BR>
Now leave the resteraunt and you will find yourself back in the wilderness,
now's the time to get that flower if you missed it.
<BR><BR>
When you've found your way you'll be in a guestroom. "look" to get your
bearings and then walk over to the nightstand and "take matches" now walk
into the bathroom and "take soap" from by the sink. <Font Color=Red>194/500</Font Color=Red>
<BR><BR>
Leave the Guestroom and after a while you'll find yourself in the Barbers.

leave the shop, bak into the wilderness where you'll find yourself back on
the beach.
<BR><BR>
Go west "look", walk to the far West of the screen and "Get bikini". Now go
East and South back into the wilderness <Font Color=Red>201/500</Font Color=Red>.

<BR><BR>
Once on the beach, walk East and East again.
<BR><BR>
In the next bit you'll have to edge yourway along a cliff face, but dont
worry, you cant fall off even if you try. (Try and fall off really far
towards the end to see how far his legs stretch :)
<BR><BR>
As you corner the last cliff face type "Wear suit".
<BR><BR>
You'll now find yourself at the airport <Font Color=Red>239/500</Font Color=Red>.
<BR><BR>
Walk up to the two dancing men and "give man flower" (be careful not to get
too close) O.k, now walk into the airport where you will see some never
ending qeue's, where the qeue you are in will never get shorter, what fun!
<BR><BR>
Ignore the qeue's and walk off to the West where you will find another
Barber shop. Walk in and up to the lady, "look lady", walk to the chair and
"sit".
<BR><BR>
When finished, leave the barber shop.
<BR><BR>
If you want to see one of the amusing deaths now (I suggest you save first)
sit next to the lady on the chair and then follow her when she leave's.
<BR><BR>
Assuming that you didn't do this or have loaded your saved game from outside
the barber shop, go East and East again.
<BR><BR>
Walk over to the man and "talk man", he'll ask you for your passport, "Give
man passport". After looking through your possesions he'll let you through
the gate to the East which will open when you walk up to it. Walk through it
and you'll find yourself in the X-ray room.
<BR><BR>
Now stand next to the conveyor belt and wait for a bag with a bomb in it to
come by, when the bag comes to you, "get bag". You might also like to get
other bag's and see what's in them for fun. If you dont think you'll be able
to spot the bag then just get every bag that passes you by.<Font Color=Red>277/500</Font Color=Red>
<BR><BR>
Once the automatic sequence is finished, the qeue's will have cleared. Walk
up to the lady and "buy ticket".
<BR><BR>
When the lady has finished, go East and show man passport. Go East and East
again. Walk up to the snack bar and "Buy food" when you are brought the food
"look in food" !!!Dont eat it!!! You'll now find a pin in the gravy, "take
pin". Now walk over to the vending machines to the East and "Put money in
machine" you'll now get a parachute. Quickly walk up the conveyor belt and
after a bit you'll find yourself in the waiting room. <Font Color=Red>292/500</Font Color=Red>
Walk over to the counter and "get pamphlet" then "give man ticket". Walk on
to the plane and you'll end up in your seat.<Font Color=Red>306/500</Font Color=Red>
<BR><BR>
After takeoff "Get bag", "Give man pamphlet", "stand", walk East to the back
of the plane. Find the emergency door, "Pick lock", "Move handle", "wear
parachute", "open door". You will now be sucked out. Quickly "open
parachute" and you should land on an island.<Font Color=Red>334/500</Font Color=Red>
<BR><BR>
You'll now find yourself hanging from a tree in the parachute, "cut rope" to
free yourself
<BR><BR>
Now walk over to the stick (North and East a bit) and "Get stick".<Font Color=Red>346/500</Font Color=Red>
<BR><BR>
The next bit is dangerous, in fact, this whole island is, so be very careful
and save lots.
<BR><BR>
There is a hive of killer bees on the small tree
to the south. Walk over to it and "crawl" then exit South. (or dont and see
what happens)
(By the way, did you notice anything about that rock you just passed?) 
<BR><BR>
In the next bit there is a snake in the tree so walk up to the branch and
just as it is about to attack you "Use stick" (or don't and see what
happens) When you have done this walk off the screen to the South East.
<BR><BR>
The next screen is a swamp. Follow the dry path on the swamp (the path
actually looks more like a reflection than a path) or jump into the swamp
and see what happens. (This bit is best done with the mouse)
<BR><BR>
This next screen is really fun, save the game and then try walking through
the river. However, if you don't want to die then the way to do it is to
swing from the vines. Walk over to the far right and next to the water of
the bank you are on and type grab vine. You will swing across, then, quickly
type it again (Or press F3) to grab the next one, do this until you reach
the edge. Now walk up to the tree and "get vine" <Font Color=Red>377/500</Font Color=Red>. Now exit the
screen to the East.
<BR><BR>
*Game goes into automatic mode
<BR><BR>
When the sequence is finished you'll be standing next to a chasm with a tree
on the other side. Go South, then East, walk over to the burnt out fire and
"get ashes" now go back to the chasm and stand right next to the edge, now
"throw vine" you'll get to the other side.
<BR><BR>
Now go North until you reach the edge of the volcano, covered in
ice. Stand next to the edge where the ice slopes up and "use
ashes" Once past the ice, walk up to the very top of the volcano <Font Color=Red>436/500</Font Color=Red>
<BR><BR>
Ok, now stand very close to the hole in the volcano (not too close though or
you'll fall in) "Put bag in bottle" "light bag" "drop bottle".
<BR><BR>
The elevator door will now open, so walk in <Font Color=Red>459/500</Font Color=Red>.
<BR><BR>
*Game goes into automatic mode
<BR><BR>
End of the game with <Font Color=Red>489/500</Font Color=Red> points, where are the other 11??? If anyone
find's out, I'd love to know. - The maid in the guest room maybe?
