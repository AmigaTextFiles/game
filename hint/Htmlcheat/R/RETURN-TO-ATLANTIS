RETURN TO ATLANTIS:

        If you fail a mission (ie. the mission is terminated and you have
        not recieved a "reward" screen) DO NOT return to base or you will
        lose all the health points spent on the current assignment.
        Re-boot your computer and play the assignment again, so you will
        be able to keep those precious experience points each time you
        re-play the assignment.
