ROLLING RONNY:

        On the high score table, enter "CHEAT" for your name, this should
        give you the power of flight.  Press 'C' during play to fly.  Press
        'F9' for more money.  If this doesn't work try typing "TRACTOR" for
        you name on the high score table.

        Try both of these: Entering your name as "RONNY" on the high score
        list or typing in "MICHAEL" when you die at the end of the game will
        give you the ability to fly.  If this doesn't work, try pressing
        'F9' to get all your energy back.
