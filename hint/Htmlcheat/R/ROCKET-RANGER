ROCKET RANGER:

        Rescue the professor as this slows down the nazis, they can't use
        him to increase their efficiency.  You will waste valuable time
        unless you rescue him from the zeppelin while he is over the
        atlantic shooting the gunner in the gondola is tricky, the best
        method being shoot below the gunner and move left and right until
        you are on target.  Gradually move up until you hit the gondola.
        When you hit it there is a flash, stop firing and after a few
        seconds you'll be inside the gondola.

        Find the supply of lunarium before the fort knox supply runs out,
        so infiltrate the nazi base which recieves lunarium from the moon.
        It is in south america or africa, once infiltrated, your agent
        there will cary on sending you lunarium throughout the game.  You
        will have to storm the nazi base first.
