RALLY CROSS CHALLENGE:

        On the fifth track, drive around until you reach the wooden level
        crossing.  Turn the car 90 degrees and drive down the track at full
        speed, until you reach the end.  The race will end giving you 28
        race points.  When the game starts, follow the railroad tracks and
        the screen will go blank.  Now you will find yourself with 24
        tokens.
