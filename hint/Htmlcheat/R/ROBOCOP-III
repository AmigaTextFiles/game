ROBOCOP III:

        Hold down the 'SHIFT' key (either one) and type "THE DIDY MEN".
        Press 'ESC' to skip levels. (It could be "THE DITY MEN"

        During the {jet-pack round} push the RIGHT SHIFT key and type
        "MY FRIEND BILL" to activate the cheat mode. (If you do it right,
        you will get to see a limmerick.)
