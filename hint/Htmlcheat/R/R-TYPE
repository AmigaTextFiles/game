R-TYPE:

        On the high score table, enter "SUMITA." for infinite lives.

        Load the game, when you get the "insert disk 2 and press space"
        prompt, press HELP and type "ME", then press the up arrow (between
        INSERT and CLR HOME). Now insert disk 2 and press space.  While
        playing the game, you can become impervious to collisions (F5),
        impervious to enemy fire (F6), get infinite credits (F7), and put
        the orb in the control of a second player with a stick plugged in
        the mouse port (F8).
