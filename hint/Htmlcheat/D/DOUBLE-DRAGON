        On the title screen, type "R U CALLING ME A PINT A POOF?" This may
        also be "R U CALLING MY PINT A POFF!".
        You should be able to kill any opponent with the 'DEL' key, or try
        typing any of the following on the title screen:

            "LEVEL ONE PLEASE"__________________Go to level one.
            "LEVEL TWO PLEASE"__________________Go to level two.
            "LEVEL THREE PLEASE"______________Go to level three.
            "LEVEL FOUR PLEASE"________________Go to level four.
            "LAST LEVEL PLEASE"________________Go to last level.
            "GIVE ME MORE HEALTH PLEASE"_________Lots of energy.
            "I DO NOT WANT TO DIE PLEASE"__________Invicibility.

        On the high score table, type "NEIL HARDING" as your name for
        something funny.

        Play two player game and get both players killed until you have one
        credit left and the "continue" message is displayed on both sides
        of the screen.  Press both fire buttons simultaneously and you will
        get infinite lives.

        To avoid fighting the first black muscle-man make sure to kill all
        of the bad guys up to the girl.  When you kill her, take the whip,
        go up the ladder and keep walking.  When he breaks out of the wall
        he should disappear.
