DEFENDER OF THE CROWN:

        While the game is loading hold down the 'K' key until the game is
        loaded.  You should now start the game with 2048 knight.

        If you begin the game at the lowest castle, move all your men in
        your army and take the 3 high vassal/income territories below. This
        will give you a lot of men in your army. Move back to your castle
        and you will also be able to buy lots of men.

        When sword fighting move forward, backward, strike, and repeat, you
        should beat your opponents with no problems.

        Move your lance until it is just left of your opponents shield, then
        down a little. Count the number of bounces and on the 5th strike at
        the lowest possible point.
