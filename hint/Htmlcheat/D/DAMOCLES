DAMOCLES:

        On Midas reference 577-341 you can find a pyramid which contains a
        magic crystal.  To use it, you'll need the book from the trader at
        Eris capital city (13-5).  Reading the book while in possession of
        the crystal will allow one wish to be granted.  Try some of the
        following wishes:

                I WISH I HAD A CHEESE SANDWICH
                I WISH I HAD MORE TIME
                I WISH I COULD RECIEVE 1,000,000 CREDITS
                I WISH THE UNIVERSE WAS MORE COLOURFUL
                I WISH I KNOW HOW TO USE AUTHOR'S COMPUTER
