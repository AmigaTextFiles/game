        When you get to the stage where you have no cash left and there is
        no spice to be collected, send your harvester to the enemy camp.
        It will be destroyed, another one will replace it and you'll
        receive seven credits.  You can repeat this as many times as you
        like.<BR><BR>

        To harvest spice in no time at all click on a harvester who is 
        harvesting spice and keep clicking on him.  The percentage of spice
        harvested goes up for each click on the harvestor.  This save both
        time and money. - (I don't this this is quite true, rabies)
