DRAGON'S LAIR:

        Hold down 'ESC', 'R', '/', 'L', 'N', and '7'. (All at the same time)
        Now press the fire button to watch the demo of the entire game.

        Another one is to hold down 'ESC', 'RIGHT' and 'LEFT' cursor keys,
        'N' and '7', then press fire.

        You may need to do this just after the credits when the red light is
        on but no loading is occuring.

        If you did this right the screen should flash
