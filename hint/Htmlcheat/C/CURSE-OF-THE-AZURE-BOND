CURSE OF THE AZURE BOND:

      Once you find any item you  can make as many copies of it as you want.


        1. Create a dummy character.

        2. Load a saved game and transfer all the good items to the dummy.

        3. Remove the dummy character from the party.

        4. Load the dummy character back in.

        5. Transfer the items to other members.

        6. Drop the dummy character from the party.

        7. Repeat steps 4-6 as many times as needed.

        This also works for Curse of the Azure Bonds and Champions of Krynn.

        In case anyone was wondering, The `Wizard in Red' refers to
        Dracandros.  He is the owner of the Crescent Moon bond.  The
        `Woman in Green' refers to the leader of the Cultists of Moander.
        They, of course, are the owners of the Mouth in the Hand bond,
        which is the symbol of the God Moander.  The `Lord of the Black'
        refers to the leader of the Zhentrim, or `Black Network', an evil
        alliance of priests, mages and thieves that operate out of Zhentil
        Keep.  They own the big `Z' in the Triangle bond.  Lastly, `The
        Flamed One' is, of course, good old Tyranthraxus.  He owns the
        Flaming Bond, which is the Symbol of Tyranthraxus.

        To defeat Tyranthraxus, you must gather the Amulet of Lathander,
        which is in Zhentil Keep, the Helm of Dragons, which is currently
        being kept by Dracandros in his castle near Haptooth, and the
        Gauntlet of Moander, which is kept by Mogion (the Woman in Green!)
        in Yulash.  You must take these items to the Pool of Radiance.
