CHASE HQ:

        As soon as the title screen disappears start tapping the SPACEBAR
        at high speed and continue until loading has finished and the game
        begins. Your car will now have a top speed of over 1,000 km/h

        Start the game, then hold the left mouse button, fire button, and
        type "GROWLER".  Press 'T' for more time.

        Before each new level finishes talking hit space and use a free
        nitro. X & Z make steering easier.
