                     <CENTER>      TIPS  </CENTER><BR><BR>

SUPPLIES OF AMMUNITION COME IN TWO FORMS : 20 SHOTS EITHER FOR CANNON OR
MACHINE GUN SO DON`T GO OUT OF YOUR WAY TO COLLECT EXTRA BULLETS UNLESS
AMMO LEVELS ARE LOW.<BR>
TRANSPORTATION TILES MAKE MACHINE GUN SOLDIERS APPEAR FREQUENTLY.`HUG'
THE WALLS AS OFTEN AS POSSIBLE.ALSO DO NOT MOVE OFF THE END OF A WALL
WHILE SOMEBOBY IS FIRING AT YOU,OR YOU WILL BE SHOT.ELECTRIC DOORS ARE
OPERATED FROM A DISTANCE-WATCH FOR MEN ON THE OTHER SIDE.
ON LATER LEVELS (8+),MEN WILL APPEAR FROM NOWHERE (TELEPORTATION
DEVICES POSSIBLY)-BE ON YOUR GUARD! CANNON IS MORE AFFECTIVE THAN GUN AS
IT PASSES THROUGH MEN,DEAD USEFUL FOR RACKING UP THE BONUSES CAUSED BY
MULTIPLE GUARDS STANDING BEHIND EACH OTHER WHEN A CANNON FIRES.USE
DIAGONAL MOVEMENT TO MOVE THAT BIT FASTER TOWARDS CARS,BARRIERS,BUILDINGS
(OR ANYTHING ELSE THAT PROVIDES COVER FROM ENEMY FIRE)<BR><BR><BR><BR>


                       <CENTER>      LEVELS  </CENTER><BR><BR>

   LEVEL 1 (3 BOMBS TO PLANT)<BR>
   NICE AND EASY LEVEL TO START WITH.JUST WATCH FOR THE MEN STANDING GUARD.
   GO ALONG THE TOP TO AVOID THE LOWER GENERATORS WHERE THE ENEMY TENDS TO
   HANG OUT.<BR><BR>

   LEVEL 2 (3 BOMBS TO PLANT)<BR>
   AGAIN VERY SIMPLE LOOK OUT FOR MEN APPEARING FROM INSIDE CARS AS THERE
   ARE QUITE A FEW ALONG THE TOP.TRY TO STAY ALONG THE BOTTOM.SMART BOMB
   THE GROUP OF MEN BY THE EXIT FOR CONVENIENCE AND TO SAVE LIVES (YOURS!).
   <BR><BR>
   LEVEL 3 (3 BOMBS TO PLANT) <BR>
   WATCH THE ACID ! AND ALSO THE MACHINE GUN GUARDS NEAR THE EXIT.TAKE A
   WIDE BERTH PAST THE FLAME THROWING GUARD,HIS LONG RANGE FIRE ISN`T NICE-
   HUG THE BOTTOM IF YOU CAN AND THEN SNEAK UP THE SIDE TO THE LAST BOMB
   AREA AND EXIT.<BR><BR>

   LEVEL 4 (4 BOMBS TO PLANT)  <BR>
   HERE ARE SOME ELECTRIC DOORS TO PLAY WITH;JUST WATCH FOR MEN ON THE OTHER
   SIDE! ALSO PLENTY OF MEN APPEAR USING THE TILES NEAR THE EXIT.RUN
   DIAGONALLY STRAIGHT UP TO THE EXIT AND PRAY (JUDICIOUS USE OF SMART-
   BOMBS IS RECOMMENDED.)<BR><BR>

   LEVEL 5 (5 BOMBS TO PLANT) <BR>
   FIVE BOMBS TO PLACE SO WASTE NO TIME.LIKE LEVEL 2,WATCH FOR THE MEN IN
   CARS.TO GET OVER THE MOVING FLOOR SIMPLY WALK ALONG THE WALL AS THE FLOOR
   STARTS TO CLOSE.YOU CAN GET PAST THE WRECKING BALLS WITHOUT TOO MUCH
   PROBLEM PROVIDING THAT THE NEARBY GUARDS HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED.
                    <BR><BR>
   LEVEL 6 (5 BOMBS TO PLANT)<BR>
   PLENTY OF GUARDS TO BLAST YOU NOW IN LONG CORRIDOORS (USEFUL TO HAVE A
   CANNON READY FOR THIS LEVEL).HUG THE WALL EDGES WHEN SNEAKING UP ON
   GUARDS AND USE THE BOXES FOR COVER.WATCH FOR CHASMS AND MACHINE GUN GUARDS
   COVERING CROSSES ON THE FAR SIDE.ALSO GROUPS OF GUARDS JUST OVER THE
   BRIDGES. <BR><BR>

   LEVEL 7 (4 BOMBS TO PLANT)  <BR>
   THERE ARE A LOT OF TOUCH SENSITIVE CRACKS IN THIS LEVEL`S FLOOR.YOU CAN
   SEE WHERE THE GROUND IS CRACKED SO BEST AVOID ALTOGETHER: TAKING THE
   LOWER ROUTE IS GENERALLY BEST AS THERE ARE LESS HOLES TO AVOID.ON THIS
   LEVEL KUNG-FU MEN APPEAR TO ATTACK,THEY JUST NEED A TOUCH TO KILL YOU!
   SHOOT THE CONTROLS TO OPEN THE BRIDGE.
         <BR><BR>
   LEVEL 8 (6 BOMBS TO PLANT)<BR>
   MORE ELECTRIC DOORS TO CONTEND WITH.RATHER SIMPLE STUFF REALLY BUT THE
   LEVEL IS QUITE LONG WINDED,AND CAN PROVE A LONG HAUL IF YOU DON`T USE THE
   MAP TO REMEMBER THE CORRECT ROUTE THROUGH.TIME IS TIGHT SO DON`T STOP TO
   ADMIRE THE VIEW AND FROM THIS LEVEL,MEN START APPEARING FROM NOWHERE SO
   BE
   ON YOUR GUARD! <BR><BR>

   LEVEL 9 (4 BOMBS TO PLANT) <BR>
   TIME FOR THE CONVEYOR BELTS.JUST MOVE THE JOYSTICK THE OTHER WAY TO STOP
   MOVEMENT,TRY TO CROSS THE BELTS AT THE EDGE OF THE AREA WHERE THE BELT
   EMERGES FROM THE WALL.THERE ARE 5 MEN GUARDING THE THIRD CROSS,SO BE
   CAREFUL.ALSO THERE ARE MEN ON THE EXITS SO A SMART-BOMB OR TWO COMES IN
   HANDY. <BR><BR>

   LEVEL 10 (5 BOMBS TO PLANT)  <BR>
   A VERY DANGEROUS LEVEL,AS MEN APPEAR FREQUENTLY AND YOU CAN EASILY BE
   CAUGHT IN CROSSFIRES.STAY ALERT AND KEEP ON THE MOVE,HUGGING THE WALLS
   WHEN CORNERED.ONCE AGAIN THERE ARE GUARDS ON THE EXIT SO BOMB THEM.
    <BR><BR>
   LEVEL 11 (5 BOMBS TO PLANT) <BR>
   THIS IS EASY COMPARED TO THE PREVIOUS ONE! USING THE RADAR WATCH WHERE
   GUARDS ARE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GROUPS OF CONVEYOR BELTS.STICK TO
   THE SIDES WHEN CROSSING THE LAST SET OF 4 CONVEYOR BELTS.ALSO,THERE IS
   AN AMBUSH OVER THE BRIDGE SO EITHER ARM UP WITH CANNON OR SMAR-BOMBS.
   <BR><BR>
   LEVEL 12 (4 BOMBS TO PLANT) <BR>
   MEN STATIONED PRACTICALLY EVERYWHERE SO KEEP THAT TRIGGER FINGER PUMPING!
   TO USE THE MOVING PLATFORMS OVER THE ACID,JUST PUSH RIGHT (OR LEFT) AND
   HOLD IT THERE TO WALK OVER.THE LAST AREA IS A SIMPLE MAZE,BUT THE
   FENCING IS DEADLY TO THE TOUCH CLOSE UP.TAKE YOUR TIME,BETTER TO ARRIVE
   AT THE EXIT LATE THAN NEVER AT ALL! 
    <BR><BR>
   LEVEL 13 (5 BOMBS TO PLANT) <BR>
   THE CANNONS FIRE RANDOMLY WHEN YOU`RE IN RANGE SO QUICKLY SNEAK ROUND THE
   CORNERS AND MOVE DOWN OUT OF THE LINE OF FIRE TO NIP PAST THE CANNONS,
   WHEN POSSIBLE. <BR><BR>

   LEVEL 14 (10 BOMBS TO PLANT)<BR>
   THINGS GET TOUGH WITH TEN BOMBS TO PLANT IN THE MEN-MAKIN MACHINE LEVEL,
   SO THERE IS NO TIME TO STOP! THE BUBBLES ARE HARMLESS,THE MEN AREN`T.
    <BR><BR>
   LEVEL 15 (5 BOMBS TO PLANT)   <BR>
   THE MIDDLE IS A LONG MAZE,WITH MEN APPEARING ALL OVER THE SHOP SO HUG
   THOSE WALLS!FOR THE LASERS THE SEQUENCE OF BLASTS IS :- 1 DOWN,2 DOWN,
   3 DOWN,4 DOWN,8 UP,7 UP,6 UP, AND THEN 5 UP BEFORE REPEATING.TIME IT WELL
   OR ELSE! <BR><BR>

   LEVEL 16 (0 BOMBS TO PLANT)<BR>
   THE FINAL LEVEL AND YOU`LL BE PLEASED TO HEAR THAT THERE ARE NO BOMBS TO
   PLANT!TROUBLE IS YOU`VE GOT TO TIME IT WELL TO GET THROUGH THE MESH
   DOORS.GO IN THE MIDDLE AND RUN THROUGH JUST AS THEY START OPENING
   (WITHOUT STOPPING).YOU SHOULD MAKE IT.FOR THE CONVEYOR BELTS STAY IN THE
   MIDDLE WATCHING FOR GUARDS AS YOU MOVE ACROSS.THEN IT`S PLAIN SAILING TO
   THE END! CONGRATULATIONS. <BR><BR>
