CABAL:

        During play, type "SCHLIKA".  The border should flash.  Press 'F2'
        to finish the level.
        
        If you pause the game you can still move your guns crosshair.

                                (GENERAL HINTS)

        1.  Shoot as many of the buildings as you can, as they block your
            shots at attacking / hiding enemies.

        2.  Shoot the enemies at the bottom of the screen as the bullets
            they fire needless time to get to you and can often trap you in
            a corner.

        3.  Don't forget that you can shoot the enemies' bullets!

        4.  Try to pick up the bonuses straight away.  The 100, 200 and 300
            point bonuses are very useful if you want extra lives.

        5.  Collect special weapons straight away as their rapid fire
            removes buildings faster, giving more breathing space.

        6.  The grey uniformed soldiers (the ones that take a few shots to
            kill) can give a grenade or a special weapon. When he does, two
            men carrying a stretcher will appear.  Shoot these and they
            will give you two grenades, collect them and then shoot them
            again before they go, to receive two more grenades.

        7.  Never stay in corners for too long, the enemy has a habit of
            zeroing in on you.

        8.  Don't waste grenades on buildings unless you really need to.
            If you opt to shoot in small bursts at every building rather
            than concentrating on one building at a time then a grenade may
            finish the job a lot quicker.

        9.  Try not to get killed when the end-level guardians appear
            otherwise your FOE meter will drop to zero and you'll have to
            start again.
