COLONIZATION:

        When starting a new colony name it "Charlotte".  This will allow you
        to see all maps instantly, other European ports, check other county's
        statistics, and gives you $50,000.  When you access the other
        countries european ports you can spend all there money, I did this by
        recruiting loads of people, but you can buy anything.

        If you rename your colony to some thing else you can then start
        another colony called charlotte and get another $50,000. I started a
        colony got 50000 then abandond (sp) it lot's of times and started the
        game with 500,000.
