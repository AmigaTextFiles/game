CANNON FODDER:

        Go to the save game option, then the game requests a name type
        "JOOLS".  Cheat mode active will flash at the bottom of the screen
        and the ranks and abilities of your men will have increased.

                                        (HINTS)

        1.  In Choppas, land on the enemy to kill them, safer than landing
            and getting out.

        2.  I missions in which you have control of a lot of troopers
            seperate the lowest ranking trooper from the rest and give him
            all the weapons, make sure the rest are safe, then attempt the
            mission with one trooper.  If the trooper dies just press
            'ESC'.  This saves a lot of troopers later, such as in mission
            18 phase 5 of 5 - The Door.

        3.  Troopers are able to throw grenades quite along way and over
            walls, trees, and buildings.  Use this to your advantage to
            protect against Biggunz and Jeeps.  To throw a grenade a long
            way, simply position the pointer further than needed.

        4.  Buildings can be destroyed even if you can't see them.  For
            instance, if a trooper is in Biggun and there is a building
            slightly off the edge of the screen, roughly aim at the
            building making sure the pointer is at the very edge of the
            screen and fire.

        5.  Learn to control Jeeps and Skidooz early on (how to skid
            them).  In later levels you may need good control to hit ramps
            at correct angles otherwise you can blow up if you hit walls. 
            This is also useful to get away from shells, rockets, and
            grenades.

        6.  An effective way of destroying snipers is to just run straight
            towards them and shoot your guns.  Don't waste grenades on them
            unless it is necessary.
