CAPTAIN BLOOD:

        When you encounter a particularly friendly alien, ask it the
        following question using the alien icons "CODE GG1".  The alien
        will then give you co-ordinates of another alien called GG.  Go to
        the specified planet and you can then ask GG for the co-ordinates
        of all the other aliens around, by asking "CODE INFORMATION HELP"
        if that doesn't work, replace 'HELP' with the name of an alien.
