CAPONE:

        To find a special bonus, go to the front of the Post Office. Shoot
        the ball at the top of the flag pole, and your score will raise. If
        you shoot it again, you'll see a screen of programmers.  Shoot it
        again and you'll be invincible, standing in the bank.  At the end
        of that round, you will start at the beginning with warp speed.
