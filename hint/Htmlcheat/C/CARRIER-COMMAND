        the keypad displays the current level.  '6' and '8' have some other

        CHEMICAL LASER and place it over the missiles.  Then select the pod
        you want (ACCB, VIRUS BOMB, FUEL) and place it in the AAV.  Then,
        when you've launched the AAV, look at it's weapons and you'll find
        you have both missiles and laser!  On returning to the carrier any
        missiles you have left will be added to the ship's stores.  Carry
        on doing this and hundreds of missiles can be yours.
