ZORK III:

                              SOLUTION



 WELL,  YOU'VE COME A LONG WAY SINCE  YOU  FIRST  STOOD  BY  THE  MAILBOX 
 OUTSIDE  THE HOUSE IN THE FOREST.  YOU'VE DEFEATED THE THIEF,  OUTWITTED 
 THE WIZARD OF FROBOZZ,  AND NOW,  YOU STAND AT THE FOOT OF  THE  ENDLESS 
 STAIRS,  READY TO EMBARK ON THE FINAL PART OF YOUR JOURNEY.  SO, PICK UP 
 THE LAMP,  TURN IT ON,  AND HEAD ALONG DUE S UNTIL YOU COME TO THE SHORE 
 OF  THE LAKE.  DROP THE LAMP <SAY GOODBYE TO IT;  YOU WON'T BE SEEING IT 
 AGAIN>, AND JUMP INTO THE LAKE.  BRRRR!  PRETTY COLD!  SO, DON'T STAY IN 
 THERE      LONG;      SWIM      W      AND     THEN    GO   S . 
 
 GET  THE TORCH,  AND WAIT FOR THE NUMBER TO CHANGE TO "II." THEN,  TOUCH 
 THE TABLE.  MY OH MY!  YOU'RE IN A ROOM FROM ZORK  II...  ROOM  8,  AS A 
 MATTER OF FACT.  HOWEVER,  YOU DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME TO SIGHT-SEE, SO GET 
 THE CAN OF GRUE REPELLANT, THEN TRY MOVING E, AND YOU WILL FIND YOURSELF 
 BACK IN SCENIC VISTA AGAIN.  NOW WAIT FOR THE NUMBER TO CHANGE TO "III," 
 THEN TOUCH THE TABLE AGAIN.  THIS TIME,  YOU'RE IN A DAMP PASSAGE.  DROP 
 THE TORCH, AND JUST WAIT THERE UNTIL YOU'RE PULLED BACK TO SCENIC VISTA. 
 OKAY, YOU'RE FINISHED HERE, SO MOVE ALONG N TO THE SHORE, AND AGAIN JUMP 
 IN  THE LAKE. 
 
 SPLASH!  IT HASN'T GOTTEN ANY WARMER;  IN FACT, YOU JUST DROPPED THE CAN 
 OF REPELLANT. SO, GO DOWN, AND YOU WILL BE ON THE LAKE BOTTOM. AH, THERE 
 IT IS! BUT, COULD THERE BE SOMETHING ELSE THERE, TOO? "GET ALL," AND YOU 
 WILL HAVE NOT ONLY THE REPELLANT BUT ALSO AN  AMULET.  THIS  IS  ONE  OF 
 THOSE "WONDERFUL" VARIABLE THINGS; IT MAY TAKE MORE THAN ONE TRY ON YOUR 
 PART TO GET BOTH ITEMS.  IN THE MEANTIME,  YOU CAN'T  STAY  IN  THE  ICY 
 WATERS TOO LONG, AND SOONER OR LATER A HUNGRY FISH WILL COME LOOKING FOR 
 YOU.  THEREFORE,  IT'S BEST TO SAVE THE GAME BEFORE YOU JUMP IN FROM THE 
 WERN  SHORE.  SO IF YOU DIE IN THE WATER,  OR GET EATEN BY THE FISH,  OR 
 PICKED UP BY THE ROC <WHILE YOU'RE SWIMMING ON THE SURFACE>,  YOU  DON'T 
 HAVE TO START ALL THE WAY BACK AT THE BEGINNING. BY THE WAY, THIS IS THE 
 ONLY ONE OF THE ZORKS WHERE YOU DON'T LOSE POINTS IF YOU DIE.  BUT,  ALL 
 THE  ITEMS  YOU'VE  COLLECTED SO FAR GET SCATTERED ALL AROUND,  AND IT'S 
 TIME-CONSUMING TO GO LOOK FOR THEM.
 
 OKAY,  NOW YOU HAVE THE CAN AND THE AMULET,  SO HEAD UP TO THE  SURFACE, 
 THEN S TO THE SERN SHORE. YOU CAN SEE A CAVE TO THE S, AND IT LOOKS KIND 
 OF DARK.  IN FACT,  IT *IS* DARK IN THERE,  WHICH IS WHY  YOU  HAVE  THE 
 REPELLANT.  SO,  SPRAY THE SMELLY STUFF ON YOURSELF,  AND GO S,  AND YOU 
 WILL FIND YOURSELF IN A DARK PLACE.  GO S AGAIN, THEN E, AND YOU WILL BE 
 IN  THE  KEY ROOM.  WHEW!  AT LE THERE'S"SOME LIGHT IN HERE!  AND BY THE 
 LIGHT YOU CAN SEE A STRANGE KEY. lGED THE KEY,  THEN  MOVE  THE  MANHOLE 
 COVER AND GO DOWN.  HERE YOU ARE ON AN AQUEDUCT. SINCE YOU CAN'T GO BACK 
 <THE GRUE REPELLANT WOULDN'T HAVE LASTED THAT LONG>,  YOU MIGHT AS  WELL 
 GO FORWARD. SO, JUST HEAD ALONG N AND YOU WILL COME TO THE WATER SLIDE. 
 
 GO  N  DOWN  THE  SLIDE,  AND GUESS WHERE YOU ARE?  IN THE DAMP PASSAGE! 
 THERE'S THE TORCH, SO PICK IT UP, BECAUSE YOU'RE CERTAINLY GOING TO NEED 
 A  LIGHT  SOURCE...ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU THINK OF WHERE YOU'RE GOING NEXT. 
 SO,  FROM THE DAMP PASSAGE HIKE ALONG W TO THE JUNCTION <YOU  CAN'T  GET 
 THE SWORD OUT OF THE ROCK, SO DON'T EVEN TRY>, THEN S INTO CREEPY CRAWL, 
 AND SW INTO THE SHADOW LAND. HERE WE COME TO ANOTHER VARIABLE PORTION OF 
 THE  GAME.  YOU  WILL  HAVE  TO WANDER AROUND IN THE SHADOW LAND UNTIL A 
 CLOAKED AND HOODED FIGURE APPEARS.  WHEN THAT HAPPENS,  THE  SWORD  WILL 
 SUDDENLY  MATERIALIZE  IN  YOUR  HAND,  AND  YOU  WILL BE ABLE TO FIGHT. 
 HOWEVER, SINCE THERE'S NO WAY OF TELLING WHEN THAT WILL HAPPEN, YOU JUST 
 HAVE      TO      KEEP      MOVING      AROUND       UNTIL    IT   DOES.
 
 AT LE YOU WILL GET A CHANCE  TO  PRACTICE  SOME  ELEMENTARY  MAP-MAKING! 
 ALSO,  THIS  IS  THE  MOST DANGEROUS PART OF THE GAME,  AS THE FIGURE IS 
 QUITE CAPABLE OF KILLING YOU,  TOO!  SO,  BEST TO SAVE BEFORE YOU  ENTER 
 SHADOW LAND. WHEN THE MYSTERIOUS FIGURE FINALLY APPEARS, ATTACK HIM WITH 
 YOUR SWORD UNTIL HE IS BADLY WOUNDED AND CANNOT DEFEND HIMSELF.  AT THAT 
 POINT,  GET HIS HOOD.  THE FIGURE WILL THEN DISAPPEAR, LEAVING THE CLOAK 
 BEHIND.  GET THAT ALSO.  NOW,  YOU HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE,  AND I CAN'T 
 TELL YOU EXACTLY HOW,  SINCE THERE'S NO WAY OF KNOWING EXACTLY WHERE YOU 
 WERE WHEN THE FIGHT STARTED.  HOWEVER,  IF YOU GO EWARDS,  YOU WILL EXIT 
 THE  SHADOW  LAND  AT  EITHER  THE CREEPY CRAWL OR THE FOGGY ROOM.  FROM 
 EITHER PLACE,  GO N  TO  THE  JUNCTION.  FROM  THE  JUNCTION,    IT'S  W 
 THROUGH   THE   BARREN   AREA,   AND   W  AGAIN . 
 
 
 YOU JUST CAN'T WAIT TO CLIMB DOWN THE ROPE, HUH? WELL, PICK UP THE BREAD 
 FIRST, THEN GO DOWN TO THE LEDGE. WELL, WELL, A CHEST! TOO BAD YOU DON'T 
 HAVE  A  KEY TO OPEN IT.  IN FACT,  THERE'S NO WAY FOR YOU TO OPEN IT AT 
 ALL. BUT DON'T DESPAIR, THERE'S A WAY OF DOING IT.  JUST WAIT AROUND AND 
 SOMEONE  WILL COME ALONG THE TOP OF THE CLIFF.  YOU MAY NOT REALLY TRUST 
 HIM,  BUT TIE THE ROPE TO THE CHEST WHEN HE ASKS,  AND WAIT AROUND  SOME 
 MORE. EVENTUALLY, HE WILL RETURN AND HELP YOU BACK UP THE CLIFF. HE WILL 
 ALSO GIVE YOU A STAFF, WHICH IS WHAT YOU'RE REALLY AFTER HERE.  TAKE THE 
 STAFF,  THEN  GO  BACK DOWN TO THE LEDGE,  AND FROM THERE,  TO THE CLIFF 
 BASE. 
 
 TREK S TO THE FLATHEAD OCEAN,  AND DO A LITTLE MORE WAITING.  SOONER  OR 
 LATER A SHIP WIL OKAY, NOW W, W, W, N, N, N, E, E, AND PUSH THE S WALL TWO TIMES. 
 
 08.  FROM  THERE,  W,  S,  S,  E,  E,  N  AND PUSH THE W WALL TWO TIMES. 
 
 09 . NOW, S, W,  AND PUSH THE N WALL UNTIL IT WON'T MOVE ANY MORE. 
 
 10.  THEN W AND N. FINALLY! YOU HAVE MANEUVERED THE LADDER UNDER THE HOLE
 
 <WHICH WAS THE PURPOSE OF ALL THIS PUSHING AND RUNNING AROUND>,  AND NOW 
 YOU CAN JUST GO UP AND OUT! WHEW! 
 
 OKAY,  YOU'VE SOLVED THE ROYAL PUZZLE AND YOU HAVE THE BOOK,  SO GO N TO 
 THE MUSEUM ENTRANCE,  THEN OPEN THE E DOOR AND GET YOUR OTHER STUFF FROM 
 THE JEWEL ROOM.  THEN IT'S BACK W TO THE GREAT DOOR, AND FROM THERE BACK 
 TO THE JUNCTION.  NOW, E INTO THE DAMP PASSAGE, AND NE TO THE ENGRAVINGS 
 ROAM.  WELL,  WE  HAVE  HERE  YET  ANOTHER <!> OF THOSE VARIABLE EVENTS: 
 SOONER OR LATER, AN OLD MAN WILL BE SLEEPING HERE. IF HE ISN'T THERE THE 
 FIRST TIME YOU ARRIVE, WALK AROUND A LITTLE AND RETURN. WHEN YOU FINALLY 
 DO SEE HIM, WAKE HIM UP AND GIVE HIM THE BREAD.  HE WILL EAT IT AND THEN 
 MAKE VISIBLE TO YOU A SECRET DOOR.  HE WILL THEN VANISH.
 
 OKAY,  YOU'RE GETTING CLOSER TO THE END!  OPEN THE DOOR, AND GO INTO THE 
 BUTTON ROOM, THEN N TO THE BEAM ROOM. PUT THE SWORD IN THE BEAM, THEN GO 
 BACK  TO  THE BUTTON ROOM AND PUSH THE BUTTON.  NOW,  BACK N TO THE BEAM 
 ROOM AND N AGAIN INTO THE MIRROR ROOM.  THERE WILL BE AN OPENING IN  THE 
 MIRROR,  SO GO N ONE MORE TIME,  AND YOU WILL BE INSIDE.  NOW, DON'T LET 
 THE LONG AND COMPLICATED DESCRIPTIONS SCARE YOU!  IT'S NOT REALLY AS BAD 
 AS YOU THINK <IT'S WORSE!  HEHEHEHEH..JUST KIDDING!>.  FIRST,  RAISE THE 
 SHORT POLE. THEN, PUSH THE WHITE PANEL TWICE.  NOW, PUSH THE PINE PANEL, 
 AND GO N. 
 
 OKAY,  SO  HERE YOU ARE,  STANDING A LITTLE TOO CLOSE FOR COMFORT TO THE 
 GUARDIANS OF ZORK.  IF I WERE YOU,  I WOULDN'T TRY GOING PAST THEM QUITE 
 YET!  OPEN THE VIAL, THEN DRINK THE LIQUID.  WHILE NOTHING SEEMS TO HAVE 
 HAPPENED,  YOU HAVE IN FACT BECOME INVISIBLE.  NOW YOU CAN WALK N  UNTIL 
 YOU COME TO THE LOCKED DOOR.  KNOCK ON THE DOOR,  AND THE DUNGEON MASTER 
 WILL OPEN IT AND LET YOU IN.  ALL RIGHT, HANG IN THERE, YOU HAVE REACHED 
 THE END GAME!  GO N, THEN W, THEN N AGAIN. THE DM WILL BE FOLLOWING YOU. 
 GO N TO THE PARAPET, SET THE DIAL TO 4, AND PUSH THE BUTTON.  NOW, GO S, 
 OPEN THE CELL DOOR, AND STEP INSIDE.  THE DM WILL NOT FOLLOW YOU IN. 
 
 ONCE INSIDE, YOU WILL NOTICE A BRONZE DOOR IN ONE OF THE WALLS. HOWEVER, 
 YOU CAN'T OPEN IT YET!  SOMETHING ELSE HAS TO BE DONE,  AND IT WILL HAVE 
 TO BE DONE BY SOMEONE ELSE.  SO, FIRST TELL THE DM TO GO TO THE PARAPET. 
 THEN TELL HIM TO TURN THE DIAL TO 1,  AND THEN  TELL  HIM  TO  PUSH  THE 
 BUTTON. ALL RIGHT!! THE MAGIC MOMENT HAS ARRIVED! UNLOCK THE BRONZE DOOR 
 WITH THE KEY, OPEN THE DOOR, AND GO S!  ** TA DA!!  ** FINALLY,  ZORK IS 
 FINISHED!  YOU HAVE SURVIVED ALL THE PERILS,  PITFALLS, AND PUZZLES, AND 
 NOW, *YOU* ARE THE NEW DUNGEON MASTER.
