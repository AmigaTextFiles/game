TEARAWAY THOMAS:

        At any time, type any of the following: (screen will flash to let
        you know if it worked.)

                "NORMAL"_______________Disables all active cheats.
                "LIFE IS TOO SHORT"____________For infinite lives.
                "IRON MAN THOMAS"_______________For invincibility.
                "ANY LEVEL"___________________Activate stage skip.
                (Down cursor to advance level and up to go back)

        There is a secret level located on level 1.3, and can be found by
        climbing up to the ninth branch of the tree (which is the one with
        the birds on it) and running off the end. You then will be whisked
        off to a room containing some diamonds which can be collected for
        extra points.

        This next cheat didn't work on my version of the game, but I left it
        in just in case it works on other versions.  At any time, type
        "TIMEFLIESLIKEABANANA" for infinite time.
