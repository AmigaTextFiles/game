TURRICAN:

        On the high score table, enter "BLUESMOBIL" for you name.  Now
        restart the game and you will get 99 guys.

        Or try;
        Get a high score more than 20,000  and quit game. for 99 lives.

        If you come to a bad guy that you don't want to deal with, leave the
        screen and then come back.  The bad guy should be gone.
        Unfortunately this also happens to extra men and weapons.
