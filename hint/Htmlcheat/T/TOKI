TOKI:

        During play, type "KILLER" (the border should flash).  This will
        give you infinite credits.  Now use the following keys:

                'R'________________Flips the screen upside down.
                'F1-F7'_____________Skip to corresponding level.
                'F8'_____________________________________Ending.

       If you type KILLER a second time, the screen will turn upside down!
       This makes it quite hard to play.

       During the intro press ESC then type POORTOKI
       Start the game and press ESC once the map screen has passed.
       Then pressing function keys during the intro will allow you to skip
       levels.
