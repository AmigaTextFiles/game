THEME PARK:

        Insert disk 3 to load the game without the intro sequence, as the
        screen goes blank press 'C' a few times.  Once the game has loaded,
        select a new game, then when you get to the map screen you should 
        notice that your player's name has changed to "It's You, Buddy".
        Now when the game starts, you will have plenty of cash in your bank
        account.

      / Enter "FLIGHT SIM" for the name of the park and you will start the
      | game with 200K instead of the usuall 130K.
      |
      | Enter "DEMO" for the name of the park for a ready made one.

        These two cheats may be for the Ecs version only as they do not
        appear to work on my version.

        Position a bouncy castle anywhere in the park (positioning the
        entrance and exit any where).  Now pause the game until you notice
        the writing above the entrance speed up, and type 'L', (pause),
        'I', (pause), 'V', (pause), 'E', (pause), 'C', (pause), 'A',
        (pause), 'S', (pause), 'H', (pause), 'P', and 'P'.  You should now
        get a new shop and ride every year.

        To get the baddest roller coaster without having to pay for it, 
        place your roller coaster doorway where you want and build the
        smallest loop you can around it using the least number of sections
        possible.  Open it up and close it down immediately (to only be
        charged for the tiny ride).  Now remove the tiny loop and build
        your dream coaster without paying a dime.
