           -> Version 4.5 because I only added a few cheats <-

***************** VERSION 4.5 MAY BE THE LAST!!!!!! ************************

Html cheat is a large cheats database in Html format containing Solutions,
patch cheats, players guides and cheats.

Just load up the Index.Html file on your preferred browser,
or double click the icon to run it on A-web. (Aweb: must be assigned.)

I suggest you dont use I-browse because a requestor will pop up whenever you
try to view a text file.


THE FUTURE OF HTML CHEAT:
------------------------
Non exsistent if I dont get any e-mails from this.


UPDATES:
--------
This may be the last version of HtmlCheat because I only got one e-mail.
I personally have also given up playing computer games and now spend my time
playing muds instead. If I dont get much e-mail for this it WILL be the last
version.


Usage:
------
Html Cheat MAY be used on homepages as long as the following guidelines are
met:

1. I am informed of it's use along with the adress it will be used at.
2. It may not be changed unless I have agreed with the changes.
3. HtmlCheat may not be added to your homepage unless I say so.

You wont find HtmlCheat on any web pages ATM because no-one is hosting it.


Other usage:

HtmlCheat may be placed on Cd's as long as I receive a free copy of the cd.
(Aminet may use it without giving me a free cd) 

Pass it around to whoever you like, dont ask for money for it though.
