POWERMONGER:

        Instruct your captain to invent something, pause the game, put the
        game speed up to full, and wait a couple of minutes.  Now unpause
        the game, the captain will have kept inventing during the pause!

        When you wish to invent in double quick time, click invent and
        when your men leave, click on it again.  This often makes a
        catapult almost immediately, but this cheat only works once on
        each island.
