PAWN:

        After completing the game, once you have examined the listing type
        in "DEBUG".  You will see the ">" prompt change to "]", and you will
        now be invincible, able to wander anywhere in the game without being
        hurt.  Try typing in "DEBUG" at the beginning of the game for the
        same effect.
