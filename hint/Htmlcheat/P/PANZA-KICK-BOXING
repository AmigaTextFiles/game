PANZA KICK BOXING:

        The best moves to use are upper cut, round house, low leg kick.  The
        low leg kick is useful for keeping your opponent out of range and on
        target for a round house followed by an upper cut.  The double
        backfist is also very poweful and often provides a knockout punch.
        If you are losing a fight, and don't have much chance of recovery,
        then press the 'ESC' key so that your stats remain intact.
