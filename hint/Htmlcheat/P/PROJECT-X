PROJECT X:

        If you fly into the first end of level baddie when its jaws opens
        up, avoiding its fire and being careful not to touch it, you will
        be presented with a version of Space Invaders.  Complete one wave
        and you will be given three extra lives and be thrown back into the
        fray.

        When you die, pilot your flashing ship down below the score at the
        bottom of the screen to have a free tunnel of aliens.

        On the end of level 2 Guardian make sure you have a couple of homing
        missiles and the side shot. As soon as the guardian appears, move to
        the top Right hand corner of the screen and stay there. Keep your
        finger on the fire button until the guardian fizzles out and dies.
