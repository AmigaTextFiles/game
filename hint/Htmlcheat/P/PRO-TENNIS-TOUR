PRO TENNIS TOUR:

        Climbing the world tennis rankings!  Play the first set; when the
        score screen appears, press the fire button, then ESC.  The screen
        will then declare "Game, Set and Match" to your opponent.  Even so,
        you'll find your ranking has just dropped from 64 to around 54.
        Repeat the process until you find an opponent you can beat!
