PARADROID 90:

        On the title screen, press 'F3' to bring up an option screen.

        The extra ship is the pirate mothership.  To reach it, collect the
        grafgold key hidden on every ship.  The grafgold keys are usually
        found under crates and so on.  Collecting a key keeps the pirates at
        bay for a further three minutes. A 5000 point bonus is given for
        completing a ship with grafgold key.  Complete the final ship with
        every grafgold key to be beamed aboard the pirate mothership for a
        fight to the death.
