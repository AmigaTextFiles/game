STORMLORD:

        On the credit screen, type "DRAGONBRIDGE".  A message should appear
        to let you know it worked.  This will give you infinite lives.
        During play pause the game and press 'L' to skip levels.

        Another cheat is:  When the game starts to load hold down the mouse
        button and the joystick fire button and keep them held down until
        the game loads.  Then when the game starts pause it straight away
        and type 'MNBVC'.  This will give you infinite time and lives, and
        if you pause the game and press 'L' you will advance a level.

        Enter 'JAMES CAMERON' on the high score table.  Now, whenever you
        need more lives, hit F9.
