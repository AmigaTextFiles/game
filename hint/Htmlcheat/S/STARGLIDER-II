                After getting all of the above ingredients, go to broadway.
                Make sure you have a crate of castrobars in the hold. 

            Cruise the surface and tractor beam the first emma 2 you see.
            Bring it aboard.  Taymar is inside.  He will install the cuboid
            launcher and agree to go to apogee.  Take him to the Apogee
            Depot.  When the neutron bomb is built, take it to Q-beta's
            false moon.  If all 6 projector bases have been rebuilt, drop by
            one and blow it up.  You will see the space station, surrounded
            by mini-sentinels.  Take a couple out with missiles.  Move
            toward the station, and when you're directly over it, drop the
            bomb.  A massive explosion follows, and you win the game!!!
