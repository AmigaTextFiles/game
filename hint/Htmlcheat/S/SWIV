SWIV:

        Pause the game, then type "NCC-1701N", for unlimited lives.

        After defeating a Goosecopter, fire continously at one of the
        tokens.
        After 32 hits, it will turn into a star, which when collected will
        yield mega-powerful six-way fire. Just be careful not to hit the
        token again before collecting it, or it will revert back to the one
        of the ordinary power-up tokens.
