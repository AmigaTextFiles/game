        pressing the numeric keys 1 to 0 and the minus key.

        Version 2-If you have the latest version then attempting the above
        will reveal the message: 'Congratulations!, you have found the cheat
        mode...
        unfortunately it has been ZZAPPED!'. If this happens goto the control
        selection and type 'scrap 28' and then start the game. The effect is the
        same as above.
