SWITCHBLADE II:

        On the title screen, type "LEVELn" and press fire to start on the
        corresponding level.  Where 'n' is the level number like "LEVEL2"
        to go to level two.

        Also, on the title screen type "CHROME" to enter the sub game.  On
        the CHROME title screen, type "HELO TO GORDON AND DAVEE".  Start the
        game and you will be invincible.  For the level codes see CHROME.

        Note:  The cheat for Chrome only works with the Switchblade 2 sub
        game.  It doesn't work in the stand alone version!
