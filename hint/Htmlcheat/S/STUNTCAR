STUNT CAR RACER:


                               PLAYERS GUIDE




                               THE COURSES
                              -------------


                            The Stepping Stones
                           ---------------------

Fairly standard high-rise racing up to the stones. Hit them at about 140 and
use the boost if necessary on the last few.



                               The High Jump
                              ---------------

Accelerate to top speed with full boost at the start to give you enough speed
to jump the pillar in the middle. You can bounce your way over the pillar if
you're speed isn't quite top-whack (causing minor damage). However there's a
fair chance that you'll slide afterwards - if so bye, bye car!



                            The Roller Coaster
                           --------------------

Don't go too fast as you pass the start line otherwise you'll miss the first
corner - around the 150 mark should do it. It's pretty obvious but the actual
Coaster is THE place for picking up speed.



                              The Little Ramp
                             -----------------

Hit the jump at around 150.



                              The Draw Bridge
                             -----------------

DON'T hit the bridge while it is up - Just wait until it's on the way down
before attempting it (a little earlier if you're at the bottom with the engine
idling).



                               The Ski Jump
                              --------------

Don't go too fast on the first left turn or you'll go flying over the next
corner. After that you may as well go for it. This is one of the few courses
where it pays to go like mad (baring the first turns, of course). If you reach
top speed as you reach the jump then you should (in theory) touch down neatly
on the slope following it.



                               The Big Ramp
                              --------------

A good speed is needed at the start for the first two 'small' ramps; about 170
is best. You will need to be travelling at round 210 for the big jump itself.



                               The Hump Back
                              ---------------

It may look easy but it sure as anything isn't, if you go too fast. If you find
yourself going over it at top speed you may well float over and smack into the
corner after the hump. Only use boost where it is a necessity (at the
start / finish mainly).





                               GENERAL TIPS
                              --------------

  It is best to use the Turbo Boost in even amounts while you roar around the
track (depending on the course naturally). Use a bit extra boost at the start
to pull in front of your competitor (especially if it's Bully Boy).
  Try not to hit your opponent on a corner as you will most likely come off as
well. If you must hit him, try not to run into him - best to nudge him from the
side. A point that people don't think about is when you've just taken a jump
take your finger off the fire button. It just wastes valuable boost units when
the adrenaline pumping.





                   THE BEST DRIVERS AND HOW TO BEAT THEM
                  ---------------------------------------


                                 Whizz Kid
                                -----------

At first, stay behind and follow him, watch out for his characteristics and if
you get a chance, boost directly behind him until he blocks your vision (some
knowledge of the track will help) then pull left then right and he's outta your
way. Save this till the end.



                                  Hot Rod
                                 ---------

The same rules as apply to the Whizz Kid. Don't overtake till nearly the end of
the race.



                                 The Dodger
                                ------------

In my opinion he's the hardest. If you get to the 1st Division then you should
have a lot of skill. All you do is battle, you'll have to ram him out of your
way if you can make it to the top.



                                  Big Ed
                                 --------

The most annoying thing about him is the way he wheelies just in front of you
when you get near, especially at the start. Take him on the jump; speed up and
jump over the big guy.



                                Dare Devil
                               ------------

The hardest of the lower order drivers but if you're good and know the track
you can boost in on the bends and take him on the outside. It takes cool nerves
and a joystick of steel.
