SHINOBI:

        Pause the game and type "LARSXVIII" for infinite credits or hold the
        LEFT MOUSE BUTTON, then type "LARSXVIII" for invincibility.  Press
        'Q' while game is paused, for music menu. (It might be "LARSVII")
        
        On the helicopter boss pause the game and type
        "HELICOPTERTOOTOUGHFORME".  Then die and you will then go to level
        3 (if you have another life left).

        When the shinobi logo appears on the title screen hold down "T" and
        move the mouse to control it.
