                                (LEVEL CODES)

            Level 2-"FUZZ OUT    "          Level 5-"EAT THE RICH"
            Level 3-"BOO         "          Level 6-"OPEN SESAME "
            Level 4-"I C A U F O "          Level 7-"SNAZZI RULES"

        Make sure when you use the cheats that you put spaces where the 
        dashes are.  The level codes can be entered with or without the
        spaces.

        The actual cheats for infinite live, infinite energy, and film was
        removed, but if you have a action replay or a hex editor you can
        put your own in.  There are three different ones.  Search for
        "+  PUT YOUR  +", "+  CHEAT  +", or "+   HERE   +".  Change these
        to any 12 characters such as "AAAAAAAAAAAA", "BBBBBBBBBBBB", etc.
        The new code has to be in capital letters.
