STRIDER II:

        While playing type "SWIFT".  A cheat icon should appear in the upper
        left hand corner.  Now use the following keys:

                    'E'_____________Replenish your life meter.
                    'D'___________Replenish robots life meter.
                    'S'____Destroys all enemies on the screen.
                    'H'_____________Displays game info in HEX.
                    'R'__Replaces energy icon after picked up.
                    'HELP'______________Deactivates the cheat.

        The cursor keys can be used to move Strider anywhere on th current
        game map.
                    
        Press 'LEFT SHIFT' to pause the game, and keep pressing 'TAB' to
        simulate slow motion.  To deactivate hold down 'LEFT SHIFT' and
        press 'TAB'.  Let go of 'TAB' and then let go of the 'LEFT SHIFT'.
        
        I couldn't get this next one to work with my version, but I left it
        cause it might work on another version.  During play press 'HELP',
        'LEFT AMIGA', and '1' at the same time to activate the cheat.
        Press '1'-'5' to skip to the corresponing level.
