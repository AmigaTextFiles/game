STAR TREK - 25TH ANNIVERSARY:

        When in space combat, fire your phasers and torpeoes at the enemy
        vessel.  Then press 'D' to get Scotty on the damage control.  All
        the action stops, but your phasers and torpedoes will still
        recharge.  When the action begins again you will be able to fire at
        the target straight away.  Repeat this process a few times and your
        enemy will not last long.
