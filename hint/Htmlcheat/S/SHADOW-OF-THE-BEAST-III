SHADOW OF THE BEAST III:

        On the title screen, type "DADDY DRAW THIS FOR ME" and press
        'RETURN'.  The shurikan should turn to a smiley face with letters
        under it.  During the game use the 'RIGHT CURSOR' key for
        invicibility and the 'LEFT CURSOR' key to go back to normal.
