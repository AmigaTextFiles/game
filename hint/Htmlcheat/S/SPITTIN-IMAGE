        The game is easiest if fought in this order:

                1) REAGAN, POPE
                2) GORBY, POPE
                3) AYATOLLAH, POPE
                4) BOTHA, POPE
                5) MARGARET, POPE

        Finally a couple of useful pointers: keep close to your opponent,
        so they can't hit you back.  Always move away from your opponent
        when their helpers appear, and hit your opponent with your special
        move, when they are using theirs.
