                             SOLUTION


  Turn on the Police radio
  Go for a ride
  Call for back up (outside the playschool)
  Open the door and enter the building
  Tell him what you have seen
  Stand on the plate (when the truck is coming towards you)
  Start the Hunt! (after the truck misses)
  Stand on the Brake
  Try to start it
  Call for Backup
  Call for Backup again
  Sneak inside quietly
  Press yourself to the left wall
  Go into the building
  Follow the guy a bit further
  Drive up the steps
  Try to jump off in time
  You made it!

  Note:  Do not Mess with the boss, because he'll blow your head off!
