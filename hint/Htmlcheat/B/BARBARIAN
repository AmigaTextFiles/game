BARBARIAN (Palace):

        On the final level where you confront Drax, walk forward, and when
        the first fireball comes, jump, then do a forward roll into him.

        Level 1:  left, left, right seven times, left, right, left, in the
                  cave, and right.

        Level 2:  right, up, left, up, left, left, right, left three times,
                  up, and left.

        Level 3:  up, right, right, up, left, right, up, right, left, left,
                  up, left, left, up, up, right, right, left, left, up.

        Level 4:  hit the fireballs, then try to leap across.  Several low
                  chops will destroy it.
                  Next is the Pit Demon; when he reaches out, use an
                  overhead chop to hit his arms;
                  repeat until death.  Next, Drax himself!  Wait until he
                  pauses between spells, and hit him with a flying head
                  chop.         




BARBARIAN (Psygnosis):

        Start the game, then type "04-08-59" for near invincibility.  To
        kill the final Wizard, you must have a shield.  When his shot comes
        at you, use the defense icon, and it will fly back at him.

        To replenish any lost energy, hold down the HELP, M and E keys
        simultanously.
