BUBBLE BOBBLE:

        If you can get to levels 10, 20, 30 and 40 without losing a life, a
        magic door will appear to take you to a bonus screen, and if you
        can get up to stage 50 without losing a life, a magic door will
        appear and take you to level 70.  On levels 7 & 22 wait a few
        seconds until an umbrella falls and grab it, you will warp ahead 6
        levels.  Alternatively, try these:

                    'F1'____________________To advance 1 level.
                    'F2'_________________To advance six levels.
                    'F3'______________To advance eleven levels.

       While in the first screen, bubble the first two monsters and then
       fill the screen with hundreds of bubbles.  Bubble and burst the
       remaining monster and the remaining bubbles should turn into fruit
       (usually bananas), each of which is worth 500 points.  Also, Hold
       down the fire button after losing your last life, and you should get
       another set of lives, though your score will be reset.

       Beating level 100:
       jump on the small platforms to collect all the
       green potion bottles.  they will give you lightning bolts.  Jump down
       alongside the wall and let that monster have it!!  After 100 hits, he
       will turn into a bubble.  Pop him and you've done it!
