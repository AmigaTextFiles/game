BUNDESLIGA MANAGER PRO:

        Lots of money:

            1.  Go to the bank and take out a loan of 1 Deutschmark.
            2.  Repeat #1 2 more times.
            3.  Now go to the bank and take out a fourth loan for 3,999,999
                marks.  You will be told you can't take out a fourth loan,
                but the money will appear in your account anyway.

        Success:

            1.  Offer 3 players for sale at the transfer-market. (remember
                the shirt numbers of each one).
            2.  Now get 3 new players and give them the same shirt numbers
                as the players you offered to sell.
            3.  Now take the players you put up forsale and put them on the
                field ---> 14 players!
