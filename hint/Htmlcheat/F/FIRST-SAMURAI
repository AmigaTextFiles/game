FIRST SAMURAI:

        Pause game then type "DIPUTS".  Pressing the number keys now lets
        you teleport around the level.  When you load up disk one and the
        word {GOONIES} appears, hold down one of these mystical keys for
        various effects:

                'F1'________Infinite energy and infinite weapons.
                'F2'_____________________________Infinite energy.
                'F3'______________________________Infinite lives.

        If this cheat should fail try typing this one in instead!  While
        playing the game, hit the pause button and type in "DIPUTS". 
        Now you should be able to press any number key to teleport to
        different stages throughout the current level.
