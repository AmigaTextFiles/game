FALCON:

        If your ammo runs low, press 'CTRL' and 'X' during the game and 
        watch the extra 500 rounds and 9 sidewinders clock up on the
        instruments.  It maybe 'CTRL', 'L SHIFT', and 'X'.  For a perfect
        landing, hold the 'HELP' key down about 10 to 20 feet above the
        runway.

        If you get badly hit, don't bail out, instead swing round and head
        for home.  Press 'HELP' and the '+' on the keypad and keep them
        depressed.  The F16 will stay level and drop down.  Switch to
        tracking mode and rotate to side view.  Just before touch down,
        pitch up the nose and the plane will touch down successfully every
        time.  Select "end mission" and you will be rescued even if you are
        in enemy territory.
