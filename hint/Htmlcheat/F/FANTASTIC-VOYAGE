FANTASTIC VOYAGE:

        On the title screen, press fire to start the game.  When you are
        asked to enter disk two, enter the second disk.  After you insert
        the 2nd disk the drive light should go on for a second and then
        off.  Now quickly press and hold the LEFT and RIGHT MOUSE BUTTONS,
        the FIRE BUTTON, and the 'SPACE BAR'.  Hold them until the drive
        light goes out again.  You should now be at the control room
        screen.  Press fire to start and you will now start with 99 lives.
