        Taxi down U.S. 101, turn right at highway 92, pull up to the EA
        headquarters and blow it away!<BR><BR>

        In mission 6, once you've fired all your missiles, you can land on
        the shadow sub (if it's still afloat) and it will refuel and rearm
        you.<BR><BR>
    
        Select option 2 {FREE FLIGHT, NO ENEMY CONFRONTATION} from the main
        menu.  Then select zero instead of 1 to 4.  The screen will go into
        a spiral and scroll way south to 34 by 117 degrees, placing your
        plane somewhere without a runway.  This happens to be in the middle
        of edwards air force base, where the F/A-18 was flight tested.
        To take off you have to use the afterburners.  117 degrees is the
        furthest south you'll be able to fly, but you can go in other
        directions.  Is there more to this back door?
