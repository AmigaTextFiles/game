FLY HARDER CD³²:
    
                                    (LEVEL CODES)

        2-"PHO"   3-"MET"   4-"BLA"   5-"SUP"   6-"TRA"   7-"QUA"   8-"NEO"
        
        These next two are just guesses (the level codes for the CD³² are
        the same as the first three letters of the A500 version, so the
        cheats may also work):
        
        Try entering "MEC" for your password for infinite lives.
        
        Try entering "BIG" for your password to see the ending.
