F17 CHALLENGE:
    
        When you reach a tunnel crash against the left wall and hold the
        joystick there until you reach 100 percent damage.  Then hold down
        the fire button and your damage will go up to about 700 percent and
        reset back to 0 percent.  Make sure you are well inside the tunnel
        or you will reach daylight halfway through the cheat.
