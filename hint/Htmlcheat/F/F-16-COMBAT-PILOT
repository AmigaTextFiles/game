F-16 COMBAT PILOT:

        If you`re fed up with landing try the following: Jetison all fuel
        and weapons and climb to 65000ft. Stay there until the last of your
        fuel runs out.  Dive towards the ground and at 10 or 11 thousand
        feet pull up hard. You will then be able to rise about 4000 ft and
        then start falling towards the ground.  Just as you hit the ground
        the mission will end safely.
