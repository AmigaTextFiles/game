After you have travelled into the future, been into the sewer and
discovered the beast attacking the woman and her child, and also
have the fuses and have uncovered the tap, go back up to the
surface and hunt through the rubble until you find the blowtorch.
Take this down into the sewer, fill it with gas from the tap and
incinerate the monster.
