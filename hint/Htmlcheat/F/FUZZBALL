FUZZBALL:

        On a really hard level, wait for ages until your time runs out.
        A swarm of bees will now fly at you. shoot as many of them as you
        can.  It does not matter whether you die.  After losing a life, the
        bees disappear, as have the baddies.  You are then free to complete
        the level with no foes.
