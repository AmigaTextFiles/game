ALIEN 3:

        During play press 'P' to pause the game.  Now hold down the LEFT
        MOUSE BUTTON and press 'F1'.  The background should change to
        green.  Now unpause the game and use 'N' to advance levels.  To
        shut the cheat off repeat the previous instructions.

        Start level one, take out the disk and insert disk number 2.  let
        all your time run out, after the chest bursting bit you are taken
        to a much later level, no matter what the brief says!  On the
        level after this one, at the top right before the exit, there is
        a platform full of medipacks,climb the ladder that seems to go
        nowhere, on the level after that go to the bottom left for full
        everything.
