ARCADE POOL (Team 17):

        In two-player mode, after your opponent fouls in US pool, grab the
        cue ball and before you take your shot, push it in between two
        other balls that are that are close together on the table, so that
        the cue ball touches both of the other balls.  This nudges the
        balls a bit and if thay are in the right place you could set
        yourself up a treat, or ruin your friend's plans.  The computer
        players don't mind, but your friend will.

        In Speed Pool, put all of the balls apart from one, then line the
        last onen the pocket.  Select save, the New to start with one ball
        left on 0 minutes and 00 seconds.
