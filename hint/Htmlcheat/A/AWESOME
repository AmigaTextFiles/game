AWESOME (Psygnosis):

        Finish the 1st shoot'em up section then on the screen that follows
        (The Armoury), move the pointer to the box with the word shield in
        it (upper left hand corner).  Now hold down the '+' key on the
        numeric keypad and press fire.  Allocate all energy to the weapons.
        The following keys will now be available during play:

                    'F6'_________________Replenish life meter.
                    'F1'__________Finish shoot'em up sections.
                    '2'-'9'____________________Select weapons.
                    '0'________________________Another weapon.
                    '-'________________________Another weapon.
                    '='________________________Another weapon.
                    '1'___________________Remove extra weapon.

       To become indestructable, gain infinite money and fuel, complete the
       first attack level. When the shields/weapons screen appears, move the
       cursor to the top left corner of the screen. This will place it in the
       shields box. Now press the joystick button while hitting the + key on
       the keypad. The screen will flash, indicating that the cheat mode has
       been activated. If the screen does not flash, keep pressing fire and
       hitting the + key simulataneously. It will work eventually. Now trans-
       fer all the energy to the weapons. Shields can still be drained by
       hits and colliding with objects, but once it reaches 000, the ship can
       not be destroyed.

       To win at the game, simply choose the last planet as the destination.
       Once you enter the spaceport, there will be a short animation showing
       your ship leaving the galaxy.
