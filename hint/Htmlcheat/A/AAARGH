AAARGH!:

        At the start of each screen you'll find various buildings.  Blow
        fire over them, and then hit them.  This will make them fall down a
        lot faster.  When you burn or knock down a house you get an egg.
        To beat the other monsters in a fight for an egg, don't jump around
        and breath fire, just hold your ground and punch forward.  After
        three or four falls, your foe will stay down.  Keep eating, even if
        it dosen't show any increase on screen, your health will skyrocket.
