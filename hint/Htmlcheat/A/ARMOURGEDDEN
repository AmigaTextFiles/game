ARMOURGEDDEN:

        When in the HQ, access the messages screen. Move the arrow so it
        points to the first letter of the message highlighted in yellow.
        Now hold down 'ESC' and press the LEFT MOUSE BUTTON.  The message
        {YOU WOULDN`T LET IT LIE} should appear. This indicates that the
        cheat mode is active.  You now have an invincible craft and an
        infinite supply of fuel and firepower.  To turn the cheat mode off
        (you need to do this to complete the game), simply access the
        message screen again, point at the first letter of the message
        highlighted in yellow, press and hold down 'ESC' and press the LEFT
        MOUSE BUTTON.  The message {LOOK AT THE SIZE OF THAT SAUSAGE!}
        should appear.  The cheat mode is de-activated.

        Armourgedden also has an object editor. To enter it, use the mouse
        to move the arrow to the top left hand corner of the secondary
        title screen.  Now hold down 'LEFT SHIFT' and the LMB to find a
        verticle line.  The Keys to use are; 'F9' zoom in, 'F10' zoom out,
        numeric keypad brackets retate object, numeric keypad '7' and '8'
        also rotate.  Cursor left previous object, cursor right next
        object, press 'ESC' to exit.
