ARKANOID 3 (Revenge Of Doh):
 
        When the pink loading screen appears, hold down Caps Lock and type
        IMAGINE.

        When the opening bit plays, type PETEJOHNSONWANTSCHEAT.  Now, when
        you press S, it causes both exits to open, and you can go on to the
        next screen without finishing it.

        Or, type DALEY88 instead at the pink screen, and you can now restart
        at the level you last died on!

        While still on the title screen type in  TUESDAY 14TH  and when you
        press the fire to start the game you will be presented with an options
        screen that will allow you to obtain infinite lives, etc.
