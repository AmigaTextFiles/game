ANTEP:

        Go to the nearest town and offer your items for sale.  When asked
        which items you should attempt to sell press '1-5'.  These items
        are non-existant, but the shopkeeper give you lots of gold.  Repeat
        this as many time as you like.  Don't hit any number above 5 or the
        game will crash.
