                              SOLUTION 


      © 1992 Erik Futtrup, Denmark and Twan Lintermans, Holland


It is quite difficult to write a specific solution to this great
adventure, but I have listed things to RECORD in each decade. I
have also listed where the persons are in complex on the first
day, so you know where to find them if you have any questions to
them (you can ask Perelman about a lot of people and things eg.
plan, Perelman, Esther, my name, Randu, Vera)
