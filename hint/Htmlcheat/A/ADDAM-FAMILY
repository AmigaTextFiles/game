        To get 4 free lives each time your game is over, walk past the
        continue door to the left and there is a room where you can collect
        them.

        In the hall of rooms, walk left until there is a door above you.
        Push up to enter a secret room; collect all the stuff in this room
        and go to the enter the other secret room in this room.

 For Morticia, use the 3rd power-up code, go to the piano room and wait
 for the Addams Family music to play. Now open the self sealed door and
 finish the last level.

 Cheat Mode:

 When you begin, in front of Gomez's house, go to the left and climb the
 noose, there you will find a hat that will allow you to fly.

 You may fly down into Gomez's Chimneys, there you will find extra lives
 and many $ signs..

 In the house there are several DOORS, if you go into the VERY TOP door
then as you get past the level, past the various cannons, and blades, there
comes the LAST door, you know, the LEVEL DOOR.  WEll DONT go in there!  Jump
above it (on top of) and push UP. It will open a new secret door, IN here,
you will see below you many riches.. well to get them, go in front of
the door on the right, by the hinges, and jump up, till you get on top of
theglowing border, then go either to the left or the right and jump off..
you
will collect several thousands in bonus, and you will get some other stuff.
To get back up, simply stand under the door on the right and jump.
Then go into the door (on the right.) (it is a "warp zone") --HERE it gets
tricky.. go into the door, THEN GO INTO THE NEXT DOOR!! In other words,
thereyou are.. in front of the door on the right, you go in, then you are in
front of a door in another area, well go RIGHT BACK IN.. this will put you in
a variable BONUS room...
Get the money, then go to the FAR RIGHT wall where the "blade spitter" was..
then while pushing UP, JUMP UP. Then go into the door
on the right. (after you climb to the top (in the wall)). ok, now you are in
a room with a couple blade thingys swinging.. well walk off the wall, and
then go UNDER The door (in the wall, there is another bonus area).... (you
will be going to the left)  ok, now as you guessed, complete this area, by
going all the way to the right, then DONT GO IN THE DOOR.. jump on top of
it,there you will find another door if you push the joystick UP. If you dont
get all the money, and the life, then jump on top of the door to the right,
and then you can walk through that wall and get the stuff you missed.
 NOW go into the door, and then go in the door that we used to go to the
warpzone.. complete the area.. (this is the main guy).. Password is K1Y1H.
(easy to kill this guy... just jump on him.) But you arent done YET! Go into
the "tube" that the kid was standing on.. and you will find a nice
profitable DROP!!
