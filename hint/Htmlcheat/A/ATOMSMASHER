ATOMSMASHER:

        Type 'CATHERINE ZETA JONES' on the titlescreen and it'll say
        {Ready}.  Now start the game as normal and try pressing the
        following keys:

                'S'_________________________________Skip levels.
                'L'_____________Toggle infinite lives on or off.
                'I'____________Toggle invulnerability on or off.

                                (LEVEL EDITOR)

        Type 'ZANDALEE' for the level editor.  Here is how it works:

                 'ESC'__________________Return to the main menu.
                 'DEL'________Totally clears the selected depth.
                 'M'___Toggle between "block" and "baddie" mode.
                 'G'______________toggles graphic style through.
                 Metal, Rock, Snow, Brick and Crypton (Use on depth 2).

                 '[' & ']'_______Toggle through existing levels.
                 'F1'_____________Play level in one player mode.
                 'F2'_____________Play level in two player mode.

                               (DESIGNING A MAZE)

        Each level consists of 3 layers, and pressing 'D' will go through
        them.  Depth 0 is where the backgrounds are designed, depth 1 is
        where the ice, mud and mines go, and depth 2 is where you actually
        design the maze. On depth 2, pressing the 'SPACEBAR' takes you to
        the block select screen, where you can select any block by pressing
        the fire button on your joystick.  This then puts you in {block}
        mode (which appears at the bottom right of the screen) where you
        can place the block by pressing fire again.

                              (PLACING CHARACTERS)

        Select depth 2 and press 'M' to go into "baddie" mode. Position
        both players by pressing '1' and '2' at the desired position.  You
        can toggle through the baddies using the comma ',' and full-stop
        '.' keys, and can place them using fire, or replace existing
        baddies by first selecting the space, and then adding your
        preference.  Baddie characteristics can be changed by placing the
        cursor over it and then using the arrow keys:

                'Up'_____________________Increase baddie speed.
                'left'__Decrease rate the baddies drop hazards.
                'Right'_Increase rate the baddies drop hazards.
                      (from 01 (fastest) to 99 (slowest)
                     (00 means it'll never drop anything)
                'Down'_______________Increase drop speed by 10.
        Pressing '9' will change the speed at which the baddies will then
        appear.  Once you've placed all the initial baddies, pressing
        'RETURN' takes you onto the "que" screen, where you can place up to
        50 replensished ones.  Pressing '0' will change the time between
        these baddies appearing.  Any new levels can now be saved on a
        blank disk by returning to the main menu and selecting the save
        option.
