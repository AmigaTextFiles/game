APB:

       Type ALF into the hi-score table for infinite demerits.

       If you hold down the button while driving, the siren will sound,
       and the other cars will move out of the way. Now you can drive at
       full speed without crashing.
       If you press the fire button and push forward on your joystick while
       the music is playing, you can start playing the game on any of the
       16 levels!!
