MICROCOSM CD32:

        1. There are two introduction sequences available, depending whether
           you hit the RED or GREEN button.

        2. It seems that Psygnosis has put some music on the CD not used in
           MICROCOSM.  Just try track 2 from the game CD on your audio CD
           player.

        3. Sometimes you need to warp back to a junction because you took
           the wrong branch or because of an endless loop you are flying in.
           Just move to the map and place the outlined rectangle to the red
           mark you want to warp to (place it with the YELLOW or BLUE button).
           To actually warp press the GREEN button while you are on the map.
           
        4. Press PAUSE after the game started and try the 4 colored buttons.
           If you hear a higher tone you hit the first button in one of the
           following combinations, now press the remaining buttons.

            GREEN, BLUE, YELLOW, RED, YELLOW, DOWN, GREEN, RIGHT, RED, UP

            or

            RED, GREEN, BLUE, YELLOW, DOWN, DOWN, BLUE, DOWN, RIGHT, BLUE

            or

            YELLOW, RED, GREEN, BLUE, UP, LEFT

            or

            BLUE, YELLOW, RED, GREEN, BLUE, LEFT

           You will hear some sound and from now on your life never ends
           and you have access to the right brain with all weapons
           available, but all rendered sequences will appear grey shaded
           only.

           When  you  are  walking  into the pod base, try pressing the LEFT
           button  and keep it pressed until you arrive at the crossway..
           now all the maps' level are upside-down..
