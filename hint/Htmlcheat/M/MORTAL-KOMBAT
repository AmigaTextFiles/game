MORTAL KOMBAT:

        On the screen where you select to start the game or options, type
        "CATHULU" and the new selection {CHEATMODE} will appear.  Enter the
        cheat menu and type "RJC" and a statistics screen will appear, press
        'SPACE' to return to selection menu.
        
        On the screen that tells you about {CODES}, type "VAMPIRE" the words
        will turn white and you should hear a sound.  This will turn off the
        blood (WHY!!).
