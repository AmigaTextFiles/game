MIGHT & MAGIC III:

        Enter "DOE MEISTER" at any Mirror Portal in order to be transported
        to a Secret Room in Dragon Cavern.  The room contains a vast and
        secret hoard of gold which belonged to dragons long dead.  Use
        Lloyd's Beacon or Mr. Wizard to leave the secret room, or perish in
        an eternal trap.

        Enter "ORB MEISTER" at any Mirror Portal to enter the twisting
        passages beneath the pyramids where you can obtain a King's Ultimate
        Power Orb.  Grateful kings offer much experience for the return of
        such orbs.

        Enter "BLASTOFF" at any mirror Portal to view the award-winning End
        Game sequence, after which you may restart the game and continue
        your adventures throughout the Isles of Terra.
