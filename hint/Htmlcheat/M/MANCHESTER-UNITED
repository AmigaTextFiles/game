MANCHESTER UNITED:
            
        If you're losing a game, whilst playing simply press the appropriate
        key to start a two player game and the other team should freeze
        letting you win kind of easily.

        When you concede a penalty push the joystick up and keep the button
        pressed down and your goalie will always save it.

        During play press 'CTRL' and 'ESC' simultaneously to loose with 5-0.
