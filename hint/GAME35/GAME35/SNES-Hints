                             SUPER NINTENDO
            GAME CHEATS, PASSWORDS & LEVEL CODES ( Dec 26, 1992 )

     The following list of Super Nintendo game cheats and level codes for
70 games was complied from an initial file by the Console Brotherhood and 
expanded by me by typing in magazine and Nintendo Player's Guide information.
Then before this file was released, a file on the Internet system maintained
by Robert Deloura appeared. I then incorporated some of his hints in my file.
I assume for the foreseeable future that these cheat files for both the SNES
and Sega Genesis will be a collaboration and other will contribute. 
	I expect that eventually as more games are released, the file will 
become a small book. Already it is 2790 lines (@ 66 lines per page = 42 pgs).
I've listed below the magazines that were used for this file so that readers
with other issues or missing magazines can add to this file. Feel free to add
to this file, but if you do list your changes in the section below. And for 
those who are too lazy to type in the cheats, mail Xerox's of magazine cheats
(Genesis pages too for a similar cheat file) to the address listed below. 
I will type them in.
     One final note. Sometimes you will see a set of passwords that doesn't
work on your version of the game. Remember that in many cases there is a
Japanese version of the game. Since I didn't start this file, it is quite
possible that some of the hints in this file are not for the USA version.
Also since I don't own most of these games, I haven't verified these cheats.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

ACTRAISER
=========
Special Mode - To play only the action scenes all you have to do is finish
the game once and then if you move the cursor down at the title screen the
words SPECIAL MODE will appear.  Hit START and you will be able to play
thru only the action scenes without going into the creation mode.

Professional Mode - After completing the game, and your back on the title
screen, pressUp (or Down twice).  The "Professional" selection will appear 
below "New Game". You don't get any magic, and regular monsters take twice
as many hits to kill.

Hidden 1-Ups - There are 1-Ups hidden in the area of Bloodpool and Kasandora.
You can make them surface by controlling the elements. Create a rain shower
in the woods that are located northeast of the lake in Bloodpool. After the
storm, the villagers will uncover an artifact which they will offer to you.
This Source of Life will work as a 1-Up, giving you an extra chance to fight
off the forces of evil. You'll also dig up a Source of Life in Kasandora.
Once you've washed away the sand in the north and uncovered a pyramid, create
an earthquake. The walls of the pyramid will collapse and reveal this life-
giving treasure. The third one is collected by striking the Northwood temple
with lightning.

ADDAMS FAMILY
=============
Passwords - These passwords take you inside the Addams' mansion to help
find the missing family.

Start with only Morticia missing - BLKX8
   You will begin with everyone saved but Morticia. You'll also have five
   full hearts and 72 men. Begin the Trek in the Music Room. When Lurch
   finishes playing piano, the blocks around the door disappear and you will
   be able to enter the basement.

Start with Pugsley free - BZYXC
   You begin with Pugsley free and five hearts. Granny is the next family
   member in line for rescue, so start your search in the kitchen.

Start with Granny rescued - BDSXY
   You'll begin with Granny rescued and 72 men. Begin your search for
   Fester in the Portrait Gallery.

When you get a password after saving a family member or earning a heart,
reset the game and collect replenished 1 -UPs. You can carry up to 99 men
in reserve.

Incredible Codes:

   B&1&B  - 5 hearts, 80 lives and Granny & Pugsley rescued.
   71117  - 100 lives, 3 hearts and a sword.
   W111W  - 100 lives, 4 hearts and a sword.
   21112  - 100 lives, 5 hearts and a sword.

Secret Sites - Stand in the lower left corner of the Hall of Stairs (you will
be past the last door to the left). Push UP and there will be a secret door
that lead's to Pugsley's Den. Go through the 2nd secret door and you will be
"Behind the Stairs."
More 1-Ups are in the bear's mouth in the Lower Gallery. Walk into the mouth
shown at the right.
In the Portrait Gallery there are three 1-Ups, a Heart and a Baseball hidden
out of sight. When you reach the Lower Gallery, you'll find a bear rug that,
unlike the others, doesn't produce small bears. If you crawl into the mouth
of the bear, you'll be able to collect these elusive items

1-Up Room - After you have lost all of your lives playing the game, you can
earn more lives by stepping into a hidden room. There are two doors on the
Game Over screen. Walk off the left edge of the screen before you open either
of them and you'll end up in a hidden area that contains four floating 1-Ups.
Collect these valuable items and return to the previous screen. Open the
Continue door and move on with four additional lives in reserve.

Snap Along - The classic Addams Family theme which opens the game has the
sound of snaping fingers. During the music you can trigger the finger snaps
by pressing the L and R Buttons.

ARCANA
======
Stage or Chapter Select - Enter the following code when the START/CONTINUE 
title screen appaears. Press down Select, Select, X, Y, Select, Select,
L, R, Select, Select, left, right, up. Then choose the chapter with the
following keys: A - Stage 2,  B - Stage 3,  X - Stage 4,  Y - Stage 5.

Sound Room - To enter the Sound Room, on the title screen, hold L,R and B
buttons then push start.


BART'S NIGHTMARE
================
Easy 1-Ups - Choose the yellow door to enter the Itchy & Scratchy level. Once
you're inside, go to the area where the lamp is shooting out light bulbs.
Grab the weapon next to the lamp and blow away some bulbs. The first few
bulbs destroyed will give you 1-Ups.


BIG RUN
=======
Option Mode  - There is a way to adjust the game play in this intense
driver.  To set the controller how you want it just press SELECT at the
title screen.


BO JACKSON BASEBALL
===================
All Bo Squad - An entire squad of Bo Jackson's can play on any of the teams
in the game when you enter an easy code. After you have choosen your squad,
a team roster will appear. At that time, press Left on your Control Pad and
the Select and B buttons all at the same time. Every player on your team will
be replaced by Bo. This will make your team extremely tough to beat since 
Bo's video batting average is 3.99 and his Earned Run Average (as a pitcher)
is 1.53.

CAMELTRY
========
Sound test - Go to the passwords menu and enter the following code:  ZTT

Changing ball-type - Go to the passwords menu and enter: TYPE
You will be given a menu of several different ball-types that the game can 
be played with.


CASTLEVANIA IV
==============
Secret Passwords - These passcodes will let you reach all of the levels and
for the final boss, Dracula.  Do NOT enter any name on the password screen.
H is heart.  A is axe.  P is potion.  A "-" is a space.

   -A--       PP--       HP--       AP--       HH--       -HA-

Bonus Rooms - There are Bonus Rooms in levels 3-1, 6-2 and 9-2.  Many power
ups are in these rooms. For example on level 3-1, look for a double row of
bricks. Use the whip. Also on that stage you'll work your way to the right
then begin to descend into another big area. As you are climbing down, you'll
notice a column-like wall to the left. If you hit it with your whip, this
wall will give way and reveal a Candlestick-filled area. Hit the candlesticks
for bonuses.
There are several crashing chandliers in Stage 6-2. On your approach to the
third chandlier, hit the floor with your whip, straight down. One of the
rocks on the ground will disappear to reveal a stairway to another bonus
area.
Stage 9-2 is full of very strong magnetic rocks. You'll come to one of these
rocks on a platform with a stairway on either side.. Climb the platform and
stand next to the rock. Then, when the magnetic power of the rock is
temporarily gone, jumb to the next platform. You'll be mysteriously sent to
another bonus area for a short time. Hit as many Candlesticks as you can and
collect items that fall before you're sent back.

Invisible Staircase - On the level right before Dracuala there is a stair
case leading into his domain.  There is also a massive drop from the
platform into the depths of the unknown.  Luckily things are not what they
seem.  If you take a large jump off the edge of the platform you will find
yourself on an invisible ledge that will lead down some stairs going to the
left.  Go as far as you can to the left and power-ups will fall in large
quantities.  Collect 99 hearts, a triple boomerang and the best whip.  Be
careful not to fall off the edge when going back.


CONTRA 3
========

Double Weapon - You will need a rapid fire control pad to do this trick.
First, start the game and put the rapid fire on the X button. You will see
the weapons at the top of the screen change back and forth very rapidly.
Once you get two weapons, you will see that you can use both of them at the
same time. The flame thrower weapon will not work with this trick.

Extra 1-Ups - There are two locations on Stage 1 where you can stand still
and earn extra points and 1-Ups effortlessly. You'll find a futuristic
vehicle just past the mission starting point. Instead of blasting apart the
cool car, you can jump over it and use it to shield your fighter from attacks
from the left side. Keep firing to the right and let the neemies run into
your blasts. You'll earn enough points for a 1-Up every few minutes. If you
leave this safe point and battle on, you'll eventually earn homing missiles.
Take them to the next higher platform, out of the way of activity on the
ground, and use them to balst all of the enemies that come into range.
It will take quite some time to build large number of 1-Ups using this 
technique. In situations like this, you can wrap a rubber band around the 
controller so that there is a constant pressure on the Y button. Then you'll
be free to walk away and let your fighter rack up the points on his own. In
the highest difficulty mode, you should be able to build up the maximum of
29 fighters in reserve in a few hours. If you do this you might want to turn
off your monitor so that the static image won't burn into it.


DARIUS TWIN
===========
49 Extra Ships - First make sure controller 2 is plugged in.  In the screen
where you select one, two players or option, just hold the L and R buttons
on the second controller, press SELECT and START on the first controller.
Before you do this, you may choose to grant one or two players with 49
lives each.

Safe Spot - Get the high score and enter your initials as ZZT. Wait for the
demo and there will be no enemies when your ships appear.

FINAL FANTASY II
================

General Combat Advice:
  Never underestimate the value of casting BESRK and FAST on a character who
  inflicts a lot of hand-to-hand damage. Especially against bosses. Just
  don't let him get CHARMED.  :-)

You can safely cast CALL spells on a WALLed creature.
  Failing this, cast WALL on a party member, and bounce the offensive spells
  off his WALL onto your opponent. Spells only bounce once, thus will not
  reflect back in your face when you do this.

Rydia (your Caller) learns Meteo at level 60.

  Some very rare items can be found by killing certain sets of monsters, and
  getting very lucky. Supposedly POWER ARMOR is sometimes awarded as treasure
  if you defeat a pair of Behemoths. I've received an odd magical item that
  is just called "IMP", and seems to be unusable. I got it by killing two
  Imps and a Swordrat in the Misty Cave. I have no idea what it does(do you?).
  (If you know how to get any other odd items, please let me know and I'll
  list the information here.)

How to beat the Queen in the Land of Summoned Monsters:
  The difficulty in defeating the Queen is that she keeps curing herself.
  To defeat any enemy which does this, as soon as possible, cast WALL on
  the enemy so that attempts to CURE self will reflect to someone in your
  party. Remember, once you WALL the Queen (or any enemy) DO NOT cast
  destructive magic spells on her, unless they are Caller spells.

How to beat the King in the Land of Summoned Monsters:
  Brute force. Nothing special. If you can't beat him, go get tougher and
  come back.  Having some things to DART at him will help. Make sure to use
  group Cure3 or Cure4 spells.

How to beat Odin:
  Call LEVIA against him, but otherwise just use brute force. Lightning 
  attacks seem to bring his wrath down upon you much more quickly than 
  necessary.
  (It's suspected that the Odin spell fails against monsters with more than a
  certain number of hit points. If you know for sure, please let me know.)

How to beat Bahamut:
  Call LEVIA against him, cast WHITE against him, DART Ninja Stars at him.

Methods for defeating Zeromus (the final boss):
  (Combined suggestions from several people)
  Beware, Zeromus tends to lash out with very powerful spells if you attack
  him with NUKE or WHITE.


  Paladin:  Attack, attack, attack....
  Ninja:    Automatically attacks with Berserk for a while, then Dart Ninja
            Stars.
  Wh Wiz:   Cast group-Cure4 every round. (Berserk the Ninja after the
            Paladin uses the Crystal.)
  Bl Wiz:   Call Baham every round.
  Dragoon:  Jump every round unless he needs healing, in which case Attack.


  Kain ( Dragoon )      : Jump w/ White spear
  Rydia ( Caller )      : Bahamut, Bahamut, Bahamut
  Cecil ( Paladin )     : Attack, Use Elixir, repeat
  Rosa ( White Wizard ) : White Spell
  Edge ( Ninja )        : "Dart" Excalibur, "Dart" Ninja stars


  Cecil:  Straight ahead fight.
  Kain:   Jump attack
  Rydia:  Call Levia.  Call Asura instead, if needed.
  Rosa:   Cast "Besrk" on Edge after Crystal used.
          Cast "Life2" and "Cure4" the rest of the time.
  Edge:   Fights on "autopilot" ("Besrk") for a bit.  Then "Dart" anything you
          can.  If you run out of things to "Dart", Fight.


  Cecil:  Attack, attack, attack....
  Rydia:  Nuke, Nuke, Nuke....
  Kain:   Jump, Jump, Jump....
  Rosa:   Cure4, Cure4, Cure4....
          Life2 on Cecil or Rydia if they die.
  Edge:   Dart, Dart, Dart....


FINAL FIGHT
===========
Extra Fighters - On the title screen, press and hold the L button, then press
the START button. The "Option Mode" screen will appear. Press UP and DOWN on
the control pad to highlight the options and press the X button to change the
settings. Lower difficulty settings will make the game easier, and additional
players adds to your men in reserve. The extend option adjusts the 1-Up
awards for points earned. Use R button to play music and sound effects.


F-ZERO
======
Gain Lap Time - In Port Town II, there is a way to get ahead of the
competition!  Get a Super Jet, then head to the left after passing the
finish line.  Activate the Super Jet just before you get to the jump ramp
and quickly angle to the right to fly to the opposite side of the track.

Master Level - If you complete all five tracks in a grand prix at the expert
level, you will be given the opportunity to race at Master Level.

Getting an Early Lead - Unless you drive the Golden Fox (yellow car), you can
always get an initial speed increase by using the quick start (hold down the
accelerator to full before start) and leaning to the right. By moving into
the next car's "lane" you can force him to hit you from behind giving you a 
good push. If you use the Fire Stingray (Pink), you can do this twice, first
Blue Falcon will hit you then moving a little farther right, Wild Goose 
(Green) will hit you. This initial 2nd place position will enable you to 
take the lead rather quickly (beginner and standard levels).


F1-ROC
======
Extra Money - To get $10,000 instead of the original $500 that you normally
start the game with, go to the screen where you enter your name and put in
SETAUSA. When you get to the parts configuration screen, you can buy nearly
anything you want. Get the best engine.

Discover Hidden Course - Choose "Start" on the title screen. Get past the
player select screen and choose "Training" in the Config screen. When the
course screen comes up, highlight and choose the MONACO course. While you
are racing, look carefully for a body of water that comes to a point between
two gray barriers. Once you find this, get up to top speed (turn around and
come back if necessary) and head for the water (try to enter it exactly at
the point). If you place your car just right, you will be able to run your
car on the water without falling in. Search for a significant opening from

to a new course that is not even on the map.

Bonus Stages - There are bonus stages in levels 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7.
Most bonus stages require that you meet some condition and then fly into
a seemingly solid area to enter the bonus area.  The conditions and
areas are described below.

  Level 2 - (condition: none), fly into the first ship opening along
            the bottom of the screen in the last section of the stage
            before meeting the boss (area after the giant carbonated
            bubbles).
  Level 3 - (condition: must have destroyed all of the guns on the
            ground), fly up close to the low rock ceiling toward the
            end of the level right before the last "mountain".
  Level 4 - (condition: must have no power-up boxes lit at bottom of
            screen), fly into the back of the Moai head located in
            the middle of 3 heads toward the end of the level.  This
            particular head will be facing away from you and all 3
            heads are upright - difficult to explain location w/o
            picture).
  Level 5 - (condition: unknown), fly through the fire at the corner
            of the inverted volcano just before the small passage
            which leads to the 2-headed fire dragon.
  Level 7 - (condition: unknown), fly through low corner just after
            the 4 turrets where your ship would normally have to
            cut diagonally upward.


Bonus Stages - You'll find several hidden bonus areas in Stages 2, 3 and 4
by soaring into seamingly solid areas, and in the cases of Stages 3 and 4,
meeting several conditions. The entrance to the bonus area in Stage 2 is at
the bottom of the screen. When you fly into the section that is lined with a
blue, liquid substance, look for a hole and dive into it. You'll appear in
an area that is filled with breakable pink orbs. Clear them away and you will
discover several point producing devices.
The condition upon entering bonus area in Stage 3 is that you must destroy all
of the guns on the ground. Fly up close to the low rock ceiling, and you will
make your way into a bonus area.
A Moai Statue proves to be the bonus area entrance in Stage 4. Make sure that
none of the Power-Ups are highlighted on the bar at the bottom of the screen
and soar into the back of the Moai which is leaning backwards.

transported inside the dinosaur without having to go through the stage and
fight him all over again.

are from Nintendo's Top Secret Player's Guide. ^=triangele

Extra Supplies Code - First, start off the code by typing in the following
password on the "Logbook Entry" screen.

   ?

This code will NOT work, which is the purpose of it. Then, without deleting
the non-functional password, back up to the very beginning of the page using
the arrowas at the bottom of the screen. Now type in the following password
over the previous one.

   rzT$> L1>X9 q+TD^
   ZR>?? q/>zD >^h>z

This will now start you off at level 9, but only Kid Ying will be on the
screen. Press the A button on controller 2 and you will now see that Dr. Yang
is now powered-up. You should have no trouble winning now.

Free Magic - You can obtain free magic if you go to the fairy that is hidden
in the waterfall near the entrance to Zora's waterfall. When you go up to
the pond, throw in an empty bottle. She will return it and when she does, it
will be filled with magic.

Hidden Rooms - There are hidden rooms in many stages in the game. You'll
find them by hitting walls and obstacles. If you strike the right spots,
passages will appear leading to Power-Up filled chambers.
Zone One - Hit the wall just right of the Hara Temple entrance to make the
$100 head appear.
Zone Two - Hit the far side of the bridge (one of the pier columns) to make
another special gift appear.
Zone Three Start - Hit the right side of the Amusement Park entrance for a
$100 lollipop.
Zone Three End - Take a spipe at the right side of the bridge for a prize.

In Warlock Zones there are four item-packed secret areas. You can open the
entrances of these hidden rooms by hitting certain obstacles with your
weapon.
In Warlock Zone I, there's a stone marker directly below the big bell. Hit
the marker and it will move to reveal a hole. When you dive into the hole,
you'll land in a room full of rocks and special items. If you're equipped
with at least three pairs of Straw Sandals, you'll be able to jump over the
rocks and collect the items.
In Warlock Zone II, you'll find a locked door just to the East of the sauna.
If you break it open with your weapon and walk in, you'll discover another
item hidaway.
There are secret areas in Warlock Zones IV and VI which you can discover by
hitting certain walls in the villages. The hidden entrance in Zone IV is on
the side of the house and the hidden entrance in Zone VI is between two
stacks of boxes.

Bonus Stages - Get to the bonus stages by accomplishing special maneuvers
on the Rocketbelt and Parachute rounds.  Ignore the rings and other
objectives in these rounds and maneuver your character over the moving
platform in each level.  If you can land on this portion of the target
area, you will be taken to the bonus stage with a perfect rating of 100
points!  When you are using the Rocketbelt and get this bonus, you will
be transformed into a winged man!  While in this special mode, try to
jump onto the trampolines and hit the power P's before landing in the
middle of the target.  When you enter the bonus stage in the parachute
rounds, you transform into a penguin who must high dive into a multi-
point pool!  The waters are separated by ropes which each designate
different extra point values.

HINTS on Landing on Moving Platforms:

  To land on moving platform with the parachute (level one):
        Immediately rotate 90 degrees right when released (ignore rings).
        Hold position until 630-40 feet, at which time pull rip-cord and
        then pull a quick u-turn (180 degrees). At 225 feet, rotate 90
        degrees right and line up with the moving platform track. When you
        reach the track the platform should pass underneath you and then
        return underneath you (traveling the same direction as you) -- As
        soon as you see it flare and hold.

  To land in the water target with the hang-glider:
        Hit thermal and wait till the glider levels out. Push up (dive)
        and right, drop to 150 feet, pull up and line up with the target.
        Obtain level flight and flare repeatedly just before the shadow
        hits the bottom edge of the target (not much, you should be no 
        higher than 25 feet).

  To land on the moving platform with the rocket-pack:
        Practice using the low burner and holding at 10 feet. Then
        practice stabilizing your position after moving forward (tricky).
        Complete the course and stabilize yourself over the platform's path
        in a place where you can see it approaching (at a corner or end of
        the 'track'). Drop like a rock the moment the edge of the platform
        hits your shadow.

PRINCE OF PERSIA
================
To Change the Music While Playing - start a normal game, hit the START button
and hold it down, while doing this, press SELECT. You will then be presented
with a menu with 10 different level song selections. Up to 33 tunes can be
selected by scrolling the cursor past the 10th selection. Use the joystick
to select the song you wish to hear and press A or B to start the song and
continue playing. This song test is kind of a pain, beacuse each time you
want to change songs, you have to do the same thing over again.

RANMA 1/2
=========
To play against the computer using ANY of the characters just press BOTH
the R and L buttons while pressing START.

I'm going to use different spellings for the character names here, because
the ones used on the cart annoy me.  (I'm a big fan of the animated show.)

        CART SAYS               I SAY
        Ryohga                  Ryouga
        Kohchoh                 Kouchou
        Happy                   Happosai
        Kunoh                   Kunou
        Colon                   Cologne

Debug Mode - ATS, hold L and R down, and then press Start. Keep holding
L and R.  A list of options should appear, and now you can release L and
R.  You can use this to set up any fight combination you'd like -- any
character vs any character, run by your choice of human or computer.  Even
computer vs computer, if you'd like. However, the computer doesn't know how
to fight as Happosai or Cologne, so if you pick a computer-controlled
version of either, it'll just stand there and let you beat on it. You
can also play around with the strength of the characters from this menu.
If you hit SELECT, the background will change. Whatever background is
on the menu when you hit START will be the background you'll fight on.
There are easier ways to play char-vs-char and such, so read on....

Playing as Someone Other than Ranma in 1-player Mode - hold L and R down
on Controller 1, and you can push Left and Right to pick any normal
character that you'd like (not Happosai or Cologne, though). You can
change characters every time you see the character selection screen (you
aren't stuck with the same character against each opponent). You can also
use this to allow Player 1 to be a non-Ranma character in Duel mode
(player-vs-player). See the next hint if you want to be the same character
as your opponent (in either mode), though....

Playing as the Same Character as your opponent - the person on Controller
1 must hold down L and R (boy, that sounds familiar) when you hit a button
to start the match. If you don't do this, the game will beep at you as
if your choice of match-up was illegal.

Other Difficulty Levels - From the options screen, press L, then R, then
SELECT. There will now be two more difficulty levels you can scroll
through, in red text.  One seems just a bit harder than EASY, the other
just a bit easier than SUPER.

General Computer Advice - Play Ranma-chan. Half the characters are easily
defeatable by waiting in defensive crouch for them to jump in on you, then
quickly standing and doing your A-button special attack. (Genma, Ryouga,
and usually Shampoo). Defeat Kouchou by luring him into throwing a
pineapple and double-jumping over it (don't jumpkick him) to throw him.
Kunou is a sucker for repeated throws (throw him, rush over to him while
he's getting up and throw him again as he stands, repeat), all you have to
do is get in on him *one* time.  


RIVAL TURF
==========
Change character names - first, you have to play through the first level
and get the high score of that game.  When you are asked to enter your
name, enter CHRCONF as your name and you will be brought to the character
configuration screen that will allow you to alter the names of the
characters in the game.  Once you are finished, just press START for a game
with your new characters.


ROCKETEER
=========

Stage Select - When the title screen appears, showing the Rocketeer in the
heroic pose, key in the following code: L, R, L, R, Down. You'll hear a
metalic sound. After you select the number of players that will participate,
the Select Starting Round screen will appear. That is your cue to skip to
any of the game's eight stages.

SIMCITY
=======
Bonus Gift Trick - Pick a land with plenty of water in it, but do not pick
an island.  Make sure you pick a land with water near the middle.  Now,
create roads, find the middle of the land and make a cross with these roads
all the way to the edge of the map of you land.  Do not connect the cross
in the middle of the water, or the trick will not work.  Once you make a
cross with these roads near a body of water, you will be able to build
anywhere from two to five casinos or amusement parks!

More Maps - Select "Start New City" on the menu screen, then choose any map
number between 1 and 999.  "Ok" the map you want. Go into the map and
choose the "Go to Menu" icon at the top of the screen.  Do NOT save this.
Choose "Start New City" again on the menu screen.  Wait, and the same map
that you chose earlier will turn out to be a different map with the same
number!  This works all the way from map 1 to 999, giving you a total for
1998 instead of the regular 999.

Raise Your Treasury to $999,999.00 - Get into a situation where your cash is
near zero and you cannot give 100% to the Transit, Police and Fire 
Departments, then do the following   procedure only WHEN THE TAX SCREEN 
APPEARS AT THE END OF THE FISCAL YEAR!

  1. Hold the LEFT and RIGHT Buttons on the top of the controller
     DO NOT RELEASE EITHER BUTTON UNTIL THE PROCEDURE IS COMPLETE
  2. Select "Go with these figures"
  3. Exit back to the Building Screen
  4. Select the Taxes Menu
  5. Increase Transit, Police and Fire to 100%, bringing your cash
     flow to a negative number
  6. Select "Go with these figures"
  7. Return to Building Screen
  8. When you release the LEFT and RIGHT buttons the cash amount will
     change to 999999

Bingo!  A million bucks to work with.  You can almost never use it all up.
But if you do run out of money just repeat the procedure. It works every time.

One word of advice.  Do not use the procedure until you have acquired
the Bank.  The Commercial Zones which surround a Bank usually become
C-Tops quickly, so having the Bank is worth the wait.  The Bank is
acquired when your have a population of 10000 people and less than $2000, 
if I recall properly.  What I do is play normally until I acquire the 
Bank, then build Police or Fire Stations until I run out of money.  Then
wait for the fiscal year to end and do the procedure.

Please note that this procedure only seems to work at the end of the
fiscal year and the tax screen must come up automatically or is does not
work.

More Money - The first step is to spend all of your cash before the end of
the year. The city's account will have to be completely empty, and at least
some of the money will have to be spent on something that requires funding.
When the tax screen appears at the year's end, press and hold the L Button.
Then while you are still holding the L button, go back to the main game and
access the tax screen again. You'll notice the message "Go With The Figures"
has changed to Gro With The Figures". Raise all your funding levels to 100%
and exit the screen. When you release the L Button and your citizens attempt
to spend any money, your account will rise to an amazing $999,999! That will
be enough money to build your dreaam city.

Down Sizing - Airports, Harbors and Stadiums take up a lot of room. There is
a way to decrease the size of these public facilities without decreasing 
their effectiveness. When you see an airplane flying over an Airport, Harbor
or Stadium, quickly select the disaster icon and choose an airplane crash.
The plane will go down on the targeted building and the fire will burn most
of it to ashes. As long as one small section of the building remains intact,
the facility will continue to be as effective as it was in the orginal form.

Free Coverage - Whenever you load a saved game, the fire, police and
transportation departments give you a break by requesting no funds until the
beginning of the next game year. You can take advantage of this situation
by using your funds for expansion, rather than maintenance. As soon as you
have worked out your budget at the end of every year, save your game, then
immediately reload it so you can continue playing. When you click on your
Tax Icon, you will see that your police, fire and transportation coverage
will be taken care of. Thus you can lower your tax rate and more people will
flock to your city.

BONUSES - What follows is the gifts and the conditions that you must meet
to recieve them. You are awarded the mayor's house once your village has
developed into a town of 2000 citizens.

Bank - The Sim City Savings & Loan is offered to you after you have a full-
fledged city of 10,000 citizens and less than $2000 in your city treasury.
You can borrow $10,000 from the bank and pay off your loan over a 21 year
period. By the way, even if you bulldoze the bank, you still have to pay off
the loan.
Zoo - The children of your city will have a place to view exotic wildlife
once you have a population of over 10,000 and you build a stadium. You will
be offered another zoo when you have built three stadiums.
Police and Fire HQ - You'll be rewarded with special crime or fire fighting
centers when you have built six police stations or six fire stations. These
facilities provide better protection over a wider area. You can have a maximum
of three each of these buildings.
Windmill - When 150 zones in your city are developed, your sister city in
Holland sends you a windmill which will promote growth wherever it's placed.
Another windmill will be sent when 500 zones are developed.
Library - A library will be added to your city once three schools have been
built. You can promote the construction of schools by creating nice, well
maintained residential neighborhoods.
Large Park - Each large park (as many as three) is offered to your city with
an additional construction of 300 park spaces.
Railroad Station - When you lay 50 sections of track, you will be able to set
up a station to manage the comings and goings of your busy rail lines.
Another will be offered once 200 sections of track are laid.
Expo - There is nothing that helps put your city on the map more than an
international exposition. If you have a capitol (50,000 citizens, an airport,
and a harbor, you'll be offered an opportunity to hold an expo in your city.
Fountain - You'll be offered a fountain to commemorrate the 50th year of
your city. It will help increase property values in the immediate area.
Landfill - When space begins to get tight and you have nowhere to expand, you
will be periodically rewarded with zone-sized sections of landfill. These
occur when you have 150, 100, 50 and 30 zones that are undeveloped. 


SKULJAGGER
==========
Clues On-Line - Wit's name is actually R.L. Wright and is also a code name
for a sequence of commands to do on the conroller. When you see the island
and the text at the start of each chapter, press the following buttons in
this order: R button, L button, R button. A secret text paragraph will be
revealed that will give you clues for certain levels.


SMART BALL
==========
Level Jump - Once the title screen appears, wait for it to tell you to push
the START button. Next enter the code as follows: UP, UP, DOWN, DOWN, LEFT,
RIGHT, LEFT, RIGHT, B, A, SELECT and then START. Now instead of having to 
start on level 1-A, you can start anywhere up to level 4-A.


SOUL BLAZER
===========

Defeat the Metallic Boss in the Painting in Area 1 -
You must defeat him without having the Zantetsu (anti-metal) sword. It can
be done -- it's just very time-consuming.  Lure him to the left, then walk
up the central ramp and hit him once as he approaches you (stay at the top
of the ramp, don't touch the platform he's confined to). Then rush back down
the ramp and lure him over to the left again. It's boring, but it works.

Location of the Master's 8 Emblems:

  Emblem A:  Use the ZANTETSU sword to kill all the metal creatures in the
             Painting in Area 1. You'll release some ivy that leads to an
             area containing the Emblem.  (walk around)
  Emblem B:  Once the soul of the man who "knows everything about Castle
             Magridd" joins you, go back into the Torture Chamber section
             of Area 6, and look around for invisible chests. One of them
             contains the Emblem.
  Emblem C:  In Area 2, the right-hand squirrel in the right-hand tree
             (the tree with the 'hungry' squirrel) will give you the Emblem.
  Emblem D:  In Area 3, you will free a sleeping dolphin who appears in the
             prison area (where Lue is being held captive). Use the Dream
             Rod on him, then equip the Great Pearl and talk to him while
             you're in his dream. Step on the monster lair he was standing
             on in the dream. Back in the real world, you should find a path
             on the west side of the area just before the final boss.  The
             path leads to an area with 4 chests, one of which contains the
             Emblem.
  Emblem E:  In Area 4, you will free a snail, into a room that doesn't
             seem to have any entrances. It has a hidden passage (it looks
             like rock, but you can walk through it) leading into it.
             From your blue transport square in the 'town', try to walk into
             the wall to the southwest of you. You'll find the path, if you
             have freed the snail. He'll give you the Emblem.
  Emblem F:  You'll find a sleeping mushroom in Area 4 (inside the punishment
             room).  Make note of where he's standing in his dream (use the
             Dream Rod). Then go back to that spot in the real world, and
             you'll find the Emblem. (It's in the action area just before
             the Boss).
  Emblem G:  In Area 5, on the first floor of Leo's house, there is a room
             in the southwest corner containing a dresser, a plant, and a
             cat. Push the dresser to the west, the Emblem is underneath.
             (I have no idea how you were supposed to realize this -- I called
             Nintendo and asked them.)
  Emblem H:  In Area 6, when you free the guard that causes the castle to be
             rebuilt (along the northern edge of the town), the Emblem will
             appear along the outer wall of the castle. From your blue
             transport square, just walk outside and go west.

Location of the three Red-Hot items for summoning the Phoenix:

  Red-Hot Ball  :  In Area 7 (the Evil World), it's inside a treasure chest.
                   You can only reach the treasure chest via the transport
                   squares -- when you've gone far enough to see the chest
                   in question, the transport square will appear, and you'll
                   be able to get to it from the temple screen.
  Red-Hot Mirror:  When you go back to Area 2 with the SPIRIT Sword and kill
                   all the floating yellow balls in the Light Temple, you'll
                   free a bird, who will appear to the west of the restaurant.
                   (You'll free more than one bird.)  When you talk to him,
                   he'll give you the Mirror.
  Red-Hot Stick :  When you go back to Area 3 with the ZANTETSU Sword and
                   kill the metal gorillas on Dorean (the volcanic island),
                   you'll free a Mermaid.  Go back and talk to her, and she'll
                   give you the Stick.

The Ending for the game continues after the end of the credits.  Wait for
about 20 seconds, and it should continue.

Extra Points: You can get a lot of XPs in the World of Evil by going to the 
transporter field that connects the next-to-last and last parts of it, 
equipping the Soul Armor, Soul Blade, and Phoenix magic, and going back and 
forth between the two sections, killing the three rotating metal walls on the
last part, then entering the red transporter square to return to the previous
section, re-entering it to return to the final section, and killing the metal
walls over again.  Repeat as desired -- they're worth 4000 xps each.

   8 - 449357    16 - 487735    24 - 845684    32 - 511588

Super Difficulty Level - To get a very difficult level of play, press SELECT
at the title screen. The options menu will appear. Now hold LEFT and DOWN on
the control pad, and then press and hold the L button and R button. With all
these held, press the SELECT button. Your car will trun grey in color. This
indicates the trick worked. You will now notice that your opponents are
smarter.


SPACE MEGAFORCE
===============
Difficulty Indicator - The last digit of the score in Space Megaforce is
usually a "0" because all of the score values are multiples of 10. You can
change that and use the last digit as an indicator of dangers to come, by
entering a quick code on the title screen. Press the Select Button twice and
hold it. The cursor should be pointing to the Options entry. Then press the
Start Button to enter the Options screen. This slight maneuver will cause a 
change in the game. When you exit the Options screen and begin the game, the
last digit of the score will be "0" as always. When you get into trickier
territory, the digit will change, indicating the level of danger in the areas
ahead. A "0" signifies the easiest area and a "7" marks the most difficult 
areas.

SPANKEY'S QUEST
===============
Level Codes - Go to the title screen and choose the password option. Enter
the following codes to advance to higher levels:

           1 - 000       4 - 116
           2 - 732       5 - 988
           3 - 354       6 - 470


STREET FIGHTER 2
================
Character vs. Same Character - This produces a fair match. As the Capcom logo
fades in, press D, R, U, L, Y, B, X, A. Make sure to get the code in before 
the logo fades. You will hear a musical tone to let you know that you got it.
You will get a blue background instead of a black one. Now Select a two 
player game. Player one and two will be able to choose the same fighter. 
Press the Start button on either of the two controllers and the corresponding
character will change in color so you tell the fighters apart. Press the A
button on the other controller to confirm your character select and begin 
fighting.
NOTE: Nintendo Power says the code is Down, R, Up, L, Y, B.

Championship Colors Mode - After the 'Licensed by Nintendo' message
disappears from the screen, but before the music for the Capcom logo fade-in
finishes, enter the following sequence on Controller #1:
             Down, R, Up, L, Y, B
If you do it correctly, you'll hear the "character select" sound effect.
If you're playing on the Super Famicom version of the cartridge, you'll
need to include X, A on the end of the sequence. When you select a
character, if you use the Start button, you'll be in Championship Edition
colors, but will not have any Championship Edition special moves. If you
use a normal button to pick your character, you'll be your original (SF2)
color. This also allows two people to fight each other as the same
character, provided that one of you is in Championship Edition colors, and
the other is not.

SUPER BATTLETANK
================
Super Bullets - There is a way to destroy your enemies with only one of your
machine gun shots. To do this, start the game and go to a place that you can
confront an enemy. Once you have an enemy in your sights, switch your weapon
to machine guns and start shooting. Once your target is hit, pause the game.
The target should be still be taking hits and will blow up. Timing is 
critical!

=====================
Level Select - At the title screen press START. You will now see a screen
that says "Select Game" at the top. At this screen, press these buttons in
this order: L button, R button, R button, UP, DOWN. Once you do this a

player will lose additional energy.
In the two player game, play until there is one credit left for each player.
If one of the players has more credits than the other, let that player get
down to 1 credit. When asked to continue, press START simultanously on both
controllers. Once you do this, the game will continue as normal, but when
you lose your lives and are asked to continue again, you will notice that
your continues have jumped to 7. If you repeat this process again you will
aquire 7 more credits to continue. Now you can beat the final boss and

=======================
Stage Select and Sound Test - Make sure both controllers are plugged in.
Go to the option screen and move the cursor to the EXIT. Now instead of
exiting, hold button L and START simulataneously on the 2nd controller and
press START on the 1st.  You will find yourself on a special screen which
you can select stages, area, sound effects and music.

Magic & Weapons - The power of Arthur's weapons, not counting the Godess
Bracelet, will be increased if he is wearing Bronze or Golden Armor. To
access the magical properties of each weapon, Arthur must be wearing the
Golden Armor.
To use his arsenal of magic spells, he must be wearing the Golden Armor. The
type of magic which Arthur can use depends on the weapon that he is carrying.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Secret Exits - Each level in Super Mario World has an least one exit. Most
of the secret exits listed below will be marked with a key which Maio must
fit into a nearby keyhole.

DONUT PLAINS 1 to Donut Secret 1 - If Mario has completed the Green Switch
Palace, finding this secret exit will be no problem. There is a column of
Green Blocks near the end of Donut Plains 1. Hold the Y button and run right
up the Blocks to find the key and keyhole. If the Green Switch Palace has
not been tripped, Mario must have the Cape to fly up to the secret exit.

DONUT PLAINS 2 to The Green Switch Palace - Mario heads underground for
Donut Palains 2 which features automatic scrolling. Go up to the second green
pipe to reach a secret area. There is a Vine in the highest Block that will
take you to the key. Caped Mario can fly to the secret exit, but you may want
to grab the blue shell and toss it at the highest Block to trip the Vine.

DONUT GHOST HOUSE to the Top Secret Area - You must have Caped Mario to get
to this secret exit and Goal. Fly up and to the far left to find an opening.
Run right to the door. Don't forget to get the four 1-Ups.

DONUT SECRET 1 to the Donut Secret House - The keyhole in the underwater
Donut Secret 1 is in plain sight. But you will need to activate the P-Switch
and then hit the "?" Block to find the key.

DONUT SECRET HOUSE to Star Road (1) - Carry the P-Switch to the left of where
the Yellow Blocks and Yellow Door are. Activate the switch. Hit the Block 
above the Door and then climb the Vine that appears. The Blue Door will take
you to Big Boo's room. Avoid the Boo Buddies and hit Big Boo three times with
a Block to defeat him.

VANILLA DOME 1 to Vanilla Secret 1 - By dusting off the Red Switch Palace,
Mario will be able to find this secret exit with no problem. The Yellow Block
above the Red Blocks holds a Vine which Mario must climb to get to the secret
exit. If  Mario has Yoshi along with him, a double jump off of Yoshi's back
may get him up to the Vine if the Red Switch Palace has not been activated.

VANILLA SECRET 1 to Star Road (2) - There are two green pipes which extend
out of the left wall. The entrance to the secet area and secret Goal is
through the bottom pipe. Caped Mario can get to the pipe fairly easily.

CHEESE BRIDGE AREA to Soda Lake - Expert Mario pilots can sail Mario under
the first goal and back up to reach the second Goal which leads to Soda Lake.
Mario can also glide under the first Goal while riding Yoshi, then Spin Jump
off his back to save himself and run for the second Goal.

FOREST OF ILLUSION 1 to the Forest Ghost House - There is a "?" Block just
under the last horizontal log platform. Get the Balloon in the "?" Block and
float back to the left, going under the log platforms. Avoid the Koopa. Land
next to the keyhole. Jump and hit the "?" Block to locate the key. Make sure
you don't knock the key off the Block when you jump up to grab it.

FOREST OF ILLUSION 2 to the Blue Switch Palace - The key to the secret exit
that leads to the Blue Switch Palace is in a secret chamber on the other side
of a seemingly solid wall. There is a Yellow "!" Block next to the wall. The
secret area is at the bottom of the screen. Swim to the left to get the key.
Watch out for Rip Van Fish.

FOREST OF ILLUSION 2 to Roy's Castle - The tall green pipe near the end of
Forest of Illusion 3 will lead Mario to the secret exit area. Make sure that
you're Super, Fiery or Caped Mario when you enter the pipe. Break the Blocks
above the key using a Spin Jump and use the key on the keyhole.

FOREST GHOST HOUSE to Forest of Illusion 1 - When Mario activates the 
P-Switch and goes through the Blue Door that appears, he will need to go to
the left to reach the secret exit. There are two Yellow Exit Doors. The door
farthest to the left will take Mario to the Forest of Illusion 1. Before the
Goal, he'll be able to grab a rare 3-Up Moon.

FOREST OF ILLUSION 4 to the Forest Secret Area - Mario must get to this
precarious purple pipe in order to find this secret exit. Regular, Super or
Firery Mario won't be able to jump up to the pipe without help. Caped Mario
can get here with ease. Take Yoshi along so Mario can Double Jump up to the
pipe. Watch out for Lakitu! The key and keyhole are waiting at the other end 
of the pipe.

CHOCOLATE ISLAND 2 to Chocolate Secret - The key and keyhole at the end of
Chocolate Island 2 are waiting if you complete the first two sections with at
least 250 ticks remaining on the timer. No need to waste time getting coins
or stomping enemies - go straight for the pipes! If all Switch Palaces are
cleared, you can avoid the Chargin' Chucks by taking the high road on the
colored Blocks near the end of the level.

CHOCOLATE ISLAND 3 to the Chocolate Fortress - If you've cleared the Green
Switch Palace, you'll find a Green Block containing a Feather near the first
Goal on Chocolate Island 3. Use it or Yoshi to fly under the Goal and up to
the second Goal.

VALLEY OF BOWSER 2 to the Valley Fortress - After Mario enters and exits the
second green pipe he will need to take the first possible opportunity to jump
up and off the screen. Mario will be out of sight, but if he runs to the 
left, soon he will come into view and will be able to grab the key in this
secret area.

VALLEY GHOST HOUSE to Larry's Castle - Hit the "?" Block near the end of the
level and manipulate the stream of Coins upwards and to the right. Stomp the
P-Switch to turn the Coins into Blocks. The key and keyhole are in the upper
right corner of the room.

VALLEY OF BROWSER 4  to Star Road (5) and Front Door - Only with Yoshi's help
can Mario get the key to unlock the gate which leads to Star Road 5. If 
you're having a hard time getting Yoshi to the key, make sure you've crossed
the Midway Gate, leave the course and return with the Blue Yoshi. The Blue
Yoshi can gobble a Koopa and then sail over the dangerous second half of
Valley of Bowser 4.

STAR WORLD 1 to Star Road (2) - The key to the secret exit which leads to
Star Road (2) is easier to get to than the regular exit! Break through the 
first set of Blocks and run the way to the right. Spin Jump and break down
through the second set of Blocks. Soon you'll find the key.

STAR WORLD 2 to Star Road (3) - If you're looking for the secret exit, don't
take the green pipe - swim in the arrow passageway under the rock formation.
You'll find the key and keyhole at the end.

STAR WORLD 3 to Star Road (4) - This is the shortest level in Super Mario
World. Toss the Black straight up at Lakitu and knock him out of his cloud.
Hop into the cloud and take a ride up the secret area. The key is on the left
and the keyhole is on the right.

STAR WORLD 4 to Star Road (5) - It will be no problem for Mario to reach the
secret exit if he's cleared the Green and Red Switch Palaces. The key is
hidden in the "?" Block near the keyhole. Take along the Koopa Shell which is
conveniently located on the upper stone Blocks to trip the "?" Block if
you're not Caped Mario.

STAR WORLD 5 to Star Road (6) - All Switch Palaces must be cleared for Caped
Mario to reach the secret exit in Star World 5. Activate the "?" Block to
send the stream of Coins up and to the right. Stomp the P-Switch to change
the Coins into Blocks. Run along the Blocks and fly up to the point where the
Yellow Blocks begin.
---------------------------
Hidden 1-Up Caches - There are numerous areas in Super Mario World where you
can find a feast of 1-Ups, from 8 to 99: 
Note:when you save a game you lose all of your accumulated 1-Ups.

Yoshi's Island 2 - Max 99 - Use Mario's Cape Attack to send the Koopa Shell
flying. When the shell ricochets off the step, use the Cape Attack to send it
back towards the step. Repeat this process for unlimited 1-Ups. (Hard)

Donut Secret 1 - Max 99 - In the chamber where Mario becomes Balloon Mario,
you can get an empty shell. Take the shell down the pipe and drop it in the
gap where the Dragon Coin is. Stomp it repeatedly for unlimited 1-Ups. (Hard)

Morton's Castle - Max 40 - Stomp the Dry Bones and then climb the Vine. 
Position Mario so that he will automatically stomp him again when the old bag
of bones revives himself. (Easy)

Vanilla Dome 4 - Max 40 - Bullet Bills will continually come out of this 
area. If Mario takes a shell with him he can score plenty of 1-Ups by heaving
the shell up at the lower Block when Bullet Bill comes out. Bullet Bill will
bite it and start giving you 1-Ups after a few direct hits. This trick may
take a little practice to perfect. (Moderate)

Vanilla Secret 2 - Max 54 - Grab the P-Switch that's hidden in a Block just
above the Spiny's Run left and drop the Switch just to the left of Midway 
Gate. Stomp it and race to the left collecting coins to earn 1-Ups. (Easy)

Forest of Illusion 1 - Max 18 - Take Starman from the Roulette Block near the
Midway Gate. Run to the right hitting every enemy until the invincibility
power wears off. Rack up massive points and then tons of 1-Ups. (Easy)

Forest of Illusion 4 - Max 99 - There are three areas in Forest Illusion 4
where Mario can earn unlimited 1-Ups. Toss a Koopa shell so it will rapidly
bounce between two obstacles. Jump to higher ground and let Fishin' Lakitu
toss Spinys into the area where the shell is. (Moderate)

Chocolate Island 5 - Max 99 - Grab the P-Switch at the beginning of the
stage. Don't stomp it - use it to help Mario swim. Kick a Koopa shell into
the water area which is located just before the Midway Gate. While smimming,
stomp the Koopa shell repeadedly for an unlimited bonanza of 1-Ups. (Moderate)

Sunken Ghost Ship - Max 99 - Swim up against the bottom of the overhanging
crate in the area as Super, Fiery or Caped Mario and his feet will hit the
oncoming Bullet Bills. They'll go down quickly for an increasing number of
points and eventually 1-Ups. (Easy)

Star World 2 - Max 15 - Hold the Mini-Yoshi to help Mario swim. Grab the Star.
Run into the fish, but don't let the young Yoshi eat any of them. A second 
Star can be had if Mario gets into the "?" Block fast enough. (Moderate)

Groovy - Max 8 - Nab Starman from the Roulette Block just after the gap and
high tail it off to the right. Run through every enemy in your path. Make
sure to get the whole vertical chain of Pokeys near the end of the stage.
There's not a whole lot of 1-Ups there.

--------------------------
Power-Ups Between Stages - Carry a P-Switch or a Koopa Shell through an
exit gate and the power-up item in the reserve box will transform as
 follows:

     Mario            Item In Reserve Box          Transforms To
     -------------    -------------------------    ---------------------
     Small            Empty                        Super 'Shroom
                      Super 'Shroom                1-Up
                      Fire Flower                  Super 'Shroom
                      Cape Feather                 Super 'Shroom

     Super            Empty                        Super 'Shroom
                      Super 'Shroom                1-Up
                      Fire Flower                  Super 'Shroom
                      Cape Feather                 Super 'Shroom

     Fiery            Empty                        Fire Flower
                      Super 'Shroom                Fire Flower
                      Fire Flower                  1-Up
                      Cape Feather                 Fire Flower

     Caped            Empty                        Cape Feather
                      Super 'Shroom                Cape Feather
                      Fire Flower                  Cape Feather
                      Cape Feather                 1-Up

Unlimited Extra Lives - Once you have uncovered the secret area in the
Donut Plains, select a two-player game and station one of the Mario Brothers
there. Get the Yoshi from inside the stage and a 1-Up appears in its place
from then on. Use the other brother to play through the game, and whenever
he runs low on extra lives, have the brother stationed at the secret area
send him more.

There's another place where you can get unlimited lives, at least 100, in
the Sunken Ghost ship (1st Section in Valley of Bowser). Just before you 
enter the pipe to go the second portion of the ship, go to the left and up. 
There will be two bullet things that will keep shooting and they will hit 
your feet. First, you get 200, 400, 800, ...., up to 8000, then you get 
1-ups for every hit. So, I just sit there for a minute and rack up lives.

In the Forest of Illusion 4 (one of the acts on the left side) there is
an act where there is a koopa "fishing" with a green mushroom. Ignore him.
Get a shell and run to where you find the first pipe. There is a monster
that comes out of the pipe and throws creatures at you. There is a depression
in front of the pipe. Take the shell and throw it at the pipe, it will start
to bounce back and forth. Everytime the guy in the pipe throws a creature
the bouncing shell will kill it. Further, you can now "take the bait" from
the guy in the cloud. He will also throw more creatures giving you more guys.
It is possible to get 40-70 guys (depending on how good you are at getting
the guy in the cloud to constantly throw in the depression) in one play of
the scene.


Secret Power-Up Room - Get the cape and go into the first ghost house in 
world 2. Run left and fly straight up the left side of the screen. Land on
the platform and run to the right. You will see four blocks with 1-Up
mushrooms and a door. Finish the level and a hidden dot will appear on the
map. Power-up in this hidden room, then go back in for another 1-Up.

Quick Power-Ups - Mario can go into areas he has already cleared to pick up
useful items, collect Coins, or get 1-Ups. He doesn't need to go through the
entire stage to get out of it, though. Just pause the game by pressing Start,
then press the Select button. Mario will reappear outside.

   Cheese Bridge area - If you know that Mario isn't going to make it to
   the next platform, you can press Start and Select to exit. Try again!

   Forest of Illusion 1 - Break the Midway Gate, but don't go through the 
   Goal. Mario can return here often for a 1-Up feast.

   Chocolate Island 5 - This is a very convienent level. You can always go
   in, pick up Yoshi and a Fire Flower, then leave.
  

Bonus Items - At the end of every level of play, try carrying a turtle shell,
a P-Block or an enemy through the high bar and into the next round. It will
turn into a power-up item that you may either use at that time or save for
later.

Yoshi Boost - You can use Yoshi's lofty jumping skills to boost your own
mid-air acrobatics. While your riding Yoshi, press the B button to make him
jump. Then when Yoshi reaches his peak, press the A button to jump off his
back to the top of the screen. This awesome height will come in handy at
Exit Gates where it pays to break the tape when it's at the top.

Castle Comeback - While you can enter and re-enter most of the sections in
the game, it seems that once the Koopa Kid Castles have been brought down,
there's no going back to them. But if you place your character on the Castle
rubble, and press the L and R Buttons at the same time, you'll re-enter the
Castle as thought it had never been destroyed.

Invinciblity Extension - You can earn eight quick 1-Ups in Donut Secret 2.
Climb the vine that is near to the beginning of the course and release a
Starman at the top. Then drop down to the floor and collect the Starman
before it drops into a hole. While you're under the invincible influence of
the Starman, run with super speed to a Block near the end of the course. If
you are still invincible when you hit the Block, you'll release another
Starman. Collect it for extended invinciblity and plow through the nearby
enemies. You'll earn more points with each enemy that you defeat. When you
get to and buzz through the vertical line-up of Koopa Paratroppers just
before the Goal, each of these flying fiends will net you a 1-Up.

Quick Save - While you can save your progress whenever you complete a 
Fortress, Castle or Ghost House, there may be other times that you would 
like to record your accomplishments. Since it's quick and easy to get to an 
alternative exit of the Donut Ghost House, you can save your progress
anytime. Enter the Ghost House with a Cape, then fly up to the second floor
and run to the exit. You'll be given the option to save your progress and
continue playing.

Additional Hints:

  1-Up Blocks - In the five tiered 1-Up chambers, Mario can collect all 5
  1-Ups if he uses his cape.  Spin jump and hit the lower corner of each
  block with the cape. The first two block in each row yield coins, the
  third will yield a 1-Up.

  Remember that pressing START followed by SELECT will drop you back to
  the map screen, if you've completed the level before. Handy for collecting
  a needed powerup near the start of a nearby level.

  Berries for Yoshi - 10 Red Berries will cause an egg to hatch into a
  Super Mushroom. 2 Pink Berries will cause an egg to hatch into coins.
  3 Green Berries will add 20 seconds to the timer.

  Yoshi and Shells - If Yoshi spits out a Blue or Green Shell before
  swallowing it, it can be reused.

  Yoshi and P-Switches - After stomping a P-Switch, use Yoshi to pick it
  up. When Yoshi spits it back out, it will again be reusable.

  Mario can take a direct hit from any creature if riding Yoshi.

  Mario can hold 2 items at once by stacking one on the other then
  picking up both.

  Magic Number 1-Up - If the tens digit of the star bonus achieved by
  breaking the goal post tape matches both the ones and the tens digit
  of the time remaining on the timer, you will earn a 1-Up.

  Top Secret Area - Get a cape. Enter the first ghost house and walk to
  the right until the first hole in the floor. Hold the Y button to spin.
  Run to the left until able to fly, jump and fly up the left hand wall 
  until you can land on a ledge to your right. Run all the way across 
  the house, off the ledge, and out the door at the end. Once you exit,
  you will have a path to an area where you can fully power up, get a
  Yoshi, and reenter for as many 1-UPs as you want (1 at a time).

  Bonus Items - At the end of every world, carry a turtle shell, P-block,
  or an enemy through the high bar. It will turn into a power-up item
  that you can use in the next world.

  Just what is the utility of a Firey Mario in SMW? - 3 of the
  Koopalings can be beaten by fireballs. Hit Morton, Ludwig, or Roy 12
  times w/ fireballs and they are history. This is particularly useful
  against Morton and Roy who move pretty fast once you get them upset.

  In Chocolate Island 1 there is a 3-Up Moon just beyond the midway
  gate, but to get it you must pickup and carry the springboard which is
  left of the midway gate (means you cannot reach the tape to break it).
  Carry the springboard to the level area left of the big crescent-shaped
  section. If you jump as high as possible and then go right while in 
  the air, you can land on a set of clouds where the moon is.

  If you don't use the angled green pipe to launch Mario forward in
  Chocolate Island 1, then you will not get a midway gate.

Favorite 1-Up Tricks:

  For someone who hasn't advanced far in SMW, the easiest source of
  one-ups is Yoshi's Island 2. Enter with Yoshi, then bumping the block
  that normally gives Yoshi gives a one-up. Use START and SELECT to
  jump out of the course and repeat as often as desired. It is a little
  faster if Mario is caped and you enter at the middle of Yoshi's Island
  2. Then one can get a life every 10 seconds or so with no skill
  required. I generally run it up to the maximum of 99 lives in order
  to pay for the increasingly long trip back to Yoshi's Island.

  Go to Chocolate Island 4 in world 6. You must have a cape. Get the first 
  P-block and go down the grey tube. Once in the tube, grab the second 
  P-block and jump off the edge. Hug the right wall until you see the seventh
  opening in the wall that is filled with 1-UP mushrooms. Float into the 
  passage and grab the 1-UPs. When you come out of the tube, go back to the
  left and repeat as many times as needed.

  Just before entering the last area of Vanilla Secret Fortress (to face
  Reznor), you can earn many 1-Ups by repeatedly stomping the Bony Beetles
  at the Red Door (don't touch the ground - tread water). At first this
  will just earn points, but the points increase and eventually become
  1-Ups. This basic technique applies most places where an enemy can be
  continually stomped w/o touching the ground.

  In Butter Bridge 2, there is one green pipe with a small log platform
  on both sides (this is about 2/3 of the way through, also it's the
  pipe you come back up through if you go down the second purple pipe
  to ride the rope). If you have a cape (there is a feather in the
  green "!" block right after the middle goal), get on the right log
  platform trapping the koopa between you and the green pipe. Now, you
  can use the cape spin trick to continuously knock the koopa shell
  against the pipe to collect unlimited 1-Ups until the clock runs out.

  Go to the first world in the forest (the one next to the Ghost House). 
  Play through that World and touch the midway goal (the small goal post)
  Then exit the world (start to pause, select to exit).
  Now go back into the world. You'll start at the midway post. Run to the
  right and you'll find a block that alternates between the different 
  power up-s in the game. Hit the block when it's a feather and you'll catch
  the invincible star. Now run to the right and hit every monster along the 
  way. Soon, you'll start to earn 1-Ups and 2-Ups (from the centipede-like 
  creatures). You should be able to get 15 lives or more before the star 
  fizzes out.

  One of the best way to gain additional lives is to use the star. I use the
  4th special world, (the one on ice, with lots of Rex's.)  Play until
  you get to the platform that has 5 coins and a ?-box above it.  You must
  carry the Power button with you to this point. Hit the P, and get the star
  from the ?-box.
  Then jump up and down and touch all the cheep-cheep's that are flying back
  and forth. When the P-power ends, and you fall (because the ledge turns
  back into coins) run to the left and kill everybody in your path. I can
  consistently get 17-20 lives from using this method.


  This method yields 40-50 lives, a power-up, and a Yoshi all at once.
  In Vanilla Secret 3, go to the midway tape.  Break the tape and leave
  the world. Go back in the world, starting at midway. Go right, until
  you come to a pipe. In a music box above the pipe is a power-up.
  Continue right, avoiding paratroopers and spiked guys, over the
  chasm, and to the row of blocks above a field of venus fly-traps.
  Hit the bottom of the SECOND block in that row. It is over the venus
  fly-traps, but with minimal practice you can hit it easily. In the
  SECOND block is a P-Block. DON'T JUMP ON IT!  Grab it, and take it with
  you. While carrying the P-Block, return back to your left, over the
  chasm, past the pipe you saw before, and past the midway tape. Continue
  until you get BETWEEN 2 pipes on the same screen. Each pipe has a
  villian jumping out of it, and there is a chasm just to the left of
  the left pipe. Set the P-Block down here.
  Jump on the P-Block, jump over the chasm on the left, and run as far
  and as fast as you can left. Each turtle/villian has turned into a
  coin, and after ~5 of them they are all 3-ups. Tons of 'em.
  The P-Block power will run out about the time you get back to the Yoshi
  block.  Get Yoshi, and leave the world.  ***NOTE: Don't leave the world
  until the game has finished couting up your lives!!!!  You get so many
  you have to wait till it counts em all. Voila!  Many lives and a Yoshi.


How to beat AWESOME (in Special World near end of game):

Here's how to beat AWESOME without having to worry with jumping on koopas
and bullets and all those nasty things at the end:

1. The goal is to cross the whole section at the end (where all the fish,
bullets, etc start coming at you like crazy) using a flying blue yoshi.

2. You may get blue yoshis very easily down on starworld 2 or 3 (the one 
under water where the egg hatches -- small blue yoshi will eat a power star 
and immediately turn into big blue yoshi. At this point, press pause-select
to get out.

3. The hardest part is probably getting blue yoshi in AWESOME over to the
last pipe before the nasty section. Once you get him there, try to eat one
of the turtle shells and/or turtles. BUT HERE IS THE TRICK: You will never
make it over the gorge to the end by flying at normal speed. You have to fly
fast just as you would run fast by holding the Y button down, while flapping
"your wings" with the B button.  But watch out, if you press the Y-button 
AFTER you eat a shell, yoshi will spit it out.  You must press Y before 
eating the shell, and never let up again until you get to the end. Flap like crazy and
you will make it over the gorge.


How to beat Funky in the Special World:

1. Ah, this was truly a nasty level. Get equipped with a Yoshi and a Cape from
the level two spaces to the right. Then, at the very beginning, run to one
block before you meet the first wiggly, then fly with Yoshi. When it looks
like you're coming down, DON'T let go of any buttons. You will
automatically get kicked further by the bullets firing off the canons. Keep
this up till you reach the springboard next to two pipes.

2. Then, the procedure I followed to carry the springboard to the next pipe
was to first swallow the wiggly in the next area, pick up the springboard,
run with it, jump, etc....


SUPER OFF ROAD
==============
Unlimited Continues - First plug in both controllers. Next, select a 2
player game and play as the red truck, but let the blue truck stand still.
When the race ends, you will be in third place, which will automatically
put you in the next race.  The unused blue truck will always be able to
continue.


SUPER R-TYPE
============
Weapon Select and Full Power Up - Begin this trick at the title screen by
pressing DOWN, R, RIGHT, DOWN, RIGHT, RIGHT, DOWN, RIGHT, DOWN, DOWN.  You
will hear a noise like the start chime then press START to begin the game.
After the game has started, press START to pause it, and hit R, RIGHT, DOWN,
Y, DOWN, RIGHT, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN, RIGHT, RIGHT, and then press the 
buttons for the laser FIRST, AND THEN a missile.  After you have done this 
un-pause and take out the enemy!

The choice of weapons is as follows:

                 LASER
           A - Ring Laser
           B - Air to Surface Laser
           X - Reflective Laser
           Y - Spread Laser
           R - Mega Bomb

                 MISSILE
           A - Homing Missile
           X - Air to Surface Missiles

Level Select - Hold down the R button on the top of the controller and press
UP on the pad nine times.  You will hear a tone that indicates that the
level select has been activated.  Now press START to pause the game.
Hold the R button down while at the same time depressing the A button.
While holding both buttons down, press SELECT.  In the lower left hand
corner of the screen you will see a set of numbers indicating on what level
play will begin.  Simply press UP or DOWN on the control pad to select from
any game level!
NOTE: If you select 11 through 17 when entering the code, you'll be one 
difficulty level higher than the one shown on the title screen.


SUPER SMASH TV
==============
Stage Select - While on the Player Select/Skill screen, enter the following:
Push Right, Right, Up, Down, R, L, and Start. If entered correctly, you'll
hear the word "BINGO" yelled out. The Circuit Warp screen will automatically
come up when you begin the game. It lists all three circuits, the battles
with the circuit leaders, the final battle and the credits. Highlight one
of these by pressing the Up and Down buttons and then press Start to begin.

Extra Lives and Continues - On the Player Select/Skill screen, you can also
enter the Extra Lives / Extra Credits code. Press Down, L, R, and Up. Again
you will hear the word BINGO. You will then be taken to an option screen 
where you will be able to select from 3 to 7 Lives and 4 to 7 credits. Press
the Start key again to enter the arena.

Life and Continue Increase - Go to the player/skill selection screen and
push the control pad down to the level of skill.  Now, press and hold the L
button.  While holding the L button, press and hold the R button. With
these held down, press UP on the control pad.  You will hear "BINGO" and a
screen should appear that will let you increase your lives and credits to
continue.

Speed-Up Mode - You don't have to beat the game to get to the speed-up mode.
Go to the player/skill selection screen and press these buttons in this
order: LEFT, RIGHT, LEFT, UP, R button, R button. You will hear the word
"Bingo" and then you will be able to choose your options before the game
begins.

Secret Rooms - There are three secret rooms and the Pleasure Dome. You'll
find the secret rooms by walking through unlit exits. The first one is in the
room marked TOTAL CARNAGE, in the lower right section of Arena #1. Clear the
room of enemies and when the exit appears below the top door in the room,
exit instead to the right by pushing against the door. There are valuable 
prizes in Secret Room #1 and no enemies.
You'll be closing in on another secret room when you reach a room marked
BUFFALO HERD NEARBY! in the lower right section of Arena #2. Clear the room
of thugs and exit to the right instead of the one marked at the top of the
screen. You'll enter Secret Room #2. Secret Room #3 is in Arena #3. Clear 
the room marked SECRET ROOMS NEARBY! in the lower right section and exit to 
the right.
The Pleasure Dome is close to the last room in Arena #3. Move two rooms to
the right of COBRA DEATH. You'll reach a room called either YOU HAVE ENOUGH
KEYS! or NOT ENOUGH KEYS! depending or not whether you have collected ten
keys on your journey. If you have reached that total you can enter the
Pleasure Dome, otherwise the exit will open instead to the final Boss. 
Enemies are abundant in this room. They will pour in for some time, but when
you have finally cleared this room, two exits will light up. By running 
through the lower exit, you'll enter the Pleasure Dome. Collect the tons of 
Spokesmodels and rack up points.
If you collect all five question marks, the Pleasure Dome will not appear!
Instead, the game will "reprogram" itself and activate a special 33 MHz
Turbo Mode to speed up the action.

SUPER STAR WARS                                                  
===============
99 Extra Lives - In the Land of the Sand People, there are 2 sets of floating
rocks, in  which you have to jump from rock to rock to get to the other cliff.
At the very beginning of the second set you come too, jump off the cliff edge,
and aim Luke to the left. You will land on a ledge, and you will be in a small
cave area. Falling rocks will keep falling on you, but don't worry about that.
Now shot up in the air all over the place to reveal 1-UPs. There are 7 or 9 of
them. Get them all and then commit suicide. When the game starts up again, you
start at the cliff top again. Jump down and repeat until you have 99 lives.

Sound Test & Special Code Screen - The sound test screen is also a way to
find different codes for the game. After choosing the Start Game option from
the title screen, go to the first level. Hold down all Y, B, X, and A 
buttons simultanously and while holding these, hit the START button. It 
should bring up the Sound Test screen. Change the music to what you like.

To work these codes, turn your Super NES off and then on again. Do the code
of your choice at the title screen when the "Start Game" and "Options" choice
comes up. You will hear the Jawa yell if the trick has worked. If you reset
the game and try these tricks, they will not work. You must turn the power
off and on again for the tricks to work properly.

Advanced Player - Start the game like normal, but when you begin, press
SELECT on controller 1 before you serve.  Now on controller 2, press these
buttons in this order:  R, R, LEFT, DOWN, B, A, L and L.  You should then
hear the crowd cheer.  Back on controller 1, press A or B and you should
see some numbers and letters on the screen.  Change all of these numbers
and letters to the letter F using the X and B buttons on controller 1, and
you will have a pro who is fast and very accurate.

The numbers actually mean something. If the number at the top of the screen
is a 0, the digits relate to the abilities of Player One. If it is a 1, you
are looking at the abilities of the player on the other side of the net.
(Player Two in a competitive match). If the number is a 2, these are the
abilities of Player One's partner. A number 3 is for the partner of the
player on the other side of the net. You can change the number at the top of
the screen with the A Button.
The letters and numbers which signify the abilities of a player are arranged
in four rows of eight digits which range from 0 to 9, then A to F, 0 being
the lowest and F the highest (Hexidecimal numbers). The numbers and letters
on the top row relate to the player's strength and speed. Digits on the 
second and third rows relate to the player's intelligence (only if the player
is computer controlled). You can change any of the digits. First single them
out with the Control Pad and tap the X button. Then press the Select Button
to return to the game. 

Power Player - On the Player Select screen, highlight the name of the player
that you intend to choose. Then on Controller II, press the L button five
times, the X button once, the R button seven times, and the X button once
again. When you begin playing with the highlighted pro, you'll have
incredible speed and power and you'll easily march through the rounds of the
tournament.

Increase to 10 lives - On title screen, using controller 2, enter the follow-
ing code:  UP, UP, DOWN, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, B, A.  Next, go to the options
screen with controller 1 and you should be able to increase your number of
lives even further to 10 lives.

these, press START and you will be brought to an option screen which will
give you many features to improve your game.

from the title screen by pressing and holding the Select button and pressing
the Start button. You can change the number of points needed for a bonus ship
and add to your starting number of ships. Since the configuration mode 
changes after you have completed a game, wait for the title screen to 
reappear and reset your options.

Methods for Defeating Various Enemies:

Use the F8E until you can afford an Efreet

   First board - Tank:
           No weapons.  Shoot at the tank treads and dodge the rockets.

   First Air board -- Big Stealth:
           Hit the big Stealth with three clusters as soon you can see it.
           Be sure the grab the (3)power-up after the first cluster.  You
           have to be at least half way up the screen to get it.

           Next, hit the Stealth with bombs until it rises too high then
           launch your megacrusher.

           Get behind the Stealth and fire away, staying between the
           air charges and away from the center of the Stealth.

   Submarine:
           No weapons.
           Stay in the upper left part of the screen when you are
           not shooting the Sub.

   Land Carrier:
           You don't need weapons. Take bombs though.
           Get low on the deck. You can shoot out the aircraft launchers
           and the rocket ports, but you have to change elevation a little
           and dodge around. You don't have to raise up until the end.
           You will be below the big rocket fire.

           Once you have disabled everything except the big rocket launcher,
           raise up to just above the mountain line and fire at the top
           edge of the big rocket launcher. He'll die fairly soon,
           soon.

   Second Air board -- Small Stealths:
           Bombs and megacrusher.
           Use bombs to take the guys behind you. Get above them.
           You have to keep up or your dead. Use the megacrusher on the
           three Stealths. They are weak now. Shoot-em-down.

   Minks battleship:
           This guy is hard. Take all the weapons.
           Fire at the small gun on the front.  Raise up to the top of the
           screen before you get too close or the Unicorn will pass. Be
           sure to get the Unicorn. Try to hit the stacks until you get
           to the middle of the ship and then launch you megacrusher.
           It will knock out all the small arms in the central part of
           the ship.  Drop bombs on the rear big guns. Get get below the
           deck for the turn around. Raise and knock out he back small
           guns. If you have enough fire power you can target the
           the two big guns and still stay away from their fire. You have
           to get just high enough. Once the big guns are gone, fire into
           the stacks (he'll flash when you hit the right spot). He'll die.
           You don't have to knock out the fron guns.      

   Forest Fortress:
           Take all your weapons, just in case...
           There is a Unicorn just before the fortress, but I can't
           figure out how to get it.

           Get to the level where you can hit the front cannon and the
           aircraft launcher at the same time. You can stay here and
           clear out the whole front of the fortress. Don't move until
           you knock out the last cannon. Raise up and hit the big
           cannon low. Use you cluster bomb or regular bomb to take out
           the last aircraft. The cannon will blow up if you hit it hard.
           Next, hit the rocket launcher. Drop a few bombs on it at the
           same time you shoot at the second large cannon. Get the
           fuel-up at the end. Take out the rear small cannons the same
           way you did the front cannons. Go back to the rocket launcher
           and take'em out.

   SR71 Blackbird:
           Take all the weapons.

           Use napalm to get the rocket launchers.

           Use the gunpod once the air battle starts. Get below the
           Blackbird with the gunpod and go to work. That's all it takes.

   Cave Fortress:
           This one is pretty hard.  I've only beat it once so far.

           Take cluster, phoenix, gunpod and megacrusher.

           Shoot down everything until the second ground machine gun then
           use phoenix, until you get to the vertical assent. Before
           entering the column launch a megacrusher. Get up and over
           to the upper middle cavern, launch a second megacrusher.
           Use cluster until the vertical descent where you go back to 
           phoenix. Use all your phoenix up. Too many weapons get in
           the way at the end. There is a Unicorn at the upper right when
           you get to the one-eyed-machine. Get the Unicorn, keep
           the conveyer belt clear with your gun and clusters. Shoot
           the crap out of the eye (up close) with the gunpod. The
           eye turns red and he dies.

Technique for obtaining all four Magic Bottles:

  1) Buy one from the Bottle Salesman in the Light World village, for 100
       Rupees.
  2) In the Light World village, the building south of the one with the sick 
       boy in it has a rear entrance. There's a chest inside, with a Magic 
       Bottle in it.
  3) If you swim upriver from Lake Hylia in the Light World, you'll swim 
       under a bridge. There's a man camped out there, and if you talk to him,
       he'll give you a Magic Bottle.
  4) After completing the Ice Palace dungeon (the one with the 5th crystal,
       in the Dark World), a locked chest will appear in the Dark World 
       equivalent of the Blacksmiths' House. Get the chest, return to the 
       Light World via the Magic Mirror, and go talk to the 'middle-aged man'
       just outside of the Desert. He'll open the chest for you if you agree
       to his conditions.  You'll find a Magic Bottle inside.


How to make money in Zelda 3:

  After you've found the Power Gloves that allow you to lift white rocks, go
  to the southwest portion of the Light World. Just outside the desert, you'll
  find an alcove with two large white rocks in it. One of them has a staircase
  under it, and leads to a room with 10 vases in it. Each vase has 5 Rupees.
  Loot them all, and then walk back outside. You can keep entering, looting,
  and leaving until you have however many Rupees you'd like (up to 999).


How to catch the man that runs away from you in the Light World village:

  Approach him from the west.  As soon as he starts running away from you,
  Dash Attack (via the Pegasus Shoes) towards him.  You'll catch him.  All
  he does is tell you to try dashing into Trees, anyway.


How to open the locked chest found in the Dark World:

  Take it to the 'middle-aged man' at the entrance to the Desert in the Light
  World. Agree with whatever he asks you.


What to do with the Magic Powder:

  Once you've acquired the Magic Hammer, go jump into the hole outside the
  Blacksmiths' House in the Light World. Sprinkle Magic Powder on the altar
  you'll find down there, and you'll gain the ability to perform magic at
  half the normal magic point cost.

  You can also sprinkle it on the white-and-red flying skulls that drain your
  Hearts and Magic gauge in the dungeons, and they'll turn into Faeries. Quite
  an improvement. (A rare few of them are immune to this.)


What triggers the Crystal Switches:

  1) Hitting it with your Sword.
  2) Hitting it with your Boomerang.
  3) Hitting it with the Hookshot.
  4) Having a Bomb go off near it.
  5) Hitting it with an Arrow.
  6) Hitting it with the Fire Rod.
  7) Hitting it with the Ice Rod.
  8) Throwing an object (vase, etc) at it.
  9) Hitting it with the beam of energy fired by any Sword of Level 2 or
     higher, while you're fully healed.
  X) Probably some other things I've forgotten.


How to kill the green and red guys who follow your movement:

  Fire an Arrow near one, and make him walk into it.


Location of the eight Transport Squares in the Light World:

  1) In the far Southwest corner of the Desert, under a black rock.  Only
     reachable via the Flute.
  2) In the Northwest part of the grassy area in the Southern part of the 
     world, under a white rock. You need the Magic Hammer to reach it.
  3) At one of the lowest points on Turtle Rock.
  4) On the top of Death Mountain.
  5) On top of Turtle Rock, but you must first use the Magic Hammer to hammer
     down the posts you find there.  Hammer them in a Counterclockwise
     direction, starting with the Southeastern one.
  6) In the easternmost Southern entrance to the Lost Woods.  If you go there
     from the South, you'll need the Titan Gloves to lift a black rock. If you
     go there from the North (inside the Lost Woods), you'll need the Magic
     Hammer.  The transporter is under a white rock.
  7) Under the black rock on the largest island in Lake Hylia.
  8) In the center of a circle of posts (need Magic Hammer) near a cave mouth
     in the eastern quadrant of the world. Hard to describe, sorry. It's
     under a white rock.
  X) The entrance to Hyrule castle, after you've defeated Agahnim for the
     first time. Just walk through the front gates, and you'll appear in the
     Dark World...it's not strictly a Transport Square.


How to get into the various dungeons:

  Castle Hyrule, the first time:
      There's a bush on the eastern side of the castle, covering a hole.
      Lift the bush and jump in.

  First Light World dungeon (1st pendant):
      Just walk in.

  Desert Palace (2nd pendant):
      Read the Book of Mudora in front of the green stone in the center
      of the desert.

  Tower of Hera (3rd pendant):
      Just walk in. However, you'll have to enter the Transporter atop
      Death Mountain, and then use the Magic Mirror to return to the Light
      World on top of Spectacle Rock in order to *reach* the dungeon.

  Castle Hyrule, the second time:
      Remember the energy barrier you saw blocking one of the outside doors
      the first time around? Hit it with the Master Sword.

  Palace of Darkness (1st crystal):
      Pay the monkey to follow you, and then pay him to open the door.

  2nd Dark World dungeon (2nd crystal):
      Use the Magic Mirror to return to the Light World. Enter the building
      there that corresponds to the dungeon entrance. Push the blocks out of
      your way, and exit north. Pull the right-hand lever, then go back
      outside and return to the Dark World via the Mirror's transport square.

  Lost Woods (3rd crystal):
      There are a number of mouths and holes around, and all of them lead
      into some area of the dungeon. Try them all. There's also one that
      is buried under a bush in the center of a 3x3 patch of bushes.

  Thieves' Den (4th crystal):
      Pull on the tines of the pitchfork held by the demon statue in the
      center of town.

  Ice Palace (5th crystal):
      Enter the transport square under the black rock on the island in the
      center of Lake Hylia (Light World).

  Swamp of Evil (6th crystal):
      In the Light World, use the Flute to go to location #6. Lift the black
      rock to your right, and enter the transport square there. Then go
      north, and look for a platform with the 'Ether' symbol in the center
      of it. Stand there, and cast Ether.

  Turtle Rock (7th crystal):
      Go to the equivalent of Turtle Rock in the Light World. Hammer down
      the posts you'll find there. Start with the Southeast one, and work
      counterclockwise. Enter the transport square that appears. Stand on
      the 'Quake' symbol just south of you, and cast Quake.

  Ganon's Tower:
      Just walk up to it, and the 7 crystals will break the seal on the door.


How to get into the last part of the Lost Woods dungeon (3rd crystal):

  Stand in front of the big insect-like thing, facing north. Use the Fire Rod
  on it, and you'll burn open an entrance.

How to reach the ledge along the south wall which you can see at the end of
level 3F in Ganon's Tower (the final Dark World dungeon, after Turtle Rock):

  See those blocks across from the ledge? Dash into them from the south, by
  either standing right on the edge of the platform, or by facing east, 
  holding the button down to Dash, and then facing North just before the 
  Dash causes you to move.
