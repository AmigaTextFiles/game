                               -------------

It is the players task to put all of the apes of one level into their cages
within a certain time limit. Drawn on each cage is an apehead, by which
they can be distinguished. If all apes are put into their cage during the
available time you receive a password in order to continue the game at
this place later on.

You control the game figure by using the joystick in port 2. Without
pressing the firebutton the figure walks left/right resp. climbs up/down.
Using the firebutton the figure jumps left/right/in place. By pressing fire
and joystick down you can use the selected extra. By pressing SPACE you can
choose between bat-mode (prefix) and extra-mode. The current mode is
displayed with a frame in the center of the lower screen.

Catch an ape: Occupy the ape, choose the bat-mode over SPACE, then press
fire and joystick down. The ape now lies on the ground and can be picked
up: Joystick down and fire. The ape is now in the bag and can be
transported. Joystick down and fire releases the ape from the bag. To put
the ape into a cage make sure that the cage door is open - it will open
automatically when Jeff is in front of the proper cage.


Good luck!!!
