                             SEGA  GENESIS
            GAME CHEATS, PASSWORDS & LEVEL CODES ( Feb 10, 1992 )

     The following list of Sega Genesis 73 game cheats and level codes was
complied by typing in cheat pages from various game magazines. I expect that
eventually, as more games are released, the file will become a small book.
I've listed below the magazines that were used for this file so that readers
with other issues or missing magazines can add to this file. Feel free to
add to this file, but if you do list your changes in the section below.
And for those who are too lazy to type in the cheats, mail Xerox's of
magazine cheats (Super Nintendo pages too for a similar cheat file) to the 
address listed below. I will type them in.
     One final note. Sometimes you will see a set of passwords that doesn't
work on your version of the game. Remember that in many cases there is a
Japanese version of the game. Since I used American magazines, the cheats
in this file are for the USA released version. Also since I don't own most
of these games, I haven't verified that the cheats work.
