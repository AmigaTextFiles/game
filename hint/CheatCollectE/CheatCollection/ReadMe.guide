CheatCollection is a list of cheats, solutions and levelcodes to many
games. There exist two versions, a German and an English one.
The German one is no translation of the English, so it is possible that the
German version has some more information to certain games. These two lists
are collected independently.

I tried to make the list as little as possibly, so I use a lot of tab stops
instead of spaces and I arranged all so, that it uses very less space.

The use of this list is very easy. Start the displaying with a double click
on the icon. Now you have a big list of all games in this part and some
buttons to go to the next parts (the list is splitted between the
characters) or to the German part. If you want to read a cheat click on its
name and you get the data.

The list is sorted by name. Game names starting with 'The' (The Settlers)
are sorted with their correct name (Settlers, The). This is also done by
German names starting with 'Der', 'Die' and 'Das' (Magazin, Das). I tried
to get the names as complete as possible, so some may be at positions you
do not expect (Deluxe Galaga and not Galaga). If you do not find a game try
to find it at another position before telling it does not exist.

The highest size of one file should be around 400'000 bytes so the
collection should also work fine on low-mem machines.

NOTE: If you do not start the AmigaGuide viewer (Multiview, Amigaguide,
...) out of the directory, where the files are located, the links between
the files will not work. (Or you use the Path command to add the path.)

The cheatlists and texts included in this distribution can be used as you
think it makes any sense (this includes the use for making an other cheat
list and redistribution in any possible way). This is because I also took
them out of other sources and I see no sense in trying to protect every-
where available data.
But the compilation of this cheats was a hard work and so this Collection
should not be changed. This means that all text should stay together and
no changes should be made to any of them.
If I included copy protected parts mail me and I will remove them!

I do not state authors name or address for the special cheats in the list
as most time I do not know the author and other times I forgot them. But
when someone made some of the cheats and wants to be in Thanks file,
contact me and I will include you, as you did the work, I only collected it.

For a fee of US 10$ or 10DM it is possible to get the newest version.
Send the money to my snail-mail address (see below).

I also try to upload the newest version to Aminet. (Only if I get some
mail, else I think no user is interested and stop the project.)

New cheats, corrections, additions, reports of typing or grammatical
errors and any suggestion are welcome. Best is to send this to the e-mail
address.
Please tell me the correct game names in the form
	name - additional name - company
. (The additional name mostly exist at adventures.)
