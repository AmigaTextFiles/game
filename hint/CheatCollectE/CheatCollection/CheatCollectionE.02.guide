There is a bug on level five!
If you fall in the water when collecting the weapon icon on the right hand
side, the program goes into a loop.

Finally, to gain high scores, you should be prepared to lose ships
at strategic points - just before the next 10,000 bonus - so you can shoot
things twice and build up your score.

chart for that planet. But remember you've only ten seconds until the
countdown finishes so you have to be quick. This should cause the jump
to move to the selected planet, well outside the 7.2 light year range.

Do you enjoy the amazing rendition of the Blue Danube?	If so, press
<H> to hyperspace, when the counter is 5 or lower, engage the docking
computer, and the Blue Danube will now play till you reach the next
station.

Select the ten minute game and hold down <FIRE> at all times (even when
your player gets the ball). Stop running but keep <FIRE> pressed. The
opposition will immediately slide tackle you. This will almost always
cause them to get fouled. They will be given a yellow card (and eventually
a red one) and eventually be sent off the field. Continue this until there
is only three players left on the opposing team (the goalie and two field
men). You might be able to get more players fouled out, but it may be hard.
You should now have all you players and will be able to run circles around
the opposing team.

@node "Enchanted Castle"
@remark S
You started in a medieval castle without any knowledge about it. You are to
escape the castle. There are three missions you might also want to do to
complete the wholestory of this beautiful text adventure game.

Walkthrough:
East	One of the torch is not firmly attached. Get it. This would be your
	only light source
West	Great Hall.There is a magic word written here. Some other areas
	would bring you back to here whenever this magic word is spoken.
	There are also other magic words. To distinguish it, we would refer
	this as return magic word.
Up,Up	There is a painting here.
	Try to get it. Whoops, it reveals a secret passage to the west
West	Prison cell
	There is nothing much here except for three doors. Only one of them
	appears to be safe. Remember it, because you would go to this part.
	You are trapped. But don't worry, you have the return magic word.
	so... You are back to Great Hall

Try to explore the castle. If your torch is blown out, return to Great Hall,
and east where you can light it again. If you come to a place where there
is a sign "Abandon Ye..." on the west door then north, south, and west would
allow you to pass the west door. If you are ready then:
1. Passing the Bengal tiger
   Go to music room, get oboe, go to wine-cellar room, wash oboe, back to
   menagerie, play oboe. You put him on sleep
2. Clearing the vines in greenhouse
   Go to rotunda, west, west, west. There is a block with blood dripping on
   it. It is mentioned that there are doors to eastern. So there are actually
   three doors. Go to south east to torture chamber. Get secateur. Go to
   green house. Cut vines
3. Passing the dragon
   From green house, north, east, enter crypt. There is a candle here. If
   your torch is unlighted, light it. Now, the southern wall has three doors.
   Choose the one which appears to be safe (remember). Don't forget to
   adjust the orientation. Inside, there is an armor. Get it.
   There is also a magic word to save your game here.
   Return to Great Hall. Go to rotunda, southwest, south. See the candles?
   Blow them. The fireplace to the west open. West, West, Get sword,
   Go to the hall of dragons. Wear armor. Kill dragons
4. To get to other part of castle

   transported to other room.
5. Looking for keys?
   Go to gazebo, get ladder. Transport to the other part of castle. Go to
   cruciform, north. Drop ladder, climb up ladder and you would find a
   statue there. Get statue but don't break it. Down, south, and west.
   You are standing on balcony above the terrace. Throw statue. Smash!
   Return to Great Hall, Go to terrace. Get a set of keys.
6. Passing basilisk
   Go to lord bedroom. Open closet. Now, a basilisk is hiding there.
   Run, You would be safe if you don't run to the room where you come in or
   you don't run to a dead end. To get rid of it, from lord bedroom, north,
   north (cruciform), east. There is a magic word that whenever is spoken
   somewhere else, everything there would be disappeared. So south, and say
   the magic word.
7. Fetching the Star of diamond
   Bring the set of keys with you. Go to lord chamber, south, down until
   you come to the nursery room, west. Notice the furnace? unlock it,
   open it, and you can get the Star
8. Exploring rooms behind hall of dragon
   Go to catacomb east of it. Southeast. Northeast. Keep trying to go to
   northeast until you found a bridge. Cross it. You would find a chained
   troll. If you have the keys with you, unlock it. He would steal the
   keys from you. Unless you have had the star of diamond, you won't need
   them anymore. East, north, west on the edge of a pit. Down. You entered
   a Zimbu house (This one too is just like the basilisk will be after you).
   So grab the book fast. Up, south, south, cross the bridge and burn it.
   There the Zimbu can't swim
9. Rescue the princess from ugliest witch
   Bring the book, go to chapel. Get the cross (witch is afraid of).
   Transport to other room. Go to library. Place book and the bookshelf
   slide over revealing a downward passage. down, down. Northwest, get
   the flask. Southeast, northeast, get the wand. Southwest, down.
   There is a frog there. From infamous story, kiss the frog and the
   frog become a princess. Get princess and she would follow you unless
   you said the return magic word.
10.More rooms to explore
   Go to theatre, west to a den. There is a crack on a floor. If you pour
   the liquid, you would find that there is a room below. So wave the wand.
   Down, down, get box which apparently is a triggered timebomb. Save your
   game here. Go to basilisk closet, down to nursery room, south, throw
   box, north. Wait until it explodes (Take a lot of time). south, northeast,
   west to the fountain of champagne. Fill flask. East (Tearoom), up, south,
   Get the bell.
11.More magic word
   Go to rotunda, west, west, south to the talking skull. This time, it
   gives a very useful advice. The place it mention is the well. Go there.
   (south of garden). Pour champagne. You amused something there. Return
   to the Great Hall, go to hall of dragon, go to catacomb east of it,
   northeast to a river. Fill flask with mineral water. Back to the well
   and pour the water. Listen the magic word carefully
12.Passing the Bengal tiger again
   With wand, go to kitchen, south, and wave it. Presto! delicious food
   appears. Get it. Go to menagerie. Feed tiger
13.Opening your way out
   Get the secateur. Transport to other part of castle. A large mirror is
   standing there. Break it. It allows you to go south, south where you
   find a windlass. This one is used to raise and lower the drawbridge below.
   The windlass is stuck however, so cut the rope. Snap! the drawbridge
   fall down. you are not done yet, need to raise the locked portcullis.
   Back to Great Hall, bring the bell with you, go to menagerie, northeast
   to the room of three. Ring the bell three times. A unicorn would let you
   to take a golden key from it. Go to the entrance, unlock portcullis and
   say the magic word from the well.
14.Last thing
   You have the star diamond and the princess now. You also has opened the
   gate. The last thing is to demolish the castle. Now, go to reception room
   where there is a chandelier is swaying around. Light chandelier. Go to
   stable, burn hay. Oops, you drop your torch. Don't attempt of getting it.
   Instead, run east, east, south, west, south, south to finish this
   incredible game

When you reach a new unexplored plane, take out the disk and kill the
druid. Instead of returning to the village, you will be returned to the
plane you died on. Insert the disk, and start playing again, use this as
many times you want. However, there is a problem with this, you lose all
the spells that you had before, and start the game with the normal
compliment of spells, so you might not last long on later levels, but you
can explore the later levels.

To find secret levels at the start of the game immediately go left to the
desert, then continue left to the fire zone. Head to the uppermost left
corner of this area and you should see lava with a patch on it that looks
like a section of the Firewall spell. As quickly as you can, walk on this

Make two copies of Disk 2 then make up your parties on both disks. Play the
game as usual, but when you find any secret passages or walls, or unlock any
doors, insert the other disk and continue playing for a short while. This
passes all the data onto this disk. Replace the original disk and continue
playing and now, if you get stuck in the game and you have to start again,
simply continue with the other disk and all the doors that were previously
locked will be open. Plus, you'll be able to pick up the keys that you
needed to unlock them as a bonus!

Make sure you draw maps as you go along - secret doors can make things
confusing. If you get stuck, jump down a pit and look for another way
up as you may have missed exploring part of the level. Some pressure
pads can be activated from a distance by throwing objects onto them.
Try to explore seperate parts of the dungeon at a time, and explore them
thoroughly before opening doors onto new unexplored areas. This will
make exploring dungeons easier. When you find some writing and a
character says "What a strange marking to place here", insert a dagger
into the crack in the wall and this will open a secret door. You will
find two skeletons on the earlier levels, both of which you must take.
Later on in the game you will be able to resurrect the dead adventurers,
and they will join your party as NPC's. On level four, help the dwarves
and let Dohrun the Dwarven fighter join your party. You can now visit
the Dwarven Cleric who will heal and/or resurrect characters. Never fight
Rust Monsters hand-to-hand - use missile weapons and long-ranged attack
spells such as MAGIC MISSILE or MELFS ACID ARROW, as their attacks
dissolve a metallic object carried by the character, usually armour or a
weapon. Make sure you put several different races in your party so that
you can read every message found on walls in the dungeon.

Load "EOBDATA.SAV" (Disk 2)into a HEX-Editor.
Start 11 times later than the first letter of your first character's name
with typing HEX "72" 14 times then 2 times "FF". Now do this with all
characters and save.
Now your characters should have stats of 114, and about 120 hit points.

boost it to maximum, regardless of limitation put on the race or class of
the character, so from now on, for example, you can have a super-hard

The keys to use for different buildings are:

Red	- For secret entrances
Gold	- For the maze in Hemsaths tomb and for the inner chambers of King

Blue	- For the sorceresses keep on the Isle of Sorcery
Green	- For normal buildings

When you find the turtle, jump on it and start slashing with your weapon.
The turtle will not be harmed but your bravery will rise.

The best weapon in the game is the sword.

The witch's castle is accessable through the maze of Grimwood forest.
You must enter the maze from the west and make your way north-east. A
cave must also be found. This should take you to the Sunstone. The
Sunstone should be used to kill the witch but this might not work. You
should be able to kill the witch with any missile weapon as long as you
avoid the witch's gaze. After you kill her, you must get the golden
lasso in order to ride the Golden Swan. In the City of Azal, you will
need the five golden statues. These statues are located in: The Crystal
Palace on the Isle of Sorcery, The Battlefield in Grimwood Forest, The
Castle south-east of Marheim, The Watch Tower, and Hemsath's Tomb.

Go the the dark citadel. Stand right up against the force field. Let
yourself starve so that you faint. When you wake up, you'll be on the
other side of the force field

Sometimes you can accumulate all the treasure you want by going near the
item, press <SPACE>, and then continue hitting <T>. You'll receive an
infinite supply of that treasure.

Save your position in a dungeon. Then go through it until you run out of
keys. When you restore your game, all the doors will be open and you will
have a new set of keys. Also works in caves.

On the island with the Crystal Castle, press <RIGHT MOUSE> while talking
to the Sorceress and your luck will go up to 65. 'ASK'ING the Sorceress
several times will usually boost your luck.

If running low on Green keys, use a secret entrance for the fort. It's
on the left side, almost even with the door.

Beating the Turtle is not beating, it is pushing, so push the turtle across
the land, to use it in special places: The turtle was programmed in
asbestos, and can swim in Lava. It can be used to enter the black citadel
at the south. Also, while it is present, you are not attacked, but by the

Level Code description:
The levelcode contains info about number of left lives, weapontype,
ammunition number.

The 8 digit sequence is a union of two 4 digit numbers:
The first one codes the level, the number of lives and the type of weapons
available, and the second one the number of the two ammo types.

Example:
 LevelCode F8F856A5
	   \__/\__/
	     \	 \__ means 99 weapon of type 1 and 28 of type 2
	      \_____ means access to level 2 with gun and 0 lives left

Part two of the code means:
get weapon type 1 (gun and machinegun) in binary mode (99) : 1100011
get weapon type 2 (Rockets)	       in binary mode (28) : 0011100
Put them together : first comes 01, then first number of type 2, then first
number of type 1, then second number of type 2 ... (always take 7 bit
numbers) and you will get 01 -- 01 01 10 10 10 01 01 - This in hexadecimal
56A5 (see above).

Thats why the most useful code (99 and 99) is BC0F (here is the first 10
instead of only 01!!!)

Part one of the code means:
Here are coded the level number, the type of weapons and the number of
lives.
 F8F8 into binary: 1111 1000 1111 1000 with the meaning

 xxxx 100x x11x xxxx
 \__/ \____/  \__/|\_  if 1 you have the machinegun (0 else)
   \	\	\  \__ if 1 you have the rocket launcher (0 else)
    \	 \	 \____ in this triplet is coded the level :
     \	  \		     111 = level 1   110 = level 2   101 = level 3
      \    \		     100 = level 4   011 = level 5
       \    \_________ this is a sort of checksum if the code is valid
	\_____________ in these bits is coded the number of lives you have:
		       1111 = 0 lives, 1110 = 1 life, ..., 0110 = 9 lives

Checksum: Set the two x so, that the first 8 numbers added are even and
the second 8 also, or the first 8 are odd and the second 8 also.
I hope this is right!

In level and live coding you must switch 1 and 0 to get the real number:
1111 are 0 lives : 0 binary is 0000 | 111 is level 1 : 1(-1) is 000
1101 are 2 lives : 2 binary is 0010 | 100 is level 4 : 4(-1) is 011

The complete codes to start a level with all ammo, all weapons, 9 lives are:

Level	1 6D7FBC0F
	2 6DFBBC0F
	3 6C77BC0F

Logoff the net. Press the <BACKSPACE> at the bay doors. Blast off into

Enter the net, logon, and press <T> and <RETURN>.
You should be now in communication mode with the alien. Say hello, have a
chat, keep pressing a key or whatever until he offers you some goods, such
as Hypermint for example. At the prompt, straight after he has offered you
something to buy, enter "1" and press <RETURN>. He will say something like
no chance, or sign off. Logoff.

Now everything you buy or sell, you will buy or sell it for 1 credit, even
if you put 100 credits as an offer, you will still buy or sell it for 1
credit. This only applies to Black Market trading, it will not work at a
planet or space station.

Do same as above but enter a higher number, say "20000" when you want to
sell at a high price. Now, press <T> and <RETURN> to talk to the alien,
make certain that you have got something to sell. Keep pestering him,
until he says something like, "Have you got anything to trade?".
When ask for price enter something, but you get the above set credits

The top routine, is only to be used in buying, as it is no good trying to
buy something, when it is set at 200000?
Likewise, the bottom routine is only used for selling, as you are a bit
stupid if you try to sell your wares for 1 credit!

Advancement in rank has nothing to do with the amount of credits to your
name. It is releated to the number of missions you complete and ships
destroyed. The only way to earn a lot of credits is to haggle on the
trade-net. By staying in the space station on the net, and trading in guns,
food and gold, you will quickly build a fortune.
Travelling to space stations requires you to jump until you cannot get any
further.

To complete the missions:
 1 Take message: just go there! Use E pod.
 2 Destroy aliens, but not unknowns: Kill 4+. Use E pod.
 3 Destroy Sat!
 4 Escort convoy. Use E pod.
 5 Investigate dissepearances. Kill 4+. Use E pod.
 6 Search for survivors.
 7 Escort VIP. Land on planet then go to destination.
 8 Go and report.

Looks easy but it can be very hard if you make a bodge of it early on in the
swing. If you want to keep going swing left to right all the time. Be quick
otherwise Fiendish will snip you to your doom.

Leave the swing an extra turn if you're not sure but don't chicken out too
many times as time is against you. Leave the swing for about four seconds
before you let go at the beginning. Hoops are no problem: just wait until you
see the rope on the other side and then just pretend they weren't there. Make
sure you are swinging upwards when you press fire to let go otherwise you die.

TENSE TRAVEL TECHNIQUES ON TIGHTROPE (TIGHTROPE WALKING):
Make sure you're moving fast otherwise a cannon will make mincemeat out of
you. On the second level start moving out as soon as the screen appears. If you
don't, Freddy will punch you out of the tent, he's that quick! You need to
press fire once in the second level to block the razor blade he throws at you.
In the last level you must need to move across as normal and press fire when
Fiendish Freddy uses the razor blades again. Timing is all important on the
third level. Look at the top left-hand corner and use that view to guide you.

DEADLY AND DANGEROUS DAGGERS OF DEATH (KNIFE THROWING):
Picture the circle as a clock with an hour hand only, as soon as you see the
screen, just move to the outside of the circle and press fire when the balloons
reach the nine til half past nine position. The knife should hit the balloon at
the six o'clock position. The rest is easy, just do that and you will complete
the level easily.

COMBUSTIBLE CANNONS OF COLOSSAL COURAGE (HUMAN CANNON BALL):
For the Human Cannon Ball event all you have to do is count how many handfuls
your curvy assistant puts into the cannon, look it up on the diagram and move
the platform (the crash mat) along to the relevant position and press fire.

Then all you have to do is leave the number of moves the diagram tells you to
(how many positions the cannon has to fall through) and then press fire to send
your Human Cannon Ball on his way.

1 Hand Full  | * |   |	 |   |	 |   |	 |   | Leave 3
2 Hand Fulls |	 | * |	 |   |	 |   |	 |   | Leave 3

Complete Solution:

Part 1

Tell Rod to make the coffee and then get the tapes from the bin. The
tape bin can be found in the cupboard in the secondary control room.
Set the amplifier fader in the control room to a suitable level and
clean the tape heads with the cleaner. Play the tapes in the player
and the producer will storm in and sing the combination to the cabinet
in his office. Get what you find inside it and you've solved the first
part of Fish.

Part 2

Get dressed and pick up the torch from the rubbish in the cab. Head
east untill you get to the Abbey and find your way to the catacombs.
Open the sarcophagus lid and find the ceremonial cord. Go back up to
the ruined transepts and turn off your torch. Drag the pew past the
hippier untill it's beneath the arch; you can climb this by standing on
the pew. Tie the cord and collect the gargoyle. Put it in its right-
ful place. Get the grommet from the chalice to complete part 2. You
may have to do this several times thanks to hippie interference.

Part 3

Time is critical in this part so don't waste any. Go south east to
the smithy and free the budgie. Return to Mickie (mind the bird) and
get the disc from the stump when he leaves. Return to the smithy and
get the tools, gloves and mould. Wear the gloves and place the disc in
the crucible. Hold it in the fire with tongs and pour it in the mould
when it melts. Take this to the cool glade avoiding Mickey and anywhere
wet. Let it cool for a few turns. When this is done smash the mould
with a hammer and lo and behold: HYDROPOLIS!

Here's a way of starting the game with lots of money.

Copy the game onto another disk - files are going to be changed so don't
use the original. Boot up the copy as normal, clicking on the 'FD II'
and 'BOOT.BAS' icons as they appear.

Enter the game as normal. When it's up and running, select the 'QUIT'
option from the Main selection of the pull down menu. A CLI window now
appears. Type "list" to list the 'FOOT.BAS' part of the game.

Using the cursor keys, edit the program lines 1514 and 2547 to read as
follows :

1514 NEXT
NW=150+INT(RND*200)
NW=INT(NW/AP)
NV=200+INT(RND*300)
NV=INT(NV/AP)
AI=5000000pound sign+INT(RND*(500000pound sign/AP))
NF=(5000+INT(RND*3000))/AP
NP=INT(NP+NA+NF)
GOTO 332

2547 GOSUB 2548
IF RA=9 AND AI>300000pound sign OR AI>1500000pound sign THEN ]2547
GOTO 2548
]2547: RA=INT(AI/5000)
PRINT TAB(5);
PA5
PRINT "DIRECTORS WITHDRAW";
PA1	    "
PRINT TAB(30);
MONEY INT(RA)
PRINT TAB(38);"-"
JR=JR-RA

In line 1514 making AI equal 5,000,000 provides $5M starting budget; this
can be changed to suit, however Line 2547 making RA=INT(AI/5000) stops the
directors from withdrawing too much cash every week.

Click on the 'close window' icon for the window containing the program
text, and save the amended program file by typing: save "FOOT.BAS"

To run the amended disk, boot up the disk as normal, by clicking on the
FD II icon. When the BOOT.BAS icon is clicked the message BAD FILE MODE
appears. Accept this by using the OK box.
Close the CLI window containing the few lines of text, by clicking on the
close window icon.

Type "load". A message box appears prompting for the name of the program
to load. Using <LEFT MOUSE> click on the text bar and type this: FOOT.BAS

When the OK message appears, type "RUN". The program should now start as
normal with plenty of dosh to spend.

On the menu selection, hold down <CTRL> and <C> to interupt the program.
Now enter "AI=AI+500000" and press <RETURN>. Now type "CONT" and press
<RETURN>. This adds 500,000 credits to your current amount.

When taking part in a non-championship race, drive around until you are on
the last lap. When you next come to the pits, drive in and pull up to your
pit crew. Wait there until the "Race Over" message appears, and no matter
what postition you were in, you will have won the race.

On the last lap go into the pits, apply your brakes and press <ESC> to quit
the race. Accelerate the time, and you should if you were close enough to
the leading pack, win the race.

Slip into the pits after your first lap and then simultaneously hold down the
keys that make up the word "PALIR" and press <FIRE>. Not only will you be
unable to crash but the game will not react as though you have pressed <F4>.

If you select a system around 650 light years away from your
position you will get an in range fuel reading allowing you to make
jumps of that distance making things much easier on long hauls.

Dongles and Other Strange Beasts
There have been reports of problems with Frontier on an Amiga if a dongle
occupies the 2nd joystick port. If you cannot control your ship because it
starts to spin uncontrollably remove the dongle and try again.

Ships In System Maps
Ships are marked in the system map as little crosses in the color in which
the ships would appear on the scanner. Your own position is marked with a
purple dot regardless of the type of your ship and your hyperjump cloud
will be marked with a blue dot. You will see the blue dot also for the
hyperjump clouds of ships that you had selected before they jumped out of
the system. Sometimes it is even possible to use your cloud analyzer on
such clouds. You can not center the map relative to ship marks.

Planet Selection
A planet or station can only be selected if it is annotated with its name.
This annotation is only performed when the game assumes that the object is
clearly visible. The heuristic that is used for this decision sometimes
fails badly. Therefore some planets can only be selected if the system is
zoomed and rotated until the observer's position is near the planet. Try it
with Pluto in Sol [0, 0]. It really is selectable!

Autopilot
Your autopilot tries to fly to your target in a straight line. If there is
a planet between you and your target, the autopilot will happily try to
fly through the planet, crashing you in the process.

If you don't want to risk crashes because of high gravity or other mishaps
that could confuse your autopilot you should always land using time
acceleration at least at level 2. If you don't watch it too closely your
autopilot definitely performs better.

Docking
Docking your ship in a space station without causing damage can become a
quite complicated task for large ships. You have to remember that your
forward view from a ship like the Panther Clipper is not centered in the
ship but instead you look out of your forward window that may be high
above the center axis of your ship. As a result you have to aim not at the
middle of the docking bay of a station but at a point somewhere in the
upper half of the back wall of the dock. One nicely working trick is to
use the outside view to look at your ship from a point in front of it and
align your ship such that you look at it from within the station and it
keeps well clear of the dock walls. In a station you may keep your landing
gear up to keep your ship as small as possible.

Initial Trading
As a beginner you will want to make fast cash to be able to buy a better
ship that brings you to all the wonders of the universe. You can earn your
money with trading. As a beginner you should choose a trading route where
there is no risk of being attacked by pirates. Sol and Barnard are two
such systems. You can carry luxury goods from Sol to Barnard and robots
back. Sell all of your initial equipment you don't need, to make room for
merchandise. You won't need missiles, laser or your scanner. As soon as
you have left Merlin (on Ross 154) you can sell your atmospheric shielding
too at the next starport, if you avoid planets with atmosphere in the
future. On the route between Sol and Barnard this will pose no problem,
because there are enough space stations in either system. Be sure to check
the bulletin board when you bring robots to Sol. Very often you can get a
better price there than on the stock market.

You cannot afford Luxury Goods or Computers in the very beginning. Carry
Fruit and Vegetables to Barnard instead until you have enough cash to
switch to more profitable goods. Buy a bigger ship as soon as you have
enough money to pay it AND enough cash to buy some initial cargo for your
new ship too.

Another good route in imperial space has been reported to be Facece to
Vequess and back. You can perform military missions on one way and carry
slaves back, if you don't mind the moral implications.

Crew Members
Every day at midnight the bulletin board is updated and may show new
potential crew members.
It is a very bad idea to fire someone of your crew. Your reputation will
suffer badly. If you repeat this several times, it will take you a very
long time (sometimes years!) to hire crew members again.

Passengers
Passengers want to be delivered to their destination in one month or less.
If they get impatient, they will tell you so, leave at the next starport
and refuse to pay. The main problem is, that your reputation will suffer
badly and future passengers may even refuse to be transported by you. You
can persuade them sometimes by asking several times. You should be careful
with passengers that tell you, that they owe someone money. They will most
probably refuse to pay at the destination port. For some systems you need
a permit to enter. The only way to get a permit is to transport a
passenger or parcel to such a system. The people that give you military
missions assume that you already have a permit.

Charity
If you give money to charity, you will get a better reputation and people
will trust you more. This means that you can get 10% more money for
deliveries, get all or part of the money in advance and more people will
want to work for you (?). Your reputation will also grow if you succeed
with passenger transports without receiving too much damage to your ship.
Therefore giving away your money is not really necessary if your
reputation is not too bad for passengers to accept you carrying them.

Dumping Radioactives
One way to get rid of the radioactive waste from military drives is to
dump it into space right out of your cargo bay. If you are in a system
where a strong police force is watching, this can get you in trouble even
if you dump directly after your jump into the system. In such systems you
should simply sell your waste or (if radioactives are illegal) find a
reliable merchant on the black market who takes it back.

You can have loads of fun if you try a few highly illegal dumping
places. A space port is a very nice place to dump your waste on. Some
people prefer to dump their radioactives into the still open landing bay
of an underground spaceport. You can even fling your waste into a long
range cruiser that waits outside of some space stations. Of course you can
do the same with mines for the thrill of finally seeing a mine hit
something!

There seem to exist systems where you can get real money for your
radioactives. Look out for systems in the state of civil war. Sometimes
you can sell your radioactives there on the black market.

Countryside Landing
Lower your speed and raise your nose until you fall with approx. 3 m/s.
When you are down to 10-15 m, cut your speed to 0 and align your nose with
the horizon. Don't forget to lower you landing gear!

Mining
Select a system with little or no registered settlers, look for an unnamed
planet above 0 degrees and below 200 degrees without a starport or station
and unload your MB4. Wait a few months and land near your mining
equipment. Pick it up and leave. If you try again at the same place you
will find less and the third time you will find nothing. This is not
dependent on the time you let your machine work or the amount of minerals
the machine has produced. Only the number of trials counts.

A builtin camera (you get it for your first reconnaissance mission) does
not prevent you from using the mining machines. Just use the camera icon
in the near of the mining machine. Frontier will know, that you don't want
to take pictures.

Fuel Scoop from a Gas Giant
Autopilot to the target, aim at the horizon and set your speed to 15,000
km/h. Use time acceleration and decelerate to keep the target tunnel
frames coming at constant speed; when the atmosphere gets visible, aim for
the middle and reduce your speed to 4000 km/h, go back to normal time. The
fuel scoop will first fill up the cargo space and then the internal tanks.

Fighting
There seem to exist a lot of misunderstandings with respect to fighting.
The first one is, that your movement vector has to point to your enemy to
move towards him. This is not true. Your movement vector is shown as the
vector of your movement with respect to the currently selected reference
mass. This is totally insignificant for a fight, because there only the
relative velocities of the fighting ships count. This also means, that you
don't have to decelerate for a fight. Your attacker will have a similar
velocity vector as you or he wouldn't stay in your vicinity for long.

Important are the tiny differences in your movement vectors that result in
movements of your ships relative to each other. If you both fly parallel
with 10,000 m/s in the same direction and accelerate towards each other,
this will have the same effect as when you don't move at all and
accelerate towards each other. What counts is the resulting relative
movement. To make a long story short: Simply ignore your displayed
velocity during a fight. It doesn't matter at all!

What does count is your velocity relative to the attacking ships. You
cannot measure it directly, but you can select an attacking ship and watch
the distance change to get an estimate of your velocity. This is the only
velocity information that helps you to maneuver during a fight.

* Always switch your engines off while fighting and use mouse direction
control and acceleration/deceleration buttons for maneuvering.
* Ignore the indication of your velocity vector. It is insignificant for a
fight.
* Be careful not to shoot yourself with your own turret mounted lasers.
* If you attack a ship with your front laser, aim 5 deg past it,
accelerate until near, decelerate and follow accelerating while it flies
by. Shoot it from behind.
* You can shoot incoming missiles: evade with full thrusters, u-turn,
select with annotation (to make the missile visible) and shoot.

I have developed a standard sequence for fighting that uses a little
cheating to compensate for the very poor HUD and the bad interface to the
functions you need during a fight:

* When the attack warning comes up, stop time.
* Switch off your engines.
* Select the outside view of your ship and zoom out as far as possible.
* Switch on the id labels to identify the attacker.
* Move the outside view until the attacker rotates into your view.
* Select the attacker and activate your radar scanner to get type and
damage info.
* Remember the position of the attacker on your scanner.
* Switch back to the front view.
* Restart time.
* If you use your front laser, rotate your ship to face the attacker and
use your engines to accelerate at the same time to evade the initial
attack.
* Perform any maneuvers necessary and shoot to get rid of the attacker.
* Select the system map and reselect your initial target.

Some players find it sufficient to use the id labels, so they don't have
to deselect the original flight target and select the attacker. I found
the distance information the selection provides very helpful
though. Especially when I have to use a powerful laser economically
because it can be fired only a limited time until it overheats and needs
time for cooling.

Military Missions
Be careful not to accept military missions that clearly cannot be finished
in time. You will have to look at the destination starsystem, estimate
your travelling time through hyperspace and the time you need in the
target system to reach your destination. A good distance estimate is to
add 10 AU to the orbital distance of your destination. If your destination
is orbiting another planet use the orbital distance of this planet instead
and add the orbital distance of your destination to the result.

If you don't get missions from your local military agent, don't despair.
Often it is sufficient to change the starport in the same system to get
missions. If all else fails and you don't want to change the base for your
military career, simply make a small hyperspace jump out of the system and
back. In the mean time your military agent may have changed his mind. If
he still has nothing to do for you you should ask yourself a few
questions. Would you give someone like you military missions? For whom
have you worked in the past? Are you really trustworthy? See, you know the
reason!

Assassination
* Always save the game before accepting a contract.
* Don't arrive in your target system too early. If the police has enough
time to investigate, the victim will be warned. This makes it very
difficult to finish a contract in systems like 61 Cygni [-1, 1] or
Omicron Eridani [2, 0] where you have to travel 40 AU or more to the
next station. Don't even think about a mission for Alpha Centauri [0, 0]
or Cegreth [-1, -3]. Such missions can only be accomplished if you
cheat. For details see the Autopilot Break below. It seems to be ok. to
arrive at the target system about one week before contract time.
* Don't wait too long in front of the target station or port, the victim
may get frightened and refuse to start. 15 minutes before contract time
seems ok.
There seems to be a way to force victims out of a station if they refuse
to start. If you attack the station, the launch bay must be cleared for
the police vipers. If your victim is in the station, he/she will be in
the launch bay and get forced to start as soon as you attack the
station.
* Don't wait directly in front of the station, the victim may run into
you.
* Don't wait directly above a star port. If the launch bay doesn't close
after your start, your victim cannot start.
* You should never try to watch the take off of your victim in accelerated
time. In most cases your victim will sneak past you while you are
dreaming your time away and be gone before you even know it.
* Don't attack too close to a star port or station, the victim may try to
land again.
* If you have to attack near a star port, don't use missiles too early. If
you do, your victim might try to evade the missile and crash in the
process. If your victim kills himself, you failed.
* You can use missiles to prevent the victim from hyperjumping while you
attack. If you fire a missile before you use your lasers, the local
authorities will charge you only 600 credits for illegal weapon usage.
Otherwise you will get fined 10,000 credits for piracy and murder.
One very nice attack method based on this trick is to wait at some
planet far from your destination until you can spot your victim on the
system map. As soon as it appears, target it and fire a missile. This is
already sufficient to prevent your victim from hyperjumping and you can
approach now and do what you came for.
* If the victim hyperjumps, use a cloud analyzer and simply follow. Select
the arrival cloud and wait until the victim arrives or you can be sure
it made a misjump. If you are not fast enough to overtake your victim on
the direct route, you can always use a wormhole route that is nearly
always faster. A drawback of the wormhole route is, that your entry
point of the target system may be far away from the entry point of your
victim.
* If you are too far from your victim when he or she starts, use the
system map and watch for a ship mark on the map that belongs to your
victim. Select it and proceed as usual. You can verify your selection
via communication. Don't call, just verify the registration number.
* If you have more than one assassination on your list, collect the money
for the first one before you try the next. Your employer seems to
actively look for you to pay you and spreads rumors of your profession
in the process. This obviously warns other victims.

With these points in mind I have succeded with every contract (civil or
military) that I have accepted so far. In every case a victim didn't show
up I could find a reason from the list above and succeeded in the next
trial.
On the other hand there have been reported lots of problems with victims
not showing up or refusing to land at the port of destination. Some of
these problems seem to stay even if you use every trick in the book. In
such a case your only chance is to reload a saved game from the time
before you accepted the contract.

Reconnaissance Missions
One problem with such missions is, to find your target at all. It should
work if you approach the planet until it nearly fills your screen. If the
military base is visible, you should see it as a grey pixel that can be
selected. If you don't see it, fly to the back of the planet or simply
wait a few hours (in accelerated time) until the planet rotates the base
into your view. The maximum distance to take pictures from is about 80 km.
You get excellent pictures if you fly below 10 km. One nicely working
method for an approach is:

* Use autopilot and maximum time acceleration until you arrive in the
"vicinity of the planet".
* Use time acceleration 3-4 and 50,000 km/h to fly to 7000-8000 km
distance.
* Orbit the planet and lock on the target when it is at the horizon.
* Save the game.
* Aim a little below the horizon and descend to 1000-3000 m.

On planets with high gravity this is the most difficult part. I always
save a game before actually reaching the planet so I can try different
routes to the target station. The problem on planets with high gravity
is, that you don't get height information until you cannot decelerate
anymore in time to avoid a crash. You have to approach such planets very
carefully. Another problem is, that you can control you descent only via
the velocity readings because you cannot see your actual velocity vector
or the target tunnel with your nose up high enough to make a controlled
descent to your target. You can aim at your target with your nose up, if
you use the outside view.
* Continue towards your target with 10,000 km/h and time acceleration 2
until your distance is down to 200 km.
* Decelerate to 5,000 km/h and switch off time acceleration.
* From a distance of 80 km downwards you can take pictures. I usually fly
between the towers or a small distance above. After you have taken the
pictures, accelerate with full power and make your escape.
* After having taken my pictures I often pick a few interesting enemies
and practice my fighting skills before jumping out of the system.

A few times I managed to rough land between the buildings of a target
station. The stations don't seem to have a starport, but only a hangar out
of which the interceptors start. It is interesting to watch them
materialize in front of this hangar (and crash shortly afterwards).
Reconnaissance missions to imperial stations are most difficult, because
you are attacked by Imperial Couriers with 20 MW lasers. For my Asp with
up to 10 shields this means that you are history with only one direct
hit. If you fly very low between the buildings of a target station you
must be extremely careful, not to be rammed by an enemy ship that suddenly
appears directly in front of you.

Bombing Missions
If you have succeeded with reconnaissance missions and shot a lot of
excellent pictures you will find bombing missions very boring. You can
fire your nuclear missile from 500 km distance or even more without
adverse effects if the station lies within your line of sight. The crater
that replaces the station after a successful attack is no hole in the
ground. It hovers above the planet just where the station used to be. If
you rough land at the position of the station you land actually below the
crater. Very strange...

Ratings
If you want to improve your combat rating fast, there is one simple trick.
Buy a Panther Clipper and equip it with about 300 shield generators. It is
nearly invincible now. Select a system with lots of pirates. Anarchies are
very nice and some dictatorships also work very well. Jump into the system
and switch off your engines. Accelerate time to the maximum and wait for
the pirates to come. When they arrive, simply wait. They will crash into
you and you will get the bonus for destroying them. Only one ship can get
dangerous to you and this is the Imperial Courier which is very often
equipped with a 20 MW laser. Fight this one and do it carefully because
once this gun starts to hit you, your shields will degrade very fast and
you don't have the engine power to evade quickly.

After you have cleaned up the system, jump to a neighbor system and back
or still better, simply jump to another anarchy. Repeat until you run out
of fuel, are bored too much or have advanced to ELITE after 6000 destroyed
ships.

As soon as you get reconnaissance missions from the military, you can
advance even faster. Pick a mission to a station on a planet with low
gravity and fly towards it. From approximately 500 km downward you can
watch interceptors start continuously. All you have to do is to reduce
your velocity or switch off your engines and wait until they start
crashing into you. In the near of imperial stations it is not as easy,
because you will have to actively fight the attacking Imperial Couriers
that would cut you into pieces otherwise. They are quite easy to destroy,
if you adapt your course until they approach you in a straight line. Then
you can activate the autopilot and fire as soon as they are in range. As
long as you move to follow one of the Imperial Couriers the others are
usually too clumsy to hit you hard enough to cause damage. Other ships can
safely be ignored. They will crash into you from time to time or reduce
your shields a few percent if they hit you with their lasers. Keep well
above the planet to avoid crash landings.

You can accelerate all this still further if you use an energy bomb to wipe
out a lot of enemies with one keypress. This works most satisfactory if you
are surrounded by lots of police vipers after some little disagreements
with the local authorities.

Sling shot
Aim just past a large gas giant and get fast enough (700 km/s for
Jupiter). Switch off your engines and watch. Speed and distance are
critical. You will have to practice a bit to get the feeling.

Sightseeing
You can fly through all the domes on planets without a breathable
atmosphere and land between the buildings. If you do this for the
transparent domes at Ross 154 you will find in one dome administration
buildings of Vega Line, Sirius Corporation and other trading houses and in
the second dome the usual combination of concrete blocks and green patches
in between with scattered brick houses. It is definitely fun to fly
between the buildings and look at your surroundings. Agriculture domes are
a bit boring, because they contain nothing more than lots of green balls
at ground level.
Domes that are not tranparent, can be entered too but contain absolutely
nothing. It is interesting, that they are no obstacle for you though. At
least they are good for some very strange graphical effects if you land in
one of these domes and use your outside view to look at your surroundings.

In every major city with more than the space port and a little industry you
can find little churches with working clocks. The cities are structured as
large blocks of ugly concrete buildings and patches of green between them
with scattered brick houses and every now and then a little church. Try to
rough land in the vicinity of such a church and watch the clock on the
church steeple. Use time acceleration for better effect. If you are close
enough you can even read the roman numbers on the clock face. The buildings
give you an interesting impression of the size of your ship. A Cobra MK III
looks huge compared with this tiny little church. And have you ever seen a
huge space ship standing in the graveyard behind a church? It looks
definitely strange.

At some time in the future I will look for one of the bridges you can see in
the intro sequence of the game. This will be my last action before voluntary
retirement. A kind soul already gave me the tip to look in the near of New
San Francisco on Earth, Sol [0, 0]. Do you really want me to retire?

Other Galaxies
If you use the galactic view and zoom out of the galaxy you can see lots
of other galaxies that are arranged in a regular grid. These galaxies are
all copies of your home galaxy, so it is really not worth the effort to
try and find wormhols to distant galaxies. There is only one galaxy and a
lot of mirror images.

Thargoids
A lot of oldtimers from the era of the original Elite game still remember
the menace of the Thargoids and miss them in Frontier. Nobody has seen a
Thargoid in Frontier yet but in an interview David Braben shall have told
that there is a single Thargoid ship in a system far out in the galaxy. I
personally think this is only a trick to keep us playing Frontier until
add-ons appear. But who knows?

If you fly bombing missions to federal bases you can sometimes see two big
violet octagonal ships that look just like the good old Thargoid ships but
they are not disturbed by your approach. Perhaps the Thargoids sleep for a
few hundred years after the exhausting fight with mankind?

Enemies One At a Time
Maximum time acceleration will separate groups of ships to get them in
line, waiting for you.

Perfect Autopilot
Your autopilot always succeeds if you use maximum time acceleration.

Planet Landing Without Fuel
While you still have fuel, use the autopilot to align with your target
planet, switch to maximum time acceleration and wait for the landing
sequence. Switch back to maximum time acceleration and you are save.

Zero Time Shooting from Gun Turrets
If an attacker approaches, get him in sight of a laser turret, stop time,
select the attacker, aim the laser and test fire (you see the blue or the
explosion light effect if you hit). Keep firing while releasing the time
stop. Repeat if necessary.

Missile Fire While Docked
You can fire missiles even from within a space station. This might help in
case of the passenger/no crew problem described in the Bugs / Bugs
section.

Certain Missile Hit
Switch to maximum time acceleration after firing the missile. Your missile
will hit even if you use a nuclear missile and/or have 900 km distance to
your target.

Selling Ship With Passenger
If you sell a ship with passenger on board you get the money and keep the
ship (and the passenger). This bug seems to be fixed in the 1.05 version
of the game for the Amiga and in the American PC version.

Engine Upgrade for Imp Courier or Imp Trader
The only way to get an upgrade for the non-removable engine in an Imperial
Courier or an Imperial Trader seems to be to let it fail due to
maintenance neglection and then put in a new engine. The new engine will
be fixed just as the original drive. To let time pass in a controlled way
select a route between two star systems an perform lots of jumps. If you
select Barnard <-> Sol, you can sell all your equipment except for the
autopilot and load your ship with fuel for the jumps. After 10 or 11
months you should stop jumping around to avoid a misjump. The few
remaining days you can simply wait outside a station until your drive
falls off.

Autopilot Break
You can activate the autopilot for immediate deceleration from arbitrary
high velocities in the vicinity of your selected target, if you use
maximum time acceleration.

Crash Avoidance
Assume you have to perform a mission on some planet, reached it and find
out that you are too fast to be able to decelerate in time to avoid a
crash landing. What can you do? The correct way is to watch the crash,
reload a previously saved game and try again. The Frontier way is to use
time acceleration to avoid the crash. Simply switch to maximum time
acceleration just before the crash. You will make a big jump through the
planet and be safe at some distance at the other side.

This is not really a bug but more or less a consequence of the
implementation of time acceleration. Collisions are detected if your ship
collides with an object at a given time frame of the simulation. When you
accelerate time these time frames are farther apart and so are your
positions in space if you are moving. If your position at one time frame
is above a planet and at the next time frame on the other side of the
planet Frontier will not detect the collision that should have happened in
between.

Fast Ascent to ELITE
You can use the properties of time acceleration to acsend to ELITE status
very fast, once you get foto or bombing missions. Just buy a Panther with
lots of shields, get yourself an imperial foto or bombing mission and stop
about 10 km above the target station. Next destroy all ships in your
near. You can use your turrets and the zero time shooting feature to
achieve this. Now you can select the first level of time acceleration. The
ships that now start from the station fly directly into your shields and
are destroyed. The only thing you have to watch very carefully is your
height above the planet. You can expect a 'right on commander' message
every 7 to 10 minutes. These messages reset time acceleration, so you will
have to destroy all ships in your near again and select time acceleration
until the next message comes up. After a few hours of work you will have
advanced to ELITE status.
You can not use higher time acceleration levels because then the destroyed
interceptors are not counted.

Negotiations With The Police
If you have been caught selling or buying illegal goods or having them on
board, the police will fine you. If the officer is not corrupt, you can
always lower your fine to the original amount if you claim you "haven't
done it".

Most of the bugs can be circumvented in one or another way. The only bug
that really annoyed me is the crash that happens after you have unloaded a
mining machine and leave the system (PC only). This bug makes the mining
part of the game unplayable and should have been found if the game had
been beta tested at all. The many program confusions and crashes during
heavy fights are a nuisance that can only be partially avoided with
frequent game saving.

* The german translation is a complete mess. Most of the time it gives you
crippled nonsense texts and hides important information in a ruined
screen layout. Game and manuals are full of spelling errors and
sometimes you have to translate text back to English to be able to
understand it at all.

* The protection scheme sometimes gets confused and asks for the first
letter of e. g. page 8238,line 27764, word 29263.

* The attack and missile warnings and the "photograph taken" message stay
on the screen much too long, hiding vital scanner information. In case
of an attack warning you can stop time as soon as the warning is given,
select the attacker and start normal time again. The warning is
sometimes repeated, but then you already have some hints about the
position of the attacker.

* In some systems (mostly large systems with more than one sun, e. g.
Cegreeth [-1, -3]) the reference mass selection is broken and will not
switch to the nearest planet or station. In some cases it is sufficient
to avoid the autopilot and fly by hand. In some systems even this does
not work (because of discretization problems if the reference mass is
too far away?) and the target will jump around wildly. Sometimes it
helps not to use maximum time acceleration or fly by hand. If this does
not help either:

1. Avoid such systems.
2. If you absolutely have to dock or land in such a system use the
	autopilot to accelerate under maximum time acceleration, switch off
	your engines until you are 1-2 AU from your target and reactivate
	autopilot (still under maximum time acceleration) to decelerate and
	teleport to your target.
3. If 2. fails, try again from another angle.

Reconnaissance missions to such systems are very difficult, because you
cannot use the teleport-and-decelerate trick. Furthermore the drawing
of the target planet gets totally inconsistent with the drawing of the
station to be filmed, resulting in "flying" stations that seem to be
located above the planet and other strange effects that make navigation
by hand a matter of pure luck. I got such missions to
Micanex C,Da [3, -4] and Hoethan A,B3b [3, -5].

* Bombing missions for systems like Candaess [2, -4] lead to problems
too. You cannot hit the flying station above Candaess A,B1b because the
nuclear missile seems to have a fixed velocity between 15,000 and 25,000
km/h. Because the gravitation reference is never switched to the planet,
you have to adjust your velocity relative to Candaess C,D. In my case I
had to select around 28,000 km/h to be able to approach the station at
all. Whenever I fired my missile it somehow decelerated and never
reached the station. The only trick that worked was to fire the missile
from a distance around 900 km and use the missile-hit feature/bug to
destroy the station. You can do this only from a great distance because
you are unable to switch to full time acceleration if the interceptors
are near you.

* In systems with a central supergiant, the simulation of this sun is
broken. In the Betelgeuse system [59, 14] I got no gravitational effect
of the central sun and could fly right through it. The displayed disk
sometimes transformed into a rotating rectangle (e. g. at 1.39 AU
distance) and sometimes vanished completely (e. g. at 0.8 AU distance).
The supergiant was never selected as reference mass.

* If you are near a planet that was not selected as reference mass (see
above), you can watch the same effects for this planet as have been
described for supergiants.

* Sometimes the scanner may fail without damage report. All systems seem
to be ok., but the scanner doesn't show the attacking ships. It has been
reported that you can fly through these ghost ships without damaging
them or you. This seems to happen mostly in the near of the famous
"flying" stations above planets that have not been selected as reference
mass. The attacking ships also fire at you but seem to be unable to hit.

* Be careful not to accept delivery missions to systems without bases or
spacestations. You might not be able to deliver.

* You sometimes get reconnaissance or bombing missions from the military
that are impossible to accomplish, because there is no planet in the
denoted system. These missions are cancelled as soon as you select them
but they stay in the mission list.

* If you are stuck in an underground base but have enough fuel and your
engines are ok., there is no safe way to start but you can try out a few
alternatives that have been reported to work in some cases:

1. Use maximum time acceleration just after you have got launch
	permission. When you get the message that your launch time expired,
	switch to maximum time acceleration again.
2. Build up a little motion, pull up your landing gear and use maximum
	time acceleration to warp through the wall.
3. Buy lots of shields and fly through the wall.
4. Perform takeoff as if all were normal (up gear, increase throttle,
	pull up nose) this might result in your ship starting normally.

For some of these methods a few retries might help (save the game before
you try anything!). If nothing else helps, select a target for a
hyperjump and force a misjump via <ALT> + <F8>.

* Some versions of the game for the Amiga don't allow you to jump into the
van Maanens [0, 1] system. Neighbor systems are reachable without
problem, the star map shows the system as reachable but you cannot
trigger the hyperjump to van Maanens.

* On planets with a breathable atmosphere you are sometimes cleared for
landing on pads that are already occupied by other ships that seem to
have landed far from their destination pad.

* Mountains are sometimes placed directly on the landing pads of a
starport on planets with a breathable atmosphere.

* Sometimes a starport is reported to be busy even if there are free
landing pads and no incoming ship exists that may have been assigned to
the pad.

* If you do not have enough crew and a fugitive passenger on board,
someone might attack you from outside a station, preventing time
acceleration to wait for enough crew and (through the passenger) also
the selling of your ship. The only way to solve this dilemma seems to be
to use the missile bug to shoot the attacker from inside the station (?).

* The autorefuel system may magically empty your internal tanks if you try
to fill them by hand. I had this effect in a Panther Clipper once even
without the autorefuel system.

* When a passenger gets impatient waiting to be delivered and leaves at
the next starport, you get cabins that are falsely reported occupied,
preventing you from selling your ship or using the cabin again. The only
way out of this situation seems to be to buy an escape capsule and use
it at the next opportunity. You will lose your ship but you can at least
buy a new one.

* If you have more than one MB4 mining machine, you must always deal with
the last one on your list first. If you by accident destroy or even sell
another one first, the game crashes (?).

* Do not leave a system with mining gear left behind. The game will crash.
This seems to be a problem that appears only in the PC version. As in
the missile fire bug on the Panther this is a bug in the EMS handling
that hits you whenever you hyperjump.

* If, as a result of your asteroid mining operation, many objects appear
in your neighborhood, the game may crash (?).

* You have not fulfilled a killing contract if your victim crashes.

* If you fly towards the horizon of a planet, strange graphical effects
may happen, showing pie slices of the planet flashing everywhere. Also
the horizon may jump wildly up and down.

* The same effect happens if you are in the midst of a fight at the right
height above a planet. Your enemies will wildly jump around making them
impossible to hit. Interesting enough they don't seem to have the same
problems.

* You can fly through mountains, transparent domes, buildings and the
walls of spaceports.

* On some star ports ships of contract targets seem to be unable to start
without crash. This happens preferably on planets with gravity
comparable to earth gravity or higher. Example: Lion Transport in
Manchester City on Matthews World in Behoqu [2, -4]. The only workaround
I have found is to avoid contracts to such targets.

* The height calculations are broken on some planets, e. g. on Hoopers
World in 82 Eridani, where I got a distance reading of 0.65 km for a
target that was at the starport (not yet started!) and my height was
shown as 2345 meters. Another example is Mitterand's World in
Liabeze [2, -4].

* For the upper gun turret on the Tiger Trader at elevation angles above
50 deg, 5 MW beams fill the whole lower screen or strange crossing beams
are shown, hiding possible targets.

* Missiles that are fired from a Panther Clipper crash immediately without
hitting anything except the own ship. This makes many bombing missions
impossible to accomplish with a Panther. The bug only appears after
hyperspace jumps (EMS access on the PC) and you can avoid it if you dock
at a station or land at a starport before you try to fire a missile. You
can shorten the extra time you need for this if you use the Autopilot
Break to reach the point of your intermediate landing as early as
possible. This makes bombing missions to systems with spaceports
possible but still leaves a lot of impossible cases.

* The trajectory drawing for planets or stations shown in the system map
sometimes gets confused and draws straight lines from one point of the
trajectory to the screen border.

* A jump into the Beta Lyrae system [-146, 85] crashes the game.

* The attempt to get system info for the Andolqu system [-76, 29] crashes
the game.

* If you select system info for an unexplored system, you get the info for
the last selected explored system.

* If you select population info for an unexplored system, the game may
crash.

* Sometimes you may get a starport reported to be located on a sun. While
being docked at Gilmour Orbiter in Tau Ceti, system info showed a
starport on the sun Exbephi B [-1225, -853]. The starport vanished when
I jumped into the system. Also a population of 100,000 to 1 Million was
reported for Ethfala [-2174, -879] which is a binary system without
planets!

* If you recenter the star map to your position you will still get the
system info of the system you looked at before recentering until you
have moved the cursor away from your current system and back.

* Sometimes a selected star is not surrounded with the green circle at the
position of the star but at the wrong end of the pin which shows the
system's height with respect to the galactic ecliptic.

* The ships section of the documentation contains at least 19 errors.

* The masses of Panther, Kestrel and Hawk do not add up to the total mass
of 1775t, 20t and 18t respectively.

* The reverse thrusters of the Eagle MkII are way too weak to be meant
this way. The available 4g should probably be 14g.

* If you switch between the status screens of your display, your ship may
get drawn erroneously on the contract list page.

* In the repair section of the shipyard, hull damage is not measured
relative to the actual hull weight and can exceed the actual hull weight
by a large amount.

* After a heavy fight the repair section of the shipyard may get confused.
I once got as a damage report the message of the police officer that
arrests you if you haven't paid your fines. The repair costs were 26315
credits.

* Another effect in a similar situation produced damage reports for all my
thrusters that kept reappearing at each entry of the repair screen even
after repair. Save and restore of the game didn't help. I had to return
to a saved game from before the fight.

The effect can be reproduced if you buy a new ship and immediately buy a
new drive for it. If you now enter the repair screen, all your
thrusters are reported to be damaged. You can try to repair them with
very strange effects that cause repaired thrusters to get damaged from
the repair of other thrusters. If you have succeeded with the repair and
no thruster is reported damaged anymore, you will get the old damage
reports again the next time you enter the repair screen.

The effect can be ignored and will vanish after you have refueled and
taken off to the next starport.

* You can get game crashes during a fight. A few times I got strange beeps
from the speaker in my PC that got lower and lower until the game froze.
The exect situation was a fight where I was receiving damage by an enemy
laser when he was hit by my front laser simultaneously.

* The ejection system may be triggered if you try to rough land with a
large ship (?).

* If you crash during a failed attempt to rough land, the game may crash
with a memory exception.

* The system map allows centering on planets only if the planet is
annotated with its name. The annotation sometimes happens only shortly
before the planet vanishes from the screen. For some planets it is very
difficult to find a rotation/zooming combination that works, for some
planets like Phiagre A,B2 [1, -3] I have not yet found a setting that
makes the planet selectable.

* When you have docked at a station using maximum time acceleration, the
system map still shows your position outside the station.

* If you hyperjump while traffic control is warning you you will get a
final warning message and a fine from the star system you jump into.

* In early versions of the game for the Amiga there is a bug that may
confuse the bulletin board that then shows parts of the stockmarket
section. One trick to avoid this problem is to always return to the top
of the bulletin board before leaving it. If the damage is done, you can
accelerate time to wait until midnight. The bulletin board will then be
reset and corrected.

* The manual states that the game is completely playable via keyboard, but
I have not found an equivalent to a right mouse click on the keyboard.
Therefore rotation control for the system and sector maps seems to be
dependent on the mouse.

* A mouse click that misses a function icon or the scanner display in the
lower part of the screen deselects the current target. As a consequence
you often have to reselect your target only because you missed some icon
by a small amount.

* Released mouse keys sometimes keep autorepeating.

* The joystick cannot be calibrated and is way too imprecise (even with a
high quality joystick) on a 40MHz 386 PC.

* If the system map would follow the events outside, you could watch your
progress in the map without having to switch repeatedly between main
view and map.

* It should be possible to center the system map relative to a displayed
ship.

* There should be a possibility to fast zoom out of the system map just
enough to make your ship or the next planet visible.

* It would be nice to have a stack of autopilot targets: select your
flight target, push it and select a target for a fight, return to your
flight target...

* If you don't use the autopilot, it is very difficult to land on planets
with high gravity, because you have no easy way to estimate your current
position relative to the planet without deselecting your target. It
would be nice to have a switchable height meter that gives you readings
all the time (not only from 50.000 m downwards) in addition to your
information about the target distance. Also some velocity information
like rate of descent and velocity with respect to the planet surface
would be extremely helpful. Why not switch to a HUD that contains this
information in the near of a planet, if your autopilot is not activated?

Flight Physics

 1 AU = 1.496 x 10^11 m   (astronomical unit)
 1 g  =       9.81 m/s^2  (gravitational acceleration on earth)
 1 h  =      3,600 s	  (hour)
 1 d  =     86,400 s	  (day)

A   Equations for Free Fall

With velocity v [m/s], acceleration a [m/s^2], distance d [m] and time
t [s] we get:

 v = a t = sqrt(2 a d); d = 1/2 a t^2; t = v/a = sqrt(2 d/a)		(1)

B   Navigation Equations

For the distance d travelled with initial acceleration a_1 and final
deceleration a_2 the values of interest for the journey are the maximum
velocity at the turning point (where we change from acceleration to
deceleration) v_u, the distance d_2 of the turning point from the target
and the time t_d that is needed for travelling the distance d. We assume
that forces other than those produced by our own engines can be neglected
and that we start and reach the target with zero velocity. Furthermore we
assume that the engines are used all the time at full power. If the main
engine is used for acceleration and deceleration the equations are very
simple:

 v_u = sqrt(a d); t_d = 2 sqrt(d/a); d_2 = d/2				(2)

This fastest mode of flight is used to accelerate up to the turning point
velocity at the distance d_2, turn the ship and decelerate until the
target is reached.

If the autopilot is used instead, it will use the main engine for
acceleration and the secondary thrusters (retro thrusters) for
deceleration. In this case we get the equations:

 v_u = sqrt( 2 d (a_1 a_2)/(a_1 + a_2) )
 t_d = sqrt( 2 d (a_1 + a_2)/(a_1 a_2) )				(3)
 d_2 = d a_1/(a_1 + a_2)

The time t_d is always a lower bound for the really used time because the
autopilot doesn't use the engines at full power all the time. I
approximated the real time consumption of autopilot flight with a least
mean square fit of data from 20 undisturbed flights with a Cobra MK III.
Measuring the distance in astronomical units [AU] and the acceleration in
units of earth gravitational acceleration [g], I got for the time [d]:

 t_dA = 1.212/86400 *
 sqrt( (2.992 * 10^11)/9.81 ( d (a_1 + a_2)/(a_1 a_2) ) ) - 0.001	(4)

C   Hyperdrives and Jump Ranges

A hyperdrive lets you travel its maximum range in seven days, which is 168
hours. Travel time is linear with distance, so you will use one day to
travel a seventh of your hyperdrive range. For a class n drive you will
need n^2 tons of fuel to travel the maximum range, except for the class 8
hyperdrive which actually is a class 9 drive and therefore uses 81 tons
for a maximum range jump. The fuel consumption is linear with the
distance, using only integer amounts of fuel, so you will need e.g.
ceil(n^2/2) tons of fuel to travel half the maximum drive range. The only
difference between the civil and military versions of a drive is the
weight of the drive and the type of fuel used.

The relation between jump cost c [t], jump time t [h], ship mass m [t] and
jump distance d [lj] can be expressed a little more exact to give you a
few numbers to crunch. Here the equations:

 c = ceil( d * m / 200), t = 168/200 * d * m / h^2			(5)

If you set the time to the maximum 168h in the second equation you can
calculate the maximum range of the drive of a given class in a given ship.
If you do this for the class 8 drive in a Panther or Boa you get
inconsistencies. From the ships table you can see that the class 8
drive behaves like a class 9 drive in the Panther and like a class 7.79
drive in the Boa. I hope this indicates a mistake in the table. The
maximum ranges for the Lynx Bulk Carrier and the Long Range Cruiser are
calculated as if the class 8 drive were actually class 9 drive. I don't
know whether these ships can carry hyperdrives at all.

Wormhole Theory
The following seems to be invalid for the newer PC versions of the game.

A ship can jump very large distances due to a modulo effect in the
hyperspace continuum with a base of W_sect = 81.62 sector lengths
(655.36 lj). One can use this behavior to find jump paths that are much
shorter in time and fuel consumption than the straight distance. This also
allows you to use a smaller hyperdrive and leaves more room for fuel and
cargo. The optimal jump points for a journey between two systems with one
intermediate stop are found on the intersections of circles around the two
endpoints of the journey. On such a circle lie the systems that can be
reached from the center of the circle with a minimum amount of fuel and
time. A system at the intersection of such circles can be reached easily
from the centers of both circles, making it an ideal intermediate jump
point. The circles have multiples of the wormhole distance (655.36 lj) as
radii. To make the calculations simple we assume at first, that the
"thickness" of a sector can be neglected and that two jumps with equal
distance shall be made, resulting in circles with equal radius. The
coordinates of the ideal intermediate jump points can now be found on a
line that perpendicular bisects the segment between the two endpoints of
your journey, at the points of intersection of the circles around the
endpoints.

For two star systems at the coordinates (x, y) and (u, v) we define:

 a = (u - x); b = (v - y)						(6)

We choose a jump distance of W_n = n x W_sect sectors. With this
definitions we get as coordinates for the intermediate jump (p, q):

 p = (x + u)/2 + b sqrt( W_n^2 / (a^2 + b^2) - 1/4 )			(7)
 q = (y + v)/2 - a sqrt( W_n^2 / (a^2 + b^2) - 1/4 )
or
 p = (x + u)/2 - b sqrt( W_n^2 / (a^2 + b^2) - 1/4 )			(8)
 q = (y + v)/2 + a sqrt( W_n^2 / (a^2 + b^2) - 1/4 )

Now n has to be chosen such that the square root has a real solution (the
jump radius is larger than the half distance between the systems) and we
have to find a system near one of the intermediate jump points. If such a
system cannot be found, we simply increment n and try again with a
wormhole distance of the next greater order.

If you want to perform two jumps with different jump sizes the equations
have essentially the same structure but get a bit more complicated. We
define a and b as in (5) and choose the jump distances W_m = m x W_sect
for the first jump and W_n = n x W_sect for the second jump. m and n must
be chosen such that:

 | m - sqrt(a^2 + b^2) / W_sect | <= n <=				(9)
 m + sqrt(a^2 + b^2) / W_sect

This ensures, that there exists an intermediate jump point at all. With

 alpha = (W_m^2 - W_n^2) / (2 (a^2 + b^2)) + 1/2			(10)

we get for the coordinates of the intermediate jump point (p, q):

 p = (1-alpha) x + alpha u + b sqrt( W_m^2 / a^2 + b^2 - alpha^2 )	(11)
 q = (1-alpha) y + alpha v - a sqrt( W_m^2 / a^2 + b^2 - alpha^2 )
or
 p = (1-alpha) x + alpha u - b sqrt( W_m^2 / a^2 + b^2 - alpha^2 )	(12)
 q = (1-alpha) y + alpha v + a sqrt( W_m^2 / a^2 + b^2 - alpha^2 )

The drives for Imperial Courier and Imperial Trader are fixed and not
changeable. The Interplanetary Drive of the Lifter cannot be removed to
add a jump drive.

The Lynx Bulk Carrier and the Long Range Cruiser can both sometimes be
seen in the near of space stations. They don't seem to move but if I
remember right, the Lynx Bulk Carriers at least answer your
communication. Long Range Cruisers seem to be abandoned and are only good
for hide and seek games with the Vipers of the local police or for target
practice. I know of no opportunity to buy one of the ships.

B   Lasers and Shields

A shield works like an extra hull that can take up to 16 tons damage
before your real hull is damaged. It regenerates at a few percent per
second and does this faster if you use an Energy Booster (approximately 3%
per second). The regeneration rate is independent of the number of shields
you have and the state of your shields. The strength of your shielding is
proportional to the number of your shields, so 10 shields can take 160
tons damage before your hull is damaged. A pulse laser can inflict 12.5
tons of damage per MW power. This means that one shield can absorb one hit
of an 1 MW pulse laser and will degrade to 22% in the process. A directly
following second hit would reduce your shield to 0% and cause nine tons of
damage to your hull. This shows that the damage a shield can absorb is
proportional to its state, which means that one shield can take e.g. eight
tons of damage at 50% reducing it to 0% without causing damage to your
hull.

Here a more complex example: You have two shields and get hit four times
by an 1MW pulse laser. Your shields recharge 5% between the hits. The
first hit reduces your shields from the original 32 tons protection to
19.5 tons protection or 60%. Before the next hit the shields recharge 5%
to 21.1 tons protection. The next hit reduces the shields to 8.6 tons
which are recharged to 10.2 tons. The third hit cuts through your shields
and causes 2.3 tons damage to your hull. Recharge will bring your shields
back to 1.6 tons protection and the last hit will take them down again and
cause another 10.9 tons of damage to your hull for a total damage of 13.2
tons.

The higher firing rate of beam lasers seems to result in approximately
five times the power of pulse lasers resulting in higher damage over the
same time interval. This means that a 1 MW beam laser should be
approximately equivalent to a 5 MW pulse laser. Mining lasers have a very
low firing rate but inflict enough damage to destroy an Imperial Courier
with one hit. The damage they can cause with one hit is estimated to be
somewhere between 750 and 1,500 tons.

A Class 8 Hyperdrive can only be bought as a builtin drive with the Boa or
the Panther Clipper.
No one has ever seen a Class 4 Military Drive or a Fighter Launcher but
there are rumors that they exist in the game somewhere.

D   Merchandise

Just for reference, here the list of merchandise:


			  Merchandise

Water		Liquid Oxygen	 Grain		Fruit and Veg.
Animal Meat	Synthetic Meat	 Liquor 	Medicines
Fertilizer	Luxury Goods	 Heavy Plastics Metal Alloys
Precious Metals Gem Stones	 Minerals	Hydrogen Fuel
Military Fuel	Industrial Parts Computers	Air Processors

E   Ranks

Here comes the list of ranks in the German and the English version version
together with the number of points you have to get to advance to a given
rank.

Federation_German	English 	Empire_German	English   Points

Keiner			None		Aussenseiter	Outsider       0
Gefreiter		Private 	Leibeigener	Serf	       1
Unteroffizier		Corporal	Master		Master	      16
Feldwelbel		Sergeant	Sir		Sir	      81
Hauptfeldwebel		Sgt-Major	Squire		Squire	     256
Major			Major		Lord		Lord	     625
Oberst			Colonel 	Baron		Baron	   1,296
Leutnant		Lieutnant	Viscount	Viscount   2,401
Korvettenkapitaen	Lt. Commander	Count		Count	   4,096
Kapitaen		Captain 	Earl		Earl	   6,561
Kommodore		Commodore	Marquis 	Marquis   10,000
Konteradmiral		Rear Admiral	Herzog		Duke	  14,641
Admiral 		Admiral 	Prinz		Prince	  20,736

The following table shows the correspondence between the mission type and
the points you get for the successful completion of a mission:

Mission_Type		Points

delivery		 2
assassination		14
foto			16
bombing 		18
'excellent' foto	20

Different kinds of military missions are bound to your rank. In the
federation you carry unimportant stuff until you get promoted to Sergeant;
then the first secret messages may be carried by you. You will get your
first military assassination mission as Sgt-Major. After your promotion to
Major you will get additional reconnaissance missions and a Colonel may
execute bombing missions. The empire handles equivalent ranks the same
way. You seem to get no new type of mission when you advance further in
rank although there are many rumors that you get new missions to destroy
enemy ships at Commodore/Marquis level.

The above does not hold, if you execute missions for more than one side. I
made the mistake of working for the empire after I advanced to Colonel and
had gotten my first few bombing missions.
I advanced to Squire in the empire and went back to the federation. Now I
had the problem, that I got no more bombing missions but had to stay with
the usual reconnaissance missions. I eventually got bombing missions again,
but working for the empire surely stopped my federal career for a while.

The safest way to advance in the federation and the empire at the same
time seems to be the famous 'rank swing': Advance one rank in the
federation, work for the empire and advance one rank there, return to the
federation and so on until you are Admiral/Prince and ELITE and bored to
death.

Your rank is not the only prerequisite you need to get a certain type of
mission. You have to own all the possible medals for earlier missions
first. You get medals for:

1. the first delivery of an important item like gravitic detonators,
2. the first delivery of secret communication,
3. the first successful assassination,
4. the first successful reconnaissance mission,
5. the first reconnaissance mission with resulting excellent film and
6. the first successful bombing mission.

A strange side effect is, that you must not perform all reconnaissance
missions perfectly, because if you do, you will not get your fourth medal!

The complete list of medals for the German and the English version of the
game looks as follows:

Federation_German  English		Empire German	    English

Tapferkeitsurkunde Certificate of Valor Rote Armbinde	  Crimson Brassard
Sternexplosion	   Starburst		Schwarzes Polygon Black Polygon
Purpur-Omega	   Purple Omega 	Goldene Lanze	  Gold Spike
Zinnober-Krone	   Vermillion Crest	Platinkreuz	  Platinum Cross
Blauer Exzelsior   Blue Excelsior	Ehrenlegion	  Legion of Honour
Frontier Medaille  Frontier Medal	Himmelskrieger	  Celestial Warrior

F   Combat Rating

And here your combat rating with more magic numbers. They seem to denote
the number of ships you have destroyed multiplied by 256. In other words,
you get 256 points for each destroyed ship regardless of its type.

	 _German_______________|_English_________|  _Points _|Kills_

	  Harmlos		 Harmless		0	 0
	  Meistens Harmlos	 Mostly Harmless    1,024	 4
	  Schwach		 Poor		    2,048	 8
	  Unterdurchschnittlich  Below Average	    4,096	16
	  Durchschnittlich	 Average	    8,192	32
	  Überdurchschnittlich	 Above Average	   16,384	64
	  Kompetent		 Competent	   32,768      128
	  Gefährlich		 Dangerous	  256,000    1,000
	  Tödlich		 Deadly 	  768,000    3,000
	  ELITE 		 ELITE		1,536,000    6,000


For every 256 destroyed ships you will get a message like: "right on
commander". This is an indication of your advances between the ranks. From
the table you can see, that you should get Dangerous between the third and
the fourth message of this kind. You advance to Deadly between the 11th
and 12th message. You should become ELITE after the 23rd message.

G   Legal Status

The last table gives the possible legal status with the associated fines (?):


		   _German_______|__English__|_____Fine_

		    W. Weste	    Clean	     0
		    Straff'll.	    Offender	     1
		    Krimin.	    Criminal	 5,500
		    Outlaw	    Outlaw	20,000
		    Fluechtig	    Fugitive   100,000

System Info
There seem to be differences between the coordinates of systems in the PC
and the Amiga version of the game. Usually they are smaller than one
sector, the only verified case of a large difference being the Andolqu
system [PC -76, 29], [Amiga -74, 29]. The following tables correspond to
the PC version. If you find systems to be located in a different sector on
your Amiga, I would be glad to include a list of differences (that you will
have to provide). If they are too many, it would be interesting to find
out, whether a more systematic approach could be successful.

The system names in the tables that correspond with really existing
astronomical objects are printed with a leading "_" character. Not all
probable candidates for astronomical objects (like 82 Eridani) could be
found in the star catalogues I have access to. They may be astronomical
objects or not.

A   Settlements and Tourist Attractions Far Out

systems, mixed with a few systems of specific interest.

Wormhole Routes
In this table, sector coordinates are interpreted relative to the integer
coordinates of a sector center(the intersection of the faintly colored
lines). Therefore the sector [0, 0] has the corners [-0.5, 0.5], [0.5, 0.5],
[0.5, -0.5] and [-0.5, -0.5]. Furthermore the coordinates [-0.7, 1.3] are
located in sector [-1, 1].
I am sure that for many jumps better jump points can be found, but this
little navigation library already helps me a lot. It gets continuously
updated.

For more cargo buy at least one ton of rubbish and go to a system where you
won`t be caught for dumping it. Then go to the cargo screen and click a bit
below the rubbish box. You should notice that the remaining cargo has gone
up but the ammount of rubbish has stayed the same. Keep doing this and soon

	<B> activates large bullets
	<S> gives you shields
	<E> brings up a cheat mode where levels may be selected by

Move the joystick diagonal up/left, press <FIRE>, then press <E>. You now
enter the game editor. Pressing <ESC> returns you to the level selector
mode (pressing <SPACE> from the level selection mode returns you to
the game). While in the game editor, press these keys:

	<X> modify the exits (use <-> and <+> on keypad to select exit
	    number, then press <S>, then use <+> and <-> again to set the
	    exit level. Use cursor to set position)
	<W> weapons distribution, works like the exits distribution mode.

Start the game as normal, collect the ship and fly to the extreme top

into the corner. Type in "STONKER" and re-enter the ship. Now pressing <D>
cycles through the available  weapons (including shield plus weapons), and
pressing <C> cycles through the levels. NOTE: when entering a level, it's
always best to station the ship at the top left of the screen again, to
avoid  appearing at an illegal position, or even off-screen. On the

Complete Solution:

From the start screen go left untill you come to the front door with
the cat flap. Pick up the red rubber bone and drop it next to the cat
flap. Wait untill Odie opens the cat flap and then move back to the
start screen with the green chair and go through the door. Pick up the
torch and go into the back yard. Enter the shed and fall down the hole.
Walk right untill you come to an alley and then go up to it. Carry on
right and down until you get to Nermal. You'll need to kick him
repeatedly untill he drops the mouse and then move odie to pick up the
mouse and leave the sewer.

You should then drop the mouse off at the health shop. A spinach donut
will fall and you need to take this to the rat in the sewer. Drop him
the donut and he'll stop. Then go to the chest, kick it and pick up the
key. Take the key to the park and drop it next to the lady on the bench.

The next step is to fetch either the bucket from the garden or the spade
from the shed and take it to the hardware store. By using it in the shop
you can gain a one dollar bill which may be used to buy some bird seed
from the health food shop. Take the bird seed to the park and drop it
next to the key. Quickly lift up the key and stand still. The duck
will pick you up and drop you in the dog pound. Walk right and go up
the alley.

Go right again and all that's left to do is get a big smacker from Arlene.
Yeah!

The most important thing to remember is that ALL the puzzles can be solved
without losing a life, so if you lose a life and think its the only way to
solve the screen, look closely. Some of the puzzles get pretty obscure
after level 10, but once you eventually beat them you'll kick yourself for
not seeing the solution earlier.

Look before you leap. Think about how the screen will look from a flipped
perspective. A lot of jumps you make will be unnecessary and waste time
and switches if you don't.

Make sure you have enough switches, at least 10 per screen. It is
possible to get stuck on a downward slope with no way to get back up or

Part 1 (Animal)

From the starting point just outside the Centaur`s shop first Knock on the
Door. Enter the shop and do things such as Examine All until the Centaur
(Cap) asks you to deliver a letter for him. Take the letter and then when
asked by the Centaur, take the Shovel. Now you may GO TO or RUN TO any of
the important locations. There is no particular order in which to do
things, and many of the items you will find are of no real use. A random
element exists here and some things will require perseverence to achieve.
This is one solution.

Move around until you see the Eagle above you. Examine Eagle and then WAIT
until it lands and carries you off to its nest. HIT CHICKS to be rewarded
by the Eagle. Go to just outside the gate at the entrance to the Witch`s
Cottage. DO NOT ENTER! It is a one-way gate! Ring the Bell that the Eagle
gave you and wiat until the Eagle lands. Say (for example) EAGLE< GO TO PEG
AND TAKE IT THEN FIND ME AND DROP PEG. The Eagle should then go into the
cottage garden and free the Dog from its kennel. The Dog will now come
thgrough the garden gate. Follow the dog until it meets the Swarm Of Dogs.
They will reward you with a whistle for freeing their friend. The Llama
will give you a flower. There is a hank of hair in the brambles. There is a
coin in the mud beside the puddle. There is a nugget and a yellow fungus in
the middle of the marsh. If you take the nugget and fungus a mist will
suddenly come down and you will be unable to move. To find a way out either
dropeverything you are holding OR wait for someone to come past and FOLLOW
them. You could for example summon the Dogs and send them somewhere and
then follow them.

Go to the Forest in the Northeast of the land and WAIT. After a while a
nymph will appear and wait to be given something pretty. If you have the
Flower from the Llama or the Necklace from the Centaur then give one to the
nymph. (To get things from the Centaur in addition to the Shovel you will
need to trade other items on a two-for-one basis).

Once the nymph has been befriended you can give her commands. One of the
first should be to go the the Rock under which is a Bridle. If you drop all
you are carrying and lift the rock, you can tell the nymph to get the
Bridle. Pick everything up again and go with the nymph to a position just
West of the Waterfall where you can see the Rainbow. Give the Shovel to the
nymph and tell her to go East and then Dig. Wait for a while and then go
East. You will now find a Crock of Gold and a Leprechaun. Take the Crock of
Gold and give it the Leprechaun who will now offer to help you in future.
He will tel you how to summon him when you are in need. Bear in mind that
the ONLY way to complete the first part of Gnome Ranger is to defeat the
Witch by destroying her source of power, her Magic Wand. In fact only the
Leprechaun is strong enough to break the Wand.

Blow your Whistle and when the Swarm of Dogs arrives say, DOGS, FIND
UNICORN. Then tell the nymph to follow the Dogs and then follow the Dogs
yourself. Once the Dogs track down the Unicorn and the nymph sees the
Unicorn you will be rewarded again, this time by the Unicorn.He will give
you a set of pipes with which to summon him if you need his help.

Now open the envelope the Centaur gave you, read the letter and go back
into the shop. You will be thrown out but that is no problem, it is the
game points that we after here.

It is now time to go through the gate into the cottage garden. Go round to
the back door and summon the Unicorn by blowing the pipes. When he arrives
tell him to break the door. Go South into the cottage and snap your
fingers to summon the Leprechaun. When he arrives wait for the Witch to
also turn up and quickly tell the Leprechaun to break the Wand. Be quick or
the Witch will turn one of you into stone.

At this point you should have scored 300 out of 300 and will be offered the
opportunity of moving on to part 2.



Part 2 (Vegetable)

Start by taking the tea leaf. Then go to the kitchen and from there into
the library. Read the books to get several clues as to what to do and how
to do it. Go back to the kitchen and take the seed and the bulb. Go back to
the garden and plant the seed. The seed will grow at once and become the
greenslave. It needs to be animated, brought to life. To make the animate
potion taje the elder berry, thistle flower, rowan berry and mint leaf and
take them to the kitchen. put them into the pot one at a time in the order
given above to produce the anitidote potion which will automatically be
added to your inventory. Return to the garden and put the potion onto the
greenslave. Plant the bulb in the garden and the blue telelily and the
white telelily will appear. Climb the trees to get to the treehouse. The
treehouse and the greenslave can be given instructions in the same way as
the dogs and the nymph etc in part 1.

Take the telelilies and the compost heap. Go northeast and drop the compost
heap. You will need to take the compost heap at times and drop it on rocky
ground in various places to enable the treehouse to move. Send the
treehouse and greenslave to the cave and then follow them. When you, the
treehouse and the greenslave are all outside the cave give the blue
telelily to the greenslave then enter:- treehouse, hold cave wait 5. Then
enter:- greenslave, find stinkwort shoot and put it in blue telelily. Then
wait until the stinkwort shoot and the greenslave appear. If you experiment
with the telelilies you will find that anything put into the blue one will
reappear from the white one. Also note that once a potion has been used the
ingredients that have been used up will grow again in the garden. They must
be picked again because each potion will need at least some, if not all, of
the same ingredients again. So get what you need from the garden and go
back to the kitchen and make the weedkiller potion by putting into the pot
in this order:- thistle flower, elder berry, mint leaf and rowan berry. Now
with the telelilies and the weedkiller being carried and with greenslave
following go to the hedge. Wear the weedkiller to go east past the hedge.
Drop the blue telelily into the pond and put the white one on the skinny
beanstalk. Wait until it explodes then go up. Examine the fern plant and
take the fern shoot. The only way to pass the hedge from this side is to
enter:- greenslave, push rock, push rock, push rock. Then enter:- push
rock, push rock. (This way both you and greenslave will be pushing the rock
at the same time). The rock will then roll down onto the hedge and make a
path through it. Back to the garden again and then the kitchen to make the
next potion, the antidote to the poison of the air plant. Make it in this
order:- stinkwort shoot, mint leaf, fern shoot, elder berry. It helps to
know where the treehouse and the greenslave are at all times. (It
generally helps to send them back to the garden when they have finished a
task and pick them up from there when needed). Now go to the garden and
send the treehouse to the air plant. Drink the antidote potion and follow
the treehouse. At the air plant examine it to find the air flower and tell
the treehouse to take the air flower and give it to you. You may need to
leave the location while the treehouse gets the air flower as it is scared
of animals.

Get some more ingredients and go back to the kitchen to make the fertilizer
potion. The method is:- mint leaf, rowan berry, elder berry, air flower.
Back to the garden and put the fertilizer on the tea bush. Take the tea
leaf and the other ingredients needed and back to the kitchen.

Now make a pot of tea using:- tea leaf, rowan berry, mint leaf, thistle
flower. When the tea is made, the old man reappears and you drink tea with
him.

You should now have 600 points and be ready for the third part.



Part 3 (Mineral)

Start first on the cloud 9 area. Find the yeti and by talking to him in the
usual manner, ask him to lead you to the diamond. Follow him carefully.
Take the diamond and the cloudstuff you find near it. Use the cloudstuff to
line the yetis snowshoes.

Now go to the penguin. The mother penguin is looking for a baby sitter.
Take the egg and the mother penguin will become your friend. Find the
icebridge and move south onto it. The icebridge will collapse and you will
find yourself on an icefloe. When the icefloe sails past the mother penguin
say:- penguin, push me west. The will then arrive at the iceberg. Take the
sapphire and enter:- penguins, push me east. Now you will be back on the
coast.

Go to the caves and find the fireking. After that go the prison cell and
open it. Go inside and put the icechild in the sack so that the fireguard
cannot see that you are freeing the child. Now go out and south to the land
of the icepeople. When the icequeen offers to help you, get her, the
icejester and the icepeople to follow you and go to the icefall. You cannot
get out of the caves due to a flooded series of tunnels.Water is constantly
coming into the caves but cannot get out quickly enough because there is an
obstruction, a log, in the outlet pipe. You have to temporarily stop the
water coming in so that you can enter the tunnels as the water level drops
and remove the obstruction. A dam can be built if the icefall is pushed
into the water. HOWEVER! Each player move causes the water level to
increase by 1 level. Each push of the icefall builds the dam level up above
the water level by 1. If the water level reaches the top of the dam it will
break. If the water level reaches 10 the pressure becomes too great and the
dam breaks anyway. Help is needed here to build the dam and help is needed
to remove the log from the outlet. the idea is to get the icequeen and
the icepeople to help you by repeatedly pushing the icefall into the water
while you send the icejester down to remove the log from the outlet.

This, or something like it, should work with the icequeen, icejester and
icepeople all together with you at the icefall. Enter:-
ICEQUEEN, WAIT 5 THEN PUSH ICEFALL, PUSH ICEFALL
ICEPEOPLE, WAIT 2 THEN PUSH ICEFALL, PUSH ICEFALL, PUSH ICEFALL
ICEJESTER, FIND DEBRIS AND TAKE LOG
PUSH ICEFALL

Try to keep the dam somewhere between 1 and 3 feet above the water level.
Do this by either pushing the icefall or waiting. Eventually the dam should
break but a cheer should go up as the water level rapidly drops showing
that the log has been removed. Now follow the icequeen until she shakes
hands with the fireking. Now get the icequeen to follow you again.

Run to the treetrunk and enter:- ICEQUEEN, WAIT 12 THEN PUSH TREETRUNK. Now
run to the garden where the gnome requires a gemstone to let you enter the
garden. Give him any of your gemstones and you will be thrown into the
garden. You will find your gemstone on the ground along with the emerald
and the ruby. Drop everything and pick up the ruby and put it in the sack.
Put the other three gemstones (diamond, sapphire and emerald) into the sack
as well and pick up the sack. If you timed it right, round about now the
treetrunk should come sailing into view along the river. STAND ON TREETRUNK
to escape from the garden. The gnome will not you leave through the gate if
you are holding anything you found in the garden. The treetrunk will sail
past the iceberg area and when you see a suitable bit of land you should:-
get of the log.

You should be carrying the 4 gemstones and the sack. Return to the gate at
the beginning of the game. Put the gemstones in the sockets one at a time
and then go north. If all is well then you will be in Gnomebridge on the
road to Gnettlefield.

This is the end of the adventure and you should have 1000 points.

This game may generate unique passwords for each copy sold. Therfore the
codes listed below probably don't work.

Level Passwords: Level 2 - JZS	or  CEL  or  APV
		 Level 3 - SFJ	or  HHO  or  AVJ
		 Level 4 - USX	or  DRA  or  LHH

Type in "SORCERY" on the password section to get infinite energy. If this
does not work try it on the main screen or whilst playing.

Learn the levels before going for the bonuses.
It's not always a good idea to collect valuable items as it tends to make
the monsters much more aggressive.
Sometimes it pays to lose a life before entering a new level to fool the
computer into thinking you're not that good a player, this means the next
stage will be easier.

On level two, buy a shield and a magic potion, then get three fireballs and
three stars. Spend all of your remaining money on food and haelth. Collect
all the gems in the usual manner. Then get a key and make for the exit.

When you decend the last ladder, two thieves will appear, make sure that you
don't quite have enough energy to survive a direct contact! Before going down
the ladder, release your potion, then climb down and open the door. Stand in
front of the door ready to leave, but don't pushup yet! Wait until the
thieves jump down at you and as soon as they touch you push the joystick up.
You may lose that life, but then something rather strange will happen. The
bonus will start to wiz up for quit some time, until the game stars again on
world two with 28 extra men and about 5 million points!

Part 1:

You don't want to get wet, so don't just recklessly head off West. See that
rope? The rope is about two meters long, right? Well your legs AIN'T, so
PULL ROPE and then WEST and you'll save the bath for Saturday night.

Let's take a moment to see what provisions we have. You're carrying a Swag
Bag (look up Swag in your Oxford Dictionary). OPEN BAG THEN LOOK IN IT will
show you that you have the indispensable tool of all Adventurers, The Lamp!
LOOK IN POCKET and you will find that you also have a plastic card which might
come in handy later. Meagre pickings, but we've started with less!

WEST again will take you to an area where you'll spot an old man struggling
along with a trunk. Remembering your lessons from ZORK III, you'd better HELP
MAN. In fact, if you don't, you'll never get into the castle and you'll fail
miserably! You and the old man will end up at the castle where the gatekeeper
will lower the drawbridge for the old man, who will disappear inside with the
trunk, never to be seen again. As a matter of interest, before helping him, you
might ask him about the trunk, the castle and the baron.

With the castle invitingly open, you can go NORTH where you'll be met by the
gatekeeper who will deposit you in the Entrance Hall. Along the way, he will
tell you about his favourite hobby, Rat Racing, and promise to let you know
when the race is about to begin.

A couple of notes here. The rat race is variable and will take place sometime
in the next 20-60 moves. You have to be either downstairs or in the corridor
upstairs in order to hear him shout at you. If you miss his warning, the race
will take place without you and you will not be able to win any money (which
you need desperately.)

Okay, we're alone now, so let's start exploring. Go WEST into the Lounge and
the only interesting thing you'll see is a bucket. LOOK IN BUCKET and TAKE COAL
that you'll find there. BREAK COAL and you'll discover a fossil. Not the most
exciting thing in the world, but we'll keep it anyway. Now SOUTH to the
Gallery. Here we'll discover three paintings, each important in its own way.
EXAMINE PAINTINGS and TAKE OIL PAINTING since it's described as a classic and
is, no doubt, valuable. The watercolour depicts an interesting scene -- keep it
in mind for future reference especially the words. The gaudy painting doesn't
look like it belongs here. If you move it, you'll discover a safe here; but
since you are not, and never will be, a safe-cracker, leave it alone. It's not
important.

SOUTH again will take you into the Drawing Room. The red leather settee is
obviously out of place, and if you EXAMINE SETTEE you'll find a cushion. OPEN
CUSHION THEN LOOK IN IT and you'll find a Note. (Remember, this is a British
creation, a Note is money, not something you read!) TAKE NOTE then go NORTH
twice and EAST to the Entrance Hall. This is a good, central location to dump
stuff. Unfortunately, there is no Legless Horse in this game, and the swag bag
is definitely NOT bottomless. Going EAST will take you to the Dining Hall where
you'll see a Bear in a cage. Also in the cage is a Platinum Chalice, and
there's no question that THIS is a treasure! Unfortunately the cage is locked,
and the bear looks testy anyway so leave it for now.

SOUTH again will take you to the Kitchen. The cupboard looks inviting, so
OPEN CUPBOARD AND LOOK IN IT and you'll find some rat poison and a jam jar.
TAKE ALL FROM CUPBOARD and head SOUTH again to the Servant's Quarters. OPEN
CABINET THEN LOOK IN IT and you'll find a key. TAKE KEY then SOUTH again to the
gatekeeper's Bedroom. If you LOOK UNDER BED you'll find a tub. OPEN TUB THEN
LOOK IN IT and you'll find a Maggot. Yeecchhh! But it must be useful, so TAKE
TUB.

About this time you should hear the gatekeeper shout that the rat race will
start soon. Go NORTH three times and WEST to the Entrance Hall. DROP ALL BUT
NOTE AND SWAG BAG. (You don't want the gatekeeper to know you're a thief, do
you?) Besides, if you try to pass the gatekeeper with any treasures, the
results will be fatal! Now SOUTH to the Courtyard. The gatekeeper will begin
setting up for the race, so WAIT. He will then ask you if you'd like to bet and
give you the odds. This MIGHT be a variable, but every time I played, the Grey
rat had the longest odds. In any event bet on the rat with the longest odds
(you need lots of money!). So BET ON GREY RAT WITH NOTE. You'll be treated to
an exciting description of the first race at Santa Courtyard; but never fear,
your rat will win.

The gatekeeper will give you a VERY dubious looking cheque (check to you
Americans), but it's all you'll get so settle for it. He will then depart,
leaving a birdcage behind. Leave it for now.

Time to explore some other areas and get some background on what's going on
here. Go SOUTH (don't ever spend more than one move at the Gatehouse unless you
are talking to the gatekeeper. He will escort you back to the Drawing Room if
you do. SOUTH and WEST twice to the Cave Entrance. Now GET LAMP AND LIGHT IT,
it gets pretty dark in these caves.

WEST again will take you to the Junction Chamber, from which all roads lead.
We'll try SOUTHEAST first. Here at the fork in the road you'll find an iron
gate to the southeast. OPEN GATE THEN SOUTHEAST and you'll see a grave digger
plying his trade. Ignore him, he's pretty morose. EXAMINE YEW TREE and you'll
spot some berries. You might get hungry later so GET BERRIES then NORTHWEST.
Now SOUTH to the Undertaker's Parlour. It's locked up tight (no, the key won't
work here) but that shouldn't stop a Thief. BREAK WINDOW and SOUTH and you're
in! There's a casket here, which is useless. You'll notice the counter has a
flap in it, so LIFT FLAP and SOUTH. The only thing of interest here is the
Till. You'll find a button, so PUSH BUTTON THEN LOOK IN TILL and you'll find a
coin! GET COIN then NORTH twice and WEST.

Here's the "Ba k of Ker vn a." If you READ NOTICE you'll find that the bank
is closed due to no business. Don't bother trying to break in. You can't. We'll
get it open another way. The bank is closed because the Thieves, who used to
deposit all their loot here, have gone away, and there's no business. Maybe you
can fix this. You'll also find a night deposit safe here. What we are going to
do is deposit all our treasures in the Bank in the hopes that it will reopen.

Part 2:

Okay, now that you know what to do with your treasures, let's get down to
some serious hunting. From the Bank go EAST, NORTH, NORTHWEST to the Junction.
To the southwest you'll see some very large, substantial looking iron bars
blocking your way. Just for kicks, try BREAK BARS. Aha! Just as you thought,
the old Polystyrene-Bars-That-Look-Like-Iron trick! Now SOUTHWEST and you'll
find a skeleton. EXAMINE SKELETON and you'll find it has one of its finger
bones resting on a chest. Just to be safe, let's GET FINGER AND CHEST. Then
OPEN CHEST AND LOOK IN IT and you'll find a heart. (Where ELSE would you expect
a heart to be, but in a chest? Isn't British humour wonderful?)

Now go SOUTH and you'll find yourself up to your knees in a stream. Follow it
WEST to the Top of the waterfall. There's a rope ladder here and if you EXAMINE
LADDER you'll find it's tied in a tight ball. UNTIE LADDER and the ladder will
unroll. Don't bother going down -- there's nothing you can do down there now.

Go EAST, NORTH, NORTHEAST then EAST four times then SOUTH to the Wheat field.
You'll see a windmill operating in the distance. If you try to talk to the
Miller he won't hear you because of the windmill. So SHOUT HELLO and the Miller
will answer. Then SHOUT STOP WINDMILL and he'll shut it down.

Now SOUTH and sit down to talk with the Miller. He'll give you a piece of gum
which you should keep for future reference. If you ASK MILLER ABOUT LUTE that
he's playing with, he'll tell you that the salesman told him it was magic. You
can ask him about a few things you're interested in, and eventually he'll tell
you he's tired of the Lute and wants to sell it. BUY LUTE WITH CHEQUE (careful
of the spelling) and you'll be the proud owner of a magical (?) instrument.

Lutes are VERY delicate, so PUT LUTE IN BAG and NORTH. Whooooops! It's a good
thing you protected the Lute, you clumsy oaf! Now WEST, NORTH four times. As
you go through the courtyard, you'll probably see a description of fish
jumping. Keep that in mind. In the Entrance Hall GET LUTE and DROP LUTE,
BERRIES, CHEST AND GUM. Now let's check out the upstairs.

UP and WEST will take you into the Library. EXAMINE DESK will show you a
paperback and a box. READ PAPERBACK and you'll discover that your instincts
were right: the fossil IS valuable. EXAMINE BOX and you'll find the outlines of
a heart, spade, diamond and club. Now OPEN BOX and inside you'll find three
cards and a joker. This is VERY IMPORTANT. Pay attention to which suit is NOT
represented in the box (it's a variable); this will save your life later. You
can DROP BOX because you won't need it anymore. Now you can READ BOOK. You will
get a variety of interesting topics, all of them variable. Among them you
should find one that tells you that rats can't swim, another that tells you how
to make a fishing pole out of a piece of wood, thread and needle or pin. Many
of the books will give hints as to things to come in the game while others are
useless.

When you're tired of reading, go EAST (ignore the bathroom to the North of
here), EAST and NORTH to the Billiard Room. GET CUE and then EXAMINE BILLIARD
TABLE. You'll see three balls of different descriptions on the table. Now HIT
(colour) BALL WITH CUE. This may or may not be a variable (it was always the
Red ball in my game), but one of the balls will refuse to go in a straight
line. GET RED BALL (or whatever) AND OPEN IT and you'll find a diamond! DROP
BALL but keep the cue -- it's a multi-purpose tool!

Now EAST into the Music Room and you'll see an interesting stool. OPEN STOOL
THEN LOOK IN IT and you'll find a plastic bag. GET PLASTIC BAG THEN EXAMINE IT
and you'll find a valuable original manuscript! Now SOUTH twice to the Spare
Bedroom. There's a wealth of important stuff here. First LOOK IN BED and you'll
find a Sewing Box. GET BOX THEN OPEN IT and you'll see some cotton with a
needle. Now LOOK UNDER BED and you'll find a china pot. GET POT. Now OPEN
WARDROBE THEN LOOK IN IT and you'll see a designer dress. TAKE DRESS. This
throws a lot of people off the track. The china pot and designer dress are BOTH
treasures, even though they don't look like much.

We've looted this room pretty good so go NORTH, WEST twice and SOUTH twice to
the Main Bedroom. There is a strange looking painting over the bed, so GET
PAINTING THEN DROP IT. It's not valuable, but you'll see a hole in the wall.
Looking through the hole will show you a light a LONG way off, so I wouldn't
enter the hole if I were you. You need a way to get across the chasm to the
light. There's a mirror on the cabinet, so GET MIRROR and then OPEN CABINET AND
LOOK IN IT. You'll see a plaque there; and if you READ PLAQUE, you'll find two
buttons and the information that this is a folding bed. Being a very ingenious
kind of thief, you know immediately what to do, right?

SIT ON BED. Now you can't reach the buttons from here, but remember the cue?
PUSH TOP BUTTON WITH CUE and Wheeee! You're in the Secret Laboratory. If you
LOOK IN CAULDRON you'll find a sachet. EXAMINE SACHET and you'll find that you
better not open it until you're ready to use it. Since you have no idea what
it's good for, better leave it for now. There's only one other significant
thing here: the diary. READ DIARY and you'll have an idea what the sachet is
for, but you still will have to figure out the other ingredients. The word
"distasteful" gives you some ideas, though, huh?

There's nothing else to be done here right now so go WEST and you'll find
yourself magically back in the Main Bedroom. Now North twice and DOWN. GET THE
PAINTING AND FOSSIL, then EAST, SOUTH and EAST again to the Gloomy Passage.
OPEN DOOR and NORTH and you'll be at the top of a flight of stairs. The cellar
below is infested with rats; but no matter how hard you try, you can't get the
rat poison where it will do any good. On the south wall is a drainage system
consisting of a stopcock and pipe. Remembering what the book said about rats
and swimming, OPEN STOPCOCK and you'll hear water gurgling down the pipe. But
we want the water in the cellar so GET PIPE and the cellar will start to flood.

WAIT one turn for the cellar to become half flooded then CLOSE STOPCOCK. Now
you can safely go DOWN and EXAMINE RACK. You'll find two bottles there. GET ALL
FROM RACK and you'll end up with a red bottle and a Champagne bottle. EXAMINE
CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE and you'll find the instructions "Shake me, say 'Hooray' and I
will explode." Something you'll probably want to remember later. OPEN RED
BOTTLE THEN LOOK IN IT and you'll find some wine and a ruby! GET RUBY THEN DROP
BOTTLE. (I suppose you can drink the wine if you really WANT to.)

Now UP and SOUTH twice to the Junk Room. You'll see a cube here. It doesn't
look very impressive, but GET CUBE and then MOVE JUNK and you'll find another
exit. Go SOUTH and you're outside the castle By The Moat. There is another of
those Night Deposit Safes here. It's time to see if we can't help the local
economy (and ourselves). OPEN SAFE then put the ruby, diamond, dress, plastic
bag, fossil, painting and pot in the safe (you won't be able to put them all in
at the same time) then CLOSE SAFE.

Now NORTH twice, EAST, NORTH twice and EAST. You've been working hard so it's
time for a little recreation now.

Part 3:

If you were lucky in the Library, you read a book that mentioned how to make
a fishing pole out of a piece of wood, thread and pin. If not, this is
something you just have to figure out yourself. The fish jumping in the moat in
the courtyard is about the only other hint you have about fish. You're going to
have to deal with the bear in the cage somehow, and although there IS some
honey available, as far as I can tell there's no way to get it, and it wouldn't
accomplish the purpose. A bear's OTHER favourite food is fish!

GET COTTON and then FIX COTTON TO CUE. The syntax is a little tricky here,
and if you don't get it right, the parser doesn't understand what you want to
do. Also, DON'T remove the needle from the cotton...I could NEVER find a way to
put it back! Now all you need is bait, so GET MAGGOT THEN PUT IT ON NEEDLE and
you're all set! Go SOUTH to the Courtyard and FISH IN MOAT. You will very
quickly catch a fish, and the fact that it's dead doesn't matter. (Dead
mackerel maybe?) Anyway, go NORTH, GET COTTON FROM CUE, DROP CUE AND COTTON.
Then GET POISON AND PUT POISON ON FISH. Now go EAST to the Dining Room and
UNLOCK CAGE WITH KEY and then GIVE FISH TO BEAR. The fish will work wonders and
then you can OPEN CAGE, GET CHALICE, CLOSE CAGE. (I don't know if the bear will
ever wake up, but I don't believe in taking chances!

Now SOUTH, EAST, SOUTH, SOUTH and OPEN SAFE, PUT CHALICE IN SAFE, CLOSE SAFE.
Then NORTH, NORTH, WEST, NORTH, WEST. GET JAM JAR and go NORTH once more. There
is a stable door here. EXAMINE DOOR and you'll see a horseshoe. Let's RUB
HORSESHOE for good luck. You see a golden glow, but nothing much else happens.
Well, maybe something good will happen later. Now EAST to the stable. Simply
OPEN JAR and a fly will enter the jar and get stuck. This will come in handy
later. WEST, SOUTH will take you back to the entrance hall. We'll need a few
supplies for our trip so DROP ALL then GET LAMP, CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE, COIN,
FINGER, MIRROR, CUBE, LUTE, JAR AND GUM. Now SOUTH, GET CAGE and SOUTH AGAIN,
WEST twice and NORTHWEST, SOUTHWEST. There's a gem stuck in the wax in the
ceiling, but it's really pretty simple to get. Just REFLECT BEAM AT WAX WITH
MIRROR and the gem will fall. CATCH GEM and you can DROP MIRROR. Now NORTHEAST
and SOUTHEAST to the Junction.

We're going to take a little unnecessary side trip here, just so you can see
what is going on. Go SOUTHEAST, SOUTH, WEST and you're in front of the bank.
READ NOTICE and you'll see that it says "Closed due to lack of business." Now
OPEN SAFE, PUT GEM IN SAFE and CLOSE SAFE. Now WAIT one turn and you'll see a
little man come out and change the notice. If you READ NOTICE, you'll see that
it now says "Closed due to not much business." It might be fun later to save up
all your treasures and bring them here and deposit them one at a time, and see
how long it takes the little man to drop from exhaustion! Now EAST, NORTH,
NORTHWEST to the Junction.

If you're not interested in watching the scenery just described, you can
bypass that and go directly to the Zoo and put the gem in the safe there. From
the Junction go NORTHEAST and you'll be at the entrance to the Zoo. There's a
toll gate here and you'll have to PUT COIN IN SLOT to get in. There is also a
Night Deposit Safe here in which you can put the gem if you still have it.

Now EAST, SOUTH and WEST will take you to the Insect House. Some vandals have
been at work here, but read the plaque which will tell you that the snake
(what's a snake cage doing in an insect house?) who escaped likes cold
climates. GET SNAKESKIN (you might want to make a wallet later) and then head
EAST.

Oops! You seem to have a snake corset! Not to worry. Remember that sign at
the T-Junction which mentioned a Jungle? Jungles are HOT! So go NORTH twice and
then WEST and the snake will expire from heat stroke. Now you're faced with a
yucky spider, but if you DROP JAR, a sticky situation will be to your benefit.

Go EAST back to the T-Junction. There's an Aviary to the East but we'll
forget it for now. SOUTH, WEST, and SOUTHWEST will take us back to the
Junction.

We're going to investigate another area now so go EAST twice, SOUTH twice,
WEST and SOUTH again and you're at the Antechamber to the Temple. There's
another of those Night Safes here, a good sign that there might be treasure
around!

SOUTH again takes you into the temple. Whatever you do, DON'T touch the
statue yet. Instead EXAMINE ALTAR and you'll find an Incense Burner. GET BURNER
and you're ready to investigate the other exits. There is nothing at the
Northeast exit so ignore it. Go SOUTWEST, UP and EAST and you'll find an organ.
EXAMINE ORGAN then GET ALL KEYS FROM ORGAN. Now WEST, DOWN, NORTHEAST and
SOUTH. You'll see a beehive here. EXAMINE HIVE and you'll find that it's closed
and there are some gloves on it. You can open the hive and there is honey
inside, but I know of no way in the world to get it, and it isn't needed. But
the gloves might help so GET GLOVES then NORTH, SOUTHEAST and UP. There's an
ivory rhinoceros here, and ivory is valuable, so GET RHINOCEROS then DOWN,
NORTHWEST and NORTHWEST again. Then DOWN to an exit with "WOBNIAR" above it. If
you're very observant, you'll notice that that spells rainbow backwards. Better
SAVE the game here, one false step and you're a goner!

Those of us who have played HOLLYWOOD HIJINX will NEVER forget the order of
the colours of the rainbow. For those of you who didn't, they are Violet,
Indigo, Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange, Red. You must pass through the following
room by stepping on these colours in order. Assuming it is NOT a variable (it
was the same in every game I played) you should be able to get through by using
this sequence: SOUTHEAST (Black), SOUTHEAST (Violet), NORTH (Indigo),
EAST (Blue), EAST (Green), SOUTHEAST (Yellow), SOUTH (Orange), SOUTHWEST (Red),
EAST (White).

SOUTHEAST will take you to the Crypt Room. The sarcophagus is locked, and
what better to open it with than a skeleton bone? So, UNLOCK SARCOPHAGUS WITH
FINGER then OPEN SARCOPHAGUS. There's a skull in there, and if you EXAMINE
SKULL, you'll find an eye in the skull. TAKE SKULL THEN DROP FINGER. There's
nothing else of interest here so go EAST into the Shrine. There's a statuette
here, and although the description is pretty vague, it is valuable, so TAKE
STATUETTE. Now there's a black door behind a black drape...so what do you
suppose would unlock it? Right! UNLOCK DOOR WITH EBONY KEY. Now OPEN DOOR, DROP
EBONY KEY and go EAST. Nothing here but a pamphlet, so READ PAMPHLET and you'll
get some valuable information about walking on coals.

We're done here so go WEST, WEST, and NORTHWEST to the white square. Follow
the rainbow colours to get out (not the reverse of the way you got it!). From
the white square: NORTHWEST, NORTH, NORTHWEST, EAST, SOUTHWEST, SOUTHWEST,
NORTHWEST, NORTH should put you on the black square. Now NORTHWEST, UP,
SOUTHEAST and NORTH to the Antechamber.

OPEN SAFE then PUT BURNER, STATUETTE AND RHINOCEROS IN SAFE, then CLOSE SAFE
and some more of your valuables have been deposited. Now we're ready to tackle
that statue. Go SOUTH into the temple. Just for safety sake PUT LUTE IN SWAG
BAG and then GET STATUE.

Now you know why I told you not to touch that statue! Don't panic, though,
just WAIT one turn. Now DROP STATUE (or you'll drown) and NORTH three times
which will put you on a sandy beach. GET BROOCH which is in plain sight and
then investigate those lumps in the sand. DIG IN SAND and you'll find some
wetsuit boots. GET BOOTS. Now go DOWN to the Thin Shaft. If you try to enter
this shaft without the right equipment, you'll slip and die, so WEAR BOOTS THEN
DOWN and you'll make it okay. Now go SOUTH. You see that rope? Well, you can't
possibly climb it unless you WEAR GLOVES. Now UP and GET PICK then DOWN and
WEST. Looks like these minerals might be valuable so GET MINERALS WITH PICK.
You can now DROP PICK, GLOVES AND BOOTS and GET STONE. Now EAST and then SOUTH.

Does this look familiar? Sure it does: It's the rope ladder you let down
earlier; good thing, too! So UP, EAST, NORTH and NORTHEAST and you're back in
the cave at the good old Junction!

Part 4:

Now we know what those succulents were for so back to the Zoo! NORTHEAST, to
the Safe. OPEN SAFE THEN PUT BROOCH AND STONE IN SAFE, then CLOSE SAFE. Now
EAST and then SOUTH and we'll try that other key. UNLOCK DOOR WITH IVORY KEY
then DROP KEY THEN OPEN DOOR. Now EAST into the Office. There's lots of stuff
here, but ignore it all except the spade. OPEN DRAWER THEN LOOK IN IT and
you'll find a key and a magazine. GET KEY AND SPADE THEN READ MAGAZINE and
you'll learn the feeding habits of the Macaw. Now OPEN DOOR and NORTHEAST to
the White Corridor. Then UNLOCK DOOR WITH KEY, OPEN DOOR, DROP KEY, then go
NORTHWEST and CLOSE DOOR. There's a noisy little Mynah bird here who can be of
great help to you. OPEN CAGE, GET MYNAH, PUT MYNAH IN CAGE then CLOSE CAGE. Now
you can OPEN DOOR and go SOUTHEAST, SOUTHWEST, WEST, NORTH twice. If you get
tired of hearing the Mynah squawk, you can teach it to talk by saying MYNAH,
HELLO, or whatever you want it to say. This will be crucial later.

Now go WEST and GET SUCCULENTS. Then SHAKE PALM TREE and you'll be rewarded
with some Macaw food. GET COCONUT. (Don't shake the tree again, or it will be
fatal!). Now EAST twice to he Aviary. There's the bird you want, and he'll tell
you that he'll trade some information for food. BREAK COCONUT WITH SPADE THEN
DROP SPADE and then GIVE COCONUT TO MACAW and you'll be rewarded with the
ingredients for the Baron's secret formula.

Now we're ready to deal with those coals so go WEST, SOUTH, WEST, SOUTHWEST
to the Junction and NORTHWEST twice. Now RUB SUCCULENTS ON FEET then go UP. You
made it! DROP SUCCULENTS here and go UP again. There's nothing of interest in
the Boathouse so just go SOUTHEAST to the Yellow Room. You probably should save
the game here in case you mess up the next part.

The secret to this puzzle is really simple if you explore all the rooms and
draw a map. If you look at the map, you'll see that the five rooms are laid out
in the same pattern as the spots on the face of a die. Dice are a very
important part of the game from here on. (Which is probably why they included
that die in the package.)

GET YELLOW DIE then go SOUTHEAST. There are rooms with a die in each of the
four corners of this White Room. Get the three other die and come back here.
Okay...now if you examine the slots in the opaque case, you'll see that they
are coloured Red, Green, Blue, and Yellow, the same as the dice. The dice you
have all have one spot on each face. They need to have a five on each face (the
pattern of the rooms). So start with the Red Die and ROLL DIE. Wow! That
horseshoe was lucky, after all! Okay, tell Lady Luck FIVE. Then PUT RED DIE IN
RED SLOT. Do the same with the other three and the case will no longer be
locked! Now GET PLASTIC DIE. Now I think it's time to start building the
Baron's secret recipe.

From the White Room go NORTHWEST twice then DOWN. Now RUB SUCCULENTS ON FEET
(check to make sure you haven't GOT the succulents...you need them here, but
should be able to use them without picking them up.) Now DOWN, SOUTHEAST twice
and you're back at the junction.

Now go EAST twice, NORTH twice. At the Entrance Hall make sure you have the
cue, berries, heart, eye, cube and snakeskin. Now UP then SOUTH twice. The bed
which shot you into the Secret Lab is still up against the wall, so PUSH BOTTOM
BUTTON and the bed will return. Now SIT ON BED then PUSH TOP BUTTON WITH CUE.
In the lab, GET SACHET and then, remembering what the Macaw told you, PUT
HEART, EYE, SKIN, BERRIES IN CAULDRON. The diary said something about
symmetrical objects, so PUT CUBE IN CAULDRON. Now OPEN SACHET and the contents
will turn into powder. PUT POWDER IN CAULDRON and when you LOOK IN CAULDRON,
you'll see an anticube (which isn't there). GET ANTICUBE (don't ask ME...I just
work here!).

Now WEST, then NORTH, NORTH, DOWN. We're about to start the endgame, so let's
check our provisions. You should have nothing but the LAMP, LUTE, GUM, CAGE,
CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE, DIE, and ANTICUBE.

Back to the cave by going SOUTH three times, WEST three times, then
SOUTHEAST, SOUTH, and WEST. The notice at the bank should now say "Closed due
to not quite enough business." Well, you can solve that. There's one last
treasure you haven't noticed yet. EXAMINE LUTE and you'll find a silver
plectrum on it. OPEN SAFE then PUT PLECTRUM IN SAFE and CLOSE SAFE. Now WAIT
one turn and the little man should come out and change the notice to read "Bank
open all hours, please enter."

There are a few preparations you have to make before you're ready to tackle
the bank. First GET CARD FROM POCKET then PUT DIE AND ANTICUBE IN POCKET. Now,
we're gong to teach the bird a new word. Say MYNAH, HOORAY. You may have to
repeat it before the bird says it. Now CHEW GUM and you're ready to enter the
bank.

OPEN DOOR THEN SOUTH and you will find a couple of queues. Experienced
adventurers will have learned long ago not to try to get in the short line, so
ENTER FURTHER QUEUE and you will immediately be at the teller's window. SHOW
CARD TO TELLER and you will be whisked into the Bank Manager's office. He will
begin explaining to you that he can't let you have any of your valuables,
because the bank would be out of business. The timing is pretty critical here
so pay attention. As soon as you are in his office DROP CAGE AND BOTTLE. Then
WAIT one turn, then SHAKE BOTTLE. At this point he should escort you out of the
office. You may have to WAIT a turn after shaking the bottle, but as soon as
your are outside his office and he has locked the door behind him, PUT GUM IN
KEYHOLE. It is important that you do this while the Bank Manager is outside his
office, so that he can't get back in.

If you've done everything right, you should hear the Mynah say "hooray" and
there will be an explosion. Everyone will panic and leave you alone in the
bank. You will notice that the roof has been blown off; this is your big
chance.

It's time for music so PLAY LUTE AND SING URFANORE PENDRA. You will be
floating in the air having dropped everything you were carrying. Now go SOUTH
and when you land you will be in the Bank Manager's office, and about to begin
a very clever and perplexing puzzle.

Go EAST into the bank vault. You will notice three exits besides the one you
came in. Remember that I said dice were very important in this game? Well, the
exits in the rooms from here on, are equivalent to spots on a die. You must
roll a number on the die that does NOT contain a spot corresponding to one of
the exits in the room you are in. In other words, you must use an exit that
does NOT appear on the die after you roll it. (You may have to read that
several times to catch on to what I mean.) To make it more complicated, each
time you use an exit, the number you rolled will disappear from the die. You
must make your moves so that when you reach the final room (which is ALWAYS
reached by rolling a FOUR) ALL the numbers will have disappeared off the die.
It stands to reason that as you get closer to your goal it's going to take
longer to get a number...rolling the final four may take 30 or more rolls!
Luckily, you rubbed the horseshoe and have Lady Luck on your side to make
things easier.

Okay, here we go. The room you're in has three exits. ROLL DIE and ask for a
TWO. Then go DOWN (See, the centre exit was not represented on the die). Now
the room you are in will have the same number of exits, in the same position,
as the number you previously rolled, in this case there will be two exits, NW
and SE. This time ROLL DIE and ask for a ONE. Go NORTHWEST. Now ROLL DIE and
ask for SIX and go DOWN. Now roll a FIVE and go WEST. Now roll a FOUR and go
DOWN.

Aha! Here are all the treasures you deposited! But wait! There's more!
EXAMINE THE PILLAR and you will discover that there is a weighing machine on it
with a cube which appears to be VERY valuable. The weighing machine is
delicately balanced so that if you disturb the weight, you will die. If you
EXAMINE CUBE you will see that it is about the same size as the one in your
package. Notice they didn't say IDENTICAL. It doesn't have any spots...and any
spots on the die you have would change its weight; THAT'S why you had to end up
with a blank die.

The solution is really very simple. First PUT DIE AND ANTICUBE ON SCALE. The
anticube EXACTLY CANCELS the weight of the die, so it's as if you didn't put
anything on there at all! Now GET CUBE AND ANTICUBE. Voila! You have another
treasure!

Now GET ALL and, since you dropped your lamp, GET WHITE. (Yup, it works!)
You're still not quite out of the woods yet, though. The pillar has four signs
on it pointing to four directions and naming the four playing card suits. If
you chose the wrong direction, you're mincemeat. Remember the box you found in
the Library? There was one suit missing, having been replaced by the Joker. I
hope you remember what it was...because that is the ONLY safe exit! Find the
direction on the signpost and then go that way.

Well THIS looks vaguely familiar! It's the White Die room. You have only one
task remaining now so go NORTHWEST, NORTHWEST, DOWN. Remember when I told you
you wouldn't need the succulents anymore? I lied! RUB SUCCULENTS ON FEET then
DOWN, SOUTHEAST, SOUTHEAST, then EAST four times to the Jetty. Now PULL ROPE
and then EAST again and you will get your reward!
