Lose all your lives till you are on your last one. Now find a gorge
(2nd level) and wait till the time is at 01. As soon as the timer hits 1
walk into the gorge. You should get times up and the game will restart,
but as soon as it does you will die again. Now it will restart again and
you will have 99 lives.

@remark C
Get to full speed (preferably but not necessary) and press <N> for neutral.
Now you can cruise along at full speed with easy steering and
invulnerability. As long as you stay in neutral you will have unlimited
time as well.

Another trick is to repeatedly hit <4> (4th gear) until the program has an
error. Continue with <RIGHT MOUSE>. Repeat until you get a high score.

At the start, turn the car around 180 degrees. The display should now show
the WRONG DIRECTION message. Head off under the bridge until you get to a
split in the road. Take the right hand branch and keep going until you reach
a checkpoint. Go through and turn the car through 180 degrees until your
heading the other way. Go back through the checkpoint in the right direction
and you should hear a ping. Keep going to the finish and once under the
bridge let the clock run down to zero. You should now get a message saying
that you've qualified for the race!!

@node "Hardball - Accolade"
@remark H
Various hints:
  * Allstars are better than champs,
  * Only steal if you actually hit the ball,
  * Try to get a lot of runs early, as the computer team improves
    towards the end,
  * Bunting rarely works,
  * Halfway through the match, swap Laws for Wells and Wratten for Harris.
  * The best pitchers are Oliver, Perez, Leary, Cook. The others
    will only be successful for a short while,
  * Never pitch fastballs to the center as they will usually result
    in home runs,
  * Change pitchers after a few innings, because as they get tired,
    their accuracy and speed get worse.

@node "Hare Raising Havoc - Disney Software"
@remark CS
If you press <LEFT ALT>, <CTRL>, <SHIFT> and <F5> keys simultanously you can
advance to the next level.

Solution:

Living Room
Go left, press enter to lower the ironing board. Go right,
just past the ottoman (foot rest) and kick it left. One step
left, pick up magnet. Go to fishbowl, use magnet to get key.
Not necessary but you get more time later. Go to left middle
seat of couch, jump up and keep jumping until fan is turned
on. Get down, go to right seat of couch jump up and down
until you wind up in the fan. You must press enter as Roger
goes left, bad timing and you hit the door and must repeat
this. When you go left the escape sequence activates, going
off ironing board to ottoman through top vent over door.

Kitchen
Turn on burners on stove. Use key on locks. If you get
timer, fine that's it. If you get cheese, put it down next to
mice and grab them when they come out. This gives you more
time too for some reason. Now go nest to right door and move
old fashioned clothes dryer. Now go left and eat stuff out of
refrigerator until banana peel shows (if you screw up from
here, return to refrigerator and cycle through food to banana
again). Go over banana peel and hit enter as you hit table or
you will not go over the sink. On the sink hit enter until
all dishes are trashed. Walk left, stand on burners. On
light, use arrow keys to swing and hit enter when going right,
this activates the escape sequence through the dryer.

Bathroom
My favorite. Although they add nothing to the solve, you
should throw the rubber ducky and even better, by the toilet
paper hit enter. I love it, he wraps himself in the paper.
I think this was my favorite superfluous sequence, even better
that Jessica saying "Did you hurt yourself" in the
Construction sequence. Oh yeah, the solve.

Move over to the chair, get up and get towel. get down, put
towel over water. Go back, kick stool over towel. Get up,
and get soap. Go right, jump on scale until skylight is open.
Go right, turn on fan. Do not turn heater off! Pick up
plumber aid which sticks to right wall (if it sticks to left
go pull it again it will go to right wall). Go left, turn on
water. Play with soap in water. Soap goes on floor. Go step
on soap that goes in toilet. Go back up on shelf where you
got soap. Go right on top on towels and press left or enter
to activate sequence, which does not require action from you.
You should land on scale, bounce off aid, into toilet, down
toilet, come out as bubble and float out.

Backyard
Walk right into rake. Whoops, just kidding. Turn water on.
Going left blocks water in hose. Then go right, press up and
enter to grab line. Use arrows to swing or you will drop. Go
right, drop past rake. Spill fertilizer on tree. Get bucket
on far right. (For fun, swing on tire and have dog bite your
ass or grab the burning steaks). Walk left through rake to
water. Put bucket down and let it fill. Pick up bucket. Go
back across rope same as before. Put water from bucket on
steaks. (Step over Two Steps exactly here or time will expire
on fire and it will return). Grab steaks, one will flop onto
see-saw. Go to tree and shake I think three times for apple
to drop on see saw and send steak to dog. Get on swing, swing
right left and hit enter going left to get over fence quickly
or time will expire on dog and he will return.

Street Scene
Pick up ball. Put in hydrant. Turn on hydrant. Get on Pogo
stick and get on wire (you should have this concept down by
now). Go right on wire to bird. Drop down, get feather. Go
back up on wire and stop just left of clown. Press enter
twice to tickle clowns nose. Magnet will drop. Drop down,
get into garbage can. Walk over with garbage can on you and
slowly bet magnet over to right over the manhole, which will
come up after you move off it. Dump garbage can, come back
press down and enter.

Construction Scene
This one gave me fits for some reason. Check out jessica for
fun. Tilt the mixer. Get a brick, put it in the mixer. Get
some dynamiter, put it in the mixer. Elevator now comes down
halfway. Repeat brick and dynamite. Elevator now all the way
down. Get dynamite and set mixer upright. Get on elevator,
kick bricks. Go right, grab onto hook and drop into mixer.
on wood, saw until you drop into hole.

Milk sequence.
Turn on switch, left side. Go to far right control (QC FIR
QUALITY CONTROL) and hit enter on all bottles with tops on
them. Good ones will go into the crates, bad ones will break.
Go to first wheel on left, press when empty dirty bottles come
by, it will clean them. Go to second wheel and press to label
all bottles. Go to fourth wheel and press enter to fill with
milk (just inside arm is the right timing, ill let you scope
out the timing on the others, not too hard to figure). Go to
third wheel to add rubber tops to bottles (tougher timing
actually). Start at quality control and repeat as necessary
to fill all crates and get to roof

@remark HC
The four heart pieces are located in the ROOFTOPS, HELL, CUTESEY
LAND, and SHEET MUZAK

Guide the Harlequin to the jigsaw puzzle section whilst carrying the space
hopper. When you fall from the kite, select the space hopper and jump up to
the lower of the two platforms above you. Disengage the space hopper and
jump across to the other platform, then leap over the low wall. When you
land, keep on firing to see where the ground is and move across to the
point where you're walking on air. Run left until you cannot go further,
jump up and you'll hit an invisible warp. You'll be prompted to insert
disk 1 and now you can watch the end sequence.

@remark S
IN HONGKONG
Jake Masters (JM) goes to town. His first trip leads to the pub. After a
talk to the keeper Ho (1-1-1-1) , 2 dirty guys are threatening him (1-2).
In a talk he manages to persuade the Chinese Chi to get with him on a
rescue-trip (1-3-3 OR 3-3-2). Chi fears going by plane. So JM leaves the
pub, takes the paper and constructs a little plane out of it, that he
presents Chi. Chi has the idea to get herbs at the chemist's shop. Wu
doesn't react when JM talks to him. Chi manages to persuade the chemist.
The chemist needs "gull-guano". JM and Chi go to the dock. Chi gives a
prune to the gull. The gull shits and JM puts the shit into his pocket.
Again at the chemist Wu. JM talks to him and puts the guano into the
mortar. He gets the herbs, a faked passport and a map. JM and Chi visit
Lomax before the journey. At the airport JM decides not to show the
ticket-collector his passport. Inside the plane JM takes the crowbar, the
rope and the anchor.

IN CHENG DU
After arrival a farmer appears who talks to Chi (3-2-3). Chi changes his
clothes against the farmer's. JM tries to catch the cow with the rope.
After several useless tries he gives the rope to Chi who has less
problems. With the caught cow they both go to the castle. There they watch
a farmer who is allowed to enter the castle with his cow. Of course, Chi
tries the same trick. JM gives him the anchor which Chi connects to the
rope. Arrived inside, Chi puts on his ninja-clothes at once. At first he
explores the door-keeper's home and takes the keys. Then Chi sneaks into
the palace and listens to Li Deng's talk. In the big hall he finds Kate
and tells her he'll come back with help as fast as possible. Back in the
entry-hall Chi goes into the dining-room and takes the bottle. He goes on
to the kitchen and narcotizes the dog with the wine. He takes both the
fried chickens. Then he enters the Cooks room. There he gets the knife. He
opens the door and discovers a second entry to the big hall. After
exploring the palace Chi walks to the castle-wall. He throws the anchor
over the wall and pulls JM over it. To hide from the guards, they both
sneak back into the door-keeper's home. When the danger is over, they both
run into the palace. When the guards have left the room, JM and Chi  go
into the dining-room. There JM throws down the lamp and lights a fire.
Through kitchen and bedroom they arrive in the big hall. JM locks the door
and kills the snakes with his gun. Unfotunately he can't stop the snakes
from biting Kate. JM carries Kate on his arm and escapes to the balcony.
There Chi connects the rope with the balustrade and all three they escape
to the tank-garage. In the tank JM uses the key and pushes the starter.
Now follows the first action scene (better skip it). In the plane JM gives
the herbs to Chi.

IN KATHMANDU
JM leaves the plane and talks to Chi about the situation. JM goes getting
help, Chi walks back to he plane. There he takes a tent-roof and a blanket
and puts it around Kate. He gives her his ninja-medicine and the
guano-herbs. JM talks to Ama (2-2-3) and after that he looks around in the
village. In the post-office he posts a telegram to Lomax. Then he visits
the restaurant and  talks to the keeper (2-3). The keeper sends him to
Sardar (2). Now JM goes to the Lama. After a short talk to a young monk he
is allowed to enter. The first talk to the wise man is resultless. JM goes
to the local dictator. After a wrong remark he flies into the prison. Chi
runs to Ama and she rescues JM. JM has a short talk to Kate and after that
he has a trip to the scrap yard where he meets a boy. The boy offers,
after a short talk,  a tube  which is full of petrol for a swap. Chi
builds from a cigar-box, the eating-sticks and four coins a play-car; for
this he gets the petrol-tube. Now he goes back to the Lama and receives
some more news. In the rstaurant he manages to persuade Sardar to help
(1-3). JM gives him his gun as a present and the revolution starts. The
game continues in Turkey.

IN ISTANBUL
On the runway JM gets no petrol from the seller. On the way to town Kate
and JM notice a little boy selling oranges. JM finds in a side-road the
officers' club and has a little call from there to Lomax; after that Jake
is caught by the sultan's crew. Kate swaps her brooch at the seller's and
gambles in order to obtain more money. After that she goes to the
orange-seller and overthrows his cart. She says sorry and gets a flower
from her young fan. Now she buys a  camel for 200. She goes back to the
shop and buys a saw. Now she rides on a camel - back to the palace. In a
side-road she meets a woman to whom she gives the flower. Kate rescues JM
and they escape to the town-gate. There Kate gives the camel to the boy
and JM whispers some words of excusing (3-2).  Arrived at the airport they
see bursting their plane into flames. They escape to the station and buy
a ticket for the orient-express.

IN THE TRAIN
JM's scene: (1-1-3-3)

If your character has just been killed and you want to restore your
weapons, magic and crew members, but forgot to save the game beforehand,
then read on. Go to the 'save game' option at the beginning of the game
(where the attribute options are). When the instruction to insert your
saved game disk appears, click on "no" and you will return to the items
screen with everything you had before you were killed.

Place the following runes in the spell block and activate them as
normal:

Your party should now be invincible, while still able to build up
their stats.

In Loki's shrine use the empty bottle on the front to rise to a
rune, Urgha uses the rune spell to get invulnerability.

Loads of money:
Simply get your men to complete the first mission then enter them in the
last. As soon as they appear, get one of them to search and collect the
money if there's any there. Then simply leave via the staircase with the
money. Keep this up until you've got enough money to buy the necessary
equipment. As for the artifacts that you can get during the game, well the
same sort of thing can be done to acquire these. Enter the mission, find
the artifact and then get out. Now just go back to the same mission and get
someone else to pick up the the artifact in your question. This way each of
your characters have the top of the range weapons and armour.

Save you game frequently. Don't just overwite an existing save, either:
give each save a different name to keep your options open.

In the early part of the game it pays to practice to improve any of your
abilities such as climbing (climb rocks, tree, walls...) anything to get
your points higher.

Practice throwing rocks at anything, but if you have bought some daggers
from the shop use the target south of the town for practice so that you
can get them back!

To improve your fighting skills, Goblins can always be found in their
camp and are not too difficult to kill. Each time you enter their camp
you will be attacked by one more Goblin than on your previous visit.
Goblin-killing can also be quite profitable, because searching a body
usually results in finding some silver.

Staying alive is helped considerably if you can afford to buy Healing
Potions and Vigor Potions from the Healer. You can buy them from Zara
in the town, but they are more expensive.

*** Making Money

Fairly easy ways of getting money early in the adventure include
collecting Magic Mushrooms from the Fairy Ring and collecting flowers
from Erana's Peace to sell to the Healer. She will buy three lots of
these, so PICK three times to save on journeys.

You can earn five silvers for cleaning out the stables in the Castle, BUT
be careful not to start too late in the afternoon. If it is sunset before
you get back into town you could be in trouble.

Simply get your men to complete the first mission then enter them in the
last. As soon as they appear, get one of them to search and collect the
money if there's any there. Then simply leave via the staircase with the
money. Keep this up until you've got enough money to buy the necessary
equipment. As for the artifacts that you can get during the game, well the
same sort of thing can be done to acquire these. Enter the mission, find
the artifact and then get out. Now just go back to the same mission and get
someone else to pick up the the artifact in your question. This way each of
your characters have the top of the range weapons and armour.

*** Sleep Safe

In town there's no problem if you can afford to pay the Inn-keeper for
a bed, but outside town there are only three safe places to get your
essential kip. Erana's Peace is safe and you also get all your Health,
Vigor, Magic Points, etc renewed. By the Dryad's tree is safe, if you
can get to it.

Finally the hermit 'Enry will put you up for a price of 1 Food, though
unless you can climb you won't be able to get up to his cave.

*** Thief's Guild

Contrary to what Bruno by the town gate may tell you, find the Thief's
Guild by going up to the Goon in the Tavern and saying "Schweinhund".
In the Guild you can 'fence' any property you have stolen after picking
the locks to the Sheriff's house and the Old Lady's House.

*** Help With The Quests

If you can climb, or if you have Magic with the Fetch spell, you can
find the Gold Ring lost by the Healer in the nest in the tree outside
her house.

When you have built up your abilities and can defeat the Ogre, enter
the cave of the Bear. He will let you pass if you give him food. You
can then enter the cave of the kobold. He is very difficult to kill,
but if you throw about 80 rocks at him you will succeed. Remember,
before you enter the Bear's cave PICK UP ROCKS. Repeat this until you
can carry no more.
You will almost certainly run out of rocks during your fight, but just
come out again and get some more before returning to THROW ROCK AT
KOBOLD. When he dies, pick up the key that he had been wearing, then
SEARCH THE CAVE. You will find a chest that contains money. Return to
the Bear and use the kobold's key on a manacle on the Bear's leg. Stand
by for a surprise!

Another quest which requires great fighting ability before attempting
starts with a visit to the Dryad. After getting a Spirea seed for the
Dryad, you are given a list of ingredients to obtain and take to the
Healer. She will then make a Dispel Potion for you.
You must then go to the valley where the Archers are. Run to the logs
and jump over. You then fight a series of Brigands with no chance to
pause and restore your health by drinking any potions, so you must be
fit before entering the valley. When you defeat the Brigands you come
to a gate guarded by a Minotaur. Kill him, search him and kick the gate
open.

You now enter the barracks. Go left round the blockades, then go across
the right-hand plank over the chasm. Step over the trip-wire between
the barriers at the back of the room. This takes you to the Brigands'
meeting room.

LOCK THE DOOR and go to the top right and GET CHAIR. As soon as the
chair is in place, MOVE CANDELABRA. Three Brigands will now be behind
the table, so move in front of the table opposite the right-hand
chair.

Wait - the Brigands will now retrace their steps, and when the first of
them comes to the left-hand end of the table type CLIMB ON TABLE USE
ROPE. After the action, don't hang about!
Open the door at the back of the room and go out. This will take you to
a very strange room (ME's room) which you will eventually have to leave
via the left-hand door on the end wall

It's a lot of fun, but I suggest you save on entering and during this
room. The next room is the Brigand Leader's room. THROW DISPEL POTION
on the Leader and stand by for another surprise!

Another quest can be completed from this point if you have already
opened the gate to Baba Yaga's hut. Take the healing potions from the
Leader's desk and also the Mirror. Go to the hut and when Baba Yaga
enters, HOLD UP MIRROR. Exit Baba Yaga!

The gate to Baba Yaga's hut is opened by the Skull in return for the
Glowing Gem - I hope you haven't sold it - which in turn you get from the
Frost Giant for a price of about 70 apples, which you get from the shop.

Solution:

healing,

the STAG! Or the Dryad will turn you into one, She'll ask you if you are a
friend of the forest and say YES, She'll ask you to get a seed of a plant
that is very rare, To find the seed is easy it's the only place where
you'll see plants spitting a seed

To Get the seed:
CLIMB ROCK and GET SEED (wait until spit towards you) or you can CAST
FETCH. After you get the seed you'll have to give it back to the Dryad
which will tell you how to get the <<Dispel Potion>> and an acorn will

(BARON'S SON) then ASK ABOUT ELSA. Barnard (Baron's Son) will leave by
teleportation. Then go to the Baron's Castle but on the way out escape
from the Ogre or kill him. If you kill him search body PICK CHEST until it
opens.

The Baron will reward you by giving you gold and a place to stay the night.
Talking to the Baron ASK ELSA and ASK YORICK. Then leave the room.

Baba Yaga:

To enter the hut you have to talk to the skull and ASK BARGAIN then GIVE
GEM to the skull which will thank you and let down the gate but you have
to get the hut to go down by saying HUT OF BROWN NOW SIT DOWN. Enter the
hut buy just walking in. If you can't get in it is too late in the
afternoon best to go in the morning. The witch will turn you into a frog
and she'll ask you some questions before she turns you into frog soup.
<<ANSWER THEM!>> You'll then have to go get the mandrake. Which is in the
Grave Yard.

Grave Yard:
The only thing in the grave yard is the Mandrake Root which you have to get
for Baba Yaga. To get the root you have to go at MidNight (Save game
incase) just enter the grave yard from the top of the screen and type GET
ROOT then haul butt out of there and to Baba Yaga's hut and you'll give
her the Root. Buy the time this is over it will be close to day break so
go to Erana's place for sleep but go to the ring of mushrooms and type

The Brigands: 5 STEPS
At around Noon go to where the target is. Listen to the conversation and
you'll get the password of the brigands. (SAVE GAME) After listening wait
until one of the brigands leave (BRUNO) and go down the screen and and
quickly back up or Bruno will stick you with a dagger. Fight the other
brigand and you'll get a key from him.

1 Entering the Brigands Fort: Two Ways to enter. (Save game)
1. Go straigt into the fort by dodging the arrows and type CLIMB WOOD
which you will face three brigands. You can't escape from them so I hope
your character is good. Once you've defeated all three drink your potions.
Then go up and you'll fight the minotaur once you've killed him you search
his body. You can't rest one time when your in the area of the fort so
best to use vigor potions.
2. Go where the antwerp is and go to the wall of rocks and type SEARCH
ROCKS and you'll find a hole then USE KEY and PUSH ROCK then say the
PASSWORD (HIDEN GOSEKE) which will avoid you from the troll. You can go
kill the troll if you wish and search a pile of gold. but anyway go to the
lower right once in the cave and you'll be right where the minotaur is.
You can throw rocks at the minotaur if you want but don't get busted.
Anyway CAST CALM and the Minotaur will fall asleep.

2 Getting pass the courtyard and wall: (Save game)
After beating the minotaur or putting him to sleep just keep typing CLIMB
WALL once you go up to it on the right side. <<DON'T RING THE BELL!>> once
over the wall you'll face obsticles.
LOOK UNDER RUG - you'll see a pit.
You'll also see dark lines on the line which are trip wires. Best to avoid
the one on the right side of the rug. You'll see two bridges cross the one
on the right. Then JUMP ROPE between the two barracade walls.

3 Inside the fort: (Save Game)
Once you enter the door do the following:

to ask him the follwing:
ASK YORICK
ASK ELSA
Then you'll have to go through his maze.
Take the door on the left then go to the door with the happy faces and
you'll be in another area where the chain is then type PULL CHAIN and the
right door will open go back and enter the right door then type OPEN DOOR
(door on the left) then get out of the way buy scooting a little bit over
and the door will fall down then type OPEN DOOR and you'll meet the
brigand leader. If you are ever rolling type STOP if you fall of the edge
or get punched by the box.

5 Brigand Leader: (Save game)
Once you see the leader type USE DISPEL POTION and Wow! Why it's Elsa!
Elsa will thank you and Yorick will come in. Then go over to her desk and
type GET MIRROR, GET POTIONS and leave where Yorick came through. Leave the
treasure behind cause the brigands will get you. You've done it you've
defeated the brigands and only one more thing to do.

Defeating Baba Yaga:
Go back to Baba Yaga and enter the gate again and say HUT OF BROWN NOW SIT
DOWN enter the hut then type USE MIRROR the Frog spell will turn her into
a frog and the hut will fly away.
The rest is automatic you are greeted by all the characters and

through a demo and you fly away on a magic carpet with the Inn Keeper, His
wife, and Abdulla.

Use the "FIND TRAPS" spell a lot so that you can detect all falling rock
traps, as these damage the party.

Arrange your party so that the first line consists of two strong warriors,
raistlin and goldmoon. This allows you to use Raistlin's magic and the
healing staff of goldmoon without too much hassle. Save tanis and river-
wind for the later levels, where the bows come in handy.

When fighting gully dwarves, use Tasslehoff who is the same height as them.
His sling stones will never miss. Avoid fighting hatchlings, they're not
worth it. Just turn and run when you meet one; when you reach an inter-
section move into a new path and wait a little. When you return, the hatch-
ling will have gone.

KILLING BOZAKS:  TWO METHODS:

(1) Get raistlin to use a web, sleep or charm spell to stun it,
    then send a warrior to clobber it to death

(2) Select Flint, who is a dwarf; 9 out of 10 times, the bozak's
    shots will go over his head; get close to enter melee combat,
    and use low thrusts to kill it.

SPECTRAL MINIONS:  They're easy to kill, so use a warrior.

WRAITHS:  A well-timed throw of an axe kills them every time. If
	  you miss, use a sword and chest thrust movements. Don't
	  let it get too close to you!

SPIDERS:  Use low thrusts to keep them at bay. If they get through
	  your guard, retreat until you can turn and fight again.

The blue and green potions restore health, red slows down monsters,
and yellow give your characters extra confidence.

Playing Tips:
Also to make the game easier, go to the player options and press <FIRE> on
the human option. Then move down and press <FIRE> on the computer option.
Then, when the game starts, you'll have all the computer's units and he
will have yours. Because the game usually gives the computer more units,
you'll now gain this advantage, and so you should be able to beat him easily.

The game uses the German keyboard layout. So if you are asked to press <Y>
to confirm something during the game just press <Z> instead.

The most ingenious feature of this game is that when you repair a unit,
which has been cut down to e.g. 1 man (vehicle or weapon) but has
increased its experiece points to e.g. 6, retains its experience (or
hitpoints - denoted by the sign beside their numbers) after the repair.
Those with cross sign (6 hp) are almost invincible! So you multiply your
power by repairing the experienced units rather than creating new ones!
I think this is the key to success in this game if you are going to play
it without cheating.

You need a Hex Editor to edit soma data files. (Make a copy of all files
before changing them!)

1) If you play as GERMANY against COMPUTER:
You can make your army stronger (and the opponent weaker) by editing some
data files in the MAP subdirectory. The files to edit have (.SHP) as
extension. 00.SHP to 23.SHP are levels for human player as AXIS against
computer player as ENTENTE, 24.SHP to 47.SHP are for human as ENTENTE,
48.SHP to 71.SHP are levels for two human players against each other.

You will get 7 Armoured Cars at your HQ by increasing the value of the
byte at the position (hex) 33 by one, e.g. if it is 04 make it 05,
(09 to 0A, 0B to 0C etc) This applies to all (.SHP) files from 00.SHP to
23.SHP. This will help you to stand against the usual enemy surge at the
begining of the level. Do not increase this value with more than 1
otherwise the map wouldn't load.

You can increase or decrease the "resources income" of the two sides by
first starting a level and writing down the values that the stores and
factories have and then hexediting them in the respective .SHP file. For
example if one of your stores has 15 (0F) resources, you can change this
to 255 by overwriting 0F with FF. Or if your opponent has "too much geld"
you can take him down a bit too! Thus you can create new units or
refurbish cutdown units rightaway which otherwise require much time to
accumulate the necessary amount.

In order to "have seven armoured cars at your headquarters cheat" function,
you have to reset your computer after a completed level. It seems to
function from coldstart only, especially when new types of units are
introduced or some messages shown at the start of a new level.

2) If you play as FRANCE against COMPUTER:
Just edit the byte at position 43(hex). The highest value you can put here
is 255 (FF). So you get 255 resources right at your Headquarters to start
with. You can also edit the stores and the factories as well.

3) If you will play againts a friend:
First of all you need a "Mouse-Joystick switch" plugged in the mouse port
for the mouse control in the game is absolutely useless (but the mouse
functions OK in the Menu screens). So both players use own joystick.

Edit the .SHP files 48 t0 71 in the same manner as the previous ones:
Position 33 for German HQ and position 43 for French HQ.

Part One

You wake up and notice everything is dark...have you gone blind? No, just
turn on the lights. Oooh, your aching head! You realize you must've had just
one drink too many at the party last night. Time to get out of bed. Stand up,
get your gown and put it on. As you do, you notice something in your pocket.
All this activity isn't helping your hangover any, so look in your pocket. Ah,
an analgesic! Take the analgesic. Feeling better? Good! Now get the screwdriver

doing out there? Better go outside and find out!

Go south to your front porch, collect your mail, and south to your front

is shouting at you to get the hell out of the way! Don't Panic! Humanity hasn't
gone completely insane, just lie down in front of the bulldozer. The driver
(who's getting Union Scale wages) doesn't mind this minor inconvenience and
stops the 'dozer within inches of you!

As Prosser madly waves his arms about and shouts at you, you see your friend,
Ford Prefect, hurrying toward you. Now what does he want? Oh, he's come to
return the towel he borrowed from you. Nope, don't take it. As Ford insists on
returning the towel, you tell him about your house and Prosser's intentions.
Ford, who was about ready to leave the Earth (which is being demolished to make
way for a new Hyperspace Bypass), decides, insanely, to take you with him! But
seeing that you're not about to budge until your house's future has been
assured, goes to Prosser, gesticulates toward you and the bulldozer, and
convinces Prosser to take your place in the mud. What a friend! The bulldozer
driver, in the meantime, sits calmly and dreams of overtime.

After you've regained your feet, take the towel from Ford and go south and
west with Ford into the Pub. Buy a cheese sandwich from the barman, drink the
three beers Ford has given you, and listen as he explains what's about to
happen to the Earth. Somehow, the situation regarding your house keeps creeping
back into your mind, and Ford's words make little sense to you. All of a
sudden, you hear a crashing sound that can only be the death throes of your
poor house being demolished! Get up and go east.

A small dog comes yapping up to you. It's obvious the poor thing hasn't eaten
in several days. The humanitarian within you surfaces. Give the cheese sandwich
to the dog. The poor, ravenous thing is in puppy heaven! As it devours the meal
you've provided, it completely ignores a microscopic space fleet that just
happens to be passing by at the moment! No time to wonder about this miracle,
though. Go north and wait. Now look! Overhead, you see huge yellow machinery
that amazingly resembles monstrously oversized bulldozers! Good God! What's
happening? Suddenly, gale-force winds blow across the landscape, whipping trees
around! Ford appears by your side and is fumbling around with a strange looking
device! The thing your Aunt gave you tumbles away, but the wind is blowing so
hard you can't get it!

Ford drops the device and it lands at your feet. He seems to be trying to
tell you something, but the wind carries his words away! Pick up the device and
examine it. You see red and green lights and note that it's curiously shaped.
It appears to be shaped like a hitchhiker's thumb! Quickly push the green
button and everything goes....

Dark. You will find yourself spending a lot of time in the dark in this game,
so get used to the series of events you have to follow in order to see where
you are. Do "looks" (which takes fewer moves than "waits"). Each "DARK"
sequence takes 4 looks until you regain one of your missing senses. When you
recover that sense, perform it. If you can see, type "SEE". If you can hear,
type "LISTEN". If you can smell, type "SMELL". If you can feel, type "FEEL". If
you can taste, type "TASTE". Right now, though, your 4 LOOKS will tell you that
you have regained your sense of smell.

Smell the shadowy figure and then look at the figure. Ah, it's Ford and you
find that the Sub-Etha Signalling Device has landed you a ride on one of the
Vogon Construction Ships! Ford hands you some peanuts to replace the energy you
lost during the hitchhiking transfer. Eat the peanuts then look around you.
What a disgusting place this is! But there are a few interesting items here
which you will explore as soon as Ford decides to take his nap. Before he does,
he hands you an odd contraption and tells you it's THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO
THE GALAXY and that it contains all sorts of useful information. After Ford
nods off, remove your gown and hang it on the hook, cover the drain with your
towel, get Ford's satchel and put it in front of the panel and put your junk
mail on top of the satchel. I've had you do this correctly so that you can get
the Babel Fish the first time. You might want to save your game and try getting
the Babel Fish without putting the junk mail on the satchel, just so you can
see what happens. Now, examine the dispensing machine and consult the Guide
about Babel Fish.

You learn that Babel Fish, when placed firmly in one's ear, are universal
translating devices! Flip the switch on the glass case that's housing the
Plotter. Strange words issue forth, but it's all garbled and you can't
understand one syllable of it! Better get a Babel Fish pretty soon! Push the
button on the dispensing machine and watch the circus! As the Babel Fish comes
flying out of the chute, a tiny cleaning robot comes skittering across the
room. The Babel Fish hits the gown, slides down the sleeve and lands on the
towel (which is covering the drain). The little robot grabs the Babel Fish and
goes tearing across the room toward its service panel. Just as it gets there,
it smacks into Ford's satchel and loses its grip on the Babel Fish! The Babel
Fish and the junk mail go flying up into the air where an
upper-half-of-the-room cleaning robot is frantically gathering up the junk
mail! So intent is it upon the mail that the Babel Fish falls and lands in your
ear! SQUISH! Who said junk mail was useless!

Now, flip the switch on the glass case again. It will tell you how to open
the case so that you can get the Sub-Atomic Plotter. Poetry? Ah well, worse
things could happen. Write down which word of the poetry you'll have to type in
because it changes from game to game; and if you type in the wrong word, you'll
blow yourself to teensy little bits! Get your robe and the towel. Ford will get
his satchel. Put your gown back on and put everything you're carrying into the
Thing your Aunt gave you (yes, it came back...it will ALWAYS come back to you,
no matter how many times you try to lose it!) and put the Thing in your robe
pocket. By now, you should be hearing warnings about hitchhikers coming over
the intercom system. Just wait until the guards come for you.

Part Two

Eventually, the Vogons will find you and take you to the Vogon Captain, who
is a cruel cuss! He'll subject you to his poetry, but don't panic! Just sit
back, relax and enjoy it. Literally! Enjoy the Poetry. So gratified is the
Captain by your enjoyment, that he decides to read you the second verse! Now
listen carefully, and when he reads the word the glass case told you about,
write it down. He appears impressed that you've been able to withstand his
poetry; and instead of killing you and Ford outright, he decides to "space"
you! Argh! This is better than death? You betcha!

Pretty soon, you're going to type something in wrong along the way. Your
typing error has been noted, and sometime soon, you'll get the results of your
foolish error! It seems that those erroneous words have started some sort of
space war that has destroyed an entire world! The remaining members of that
doomed civilization are not happy about it either, and they're out gunning for
you!

When you're returned to the hold, type the word from the poetry on the
keyboard of the case. The case opens and the plotter is yours! Take the
plotter. (If your load is too heavy, put everything you're carrying into the
Thing and put the Thing in your pocket.) Ford tries to talk the guard into
letting you both go free, but the guard will have none of that and throws you
and Ford into the Airlock. Ford sits pondering your respective fates and comes
up with an equation about the probability of being picked up by another ship in
the vicinity. Unfortunately, the odds aren't too good and as you and Ford are
unceremoniously sucked out into space, the Guide bleeps to life and says that
you can hyperventilate in space for 29 seconds before you explode! Ugh! Just as
you reach your 29 second limit, you're picked up by a passing ship.

Dark! Talk about miracles! Go through the "LOOK" routine and eventually you
regain your sense of hearing. LISTEN. You hear a sound to port, but as you try
to go port, you find that the program is lying to you! Instead go south. Aha!
You find yourself on the Heart of Gold (HOG)! Ignore the brochure, it's not
important, and let Ford lead you to the Bridge. When you get there, you see two
strangers (who begin to look familiar). Hmmm, Trillian and that two-headed guy
with her were at that party last night! They greet Ford and eventually all
three of them head port, leaving you quite alone. Get the pincers, the Pocket
Fluff from your gown's pocket, the handbag and put them in the Thing. Drop the
plotter and the Sub-Etha Signalling Device and go down and aft three times.

As you try to go aft the third time, the program asks you if you really want
to go in there. Tell it YES. It asks if you're serious! Tell it YES again! The
program will decide you really didn't mean it and take you fore. Go aft twice.
The program will ask you if you want to reconsider. Tell it NO. Be persistent
and eventually, you will be allowed to enter the doorway. As if not letting you
enter wasn't enough, now the program will tell you there's really nothing here
to see. Again, it's lying, so look two times. Aha! There's a rasp, pliers and a
Spare Improbability Drive here! Get the rasp and pliers, put them in the Thing,
put the Thing in your pocket and get the Drive.

Eventually, you'll meet Marvin, the Paranoid Android. He'll depress the heck
out of you, but there's nothing you can do about that. He wanders in and out,
but just ignore him for now. His use will be made known at the end of the game.

Now go fore twice and port to the Galley. Look in the carton, get the gun and
put the gun in the Thing. Now for some Brownian Motion (consult the Guide about
this). Touch the pad and the machine whirrs a few seconds, then shoots a cup of
Alternate Tea Substitute into the chute. Take the cup, go starboard and up to
the Bridge. Drop the Drive and the Cup of Tea Substitute. Let's get this
contraption going!

Put the small plug in the small receptacle and put the long dangly bit in the
Tea Substitute. You're all set to begin some pretty far-out experiences! Since
flipping the switch on the Plotter will take you to five random scenarios, they
will be explained in separate sections of this walkthru. You may find yourself
visiting one of the scenarios a second time, but you won't be able to do
anything in them. You're automatically taken back to the dark and there's
nothing to do but run through your "LOOK" routine. So flip the switch.

Part Three

Dark. Do the "LOOK" routine until you find your sense of hearing then LISTEN.
It seems you've been returned to the HOG because you hear a sound to port.
Again, the program's lying, so go aft instead. Hey...this isn't the HOG! You
see an awl laying here, so get the awl and put it in the Thing. Wait a
minute...Who are these guys? They seem to be in deep conversation. Listen to
their conversation. Uh-oh, YOU seem to the be the topic of discussion! Seems
like that small galaxy you wiped out with your careless typing has finally
figured out what happened and is speeding toward Earth to do likewise! Just as
the Vl'hurgs and G'guvunts arrive, they spy a huge dog tearing into a cheese
sandwich! As the fleet gets closer, the dog ignores it and finishes its meal.
The obvious happiness of the dog is not lost on the aliens and with softened
hearts, they head toward home, forgiving (and depositing you) along the way.
But WHERE are you? You seem to have materialized inside your own brain! The
confusion in here is obvious because no matter where you go, you can't get
anywhere. Just keep ploughing along (it doesn't matter which way you go, all
directions are the same) until you find a dark particle. Examining it reveals
it to be your Common Sense! Take your common sense and suddenly you find
yourself in the....

Dark. "LOOK" until you regain your sense of hearing, then LISTEN and go aft
twice and up to the Bridge. Make sure that the Awl is safely tucked in the
Thing. Flip the switch.

Part Four

Dark. "LOOK" until you regain your sense of sight then SEE. A bright light is
shining in your eyes. Look at the light and you find yourself looking at an
alien sun! But IS it really? Type "WHO AM I" and you see that you're no longer
Arthur Dent, but Zaphod Beeblebrox, President of the Universe! And you also
discover that you're sitting in a speedboat which is currently heading toward
some mighty rough looking rocks! Quickly steer the boat toward the spires. Now
then, while you're waiting to arrive, look under the seat and get the key and
the seat cushion fluff. Also take the tool box. Now, just wait until you get to
the...wait a second! Those spires are getting closer and closer and the boat
doesn't appear to be slowing down any! Just in the nick of time, the auto-pilot
activates itself and brings you safely to shore! Stand up and get out of the
boat.

As you step to the Dais, a wildly cheering crowd greets you! Fools! Don't
they realize you're not here to dedicated the Heart of Gold, but to steal it?
Ha! Wait until Trillian shows up and starts the charade. As she grabs you
around your neck, rifle-brandishing guards rush onto the scene! As calmly as
you can, tell the guards to drop their rifles. Trillian may hiss nasty remarks
about your ineptitude in your ear, but ignore her. Now then, to complete your
plan, tell Trillian to shoot the rifles that the guards have dropped! The
crowd, deeply impressed, cheers wildly! Don't take time to take any bows,
though, just head east.

Dark. "LOOK" until you regain your sense of hearing, then head aft twice and
down. Here you find the tool box, key, and seat cushion fluff. Unlock the tool
box with the key. Inside you find a magnifying glass and a wrench. Put these
two tools, the key, and the seat cushion fluff in the thing. Go up, fore and up
to the Bridge. Flip the switch.

Part Five

Dark. "LOOK" until you regain your sense of smell, then SMELL. Ugh! What a
repulsive odor that shadow has! Look at the shadow and you find yourself face
to face with the stupidest creature in the Universe: The dreaded Bugblatter
Beast of Traal! (Consult the Guide for further information about its
stupidity.) As it roars toward you, it demands to know your name! Tell it that
your name is DENT, then beat feet east! No time to linger! Get the stones you
see here and then put your towel over your head. The Beast is so incredibly
dense, it believes that if you can't see it, it can't see you! While it's
trying to remember where you are, take this opportunity to add your name to the
memorial that has the names of all the poor souls who've been unfortunate
enough to have been invited for dinner by the Beast. After carving your name on
the memorial, the Beast (still living up to its reputation) looks at the
memorial; and seeing your name carved there, decides that it must've eaten you
already and curls up in its lair for a post-dinner snooze!

Remove your towel from your head and go back west and southwest to the
Beast's Inner Lair. Reposing here, in eternal rest, is an alien skeleton
clutching a Nutrimat Interface in its hand! Get the Interface and wait.
Suddenly you find yourself captured and placed in a cage in a zoo! Amazingly,
you've been mistaken for the Bugblatter Beast! The nerve! Eventually, the zoo's
error is duly discovered and you're released. Unfortunately, instead of being
returned to the HOG, you've been given work as a paint scraper! After several
months of experience, you are allowed to leave your job and take with you the
tool of your trade...a paint chipper! Suddenly your surroundings shift.

Dark. "LOOK" until you regain your sense of hearing, then LISTEN and go aft
twice and port to the Galley. Open the Nutrimat panel, remove the circuit board
and put the Interface in the panel. Close the panel and go starboard and up to
the bridge. Put the chipper in the Thing, flip the switch.

Part Six

Dark. "LOOK" until you regain your sense of feeling, then FEEL. Odd, you seem
to have your hand in some sort of liquid. Taste the liquid and you take a sip
of a nice white wine. It seems you're at a party! "WHO AM I" reveals that
you're Trillian and this bore by the name of Arthur Dent is standing here
trying to pick you up. Look at Arthur and you see a piece of Jacket Fluff on
his lapel. Hmmm, you seem to need another hand, so drop the plate and the wine,
take the fluff from Arthur's jacket and put it in your handbag. Arthur is so
moved by your interest in his appearance that he becomes even more annoying (if
that's possible!).

To add to your dismay, you see the hostess approaching you! She's been known
to put people out of their misery with her small talk! Now she's insisting that
you pick up your plate and glass. Better do so or she'll bore you to death!
Say, who's THAT handsome fellow? Phil? Well, anyone's more interesting than
Arthur right now, so close your purse and follow Phil. Arthur (the dear man),
follows you. Phil, noticing your discomfort, takes you by the shoulder, says
some unkind words for Arthur's benefit, and takes you away from the party. What
an interesting form of transportation Phil has with him! As he guides you into
its interior.

Dark. "LOOK" until you regain your sense of hearing then LISTEN and go south
and up to the bridge. Open the handbag, get the Jacket Fluff and the Tweezers
and put both items in the Thing. Drop the handbag and flip the switch. As your
surroundings change.

Part Seven

Dark. "LOOK" until you regain your sense of sight, then SEE. Through your
squinting eyes, you can see a bright light. Look at the light and you find
yourself back on Earth hurrying toward your friend, Arthur's, house! Go north.
You are amazed to see Arthur prostrate in the mud in front of a bulldozer! No
time to worry about Arthur and his problems right now. You've got to give him
back his towel and get the heck out of here before the Vogons arrive to
demolish the Earth. Open the satchel, get the Satchel Fluff, the Towel and the
Sub-Etha Signalling Device. Close the Satchel and offer the towel to Arthur. As
you do so, you realize how much you'll miss Arthur and what a complete, uh
what's the word? IDIOT! Yes, idiot you're being trying to give Arthur his towel
at this moment of turmoil in his life. With calming words to Arthur, go to
Prosser and tell Prosser to lie down in the mud in Arthur's place. Some
softness in your head has made you decide to take Arthur with you! As Arthur
stands up, go south and west to the Pub. Buy beer and peanuts and drink three
beers.

As you're explaining what's going to happen to the Earth, Arthur seems
wrapped up in his house problems so much that he hardly hears you. And when the
crash of his house comes wafting through the open door of the Pub, Arthur jumps
up and races out the door. Go east. You see Arthur stop long enough to feed a
cheese sandwich to a small, starving dog, then he rushes north. Go north and
drop the satchel. Now put the Satchel Fluff on top of the satchel. As you stand
there watching Arthur bemoan the fate of his house, a gale-force wind whips
across the landscape and the Vogon (true to their famous timing) Construction
Ships arrive! As you try to reach Arthur's side, the Sub-Etha Signalling Device
falls from your hand and lands at Arthur's feet! Although you try to tell
Arthur to push the green signalling button, your words never reach him! You
watch in fascinated horror as he picks up the device, looks at it for a few
seconds, then pushes one of its buttons. Everything fades from view.

Dark. "LOOK" until you regain your sense of hearing, then LISTEN and go aft
and up to the bridge. You see Ford's satchel sitting here and on top of it is
the Satchel Fluff! Take the satchel, then take the Satchel Fluff. Put the
Satchel Fluff in the Thing and drop the satchel. Flip the switch again and as
everything disappears.

Part Eight

"LOOK" until you regain your sense of hearing, then LISTEN and go aft and
port to the Galley. It's time to tidy up all these loose ends and bring the HOG
successfully and safely to the legendary world of Magrathea. After all the
travelling you've been doing, your source of Brownian Motion has about had it!
So let's go back to the Nutrimat and get another cup of tea!

Touch the pad on the Nutrimat. As it whirrs to life, it gets completely
confused regarding what it is you want and asks Eddie, the ship's computer, to
lend it a hand. Eddie, in the meantime, has issued a warning that he's becoming
overloaded with instructions and starts to panic! All around you, you hear
shouts of anger, fear, hostility! Don't wait around for your tea, though! Go
starboard and back up to the Bridge. When you arrive, you see that the HOG has,
indeed, reached Magrathea! But the planet's inhabitants aren't to thrilled with
this supposed invasion. Out the viewing screen, you see hundreds upon hundreds
of missiles headed toward the HOG! No wonder everyone's panicking! Put the
large plug in the large receptacle and flip the switch! As you watch the
viewing screen in horror, you see the missiles turn into giant, harmless sperm
whales! Ford, Trillian and Zaphod congratulate you on your fast thinking and
return to their sauna, leaving you alone once more. (Whew...that was a CLOSE
call!)

Go down and port back to the Galley. Sitting in the chute is a cup of Real
Tea! Obviously the previous circuit board didn't know the molecular structure
of real tea and the new Interface did! Get the real tea. As you pick it up, you
find you've dropped no tea. Get No Tea. Wow...this is truly amazing! Well, no
time to wonder about this for long, so go starboard and back up to the Bridge.
Remove the long dangly bit from the tea substitute and drop your real tea. Put
the long dangly bit in the real tea, drop everything except the Babel Fish and
the Thing and flip the switch.

Dark. "LOOK" until you regain your sense of touch, then FEEL. Your hand seems
to be in some sort of liquid. Taste the liquid. UGH! It tastes like Whale
Juice! My God! You're in the tummy of a giant Sperm Whale! Sitting here is a
flowerpot. Get the pot, put it in the Thing and keep trying to go north.

Dark. "LOOK" until you regain your sense of hearing, then LISTEN and go aft
twice and up to the Bridge. By now you should have all four fluffs. Plant the
fluffs, one at a time, in the pot. Wait until the fluffs start to sprout and
you see a tiny stem in the pot. (Consult the Guide about Fluffs and required
growing conditions.) Hmmmm, warmth and moisture? That steam coming from port
might just do the trick! Go port. In a couple of hours, you emerge a changed
man with a changed plant! Examine the plant and you see it has, indeed, had a
fit of furious growth! It has also produced a fruit! Take the fruit and eat it.

In addition to the wonderful flavour of the fruit, you find yourself having a
dream about Marvin, the broken Hatch Mechanism and Marvin asking you to hand
him a tool. Remember that tool (it changes from game to game). As your dream
fades, drop everything except the Babel Fish. If you find that you haven't got
the tool that the dream told you about, Don't Panic! You'll find it in Marvin's
Pantry (which is behind the Screening Door). If you do have it, though, get the
required tool, the Real Tea (and pick up your No Tea!), and go up and aft to
the Screening Door. If you fooled with trying to open this door at the
beginning of the game, you know that it needs proof of your intelligence before
it will allow you to open it.

What better proof than the fact that you're carrying Tea and No Tea at the
same time!? Open the door. In your encounters with Marvin you have felt his
waves of depression pouring over you whenever he enters the room. Well, right
through this door is the absolute soul of his depression! Better drink
something to calm you before you enter here, so drink the Real Tea! Your quest
for Real Tea was not wasted. The tea is the most calming, wonderful substance
you've ever tasted! Go port through the door.

If you didn't have the required tool, you should see it here. Also here is
Marvin, morose and despondent as usual. Tell Marvin to fix the Hatch. He'll
grumble about nagging humans, but will tell you to meet him in the Hatch
Mechanism Access in 12 turns. After he leaves (and you're sure you have the
required tool), go starboard and down. Drop everything you're carrying except
the Babel Fish and the required tool and go starboard again.

After waiting awhile, Marvin will stalk into the room and look at the
Mechanism. When he asks you to hand him the tool, do so. In short order, he
repairs the Hatch Mechanism and leaves. Go port, open the Hatch and go down.

Timidly, you step down the steps. Eddie says something about humans who go
out into strange environments without any clothing; but Zaphod, Trillian and
Ford all urge your forward! As you plant your first step on the hitherto
legendary planet of Magrathea, you wonder what fate awaits you! You'll have to
wait to find out...in the sequel, perhaps?

On the level access screen, place the LVL mouse pointer in the far bottom
right of the green quarter screen. The bottom L must be positioned in the
corner with pixel perfect precision (two pixels on the pointer will be
hanging over the edge to the right). Click <LEFT MOUSE>, then shift the
LVL mouse pointer to the very top left of the screen (as far as you can
physically move the mouse to the top left) and click again <LEFT MOUSE>.
You should now have access to the first four levels and you can get 12

@remark SC
Go to the Bait and Tackle shop and pick up the mug next to the candle. Then
keep doing 'pick up' in the space where the mug was and you'll get all the
items you need to complete the game.

Solution:
Starting your quest in Pirate's Square, your first aim is to get suitable
pirate clothing to blend in with the locals. Take a wander along Mugger's
Alley and find Dr Chop's dentistry. Take the rollerblind from the window
and ask the Doc about gaining money and clothing. Subject yourself to the
Doc's dentistry ways and let him pull two of your gold teeth.

Next stop is Jolliest Roger's Place. Ask the manager a few questions,
concentrating on Hook, the war and how best to get the hat. Leave Roger's
and walk behind Pirate's Square to where Mrs Smeedle keeps her washing.
Grab the pole and the anchor and take a look at the jacket. Then make your
way back to Pirate's Square.

From the square head towards the Pier and pick up the rope that's lying
around. Use the rope on the anchor and go to the Crossed Swords. From there
take the two cups from the tables and leave. Make your way towards the Bait
and Tackle and take the cup you find there. Head upstairs to the balcony
above the square and get ready for some Infdiana Jones-style hijinks. Use
the rope and the anchor on the clock and start swinging across the Square.
Grab the hat from the passing pirate as you go. Well done Indy.

Knock on Mrs Smeedle's door and then quickly swing back to the balcony
while she's bust answering it. Head downstairs as quickly as possible to
Mrs Smeedle's washing line. Use the pole to get the jacket from the line
and examine to find a coin, which you should nick.

Now that you're rich enough, head back to the Jolliest Roger and find Fake
Jake. Talk to him and find out if he needs a drink (a safer bet than
placing money on Noel Edmonds marrying Mr Blobby). Give the three cups to
the bartender and pay him with the three coins. He'll give you three
foaming cups of brew in return. Give these to Jake and watch him drink
himself under the table. Once he's asleep, nick his trousers. Head back to
Mrs Smeedle's and use the rollerblind to gain some privacy while you change
into your pirate clobber.

Now your ready for Hook's ship. Look in the pots to the right to get some
more cash and head for for the town tailor. Ask her for a metal detector
and give her the money in return for a magnet. Head for the beach and go
treasure hunting by using the magnet on the large X (despite what a certian
Mr Jones would have you believe). Make your way back to Hook's ship and
find the Hoff-man himself (I thank you). Now prepare to go diving.

Take a look at the pulley base and the big shell. Use the pole on the ropes
and use the shell to haul yourself up towards the look-out point. From
here, go right to enter the Neverforest (that's never a forest). Maze time
folks, follow these directions to escape, right, right, right up, right,
up, left, left, left, left, up, right, right. After you've been trapped,
enter the tree.

Go to the round pond and have a chat with Tinkerbell about everything
(you'll be amazed how much she knows about Bird's Angel Delight). Head for
the slingshot and chat to Ace about everything (the tales of how molten
lava is formed will be the talk of any dinner party). Go to the workshop
and pickup the arrow. Now head towards the jogging area and do a Jane
Fonda. Use the excercise eguipment three times to tone up that body. That's
right, can you feel the muscles tightening?

Now go to the Avenger and take the net. Examine it and head for the Four
Seasons (thankfully devoid of any Nigel Kennedys) to get some dead wood.
Use this with the string and take the flower. Go to the chicken and use the
conchshell on it. Grab the eggs while she's startled and return to the
workshop. Give the eggs to the boy and go back to the round pond. Give the
flower to Tinkerbell (ahh) then take the branch from the tree.

Walk to the slingshot then use the strong elastic on the broken strap. Use
the branch with the string. Return to the workshop and use the bow with the
panpipes. Take the pipes and head towards the cliffside. Use yourself on
the far corner of the fence. Keep doing this (about three times in total)
then ask Thudbutt what he thought about your antics. Go back to the
slingshot and use it on yourself. Ask Thudbutt what his happy thoughts are
then go to the dining area and have a chat with Rufio. Say "Oh Rufio".

Go to the round pond again and walk towards the middle of the screen to
enter the Nevertree (that's never a tree). Talk to Tinkerbell then examine
the bed, the chair and the fireplace. Talk again with Tinkerbell and your
memories of long-forgotten but better times should come flooding back.

Now that you regained your faith and discovered the truth about Peter Pan
it's time to go after the nefarious Hook. When the sword fight commences
use the following Monkey Island-Style taunts.

Peter Pan the Avenger!
Good form James.
Tick-tock-tick-tock, Hook's afraid of a dead old crock!
You kidnapped my kids Hook. You deserve to die!
Put up your swords. It's Hook or me this time.
Peter Pan the Avenger!

And that, as someone once said when pointing to the letters T, H, A, and T
in a dictionary, is that. The game is finished. Sit back and enjoy the
reward that is the brilliant end sequence.

@remark S
1st Stage:
Whenever possible hide behind walls, or in doorways if you are about to be
spotted by a searchlight, as lying down or doing a roll isn't always
effective.

2nd Stage:
When placing your men around the top of the building, put them all on the
same side. The best side is the bottom one. Now press <F1> which will show
you the side where your men are placed. Scan the top windows first for an
empty room. You should see the men dangling from ropes, if not then you
have got the wrong side fool!  You should send your first man in on the top
floor. If all the windows have silhouettes, the hostages are the one's with
a slightly fatter silhouette at the window than the terrorist's silhouette.
If you shoot a hostage at the window by mistake, you might as well start
again. Don't forget there are only 3 hostages !!
When your first man has entered a window on the top floor, clean the top
floor of all terrorists (in green, hostages are blue - they also don't move
around much). When you have killed your first terrorist, position your gun
where he once stood, so when you burst in on the next one, you don't have
to mess about positioning your gun, but can shoot him straight away. When
top floor is clear move your man to the top right room, (the one with only
one door) and stand him in that room with his back to the door. That way,
when you have a hostage you can take him to this safe room, and leave him,
as any terrorists can't get in through the door because one of your men is
protecting the door, but you can still get in and out.
Now bring another man in through the top floor, still leaving one man in
the top right room protecting hostages you leave there. Now go forth and
find them hostages! If there is a terrorist with a hostage behind him,
DON'T shoot the terrorist as you will kill the hostage. Instead run
straight into the room and straight at the hostage/terrorist, so you and
them occupy the same space. Don't stop, keep holding forward and you should
be on the other side of the room, as the hostage follows you but the
terrorist doesn't. BUT, doing this you have to be very QUICK! Now take the
hostage to the top floor, the top right room, where your first man is on
guard. Walk into this room and back out again, the hostage will stay there.
Now you are free to go and get another one.
Once all hostages have been successfully rescued, Game over !

throw yourself into the whirlpool rather than climbing the ladder. In
level 8, to defeat the dragon and Mordamir, use the BLINK spell six

amulet and Mordamir will spin in. Use the STATUE spell three times to
avoid being killed by the lightning, then just as he starts his next

cast the MAGNETIC spell. Bingo - end of game.

ladder you climbed down. Don't climb back up it! Continue down that
passage and throw yourself into the whirlpool! the norlac is dragged in

by a female goblin.

- The dragon starts to emerge -
As soon as you regain your feet hold the amulet up to the light. Never
read the runes!
Prepare to use blink spells.
You must blimk every time the dragon breathes fire at you so timing is
crucial. Blink just after the dragons head moves back and you should avoid
its flames. The dragon breathes 6 times and then takes two large breaths
just before it releases the fire use the fire protection spell and the
flames don't harm you. Hold the amulet up again. Mordamir himself appears.
After he takes the amulet from you prepare to use the body statue spell.
Timing is crucial to avoid his attacks.
To avoid his lightning count to 2 after the lightning has disappeared from
above his head then statue yourself.

mordamirs attacks     your defence

lightning	      body statue
lightning	      body statue
lightning	      body statue
sonic attack	      sonic shield (before he raises his arms)
lightning	      body statue
lightning	      body statue
raised bones	      body statue

He then explains that the dragon won't attack him because he is holding
the amulet. So you cast your magic hands and the amulet floats over to
you. The dragon makes a kebab of mordamir and leaves.

Ana throws a rope down to rescue you - she also puts a new spring in your
step.

Well, there are lots of random things in the game so what might
work for me wont work for everyone cause I am not entirley sure
what parts are random.

In the beginning, you can go box if ya want by going to your
locker room. Then go out the door and talk to Marcus. Ask him
about the guy's situation and the new archaeologist. Then go
back to the 1st door you saw and open it. When inside, tell the
kids you have a solution for everyone and for the secretary to
take down their names. When inside your office, pick up all the
junk mail and papers to get the package. Open the package and
there's the grail diary! Then leave by the window.

Then go to Henry's house and go to the bedroom. Pick up the
painting of the trophy. Go back to the living room and pick up
the plant and table cloth to move them. Then go to the leaning
bookcase and push it. Get the tape on the back of the bookcase.
Go back to your office and use the jar of liquid on the tape. Go
back to your dad's house and open the chest with it. Get the old
book and leave to Italy.

In the library, go to the lower shelves to look for books.
Keep going to the lower shelves until Mein Kampf, biplane
instruction book, and a catacombs book are found. Mein Kampf is
the leaning book, the biplane book is black and in a how-to-do
enclopedia like series. The catacombs is a yellow book in a
series about maps of ancient Rome. Now go find the post and red
cordon and pick them up. After that, open the computer version of
the grail diary and it will show a window and tell what plaque to
look at. Go find the correct window and look at it. It says it's
the correct window.Now look at the correct plaque and use the post
on the slab with the roman numeral from the plaque.

Now look at the book about the catacombs. The top map is the
upper level which you're on and the lower map is the bottom
level. The sections where it shoes a closer view of Indy are the
round looking parts which connect tunnels. Find the nearest one
from the one you started from and go there to pick up the
skeleton's arm/hook. Now keep going till you come to the
manhole. Go up it and look at the wine bottle near the lovers.
Get the wine bottle and use it in the fountain. Go back to the
torch you should have passed along the way to get to the
manhole. Use the bottle on it and pick it up.

You should have fallen into a passge. Go right and choose the
room on the right. Keep going past the bridge to look at the
inscription. The inscription will narrow the grail choices to 2.
BE SURE TO WRITE THEM DOWN. That is very important for the
end.Now go to the plug and use the hook and whip on it. Go to
the room on left and climb the ladder. Then go right and go to
the room to the southeast where water use to be until the plug
was pulled. Continue along the passage.

Go north into the machine room and use the red cordon on the
machine. Then use the wheel to operate it. Leave and go east and
north and east again to a room with statues. Use the computer grail
book again and push the statues to correct combo. Enter the door
and go in a westerly direction past the bridge and skeleton room.
In the next section go northwest to the skull playing room. Look at
the computer grail book for the correct notes and play them. Enter
the door and continue to go in an easterly direction to the tomb.
Open the tomb and look and then go to the lock and pull it.
Leave to the castle where your father is!

Once in the castle, ask the butler if he has relatives near
him and till him Otto sent you but he is ok. Then say you have
proof you are telling the truth. Go north to passageways and go
south then east. Choose the lower door on the east wall. Talk to
the drunk about everything except don't say he's drunk. After
getting the stein from him, go to the next door in the hallway
just above the one you're in. Once there, get the ale from keg
and use it in the fire place. Get more ale and get the roast
boar after it cools off. Go back to castle entrance and go to
the hall.

I am not sure if the guards are random about what you can say
to keep from fighting them. I will tell what I said. Go to south
hallway and tell the guard you have come to interrogate the
prisoner, you are Gestapo, and ask if he's leaking information.
Then go to 1st room on right to get servant uniform. Then go to
room on left and push the suit of armor in the far right corner.
Leave and go to north hallway. Tell the guard you're selling
leather jackets for $15 and you have authorization. Go upstairs
and go south and east. Enter the north door and open the trunk
to get money. Then wear servant uniform. Walk south to the guard
and give him the painting. Watch the cut-scene about the
painting and change back to Indywear.

Now go to east end of hallway and north. Enter the door and
open the trunk for the uniform. Look at the uniform to get the
key. Go back to where you got the servant uniform and unlock the
officer uniform. Go back to where you found the key and wear the
officer uniform. Now go north to hallway and walk east. Tell the
guard you are on official bussiness and new here. After asking
for authorization, tell him to go talk to the colonel. Go south
and enter the room on west side. Get the 1st aid kit and leave.
Go north and west till you can go west no more. Go north and
enter the 1st door you come to. Tell the guard you're on
official business. Leave by the way you came in and continue on.

Go north and enter the door farthest right. Tell the guard
you're on official business, you're new, and when he asks about
you ask him if he has clerance. Open the door and enter and open
the window. Go outside and walk to the 3rd window. Open it and
enter. Push the loose brick near the window and go back outside.
Use the whip on the brick and enter the 1st window on 3rd level.
Open the cabinet to get money and come back for your father
later. Go back to 2nd level by pointing the arrow at the 3rd
window. Once inside, wear the officer uniform. Open the door and
go to the door on the far left. Give Mein Kampf to the guard and
use the stein with ale on the grating. Leave and go to the
stairs leading to 3rd level.

Go to the 1st door you find. Before entering, tell the guard
he has wrinkled pants, a stain, and for the buffoon to get out
of your way. In the office, give the roast to the dog. Get the
trophy and open the cabinet to get the pass. Go back to 2nd
level where you gave the guy the painting. This times go to the
room on the far left. Go to the Mona Lisa and move it. Open the
vault and go in. Look at the painting. I couldn't tell anything
except it made the grail seem to be a bowl. Not sure though.
Leave and go to the ale place and fill the trophy with ale. Be
sure to change uniforms before 1st level. Go back to 3rd level
and give the trophy to the big strong Nazi. Go south and tell
the guy the same thing you told the guard about the security
clearance. Go west and north into a room. Get the key there and
go back east and north. Unlock the door your father is in and go
to any guard. They will capture you and put you tied up in
chairs near the knight in armor.

Have Henry push the chair so the space between the 2 chairs
is at the mark you made earlier on the carpet. Have Indy push
the armor. Once free, push the top statue and leave. Go the
motorcycle and talk to the guard at the guard post. Tell him you
are a superior officer on a top secret mission with no ID. Once
in Germany, have Hitler sign the passcard that had the
combination on it. At the airport, have Indy ask the man about
his grandchildren. Then switch to Henry to steal the tickets.
Leave and go to the biplane or the blimp. Know what to do from
the book if you decide to use the biplane. You don't have much
time. If you go to the blimp, give the man your tickets.

In the blimp, have Henry put a coin in the piano man's cup.
Then have Indy enter the door and push the radio. Fight the guy
and open the cabinet for the wrench. Leave and use the wrench in
the hole and turn it. Save the game before hand. Climb the
ladder and run from the guards. Go up the ladder in the top left
corner. Keep going up the ladders to 3rd level. On 3rd level
run to a different ladder going down. Go down to 1st level and
this time you'll go to the biplane. Henry will already be there.
Fly around and dodge the plane. Just don't let them shoot ya
down for a while. After crashing, choose the expensive looking car.

Give the pass to the guards at the guard posts. Once outside
the grail temple save the game for the last time. Once inside,
go to Donovan and go past the 3 trials. If you die on the trials
you will have to start over from the 1st. The 1st trial is
tricky. You have to get Indy to go more south or he will get cut
all up. The 2nd trial is easy. All you have to do is step on
letters that spell out the word Indy keeps saying. Just wait
till he says the word. For the 3rd trial, immediatly possition
the pointer over the cave to the right and press return to go
there. Once inside, you must choose the correct grail from the
written version of the grail book the game comes with and use it
in the water. Then you can pick up the grail after rescuing your
father and give it to the knight. You can also give it to Elsa
and look at the seal once it is broken to use your whip to get
the grail back. Be sure to give it to the knight. After that,
the game ends!

There are three modes. Each come with different puzzles and solutions. I
recommend first try team mode because Sophia can give you some hints. Then
you can try wits mode, it has several very interesting puzzles. Fists mode
(action game) is optional because Indy 4 do not come with a good combat
system (it is the same one in Indy 3).

Stars (*) mark alternative possibilities.

	PART 1 (New York, Iceland, Tikali, Azores, College)

NEW YORK: Take the newspaper.
* find your way through the crates on the backside of the building
 (pushcrates) and use the fire escape.
* talk to doorman, "smart", "easy to understand".
* Fight doorman.
Give the paper to the stagehand, push the right and left lever and press
the button. Talk to Sophia and leave together with her for Iceland.

ICELAND: Talk to Heimdall; he tells you about Tikali and the Azores.

TIKALI: Hit the jungle rodent several times with the whip, until it runs to
the snake. Use the tree. Talk to Sternhart until he asks you the name
of Plato's lost dialogue. Tell him that you do not know the title. Then
talk to the parrot, ask him "Title?" and talk again to Sternhart. Inside
the pyramide, ask Sophia to keep Sternhart occupied. Go outside, take the
lamp and open it. Use the lamp to get the spiral design in the pyramide.
Then use the design with the animal head, pull it and open the grave.
Sternhart gets away with the disk. Take the bead and return to Iceland.

ICELAND: Use the bead in the eel's mouth; take the eel.

AZORES: Let Sophia first talk to Costa. Then trade him the eel for the
knowledge of the position of the lost dialogue.

COLLEGE: There are three possibilities to find the collection (changes
from game to game):
1: Take the gum from the desk in the library, use it with the coal chute in
   the furnace room. Take the wax cat figurine and melt it in the furnace.
2: Get the rag in the furnace room and the arrowhead in the room with the
   totempole. Use the rag with the arrowhead to produce a screwdriver and
   open the bookcase in the library.
3: Use the jar from the refrigerator in the office with the totempole. Pull
   the totempole under the hole in the ceiling and climb up. Open the urn
   and take the key. Push the crate in the totempole-room and open the
   chest behind it.
Talk to Sophia in the office and choose one of the three ways -- team,
wits, and fists.

				TEAM MODE

	PART 2 (Algier, Monte Carlo)

ALGIER: Go to the shopkeeper in the back alley and take the mask. Talk
to the man with the knives. Convince Sophia to volunteer for him and push
her as she hesitates. You will receive a knife this way.

MONTE CARLO: Talk to several people and ask them about Trottier. Sooner
or later you will meet him (a man in a brown suit). Talk to him in a very
polite and humble way till he is willing to take part in the seance.
* (indy) During the seance take the flashlight from the cabinet and the
  bedsheet. Open the fuse box and use the circuit breaker. Wear the
  bedsheet, the mask and the flashlight to produce a reasonable ghost.
* (sophia) When indy talk to Trottier outside, take notes on what he said
  (they varied from game to game). After entering the room, transfer control
  to sophia. Demand proof. Answer three questions as Trottier just said.
  Answer a random number.(may need several save-and-restore here) This
  solution does not require the mask.
Afterwards take the sunstone.

ALGIER: Talk again to the shopkeeper and show him the sunstone. He will
give you a map and a couple of camels; your first visit to the desert
fails. Next you have to trade several things with the shopkeeper and with
the grocer; the final goal is to get the squab-on-a-stick for the mask.
Give the squab to the beggar and receive a balloon ticket. Go to the roof,
enter the balloon and cut the rope with the knife.

	PART 3 (Desert)

BALLOON RIDE: A kind of arcade game, since the up and down movements are
coupled with movement in clockwise and counterclockwise directions. You
will find out about this. You must land several times and ask nomades for
the way to the X.

DIG SITE: Sophia disappears into the hole. Climb down the ladder into the
dark room, and get everything you can get: Sharp wood thing (ship rib),
long tubular thing (hose), blunt wood thing (peg), clay thing (clay jar).
At the truck you use the hose with the opened gas tank and the clay jar
with the hose; this fills the jar with gas. Go back to the dark room, open
the metal cap and pour the gas-filled jar into the gas filler pipe. Push
the little metal thing to turn on the generator. Then dig the crumbling
wall with the ship rib, put the peg into the mural and put the sunstone on
the peg. Look at the sunstone: the lost dialogue tells to align "darkness"
with the "horns"; do this and press the peg to open a secret door. Sophia
comes out and gives you a distributor cap and a fish-on-a-string. Turn off
the generator, open it and take the spark plug. Put the distributor cap
and the spark plug into the truck's engine. Leave for Crete.

	PART 4 (Crete)

RUINS: First find the surveyor's instrument and take it. Pick up all
stones around the tall horns; you will detect two statues (bull's head and
tail). In one of the entrances, there is a mural diagram with a bull's
head, horns and tail. According to this, put the surveyor's instrument on
the head statue and look through it to the left horn. Then put it on the
tail statue and look at the right horn. This gives you an X. Dig at the X
with the ship rib and find the moonstone. Go to the stone pedestal and use
the sun- and the moonstone with it. Align the disks according to the lost
dialogue (changes from game to game), press the spindle and detect a secret
door in the wall.

CAVES: Pick up two of the three stone heads. Go through the door and
get the third head with your whip. Find the room with the tall Minotaur
statue. Use the whip with its head, and then stand to the left of the big
head. The elevator takes you down to the dead Sternhart. Take the
worldstone and the staff. Examine the waterfall and use the chain hidden
behind it. Then find the room with the shelf and the closed door; open
the door by putting the three stone heads onto the shelf. Go through the
door and do three things. First, use the staff with the chock to free the
counterweight. Secondly, use the staff in the statue's mouth to start the
elevator. Thirdly, take the golden box, open it, put the two beads into it
and close it again.
Return to Sophia and enter the next room. Convince Sophia to let you
boost her through the hole in order to open the gate. In the next room use
the fish-on-a-string. It will point to Sophia's necklace. Talk to Sophia
and make her put the necklace into the golden box. Walk through all rooms
and use the fish-on-a-string. Somewhere it will point to the wall; dig
this wall with the rib and open the door behind. Use all three disks with
the spindle according to the lost dialogue. The Germans will kidnap Sophia
and steal the disks. Dig the rocks with the rib and return to the surface.

	PART 5 (Submarine)

Open the hatch, fight against the captain and enter the submarine. Use
the intercom to order "All hands to the bow". Go to the lower deck, take
the mug of porcelain and fill it with battery acid. Talk to Sophia from
the left neighboring room through the window in the wall and ask her to
distract the guard. Free Sophia and open the strong box with the help of
the acid. Inside the box you find the three disks and a tiny key. Get the
plunger. Unlock the emergency rudder control with the tiny key, break the
lever in the conning tower and repair it with the plunger. Steer the
submarine into the airlock (another fine(?) arcade game).

	PART 6 (Atlantis)

ENTRANCE: Find the wooden thing (ladder) in the dark and use it at the
stone rubble. Sophia is kidnapped by the Germans again. Climb the ladder,
open the stone thing and take the rod. Put a bead into the rod and light
the room. Use the disks with the spindle according to the lost dialogue,
but with north and south reversed (as "entrance is yielded only to contrary
minds"). The statue's mouth will open, and you feed a bead into it. The
door opens, you take the ladder and the three disks. Enter Atlantis.

The exact position of the interesting rooms in Atlantis changes from game
to game. Explore all shaded places (marked by a questionmark), open and
enter all grates. You must detect the following rooms and items.

ROOM WITH ROBOT PARTS 1: Take the bronze gear attached to the wall.

ROOM WITH ROBOT PARTS 2: Take the bronze spoked wheel lying in the

ROOM WITH EEL-FIGURINE: Get the eel-figurine from the cupboard.

SUBWAY: At the most southern point, in the outer cycle. Take the rib
cage from the skeleton.

HALLWAY: Fight against one of the German stooges (and defeat him). You
will get a bratwurst. Bait the rip cage with the bratwurst (in case you
took the sandwich from the kitchen in the submarine, you may bait the cage
with the sandwich).

CRAB ROOM: Use the baited rip cage in the pool to catch a crab.

STATUE ROOM 1: Contains a statue that looks like a cross between a bull
and a fish. Take the statue's head.

STATUE ROOM 2: Contains a large statue holding a cup. Use the ladder to
cross the hole in the floor. Take the stone cup. Don't forget to take the
ladder before leaving.

LAVA ROOM: Use the stone cup with the pedestal. Use the statue's head
with the plaque. This gives you a mug full of lava.

MACHINE ROOM: Repair the machine by putting the bronze spoked wheel onto
the peg. Fill the mug with lava into the funnel. Take the produced beads
and take the bronze spoked wheel before leaving.

PRISON ROOM: In the room where Sophia is kept imprisoned there are two
vents, one on the left side and one in the middle. The interesting vent is
the left one. From there you can put a bead into the sentry statue; it
will start moving, kill the German and destroy itself.

SENTRY ROOM: Contains three statues and a pool. To get rid of the water
you put a bead into the eel. Then put a bead into the smallest statue's
mouth. The door will open.

PRISON ROOM: Take the statue part from the destroyed statue. In order
to free Sophia, you have to enter the canal system.

	PART 7 (The inner cycle)

CANAL: Feed the crab to the octopus. Enter the canal, go to the other
side and put a bead into the crab mouth. The crab raft will start to
float.
Float to the left side, open the gates with the sun-, moon- or worldstone.
There are only two interesting places in the canal system. One contains a
cupboard with a crescent shaped gear. Take the gear, close the cupboard
and look at it. You see a diagram with several wheels and moving arms.
The other interseting place contains the large bronze statue and the chain.
Use the ladder with the statue and open the chest plate. Look at the chest
plate; you have to put the bronze gear, the bronze wheel, the statue part
and the crescent gear into the right places, as described by the diagram on
the cupboard (the wheel and the statue part belong onto the central peg).
Make that the statue moves the right arm. Then fasten the chain to the
statue arm and to the bronze loop. Make the statue to move its right arm
back. The chain will break the door and a hinge pin comes off. Take the
hinge pin and return to Sophia.

PRISON: Give the hinge pin to Sophia. Open the cage. Sophia uses the
pin and gets free. Open the cage a second time to get the pin.

CANAL: Finally, you enter the inner cycle of Atlantis through the broken
door. Sophia is getting crazy and leads you to a room with a lava pit.
Look at Sophia, feed a bead to her necklace and use the box with the
necklace. You get rid of Nur-Ab-Sal in the lava pit. Pick up the scepter
(near the skeletons). In the hall and near the hulking machine you see two
Atlantean graffittis: One shows the lever positions to start the hulking
machine (upward arrow), the other shows how to stop it. Use the hinge pin
and the sceptre as levers in two slots. Feed a bead to the mouth.

VOLCANIC AREA: Cross the area by trial and error. In the background,
you see a picture of three cocentric cycles: This picture encodes the
positions of noon sun (sundisk), of full moon (moondisk) and of the volcano
(worlddisk). In the central room with the frog statue and the spindle,
align the three disks according to this picture. Now the Germans appear
again. The first German is no problem, he will kill himself. Tell the
second German that you are going to kill him as soon as you are a god.
Thus you get rid of him, too, and finish the game.

One of three places (cleft, gap, and notch) in mountain will lead to an
entrance. Out side the entrance, close the crate and get invoice. Inside
you will find an entrenching tool. Close the door near the tool. Use
sunstone to get carved sign. Open tool to dig a way out the cave. Return
to port, show invoice to get the gas bag for balloon. Use sign to exchange

will get to the map room. Use three stones to open the door. Use the
home-made detector to find another beads and a secret door at the next two
rooms. Entering the secret door, you will find a bead and a subway car.
Feed the car with the bead. O.K. Now you are at Atlantis. All three
modes converges here.

rest of the labyrinth. A door is blocked with a big slab. Push it SEVERAL
times. After pushing the stone slab covering the door proceed to beat up
all the gards, with 2 exceptions. The first one, Hans, is too strong to
beat, so hide behind a stone slab and when he comes by, push it over onto
him. Also, Arnold is too strong to beat. Use the ship's rib to pry the
boulder in the next room over so that it will roll onto him. When that
doesn't work, go find a stalactite (on ceiling in another room) and pry the
boulder from outside the doorway it's wedged in, that will take care of
Arnold. Then look in the pit to find Sophia, search Arnold's body, and you
have everything you need to get to Atlantis. The stories converges here.

@node "It came from the Desert"
@remark H
Before attempting to go into the ants' nest, you should first save Elmer to
get more flamethrower fuel. Some time between the 8th and 10th (I don't
remember the exact day), he will leave a note in his station saying that
he is going hiking in the SW Volcanic Cone. Go to the volcano, fight the
ants, and next day, visit Elmer's station. He'll thank you for saving his
life and give you more flamethrower fuel.

The entrance to the ants' nest will never appear on the main map, but
there are several other ways to get there:

	- By taking a flight from Hilber's Field.
	- By driving a tank from a battle going on at a nearby location.
	- By going south when you are in a battle at the M1 mine.

The entrance to the nest doesn't stay open long enough for you to get in
before the ants start invading the various locations in the town, so you'll
have to wait until they do. The 11th is the best day to enter the hole since
it is very hot and there are few ants around. If you try cooler days,
there will probably be too many of them around for you to handle. Also,
if you decide to get to the hole by plane, you can land safely on the dirt
road parallel to the tracks leading to the M1 mine.

For those who are having trouble getting to the ants hideout, it is
located about one screen due south of mine one. The best way to
gain access to the tunnel is on the morning of day 11. Go to the
airport and get the plane. Fly to mine one (southeast from the
airport) and land on the road in front of mine one. Get out of
your plane and walk to the center of the main building of mine one.
Walk south about one and a half screens and the hole should open
and a ant will crawl out. You must kill the ant and run to the
hole before it closes. You will get about 4 or 5 chances to get
in. Once you are in the hole you will automatically have the flame
thrower and the timed dynamite charges. There are two levels of
the ants chambers, a top level and a bottom level. You must make a
map as to where you have checked. You can do this by putting the
game on pause with <LEFT MOUSE>. This will keep the ants
off you while you draw maps. Once you have made it to the bottom
chamber repeat the map drawing till you find the queen ants
chamber. You will need it to get out after you plant the charges.
To plant the charges once in the queens chambers move close to the
queens left side of her body. Once you walk around her left side
the music will stop and a slow ticking will start. You will have
to get back to the place you entered on the second level. If you
get back before the bomb goes off you will win the game.

It means nothing to gather information about the ants through
out the game. The mayor will not listen to anything you
present in evidence. He will call an alert only after his car
gets eaten on the afternoon of June 11.

It will do no good to escape the hospital as you have to sleep
anyway. Even thou it will do no good to escape from the
hospital it's a fun arcade sequence to play.

Even with the solves given above you still must learn how to
fly the airplane. To get the right altitude to save fuel,
after you take off fly east or west. Back off the throttle
till the shadow on the ground comes up and just touches the
wing of the plane. You will then have the right speed and
altitude. The faster you fly and the higher you go the more
fuel you will use. These settings will conserve enough fuel
to let you fly and not run out of gas and return to the
airfield and land if you blow it getting into the ant hole.

Here are the locations of the secret rooms:
a) There are two hidden worlds behind the main tower, another sweets
level (including a Liquorice Allsorts World, the infamous Bouncing Jelly
World, another Cake World and an upside down Jelly World) and an extra
scrolling section. To reach them, run along the ground floor - avoiding
the doors - then go up and over the first flight of stairs. From the
bottom of the second (smaller) tower, make your way up to the landing
above Dr. Maybe's final door and run left into the wall. You'll disappear
behind the screen and arrive in the Secret Tower room.
b) Once you've	finished the bath level, drop down to the bottom of the
castle, and walk left until you get to the small snowman statues. Jump on
these and they'll turn into a moving platform. Once you get to the top of
the screen, walk left into thin air and jump. By now you should be next
to some doors. Go through them for bonus city!!
c) Go to the same place after finishing the circus room (the last room
before the end of game baddy) and stand on the golden snowmen again. A
platform made of two bonud blocks should float upwards, revealing a
secret tunnel. At the end of this are even more extra lives and stars.
d) Do as above after the sweets level, but go to the left of the castle.
Go on the snowmen once more, and at the top of the screen grab the
umbrella and collect all the goodies while you're floating down.
e) On the second teddy bear level, keep jumping over the spikes until you
see a hole above you. Jump through this and catapult yourself off the bus
there. Once you've done this, get on the higher level and keep walking
left, bounce on the trampoline and collect the wings. Now fly along the
top of the screen to the right and you should find a different exit. Go
through this for a special bonus level.
f) Complete a level with does not feature a guardian and you will always
find something new when you return to the castle "selection" screen. In
one case you will find a whole sequence of lifts and things (see above)
that lead to a door that you cannot normally get to. If you go to the
very right of the factory screen and look down you will see a load of
crowns, which you can access after coming back from other levels.
g) It is possible to finish Robocod by only doing half the levels. A
choice of two new doors to enter is given when the correct level is
completed. Start by completing the Fluffy Toys one and then by doing the
Cars one.
h)Finish the bath levels and as soon as you come out of the door run
straight to the golden snowmen in the bottom far left outside the
castle. Jump into these snowmen and you'll float upwards to the top
of the screen where you'll be met by a door. Getting through this
door is tricky but worth it. Inside are loads of extra lives and
energy stars. Go to the same place after finishing the circus room
(the last room before the end of game baddy) and stand on the golden
snowmen again. A platform made of two bonus blocks ahould float
upwards revealing a secret tunnel. At the end of this are even more
extra lives and stars.

Okay, enough is enough! Seems that everything you try to do lately turns out
wrong -- like getting on this stupid bus. Not a seat left anywhere! That's it.
As soon as this dumb bus driver manages to get you to your nice, comfy house,
you're going to go look for your wossname...lucky charm. It's time things
started going right again. Meanwhile, there's not much to do for the moment
except INVENTORY to see what you're carrying. Not much. Nothing else much is
going to happen for a move or two, so you might as well WAIT a turn or two
until the ticket inspector asks you for your ticket. GIVE TICKET TO INSPECTOR,
and he will tell you that your destination is two stops from here. Pay
attention to what you're doing here: If you get off too soon or too late,
you're finished before you start!

As soon as the bus "sails past a bus stop," PUSH BUTTON. Then WAIT a couple
of turns again until the bus stops. When the doors open, GET OFF BUS. The
inspector will throw you your keyring. (Don't ask ME how you lost it! You had
it the last time you checked.)

The keyring will land in the street. GET KEYRING. As you bend over to
retrieve the keys, you find you are about to be hit by a bus. There is nothing
useful you can do to avoid being hit at this point. No matter what you type for
the next two moves, nothing will help.

Just in the nick of time a very strange character will appear, rescue you
from certain death, mumble something about Jannedor the witch, and hand you a
document. READ DOCUMENT, and you'll be told to read the document that came with
your package. Then the guardian (so THAT'S what he is!) will make a few more
comments and disappear. Nothing left now but to get started on your mission.

One thing to remember: If you vary from this walkthru, or if at any point,
you see a message that says, "you feel a little less lucky than you did a
moment ago," STOP THERE. You will need ALL your luck at the end of the game,
and if you lose any, it means you've done something wrong (or at least not
QUITE right).

First OPEN GATE, then go north into your Front Garden. OPEN DOOR WITH IRON
KEY, and go north again into the Hallway. Go northwest into the Bedroom.
There's a cello case here which looks inviting, so OPEN CELLO CASE, and you'll
see a harmonica. Leave it there for now, but TAKE CASE. It'll come in handy for
carrying things.

LOOK UNDER BED, and you'll find (what else?) a woolly sock. TAKE SOCK, and
OPEN WARDROBE THEN LOOK IN IT. TAKE SHOES THEN PUT THEM IN CASE.

Go north into the Kitchen. Ignore the refrigerator for now, but LOOK ON
TABLE. You'll see a tin opener. TAKE OPENER THEN PUT IT IN CASE. Now DROP
TICKET AND DOCUMENT.

Going east will take you into the Conservatory and about this time the phone
will ring in the Library. Go south and ANSWER PHONE. Xam will start screaming
at you to get over to his house fast. (At this point you have NO idea where his
house is, but don't worry about it: He's already been kidnapped, so there's no
need to hurry.)

Going north will take you back to the Conservatory. EXAMINE TABLE, and you'll
find a red tablecloth. Since you haven't seen a towel anywhere, a tablecloth is
the next best thing, so TAKE TABLECLOTH. Now OPEN DOOR WITH IRON KEY, and go
north into the Back Garden. Here you'll see a pair of secateurs and a pair of
gloves. You'll definitely need the gloves, and you MIGHT need the secateurs
(cutters, to you Americans). TAKE ALL and WEAR GLOVES.

Go north again, then east into the Grassy Field. Here you'll see a nasty bull
in the corner of the field. If you go south from here, you'll find your way
east is blocked by a barbed-wire fence. The problem here is to get to the east
either from here or by going southeast from the Grassy Field. There are two
solutions, either of which will earn you the same number points. You need only
use ONE of the solutions, or you can do both if you just want the exercise.
You'll only get points for your first action.

If you want to deal with the bull (in the Grassy Field), WAVE CLOTH AT BULL.
The bull will charge at you. Now THROW CLOTH AT BULL, and it will become
entangled in his horns, blinding him. You can now go southeast into the Orchard
where you can DROP CUTTERS.

If you'd rather deal with the fence, go south from the Grassy Field (you
should already be wearing the gloves), and HOLD WIRE THEN CUT IT WITH CUTTERS.
Now you can go east into the Orchard where you can DROP CLOTH AND CUTTERS.

From the Orchard go east. You'll see a plastic bottle in the weeds. GET
BOTTLE THEN EXAMINE IT. What you've found is a handy little bottle in which
there is water mixed with oil. Hmm.

Go west, then south twice into the boathouse. First EXAMINE DOOR, and you'll
see it needs oiling. Aha! But how to deal with the watered-down oil? There are
also a can of worms and a mousetrap here. GET ALL then LOOK IN BOAT. There's
BUNG in there! Oh Boy! Er, uh, what's a bung? Well, it's a PLUG that goes in a
barrel to keep the good stuff from running out. GET BUNG and PUT CAN IN CASE.

Let's go deal with the oil-in-water problem. Go back north, northwest twice,
west, south three times, and west into your Kitchen. Now OPEN FRIDGE, PUT
PLASTIC BOTTLE IN FRIDGE, then CLOSE FRIDGE. Now go east, north three times,
southeast, east, and south.

Here we are at Xam's Front Garden. OPEN DOOR WITH RUSTY KEY, and go southwest
into the Messy Kitchen, and west into the Dining Room, then LOOK ON TABLE. GET
CANDLE AND MATCHES, and go south. About this time, you'll hear a knock on the
kitchen door. Ignore it: it's the postman, and you can't make it to the door
in time anyway. Go southwest then south, and you'll find yourself under a holly
bush where there's a magpie. LISTEN, and the magpie will give you a pair of
spectacles to get rid of you. WEAR SPECTACLES. Now go north, northeast, north,
east, northeast, and LOOK IN MAILBOX. There's a note in there. GET and READ
NOTE. You'll be told to call the post office to arrange for the delivery of a
package.

Go southwest, west, south, and DIAL 300. The voice will tell you he'll send
Lebling back with the package. Go north and east, then OPEN TRAP. Go down
(those spectacles will allow you to see in the dark!) and TAKE CHEESE, then go
back up.

About the same time you go down into the cellar, the postman will knock on
the door. He should still be there when you come back up, but he won't give you
the package because you're not Xam. He'll lock it up in the mailbox. If you go
out and try to open the mailbox with your plastic key, it won't fit.

By now you should have noticed a timid mouse dashing in and out of the
kitchen. Let's deal with the little bugger. This trap is a home-brew device,
and you have to deal with it quite specifically to get the mouse. First PUT
CHEESE ON TRAP, then SET TRAP, and DROP TRAP. (Do NOT say "PUT TRAP DOWN": It
won't work!) Now let's do a little locksmithing.

OPEN MATCHBOX THEN GET MATCH. Next, LIGHT MATCH THEN LIGHT CANDLE WITH MATCH.
Finally, HEAT PLASTIC KEY WITH CANDLE. AGAIN. (You must heat the key twice for
it to be soft enough to change shape.) Go northeast (your candle will go out),
and OPEN MAILBOX WITH PLASTIC KEY. Voila! The parcel! OPEN PARCEL, and GET
CHARM THEN READ LETTER.

Examine the charm. You'll see the word "OOJIMY" inscribed on it. If you've
read your newspaper, you'll know this charm freezes things. Speaking of
freezing things, it should be about time to check the fridge.

GO north, northwest, west, south twice, west, and OPEN FRIDGE. Now GET MILK
BOTTLE THEN DRINK MILK. EXAMINE PLASTIC BOTTLE, and you discover that the water
has frozen leaving only oil behind. GET OIL WITH MILK BOTTLE. Now east, north
twice, east, southeast, south, and southwest back to the kitchen.

EXAMINE TRAP -- there SHOULD be a mouse in it. If not, just wander around for
a couple of moves, away from the kitchen, and you will eventually catch the
mouse. GET MOUSE, and PUT ALL BUT CHARM IN CASE.

Go northeast, north, southeast, and south. GET BOTTLE. PUT OIL ON RUNNERS
then DROP BOTTLE. OPEN DOOR, and the door will open easily (and quietly).
You'll see the crazy gardener oiling his machine gun. He'll be startled by your
appearance and run off leaving a sack behind. (Unfortunately, he takes his
machine gun with him.) LOOK IN SACK, and you'll see an amethyst charm. GET
AMETHYST CHARM THEN EXAMINE IT. You'll find the word "DOODAH" on it. This charm
will cause rain. (Boy, THAT oughta come in handy!) DROP SACK.

If you EXAMINE CANOE, you'll find that it's not seaworthy. Let's fix that.
PUT MOUSE IN HOLE, PUT CANOE IN WATER, then GET IN CANOE and GET PADDLE. We're
ready to go exploring!

Well, don't just sit there in the dumb canoe: Let's get going! Go south twice
to the Pagoda. DROP CASE AND PADDLE. Now GET OPENER AND CAN. LEAVE CANOE and go
down the steps. Your path will be blocked by a large mound of dirt. Who likes
dirt better than worms? OPEN CAN WITH OPENER, then DROP OPENER, and PUT WORMS
ON DIRT. DROP CAN. The worms will make short work of loosening the dirt. MOVE
DIRT then go east twice, and you'll find some diving equipment. GET ALL, then
go west twice, and up. Time to go for a swim!

First REMOVE TROUSERS AND SHIRT. Now WEAR WETSUIT, FLIPPERS, AND MASK. (Don't
put on the aqualung yet: You start using air as soon as you put it on, and you
don't have much to spare.) Do an INVENTORY here just to be sure you're not
carrying anything except the charms. It's okay to keep wearing the spectacles
and gloves though.

Go north, down, and northwest. WEAR AQUALUNG, then go north, and you'll find
a hatch. OPEN HATCH and go down. You'll see a panel, so EXAMINE PANEL, then
EXAMINE BUTTONS. Now PUSH LEFT BUTTON, then REMOVE AQUALUNG. EXAMINE DOOR, and
TURN WHEEL THEN OPEN DOOR. Go east and down. EXAMINE DESK. On it, you see a
notecase. EXAMINE NOTECASE and TAKE COIN. OPEN DOOR then go east. You'll see a
chandelier that appears to be concealing something, but it's too high for you
to reach.

Go west, up, west, and PUSH RIGHT BUTTON. Now east, down, east, and WAIT for
the water to reach your scrawny neck. WEAR AQUALUNG, and WAIT until "everything
is underwater." Go up and EXAMINE CHANDELIER, then GET CHARM. Go down, west,
up, west, and OPEN HATCH. Then go up, south, southeast, up, south, and you're
back at the Pagoda.

Now that you're safe on shore, EXAMINE UNICORN CHARM, and you'll find the
word "WATCHERCALLIT" on it. This is the charm that makes things come back to
you. Drop the aqualung, wetsuit, flippers, and mask, then WEAR TROUSERS AND
SHIRT. GET IN CANOE, and GET PADDLE AND CASE. Now go north then southwest, and
you're at the Conifer Wood. DROP PADDLE THEN LEAVE CANOE, and go south to the
Village Green.

Let's visit the Bakery first. Go northwest and READ NOTICE. Now ASK FOR JOB,
and the Baker will give you some instructions. Go down then east to the Larder.
That flour sack looks promising. OPEN SACK then SIFT FLOUR WITH SIEVE. Another
charm! Go west to the kitchen. EXAMINE TABLE and you'll see a baking tin with
some dough in it. You don't want the baker to find out you stole the charm, so
PUT CHARM IN TIN. OPEN OVEN, and PUT TIN IN OVEN THEN CLOSE OVEN. PUSH BUTTON
and the bread will be done to perfection.

But WAIT! You don't want to be stuck here baking bread for the rest of your
life, do you? PUSH BUTTON again, OPEN OVEN, and GET BREAD. About this time, the
baker will show up and search you for the charm. He won't find anything, of
course! Go up, and the baker will follow you. If you try to leave with the
bread, you won't be able to because the baker wants to see how you've done.
SHOW BREAD TO BAKER, and he'll take a bite out of it. He'll be so disgusted
with the overdone bread, he'll throw it (and you) out the door!

Now GET BREAD THEN EAT IT. You'll be left with the pelican charm. EXAMINE
PELICAN CHARM and you'll find the word "DOOFER" on it. This charm will animate
things. DROP CASE.

Next stop: the Village Pub. Go southeast into the pub. Reading the sign
behind the bar will tell you that you have only enough money for a beer. Since
it's the only money you have in the world, you don't want to spend it
foolishly! WATCHERCALLIT COIN, then BUY BEER WITH COIN. As soon as you buy the
beer, the coin will reappear in your hand! You can DRINK BEER if you wish, but
what you MUST do is WATCHERCALLIT GLASS.

Take a look at the hearth. There's a raging fire in there. Try a little more
of your magic: OOJIMY FIRE. The fire will go out, leaving an ash behind. GET
ASH. Ignore the bartender's insults, go north to the Beer Garden, and down into
the well. There you will see another coin. GET TWO-FERG COIN and climb back up.
If you EXAMINE TWO-FERG COIN, you'll discover that this one can only be spent
once, so you'd better spend it wisely!

Go south and northwest. The bartender will snatch the glass from you when you
leave, but you'll soon have it back again. Go southwest to the carousel. DOOFER
UNICORN. The animal will spring to life and fly away, leaving the saddle
behind. While you're here, DOOFER FIRE ENGINE, and it will take off, leaving
its ladder behind. GET SADDLE then northeast and GET SOCK. Now PUT ASH IN CASE.
Go northeast into the Post Office. Take note of the ringing bell on the way in.
When the Postmistress shows up, SEND SADDLE TO STATION.

(I have to apologize here. There is absolutely NO CLUE at this point to
indicate that you should mail the saddle to the station. WHAT Station? However,
by the time you find out about the Station and figure out that you have to mail
the saddle to it, you will have gone a LONG way out of your way, and will have
to go through some really strange shenanigans to get the job done. It's a lot
easier to pretend you have ESP, and just mail the dratted thing NOW!)

Anyway, the Postmistress will weigh the saddle and tell you it comes to two
fergs. There goes your one-time-only two-ferg coin! GIVE TWO-FERG COIN TO
POSTMISTRESS.

When you entered the Post Office, you saw a safe set into the wall. It sure
would be interesting to get into that safe, but how can you do that with the
stupid bell announcing your entrance every time? At this point the Postmistress
will bend down behind the counter looking for something. While she's down
there, PUT SOCK IN BELL and that will take care of the alarm. Now you can OPEN
DOOR and go southwest.

You can immediately go back northeast to the Post Office; this time you will
enter silently, and it will be empty. EXAMINE SAFE and you will notice four
handles at the four corners of the safe.

Playing with the handles quickly reveals that they are interactive. So
Merlin, the master safe-cracker, will save you some time. TURN BOTTOM RIGHT
HANDLE. TURN TOP RIGHT HANDLE. TURN BOTTOM RIGHT HANDLE. TURN BOTTOM RIGHT
HANDLE. Finally, TURN TOP LEFT HANDLE, and the safe will be unlocked!

OPEN SAFE and LOOK IN SAFE, then GET CHARM, and you'll have the fifth (and
last!) charm. OPEN DOOR and go southwest. EXAMINE DRAGON CHARM, and you'll find
the word "THINGY" on it. This charm clears up the weather.

GET CASE, go southwest, then DROP CASE. If you LOOK THROUGH WINDOW, you'll
notice the clockmaker is busy at work, and there's an oil lamp burning in the
workshop. You need to get him out of the shop: time to get destructive.

GET BOTTLE then KNOCK ON DOOR. The clockmaker will leave the workshop to
answer the door. THROW BOTTLE AT LAMP. The clockmaker will rush back in, find
the fire, and run out the door. The place is now yours to explore.

GET LADDER and go southwest. If you EXAMINE ladder, you'll discover that
there are a few rungs missing. That stool might make up for the missing rungs,
but it's awfully hot! OOJIMY STOOL and GET STOOL, then go east in the clock.
LEAN LADDER AGAINST GIRDER, and DROP STOOL. Before we go up, let's go get some
supplies.

Go west and northeast. GET SHOES THEN WEAR THEM. GET HARMONICA, ASH,
MATCHBOX, AND CANDLE. Go back southwest, and east. GET ON STOOL, then CLIMB
LADDER. JUMP north, and you're on a platform. Read the description carefully.
You need to have the Rain Weatherman close to you. If it is, fine. If the Sun
Weatherman is close to you, THINGY. The weather will change, sending the Sun
Weatherman outside, and the Rain Weatherman inside. Now EXAMINE RAIN WEATHERMAN
and TAKE HAT. HOLD ONTO RAIN WEATHERMAN and DOODAH. As it begins to rain,
you'll be carried outside with the Rain Weatherman. There, you'll see a
friendly cloud, which will come to a halt near you.

GET ON CLOUD, then DOOFER CLOUD, and say goodbye to the village!

After a short (but thrilling) flight, the cloud will deposit you gently at
the Railroad Station. Get up, then READ SIGN, and you will be told positively
that Mama Don't Allow No Busking Around Here. (Or something like that.) For
those of you unfamiliar with the term, a "busker" is an itinerant musician or
actor.

Go east twice to the platform, then north twice, and you'll come to a door
marked "Private." OPEN DOOR and go west into the Postal Depot. There's the
saddle you shipped. GET SADDLE, and go east, south twice, and west.

BUY TICKET WITH COIN. The Stationmaster will happily tell you that it's not
enough, so let's make some more money. PUT COIN IN HAT then PUT HAT DOWN. The
tourists around here are pretty hard to please, so you'll need all the help you
can get. DOOFER SHOES then play harmonica. A tourist will drop a coin in your
hat, but it's a foreign coin and useless. Keep playing the harmonica, and
eventually the Stationmaster will get disgusted, and will offer to sell you a
ticket at half-price!

GET ONE FERG COIN, and BUY TICKET WITH ONE FERG COIN. Unfortunately, your bad
luck is still holding. The ticket will be blown out of your hand.

Pay attention to which direction your ticket is being blown. It seems that
there may be a variable involved here, but the following directions worked for
me. Go east, GET TICKET, north, GET TICKET, north, GET TICKET, north, and GET
TICKET. When you finally get the ticket, you should be on the Tracks; at this
point, the train will start leaving!

RUN AFTER TRAIN twice, and you should catch it. When the guard shows up, SHOW
TICKET TO GUARD. There's nothing left to do now but WAIT until the train stops
at the Mountain. Go west, and you'll see the Unicorn grazing peacefully nearby.
(Now you know why you've been messing with that stupid saddle all this time!)

PUT SADDLE ON UNICORN, GET ON UNICORN, and DOOFER UNICORN. You'll go for a
quick ride to the castle. GET OFF UNICORN, and go down. REMOVE SHOES THEN DROP
THEM. Go east and north, then east and down to the gaol. OPEN DOOR and go north
into Xam's cell.

Examining the rope and the hatch will quickly reveal how the door works, and
give you a fairly simple solution. TIE ROPE TO MANACLES. Then WAKE XAM. He'll
make a lot of noise and summarily be rushed off by the guard, leaving you
trapped in the cell.

You need to find a way to have the hatch door shut with you inside. Hey,
piece of cake! First, GET MATCH THEN LIGHT IT. Now, LIGHT CANDLE WITH MATCH,
then PUT CANDLE IN GLASS. WATCHERCALLIT MATCHBOX. (I'll tell you why in a
minute.) PUT GLASS UNDER ROPE, and quickly go north into the dumbwaiter. WAIT
and the candle will burn through the rope, the hatch will slam shut, and the
opposite door will open!

Now, about the matchbox: If you leave the Watchercallit spell on the glass,
it will reappear in your hand after you put it under the rope. Due to what I
can only assume is a bug in the game, it will still be under the rope and burn
through it at the same time! However, if it is a bug, they may fix it, so it's
better to do the whole thing legitimately.

Go north through the Kitchen and up. EXAMINE FIREPLACE in the Hall, and
you'll see that it is immaculate. Keep that in mind. Now go northeast, OPEN
DOOR, and east twice.

You are now in the Jewel Room. If you EXAMINE DOME, you'll find it's a cube
puzzle! EXAMINE BLOCKS, and you'll see the order of the blocks. What you are
seeing is a Magic Cube Puzzle. For those of you who are not familiar with it, a
Magic Cube is a puzzle in which you have to arrange numbers so that they add up
horizontally or vertically to the same number.

Since the numbers in this puzzle range from 1 to 9, the magic number has to
be 15. There are only two ways to get the numbers to line up properly. Since
the "4" can only end up in the lower right-hand corner, that narrows the
solution down to only one possible combination.

This is just like one of the plastic puzzles you played with when you were a
kid, so let's get started. SLIDE 5, SLIDE 8, SLIDE 1, SLIDE 6, SLIDE 7,
SLIDE 2, SLIDE 9, SLIDE 5, SLIDE 3, SLIDE 4.

When you've successfully completed the puzzle, the dome will shatter,
scattering glass shards everywhere. (You ARE still wearing the gloves, right?)
GET BRACELET, then PUT ALL CHARMS ON BRACELET.

You're now ready to deal with Jannedor. Go west twice, southwest, northwest,
up twice, and you're outside two doors.

If you have not lost ANY of your luck, you'll choose the right door, and all
will be well; however, if you HAVE lost even the smallest amount of luck, you
haven't a prayer!

OPEN LEFT DOOR, and go north. Jannedor (lucky for you) is arguing with Xam
out on the balcony. You'll immediately see a crystal ball on the table. GET
CRYSTAL BALL then go south to get out of there before she catches you!

Go down twice, and southeast to the Hall. Take the time to LOOK IN BALL. The
crystal ball will show you four possible futures. You want to make sure that
the future that will be to your advantage is the one that happens. Keep looking
in the crystal ball until you see the scene where Jannedor ends up in the Great
Hall, and glances at the fireplace. Now "fix" this future in place with magic:
DOOFER BALL!

Why do you suppose she looked at the fireplace? Perhaps because it didn't
look the way it was supposed to. PUT ASH ON HEARTH. That oughta do it! Go up
into the chimney.

WAIT, and eventually Jannedor will show up and reach into the chimney to find
out where the ash came from. Quickly PUT BRACELET ON WRIST.

You will find yourself (now dressed as a Guardian) right back where it all
started, with you about to be hit by a bus. There's nothing to do but WAIT,
because you are GOING to be hit by the bus and you are GOING to die.

- Defence of the Wall

As soon as the screen changes start pressing fire to launch rocks. Use
oil when time is short or when two or more enemies are coming up the
same ladder. Even though it says that oil is limited, there are at least
five cauldrons at your disposal.

- Entry to Town

As soon as the screen has loaded push right and keep pushing right until
the end. When an enemy appears keep fire pressed until he is slain.
Release fire and your man should run straight up the drawbridge. Repeat
this until you get into town.

- Attack on the Wall

Push the joystick forwards as soon as the screen changes. Keep pushing
forwards until the wall is taken. Use <FIRE> to ward off the rocks until
the top is reached.

- Game Strategy

At the start of the game ORLEANS must be taken. Select 'Start A
Campaign' and then displacement to move north into Orleans. Here you
should encounter your first battle.

- Battle Tactics

Hold your ground and wait to be attacked. As soon as the enemy move,
shower them with arrows and then with mortars. Move your troops forward
to protect your archers and send your cavalry out (they are likely to
be killed). While your troops are fighting, remember to fire your
arrows if the remainder of the enemy moves forward to attack.

On the defeat of the enemy, choose 'Offensive' and attack Orleans. Use
the 'Entry in to town' and 'Attack on the Wall' tips to succeed. After
capturing Orleans move north east into Champagne and take Rheims to
crown the king.

After the coronation move north taking each town in every province until
you have reached the northern most province. Sweep anti-clockwise until
each province has been taken.

Joan's army soon becomes depleted; choose 'Royal Army' and then 'Mod-
ification' to top up her army. About 2,000 archers and 3,000 troops are
enough. To pay for this collect the tithe in September but forget about
the other taxes. This will avoid any uprising, but means that you will
have to ransom some hostages. Choose 'Diplomacy' and then 'Liberation',
deal with Henry VI and use Regnault of Chatres and Tremoille as ambass-
adors. The meeting place does not really matter.

- Ransom Demand Guidelines

Duke of Bedford 	$4,000,000
Duke of Warwick 	$2,000,000
Duke of Gloucester	$2,000,000
John Talbot		$1,000,000
Count of Suffolk	$1,000,000
Cardinal of Winchester	$1,000,000
Captain Falstaff	$1,000,000

If you are really desperate halve the ransom. If your coffers are
overflowing, execute one of them using the 'Royal Justice' Menu, which
will reduce the number of armies that Henry VI can control.

Any French characters caught should be executed promptly. If there are
no hostages when payday comes choose 'Helping Hand' and kidnap one. Do
not try for the Dukes because these attempts are most likely to fail.
Remember to pay well - $20,000 is the right incentive. If Joan is
caught, Richemont, War General is a good replacement.

There is a section in Chapter 4 where you have to go through the right
door. The best thing to do is to save the game before you go through a
door, and then if it is the wrong door just load the saved game and try
again.

If you want to try and make any sense of the plot and what happens, then
have a pen and paper ready and make a note of every major thing you find
out, as it will help you to understand what has happened at the end of the
game.

substitute one of your players for your opponents goalie. This sub. goalie
is usually pretty useless.
Substitute the opposing goalkeeper twice and he will not save your shots.

Keep pressing <R> when you take a penalty. This will show you where the
player's going to kick the ball.

Switch on autofire, or repeatedly press <FIRE> and the result will be that
your keeper will save the ball every time.

This cheat requires really fast autofire, but you may be able to emulate it
on a joystick/pad by pressing <FIRE> really quickly. During play, if you
line up the man where you want, and then press down the autofire, it will
generally throw the ball down the center of the lane. The less force there
is, the closer to the center of the lane the ball will be bowled. If you
put your man to the far right, and put the speed up to almost full force,
you can generally bowl a perfect strike. Its a very useful technique.

Also, if you have a single pin left, or a similar situation in your game,
then this is an excellent technique to line up the ball.

NOTE: This cheat will not guarantee a strike, or spare every time.

@node "Kings Quest 1"
@remark S
King Edward's domain has been ravaged. Through trickery, three of the King's
items of power have been stolen from him. The kingdom lies in ruin. Its down-
fall is imminent. It is up to you, Sir Graham, to recover the King's treasures
. Succeed and you shall be crowned King of Daventry!  Fail and the worst of
fates shall befall you.

One word of caution before you start: Never drop anything until you're told
to do so. Once an item is dropped in this game, you cannot pick it up again.
For some reason, you're never weighed down by too many items; so you should
be able to pick up and carry every item with you at all times.	Also, in or-
der to get maximum points, you must pick up everything you can and look at it
, read it, or whatever is required.  (I lost 2 points for pouring some water
on the ground!) Enough said.

Begin your quest by going northwest to the garden. Once there, pick a carrot
and go west to the other side of the garden, south to the left of the castle
and west to the rock. Stand on the north side of the rock and move it. Doing
so reveals a dark hole. Look in the hole and then get the dagger. Then go
west and swim west across the pond (both screens). Once out of the pond, go
north to the well and west to the gate in the corral.

Open the gate and enter the corral. When you see the goat, show it the carrot
. Now he'll follow you wherever you go. This is important as you'll soon see.
Exit the corral and head west twice. You may or may not see a fairy godmother
handing out blessings. If you do see her, she'll give you a short lived pro-
tective spell. If you don't see her, no problem.  She'll pop up every now and
then.

Now go north to the clover patch and get a clover. This is a four-leaf clover
and will protect you from Leprechauns if the need arises. Go north to the
wooden bridge. (Goat still with you?) As you start to cross the bridge, an
ugly troll bars the way and refuses to let you pass unless you throw him a
treasure. However, your goat, which hates trolls, rushes the troll and butts
him off the bridge! The troll is swept downriver, never to be seen again. The
goat, having fulfilled its use, strolls away.  So wave goodbye and cross the
bridge and continue north.

You've found a crotchety old gnome and when you talk to him, he informs you
that he has something to give you that might be useful...but only if you can
guess his name! The crusty old fellow gives you three chances. Type "IFNKVOHG
ROGHPRM" and the gnome, in amazement, says "That's Right!" and leaves a hand-
ful of magic beans laying on the ground. The gnome's name, by the way, is a
cryptogram. The alphabet's been reversed and the new letter set has been sub-
stituted for "Rumpelstiltskin".

Get the beans and go east to another wooden bridge. Be careful you don't fall
in the gorge! Cross the bridge and go east to the flower patch. Plant the
beans here and all of a sudden, a huge beanstalk stretches up out of sight
into the clouds! Don't climb it yet, though. Go east and swim east across the
lake. When you exit the lake, continue east Look in the hole in the big rock
as you pass...what an odd green glowing!) Go east again.  A little dwarf may
come and make a quick inspection of your possessions to see if there's any-
thing of value. You don't have anything of note and he leaves. Now go east
once more to the little beach by the river. Get the pebbles you see laying
here then go west back to the beanstalk. CAUTION! Save your game here. Clim-
bing the beanstalk is a risky business and you'll most certainly fall off it
many times before you reach the top.

Climb the beanstalk until it enters the clouds. Leave the beanstalk by going
east into the clouds and continue east until you enter an area of trees. When
you reach the first set of trees, head south then east twice until you come
to a tree with a hole in its base. Look in the hole and get the sling. Go
back west twice to the fruit tree then north. Now this is a bit tricky. There
is a tree on the upper right edge of the screen that you should go to before
you go east to the next screen.  This area will give you the most amount of
time to evade the giant before he kills you!

Go east...there he is! Go as quickly as you can and hide behind the center
tree. Make sure Graham is completely hidden behind the tree. Now just wait
there. Eventually, the Giant will become tired and lie down under the tree
and go to sleep. Now's your chance...

The chest he's carrying is King Edward's Magic Chest! Get it and head west
back to the beanstalk. Make sure you walk in the right places or you'll fall
out of the clouds! It would be a good idea to save your game before you de-
scend. Go back down the beanstalk and head south three times then east to the
well.

Stand on the north side of the well and cut the rope. Cutting the rope gets
the bucket for you. Now lower the rope into the well and climb down the rope.
When you get to the end of your rope (so to speak!), dive under the water and
head southwest into the hole. Careful not to become tangled in the weeds!

When you exit the hole, you're face to face with a fire-breathing dragon!
Stay in the middle of your screen and go only as far as the second rock.
Throw water on the dragon's fire and he's vanquished! In fact, he's so emba-
rassed that he moves a boulder blocking the western exit from the cave and
skulks away! On the northern side of the cave is the King's Magic Mirror!
Take the mirror and leave the cave by going west twice. Outside the cave, you
see a large, friendly bird flying back and forth. We'll get to him later,
though, so head south twice to the stump.

Look in the stump and you see an old canvas pouch. Get the pouch and look in-
side it. When you do so, you see it's filled with sparkling diamonds! Go east
and swim east across the lake twice, then continue east to where you found
the dagger and north to the big tree. Climb the tree and go to the nest.
Craddled in the nest is a large golden egg! Get the egg and climb back down
the tree and go north twice to the tree.

Laying on the ground under the tree are walnuts. Get a walnut and open it. On
the inside you find a solid gold walnut! Go east and get the bowl you see,
then go south. Running around the banks of the lake is a friendly little elf.

Talk to the elf and he's so impressed by your manners that he gives you a ma-
gic ring! Wearing it will make you invisible...but only once! So save it un-
til you need it!

Go north, east twice and north twice to the back of the woodcutter's house.
Now go west and enter the front door. Inside you see a deplorable sight. A
starving woodcutter and his wife sit dejectedly at an empty table. Too bad
you can't help	them...say perhaps that bowl...? Look at the bowl and you see
the word "FILL" written on its bottom. Give the bowl to the woodcutter. He
looks at you wonderering why you'd give them an empty bowl. Say "FILL" and
the simple ceramic bowl fills to the brim with hot stew! For this precious
gift (an unending supply of food!), the woodcutter gives you his only other
possession, an old fiddle laying in the corner. Get the fiddle (careful you
don't fall through the floor!) and leave the cottage.

So go south from the woodcutter's house, swim across the lake in a southerly
direction, then continue south and go around to the front door of the Witch's
Cottage. (Taste her house if you must, it's quite good!) Save your game at
this point. Open the cottage door and make your way to the bedroom. Now wait.
Eventually, the witch will come home. She won't see you because you're in the
other room. Sneak up on her and push her into the stove! You done the old hag
in and can move about her house without fear now.

Go to the cabinet on the north wall, open it and take the cheese wedge. Now
go back south and leave the cottage. Now comes the fun part. Go west and go
south to the front of the cave where you found the Magic Mirror. The large
friendly bird seems to be waiting for you! Go down to the lower middle por-
tion of your screen and keep jumping up until the bird (which is actually a
Condor) catches you.

The Condor flies high up in the air and carries you to a small island which
lies in the moat in front of the castle. When he drops you, your head spins
as you try to regain your bearings. There's an odd hole in the ground here,
but  don't go down into it just yet. Head west and get the mushroom you see
growing here.  Now go back east and down into the hole. Oops, the long drop
seems to have set your head spinning again! When it stops spinning, go south
to the end of the tunnel then - cautiously - head west.

There's a hungry rat running in circles here and when you talk to it, he says
he won't let you pass until you give him a treasure. Don't get too close to
it! Throw the cheese to the rat. Being hungry, he's just as satisfied with
the cheese as he would have been with a treasure, and he scurries away into
some unseen crevice in the rocks. Go to the door,open it, and go west through
the door.

On the other side of the door is a tiny leprechaun, who, upon seeing your
clover, lets you pass unmolested. Go south and play the fiddle for the King
of the Leprechauns. They dance and dance to your music then finally they all
leave the hall. As the King of the Leprechauns leaves, he forgets to take his
Sceptre! Get the sceptre and look! Next to the Leprechaun King's throne is
King Edward's Magic Shield!

Get the shield and go west up the stairs. Continue west until you come to the
little hole in the western wall. Now, eat your mushroom and you're shrunken
down to a size small enough to allow you to enter the hole. Go west into the
hole and you find yourself in front of the big rock where you saw the strange
green glow! Eventually, you regain your former size, but wasn't it fun being
so tiny?

Go north twice then east three times to the left hand side of the castle.
Walk (carefully!) across the bridge and open the door. Enter the castle and
follow the hallway to the throne of King Edward. Bow to the King and he de-
scends his throne. You've managed to recover the Strength of Daventry and
the king places his crown upon your head! As he does so, he falls to the
ground in a seizure and dies. Heavy lies the head that wears the crown. You
ascend to the throne to govern Daventry as King Edward had...guarding the
Treasures of Power that you labored so long to recover. Thus ends the King's
Quest.

@node "Kings Quest 2"
@remark S

PART ONE
King's Quest II begins where King's Quest I left off. You've ascended to
the throne and now find yourself, King Graham, lonely and hankering after
a wife and an heir to the throne. Looking in your magic mirror (recovered
from the previous game) you find yourself looking upon the lovliest face
you've ever seen! When you ask the mirror whom she may be, it only answers
that she's been imprisoned by the evil witch, Hagatha, in an enchanted
crystal tower and it is up to you to rescue her. Thus begins your
quest...locate as much treasure as you can, and find the keys which will
unlock the doors to your future bride. A word of caution about the
"nasties" in this game (to be avoided at all costs!): They are Hagatha the
witch, an evil enchanter, a wolf in granny's clothing and a fast little
dwarf who likes to grab treasure. When you see any of these characters,
beat feet! 'Nuff said! You begin on a beach in the kingdom of Kolyma.
Begin your quest by going east twice to Grandma's House. Open the mailbox
and get the basket of goodies. Go east then north to the door in the tree.
Open the door and climb down the ladder. At the bottom of the ladder, go
east. Be prepared to leave if the dwarf's home. If he does catch you,
though, all he does (if you're not carrying any treasure) is deposit you
back outside the door in the tree. When you can do so, get the cauldron of
soup and open the chest. When you look in the chest you see a pair of
beautiful Sapphire and Diamond Earrings! Get the earrings and leave by
going west, up the ladder, then west out the door. Head back south to the
screen that's just east of Granny's and wait for (you guessed it!) Little
Red Riding Hood! She's quite distraught because she's misplaced the basket
of goodies she was going to give to her grandma. Hand her the basket and
she gives you a bouquet of pretty flowers. That done, head back west to
Grandma's House and open the door. If the wolf's in bed (instead of
granny), leave immediately! If the coast is clear, walk up to Grandma and
give her the soup. Since she's ailing, the chicken soup is a welcomed
present. She thanks you and tells you to look under her bed. When you do
you see a black cloak and a Ruby Ring, which you take into your
possession. Wear the cloak and the ring, bidbid grandma farewell Grandma
farewell and leave the house. Now head east three times and open the door
to the Monastery. Go up to the altar and pray. The monk notices your piety
and after finishing his prayers, he stands up and asks your name. Tell him
"Graham" and he gives you a Silver Cross on a chain, then goes back to his
prayers. Wear the cross and leave the Monastery. Go south and stand in
front of the rock by the tree. Look in the hole and you see a small
Sapphire and Diamond Brooch! Take the brooch then go south across the
lake, pass by the Antique Shop (it's closed anyway...right now!) and
continue south twice more to the bridge. Be careful when you enter the
Chasm area. Depending on where you are on the screen, you may find
yourself falling to a short version of the game! I suggest you stop your
character whenever you enter a new screen before venturing on. Cross the
bridge and go north to the magic door. Read the inscription and then go
south and west back across the bridge. You get one point every time you
cross the bridge, but only do it when you're instructedt o since the
bridge has a limited lifetime! Once on the firm ground again, go west and
then north to the tree with the hole in in. Look in the hole and get the
mallet then go west twice and look in the right-hand hollow log (the other
three hollow logs are empty). Tucked inside the log is an expensive
Sapphire and Diamond Necklace! Get the necklace, go north twice then west
to the tree and get the stake that's laying there. Now go west to the
beach.

PART TWO
A brief word about the beach area...I've NEVER run into any of the badguys
here. So if you meet up with Hagatha on the screens that are just east of
the beach, go west and you'll be safe. Get the shell you see here. When
you pick up the shell, you see a Sapphire and Diamond Bracelet hidden
under it! Get the bracelet, go south twice and get the trident. Enter the
water and swim north threetimes. When you get to the lagoon with three
rocks, you see a mermaid sunning herself on one of the rocks! Swim to her
and give her the bouquet of flowers. She's so enchanted with your gift
that she summons a Magic Seahorse for your transportation! Ride the
seahorse. You won't have to guide it, though, until you get to King
Neptune. When you've reached your destination, guide the seahorse up to
Neptune and give him the trident. He's so pleased to have his beloved
trident back that he gives you a bottle and opens a giant clamshell near
him. When the shell is opened, you see a golden key inside. Take the key
and guide the seahorse back toward the east. It knows the rest of the way,
and takes you back to the rock you found the mermaid on. Swim back to
shore, go north three times then east twice into the cave. If Hagatha's
there, don't worry...she's blind as a post unless you make noise! Go over
to the birdcage, remove the cloth from the bottle that Neptune gave you
and cover the cage with the cloth. Doing so will keep the nightingale
quite and keep Hagatha concerned only with her brew. Take the cage and
leave the cave. Once outside the cave, head east until you get to the
bridge over the chasm. Cross the bridge and go north to the magic door.
Remember the inscription? Well, you've made that "big splash" and can
unlock the door. As you do so, the key disappears and...another door with
another inscription appears! Read the second inscription, go south and
west back across the bridge. Now go south three times to the Antique Shop.
Open the door (shop's open for business now!) and you find a lady in a
rocking chair. Talk to the lady and she tells you she has a lamp youbuy
lam might be interested in. Buy the lamp and she says that the price may
bed ear, but she'd give anything if she had her precious bird back from
that evil old Hag. Give her the bird and she gives you the lamp in
gratitude! But since she has her pet back, she's anxious to close up shop
and escorts you out the door. Once outside the door, polish the lamp and
(yup!) a genie appears and lays a Magic Carpet at your feet! Fly the
carpet and you find yourself floating high in the air going to the
mountain top! As with the seahorse, the carpet knows the way and deposits
you gently on the mountain. Go east and you find your path blocked by a
snake coiled and ready to strike! But don't panic!

Rub the lamp and the genie appears once more and gives you a sword with a
snake engraved on the handle. Hmmm, this seems too simple. It's simple to
just kill the snake and be done with it. Rub the lamp again and this time
the genie (who's tired of your polishing by now) gives you a bridle. A
bridle? How are you supposed to vanquish the snake with a bridle? Oh
well...When the genie (and the lamp) finally disappear, put the bridle on
the snake. What's this? A beautiful white winged horse appears before you!
This is magic! Could this horse talk also? Let's findout...talk to the
horse and I'll be darned, it CAN speak! It tells you it was turned into a
snake because it refused to become the property of an evil enchanter! But
since you've shown it mercy and returned it to its true form, the horse
gives you a Magic Sugar Cube that will protect you from poisonous
brambles. After he flies away, go east twice into the cave. On one ofthe
boulders lies another Golden Key! Get the key, head west three to the
cliff edge and fly the carpet back to the Antique Shop. Go north three
times and cross the bridge. Go north to the magic door and unlock the
second door. As before, when the door opens, the key disappears and a
third door (and yet another inscription) appear! Read the third
inscription, go south, west across the bridge, then west twice and north
twice to the figure in the boat.

PART THREE
This is getting scary! This guy looks like the ferryman from the
RiverStyx! He also looks like he's been waiting for you! Or...someone who
looks like you! Because you're wearing the cloak and ring, the ferryman
allows you to enter his boat and takes you across the poison lake to the
ruins of a suspicious looking castle. This castle is surrounded by
poisonous brambles, but you have the MagicSugar Cube to protect you! Eat
the sugar and approach the castle door. When you get to the door, you find
the way blocked by two spooky looking ghosts! But upon seeing your attire
(and jewelry), they assume you're someone else and disappear leaving your
path unbarred. Open the castle door and... (gulp!) Eerie music and
flickering torchlight greet (greet?) you. You've just entered Count
Dracula's Castle so keep your silver cross,stake and mallet handy! Go west
and climb the stairs (carefully!) to the Bedroom. Go to the dresser and
open the drawer. Inside you find a candle. Take the candle and go back
downstairs. On the way down, light the candle with the torch on the wall,
continue down the stairs and go east twice into the Dining Room. On the
dining room table sits a large, juicy ham. Take the ham and go east down
the stairs. At the bottom of the stairs you see a little rat scurrying
about. He's just there for "atmosphere" (evil chuckle) and won't hurt you.
Save the game at this point. Go west into the Coffin Chamber. Now's the
tricky part. If the coffin is open, take the pillow and get the key hidden
under it. If, however, the coffin is closed, that means "the Count is in".
When you open the coffin, *immediately* kill Dracula with the mallet and
stake. After his body is turned to dust, another key will be left behind.
Take that key also. Go back upstairs to the dining room. If Dracula wasn't
in his coffin before, you'll meet him upstairs now. When he sees you,
he'll try to bite you; but because you're wearing the cross (you *are*
wearing it,aren't you?) he'll be driven off and turn into a bat. When this
happens, go back downstairs and go back to the Coffin Chamber. This time
(if it wasn't before) the lid will be closed and Dracula will be asleep in
it. In order to get maximum points, you MUST kill Dracula. By saving the
game, the chance of his being in his coffin can be changed by restoring
the game if you miss him the first time. Once you've killed Dracula and
have both keys, go north through the archway in the dining room and save
your game again. This set of stairs is the absolute nastiest stairway I've
ever encountered! The graphics get a bit sloppy here and your feet appear
to be walking on air, so it's hard to judge your footing. Climb the stairs
to the room at the top and unlock and open the chest. When you look in the
chest you see a costly Sapphire and Diamond Tiara! Get the tiara and save
your game before you navigate those stairs again! Go down the stairs, go
south, west and south to exit the castle. Once outside the castle, go back
through the brambles and get back into the boat. The ferryman will take
you back across the poison lake and deposit you onshore automatically.
Once there, go south twice then east twice. Cross the bridge (for the last
time...its lifespan has been sapped) and go north to the magic door. This
time when you unlock the magic door, you find yourself deposited in a
strange land indeed! Blue sand, rainbow-colored water and pink skymeet
your bewildered eyes! You seem to be trapped with no way across the water.
Go north and get the net. (If you're playing this in color, you may have
to bump around for the net...I had a hard time finding it.) Goback south
twice and go fishing. When you haul your net back, a large golden fish
flops out of the net and lays gasping for air on shore! Take pity on the
fish by throwing it back into the water. When you do, the fish returns to
you, thanks you for your kindness and offers to give you a ride across the
water! Ride the fish. When you reach your destination, the fish hurls you
to shore where you're momentarily dazed, but unharmed! Looking around you
see some of the strangest plantlife imaginable! No time to do abotanist's
report, though, you have a date to keep! Go north twice then east and get
the amulet. Look at the amulet and you see it has the word "HOME" engraved
on its reverse side. Go south, open the door and enter the tower. Again,
save your game because these stairs are a bit odd, too. Climb the stairs
and you find your progress blocked by a roaring lion! Give the ham to the
lion...and the poor thing, satiated, falls into a peaceful sleep. Open the
door. Your quest is at an end because here'sthe love of your life! The
Princess Valanise! She comes towards you,lovely beyond words! Kiss her and
music swells to your head as you fall even more under her spell. She then
asks your name, and after you respond, the problem of how to leave this
enchanted place becomes your utmost worry! Ah...the Amulet! Say "Home" and
you find yourself blacking out! What devilry is this? But, despair not,
for when you awaken, you find yourself in the Monastery, standing at the
altar next to the monk. In the pews sit all your past foes, pests and
friends. Then, down the aisle comes your bride! After the monk pronounces
you husband and wife, you find yourself returned to your castle in
Davantry to reign long and happily with your true love!

@node "Kings Quest 3"
@remark CHS
The wand is in the cabinet in the wizards study. The key is on the top
of the closet in the wizards bedroom. You have to be an eagle to get into
the cave. The key to the door behind the mirror is in the skeletons hand.

When casting a spell and asked to recite a verse just hit <RETURN>.

To hide your possessions from the wizard, put them under the bed.

The King's Quest series of games uses the debug command and interpreter for
the programmers (up to KQIII) KQIV doesn't have it because of the tremendous
size of the game. Have some fun and press the <ALT> key then <D> then
<RETURN> or <ENTER> (I think twice) then type in either "GET OBJECT" (and
type in a random <#>) or "TP" for transport (and a random <#>) to be
transported to different locations.

Solution:
KING'S QUEST III starts a bit different than the first two. You begin a sim-
ple slave. As always, keep the role in mind. This means you will have to
think like a slave and act accordingly. If you are to ever escape the wi-
zard's evil clutches, you will have to use stealth and guile. Keep your own
counsel, and don't get caught even thinking of escape! You begin at the entry
of Manannan's abode. The wizard appears, and remarks that you have been lax
in handling the chores. Being who you are, you immediately carry out all of
his orders. You will need to carry out whatever task it is (usually the kit-
chen), then, if it was something else, go to the kitchen, where this walk-
thru begins. One more thing: I prefer a two save approach to such games. That
is, I use one as a miscellaneous save at the bottom for most of the little
things. After a scene has been thoroughly examined, I do a "normal save,"
such as: "AFTER ALL SPELLS--0:30:27--62PTS." This way I find that I don't
have a bunch of useless saves that only add to the confusion. Good luck and
happy Questing! You get the knife, spoon, bowl, fruit, mutton, and bread,
then go south to the dining room and get the cup. Head west and you're back
at the entry. Now, up the stairs and east. "Look" and you find yourself in
your own pitiful bed chamber and recall that Manannan never comes in here.
"Drop All" and notice that it's a safe hiding place. "Get All" then out into
the hall (still in the same scene) "Look" then "Look Behind Tapestry." Hmm,
seems to be a threat! Go west and you are again at the head of the stairs.
Oh, NO! It's him again! What's this, he's leaving? Well, while the cat's
away.... Go north and you find yourself in the "Master Bedroom." Totally in-
decent in its opulence! Decadent in the extreme when compared to the meager
cot in your own room. (What if he comes back?) You stop to admire the reflec-
tion in the mirror but are only reminded of your lowly position. "Open Drawer
" and you find a small mirror (keeping it for yourself). Now what else might
be useful? "Look in Closet" and sheesh what a fancy wardrobe! Somehow you
resist the temptation to wear such finery but "Look Behind Clothes" and WOW!
A map could be very useful, if you ever get out of this place! Now "Get Map"
and "Look at Map." Seems to be a rather unhelpful piece of parchment, but who
knows? Being cautious you "Close Closet" (pun not intended) and "Look on Top
of Closet." A key? Now what could that open? This could be important so, of
course, you take it with you. Then it's over to the dresser and "Open Drawer
" to find a vial of essence. Doesn't mean much but probably worth more than
the map and it, too, winds up in your seemingly bottomless pockets. Go south
then up the stairs to the observatory. "Look Through Telescope" (So That's
his Secret!), then "Get Fly" (My you really are desperate, aren't you?), and
go all the way back downstairs, to the first floor. At the entry, go north to
the study and "Open Cabinet" and VOILA! (Worry sets in now, to get caught is
to be -- well, let's not think about it!) You gather your courage, and con-
tinue the search. Since anything could help, you "Look at Books" and "Move
Book." Now what? "Move Lever" and panic almost overcomes you! This has got
to be one of his biggest secrets! So that's why he doesn't want you in the
study alone! You tremble and shake but press on. After all, if he caught you
now, well you certainly would be on his bad side. Down those dark stairs you
go, but extreme caution is the word, as even something as silly as a cat on
the stairs could spell your doom! (This is the only place I've found where
the cat is actually dangerous.) Down and down again. Most certainly this is
the dungeon, where he tortures his victims and...no! Why, it's a laboratory!
"Look" then "Look at Book" and hope shines anew! You "Look at Shelf" and "Get
" the six ingredients. An odd combination of emotions begins to take hold of
you now as you experience a dreadful fear and hope at the same time. So close
to freedom, yet so close to the wrath of one of the most contemptible of all
creatures, a slave owner! The die is cast, there can be no turning back now.
It's all or nothing and you know it! You keep the goodies, and head back up
those stairs. (Has he returned yet?) Cautiously, you stick your head up into
the study, half expecting a most horrible confrontation. Surprised to find
you're still alive and human, you quickly close the trap door, replace the
book and return the wand to the cabinet. You go south twice, and find your-
self outside. Ah, the chickens! You "Open Gate" and "Get Chicken Feather."
Knowing that you need to know more about Llewdor before making good your es-
cape from the tyrant, you head down the mountain. (Be sure to save your game
first!) The trail down the mountain is treacherous, but make it you do. (The
bottom of the mountain is a good place for the miscellaneous save.) Once at
the bottom, head west, then west again, desert country -- what? That was
quick! Oh well, "restore game." (You did save it at the bottom of the moun-
tain, didn't you?) From the bottom of the mountain, you go west and stop long
enough to get ready to "Show Mirror to Medusa," then west again and turn
around. (Where is she?) You sense her approach and <CR> Got her!! Perseus
would be proud! But you aren't here to do battle, you are on a scouting
mission. So you decide to move on quickly. After all, stealth and guile are
important, but so is time! You head south and spot a nice cactus by the rock,
"Get Cactus" and further south (nothing here), south again and "Get Snake
Skin." Go east and there's an eagle! As the eagle flies by, he drops a tail
feather, so you "Get Feather" and go east again. The scenery here is just
lovely. So much prettier than the desert that you tend to linger. (Sierra's
famous "if it's slow, it's important".) You take in the lovely scene and no-
tice the mud along the river. "Get Mud" and continue east. (If you are really
tempted to try the cave, save game first!) From the cave you head east once
more to find a coast line. Hmm. Can't go any further this way. You go north
along the coast and "Get Water." Not much around here so, north again. Aha!
Now this is more like it! Looks like civilization, so up the ladder and west.
Decisions, decisions! Okay, you try the bar. Nothing much here, no action at
all as a matter of fact. (Unless you try to "Kiss Barmaid!") So it's off to
the store. Finding that you can't buy anything without money, you pet the
dog (he's irresistible) and leave. Outside you take the easiest route --
south. Here you find stunted trees, but on closer inspection, there's a sprig
of mistletoe. (Now where *is* that barmaid?) You "Get Mistletoe" and head
west. Why this is right out of a fairy tale! After making sure there is no
one home, you boldly break into the house. Looking around, you don't find
much, so it's upstairs for some real searching. The beds look comfortable,
but you have no time to nap. "Open drawer," and a shiny, silver thimble is
there. You "Take Thimble" and take your leave. Downstairs again, you can't
help but feel there is something missing. Must be your imagination, so out-
side and "Look at Flowers" because they are so pretty. You "Get Dew" and go
west again. Nothing here, so it's north. Here you find nuts, but none to
suit your needs. Hmm, could be some in that hole though, so you "Reach in
Hole," and nah. It couldn't happen twice in one man's lifetime. (Better save
game since this is unpredictable!) You climb the ladder only to find the o-
riginal robber's roost! But since he is asleep, you do what you must, and
steal from him. (It's only fair.) After you have the purse, you don't even
wait to get away, you count the coins, eight of them! With this much money,
you know what to do! You look at the map, point to the village and -- WHOOSH!
Back to the store. What a way to travel! You re-enter the store, "Look at
Shelf," and buy the four items that seem most important to you. These items
are salt, lard, fish oil, and an empty pouch. Suddenly you are almost over-
come with fear! The wizard! He could be home by now! You look at the map a-
gain and point at the top of the mountain, and -- WHOOSH! Nope! It didn't
work. Oh well, you sigh and start up that long, dangerous path. (Don't forget
to save your game first!) At the top of the mountain, the fear is the worst!
What if he is back? What will you do if he's waiting just inside the door?
You open the door and the coast is clear! Better get rid of all this stuff!
Upstairs, and east to your own little room. You drop all and hide it way un-
derneath the bed. Now if only he doesn't come in here! Oooopps! Better get
some of that food, he's always hungry whenever he returns. You "Get Fruit"
and start downstairs. You worry and fret; but when he does return, he doesn't
seem the least suspicious. Just hungry, the self-centered lout! Being a slave
and all does have its drawbacks. Not only do you have to fetch his meals, you
are expected to stand there and watch! The man has absolutely no class. But
you stand there in case he wants something else. Such is the lot of a simple
slave. They way he eats, it's too bad it isn't poison! After belching loudly,
he takes his leave, and not even thanks! Ah, to heck with him! You think for
a minute, he always takes a nap after he eats like that. Hmm! And then you
can get back to plotting the escape! But not before, you caution yourself,
since it is far too risky with him about, And you almost got caught coming
back up the mountain! You go back upstairs, waiting in front of his bedroom.
When he does take a nap, you'll want to know. And there he is. Don't disturb
him? You wouldn't even dream of it! Now, quickly you go to the east, to your
own room. Wait, there's the cat. You "Get Cat" and "Get Cat Hair," then into
the bedroom and "Get All." You try to calm yourself, but still you race back
to the stairs and down. You go into the study, and with trembling hands, open
the cabinet. Taking the wand, you close the cabinet and go to the bookcase.
Taking a deep breath, you open the trapdoor and carefully go down those dark
and dangerous stairs. The laboratory brings back the fear, but you calm your-
self and go to the table. The ancient book calls to you. This is where the
hope is! Slowly you "Open Book to Page II." The room begins to glow and
strange music plays. Shivers run through your body, but you are as if trans-
fixed. You read from the book (the handbook not the disk) and follow the
steps most carefully. (Except step II must be: "Put the dog fur in the bowl"
since you have both.) The last of the incantation is read, and you wave the
magic wand. Whew! Success! Since that one worked, another is called for, so
you return to the book and "Open Book to Page IV" and follow directions
exactly! Again you complete the spell and hope gives you strength. You decide
on just one more for now, where was that spell? Transforming another into a
cat! That's it! Once more you go to the book and "Open Book to Page XXV." The
odd colored lights again return, and the music starts anew. With shaking
hands and strained nerves you begin the spell. Carefully you follow directions
, but is it right? Tension builds, and builds still more. The longer you work
at it the more you shake, until at last! You wave the magic wand and Ahh....
Strained to the breaking you realize that at last you have the means to eli-
minate the evil, old Manannan forever! Then you realize that you have lost
all track of time. When will he awaken? Has he already finished his nap? No,
plenty of time. Looking at the cookie it occurs to you that it's going to be
tougher than you thought to get him to eat the disgusting cookie. Somehow it
will have to be diguised. But how? You try to "Put Cookie into Bread," but
that doesn't work. Hmm. Have to think of something. You look at the map, and
readily see that there isn't much that you have yet to see. You point to the
bottom of the mountain and WHOOSH! Yes, this is the bottom of the mountain,
so east. Ah, there's that cave again. Not much left then, so it's east once
more and -- nope. Just more coastline. Hmm, back to the west. Go north and
you are again facing the mysterious cave. Let's see, how do you pass a spider
web that size? You don't want to chance it so, "Dip Eagle Feather in Essence"
and fly into the cave. Navigation seems a bit odd as an eagle. Hard to con-
trol where you go. Hey! Spider alert! As you get close to the spider, some-
thing comes over you and it's curtains for the spider. As the spell wears off
you notice that the web has been torn to shreds. You oh-so-cautiously enter
the cave, and a presence causes you to freeze. What is this place? There in
front of your eyes appears an oracle. It seems she knows you! More than that,
she also knows who you really are. As you gaze into the vision she creates,
it is revealed to you that there is another whose fate is far worse than
yours. Not only that, but it is your duty to go to their aid! How are you
ever going to manage? They say it's always darkest before the dawn. You gird
yourself and go forth. But how can one such as yourself be of any aid to one
such as that? And in a land far, far away! The spells! You realize that your
only hope is to be rid of the tyrant wizard (which you had in mind anyway)
and finish the spells. In order to finish the spells, you still need three
dried acorns. Where might they be found? The desert is dry, but nothing grows
there except cactus. Perhaps near the desert? You head west and cross the
stream, but what's this? You overhear two birds discussing, of all things,
YOU! Further west and two squirrels seem to have the same thing on their
minds. Seems like you are the prime topic in all of Llewdor. The conversation
is only moderately interesting, but it seems to clear your senses, for in-
sight strikes. The thing that was missing! That fairy tale cottage! You hurry
off, to the north twice, then east. Yes, it is the house of the Three Bears,
and there they go now! As soon as they leave, you enter the house. There on
the table is the thing that bothered you so when last you visited, simply be-
cause it should have been there. Porridge! What an ideal way to hide the
cookie! You "Get Porridge" and exit quickly. (Those bears may no longer have
a sense of humor!) Outside the house you continue the search for the acorns.
Nothing here, so west again. Nope. Nothing but a couple of noisy squirrels.
Argh! And two nasty bandits! They assault you severely, hit you right on top
of the head, and steal everything! At least you know where the hideout is, so
north you go. And there it is! Wait a second. You pause long enough to search
those nuts just one more time. Lo, and behold! You find three dried acorns.
You "Get Acorns" and "Reach in Hole." (Save the game.) The ladder appears
again so up you go. Quietly you enter, finding the thief sound asleep. Care-
fully you approach the table and nab the purse. Now, where is the rest of it?
You spot a bin in the corner that you hadn't noticed before. You "Open Bin"
and "Look in Bin", there it all is! Quickly, you abandon the treehouse, climb
down the rope and run to the east. Even here you don't stop, you feel like
just running forever. Almost blindly you head north where the treacherous
mountain path brings you up short. You know that you can't risk hurrying up
that trail. Maybe they aren't following. You can't help yourself, you simply
HAVE to know. Carefully, you take inventory, even to counting the coins in
the purse. What's this? There's eight coins! But that's more than...oh, well
. That path, hmm. There should be an easier way. Wait! Why walk? You "Dip Ea-
gle Feather in Essence" and take to the air. Not only is this a lot safer,
it's FUN! At the top of the mountain, you say the magic words, and look for a
safe place to land. Oops, right in the middle of the chicken coop! Any lan-
ding that you walk away from is a good one! You "Open Gate" and head for the
house, "Open Door" and hurry to the study. Yup, you left the trapdoor open,
and the wand! Got to put that back, too! You're too close to freedom to let a
little mistake ruin it all. So you "Open Cabinet," "Move Lever," and "Move
Book". There that's better. Now it's back to the entry and up the stairs. You
go to your room, and "Put Cookie in Porridge" and when you "Look at Porridge"
you relax for a moment. It will work! It HAS to work! You "Drop All" and "Get
Porridge" and it's off to the dining room. Patience is an asset to a slave,
but was never one of your virtues. As a matter of fact it's all you can do to
keep from dancing from one foot to the other. But wait you must. You have
time on your hands for a short time, but it seems an eternity! You reflect on
the danger ahead and the task set before you. Desperately you try thinking of
anything but the porridge and the waking wizard! There he is now! Somehow you
calm yourself so as not to give any clue that something is amiss. Now, go to
the kitchen, must make it appear that you are preparing a normal meal. You
can't control yourself, you turn right around and return to the dining room.
You "Feed Wizard" and anxiously watch his every bite. He eats, and eats, and
"Ding-dong, the witch is dead..." or something like that! Hooray! Up the
stairs, and back to your bedroom again. (For the last time!) You "Get All"
and go back to the stairs, then down to the study. You get the wand and open
the trapdoor and cautiously go down to the laboratory. You feel a sense of
exultation, but also a sense of purpose. You are almost driven to complete
the spells, because, after all, she is your sister. Going to the table, you
open the book to the proper page, and begin to tremble anew as the lights
play tricks and the weird music starts to play. Hope carries you as you pa-
tiently carry out the instructions for the spell to teleport at random. Each
step is completed in accordance with the book, you recite the verse, and wave
the wand. Again you find success, and again you go to the book. Only three
spells left, and the powers of the wizard are yours! You open the book again,
this time to the spell marked Deep Sleep. This one seems to be a bit harder.
The trembling is more pronounced. You get the feeling that you aren't going
to make it, the words on the page begin to blur. But finally it's over and
you have still another spell to call your own. The last two are certain to be
tough! Again you open the book, now to page LXXIV. The music causes tension,
the strain is great. The spell is very exacting, but so were the others. This
spell, and the next come hard, but in the end they are yours. At last you are
, in truth, a wizard in your own right! The feeling of power is intoxicating!
POWER! What a feeling! With this much power, what could not be done? Why,
perhaps you should put the cat/wizard to sleep forever? No, have him telepor-
ting at random for the rest of eternity! Slowly, you come back to your senses
. The wizard is already suffering his fate. To do more would be to become as
he was. No, you realize that you have been called to a higher purpose. You
must save your sister and the kingdom of your parents. You wonder what they
must be like. Transportation will be a problem. To know this is to know that
the tiny village is the only hope. You look at the map and point to it.
WHOOSH! And here you are. You feel that already you have become used to such
methods of travel. It all seems so natural. Barely hesitating, you go into
the bar, find three sailors and try to strike up a conversation. Aha! That's
just exactly what you do want. Money is no object, so you "Give Gold to Cap-
tain." Why the louse! Such poor manners! Grabbed all of your gold, and left
without so much as "glad to have you." (Maybe he would like to be a cat?) No,
that's bad thinking. No time to scold yourself though, so it's off you go for
a long walk out on the pier. And this must be the ship. Yes, there's the cap-
tain now, and he seems anxious to get you aboard. That gangway looks a bit
tricky, but you are becoming used to such narrow walks. As you step aboard,
you get the feeling that something is wrong. But what could it be? Why these
men aren't sailors! They're PIRATES! Before you can even manage a simple
spell, they grab all of your possessions and throw you rudely into the hold.
What a predictament! A short time ago you felt as if you were all-powerful,
now you couldn't feel more powerless! You look around and find that there is
a ladder just above you but just out of reach. You go east and look some
more. There! That small box will surely do. You "Get Box" and go back to the
west, "Drop Box," and "Jump on Box." Yes, it will work! You "Jump on Box"
again and the "Jump" to the ladder. Cautiously, you stick your head up out of
the hold, then climb right up from there. Hmmm, this seems to be the cap-
tain's quarters. You go west and "Open Chest" then "Look in Chest." Quickly
you take your leave, lest you be caught and the possessions taken from you
again -- or worse! At the ladder you face another tough decision. Up, or fur-
ther east? Not down, you know what is down there. Wait a second, what about
the map? You "Look at Map," only to discover water all around. Well, that, at
least, figures. Hmm, how far to Daventry? How soon will you return to the
land of your birth? Time is wasting and you decide to chance a look at the
upper deck, so it's up the ladder. As long as you're climbing, might as well
go all the way, so up still higher. Nothing but the crow's nest, and it looks
like a dangerous climb. Down you go, and back to the quarterdeck. Might as
well see what's at the back of the ship. West and into the galley. DRAT! The
cook has seen you! You find yourself thrown back into the hold with a loss of
, among other things, your dignity. You ponder a moment. What should you do?
Since they seem not to have noticed how you left the hold before, why not try
it again? Up the ladder, (carefully) and peek out slowly. No one around so...
Nah, they wouldn't put your things in the same place. Nothing better to do,
so west you go and into the captain's quarter's once more. The chest is still
open, so you look in the chest, and beat it fast! Sure enough! They DID put
it all in the same chest! Not wanting to risk going up top side again, you
decide to go east. A quick look around doesn't show much, but here's a shovel
so "Get Shovel" and scoot back to the west. Kinda risky around here. What you
really need is a place to hide out and just think. Of course, the hold is the
safest place to be right now! So back down into that dark, dank hold. You
spend some time just thinking about the problem, pacing back and forth like a
caged animal. As a matter of fact you begin to feel just like those mice. Ex-
cept not quite so talkative. What are they chattering about, anyway? A trea-
sure? Five steps east of a lone palm tree? Yeah, well it won't do you any
good here! Got to think of a way out. You look at the map again, noting that
the ship is considerably closer to Daventry. You'll need a plan before long.
What about the storm spell? No, that could sink the ship and you right along
with it! Hmm. Suddenly it strikes you just as surely as a bolt from a thun-
dercloud! Of course, the sleep spell! "Land Ho!" A cry comes from high above.
Soon, very soon, but the timing will be important. You are sure that you must
wait until the anchor is dropped, but equally important is everyone must still
be aboard. Another cry from above. "Drop Anchor!" You pour the sleep powder
on the floor, and recite the verse. Quiet falls all around. even the mice are
stilled. As if the slightest sound would break the spell, you slip back up
the ladder and out on the main deck. You "Look for land" and see mountains in
the north and land to the east. Cautiously, you step off the deck and into
the water. Not the best dive you ever made, but you're in the water. East is
land so east you swim, only to find the horror of the sea bearing down on you
. You give your best impression ever of Johnny Weismuller! Whew! That was
CLOSE! The trials you've seen! At last you are free from worry. The wizard
will bother no one ever again, the pirates are caught in the sleep spell, and
you have come at last to the land of your birth. It would be so nice to just
lie here in the sun for awhile. No, that won't do. You still have a sister in
the gravest of danger; and from what the oracle said, the Kingdom itself is
in deep trouble. It's on your feet, and off to the east. Huh? It's the cap-
tain! He escaped the sleep spell! You deftly dodge him by going north. Some-
thing about that beach bothers you though. Wasn't that a lone palm tree in
the sand? You step back to the south and find that he is gone. Over to the
tree and take a close look. Yes, it is a palm tree, but can mice be believed?
Only one way to find out, so stepping slowly you count: One, two, three, four
, five, and "Dig." Eureka! Why there's a King's Ransom here! You wonder if
you should rebury it, or try to drag it along. How much farther? What the
heck, with whatyou are already packing, it hardly makes a difference. You
grab the chest and move off to the north. Yes, the trail does look tough, and
no way to get there from here. East, and the the trail begins. A step or two
north, around that sharp corner, and back again to the west. You stop at the
base of the Horse Head Rock, and scale the very face of it. No, this isn't
nearly as bad as the trail from the wizard's. East, following the trail as it
winds around to the north, then east to a lovely waterfall. Growing weary of
the climb, you decide on a shortcut. You "Dip Fly Wings in Essence" and fly
right up to the top of the waterfall. Following the trail east, you see a
cave in the distance. No, you decide to press on. No more sidetrips, no more
distractions. Further east and the trail seems to go in all directions, and a
big footed foe comes up behind you! He seems to be a bit confused, and heads
back to where he came from. The impulse to buzz around leaves you, and you
land on the path to the south. Deciding it to be as good a direction as any,
you take that path, only to find yourself scaling an almost vertical cliff!
Slowly, just as slowly as you can, you climb down. You feel carefully for
handholds and any possible loose stone or ice. Straight down, until you feel
a ledge and carefully let it take your weight. Whew, glad that's over with.
Looking around, you realize that it hasn't even begun! Staying close to the
cliff wall, you carefully move to the west. It looks spooky, but you enter
the cave. DARK! You fear that you will become lost in the maze, but you come
at last to the far side. This isn't an improvement at all. Moving out to the
end of the ledge, you begin scaling down again. No point in trying for the
closer ledge, what you want is to get to the bottom. Slowly you move down,
til at about the midpoint you fail to find a foothold. You move to the west
a bit and then down even more. At last you feel the ledge below you, only to
find that the dark caverns are to be risked again. Entering the cave again
brings you out on the west side of the cliff base. It looks like you are
trapped, but you dare to risk the long climb back up. Moving a few steps to
the east, you begin the climb. You begin to tire, and more than a little
fear arises within you. On you go until you gain the center ledge. This has
got to be the way out! You enter the cave; and at last! Finally you are back
on the path. You follow the path east, and east again. The mountain scenery
is very beautiful, and you begin to feel relaxed, almost carefree. You are
lulled into a state of recklessness! The path turns south, and you follow it
blindly, right off the mountain! Actually, it's more like a large hill for
you get more of a bruised ego than anything else. You pick yourself up and
have a look. That looks more like a tunnel than a cave, and that looks as if
it's a stairway! the hole you go, somewhat more aware now of where you place
your feet. Up the old stairway you go. A sense of ancient times pervades this
dark place. Up to a landing, and up again. Out into the daylight and warm
mists surround you. Why is it so dreadfully warm? Perhaps dabbling with the
mantic arts has given you a sixth sense, or maybe it comes naturally. You
have a feeling that danger is near, and you "Rub Ointment on Self," before
going further west. The Dragon! Your instincts have proved themselves. The
dragon doesn't see you as you "Stir Storm Brew With Finger." With great care
you utter the words that so long ago were memorized in haste. The storm
appears and rages on! The dragon is struck, and down he falls! As the storm
subsides, and the ointment wears off, the struggling girl captures your
attention. You talk to her, trying to calm her, but she only screams, "Untie
me!" You untie Rosella, explaining your relationship. The doubt shows plainly
on her face, but she agrees to follow you. Rosella follows you east and down
the stairs, and out into the daylight again. Go west, and you come to place
that looks to be under siege! The well has been filled with stones, and that
trench seems to run on forever. What purpose can that great stone wall serve?
Go north, and at least there appears to be some sort of civilization. There
is even a castle in the distance. The gnome greets you and calls you by name.
Obviously, you are home at last! The gnome seems to know the way, so you fol-
low him toward the castle. What kind of kingdom has a plank in place of a
drawbridge? That plank more than anything tells the dire circumstances of
this land. Somehow, this is not the home you had expected to return to. A
sadness comes over you as you cross that moat, and even the rich entry of the
castle does little to dispel your gloom. You turn at the end of the hall and
try to guess how the throne room and your parents might look, and sadly walk
the last short leg of your long journey. A nervousness comes over you. Can
this truly be home? Will they know me? Questions come quickly to the mind,
but there is no time for answers. As one, you and Rosella enter the throne
room of Daventry and no doubt can remain. This is HOME! It could not be
otherwise. Hugs and kisses, and more of the same! A tear comes to your eye
as the King tells of his pride in both of you. He explains of the once magic
mirror, and before your eyes it clears! The moment could not be more perfect.
You could not feel any greater joy, or so you thought. King Graham brings out
his old adventurer's cap and flings it toward you. What an honor, to wear the
cap of the King himself. You reach to catch it, but what's this? Rosella, too
, must think it an honor, for her hand goes up as well. In that moment, time
seems to stop. Revelation strikes you. There are no endings, only beginnings.
When life brings you to an apparent ending, it is just life and adventure be-
ginning anew. For whom does life begin this new adventure?

				PART ONE
START:

The game begins with an animated sequence to establish the plot. There is
nothing for you to do but sit back and watch.

LAY OF THE LAND:

The first thing to do is wander around. Make a crude but useful map of the
area most easily accessed. Tamir proper is about 5 screens high and 6
screens wide. Going North indefinitely will scroll you around in a nice
loop. This is not true of the East/West movements.

To the East is the vast ocean, to the West is a high mountain range.

Get to know where things are and who you are likely to find around the place.

Talk to the inhabitants and generally search around. Once you have done that
you can begin solving the various puzzles in the area.

PUZZLES OF MAINLAND TAMIR:

Watch for birds trying to catch WORMS. Get the WORM as you will need it
later. Swimming around in the POOL will startle CUPID and net you his BOW
AND ARROWS. You will only have two arrows, and will be put to good use
later.

Under the STONE BRIDGE you will find a GOLD BALL. Give the GOLD BALL to the
FROG in the lily pond. Actually you end up dropping it, and the frog, whom
you cannot approach, will return it. Once he does, kiss him (BLECCCCHHH!!).
This will get you a GOLD CROWN--good for turning yourself into a frog (this
will come in handy).

Visit the MANSION. In the living room you will find a secret
passageway with the obligatory winding stairway. There's no need to
climb it just yet, nor is there a need to collect the SHOVEL you find
at the bottom of the stairs. Search the shelves in the living room to
find a BOOK (The complete works of Shakespeare).

Give the BOOK to the MINSTREL. He'll accept the book, take on a new
profession and give you his LUTE. Pan will suddenly find you
interesting. Give the LUTE to PAN and he will give you the FLUTE
in exchange.

Visit the TREE HOUSE. Unlike normal tree houses that are built high in the
branches, this one is nestled in the roots. It's a terrific mess inside, so
CLEAN HOUSE. Rosella, working her domestic magic, will trigger the return
of the dwarves. They will sit down and share their dinner with Rosella.
Speaking with them is not very informative but does pass the time.

Once they leave, clean the dishes; notice that the dwarves have left a
blue POUCH on the table. The pouch is filled with diamonds. Being very
honest, Rosella will want to return the pouch to the dwarves. TAKE THE
POUCH and visit the MINE. There are two screens in the mine, so make
certain that you have moved to the lower level, all the way east into the
second screen near the diamond pail and close to the dwarf with a white
beard. GIVE POUCH TO DWARF. He tells you to keep it, and gives you a LAMP.

Visit the PIER. Walk all the way to the end, which will cause the
fisherman to stand and return to his shanty. Enter the shanty and
GIVE DIAMONDS TO FISHERMAN. He will give you a FISHING POLE in return.

Return to the end of the pier, put the worm on the pole and FISH.
This will, oddly enough, give you a DEAD FISH.

Go to the waterfall. WEAR THE CROWN, and you turn into a frog. You will
automatically swim under the waterfall, where you find a cave entrance.
There is a BOARD here which you can pick up now or later. Entering the cave
(It's very dark) will reveal a pile of bones right next to the entrance.
Get BONE. (watch out for the troll!!).

Save the rest of this cave for later.

				PART TWO

Following the path up the mountains will get you to Lolotte's. The program
runs by itself for a while, during which Lolotte will eye you with great
suspicion and have you thrown into the dungeon. Never fear: You will soon
be released and given a quest. The first quest is to get the UNICORN for
Lolotte.

Once you're back in Tamir, return to the PIER, and swim westward. watch out
for sharks and avoid the whale. It's a good idea to save your game before
crossing the ocean just in case you end up as dinner.

Swim east until you reach the island home of Genesta. You may wander about
and become familiar with the island if you like, but the only thing of
importance here is the FEATHER on the beach.

Once you have found the feather, prepare to swim eastward (save your game
again). This time you are looking for that WHALE. If you cannot find him
easily, restore your game and swim east again until you do. The whale will
swallow you, which normally would not be too good, but it does have its
compensations.

INSIDE THE WHALE:

Look around. Look at the mouth, or teeth, or something specific to get the
description that mentions the UVULA. Now take a good look at the tongue.
On the left hand side of the tongue you will find a `row' of black dots that
gradually rise toward the middle of the tongue.

Climb these carefully until Rosella stands up automatically. Continue
climbing to the right and up until Rosella is directly under the UVULA.
TICKLE UVULA with FEATHER. This will cause the whale to laugh and spit you
out. You will find yourself swimming in the ocean, with an island to the
north.

Swim to the shipwreck island. On the island there is a bow of a ship in
which Rosella may stand. Here she will be able to see (with the use of LOOK
GROUND) what you cannot see. She will pick up a GOLDEN BRIDLE (just the
thing for a unicorn). FEED or THROW the FISH to the PELICAN. The pelican
will drop a WHISTLE. BLOW the WHISTLE, and a friendly dolphin will come by
to give you a safe ride back to the Tamir mainland.

Search among the screens until you spot the unicorn. Shoot the unicorn with
one of the arrows. This will make him your friend. Put the bridle on the
unicorn and RIDE the unicorn. The program will automatically take you to
the Goon Airways Airport and return you to Lolotte. She'll send you on a
second quest: Find the goose that lays the golden eggs.

Visit your local OGRE house. If you tried to get in before, you found that
the door was always locked.---well' it isn't now! Go in, and throw the BONE
(the one you got in the cave behind the waterfall) to the vicious dog. He
will be delighted and leave you alone. Go upstairs, and get the AXE. Come
downstairs, and enter the CLOSET. Do NOT go into the kitchen unless you
wish to be dinner. LOOK THROUGH KEYHOLE. Keep doing that until you see the
ogre fall asleep. Exit the closet, get the HEN, and move quickly to the
door. EXIT as quickly as possible, and keep going until you are safely away
from the ogre.

Now that you have the AXE, go to one of the three `scary forest' screens and
chop down a tree. This will get those trees to behave properly! You may
now visit the one screen in the 5x6 screen layout of Tamir proper that you
haven't been able to see until now. Here you will find a SKULL CAVE. Enter
the cave.

Inside are three witches, each with only one eye socket. Between them they
have but one glass eye, which they pass amongst themselves. One of the
witches will move out from the wall and attempt--slowly--to catch you.
Avoid her and watch the other two carefully. Notice how they pass the eye
back and forth to one another? As soon as you think you have the movement
and timing figured out, move in and GET THE EYE. This can be tricky, so
save your game before you attempt this.

Once you have the EYE, exit the cave. Now, re-enter the cave. The witches,
who are helpless without the eye, will toss you a SCARAB.

Get the SCARAB (which protects you from the un-dead), and throw back their
eye.

INTERMISSION:

Time to do something for yourself: You remember why you're here in the first
place? You know...dying father? (meaningful pause.....) Good! Well, let's do
something about that, shall we?

Return to the waterfall, become a frog, and go behind the waterfall. Get
the board if you haven't already, and get back to that CAVE. LIGHT the
LANTERN, then save your game!! Enter the cave. There is a troll in here
who badly wants you for dinner. We are going to do our best to stop him.

Move directly across the screen. Before you move into the next screen (and
only if the troll has not appeared), save your game. Move onto the next
screen. Move almost all the way across, and then begin moving down. Still
no troll??.. Save! If you do see the troll, RESTORE and try again. Continue
moving down into the next screen. Save as often as necessary.

You will not be able to see well, even with the light of the lamp, so move
carefully, saving when needed, until you find where that CHASM is hiding.
PUT BOARD OVER CHASM! Move directly `right' over the board (you'll pick it
up automatically). Move up one screen and exit to the swamp.

Notice in the swamp that there are tufts of reeds, grass, whatever,
stretched out before you, rather like skipping stones. JUMP to move from
one to another. Do not swim, do not turn into a frog; just JUMP.

Move onto the next screen, and you will see the tree with the FRUIT you seek
for your father!! JUMP until you're on the last clump of grass before the
little isle. PUT BOARD OVER WATER. You may now cross onto the island, but
watch out for the COBRA!

PLAY FLUTE. (snakes just love flute music!) Once the snake is charmed, move
in and GET FRUIT! Having done that, return the way you came, jumping across
the swamp and through the cave. It will suddenly get very dark, because
this sequence triggers nightfall..........

				PART THREE

Oh yes, Pandora's box. Well, night is a great time to visit a haunted mansion,
so why don't you? get the SHOVEL from the secret passage off the living room.
You will now hear and/or see a number of GHOSTS, mone at a time. These ghosts'
mortal remains are buried in one or the other of the graveyards. Once you you
have identified which ghost it is (baby, miser, lord, sad woman, child etc) go
to the appropriate grave and dig. Don't worry about the zombies; you've got
the scarab, which will repel each zombie that touches you.

Digging in the right grave will reveal something that the ghost of the
moment wants. take the item and give it to the ghost. Repeat this process.
The small ghost child will lead you up a ladder into the attic. Once he
disappears (you'll have to go to the eastern graveyard screen and dig up his
toy), you will be able to OPEN and LOOK in a CHEST. There you will find
SHEET MUSIC.

Go to the secret passage off the living room and climb the stairs to the tower.
There you will find an ORGAN. Sit on the bench, and PLAY SHEET MUSIC. Having
done that, a drawer will pop open revealing a SKELETON KEY. Go to the CRYPT
and open it with the SKELETON KEY. ENTER. GET THE ROPE and it'll fall down to
form a ladder. Go down the ladder (the scarab will protect you from the
mummy), and take PANDORA'S BOX. return to Lolottes!.

Lolotte is at least satisfied that you are not Genesta's spy. She has
agreed to let you marry her son in the morning. All your items are taken
away, and you are led to Edgar's tower bedroom for the night. Edgar, who is
nicer than he looks, shortly brings you a rose. GET ROSE and LOOK ROSE. This
reveals that a key is tied to the rose which will let you leave the tower.

Carefully climbing down the tower's winding stairs, you move into the dining
room. There are two exits at the right of the screen. Take the one to the
rear into the KITCHEN. Look in the cupboards to find all your items. Now,
move back into the dining room, and take the front exit to the right.

This puts you in the throne room. Avoid stepping on the rug, and take the
exit to the right. Now you are in the east tower. climb the stairs.
Ignore the exit to the left halfway up, and continue to the top of the
tower. Here you find Lolotte's bedroom. Unlock the door and go in. Move
close to Lolotte and SHOOT Lolotte, thus using cupid's last remaining arrow
to a useful end. Lolotte dies a spectacular death (worth replaying at least
once). GET TALISMAN. Climb down the stairs to the first exit on the left.
When the screen changes, you will see a hall and a door. Open the door and
enter the storage closet. GET HEN, and GET PANDORA'S BOX, then exit.

Climb down the remaining stairs and leave the castle. Enter the stables and
OPEN GATE to free the UNICORN. Once you are outside the castle again, move
down the path to return to Tamir proper.

Return to the CRYPT and drop PANDORA'S BOX. Exit the crypt, close and LOCK
DOOR. Move back to the pier, and swim west to Genesta's Island. Enter her
ivory tower and climb the stairs to her bedroom. GIVE TALISMAN TO GENESTA.
The program will take over from here, finishing off the story nicely while

If you're doing badly and your plane is heavily shot, land in a field and
keep the engines running. Drive to a friendly airbase avoiding any

fly in front of you so you can zap them.

After take-off, hit <A> to accelerate time. You will now be immune to enemy

Fights - Proficent swordplay is essential if your to get anywhere in
the game. The neck chop is one of the more effective blows, but the
program blocks repetition of single moves. To get around this,
occassionaly switch to a differnt move in order to enable the neck chop
once again. Give generously to the poor and youll be a step closer to
obtaining the Sword of the Spheres.

The Palace - To enter the palace, youll need to get the invitation
from the elusive Gloop, found in Novala. Once you have it, keep out of
fights or you could lose it for good. When you get into the palace,
ask Nedrod three questions and he will give you the talisman, which
can help you find another useful item. Answer the Princess's question
with "Its a secret". She will give you the Ring of Belz, which will
only work in conjunction with the spell scroll.

In General - Objects are not always found in the same places from game
to game, so a detailed search of both fore and backgrounds is often in
order. To survive the final confrontation, a high psychic rating is
needed, which can be increased by donating skringles to the poor. Dis-
orderly conduct can have the opposite effect. The safest technique in
the space battles, is to slow right down as soon as you see the aliens
shoot them all, then power at full steam until the next lot. Follow
Readheads ship if you see it. Heatpro tablets are necessary if you
beam down to one of the hotter planets. Makes notes of what you are
told, and use any new names or subjects to weavel out every last bit
of information from the characters.

How to complete the five ordeals:

* The Twins - Object = Goblet

Go to the source on the left hand side. Inspect the fountain and press
the eye. Fill the Goblet and go back to the room called 'The Twins'.
Open the left-hand serpent and empty the goblet into it. Get the die
that emerges from the serpent then open the right hand serpent. Throw
the die, and note the number thrown. Put the die into the right-hand
serpent and go to the room facing you. The hands are in a dice formation
(except for the middle one). Pull up the hands until they resemble the
formation you threw earlier, then push the serpent's head on the wall.
The sliding partition should open; note down the shape which it covered.
Go back to the fountain room and inspect each cube (each is patterned).
Lift the cube which resembles the one you found behind the sliding
partition.

* In the Scorpion's Presence - Object = Fly

Pray to the statue then enter the room called 'The Web'. Look at the
web on the floor and crawl on it. Give the mistress the fly; show
affection but don't be too saucy with her. Feed the fly to the blue
spider and get the red one. Leave the room, and then put the red spider
into the statue's mouth. Don't listen to the man who pops out, just pass
through trapdoor.

* The Wall - Object = Dagger  (can use psi-shift!)

First choose the third zone, then the second zone; this means that you
can unlock the sliding wall when you open either door. Go through either
door, left or right, and inspect the step. Then take a look at the slot
on the Sculpted Warrior and climb onto the step. Either put your dagger
into the slot, or if you haven't got one, use Psi-Shift. You will be
spun around by the wall. There are now TWO seperate gaps in the wall,
one which goes straight on, and the other is a dark, black strip; it
depends on which door you have taken. Move the cursor to go down the
black passage, not straight on. Stick your hand in the gap on the floor.
Return the way you came, and this time go straight on.

* De Profundis - Object = Rope

First of all, wait. Then lasso your rope onto the hook on the ceiling.
When the Granite Monster lurks towards you, jump onto him. Wait a few
minutes.

* The Noose - Object = None

Do not do as the Poormouth says. Use either the lantern, or your Solar
Eyes Power. Grab hold of left hand rope and climb up. Push the lever,
remove the noose-rope and he will fall. Take the left-hand piece of
rope. Inspect the hollow on the platform. Finally, leave and go to the
Master's Orbit.

* What to do after you have got the five Skulls

Give all five skulls to the Protozorg underneath the trader. He will
announce that you are a divot. Go to the concourse outside the ring,
and remember, if you are asked any questions, show the egg you were
given. Once you are in the concourse, ignore the guard and use all the
violence you can muster on the upper right-hand guard; then enter the
upper right-hand passage.

Go left. Inspect the toad's head and poke it's eye. Use the Lantern
(if you have it) or the Solar Eyes to see. Inspect the lever and the
trapdoor. Use Psi-Shift on the lever and pass through the trapdoor.
Next keep going straight through until you meet Norma Jean and Ash. You
MUST do as Norma Jean says. Don't move!  Tell her the truth...talk to
both of them and then use your Zone Scan. Lift your block on the floor
and get both objects, the beam and the flask. Unwrap the bandages from
the mummy, go to the left and keep going forward.

By going through the trapdoor you will enter the Threshold of Truth.
Kill the priestess and put the egg in the opened mouth. Next off, take
a look at the Lantern. Read the book, then use your Psi-Shift on the
statuette to retrieve it on the left-hand side, near the ceiling.

Leave and go to the refectory, then go to Saura's Repose. Put the
statuette you found into the niche then go to the Presence of God, and
then to Placating the Powers. Kill the first priestess, then make use
of Psi-Shift on Saura's Mark, aiming it at her dagger. Use Brain Warp
on the character, Sci-Fi, then giver her the flask to drink. Go to
Saura's Repose, putting the monkey into the small tunnel. Enter the
Presence of God and wait. Go into the passage. Wait. Use aggro on the
god, Zorg, and then use Brain Warp on Pratozim, who is holding Sci-Fi
hostage. Use Psi-Shift on trap door, and finally, throw the knife or
dagger at Pratozim.

Hints:
* Don't waste your Psi-Powers, they are needed much later on in the game.
  If you run out of it early you can't complete the game.
* Don't fight the guards in the Monster's Orbit. You will be instantly
  killed.
* If you go onto the concourse before you become a divo, you won't be able
  to complete the game.

BEGINNING

The game begins in the subway car and all you have in your inventory is
a single quarter. Don't use this coin in anything other that the pay
phone at the end of the hall in the 50's Diner on the upper level. Got
that? Good. When wandering around the various levels and areas of this
game, click the eye icon on the various walls and lights etc., there are
some very nice pics in this game.

You'll begin the game in a subway car on the middle level. You can exit
the middle level in one of three ways; by using the elevator in the
hotel, by falling through the city street when you cross against the red
light which is through the south exit door in the subway, or by the stairs
which you will come to after making your way through the MEDIEVAL MAZE. As
the exit door to the south of the subway car is secured all you can do is
bravely exit the subway car by the west exit and walk into the hotel. When
you first enter the hotel there will be two doors, one you can open and one
is locked. Go into the one you can open and have a look around. Nothing
of importance happens here, but it is worth checking out. You will go back
to the locked one later, when you find the key. The only other room of
interest is Number 14, the other rooms you can't enter anyway as they have
do not dirturb signs on them. This is the room with the wardrobe in it
(which is locked) and the key to it is located in the western town on the
upper level. There is one other door you can enter on this level, which is
the door to the mirror maze which is located across from the elevator which
is in the south hallway of the hotel. For now we will go to the western
town and get the key for the wardrobe. To get to the western town, go up
in the elevator. The door you see straight ahead of you goes to the
theatre, go through there for now and walk through the balcony section and
out the other exit this will take you to a wall. Notice the slider puzzle
on the wall, the correct alignment for the slider pieces is located in the
construction site at the end of the hedge maze on the upper level. When
you eventually find this area you will line up the pieces in the right
sequence and the wall will open. Now go back to the lobby by the elevator,
the door to the detectives office is locked you will get this key later.
Now turn right. you will be facing south at this point, walk through the
doorway and down the hallway. As you exit the hallway, notice the temple
floating in the air, this is your ultimate objective. At this point turn
right and head,across the crystal cliffs, through the cave entrance and
down the tunnel. At the end of the tunnel turn left and go through the
multi-colored doorway into the railway car. Have a look around the railway
car and the town. The locked door at the west end of the railway car is
never opened, I never found a key for it. The door at the east end of the
railway car gives you another view of your objective. The only places of
importance are the newspaper office, the sheriff's office and the mine
tunnel. Nip into the sheriff's office and open the drawer on the desk,
look in the drawer and take the brass key inside. Oh, and while you're
here, pop into the saloon and grap the bottle of whiskey, you can take a
drink from it periodically if you wish. Now head back to room 14 in the
hotel when you are finished exploring. Open the wardrobe, look inside and
take the journal and the card. The journal has an interesting story in it
and will later reveal a clue when you have accomplished a couple of tasks,
more on that later. The card is used to turn on the various teleporters in
the game. For now we will head for a teleporter which is located at the
end of the mirror maze.


MIRROR MAZE

Go to the doorway across from the elevator and walk inside, now go
through the insanely laughing clowns mouth and follow the map below.
When you get to Morgan in the centre of the maze, do not use your
quarter in him unless you save your game first. If you put your quarter
in before saving your game, he will tell you, "You will wish you had
that coin back" and then you will have to start over as you can not
finish the game without that quarter. So save your game first and then
plunk in your quarter and watch the animation.

 [R]--[R]--[R]	[R]--[R]--[R]	R  = Room

  |    |    |		   |
 [R]--[R]--[R]	[R]--[R]--[R]
		 |
	       [CR]

Once you make it through the maze you can use the cardkey in the
teleporter slot, After using the cardkey you must press one of the
buttons to teleport. The green button will teleport you to the library,
the blue button to the museum.

MUSEUM

Pressing the blue button takes you to the museum where you should pick up
the alien belt (I never found a use for this, outside of the fact it
flashes). There are also three levers here, pulling the levers will place
or remove bridge sections, they are also used in conjunction with some
other levers later in the game.

Pulling the left lever will remove a bridge section from the mine and the
one under the subway causing the subway car to be crushed but don't despair
as it can be 'pumped up' with the bicycle pump which is found in a toolbox
at the construction site on the upper level after you solve the slider
puzzle. You have to crush the subway anyway to get an item you need.
After the car has been crushed and you pump it up, check out the legs
sticking out from under the subway car, it ain't Kansas anymore. Also as I
mention later in the solve, I have played two complete games and one time
the subway was crushed and one time it was not. I'm assuming that pushing
the left lever back up causes the subway car to be crushed as you replace
the bridge section when you do this and it is sitting on top of the subway
car. When you leave here make sure all levers are down.

Next press the green button to teleport to the library, the orange button
takes you back to the control room. The cave and the mountain road can be
reached by teleporting from the southern-most room of the library. The
first time you exit the cave and walk across the road, you will narrowly
dodge the falling rocks and they won't injure you. However, to cross back
you must be wearing the hekmet which is found in the south-east corner of
the medieval maze. You will not be able to pass the rocks if you aren't
wearing the helmet. Safety first.

CRETAN PALACE

After crossing the mountain road and dodging the falling rocks you will be
facing east in a Cretan hall. Walk down the hallway and go through the
doorway. You will be in another Cretan hall, there are two exits from this
hall. If you turn left you will end up on a bridge platform, this is were
you will cause pieces of a bridge to appear to get to the doorway in the
temple. For now turn right and go through the doorway, you will be in the
Cretan Palace, have a quick wander round and take the Labrys which you can
find in the central room inside the large circular well. Also note the
design on the door in the palace, you need to place an artifact there from
King Minos tomb. Below is map of palace.

Now on to the medieval maze.

MEDIEVAL MAZE

The maze is located on the middle level to the east of the cave and the
Cretan palace. To navigate through the maze to get the helmet and exit
maze follow map below.

After getting the helmet make your way to the upper level and the 50's
diner through the northwest exit from the maze.

50's DINER

Upon exiting the Medieval Maze you will be in a wierd cave, go through
the doorway in front of you. After climbing the stairs, the first
object you'll find is a can of paint. This is very important so be sure
to take it. Now turn to your right and enter the diner. Have a look
around check things out but do not use your quarter in the jukebox.
After checking out the diner exit it were the sign is for the telephone
and head down the hall to the pay phone (another view of the Temple),
drop your quarter in the slot on top of the phone. After inserting the
coin in the slot, thirteen coins will fall onto the stool underneath the
pay phone. Pick up the quarters. Use a coin on the jukebox, and get the
silver key from the coin return. After retrieving the silver key, go
back to the pay phone and put a quarter in the coin slot for the pay
toilet. Now enter the hedge maze.

After dashing through this maze you'll enter a construction site. Take
the screwdriver lying on the workhorse and jote down the numbers on the
west wall. These numbers are the solution to the theatre slider puzzle.

You also have the silver key, it's now time for a long walk back to the
detective's office on the middle floor. On the way through the Mirror maze
you can plunk some quarters into Morgan and he will give you some advice in
the form of riddles. See below.

- Whatever will be will be, Doris Day
- It's all done with mirrors.
- If one could speak to the past, how would it answer.
- Some doors were never meant to be opened.
- Sometimes a closed door is greater than an open one.
- You will meet a tall dark stranger.
- The future is what the past has made it.
- If you cannot reach your goal, you must learn to build bridges.
- A blank piece of paper, is full of potential.
- Beep Beep - Harpo Marx
- Great power hides behind the thrones of Kings.
- Morgan the Magician says you should figure it out yourself.

Use the silver key to open the detectives door and take the iron key which
will open the jail cell in the sheriff's office. I never found a use for
the Falcon statue or the notes.

Just hang onto the key for the jail cell right now as you do not really
need it until later on near the end of the game, but if you want you can
check out the jail cell and get the gun under the blanket. The gun is never
used in the game. You can also do this later near the end of the game.

So where to next? Go to the slider puzzle on the wall outside the theatre,
and line up the slider puzzle like it was on the wall in the construction
site. Ah, forgot to write it down did you, here it is. :)

7  2  9  10
1  11 5  13
8  15 14 12
3  4  6

Once you solve the puzzle the wall will open reveailing another entrance to
the construction site. Look inside the toolbox to get the gold key and the
bicycle pump. Never got the spigot to turn in the keg.

Once you have the golden key you can open the locked door in the hotel
across from the washroom. Note the door in the rock wall with the
combination lock. In the servant's room note the message on the wall.
There is a blank sheet of paper in the closet which you must use with the
printing press in the western town on the upper level. I never found a use
for the broom, bucket or teapot. Once you have printed the newspaper,
return it to the servant's room and place it underneath the sign on the
wall. Also while you are in the Western Town, go into the mine and push
the mine cart down the tracks, it will crash through the door as the bridge
section has been removed by pulling the left lever down in the Museum.
While there get the lantern behind the door and you can get the sword in
the stone if you want and become the King of England. I never found a use
for it.

SURREAL MAZE

Next you're going to need the shirt so return to the subway car and pump it
up with the bicycle pump. Hm, I re-played this game as I wrote the solve to
make sure it was correct and the subway car was not crushed. There was
still some legs sticking out from under the subway car, but this time there
was a different message when you looked at the legs. With the subway car
crushed and pumped back up the message said "You don't seem to be in Kansas
anymore". This time the message was "You wonder if Minos will get your little
dog to". The only thing I can remember doing different in the museum was to
leave all three levers pulled down. My original game I did not leave all
three levers down, also if you pull the left lever down and then push it
back up you will see the bridge section lying on the crushed subway. Though
this could be what crushes the subway, by pushing the lever back up the
bridge section does in the subway Hm. Once the subway car is restored go
south to the locked door. The door can be opened by unscrewing the screw in the
latch with the screwdriver and then taking out the screw. Once you remove the
screw you can open the door and enter the city streets. If you still have a
quarter left you can buy a newspaper, but I never found a use for it. Nor
did I ever find any keys for the doors on the street. Actually all you can
do is walk down the street and attempt to cross the intersection. Whereupon
you fall down to the bottom of a well. Now walk ahead and you will be in
the main room in the Surreal maze. You will be facing the chair and the TV.
Follow the directions below exactly and you will make it to the Ziggurat.

Okay go S,S,S,S,S,W,W,W,S.

On the third south you will be in the main room again, but that is okay,
after all it is a surreal maze, on the fifth south you should be in the
room with the red brick wall and pulsating black doorway. Also the frame
around the doorway should be wood curved at the top. When you turn to the
west you should be facing the stone doorway with the curved top. After
three wests you should be back in the red brick room facing the stone
doorway. Now if you did it correctly turn and enter the Ziggurat. If it
didn't work try it again. This is the most reliable way I found to find
the Ziggurat. Now head west and go up the stairs and push the column you
find there. If you are playing on an IBM through the shell it may freeze up
on you here, so save before you try this. A lady I know with an IBM had
this happen to her and to get past this point she had to play this part by
starting the game from Windows. After the column is moved it will open the
two doors halfway down the stars. Go down the stairs and enter the
lefthand door. Hm, kind of dark aye, time to turn on that lantern, and
follow map below. For now do not move the red switch as you will be
teleported after moving any switches in the Ziggurat and you might as well
have the shirt with you. The three switches you find here operate
different parts of the bridge in conjunction with the ones in the museum.
So go to the yellow lever pick up the dirty shirt and push the lever. Also
on the map were it shows there is an entrance to another room, I never got
in there. If you left any of the two right levers in the museum up, not
sure which one there will be a bridge section leaning against the wall.

 [Y]-[M]-[P]-[M]

You will now find yourself on the bridge platform with one section of the
bridge in place, the dirty shirt must be taken to the laundry chute on the
upper level in the hotel and dropped inside. The shirt will appear, clean
and pressed, later in the servant's room under the sign.

Now what do I do about the combination lock - how do I open it? Well, the
combination to the lock can be found in the journal which you found in the
wardrobe in the hotel on the middle level. However, the combination will
only appear after you have cleaned the shirt and put the newspaper you
printed under the note in the servant's room. The locked door will allow
access to King Minos tomb. Now at this point when I read the journal it
turns out the number was wrong. The combination is the date for the last
entry. In my game the date was 4/8/12, which is obviously wrong as the
year does not follow the rest of the journal. The correct combination is
4/8/72, don't forget zeros in front of the 4 and 8. Open the door and
enter King Minos tomb and wander down to the sarcophagus and open it and
pick up the Cretan ornament. There is also a pith helmet that you can pick
up but I never found any use for it. Hm, I wonder were this ornament goes,
look familiar, no? You place the ornament in the door in the Cretan
palace, once opened move the throne and take the other can of paint.

Now you will have to return to the Ziggurat and pull the purple lever to
place another section of bridge, after pushing the lever you will be back
on the bridge platform with two sections of the bridge in place, with one
more to go. Now once again make your way to the Ziggurat and pull the
final red lever. Hurray you are once again on the bridge platform with
your bridge completed.

Now head to the museum and look inside the broken display case. There will
be something there. It appears only after the bridge is finished. Take the
Mayan Talisman and head for the bridge. Oops, ended up in jail for theft
did we, never fear you have a key. If you haven't been here before check
out gun under the blanket. Now release yourself from jail and head for the
bridge yet again. Once there cross over and enter the maze centre. You will
be facing the minotaur. Notice the light shining on him, well do something
about it. Get rid of the light, how you say, well paint over the mirrors.
Now place the Labrys in the indentation were the minotaurs head was and
then use mayan talisman on the pyramid keystone. It will be blasted to
pieces, now sit right back and I I'll tell you a tale, oops wrong era.
Enjoy the ending animation. To the best of my knowledge Labyrinth II never
came out.

have infinite lives.

To kill the Dragon throw a smoke bomb under him.

Solution:
THE PARK
From the opening screen go through the curtain and avoid the bloke in
the next room so that you can punch the box on the right hand wall. Go
back outside and a trap door will have opened. Drop through it and take
the key that is in the bottom left hand corner of the screen. Exit this
room and head for the screens that have public loos in them. Within each
of the ladies loos you will find the two pieces neccesary to make the
Nunchakka. Once you have collected both parts, you will have your first
weapon. Make your way to the food stand and take the burger you find
there for an extra life. Continuing, take the map which is near the gate,
and then collect the shurikens which are hidden in a bin in the screen
just before you meet the deadly juggler. Once you've got them somersault
past the juggler and collect the map that you find in the next screen.
Climb up the gate and somersault into the next screen to find the staff.
Climb down, and head for the gate which is opened using the key.
Somersault onto the boat as it floats past, and then jump straight off
onto the other side. Head for the small island where the boat will have
got stuck and prod it with the staff. Return to the bee screen and then
to the other screen. Jump on the boat and onto the other side.

THE SEWERS
Walk through the first three rooms and then go right and collect the
key. Go back to the last room and jump over the gap. Walk forward until
falls and then follow it. Use the key you found on the grate and then
drop down into the hole. When you come to the three doors, go through
the one that is furthest away. Jump over the scurring rats and keep
going until you come up against more doors. This time, go through the
nearest one. Hold the drunks bottle and walk into the torch until the
bottle glows red. When the alligator attacks, throw the bottle at it and
exit through the door that it was guarding.

THE STREETS
Enter the workmans hut and pick up the manhole key. On the screen with
the flashing door, take the sword that is located on the wall after
kicking the door down. Find the drunk and nick his bottle, then take the
hotdog from the stand for another life. Use the key on the manhole and
drop down the opened hole.

THE OFFICE
Go through the blue door and touch the computer. Make a note of the
number it gives you and then go out, following the path until you come
across two doors. Go to the top one and use the pick up control to
operate the button. Climb the ladder to the next screen and go to the
room with the fan. Pick up the grate and exit onto the ledge. Now
carefully make your way along the ledge and climb up the ladder. As the
helecopter pulls away, somersault otno landing skids.

THE BASEMENT
Go through the pile of boxes, climb the ladder and then go left. Pick
up the credit card and go through the door at the end. Take the chicken,
go back and use the ladder to go down. Go right to find some rail cars,
but be sure to somersault over the dangerous lines and repeat the
process with the next set of lines. Grab the hamburger and head for the
stacked crates. Somersault over them (you may have to zig-zag over them)
and head for the room full of bottles and go down. Hold the chicken to
fend off the panther and use the credit card on the box to enter the
lift.

THE HOUSE
Pull down on the joystick when going past the turret. Go from the turret
on the left and walk to the window along the grey strip. Somersault
through the window and walk down the corridor to the big door. Take the
rope and go down. Turn off the alarm and go through the entrance behind
the plant. Punch the wall switches and make your way through the maze
towards the steam engine. Touch the right hand switch to re-direct the
steam jet and go through the door.

THE FINAL BATTLE
Head for the pentacle and go to the tapestry to reveal a safe. Using the
number you got off the computer, unlock the safe. Take the orb and, as you
do this, Kunitoki will appear. Kill him so that he falls inside the points
of the pentacle and before he gets up, light each of the candles. He will
now be powerless, allowing you to put the orb back in the safe and
complete the game.

To kill the Dragon throw a smoke bomb under him.

If you want to have a better bushido, attack the enemies with the same
weapons they use or without weapon.

Level 1:
The first thing to do is to collect all things in level 1. If you have
everything, build a climbing-glove out of the claws and the glove you
found. Now climb up the rockface and off we go. Take the lamp and go back
to the rockface. There you fill up the lamp with the stuff inside the
barrels. Back up. When you arrive at the rock, you use your selfmade bomb
to drop it. Get downside into this room again and (walk near the wall) take
the script. With this you can leave level 1.

Level 2:
Get the bellows. You also find a boat (?) and give this a touch. It leaves
the screen and appaers in the next room again. If you enter this room,
push your stick up in the corner. At the end of the path press <FIRE> and
when you landed on the boat, at once again. In the following maze you
find your scroll. After the maze climb down the flower (attention). Go to
the next screen.

Level 3:
Get the scroll and -on the bridge- the locker for the water-flew-out. This
works as follow: Stand in front of the right corner of the fence. Now push
your stick down-left and jump in the right moment. Now walk to the next
screen and take the thing. Stop the water.

Level 4:
Walk on. Climb up the 2nd holds and find up there a mouth-safe. Now you
can get into the gas-room and take the powder. Get the keystones and the
scroll. When you arrive at the fire, use the bellows and and after that,
throw in the keystone. The result is a key. With this key you can unlock
the door.

Level 5: Try to manage having the full bushido arriving here.
You find the scroll on your way. If you are standing in front of kunotoki,
use the scroll. He begins to throw. Reflect his throws pressing button
and left-up. If this isn't enough, throw your weapons.

Part 1

You find yourself in Upper Sandusky, Ohio, in Joe's Bar. You've quaffed a
fair amount of no-name beer and you feel an urge. You trace the urge to the
region of your bladder.

You are told that the ladies' facility is northeast and the gents' is
northwest. Okay, go in the direction of whichever one you normally use.

In any case, you will find either bathroom to be filthy and fly-specked.
Moreover, each contains a stool. Get the stool if you think it will come in
handy (and no cracks about which stool, either! It's the three-legged one).
Under certain circumstances, the stool may prove useful, but it isn't vital.

Also, while you're in there, you might want to follow instructions and use
the Scratch 'n' Sniff card which comes with the game. (Honest, the scents on
the card really do smell pretty close to what they're supposed to. Well, some
of them do, anyway.) On the other hand, if card-sniffing isn't your bag, simply
type, "Smell the odor," hit RETURN and each time you'll be told what you're
supposed to be smelling. In the case of the bathroom, it's an old pizza slice,
dubiously discarded in the corner. Finally, before leaving the bathroom, use
it. I mean the bathroom, silly, not the pizza slice! And no prurient entries,
please. Just type, "Use the bathroom." After you have done so, exit back into
the bar and order a drink.

Usually, the bartender will tell you you've had enough. If he does,try
ordering again. You won't get another one, of course, but Infocom has to have a
little delay in the game before you get zapped by tentacled aliens (?) from
your cosy bar into a cell. That's right, a cell. You are suddenly, and with no
logic whatsoever, a prisoner of the dreaded LEATHER GODDESSES OF PHOBOS, whose
dastardly plan it is to invade and take over Earth for their own sinister
purposes. This bodes ill, I fear for God, country, the old ball game, mum's
apple pie, and all those other values we hold so dear.

Oh, at this point I should interject that you start LGOP in what is called
"Suggestive Mode." In movie lingo, this roughly corresponds to "PG." At any
point in the game, including the beginning, you can change modes by typing in
either "Tame" (ho hum), which gets a "G," or "Lewd," which is "R." This, of
course, permits you to play the game all the way through in any of three modes,
not to mention as a male and/or a female. If this is confusing, well, don't
fret on it. One other thing, you have to be eighteen or over to play in "Lewd"
mode. No cheating! (Remember those tentacled aliens?)

Okay, you're in your cell and you find some things to take: a flashlight, a
painting of a pussy cat and a blanket. Take all. Also, someone thrusts a tray
containing a hunk of brown food into your cell. Get the food (it's chocolate
candy) but forget the tray.

Evidently, one of those aliens was asleep at the tentacle because he/she/it
forgot to lock your cell door. Open the door and go south.

Across the hallway, you find another cell door. You also see a sign at the
head of some stairs which go up and down. The sign says, "Observation Room."
Don't go up yet. Instead, open the other cell door. (Some jail!) Inside the
other cell you find (a) a man named Trent, if you're playing the game as a
male; (b) a girl named Tiffany, if you're playing as a female. Trent or Tiffany
will be your faithful, albeit not too bright, companion from now on.

On the floor of this cell you spy a crumpled piece of paper. Get it and read
it. It turns out there's a seemingly meaningless matrix of letters on the
paper. The operative word here, folks, is MATRIX. If you scan the letters very
carefully you will make out words, for the matrix is one of those
"scramble-grams." Some of the words run backward from left-to-right, others are
forward, right-to-left. Some run vertically, others diagonally and several
intersect. In any case, encircle the words as you find them. You should wind up
with eight circled items: blender, rubber hose, phonebook, angle, cotton balls,
photo, mouse and headlight.

For the present, you are not told the significance of these objects.
Eventually (rather soon, as a matter of fact), you will learn what they're for.
However, as with many Infocom puzzles, all is not as obvious as it seems with
this matrix. If you are paying very, very close attention, you will discover
that its real significance is with the letters you DON'T circle. If you put
these together, you will read the phrase, "Hissing frightens flytraps." You are
encouraged to stash this information in your memory banks. It comes in handy
later on.

Okay, leave the cell and go upstairs to the Observatory Room. (Note: there's
a basement downstairs, and one flight up from the Observatory is the Roof of
the Observatory. The basement isn't important; the roof is.) Once you're
upstairs, go north into the tiny closet where it's too dark to see anything.
Turn on your flashlight. Now you can see, and you notice a black circle on the
floor and a wicker basket up on a shelf; but the basket is too high to reach.

Here, you can either drop your stool (if you took it) and stand on it, or you
can stand on the shoulders of your newly acquired companion. Either way, take
the basket. It's a good idea to put your possessions into the basket, too,
since this will permit you to carry more stuff, at least until you find a
roomier receptacle. No? You don't want to do that? Well, at least put the
blanket in the basket. You'll be sorry if you don't put your other stuff in,
too. When you get the dropsies, don't come crawling to me for sympathy.
Finally, stand on the circle.

Part 2

Whoosh! You're zapped away to the Jungle. Slithering up to you through the
excessive heat and humidity is a gigantic Venus Flytrap. It looks (and is)
hungry!

I've got some explaining to do so I'll pause here. First, I should tell you
that the sequence of events in LGOP does not necessarily have to follow my
walkthru scenario. For instance, if you had gone upstairs one more flight to
the Roof of the Observatory, you would have seen another black circle. If you
had stood on this one instead of the circle in the closet, you would have been
teleported to the Martian Desert instead of the Jungle.

The sequence isn't especially important. What matters is that there are black
circles (teleporters) located at key locations throughout the game. You should
make a note of where each circle is situated and where each one takes you.
Otherwise, you will quickly get lost and doubtless die and be forgotten, never
to taste mum's apple pie again. One other thing: whenever you stand on a black
circle, your faithful companion will emerge right behind you when you reach
your destination. Well, most of the time he/she will.

Back to the action. There's this flytrap, see? Well, we know what to do,
don't we? Hiss at the flytrap. (Oh, and it might be a good idea to turn off
your flashlight, too!)

Your hissing promptly causes the flytrap to cooperatively expire. (He
mistakes the hiss for a spray can of weed killer.) With the flytrap out of the
way, you can now proceed west to the Spawning Ground for Venusian slime beasts.
Only one spot is free of slime and it contains a black circle. Next to the
circle is a jar of ointment. Get the jar, but do not stand on the circle.
Examine the jar. It turns out to contain untangling cream, whatever that is.

At this point, Trent/Tiffany will toss you a matchbook. You notice it is
empty, but there are notations scrawled all over the cover. Your companion
tells you this is a list of things he needs to whip up a Super-Duper
Anti-LEATHER GODDESSES OF PHOBOS Attack Machine! As it turns out, the list is a
duplication of the objects you so laboriously decoded from that meaningless
matrix you found back in your cell. Anyway, now you know what you must obtain
in order to win the game. You also note that, so far, you're batting zero. On
with the quest!

Having read the matchbook cover, go east from the Spawning Ground back into
the Jungle. Go east again. At this point, a mighty tree rises before you!
Suddenly, the tree dies and is consumed by Venusian hypertermites, leaving a
gigantic hole in the ground.

What to do about the hole? Well, you can go down into it if you wish. But
that's pretty boring. Besides, you won't be able to get out again unless you
have your stool. (That's really the only use I found for the thing, by the
way.) On the other hand, Infocom doesn't just allow things like unexplained
tree-dyings to occur, do they? I never tried this, but I gather the purpose of
the hole is to permit another solution to the flytrap puzzle. I suspect this is
included in case you didn't/couldn't decipher the meaningless matrix of
letters. (Those Infocom guys know that not everyone is as smart as they are!)

Anyway, one of the places you will teleport to at some point in the game is
Cleveland. There, you will find a trellis and a sack. If you are following a
sequence of events which gets you to Cleveland before you get to the Jungle and
the Venus Flytrap, here's what you can do. Presumably, you will be astute
enough to take the sack and the trellis when you find them. The sack is full of
leaves (69,105 to be exact). Now, when you get to the Jungle put the trellis
over the hole left by the tree, and dump the leaves on the trellis. The flytrap
will sidle up to you across the trellis and fall into the hole. End of problem.

Since you have just hissed the flytrap into oblivion, you may completely
disregard the foregoing, ignore the hole and proceed east yet again. This takes
you to a Clearing. In the Clearing is a can of black stain. Get the can and go
northeast.

You come to the front door of a plasticoid house. It is closed and locked.
What's more, you don't have a key. Go east to the Rocky Clifftop. There isn't
much here except, oh, a black circle and a neat view. Off to the northwest you
can see a Vizicomm Booth. Go northwest. (The black circle can keep.)

Enter the Vizicomm Booth, which is out of order. Turn or pull the coin return
knob and you'll here a clank. Open the return box, and a coin drops to the
ground. Get the coin and examine it. The coin reads "Ten Marsmids." Fine. Now
go back to the Rocky Clifftop (just type "Exit"). From the clifftop, go north.
You find yourself at the back door of the plasticoid house. And you are NOT
alone!

An extraordinary number of door-to-door salesmen are camped out here. One of
them approaches you and offers to barter one of his machines for something of
equal value you might be carrying. Offer the flashlight to the salesman. In
exchange, you receive what is described as a TEE-Remover Machine.

Before the salesman can explain, he turns on your flashlight and a giant
Venusian Megamoth swoops down and carries him off. The other salesmen scatter
to the four winds. Hm -- a Tee-Remover?

Open the machine. Put the jar (of untangling cream) into the machine. Close
the door and turn on the machine. The machine whirs and grinds. When it stops,
open the door and get the jar. It now contains unAngling cream. (Oh, brother!)
Now knock on the back door.

Part 3

You are welcomed by a Mad Scientist (mit a Cherman accent, uff courze). He
welcomes you because you look like a grand candidate for his next mad
experiment! Go downstairs.

Oops! You're in the Mad Scientist's laboratory. It contains a cage. The cage
contains two gorillas. The cage also contains a rubber hose. Quick! Throw the
candy (the hunk of brown food, remember?) into the cage. Just in time! The mad
scientist straps you and Trent/Tiffany down to a couple of slabs. Then he
throws an ominous looking switch.

Suddenly, you find yourself inside the cage. You also find yourself inside a
gorilla skin! Odd, you can also see your own body still strapped to the first
slab. Gee! The female/male gorilla in here with you looks better and better all
the time. Kiss the gorilla.

This seems to satisfy the Mad Scientist that his experiment is working chust
fein, zo he bounds up the stairs, leaving you locked in the cage with the
gorilla. Your companion, who has been transported to the "body" of a Venus
Flytrap, is of no help. He remains strapped to the second slab.

Let's see, wasn't there a rubber hose on that list? Yep. Get the hose. Now
eat the candy. You feel a sugar rush. (For those of you not quite so smaht as
those Infocom fellers, a sugar rush means you feel super strong.) Good. Open
the cage. Wow! You really are super strong! You part the bars easily and can
exit the cage. Do so.

Drop the hose outside the cage. Then, go to the second slab and unstrap
Trent/Tiffany (watch out for those "tentacles!"). Next, unstrap your body.
While your sugar rush is ebbing, pull the switch. Good! You're back in your own
body again. Get off the slab and retrieve the rubber hose and put it in your
basket.

If you were paying attention when you entered the laboratory (it's always a
good idea to read the descriptions, no?), you noticed there was a black circle
at the foot of the stairs. This might be a good time to stand on it.

Zap! You're back inside the Vizicomm Booth. Exit the booth and you're back on
the clifftop. Now you can stand on the black circle you saw the first time you
came here. Doing so takes you to the Royal Docks. Moored to the end of this
dock is a royal barge. To the south is a ruined castle. Go south.

You are in the throne room of King Mitre. It seems that we've been wrong all
along about the legend of King Midas; he, who we always thought could turn
things into gold by his mere touch. It seems his real name was King Mitre, and,
in fact, everything he touched turned into forty-five degree angles.
Everything, including his own daughter. You notice one angle in
particular -- prominent because of its long golden tresses and flowing white
gown. Unlimber your handy-dandy jar of unAngling cream.

Rub the unAngling cream on the daughter. Slowly, the angle turns into King
Mitre's beautiful daughter, Princess Theta. Mitre is so happy to see her again
that he rewards you with a truly useful gift, a perfect eighty-two degree
angle. (He explains he only brushed against it.) Take the angle. Hey! Your
batting average is going up! You now have two objects out of eight. Put the
angle in the basket with the hose.

By the way, at this point your inventory may be a bit top-heavy. I mean, what
good is a jar of unAngling cream, now that it's empty? And who needs a
TEE-Remover Machine after it's done its work? That stool isn't much good,
either. Unless you're terribly possessive about such things, go ahead, drop
them, along with the matchbook, the scrap of paper and any other flotsam you
still have. On the other hand, no sense being a litterbug. Why not pick a
central spot where you can drop them unobtrusively? (I chose the basement below
my cell.) Nothing like being tidy, eh? And you never know when something might
come in handy. On the other hand, if you're a slob, there's no penalty in the
game for dropping things wherever you please, once you've used them. Just make
sure not to drop anything prematurely.

After you've got your angle tucked away, leave good King Mitre. As you
depart, you realize the dummy has inadvertently touched the princess again, but
you can't do anything about that. It's time to visit the Martian desert. Go
south.

Part 4

You've come to a Ruin, one of many you'll encounter. Go south again. You're
still in the desert. Go east to Another Ruin. Sitting on a rock is a truly
repulsive frog. I mean, this one is the repulsive frog of all repulsives in the
frog kingdom. It is also wearing a little gold crown. Go ahead, kiss the frog.

Yuck! The frog is so ugly you just cannot bring yourself to kiss it. Yet,
instinctively you realize that somehow, some way you've just got to screw up
your courage, pucker up and plant one on its repulsive kisser. For now, though,
go west, then, north to Yet Another Ruin. This one is unimpressive except for
the fact that it does seem to contain a black circle. No, don't stand on it
(unless you have a hankering to visit the basement below your cell). Retrace
your steps by going south to the frog, then, east to the Dessert.

Very sharp-eyed gamesters will have noted the word "dessert" above. "Ha!"
they will proclaim, "I knew the Sysop editors around here didn't know how to
spell!" Wrongo, smahties. The word IS Dessert. In fact, you're looking at a
fifty foot Martian Cream Pie. It is a mirage, of course. So are the trails
which appear to lead to the northwest and southwest from here. Go southeast.

You've come to an Oasis. There is a little bunny rabbit hippity-hopping
around the premises. Get him. (What you do with him, I confess, I haven't the
foggiest. But I got him anyway, so you might as well, too. Maybe he makes good
rabbit stew.) On the other hand, you also see a black circle here, and I DO
know what to do about that. That's odd. The black circle mysteriously turns
white! Get out your can and pour the black stain on the circle. That's better.
Now it's black again. Stand on the circle.

Whoosh! You're in Cleveland. (Remember, Cleveland?) Go south. Well, now,
here's a lawn that somebody cares about. Actually, it's a muddy patch of
crabgrass, but there's a rake and a sack full of leaves. Forget everything
except the sack. Take it and dump out the leaves. Now that the sack is empty,
you've got a much better receptacle than your wicker basket. Put all your
goodies except the blanket in the sack. Leave the blanket in the basket. It
looks cute in there. Now go north, then, northeast.

You're standing inside a Teensy-Weensy House. Go upstairs and You find
yourself in a Bedroom containing an open window, an unmade bed and a sheet
lying half on the floor. Get the sheet.

Tear the sheet into strips and tie the strips together (which forms a rope),
then tie the rope to the bed. Throw the loose end of the rope out the window.
Your faithful friend, Trent/Tiffany, will now shinny down the sheet. (If you
try, you soon learn you're too heavy and fall to your untimely demise. This is
not terribly important except that it ends the game.) Once on the street, your
pal will just have time to unscrew a handy headlight before being
unceremoniously struck by a truck and, evidently, killed.

Before you can burst into tears over your loss, your companion reappears in a
cloud of falling plaster as the ceiling above you collapses! He offers an
explanation of his startling reincarnation, but I won't bore you with it here.
After all, I presume you can read it for yourself if you're playing the game.
Anyway, take the headlight he/she is carrying and put it in the sack. That's
three out of eight!

Time to leave picturesque Cleveland, so go downstairs and go east into the
garden behind the Wee House. There's a trellis against the house and a fresh
piece of sod. Lifting the sod reveals another black circle! (If you need to be
told about the trellis, you're not paying attention.) Stand on the circle.
You're teleported to the basement below your cell. You see, you could have come
here from the black circle in that ruin I told you about. But if you did that
you might have missed Cleveland, and...oh, forget it.

Right about here is where I dropped all my superfluous, used-up junk. You
see, I didn't have a walkthru like you've got, and I didn't know whether I
might not need my superfluous, used-up junk again. For some reason which only a
tentacled alien could divine, the basement seemed like a logical spot. Of
course, being tidy never hurt anyone, but I think I've covered this ground
already.

Part 5

Go upstairs. Go 'way upstairs, all the way to the Roof of the Observatory,
upstairs! This time, stand on the black circle there. You will be back in the
ruin just south of King Mitre's castle. Go north. Mitre will still be sitting
on his throne, surrounded by forty-five degree angles, looking dejected. One of
them has long golden hair and a flowing white gown (sigh). If only old Mitre
could keep his paws to himself! Well, leave him to his ruminations and go north
to the Royal Docks and board the barge.

You see some simple controls. Examine the controls. One is a huge orange
button, which reads "Magnetomoor On." The other is a huge purple button. It
reads, "Go With the Flow." Pushing the orange button causes the words to read
"Magnetomoor Off." It also causes the barge to drift away from the dock into
the channel. Pushing the purple button causes the words to read "Full Speed
Ahead."

As soon as you have pushed orange, push purple, wait one turn, and push
orange again. (You can pretty much forget about purple from now on.) Anyway, by
pushing orange you have reactivated the Magnetomoor. (Magnet-O-Moor, get it?)
This is your dock/undock device. Since all the docks in the canal contain barge
magnets, all you need do to moor at one is push the orange button in a timely
fashion. To unmoor, push it again.

All right, the first dock you'll clank against is Baby Dock. Disembark and
go north. You find yourself among the Dunes, and there is a strange alien
warrior lying dead here. Next to the alien is a chapstick. Get it. Partially
buried in the sand nearby is a strangely coded message. Get that, too.

If you carefully read your 3-D comic book which comes with LGOP, you will
recall a bit in there about a transposition code. You say you forgot the code?
Well, go back and reread it. In the meantime, I'll translate the strangely
coded message. It says, "Your mission is to contact wife number nnn (the number
is inserted randomly) of the sultan/sultaness and get the secret map. Identify
yourself to her by asking her to kiss your kneecaps."

Now, wasn't that easy? Leave the alien in the dunes and go back to your
barge. Board the barge and go through the orange button ritual.

The second and extremely opulent dock you come to is THIS is My Kind of Dock!
When you reach it, exit the barge and go east. You will be in the Main Hall of
the Palace. Go south to the Laundry Room and get the clothespin. Now go back
north into the Main Hall and east into the Oriental Garden. Here, you see a
well containing handholds downward. Climb down.

At the bottom of the well is a black circle. You land upon it and are
immediately transported back to the barge. This is a good circle to know about.
It teleports you to wherever you've parked your barge, and this knowledge will
come in mighty handy later in the game. For now, though, re-exit the barge and
go back into the palace. From the main hall, go northeast.

Now, if you're playing this game as a male you will be in the sultan's
palace. If you're a lady-person, your host-person will be a sultaness. In
either case, you find yourself in the Audience Chamber confronting one or the
other, as the case may be. Whomever it is, sultan or sultaness, will confront
you with a riddle. Your faithful companion will burst out with a dumb answer
and wind up being tossed to the tigers by the palace eunuchs. Alas! You were
beginning to be fond of him/her, but on with the game. Alas, again! You're next
if you don't get it right.

The answer to the riddle is, "Riddle." So type SAY "RIDDLE." Oh, goody! The
sultan/ess begrudgingly rewards you with an hour of rapturous bliss with one of
his/her 8,379 wives/husbands. Hie thee west into the harem. Here you are
confronted by a harem guard who asks you to make a selection, any number from 1
to 8,379. Naturally, you pick the number you gleaned from the coded message.
(Remember, the message was written backward, which means the number was
backward, too.)

Wait a bit and soon your choice will beckon you to her/his obscenely
luxurious bed chamber. Ahem <er> afterward, type TELL WIFE/HUSBAND, "KISS MY
KNEECAPS." Your partner will present you with a secret map of the catacombs.
(It comes in your game package, by the way, but you'll probably still need my
directions to get through the maze. Try it without them, you'll see.) She/he
also pulls aside the covers and indicates a secret passage down. You are told
it's the only way out of the harem. Take the torch he/she gives you and go
down.

You are now in the catacombs. Well, what do you know. Here's your faithful
companion Trent/Tiffany with another outlandish explanation of his/her
reappearance. You listen and then decide to push on.

For my money, your visit to the catacombs is the toughest part of the game. I
have to admit I had help here. (Oh, all right, I had help in a couple of other
places, too. Golly! I never can get through these dumb games without help!
Besides, I HATE games!) Anyway, you need to follow these directions carefully,
including those about "Hop, Clap and Kweepa." (I TOLD you to read the comic
book.) Okay, here we go:

NW, N, NE, E, CLAP, NE, NE, SE, HOP, CLAP, KWEEPA, D, NW, NE, CLAP, N, S,
HOP, NE, CLAP, U, KWEEPA, NW.

Get the phone book. (Four out of eight!)

CLAP, NW, HOP, S, SE, CLAP, SE, D, KWEEPA, NE, CLAP, HOP, W, N, NW, CLAP, E,
W, KWEEPA, HOP, CLAP, SW, SW.

Get the raft.

N, CLAP, NE, E, HOP, KWEEPA, CLAP, NW, NE, SE, U, CLAP, NW, HOP.

Stand on the black circle.

That's it. But be sure to follow the directions precisely. Of course, if you
prefer being devoured by a Martian crocodile or some such, you can always find
your own way.

Presuming you wind up at the black circle and stand on it, you will be
teleported directly to the Well Bottom. You've been there before so you know
the black circle at the bottom will take you right back to your barge. After
the catacombs, the royal barge is kind of cosy. But there's no time to dally.
Exit the barge and go east into the palace again. This time, go east into the
Oriental Garden and from there, southeast to the base of a Tower. Actually,
it's a Minaret with stairs leading upward so go up.

The view here is breathtaking, almost as nice as the clifftop back in the
jungle. But there's also a black circle here. Stand on it.

Zowie! You find yourself in a cramped space which, as it turns out, is right
over your cell! You don't know that, of course, until the floor collapses and
you find yourself tumbling through the resultant orifice into your cell. Hm,
that's odd. There's a black circle here. Never noticed that before. (That's
because it wasn't there before, Venusian Bird Brain!) As it turns out, this
circle takes you to the main hall of the palace, but we don't want to go there
this time. Exit the cell (south) and go up to the Observatory Roof. Stand on
the circle and you're back in the Martian Desert (with one "s" this time). Go
east to the frog.

Ah, yes, you remember that ugliest of ugly frogs? Now you have both the will
and the means to kiss this total grossness. Put the clothespin on your nose.
Rub the lip balm on your lips. Then, drop everything you're carrying and cover
your ears with your hands. Close your eyes. At last! Kiss the frog!

Ooooh, another rapturous interlude with one of the opposite sex. It turns out
you're not quite (humph!) satisfied, but at least "the one" leaves you with a
small token of affection. It's a household blender. Take it. Put it in the
sack. (You have been using the sack, haven't you?) If I reckon right, that's
five out of eight. We're getting there!

Part 6

Leave the ruin and go east into the Dessert once more. Yes, the one with two
"s's." Then meander southeast to the Oasis. Stand on the circle and return to
Cleveland. No particular reason for another trip to Cleveland, really. You
could have gone to the other ruin which has a black circle and gone directly to
your cell. It's just that I sorta feel sorry for Cleveland. Nobody in his/her
right mind would EVER go there twice, would they? On the other hand, nobody in
his/her right mind would play computer games, either. Would they?

Anyway, you're back in Cleveland. Go northeast, then east (into the garden)
and get yourself zapped back to the hallway near your cell. Go down into the
basement and dump your extraneous jetsam, especially the clothespin. You'd look
pretty silly going up against the Leather Goddesses wearing a clothespin on
your nose, right?

After you've lightened your load, go up into your cell and stand on the black
circle. You find yourself back in the Main Hall of the Palace. You might want
to wipe off that gooey lip balm here. Exit the palace to the west and enter
your barge. Push orange. Wait. Push it again. (You know the drill.)

Wait until your barge clangs up against Wattz-Upp Dock. You hear a gurgling
noise to the west (it's the Oasis). Exit the barge. When you're standing on the
dock, reach over and push orange. That's right, push it! So what if your barge
goes shooting out into the canal without you. Trust me.

Go west to the Oasis, stand on the circle and, voila: Beautiful, downtown
CLEVELAND! (I told you I felt sorry! Now I'm sorry I did this one more time. I
mean, who needs Cleveland tha-ree times?) Oh, well, you're not here for long.
Go back to the garden, the black circle and...the hallway near your cell. Go up
to the Observatory Roof and stand on the circle.

A pause here for a comment or two. Make that a rebuttal. Yeah, I can hear all
you wisenheimers out there knocking my route. And I freely admit there might be
better ways to go, bypassing my revisits to dear, picturesque downtown
Cleveland. Didn't I tell you there was no particular sequence you had to
follow? C'mon, didn't I? You know it, fella. Hey, if you've got something
against Cleveland, go ahead, write your own walkthru.

I digress. You're back in the desert. You've sent your barge down the canal,
pilotless. What to do? Go west to Yet Another Ruin. Now go northwest. You've
reached Hickory & Dickory Dock. What's this? A mouse! Show the picture (of the
pussy cat) to the mouse. The poor thing is frozen with fear. Get the mouse.
(Only two more goodies to go!) Now go south, back to Yet Another Ruin. Stand on
the black circle.

Once more, you are in the basement below your cell. Got anything to drop? How
about that torch? It went "phhttttt" long ago. Okay, let it go. Next stop,
upstairs to your cell. Stand on the black circle. You arrive at the palace. Go
east into the Oriental Garden and enter the well.

Well, well (a little humour there, folks) you're zapped from the Well Bottom
right slap dab onto your barge. Where is it? Why, it's right here at the Icy
Dock, 'way, 'way down at the southern terminus of the canal.

Okay, I'll bite. Why didn't you just take the scenic route aboard the barge
all the way down the canal to here? It would have been restful and, well,
scenic; not to mention saving a lot of aggravation, wouldn't it, boobie? Well,
for one thing, you would have missed those neato trips to Cleveland. For
another, you probably would have missed the mouse, too. Oh, and one other
point: If you'd taken the barge route you would have died.

It seems there is this gigantic machine just before you get to the Icy Dock.
It's some sort of Martian (Phobotian?) energy machine, and it used to supply
power to the whole planet. It doesn't work quite like it used to, but it works
just well enough to send a lethal ion beam out over the canal. If you try to
pass through it, say, on a barge, well, first you get a little headache. Then
you get a truly humungous headache. Finally, after the humungous headache
assumes gigantically unbearable proportions you, er, explode. And that's a
fact.

Aren't you glad we went to Cleveland?

Okay, from the Icy Dock, exit the barge and go south. Oh, no, your faithful
pal Trent/Tiffany slips on the ice and disappears into the frigid waters of the
canal. No matter, go south, like I said. You are at the edge of the polar ice
cap. Needless to say, it's cold. Go southeast.

Oh, good grief! Your passage forward is blocked by a whole waddling phalanx
of penguins! One of them is carrying a sign. Read the sign. It suggests that
you donate to the Penguin Relief Fund. Well, there's nothing for it but to give
your coin (the Marsmid tenner) to the penguin.

The penguin thanks you graciously, and gives you your change, a one Marsmid
coin. (You don't know it yet, but the little guy just did you a favour.) The
penguins part to let you pass, so go southeast.

You arrive at a gypsy camp. About the only thing here is a single forlorn
tent, pitched on the north side of the camp. You are greeted by two robots, a
male and a female (they're gypsies, see). No sooner do they invite you in for
tiffin than a meteorite swoops down and kills both robots dead. Oh, dear, from
inside the tent you hear the wail of a baby crying, "Mummy."

Enter the tent. Sure enough, it's a gypsy robot baby. Get the baby and put it
in your wicker basket. Oh, that's nice. The baby appreciates the warmth of the
blanket and instantly goes to sleep. As for you, exit the tent and go
south - to the South Pole, as a matter of fact.

What else would you expect to find at the South Pole? Righto! It's an Igloo!
But the front door is locked. Gazing through the igloo window you are
tantalized by the sight of a pair of cotton balls. Instantly, your brain cells
focus, cutting through the fog of forgetfulness like lasers. You suddenly
recall that cotton balls were on the list. How to get them?

Let's re-read that description of the igloo one more time. Yessir, I thought
so. There's a sign over the door. It reads, "Martian Orphanages, Inc., South
Polar Branch." Well, what do you suppose might be an appropriate action for
someone carrying an orphan in a basket to take, standing like you are on the
doorstep of an orphanage? Listen, if you can't figure this one out for
yourself, you never, ever should try another text adventure game again. After
all, you might have to get through the next one without a walkthru.

Hey, you're smahtah than I thought you were! You put the wicker basket on the
doorstep. Then, you hide behind a snowdrift and wait. Sure enough, from inside
the igloo emerges a matronly woman of immense proportions. She takes the basket
and its contents into the igloo and closes the door. But she doesn't lock it.

Open the door, enter the igloo, get the cotton balls and scram. Retrace your
steps north to the gypsy camp, northwest to the penguin park, then go west to
the Allusion Room. As it turns out, the Allusion Room is nothing more or less
tan a black circle. Stand on it. You are whisked back to the Oasis. Well, I'll
be a petrified penguin! Here's Trent/Tiffany, emerging alive and well. The saga
of how he/she survived the fall into the icy waters is too bizzarre to bear
repeating, so we'll move right along. Stand on the circle at the Oasis. Guess
where we are now?

Part 7

Cleveland!!! This is really ridiculous, so let's beat feet. Get into that
garden and onto the circle. You're back in the hallway so go on up one more
time to the Observation Room (the one with the closet to the north). Go into
the closet. It's too dark to see, but you can still stand on the circle. I'm
sure you remember it takes you to the jungle. Leave the jungle by way of the
circle on the clifftop. Go ahead, there won't be any flytraps, salesmen or mad
scientists to stop you.

You are teleported for the last time to the Royal Docks. (Just a tad away is
Mitre's castle, but you're not going there this time.) Instead, put your raft
(the one you've been lugging along since you found it in the catacombs) into
the water. Board the raft.

Here, you have to be alert. As you drift down the canal in your raft, you
might be lulled into your customary state of not carefully reading the
descriptions in the game. Do not permit this to occur. What you're looking for
is a passage indicating that a dock is close enough for you to grab. Actually,
you will pass several docks which are eminently grabbable. Grab them all just
to be on the safe side. The one you want is Donald Dock.

When you've grabbed Donald Dock, exit the raft (you pull it onto the dock for
safe-keeping). Go south to the Dunetop. From here, go east to the Canalview
Mall. There appears to be just one shop in the mall worth visiting and it lies
to the south. Go south. You are in the Exit Shop. The sign says, "Exits bought
and sold." Buy an Exit.

Now, I told you the penguins did you a favour. If you had tried to buy the
Exit with your ten Marsmid coin, the shopkeeper (one of the more lively gents
in the story, by the way) would have refused you. It seems Exits cost just one
Marsmid and he wouldn't dream of overcharging you nor can he make change. As
things stand, he takes your one Marsmid coin and, sleepily, hands you a
cardboard tube. It falls into the dust. Retrieve the tube, open it and you find
your Exit. What's an Exit, for goodness sakes? It's a sort of collapsible black
circle, that's what. Tuck it away and go north, then west, then north, back to
Donald Dock.

Re-launch your raft, board it and drift. Once again, grab any dock you see.
Eventually, you will come to Wattz-Upp Dock. Exit your raft, leave it and head
to the Oasis. Stand on the circle.

Now really, gang! I'm sorry. But there was no other way. Just forget it's
Cleveland, go to the garden and stand on the circle. I promise. We won't be
coming back. Hey, you've got seven items out of eight. That ain't all bad.
Isn't it worth just one more trip to Cleveland? Oh. Listen, you don't have to
get nasty about this.

Once back in the hallway, go up to the closet in the Observation Room and
stand on the circle. When you get to the jungle, go west. You're in the
Spawning Ground. And there's just one circle left you've never used before.
Stand on the circle.

You find yourself in the hold of a giant spaceship. There's a sword here. Oh,
Lord! A dark figure appears from the shadows of the hold and hurls a
radium-powered grenade onto the floor! Your faithful friend Trent/Tiffany hurls
him/her self on the thing, saving you and giving up his life...quite messily if
I may say, in the process. No time to lose! Get the sword. Don't dally either.
Go south.

You are in a stable where you find a magnificent white stallion. Actually,
you are aboard the flagship of the LEATHER GODDESSES OF PHOBOS Main Attack
Fleet. The stable you're in contains the Leather Goddesses' Main Attack Fleet
Cavalry Mounts, of which the stallion is one. Mount the stallion and kick it in
the flank. Go west.

The stallion dashes down a long east-west corridor in the ship, reaching with
stallion-like speed the main hatch of the ship. Here you spy a white therma
suit. Dismount, put on the suit and open the hatch. Go north.

You are in space. Floating near the battle cruiser you have just left is a
small passenger spaceship. Near the small passenger spaceship is a sinister
figure. He/she turns out to be Thorbast/Thorbala, who is further identified as
the Chief Assassin of the LEATHER GODDESSES OF PHOBOS. 'Twas he, it appears,
who hurled that grenade. Thorbast is busily engaged, strapping a beautiful,
helpless young lady/man to the hull of the small passenger spaceship. Your
move. Attack Thorbast with your sword.

For awhile, Thorbast will parry your thrusts, and it will be nip and tuck
whether you get by this episode or not. While you're fighting for your dear
life, you notice a perfectly dreadful bug-eyed monster, oozing its way toward
Thorbast's helpless victim. The hideous monster reaches the woman/man and
starts to remove her/his garments, one at a time. The helpless victim shrieks
in terror.

Meanwhile, you keep attacking Thorbast. Eventually, in the furore of the
action, he drops his sword. Ever the gallant, you retrieve the sword and give
it back to your foe. Realizing you are truly the good guy, Thorbast knows now
that he doesn't have a chance. So he saves us all a lot of trouble and impales
himself upon his own sword. Farewell, Thorbast. Now it's the monster's turn.

Interestingly enough, the bug-eyed horror is getting down to the interesting
part when you attack. He squawks once and flees, leaving his victim just barely
clad and grateful as all get-out that you happened along. You release her/him
and follow her/him into the cabin of the small spaceship. From the wall of the
ship she/he plucks a photo and gives it to you. (It just happens to be a
picture of Jean Harlow/Douglas Fairbanks, the very thing you've been looking
for.) You are told that, written on the back, is the address of daddy, who will
reward you handsomely if you ever visit Ganymede. With that, the lady/man exits
to the east, closing the door with a flourish. Naturally, you follow.

Shocked to see you, the lady/man is nonetheless receptive to your advances.
What follows is another one of those boring orgy type events which we'd just
better skip for now. After all, we still have to deal with those Leather
Goddesses before they launch their invasion fleet and all is lost. We have all
the items Trent/Tiffany wanted. But golly! When last we saw Trent/Tiffany,
he/she was splattered all over the hold of that LGOP battleship!

Exit the small passenger spaceship and go south twice. You will be back
inside the LGOP battle cruiser. Walk (do not ride the stallion) east down the
long east-west corridor. Well, I'll be a Thorbast's Thorax! Here's
Trent/Tiffany, following along behind, explaining how he/she got here! Keep
walking until you reach the black circle. Stand on the circle.

You are back in the Oasis. This time, though, don't use the exit here.
Instead, drop your own Exit. Stand on that.

You are in a boudoir, lying on a divan. Next to you, actually, is a figure
you can barely make out in the shadows. You can't see who it is, but the heavy
scent of leather is unmistakable. Go ahead. Touch the goddess. Oh, go on!

Yipes! You have violated the sanctity of the LEATHER GODDESSES OF PHOBOS
private boudoir! For this transgression, you are summarily ejected through a
trap door, down a long chute into the Plaza.

What follows is a hilarious description of the attack upon you and
Trent/Tiffany by the entire armed minions of the LEATHER GODDESSES OF PHOBOS.
It's worth the price of the game. While the attack goes on, all that remains is
for you to hand to Trent/Tiffany each of the items you have procured at such
great peril, one by one as you are instructed. Suffice to say, Trent/Tiffany
puts them to good use, constructing the best doggoned Super-Duper Anti-LEATHER
GODDESSES OF PHOBOS Attack Machine ever crafted on this or any other planet by
a faithful companion.

Suffice also to say that the machine works and the minions of the LEATHER
GODDESSES OF PHOBOS are routed. As for you, you're back in Upper Sandusky,
Ohio, lying dazed in the roadside near a sleepy-looking gas station. From
within emerge three uniformed attendants, cooing prettily (or booming
manfully), "Are you all right?" The game has ended, and all you can do now is
await patiently for the sequel. Coming soon from those smahties at Infocom: Gas
Pump Girls Meet the Pulsating Inconvenience from Planet X.

Complete Solution:
Here are the locations of interest with their coordinates.
 1 The ruins of Heslon	34°E, 12°S
 2 Asraela (in lake)	19°E, 04°S
 3 Rastun (mountains)	45°E, 07°N
 4 Lothian castle	07°W, 18°N
 5 Larkspur		56°W, 26°N
 6 The mountain cave	57°W, 16°N
 7 Forlorn castle	17°W, 13°S
 8 Marlot		29°W, 28°S
 9 Trubly (island)	59°W, 17°S
10 Shrine of Might	67°E, 19°N
11 Wenhea		62°E, 25°S
12 The evil castle	67°E, 10°S
13 The magic tree	67°E, 27°N
14 Shrine of Protection 17°W, 29°N

First, visit Larkspur. Take the rope from the girl in the extreme upper right
corner. Then travel to the Lothian castle, where you should go along the
central corridor leading to King Lothian, but go through the door that leads
to the brig instead.
  Talk to the prisoner standing right next to the bars, and he will give you a
key. Leave the castle and go to Rastun, where you get a lantern from a man in
the upper left corner area (in the mountains). Next go to Asraela, and take
the axe in the hut.
  Go to the Forlorn castle (enter with the key), and first go to the garden in
the very center of the first floor. Take the rose. Now you could use the key
to go into the dungeon (the treasure there is the Orb of Sight), but you need
only go to the second floor and take the compass from the man in the
observatory. Use it to get to know coordinates.
  Finally, talk to Lord Forlorn and say Yes. Leave the castle and go to
Wenhea, where you must give the rose to the pretty girl. She will give you her
mirror in return. Go to the ruins of Heslon (kill the Medusa with the mirror
before entering), and grab the unicorn with the rope.
  If your inventory seems full, go back to the Forlorn castle and say Yes to
Lord Forlorn. This will take away the mirror. Otherwise just go to Marlot,
where you should show your gemstone to the man selling ships (unless you've
got 5000 gold to spare!), and he will give you a ship.
  Enter the ship. There's no need to visit Trubly, but you should go to the
mountain cave instead. Enter with the lantern and find the wizard. Talk to him
and he will give you an amulet. Use it.
  Then go to the magic tree, possibly visiting any shrines along the way. The
chant for the Shrine of Protection is "SUKANG" and the one for the Shrine of
Might is "JINSOM". You can now safely walk along the marsh, thanks to the
amulet. Chop the tree with the axe, and go to the Forlorn castle one last
time.
  Give Lord Forlorn all he wants, and he will give you a horn. Go back to your
ship and go to the evil castle, which you enter with the horn. Now take a good
look at a map (or draw one of your own) and memorise the traps. They take away
1...7 health points a time if you set them off. To progress, you must set
at least some traps off. NEVER SAVE A GAME WHEN YOU ARE ON A TRAP!
  Find the stairs and descend. Now find the potion and get it, but don't drink
it yet. Instead go to the evil sorcerer. Drink the potion (this will cure all
your wounds) and talk to the sorcerer. Kill him and take the spellbook that is
left.
  Go back to your ship, sail to the Lothian castle and enter. Go to King
Lothian and use the spellbook on him.

Press <ALT> and <X> to bypass the proof of age questions. You can go to
any location in the game by by hitting <ALT> & <D> and entering (TP). It
asks for a location number, so enter a number from 008 to 045.

This solve did'nt get all the points, but it finishes the game. my
additions are in capitals.....(score 215 of 222)

The 1st step is to enter the bar, go to the bathroom and read the
walls several times until you get the password. Then go to the sink
and get the ring. you can (must!) use the toilet if you want. Go
to the bar and buy a whiskey. Go to the drunk next to the bathroom
wall and (kick him to wake him) give him the whiskey and he'll give
you the remote control. Get the rose too. Go back into the bar and
knock on the big door.. when he asks you for the password.. tell him
"KEN SENT ME", then enter. Turn on the T.V. with the remote. Keep
changing channels until you find a channel he likes.. he'll move
from the stairs. Climb up and voila! The prostitute: Don't hop
into bed with her until you get the rubber. You just need the candy
on the bench. Get it. go out the window, and go to the fire-escape
ladder. You'll fall into a dumpster. Search it and get the hammer.
Exit the dumpster and go left. Call a cab at the street.

Now go to the casino and go through the lobby. Get the card in the
ashtray. Now gamble a bit until you have about 250 dollars. Go
outside. Sometime in the game when outside the casino, a guy in a
barrel will come up and ask you to buy an apple. Buy it. Call the
cab.. tell him to go to the store. enter the store and buy a
rubber. Also get the (magazine and) cheap wine in the back.
(never enter the cab with the wine.. the cabbie will get drunk and
kill you) pay for the wine and exit.. Wait for the russian looking
guy to come from the left. (Ignore the dog) When he comes, give him
the wine.. not money. (Look at phone dial number, answer the
questions) Once you have the knife go right and show the pass to
the bouncer at the disco door. Go in and sit down at the table with
the lady. Smile and give her the ring, the candy, and the rose.
Ask her to dance. When you finish off with the dancing ask her to
marry you. She'll ask you for $100. Give it to her and meet her at
the marrage chapel. It's east of the casino front. Enter and go up
to the front. Type "MARRY", and you'll get married. Go up to the
honeymoon suite. (fourth floor, door with the heart, push four).
Knock, and enter. She'll be on the bed, and {NOT IN THE MOOD!?!}
Turn on the radio and listen to it. You'll get a number to call to
get the wine delivered that she wants. Go to the casino and get
some taxi fare money. Go to the phone in front of the store,
(answer the phone if it rings) call the number and have them
deliver it to the {HONEYMOON SUITE}. If they say it probably won't
show up, you screwed up on the typing. Go back to the casino and go
to the suite. Be sure that you have the knife. Enter and pour the
wine. Things will take they're course and you'll find yourself tied
to the bed. (THE BITCH!) Use the knife and free yourself. Get the
rope and leave. Go to the casino again and using some saving, use
the dollar and get about $50. (go to cabaret. find a seat and
sitdown. listen to act.) Once you have it, go to the bar and knock
on the door again. Go up the stairs and screw her now that you have
the rubber. Remove the rubber after you've used it. Go out the
window and this time go to the right of the balcony. Tie the rope
to yourself and tie it to the railing. Type "GO WINDOW" or (reach
out) something so your hanging in front of the window on the right.
Break the glass with the hammer. Get the pills. Pull on the rope
and untie yourself. Go down the fire escape and call a cab again.
Go to the casino and go to the eighth floor. Talk to the lady at
the desk until the game tells you that you'll need some medicine or
something. Give her the pills. She'll run off and leave the desk
unguarded. Push the button and enter the open doors on the right.
Enter and go up and right. When you're in the room with the bed,
open the closet door. Enter it and type, "LOOK". Get the doll...
(look at doll. inflate doll. look at doll. use doll.) then wait as
you run after it. When you're near the hottub, (remove clothes)
enter it. Look at the lady. smile, and give her the apple. Things
will then run they're course, and voila!

E, into your cabin

Walk to the back of the cabin, "get fruit", walk through door to the East.

!Don't go near the woman, she will whip you to death!

W, back into your cabin, stand behind the closet, "Wear swimsuit", walk
back through door to the East, walk over to the cabinet (don't get too
close to the bed!, "open drawer", "look in drawer", "get kit", walk
through door to your cabin, leave your cabin.

Go up to the third deck and walk as far East as possible.

You'll now be at the pool. "Use sunscreen" go to the nearest sunbed,
"lie down".

Do NOT follow the woman that approaches you.

"Stand", walk into the pool, "Swim" (Or you'll drown :)) "dive", swim to
the bottom of the pool, "get top", swim back up. Swimming is easiest
with the mouse, clicking on the bottom of the pool every time his arms
point forward. But you'll have to use the keyboard when you get to the
very top. If your not fast enough here your lungs will explode.

Swim to the edge of the pool, "get out", "use sunscreen", leave the pool
and go back to your cabin.

When in your cabin, stand behind the closet and "wear suit". Leave your
cabin and walk up to the very top of the boat (The resteraunt).

In the resteraunt, walk to the end of the bar and "get dip".

Now go to the far West of the third deck (The barber shop) walk over to the
chair and "Sit".

Leave the Barber shop and walk up the stairs to the bridge. Once there,
sneak over behind the captain and "Pull lever". Sneak back out of the
bridge and make your way to one of the lifeboats (The one to the far left).

Stand next to the railings by the boat and "Jump into boat".

As you sail away from the boat do the following: "Use sunscreen",
"Eat dip", "Wear wig"

If all goes to plan you should now crash land on a beach.

Go South and you should find yourself in some wilderness, you'll walk about
lost in it for a bit... when you get close enough, "get flower" from the
middle of the screen. Dont worry if you miss it, you'll get more chances.

When the sequence finally ends you'll be in a posh resteraunt. Walk over to
the man and "Talk man". He will tell you to sit and wait, so walk over to
the chair and "sit".

Once the Maitre'd has finished seating the other guests you will be shown
your table and given some food. !Do not eat the food! Walk over to the
buffet and "Examine buffet" then walk over to the cheese and "Take Knife".

Now leave the resteraunt and you will find yourself back in the wilderness,
now's the time to get that flower if you missed it.

When you've found your way you'll be in a guestroom. "look" to get your
bearings and then walk over to the nightstand and "take matches" now walk
into the bathroom and "take soap" from by the sink.

Leave the Guestroom and after a while you'll find yourself in the Barbers.
Walk over to the chair and "Sit". When he's finished you'll be a blonde,
now leave the shop, bak into the wilderness where you'll find yourself
back on the beach.

Go west "look", walk to the far West of the screen and "Get bikini". Now go
East and South back into the wilderness.

When you walk into the resteraunt, just leave again.

One in the Guestroom stand in the dressing area behind the bathroom and
"Wear bikini". Now "Put dough in top".

Walk South back into the wilderness and you will find yourself in the
Barber shop again, once there walk over to the chair and "sit". When
finished, leave South and you'll end up on the beach.

Once on the beach, walk East and East again.

In the next bit you'll have to edge yourway along a cliff face, but dont
worry, you cant fall off even if you try. Try and fall off really far
towards the end to see how far his legs stretch.

As you corner the last cliff face type "Wear suit".

You'll now find yourself at the airport.

Walk up to the two dancing men and "give man flower" (be careful not to get
too close) O.k, now walk into the airport where you will see some never
ending qeue's, where the qeue you are in will never get shorter, what fun!

Ignore the qeue's and walk off to the West where you will find another
Barber shop. Walk in and up to the lady, "look lady", walk to the chair and
"sit".

When finished, leave the barber shop.

If you want to see one of the amusing deaths now (I suggest you save first)
sit next to the lady on the chair and then follow her when she leave's.

Assuming that you didn't do this or have loaded your saved game from outside
the barber shop, go East and East again.

Walk over to the man and "talk man", he'll ask you for your passport, "Give
man passport". After looking through your possesions he'll let you through
the gate to the East which will open when you walk up to it. Walk through it
and you'll find yourself in the X-ray room.

Now stand next to the conveyor belt and wait for a bag with a bomb in it to
come by, when the bag comes to you, "get bag". You might also like to get
other bag's and see what's in them for fun. If you dont think you'll be able
to spot the bag then just get every bag that passes you by.

Once the automatic sequence is finished, the qeue's will have cleared. Walk
up to the lady and "buy ticket".

When the lady has finished, go East and show man passport. Go East and East
again. Walk up to the snack bar and "Buy food" when you are brought the food
"look in food" !!!Dont eat it!!! You'll now find a pin in the gravy, "take
pin". Now walk over to the vending machines to the East and "Put money in
machine" you'll now get a parachute. Quickly walk up the conveyor belt and
after a bit you'll find yourself in the waiting room.
Walk over to the counter and "get pamphlet" then "give man ticket". Walk on
to the plane and you'll end up in your seat.

After takeoff "Get bag", "Give man pamphlet", "stand", walk East to the back
of the plane. Find the emergency door, "Pick lock", "Move handle", "wear
parachute", "open door". You will now be sucked out. Quickly "open
parachute" and you should land on an island.

You'll now find yourself hanging from a tree in the parachute, "cut rope" to
free yourself

Now walk over to the stick (North and East a bit) and "Get stick".

The next bit is dangerous, in fact, this whole island is, so be very careful
and save lots.

There is a hive of killer bees on the small tree
to the south. Walk over to it and "crawl" then exit South. (or dont and see
what happens)
(By the way, did you notice anything about that rock you just passed?)

In the next bit there is a snake in the tree so walk up to the branch and
just as it is about to attack you "Use stick" (or don't and see what
happens) When you have done this walk off the screen to the South East.

The next screen is a swamp. Follow the dry path on the swamp (the path
actually looks more like a reflection than a path) or jump into the swamp
and see what happens. (This bit is best done with the mouse)

This next screen is really fun, save the game and then try walking through
the river. However, if you don't want to die then the way to do it is to
swing from the vines. Walk over to the far right and next to the water of
the bank you are on and type grab vine. You will swing across, then, quickly
type it again (Or press F3) to grab the next one, do this until you reach
the edge. Now walk up to the tree and "get vine". Now exit the
screen to the East.

*automatic mode*

When the sequence is finished you'll be standing next to a chasm with a tree
on the other side. Go South, then East, walk over to the burnt out fire and
"get ashes" now go back to the chasm and stand right next to the edge, now
"throw vine" you'll get to the other side.

Now go North until you reach the edge of the volcano, covered in
ice. Stand next to the edge where the ice slopes up and "use
ashes" Once past the ice, walk up to the very top of the volcano.

Ok, now stand very close to the hole in the volcano (not too close though or
you'll fall in) "Put bag in bottle" "light bag" "drop bottle".

The elevator door will now open, so walk in.

Complete Solution:
As Larry: Part I

THE BEGINNING
The game begins as you stand looking at the beautiful view of Nontoonyt atop
Vista Point. Look in the left binoculars for a "nice" view. You might want
to also take a look at that wonderful plaque put there for your honor. Read
it. STOP looking at the plaque, and go left, and you'll be in the right of
the jungle. A pointing finger will show you your way home. Go home, and
get dumped by your wife (the bitch!). Then go back to the jungle, and to the
lower right where you should find another jungle area. Walk in a little bit
and you'll change back to the Larry we all know and love. Go back home, look
in the mailbox and get the credit card. Then go back to the first jungle, then
LOOK GRANADILLA and be sure to pick up the piece of wood. Then, go
right again to the second jungle screen. Then go to the lower right. A
pointing finger will point you to your job. Go there, walk into the offices
to the left, and have a nice "chat" with your boss (the jerk!). Walk back to
the screen with the fountain in it, and then go down to the beach. A girl
should be laying there. Look at her, talk to her, etc. Then give her the
card. She'll show you her appreciation. You'll get the knife she buys from
the vendor. Leave up to the fountain screen again.
Now, sharpen the knife on the steps to the casino (on the right). Then
CARVE the WOOD into the "statue. "Go to the top left back into that second
jungle screen. Go up to the top right hand corner (you have to go around some
bushes, and make sure you exit to the right, not the top) and you should be
in the screen with CHIP 'N DALE's. Cut the grass, and then weave it into a
skirt. Now go to the right hand corner and exit right. Go into the comedy
hut and talk to the guys in the back left corner. Then go and sit in the
chair in the middle table. Watch the ENTIRE routine, up to the duck
impression (you get points!).

HOW TO GET THE BEACH GIRL'S $20
Go back down to the fountain screen. Then go right, behind the steps.
This should put you in a screen with the cabana. Go to the left cubicle and
WEAR SKIRT. Then go back to the beach and you will sell the statue to the
girl who is laying there. Now you have $20. Go back down and get her towel.
Go back to the cabana and change into your leisure suit. While you are there,
pick up that soap on a rope that's on the fountain on the left side of the
cabana. Get a drink too if you like. Then go back to the beach and THROW
your TOWEL to get a nice tan. But don't do it for too long, lest you burn!

HOW TO WATCH THE DANCE SHOW
Now go into the casino (up the steps) and go straight for two screens,
then left when you can't go straight anymore. Look in the mirror (for some
points) then go left into the theater lounge room. Give your pass (it's in
the manual) to the ticketman. He'll ask you some questions about it which
can be found in the manual (you *DID* buy this game, didn't you?)Then, tip
the man with the $20 to get your front row seat. Enjoy the show.
Stand in the lounge until Cherri Tart comes out to use the phone. Talk
to her until she tells you she wants land. GIVE her LAND and she tells you
to come back when you get the deed.

WHERE TO GET THE DEED
Exit the casino, go left to the second jungle screen and then go to the
upper, right hand corner (sort of near where you went to the Chip 'N Dale
screen). When you get to that corner, go UP rather than right and you'll find
yourself in front of the Law Offices of Dewey, Cheatem, and Howe. Walk on in,
and ASK FOR a DIVORCE. You'll be directed to Ms Cheatem who'll talk a while,
then send you out. As you leave her office, she'll tell you about the deed.
Leave the office, then enter again, and Roger, the clerk will give the deed.

HOW TO GET THE FAT CITY CARD
Go back to Cherri and give her the deed. She'll show her appreciation! Then,
when appropriate, DANCE. It exits by itself. Now go back to the Law Office,
and pay for the divorce (give the money to Roger). You must be wearing the
silly getup for this (You'll know what we mean). Suzi Cheatem will show her
appreciation! She'll tell you about the divorce papers, then leave the
office, and come back in. Pick up the papers from Roger. LOOK at the papers.
Hey! It's a Fat City membership keycard! Neat!

WHAT TO DO AT FAT CITY
Go to the theater lounge (where you first met Cherri) and open the
backstage door. Change back into that dapper suit of yours. Leave the
casino going back to the second jungle screen (one screen left of the
fountain) and go to the lower left. You should find yourself at the whale.
Go into its mouth, and go into the left door with the keycard (OPEN DOOR).
Look on the back of the card you found, and you'll see three places which can
be found in your game manual/magazine. Remember the page numbers of each of
these places (in order) for they are the combination to your locker. Your
locker is locker #69 of course, and it can be found by FIND LOCKER until you
are "burning hot! "Open the locker with the combination (page #'s of the
ads in order). Change into the sweats. *CLOSE THE LOCKER*Go to the top
right door and workout on all four stations. Do twelve of each. Now you're
a stud!
Go back to your locker, unlock it, and remove your sweats. Then close
the locker again and go to the top left door. Take a shower (using the soap!)
and when you leave, DRY OFF with the towel. Go back to the locker, use the
deodorant, and wear your suit. Close the locker. Then leave the locker room
and enter the top door with your keycard. Go right up to Bambi and look at
her. Talk to her, then HELP BAMBI with her video problem. She'll show her
appreciation!
For extra points, go to the first jungle screen and go down and left.
There should be a tv set and a bench with a newspaper on a table next to the
bench. GET NEWSPAPER and READ it. (this is all optional- just for points).

HOW TO MAKE PATTI HAPPY
Go to the screen with Chip 'n Dales and go into the cave on the left.
Get some of the flowers near the edge of the cliff. Make a lei out of them.
Go back into the casino, go up as far as you can, and this time, go right
instead of left at the picture. Go right past the mirror to the piano lounge
where Patti should be. Look at her, talk to her, show your divorce papers,
give her the lei, and GO TO ROOM.

HOW TO FINISH PART I
But she wants some wine! No problem. Go to the comedy hut, and there
should be a bottle on the middle table. Get it, go back into the casino, but
when you get in, go right instead of forward. Press the button on the
elevator, and when inside press the nine button. Pour the wine, and she'll
REALLY show her appreciation! Congratulations, you've solved part I!

As Patti: Part II

WHAT YOU NEED AS PATTI
Ok, now you are Patti and you're in pursuit of Larry's pulsating pecs.
First thing you need to do is get that wine bottle off of the tray. Then
go behind the screen and put on your panties, bra, pantyhose, and dress.
Then go to the piano lounge (where you met Larry) and get the magic marker,
and the money off of the piano.
Now go to the cabana screen and fill the bottle full of water from the
fountain (you might want to get a drink yourself too. . You're going on a
long journey). Now go to Chip 'N Dales- Yes! It's finally open! Pay the
man at the door, walk inside, sit down in the chair, and enjoy the show.
When Dale comes by after the show, call him and talk to him. Ask him for
help, but he doesn't really give any. Anyway, get up and leave. Go to the
right to the comedy hut screen, then to the upper right near the bamboo.
You should find yourself near a cliff. Go into the bamboo at the upper left
and you'll be in "a twisty turny maze" of bamboo.

THE SOLUTION FOR THE BAMBOO MAZE
We graphed out this maze on graph paper, and so if for some reason this
doesn't work for you, you can graph it out for yourself. Anyway, here it is:
(from the first screen where the path leads straight up):UP, UP, RIGHT,
RIGHT, UP, LEFT, UP, RIGHT, UP, UP, UP, LEFT, LEFT, DOWN, LEFT, LEFT, UP, UP,
LEFT, UP. Each direction is one screen. When you become delirious, drink
the water.

HOW TO GET OFF OF CLIFF #1
When you exit, get as close as you can to the edge of the stream and drink.
Then, go up and here's where we found a bug. If you type REMOVE PANTYHOSE, it
will say "OK. " and give you 15 points. If you then exit the screen it'll put
the pantyhose back on and you can go back to the screen and REMOVE PANTYHOSE
again for another 15 points. You can do this as many times as you like. This
worked on the IBM version- I can't guarantee it'll work for any other. But,
no matter. REMOVE PANTYHOSE and get close to that big rock at the top of the
screen. Then TIE HOSE TO ROCK and you'll lower yourself down the cliff.

HOW TO GET OFF OF CLIFF #2
After the hose breaks you should find yourself on a little mini-cliff
thing with marajuana growing on it. Take the pot, and MAKE a ROPE out of it.
(you might want to save the game and smoke it instead. It's pretty funny. )
Then climb up the tree and get the coconuts. Then climb down. Throw the
rope at the rock on the other side, and tie your end to the tree. You won't
get across without a harness, so RIP your DRESS and then climb the rope to
the other side. Carefully make your way across the cliff and exit on the
upper left hand side.

BEATING THE PIG
Now carefully make your way up but stop when the feral pig gets in your
way. Only one thing to do. REMOVE your BRA and put the coconuts in them.
Then SWING BRA and hit the pig with the coconuts. Now it's clear. Go up to
the river.

HOW TO CROSS THE RIVER
When you get to the river, swim in a little and look where the water
is moving (there's a little wave kinda thing). Type LOOK IN BUSHES and GET
the LOG. Then PUSH it out into the water and CLIMB ON the LOG. Save the
game now, as you'll be playing a mini-arcade game. Dodge the rocks and stuff
as they come by, saving periodically whenever you get some distance. Finally,
you should make it out alive.

BEATING THE AMAZONS
But oh no! It's those nasty lesbian amazons! They've taken you and put
you in a cage with your lover larry. Talk to larry, look around, etc. When
satisfied, DRAW a DOOR with your magic marker. Magic eh? Now get out!

FINISHING THE GAME
Now you've done it! Exit to your right. Then go to the right again. When you
get to the anti-grav machine, simply shut it off when you are upside-down
near the switch. Then go to the right and watch the show!

GETTING STARTED
What's the basic idea behind this game? How do I play?
Help all the babes in the game. Find a babe. Talk to her. Find out what she
needs, get it for her, and get ready for some gratitude. Not! Don't get
frustrated. Helping one babe may allow you to eventually find the right babe
for you.

How do I get started?
If you're in the front lobby at the beginning of the game, try talking to the
front desk clerk to get your room key. Go up the stairs to your room, unlock
your door and go inside. Look at the table. Try calling all the phone numbers
on the cards on the table. Go to the bathroom. Use the sink. Look at the brown
water. Call maintenance to send a plumber up to fix it.

How do I use the elevator or the ice machine next to my room?
Some things are not useful at the beginning of the game such as the elevator
and ice machine. We're going to try hard to make you forget about certain
things that you see early on, so keep your eyes peeled and remember to look at
things later that you couldn't use at the start!

GAMMIE

What does Gammie want?
Gammie wants to use the Cellulite Machine. You'll have to fix it.

How do I repair the Cellulite machine's piston?
Go to the dining room. Walk into the kitchen. Put your hand in the garbage to
find a can of lard. Take the lard and use it to lubricate the large piston on
the left.

How do I repair the Cellulite machine's ripped vacuum hose?
Go to the Mud Bath and walk one screen to the right to reach the Weight Room.
There is a wide rubber belt on the BunShaker machine. If the BunShaker machine
is being used, talk to the body-builder, Thunderbird. Leave the room and
return. The BunShaker should be vacant and you can take the belt. Use the belt
on the hole in the vacuum hose of the Cellulite Machine.

How do I clean the Cellulite machine's filter?
Use a wrench on the filter tank bolt. Open the filter lid. Take the clogged
filter and use it on the sink in the Kitchen to clean it. Put the filter back
in the filter tank. Close the lid and tighten the bolt with the wrench.

Where can I find a wrench?
You can get a wrench from the plumber. Go to your bathroom and run the water in
the sink. If you see brown water, call maintenance at extension 76 to report
your plumbing problems. If the water is clear, stuff a roll of toilet paper
down the toilet. You can get some toilet paper from the front of the maid's
cart that appears every now and then outside your room. When the plumber
arrives, click the pick-up icon next to the plumber to get the wrench. Use the
pick-up icon, not the hand icon. Take his file too, you might need it.

I think the machine works, but I can't seem to tell Gammie. Why?
Give the machine a test run. Turn it on. Wait for the message that everything
is okay. Once you see the message, shut the machine down and go talk to Gammie.

Where can I get an orange?
Go to the Dining Room. Click your hand on the salad bar to find an orange. Take
the orange.

I need something to cool Gammie's forehead. What can I do?
Get a washcloth from the front of the maid's cart that appears every now and
then outside your room. Click the washcloth on the pool. Go to the Kitchen.
Open the refrigerator door. Put the wet cloth inside and close the fridge door.
Leave the Kitchen. Return to the Kitchen and open the fridge. Use the take icon
to pick up the cool cloth.

Where can I get some mineral water?
If Gammie asks for some mineral water, go to the hallway door east of the Blues
Bar to find a room service tray. Take the mineral water off the tray.

After I helped Gammie, she took off! Why did I go through all this?
Gammie left behind a lot of excess cellulite. This can be useful. Go to the
beach and click your hand on the sand to find a whale oil lamp. Click the lamp
on the drainage faucet in the center of the Cellulite Drainage room. Get a
match in the Blues Bar and click your zipper on it to light it. Light the lamp,
and you'll find you've created a Lamp of Knowledge. Pretty neat, huh?

Rose

Where is Rose?
Walk one screen left of the Front Desk. Open the hallway door to enter the
Health Spa. Rose is in the High Colonic Treatment room through the door on the
left.

What does Rose want?
Look around the High Colonic Treatment room. You'll see lots of flowers. Rose
loves flowers. You need to get some more flowers for Rose. The only flowers you
can take are in your room. If you don't have your room key, talk to the front
desk girl to get it. Get the flowers from the vase in your room and give them
to Rose. She'll give you an orchid for all your troubles.

Burgundy

Where is Burgundy?
Burgundy sometimes sings at the bar. If you go to the bar and Burgundy isn't on
stage, try walking out of the bar for a little while and come back later.

How can I talk to Burgundy?
You need to unplug her microphone so she'll stop singing and listen to you. Put
your hand on the microphone wire to unplug it.

Where can I find some beer?
The Spa will not serve alcohol, but you can find a place that has beer. Go to
the Mud Baths and walk right. Walk through the Weight Room to enter the
Aerobics Room. Use the empty spot to dance and end the class. Talk to the
aerobics instructor and get her employee badge. Go back to the hall and walk
east until you reach the gate to the employee's campground. Use the employee
badge to open the gate. Enter the tent and take some beer for Burgundy.

The beer didn't help. Burgundy is singing again. What now?
She wants more beer! Go back to the employee's campground and get more for her.
After she drinks the second six-pack, she'll meet you in the sauna.

Where can I get a towel to wear in the sauna?
You can get a towel in two different places. You can take a towel from the
maid's cart that appears every now and then outside your room. You can also get
one from Gary the Towel Attendant in the Health Spa. To get the towel from
Gary, click your hand on the desk to sign in.

How do I put the towel on?
Go to the men's locker room. Open the last locker on the lower right. Click the
towel on yourself to wear it. To change back into your leisure suit, open the
locker and click the towel on yourself again.

Burgundy and Cav left without me. What do I do?
Burgundy left her silver bracelet in the sauna. Take it.

Shablee

Where can I find Shablee?
Shablee is in the Make-Up Classroom. The classroom is two screens left from the
Front Desk. Go down the ramp. Shablee is the girl in the lower right of the
screen.

What does Shablee want?
Shablee wants an evening gown.

Where can I find an evening gown?
Burgundy the Country Western Blues singer has a gown. If you've gone to the
sauna with her, you can find the dress back-stage at the bar. Click your hand
on the curtain to walk on stage. Walk south of the stage between the curtains
to find the dress. Take the dress and give it to Shablee.

Shablee says she'll meet me later on the beach, but later never happens!
You need to get a condom. Get your room key from the girl at the front desk and
go upstairs to your room. Look at the cards on the table. Call the Turn Down
service at 75 to order a surprise. Leave your room and go downstairs. When you
return to your room, a condom will be left on your bed. Take the condom, and

top of a maze to the bottom. Oh yeah, there are Fire Pits From Hell (TM),

This cheat will allow you to select any level for any tribe. Go to each
corner of the menu screen and press <LEFT MOUSE> (or <BOTH MOUSE>)
each time until you hear a lemming faintly squel "Let's Go". You should
hear this at each point of pressing.. Now you can select any level on any
tribe and have 60 lemmings on each, which means that you only have to
complete the last level of each tribe to complete the game.

If you hang on to the data crystal after the first mission, you can use it to
find other captives on the other missions without hunting for clues.

To duplicate any item as many times as you want do the following:

First find a power point and stand in front of it. Then select any item
from a droid's backpack and drop it on to the floor so that the name of it
appears in the text window. Now pick up the same object and return it to
the droid's backpack and engage the poser point so the lightning bolts are
touching you. Use the look right, look left command to move the view screen
so that it is at an angle. Move the cursor to the bottom of the screen and
hold down the right mouse button so that the cursor becomes a hand and left
click, at which point an object should appear on the floor and you can drop
as many objects as you wish. Look back to the normal view and when the power
bolts stop you can pick up the objects that you dropped.

On mission one, just before you rescue the first captive, save the game.
Now, as soon as you have rescued him and moved on to mission 2, reload the
game and rescue him again. Now, when you finish the level you`ll be on
level three. Redo this until you are on the level you desire.

First a little hint: The green diamonds are essential as these award you

bats but this is more of a hinderence as the two bats prove confusing.

Whenever you see a ***STORY*** that means to pay extra attention to story
to get the important 4 threads. It is easy to get the 4 threads by lookin
at the colors that the distaff releases during the sounds. It is a good
idea to save your game before you see these stories in case you couldn't
catch it the first time. Also, you have to case reverse of a spell.
Example: If the OPEN spell is "ECED" you would use "DECE" in order to get
the reverse effect.

Yoshitsune is more skilled at fighting than yoritomo, so at the start of
the game make sure you have almost full strength and men before you try
attacking anything. Your main objective now, because you are near
maximum status, is to deal with your brother and to capture enemy castles.
If you take over enemy castles, the enemy troops will have nowhere to
recruit more men and all your brother's men and land is yours if he dies.
Your next job is to try and secure the eastern half of the island. To do
this, take over all the castles and destroy or recruit all the armies on
that side of the island. Now concentrate on the rest of the island. In
Edo try to leave a general with the least siege abilities as he probably
won't need to siege castles anymore. Remember one general will do and
if the general is at Edo, Nagoya will be easier to storm by boat. If
you can send a general from Akita to Matsue via Aikawa you will have a
good base from which you attack the western catles.

Once you have complete control over the main island then you should be
able to wipe out the remaining four castles on the 2 smaller islands.
Don't go for these unless you have a very firm base otherwise you will
have to trek all the way back should a range trooper take over the
castle.

Yoritomo

A great politician and strategist but try to take Edo first because it's
the only castle you won't have to lay siege to take. If you're lucky
though, you may reach Toyama or Nigata before anyone else. The same
rules apply to yoritomo as with yoshitsune: wait until you nearly have
a full army before attacking. Be careful if you get into any fights,
because you have a low battle skill and a smaller army with a higher
skill can easily wipe you out. At the begining of the game try to avoid
taking risks and instead concentrate on improving your skills. If you
ever fight your brother and survive long enough, chase him on horseback,
because if you slay him things can change drmatically.

Overall...

Participate in battles as you tend to lose more men if you don't.
Chasing the general on horseback often leads to early victory as you can
wipe out armies in one battle instead of at the end of the game, and once
you're confident it's possible to do it every time: but do not engage in
the siege sequence, because losing can be costly. The most important
factor in battle is strength and long jorneys can weary your troops, so
ensure they have plenty of rest before a battle. An army coming by sea
will be tired but faster and more flexible, so meet them on the shore
and the advantage will be with your men.

Whichever character you've chosen, try to isolate the rest of the island
so you're more able to concentrate on attacking the enemy and won't have
to worry about defensive manoeuveres and precautions: but watch out for
the enemy trying to out-flank you. The islands will all be bitterly
fought over, so ensure that your troops have confident stength before
attacking. The islands are well worth going for though, because they
are ideal resting places for a tired force and good generals can inter-
change their armies from island to mainland without meeting to many
problems.

The key to early victory is to recruit many more armies than your enemy,
thus trapping him in a spiders web and gradually wearing him down (of
course he can always try the same tactic on you, so beware). It's
important to have a strong hold on north and south Japan, as a rogue
force can wreck havoc and open up flanks, causing all sorts of problems.
If you're unsure of your force, avoid battles because he who fights and
runs away really does live to fight another day. Ninja assassins may
sound appealing, but only resort to them as a last resort and don't send
them too hard a mission because they might turn back and recognise you
as the enemy.

Keeping up your men's strength and morale is vital. Giving your men
50 minutes' rest a night, or during the day when it's too dark to
carry on, will slam your energy and morale levels to max. Even if
you don't have much food, you don't have to worry, as your men will
not eat it.
On reaching the first village (the first white cross on the map),
search the area to find a hole in the ground where the villagers
appear to be hiding. You then have two options: ENTER TUNNEL or
USE GRENADES. Gomez is useful at this point, but if he is dead, go
for the USE GRENADES option.
Start off questioning the villagers normally by aking them "Where
VC?" Once you have an answer, start the hard questioning, or a
village boy will get hold of a gun and shoot one of your men...

Solution:

1)
This level is the introductory level. This level introduced you to the
capabilities of each character. First you will start out with Erik. Erik
needs to jump across the electrical field, climb up the ladder and go
right to the exit. Now switch to Olaf. Have Olaf Jump down the ledge.
Make sure his shield is down so that it will block the laser fire. Now
have Olaf descend the ladder, and go right to the exit. Now switch to
Baleog. Have Baleog go through the striped door. On the other side of the
striped door there will be an alien with 3 eyes. Have Baleog shoot an
arrow at this alien to kill it. After he kills the alien, have him go down
the ladder and right to the exit.

2)
Have Erik go get Tamator, check the hints, go right through the striped
doors, and jump over alien (if needed). Then go all the way to the right
to the elevator and wait. Switch to Baleog, have him go right through the
striped door and up the first ladder. Have Baleog press the button to
disable the laser shields to get Tamator and talk to Aftiek. Now have him
go down the ladder, than right to the next ladder, then up the ladder,
kill the alien with the arrow, press the button to disable the laser
shields and get two bombs. After, go down the ladder and go right. Have
Baleog kill the alien and go all the way to the right on the elevator
with Erik. Switch to Olaf and have him go all the way to the right to join
the other two on the elevator. Operate the elevator so that it goes down
to the bottom. Now switch to Baleog and have him shoot an arrow to depress
the button which disables the laser shields. Have Baleog go left to the
computer and have him drop a bomb in front of the computer and run away
to the right. The bomb will destroy the ship's computer. Go left to talk to
Aftiek and get some food. Have him go back to the elevator and operate the
elevator up to the level above them. Move all the characters left and down
the ladder to the anti-gravity field. Have any character operate the
switch to activate the field and move all the characters into the field.
The characters will float up to top. Quickly, switch to Baleog so that he
can destroy the alien at the top. Switch to Olaf with his shield down and
go all the way to the left so that he blocks the laser fire for Baleog
and Erik. Have the other two characters go left, down ladder but not all
the way to the bottom. Switch to Olaf and have him go right and down the
ladder and at the bottom face right to block the laser fire once again.
Now move other characters down the ladder, and go left and kill the alien
with Baleog. Go down ladder and right to exit. Switch to Olaf and have
him go left, down the ladder and right to the exit. Switch to Olaf and
have him go to the left, down the ladder and right to join the two at the
exit.

3)
Move all characters to elevator and go down. At the bottom switch to Erik
and have him bash the wall to the right. Move all characters to the
right. Switch to Baleog, have him shoot an arrow at the button to disable
the laser shield. Once the shield is disabled, move all the characters
right to the teleporter. Teleport all characters. Once teleported, switch
to Olaf. Put his shield up and have him go right in order to glide down
to the right to get the red key. Get into teleporter and teleport up to
use the red key in the red keyhole. Once the door is opened, move all the
characters left and up to the laser shield. Switch to Baleog so that he
can shoot an arrow at the button to disable the shield. Once done, move
all characters left to the wall and have Erik bash the wall so that the
characters can go left to the elevator. Go down the elevator and at bottom
operate Olaf. Put his shield up and stand next to the first platform.
Operate Erik and have him jump on Olaf's shield and up the platforms to
get the yellow key and the smart bomb. Once done have Erik go down to use
the yellow key on the yellow keyhole. Switch to Olaf and put his shield
down until he meets up with Robot. The strategy here is to have all three
robots on the screen. Once all 3 robots are on the screen, switch to Erik
and operate the smart bomb to destroy all 3 robots. Once all the robots
are destroyed, move all the characters up the ladder and left to the exit.

4)
Operate Erik and have him jump over onto the left platform, move down the
ladder, right, then jump over the spinning spikes and stop at the
elevator. Have Erik go up the elevator and as it is going up, have him
jump right onto the ledge so that he can press the button to disable
laser shield up above. Switch to other two characters and have them go
right, down ladder, at bottom, kill aliens, right, up ladder right and
down the elevator. At bottom switch to Olaf, with shield down, move him
right until he gets to the spinning spikes. Switch to Erik and have him
jump over spinning spikes to the other side to get the yellow key. Once
Erik has the yellow key have him jump left and up ladder. Move all

Erik bash the wall and move characters all the way to the bottom. At the
bottom, destroy the monsters to the right and use Erik to bash wall at
right to destroy monsters and obtain food. Now move characters right
until they reach rising bubbles and lava. At the lava you need to walk
each character one at a time, into the bubbles so that the bubbles will

full of slime with bubbles floating up. Each character, one at a time,
needs to cross the slime lake by jumping the bubbles. Once on the other
side, move characters up the ladder. Switch control to Olaf and have him
put his shield up. Now switch to Erik and have him jump onto Olaf's
shield so that he can jump up onto the ledge above to get the red key that

When you've been given the flask from nellie, drink it and then go and see
the blacksmith. Give the flask to Luthern and he'll empty it for you. Now
go to the market place and give the lock pick to Ratpouch and Save the
game. Look at the door, you'll see a lock, tell Ratpouch to use his
lockpick on it. Look at apparatus, use the oil burner with the thunderbox
and the flask on the tap (On the far right.) Go to middle street and drink
the flask, enter the door and talk to skoris and you'll set the girl free.

Solution:
PULL TORCH, and move closer to the door, so when the guard goes in, you
leave immeditely. When you leave..
CLOSE DOOR and then LOCK DOOR, so that asshole won't hurt you.
TALK TO PRISONER, and he'll ask you for water, go to GUARD ROOM,
GET KNIFE, GET BOTTLE, LOOK AT BARREL, USE TAP ON BOTTLE, USE KNIFE ON SACK
LOOK AT SACK, and then go right to TORTURE ROOM, you'll see the guy...
USE KNIFE ON LEATHER CORD, it's fixed to his feet... From now on he'll
follow you wherever you go. Go back to THE OUTER CELL, and GIVE BOTTLE
TO PRISONER, he'll tell you 'bout the way of escape.
TELL RATPOUCH TO PUSH BRICKS, when he leaves go after him...

You are now in the SEWER OUTLET.. <some village map will help ya>
Go to THE FORGE, GET TINDERBOX <on the floor>, TALK TO LUTHERN, leave and
go to SEVERED ARMS, TALK TO EILEAIN, leave and talk to MALLIN <the guy
in green clothes>, he'll give you METAL BAR, go with it to VILLAGE SHOP, and
GIVE IT TO EWAN, he'll give you some money and GEM. Go to MAGPIE TAVERN,
TALK TO MARKUS, BRIBE MARKUS, TALK TO MARKUS once again, then TALK TO MALLIN,
go to THE FORGE, TALK TO LUTHERN, go back to MAGPIE COURTYARD and TALK TO
GRUB, the guy lying on the ground. Ask him 'bout the BLACK GOAT. Now
TALK TO LUTHERN, <again, shhh>, go to SEVERED ARMS and TALK TO EILEAIN,
she'll give you the DIARY, EXAMIN DIARY, go back to MAGPIE TAWERN and
GIVE GEM TO NELLIE. She'll give you a FLASK. DRINK FLASK..
See blacksmith, GIVE FLASK TO LUTHERN, so he'll empty it for you. Nice going.
Now go to MARKET PLACE, GIVE LOCKPICK TO RATPOUCH... And at this moment
you should save the game, because you don't know what will happen next..
LOOK AT DOOR, you'll see a lock. TELL RATPOUCH TO USE LOCKPICK ON LOCK.

Now you're in the TAIDGH'S HOUSE...
LOOK AT APARATUS, USE OIL BURNER WITH TINDERBOX, USE FLASK ON TAP <it's on
the very right side of the APARATUS>..
Go to MIDDLE STREET, and DRINK FLASK.. <Wow, what a cute bitch!>
Enter THE DOOR, and TALK TO SKORLS.. You'll set the girl free..
Now you can go and talk to anyone you want, there are many funny situations,
so check'em out, you should talk to Skorls, Luthern, Gwyn, Eilaine, Ultar,
Morkus, Gereint and Grub.. <BUT!! You can't go to the CASTLE WALL, coz
you'll lose the magic..>
When you got bored, walk to CASTLE WALL, so you'll turn to DIERMOT again.
Now... TALK TO GOEWNIE, you can find her in APOTHECARY WORKSHOP.
Go to BLACKFRIARS ROW and LOOK AT NOTE. Find MALLIN and TALK TO him.
He'll give you a book, now go to MONKS LODGE and TALK TO TOBY. GIVE BOOK
TO TOBY, he'll tell you how to fight SELENA.. Remeber the INGREDIENTS he'll
tell you. Now leave and go to APTH WORKSHOP. TALK TO GOEWIN, tell her it's
for a dragon, but she won't have COWBANE, leave... And now you have two
ways to do it. You can go and find COWBANE yourself, or TELL RATPOUCH TO
GO TO THE FORGE, AND THEN ASK CATRIONE FOR COWBANE, AND THEN GO TO SMITHY
STREET AND THEN GET COWBANE, FINISH. He'll be back so ASK RATPOUCH FOR
COWBANE, now you got it, so GIVE COWBANE TO GOEWIN. TALK TO GOEWIN, so she'll
give you the potion. Now TALK TO GOEWIN again, leave and go to SEVERED ARMS,
TALK TO ULTAR, go to WEREGATE, TALK TO GORGOYLES, go to APTH WORKSHOP and
TALK TO GOEWIN, she'll meet you at the gate.. TALK TO GOEWIN. Go inside and
play around with the skulls, you can TELL her to PULL or PUSH skulls.
You'll get to the room with no skulls so save the game before you go ahead..
Now fight to that asshole, hope you beat him up... The trick is to point your
mouse on DIERMOT and then.. You'll figure it out after few times..
Well, you'll see the monster.. USE POTION ON DRAGON, and then TALK TO DRAGON,
commend him to help you, so you'll get an eye.. Now let him sleep, leave the
caves...

TALK TO GOEWIN.. Go to THE FORGE and TALK TO LUTHERN, then TALK TO
MELLIN, he'll tell you about the SKORL.. Go to the MARKET PLACE and when you
see Skorl going to VILLAGE SHOP, LOOK THROUGH THE WINDOW, you'll hear the
conversation, Skorl leaves then, TALK TO SKORL, he'll tell you about the
barrel, go to VILLAGE SHOP, TALK TO EWAN...

So now, Skorl will take you to THE CASTLE..
LOOK AT CASK, the one in the left corner, so you'll see the BUNG.. Now go
to THE KITCHEN, GET TONGS, LOOK AT CARCASS, GET FAT, now TALK TO MINNOW, tell
him you've come for Selena, TALK TO him once again, and ask him to tell
his master that someone is in the WINE CELLAR. As soon as he leaves, go to
the left USE TONGS ON BUNG, and hide yourself in the very right corner of the
room. Skorl comes in and sees the wine... Now go left to THE GATE ROOM and
USE FAT ON LEVER, TELL MINNOW TO OPERATE LEVER, while he does it, PULL WINCH.
The gate will open.. Now go back, and make sure to save the game <AGAIN>,
because you may have some problems on the bridge.. After you pass him, head
to the left so you'll see Selena.. Now you can fuck her and have many kids..
