While playing, type in "SCHLIKA", then pressing <F2> will finish the
level for you. Apparently, if you pause the game, you can still move
the crosshair around, so try this as well!

* Shoot as many of the buildings as you can, as they block your shots at
  attacking / hiding enemies.
* Shoot the enemies at the bottom of the screen as the bullets they fire
  needless time to get to you and can often trap you in a corner.
* Don't forget that you can shoot the enemies' bullets!
* Try to pick up the bonuses straight away. The 100, 200 and 300 point
  bonuses are very useful if you want extra lives.
* Collect special weapons straight away as their rapid fire removes
  buildings faster, giving more breathing space.
* The grey uniformed soldiers (the ones that take a few shots to kill) can
  give a grenade or a special weapon. When he does, two men carrying a
  stretcher will appear. Shoot these and they will give you two grenades,
  collect them and then shoot them again before they go, to receive two
  more grenades.
* Never stay in corners for too long, the enemy has a habit of zeroing in
  on you.
* Don't waste grenades on buildings unless you really need to. If you opt
  to shoot in small bursts at every building rather than concentrating on
  one building at a time then a grenade may finish the job a lot quicker.
* Try not to get killed when the end-level guardians appear otherwise your
  FOE meter will drop to zero and you'll have to start again.

To get the second key, go to the guards on level four. Ignore the levers
until you have the guard key from the north passage, the candle and the
shuriken (in the pillow). Open the wall above the bed to get the second
key.

If you find yourself with light tanks facing up to much heavier opposition
on the simulator, use your speed and ram the enemy. Then fully depress
your gun and open fire, it only takes a few rounds to obliterate your
enemy (easier from side or rear).

Click on the LOAD icon and press and hold both Mouse Buttons for 5 seconds
(and then release), a screen will appear offering you a HARDMAN option and
Level Section.

Go to the save game option, then the game requests a name type "JOOLS".
Cheat mode active will flash at the bottom of the screen and the ranks
and abilities of your men will have increased. It may be "JOOLSA".

Hints:
1)In Choppas, land on the enemy to kill them, safer than landing and
getting out.

2)In missions, where you have control of a lot of troopers seperate the
lowest ranking trooper from the rest and give him all the weapons, make
sure the rest are safe, then attempt the mission with one trooper. If the
trooper dies just press <ESC>. This saves a lot of troopers later, such as
in mission 18 phase 5 of 5 - The Door.

3)Troopers are able to throw grenades quite along way and over walls,
trees, and buildings. Use this to your advantage to protect against
Biggunz and Jeeps. To throw a grenade a long way, simply position the
pointer further than needed.

4)Buildings can be destroyed even if you can't see them. For instance, if
a trooper is in Biggun and there is a building slightly off the edge of
the screen, roughly aim at the building making sure the pointer is at the
very edge of the screen and fire.

5)Learn to control Jeeps and Skidooz early on (how to skid them). In later
levels you may need good control to hit ramps at correct angles otherwise
you can blow up if you hit walls. This is also useful to get away from
shells, rockets, and grenades.

6)An effective way of destroying snipers is to just run straight towards
them and shoot you guns. Don't waste grenades on them unless it is
necessary.

Here is some information on where the Supa Dupa range of weapons can be
found. There is only one of each Supa Dupa product, so they're spread out
across the game from mission eight onwards:

Missile - Mission 8, Phase 3:
Go to the bottom right corner of the screen and it's hidden behind a big
bush.

Bullet-Proofa Vest - Mission 12, Phase 4:
After yov've blown up the turrets and boarded the helicopter fly, to the
top right corner of the screen. The vest is hidden in the fat snowman.

Rank - Mission 16, Phase 2:
Top left corner of the screen. It isn't hidden and it looks like a sign
for a general (four stars).

Troopa - Mission 20, Phase 1:
This is a big yellow S in the middle of the screen on quite an easy
level. It's still worth getting since it improves your rank until you die
and it gives you a Bullet-Proofa Vest, Missile and Rank Boostas for the
phase. Watch out when you pick it up though, because there is a spike
nearby.

Troopa - Mission 22, Phase 2:
It's in the bottom right corner of the screen and is guarded by a turret.
It's best to blow up the helicopter with grenades to start with, then
rocket the turret before getting the Troopa Boosta.

To find a special bonus, go to the front of the Post Office. Shoot the
ball at the top of the flag pole, and your score will raise. If you
shoot it again, you'll see a screen of programmers. Shoot it again and
you'll be invincible, standing in the bank. At the end of that round,
you will start at the beginning with warp speed.

When you encounter a particularly friendly alien, ask it the following
question using the alien icons: CODE GG1. The alien will then give you
the coordinates of another alien called GG. Go to the specified planet
and you can ask GG for the coordinates of all the other aliens around
by asking CODE INFORMATION HELP. If your met with blind ignorance then
put in the name of the alien after the HELP or replace HELP with name of

For this cheat you will need a copy of CAPTIVE. Load the game as per
usual. On the level selection screen, insert your Captive disc. Press
Fire and the screen will say "Disk Error". Now replace your Captain
Planet disc and the cheat will be active.

When you have completed the Fire level, get killed on the Water level.
Enter you high score name as "BBBB" and you should be able to start with
infinite continues.

Run through the game as normal until you get to the level selection page.
Now type in "go planet". Now, when the game starts hit <F10> and <RETURN>
together, and you should be taken back to the level selection page, where
you can choose any level.

When you land go and pick up the message from Ratt on Butre, then return
to the Swan and then land again. There will be another message from
Ratt. Pick this up as well. Repeat this 88 times (!) and put all the
messages in the backpacks, and when they are full, carry them in the
hands and one on the cursor, enter a base and find a shop. You can sell
all the messages and get about 18,500 credits.

The passwords in capital letters are the codes for the computers to obtain
the planet probes. The combination  definitions are

You have to fly your spaceship, the swan, to the planet BUTRE, (co-
ordinates 008w-072n). While you are on the way place the chips in the
droids head. You now have to assign them a name. The chip is in the
backpack of each droid. Once this is done you will aquire the ability
to punch, which is the first means, for the time being, of attacking.
Once you are orbiting, zoom in on the white dot and click on it. Your
craft will land. Wander around till you find the green door. A message
from Ratt is at the door with a code on it. This will let you in once
you correctly execute it. Once inside pick up the explosives and another
message. Go to the end of the passage and click the right mouse button
on the forward icon. The wall will move forward, most likely you will
encounter your first base aliens. You must explore the whole base by open
every cupboard and door. I've included a map on this disk to help you
find your way. Pick up all sacks of gold whenever you destroy an enemy.
As you gain experience trade-em on attributes. Before you can get out of
the base you have to do two things. Find the professor and kill him for
the password for the computer so as you can get the planet probe (from
the computer). Then you must find the generators and destroy them by
throwing the explosives in the top of them. Once this is done you must
exit from the base before it blows up. When you are back in orbit place
the planet probe in the map and it will head of to the next planet
showing you the way.

During your quest you will use some plug in devices. He is a run down on
what they are:

OPTICS
BASIC	An AG Scan which displays how much damage you are inflicting on
	your opponent during combat.
2	This is the route finder. Essential for finding your way out of
	the base after you have destroyed the generators. It will also
	guide you to the base entrance when you land.
3	The mapper gives you a map of the area you have covered. Shops are
	shown in red, white ladders and holes in green, doors in yellow.
4	Radar.
5	Magna scan guides you straight to the generators.
6	Body scan gives you a quick referance to your condition of your
	droids.
7	The Vision corrector allows you to see where false walls are.
SUPER	Visor is a in-fra red night vision enables you to see in the dark.

DEV-SCAPES
BASIC	Anti-Grav device enables you to walk on ceilings. Handy for
	flooded areas and shooting high floating enemies.
2	Shield, cuts down the amount of damage done to you by enemies.
3	Fire shield cuts down the amount of damage fireballs do to you.
4	Greaser allows you to run faster.
5	Power sapper drains all the power from your droids. Forget this one.
6	Fixer will fix any part of your droids that are on 0%. Will not
	give you a full repair.
7	Recharger reharges the droids.
SUPER	Deflector will deflect any enemy fire, however they drain very
	quickly and are expensive.

Try pressing <CTRL> <M> on the main screen for some interesting effects.

HINT: Try always to cut of the path to the homebase (top right island)	of
the enemy ship. It might get stuck without fuel and so buys you lot of time
to conquer a lot of islands.

Before starting or in Pause mode type "GROW OLD ALONG WITH ME" (with spaces).
You should now see the message {CHEAT MODE ACTIVE}.
Pressing <+> on the numeric keypad protects your mantas and aavs from
missile attacks. <-> can be used to turn this off.

Pressing the following keys in sequence: <HELP> <Q> <S> <CTRL> <ALT>,
gives you a little message. Pressing the <9> on the keypad displays the
current level. <6> and <8> have some other effect. Returning to the title
screen, press the <+> and <-> keys to view all objects in the game.

In-game, pause and type "THE BEST IS YET TO BE" (with spaces). The game
restarts automatically, and displays 'Cheat mode activated' in the message

attack, although collision with large objects is still fatal. Once a course
has been programmed for the carrier, Mantas or Walruses, engage autopilot
and click on pause. To avoid sloggin around inreal type, you will find that
pressing 3 on the keypad and unpausing again takes the corresponding craft
directly to its destination. Likewise, pausing and pressing 2 replaces lost
shielding, while tapping 1 refuels the craft in question. 9 shows the
current difficulty level, 7 speeds up the game and 6 brings up the
programmers' test palette!

Instead of reinforcing your supply lines, go straight for the
enemies home island, Nemesis, as it freezes the enemy supply line and
disables the enemy carrier.

Start the action game and set a course for Isolus (just east of
Thermopylae). Stay just out of range for approximately 10 minutes. As soon
as the message "Isolus is now an enemy island appears, launch a manta and
fly toward the north side of the island. The enemy carrier will be directly
ahead of you.

While in the Walrus arming section, select nine Harbanger surface to
surface missiles and put them in the AAV. Select the Avatar Chemical
Laser and place it over the missiles. Then select the pod you want
(ACCB, Virus Bomb,Fuel) and place it in the AAv. Then when you have
launched the AAv look at it's weapons and you will find you have BOTH
missiles and laser! On returning to the carrier any missiles you have
left will be added to the ship's stores. Carry on doing this and
hundreds of missiles can be yours.

A few notes:
- Any * following the object means that the object is a treasure. All of them
  would give you bonus 5 points if deposited at the town hall. Some of them
  could be used for other purposed. Unless described, they are just treasures
- If the items you carry are already full, you might then deposit all
  treasures in the town hall

. Seashore: Search from north end to south end of sea shore. You would find
	    a heavy ball and a rod.
. Village: Exits are possible in all direction. Get waterpump, string,
	   sickle and document from locations around it.
	   Town hall where you deposit your treasure (for full credit) is
	   located northwest from this village square
. The churchyard is south of the village. In one of the yard there is a
  freshly dug grave and a human skull. Get the skull
. Go seashore, tie string to rod, fish. get coral*
. Go to bridge, west to oak tree, climb tree. With the sickle, cut the
  mistletoe. Down and get the mistletoe
. Go forest, explore until you come up to the witch's camp. Get the broom.
  Fly, south, south and there is a large circle. If you have the mistletoe
  with you, you could pass the wraith there. Get the emerald*, back to
  the arrival point, fly back.
. Go to church's tower, ring the bell. Go to sea, wait until a huge monster
  come. Follow it. The monster will go up the river, to the churchyard
  (south of the freshly dug grave) and then bite the tower's bell and tear
  up the tower's side revealing a downward passage. In there you would find
  a Nordic idol*

. Get document, go castle. (The document is the pass)
. Scattered in castle first level are: gold cross*, two yarns (one is in
  linen storage and the other is in servant room), book, rug*, statue* and
  oil lantern (your only light source)
  Two events might happen here:
  If you newly entered the castle, a young page came and offered a sword.
  Take it to defend yourself against the fighters in the castle.
  Sometime, a seaman come and steal your treasure. Let him do it. You won't
  lose it. After all, this is the only way you could get his only treasure.
. There is a large bulge behind a curtain in one of the room in first level
  castle. Kill the bulge (A sort of thief is behind it), get the crown*.
  You could bury the dead body in the churchyard's grave to get additional
  treasure: jewel trinket*
. Scullery (south of kitchen): Go down the staircase. If you explore
  the maze there, you would find a nordic pin* and an antique key (in wine
  cellar)
. A fountain west outside of castle: Empty it with the waterpump.
  Get the coin*
. Queen's chamber: give yarn to queen and she would allow you to go to
  her bedroom. Get diamond* there
. Tower: Give a young and pretty girl the book to calm her. You could then go
  south. Get an oil painting* from there
. Ghost room: give crown* to ghost (That's what he wants). To pass the barred
  door, load cannon with the iron ball, turn cannon and fire the cannon.
  Pass the shattered door, get ruby*. The scholar? I don't know yet.
. King's chamber: Turn the bust (The bookcase slides away revealing a passage)
  In there, you would find an ornate clock* and prince chamber
. Prince chamber: Give the skull to him. In east door, there is a vase*. In
  north door (unlock it first), there is a necklace*
. Room with three levers: Pull iron lever, north and get the jade*, pull the
  bronze lever (A trapdoor open), break door, and find your way to the sea
  shore. Now climb up the cliff, take the south trail and follow it until
  you come to the smuggler's cave. Enter the cave. In there you would find
  all your stolen treasures. In addition, you would find the pirate's
  treasure, a jewel chest*. 1602 would bring you back to the castle (A short-
  cut)
. The cat: If you have the emerald* and ruby* (They are the size of eye),
  give them to it. The cat would give you back an ancient mouse*

Once you completed collected all treasures, you had a very little time to
reach the townhall and deposit all your treasures there before you are
transported to an astral plane. Find your way here and upon encountering
an engraving letter 'OTTFFS???' on a surface, respond with 'ENT' (One Two
Three Four Five Six Seven Eight Nine Ten). A door to south appears. Enter it.
Put the sword on the altar (A sword picture is on the altar). Exit. Now,
everything is changed. There is a riddle here. The answer is moon. North,
and strive yourself to east to meet the lady of moon.

Once you have started up the game press <SHIFT>, <L> and <RIGHT MOUSE> about
25 times, until you hear a noise. Look forward and you will see four
coloured boxes. Shoot them for infinite lives, all ten keys, the ending,
rock travel.

The key on the chapel roof can be a swine to get hold of if you don't
know how to get up there. All you have to do is stand on the drawbridge
and close it. You will then be lifted up, making it a doddle to get
hold of the prize.

When trying to collect the pentacles in the caverns, fall down one of
the trap doors and kill the spirit. Collect the first pentacle then go
to the other caverns collecting the pentacles and killing the spirits.
This will make the going easier if you fall into a cavern, since you're
saved the hassle of tackling a spirit that catches you unawares.

To get inside the display chamber, crawl inside the granary chest and
close the lid. Access is then as easy as falling off a rather wobbly
chair perched precariously perched on the top of a table.

Collecting the pentacle in the junk room isn't as obvious as it seems.
When you enter the room, crouch down, walk over the first shelf and into
the wall and stand up. Now do a U-turn and walk forward to collect the
item.

To move the big rock or open the pottery door, you need to have maximum
strength. If you haven't then fiund some food to top up your energy then
try again.

If you have the rock travel potion, you can get to the gymnasium either
from the Wizard's hut or from directly outside. If you're having trouble
finding the spirit in the dungeon, then try looking for something else
rather than the obvious. Still stuck?  Well try that rat-like animal at
the back of the room...

Now for the big baddy himself. To kill Magister, the evil owner of the
castle, wipe out all the other spirits first. Now go to his room and
blast him in the forehead to destroy him.

Note -
 do not do this until you have the key from the wizard's hut and have
 entered the catacombs from under the large rock, and then under
 the rug in the wizard's hut.

* Lifting weights in the gymnasium increases your health.
* Standing in hospital cures you up to normal health.
* The spirit in the courtyard will only appear when a rock is thrown at
  the flag.
* To enter the junk room, fire at the plate (on the left of the door),
  until it disappears, enabling the door to be opened.
* To kill the dragon, shoot eyes, teeth and horns, until they disappear.
* To kill the Magister, shoot at his head (not eyes).
* To confront the dragon, start on level 4 in the SW tower. Enter onto
  the ballroom balcony, there is a break next to the last door, drop
  down, and commence along the south passage.
* To find the Magister, go to the SE tower and press the button in the
  king's solar on level 4. Then reach across the second barrier in the
  corridor, and activate the crank. Go round to the south passage (the
  long way) and you will be able to enter the Magister's room.
* A final piece of treasure appears on the table in the wizard's hut
  after the key has been collected from the chapel roof. Use rock travel
  to transport yourself from window in the gymnasium to the wizard's hut,
  then collect treasure and transport back.

1. Use <RIGHT MOUSE> to speed up the clock while waiting for an event
to occur. This works in both the Strategic and Tactical modes.

2. Defending military forces are always approximately one-half
the size of a player's total military force. The number of soldiers
that a territory can muster in its defense, in other words, is
based on the total size of the army owned by the controlling player.
To be precise, the number of each type of unit is equal to one-half
of the number of such units in the player's army, rounding up.
For example, a player with three infantry and five archers would
defend with two infantry and three archers.

The defender still has an edge, however. The strength of each
individual defensive unit is adjusted upward slightly to account
for the defender's superior knowledge of the terrain. The defender
also gets to choose where the battle will be fought. This offers
a significant advantage to the clever player. Finally, the attacker
will have a very difficult time winning unless the odds are greater
than 2:1 in its favor (this includes morale, which is not immediately
measurable, just as in real life).

The battle system works both ways: when you are attacked, you
defend with half of your forces. If you lose the battle, you may
then launch a retaliatory attack on the other player, who will
defend with half of whatever forces remain after the first attack.
Also, remember that every unit lost to either player removes one
unit of that type from the player's forces. However, since the
defender only fields an army half the size of its total force,
it can never be wiped out in a single battle. The attacker, however,
can be completely eliminated by a solid defender. A counterattack
after such a rout is usually devastating to the once-proud aggressor.

The intent of this design is to encourage back-and-forth skirmishing.
It also places the greatest risk of loss on the player who has
the most to gain -- the attacker. This design applies to both
the computer players and the human players; they abide by exactly
the same rules. This includes the rule which provides at least
one Infantry and one Archer to a player with no military forces.
We assume that any territory -- human or computer -- is capable
of offering some defense to an attacker, however meager.

3. Your army's morale is based on the Happiness of your people.
Battles may be won and lost solely on morale. It has a very strong
effect on the outcome. Be sure to keep your Happiness at least
as high as that of your neighbors.

Artificial Intelligence

CASTLES II employs two sophisticated, multi-level artificial intelligence
engines for the computer players -- one for Strategic mode, another
for Tactical mode. Only the Strategic AI is discussed in this
analysis.

The Strategic AI consists of medium-level and high-level portions.
Actions are initiated through the same task mechanism used by
the human players. In fact, the AI players were tested by letting
one of them run the game in place of the human, even displaying
results on the same user interface.

CASTLES II was exhaustively playtested for six months. Every aspect
of the gameplay was critiqued and fine-tuned. This was an especially
complex task for the artificial intelligence routines. Many of
the AI algorithms were rewritten several times until they became
satisfyingly realistic. Fortunately, the computer players use
the same tasks as the humans. The tuning factors were based on
empirical adjustments derived from actual human playtesters. The
result is a series of opponents who play at a level equivalent
to that of an expert human player. The Easy and Impossible difficulty
levels in the game were created by adjusting delicately more than
a dozen factors in the playing style of each opponent.

The medium-level AI maintains appropriate levels of commodities
and military forces, and ensures the safety and security of the
kingdom. It issues Gather and Recruit tasks whenever it decides
to increase the level of a commodity or increase its military
strength. The medium-level AI can send Merchants (this is a good
way to find out if a computer player is experiencing a shortage
of a given resource, by the way). The medium-level AI also starts
a Happiness task when the peoples' morale drops, sends Scouts
to neighboring territories, and Polices the realm if it is being
Sabotaged or Spied upon.

The medium-level AI does not think very often. During playtesting,
this AI was found to be extremely agile in its response to changing
conditions in the game -- far more agile, in fact, than any reasonable
human opponent. The frequency of its thinking was reduced to compensate
for this. One other adjustment was made. Since the computer players
do not get the benefit of plots or random events, which often
give "freebies" to the human player, the AIs were given
the ability to obtain one unit of a given resource if no units
are available in their stockpiles and the computer wants to run
a task that requires that item. This also compensates partially
for problems which arise due to their reduced frequency of thinking.
This only applies if they are completely out of that commodity.
The computer players cannot pile up large stocks of goods in this
manner. Also, they do not possess this special ability at the
Easy difficulty level.

The high-level AIs handle the more complex thinking in the game.
They use a modified version of a traditional AI approach to prioritization
of their various options. This keeps them from becoming locked
into simple patterns of action. Attack, Build Castle, Saboteur,
Spy, and Diplomat are high-level AI tasks. The computer evaluates
each task based on a large number of variables. It may decide
to attack a particular territory because it contains a commodity
that is in short supply, or it may back off if it finds a castle
there. It weighs all of the possibilities and chooses the one
which is the best means of achieving its goals.


Beginning:

At the beginning of the game, your focus should be on grabbing
territory. This cannot be done in a haphazard manner, though.
Your most important goals should be:

Build a solid, defensible perimeter.
Possess all four types of resources.
Crank your economy up to top speed as soon as possible.

Most of the players begin in one corner or another of the map.
The best strategy for these players is to aim for an initial size
of five or six territories. Conquer a few immediately, preferably
by building a "wall" of territories that you own, behind
which may be a few that you do not yet own but are inaccessible
to the other players (the other players cannot "leapfrog"
and get to them). Then, conquer these other territories. Territories
will revolt if not subjugated by a show of force. You must therefore
begin to build castles once you control four or five territories.
Try to build just one castle, preferably in a territory which
borders every other territory that you own. If you are very fortunate,
or have planned well, the territory in which you build the castle
will have Gold as a resource. Make sure that your castle is at
least 100 points strong, so that it will prevent revolts in all
neighboring territories . The castle will not prevent revolts
until it reaches an appropriate level of completion. Be sure to
start construction early enough to ensure that your people will
not revolt before the castle reaches this critical size. One good
way to speed up the construction process is to skip the moat:
it slows the construction process significantly.

Politics also plays a critical role in the game, even at this
early stage. Make sure that your people are happy. Make sure that
the Pope likes you. And try to keep your enemies at bay by buying
them off occasionally until you can become strong enough to fight
them effectively.
Tough Choices

Once you have your initial territories under control, you may
choose any one of several approaches to the game. The game can
be won through military conquest, administrative power, or political
expertise, although the obvious military approach is the easiest.
Make a decision now as to how you wish to proceed, and stick to
it as long as possible.

The game will place far more demands on your resources than they
can support. You must decide whether to make your people happy,
build alliances with your neighbors, build castles, or build a
dominant military force. Your basic strategy choice will determine
which of these will be emphasized.

There are a few general pointers that apply to any strategy. Keep
these in mind, and you will always be in control -- as much as
possible, anyhow. And, lest you think that these pointers are
not important, just remember that the other players ARE using
them.

Use every ability point that you have. Even if you are not
running a Military task, for example, apply the otherwise unused
Military ability points to another task, such as a Gather. This
will serve the dual purpose of increasing the speed of the gather
task and giving you the extra push toward raising your ability
rating. Your Military ability will not increase as quickly as
if you were running Military tasks, but any contribution in the
right direction is helpful.

Stay friendly with the Pope. Monitor your relations regularly.
Remember that attacking a friend of the Pope (noted by the word
"Blessed" next to that player's name in the Council
display) will cause your relations with the Pope to decrease by
one point. It is very easy, therefore, to become excommunicated
through carelessness.

Stay friendly, or at least on neutral terms (Relations of
4 to 6) with your neighbors. The better your relations with them,
the less likely they are to attack or sabotage you. Also, your
Merchants are likely to get better deals if they are dealing with
friendly parties.

Maintain a reasonable army size. Make it too small, and your
neighbors may attack when their spies discover that you are a
weakling. Make it too large, and the maintenance costs will drag
down your economy.

Send Diplomats to "buy off" enemies who are attacking
you. They remember friendly actions and are less likely to attack
if they have reached a diplomatic agreement recently. Unfortunately,
they cannot recall armies who are already in the process of attacking,
so your Diplomat may be too late to be effective. Also, enemies
remember your hostile acts even longer than they remember the
nice ones.

Think in terms of small campaigns. Before launching attacks,
pick a small number of territories to capture, build up your army
and then go. Don't bite off more than you can chew! After grabbing
a couple of provinces, consolidate your gains, rebuild your army
and erect castles for defense. Never get greedy, as an overextended
empire crumbles very quickly!

Always harvest your resources. You will use them up very rapidly
as everything you do costs money and/or goods. Try to resist building
a castle until your Administrative Rating hits 5, allowing you
a second task in that category. Then keep harvesting as you build.

If you don't have a good mix of commodities in the territories
you own, you can still have a good economy. Try to harvest the
commodity you have the most of and then trade them for what you
need. You'll need good relations with a trading partner to pull
this off, but it works well when you don't have access to iron
and gold. Always remember that the black market is risky, but
it can help bail you out of tight situations.


Military Might

Many players initially try to win the game through brute military
force. Unfortunately, being a leader means more than having the
largest army. You must also make friends with those who can be
most helpful to you. You must choose your enemies carefully. And
you must manage your realm well enough that it does not vanish
in a sudden spate of revolts. The following hints should assist
the determined	militarist:

Obtain Knights as soon as possible. Build up to a Military
Ability Rating of 6 by recruiting and attacking. Don't police
your realm unless it's essential. Take a risk in order to build
up your forces more rapidly.

Build just enough castles to prevent revolts. You can build
them without moats if you're in a big hurry.

Make sure that you have plenty of Iron and Wood initially,
so that you can build a big army. Then make sure that you have
plenty of Food and Gold to pay for these forces. If you lose them
due to failure to pay, you may very well lose the game.

Choose your enemies carefully. Only attack one at a time.
Trying to conquer two at once will almost certainly end in disaster.
Send plenty of Diplomats to the other player to keep him off your
back. Besides, you can get better trading terms with that player
until you're ready to attack.

Ambush a weak opponent. Call a Council and see who is at war
with whom. Then attack a neighbor who is busy fighting someone
else.

Don't attack Blessed players unless you have no other choice.
The Pope will cause you a great deal of grief. You should never
need to be excommunicated.

Administrative Acumen and Political Prowess

CASTLES II may also be won through administrative might and diplomatic
savy. A player with six well-chosen territories and many castles
can prosper and win without spending enormous amounts of effort
on military campaigns.

The key to an administrative victory is maintaining the happiness
of your people and becoming allies with the other players. Run
Happiness tasks and send plenty of Diplomats to your neighbors.

Focus on obtaining Gold territories. You will need Gold to
buy off your neighbors and the Pope.

Build a moderate-sized standing army. If your neighbors suspect
that you have a small army, they are more likely to attack you.
Remember that losses affect the attacker more than the defender
(since the defender will never lose more than half of his army
in any given battle), so you can do a great deal of damage to
someone who dares attack you.

If you get attacked, send Diplomats. If relations improve,
your opponent will temporarily be less willing to attack again.
Keep up a steady stream of Diplomats and you may be able to avert
a second attack.

Send lots of Merchants and Diplomats. Political Ability points
are the most difficult to achieve, but you will have plenty of
time to get them since you will be spending fewer resources on
military actions.

When other players like you a lot (Relations of 8 or 9), trade
will be more advantageous. You can actually make a profit on trade
if you work hard at it. Every unit in your stockpile puts you
closer to victory.

Don't forget that your friends will turn on you when you Claim.
Relations will drop by one point with every other player. You
will suddenly be the target of numerous Saboteurs and Attacks.
Be prepared. Just before you claim, build up a substantial army
with plenty of Knights and Archers.

Long-Term Strategy

The goal of CASTLES II, ultimately, is to survive long enough
to become King. Once you have established your initial fiefdom,
it is time to put your overall strategy to the test. Focus on
the elements that you deem most important, as noted above. We
won't tell you how to win. There are many ways to win in CASTLES
II, and part of the fun is in discovering them for yourself. However,
a few general pointers for later in the game may be warranted:

Build a buffer of extra points before you Claim. Once the
other players get wind of your pending coronation, they will become
increasingly aggressive toward you. Claiming reduces relations
of all other players with you. This can pull you very rapidly
into warfare. Make sure that the loss of points due to the drop
in relations, plus the drops due to the attacks you will receive,
will not be so severe that the Pope decides not reject your claim.

Deciding when to Claim is a tricky decision. If you are the
first to try, everyone will take their shot at knocking you down.
Waiting for someone else to claim first is also a tricky path
to follow because you might not have enough time or power to knock
him down, and, if more players claim in the meantime, it'll turn
into a free- for-all. (Actually that becomes quite a fun endgame
to be involved in. Maybe that's not such a bad idea after all!)

Ten Sure Ways to Lose at Castles II

Attack two or three other players at once. Yeah, the more,
the merrier. It's fun to send troops in every direction, grabbing
territory as quickly as possible. It's fun to lose troops faster
than you can Recruit them. It's fun to beat back counterattacks
every two weeks. It's fun to restart the game every ten minutes!

Ignore the Pope: attack Blessed players: get Excommunicated.
So what if they are the Pope's friends? So what if eventually
this gets you Excommunicated? You're too tough to expect your
people to be happy. Besides, no iron-fisted ruler worth his garde-robe
worries about those Holy Rollers. And don't worry about the precipitous
drop in your army's morale because your people are unhappy. Your
army is three times bigger than any other in Bretagne -- at least,
it was the last time you checked. Besides, you don't need to send
no stinkin' Merchants.

Never send Diplomats. Diplomats are pansies. You kill them
when they come to you. Why send yours when Relations are always
so bad anyway? You don't need no stinkin' friends (see Merchants
above).  Scorched earth --that's your style. Take no prisoners.
Just build an army and kill everyone at once. No problem. They'll
never have time to mount a counterattack. What if everybody hates
you? Huh?. What if? Are you talkin' to me?

Trade inefficiently: Rely on the Black Market for scarce goods.
Trade with people who hate you. Everyone is out to get you. You
have no friends, so why would you expect them to trade advantageously
with you? What's so bad about an occasional 2 :1 or 3:1 swap for
something you really need? Losing one or two units per trade doesn't
really add up to much over thirty or forty trades, anyway. Besides,
how could you possibly have planned ahead for your needs?

Let your army starve or go without paychecks. Why, when you
were in the military you went six, seven years without eating.
Yeah, and when you ate all you had to eat were rocks. Yeah, and
when you got paid you got paid in sticks. Yeah, and they were
wet too! After all, you only lose one military unit on the first
delay. Why should you care if it's your best unit? You have more
Knights than you can use, don't you? And don't worry about the
fact that you lose double the units after every further delay.
You have more important concerns than maintaining an army.

Ignore a commodity because it's not important. Who needs Food,
except to feed the army, recruit Knights, and make people happy?
Who needs Timber, except to build castles, recruit Archers, and
make people happy? Who needs Iron, except to build castles and
recruit Infantry? Nobody needs Gold, right? Right? ... Well, gold
maybe ...

Don't build castles. The name of the game is CASTLES II. But
that has nothing to do with it. You're too busy conquering neighboring
territories to worry about those pesky revolts. And who needs
double commodities anyway? (see above) And you can always reconquer
the territories you lose. Your neighbors would never even think
about trying to capture a neutral territory that was once yours.
And how much protection can you really get from a pile of stone?
Ten archers posted on the walls can't possibly be very useful.
Why would you ever imagine that they might be safer up there,
or might be able to shoot arrows further? And what possible advantage
could there be to protecting all of your Infantry and Knights
from enemy Archers?

Never, ever Claim the throne. Why try to win, when you can
have lots of fun getting beaten to a bloody pulp year after year?
Masochism builds character. No, even better. Claim early. Just
as soon as your score creeps up to 7001. Yeah, that'll show everyone
just what you think of them. Those sniveling, wimps.

Change strategies every year or so. Yeah, keep duckin' and
weavin'. Bobbin' and dopin'. Move slowly and in different directions
all the time. Those computer players won't know what to do. Who
needs to focus on a consistent strategy? Planning never worked
for Wile E. Coyote.

Never send Scouts and Spies. Never call a Council. Why bother
looking at your neighbors? They aren't planning any hostile actions.
You're perfectly happy with two or three territories on the wrong
side of the river. You never worry when a new neighbor shows up.
He couldn't possibly have fifteen military units poised on your
border, a Happiness of 9, and a serious need for elbow room. So
what if Aragon just marched all the way to Albion's part of the
map? He can't possibly be winning the game. In fact, nobody else
could possibly be doing better than you. Just ignore them. You
always win on Impossible level, anyway.

SI ZHI BAN (TEST OF THE STICK):
Your master will attack you with the stick, using three different moves; a
leg sweep, mid swing and a high swing. The first two can be avoided by
jumping in the air, and the high sweep is dodged by crouching down. If
possible 60 of these attacks should be dodged so that you can get the
maximum bonuses to your attributes, any more will not add to the bonuses.
You will be able to sustain 10 hits before you collapse from exhaustion, so
care and quick reactions will be needed. I found that a good tip was to
take two steps backward just after your master has stopped advancing on
you, so it gives you a bit more reaction time the stick hits, so if you're
quick enough you can just walk backwards and out of reach of the attack.

SI ZHI ROU LUANG (TEST OF AGILITY):
Agility is something you're going to need plenty of if you're to last very
long against the opposition. Like the last test, this one improves your
strength, defence force and constitution, but it isn't as hard to complete
as the Test of the Stick, and you will get a bigger reward at the end of
it. Dodging is the name of the game here, and the amount of energy you
have left at the end will decide what bonuses you get (65% or more will be
enough to guarantee maximum bonus points). Circular Yin and Yang signs are
the only things that can be touched, and when you do, 20% of your energy
will be restored.

SI ZHI JUN SI (TEST OF BALANCE):
This is the last chance for you to upgrade your defence force (and get a
bit more strength in the process). By jumping from one pole to another you
must collect ten symbols as quickly as possible. Jumping from a fast
moving pole to a slow one doesn't usually prove to be a problem, but
jumping the other way round is much more tricky and care should be taken.
Remember you're allowed three goes at this test, so take chances on the
first two goes, and if you still haven't completed it, then take a bit more
time on the third one; 26 seconds or lower will be enough for prefect
scores on this test which will upgrade your strength and defence force.

SI ZHI KUAI (TEST OF SPEED):
Kick the ball and release both boards, within about 25 seconds to complete
this test. The idea behind this test is pretty straight forward and so is
the method in which you can complete it. The hardest part is quickly
turning around, ducking and then quickly kicking it, so that the ball goes
in the opposite direction once you've released one of the boards. When the
second board has been cut, keep your foot in the air so that the ball
doesn't come back and knock you over. Strength and attack force will be
affected by this test.

SI ZHI LI SI (TEST OF STRENGTH):
Just when your joystick thought it was safe to come out of the cupboard -
along comes a waggling event. As long as you can waggle your joystick
really fast then this test is a cinch. Get your hand in the centre of the
boards and waggle away, and if your arm is a bit knackered at the end of
the stage, have a few minutes rest before you attempt the next set of
boards. Four is the maximum number of boards you will allowed to break,
and once you've done this, your strength, attack force, and constitution
will be upgraded by a lot of points.

SI ZHI HOU (TEST OF FIRE):
This is your last chance to boost those skills. Strength, attack force and
constitution will be the skills that benefit. As the man throws the
flaming basket onto the bridge (after avoiding them) quickly kick each
basket away. Be careful not to get trapped, and get rid of the baskets as
quickly as possible, for if too many build up on the bridge you will fail
the test. Around 30 baskets full of energy will ensure that you get top
marks.

YOUR VERY OWN CHARACTER:
If you've managed to keep with the guidelines above then you will now have
a character whose statistics are all 100%.

COMBATING YOUR OPPONENTS:
There are four fighters in all who you will have to kill before you will
eventually arrive at the city walls, and each will be that little bit harder
than the last one. Although you have quite a few moves available, like
most martial arts games you need only use one or two to kill each opponent.
I found that the easiest and best way to defeat the fighters was to use
just the Tiger Claw and the Jump Kick moves. As a fighter approaches, use
the Tiger Claw move, and if you time it right you should be able to keep
him at the right distance throughout the fight. However now and then the
fighter will jump and avoid the blow. If this does happen, quickly do a
jump kick and, as he lands, your foot will collide with his head and knock
him to the ground inflicting a lot of damage. This will work on all
opponents if timed right.

THE CITY WALLS:
Pretty easy this. All you have to do is run along as fast as possible, and
jump each time you see a boulder, and duck each time you see a bird. Don't
worry too much if you get hit, because you will lose hardly any energy.

THE CITY GATES:
This is what you went through all this vigorous training for; but even with
all that skill, will you have enough energy left to defeat the dragon? As
soon as you see the dragon, go forward and kick him in the head and keep
this up until he opens his mouth and breathes some fire at you. When he
does this, run to the left and when the flames are about an inch away from
the dragon, run forward straight through the flames and start kicking the
dragon again. Keep this up and, provided you didn't get too badly beaten
up by the fighters, it's be a piece of cake.

Secret Exit Locations:

Level 1:
Shoot node1, pick up silver key, this opens the trees. Go right then down
then ALL the way right, you should find a small room and a gold key; pick
it up to open secret door below. Only 1 exit.

Level 2:
Shoot first node, pick SILVER KEY1, a bridge appears on rock platform.
Follow bridge and pickup GOLD KEY1 at the bottom/left edge of the rock
platform. Another bridge appears, go up and pick up GOLD KEY2. Go down
platform, go to the right (dont go up the first bridge you find). Once all
the way right, go up, pickup GOLD KEY3 and don't pick up SILVER KEY2 yet;
go right instead to secret room. Go back and pick SILVER KEY2, opening yet
another bridge. Follow bridge, you may pick GOLD KEY4 in middle of waters
if you wish. Once you reach the nodes, shoot 1nd one, go up toward exit,
pick up GOLD KEY5 to the right, go down newly formed stairs and shoot
node3, exit.

Level 3:
Go down and pick GOLD KEY1 behind small rockface to create stairs further
down the road. Go up (right/up or back and then up/r/up). When you reach
the circle with the dynamite, bugs will appear, use dynamite then; pickup
GOLD RING that appeared. Go up rock ring, pickup GOLD KEY3, blast monsters
below, go down again. Shoot SILVER PILLAR, go up, shoot node1, go up/right,
pickup GOLD KEY4 and shoot node2. Go left until you reach a room (down)
containing SILVER KEY2. Pick it up to open room to the right (backstep)
with node3 and SILVER KEY3. Dont pick SILVER KEY3 yet, shoot node3. SILVER
KEY4 appears below you, pick it up and go back to room where you found
SILVER KEY3. A new passage to the right should be open, go there and pickup
GOLD KEY5, another passage will open to the far left, going down to a row
of pillars. Go there, shoot ALL pillar, some will leave stuff. Go all the
way down and pickup GOLD KEY6. Then go back UP and pickup SILVER KEY5. Go
right and pickup GOLD RING. Find node4, shoot it and follow the new passage
to GOLD KEY6. Pickup GOLD KEY6, and you can now exit from A or B.

Level 4:
I'd need to draw a map for this one! But, when you reach the end of this
level, you need to shoot one of 2 pillars to progress. Shoot the one to the
right, this'll open up stairs behind you to reach the secret 'cavity' below.

Find a Dragon and cast a "MON ZO GOR SAR" spell, then press <ESC> to
pause the game. Now, while holding down the left <ALT> key, type in:
"LORD LIBRASULUS SMITHES THEE DOWN". Unpause the game and kill the
dragon, and when the dragon dies it should leave behind a Firestaff, and
the party should be invincible.

Undocumented Spells:
GOR IR KU	Detects Monsters
GOR IR ROS	Detects fake walls and "invisible" (actually hard to see) pits
GOR IR DAIN	Detects "magic" on screen?
ZO IR NETA	Anchors the map at the point of casting so that as you move
		around, the map view stays at the anchored position.

It's _REALLY_ easy to kill _ANY_ dragon. Here's how.
1) Prepare all your players with MON IR VEN spells (mega poison cloud)
2) Use the green freeze life box (on the dragon)
3) Cast the spells, and then double up on each player
   (ie. each player casts 2 spells for a total of 8)
4) Wait... dinner will be served soon.

Using the Vorpal Blade:
If you don't have both Vorpal Blades, you can increase #hits/time by
passing the weapon back and forth between the two attacking players.
(ie. hit -> pass blade to #2 -> hit -> pass back to #1 -> hit ->... )

Everything is affected by fireballs, including knights and dragons. The
only exceptions are slime, black flames, and the thing that pops up from
the floor.

A quick and painless way of gaining experience without fighting is by
simply practising. Stand directly in front of a large tree, or a closed
door, and give darts, daggers and arrows to the current leader to throw.
Don't worry about losing any of the weapons as they just hit the tree and
fall on the floor in front of you. Keep picking them up and throwing them
until you think you've gained enough experience. You don't get as much
ninja experience as in real combat, but it makes a significant difference
to the party members that stay in the rear and don't fight very often.
Spellcasting works much the same way, but it takes much longer since it
requires mana. When it looks like a skill won't rise any more, go out and
slay some monsters before you try again. Your be pleasantly surprised at
the results.

In the third area outside, collect fairy cushions and sell them. In the
fourth area, collect axes from the Axe men and sell them in the weapons
shop in the first area, not in the nearby town. in the fifth area, the
magic shop pays extremely well for many magical items. Purchase the Kalan
Gauntlet here, then take it to the weapons shop in the fourth area, you'll
be able to sell it for a large profit. You will also find a well hidden
chest full of gems beneath the ancient temple. Once your party enters the
keep, money will no longer be an object, sice the keep is full of valuable
gems and items.

Some armours can increase certain abilities if properly worn. Although
they aren't necessary to complete the quest, they do help an awful lot.
Here for your playing pleasure is some of the best examples: The tech helm
increases wisdom, fire poyeyn increases strength, and the cloak of night
increases your dexterity. Almost all of the more expensive shields cast
spells, and some increase magic and fire resistance. Although some are
very obvious, others are not. Keep an eye on your stats when wearing a new
piece of armour, you may discover many more.

The Numen staff is far the best weapon in the game, since you can recharge
it as many times as you so desire in the Vexirk cauldron in the keep. the
staff of NETA and the Emerald Orb are also very valuable since they can
transfer Mana directly into healing without bothering with potions. They
also raise the wielder's Mana a fair bit. The Excsymyr ranks top among
melee weapons due to its high speed double attacks, and considerable
damage.

SOLUTION:

OUTSIDE THE KEEP

Solving the first area with the Sun key

So you've chosen your elite team of professionals. Now climb up the ladder
into the room above you, there are many things to help you in your quest.

Go to the door that doesn't require a key and enter that room.

When you pick up and read the scroll which is laying on the altar it will
reveal that this room is used for the resurrection of fallen Champions.If
one of your team happens to die then pick up his/her/its bones and place
them on the altar in this room to bring them back to the living. Now
collect the torches which hang on the wall and head back into the other
room.

Pick up the torches in this room, the gold coin and the bota which lie on
the table. Open the chest on the floor and pickup the two potions. Now
move the table back and pick up the painting behind it. You will find
hidden behind the painting a bag containing several food items, a Magic
Map, that when activated will show you an overhead view of the current
area, a money box to organise coins and gems in, and a solid key in which
to open the locked door.

Before you unlock the door that leads into the unknown make sure you're
ready for combat. There are some glops outside just waiting to rip you in
half, watch out, these globs are nasty pasties.

Insert the key in the door, open the door and head down the corridor. The
globs you come across once outside will give your team some combat
experience. If a team member dies then pick the bones and take them back
to the altar to resurrect them. They will lose all previous possessions
and have weakened health, but the experience they gained up to the point
of death will be retained.

When you have finished with the globs you will find many useful items
lying around. Minor weapons, coins and debris are scattered about.
Although many items are picked up by the globs, they are left behind when
they are killed. In the centre of the opening you will see two landmarks.
One a fountain, the other is a mysterious black and red star pattern on
the ground. The pattern reveals itself much later on in the game, but the
fountain can be used immediately. If you place a bota in the churning
water it will come out filled, plus it also contains a few hidden coins.

Nearby on the ground you will find a staff. Spellcasters who hold it gain
five points to their maximum mana. The staff allows unlimited casting of
weak Magical torch spells. The second spell on the staff has an
incantation to open or close a door from a distance (this will prove very
useful). Keep a note of the symbols they use as they can be duplicated.
Every shop has a sign outside its entrance, this depicts the wares they
deal in.

Head towards the dark keep on the horizon. There is a shop that sells food
items furthest from the hall in this area. There are also several tables
as well as a small fountain which is set in the wall. Click on the
fountain, your entire party can drink there without the use of their
botas. Buy a compass from the food shop, this will help you on your
journey. The Sun key is on a table in the food shop furthest west. Take
the key to the lock near the door, drop it in, and then press the switch.
Be careful as more creatures await you outside. So prepare your weapons,
take a deep breath and enter the second area.

Solving the second area with the Lightning key

Proceed as far as possible north, past the Lightning door, through an
archway that leads into the Thorn Demon area. You will come across a large
tree, go west and find a path north through another archway which leads
into a foggy area. The Lightning altar lies in the middle of a ring of
monoliths, on it is the Lightning key necessary to go on to the next area.

Solving the third area with the Moon key

Once through the Lightning door keep going east until you run into a small
tree. Follow the path nearby north, then east through an archway into the
swampy domain of the wolves. Don't attack the wolves (unless you need to
defend yourself) because they howl to the rest of their pack for help.
More wolves join the fight and soon enough you will find yourself out
numbered and being torn into itsy bitsy pieces. Proceed east, then north
on the left path, then west a few spaces to a pit. Jump in and receive
some damage or use Grayen's rope, now keep pushing the large boulder until
it moves. Take the ladder up and go west a few spaces, take the bone from
the niche. Now go back to the wolves and throw them the bone to keep them
busy while you continue west and south towards the Moon altar. Collect all
the items, then get out of the swamp quickly. Open the Moon door and
continue onto the next area.

Solving the fourth area with the Energy key

Go through the Moon door, keep going south until you get to the teleport
pad. Head east through an archway into the Axe Man Domain. Move swiftly as
you will be harder to hit by thrown axes. Near the middle of this area
lies the Energy altar, just north of it is another archway into a town
with three new shops. Use a magic map to avoid being cornered by the Axe
Men, and grab the keys from the altar. You will find the Energy door is
near to the teleport pad, go through into the next area.

Solving the fifth area and retrieving the last Clan key piece

Proceed through the Energy door and continue west until you see a niche
and an archway nearby. Grab the vorpal blade from the niche and enter the
foggy cemetery. To avoid releasing nasty spirits keep away from the statue
and the tomb in the middle. Go south into the swampy area, whilst at the
same time avoiding the haunted trees. Now head east into the ancient
temple.

Moving pits and fire Doors

Once inside the temple locate the button on the right side of the room
with covered pits, press the button to open a hidden alcove. Inside you
will find the fire key. Make your way over the pits on this side of the
room, get the key and prepare to cross the nearby room. Move the pits by
casting Accelerate and activating a magic map to keep an eye on the pits.
Go quickly east and south to the Fire door, open it with the key and
enter. If you should fall into a pit, wait for the gates to reopen and
take the stairs back up and try again. Look out for another hidden button
in the large underground room to find a chest packed full of expensive
gems.

Air key

Just past the Fire door is a twisting hallway full of mummies, cast the
Accelerate spell again, then sprint to the Air door. Open it and proceed
through. Inside you will find a bartering table with the last Clan piece.
Place any coin on the table and the key is yours (there's no catch!)

INSIDE THE KEEP

Solving the first stage of puzzles leading to the boiler room

After passing through the entrance to the keep the door closes behind you.
Nearby is the gold lock which opens it, but first you must get through a
series of gates. Take a step up to the tech eye, then take step back to
avoid the incoming fireballs (this happens only once). Enter into the
small alcove with buttons in it, now face north. Press the button on the
left, then the button on the right, now run forward into the gates as they
open. Your find that the third gate is closed, so go back to the harmless
tech eye. Face south, without entering the alcove, and cast Accelerate.
Aim the mouse pointer on the button directly ahead of you and use the
keyboard to move faster. Step up to the button, press it and run backwards
as fast as you can. Set the guard minions in each of the five spaces which
lead to the last gate, this will keep the gates open a little longer than
usual. The closing gates may cause some damage to you, but once your past
the third gate they all stay open.

Tempest

Get the minion map from the niche and stand on the space where the
Tempest is lying. Activate the map, select the X and then walk back to the
stairs. Select the icon that shows a minion moving away from the X, and the
minion brings you the sword.

Dark Vexirks

First things first, pull the bell rope to summon a Vexirk to open the
outer gate, be patient as they usually take there time. Don't bother with
the items in the niches or provoking the Vexirks. Head east into the
smaller room and wait for them to wonder out into the main room. Set as
many guard minions as you can before they attack. Avoid the Vexirk king
with the Numen staff. Keep setting minions until all the Vexirks are dead,
now grab the staff. The Numen staff is the only magical item you can
recharge in the cauldron. The staff also opens the outer gate and inner
door as long as you walk up to them with it.

Tech Eyes

To get to the hall with the tech eyes, use the minion map to place an X on
the floor trigger. Stand next to the closed door and send a minion to drop
a coin on it. Once the minion drops an item on the trigger the door opens
just long enough for you to dash in. Press the button on the other side to
keep it open. Press the ROS button on the map to see the false walls. Get
behind the tech eye through one of the false walls and open the plate to
remove it. Nearby you will find a hidden button which will open a wall to
another tech eye. Head back to the long hall and quickly enter through
another false wall before a fireball reaches you. Deactivate the last two
eyes the same as the first and the hall will become safe for you to travel
through.

Opening Boiler Room

Get the large gear from the niche, place it on the device next to the
door, now press the button to open it. Grab the gear quickly and go on to
the next door, or buy extra gears from the magic shop near the ancient
temple outside. If you take too long the pits will open up under you so
speed is of the essence. If you fall down the pits, simply walk to the
ladder, climb up and try again.

Solving the second stage of puzzles in the catacombs

Once your inside the boiler room kill all the enemy minions and get the
Earth key from the niche. Put the key in the lock which is located in a
nearby alcove, now step out and pull the lever beside it. A pit will open
and drop the key two levels down. This also unlocks the door beside the
entrance, but you will need the Earth key again to go further. There's two
routes to reach the Earth key, the first is using Grayen's rope (this will
cause you a lot of damage), the second is to walk down. If you decide to
walk down pull the lever near the central ladder to lower it. Proceed
downwards and then head south to an area with bats and boulders. Push a
boulder into a pit, and take a one-way ladder down. Now go west, then
north into Dru-Tan's domain.

Dru-tan

Dru-Tan is hard to kill, but no means impossible. The easiest way in which
to dispose of him is to catch him in his own trap. Dodge your way west,
past the locked door with the Rockies in, to the next door with a strange
lever beside it. Open the door and enter, go down the hall two spaces and
turn to face the spiked wall. Wait for Dru-Tan to enter. As soon as he
enters quickly turn around and run to the other end, this will set the
trap in motion, hopefully trapping Dru-Tan with you. Press a concealed
button to open the second gate, it only works once. Exit the trap and
close the door behind you. After he dies open the door again from the
outside, go back to the other door and pull the strange lever to reset the
trap. Finally, go back around and get the Blood key. If the trap should
fail, you'll have to kill him the old-fashioned way, with spells.

Activating Furnace

When you've killed Dru-Tan, get the Earth key and the Blood key. Open the
Blood door and go through. inside you will find a button on the wall which
activates a teleporter. The Rockies will enter through it so follow them.
Proceed east toward the furnace and exterminate the enemy guard minion so
that the Rockies will be able to toss some fuel into the fire. Place your
own guard minion nearby to prevent any enemy minions from blocking the
furnace again. Go back to the boiler room via the ladder. Pull the switch
beside the boiler, but it won't work until you finish more quests.

Crossing the Pit

After opening the second Earth door, you need a scout map to cross the pit
that opens and closes. Stand on the floor trigger and activate the scout
map. Select the minion icon and click on the map which is on the other
side of the pit to send the minion there. The trick is to block the Zo
balls with your minion and leave the pit open, so keep at it. Go up the
ladder to begin the third stage.

Solving the third stage of puzzles leading to the pump room

You will find that you need a vacuum fuse to unlock the door where the
Master key is kept. The easiest way is to buy one from the magic shop
outside near the ancient temple. Or you can chase a floating chest around
and destroy it with fireballs to get one. Place the fuse in the device
near the door to the west to unlock it. look for some false walls inside.

Level Puzzle

To open the door to the level puzzle you need the Master key and a large
gear. Once your inside get the Master key from the lock. Go to where the
levers are and pull each one several times. Leave them all in the up
position, and all except the last door to the pump room will stay open. On
your way to the pump room destroy the large barrels and get the items
within. Use the Master key to open the last door, then take it back. Once
inside collect the Iron key, and place another vacuum fuse in the slot.
activate the pumps and lower the ladder. Take the Cross key back to where
you got the Master key, and lower the ladder to stage four.

Solving the fourth stage of puzzles leading to the valve room

The easiest and quickest way in which to deal with all those tables is
to hack through them one by one with weapons.

Rams

This requires speed and timing in rather large quantities. First cast your
Accelerate spell, then carefully watch the movements of the rams. If the
ram is extended on the way in or on the way out then you will get pushed
into the pit. Start off with the ram furthest to the east. Wait until the
ram is on the in-stroke, and when it's almost reached the wall you can
rush past. After the first ram you will encounter two more in a row. Once
again watch for the instroke, step safely in front of the first one, wait
a fraction of a second, then hurry past the second one.

Reflector Room

You have two ways of solving this one, the easy way or the hard way. The
easy way is to angle the centre and one side reflector so you can cast
your own fireball north, to strike the target and remove the pits. You
find the ladder up to the last stage is east of this room. The hard way
however requires you to position the reflectors with levers, so that a
fireball bounces all the way around the room, back to the centre reflector
and then into the target. This requires using a magic map to see all the
reflectors. Use the middle lever to move the centre reflector while the
fireball is flying around to change the angle.

Teleport Fields

When you've solved the reflector room puzzle move each reflector one at a
time into the room with the moving teleport fields. Place them in a
straight line, south to north, with the fields on the other side. Then
move thereflectors east until they are boxed in. Be careful not to block
any passages.

Locked doors

Throw fireballs at the locked gate in the reflector room to open it. The
other door past the teleport fields is not quite so easy. Activate the
scout map, send the scout to the space in the middle of four pits and
throw a coin at it. The coin will bounce off the minion and onto a floor
plate, removing some of the pits and opening the nearby door. Last of all
you need the Master key one final time to open the door to the valve room.


Solving the top levels of the keep and opening the portal to Dragoth

Face the hall with the lightning bolts and cast the Accelerate spell.
activate a map, watch for a pause in the lightning, then move down the
hall. On the other side is a switch to turn off the lightning. Two keys
rest in a nearby niche, but you can only take one at a time. If you take
both keys, a suction trap in the floor holds the party helpless,
presumably until Dragoth arrives to kill you. If you pick up the Skull key
first, put it back and click the pointer directly on the Onyx key. This
key must stay in the lock for the Onyx door to stay open.

Skull Key and Storage Room

Past the Onyx door you will find the Zolink chamber, before that you must
get the Skull key. Lower the ladder near the entrance, then head back to
the control room and get the Onyx key, closing the door. Take this key
back to the niche and take the Skull key. Make sure that you leave one key
in the niche at all times. Go back to the reflector room via the ladder
and out to the teleport field room. Now climb back up the ladder into the
Zo-link chamber, the Skull lock will activate a teleport field. Enter and
cast fireballs at the nearest reflector to destroy a table. Now move the
brazier, destroy the table and open the door.

Reflectors and Zo-link

Once you've opened the storage room move the reflectors out into the
Zo-link chamber and then place them on the drain gates. Pull the switch
inside the short hall to the portal. Now pull one of the switches on the
south wall to release a stream of red hot fireballs that strike the
central crystal. Next, walk around the room and pull the other fireball
switch. Finally pull the last switch on the north side of the chamber to
the lightning bolts at the crystal. If this doesn't do the job you will
have to go back all the way down to the catacombs to refuel the furnace.
When all the devices are fully working the Zo-link will open.

Opening Zo-link

Open the Onyx door, go straight into the Zo-link chamber and pull the four
switches inside. Fire the Numen staff at the central crystal to open the
portal. You don't need to bother with the reflectors or the boiler which
lies far below.

Defeating Dragoth

Cast the Accelerate spell to cross the moving platforms. As soon as you've
reached the area where Dragoth lurks start setting guard minions and try
to keep Dragoth near them. If you must, fry him at point blank range with
large fireballs or the Numen staff to help prevent him from dodging. Keep
moving to avoid his spell attacks and ignore the attack minions he summons
against you.

Complete Solution:

Part 1 - INTRODUCTION AND COMMENTS

The game is available for both the Atari ST and the Amiga, but the moves
for the two versions are very different. We decided to write just one with
lots of version notes included.

First, the ST version allows you to read only one document: a scroll.
However, we know of no way to read even that in the Amiga version. This
is a particularly unfortunate problem since it gives some specific
instructions which are needed to complete the game. If you are playing
the Amiga version, by all means drop by The Gamers' Forum when you get
the scroll, and we will be happy to let you know what it says. (Or, of
course, continue reading this walkthru.) There are also two other
letters which we suspect gave important clues, but we couldn't read them
in either version.

At times the game will display inset pictures on your screen of various
things you may have examined. Often, it is the inset you need to use in
order to get an item, or whatever else you may be trying to accomplish.
If something isn't working when you know it should be, try using the inset
instead of the original (or vice versa, depending on what you were using
before). We do tell you which to use, however.

Part 2 - THE CASTLE

Once you start travelling, it is difficult to return to the rest of the
castle, so we'll start by collecting everything we need in this part.
You begin in the Entrance Hall of your father's castle. If you LOOK at
the left newel post of the stairway, you'll notice it's missing an
ornament. Go east into the den, and you'll find it on the bookcase to
the right of the desk. It's the only important thing in this room; so,
GET the ornament, and while you're here, DROP the letter (the one from
your documentation), and go back west to the Hallway. USE the ornament
on the top of the left newel post. LOOK at the urn and you'll find your
first punchcard! TAKE the card from the urn. Go up and LOOK at the base
of the statue. TAKE the key, and USE it on the lock of the chest at the
back of the room. LOOK in the chest, TAKE the gloves, and drop the key.
Now, LOOK at the upper right-hand corner of the carpet, and you'll find
another punchcard. TAKE it, and proceed northeast into the bedroom.
PULL on the handle of the bedside table, then LOOK in the drawer. TAKE
the piece of paper. LOOK at the throw pillows on the bed, and TAKE the
punchcard you find there. LOOK under the bed, and TAKE the grapnel and
rope. That's all that's important here, and the other bedroom has
nothing useful. Head southwest and down to the Entrance Hall.
Go west into the dining room, then north into the kitchen. TAKE the
bottle on the counter. PULL on the cabinet that is directly under the
sink. LOOK at the cabinet, and you'll get a smaller picture of the safe
that's hidden there!  USE the paper you found upstairs on the safe.
Voila!	It opens, and you see some money and a lighter. Ignore the
money, but take the lighter, then go south, east, and northeast. Hey,
it's dark! Not to worry. LIGHT the lighter, then go up and east into
the chapel. On the right side of the mantel in the rear of the room is
a candle.
TAKE the candle, LIGHT it, then UNLIGHT the lighter. It is important to
do this as efficiently as possible because the lighter is almost out of
fluid, and you'll need it later. LOOK at the book on the lectern, and
you'll find the fourth punchcard you need. TAKE it and go west, down
twice, then east to the Laboratory. At this point your inventory is
probably full, so DROP any one item except the candle.

LOOK at the mirror on the wall, and a hidden switch will appear. PUSH
the switch (on the inset picture), and a secret door will open!  DO NOT
GO THROUGH THE DOOR!  Putting the ornament back on the newel post
activated the electricity so you could open the door. But if you go
through the door now, you'll get fried!  Go west, up, and southwest to
the hallway. GET the ornament from the newel post, then DROP it. Go
northeast, down, and east back to the Laboratory. PULL the left-hand
desk drawer, and LOOK in it. You'll find some fuses. TAKE them, then go
north into the Secret Room. Ah, ha! There's the time machine!

USE fuses on the green square at the bottom of the fuse box on the left
rear wall, then PULL the lever next to the fuse box. The Time Machine
comes to life.

(Amiga version: Don't be too eager to use the Time Machine just yqet:
You're going to need whichever item you dropped in the Laboratory. So,
go south and search around until you find it. Use the GET icon on the
bottom portion of the picture. You'll just enter the Time Machine use
the UP icon (to leave it use the DOWN icon). So, ENTER the machine, and
SHOW the control panel.
If you follow this walkthru exactly, you should be able to follow the
rest of the instructions, because your punchcards will be in the proper
place in your inventory. In case you haven't followed along, here is
where the various punchcards in the Amiga version will take you:
From the Urn in the Hallway: Prehistory
From Under the Rug: India
From Under the Pillows: Egypt
From the Chapel: Mexico

If you remove a card, those to its right move to the left to fill the
empty space, but their relative positions do not change. USE the SECOND
punchcard in your inventory on the slot in the control panel.

Whoosh: You're in India! Go west, then north into the hut. The Leper
wants to shake your hand, but you don't want to get leprosy; so, USE the
glove, then TAKE the Leper's hand. Leave the glove on throughout the rest
of the game: You'll need it periodically.
The Leper will be so grateful he'll give you a piece of paper which
will allow you to take an elephant ride. He also asks you to get some
water from the sacred temple which will cure him. GET the paper, and go
south, east twice, then northeast to the Mahouts. DROP the paper, and
they'll agree to take you to the temple.
"Up" will put you on the elephant's back, and you'll automatically end
up at the temple.
Go east into the temple, and you'll find the sacred water. To get the
water into the bottle, do the following exactly:
USE
BOTTLE
GET
WATER
The text should say that you have the water. Now go west and up, and
the elephant will take you back to where you started.
Go southwest, west twice, north, and DROP the bottle.
The grateful Leper will offer you a key. TAKE the key, then go south,
east, and north, and you'll see a smaller picture of a door. USE the
key on the door and you'll be inside a hut. On the table is a letter
and a piece of punchcard!  TAKE the punchcard piece, and the letter,
then DROP the letter. (It probably has an important clue, but nobody
can figure out how to read it!)  Go south, west twice, and you'll see
a Fakir who has a scroll in his right hand. TAKE the scroll, but don't
hang around! Go east twice, up into the machine, SHOW PANEL
and PUSH the toggle switch on the left side of the control panel.
You made it home again! DROP the candle, then enter the Time Machine.
SHOW PANEL, and USE the SECOND punchcard in your inventory on the slot.

You find yourself in Egypt! LEAVE the Time Machine and go northeast.
You should see a pedestrian-crossing here. If you don't, _do not_ go
north, or you'll get run over!	(The northeast direction in the Amiga
version was VERY touchy; half the time you ended up going east instead
of northeast. You can also get to the pedestrian-crossing by going east
twice from the Time Machine.)
Go north twice, and you find yourself in front of a Pyramid. LOOK at
the bottom left stone surrounding the entrance. You're told the stones
are loose, and you find an amulet. GET the amulet. Since we can't find
a way to READ things, you'll have to trust this walkthru.

The scroll says: "TOP, TOP LEFT, TOP RIGHT, TOP RIGHT." Using the
PUSH/PULL icon, PUSH on the stones in the order indicated by the scroll,
and the door will open. If you don't do this right, you die. DROP the
scroll. Go north twice, ignoring the torch on the way. You don't want
to mess with all those snakes, so DROP the amulet, and they disappear.
Now, go north again, then west. USE the grapnel and rope, and go up.
Starting from the left, use the PUSH/PULL icon and PULL the SECOND,
THIRD, FOURTH, and FIFTH levers into the down position. The sarcophagus
will open. In it you find a ring and another piece of the punchcard.
TAKE the ring and the piece of card. Using the PUSH/PULL icon, return
the four levers to their original positions.

Go down, north, and TURN the right-hand torch on the wall to open a
secret passage into Nefertiti. Going down will take you outside to the
entrance into the pyramid. (If you hadn't returned the levers to their
original positions, you would have been impaled on spikes in the secret
passage.)  Go south twice, west, and up into the Time Machine. SHOW
PANEL and PUSH the toggle switch to go home. A note here about dropping
pieces of the punchcard. This was done in order to make room in your
inventory, but it is a bit of a pain to find them again, especially in
the Amiga version. From now on, we will include a note on how many
inventory spaces you will need in a given time zone.

For the next time zone (Prehistory), you will need four free inventory
spaces. (The ST version requires five.)  The punchcard you USE in the
time machine will release one inventory space; you can drop an item to
free another space.
In the secret room, DROP the piece of punchcard (if you need extra
inventory space), SHOW PANEL, then USE the FIRST card in your inventory
to enter Prehistory. LEAVE the machine and go east. LOOK at the
 entrance to the hut, and you'll find a bone. TAKE the bone. You will
also find some dry grass and a rock. If you have space, you can TAKE
the ROCK.
Now, go east twice, and north to the remains of a fire. LOOK at the
fire and you'll find a piece of wood. TAKE the wood, LIGHT your lighter,
LIGHT the wood, UNLIGHT the lighter. You may now drop the lighter.
Toward the back of this scene you'll see some small rocks. LOOK at the
rocks, and you'll be told there's a small rock there. TAKE the rock (if
you didn't take the one from the hut), then go east and south into the
cave. LOOK in the area of the candles, and you'll find another piece of
punchcard. TAKE the piece, then LOOK at the drawing that appears in the
left corner of the background. You should get an inset picture on your
screen showing the drawing's finer details. It's a drawing of a temple
with "13-H" written above it.
Go north, west, south, and west three times. ENTER the Time Machine
(SHOW PANEL), and PUSH the toggle switch to go home.

Part 4 - MEXICO AND THE FUTURE

We're about to embark on the most complicated scenario yet; be prepared
to save your game!  First, DROP the piece of punchcard you picked up in
Egypt, if you want to. You only need one free inventory space, and
you'll get that from the punchcard. The branch is also useless, so you
may drop it.
Go north to the Time Machine (Amiga version: SHOW PANEL), and USE the
remaining punchcard on the slot. Suddenly, you find yourself in Mexico!
From the Time Machine, go east twice, and you'll see a tree on the left
side of the screen with a hole near its bottom. LOOK at the hole, then
TAKE the necklace. Go west four times to the warrior. USE the necklace
on his right hand near the bottom of the screen. He'll draw you a map,
and tell you to start from the three rocks. Go northeast three times,
then north to a small temple. LOOK at the temple, and you'll see an idol.
TURN the idol, and you'll find a key. TAKE the key, go west three times,
and you'll be at the three stones the warrior told you about.
Save your game here!  As mentioned before, the direction icons are _very_
touchy (particularly in the Amiga version); if you're off by a pixel or
two, you'll go in the wrong direction and get killed. Go northeast three
times, north twice, northwest twice, northeast, then east. You should
find yourself in front of the temple. You should be still wearing the
glove. If so, LOOK at the bush in the middle foreground of the picture.
(If you're NOT wearing the glove, a snake will kill you!)
You should get an inset picture of a slab with a slot in the middle of
it. USE the ring on the slot in the MAIN picture (not the inset), go
up, and beams of light will appear, indicating that the door is now safe
to approach. Going up again will provide you with an inset picture of a
door. You'll notice a small hole on each side of the door. USE the bone
on the hole on the RIGHT side. The text will tell you that nothing
happens, but if you go up again, you'll find yourself in the temple.

You are now inside the temple facing a chest. USE the key on the chest,
and TAKE the final piece of punchcard!	(If you have the other three
pieces of punchcard with you, they will automatically become one whole
punchcard. We guess punchcards worked differently in the 1920s, before
computers were invented.)
Go down, and save your game; then, go west, southwest, southeast twice,
south twice, southwest three times, southeast twice, and southwest.
You're back at the Time Machine. ENTER the time machine (Amiga version:
SHOW PANEL), and PUSH the toggle switch.
Now LEAVE the machine, and GET the three other pieces of punch card you
dropped in the room (if you dropped them). After you find the second
piece, you'll see a new inset picture appear (in the Amiga version). We
have _no idea_ what it represents; if you figure it out, please let us
know!

When you find the fourth piece, the punchcard will automatically be
assembled for you, and you're ready for the final assault! All you need
in your inventory at this point is the glove, rock, picture, and
punchcard. ENTER the Time Machine (SHOW PANEL), and USE the punch card
in the slot.
When you arrive, LEAVE the Time Machine. Ahead of you, you will see a
door. To the left of it is what looks like a monitor with a couple of
buttons under it. PUSH the red button, and a picture will appear on the
monitor. In the lower right corner of your screen, you'll see a console.
PUSH the red button on the console, and a map of the world will appear.
Go west, the door should open, and a guard with a gun will appear. In
order to take care of him, click in the following order:
HIT
MAN
ROCK
(Someone suggested that you need to do more here before hitting the
man. So if this doesn't work, try fiddling around with something first.)

LOOK at the floor where the man fell; you'll find a suit, a gun, and a
strange key. You need the suit and the key, but you can ignore the gun
if you wish. USE the suit and you'll be wearing it.
Go north, east twice, and south to a small room with some equipment in
it. At the bottom right you will see a platform with a red button on it.
PUSH the button, and you'll see a picture of a strange machine with an
"X" on it. (Remember the position of the "X"!)	Now, go north three
times, and west: There's the machine you saw in the little picture!
PUSH on the area where you saw the "X," and a compartment will open.
Making sure you're still wearing the glove, TAKE the fuses out of the
open compartment.
The machine will stop functioning. Go east. There's a storage
compartment on your right which contains a spacesuit. This suit will
let you go out into space, but there's nothing out there, so don't
bother. Instead, continue south twice, then east.
(If you're not wearing the suit, or if you didn't remove the fuses from
the machine, you'll get killed at this point in the Amiga version.)

If you're still alive, USE the key on the control box to the right of
the door. If you haven't brought the picture with you, the key will have
no effect. (It makes no sense to us, either!)
If you HAVE brought the picture, the servant will appear, confess
everything, and a picture of Humphrey Bogart will appear telling you
you've won the game.

Basic Detective Skills:

-How to progress through the "acts":
In every act there are certain tasks you must accomplish in order for the
play to progress to the next act.

-How to "spy" on people and find out what's really going on behind those
-closed doors? Everytime I walk into a room and interrupt a conversation,
-the people stop talking!
Push on either armoire upstairs to move it. Discover a secret room. You
are able to peek through the eyeholes of the portraits to spy on anyone in
the bedrooms. Do this often throughout the play. Downstairs, push on the
Grandfather Clock or the mirror to eavesdrop on conversations.

-How to closely examine the items you've found. What to use to yourself:
A real detective is never without a magnifying glass! You can find a
monocle on Wilbur's dead body and use it to examine evidence in much the
same way.

You see Lillian talking to Celie in the kitchen. You can also attempt to
talk to Celie. Get the soupbone from the icebox.

Dining room:
Private conversations sometimes occur in The Dining Room. If you are able
to eavesdrop you'll learn some interesting facts. At one point you find
Rudy eating alone.

Attic:
There are two ways to get into the attic. When The Colonel's not around,
you can find the key to operate the elevator controls and ride up to the
attic. Look through the trunk full of old army clothes and read the
newspaper. In the eighth act, you will find another key on a dead body.
Use that key to enter the attic through the door at the top of the stairs.

Basement:
Towards the end of the play you discover a secret passage in the Hedge
Garden that leads to the basement. Locate the small metal plate on the
wall. Insert the crank into the metal plate (take the crank off the bell).
Turn the crank to discover another hidden passage.

Upstairs Bathroom:
In the beginning of the play you are able to watch Lillian putting on
perfume in the bathroom. Later in the play, search the wastepaper basket.

Colonel's bedroom:
You can see different people having conversations with The Colonel-Fifi
talks with him and even kisses him (hmmmmm). Lillian also has a
conversation with The Colonel. You can search for the elevator key when
The Colonel is away from his room. Notice The Colonel's cigar. Try to spy
on The Colonel when he doesn't know you're watching.

Lillian's room:
Towards the end of the play you will see Lillian hiding something in her
suitcase. When she's not around you discover it's her diary! Still later,
you can catch Rudy searching the room.

Ethel's room:
There is not much that occurs in Ethel's bedroom. You can talk to her at
the beginning of the game.

Gloria and Gertie's room:
In the early evening you'll find Gertie napping in her room. Later you
will discover signs of a struggle in this room.

Dr. Wilbur's room:
Notice Dr. Wilbur's bag on his bed. Later you will notice it's missing.

Clarence and Rudy's room:
Rudy and Clarence argue in their room. Later, Clarence naps in his room.
Late in the night, you see Clarence writing at the desk. When he's not
around you are able to read his diary. You will also see signs of a
struggle and a bloodstain on the floor.

Fifi's bedroom:
At first you notice nothing suspicious in Fifi's room (except when Rudy's
around). Later in the play, however, you discover a murder here! Search
carefully for any clues or evidence. Thoroughly examine the decanter of
cognac.

Jeeves bedroom:
Jeeve's room is in the cellar. Get the crackers that are on the table.

Celie's house:
Visit Celie more than once during the play. When she invites you in for a
chat, get the carrot.

The Chapel:
Use the crowbar (that you found in The Carriage House) to pry up the loose
floorboards and find an old Bible. Come back later and pray with Celie.

Cemetary:
There is something in the tomb, but you can't get to it through the
cemetary. You must take the secret underground passage through the Hedge
Garden.

Playhouse:
Twice you discover Lillian in the Playhouse with her dolls acting in a
very bizarre manner.

Stable:
You need to get the lantern. First, you must feed Blaze the carrot that
you got from Celie's house.

Carriage House:
You need to get the oilcan and the crowbar. You can sometimes discover a
dead body here.

Bell Tower:
Climb the ladder and oil the bell (find an oilcan in the Carriage House).
If you can't reach the rope, use the cane that you find in the secret
passage. Get the crank from the bell, you'll need it.

Hedge Garden:
You will see a small square shaft on the statue of the dancing nymph.
Insert the valve handle into the shaft (you can find the valve handle in
the suit of armor). Turn the valve handle, then turn the statue. Towards
the end of the play you will find a dead body in the Hedge Garden. Search
the body to find a key. Get the derringer and the bullet. Load the gun.
Near the end of the play you will also discover a SECRET UNDERGROUND
PASSAGE in the Hedge Garden that leads to the basement.

Other Tips:

What to do with the suit of armor:
Oil the visor. (You can find an oilcan in the Carriage House.) You'll find
a small metal valve handle inside the armor. Use it on the statue in the
Hedge Garden. Or you can Oil hand.

How to open the cellar door near the doghouse:
At the beginning of the play, the doors won't open. Come back later and
you will be able to go inside.

How to ride the elevator:
Search The Colonel's room when he's not around. Find the brass key inside
the miniature cannon. Look at the elevator controls. Using the key you
will be able to ride up to the attic.

ACT EIGHT (The Final Scene):

What to if I find the Colonel, and he is dead...:
Time is critical, you need to move a little faster. You want to interrupt
the fight in which the Colonel is killed. Try again, this time: after
discovering Lillian's body, get the gun and the bullet... load the gun.
Search Lillian for a key, then QUICKLY go to the attic.

You witness the struggle in the attic between Rudy and the Colonel, and
Rudy wins... What you should have done:
It's probably not a good idea to passively watch. Did you find the gun?
Get the gun and bullet in the Hedge Garden. Load the gun. Shoot Rudy!

You witness the struggle in the attic between Rudy and the Colonel, and
you shot the Colonel.. Did you do the right thing?
Nope. Next time don't shoot The Colonel.... shoot Rudy and see what
happens.

You witness the struggle in the attic between Rudy and the Colonel, and
you shot Rudy.. Did you do the right thing?
Wise choice... You did the right thing! Rudy was trying to kill the
Colonel.

@remark H
		      Playing Against An Alien Opponent

The aliens never seem to attack your planets until very late in the game, after
they have colonized a lot of the uncolonized planets in the universe. I can not
guarantee that the aliens will attack late in the game but it is very likely
that they will leave you alone until at least turn 150. As soon as possible
build an exploration ship and send it with a couple of other combat ships
(for protection) to the surrounding planets, this serves two purposes - to
look for planets to colonize and to look for alien life-forms.
When you find alien life-forms and the empire offer you fleet forces or
resources. (a transporter partially filled  with food, material and energy)
I would recommend that you always take the fleet forces because spaceships are
usually much more useful than a transporter partially filled with food, material
and electricity, also the empire can send the spaceships to any planet instantly
which cuts down the time spent exploring the universe for good colonizable
planets.
The details of fleet forces and resources obtained at different IQ levels can be
seen below:-

IQ Rating Of Life Form	Fleet Forces		Resources
					 Food	Material       Energy
	1		Fighter 	 15	0		15
	2		Dreadnought	 30	60		30
	3		Cobra Ship	 45	180		45
	4		Pulsar Destroyer 60	240		60
	5		Battlestar	 75	360		75

When the aliens attack your planets in overwhelming numbers and you do not have
a realistic hope of recapturing it, it is most important to destroy the
energy storage units so that when you come to destroy the planet with your
planet destroyer and the aliens have built a planet shield you can destroy
the planet since you need twice as much energy as is contained in the planets
energy storage units (if you have demolished the energy storage units that
should be 20 energy units).
When you no longer have a use for the colony station on your colonized planets
it is a good idea to demolish them - this gives you 11 units of material and
1 more place to build things and the you still have the space for 4000 people
that you had before you demolished it. The aliens tend to build more objects
on their planets, the higher the difficulty level. On the easy level they
tend to build 4 objects - typically an alien central unit, a
nuclear power plant, a ground defence unit and a space port.
On the suicide level the maximum I have seen the aliens build, given time is 10
objects - an alien central unit, 2 nuclear power plants, 2 planet defence units,
a space port, 2 energy storage units, a planet shield and an
anti spy satellite antenna. This gives the aliens a maximum of 620 units of
energy and the alien central unit produces 24 units of material per turn
regardless of which difficulty level you are playing on.
Do not leave your spaceships in orbit around planets colonized by the aliens as
they will build tripods(alien troops) endlessly until you leave which can cause
problems later on if you decide to invade the planet with troops.

			    Colonizable Planets
It is difficult to say how many planets should be colonized to their full
capacity as it largely depends on how quickly you defeat the aliens and the
difficulty level you are  playing at.

Level	No. Of Planets To Colonize
Easy		1-2
Medium		 3
Hard		 4
Suicide 	5-6

The best planets to colonize are planets with the highest food and mineral
wealth (petrol and metals) though mineral wealth is more important since
greenhouses can be built to provide food but mining sites cannot be built.
There are two main ways to defeat the aliens - one is to invade their planets
with spaceships and troops (Very difficult and time consuming), two is to keep
building spaceships, and research until you reach Tech. level 9 and then build
a planet destroyer and destroy all the planets that the aliens have colonized
and then wipe out the aliens with your large fleet (Much,much less difficult and
much,much less time consuming). It is best to choose which of these methods you
are going to use near to the start of the game (needless to say I would
recommend the second method). If you choose the first method you will need to
build barracks - one or two per planet should be enough and troop transporters.
If you intend invading the alien planets with troops, you will need
approximately three or four times as many troops as there are tripods defending.
If you choose the second method you will need to build lots of
fusion power plants (6 or 7), 7 or more energy storage units and a
planet destroyer on the same planet - it is best to build these units on the
planet furthest away from where you think or know the aliens are so that it
takes more energy when you use the planet destroyer and that way if the aliens
have a planet shield you are more likely to destroy their planet. The most
important part of this game is that you can only ever build 35 objects on a
planet. But remember you can bulldoze them for the return of half of the
material it cost to build them. The bulldozer facility along with the increased
number of different constructions gives the game a lot more flexibility, this
means that the number and type of objects built on your planets will be
different from game to game. Always remember to demolish constructions on your
planets after they have ceased to be useful,especially irrigation units,
snow melting units and universities.
When tech level 5 is reached you should build fusion power plants and demolish
any energy collectors, coal power plants and nuclear power plants. If you use
method two, after you have destroyed all the alien's planets, the planet
destroyer, extra fusion power plants and extra energy storage units can be
demolished.

				Mothership
The mothership is a very powerful spaceship and the only ship capable of
repairing itself. Destroying it will stop the aliens colonizing other planets
but they can still wipe you out with combat ships and troops. When you have
built a planet scanner and think you have enough combat ships to protect your
planets try and find the mothership by sending some fighters to all of the
planets or you can just wait until it finds you and then track it with the
planet scanner and send enough ships to destroy it. (12-15 pulsar destroyers
(at Tech. level 8 or above) or equivalent should be sufficient) You will have
to chase the mothership from planet to planet as it usually moves, once it has
encountered resistance.
Do not attack the mothership with small numbers of ships as it will destroy
them and by the time you have attacked it again it will have repaired itself.

			       Spy Satellite
The only time when building a spy satellite is justified is if you use an
energy cannon to attack the alien planets. It is quite useful to be able to see
the result of your attack.

			     Technology levels

Tech. Level		  Discoveries				  Research
1	      Scan Beam Disturber And Anti Spy Satellite Antenna.    10
2	      Irrigation Unit,Exploration Ship And Spy Satellite.    20
3	      Snow Melting Unit And Cobra Ship. 		     40
4	      Pulsar Destroyer. 				     80
5	      Battlestar And Fusion Power Plant.		     160
6	      Planet Scanner And Stargate Ship. 		     320
7	      Energy Cannon.					     640
8	      Planet Shield.					     1280
9	      Planet Destroyer. 				     2560
10 and Above  Nothing Special.					     5120

Note: Stargate ships are discovered at Tech. level 6 NOT Tech. level 5 as may
be written in the colonial conquest manual.

		     Playing Against A Human Opponent
Playing against a human opponent is more difficult than against the aliens.
Humans can use energy cannon or planet destroyer against you.
The number and type of buildings built on your planets is roughly the same
as against the aliens but all of your planets should have universities,
because being the first to develop an energy cannon or planet destroyer can
accelerate victory. A planet shield is also advisable so there is less chance
of the above happening.
The planet scanner becomes a more useful piece of equipment. It can be used to
discover which planets your opponent has colonized because from time to time
spacecraft will move between the planets and it is likely that the busiest
planets will be colonized, it will at least tell you which area of the universe
is being colonized or explored.
Building spy satellites is still a waste of time and resources as your opponent
may have an anti spy satellite antenna and knowing what is happening on their
planets is not a major advantage, and you can only be 50% sure of the number of
spaceships in orbit around the planet.

			 Bugs,Anomalies And Stuff
When you start a new game the planet the computer allocates you can never be
explored for life forms.
When you build a food robot on grassland it gives you 3 units of food NOT 2
units as the help feature may display.
After the planet destroyer is used, it should self destruct afterwards, but if
you have enough energy you can take 2 or 3 shots with one planet destroyer in
the same turn by selecting the option more than once from the special commands
menu.
Colonial Conquest can be multitasked by pressing the left Amiga and A keys.
If you use the planet editor it is worth knowing that when you design your own
planet and come to save it and you use the 'GB' keymap you will need to press
the 'Z' key instead of the 'Y' key, to save it.
If you are using a mouse blanker on your system, then it may cause some problems
when you run Colonial Conquest.

				Food Robot
Only build food robots on the 2 most plentiful land types, and only enough
of them to feed the population taking in to account natural food sites.

				Greenhouse
On planets with few mining sites, greenhouses are best built on desert or
ice terrain but on planets with a lot of mining sites (more than can be
mined by your intended population size) build them on mining sites since 1
shield of material is also gained.

				  Granary
2 granaries per planet are best since this gives you a good supply of food
to sell to the empire in exchange for damaged combat ships.

			       Mining Robot
These are best built on sites were metals or petrol are present. When
enough food has been produced for the population and you have built all of
the structures you require, use the remaining mining sites to build as many
mining robots as possible.

			   Energy Storage Units
2 energy storage units per planet is a good idea especially if you intend
to to install a stargate ship when Tech. Level 6 is reached because stargates
now require energy to function. If you intend to build a planet scanner or
energy cannon on the planet, 2 energy storage units is fine, but if a
planet destroyer is built a minimum of 3 is needed to be able to fire from
reasonably long distance.

			     Energy Collector
	  Provides 2 units of energy. Not worth building at all.

			       City Complex
4 city complexes are best to give a population of 36,000 but on planets with
		  plentiful mining sites, 5 can be built.

			    Ground Defence Unit
Ground defence units can be omitted since the aliens rarely if ever attack
your planet with troops until many turns after they have captured it. If
you do build ground defence units they are very quickly destroyed if the
aliens attack.
				 Barracks
If you use method one, 1 or 2 barracks per planet is fine providing you
have or intend to, colonize additional planets, this does not strain the
resources of any one planets to much. If you use method two barracks are
obsolete.

			     Coal Power Plant
Provides 4 units of energy. Only worth considering when you first colonize
a planet and need more energy to build a city complex or you want to build
a high energy consuming construction (such as a planet destroyer) and you
do not have quite enough energy and you are sure that you won't need any
more energy.

			    Nuclear Power Plant
Provides 8 units of energy. Only worth building if you have a small number
of shields or you have not reached Tech. level 5, where-after you can then
build fusion power plants.

			    Fusion Power Plant
Provides 16 units of energy. As soon as these become available and you need more
energy to  build one. Remember you can always demolish energy collectors, coal
power plants and nuclear power plants. This not only gives you more space on
your planets but more energy production as well.

			     Snow Melting Unit
These are only really useful when you have a planet with a lot of ice terrain.
It would be best to colonize another planet, but if you do build one remember to
demolish it after it has changed the ice into grassland.

			      Irrigation Unit
These are only really useful when you have a planet with a lot of desert
terrain. It would be best to colonize another planet. If you do build one
remember to demolish it once it has changed the desert into grassland.

				University
 Only 1 per planet is needed. It can be omitted if you are pushed for room
	       or if you have universities on other planets.

			      Medical Centre
	  1 per planet is essential to stop viruses breaking out.

			       Energy Cannon
   Not really worth building as the alien planets have a maximum of 10
     constructions so your chances of hitting anything are quite slim.

			     Planet Destroyer
It takes 4 energy units, a long time to build and at least 700 energy units to
fire, but it is very useful to destroy the alien planets especially on the hard
and suicide levels since it is difficult to destroy all of their vast numbers of
spaceships, and destroying the alien planets stops them producing spaceships
and then you can build up a large fleet of combat spaceships and destroy them.

			       Planet Shield
The planet shield is no use at all when playing against the aliens as they do
not build energy cannons or planet destroyers.

			      Planet Scanner
This device uses 20 energy units for a short range scan and 50 energy units for
a long range scan. 1 per game is needed, which is best built on the most central
planet in the universe, since with a long range scan the movements of the alien
spaceships can be seen throughout most of the universe.

			    Scan Beam Disturber
     Not worth building since the aliens don't produce spy satellites.

			Anti Spy Satellite Antenna
     Not worth building as the the aliens don't build spy satellites.

				Space Port
		   1 per planet is absolutely essential.

				Colony Ship
It is best to build colony ships with 3 or 4 colonists aboard and establish
		colonies, as early in the game as possible.

			       Stargate Ship
Stargate ships should be built at your earliest opportunity when Tech. level 6
is reached. Stargates should be established at all of your colonized planets.
The distance between stargates does not effect the amount of energy needed to
make the jump. The amount of energy needed to make a stargate jump with each of
the different spaceships can be seen below:-

Type Of Spaceship	Energy needed for Stargate Jump
Fighter 			2
Transporter			3
Exploration Ship		4
Troop Transporter		4
Colony Ship			5
Dreadnought			7
Cobra Ship			12
Pulsar Destroyer		17
Stargate Ship			18
Battlestar			22

				Transporter
The best use for the transporter is to move between all of your planets, loading
and unloading food, material and energy as needed. It is especially useful for
collecting energy for a planet destroyer attack.

			     Exploration Ship
Build an exploration ship as soon as possible after Tech. level 2 is reached
and send it out with a couple of combat ships as backup to explore planets for
alien lifeforms and colonizable planets.

			     Troop Transporter
 Only worth building late on in the game if you have troops to transport.

			       Combat Ships
Fighters are only really worth building to protect exploration ships and to
explore the universe early on in the game for good colonizable planets.
It is difficult to say which combat ships are the best to build.
Dreadnoughts take less time and material to build and aren't that powerful.
Cobra Ships are take more time and material to build but are more powerful.
I find that Pulsar Destroyers and battlestars are best to build as they are
very powerful and give you more time to get reinforcements to a battle.

@remark C
When starting a new colony name it "Charlotte". This will allow you
to see all maps instantly, other European ports, check other county's
statistics, and gives you $50,000. When you access the other
countries european ports you can spend all there money, I did this by
recruiting loads of people, but you can buy anything.

If you rename your colony to some thing else you can then start
another colony called charlotte and get another $50,000. I started a
colony got 50000 then abandond (sp) it lot's of times and started the
game with 500,000.

east and enter the forest. At the crossroads take the upper trail and
head back west. When you arrive at the screen with the archer, go behind
the trees to avoid his arrows and then use the knife or hatchet to dispose
of him.

In the next screen you will come up against the Iroquois chief; use the
hatchet to kill him, and then take the necklace and skin. Go back to the
last crossroads and climb the mountain, being careful not to fall off the
edge (it's advisable for you to save the game at the peak). Pick up the
nuggets at the top of the mountain, and then climb all the way back down
and return to the first crossroads. Go east from the crossroads until you
come across another archer. To kill him, hide in the first recess and
cause him to shoot an arrow by moving diagonally backwards and forwards,
then place yourself in his line of sight, make a jump and take cover in
the second recess. Cause the archer to fire another arrow and then use
the knife or hatchet to kill him. Be careful of the jump in the next
screen, and then carry straight on.

*** Mac Biggle

Swap the nuggets, skin and necklace with him, and if necessary, drink
a potion. Now continue walking east and climb to the end of the blind
alley.

*** The Canyon of Death

Climb up, avoid the Apaches and then continue east; take care at the
jump. On the other side you will be attacked by two Apaches; use the
gun to dispose of these two, and then save the game. Continue on the
lower road until you get to the next screen. As soon as you enter, move
into the recess and reload your gun. Foolow the archer into firing at
you, then move back out of the recess and shoot him; walk east. Kill the
Apache you come across with either the knife or hatchet. Do the same in
the next screen, and then walk east again. Yet again, take care on the
two jump, and after you have got to the other side, reload the gun.

Use the gun as soon as you enter the next screen, and the use the axe or
knife to get rid of the Apache chief. Change the powder horn (freeing one
icon), pick up the necklace and the peace-pipe. Go back to the fork and
take the staircase; at the top of the stairs reload the gun, and as soon
as you arrive in the next screen use it; reload the gun once more, shoot
the next Apache you come across and then use the axe or knife to finish
him off.

*** Music

Drop the peace-pipe in front of the Hopi chief and swap it for the silver
bullet. Return to the first room in the canyon, make two left turns and
pick up the nuggets, then return to the forest.

*** Mac Biggle

Trade the nuggets and the necklaces, drink a potion and return to the
canoe.

*** Big Bear Forest

Take a right turn twice and then prepare to fight the first of the big
bears. There are three methods that can be used but the best way is
third method. Firstly, you can kill the bear with a stick of dynamite
and one bullet; secondly, you can use one complete powder charge; lastly
is to fight him with the knife. After you have defeated the bear, go
right for two passages, take the passage at the back to save the game,
and then come back to the second passage (in front of the tree on the
right) and cross the field of rabbits. When you fight the wolf the best
thing to do is to hit it immediately with a low blow from the axe,
otherwise you will have to go back a place in order to let the wolf pass
in front of you so you can give it a low blow with the axe or you can
simply avoid it by not moving in a straight line.
Continue right, and pick up the nugget.

*** The Gang Down the Mine

Throw the dynamite into the pile of rocks, then reload your gun and shoot
the miner. Now select the knife or axe and strike at the miner who will
then run away. Start moving right and when you get to the blind alley
kill the miner you find there. Follow Huck through the mine where a
passage will open up (NB - if there is a tree icon, you can pick up a
nugget in the room to the right of the secret passage room); take this
passage and at the first fork take the trail at the back. Go over a jump
and at the second fork take the door at the bottom. Reload the gun,
shoot the miner and then finish him off.

Go to the second fork and take the door at the back, reload the gun, and
on entering the room, take a few steps forward and shelter in the recess.
Make the Old Timer shoot, then use the gun in the low position to deal
with him.

Take, and then read the parchment (drop it afterwards). Go right and
throw the dynamite into the pile of rocks, then go to the peak where you
can save.

Return to the first fork and go through the lower door; kill the miner
with the gun, knife or axe. In the next room advance gradually, and when
you hear the waggon, take a diagonal step into the recess (pick up the
nugget if the icon is available), and then carry on right and kill the
miner. Continue right and you will come across the head of the miners; if
you still have some dynamite left use it on him, otherwise use the gun
and knife or axe. Pick up the large nugget and return to the forest, and
to the canoe.

*** In Cheyenne Country

Right (twice) - jump over the fire, turn right. Pick up skin (if the icon
is not available, put down the object, pick up water skin, swap it at
Biggle's store for gunpowder, change the powder horn, pick up object you
put down). First fork: take the upper road.

*** Mac Biggle

Swap the nuggets and the big nugget. Right, second fork: take the one
at the back behind the tents. Make sign of peace to the medicine-man,
then find out what the parchment says. Go back to the first fork, take
the lower road in front of the tent. Fight the giant in the same way as
you did the bear. Go right, make the sign of peace to Chief Two Moons,
find out what the parchment says; return to the canoe.

*** Terror in the Woods

Move right (four times), kill an Indian, right, Mac Biggle, kill the chief
and take the necklace and skin.

*** Mac Biggle

Swap the necklace and skin. The silver bullet and potions can be left
there; the powder horn can be swapped and you can drink a potion.
Return to the third room in the forest and take the passage at the
back to the right of the rock. Climb the mountain and fight the indian
(you can avoid him but be careful of the sheer drop). Archer in the next
room: reload the gun beforehand, crouch down on entering, cause the archer
to shoot an arrow with standing/crouching action, then use the gun. Jump
and then right.

*** The Medallion of Courage

Return to Chief Two Moons and put down the papoose. Recover the
medallion. Take canoe at the beginning of the camp go back to the forest.
Move back up the mountain; save in the cave and leave the cave by the
right. Keep on going right killing all animals you encounter.

*** Two Moon's Son

At the foot of the peak, save and then climb the mountainside to the
level of the sticks. Climb and at the top fight the condor. Take the
papoose. Return to the mine; return to the cave using the lift. Go back
down the mountain, pick up the silver bullet you had put down. In the
second room in the forest, use the pasage behind the large bush. Left,
reload the gun and kill the indian using either of your weapons. Right,
jump, right.

*** In the Kingdom of the Dead

Save again. Passage behind the burial-place on the right. Note the
contents of the parchment, go right, pass in front again and to the right.
Kill two wolves, right. To kill the lone wolf, load the gun with the
silver bullet, take two steps to the right then use the gun, shooting low.
Because you have the medallion you will not be hurt by the Great Spirit;
take the canoe.

*** Powhatan's cave

Save your position. Take the right blind alley and climb at the bottom.
If you take the right, kill the bear with the dynamite and the gun or in
the traditional way. Return to the left and choose the barrel on the
extreme left (move back to avoid the blast of the explosion); the Passage
of the Great Cross is open. Left and take the lift. Return to the mine.
Go back to the fork then go to the back to return to the peak.

*** Pocahonta's gold mine

Right, place the medallion in front of chief, the passage open, and that's
it - you've completed Colorado!

The End!

Complete Solution:

There are several 'random' elements within this adventure, so it is not
possible to indicate EXACTLY where or when they occur. The best thing
to do is follow the procedures, detailed in these preliminary notes, to
deal with each problem as and when it arises.

* The first Dwarf you meet will throw an axe or small knife at you. It
  always misses the first time. Ignore the knife but get the axe. From
  then on, when you meet a Dwarf, throw the axe and take it again. One
  throw will usually suffice but you may have to repeat the action.

* When you have some treasures the Pirate will rob you. To retrieve
  them (also the chest, which is itself a necessary treasure) go to the
  West End of the Hall of Mists. Now follow these directions EXACTLY:

  South, East, South, South, South, North-East, East, North-West

  You will now have found the chest containing your stolen treasure.
  Take the chest AND your stolen treasures and proceed EXACTLY as
  follows:

  South-East, North, Down, East, East, Say 'Xyzzy'

  You are now back at the Small Brick Building. deposit the chest and
  treasures and resume where you left off. The Pirate will not return.

* When you are told that the lamp is flickering, this is a warning
  that the batteries need replacing. Go back to the Small Brick Building
  and Get The Coins. 'Say Plugh' and then 'On Lamp' then proceed EXACTLY
  as follows:

  South, South, Up, West, West, West, West, West, South, East, East,
  Climb

  You will now have found the Vending Machine and you should 'DROP
  COINS'. The machine will dispense new batteries and your lamp is
  automatically 'recharged'. Now proceed:

  North, Up, East, East, East, East, East, Down, North, North, Off Lamp,
  Say 'Plugh'

  You are now back at the Small Brick Building. As the coins were a
  necessary treasure, this procedure will deduct TEN points from your
  final score!	This solution cuts a few unnecessary corners out, and
  fully utilises ON/OFF LAMP and the magic words: PLUGH, PLOVER and XYZZY
  to reduce the chances of needing replacement batteries.

* The 'Endgame' will materialise when ALL treasures have been collected
  and shortly after you are informed that the 'Caves are closing'.

* Finally, each time you 'SAVE' your position, ONE point is deducted
  from your score.

The message of the Rose: Love is my shield

AND MAYBE THIS WILL HELP YOU.......
The language of the flowers.
From the earliest days of civilization, flowers have been given special
meanings. For example, the rose has a long association with love,
sexuality and with many goddesses, the virgin mary, and the science of
alchemy. Not only the flower itself, but often the color indicated what
significance was attached to it. There are many legends of flowers
springing up where drops of blood or tears fell to the ground. What
follows is a list of flowers and their meanings.

Almond blossom - hope
Anemone - afterthought
Buttercup - memories of childhood
Carnation - heart
Columbine - folly
Yellow chrysanthemum - slighted love
White chrysanthemum - truth
Cornflower - celibacy (NUN & PRIEST)
Daffodil - death
Forget-me-not - true love
Hyacinth - sport, game, or play
White lily - purity
Yellow lily - falsehood
Orchid - seduction
Blue periwinkle - early friendship
White periwinkle - pleasures of memory
Red poppy - consolation
Scarlet poppy - fantastic extravagance
Snowdrop - hope or consolation
Sunflower - haughtiness
Red tulip - declaration of love
Yellow tulip - hopeless love
Violet - lust

You only need to answer three, so there is a good chance you will get
 a lot of the questions. Now that you have answered these three riddles
 you will be set free and teleported before the ice.

Now go back west two screens to the map and go to Southhampton.
Talk to the man near the boat.
Ask the man about Galahad and ASK ABOUT PRICES.

She will tell you to go to the house with the crescent and moon next.
She will give you also a strength apple. (Keep it for later)
Now go to the big house with the star and the crescent.
Say no to all your seductions. (Hard, isn't it!)
Talk to her and then ask her about things such as Galahad, the grail,
 and the test.
After you ask about the test, she will open the door for you.
First you must give your purse.

(THAT DOES SOUND FAMILIAR?)
Go through the door to take the test.
REMEMBER THE SYMBOLS that Al Sirat gave you, and you'll pass this test.
THIS IS VERY TRICKY!
Fatima will tell you if you pass the test.
Now go to the Hierophant.
The Hierophant is the old beggar who you gave the charcoals to.
Talk to him and ask him to open the catacombs.
He will do that and give you an elixir.
To find your way around in the catacombs, use the lodestone.
Now go around the catacombs and look at the murals.
Keep looking around until you find a childs mummy with a medallion on it.
Go to the right of the mummy and use your sword to get the medallion.
Now go to the sarcophagus and read the inscription on it.
Go to the open part of the sarcophagus and get the golden apple.
Now you should easily find Galahad.
Give Galahad the elixir that you got from the Hierophant.
You should get bitten by a rat right now, but don't worry.
Just continue on,but hurry now.
Now look around for the statue of Aphrodite.
Put the golden apple in the palm of her hand.

The answers to the questions are:

Q: Who was dragged to death behind his chariot?
A: Hippopolytus

Q: In the kingdom of Flora what represented fertility and is sacred to
   Aphrodite?
A: Apple

Q: What is Aphrodites sacred number?
A: Six

Q: In the kingdom of Fauna what represented fertility and is sacred to
   Aphrodite?
A: Dove

Q: Who ended the dispute between Aphrodite and Persephone about Adonis?
A: Zeus

Q: What is the name of the king who was the father of Hippolytus?
A: Theseus

After you answered all of her questions, she will give you directions
 on how to get out of the catacombs and a dove. Write down all the
 directions she give you.
When the secret doors opens use the lodestone determine which doors to
 take.
The lodestone always points north.
Follow the directions, and then take the stairs out.
Don't forget to take a look at the dead warriors skull.

Now get to the temple.
Walk all around the temple and check it out.
When you encounter the Saracen, eat the strength apple.
Put on the helmet that Saracen gives you.
Now fight the thing.

If you die of poison at any time in this whole area, then you have
 wasted too much time, so restore to the part where you get bitten and
 do everything more quickly.

After you beat the Saracen, use the dove.
Follow the dove until Aphrodite appears.
Listen to what she says.
Then ask Merlin about the spiral.
Now go to the spiral.
When you are facing the spiral on the inside of the temple.
Now move to the left and count the spaces of the remains of the pillars
 until you get to the 6th one.
The secret is...Count the empty hole too!
Push the 6th pillar, and voila!!!
Now get the grail.
The grail will be stolen by a thief when you get it.
Chase the thief down the stairs and into the alley.
He will be trapped in the alley.
You can kill the thief or show mercy to him.
Grab the grail and you are done.

Thats all folks!

Press <P> to pause the game and use the correct keys held down together to
make "SMURF", or type "ASTRA GTE", after this press
	<1> for 999 lives or
	<2> for 999 units of ammunition.
To unpause press <P>. Pressing <F1> and <F2> will now reimburse both player's
lives.

Tips:
Supplies of ammunition come in two forms : 20 shots either for cannon or
machine gun so don't go out of your way to collect extra bullets unless
ammo levels are low.
Transportation tiles make machine gun soldiers appear frequently. 'Hug'
the walls as often as possible. Also do not move off the end of a wall
while someboby is firing at you, or you will be shot. Electric doors are
operated from a distance-watch for men on the other side.
On later levels (8+), men will appear from nowhere (teleportation
devices possibly) - be on your guard! Cannon is more affective than gun as
it passes through men, dead useful for racking up the bonuses caused by
multiple guards standing behind each other when a cannon fires. Use
diagonal movement to move that bit faster towards cars, barriers, buildings
(or anything else that provides cover from enemy fire).

Level 1 (3 bombs to plant)
Nice and easy level to start with. Just watch for the men standing guard.
Go along the top to avoid the lower generators where the enemy tends to
hang out.

Level 2 (3 bombs to plant)
Again very simple look out for men appearing from inside cars as there
are quite a few along the top. Try to stay along the bottom. Smart bomb
the group of men by the exit for convenience and to save lives (yours!).

Level 3 (3 bombs to plant)
Watch the acid! And also the machine gun guards near the exit. Take a
wide berth past the flame throwing guard, his long range fire isn't nice-
hug the bottom if you can and then sneak up the side to the last bomb
area and exit.

Level 4 (4 bombs to plant)
Here are some electric doors to play with; just watch for men on the other
side! Also plenty of men appear using the tiles near the exit. Run
diagonally straight up to the exit and pray (judicious use of smartbombs
is recommended.)

Level 5 (5 bombs to plant)
Five bombs to place so waste no time. Like level 2, watch for the men in
cars. To get over the moving floor simply walk along the wall as the floor
starts to close. You can get past the wrecking balls without too much
problem providing that the nearby guards have been eliminated.

Level 6 (5 bombs to plant)
Plenty of guards to blast you now in long corridoors (useful to have a
cannon ready for this level). Hug the wall edges when sneaking up on
guards and use the boxes for cover. Watch for chasms and machine gun guards
covering crosses on the far side. Also groups of guards just over the
bridges.

Level 7 (4 bombs to plant)
There are a lot of touch sensitive cracks in this level's floor. You can
see where the ground is cracked so best avoid altogether: Taking the
lower route is generally best as there are less holes to avoid. On this
level Kung-Fu men appear to attack, they just need a touch to kill you!
Shoot the controls to open the bridge.

Level 8 (6 bombs to plant)
More electric doors to contend with. Rather simple stuff really but the
level is quite long winded, and can prove a long haul if you don't use the
map to remember the correct route through. Time is tight so don't stop to
admire the view and from this level, men start appearing from nowhere so
be on your guard!

Level 9 (4 bombs to plant)
Time for the conveyor belts. Just move the joystick the other way to stop
movement, try to cross the belts at the edge of the area where the belt
emerges from the wall. There are 5 men guarding the third cross, so be
careful. Also there are men on the exits so a smart-bomb or two comes in
handy.

Level 10 (5 bombs to plant)
A very dangerous level, as men appear frequently and you can easily be
caught in crossfires. Stay alert and keep on the move, hugging the walls
when cornered. Once again there are guards on the exit so bomb them.

Level 11 (5 bombs to plant)
This is easy compared to the previous one! Using the radar watch where
guards are on the other side of the groups of conveyor belts. Stick to
the sides when crossing the last set of 4 conveyor belts. Also, there is
an ambush over the bridge so either arm up with cannon or smar-bombs.

Level 12 (4 bombs to plant)
Men stationed practically everywhere so keep that trigger finger pumping!
To use the moving platforms over the acid, just push right (or left) and
hold it there to walk over. The last area is a simple maze, but the
fencing is deadly to the touch close up. Take your time, better to arrive
at the exit late than never at all!

Level 13 (5 bombs to plant)
The cannons fire randomly when you're in range so quickly sneak round the
corners and move down out of the line of fire to nip past the cannons,
when possible.

Level 14 (10 bombs to plant)
Things get tough with ten bombs to plant in the men-makin machine level,
so there is no time to stop! The bubbles are harmless, the men aren't.

Level 15 (5 bombs to plant)
The middle is a long maze, with men appearing all over the shop so hug
those walls! For the lasers the sequence of blasts is: 1 down, 2 down,
3 down, 4 down, 8 up, 7 up, 6 up, and then 5 up before repeating. Time it
well or else!

Level 16 (0 bombs to plant)
The final level and you'll be pleased to hear that there are no bombs to
plant! Trouble is you've got to time it well to get through the mesh
doors. Go in the middle and run through just as they start opening
(without stopping). You should make it. For the conveyor belts stay in the
middle watching for guards as you move across. Then it is plain sailing to
the end!

You start in your room. You have been accused of murdering someone you
never met, and you must prove your innocence. EXAMINE the BACKPACK, you
will find a RECORDER, a CASSETTE and HEADPHONES. Get out of your room
(E), and go downstairs to the Dining Room (N-N-N-S-E). OPEN the KITCHEN
Door, and enter (N). SHOW GREENBACK (Cash) to Alex, he will sell you a
BOTTLE OF WINE and you will get some COINS. Get out of the KITCHEN, CLOSE
the kitchen door and USE COINS with JUKEBOX to create some noise. Now you
can enter Alex's room to the NORTH-EAST. Take the SECURITY-KEY there and
go to the CLOSET Room (SW-W-S). Use the SECURITY-KEY on the door to the
left and enter the CLOSET (W). Take the FLASHLIGHT and the TOOLKIT. You
are now ready for some fun :-)

LET'S DO SOME DAMAGE
Get out of the CLOSET and go to the SHOWER#1 on this floor (E-N-W). You
find the shower is not to your taste, so you USE the TOOLKIT on the SHOWER
and wreck it! Your character will go tell the hotel manager that there is
a wrecked shower and you find yourself in the RECEPTION. EXAMINE the
POSTER and the GUESTBOOK in the RECEPTION. Get back to the SHOWER (N-N-W)
and you will find that the manager left his master key there, TAKE GENERAL
KEY, it will open almost all the doors in the hotel. You are now free to
wander around the first floor. When you figure out that there is nothing
to do on this floor, you proceed upstairs. Once upstairs, use the GENKEY
on the door to the West of the staircase and enter the TEL# room. EXAMINE
the PHONE, your character will remember the hotel's phone number for you.
Time to take a shower, get out of the room and to the shower on this floor
(E-S-E-SE) and ACTIVATE the SHOWER. you will discover a small piece of
paper on your shoes, and you will find yourself back in your room...

BACK IN YOUR ROOM
You are back in your room but you have a feeling that there is more to
this shower than meets the eye, so you decide to go back and take a look
(E-N-E-SE). When you get in, you find Gwendoline taking a shower, ooooo!
Don't talk to her! Instead, now that the Young's have left their room
(you'll find the husband in the Men's room) you can go in and satisfy your
pervert little mind :-)

LETS DO SOME RECORDING
You get out of the shower, and USE GENKEY on the door to the East.
Enter the Young's room. TAKE the SHEETS, USE CASSETTE on RECORDER,
ACTIVATE RECORDER and hide it under the bed with USE RECORDER with BED.
Ah, you just can't wait! :-) Leave the room and leave the door unlocked,
the Youngs will think that the maid came and picked up the sheets. While
you're in this corridor, use the GENKEY on the NORTH door and enter the
Baumanns' room. USE the SCISSORS with the SHEETS and you will make a
ROPE; this will be useful soon. Get out of the room and lock the door
behind you (USE GENKEY again on the North door). Now you need to move
around a bit and let the Youngs alone :) Let's go downstairs and up again
(W-N-N-N-S-E), you are back in front of the Youngs, and the RECORDER is
lying on the floor. TAKE RECORDER, ACTIVATE it to turn it off, and OPEN
RECORDER to take out the tape. you need something to listen to that tape!

THESE FAKE RUSSIANS
Get out the corridor and go the the SE room (W-S-S). Use the GENKEY on
the South-East door, and enter the room. EXAMINE the NIGHTSTAND, you will
find a WALKMAN and some BULLETS. Time to do some prank calls!! But
first, let's give the Russian chess player a lesson :-) Go back into the
corridor and enter the Southern room. Talk to the Russian and ACTIVATE
the CHESSBOARD on HIM. You'll beat him and he'll leave the room crying,
hahaha! Take the CHESSMAG and read it. Get out of the room and back in
again; SHOW that fake the CHESSMAG and have him beg for mercy!

THE BASEMENT
Enough fun with that guy. Go back to the shower and wreck it with the
TOOLKIT (N-N-E-SE-USE TOOLKIT ON SHOWER). Once again, your character will
go to the reception and complain that there is a wrecked shower -This is
fun ;) You are now all alone in the RECEPTION! Use the GENKEY on the East
door and enter the manager's room. EXAMINE the NIGHTSTAND, you will find
a COMBINATION. Now, you need to occupy that manager before he comes back.
Here's what you will do: USE CASSETTE w/ WALKMAN, USE HEADPHONES w/
WALKMAN, ACTIVATE WALKMAN, USE PHONE with WALKMAN. You dial the hotel's
number and the manager picks up in some room! You are now free to explore
the basement while he listens attentively to the Youngs having fun! Go
back in the RECEPTION, and EXAMINE the CARPET. You will find a TRAPDOOR,
OPEN the TRAPDOOR, ACTIVATE the FLASHLIGHT, and USE ROPE on TRAPDOOR.

THE JAPANESE GUY
Ahhhh, the TV cable! Ah-Ah! Once you are in the basement, TAKE the
ANTENA-CABLE, you will pull it out. ACTIVATE the ROPE to get back up,
CLOSE the TRAPDOOR, ACTIVATE the FLASHLIGHT to turn it off and go back in
the manager's room to retrieve the WALKMAN. ACTIVATE the WALKMAN to turn
it off, OPEN WALKMAN to take out the tape, get out of the manager's room
and USE GENKEY on the door to lock it behind you. Go back to the Dining
Room, you will meet the Japanese guy there (N-N-E). SHOW him the BOTTLE
OF WINE, he will get drunk and he will give you a BUILDING KIT. Hmmmm, no
instructions, darn. I bet they are in the Jap's room! Go back upstairs
to his room (W-N-N-S-S) and use the GENKEY on the East door. Enter the
room and TAKE the MANUAL.

THE DEAD GUY
Now is a good time to take a look at the guy you've supposedly murdered.
Get out of the Jap's room and go to the electronically locked one (W-N).
USE the COMBINATION on the LOCK and enter the room. TAKE the GUN and
EXAMINE the DEAD BODY, you will find a special LIGHTER. USE the GUN with
the AMMUNITION to load it and USE the LIGHTER on the PIECE OF PAPER, it
will turn into a FORMULA. You're almost home free!

LETS RECORD SOME MORE!
Go back to the Youngs' room (E-E), and once again use the GENKEY to open
the door -What a useful little key. Let's do some more recording, you
liked that first tape ;-) USE the MANUAL on the BUILDING KIT, it will turn
into a SENDER and a RECEIVER. USE the TOOLKIT on the PHONE to take it
appart and USE SENDER on the PHONE. You have placed the bug into the
phone, get out of the Young's room and go back in the Shower (W-SE). USE
the CASSETTE with RECORDER, USE HEADPHONES with RECORDER, ACTIVATE the
RECORDER and USE the RECEIVER with it...

THERE'S NOTHING LIKE RUSSIAN SLANG
Your receiver picks up a very interesting conversation between Russian
spies, and your recorder is faithfully taping the whole thing! You now
have all the evidence you need to clear your name (No, you'll never be
able to convince anyone that you're not a drunk, but that's another
story). Don't you think it's time to use that nice GUN? Get out of the
shower and back into the Youngs room! Your GAY friend will meet you there!

	- PART I -
Dungeon
=======
1)Okie Dokie, call `help' and the guard will appear and shout at you. He
drops a key on the way out. Pick up the key and unlock the chains. Now,
take a closer look at the back wall where the water is dripping out,
pull the mortar and you'll discover a paper clip. Now insert the paper
clip into the lock to pick the lock open.
Corridor
=======
2)Pick up the goldfish bowl off the table and make your way through the
corridor.Be careful, along the corridor are statues which whack you on
the head with huge mallets! On the way try to collect the gems scattered
on the floor and the coin on the table. These are only collected for
extra points.Exit through the door at the end of the corridor.
Lakebed
=======
3)Wear the goldfish bowl so you can breathe and then walk over to the fish
stuck in the railings. Pull the fish free. Walk along for a bit until
you discover some mud on the ocean floor.Look at the mud and a worm will
appear, pick it up. Now, go to Mr. Fish's Shop and give him the worm, in
exchange he'll fill your goldfish bowl up with oxygen.
4)Now, keep on moving until you see the electric eels, at this point the
fish you freed before will drop an oyster. Pick up the oyster and give it
to the turtle, you will now carry you over the eels.
5)Once over the eels pick up the cattle prod and continue walking. When the
sharks come towards you attack them with the cattle prod, keep on doing
this until you reach a giant clam. Wait until the clam is closed and
jump over it. Insert the cattle prod into the plughole and you'll get
sucked down.
Pool Room
=========
6)Walk over to the bottom right of the screen and look around until you
find some seaweed. Go up to the wall and push the protruding rock to
reveal a secret entrance.
Cave Corridors
==============
7)While you're wandering around the corridors pick up as many rocks as
you can and give them to the rock basher in the rock basher room. Also,
you need to find a gold coin, it's by one of the entrances..it glints so
you shouldn't have any trouble finding it.
Rock Basher Room
================
8)Give the rock basher all 18 rocks (three of each size) you won't be able
to collect them all at once so you will have to go back. The rock basher
will then give you a piece of string.
Seesaw Room
===========
9)Pick up the plank and attach it to the boulder. Now, you'll need to collect
the monitor from another cave. Throw the monitor on the plank to catapult
yourself on the ledge, pick up the magnet and jump down.
10)Go back to the room where you found the monitor and attach the string to
the magnet. Then throw the magnet down the hole and you should now get
a roll of wire attached to it.
11)Go to the corridor where the mud monster is (it's outside the rock basher
room) and attach the wire to the loops. When the mud monster charges
past, some mud will be left on the wire. Pick up the mud.
Holey Room
==========
12)Alright, you will able to see a number of holes in the walls of the cave.
Look in the holes until you discover a little monster peering out of one
of the other holes. Look in the hole it comes out of and it should then
appear from another hole, look in that hole and so on until you find some
twigs.
Well Room
=========
13)Throw the coin into the well and a gameshow host appears, he'll offer you
three prizes; money, a beautiful woman or a helmet. Now I know this is NOT
my first choice or my second for that matter but take helmet. Now, go to
the corridor where the rocks are falling and wear the helmet.
Bucket Room
===========
14)Jump in the bucket and attach the mud to the seaweed, then attach the
twigs to the mud and the seaweed. Don't question me, just do it! Now all
you have to do is wear the mask.

	- PART II -
Bridge
======
1) A pirate will try to rob you as you walk towards the bridge. As he
falls over pick up the sword and attack him with it. Pick up the bag of
money.
The Village
===========
2) Go to the Mages Shop shop.Give the magician some money and he'll teleport
you to a cliff edge.
Cliff
=====
3) Walk along the cliffs edge and pick up the gloves in the first alcove you
come across. (just after the falling little monsters)
4) Walk next to the boulder and push it, then jump over the boulder. Be
careful, there is a large boulder which falls on you just after you've
jumped across.
5) Next, you'll see four buttons on the wall. Push the buttons in this order,
button 1, 2 and 4 - this will cause a bridge to appear.
6) Walk over the bridge and pick up the rope. Walk next to the blue guy and
wear the gloves, you'll automatically push him off allowing you to get
past.
7) This bit is a bit tricky, wait until the rocks stop falling and walk to
the first alcove. Wait until the rocks stop falling again and then walk
to the next alcove and pick up the chewing gum.
8) Now, walk on until you reach a gap. Wear the chewing gum to catch a rock
which falls on your head. Throw the rock, then walk across the stone slab
which you've knocked down.
9) When you come to the next huge gap throw the rope and then jump on rope
to climb across. Once you reached the other side look at the carving on
the wall and continue walking until you reach the end of the cliff edge,
shout `open sesame'. Walk into the cave and talk to the parrot.
Village
======
10)Go and visit Sally See All and give her some money to tell your fortune.
11)Go to Benn's Costume Shop and give him some money, he'll give you a
dress, walk into the changing room and try on the dress. Walk through the

3)Once inside the palace pick up the brush.Pick up the dice on the table and
throw them. Each time you throw the dice different doors will open in the
corridor. The diagram below will help you complete this part of the game.

of the corridor. Now, a whistle should appear just in front of the door.Pick
it up and attach it to the cone. Click on the defend icon, and then on the
instrument to blow it and break the glass. Jump through the window.
Laser Room
==========
7)There are four holes on the floor, place the icicle, glass, magnifying
glass and the ice cube in the same positions as below to reflect the beam
and destroy the laser i.e attach magnifying glass to hole number one.

		Hole	Object

When she turns yellow in colour she's about to fire, all you have to do
is jump up to avoid them.
Hand
====
10)When the big meaty hand grabs you, just wear the sun tan lotion to slip
through its fingers to escape!
Maze
====
11)Make your way through the maze, making sure to pick up the box of matches
on your way.
Troll
=====
12)Okie dokie, this bit is a bit tricky and I advise you to use the joystick
to control him. O.k move behind the pillar in the middle of the room so
the troll can't see you...the troll should now fall asleep.
13)Walk over to the troll, be careful not to stand on any loose tiles as
they'll make a noise and wake up the troll. The route I found to be the
easiest is to go up around the pillar and straight across the room.
14)Attach the match to the troll's foot and then click on the defend icon
and then on the matchbox to light the match.Pick up the fire extinguisher
and Benn will appear and take you back to the village.

	- PART III -
Village
=======
1) Go to the Mage's shop and give him some money, in exchange he'll give you
a pig mask.

Valley Of The Lost
==================
3) Look behind the haystack to discover a piece of straw. Walk left to the
erupting volcano and pickup the tray. Be careful not to be fried by the
falling lava.
4) Go to the nose and insert piece of straw into it to make him sneeze. Now
that you got rid of the nose look at the pile at the bottom of the
screen, pick up the fountain pen and the stamp.
5) Walk on over to the pile of washing and pick up the sock.
6) Go to the pile of tapes next to the shipwreck and pick up a blank tape.
Walk over to the huge pile of gold and attach the gold coin to the sock.
7) Now, go to the screen where there was a pair of lips and pick up the
remote control.
8) Go back to the letter box and pick up the letter. Attach the stamp to the
letter and post the letter. Go the tape recorder and insert the tape
into it. Make sure you're standing close to the machine and push/pull
the remote control.
9) Now, go to the guy with the ghetto-blaster and give him the tape, he'll
give you a magnetic keycard and disappear. Go into the cave and stand by
the far wall, shout `help' and pick up the bottle.
10)Alright, go to the locked door next to the band and insert the keycard
into the slot.
11)Now, this bit is a tiny bit tricky and might be easier with the joystick.
Notice the bag at the left of the screen, well all you have to do to get
it is use the wind to blow you towards it. Walk left towards the bag
until the wind starts to blow you back, then move right until the wind
starts to blow you back again, this time you should be able to get close
enough to the bag to pick it up.
12)Remember the robot guarding the shipwreck? Go up to him and hit him
with the sock filled with gold.
13)This bit is very hard to explain through text alone but here it goes.
Pick up one of the planks and walk to the middle of the screen, as close
to the waters edge as possible... you'll have to be pixel accurate with
this but the place you should be standing, roughly, is where the sand
starts to dip inwards in a curved shape. Push/pull plank and our hero
should lay the plank horizontally ACROSS the sand-if he lays the plank
down vertically towards you you're in the wrong spot. Once you've laid
the first plank correctly pick up the second plank, stand in the middle
of the first plank. Push/pull plank and he'll lay the plank across the
water to the other side allowing you to cross. Cross the plank and
pick up the rag near the bag of the ship.
14)Go back to the screen where the cave is and a door will appear, walk
through it.
15)Stand by the patch on the wall at the top, throw the bottle and
then push/pull the rag to reveal a button. Push the button to raise the
gate. Walk up to the circuit board and throw the bag.Throw the tray and
once you're over the circuit board pick up the fan and pick the lock
with the paper clip. Make your way to the village.

attack him with the shovel.
6)Now, he'll re-appear behind a tombstone, push the tomb on him. Go back to
the left side of the graveyard and pick up the garlic bread.
7)Make your way to the gates (to the right side of the graveyard). The
vampire will appear in front of the arch, eat the garlic bread.

@remark CHS
Same cheat as in @{"Pool of Radiance" LINK "CheatCollectionE.04.guide/Pool of Radiance"}.

In case anyone was wondering, The 'Wizard in Red' refers to Dracandros.
He is the owner of the Crescent Moon bond. The 'Woman in Green' refers
to the leader of the Cultists of Moander. They, of course, are the
owners of the Mouth in the Hand bond, which is the symbol of the God
Moander. The 'Lord of the Black' refers to the leader of the Zhentrim,
or 'Black Network', an evil alliance of priests, mages and thieves
that operate out of Zhentil Keep. They own the big 'Z' in the Triangle
bond. Lastly, 'The Flamed One' is, of course, good old Tyranthraxus.
He owns the Flaming Bond, which is the Symbol of Tyranthraxus.

To defeat Tyranthraxus, you must gather the Amulet of Lathander, which
is in Zhentil Keep, the Helm of Dragons, which is currently being kept
by Dracandros in his castle near Haptooth, and the Gauntlet of Moander,
which is kept by Mogion (the Woman in Green!) in Yulash.
You must take these items to the Pool of Radiance.

Solution:

Bond 1: The Fire Knives
The first thing you should do after creating your characters is to go to
the armoury and the general store. Get your characters equipped as best as
possible. Also visit the High priest of the temple of Gond and the Sage Filani.
Also go to the tavern, wait there having drinks etc.. until the tavern keeper
asks you to leave. Leave, go to the side entrance, then got to the front and
enter the tavern again. To explain what just happened, Princess Nacacia just
got abushed by the Fire Knives as she tried to enter the tavern. Stay in the
tavern if you need some info. Go to the Inn (where u start) and rest, Memorise
spells etc.. If you transfered Pools of Radiance or Hillsfar Characters then
first get them to train, in the hall. Now you will soon be starting the chase
for the Fire Knives. Go North, and head west just after the general store and
you should automatically get into a fight with the purple guard. While you were
fighting, The fire knives have nicked Giogi Wyvernspur from The carriage. After
you defeat the guards (Its your first fight, You DID defeat them didnt you?),
Either surrender or run down the nearest alley. The Thieves Guild will send
someone to get you out. The guild master gives you a sewers map and the Fire
Knives attack. Kill them off and head south to the sewers. You should go to the
vault on this level because it contains quite a few magical items as well as
some coins. (I've also done maps for the game and they can be found in another
archive. They aren't nessecary to complete it, but they do show the important
places in each dungeon saving you from going everywhere.). Go South through the
sewers and youl come across three seperate exits in the southernmost end wall.
Two are normal doors, One is a secret door. There is also a secret Training
Hall somewhere is the South East of the sewers. After exiting the sewers There
are only a few places to go that are of any real interest. One is the armoury
in south, as there are a few Magic Items here. However the most interetsting
place is the South West corner where you get your bond removed and meet
Nacacia, Azoun, Vandergahast and last and least Giogi. Before this however,
you should rescue The Cleric, Gharri, from the torture chamber. After having
your bond removed go to the standing stone. This is where you should always
go when you have a bond removed because the man there (Tyranthraxus) tells you
who to kill off next and where they are. He does this so he has full control
of you for himself. At this time he should say "Seek Red to the South.". He
means the Renegade Red wizard of Thay, Dracandros.

Bond 2: Dracandros, Red wizard of Thay and the Helm of Dragons
Go south till you reach the village of Hap. Your first task in removing the
bond is to free the village. This is quite easy and should pose to much of a
problem. The village has been taken over by an efreet and his Drow minions.
You will find help in the inn in the form of one Akabar El Akesh. He is a mage
of some very small level and is almost, but not exactly, useless. If you go
into the south building immediately you will be severly wasted. If however you
kill of some drow patrols first, then the Efreets forces will be severly
reduced and easy pickings. After obliterating the efreet go to the caves. Go
South East when you enter the caves and as long as you have a female member in
your party, you will meet Silk of the swan mays. She will give the 1st Female
in the party the mark of a swanmay and will ask you to do something for her.
Go to the sulphur baths and get the chests from them. There are several magic
Items in them including a Longsword +2 Dragon slayer which will help I you
decide to kill of the dragons. Exit the caves via the dracolich. If you need
XP, then kill him, Otherwise leave Crimshank alone. When you enter the tower
you will meet dracandros. He will teleport you to the top of the tower where
a host of evil black dragons are waiting. They force him to remove the bond.
You now have to choices. Attack the dragons, and be passive. If you attack
the dragons you had better hope you can kill them, but if you do you get
quite a few XP and get the stuff that Silk wants. You should now head slowly
down the tower. On the third floor there is a drow lord. Save your game before
finding him because he is sometimes hard, sometimes easy to kill. On the 3rd
floor theres a dragons egg which Silk also wants. There are a lot of wyverns
hanging around in the tower and unless the party is relatively strong it may
be an idea to avoid the rooms theyre in. In the tower somewhere is a special
place called the Test of The Sphere. In this test a character controls a sphere
of annihalation and must, by concentrating on it, force it into an opposing
mage. Your character doesn't have to be a mage, I did it with a ranger. If you
win you get some magic Items. If you lose youre disintegrated permanent like.
On the ground floor after leaving the tower you will be attacked by Dracandros
himself. Destroy his forces and him and you are well rewarded. Dracandros has
stacks of Magic on his corpse. Re-enter the caves if you killed the dragons
and got the egg and Silk will give you some treasure. Unfortunately this
isnt magical Though it will help if youre broke. Go back to Haptooth and
id all magic and Rest/Fix/Memorise all chars and spells etc.. No go to the
standing stone. Tyranthraxus says:Seek the woman in green to the NW. By This
he means Mogion a cultist of moander who resides in moanders pit.

Bond 3: Mogion, The green cultists, a god and the gauntlet of Moander
Go to and Enter Yulash. You should enter by asking permission. You will be
taken to see the commander. Walk around the room until the spies try to escape
kill them and you wont have to worry about the red plume guards in the check
points. There are only two places you must go to in Yulash, The first is the
middle of the city to get the wand of defoliation. and the secon is the North
East to enter the pit of moander. Enter the pit and follow the sights and
sounds of a recent battle. You will find Alias and DragonBait. Allow them to
join and head for the stairs in the South East. Go down and go straight North
take out the slug and the cultists and continue north till you reach a pair of
doors. Enter and attack Mogion when you get a chance. After insuring the death
of Mogion and her Cult you will be attacked by a parts of a God. Called
"Bit'O'Moanders" they are reasonably easy to defeat, using spells like Stinking
Cloud, and Hold Monster. Search the Altar for some treasure and leave the pit
by the exit door on the first level. Now visit Tyranthraxus at the standing
stone again and hell tell you to "Seek Black to the North.". The black lord is
Fzoul Chembyrl, one of the higher members of the Zhentrim.

Bond 4: Fzoul, Dexam and the Amulet Of Lathander
Go to and enter the city of Zhentil Keep. Here you may buy numerous Magic
Items and various goods you may need to restock. Buy all you need and then
follow the path around until you meet Olive Ruskettle, The halfling Bard.
Follow her and enter the door in front of you when she leaves. You will find
Dimswart the sage. Take him with you and make your way to the chapel. DONT
follow the woman until you've searched the altar. One of the weapons you find
there is cursed so be careful. Follow the Hooded Woman (Medusa) and she will
take you to Dexam the Beholder. He will disintegrate Fzoul, removing your bond
and leave. You must find and kill Dexam to get the amulet of lathander. He is
in the South West Corner of His Temple with a few minotaurs and his Medusa.
Another place of interest here is the dead elfs body which has a few items on
it. Avoid the North East Corner because there is a trap there that teleports
you to the dead elf causing you damage. For the last time go to the standing
stone and Tyranthraxus reveals himself and goes to his temple in Myth Drannor.

Bond 5: Tyranthraxus and the Pool of Radiance
This is the last part of the game so make sure your characters are all max
level or youll be slaughtered. In the Burial Glen fights with spiders can NOT
be avoided however fights with Thri-Kreen can by parlaying and saying that
Tyranthraxus is your master. Always Rebury the skeletons and replace the bones
in crypts. There are five things which should happen before you continue. You
should go to the Spirit Queen in the Tomb in the North West Corner and get the
magic Items she gives you. You should follow and kill of the Red Plume soldier
(who is really a Rakshasa.) and get his bow and arrows. You should meet The
Nameless Bard (Finder Wyvernspur). You should kill the thri Kreen in their
lair. And finally There are Knights of Myth Drannor wandering around. Dont
enter the ruins without meeting them. To reach the ruins simply go east and
enter the east forest. Follow the woods not the path. In the ruins there are
only a few things to do. You should first save the guy running from the hell
hounds and go and get his treasure. Next go visit the old Rakshasa and speak
Haughtily to him and he'll offer his assisstance. Somewhere in the ruins a
rakshasa is wandering around and asks you to help him raid the treasure room.
Assisst and get the treasure. Go break up the gambling game in the North West
as well. Note: Save frequently. If you encounter a patrol just give them dosh.
Finally Enter the sewer grate located somewhere in the North West Quadrant.
You will now find yourself in the temple. Head west until you find
Tyranthraxus and then when he runs off go north and up the stairs. Now go to
the North East and enter the South Door. You are now in the final battle with
Tyranthraxus and his 12 High Priests and 48 Margoyles. The easiest way to kill
him is to all be invisible with either the spell (Not very effective) or the
Dust of Disappearance (infinitely Preferable). Once you have defeated him you
will be teleported to Shadowdale where a feast will be held in your honour.

@node Cutthroats
@remark S
Welcome aboard, matey! Dust off your scuba tank, shake out your
flippers, and prepare to go treasure hunting. But first, a word
from our sponsor. Cutthroats, like most Infocom games, has
several solutions. This walkthru will show you one way of
completing the adventure. However, there are others, so when
you've finished, you might want re-play the game, doing
different things, to see if you can come up with another way of
recovering the treasures successfully.

Also, you should be aware that you can only recover treasures
from 2 of the ships, the Sao Vera and the S.S. Leviathan. The
other wrecks are only red herrings, and you don't have to bother
with them. Which of the two real wrecks you will dive for depends
on the item you are shown by Johnny Red. If he shows you the gold
coin, it's the Sao Vera; if it's the dinner plate, then the ship
is the Leviathan.

Further, most of your actions up to the dive itself will be
pretty much the same, so this section of the walkthru will take
you up almost to the dive itself. After that, consult either the
Sao Vera section, or the Leviathan section, depending on which
ship you're investigating.

Ok! The game starts with a long lead in, explaining how you came
by the book of shipwrecks. You will have to sit through this on
each boot-up; no way around it. After that, the game really
begins, with you lying in bed in your scruffy room at the Red
Boar Inn. The first thing to do is stand up, then wind your watch
(time is important in the game, and if your watch runs	down, you
can't keep track of the time).

There's a note on the floor. Read that, then open your dresser.
Inside are the shipwreck book, your bankbook, and a room key. Get
the key, open the door, go out, and lock the door again. You
don't want to leave the door open, or the Weasel will come by
later and steal the shipwreck book. If that happens, the game is
over before it even starts. You don't need to take the book with
you, so locking the door is effective here.

Now, go downstairs and out to the Wharf Road. Follow the road
East until you get to the Shanty. Enter the Shanty, and you will
see Johnny Red and Pete the Rat already there. Sit down and order
breakfast, then wait for Weasel to show. Order a glass of water
when you get thirsty. While you're waiting, you might want to
listen to the parrot. He doesn't have anything important to say,
but you might get a chuckle out of him.

Eventually, Weasel will arrive, and Johnny will ask if you're
interested in doing some treasure hunting. Say yes, and then
Johnny will have you all meet again a little later at the
lighthouse, in order to keep McGinty from finding out what you're
up to. After that, leave the Shanty, go back West to the end of
Wharf Road, and from there Southwest twice and Northwest once,
which brings you to the lighthouse. Now, wait for Pete, who will
be the last person to arrive.

Once Pete gets there, Johnny will show an object, either the coin
or the plate. This indicates which wreck to dive for. After that,
he'll give further instructions, which you should read carefully.
When he's finished, go back to your room at the Red Boar. Get
your passbook. If you're diving for the Leviathan, also get your
scuba gear from the closet (scuba gear not needed for the Sao
Vera).

Leave the room (lock the door behind you!), and go back out. Walk
East along Wharf road to the end, and go Southeast to the Ocean
Road. If you're going to use your scuba gear for the dive, go
Southwest into the alley, and drop your scuba gear there. You
don't want McGinty to see you lugging it around.

Follow the Ocean Road south to the end, then go Southwest to the
Ocean Road, and North into the bank. Make your withdrawl, then
leave and return to Ocean Road, where you go Southeast to Point
Lookout. Drop your passbook here (that Mcginty has sharp eyes,
and you don't want him to see you with that, either), and wait
for Johnny.

When Johnny arrives, show him the money you just took from the
bank. He'll be satisfied, and then ask if the wreck is more than
200 feet underwater. Answer yes if it's the Sao Vera, no if it's
the Leviathan. The two of you will then head back to
International Outfitters to rent a ship and purchase supplies and
equipment. McGinty will be in the store when you get there.
However, just wait, and he'll leave eventually.

Johnny will make his purchases first, and you will have to chip
in some of the cash you're carrying. However, you will have
plenty of money left over to buy whatever you need. When it's
your turn, buy the flashlight and the shark repellent. If you're
diving for the Sao Vera, that's all you need. However, if you are
diving for the Leviathan, also buy the following items: C
battery, putty, and electromagnet, and also rent the small air
compresser (so you can fill your tank). All these items will be
delivered to the ship for you, so you don't have to take them
with you.

Now, it's time to uncover a little double-dealing. Leave
Outfitters, and go back East along Wharf Road to the end, then
Southeast again to Ocean Road. Go along Ocean Road to the end,
then Southwest to Shore Road, and continue West along Shore Road
until you reach the Ferry dock. Wait around.

Soon McGinty will appear, and a short while later, Weasel. The
two men will go off to a corner and talk. Then Weasel will hand
something to McGinty, and board the Ferry (you can't get on it
yourself, but you have other things to do, anyway). Ok, now
you've seen that, go back to Ocean Road, and then into the
alleyway.

The alley runs behind all the buildings, and it will come in very
handy! Go West along the alley (pick up your scuba gear if you
dropped it here earlier) , until you're standing behind the
vacant lot, which is next door to McGinty's. Wait here, and
McGinty will come by, heading from East to West. Continue
waiting, and he will soon re-appear, going from West to East (he
is walking along Wharf Road, of course).

Once you see him the second time, go West once, and you're behind
his store. The door is locked, but you can open the window and
get through into the place. Here you will find an envelope that
proves the Weasel is out to double-cross you all. Get the
envelope, then leave by the window.

Go back along the alley to the Vacant lot, then go straight North
until you come to the dock where the rental ships are moored.
Both ships have approximately the same layout; they are slightly
different on the top deck, but below they are exactly the same.
Enter whichever ship has been rented for the dive, and go below
deck. Then go north until you reach the crews quarters, and hide
your envelope under the bed. You don't want Weasel to know you
have it (he'll kill you), and if you show it to Johnny now,
you'll cancel the expedition.

Now you have to do some more waiting. The delivery boy will come
around, and drop off the items you've bought. Then the others
will start to arrive. When Johnny comes, go to the Captain's
Cabin, and tell him the longitude and latitude of the wreck,
which you can easily get by looking at the shipwreck book that
came in the game package. Then go back to the crews quarters, and
wait some more. Eventually, you'll reach the dive site. At this
point, you should now read either the Sao Vera section or the
Leviathan section, whichever is applicable.

Ok, so it's time for the Leviathan. Get up, then go North to the
storage locker. Here you will find all the things you bought at
Outfitters. Put on your wet suit and flippers. Get the drill and
the C battery, open the drill, put the battery inside, and close
the drill. Get the remaining items, except the compresser. Fill
your tank with the compresser, then go South. Along the way, get
the envelope from under the bed.

Stop in the galley to eat and drink, then continue on South to
the Captain's Quarters. Show Johnny the envelope. That will take
care of Weasel! Now go North and up. Put on your tank and mask.
Johnny will tell you about the orange line, but for this dive, it
won't be needed.

You're all set, so dive in! Once underwater, turn on your
flashlight, because it's going to get dark pretty soon. Oops! A
shark just showed up! Good thing you have the repellent. Open the
canister, and the shark will take off. Now, just keep going down
until you reach the wreck.

You're on the top deck of the Leviathan, with a hole at your
feet. Go down through the hole, to the Middle Deck. Here, you can
only go up or down, so go down again, to the Below Decks area.
From there, go South, to the room with the closed door. You might
want to read the sign on the door before you open it.

Once past the door, you're in a mine locker. All the mines are
tied down, except for one loose one, floating in front of a hole.
Fortunately, you can take care of that problem without
difficulty. Touch the magnet to the mine, then turn on the
magnet. Drop the magnet (why that doesn't blow you to bits, I
don't know, but that's how it works). Now you can go up through
the hole.

You're on the Middle Deck again, although a different part of it.
The way South is narrow, so remove your tank, then go due South
until you come to the room with the safe. This is the tricky
part. Turn on the drill, drill the lock, and then *immediately*
turn off the drill again. Otherwise, it will burn out, and you'll
have a big problem later!

Ok, inside the safe is a glass case containing some valuable
stamps. Alas, there is a crack in the case, and water is starting
to seep in. However, don't be alarmed; you'll have enough time to
fix that. Go back North to the room with the hole in it. Put your
tank back on. Go through the hole into the mine locker, then
North, then up through another hole.

Surprise! This room still has air in it. Good thing, too, because
the water level in the case was starting to get too high for
comfort! Now, turn on the drill, and drill a hole in the case. As
the water drains out, the drill dies (lasted just long enough).
Now, open the tube of putty, and put the glob of putty on the
hole. The putty will seal both the hole and the crack.

And that's just about it for the Leviathan. All you have to do
now is go back through the ship, and up to your own boat, where
your comrades are waiting. Congratulations! You're now a very
rich diver!

 So, it's off to the Sao Vera. This one has a few more obstacles
than the Leviathan did, but none of them are particularly
difficult. The first thing is to get off the bed, and head North
to the Storage Locker. Here you'll find the flashlight and
repellent, as well as a deap-sea diving outfit. There is also a
small machine here, that you won't be needing (it's a locater
box. If you really want to fiddle with it, you have to buy a dry
cell to make it work).

Get everything but the box, then go back South. Get the envelope
from under your bed, stop off in the Galley to eat and drink,
then continue on to Johnny's cabin. Show him the envelope, which
will put an end to Weasel's double-cross. Now wear the suit and
go up on deck.

Johnny will be there, and will tell you about the orange line.
Keep in mind what he says. If you look around, you'll see a large
air compressor, with an air hose. Attach that to your suit, and
then turn on the compressor. You're all set, so dive in!

Once underwater, turn on your flashlight. There's that pesky
shark again! Open your canister to get rid of it, then keep on
going down. It will be a long way down, but you'll get there.

Now you're on the top deck of the Sao Vera, with a hole at your
feet. Go down the hole. Crash! Looks like the ladder broke. You
may have a problem getting back up again! Then again, maybe not.
Leave that for now, and make your way South, into the room with
the iron bars. Get one, because it will come in handy soon.

Then keep going South, until you come to the room with the bunks
barring the way. Move the bunks with the bar, then wedge the bar
under the bunks to keep them from moving back. Now you can go
South again, to another room, with a ladder leading down. Climb
down that one.

Oops! Crash again! This time, though, the whole ladder didn't
crumble. Still, it's going to be hard to reach it on your way
back. No matter, you still have to find tha treasure, so go
North.

Uh Oh!! There's a giant squid here! Good thing for you it's
asleep. And if you're smart, you won't wake it up! So, just go
right on by, don't try doing anything to the squid at all. In the
next room is an oak chest, along with a hole in the side of the
ship. Leave that for now, and keep going North.

In the next room are some skeletons, remains of the crew. Examine
them, and you'll see one wears a scabbard. In the scabbard is a
sword. Get that, and go North again, to the last room. Here you
will find a maple chest. The chest is to heavy to carry, so push
it back South until you come to the oak chest (note: you must say
"Push Maple Chest South").

Hmmmm, now, which chest to take? Let's try the oak chest. Push
that out West through the hole (carefully! You don't want to cut
your air supply!). Wait awhile, and the orange line will appear.
Get that, tie it to the oak chest, and tug on the line. The chest
will slowly make its way upward, while you return to the ship.

Now, push the maple chest south, past the sleeping squid, and
south again into the room with the ladder. Climb on the chest,
and you'll be able to reach the ladder and climb back up to the
middle deck.

From there, go North until you reach the room with the cask in
it. Now, push the cask north with you, until you come back to the
room with the mast and the rope tied around it. Climb on the
cask, then cut the rope with the sword. Drop the sword (you can't
leave with it), and then make your way up and out.

Once on the top deck, just keep going up until you're back on the
boat. The chest will be opened to display hundreds of gold coins.
Congratulations, you're now a very rich diver!

STRATEGY: Obtain four additional codes for the sonic key, in this order:
green square, green triangle, green circle, green hourglass. These allow
progressive access to the four main zones in the complex. Each zone
contains one code, and also contains one wall safe. The safes contain the
four parts of a mysterious cube. There are three fusion generators supplying
power to the complex. The schematic map opposite the REPAIRS AND SPARES
room will tell you which ones are on. Initally, only the centre one is on,
and you'll need to activate the other two with the sonic key to be able to
use certain elevators.

SOME PRELIMINARIES: Save the game whenever you can, and keep a backup save,
preferably from back at the save console near the Centron room. Sometimes
you can find a most unfavourable combination of robots waiting for you as
you emerge from a save room and try to fight your way back out of a zone,
and you might wish to fall back to your original save and repeat the zone.
I haven't generally bothered telling you when and where to save in the walk
through, but the maps reveal locations of save rooms
A useful configuration to have saved on the function keys is MAX JUMP. All
systems except the power-assist off-line (including sensors), and all
energy banks charged and on-line. This channels maximum power to the
power-assist, and there are a couple of very long jumps you have to make.
Also use this when you fall long distances to minimize damage when you hit
bottom.
You may find that when you drop items you've picked up, such as energy
banks, fuel pellets (red spheres) or shield generators, they may explode in
your face, causing much hurtful damage and a great deal of irritation.
Especially if you haven't saved the game recently. I think this happens
when you get shot and damaged badly, causing incidental damage to the
items, and if they've got a lot of charge in them, the blast can easily
kill you. The only solution is to have all systems off-line except the
shield, and all energy banks charged and on-line before dropping the
offending item. Even then, you may still die. Swear, re-load a saved game
and try again.

THE WALK-THROUGH:
North through the entrance door, N, N into Centron room, W, N, take
elevator to top floor, pick up energy bank, W, pick up parrot camera, E, E,
goggle at schematic map, W, S, save game.

ZONE 1: Take elevator to bottom, S, activate energy transfer probe, all
banks on-line, cozy up to the green sphere and recharge. E to Centron room,
NE, E, take elevator down to ZONE 1. Get your guns on and start blowing
robots up. Collect a few energy banks to give yourself a total of six if
you can, and use the ETP on the red spheres to charge your on-line banks up.
You can also make the spheres explode while they're lying on the floor,
killing nearby robots. The sonic code for doing this is a RED CIRCLE, and
all spheres in the room will go. Head N, W into the generator room. Switch
generator on, E, N, take the right-hand N exit, N, head all the way W
through this room and go S, S, S, S, W, ignore the elevator, S, and S to
save game. Switch on shield and all energy banks, E, IMMEDIATELY head
through the N door (there's a very large fixed cannon shooting at you from
the S wall), blast the two pyramid guns, E, E, E and IMMEDIATELY head for
the S door to avoid the fixed cannon in this room. Get the GREEN SQUARE
code by interrogating the weird machine with the sonic key. Reverse your
entire route back to the elevator you came down in, and you can now take it
back up. Head back to the green sphere and recharge your banks. Head upstairs,
SAVE GAME FIRST, then dump your three charged banks. Drop the empty ones
you should have gathered and pick them up again to gain empty on-line
banks. Pick up your charged spares, save game, head downstairs and charge
up at the green sphere.

ZONE 2: From the green sphere, W, W, N, N, elevator up,unlock W door with
sonic key, W, elevator up, walk round ledge to SW corner, elevator up to
middle floor. (N.B. If you see the elevator arrow lit up, this may mean
that there's a robot on its way to meet you. Have your shields up and gun
on-line when you open the elevator door!) Blast pyramid gun, N,
right-hand N door, N, elevator down. Take elevator on W wall up, blast
pyramid gun, E, activate generator, W, elevator back down to middle floor.
 N, elevator up, open window in E wall with sonic key and drop jaw at
sight of robot in room below. You need to call and take the elevator in
the NE corner of that room, so wait until he's out of that general area,
take elevator at S end of corridor down, sprint across room and call
elevator. If you run around a bit, the angel robot will find it hard to
hit you. Once you've been shot once by this dude, you will appreciate
this feature. Elevator up, W,S,right-hand N door, elevator up to middle
floor, collect GREEN TRIANGLE.Reverse route back to save game near Centron
room. Sounds easy when you say it all in one sentence like that, eh? You
may have problems getting back into the angel robot's room. If he's
standing guard outside the elevator door when you reach bottom, don't try
to squeeze past him. Go back up, switch to MAX JUMP and simply drop off
the edge to land, somewhat dazed, in his room.When you get back to the
start save room, go W, and unlock the door to the SPARES AND REPAIRS area.
 If you stand in one of the cubicles on the N wall and trigger the wall
switch with the sonic key, you should find your energy recharged and all
systems fully repaired. Enter the S room, jump up onto the ledge, and
pick up the red tube (missile launcher!) Use this by selecting the slot
below the gun and selecting a red fuel pellet on your backpack display.
Press fire to blow things away, but make sure you're not standing too
close to the target.

ZONE 3: There's really two ways to do this, but I only discovered the
easy route after many, many hard battles in the other route. Take
elevator down to ZONE 1. N, take the right-hand S door, unlock the E door,
N, follow the corridor all the way N past a save room to the elevator.
Elevator down, go west into the large room, then head NW round the corner
to the elevator. Take elevator to middle floor, set up shields and
missile launcher, blast the auto-cannon (mounted on wall immediately to
the W of elevator) with a missile. Drop down pit, open concealed pit in
middle of floor (three purple hourglasses), drop down. Take elevator
down, S, open wall safe, pick up red and green component. N, elevator up,
MAX JUMP, jump out of pit, jump out of second pit back to near elevator.
Head to SW corner and line up on the ledge to the W by the big red door.
With MAX JUMP you should _just_ make it to this ledge. I'm not sure the
programmers intended this to be manageable, as it neatly bypasses an
enormously difficult section, absolutely stuffed with auto-cannons and
robot tanks. (For the masochistic amongst you, go NW from the Centron
room, N,N, close pneumatic bridge, E,N,N,N, take right-hand S exit,S,
unlock E door, E,E,N,N,N,N,W. Destroying four auto-cannons with the
missile launcher en-route. Coming back is even worse!)Unlock the W door,
W, shoot out the small guns and avoid the three concealed pits in the
floor. If you hear the hum of an opening door beneath your feet, jump
forward or back immediately! S, pick up GREEN TRIANGLE, N, W to the ledge
above a huge pit containing three giant pillars. MAX JUMP, jump W to land
on top of the nearest pillar. If you hit your head on the ceiling of the
ledge room, then you weren't close enought to the edge when you jumped.
From the first pillar, jump W, then S, then W to the ledge in the SW
corner of the room. Unlock door, W, MAX JUMP, then leap W over the
trench, trying not to land on top of any of the numerous tanks patrolling
this room. Sprint for the S door, open the safe and take the second
component. This is a good time to switch your energy banks. And now retrace
your steps to save game near the Centron room.

ZONE 4: Charge up your energy, E from the Centron room, S,S, blast gun,
E, head N at the E end of the corridor, N into a room with four purple
squares on the floor. Stand in the middle of the NE one and unlock it
with the sonic key. Drop down, E, head N,E,S, set up shields and missile
launcher, drop down pit to the South. Face N and blast the auto-cannon.
Walk up towards it and unlock the concealed pit in the floor. Drop down,
open safe, take third component, MAX JUMP out of pit, take elevator up.
Follow corridor round to next elevator and take it up. Walk N out of
elevator, W, S, W and N to the next elevator at the end of corridor.
Elevator up, follow corridor round to the E, and take door S to elevator.
Take elevator down to middle floor, and jump NE over pit to land on E
side. Follow corridor round to the N and take the elevator on the N wall
up. Head W and walk through the yellow and green chevronned door on the N
wall. Drop down the pit to the W, head W,S,S. Pick up GREEN HOURGLASS
code, N,unlock door, W, unlock door, W,N,N, unlock door, N, walk to N end
of bridge, set up shields and missile launcher, drop off bridge to room
below, blast auto-cannon, take the western S exit,S,S,S,W. Close
pneumatic bridge by interrogating the pillar console with sonic key, S,S,S
to Centron room and save game.

FINAL COMPONENT: For this you need to head back into Zone 2 with at least
two missiles in your possession. Go to the room with the large angel
robot as before, elevator up, take the elevator on the N wall up. Set up
shields and missile launcher and open N door. You thought the big angel
downstairs was bad news? Blast the "Lucifer" robot (takes two missiles)
and wait for it to stop twitching. Find the concealed pit in the floor -
should be at the feet of the robot, unlock it, drop down, open safe, take
fourth component. Back to save game near Centron room.

THE LAST BATTLE: Head to SPARES AND REPAIRS. Drop the four components on
the floor of a cubicle and watch them self-assemble. Pick up the
assembled cube and dump the missile launcher. Slot 2 should now be... a
BLUE sonic key! E,E, take elevator to middle floor, E. Jump onto top of
Centron pillar. Trigger blue sonic key sequence SQUARE-CIRCLE-TRIANGLE,
and wait for the special effects to die down. If you're standing anywhere
but on top of the pillar, you'll die. Look at the S wall. See that
glowing blue outline? That's a secret door, that is. Jump over to it,
unlock it and S,S,S to the Brainstem computer room. Shoot the brainstem
sphere lots of times until it blows up and sheds most of its mass to leave
a much smaller sphere, which promptly does a runner. You can't harm it
now, so simply move under the opened door in the ceiling, tilt your head
up and just watch.

The password for the computer is "DEATH".

Also when you are killed, waggle your joystick in a circle while holding
down the <FIRE>. You will restart at that position with 7-8 lives.

Hints:
In each room there are yellow triangles on the walls, use these to open
doors. In many cases you will need to fire your laser in order to richochet
off the walls and connect with the triangle, opening a door you would not
otherwise be able to open safely.

On level 81 (I believe) the username and passcode for the computer that
unlocks the doorway are: Username: Seth,Passcode: Ostrich

The only other password you need for another computer on a higher level in
the game is Pestilence.

Basically in every room you enter, blow up everything. Press <U> to use
items in your inventory, bombs, stop time, barriers, or shields. Bombs of
course can be used with button 2 on the joystick. Stop time stops time.
Barriers blow up things for you (make sure they don't backfire on you and
kill you instead). Shields protect you from everything for a short period
of time (The exception to this is the green cannons, your shield will
disappear after being hit once by a cannon, so get rid of those mothers right
away).

I believe level 90 is the final level in the game, so even though it might
look like you've reached the roof of the damn building, you haven't.

In order to save people, first secure the room by blowing up everything and
walking over those squares so they turn green. Then walk up the person and
hit enter a few times to see if the person has anything to say. If not, just
walk with the person (being very careful to keep the person from walking over
electric shock pads) over to the red arrow in the room, and the person will
walk out. At the end of the game I had saved approximately 40 people, so you
know you'll be doing fine if you average about 4 people each level. Some
people you attempt to save will turn into "fire guys". Blow them up with a
bomb immediately. You can discern real people from fire dudes by firing
bombs against the wall. If a person shakes, he is real. If a person stays
stationary, he is fake and will decapitate you.

In one room in the game you will not be able to open one of the doors unless
you blow up one of the yellow rods. It will then unlock. (You don't have to
worry about that door anyway, since I already gave you the passcode/userid)

When you see a computer walk up to it and you'll get some cool graphics and
information about Genoq. Mostly they're not of much use, but 2 of the
computers ask for passcodes that I mentioned above and are very important.
In one room you will walk to the computer and suddenly be transported to a
weird area with a guy resembling the T-1000 coming after you. When this
happens, restore the game and when you get back to that room, DONT TOUCH THE
COMPUTER AT ALL. You do not need to, and you can only lock yourself in the
room by doing so.

Oh yeah, by the way use <ALT>-<S> to save the game and <ALT>-<R> to restore.
Saved game always starts at level beginning.

Use <CTRL>-<J> to turn on the joystick. <S> for your status. <CTRL>-<R> to
restart (sometimes).

Level 90 (the last level) is the weirdest level of the game. You will
encounter Derrida (the guy you want to give the package to). Just talk with
him and then touch him. Then walk to the right out of the weird screen.
Then continue walking diagonally right-down, then diagonally right-up to get
out of the EYE screen. Then talk to the second Derrida and walk to the top
of the cross and exit. Continue walking right out of the next room. When
you see the glowing dude, wait until he starts walking then get the hell out
of there to the left. Follow the red-arrow path downward and walk to the
keyhole at the bottom left of the screen. Touch the thing when glowdude is
about to walk in front of the radar dish, and he will get fried and explode
in blood. Then walk out and back to the room you first met the glowing guy
in. Touch the computer for the fun of it and then touch the jetpack and fly
away to victory.

Oh yeah again, Those white open triangles are keyholes. You need to find
the key on each level for each keyhole. Sometimes there may be like 5
keyholes/keys on a level. Just get the key and touch the keyhole and the
door will open.

Are those transporter things rad or what? Notice how you can shoot into
them. This is valuable when you have to shoot a yellow triangle from a
distance to make a door open. The bomb will enter the transporter and come
out the other transporter, connecting with the triangle perfectly (if you
aim that way).

On Midas reference 577-341 you can find a pyramid which contains a magic
crystal. To use it, you'll need the book from the trader at Eris Capital City
(13-5). Reading the book while in possession of the crystal will allow one
wish to be granted. You may like to try some of the following wishes.

	I WISH I HAD A CHEESE SANDWICH
	I WISH I HAD MORE TIME
	I WISH I COULD RECIEVE 1,000,000 CREDITS
	I WISH THE UNIVERSE WAS MORE COLOURFUL
	I WISH I KNOW HOW TO USE AUTHOR'S COMPUTER
	I WISH I HAD MERCENARY 3 NOW

FIVE WAYS TO WIN:
1 Find all eight explosives and the timed detonator. Go to Damocles. Drop
  seven explosives and set the eighth to detonate. Depart posthaste and
  collect reward: $10,000,000. Note that you can bargain the State
  President up to $25,000,000 by turning down her first offers.
2 Ditto, but blow up Icarus instead before Damocles passes it. Without
  Icarus's gravitational pull, Damocles's course is altered so it misses
  Eris by a good margin. Collect $10,000,000 from the State President and
  $25,000,000 from Lloyds' for solving the problem without destroying
  Damocles.
3 Using the Nova Bomb instead of explosives, repeat #1 or #2 above.
4 Use the Magic Wishing Crystal on Midas and wish that Eris (or both Eris
  and Damocles) would be saved. (the "Wishes Solution")
5 Using the Author's Computer, blow up Damocles (planet #29.)

One of the four "hidden" pyramids contains a communications console.

hidden side door at the sphynx's knee. On the front wall is a pyramid
number, but you can only read it if you're carrying the reading glasses
from Lucan.
Translate it into planetary coordinates:
1 Divide by 4096 and drop the fraction. Call this PX.
2 Get the remainder from step 1. Call this PY.
  The pyramids are arranged in a large square, 4096 pyramids on a side.
  PX and PY locate the pyramid in this grid.
3 Divide PX by 4.096 and drop the fraction to get the planetary X coord.
4 Divide PY by 4.096, drop the fraction and add 250. This is the
  planetary Y coordinate. Now go to Midas.

AMUSEMENT:
Once you've figured out how to destroy a planet, try the technique on
various planets. Especially Gaea, Dion, and Eris.

Blast the lock off the door of the Author's House and steal his computer
and his chair. They both have actual uses, and do quite interesting things.

Blow up the Author's Computer with an explosive. Then get well clear...
that is, well clear of EVERYTHING.

Each planet and/or moon has some information and history associated with
it. Benson (your computer) doesn't always present it upon your visit to
said world. Keep trying until you do get it.

Try to land on the sun (Dialis).

Crash your spaceship in the ocean.

Land on the roof of a building, get out, then stroll over the edge...

Get yourself locked into the jail on Metis.

There are lots of nice vantage points to watch Eris's destruction from.
Vesta is quite decent. The best place, of course, is on Eris itself. If
you're on the right part of the planet, you'll get to see the comet
plunging through the atmosphere directly towards you.

Watch the control towers at spaceports; they change color to warn you
when your ship gets near.

Lots of the stuff in Damocles is quite closely related to British politics,
although the passage of time since its release has obsoleted some of the
jokes. For example, the Lawson Banks are named after Nigel Lawson, the
chancellor of the Exchequer at the time Damocles was being written  (although by the time it actually came out, he wasn't any more...) You can
find the Prime Minister's proposal for the poll tax in the basement of the
Hall of Government on Vesta; she predicts it will be well-received...

The Novagen offices are full of inside jokes and hints on the game. You
will find the keys in a pub on Dion East.

Noticed the road signs near the Novagen building on Dion? Novagen's
real offices are on Alcester Road, Birmingham, England, and the one in
the game bears an intentional physical resemblance to the real one.
The same goes for the Author's House.

SOLUTION:
Firstly do as the president says and go to the room at the end of the
corridoor on the second floor. Answer ok to the question, and go back down
to the basement. Get the key and go back to your ship.

Fly to 09-02 capital city, and you will find a lift. Go to the basement
and pick up the antigrav. Return to your ship and fly to 12-14 capital
city and pick up the A-Z computer. Switch it on (it will constantly tell
you your location).

Fly to key west and the to location 07-07. Enter the building and go down
to the basement. Here you will find another antigrav. Collect it and go to
a trading post. Sell one of the antigrav's (the other one will allow you
to pick up spacecraft, cars etc...)

From here, go to snow island, location 03-00. Here you should collect the
clipboard and the cupboard (which is actually a trigger for the novabomb).
Go onto bare island, location 06-02. Make sure you take your ship into the
building with you. Drop the cupboard on the ground floor. Here there are
teleporters marker 0-9. Go to 0, where the computer will inform you that
you're in the professors new house. In one of the rooms you will find a
sideboard (another trigger).

Take this back to teleporter on and leave it there. Go through the
teleporters until the computer tells you that you are in the vesta
parliment. Take the lift to the top floor, where you'll find a briefcase
(this allows you to carry more objects). Go back to the basement and use
teleporter 6, leave the building and go back to your ship.

Fly to 05-06 and buy the hifi (the next trigger). Leave the island and fly
to 09-02 city. From here, enter the building and go to the basement.
Ignore the piano and go around to the back of the lift where you will find
the novabomb.

Now fly back to 08-08 chaldea metropolis (use the computer to find it).
From here, take the bomb and the triggers back to teleporter 1. Set all
the triggers to on. Use the teleporter and go to metis. On arrival, the
A-Z will tell you that you are in dooburys solicitors. Don't go to floor 8
or you'll be sued and lose all your money. Leave the building and head
down the road on your left.

At the end of the road is a court. Enter, and walk straight across the
room and into the wall. The wall will then open, revealing the last
trigger. Do not turn it on. Leave the court and fly into space. Land on
damocles and drop the bomb. Leave damocles and fly away (be careful of the
amount of time). When you are far enough away from the comet, engage the
last trigger.

@remark S
Complete Solution:

From the front path of the Robner's estate, go North to the front door of
the house. Type "Open Door" and go North into the Robners' house. From
inside the door, go North, East, and type "Climb Stairs" twice (or you
can just go Up, Up to get to the second level of the estate. From there,
go West, West, West, West, and North to the library where you will start
the first of a series of Sherlock Holmes-type activities. In Deadline,
you need to establish the motive and method for the murder beyond all
reasonable doubt before you can arrest the guilty party. If you don't
have an air-tight case, the jury will acquit the defendant.

It is here in the library where we go about establishing the method by
which poor Mr. Robner was done in. First off, type "Examine Rug". You
will find some mud spots which is your first clue. Now, "Get The Cup,
Pad, Calender and Pencil" and "Rub Pencil on Pad" and then "Turn Page of
Calender". Aha!  Perhaps a clue as to the motive?  Let's see if we can
substantiate the method a little more...that mud on the rug was very
interesting.

Type "Open Balcony Door" and Go North onto the balcony. Check out the
railing by typing "Examine Railing" and you will see some scratches,
lending credence to the theory that perhaps the murderer climbed up the
balcony from the ground below where he (or she) got mud on his shoes.
Let's have a look below and check for some indication that the murderer
was indeed below the balcony.

To leave the balcony, go South, South, East, East, East, East, Down,
Down, West, South. Type "Open Door" and go South back to the front door.
Now go East, East, and South-East to the shed where you will see a
ladder. Type "Examine Ladder". Hmmm!  This ladder-and-balcony theory
is looking good!  Let's see if we can prove the ladder was below the
balcony. This will have to wait a while though, because it's getting
late in the morning and we have to do some more checking in the house
before the reading of the will takes place. And besides that, we need to
talk to Mr. McNabb and he doesn't seem to be in the mood right now.

Go back to the house by heading North, South, North and head back up-
stairs with North, North, East, Up, Up. Let's see what else we can find
upstairs. Go South, South into Dunbar's bathroom. Type "Open Cabinet"
and "Examine Loblo". Aha, again!  Now we go back downstairs and see if
we can find Mr. McNabb to see if he knows anything about a ladder under
the balcony. Go North, North, Down, Down, West, South, and South. Let's
take a break for a while. Type "Wait Until 11:30". And now for Mr.
McNabb. Let's try the garden path first with East, North-East, East,
and West.

If McNabb is not around, just wait for a while or snoop around the area
and he will soon show up. Deadline is very unpredictable when it comes
to the various characters moving around the scenario. Once you spot
McNabb, go to him and say "Hey	McNabb", followed by "What is Wrong".
He will tell you about some holes he found in his garden so, naturally,
you say "Show Me the Holes". He will take off and you "Follow Hiim".
When he stops, type "Examine Holes". Eureka!  The ladder was here and
the depth of the holes proves somebody climbed it up to the balcony!
To make sure we cover every angle, type "Examine Ground" and "Dig Around
Holes". Hmmm...wonder what this could be about?  To find out, type
"Analyze Fragment For Loblo". Oops, it's later than we thought!  Back
to the house for the reading of the will. Go North, South-West, South-
East, and East to the house and North, North, West into the living room.
Now just "Wait" for the will to be read.

After the will is read, you decide to see if you can roust some of those
present into giving you some clues as to the guilty party and, perhaps,
the motive for the crime. Let's start with George. Type "Show George
the Calender". He will get very nervous and start heading out of the
room. Type "Follow Him" until he finally goes to his room. He will
keep telling you to leave him alone, but just keep following him until
he enters his room.

At this point, you decide to see if George knows more then he's telling.
You aren't going to get anything from him here, so let's go to the
balcony and wait to see if he does anything. Go West, North, North to
the balcony and type "Wait 10 Minutes". Voila!	Here he comes!	Wait
until he goes behind the bookshelf and then type "Wait 4 Minutes" to
give him time to really get his hands into the cookie jar. When your
four minutes are up, go South, "Examine Bookshelf", "Press Button", and
go East. Ha! Caught him red-handed!! Type "Get Will", "Look Safe",
"Get Papers", and "Read Papers".

Things are beginning to look up! Let's see if we can substantiate some
of this stuff. Go back to the living room with West, South, East, East,
East, East, Down, Down, West, West. My, isn't this cozy!  Type "Hey
Baxter", and "What about Focus". You know he's lying so you "Show Papers
to Baxter". Ah, that's better! Now for some clever psycho-detective
work. Type "Show Lab Report to Dunbar" and "Show Lab Report to Baxter".
Whip around and "Accuse Dunbar". Hmmm...a tad nervous, isn't she?
Perhaps we should go off and wait to see what develops.

Go East to leave the room and "Wait for Dunbar". Just as we suspected!
When she passes you, type "Follow Her". Once outside the house, she will
drop a ticket. Type "Get Ticket" and "Read Ticket."  WOW!  This is get-
ting good!  Type "Show Ticket to Dunbar". You know you've got her on the
run now so head off to the shed to wait and see what develops. Go East,
East, and South-East and "Wait for Baxter". When they both show up,
"Show Ticket to Baxter" and "Arrest Baxter and Dunbar". You didn't
believe them for a minute, did you?

Due to the dynamic nature of Deadline, there are several ways to end up
accusing Baxter and Dunbar of the murder. There are also more puzzles to
solve, but this is all that is necessary to put together an air-tight
case against them.

Money
You have a few quarters and a 20 dollar bill which isn't quite enough. You
can play the slot machines in the Casino. Sometimes you win; sometimes you
loose. You can take the Hooker's purse - there's money in it.

Washroom
You wake up in the washroom. Take coat, gun and holster. Examine the
contents of the coat. There's a wallet in it so examine its contents also.
You might want to look in the mirror and tidy up a bit before you exit.
Notice the puddle in the hallway and take a look in the Ladies' Room.
You'll find a gaudy earring on the toilet.

Bar
Not much to do here. But, it's a good reference point. You can see several
exits and a big black Mercedes.

Upstairs (above the bar)
Look at the pictures in the hallway. Then enter the Office. Search the
desk. Take envelope. You have just found Address 3. To enter the Private
Office, use the key from the wallet. Search the body. Take the Mercedes'
key. Open desk. Take pencil and key marked "Front." There's more than one
way to explore the building; however, I chose to exit through the window
using the fire escape to get to the Weird Room.

Weird room
Examine everything. Ah ha! You must have been strapped in the chair and
injected with DIETHANOL TRIMENE -- or was it SODIUM PENTATHOL? Take the
syringe from the waste can. You can ride the elevator or whatever to
explore the rest of the building.

Casino
Put a few coins in the slot machine. Maybe you'll get lucky!

Sewer
Explore this area carefully. Beware the alligator! Try to find the whirlpool
for you'll need to know about it. It's down, down, and down (I forgot how
many times).

Mercedes
(Unlock it with key from corpse.) Look in glove compartment. Take photo,
car registration, and map. You have just found Address 1.

Gun shop
You can buy or trade; but it isn't worth the trouble. If you play the
game on Sunday, you can't get in.

First address
(1212 West End St.) Put plastic card in slot by elevator door. Search the
Penthouse. Take photograph. You've just found Address 2.

Second address
(520 S. Kedzie) Shoot the door! Take paper (combination to safe), diary,
and key.

Third address
(934 West Sherman) The key from 520 S. Kedzie unlocks both the pharmacy and
Ace's Office. In Dr. Brody's Pharmacy, shoot file cabinet and read the
files to learn antidote for DIETHANOL TRIMENE. I believe it's BISODIUMITIS.
Fill syringe and inject self. You might as well take a vial of SODIUM
PENTATHOL while you're here. Then go upstairs to Ace's Office.

Shoot the shadowy figure you see through the glass door. (You can drag the
thug from behind the desk if you want to.) Read Ace's files. Since you've
just run out of addresses and the antidote is beginning to work, you should
review the things you've found. Look at the map you found in the glove
compartment. This should cause a flash of memory giving you Address 4.

Fourth address
(1060 South Peoria St.) In Private Office, open safe using combination
found at 520 S. Kedzie. Take key (it might open the Mercedes trunk).

Mercedes trunk
The key from the safe unlocks it. Remove gag (drag with mouse). Give Mrs.
Sternwood a shot of SODIUM PENTATHOL. She will tell you Address 5.

Fifth address
(626 Auburn Rd.) Open mailbox. Take letter (ransom note). Use the door
knocker. Hit the butler. In Guest Room, open bedside table and take notepad.
Rub notepad with pencil (this is the Timetable). In Master Bedroom, get
briefcase and blackmail letter. (You may consume the chocolates.) In
kitchen, consume the bologna.

sixth address
(1060 South Peoria St.) You're almost back where you started. You should
have all the evidence you need to solve the case and become a hero; however,
there's one small problem. You still have the murder weapon and, no matter
how much evidence you have, the police just won't believe you. So, before
you go to the police, get rid of that gun!

Gun
Remember the Whirlpool in the sewer? Seems like a good place to lose a gun.

Police
When you have enough evidence and do not have a gun, go to the Police
Station. The three "important" bits of evidence are: The diary from
Vicker's house, the blackmail letter and the timetable from Sternwood's
bedroom.

Red, Green and Blue skulls, will give you a very good weapon, full fire
power and the best ship speed!!!

If you have all the markings for a new rank, and than buy more rank
markings, you will instead buy a new rank!!

When a smart bomb have exploded and the gems are falling down, you can
collect them by holding down the joystick!

If you have one weapon type and catch the same weapon, you will get some
more firepower!

If you have caught two aliens and the scope is activ, you can get a lot of
points by bounching the aliens of the screen!!

If you have a multiply when entering the meteor-storm you may get a lot of
points

Having a multiply activ when completing the game, will give you a lot of
points.

Catching a warp-icon in an alien stage with a bonus level, will give you a
perfect bonus score!!

Completing the Meteor-Storm will give you 100000 points and 1000 in cash!!!
and if you... hmm.. he he..

If you have the rank of Admiral and you buy more rank markings you will get
1.000.000 points

You can figure out what skull you have not taken by looking at the color of
the meteors in the meteor-storm

By shooting the hurry-up ship you can collect the rank markings that you are
missing!!

When the hurry-up ship have appeared 8 times, a money ship will appear,
shooting this ship can give you a lot of money!!!

Catching a skull will add to the chances that extra life and cash multiplyer
bonuses appear!!!!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pressing Joystick Button will speed up meteors in meteor storm !

If you have 4 lives and you buy or get one more you will get instead ship
armour (saves 200 cash).

If you die during a warp malfunction, the game skips the tax-free shop and
the next level. You can use this to your advantage in the harder levels,
especially in the Big Trouble stages. So make sure you have plenty of lives
left. When you get to the level you want to skip, especially Big Trouble,
just pray for a warp malfunction! If you get a warp malfunction, just kill
yourself once (It's a good idea not to do this until there's only one alien
left on the screen).

It is generally not a good idea to spend any credits until you have 500.
When you get 500 credits, buy the Super Weapon.

If you hold down <FIRE> (make sure to disable autofire if you have it on)
from the moment you grab the Meteor Storm icon right up to the end of the
Meteor Storm, you will get the secret $5000 bonus.

It is not a good idea to buy the $3000 weapon until you're in levels 51-75.

The weapons that cost $750 and higher are generally not very handy unless
you have autofire. If you do have autofire and have one of these weapons,
what you have is an incredibly nasty weapon!

You can also "cheat" by using a hex editor and editing the main program.
Just find the part of the code that lists all the prices in the tax-free
shop (make sure they are not part of the menu, if you modify the menu in
any way the game won't run!) and change the numbers to whatever you want.
This way, you can make everything cost nothing if you want! However, you'll
still need $50 to enter the shop, and $400 for continues.

If you want to be sure to earn a profit in your first month of DETROIT,
you can plug the following number values into the appropriate places in
the tutorial (see "Technical Supplement and Tutorial" booklet). They will
guarantee you a reasonable return for at least your dirst few months in
business. The first set of values gives you hints, the second set gives
you decent, but not optimal exact numbers, and the third set gives you the
absolute best numbers.

Important Tutorial Change: When you first start the game, you will now see
a difficulty panel appear with possible settings. The toughest setting is
LOAN, where your company starts off in debt to the bank, with no capital
funds. The easier the setting you choose, the more money your company will
have as a beginning stake. In order for these numbers to work in the
tutorial, set the difficulty level as medium.

	7 * Haloros-cut and condense.
	7 * Igele-normal and heat.

Although this uses up a lot of ingredients, it makes your dragon unbeatable
in a duel and devastating when attacking villages - it can kill over 1000
people in any one attack! The dragon will have full speed, strength,
wisdom, eyesight and health.

Place two eggs in incubation on full heat. Look in books at ongoing
battles, then record them on paper; now go to the map of Anrea. Send your
dragon to a town with a population of about 900 on a conquer and keep
mission (Hanmon / Olom are good). Do not buy anything from the traders
yet. End your turn.

MONTH TWO

Go to the map of Anrea, then return the dragon to the lair and inspect
conquered villages and towns. Cast the following spell on town:
	3 * Tius-normal and heat
	4 * Churl-normal and heat
	2 * Acrus-grind and condense
	1 * Churf-normal and heat

This spell should make the village or town into a city with over 1000
inhabitants. If more churl is added it will become even bigger, always
remember to calm the mixture down if it becomes too potent; chife is very
useful. Raise the taxes to full and repeat the spell if desired., perhaps
twice. Check in the library to see if your dragon is guarding a piece of
the talisman. If he is note the name of the town or city. End your turn.

MONTH THREE

Forget about the city, it should grow without your help, sprouting towns
all by itself. Meanwhile, send out your mega-dragon to beat up other
towns. For example if your city is at war with someone else, go out and
kill that village or town. If any town with a population greater than 1000
is at war, send your dragon on a return after task mission to conquer the
enemies. The reward depends on how badly the enemy has been hit. With
this dragon, the whole town is usually knocked out completely, with huge
loss of life - sometimes the whole population is wiped out!

THE FOLLOWING MONTHS

Once dragons have hatched, try to find a trader who can sell you the right
ingredients for a mega-dragon. Keep using spells on new towns formed from
the original, soon you could have as many as 30 tax-giving cities.It's
possible to have an income of up to 1000 gelds per month. With this sort
of income you're sailing. Watch the health of your dragons, and, unless
you know of any good spells for eggs or humans, don't waste ingredients on
them. Soon you should have an invincible army of eight mega-dragons. If
you attack all the other townes, the other two players are in trouble.

Although the training missions are easy, they are usually a waste of time.
Just set zeal to medium and you can easily remove on average village. If
zeal is set to high super-dragons usually wipe out the townes they are
attacking, instead of just conquering them.

Never avoid other player's dragons a you can always beat the hell out of
them and sometimes kill them - but keep your eye out for enemy dragons.

Soon you may be able to buy ingredients in enormous quantities; your
maximum is 99.

CHURL		A useful ingredient for growth of towns/dragons
		Buy as much as possible taking egg costs into account

One can play easy mode and still access all the screens. Here's what to do:

Select the hardest possible setting before starting the game,
this includes not only hard mode but also disabling that obnoxious
'flip screen' feature and choosing only three lives. Then click on the
'game' icon and do as if you were to start the game. When the
prompt bar says 'Click to play' instead choose the 'exit' icon and this
will bring you back to the startup menu. Now you can select the easy mode
and more lives and you will still be able to see all the screens assuming
you're deft of hand enough to get to them in easy mode. Hope this helps!

Boot up disk 2 to create new characters. When you are asked for the first
name while creating a member, type "SUPERVISOR" and press <RETURN>. Now
enter a normal name for the character and continue the creation process.
When you use this team of characters, the game works as usual except that
you have some key options:
Press <F10> and all wounds are healed and dead characters are resurrected.
Press <CTRL> when a monster appears and <RETURN>, the monster should do a
half turn. Use this time to turn and run.

Or you may enter "31415927" as name and press <RETURN>. Then enter a normal
name for the character. This will give all your characters higher
attributes.

Both cheats may be activated. Just enter "31415927" and press <RETURN>.
Next enter "SUPERVISOR" and press <RETURN>. Then enter a normal name for
the character.

All armor, treasure and weapons inside palaces are restocked every time you
enter. Send the strongest character in to grab the equipment, then distribute
it among your band. If you need some quick gold, do this repeatedly, then
go see the weaponsmith.

Get all the expirence points you want by going to Prince Haagkens castle.
Make your way past the bats, past the first fireplace with the trap to the
second fireplace. In front of the fireplace is a switch that activates a
door two or three rooms farther on in the castle when you step on it. This
door leads to a water fountain. Looking into the fountain transports you to
a room filled with water that has a never ending supply of water monsters.
Take your best weapon and armour with you. Set your character on 'auto kill'
and if he or she is able to hang in there, you can leave the character in
the room for several hours or all night killing off zillions of monsters.
Do this for each of your characters and you'll easily be able to kill the
giant dragon.

Solution:

 1) EQUIP YOUR CHARACTER! You start the game with equipment, but none of
it is readied.
 2) Enter the very first castle you see. One of the red symbols will turn
off the force fields. Touching the wrong one will cause monsters to
appear. If you win the combat, leave the castle and save the game. You
will be able to aquire experience this way. Explore the castle and you
will find better armor and weapons.
 3) Up the stairs and to the left you will find the Prince's apartments.
When you enter each room, be sure that you are not in "auto-attack" mode,
or the Prince will walk all over you. The Prince will give you a message
to take to his sister, and directions to the castle.
 4) Go to the Princess of Earth's castle, and the return to the Prince of
Earth. He will give you (bad) directions to the next castle, the Prince
of Water's.
 5) Use the "unlock" spell to hold the drawbridge open. Go thru the
castle, and you will pick up some AWESOME armor and weapons. If you find
that you cannot survive in here, you need to either TRAIN or VISIT THE
WEAPONSMITH (see note below).
 6) From this point, I had no clue what to do, but stumbled across it
anyway. From the WeaponSmith's go north to the Prince of Air's castle.
You should recieve a ring that will lead you to the Princess of Air's
castle (due west, in case you have trouble finding it).
 7) In the Princess of Air's castle go thru the first door to the right, and
the continue along until you find the Princess of Earth. She give you her
gem, and tell you to go to the Princess of Water's castle (which until this
point has been impossible to enter). From this point the gameflow was very
easy to follow.
 8) Visit the Princess of Water, and she will tell you to go kill the
Prince of Earth (he's a weenie. piece of cake, really), and give you a
real nice weapon and some cool armor to help you.
 9) Kill the Prince of Earth and take his gem.
10) Return to the Princess of Water. She will give you her gem, and
direct you to the Princess of Fire's castle (again, you should not have
been able to enter here yet... I was able to, I assume this is a bug).
11) At the Princess of Fire's castle you will get yet another gem. And you
will meet the Prince of Air, who will instruct you to kill his sister, the
Princess of Air.
12) Kill the Princess of Air and take her gem. (Another easy combat,
compared with what is to follow...) On leaving the castle the Prince of
Air will meet you and give you his gem. He will note that you do not have
the Prince of Water's gem (real swift ain't he?), and tell you to go get
him. Also he tells you that the armies of the conspiracy surround the
Prince of Fire (go team go! :-).
13) Go to the Prince of Water's castle. You will find him where there,
even though he was not there the last time you entered.

NOTES:

TRAINING- When you are low level, you can increase your experience by
deliberatly touchiing the wrong elemental symbol in the foyer of any
castle with symbols, and then killing them. Over, and over, and over....

WEAPONSMITH- Following the road north from the Princess of Earth (or the
Princess of Water), you will find the WeaponSmith's. This is a good place
to visit if you find yourself getting killed a lot. He will sell you some
improved armor and weapons over what you start with. If you play your
cards right, you can get MUCH MUCH better equipment than the WeaponSmith
has from various castles.

AUTO-ATTACK- Unless you are certain that you are in a hostile castle (like
the Prince of Water's), it is a good idea NOT to have "auto-attack" on.
When you meet a new creature, hit the greet button. If it responds with
something like "You seem to be glorious warriors..." or "Hello.." or
something that does not seem terribly unfriendly, leave them alone and
they won't bother you! This is EXTREMELY important when dealing with the
Dragon Princes!

The red ellipses are the eight castles, which are specified according to
the key at the end of this file.

The red boxes are houses, tents, and igloos. Typically you will recieve
hints from th occupants of the same. They are also a good place for a
low-level party to spend the mid-nights when attacks from the
constellations are most frequent.

The red boxes with a cross inside represent the temples where healing is
available. The temple in the desert is especially important. It is the
"hermit of the sands", who dishes out clues in the form of riddles.

The little crosses are graveyards. Anyone who disturbs these deserves
what he gets. (I learned after the first time).

The extremely small crosses at the north end of roadways are teleporters.
They exist in matched pairs. The two in the green areas will transfer
between themselves, as do the two in the swamp area. The one teleporter in
the ice plains will send you to the far south-east one in the desert, but
either desert teleporter will send you to the ice plains.

The two white lines that run north-south between the Prince and Princess
of Earth's castles is a double row of north-pointing arows, whos function
I've not yet ascertained. The wise traveller does not cross this. (Same
deal as graves. It only takes once.)

The numbers are:
 1 Prince of Earth (Hordthken) castle. You should go here first.
 2 Princess of Earth (Hordthka) castle.
 3 Prince of Water (Haaggkhen) castle.
 4 Prince of Air (Naakhtkhen) castle.
 5 Princess of Air (Naakhtka) castle.
 6 Princess of Water (Haaggkha) castle.
 7 Princess of Fire (Hazhulkha) castle.
 8 Prince of Fire (Hazhulkhen) castle.
 9 Weapon shop. You NEED to go here if you wanna live!
10 Temple of Redemption.
11 Tavern. Trade hints for Jade (only use I've found for it).

PLAYERS GUIDE:
When you find yourself outside it is still possible to escape form a
monster. It is very easy but you must be quick. The method is as follows:
When the monster appears press the return button you will automatically do
a half turn, then take advantage of this and run a way. Beware, if you
stay in the same place the monster will return. This trick is very useful
especially when you're not feeling 100% on form.
To help guide you in the exterior world (outside dungeons), note that the
sun rises in the east and of course sets in the west. Following the moon
can be found in the south. Another way of guidance is observing the shape
of the mountains. For this method it is best if you draw a small plan to
help you guide you when you move. Certain monsters are poisonous for
example, certain monsters, spiders, snakes and maybe even the scorpions.
If you have been stung by them you will not die by there sting, but your
life points will go down until you are dead. After each fight you must
check you fitness. If you see the word 'poisoned' drink the flask(if you
have it). If not you must look for it immediately. You can also escape
this tinging situation by using the healing powers of the group. When you
are with hordtkhen, the dragon prince of the first dungeon go immediately
to the sister hortkhen who can be found due south. With a little luck you
will find the temple. It is the magic place where you can get your
strenght together go to the field of magnetic force's, all you need to do
is press the button which can be found under the triangle with the point
on top. Then you can take the path to the left-be careful not to too
aggressive and you will find info. The door which you will see to the left
of you is the door for the kitchens and the cellars. Take the torch from
the kitchens. The door is locked wth a key that can be found somewhere in
the dungeon. And becareful because a snake lurks in the kitchen and the
cellars and it's poisonous.
When you are with hordtkhen, you can enter the armoury (the right hand
door at the entrance), but only at night because the guards are sleeping.
Once inside you can help your self to the arms that are there (these take
the form of swords and shields). If your magicain has enough experience
points you are going to beefit form quickly made spells. You can for
example use magic to quickly explore an unfamiliar dungeon. To send all
your troops to explore is dangerous. For this type of situation the
invisible spell is welcome. Do not attack everyone you meet you will
follow many paths and meet many strangers who are a vital source of info.
Saving a situation can only be carried out if your characters have come to
a stop.

1) Kill David Crane
-------------------

The first thing to do is pick up your credit card which can be found in
your wallet, lying on the left hand side of Eden's desk (bedroom). Leave
to the right and pick up the red cartridge lying on a crate at the top of
the room. Examine the microwave and you'll find a key which you need (I
forgot it and it left me in a right state!!) Next, go through the door on
the right, down the lift and into her garage. Pick up the screwdriver
lying on the car. Leave her flat altogether.

Go to your own flat, keying in 5106 at your door. Get the knife lying on
your bed and while you're at it, pick up a cup. Take the cup to your
kitchen (south) and use the tap (sink) with the cup to fill it with water.
Go back to your bedroom. Examine the cartridge of Eden's with your network
screen (put the card into the interface, click on screen etc.). You'll
get the code for Sartain Industries (7833 needed later on). Get the red
cartridge lying to left of the keyboard and examine this cartridge in a
similar way. This time log-on with "RYAN", password "BLACKDRAGON". Read
the file "PRIVATE" which will give you your friend, Louis' address.

Leave your flat and head towards Louis' house. Walk into the lobby and get
mugged (would you normally go somewhere where you KNOW you're going to be
mugged?!?). Once the thief goes away, go back into the lobby and head for
the room to the south. This is Louis' room. Punch in 5238 at the keypad
and in you go. First of all, walk to the unit on the left hand side (where
the microwave is). Examine it and you'll find Louis' pool-hall entrance
card. Examine the card itself by clicking on it with your right mouse
button, while in the inventory screen. This will give you the address of
the pool-hall. Go and have a chat with Louis who's sitting on the shitter.
He'll tell you where to get a gun from. Take both of his trainers which are
also in the toilet (nice friend you are!). Click on both trainers in the
inventory screen with the right mouse button to wear both shoes.

Leave Louis' flat and head towards Sparky's bar (Wehey! I've even got a bar
named after me, cool, huh? I'm not the fat slob behind the bar though
folks!). Go and talk to the bloke sitting at the bar. He'll tell you where
Crane is. Then have a bit chat with Sparky (friendly me, as always!) who'll
give you a loan providing you put your credit-card through the scanner on
the bar. Once you've got the loan, leave the bar and head towards the pool-
-hall.

Enter the pool-hall and talk to the assistant behind the bars. If you moan
on properly he'll let you use Louis' card to get in to the hall. So place
your card in the card reader and go inside. Use the lift and when you leave
go and talk to the barman who'll give you Mr. Silverman's door code (5222).
Keep walking to the left until you get to his door, punch in the code and
enter the room. Talk to Silverman and put your credit-card through the
reader. He'll the give you a gun. Take the gun and leave the pool-hall the
way you came in (unless you can find another way).

Outside, make your way to the Regency Hotel. Walk over to the tart at the
reception and book a room. She'll ask you for your credit-card, so stick
it in the scanner and out will pop a brown passcard. Pick it up and go to
the door on the north wall. Press the switch on the control box and go into
the lift. Use the lift control box with the passcard to take you up to your
floor. Leave the lift, walk to the left and then down towards the fire-point
at the bottom of the screen. Open the fire-point and get the axe. Then go
back to the lift. Once inside the lift, use your knife on the control box
to reveal a green wire. Again use your knife to cut the wire. This will
disable the lift. Now, in the top right hand corner of the lift is a handle.
Use it. You'll end up on top of the lift. Walk to the lift doors (south) and
use your axe to prise the doors open. Now don't get too excited with your
gun here -when you see the two guards, through your axe first. Then you can
use your gun to shoot the other guard. Hurry quickly to the left and down
in the next room which contains a rockery/pond. Wehey -you dirty git! Just
shoot Crane on his bed, never mind the bimbo. This will take you to The
Keepers.

Have a little chat with The Keepers if you wish. Head down through two rooms
until you get to the bottom where the purple crystal is. Pick it up. Go to
the room on your right and use the first door on your right. Once inside
use the key (which you got from the microwave!?!?) to destroy the plinth
and return you to your world.

2) Kill Sterling
----------------

I like this bit. Go home first of all and use your network screen to read
the newsnet. Read the "TVSPECIAL" and you'll remember how to get to the
Channel 6 studios. Leave your flat and go there. Walk all the way around
the building until you come to a road which has some brown numbered markings
on it. Go left here and talk to the old bloke behind the desk. After having
a nice friendly chat, kill him. Go to the control panel/desk and press some
buttons. This will allow you access into the building if you walk to the
left of the barrier.

Once inside, walk to the desk. Pick up the leaflet and drop it immediately.
This should reveal a green passcard on the desk. Take the passcard and
walk to the room on the left. Use the passcard to get into the cleaning
cupboard (bottom of this room). Walk over to the right of the cleaning
cupboard and you'll find a fusebox. Use your screwdriver to open it and a
brown fuse will fall out. Take the fuse and leave for the room where you
got the green passcard. This time go to the room on the right. Go up the
screen into the next room and use the ladders in the corner of the room.

Now the fun starts. Walk to the control box for the crane and open it.
Inside is a blown fuse. Throw it away and replace it with the new brown
fuse you got from the cupboard. Now activate the controls and squash the
poor sod below.

This time when you visit The Keepers, go down two rooms and to the left,
taking the first door. Put your key in the plinth etc as before.

3) Kill Sartain
---------------

On returning to the real world go back to Eden's flat. Her door number is
2865 as you should know. Go upstairs, back into her bedroom (let her get a
bath in peace) and examine her personal organiser. This is just beneath the
rotating fan. Press the "N" key (on the organiser) 5 times and you'll get
the address of Sartain Industries. Leave her flat and head towards Sartain
Inds. Use the code 7833 at the doorway and in you go. A really hard part
here -just blow up the computer screen with your gun and walk to the left.
Walk through the opening and closing doors, go up the lift and prepare for
a nice welcoming comittee.

Leave the lift and you'll see a couple of guards. Use your crystal here and
watch their guts fly all over the place. Go to the room south of here and
open the case. Get the document inside. Read it now if you want, or after
you kill Sartain. I'd read it now and get it over and done with. Next go
to the room on your right, up both flights of stairs and onto the roof.
Go to the left on top of the roof and shoot the plane/craft with your gun.

Once again you'll visit The Keepers. This time go south once and take the
door on your right..

4) Kill Miss Chapel
-------------------

As you appear in the car park, go left past the Mini (don't skit -I used to
have one!!). Grab the wire cutters from the back of the truck and leave the
car-park by walking upwards.

After reading that document you'll know where her house is. Go there, walk
towards the thick wall and climb over. Go south and.. oh dear, someone's
done you a favour. She's already dead. Never mind, pick up the blue
cartridge while you're here and leave (climb back over the wall and head
to the left).

5) Kill Underwood
-----------------

Go to the boathouse. At the entrance to the beach, grab the piece of
railing south of the entrance. Walk to the right, near the water. In this
screen you'll see a junction box under the sand above you. Use the junction
box and you'll wipe off the sand. Use it again with the piece of railing to
prise off the covering panel. Now use it again with your cup of water, see
things go bang and then climb through the hole in the window, to the right.
You'll see what's left of Underwood (not much). Kill her and back to The
Keepers where you want to go south two rooms and then left, taking the
second door..

6) Kill Beckett
---------------

This is where I had to cheat (twice -so if anyone knows how to do this
bit properly, please let me know!). Go home and examine the blue network
card you found at Chapel's house. What's the problem? Well, you'll have
to log-on as Beckett without properly knowing his password. Okay, its
"SEPTIMUS" but I didn't find that out by actually playing the game or
talking to anyone else!! Read the "BRIEF" file and you'll find out where the
old church is. Leave your flat and go to the church. Use the wire-cutters
on the right hand gate to gain access to the church. Proceed through the
doors and you'll see a skeleton. Get the hand lying next to it (to the
right of the skeleton). Keep going south until you arrive at the altar.

Remove the rubbish on the altar (two candlesticks and a white cloth). Just
pick them up and drop them. On the top of the altar is a hole. Place that
hand inside that hole (ooer!!). You'll hear a clunk. Now push the altar to
reveal a bigger hole. Slide yourself down the hole..

Now you'll find yourself in a tomb. There's a jar to the left. Examine it
and take the red ball. Place the red ball into the centre floor tile with
the three oblique holes. Now you can get the other two by moving the top
off the tomb. Place them both in the remaining holes and be sure to collect
the rock which is inside the tomb. Go through the open door to the right,
collect the two rocks in this next room and walk upwards. You'll find a
statue here which requires some thought to use properly. Again, I'm sure
you must get the correct symbol from somewhere else but I don't know where
so here's what to do: There are two parts of the statue which rotate.
Each part contains six markings with matching markings on the other part.
Start by keeping the top part still. Press the purple button and listen for
a clunk. If you hear a clunk, you can stop this procedure here. If you
don't hear a clunk, rotate the bottom piece by one and press the button
again. Repeat this until the bottom piece has turned six times (the original
marking will reappear). Now turn the top piece by one and repeat the process
of rotating the lower part and pressing the button. Get the idea -keep
doing it until you hear that clunk.

What a pain, eh? Okay, now you've heard that clunk move down south as far
as you can go and then go into the room on your right which will contain a
bed. In the upper right hand corner of the room hides a rock. Take it.
Leave the room, and keep going left, picking up any rocks you see on the
way. Then go up, picking up rocks if any. You'll see a room with a cart, go
left here and get the remaing rocks. You should collect 8 rocks in total;
load them all onto the cart and give it a push. It will move southwards and
create a hole in the southern wall, two screens below. Go through the hole
and then to your left.

Go south down the steps and you'll see the priest who's entered Entropy.
To the right hand side of this room is a hole. Go down this hole and walk
to your left, taking you onto a railway platform. Go upwards here, and
upwards on the next screen. You'll then see a hole in the wall on the left
hand side. Go through this hole and there's Beckett who'll give you a boring
lecture. Wait for him to shut up. Once he's shut his mouth, just LEAVE the
room as soon as you can. Don't waste time or you'll have to listen to his
crap all over again. If you manage to make it out of the room he'll get ran
over by a train and that's it!

It will be destroyed, another one will replace it and you'll receive

Go to the dungeon entrance and face the door. Cast the spell "OH EW RA".
You will see someone interesting.

To advance ninjas a level, stand in a hall and throw your weapons. Then
get them, and repeat. This also works with magic and fighter levels.
Cast a spell at the air, or slash and bash until you gain a level.

For a bit of nastiness, return to the entrance with the Firestaff, but leave
the power gem behind.

Halk isn't as stupid as you think, give him magic objects and he will
gain enough spell points to cast LO. Have him keep casting this and his
magic powers will develop.

Here are some undocumented spells:

     YA BRO ROS - Leaves a trail of footprints
	 VI BRO - Shield poison
     DES IR SAR - Darkness
   FUL BRO NETA - Fire ball shield
     OH KATH RA - Lightning Bolt
	     ZO - Open doors
	 DES EW - Weakens non-corperal (undead) beings

There is nothing wrong with equipping your characters with cursed armour (so
says the person who wrote into the magazine).
This will cause you to have incredibly fewer injuries from the enemy.
Apparently this is why the enemy knights have such a low armour class.

CREATURE/ITEM LIST AND HINTS:

			LEVEL 1 - Hall Of Champions

FOOD		MISCELLANEOUS
Water Flask	Torch
Cheese
Corn
Apples (2)
Bread (2)

No monsters are encountered on this level. You should choose your party
members carefully. A well-balanced party may get you farther than four of the
most powerful champions of the same type. Use this level to practice wielding
weapons and casting spells. It will give you an idea of which champions you
may wish to bring along on your adventure. If you have no idea who to take,
try these four: Zed, Tiggy, Azizi, and Wuuf.

Be sure to monitor your champions' stats, fatigue, and hunger on this level
as well. Notice how much food and water it takes to restore stats, and bed
down for a while to monitor stat regeneration. Food and water are plentiful
in the early dungeon levels, but become very scarce as you go on. Conserve!
Make a note on your map where you may have left food so that you can return
there in a pinch.

As you encounter monsters in the lower levels, be sure to have all of your
party members participate in battles. Your champions experience levels raise
in proportion to how much they accomplish or attempt. Plan team efforts
before battling.

Conserve torches.
Use light spells when possible, and store your torches away for those times
when MANA is important.

Scrolls themselves have no use, other than to provide guidance and
instructions. You may wish to use the scrolls as path markers.

On this level, fill your water flask(s) and find/store all food.

If one of your champions dies, be sure to pick up their bones and equipment
if possible.

Learn which champion can cast which spells. Eventually, you will notice
which spells/potions kill each type of monster easily.

Learn which weapons work best with which champions.

All 24 characters exist here frozen in pictures. By clicking on one the
inventory will be displayed along with the option to resurrect or
reincarnate.
Resurrecting a character will return him / her to life exactly as
before death, retaining all attributes.
Reincarnating a character will return him / her to life, but
without previous attributes.

						Chests (2)

Screamers make for a good meal. Mummies are dangerous, and you must hit and
move in order to kill them this early on (keep in mind where you saw an altar).
A couple of things to note on battles....closed gates can be an asset, and
what is dangerous to your party is also dangerous to monsters.

Recover any thrown weapons after a battle. If some are missing, a monster
may have picked it up. Find and kill it.

Do not be stopped by closed/locked doors. Where there is a will, there is a
way. Sound is as important as sight, so turn up the volume!

On this level you will encounter two seemingly impenetrable barriers: a
door and a force field. They have a lot to do with each other, and one of them
can be violated.

CAST YOUR INFLUENCE: This is a two-part obstacle. You must use two distinct
aspects of your champions abilities in the correct order; the first is a
spell.

GENERAL NOTES: If your champion has not enough MANA to chant a spell in
total, chant as many syllables as possible and then sleep. When you awaken
you can chant the remainder of the spell. You may pre-chant a spell for
each champion and keep them at the ready in case you run into some
surprising situations. You should also know by now that objects/weapons to
be used must be placed in right hand. Best use of chests is to store one
type of item together in each chest (food in one, clothing and armour
in another, etc).

`SMALL DETAILS CAN HIDE GREAT REWARDS' - Press button on the wall for a
Falchion.
Two pressure pads in room with gate - step on first pad, then step
right, two forward, one left,and out.
Large room with gate and 9 pressure pads - forward 3 steps, back
one, forward 2 steps, back 1, forward and out.
Pressure pad with rock laying nearby - place rock on pad to open gate.
`STEP INSIDE, TAKE A RIDE' - step into transporter and search the floor.
Pressure pad and tap door - place an item on the pad t close the pit.
Pressure pad with writing on wall - it says nothing useful, continue.
Large room with pressure pad and green button wall - press button to open
gate and step around pad to leave.
Blue transporter and open pit - place an item on floor to close the
pit and search the floor.
Wooden door closes as you approach - wall says "None shall pass" -
simply chop door with a sword to get a chest.
"THIS FOUNTAIN ACCEPTS ONE WISH' - Put a coin in fountain to open door.
Unopenable gate with sword behind - continue around corner and
throw switch on wall.  Go back to find gate open and throw switch to open
secret room in place you've just come from.

VAULT: Don't horde -all- the money you find. Key word in the phrase is
'cast'. Remember other means of opening doors besides keys, buttons,
switches, or pads. Some things cannot simply be taken, but must instead be
'exchanged'.

TIME: Hit and run 4 left, 2 forward. Recall one aspect of CAST YOUR
INFLUENCE. Trap door works just like other encountered, except the trigger
might not be where you expect it to be.

GUARDIANS: Following the chest is one way of acquiring it. Think about what
you do with a mirror and don't leave the immediate area without using it.

MATRIX: Remember, walls are important to notice. Use object you found upon
entering this dungeon level or you may become a bit disoriented.

GEM: Pits are the pits, so lose some of your less important objects. Again,
watch the walls.

GENERAL NOTES: It is often helpful to find a small room close by when you
need to sleep; simply close the door and your party will be sufficiently
safe. Many times you will move so quickly that you will pass right by
wall switches which open doors and secret panels. Remember that running and
closing a gate may be the ticket to killing monster parties. Doors and
gates closing on a being will cause much damage.

On entering level three, take 8 paces forwards, button on left wall
opens secret passage. A fast run is required to get through transporter.
`CHOOSE YOUR DOOR, CHOOSE YOUR FATE' - six cryptic rooms. One
golden key is to be looked for in each room.
The Matrix. Enter room, 2 steps right, 6 steps forward, turn left,
4 steps forward, turn right, press button in alcove, proceed the way you
were going to find a secret room.
Time is of the Essence: Blue button on the wall. `Hit and Run'.
Press button and quickly move 4 steps left, one forwards to get through wall.
Blue button and open pit - press button and turn quickly to see a
transporter, throw a fairly heavy item into it to hut pit.
Second blue button and pit - Press button and immediately take 2
paces back while pit is shut (this pit can be opened for your exit by a
blue button further in).
Creature Cavern: Fight your way through the monsters to the gold key.
Chambers of the Guardian: The last of the seven rooms contains a
chest. Press the blue button and a transporter moves the chest to another
room, repeat this until the chest appears outside the last room. Use
mirror of dawn to open secret room half way along corridor.
The Vault: `You must pay for your entrance' - 2 gold coins. `Cast
your influence, cast your might' - ZO spell to open door, then throw an
item onto pad to close pit.
Take silver coin and replace it with something to keep the door
open, use the silver coin to open the next door.
Open chest and use coins to open secret room on your right, enter
room and press button to open secret room back the way you came.
Room of Gem: Place an object on the pad to close pit. Blue button
opens gate and also open the pit behind you. Turn around and throw object
back onto pad.
Find secret button at end of passages. Press to open a secret room
and retrieve the gem. You can now return to the entrance and open the
door by placing gem in slot provided.
When all rooms have been completed you will have 6 gold keys, use
them to leave the level. Just before the stairs, to leave the level, you
will find a wooden door which can be opened by one of the gold keys. In
the room are some useful objects and a button on the wall. Press the
button to open a secret room a few paces back down the corridor.

A second staircase is around somewhere which leads back to previous level.
There is a room here which contains Screamers. Open door, kill Screamers, get
food. Close door, re-open door and Screamers are there again. Nice food
supply.

Purple Worms are just as dangerous to you as that first mummy you encountered
in level two. Circle and hit them. Move, hit, move.

Be sure to examine aqueducts.

Don't take short cut the first time. Come back to it later.

If you find the 'prisoner' you will be near staircase leading down a level.
Heed the writing or you will have more work to do. As long as prisoner is
imprisoned, so are you.

Bow raises Ninja level very slowly. Best use it later when you find slayer
arrows.

Lock Picks are worthless.

`DON'T LET A CLOSED DOOR STOP YOU' - Chop down with axe.
Coin slot in wall turn on blue haze, use unknown.
`SHORT CUT' and key hole - Use gold key to turn on transporter.
Step in and appear further on.
`THIS IS MY PRISONER, LET HIM SUFFER' - Throw something to kill the
prisoner, it opens your exit at the end of the level.
Chop closed door.

First door: This room is full of transporters. Step into this room
and move in the following order: right, back, forward, left, right, back.
Keep an eye on the floor as you do this.
OPen pit: behind you is a lever to close pit.
Second door: Smaller of two rooms. Button in wall door. Larger of
two rooms. Buttons around the wall reveal more buttons until correct
combination is achieved and secret panel opens.
Third door: On entering the large room, turn right and walk into
corner where you will find a button. Press and walk back past the
entrance to the other corner. Turn right and walk to the next corner.
Turn right and walk until you find passage on left. Forget walking
straight across room as it ever becomes never ending.
Fourth Door: There are two passages on the other side of pits. The
one on the left cannot be accessed until level six. The one on the right
is reached by making your way through the pits on the right. A number of
attempts may be needed before the pits close in the correct order.
When all rooms have been explored, return to the starting corridor,

Magic box: Wall ring.

`I AM ALL, I AM NONE' - nothing.
`HARD AS ROCKS, BLUE AS SKY. TWINKLE IN A WOMAN'S EYE' - Blue Gem.

door on the left. Nearly opposite is a metal ring set in the wall, press
this to open a secret passage. Towards the end of the passage is another
secret passage opened with a button on the wall.
Stuck between two gates with a blue haze turning on and off - cast
a spell to open the gate then take off armour to move faster and run through
the haze.

further on.

staircase leading up. This is the way to the restricted area on level 5 in
the pit room.
Do not enter the transporter saying "Ha Ha Ha", you will end up
back on level 5.
Towards the end of the level is a passage with a lever at one end
and a gate and transporter at the other. Ignore the transporter - it only
takes you to an earlier part of the level. To enter the room you must throw
the lever and move quickly to the gate and enter before it closes.

Keys are important on this level. Needed are 1 Master Key, 1 Ruby Key, and 4
RA Keys. RA Keys are found on levels 3, 7, 9, and 12.

Although all the following information guides you through level 7,
on first entering the level you can only open one gate (with a Ra key).
The other three Ra keys and other keys must be obtained from lower levels.
`THE TOMB OF THE FIRESTAFF' - after passing through the first 3
doors that require Ra keys, you ill come across 4 rooms on the right. Only
one of these can be opened with the turquoise key that you will find on this
level. A lift of items to be found within these rooms was given in an
earlier part of this guide (I hope, I only copied this document from the
beginning of `CONDENSED MAD MAN'S RAMBLINGS' Part One).
`DANGER, ENTER WITH CAUTION' - First you will find alcoves that may
prove rewarding. As you turn right along a corridor with short passages on
the right, a button will be found on the left wall (three and a half
passages along). Press this button to open a passage on your return
journey.
In the room at the end of corridor will be found a Turquoise key
under some ashes. To the left is a button that opens a passage at the end
of which are some scrolls and a Ra key.
On your alcove to the room with the alcoves you will find a passage
has opened in front of you. Enter, turn right, left and seven paces
forward to find a button on your left. Press the button and walk back the
way you came to find the winged key has been revealed. Travel down the
corridor, it is a direct route to level 13. Open pan and return.
Return to the `DANGER, ENTER WITH CAUTION' door. Opposite is
another corridor at the end of which are some very useful items. Leave
this corridor and open the door on your left with the Ra key. Walk along
this corridor for some distance taking many turns to find the Ra key.
Don't hang around when you find the firestaff You now need the Power Gem
from level 14.
Ruby key opens `ENTER WITH CAUTION' door.
Master key opens door to retrieve Firestaff.

On long hallway, take 26 steps, turn around, and wait until door opens.
Chasing Thieves will most times lead you to nastier monsters.

Level 8 consists of a very large room with a number of secret
passages, also numerous pits.
Around the wall you will find a short corridor with a chest and two
holes in the wall. The holes fire fireballs which pass through various
blue hazes and travel around the room. At the start of this passage you
will find a button on the wall. Press it to open a secret panel behind the
blue haze on your right. Press the green button behind this panel to
switch off the haze and thus stop the fireball from hitting you as you
search this level. If you stand with your back to the fireballs and walk
forwards you come to the end of the wall. Step around this to the other
side and take a further 10 steps forwards to find a key in front of you.
One of the buttons around the wall will reveal a series of passages
culminating in what seems to be an endless passage. In effect you are
being transported back to the start of the passage. Stand with your back
to the beginning and take 26 paces forwards, then turn right and wait for a
moment for a panel to open. You will find a gate behind which is a button
on the left wall. Press to open a secret room.
One passage you will find will end in a gate (you should have a
solid key on you to open it). At the end of the passage you will find a
skull on the wall. Use the skeleton key that you found in the chest to
open a secret panel. You will find a number of these in the levels to
come. Always open them to reveal access to the master staircase which
begins on level 8 and finishes on level 14., opening on all the levels in
between.
If you drop down one of the pits in the room you will find a series
of corridors. Search them to find another pit at the bottom of which is a
Yew staff.

`WHEN IS A ROCK NOT A ROCK' - Take one step left and walk through
the wall. It is a good idea to mark this place in case you need to return
in a hurry. Turning left will bring you into a gated room. Search for a
button to open a secret room.
A short distance after you pass the wall you can walk through, on
your right, is an invisibly field which turns you through 180°. This can
be confusing, so don't rush.
After passing through a gate, keep to the left while searching for
a button to open a secret room.
The next gate you come to will lead to some downward stairs, ignore
these, there is nothing in the room below.
You will find an unopenable gate with a chest beyond and a lever on
the right. The lever opens a pit dropping the chest into a room below
(mentioned earlier). With the pit closed, explore the passage to your
right to find an upward staircase. Go up and you will find a pit to your
right which will will drop you behind the gate. Search for a button before
dropping down the pit.
`WHAT IS UNDER FOOT IS SOON OVERHEAD' - the passage ahead has 3
floor buttons on each side. As you step on each, a fireball is fired at
you. You must place an item on each floor button moving away quickly to
avoid being hit (this only needs to be done on one side).
Two exits are found on the other side of the floor buttons. The
left hand one takes you through a series of passages and rooms at the end
of which you will find a button to open a secret room.
`LIGHTER THAN A FEATHER' - Corbamite weighs nothing, use it to open
the gate by placing it in the alcove.
The last gated room on this level contains an important item.

`BEWARE OF MY TWISTED HUMOUR, THE DECEIVER, THE SNAKE' - you must
snake your way through the pillars, going first to the extreme left, the
right, left, and right again, to find an opening on your left. Which ever
passage you use the key of B to open, they both end up at the same point.
Check the items dropped by anything you kill, to find a second key of B to
get you out.
`ZOOOOOM' - as you step on the first pad you will be moved around
the room until you successfully step off into the passage on the other
side. Precise timing is required to get off the moving pads. Halfway
round the room you will find a blue haze with a space beside it. If you
decide to enter this space, be careful, as the haze will transport you to
the very beginning of the level.
The next gate you come to opens into a large irregularly shaped
room. If you press the button just after the gate you will release
monsters that are held in fields around the room. If you walk straight
ahead of you, you will come to monsters guarding a button to open a short
secret passage to the right.
As you leave this room, the fields containing the monsters will be
turned off releasing them. As you travel along the corridor you will find
a gated room on the left, enter and search for a button to open a secret
panel. This room may be transported back to a later stage.
A monster will drop a skeleton key when killed in the passages to
come, so look out for it.
Two secret rooms are to be found in the following corridors so
check in the following corridors so check the walls and back track to find
the rooms after pressing buttons which have no obvious immediate effect.
You will soon come to two gates almost side by side, these should
be closed to allow you time to plan ahead, and when threatened, to run back
and fight from.
Further along the passage you will find another two gates a little
further apart than the previous two, they should be closed as before.
A room will be found with a brown button on the wall, this button
transports you back to the room mentioned earlier. This could be useful if
trapped by some pursuing monsters.

Portions of this level are not mappable.
Beware poison traps.

POISON ROOM: Get sword, stay till cloud clears, kick trap, move back.
CLOCKWISE ROOM: Start at writings, move counter clockwise.

As you enter this level you will be confronted with a rectangular
passage room. There are four of these rooms and an invisible transporter
moves you between them. Following figure shows transporters (T), a
staircase (S), a gate (G), and a chest (C). W marks the location of the
secret panel

which is your key out. As you move around the rooms you must find a key to
open the gate in room number 4. This gate will not open immediately, step
back and wait for a moment. Open the chest and take out the key. This
must be turned in the keyhole on the wall of one of the rooms to open the
panel and allow you out.
When you finally escape the rooms, go down the corridor to the
right and through the gate. You are in the passage with many holes in the
wall. Go to the end of the passage, you will find a useful item. When you
pick up this item the corridor will fill with poison gas. Have plenty of
VI options handy and wait until the gas has gone while drinking the porions
to stay alive. Once you have survived the gas, regain your strength
because the next step forwards will release gas further along and fire 2
poison darts at you. Two more, more gas. Be patient, let all the gas
clear and you will survive this puzzle.
Search the next gated room to find a handy weapon.
As you search further you will come to a short passage just around
a right turn with another short passage behind you on your left. Step back
around the corner and wait a moment for the panel to open. You will find a
button on the right wall where the panel was. Press to reveal skeleton key.
You will come to a gate behind which are three gates. On the floor
is a Cross key to open only one of them, they all lead to the same place.
You need to find copper coins in the passages to use later on. The centre
door is probably the easiest to get through. Search carefully for those
copper coins. When you have emerged from your chosen passage, find the
exit gate (far right). Search carefully in the corridors to come, for a
butt to open a secret room.
Later you will come to double gates. Beyond these is a left turn
leading to a gate after which you can use your skeleton key.
`ENLARGE MY VIEW' - Use the magnifier to open a secret panel, step
on the pad to find the ruby key.

At the end of the passage with the double gates is a room with 7
coin slots in the wall. Copper coins will open wall alcoves containing
useful items.

Open number 4 first to reveal more copper coins. If you don't have
enough coins for all the slots, open 5, take the cross key and walk all the
way back to the start of the three gates where you first used a cross key,
and explore another passage for more copper coins.

One of the Knights has a key you need. Spells do not affect him.
Some spiders proliferate more than others.
A distinct monster boundary is in place. Use it to your advantage.

At the end of the first corridor is a large room. Tow paces right
into room are a series of pits opened and closed by the pressure pad you
just stepped on. You can see a broken black line when the pit is open.
Taking the right hand exit from the pit room you pass a gate
requiring a key to open. Keep to the left and enter a small room, press
the large button found here on the left in an alcove and return to the pit
room. Now take the other exit, ignore the gate on the right and enter
another larger room. In the middle of this room is a small room with a key
in it. Take the key and return to the room you passed which required a key
(mentioned earlier). After this door has been opened, the monster within
must be killed to make it drop a key, dropping it down a pit in the other
room is advised. You must then climb down to retrieve the key. Use the
rope to get down, if you picked it up on an earlier level, if not, you will
have to drop down.

			LEVEL 13 - Black Lord Level

WEAPONS 	MISCELLANEOUS		CREATURES

Have a fire extinguisher at the ready.

You are now near the end of your quest. You must get rid of the
demons first. The passage you walk along cannot be entered by any
creatures, including Lord Chaos. You can use magic at range. The fire
elements can be done away with by repeated fusing with the Firestaff.
The best pace to take on Lord Chaos is in the room on the far left.
If you succeed you will be rewarded with an impressive show.

			LEVEL 14 - Dragon Level

WEAPONS 	KEYS		MISCELLANEOUS	CREATURES
Eye Of Time	Plain		Crown		Dragon
Power Gem			Various Gems
				Crown
				Silver Coins
				Gold Coins

TO KILL DRAGON: Lead him back to stairway you came down and attack him.
When you see fireball coming, go up stairs.
POWER GEM IN LOCKED ROOM: Rebirthing chamber, so save coins...only way in.
TO GET POWER GEM TO MERGE WITH FIRESTAFF: Use the Zokathra spell.

SPELL LIST:
The power symbols are required for all spells. Power effects the strength
and duration of the spell. All potions require a empty flask.

Use the winged key to gain access to the Dragon level. This is
aptly named as it is guarded by only one dragon, which is the most
resilient monster you will ever encounter.
Travel along the corridor until you find a lever on the wall - this
opens a panel to the main room where you will find the dragon, to be
careful!
Just as you enter the room you will find a pile of ashes under
which is the square key. Carefully move to the left of the room where you
will find the door to open with the key. Near the door are scattered a
number of items, one of which (the eye of time) could prove extremely
useful. Pass through the door. In front of you is a power gem, encased in
a field which must be broken. Use a ZO KATH RA spell to get the gem.
When the gem is free, hold the firestaff up and click the mouse to join the
two. You now have the most powerful weapon to be found within the dungeon.
The door on your left is opened by placing a silver coin in the
slot provided - there is a coin on the floor to the left of the door. This
room only contains an alter of rebirth but is very useful for evading the
dragon.
You will find that the staircase you entered down is now closed.
You must go to the staircase at the opposite end of the dragon room, this
will take you to level 13.

a) Go to the Adventures Guild, and load in one of the characters given at
the start (let's say you chose Amber).
b) Create five new characters, of any race or type. Make sure that all
five people have at least 130 gold pieces.
c) Go to the weapon shop, and pool all the gold, giving it to Amber.
d) Go back to the Adventurers Guild and remove all players but Amber.
e) Now load in the other five characters that are pre-made at the start
of the game. You can now start your quest with somewhere in the region of
1000 gold pieces - unless you kit everyone up at the weapon store, train,
etc. You can repeat this as many times as you want each go, giving you in

Type "CHEAT" on the title screen for infinite lives. <F1> to <F6> or
<1> - <6> skips levels, and typing "NUDE" will let you play the boxing
sub-game.

On the highscores enter your name in as "PURPLE RAIN". You will now get
infinite lives and you can skip through the levels by pressing <-> and <+>.

While playing, pause the game using <F9> then hold down <LEFT SHIFT> key,
<1>, and <HELP>. Now unpause with <F10>. Or do the following.

Type in "CHEAT MODE" on the title screen.

You now can skip levels with <F2>.
