@remark C
After playing the game for a while and building up your stores save the
game. Now quit the game and go into your current save game directory and
make a copy of the base.dat file. Now boot the game back up and sell
everything you have (if you need money) or transfer stores (not ships or
personel) to other bases. Now save the game again and quit. Next replace
the base.dat file with a the copy of the original that you made earlier.
Now when you go back to the game you'll have all the money from the sales
plus all the equipment you sold. And, if you transferred anything those
items will arrive shortly. Continue the above procedure as often as you
like.

Your will be able to use alien weapons even though you did not collect the
technology from them, however you will have to Research the alien weapons
technology. Same for UFO construction. You will have Acess to researching
all availlabe (or most) UFO ships and Alien life forms, including
researching the cyclona bust (or whatever) which will enable you to go to
mars and beat the shit out of the alien base. only an avenger can fly to
mars..and equip your players with fusion ball launchers and the most
destructive weapons availlable for mars..no stun..just kick arse!

In order for the Cheat to work..you must FIRST construct all 3 bases
on earth. Try to spread them out wisely!

Once you have done this, save your Game and use a file-editor to edit the
file.

change all the values to FF ex:

ffffffff ffffffff ffffffff ffffffff
ffffffff etc...

078 to 0F8 (Full Weapon for Base 1)
0F9 to 135 (Full Weapon for Base 2)
136 to 172 (Full Weapon for Base 3)
248 to 257 (Get all Jets and game Solution ??)
2E0 to 2F3 (Collect all alien life forms ?)

314 to 317
The Value for money must be set to 3B9AC9F8 for 999,999,999 dollars US.

The awesome thing about this hack is that you also get to research and build
all the advances buildings such as psionic lab and fusion ball befences
etc.. early in the game!!

Also..after changing all the weapon values,
you only need to manifacture one of each item, and your inventory will
indicate yu have 255 or 226 of these items! (Although some items may be in
the research window..they might already be availlable i.e.:Flying suits!)

Best of all..you get a shit load of elyrium !!!!!!!!

One draw back is that I was not able to find out the location for the
UFO power source and UFO Navigation. Once you get these from a mission, I am
not sure if these items will go to 256 (items) or you might have to re-edit
the save game file to update/refresh your FF's.

Weapon storage buildings are not neccessary when using the cheat..although
it might help to build 2 or 3 of them.

One problem is the fact that your bases will have 255 scientists and 255
technitians (or whatever, can't remember their title). so you will not
be able to purchase soldiers in bases 2 and 3 until you build enough Living
space for all the 255 scientsts and other dudes and the soldiers themselves.
you can try selling Scientisis etc to make space.

A Formidable ship is the Avenger with Fusion ball launcher/Ammo!

NOTICE: When editing, be sure to have the Current sector and ending sector
at the same location, and above all..backup your save game file.

If you can`t wait for those goodies to arrive save your game and when you
return to geoscape they will arrived instantly.

Save your game and reset the machine. Load your saved game and go to the
base information screen. Click to the right of the 3 base icons and you
will find 4 more invisible icons, ignore the one with symbols as a name.
Select one of the other bases and click on ok. When the base screen comes
select transfer and your current base. Select the goodies you want and
voaila in six hours will be your.

The candle of Love can be found in the township of Cove. You can find
the altar rooms in level 8 by peering at a gem and searching each room.
The secret passage can be found in the chamber of ANKH.

STUFF ON GATE PHASES:
Phase	Virtue		Town		Stone	Mantre	Party Member

1	Honesty 	Moonglow	Blue	Ahm	Marian

This is from the gate spell, I'm not sure exactly how the moon gates work.
Only that they do. One last thing on the moongates. If you goto the moonglow
gate and stand on the gate, when the two moons go dark, search and you will
find the black stone.

There Are Four Energy Barriers: (S)leep, (P)oison, (F)ire, And (L)ightning
Lightning is impassable, the others cast those spells upon the member
entering)
You will be prompted for which one you want. In casting or dispelling a
energy barrier you must stand next to the spot you want to cast it.

Jinx spell will cause a random number of the enemy to fight amongst them
selves.. seems to work best on gremlins.

Kill spell wont kill twisters or reapers on the first shot. Sometimes other
monsters can avoid the kill spell but these are the ones that do it
everytime. Tremor is great for a mass kill, it effects all types of enemies!

Quick gives random quickness each turn, mages seem to benefit most from
this spell.

Some lists state that you need more then one item to make the spell like:
Quick needs two bloodmoss to work.. this is all untrue in every case!

The moon gates work like this. When the gate appears it stays for two phases
of the moon on the first phase it will move you to that number gate - 1 (in
the case of if you are at moonglow, it will take you to gate 8 (magincia)).

On the second phase it will take you to the gate number + one. (if your in
magincia, you'll goto moonglow).

1 Get the character ref. sheet and the two other doc files that go with
  the game. Read them!
2 Setting up your character. Nice guys will have an easier time. In other
  words, the game keeps track of how nice a guy you are. So, when
  answering the set-up questions, keep kindness & honor in mind.
3 Friends: There are people along the way who will join your party. I soon
  got tired of talking to ever damn person. Here are the names to look for
  and in what town you may find them. They may not choose to join your
  party, but that's up to them.
	Iolo		Britan
	Jaana		Yew
	Julia		Minoc
	Shamino 	Skara brae
	Geoffiex	Jhelom
	Catherine
	Dupre
  Usually they will be standing with three other people around a fire or
  something. You will need all the friends you can get.
4 Dungeons: wrong, shame, deceit, etc.
  Secret entrance to 8th level of dungeons is found behind LB's castle.
  -> A trick I use is going down to the eighth level through LB castle and
  finding a crystal ball to raise me. Then I get killed and brought back
  by LB. I lose my money, but everyone is fully healed and I keep the
  experience & raised stats.
  -> Another sly move if a member of your party is dead, is to do this:
  1 get $300 for treasure room in LB's castle (if poisoned sleep at seer).
  2 get person reincarnated at health.
  3 have HPS restored by LB.
  4 Or just go to lord british and ask of his health.
    He will ask of yours. Say that you are not fine (no). He will return
    all characters to full health (and I think raise the dead)
  -> It seems to me that you have to win a battle with a water monster
  before a pirate ship will come by. Try if it works. Ships are fun.
5 Towns: Here is a partial listing of towns:
	Paws
	Britan
	Trinsic
	Yew
	Abby
	Minoc
	Virtue
	Magincia
	Lycaeum
  Special towns:
	Skar brae	sells herbs used for spells!
	Virtue		sells torches, gems, and keys!
	Paws		sells horses ($100 * members of party.)
6 Shrines: I have not found it particularly useful to meditate at shrines
  as a regular past-time.
  When you visit the seer ask him of the virtues. If you are successfully
  proficient in one he will tell you to go to it's shrine and meditate for
  three cycles.
  Do this and you will achieve this portion of your avatarhood. As you
  complete these philosophical (?) achievements a anhk will form in the top
  line of your stats.
  If you do an evil thing, like attacking towne guards you will loose all
  but one of your portions. (You will have to attack guards at least once.)
  Runes: (same as Shrines)
	Honor		Trinsic
	Sacrifice (CAH) Minoc		Forge
	Love		Abbey
	Justice (BEH)	Yew		Jailcell
	Compassion (MU) Britan		End hallaway
	Truth		Lycaeum

	Humility	Paws		Nook in MTNS (soeast)
	Spirit		LBC		Treasure room (ne corner)
	Honesty (AHM)	Moonglow	Mariah's chest

  The bell of courage is found in the middle of the ocean (a water island).

7 Secret doors: Secret doors (and you will be very surprised to see how
  many there are!) are easily spotted by a little dot (hi-res) in between
  the brickwork in a wall. Simply walk through the wall with the dot. There
  are several secret doors in LB's castle and in the towns.
  (LB: guard's room, above healing, prison cell, ...)
8 Adventure tips:
a Money:
  Getting money fast may help you get some good armour and better your
  initial chances for survival. An easy way of getting about $500 is by
  opening all the chests found in the secret room (guards room) in LB's
  castle.

  Spend money carefully, but don't carry it around. You will lose it if you
  die. But you're able to keep your weapon & armour (so invest the $). You
  can also keep magical ingredients and spells when resurrected, this is a
  very wise investment and stocks of ingredients and spells should be
  topped up regularly.

  Selling things back to the dealers is a bad idea as they buy it back for
  1/2 price.

  Be careful when fighting thieves, rogues, or pirates as they will steal
  your money.

b Poison:
  Poison is the most common reason for death. Learn what marshland looks
  like and avoid it! Remember that you can heal yourself by (h)ole up and
  camp. To cure (spell C) poison, mix B & C (you have about two cures to
  start out with). Another way to cure poison is to also get sleeped by a
  trap or magic floor (seer in LB castle). Or you can always pay $100 at a
  town healer.

  Avoid spiders in dungeons as they will poison you. Lets not forget the
  rats and snakes (snakes can throw their poison!)

  Be wary of traps in dungeons (fight mode) - you can step somewhere and a
  wall might open up or fire may spring up, or a bridge might disappear.

Visit towns:

While in the towns talk to everyone. After a bit you will develop a neat
knack for spotting the main words in what they say so you can get
everything out of them with little trouble.
1 find people to join your party.
2 ask people about the runes (usually a rune to each town).
3 ask people about the mantras (shrines are useless without them).

Assorted Tips:

Don't risk being sunk by pirate ships. Sail up and kill crew.
Use horsepower as much as possible (esp. after you've been playing awhile).
 This is because the game remembers every time you flee from battle. This
 way you can outrun the enemy before you have to fight them.
If you can't walk through a space (magic square) then dispell the magic!
You can hole-up and camp while in the ocean by just exiting and H. then B.
 NOTE: If you're ambushed and win the battle, you have to get the chest
 before you can reboard.
Give blood while at the healers as this makes you a nice guy.
Give money to beggars as this will too. (Can also lead to getting info.)
Don't "appropriate" chests that aren't yours (sigh) as it will count
 against you.
When buying spices you can pay only $1 for them, but that too makes you
 look bad (rotten isn't it?).
Be sure to go down a whirlpool if you get the chance. This is about the
 only way you can get a boat into the sea in the middle of the continent.
 (and the only way you can get to the city of cove.)
To get a sextant choose option D at the thieves guild ($900).
Horses are $100 each (# members).
Sometimes (maybe my imagination) but you don't see the secret doors (dots)
 the first time. A peer into a gem or just re-entering the room may clear
 this up.
The moons will change by themselves (not any relation to commands), so if
 you're waiting on a moondoor, don't just sit there and hit space + rept.
 This will advance your # of moves and also give monsters a chance to be
 born and find you.
If a member of the party is poisoned, one way of fixing him is to let
 him open all the chest you find. This way he will have a better chance
 of getting slept (thus curing the poison).
 Another natty way, and surer is to cast the cure spell at him.
The Bucc's Den weapon shop sells magic bows & wands. ($2000 and $5000
 respectively)
Tornados seem to only move you a couple of places + hurt you.

STONES: Stones are found in the dungeons (various levels). You seem to
have to have the rune first before you can get the stone. They are on
altars (peer). You will need to get them!

@node "Ultima 5"
@remark HS
You can fight for money but don't steal food. It can be bought in Moon-
glow. Look in the chambers of Lord British for the magic carpet. The
cities and shrines are almost the same as Ultima 4. You can find people
in every town who know the passwords to the dungeons. You will need to
get an item from Empath Abbey to climb the mountains before completing
the game.

Starting Off

When first starting the game you will find yourself in a hut in the
middle of a thick forest in the NW of Britannia. Before you leave this
hut have a good look around, not only inside but outside. Find the horse
and talk to him. You should save your game before you venture out into
the wilderness this will save you having to go through the stuff at the
start again if you happen to get killed. I recommend that the first
place you visit is the Castle of Lord British. Getting there should be
simple since now you know where you are. Just make your way East to the
Dragon Spine Mountains and then follow them south until you find the way
through. This appears on your map as an plain brown area. Save your
game along the way incase you run into some monsters and get killed.

Exploring and Mapping

Again in this type of game accurate map making is very important, map
everything, Towns, keeps, lighthouses and especially dungeons. Mark in
all doors, secret doors, traps and ways up or down. And label things
like Inns, taverns, Guilds, Apothecaries, pubs, shipwrights etc. Some
times it will be necessary to visit one place more than once so if a
certain person tells you to get a piece of information from somewhere
else then make note of where he or she was so you don't have to go
searching again when you return. Once you have found a Sextant (and
there is one to be found) make a list of all the localities and their
grid references, it will help. You will notice that there are a lot of
inscriptions or runes around the map. Make an effort to translate all
of them into English, you will need to know where some key locations are
later in the game.

Finding Your Party

Unlike other Role Playing Games in Ultima you must find your party and
not create it. Since Ultima IV (Quest Of The Avatar) the rest of your
party have gone on to live there own lives and do other things, you will
come across them in your travels and you should allow them to join you
once again. If you are new to Ultima you of course won't know who I am
talking about, when you come across them they will recognise you. But I
will give you a list of all of them and where to find them,

	Jana	Secret passage under the town of Yew
	Mariah	The Lycaeum
	Katrina New Magincia
	Gefory	Buccaneer's Den
	Dupre	Bordermarch Keep

You may only have six characters in your party at any one time so you
must choose who you will have.

Dungeons

Some of the dungeons you will delve into are very intricate, accurate
mapping is a must. I don't find it necessary to map dungeon rooms, I
just represent them as a square with an `R' in it. If the room contains
a way up or down I just put a little up or down arrow in the square.
Some rooms will have secret panels that you must push or walk over in
order to open up other parts of the room. Sometimes you may have to
throw something like an axe in order to activate a panel, or open a door.
It's a good idea that when you have defeated all the monsters in the
room to walk around a bit and push things in order to see if there are
any secret passages. A good guideline to follow is that if the word
"Victory" doesn't appear when you have killed all the beasties there is
something more to do.

Combat

Get into as much combat as you can. The more experience points you have
the more levels you will gain, and the stronger you will become. What's
different about the combat system used here is that the character who
kills the monster gets the experience points, instead of everybody
getting there share. So try and give everybody there share of kills, so
you won't have some characters falling behind in levels. Having a mage
that can cast spells from the 8th circle is a must, spells like Cone Of
Energy really come in handy in the latter stages of the game. Although
getting to the 8th Circle takes a long time. Don't keep weapons that are
of no use, sell what you don't want.

The Underworld

The Underworld is a big place and you must go there a few times in order
to recover certain artefacts. I always used a different save disc when I
visited the Underworld, it's a very hard place to map and you will get a
lot of combat practice. Getting lost is very easy to accomplish, so take
plenty of magic gems with you. You will also notice that there isn't
much light in the Underworld so make sure that you have plenty of torches
and enough of the appropriate reagents to mix a lot of Vas Lor (Great
light) spells.

@remark CH
For those of you that haven't found the magic method of travel in Ultima 6,
holding <ALT> <2> <1> <4> will bring up a prompt (in Gargoylian) for three
coordinates - these three hex numbers will bring you to any location in
Britannia, the dungeons or the Gargoyle world. This is apparently the
programmers method of travel and is faster than a fan powered Balloon!

The three numbers are basicly the x,y & z coordinates for the map, with
0,0,0 located at the upper left corner on Level 0 (Britannia). For this
discussion, I will use the form x,y,l to describe this coordinate system.
The first two numbers (x & y) increase by 1 for each move in the horizontal
or vertical direction. The x coordinates begin at the left edge and the y
coordinates begin at the top. The third coordinate (l) represents the
level; Britannia is Level 0, the dungeons are levels 1 thru 4 and the
Gargoyle world is Level 5.

<ALT> <2> <1> <4> is entered on the numeric keypad. Each coordinate
is entered separately, ie, press <RETURN> after each one.

<ALT> <2> <1> <3> this gives the Gargoyle coordinate for your present
position plus a free view of the map - forget all those gems and peer
spells! It returns a 13 digit number, the last 7 of which are the
coordinates. The first 6 are related to the total number of moves you have
made. For the example above, the number would look something like:
79000029D0430 or 790000 moves and coordinate 29D,043,0.

BEWARE: You can land in a real 'snake pit' with some of these locations.
Always be prepared for the worst when teleporting to a strange location.

To get past the ghostly lady, go towards the hall from the stairs, enter
the storage closet and take the No-Ghost bottle. Open the bottle and
go back to the hall. Operate the bottle on the lady. To get past the
dogs, say "INSTANTUM ILLUMINARIS ABRAXAS" to them. You will find a key
if you operate the knife on the left chair in the lounge. This key is
used to open the cabinet in the master bedroom. In the cathedral, say
"SPECAN HEAFOD ABRAXAS" to the plaster head.

Hints:
* Reading other people's mail isn't polite, but it could save your life.
* Check the upstairs closet for something to take care of Miss O'Hara. But be
  sure to open it before you use it.
* The nightstand in the upstairs bedroom has a hollow ring to it.
* The lamp in the servants room does it's job without electricity.
* The servant won't let you read his diary, but if you could get him out of the
  way...
* Spray the Spider Cider on the railing on the veranda and leave the porch.
  Come back later and the spider will be caught. Show the spider to the servant
  to scare him away.
* Read the book in the master bedroom.
* The key in the chair opens many things.
* Some dogs are afraid of lightning (Instantum Illuminaris Abraxas).
* Talking heads need conversation once in a while, so brush up on your Latin
  (Specan Heafod Abraxas).
* A cross will some in handy later on but the secret trap door under the altar
  is not the way to go.
* The candelabra will protect you on your way to the maze. (Remember to light
  it).
* The amulet can take care of only one Zombie at a time so if you run up
  against a buch of them, RUN.
* There is one grave here that is different from the others and you have only
  one bunch of flowers.
* The key from the chair will open the cages.
* Cage the bird and the snake and the cat will take care of each other.
* The boiuncing creature would just love a bird to play with. If you find the
  creature it will leave the gem behind.
* Put the gem in the gemshaped hole in the magisterium doorway.
* The guardian demon could probably use some fruit. Water the one plant in the
  greenhouse that is not dead and it will grow soon.
* "Gold, silver and mercury - together they form a key." Look in the study desk
  drawer and find the atomic numbers of these three elements. This is the
  combination to the safe.
* Hack the cookie jar with the axe and leave the cookie in the house. The
  little guy will exchange the key for the cookie.
* Light a fire in the entrance hall fireplace and throw the hingeless box in
  the fire. The star will burn the ice under the door in the lab.
* The spider kills. Avoid it.
* Operate then star from the hingeless box on the ice and follow the evil
  genius.
* Throw the evil genius down the bottomless pit before he wakes up. The key you
  got from the little guy unlocks the door to the house.
* Your brother's screams are coming from above the upstairs bathroom with the
  odd light fixture. Wait until the water almost fills the room and open the
  fixture.
* Your brother seems delirious. Smack some sence into him.
* A simple wooden cross will take care of the demon.
* Follow your brother out the window.
* Have you tried...
  Getting in the coffin in the maze?
  Not caging one of the animals?
  Entering the cage in the attic?
  Eating the fruit from then plant in the greenhouse?
  Drinking the mercury?

The game starts with the dead of your master and you are to perform
a task about which you will find out later. Now you're in a hut.
There's an oil lamp here. It might come in handy when you're in the

will drop out. Read it. You'll find "the word for the lake". Think
you're done here. No! the old geezer has more. You'll find an iron
key. (Always handy to have keys) and a postcard. The postcard is no
yoke. It has an uncancelled stamp you'll need later, but for now
you can't get it of so pocket the postcard. Now we can go out.
north that is. We'll arrive at the forest. Nothing interesting here,
so go further north. We'll see more forest. Ever climbed the trees
when you were young? practice! You'll find an egg and a feather
both of which you'll need later. Continue west and arrive at the
cliff top. Oh let's go south for a moment and try the "word for the
lake". The rod can produce a rainbow like in any good old adventure
game. For now it's empty, it needs a recharge. So pocket it and
go north, and follow the cliff northeast. There's a lighthouse we'll
search through. At the bottom floor there's a cheez key. Leave it.
Examine the machine instead. The machine itself is of no use, but
there's a bronze plate somewhere we'll need. Look also under the
machine. There's a scroll with the formula for gold. Memorize the
formulat but don't take the scroll. We've already got enough to carry.
Now go up. There's a lighthouse lamp with a secret container in the
brick foot. Pull the loose brick and a pair of oven gloves will
drop out. Take'm. go down, sw, and east. We're back at more forest
Now go northeast. You're outside the cheez pig in. Go in. You're ..
The bar patrons are of no interest. (Though it's possible to have
them killed later on) Look behind the bar. There's a counterfeit
coin and a health notice. The coin is necessary, the health notice
can be dropped. While we're here go ne to the back room. The bucket
VB>> you find there is needed later so take it. Loaded with
loot we'll find our way back to the forest, and go ne from there.
We'll arrive at the peacefull glade. There's an iron grating there
that's locked. Which key will fit? Right. Open the grate drop the key and go
down (don't forget the lamp!).
Here there's some inscription on the wall which reveals
the goal of the game, finally. Now that we now that we might
start exploring the caves. First go south. The mountain king
who used to dine here forgot to eat some meat. Don't eat it yourself
we need it to kill something. Let's do that first. We'll go north
and north to the branching tunnel and then go west. There's a monster
in the natural cave. Give it the meat it will choke on it. Are we done?
No! the monster has some loot. Now we'll go east and northeast and then
to the side cave. Under the rubble you'll find a sword which can
provide light. Why take it? We have the lamp. Yes but the lamp
may not last forever. Go back to the fork. There's a path south
and we might as well take a look in the pillar cave. What's on
top of it? Alas it's not the orb of studiosity. It's your job
to bring the real orb there. We find our way back to the hall
of the mountain king. Let's first go west and read for a while
about the great beaver. Now this is not a fake story, so
remember the essentials. Go back to the hall of the mountain king.
South of here is the kings treasure room which is garded by a
mean droll. The droll is strong but his eyesight is poor so we
can fool him. Wear the collar you took from the beast, and
walk south. The troll will not interfere (now) with our opening
the chest. Find a sceptre and a piece of animal skin. They are
both needed, but the sceptre is not needed until the very last
moves of the game so if the load gets too heavy we might leave it
in the hall of the valley king. You can also drop the collar there.
North and se is the way to go to arrive at the curving
hallway. There's a guardian of the king suspended in the air.
Examine it. It tracks it's pray by heat. You cannot escape it
unless you can divert it to another heat source. Got it. Yes.
So first try to walk south. The guardian will stop you. Now
go back northwest. The guardian will follow you. Drop the lamp.
The guardian will kill it (and itself) and the way is clear.
Your load is now light enough to pick up the sceptre again.
We can go se again and south, west, and west, and arrive at
the entrance to unnkulia. If we go west we'll find a chasm.
(Try the rod for fun).
We cannot cross it (yet) but we can
climb down and down again to arrive at a particular hot spot.
Save the game. The number of moves in hot spots is very limited
and you might have to try again. Wear the gloves first.
Put the egg on the hot spot. Try holding the
postcard in the steam. Take the stamp. Take the fried egg.
Go up again, and up again, east and south. We're at the other
shore of the lake. First go west, and up the steep path to
arrive at the clearing. There's a mailbox here with an order form.
One of the items on the order form we'll need later, so lick
the stamp, put it on the order form, put the form in the mailbox
and close the mailbox. Now we direct our attention to the hut.
Enter and take the loaf of bread. It's nutrition we'll need
later on. (The fried egg is for someone else). The silver key
cannot (yet) be obtained so leave it there. Go back to the shore
and follow the sw path up to the monastry. The old monk you'll
find inside is particularly fond of eggs (ask him about it)
When you give him the egg he'll grant your wish to visit the
temple. Leave the gloves here we don't need them any more.
Inside the temple there's an altar with a hole in it.
Put something in? No get something out! First put the bronze
plate on the altar and then examine. When the stone shoots out,
a disc will come loose from the plate, and it's better counterfeit
than the other coin. Take it and leave. Outside we'll follow the
path once more up the trail. The giant boulder does not only provide
a view, but can also be tipped over the edge to destroy either the
monastry or the hut. Choose the hut (remember the key). Now we
go down and find our way back to the clearing. Has the mail arrived
yet? If it has take the jade elephant. From the cottage ruins we
obtain the silver key. Now we're all done here so we find our
way back to the chasm. Go down again and down again and enter
the rocks through the tunnnel northeast. Through the other exit
we arrive in the maze. Sort the maze out for yourself. Go up
and down often to arrive at the tiny cave. Here we find the machine that will
recharge our wand. Follow the instructions, but for money use the
disc from the bronze plate (it will not accept the Acmid).
Be carefull to go sw a lot to fin your way back to the fissure and the
chasm. Other exits lead into the maze which has nothing of interest. At
the top of the chasm we can wave the rod and grow a rainbow.
Before we cross it we go back to the entrance to
recover the axe there. The axe cannot be brought to the
west side of the chasm (try it) but we can fool the guards.
VB>> Throw the axe from the rainbow bridge at the tunnel mouth you see
VB>> in the western wall of the chasm below. It will land an a ledge in
VB>> front of the tunnel mouth; then we can cross the bridge to
the west side of the chasm. Down the south end of the hallway
we'll find an enourmous door to which a tiny silver key fits and
we enter the alchemists alcove. drop the key.
Here the formula for gold might come
in handy. Alas there are no bird's gizzards. At the north end of
the hallway we'll find enourmous giant foots. Try to tickle them.
Drop the feather. Wait there's a hole in the ground. Down and south
we'll find the birds gizzards. We'll make gold later. (or do we?)
and south we're in the salesmans office. The salesman is very cross with you
for fooling the machine. Offer him payment. He'll be happy and leave
loosing a...credit card! Take the credit card north and ne.
VB>> Did you examine the bucket and notice that it's rim is rather
VB>> sticky? Now put the animal skin on the bucket, and behold: we have
VB>> a drum! Why not play it a bit? This reveals a hidden passage and
VB>> behind it (se): lo, our axe! Get the axe and go nw and north.
Now here's a lock we can pick
(with the credit card) Enter the east gate and find a...giant mouse.
Don't try to pat the mouse, it kills you. Instead show the image of
its old nemesis and it will flee like hell. In the mouses nesting
there's a cubic object we'll need. Take it and leave. It's time
to make gold (or is it?) and we'll find our way back to the alchemists
alcove. Remember how to make the gold powder? Make it! But do not
poor it on the lead. Gold is fine but with gold we'll never reach
the gold. Go sw to the alchemists bedroom and find the formula for
the black powder. Now we'll make that instead (the iron ore is in
the read vial). Take the black powder and the plant pieces (remember
the library?) an go back to the square chamber. There's an enourmous
yellow door here. What is it made of? Of course. Cheez. It's eddible
(well almost) Eat it and be brave. You'll spill the contents of
your stomach and go hungry but that's why we bring the bread.
At the other end of the hall of the deamons we'll go north and
find a room of light. The light is deadly but is brought forth
by a crystal in the western wall. Put the black powder in the
hole and kill the crystall. Now go south and south and arrive
in the dungen. There are several objects of interest here, but
the one needed for the game is the chopping block. Chop!
Some pieces of cedar wood will fall off. Take them. Remember
the library? Now it's time to find the beaver. Eat the plant pieces
and arrive in a strange dream. The beaver loves the cedar chips and
rewards you with a knob. Wander around you will invariably end up
west of chasm. Find your way back to the square room and go north.
There's no light to prevent you to enter the vault of unnkulia north.
Now this vault has a strange podium. It needs power first so look
behind it and plug it. You cannot turn the stem on top of it. But
we have a knob to put on the stem, and we can turn the knob. Now
put the cube in the hole and push the button. Bingo the vault
will open. Inside we just have to balance the scales. Which object
was heavy? Oh yeah, the sceptre. Now that the scales are balanced
we can take the orb and run back to the pillar cave. Oh no the
unnkulian warrior drops from the ceiling. Shal we fight? Not a
chance. Just stay kuul and walk back to the pillar cave. The
warrior will follow you but not hurt you. When you take off the
basket ball and put the orb in its rightful place the powers that
be will take care of the warrior.

Level 1

In the room where you begin the level notice the Wizard, look at him and he
speaks to you. Take the book and the piece of paper with "I am infinity"
written on it. Operate the floor tile in the bottom right hand corner of
the room, take the potion of faith. Notice the passageway is the only exit
out of this room, the Wizard blocks the exit out of the level, your task
for this level is to destroy the Wizard so you can progress into level 2.
The passageway is filled with hot coals, if you stand on them your stamina
begins to drop, drink the potion of faith and travel down the passageway.
There are quite a few rooms open to you but the one you need is infinity's
own bedroom, this is the one with the racing track in it. Operate the floor
tile in this room and take the potion of strength. Neardy is the oracle,
look at him and he asks you to bring him luck. Take the left hand exit out
of this room into the Carpenters workshop, take the chest key then pull the
lever to gain access to a large rock that stops you from reaching a four
leaf clover. Drink the strength potion, remove the rock and pick up the
clover. Put the clover on the oracle and he opens the door into the maids
bedroom, at the same time he asks you for a sign. In the maids room operate
the floor tile near the suitcase to find a playing card, another floor tile
in this room reveals a compass. Take the door key from beside the bed. Back
in the Carpenters workshop put the playing card on the Gambler's tomb, take
his snail. Put the compass on the map near to where you foung the clover
and take St. Christopher. Travel back to infinity's bedroom and put the
snail on the race track, two other snails appear and they all have a race.
George's snail losses every time and you gain nothing. Hunt around till you
find some vaseline on the floor and put the snail on top of it. George's
snail is transformed into a racing snail. Put it back on the track, this
time it's a dead heat and the two caskets open. Take a rusty object and the
diary that contains strange ramblings that don't make alot of sense. Put
the rusty object on the sanding machine in the carpenter's workshop and
take the door key. Put the diary on the madman's tomb in the kitchen and
take the confusion spell. The first key you found opens the locked door
near to the vaseline. Inside is an altar with nothing on it, each time you
walk towards it a pearl appears, each time you get close enough to take it,
it disappears again. Take the picture out of this room. Nearby is the
maid's room, put the St. Christopher on the suitcase and take the safe
travel potion. In the kitchen notice the duplication stones, the book
nearby warns you of the passegeway beyond the locked door, put the safe
travel potion on the duplication stone, take both potions. Open the door
with the silver key and travel down to the electrical device. Drink the
safe travel potion and pass through unharmed. Pick up the sugar, the potion
of lies and the door key to get back out. Pick up the note from the Goblin
informing you that if you give him a gift for a king he will disarm the
passegway. The Goblin sits on his sofa. Travel back the way you came before
your potion runs out . Each time you look at the Carpenter he tells you he
has a gift for the king. Put the confusion spell in front of him and in his
confused state he asks who you are. Stand and face him, drink the potion of
lies then look at the piece of paper in your rucksack that says "I am
Infinity". Lying through your teeth you tell him that you are the King and
in his confused state he hands over a jewelled box, a gift for a king.
Drink the second safe travel potion and travel back down to the Goblin,
give him the box, he disarms the passegeway and opens the door into the
Wizards room. Operate the floor tile and take infinity's teddy bear, read
the spell book that tells how to destroy the Wizard. Travel through the
door opened by a lever noticing three tombs as you pass, open another door
with a lever that provides you with a shortcut back to the kitchen. Take
the section of pipe, take the snooker chalk and put it on the tomb of the
hustler. Take the snooker cue in the wall behind the pearl that keeps
disappearing, notice a small hole, insert the snooker cue in here and the
pearl is knocked to the floor allowing you to pick it up. This is for the
spell. By now you will have found the objects you need to make a cake. Put
the cake tin on the stove in the kitchen, then drop inside the egg the
flour and the sugar, take the cake for use later on. Put Infinity's teddy
bear on his bed and take the sleeping pills. Put these on the tomb of the
insomniac near to the Wizards room. Take the nightmare spell and put this
in front of the cook who up until now has told you to leave her alone
because she's sleeping. Put the cake in front of her and she ices it for
you. In the Carpenter's workshop put the picture onto the saw, take the
piece of jigsaw that fits into the incomplete puzzle nearby. The chests
open allowing you to take a heavy bell and a door key. Put the piece of
pipe next to the glass in the Carpenter's workshop, travel to the other end
of the pipe that it fits onto, then put the heavy ball onto it.The ball
rolls down the length of pipe and smashes the glass that was hiding a
potion of faith. Save this for use later. Take the iced birthday cake and
give it to the maid who has been telling you it's her birthday and now
informs you she was only joking. She gives you a sapphire for your trouble,
the book of birthstones will inform you that it is the birthstone of Libra,
put the Sapphire in the scales near to the vaseline, take the sign of Libra
and give it to the Oracle who gives you a vase. The key from the jigsaw
chest opens the door into a room where there is an identical vase on one
side of a locked door, place your vase opposite and the door opens, before
you walk inside it would be a good idea to save your game as this is the
maze. Pull the lever to open a door eleswhere then travel past the
electrical device, once you have done so your potion timer goes up and
begins to descend informing you how long you have before the door into the
maze locks itself, the book at the entrance to the maze explains all about
it. Somewhere inside here is a chest for which you have the key and inside
the chest is the Wizards staff which you need for your spell. The lever in
the maze opened the door below the Carpenters workshop and inside is an old
man who tells you he is hungry. Notice also the potters wheel on which you
place the clay that you would of found by now. Operate the button on the
potters wheel and take the soggy clay bowl. Put this on the kiln in the
Wizards room and take the fired bowl. Fill this with stew from the kitchen
and deliver it to the old man, he rewards you with a coin for the piggy
bank in the maid's room, take the fan and the sword from inside the chests.
Back in the Wizard's room put the fan on the left hand altar that prevents
you reaching the love letter, the fan blows the letter off it's perch so
you can take it. Put the sword on the tomb of the duelist nearby and take
the jewels, put these on the tomb of the jeweller and take the pound note.
You now have all the ingredients for your spell. The pearl, the love
letter, the pound note and the Wizard's staff, put all of these objects
into the Wizard's cauldron and take the banish spell, travel back to the
passegeway of hot coals, drink the potion of faith and travel down it,
place the banish spell in front of the Wizard who disappears into the floor
leaving the way clear.

Level 2

Pick up the tankard, operate the floor tile and take the chest key. Travel
south and pick up a second tankard then take your first left and head into
the room where four hungry and thirsty soldiers are sitting. Take the third
tankard and operate the floor tile, underneath is some stamina. If you look
at the soldier on your left he will demand that you supply him and his
three buddies with some ale. Travel out of the room and head south again,
pull the lever and enter the room where the ale is. Take the tankard off
the stool and fill all four tankards with the soldiers favourite brew.
Before you leave open the chest with your key and take the piece of paper
with the cryptic phrase on it and operate the floor tile, underneath is a
door key. Deliver the ale to the soldiers who empty the tankards and open a
door as a reward for your efforts. Look at the most talkative soldier and
he will demand that you bring them food. Travel out of the room and
straight down into the door they have opened. Inside take a stick and two
chicken legs, deliver these two chicken legs to two of the soldiers as you
will need the room, then travel back to the ale room where it would be a
good idea to leave the tankards. In here you can pull a lever for a
shortcut into a room where a soldier is sat in between two chests. He asks
you for the password. Insert the stick in the hole in the wall then pull
the lever. Travel up and round the u-bend operating all the floor tiles.
Take the sapphires for use later on. The white pattern on the floor tile is
a teleport square, stand on this to be transported to another section of
the map where you come across more floor tiles, operate these and take the
chicken legs, you only need two more as you have already given two to the
soldiers. Check out the room where the Norse Warlords lie. Look at their
tombs to read the cryptic inscriptions. Deliver the two remaining chicken
legs to the soldiers who reward you with a second chest key, look at the
left hand soldier once more he will demand more ale. The key is for the
chest in the Norse Warriors room, take the translation potion then head
back to the soldier who demands the password. Face him and drink the potion
then look at the cryptic piece of paper, the letters change into the words
"Herman's Home", having said this the two chests open and you can take the
protection potion and a cross. Travel up to the locked door near where you
found the second tankard, open the door with the key from the ale room and
take the bone off the stool. Travel south once more to where the green
river of poison breaks. Notice a small piece of poison lying on the floor,
you loose stamina if you try to take it so drink the protection potion. Put
this in the ale and then fill up the tankards once more, it is time to rid
yourself of the demandind soldiers. Deliver the poisonous ale which they
dispose of in one gulp, they are now quietened for ever. This action results
in the locked door of this room opening. Travel up the passageway then take
a left onto a teleport square. You find yourself in a room with a series of
altars with blue diamonds engraved on them. Drop the sapphires you are
carrying which will rid you of three of the altars and also allow you to
pick up a will and a chain. Teleport back the way you came and walk
straight onto the second teleport square. Pick up the 'No' from the altar
then travel down into the torture chanber. One of the soldiers is hoarding
a clock but he allows you to take it. You now have all four objects to give
to the Norse Warlords back in their private chamber. Before you leave
search till you find the altar with the combination written on it, take the
piece of paper that says what's' the combination' off here. The Norse
Warlords reward you with a chess piece each which you will know the
relevance of if you have peeked into the chess board room near to the
torture chamber. Travel to the chess board room and position your Rook and
your Bishop in order to checkmate the King. The Rook goes on the square
by the door on the same line of tiles as the King chess piece. The Bishop
chess piece goes on the square near to the bottom of your screen with the
King chess piece in a diagonal line but not on the diagonal lines of the
other Bishops. When your two pieces have been positioned. The King chess
piece disappears to give you access to a cigar, anothe sapphire and a
teleport square. This transports you to a room where you find a "Bee tray"
and the front page of a newspaper. Return to the room where the sapphire
altars are and drop your new sapphire, this allows you to take a piece of
paper with the words "let him have it" written on it. Back in the torture
chamber you can now order the awake soldier to "let him have it", this
results in the poor prisoner being stretched beyond all recognition. He
instantly dies and the soldier accuses you of killing him, then he informs
you he is going to tell. Take the key that has appeared on the prisoner and
travel back to the throne room of the sapphire altars. You will have
noticed a bottle of stamina over the river. Take this as you will need it,
then set off south walking in the poison itself, stop and drink the stamina
when yours ticks down too far. At the end of the river is a door which you
can unlock. There is a joke here which you can take, then take a shortcut
back to the torture room via a door opened by a lever and a teleport
square. Back in the torture room the King has appeared. Look at him and he
asks if you killed him, look at your "No" piece of paper to deny the whole
thing and ignore the jeering soldiers. The King asks you to prove it at
which point you can produce your newspaper which describes your whereabouts
the day before, he laughs and asks you to prove it. Take the stick from the
prisoner and travel back to the room where you found the joke via the
shortcut. Insert the stick in the hole, pull the lever and enter the
photocopying room. Pick up today's newspaper which has not yet been
printed, then put yesterdays newspaper on the photocopier. This disappears
which is your cue to drop today's unwritten newspaper onto the photocopier.
Take your evidence and go back to face the King. Drop your newspaper on the
floor and the King disappears leaving behind his crown, tell the second
soldier to let his prisoner have it who screams and when asked "what's the
combination" replies "I will betray". Travel back to the photocopying room
and head south till you reach a crown by a locked door. Drop the crown and
enter the room where you will find an eye at the end of a small river. In
this room you will also find another sapphire and an orange. Put the eye,
the will and the 'Bee tray' on the combination stone in that order to open
the door into a new part of the level. Before you leave take the shoes from
the torture room. Stand on the teleport square just beyond the now open
door to discover a door key. Return straight away and progress into unknown
territory where you will find a corresponding locked door. Inside this room
you will find Herman. Herman tells you he's bored so look at the piece of
paper that says 'let him have it'. Herman asks you who but you can't answer
him yet. Operate the floor tile and take the musical note then travel back
to the tuning fork which is near the photocopier (left out of Herman's
room). Take the musical sharp then deposit this and the cigar on the Norse
Warlord tomb of Hamlet Sharp in the same room as Herman. You recieve a
stick in return which you can use on the hole just outside to give you
access to another piece of paper with'crumbly wally' written on it and a
teleport square. This teleports you into a square with walls all around
you, look at the 'crumbly wally' piece of paper to get rid of the walls.
Pick up the comedian potion which is near the family album. You will notice
a teleport maze which you could get lost in forever and a room with five
star filled altars in it. The teleport square in this room transports you
to a room where you find the genesis device and a amplifier. Travel back to
the room where you found the eye and face the soldier who asks why the
chicken crossed the road. If you reply by looking at your joke without
having drunk the comedian potion first the soldier won't even smirk, so
drink the potion first to raise a hearty guffaw and gain access to the two
chests beside him. Take the map for the teleport maze and a thermometer.
Put your shoes on the Norse Warlord's tomb in the same room as the soldier
as he is called Robin Sole. You need another object for this tomb before
you are rewarded. Pick up the sapphire from beside the tomb then head back
to the teleport maze. Use your map to survive the experience then prepare
to eat the cookie monster. You will have found cookies by now so put one in
his bowl to see him slurp his way across the room, devour the cookie and
return to his place by the door he is blocking. To get past him you are
going to have to poison him by placing a cookie beneath the spout of the
same poisoned ale barrel you used to kill the soldiers then operating the
tap to take a poisoned cookie. In the same room as the cookie monster are
some rings which you can take and another locked door, opened by a lever.
This gives you access to a shortcut round the maze and Grumbleweed, the
burping cider drinker. He is still convinced he won the 'who can burp the
loudest' competition. Take the camera film and head back to the camera
which is near the photocopier. Insert the film and then operate the camera
to be provided with a picture of you which you then put on the family
album. It changes into a picture of the King which you use to tell Herman
who you want to 'let him have it'. Herman then asks for his prophecy and
provides you with a chest key for the chest in the same room. In here you
find the Book of Icarus. After poisoning the cookie monster you have access
to another teleport square and an altar with a sapphire on it. Stand on the
teleport square and you find yourself at the top of the sapphire altar
room. Get past the altar that is blocking your way by dropping a sapphire
on it, you now have access to a pear and nearby you will find a banana and
some earth. Down the left hand passageway you will find a soldier who
informs you it will cost you. Take the arrow that's on his table. Travel
back the way you came and turn right, down a short passageway there is
another teleport square. This transports you to a small room where you will
notice a cider press. Travel back to the room where the joking soldier is
and put the arrow on the tomb of the Norse Warloed Robin Sole. He rewards
you with a potion of extreme luck. Return to the fruit machine and put your
three pieces of fruit on the rollers, operate the lever under the influence
of the potion and the three pieces of fruit turn into apples which you can
take. At the same time a pile of gold coins appears in the small room
beside the fruit machine, but a locked door prevents you from reaching
them. Put all three apples on the cider press and take the bottle of cider.
Your task now is to beat Grumbleweed in your own 'who can burp the loudest'
competition. Fill up one of the tankards in Herman's room with ale then
travel back to Grumbleweed. Give him the cider so he can produce one of his
most excellent burps then put the amplifier on the square beside him, stand
on the amplifier then drink your ale. You win the competition and
Grumbleweed hands over the flytrap plant. You now have all the objects you
need to create the planets from the genisis device. Insert the thermometer
which will provide you with the planet Mercury, the rings to give you
Saturn, the flytrap to give you Venus and the earth to give you Earth.
Place the planets in the correct order on the cosmos altars (Mercury,
Earth, Venus, Saturn) and the last altar lights up to represent the sun.
Put the Book of Icarus on here and you are rewarded with Herman's prophecy.
Dutifully deliver this to Herman and he will give you the key for the room
where the coins are lurking. Give these to the soldier who says 'It will
cost you', the last door opens and you're on your way to level three. the
Haunted Gallery.

Level 3

You start the level standing by a door, nearby is a key and the logical
thing to do is insert the key in the door. Iff you do this you will meet
the first ghost of level three who appears as you unlock the door, sails
over to a lever nearby, locks the door you've just opened, then disappears
back down it's hole. Nothing will cover this hole properly to prevent the
spectre getting out and foiling your plans. Explore the room you are in
instead and meet the mummy who won't talk to you and a vampire that wants
his well done, whatever that means. Operate three floor tiles to find some
stamina, a box of matches and a chest key, take the bag of cement and the
piece of paper that says 'please will you move'. Put one of the toy blocks
that are lying around in the toy box to meet another spectre. This one
prevents you getting in the door from which he materialises. Pull the lever
by another locked door and head into the room where you can dispose of your
cement in the cement mixer, pick up some pebbles which you can change to
sand on the grinding machine in the first room. Put the sand in the cement
mixer and travel down to the second room where you will notice the ghost
trap, a conveyor belt operated by a lever and a floor tile which you can
operate, beneath it is a stick. Beyond the trap is a slimy river which
takes away your stamina, travel down here to reach a chest that opens with
your key. Inside is a piece of guttering. On the way back don't forget to
pick up the binoculars and extra stamina. Put the guttering between the
cement mixer and the water barrel, operate the tap on the barrel, then
operate the cement mixer. Grab the cement that appears next to it then
return triumphantly to the hole in the first room which you can now plug up
for eternity. Finally you can leave this room and meet the zombie that
refuses to get out of your way even when you ask him nicely. Insert the
stick in the hole and operate the lever to gaim access to a room with a
Hoover in it. Operate the floor tile to take a piece of paper that says
'Where is M'. Take the portable ghost trap and the stick that looks
slightly different to the sticks you find to open doors with. You are now
equipped out to dispose of the playful ghost in the first room. Put the
trap down between the toy box and the door, then put a toy block in the toy
box. The ghost appears then promptly disappears into your trap. It would be
a good idea now to empty your trap in the permanent ghost trap near the
conveyor belt so you can use it again. Return to the room you have just
gained access to and speak to the vampire who tells you to find his wife.
Operate the floor tiles and take the chicken egg and a fly then return to
the first room where you can put the fly in the cobweb to take a
tempermental spider that turns into a chest key each time you put him down.
He obviously needs a stabilising treatment of some kind so put him in the
molecular stabiliser next to the mummy nearby. He changes permanently into
a chest key and the mummy informs you he's in shock. Obviously got a weak
stomach. Open the chest near to where you found the pebbles and take a
second stick. Travel back to the river of slime that crosses your path near
to the exit out of the room where you began the level. Make sure you have
plenty of stamina then set off down the right hand fork of the river. (This
is your right not Infinity's). At the end of the river insert the stick
into the hole and pull the lever, this opens the door into another room.
Inside you can drop your 'different looking ' stick onto the lathe and
fashion yourself something which resembles a stake. Pull the lever in this
room for a shortcut to avoid the slime river, then return to the
unsuspecting vampire in the room where you began the level. Drop the stake
on his coffin and take the teeth which you get in return. Put the teeth and
the box of matches on the tomb of Arson Molar in the room where the
conveyor belt is and take the angry potion. Go and face the stubborn
zombie who blocks the passageway, drink the angry potion and look at the
piece of paper that says 'Please will you move'. Being timid he disappears
at the hint of a raised voice so you can progress into a small courtyard
where yet another zombie blocks your way. There's a vampire here also who
takes your stamina each time you try and take the calendar day that's sat
on his coffin. Take the bell and the music sheet then return to the room
where the wifeless vampire lives and put the binoculars and the sheet music
on the tomb of 'Brahms Seeformiles'. Take the door key you recieve in
return. Travel back to the locked door in the small courtyard and open it
with your key. In here notice another ghost. Put the ghost trap down
between the spectre and the telephone then operate the telephone that is
nearest to the door. He obediently dashes over to answer it and in the
process disappears inside your trap. In this room you can put your 'Where
is M' piece of paper onto the book of names and take the new piece of
paper which says 'Where is Mestophiles'. Take the tape which is also in
this room and Cupid's bow. Go and face the zombie in the small courtyard
then ask him where Mestophiles is. So scared by the mention of the great
one's name he vanishes into thin air allowing you to pick up a second bell,
a piece of paper which says 'Is anybody there' and get into another room.
In here you will notice three altars with hammers attached to them and a
mummy who says 'play me a tune'. If you put the two bells on the altars
then operate the lever the hammers will tap out a tune on the bells, as you
are missing one, nothing will happen yet. Pick up the Santa hat and operate
the lever allowing you access to a strange room where the two objects
inside it constantly evade your grasp. From here you can reach another room
where another ghost lurks near a televison, take the tennis racket nearby.
Return to the room where the cement mixer is and put chicken egg in the
nest, the chicken wanders over and sits down. Put the tape in the tape
recorder and operate it, the sound of the barking dog alarms the chicken
who makes a sharp exit, leaving behind dome of it's feathers. Put these
beneath the conveyor belt so when you pull the lever, the object that sails
along it doesn't smash on the floor but lands safely on the feathers. The
object is an upturned glass. Travel to the room where you may have noticed
a ouija board, put the upturned glass on the top of it then look at the
piece of paper that says "is there anybody there'. The glass slides over to
the word 'yes' and the chests open allowing you to take the Hoover bag and
the stethescope. Put the stethoscope and cupids bow on the tomb of Doctor
Love in the small courtyard, you are rewarded with the third bell. Put
this on the last altar and operate the lever, you here a short tune and the
mummy rewards you with a key for the door next to him. Unlock this to
discover a maze filled with rivers of slime. All you need to get through
the maze is plenty of stamina. At the end find a key which fits the locked
door in the room with the bells in it. This is the door to Mestophiles
chamber. Stand on the pentagram and look at the piece of paper that says
'Where is Mestophiles' the evil one dutifully appears, look at him and he
asks you to find his ring. Take the chalice from this room, the flower and
the piece of paper which says 'I wish I was in Kansas'. You may have read
about Susan the Zombie with hay fever who only materialises when she
sneezes. The room she is hiding in is the room where the telephones are so
put your flower in the vase in this room and she will appear with a violent
sneeze. Look at the Zombie and she will inform you that she wants to look
like you. travel back to the room with the ouija board in it and fill up
the chalice with brandy from the barrel. Deliver this to the mummy who is
in shock and he will give you a potion of thieves. Drink this in order to
take the calendar day from the stubborn vampire in the small courtyard then
take your prize to the room with the Hoover in it. Put the hoover bag in
the Hoover then put the calendar day on the altar where you found the book
about the vampire's wife.When she has appeared operate the Hoover and she
is sucked inside the hoover bag which you can remove. Deliver the full
Hoover bag to the love lost vampire who asked you to find his wife, he
rewards you with a mirror spell. Take this down to the zombie who wants to
look like you and drop it in the square in front of her. She transforms
into your double and returns Mestophiles ring. Take this to Mestophiles who
rewards you with some mistletoe and tells you to prove that you are evil.
Put the mistletoe and the Santa hat on the tomb of Nicholas Kiss, take the
invisible potion. Drink this so you can creep up to the two objects that
keep jumping out of your grasp in the room near the bells. The objects are
a piece of paper with the word 'Innocent' written on it, and a telekinesis
potion. In tha small courtyard you may have noticed a potion that is too
far away for you to pick up. Drink the telekinesis potion and look at the
piece of paper that says 'Will you move please', the potion that sails
towards you is a potion of evil. Go and stand on the pentagram nearby and
look at the piece of paper that says 'I wish I were in Kansas', you are
magically transported to a room where a zombie sits on trial for stealing
some pebbles. Look at the zombie and the two mummies inform you of his
charge and then ask you whay your verdict is. Look at the piece of paper
with the word 'Innocent' written on it' under the influence of the potion
of evil. Instead of saying innocent you say guilty and the poor zombie is
instantly executed, nothing remains of him but a piece of zombie face which
you can take. Deliver this to Mestophiles to prove how evil you are, he
rewards you with a book 'Wuthering Heights' then asks you to give him your
soul. Put the book and the tennis racket on the tomb of Martina Bronte and
take the TV areial. Make sure your ghost trap is empty then head back to
the room where the ghost and the television are located. Put the ghost trap
on the floor between the ghost and the television then put the TV areial on
top of the television. The ghost will be swallowed whole by your trap
allowing you to reach the key that was behind him. Deposit him in the ghost
trap in the conveyor belt room, this results in the trap expolding, move
out of the way and you will notice a drop of your blood on the floor.
Return to Mestophiles chamber where you can now unlock the door and view for
the first time the imposing soul stealer. Put your blood on here to bring
the machine to life then hold your breath as you are stripped of your soul.
After the soul stealer has done it's worst you can pick up your soul and
deliver it to the evil Mestophiles who informs you that you now have the
power of evil, enough in fact to murder your beloved brother. On to level
four.

Level 4

Pick up the light bulb and walk into the next room, speak to the monk sat
in-between two chests, he says 'The Lord be with you'. Operate the floor
tile nearby, underneath you will find a layrel wreath. Walk to the left and
operate a second floor tile near to the lamp, take the apple that was
underneath it. Pull the lever and go through the door and operate a third
floor tile that's hidden beneath a book, under here is a vanish spell. Take
this and return to the lamp where you would have seen a Knight, each time
you put the light bulb in the lamp the light bulb lights up and the Knight
travels over to the lamp and removes the bulb before returning to his
original position. Put the vanish spell on the floor between the Knight and
the lamp before putting the light bulb in the lamp. The Knight stands on
the spell and vanishes giving you access to the piece of paper that says
'and also with you'. Go and stand opposite the monk and look at your piece
of paper, the chests open allowing you to take some stamina and a flower.
Travel back to the place where you found the vanish spell and begin to walk
down the river nearby, top up your stamina when it gets low. At the end of
the river is the 'Tomb of the King's Knight Caesar Petal', put your laurel
wreath and flower on here and take the stamina that appears in their place.
Near to the monk is a locked door, insert the door key and enter a room
where you will notice a courtier who has got hiccups, operate the floor
tiles near to the pianola, take the rosary beads and firework. Return to
previous room and drop the rosary beads into the fountian of confusion and
take the prayer book. Drop the book and the apple on the 'Tomb of the
King's Knight Eve Holywords'. Take the stick that appears and return to the
place where you found the rosary beads, travel down the passageway until
you find a hole in the wall, insert the stick, pull the lever and open the
door. When you walk in this room the door locks behind you, operate the two
floor tiles in this room and take Excalibur and the deflated balloon. Drop
excalibur onto the hand that's sticking out of the water, it disappears
allowing you to reach a vanish spell and the lever that opens the door to
get back out. Drop the vanish spell between the Knight and the sweetie jar
then take one of the sweeties that are lying around on the floor and put in
the jar, the knight vanishes as he moves to take it allowing you to reach a
piece of paper that says "I've found your watch' and the King's watch".
Leave the room and travel back to the fountian where you put the rosary
beads, next to this is the wind stone, put the deflated balloon on here to
change it to an inflated balloon. Put this down in front of the courtier
with hiccups, the balloon bursts which gives the courtier enough of a
fright to rid him of his hiccups. He gives you a picture of twins in
return. Put the picture in the fountian of Gemini situated in the room
where you found Excalibur and take the double action potion. This potion
allows you to open the troublesome door controlled by two levers near to
the pianola, this allows you to enter the room where the baby prince lies
peacefully in his cot, until you try to take the sun symbol that is, he
screams violently each time you try to remove it, take the piece of paper
which says 'the baby is crying'. Leave this room and travel further down
the passageway, the room at the end is the King's chamber. The monk in this
room asks if you repent your sins which of course you don't. The king asks
you to tell her he loves her and allows you take a rose so you can say it
with flowers. If you give the king his watch he puts it on his watch stand
but doesn't reward you in any way. To take back his watch you have to tell
him the baby is crying and he will go and stand beside the child. When he
is stood beside the child you can't give him any of the items he asks for,
to make him return to his place by the watch stand you have to tell him the
tannoy is broken. Take the door key and the nightingale before you leave
this room. Travel back up the passageway and find the locked door that fits
the key you are carrying. Inside this room is a courtier who seems to be
slightly deaf and another Knight who is preventing your reaching some
altars, nearby is a jewellery box. Operate the floor tile and take the
cream cake then travel back to the baby's room, nearby is a lever that
opens a door into a room where you notice another monk who wants to be your
friend even though you don't want to be his, also in here is a machine gun
and the 'Tomb of the King's Fawkes Eclair'. Put the firework and the cream
cake on here, take the slimfast potion. Travel back to the room where the
weighing scales are and drink the potion before standing between the two
chests, They open allowing you to take a stick and a piece of paper with 'I
love you' written on it. Go and find the second hole in the wall which is
situated beyond the room where you found excalibur. Insert the stick,
operate the lever and enter the previously unexplored territory. In here is
a nurses bag, it would be a good idea to put the nightingale on here so you
can take the throat lozenge that appears in it's place. Operate the floor
tile and take the vanish spell. A shortcut out of this room allows you
access to the room where the courtier is that can't seem to hear you. In
the passageway between the two rooms is a protection potion which allows
you to take the flux capacitor. Deliver the throat lozenge to the courtier
who has lost his voice near to the river, he rewards you with a music
sheet. Down a short passage you will find an interesting looking room with
four lightening altars inside it, a watch stand and a laser. Drop the flux
capacitor inside the laser then put the singular prismatic orb you find in
this room onto the nearest altar to the laser. Operate the laser to see the
results of your actions. If you put the King's watch on the watch stand
then tell the King through the tannoy in his room that you have found his
watch, the king comes searching for it, if the watch is there he retrieves
it. If the watch is missing he just walks away. Take the music sheet and
put it on the bed of nails in the room where you've met the friendless
monk. Take the music sheet full of holes and put it on the pianola, this
opens a chest in the room next door which has been hiding a soprano potion.
You can now sing the password to the courtier in the king's chambers, he
opens a door for you allowing you into the queen's chambers. The queen
gives you a note for the king in return for the rose but she appears to
want nothing more out of life than an endless supply of chocolate. Operate
the floor tile and take the chest key and pick up the jewellery from the
queen's table. The key fits the chest in the same room as the nurses bag,
inside is a paintbrush. Put the vanish spell down between the knight and
the jewellery box then put the jewellery in the box. The knight vanishes as
he moves over to take it. You now have access to the first emerald altar
and the potion of repentance which is perched on top of it. Return to the
monk who wants you to repent your sins, drink the potion and look at him,
he asks you once again but this time you lie through your teeth telling him
of course you will repent. He lets you have the white rabbit from the chest
beside him. Put the white rabbit in the hat in the same room to open a
further two chests, take the prismatic orb and the marksman potion. Before
you leave give the note to the king who rewards you with a hearing aid and
asks you to bring him his sceptre. Go and stand behind the machine gun,
drink the potion and operate the gun. This time you hit the lever which
opens the door below you. In here is another knight who prevents you
reaching a chest key and a railway track with a train on it that doesn't
seem to be working. Operate the floor tile and take the unbrella. Deliver
the hearing aid to the deaf courtier and take the quiet potion. Drink this
whilst facing the courtier who asks you to whisper the password, then look
at your piece of paper which says 'I love you'. He opens the locked door
besides him as a reward. Inside notice the battery charger and take the
picture of night and day off the floor. Put this in the fountian of
opposites in the room where the nurses's bag is and take the emerald that
appears in it's place. Put this in the emerald altar which disappears
allowing you to reach the next altar which has an alter ego potion sat on
top of it. Drink this potion whilst facing the monk who wants you to be his
friend then look at him. Instead of saying no you say yes and he allows you
to take the king's sceptre from out of the chest beside him. Deliver the
sceptre to the king who rewards you a sovereign. Put this in the fountian
of King's near the weighing scales and take the ankh that appears. Put
this in the fountian of Egypt next to the queen and take the third emerald.
Put this on the next emerald altar and take the picture of Notre Dame which
you can place on the 'Tomb of the King's Quasi Da Vinci' along with the
paint brush. You now have another vanish spell so proceed back into the
queen's chamber and find the door bell, nearby is a locked door. Place the
spell in position just outside the door then operate the door bell. The
knight that was lurking on the other side of the door pokes his head out to
see who it is and vanishes, you can now explore the room he was gaurding.
Inside is a barometer where you can put the umbrella, take the emerald that
appears. You are probably fed up feeding the queen chocolate by now so put
one of the bars into the cyanide, give it to the queen who doesn't ask for
any more chocolate and instead gives you the combination to the chests
gaurded by the monk nearby. Stand in front of him and look at the numbers
in your rucksack to open the chests. Take the prismatic orb and the picture
of the Holy Ghost. Drop the emerald onto the last altar, take the battery ,
the vanish spell and the numerical potion that are lying behind it. Return
to the battery charger and charge the battery before putting it in the
power pack that drives the train. The train steams off down the track and
pushes the paternal potion that was lying out of reach into a place where
you can take it. Drink the paternal potion and take the sun symbol from the
prince's cot, this time he doesn't scream. Travel to the room where you
charged your battery and locate the fountian of the father which controls
two doors that prevent you reaching a monk. Put the sun symbol and the
picture of the Holy Ghost into the fountian and the doors unlock allowing
you to look at the monk. He asks you for the combination so drink the
numerical potion, look at the original four numbers that made up the first
combination so you can recite them in a different order. The chests beside
the monk open allowing you to take the last prismatic orb and a drinking
vessel. Return to the last remaining knight and put the vanish spell
between him and the barrel. Put the drinking vessel down under the spout of
the barrel and operate the tap. The thirsty knight meets his fate on your
cunning spell allowing you to take the chest key he was guarding. Open the
chest in the baby's room and take the theory of relativity which you can
put in the fountian of Einstein. This can be found near the barometer. Take
the genius potion you recieve in return which makes you clever enough to
operate the IQ test, the chest beside it opens and you can take the super
glue. You now have everything you need to carry out your dastardy plan so
retrace your footsteps back to the room where the laser and the lightening
altars are positioned. Put all remaining  prismatic orbs on the altars, put
the watch on it's stand and the glue on the floor. Summon the king by
telling him you have found his watch through the tannoy then wait for him
to appear. When he walks over to his watch he finds himself stuck on the
glue, this allows you to sneak over and operate the laser. The electrical
beam bounces off each prismatic orb until it hits the poor king and fries
him to a cinder.

PART ONE
The game starts with you standing in the chapel, next to the Count's
wearing a sapphire ring. Take the ring, then go West to the ballroom.
Enter the fireplace and get the idol. Leave the fireplace by going South,
then clean off the idol, which is your source of light.

Now go East to the chapel, then South, West, South, and East into the
armory. Plenty of rusting old junk here! However, some of it is still
useful, so pick up the shield and the sword. From there, return to the
stairwell, then go East into the Kettle Room and then North to the room
with the animal heads.

Pause here for a moment, and move the heads (that's what you need the
sword for). This will reveal a safe. You don't have the combination
yet, but you will soon enough. For now, just drop the sword and the head,
then continue onward by going Eastward until you come to the lab.

Ignore the Ju-Ju bag for now and get the chemicals. Don't worry if
anything explodes, the shield will protect you. Once you have the
chemicals, go West and drop the shield. Make your way back to the torture
chamber, moving the kettle (when you come to it) along the way. When you
get to the torture chamber, mix and then drink the chemicals.

ZAP! You are now small enough to fit through the tiny doorway. Go through
the door, and pick up the saw. Look at the graves, and get the fourleaf
clover. Return East, then go back to the chapel. From there, go East to
the huge stone door with the sapphire set in it.

Sapphire? Hmm, does that remind you of anything? Yep, sure does! Wave the
ring, and the door disappears to be replaced by a tunnel with a slippery
chute heading down. Drop the ring, then slide down the chute into room
below. Pick up the plaque, then enter the hole in the wall.

PART TWO
You now emerge into the Medium's room. She runs out when you enter, but she
will return if you "Summon Medium", and will make helpful, if cryptic,
remarks. Now look at the crystal ball, and you will be magically returned
to the tunnel. Get the knife, and go back to the chapel. Drop the knife
there, then go on to the stairwell.

Once at the stairwell, pick up the glass, then go East to the kettle room.
Since you moved the kettle before, you will notice there is now a dark
hole in the floor. Drop the idol, then enter the hole. Read the plaque,
which has the combination of the safe written on it (the writing is tiny,
so you needed the glass to see it. The plaque itself glows in the dark.).

Once you know the combination, drop the plaque and the glass. Now get
the rabbit's foot. Even though you can't see it, it is there, and you can
pick it up. Climb out of the hole and get the idol again, then head along
North to the room with the safe.

Enter the combination by saying Turn (first number) and then Turn (second
number). Open the safe and get the antique hammer that's inside. Now
you're ready to tackle the fireplace again, so return to the ballroom
fireplace. On the way, stop off at the chapel, and put the rabbit's foot
on Count Christo.

PART  3
Saw through the grating, to reveal a button. Push the button, and a giant
fan sucks you further up the chimney, to where a chimney sweep is stuck.
Give him a good push, and he's free! In return for helping him, he gives
you a piece of paper with a magic word written on it. Remember that word,
because it's important.

Climb back down to the fireplace, and then once again, go to the stairwell.
This time, go upstairs to the parlor, where the Ju-Ju statue is.
Say the magic word from the paper, then go back down and head for the
laboratory. Remember to pick up the shield before you go in!

In the lab, get the Ju-Ju bag, and make tracks for the tunnel with the
chute. You can drop the shield along the way, since you won't be needing
it any longer. Slide down the chute, then wave the bag. Voila! The little
crack in the wall is now large enough for you to pass through.

Go crack, and get the torn page. Now, open the bag, and get the book. Read
both the book and the page, and make careful note of the ritual needed
for freeing Count Cristo from the curse. Drop the book and the page, and
get the stick. Go South back to the chute room, then enter the hole. Look
once again into the crystal ball.

So, here you are in the tunnel once more. Hang in there, you're almost
done! Go West, then North to the room with the window. Go window, and get
the little VooDoo doll on the ledge. Go back South into the room, then
return to the chapel. You now have everything you need to revoke the
curse.

Following the instructions from the magic book, complete the ritual,
freeing the Count.

Here are the locations of some of the objects in the game:

Tuckborough			Black Flask
East of Buckland		Wooden Staff
Grey Havens & Michel Delving	Blue Potion
Forlond 			Black Flask
South of Forland		Palantir
Belegost			Mithril Mail
Bombadils' House		Elven Blade
Barrows Downs			Elven Blade
North of Barrow Downs		Elven Blade
West of Annuminas		Golden Sceptre
South of Ost-in-Edhil		Ancient Sword
Rivendell			Mithril Mail
Lorien				Elven Cloak, Glowing Phial, Coil of Rope
North of Grebor 		Dwarven Hammer
North of Dol Goldur		Dwarven Ring
South of Mount Gram		Black Flask, Red Arrow, Mithril Mail

If Gandalf goes to Derdingle, 1,000 huorns will go to Hornburg and 1,000
Ents will go to Isengard. Aragorn can be found at Bree and Merry can be
found at Buckland. Five-hundred trolls can easily handle everyone from
Minas Tirith, Osgiliath and Cair Andros.

RACE		ABILITY

Elves		Good shots, but physically weak.
Dwarves 	Bad shots, but very strong.
Humans		Fine on both.
Tree Ents	Good shots and mighty fighters, but they will run if the
		forest is in danger.
Hobbits 	A peaceful race, bad at everything.
Orcs		Strong but stupid, easy to kill.
Half Orcs	Wimps and stupid, even easier to kill.
Trolls		Killers, avoid at all costs.

GANDALF has staggering power in battle and is the only character you can
control who is capable of defeating the Nazgul, Saruman or Sauron in single
combat. Just Gandalf on his own can wipe out an entire company of Orcs. So,
Gandlaf should be used wherever the need is greatest if you are trying to
sneak Frodo into Mordor undetected and virtually unaccompanied, Gandalf is
best employed at Minas Tirith. If you are planning instead to escort Frodo,
Gandalf makes a magnificent bodyguard!

The NAZGUL also have staggering power in battle. The Ring bearer,
unaccompanied, can avoid Nazgul by taking paths that do not cross the
routes of the enemy in Sauron's campaign plan. In the case of the Nazgul,
discretion is always the better part of valour and the best way to deal
with them is to avoid them entirely. They are quite capable of massacring
an entire army.

SAURON, like the Nazgul,is to be avoided altogether. However, he spends
most of his time within the confines of Mordor itself. If he does venture
beyond the borders of his foul realm, it will only be for a very short
distance. There is no danger, for instance, of encountering him at Minas
Tirith.

Although not as deadly as the Nazgul, SARUMAN is a power to be reckoned with
in battle. he is usually to be found within the triangle of Orthanc,
Edoras and Helm's Deep, but may occasionally attempt to seize the citadel
of Minas Tirith. If it is well guarded, Saruman alone is unlikely to
succeed. Even so, treat this character with caution.

SHORT SOLUTION:
First leave Frodo and the company to follow the way they are going.
When they meet Merry take him and keep going to Rivendell.
Before you get there go South at Trollshaws.
The Hobbits can beat Wolves but not trolls.
Wait there till the computer tells you about Gandalf being found. Then bring
Gandalf to the Hobbits.
You should make two armies, one to the South (at Welsford) and one to the North
(Thraduil's Palace). Do not worry if initial orders are not obeyed. Once the
enemy starts moving your armies will start to take orders.
You can then meet at the Dagorlad plain.
Now march to Mt Doom and fight the 5000 Orcs and finish off with one of the
Hobbits dropping the ring into Mt Doom to complete the game.

Each letter of the word WINGS on the main title screen does something.
Hold down <RIGHT MOUSE>, now hold down <CTRL>, <LEFT SHIFT>, and

	W	Toggles music on/off
	I	Turns <CAPS LOCK> into an autofire button
	N	No flight school missions
	G	Guess (Dunno what this does!)
	S	Saves game without having to exit game

Alternatively, go to flight school, and click on the bullseye on the
plane up the top of the screen with <LEFT MOUSE>. You will be taken back to
the main menu. (some versions may ask if you want to quit - say no!) Now
return to flight school if you have to, and create a new pilot and call him
"Orca The Killer Tomato" (it IS case sensitive so type it in exactly as it
appears here). Orca already has his wings and is the best at all the skills.

To access a large menu of options, go to flight school, create a new
pilot and name him "  Who is The Riddler" (yes, two spaces at the front
and it is case sensitive). But, instead of pressing <RETURN> to enter
the name, hit <ESC> instead. Now you can choose to run any or all
of these yummy cheats!

BALLOON BUSTING- The first thing to do in Balloon Busting missions
is to take out the AA gun. It isn't too hard so give it a try.

DOG FIGHTS- When involved in a dog fight with other planes always
attack from above. This is because if you attack from below the other
plane will climb which is very annoying. By attacking from above you
drive the other plane down rather than up.

BEING TAILED- When you are being tailed hold the joystick to the

There is nothing you can do to stop the murder taking place. Make sure
that you examine the keyhole of the clock closely. A good hiding place
is the couch. Ask Duffy for hints - he can be quite helpful. Search the
Butler after the crime.

Solution:
Okay, you start South of the house, where you just picked up a
matchbook. <By the way, none of the stuff that came with the game is
really necessary to solving the case>. Go North twice to the front door
and ring the bell. Phong will let you in. Then just try to go East, and
Phong will lead you to the Living Room, where Monica and Mr.
Linder are. Now, wait <get used to doing that, because there's a
lot of waiting in this one>, and Linder will eventually take you
to his office. Sit down in the wooden chair, and Linder will
hand you a note. Read it, as it will help waste some time. Now,
just do anything <but stay seated!> to make time pass. Show the
matchbook to Linder for an interesting reaction, if you like. In
any case, you just have to keep waiting. Eventually, Monica will
come in briefly to announce she's going to the movies. This is
not what you're waiting for, however! So, keep on waiting, and
finally, the murder will occur. Linder will be shot while you sit
there, and you can't stop it from happening. Read the
description carefully at the moment the shot is fired. There's
something odd about it. In fact, the whole thing is a setup. The
first thing to do is stand up, then push the button. Instead of
ringing to summon the butler, it causes a strange click to be
heard from the clock. At this point, Phong will enter the room.
Tell him you want the keys, and he'll hand them over to you.
Now, examine the clock. Keyhole seems a little strange, doesn't
it? The doorbell rings while you're doing this, so as Phong goes
to answer the door, examine the keyhole.

I'll bet you're getting some ideas already! However, you'll
need to have the powder analyzed, and Duffy hasn't arrived yet,
so wait around until he does. Then get the powder analzyed <you
can ignore Stiles, he's only a red herring>. While that's being
done, examine the window <you can't open the clock yet, it's the
one key you don't have>. The green wire seems suspicious, so get
it for future reference. Now, go West into the Hallway, then
North twice, and open the Butler's door. Go West into the room,
and read the mystery book <by the way, you can drop the telegram
and note, they aren't important>. A gun receipt is used as a
bookmark. The purchaser's name is obviously phoney, but hang on
to the receipt anyway. Okay, from the Butler's Room, go East
twice to Monica's room, then unlock and open the back door. Go
East into the Backyard, then South twice to the office path.
Aha, a muddy gun! No fingerprints, alas, but you might want to
take it along with you, just in case. Now, go West into the Side
Yard. Hmm, more footprints here, but they aren't quite the same
as the ones on the office path. In fact, it looks like someone
was standing here for awhile. Wonder who it might have been? <No,
*not* Sergeant Duffy!>. Anyway, go West again to the driveway,
then North and East into the Garage. Unlock and open both the
garage door and the workshop door, then go East into the
Workshop. The place looks like an electrician's paradise, and
there isn't much you can do here; but, there are spools of wire
hanging around. Could it be...? Examine spool, and you have
established a link of sorts between this place and the study.
The green wire is obviously from this room. Now, all you need is
the person who put it there.

You now stand there waiting for Monica. Just keep waiting;
she'll arrive <saying "Wait for Monica" is easiest. It will take
a while, so if you want to hunt down Phong and ask him about the
gun receipt, you have time>. When she does get there, she'll
fiddle briefly with the junction box <very suspicious!> before
noticing you. Now, wait until she leaves, then follow her. You
*must* use directions here, just saying "Follow Monica" won't
work. Follow her all the way to her room, and wait for her to
come back out of the bathroom. When she returns, ask her about
Mr. Linder. Her response will establish the motive. Now, wait
some more, and she will eventually leave the room. Follow her
again, this time to the office. As soon as you get in there,
handcuff her. Somewhere along the way, Sgt. Duffy will have
left with the body, so you can't arrest her until he comes back.
In the meantime, you have to find some very important evidence.
So, first search Monica for the key. When you get it, unlock the
clock and open it. She's already removed the gun, but you can
search her for that, also. Now, just wait until Duffy returns,
and arrest her for the murder. And that should be about it. By
the way, if you try leaving her and waiting in the office <so you
can find the gun in the clock>, you'll find that, however hard
you try, you won't be able to handcuff her <which is necessary so
she can be searched>. So, you'll just have to wait and follow her.

While playing, pause with <SPACE> and type in "RAINBOW". Then unpause and
press
	<C> to fill the pot,
	<S> to complete the level, and
	<T> to complete the game.

Level 1: Mor the deserted planet
Mor never was, in fact, a populated planet. Its distance to its sun was far too
great for any form of intraterrestial life to evolve. However, many living
entities frequently visit Mor, and the lesser hoodlums of the Great System use
it as their hiding and meeting site. Acts of cleansing have failed due to lack
of general interest. There is no vegetation on Mor, and the planet is very
poor with valuable minerals, however the beautiful stone structures never cease
to amaze and amuse tourists.
The Tourist Agency for Eccentrics has included Mor in its network, and because
of that, built passages up to the city of Zeli.

Level 2: The city of Zeli
The city of Zeli was built to honour the goddess Zeli, the chief deity of the
ancient people. Legend says Zeli hates everything decorative and superfluous
and prefers effectiveness over beauty, due to which the city includes many
fascinatingly elaborate devices, which many cultural races nowadays use. Some
information sources claim that the temple is now inhabited with a religious
tribe known as the Children of Zeli, who wish to follow in their ancestors'
footsteps.
The ancient people have even included in their constructions passages down to
Mor and up to the world of dreams.

Level 3: The world of dreams
There has always been a world of dreams, though not always in this very form.
This particular world of dreams was born when a little human child dreamed up
his own paradise. When the child matured, the world of dreams became concrete,
and nowadays attracts many visitors due to its natural beauty. Since the
gravity in the world of dreams is freely variable, structures can float in air
in curious formations.
The child's wakening from his sleep caused passages down to the city of Zeli
and up to the wheat fields to appear.

Level 4: The wheat fields
The wheat fields are vast. Their total area is greater than that of an average
planet. Amazingly, very few beings live on the fields, for they are not needed
to control them. The wheat tries to take care of itself, in which it usually
succeeds. The lack of maintenance and supervision attracts pests and criminals.
The fields are the main food source of the Great System. Many institutions buy
their wheat directly from the fields.
For export of the wheat, passages down to the world of dreams and up to the
temple of Stagm have been constructed.

Level 5: The temple of Stagm
The temple of Stagm was built to honour Stagm, who is the equivalent of a devil
in the ancient people's mythology. The temple is very small, because very few
ancient people wanted any part in constructing such a foul temple, and thus the
temple had to be kept small due to lack of workforce. However nowadays people
take religious matters less seriously, and people have started to like Stagm
and his followers again.
Foreseeing events of this type, the ancient people have decided to include
passages down to the wheat fields and up to the ice caverns of fear.

Level 6: The ice caverns of fear
The ice caverns of fear are a cold, hostile place. No beings live there in any
form of permanent residence and very few even visit them, because it is so cold
there. The greater thugs of the Great System use the caverns as their hiding
and meeting place. Acts of cleansing have failed due to far too hostile
conditions. It is a shame that the caverns are so hostile and deserted, for
they contain many fascinating ice structures.
On the ground, some of the ice has melted, creating passages down to the temple
of Stagm, and up to Unspace.

Level 7: Unspace
Some beings say Unspace is a boring place. To other beings it is very
fascinating. It is not clearly known what Unspace actually is, but the most
accurate analyses show that it consists of all the matter which was permanently
lost in other places, and has sculpted itself into beautiful forms in Unspace.
Some beings have even been reported to intentionally lose matter in a place,
and then travel to Unspace to enjoy the matter there.
All disused passages in other places have here evolved into passages down to
the ice caverns of fear, and up to Mysteria.

Level 8: Mysteria
There is no official coverage on Mysteria. In fact, according to the head of
the Great System, it does not even exist. However, daring explorers and
adventurers claim to actually have been to Mysteria. Their speech is tainted
with rumour, but it seems that Mysteria includes giant bubbles. These may float
on top of a form of solid floor, but mostly the structure of Mysteria is so far
unknown.
The explorers and adventures say that they have departed from this place via
passages leading down to Unspace.

Go to the shop with all five stars and enough money to buy another star. Buy
another star and you'll get the money for that star. Then leave, complete
another tune and do the same again. You can do this until you get bored.

A secret room on the first section will warp you to any level in the game.
Simply buy the token from the shop and exit as the body. Now go down the
well and enter the Gents toilets. Use the token on the bubble gum machine
and you'll fly up to a secret room with another Gents toilet door and an
exit. Go through the Gents, then you'll appear in a room with a Ladies and
Gents door. Go over to the right and enter an invisible door (Go to the far
right and it should be found there). Now go through the Gents to the

annother description:
On round 1, collect 150 wizdollars and buy a token from the wizshop.
Exit the shop with wizkid in body mode, raise the bucket in the well by
leaping up and down on the handle, then go down the well and enter the
gent's toilets. Use the token on the condom machine, then wizkid will be
transported to the entrance of the secret cave. Enter the caves by going
through the door on the left and leave by going through the hidden door on
the right, now go back through the door on the left again and the current
room number will be displayed at the top of the screen.

Going through the door on the left will take wizkid to the cave number
which equals the current cave number multiplied by two, and then added to
one. For example, going through the left door in room 6 would take wizkid
to room 13. Going through the door on the right will take wizkid to the
cave number which equals the current cave number multiplied by two, for
example, going through the right door in room 5 will take wizkid to room
10. Going through the hidden door on the right will take wizkid back to
the cave entrance so you can either go back in or return to the start by
going through the door marked exit. Using these methods you can enter a
number of rooms with loads of features:

River Bank:
I sit with my sister Emily on a bench, and feel quite bored, so I decide
to stand and go to the East, towards the pear groves.

Pear Groves:
Here I gather a pear (4/4), as I walk around for a while, a rabbit with
pink eyes comes running by. Then the pears starts to glow and turnes
into small lanterns. I follow the footsteps of the rabbit and comes to a
hole, that the rabbit has gone through.

Field/Rabbit's Hole:
I crawl into the hole, and go South, where I fall in a deep well, during
the fall I see a jar glass which I take with me.

Passage:
Soon after I land on a pile of leaves in a East-West passage. Here I see
a door with the letter "C". The door is closed. I get of the leaves and
search them, here I find a key, the key is marked with the word: Locker,
and the number 10.

Long Hall:
While searching the table I find a glass box, which contains a piece of
cake. On the cover of the glass box I read the words "Eat me", above the
letters is a picture of a girl as big as a tree. The bottle, says "Drink
me", and shows a very small girl. The bottle seems to contain a magic
drink, I bring both things, and continue.

Music Room:
Here the chairs are dancing to the music comming from what seems to be an
automatic grand piano. I open the grand piano and finds a key "C" and a
key "G" (Music keys NOT regulary keys !). The "G" key however I can't
reach. So I wait until a chair is near the grand piano, then I take the
music sheet, which makes the music stop playing, and the chairs stop
dancing. Now I stand on the chair, open the bottle with the magic drink,
and drink the stuff. Right away it makes me smaller! Then I climb into
the grand piano and get the "G" key (15/19). Now I leave the grand piano
before I regain my normal size.

Broom Cupboard:
I use the "G" key to open the door to the broom cupboard, where I find a
"Cardshoe" (To be used for picking up cards). Besides that I also take
the coat hanger and the overall.

Long Halls:
Here I open the small door with the "G" key, since I'm too big to fit
into the overall I open the fan, and wave the fan (5/24). I now have the
size of the overall, which I then wear. Then a rabbit arrives to the
scene, the rabbit thinks I'm Mary-Anne, and tells me to go to it's house
and get a pair of pink gloves and a fan, it also tells me that it will
wait for me at the Palace gates. Then before it leaves it throws me a
key (3/27).

Enter Wonderland.

By The Palace Gates:
Here I recieve a welcome by the Jack of hearts, which tells me to get the
treacle cake (A kind of syrup cake) the pantry of the Queen of
hearts. He also give me the promise to fullfill my dreams and leave
Wonderland. On a stick I see an insect, I take it, it disappears, and I
get the stick. Then I go to the rabbit's house.

Front Garden/Rabbit's House:
The brass sign on the door says: "W.RABBIT", I take the clothes peg from
the washing line, then I loosen the washing line from the tree. I open
the door with the key I got from the rabbit.

Kitchen:
Here I take the breakfast egg, and the cups from the cabinet.

Garden Shed:
I go across the garden, behind the house into the shed where I see a
vice. I put the clothes hanger in the vice, straighten it and open the
vice (8/35). Now I enter the house again and go to the top floor.

Landing:
Here I open the standing clock, and finds the 6 of diamonds. (This is the
first of ALL 13 diamond playing cards you MUST find during the game). As
soon as I get the card it disappears into the card shoe (1/36). Then I
take the right hand pouch. The door to the rabbit's bedroom unfotunately
is closed, and there is a key in the keyhole, but, from the other side!
I notice a gap underneath the door so I decide to do the old trick. I
put sheet of music in gap, and stick the straight coat hanger in the
keyhole, so it will force the key out, and it will fall on the paper!
Now I pull the paper back, and I now own the key to the rabbit's bedroom.
I unlock the bedroom door, (6/42).

White Rabbit's Bedroom:
When I enter the bedroom I see the things I came to get, the pink fan
(4/46)and the pink gloves (4/50). I also get the quartz bottle which
contains a magic drink. I notice a white fluid which I can't bring, but
who knows it might be usefull later on. Then I leave the rabbit's
bedroom and proceed to the castle to deliever the goods.

Palace Grounds:
Here I find a pair of garden gloves, which I bring with me. There is a
wooden door in the corner, I examine it, but discover that it is locked,
and the keyhole is missing.

In Front Of The Palace:
The well is surrounded by a mist of sparkling water, to get a bit of the
water I hold the cup in the mist(3/53). Then I try to get into the
palace, but fail, since I don't have the pass! The pass is hidden in the
Duchess' house. On the way to her house I notice a 30 feet tall elm
tree, which will be of importance later on in the game.

Lounge/Duchess' House:
I open the door and enters here house, Then I get the red glasses case,
and the card 2 of diamonds, to get the card I must move the "Gazette"
from the table, get the card, and return the "Gazette", then the card will
disappear into the "cardshoe"(2/55).

Dining Room:
Here I spot the pass I'm looking for, it's lying in a glass case, however
the key for the glass case is not among my belongings, so I proceed to
the first floor.

Duchess' Bedroom:
I go to the bed and find a pair of slippers, then I take of my shoes and
put on the slippers(1/56). Now I can sneak around.

Cooks Bedroom:
To get to the kitchen I have to wear the garden gloves, then I go
to the dinner elevator and enters it. Since the smell from the
kitchen makes me sneeze all the time, I put a clothes peg on my
nose (5/61). Then I pull the rope (2/63). And go to the West into
the kitchen.

Kitchen:
Since the plates are flying around here, I decide it's not a safe
place to be in, so I do what I have to do in a hurry!
I get the carving knife, opens the refrigerator, get the cream with
the help from the jar glass and the jug, and then close the
refrigerator! (Before the door closes and compromisses me).
Now I only have to get the glass key and then go to the dinner
elevator and exit the scene.

Dining Room:
Now in possesion of the glass key, I open the glass case, and
get the pass (16/79). I change my shoes, and take my garden gloves
of. To the South West of the house there is another gardening fork
which I take. Now on the way to the palace I make a halt by the:

Horse Chestnut Tree:
When they look at the cream, they tell that it is the favorite
food of the Cheshire cat. I then put the cream in the saucer, and
the cat appears on the scene, it eats the cream and leaves the
scene again. By examining the saucer I now find a piece of sugar
on it. I get the sugar (6/85).
I also find the left hand pouch, and then I move on to the castle.

Eastern Hall/Palace:
I give the pass to the guard, and then the rabbit appears, I give
the fan and the oink gloves to the rabbit (6/91) as a thank you I
recieve a paint brush from the rabbit.

Central Hall:
Here I search coat of arms, and discovers 2 heart cards which is
playing croquet with bat and ball.
I get the coat hook from where the coat of arms is hanging, and I
notice a jury roster in which my playing cards is listed in a
certain order. (The order in which I've got them! This is *very*
important towards the end of the game).
Then I take a brief look at the Throne room, but enter it I
can not.

Conservatory:
The only thing I can get here is the handle, I have to use it on
the clock, so I turn the handle clockwise (6/97).

Palace Kitchen:
On the way to the kitchen I notice a crystal chest in the banquet
room, inside the crystal chest I see a invitation. Since the chest
is locked, I need to find the key! in the kitchen I got to the
Royal chef which flutters around with a piece of paper.
I ask him about the paper and he tells me that he must prepare a
treacle cake for the majestys banquet.
Allthough he is missing the ingredients, which is listed on the
paper: Sparkling water, Sugar, Flour, Lard, Treacle and Breadcrumbs.
Since I allready have the sugar I give it to him (5/102).
Before leaving I take the steak with me.

Steps:
Now I go down the basement stairs, and unlock the basement door
with the key hanging there. Since there is something blocking the
door from the other side I can't enter, so I proceed to the:

Guards Quarter's:
Here I see 13 lockers, since I have the key to number 10 locker, I
open the number 10 locker and find a key to the number 3 locker.
I open the number 3 locker and find 7 of diamonds (3/105), and
the key for the number 7 locker, in the number 7 locker I find a
pair of boots which I take with me. (Note, don't pass the guards
at the entrance carrying the boots!). So now it's time I search
the upper floor of the castle.

Queens Bedroom:
In the queens bedroom I find another card, the queen of diamonds
(4/109), and in the queenside drawer I find a wooden key.

Bathroom:
In the mirror cupboard I get a big lens and a bottle of nail
varnish remover. Then I proceed further up.

Royal Observatory:
Here I find the fifth card the 4 of diamonds (5/114). I open
the glasses-case where I find a small lens, Which I put here
together with the big lens, since I'm not tall enough to look
through the telescope.
Now I leave the castle, before I do it I however leave the boots
in the Eastern Hall, then I go to the:

Walled Garden:
To get to the walled garden I first go to the tree house, open the
door, go to the West out on the limb, where I tie washing line to
limb, and then climbs down.
Now before I can go on I drop washing line.
In the garden I notice a hedgehog, which I at the moment leave alone.
The wooden trapdoor has a small hole close to the edge, in which I
put the coat-hook,now I pull hook and the trapdoor opens(10/124).
Through a secret passage I now enter the cellar of the palace.

Cellar:
On the table I spot a green bottle containing the long searched
for sparkling water (Don't open the bottle, or else the fizz will
all be gone!). Now I also see why the basement door was
blocked, there is a wedge, which I remove, then I open the door
(11/135) and go up the stairs to the palace.

Palace:
In the kitchen I give the chef the green bottle (10/145). Then
I go through the secret passage and back into the garden.
There I get the washing line, climb up and drop the washing
line, from then I go to:

The Giant Mushroom:
The caterpillar which is blocking the way I give sherbet to
caterpillar (5/150).
Now notice that the mushroom has a left and a right side, now
be *careful*.
Cut left side with carving knife, put chunk into left hand pouch
I do that 3 times, so I now have 3 slices from the left side in
the left hand pouch.
I do the same thing on the right side, but offcourse put the
slices in the right hand pouch. It is of outmost importance
to separate the right and left chunks, they may look alike but
their effect is very different, indeed!

Path/Walled Garden:
I go the path North West of the walnut tree, by using the carving
knife against the wall, I can loosen a brick.
So I get brick with knife. (It's important that you slice the
mushroom before you use the knife on the wall since uding the
knife on the wall makes it blunt!).
In the hole in the wall I see the next card, however when I reach
for it, it will fall into the garden, so I walk back to the garden
(The allready described route) and pick up the card the 6 of
diamonds (6/156).

By The River:
Here I find a dog, who is waiting for me to play with him, so I
throw the stick, which the dog will bring back from the water.
I notice something shining in the dog's mouth, it's a silver
key. To get the key you must give the dog the steak (7/163).

Back Garden/Rabbit's House:
Now I go for a short visit to the rabbits house, where I search
the compost heap with the gardening fork, and I find a card there
the 8 of diamonds (7/170).

Wiggly Waggly path (Treacle Well):
Now I go to the treacle well, where I tie rope to jug and drop
jug, then I tie winch to handle, and turn handle clockwise, the jug
now at the bottom of the well being filled with treacle.
Then I, turn the handle anticlockwise (Also known as counter
clockwise) So now here the jug comes, and I get the jug and
releases it from the rope (9/179). Then I leave for the river
where the beavers at.

Mad Hatter's House:
At the disused beavers hole I open the hatch and go up in a
cupboard, from the vessel I get the lard, in the kitchen I find a
tea chest. Then I go to the breakfast room where I fold the
napkin (So that the breadcrumbs don't fall out). Then I, get the
napkin, in the hat room I find a canvas sack.
After I get the mentioned things I go to the:

Mad Tea Party:
In the teapot there is a clormouse, which is sitting on a card!
so to get there I have to become smaller. I eat a bit of the
mushroom from the right hand pouch and then I, get on teapot, to
get in, I eat another piece of the mushroom from the right hand
pouch, then enter pot (6/185).
I notice the mouse is asleep, so in order to wake him up I say
something, which could be: Hello! Now the mouse moves and I get
the card, the 10 of diamonds (8/193). Then I climb out of the tea
pot, get off the teapot, to get off from the table down to the
floor I eat a piece of mushroom fromt the left hand pouch.
When allready down I leave and go to the mad hatter's house.

Under The Footbridge:
On the return to the palace I get yet another card this time it's
the Jack of diamonds (9/202) Then of to the palace.

Palace Kitchens:
Here I give the chef the jug with the treacle (15/217) and the
napkin with the brreadcrumbs (20/237) and finally the lard
(25/262).

Royal Observatory:
By using the tea chest I'm now tall enough to reach to the
telescope, I put the tea chest down and stand on ttea
chest, and put the large lens into the large end and the small
into the small end (7/269) Now I can look through the telescope
(12/281) To get a better view I have to close the left eye
however. I then turn the telescope towards the South East
untill I see thre tree house, where I see a card hanging on a nail.
Before I leave the Palace I go to the Eastern Hall to get my
boots, then I leave through the cellar.

Walled Garden:
Here I wear the garden gloves, open the canvas sack, get the
hedgehog, put's it in the sack and close the sack.

Tree House:
I put arm through hole and get the 9 diamond (10/291).

Old tree:
At the old tree I open the silver door with the silver key, and I
end up in the Long Hall where I was in the beginnig of the game.
Here I eat a piece of mushroom from the right hand pouch, and I
can now pass through the small door to the West.

Passage:
Here I see the three spades (Cards) working as gardeners, they are
busy painting the white roses red, I eat a piece of mushroom from
the left hand pouch and I help the gardeners (Since I got the
paint brush from the rabbit) (13/304). As a gift for my
assistance I get a bag of flour. Now I open the bottle of
nailvarnish remover and, dip the paint brush into the nailvarnish
remover (8/312).
The sleeping griffin with head of a eagle, eale feathers and a
body of a lion I wake up.

Rock Ledge:
Now I have to listen to a long conversation between the griffin
and the turtle (You have to listen for as long as they talk, it
is *important*). The two are talking about playing cards, and I will
get a usefull information for the end of the game here.
During the trial of the dormouse a lower value playing card has
defended it self, sucessfully against a higher value playing
card, it was the 6 of diamonds against the ace of diamonds.
The reson for this is, that the 6 of diamonds were in the court
prior to the ace, and therefor had more value.

Duck Pond:
When I am at the duckpond I change my shoes and wear the
boots, then I enter the pond (12/324). Then I get the elleventh
card which is the 5 of diamonds (11/335). North of the duck
pond, in the hedge I spot the door which I can open with the
wooden key I've got in the queens bedroom.
Before I go to the palace I take off my boots and wear my shoes,
remember to go around the duck pond when comming back due to the
boots which you now leave here.

Throne Room /Tunnel:
Here I climb upon the queens throne where I eat a piece of
mushroom from the left hand pouch. Now that I'm tall, pull bell
pull.
The wall behind the throne will now open, and the passage through
the tunnel in then free (5/340) here I find the King of diamonds
(12/352) and a red key, which I can use to lock the door to the
guards room.

Palace Kitchens:
Now I can give the chef the missing flour (30/382) and he will
begin to bake the treacle cake. Before I go he will throw me a
crystal key (Type : catch crystal key (TWICE).

Banquet Hall:
With the crystal key I open the crystal chest and get the
invitation to the royal croquet game (3/385).
To play croquet I need a ball and a bat, the ball I allready have
it is the hedgehog! The bat I now have to get.
To get the bat I have to go back to the rabbit's house, once
again.

White Rabbit's Bedroom:
Since I allready have a clean paint brush I put the paint brush
in the white liquid and paints the breakfast egg white (7/392)
then I go to:

Giant Elm Tree:
On the quartz bottle there is a picture of a man with a extreme
lon neck, so I open the bottle and drink the magic liquid
then I put the fresh painted egg in the mouth and wait until my
neck is so long that my head is in the tree crown.
Then I, drop breakfast egg into nest, and waits, until my neck is
back to normal size,then I wait until my score is (19/411).
Meanwhile the egg is hatched by the pigeon.
I open the glass box and eats the cake, I grow and take the
flamingo from the nest (8/419) then I wait until I'm back to
normal size again, and now I have a bat (The flamingo) for the
croquet game.

South Of Duck Ponds:
I show the guard my invitation and waits until the guests are
starting to arrive, then I go South-West.

Croquet Green/Under The Bramble Hetch:
After Ive been listening to the rules, I open the canvas sack and
get the hedgehog out, put it down and hit the hedgehog with the
flamingo, since my hedgehog has rolled to the South East I follow
it and once again hit the hedgehog with the flamingo.
This time the hedgehog roles into a hole, in which I find the last
card the Ace of diamonds (15/434) I get the card (13/447) and
leaves the ground as fast as possible.

Tailors Cottage:
Now that I'm in possesion of "Suit of Diamods" (Meaning a
complete set of diamond playing cards, NOT clothes!) I can go
to the tailor, here I find the overall of the chef in which I find
the key to the pantry, my playing cards have now turned into a
beuatiful suit which I give to the tailor (16/463) The tailor now
leaves the house and now I can get the key from the chefs
overall, (5/468) and head for the Palace.

Eastern hall:
Since Im now up to stael the treacle cake I then lock the door to
the guards room with the red key, and thereby prevents them of
capturing me (4/472).

Palace Kitchens/Pantry:
I unlock the door to the pantry, enter the pantry, and take the
cake (8/480) Then I wait for the Jack of hearts to arrive, he
congratulates me and pushes me into the courtroom!
They acuse me for stealing the cake, and the list of jury members
is being presented, it is the cards of diamonds, in the order in
which I collected them (You must write down the order in which
they are being presented in). The long text is without importance.
The trial goes like this: One of the diamond cards charges me of
a certain thing, I then have to choose a card that overrules this
charge, if overruled both cards are out of the trial.
Remember the conversation between the griffin and the turtle!
You always have to choose the card you picked up before the one
card that is now charging you!

Here is an example:
This is how I picked up the cards: 6-2-7-Queen-4-9-8-10-Jack-3-5-King-Ace.
The first charge is brought up by the 7, so you have to select the
2 for defending you "Choose 2 of diamonds" (1/481)
The next charge is brought up by the 5 "Choose the 3 of diamonds" (2/483).
Now the Jack is charging you "choose the 10 of diamonds" (3/486).
Now the 9 is charging you "choose the 4 of diamonds" (4/490).
Now the King is charging you "Choose the 8 of diamonds" (5/495).
The last charge comes from the Ace "Choose the Queen of diamonds"
Now there is only 6 cards left and the trial can not continue, so
the case is dismissed and I go back to my sister Emily (6/501).

the gravity, friction, sky and water colours for your levels. Instead of
saving your level as FISHCAKE.WRM, save it as FISHCAKE.????.WRM (the 4
question marks being 4 numbers).
-The first number is gravity and can be between 1 and 5 (1=very low,
 3=normal 5=very high). Mars and alien levels have a gravity of 2.
-The second number is friction and can be between 1 and 5 (1=very low,

-The third and forth numbers are the sky and water colours and can be
 between and 9 - fans of green water can now have a matching green sky.

Go outside the ring and pick up the steel chair. Now hold down <FIRE> and
move around with your opponent and you should be able to wollop him with

the ring to win.

When you are about to go into a joystick waggling battle, follow these
steps:
A Pause the game.
B Plug the mouse into the joystick port you are using.
C Unpause the game, and move the mouse rapidly from side to side.
 (This will enable you to waggle quicker than your opponent)
D When your character has won the move, pause the game and plug the
 joystick back in.
Repeat this whenever you get into a grapple.

Place the chair outside the ring (next to the bottom left turn buckle)
just up a bit. Now jump into the ring and you should have the chair.

Climb up on to a corner post, and instead of jumping into the ring,
jump the other way. Weird gravity!

In the shop, buy the most expensive ship (white bug-shaped ship) and the
cheapest satellite (single orange coloured laser), then with the satellite,
click on the box that displays your current money level, and it will now
change to 500,000.

Insert the disk, and hold <BOTH MOUSE> until the title screen appears.
When youre in the shop hold down <HELP> and <DEL> for a few seconds, now
choose your ships as normal, but you have infinite energy.

To get more cash at the beginning of the game, select the smallest ship (the
one at the top), then the weediest laser (the orange one with single beam),
and place it on the shopkeepers nose. Hit <FIRE> to get the cash boost!

When you are confronted by the first end of level guardian shoot of the
bottom hooter (the one closest to the skull) then position yourself so that
you are not shooting the last hooter (the top one). Make sure you are only
shooting the bubbles that he fires at you. This should give you
approximately 20 credits per second. This takes ages, but if you are
persistent leave your room for an hour and come back.

In actual fact you can have twelve different ships. All you do is press <F1>
for the first ship fully decked with weapons. Pressing <F2> for the second
ship and so on. After a while you won't get any more ships because you will
run out of money.

The best ship that will last the longest is the last one with the bottom
three way laser, two non-moving satellites placed either side of the ship.
Then get the arc satellite, sprite bomb and bouncing bombs. It is also very
advisable in the later levels to get the shield.

Choose any of the 4 ships in the shop.
Click the ship as usual onto the blue print screen and then choose the
 invincible icon (the one below the laser - the one to the right of the
 orange spiked ball).
Now drag this icon to your ship and click it on and off the ship.
Your money increases by 500 units.
Drag the icon to the Alien Trash Can and trash it.
Carry on doing this to boost your money to your heart's content.

Get a high score and enter "ALF" for your name. Now you have unlimited lives.

If you manage to reach level 10, you're better off using your radar to kill
the xybots. Just line them up using radar and fire, you don't have to be
able to see them.

Keep as many keys with you as possible because some levels don't have
enough to complete them.

There are short cuts to level seven on levels one and four - you get extra
cash for using them.

If you have the extra energy upgrade try not to let your energy fall below
100m, because you lose the upgrade if it does.

Drums are not just decorations - hide behind them when possible and use
your zapper near to them to find more cannon power on level eight, near to
the top left hand transporter you can get to two white coins by blasting
away one of the three walls around them.

Don't split up in the two-player game, because it's easier to complete it
together.

The master xybot lives on level 11, and you'll need to stock up on double
shot and extra shot speed to stand a chance of survival.

Try to get one xybot to stand behind another - they'll blow each other

STARTING OUT TIPS, AND GOING TO SEATTLE:

Once again, it's up to you to save the world from a terrible fate -- rampant
stupidity! You, in this case, are Zak McKracken, ace reporter for the National
Inquisitor, the kind of tabloid you see around 7-11 check-out counters.
Eventually, you will gain allies in your quest, but for now I'm afraid that you
are on your own!

First, a few basic hints. Whenever you enter a new room, click on the command
"WHAT IS" and sweep over the objects in the room with your cursor. Anything
that does not register cannot be manipulated by you. Now, just because it
registers doesn't mean it's important, but nine times out of ten it's there for
a reason. Second, I cannot overemphasize the importance of reading the articles
in the newspaper that comes with the game. It is chock full of clues, and
should be consulted regularly. Remember that there is a twisted logic at work
here, and there is often more than one way of solving a problem. And save
often, of course!

When the game starts, you have just awakened from a strange dream in which
you saw a map. It occurs to you that you should make a copy of that map, so
that's one of your first priorities.

You awake in your bedroom, so check that out first. There's a dresser, a
desk, a lamp, a telephone, and an answering machine. OPEN the dresser, then
PICK UP the phone bill. READ the phone bill. Then cross to the desk, and open
it. PICK UP the kazoo. Next to the desk there's a piece of the wall that looks
different from the rest. PICK UP the loose piece of wallpaper. Now, if you look
under the desk, you will notice an object resting there. When you try to PICK
UP your CashCard, however, you push it further under the desk. No problem. USE
the phone bill with the CashCard and it's yours. READ the CashCard. Seems like
a lot of money? It won't last. The only other thing in your bedroom of
importance is the fishbowl, but you don't need that yet, so let's move into the
living room. (If you want to, you can TURN ON your answering machine. It is not
necessary to the solution, but otherwise you won't get messages from your
mother. The phone works, by the way, but I never found any numbers to call.)
WALK to the door and you'll be in the living room.

When you try to TURN ON the TV, you can't. There are two reasons why: First,
PICK UP the loose cushion. Aha! USE the plug with the power outlet on the wall.
But you still can't TURN ON the TV. If you do a "WHAT IS" on the TV, you will
notice an infrared sensor, so obviously you have to find the remote control. I
don't know about you, but whenever I can't find my remote control, I always
know where to look first. WALK to the couch and PICK UP the other cushion. Then
PICK UP the remote control you find underneath, WALK TO the TV, and USE the
remote control. Watch the TV to get more of an idea as to what's going on in
the world.

You might as well TURN OFF the TV and WALK TO the kitchen. Under the sink
you'll find a cabinet. OPEN the cabinet and PICK UP the box of crayons. USE the
yellow crayon with the piece of wallpaper, and you'll have a map! Then OPEN the
refrigerator and PICK UP the egg. PICK UP the small key by the side of your
door, OPEN the door, and go out.

When you get to the street level, go left to the French bakery. PUSH the
doorbell. When the man leaves, PUSH it again. Then, once again. PICK UP the
stale bread and WALK TO the door to the right of your stairs. OPEN the door and
go inside to TPC -- The Phone Company. Check out the representative and your
surroundings. They will become important later. For now, GIVE the phone bill to
the representative. Then PICK UP the application next to the counter (on the
far left), and USE the yellow crayon with the application. You can then go back
to your entryway, USE the small key with the mailbox, then USE the application
with the mailbox. CLOSE the mailbox. It's time to take a trip to Seattle to
cover a story about a two-headed squirrel!

Continue to your right to the corner, where you'll find a bus and a sleeping
driver. USE the kazoo, which will wake him. WALK to the CashCard reader, and
USE the CashCard in the reader. And it's off to the airport!

Oh no, one of those obnoxious shaven-headed devotees of some far-out Eastern
religion is trying to sell you a book! For once, give in. GIVE your CashCard to
the devotee. He will give you a book on enlightenment. Since you already have
your ticket, you can just WALK to the gate and the planes.

Now there are three things you need on the plane, and the stewardess will
stop you from getting them, so you have to distract her for a sufficiently long
period of time to allow you to do what you need to do. This section should
delight the practical joker in all of us!

WALK to the back of the plane, OPEN the door, and go into the toilet. CLOSE
the door. PICK UP the toilet paper, then USE the toilet paper with the sink.
TURN ON the faucet and PUSH the call button. OPEN the door and walk forward to
the front of the plane. (Ain't I a stinker?) On your way to the galley, PICK UP
the seat cushion from the seat in front of yours. You will notice something
fall out onto the floor when you do so. PICK UP the lighter. Then WALK to the
microwave oven in the galley. OPEN the microwave, USE the egg with the
microwave, CLOSE the microwave, and, finally, TURN ON the microwave. (This all
must be accomplished before the stewardess finishes cleaning up the head, so
you might want to save before you try it.) The resultant mess will gain the
stewardess's undivided attention for a while. As she is cleaning up after you,
OPEN all the overhead bins. In one, you will find an oxygen tank, which you can
PICK UP. While you're waiting to land, you can READ the book and the oxygen
tank for future reference.

When you land in Seattle, WALK to the outside door and into the woods. PICK
UP the tree branch overhead. GIVE the peanuts you received as a "meal" on the
plane to the two-headed squirrel, then USE the tree branch on the loose dirt.
(Alternately, you can USE the butter knife from your apartment on the squirrel
but this will haunt you later in the game.) WALK to the cave entrance.

Who turned out the lights? Well, TURN ON the lighter and use its glow to
check out the cave. Up and to your right is an abandoned bird's nest, and on
the floor is a fire pit. You can't reach the bird's nest yourself, so USE the
tree branch with the nest, USE the nest with the fire pit, then USE the branch
with the nest in the firepit, and USE the lighter on everything. And Lucasfilm
said "Let there be light!"

On the far right wall of the cave is a door with some strange markings (and
they won't be the last!) READ the strange markings, then USE your yellow crayon
on the markings. This one time, the game will complete the picture for you, and
the door will open. Go inside.

There is a machine holding a blue crystal, which you saw in your dream at the
beginning of the game. You need it, but it's locked in place. Fortunately, you
notice an infrared sensor on the machine that looks just like the one you've
got on your TV back home. Could it...nah! Well, might as well give it a shot.
USE the remote control. Presto!

Now, take the blue crystal. The lights will go out, but you should be able to
find your way back to the cave with no problems. From there, return to the
airport, and USE the reservation machine to buy a ticket back to San Francisco.
It's time to get some help in your quest!

ANNIE, MIAMI, NEPAL, AND ZAIRE:

You now have an artifact, and you need some advice. Remember the woman from
the Society for Ancient Wisdom you saw on TV? Why not go see her?

When you get back to the San Francisco airport, WALK to the door on your
right and you will find yourself back on the street corner by the bus. WALK up
to the top of the screen and 14th Avenue. For the time being, walk by the
pawnshop and continue to the second door. USE the blue crystal on the drop
slot. Annie will open the door, invite you inside, and show you a picture of
the machine you need to build in order to defeat the Aliens. Make a copy of
this diagram for future reference.

About this time, you will also notice that you can use the command SWITCH.
Try it out by switching to Annie and have her pick up the blotter on her desk,
and pick up the CashCard underneath. You won't need Annie's direct help for a
while, so switch back to Zak. You've got to get the other yellow crystal shard
that complements the one that Annie gave you, and it won't be easy, believe me.

WALK out of Annie's office and go back left to the pawnshop. There you will
BUY the following: the nose glasses, the hat, the tool box, the golf club, the
guitar, and the wet suit. Go outside and to the right to the large bobby pin
sign. OPEN the tool box, and USE the wire cutters on the sign. You have now
gone from malicious mischief on the plane to vandalism and petty theft! About
this time, you should have received a letter. Make your way back to your
apartment entrance and USE the small key on the mailbox. PICK up the letter
inside and read it. You are now a proud member of the King Fan Club. If the
letter hasn't arrived yet, wander around a bit until it does.

Go upstairs to your kitchen. USE the monkey wrench on the pipe below the
sink, then TURN ON the switch behind the faucet. This will activate your
garbage disposal. USE the stale French bread in the sink, and PICK UP the bread
crumbs you've made. Be sure to TURN OFF the disposal and USE the wrench on the
pipe again to fix things back to the way they were. (It might be fun at this
point to PICK UP the butter knife and go into your bedroom. PICK UP the loose
corner of carpet [lower right] and try to USE the butter knife in the loose
floor boards. No go, huh? Well, try the monkey wrench. Now, USE the rope on the
hole and you can climb down and check out the aliens' secret room!) Now go back
to the airport, and buy a ticket for Miami.

Miami is closed but there's a panhandler there whom you should take pity on.
GIVE him your cashcard, then GIVE him the book. He will read it, return it to
you, and also give you a bottle of whiskey. From Miami, fly to either London or
Cairo, and from there to Katmandu. (Whenever you leave the U.S.A., you will
have to use the right exit code as found in the sheet that accompanies the
game.) In Katmandu, go right to the fancy door and try to OPEN the door. GIVE
the book to the guard, and he will allow you inside to meet the Swami. (First
read the things on the bulletin board.) The Swami will tell you how to use the
blue crystal to trade minds with any animal, a talent that will come in useful
sooner or later! In fact, I'll bet you're dying to try it out right now, aren't
you? Go ahead! BUT SAVE FIRST!

USE the blue crystal on the Yak. Well, no one said it had to be exciting.
About now, your use of the blue crystal will have triggered something in that
secret room. Watch what the aliens do and pay particular attention to their
method of disguise. Return to your own body, and wait around until the alien
shows up. He will take you captive, bring you back to his headquarters, and
brainwash you, taking your crystals. For now, however, merely restore the game
to where you saved. Go to the left and check out the police station. There is a
flagpole out in front which you need, but stealing a flag is probably
considered treason in Nepal; so, you have to be fast or sneaky. Either way, you
have already saved the game at this point, so give it a shot. PICK UP the flag
pole, and WALK to the yak as fast as you can, then USE the CashCard in the yak.
If your timing is right, you'll get away scot free.

The alternative route is to USE the lighter on the hay bale to the right of
the temple. While everyone is busy putting out the fire, you can nonchalantly
saunter over to the police station and pillage it. If your conscience starts to
bother you, remember, it's for a very worthwhile cause.

From the airport, buy a ticket, and fly to Kinshasa, Zaire. After going
through several random jungle scenes, you will find yourself in a clearing. At
the far left in the clearing is a hut with a sign out front. Go inside, and you
will meet the Shaman who's in the picture with the Swami back in Nepal. GIVE
him the golf club. Out of gratitude, he and two of his countrymen will show you
a dance. TAKE NOTES! When the three men stop dancing and line up in a row,
write down the order in which they bob their heads. (This differs from game to
game.) The Shaman will tell you to return when you have the yellow crystal, so
it's time to head out again. Wend your way back through the jungle to the
airport, fly to Cairo, and from there back to Miami.

About now you should have severely depleted your CashCard. So before we head
home, let's try to get you some more money. In Miami, buy a ticket to the
Bermuda Triangle. Your plane will be caught by a mysterious beam, and you will
end up on a spaceship. The pilot will enter a four-note combination on the
coloured panels (this too varies from game to game), but when he invites you
back aboard the plane, stay over on the far right by the doorway. Once the
bright white glare disappears, push the button by the side of the door. You
will be captured and taken before the King of the Aliens. Before he can decide
what horrible fate worse than death should befall you, give the Fan Club Card
(or the guitar) to the King. This will make you the King's good friend, and one
of his minions will show you a different colour combination that will send you
home. Don't use it yet. Instead, return to the King's chamber, and WALK to the
right and READ the Lott-O-Dictor, which will give you tomorrow's winning
number. Then go back to the colour panel, press the right combination of
buttons, and stand on the platform to the left of the panel. You will be
teleported straight home. Go back to the pawnshop and BUY a Lottery ticket. (At
this point, you can also SELL your bent butter knife.) You can pick up your
earnings after your trip to Latin America.

PERU, MEXICO, AND MARS:

At SFO, buy a ticket for Lima, Peru. When you reach Lima, you will have to
wander through a few jungle screens until you reach a scenic overlook. If you
continue right past the ancient bird feeder, you'll see a huge carving. Now, if
only you had wings....

Go back to the bird feeder, and USE the bread crumbs on the feeder. This will
attract a sparrow. Save the game! USE the blue crystal on the sparrow. Use of
the blue crystal will alert the aliens to your location, and you want to avoid
capture. Now, depending on your game system, you will have to press a certain
key or button (on the Amiga, for example, you click the right mouse button) to
avoid watching the "cut" scene of the Alien putting on his disguise. Activate
this feature as soon as the scene begins. This will give you enough time to do
what you need to do.

In the bird's body, FLY to the giant carving and to its right eye. You will
see a candelabra and a platform. You can't do anything here right now, so fly
out and go to the left eye. PICK UP the scroll on the floor, and FLY back out
of the eye, across the valley, and back to Zak. GIVE the scroll to Zak, then
return to Zak's body. As quickly as possible, get back into the jungle. You
must accomplish this before the Alien arrives.

Return to the airport and fly to Mexico City. You'll have to go through yet
another jungle until you reach the Aztec pyramid. Pick any of the three
entrances and go inside. Now you're in a real maze, which you can map if you
want to, but it can be solved fairly easily by trial and error. In each room
there is at least one torch, which you will have to locate (with a "WHAT IS")
and then USE with the lighter. There are three types of corridors in the
pyramid: long ones with green faces on the walls, medium ones with blue faces,
and short ones with no faces. You will enter a long corridor; try each exit
from it until you locate a medium corridor; from there, try to find which of
the several doors leads to a short corridor. One of the short corridor rooms
has a door which leads into a room with a statue holding a shard of yellow
crystal, and on the base of the statue are some strange yellow markings.
Unfortunately, here you must draw the correct figure yourself, and you don't
know what it is. I would recommend that you save the game at this point, and
prepare to meet the rest of our intrepid crew.

SWITCH to either Melissa or Leslie, who are standing by their converted VW
Microbus in the Martian desert, just waiting for something to do. Have the
co-ed you switched to OPEN the van door and go inside. OPEN the glove
compartment. PICK UP the boom box, the CashCards, the fuse, and the digital
audio tape from the radio. USE the oxygen valve if you like. Leave the van, and
make sure each girl has the correct CashCard. WALK to the left, past the alien
hostel, and to the black monolith. USE the CashCard in the slot, and then do it
again so you get two tokens. Now switch to the other girl, and have her do the
same, so that each co-ed has two tokens.

Bring them both inside the hostel. USE the token on the metal plate to the
right of the airlock door, and PICK UP the burnt-out fuse. Then, USE the fuse
from your van in the air lock fuse box, and PUSH the button, closing the door.
Next, PUSH the button by the door on the right wall, and send Leslie into the
dormitory. (Melissa is a little too squeamish.) Check out the locker by the
door and PICK UP the little strip of yellow vinyl tape. OPEN the right side of
the cabinet, and PICK UP the flashlight. Move to the right and PICK UP the
covers, revealing a dead alien shaped like a broom. Finally, PICK UP the ladder
in the far right corner, and leave.

WALK both the girls to the right (past the van) to the Giant Face and a door
that has three buttons on it. Set up the ladder under the highest button, and
send one co-ed up the ladder, while parking the other by the lowest. Now press
the buttons in the order indicated by the dancing natives in Zaire. This will
open the door. Take both girls inside.

Inside you will find two huge statues and three massive doors. On one of the
statues will be strange yellow markings. READ the markings and copy the symbol
down (they change from game to game). This is the symbol Zak needs to draw on
the Mexican statue's base to get the yellow crystal shard. But first there are
some other matters to take care of in the Great Chamber. Your oxygen will not
last forever, and it might be nice to see the girls' faces. Let's find the air
conditioning unit.

WALK to the massive door on the left. USE the ladder by the pedestal, and
WALK to the crystal globe. Have the other girl USE the vinyl tape with the
digital audio tape (DAT), allowing you to record over it. USE the DAT in the
boom box, TURN ON the boom box, and set it to Record. SWITCH to the girl on the
ladder and PICK UP the globe. There will be an annoying whine and the door will
open. Send LESLIE with the flashlight into the chamber.

You find yourself in a maze of coloured doors. You can map this maze if you
like, but the quick and dirty way is to go through the purple door, then the
blue door, then the purple. You should find yourself in a room with a machine.
READ the gauges on the machine, then PUSH both switches. Once both gauges move
into the green, you will be able to remove your helmets inside the whole Great
Chamber.

Exit the machine room and go through the blue door. From there, take the
purple door, another purple door, and finally the door with the red edges on
your far right. There you will find a room with a familiar map, a
representation of the Sphinx, and more strange markings which you should copy
down. To find your way to the exit, go out and take the yellow door, then the
blue door, the red door on the far left, the red door on the far right, the red
door on the far right, and the red doorway on the far left.

Next move to the middle of the three massive doors. The crystal globe here is
broken, so you have to USE the boom box in Play mode, which will produce the
sound you need to open the door. This is not a maze, thankfully. All you need
to do is go through the doorway over on the right Inside you will see a close
relative of the statue in Mexico, holding an ankh. PICK UP the ankh.

Finally, you can open the massive door on the far right by either method, and
once you enter and go through the door in that chamber, you will find a force
field, which you turn off when you USE the ankh in the panel. PUSH the button
on the strange machine and you will see what I assume is a hologram of the
ancient aliens who prepared all this for you. PICK UP the smaller key on the
wall (the larger one will crumble into dust). At this point, it's time to leave
Mars, and go back to Zak.

Save the game here, just in case you make a mistake. USE the yellow crayon on
the strange markings. By placing the cursor on the screen where you want to
draw a line, you can recreate the drawing the co-eds found on the huge statue.
When it's done, click on FINISHED DRAWING. The statue will release the crystal
shard and you can take it. Find your way out of the pyramid, return to the
airport, and from there to San Francisco. It's time to pick up Annie and finish
this game!

LONDON, ZAIRE (AGAIN), CAIRO, MARS (AGAIN), AND ENDGAME:

Once back in San Francisco, go home and get your fish, Sushi, and his
transparent domicile. USE the fishbowl with the sink to give Sushi a temporary
home, and then leave. On your way to Annie's office, be sure to visit the pawn
shop and pick up your lottery winnings. Would that real life were as full of
such sure things!

GIVE the scroll to Annie (who is the only one who can read it). Then both of
you should walk down to catch the bus (remember only Zak can wake the driver),
and you both should go to the airport and buy tickets for London. Zak should
GIVE the bottle of whiskey to Annie, who should, in turn, GIVE it to the sentry
by the electric gate outside of Stonehenge. He will get drunk and pass out,
enabling Annie to TURN OFF the switch that controls the electrified fence. Zak
can USE the wire cutters on the fence, and both can WALK to Stonehenge. Zak
should USE the yellow crystal shards on the altar, then USE the flag pole on
the little notch on the left. SWITCH to Annie, who can READ the scroll again
and produce the desired effect. Have ZAK pick up the yellow crystal (now fused
whole), and send both back to the airport.

Both Zak and Annie should fly to Cairo, but send Zak on from there to Zaire,
and have him visit the Shaman once again. The Shaman will explain to Zak how to
use the yellow crystal for teleportation purposes. Zak should then rejoin Annie
in Cairo.

On one of the two legs of the Sphinx will be some more of those ubiquitous
yellow markings. Zak must recreate the drawing seen in the chamber on Mars
below the depiction of the Sphinx, which will open a secret door. Both Annie
and Zak must go inside. Yep, it's another maze, but (a) it's lighted, and (b)
there's an easy solution. Always go through the doorway with a picture of the
sun over it (or in one case, the doorway is at the end of a corridor, and the
sun is above and to the right). Eventually you will find a door with what looks
like a pair of horns above it. Inside you will find some hieroglyphics which
only Annie can read. They will instruct her to push the left button, then the
right button, and the centre button. (One of the hieroglyphics looks
suspiciously like an Imperial fighter from Star Wars, by the way.) Once the
panel opens, Zak should USE his yellow crayon on his wallpaper map, and you
should write down the last set of strange markings (whew) by the depiction of
the Great Face.

Retrace your steps out of the Sphinx. At this point, Zak should go to the big
pyramid across the street, and enter the tiny little door on the left side.
With lighter in hand, he will be able to find the doorway to the right, find
the torch on the way inside that room, and light it. Bring Annie to join him in
the room with the sarcophagus, then send Zak only back to the airport, and fly
him to Miami.

In Miami, buy another ticket to the Bermuda Triangle, and before the beam can
get you, USE the parachute. The cushion you stole from the first airplane will
keep you afloat. USE the kazoo, which will summon a dolphin. Save the game
here, and USE the blue crystal on the dolphin. As the dolphin, SWIM underwater
and to the lower right to a clump of seaweed. PICK UP the seaweed, then PICK UP
the glowing object behind it. Return to the surface, GIVE the glowing object to
Zak, and return Zak to his own body. Immediately, USE the yellow crystal. The
maps you have drawn will appear, and you can use the cursor to pick where on
the map you want to go. Click on the yellow dot in South America, and you will
be teleported to the room in the huge carving's right eye where the candelabra
was. PICK UP the candelabra and get ready to teleport to the secret chamber
inside the Martian pyramid. USE the yellow crystal and click on the pyramid.
Oops. Nothing happened.

Well, you have to get to Mars anyway, so USE the yellow crystal again and
click on the Great Face. You will be teleported into a chamber with three doors
and, yes: more strange yellow markings! USE your yellow crayon to recreate the
figure you saw in the map room inside the Sphinx, and all three doors will
open. Go through the centre door, and you find yourself in the maze of coloured
doors. TURN ON your lighter, go through the green door on the far left, and the
yellow door on the far left of the second room; go all the way to the left, and
you'll be in the Great Chamber. Zak can meet up with Melissa and Leslie at long
last.

No time for chitchat, though. Have Leslie put her helmet back on and WALK to
the big pile of sand in front on the hostel. USE the broom alien on the sand,
to reveal solar panels, then send her over to stand by the tram. Next, PUT ON
Melissa's helmet, and send her over to the the tram. Finally, you have to send
Zak outside, but he needs a spacesuit. PUT ON the wet suit, the oxygen tank and
the fishbowl, then USE the duct tape on the fishbowl. Perfect! Send Zak to the
shuttlebug where he can use the oxygen valve to freshen his tank and bring it
up the full 15 minutes; then, send him to the monolith, and have him USE his
CashCard in the slot. He needs only one token. Zak should then join the others
by the tram. Save the game here!

Have each of the three USE the token in the tram. All three must get on board
before it leaves, or you can't finish the game. The tram will go to the Martian
pyramid, and let everyone off. Send Leslie to the pyramid, and USE the broom
alien on the sand pile. Send Zak there, and USE the bobby pin sign. Then give
Zak the flashlight, and have him enter the pyramid. It is a duplicate of the
Egyptian pyramid, except for the sarcophagus.

This one can be manipulated. Bring both co-eds into the chamber, and have one
PUSH the sarcophagus's feet. This will open a secret door to the left of the
sarcophagus. Send the second girl up the stairs, have her stand by the button,
and send Zak up there. (You may have to move the girl away from the
sarcophagus's feet to close the hole in the door.) PUSH the button, quickly
SWITCH to Zak, and PICK UP the white crystal. Zak should USE the yellow crystal
to teleport to the dot on the map near Cairo.

(While not necessary, it is fun to send Melissa and Leslie back on the tram,
have them pick up their fuse in the hostel fuse box, replace it in the van, and
then USE the controls to head home.)

Zak is now in a secret room with a big base, two switches and a lever. First,
PULL the lever, which opens a secret set of stairs. SWITCH to Annie, who has
been waiting patiently below, and have her come up the stairs. PULL the lever
again to close the panel in the floor. Have Zak USE the glowing object on the
base, USE the candelabra on the glowing object, and USE each of the three
crystals in their proper position as shown in your dream and the diagram in
Annie's office. (Oh no, you forgot what order to put them in? You dunderhead,
now you'll have to start from the beginning! Just kidding.... Actually, the
program automatically puts each in the right position.) When the machine is
finished, have Zak and Annie each pull a switch in turn. Then sit back and
enjoy your victory and the amusing epilogue. It's Miller time!

If you have seen Dawn Of The Dead, you already have a good idea on how to
solve most of the puzzles. But here's some extra tips anyway:
1) To lock up the mall to keep zombies from getting in, you need to park
the trucks over the entrances. Get the key from the office on the 2nd floor
and go to the 4th floor where the keys to the trucks are kept.
2) To keep the dead zombies from coming to un-life, lock them up in the
freezer in the basement.
3) before you can go play in the basement, you need a source of light. Get
the fuses and gloves from the 3rd floor and go to it!!

Solution:
First get Alex to drop the helicopter keys by the heicopter, there's no
point in carrying them around with you and it will enable you to carry one
more usefull object.

Choose one of the characters and go down to the security room on the secon
floor, pick up the set of keys and make your way to the list, don't bother
getting any weapons and don't stop to kill any zombies.

Use the keys and now you will be able to go up to the fourth floor ( drop
the keys in the lift, you don't need them anymore ). Leave the lift and yo
will now be in the main control room, and here you will find three differe
keys on the floor, each one of the three will start one of the lorries,
enabling you to move them.

Via the lift now make your way back down to first floor and go to each of
the lorries and using the keys move them infront of the various entrances
to the shopping centre. The only problem is now that your character will
not be able to get back inside. Choose another one of characters and send
them down to the sports shop on the third floor, get the rope, and then go
to the balcony above the front entrance on level two, use the rope and you
other character will climb up and onto the balcony away from danger.
Get one of your characters to get the fuse, the rubber glove and a gun, an
make another character to get the torch, take them in the lift to the
basement and get the person with the torch to use it so when you exit the
lift you'll be able to see where you are.

Both go round to the fusebox and after you've disposed of any zombies get
the character with the rubber glove to use it and insert the fuse into the
fuse box. Now using yet another character go to the forth floor and press
the buttons on the computer to activate the lights in the basement.
This is where operation zombi kill starts. Get one of the characters to go
round each of the levels destroying all zombies he meets and then stick
all the zombies in the cold store (if you use the tape from the video sho
with the TV and video in the rental shop you'll see that you have to shoot
the zombies in the head to kill them). If you now go down to the main
entrance you will see that some thugs have moved the lorry and have made
their way inside.

Getting the fuel can (level three), a gun (level two), and the hose pipe
(level one) go outside and go to the right. Soon you will come across a
van belonging to the thugs, shoot any thugs that are by the van, and then
drop the fuel can in front of it. Now use the hose pipe and, viola!
You now have the precious fuel you need to fly away in the helicopter.
Get everybody inside the helicopter and start it up with key (remember whe
you left it) and the game is completed.

You may not go through this in exactly the way it's written
because of the thief. He is a variable item in the game; you
never know where he will show up. Try to move out of the
room he's in as soon as he shows up. But keep in mind that even
if he does steal anything from you, you will get it all back from
him in the end.
You begin West of the house, and your first chore is to get inside. So,
go South and East. Open the window and enter the house (you're in
the kitchen), then go West into the living room. Get the lamp,
then move the rug, revealing the trap door. Open the trap door,
turn on the lamp, and go down. At this point, some mysterious
person will shut the door on you; don't worry about that for
now. Okay, so here you are in the cellar. It's time to pick up
your first treasure, so go South, then East to the Gallery. Get
the painting, then continue North to the Studio. Go up the
chimney (you can only fit with the lamp and the painting), and
you will be in the kitchen again. Now, go upstairs to the attic,
and get the knife and rope. Come back down and go into the
living room. Open the case and put the painting inside. Then,
drop the knife and get the sword. Open the trap door again, and
return to the cellar. Again, the door is shut by someone (you
never will find out who's doing this, but it doesn't matter).
Now you're back in the cellar, and since we're coming to one of
the more dangerous parts of the game, you might want to do a save
here. Gripping your trusty sword, head North into the Troll room.
There's a nasty troll here with a bloody axe, and the only way
past is to kill him. So, do just that: "Kill Troll With Sword."
It will most likely take more than one attempt, so keep at it,
and eventually he will disappear in a cloud of black smoke. Now,
drop the sword, because you really don't need it any more, and it
will hinder you in carrying other, more important items. Having
dispatched the troll, you move along East, East (into the Round
room), then SE and East. You are now in the Dome room. It's a
long way down, and too far to jump, so here's where the rope
comes in handy. Tie the rope to the railing, then climb down the
rope. You will be in the Torch room. Leave the torch for now;
you'll be coming back this way again later. From the Torch room,
go South, then East and get the coffin. Return West, then
continue South to the Altar. There's no way you're going to get
down that hole with the coffin, and even the program will tell
you that you haven't got a prayer. That's a hint, folks: Just
"Pray," and you will find yourself in the forest again. Since
it's daylight out, save energy and turn off the lamp. Now, head
along South, then North (I know, but it works!) to the clearing,
then East to the Canyon View. Climb all the way down to the
bottom, then go North to Rainbow's End. Drop the coffin and open
it. Inside is a jeweled sceptre. Get that, and wave it. The
rainbow will become solid (you'll need to cross over from the
other side later). Now, "Look." You should see a pot of gold.
Get that, and the coffin. After that, go SW, then all the way
back up to Canyon View. From there, it's NW to the clearing, and
then West to the window. Once in the kitchen, open the bag and
get the garlic (nothing else, just the garlic). Go on into the
living room, and put your treasures in the case. Now, sit down
and take a breather, because you're about to do a lot of
traveling!

Once again, open the trap door, turn on the lamp, and go down.
Watch carefully, and you will notice that this time, the door
doesn't close! Whoever was doing it before must have gotten
tired. Anyway, you're on your way to the dam, so move along
North, East, North, NE, and East. You are now on top of the dam.
From there, go North to the Lobby. Pick up the matches, then go
either North or East (doesn't matter) into the Maintenance room.
Get the wrench and the screwdriver, then push the yellow button.
Now, return to the dam, and you will see that the green bubble is
lit. Turn the bolt with the wrench, then drop the wrench. You
have opened the dam, and you will be coming back this way again
to reap the fruits of your labors. However, right now, you're on
your way to Hades, so let's get going! Go South, then down into
the Loud room. Leave the platinum bar for now; you'll get it
later. Head West into the Round room, then SE and East (hmmmm,
haven't you been here before?). Again, climb down the rope. This
time, get the torch. At this point, you can turn off your lamp;
the torch will provide light so long as you have it. Now,
continue straight South, getting the bell, then the book and
candles from the altar. Go down the hole to the cave, then down
again to the entrance to Hades. Your candles will have blown out
by this time, but don't worry about it. Okay, here's where you
have to be careful. First, ring the bell. It will become red hot
and you will drop it. You will also drop the candles. Stay
calm, and do the following, all in one command: Get the candles,
light match, light candles with match (necessary, because of the
torch, and *DON'T* use the torch, or you'll vaporize the
candles!). Okay, strange things happened when you lit the
candles, now read the book. Whew! The demons have been
exorcised! Drop the book, then go South and get the crystal
skull. Now, back North, then up to the cave, then North to the
Mirror room. By the way, better put out the candles. Rub the
mirror, and you will now be in another Mirror room (this one is
North of the dam, as the other one is South). Now, go North,
then West, then North, then West into the Squeaky room (well, I
told you you'd be doing a lot of traveling this time!). Make
sure you have the garlic with you, then go North into the Bat
room. So long as you have the garlic, he won't bother you. There
is a jade figurine here, but leave it for now. You'll pick it up
on your way out.

Go East to the Shaft room. Put the torch into the basket, then
turn on your lamp and head North to the Smelly room, then down to
the Gas Room (best not to carry any open flames here!). Now, you
are about to enter a small maze, so follow these directions
*CAREFULLY*! East, Northeast, Southeast, Southwest, down, and you
should be at the top of the ladder (if you aren't, may God have
mercy on your soul!). From there, go down to the Ladder Bottom,
and then South to the Dead End for the coal. Get that, then
return to the ladder top. From there, go up, North, East, South,
North, and you will be back in the Gas room. Go up, then South
to the Shaft room again. Put the coal in the basket, and lower
the basket. Now, guess what? You have to go back through the
coal mine again! So, make your way to the Ladder Bottom, but this
time, go West to the Timber room. Ignore the broken timber (not
useful for anything), and drop all but the screwdriver. Now, you
can squeeze through the crack to the West. And here you are in
the Drafty Room, which is also at the bottom of the shaft.
There's the basket, so get the coal and the torch, and move South
into the Machine room. Open the lid, put the coal in the
machine, close the lid, and turn the switch with the screwdriver.
Drop the screwdriver, open the lid, and get the diamond (well, no
one ever said Zork was an *EASY* game!). Now, go back North, and
put the torch and the diamond in the basket. Squeeze back East
into the Timber room. Get the skull, lamp, and garlic. You
won't be needing the matches and the candles any more, so you can
leave them. (They were insurance in case the thief came along
and stole the torch before you could get the diamond). Now, head
East again to the Ladder Bottom, and from there up and through
the coal mine (you know the way now!), to the Gas room. Pick up
the bracelet, then continue on up and South to the Shaft room.
Get the torch and the diamond from the basket, turn off the lamp,
then go West into the Bat room. Get the jade, then go South,
East, South to the Slide room. Now, here's a fast way back to
the cellar: Just go down the slide! Wheeeee! Then it's up to
the living room (remember, the trap door is open now), and all
the treasures go into the case. Huff! Puff! Bet you didn't
know you'd be doing *THIS* much running around! But, don't get
too relaxed, there's still plenty more to come.

Turn on the lamp, and return to the cellar. From there, it's
North (ah, deja vu!), then East, North, NE to Reservoir South.
Now that the sluice gates are open, you can head North, picking
up the trunk of jewels, North again to Reservoir North, getting
the air pump, and North one more time, getting the crystal
trident. After that, go all the way back South again to
Reservoir South, then East to the dam, and then East once more to
the Dam Base. Here you find a little pile of folded plastic;
guess what it is? Right, it's an inflatable boat! So, inflate
it with the pump, then drop the pump, then get inside the boat,
say "Launch," and you're floating off along the Frigid River.
Now, just keep waiting until you see the buoy. Get that, then
"East" to the beach. Get out of the boat, then get the shovel
and move on to the Sandy Cave to the NE. You might want to save
the game at this point, since you have to dig here until the
scarab turns up, and I'm sure you don't want to get buried alive
(it's been known to happen!). Okay, drop the shovel and get the
scarab, then go back SW. Drop the buoy and open it; inside is an
emerald. Get that, then continue South to the Aragain Falls.
Here you can cross the rainbow (so do that!), which brings you to
the End of The Rainbow. Turn off the lamp, then go SW to the
Canyon Bottom. From there, make your way back to the living
room, and put all the treasures in the case. Your collection is
quite impressive by now, but you aren't finished yet. Go East
twice, then North twice. Climb up the tree and get the egg.
Climb down again, and go South, East, and back to the living
room. However, this time, you don't put the treasure in the
case. Turn on the lamp, and go down (once again!) into the
cellar, and North to the Troll room. Now, you are about to enter
a maze, so follow the directions very carefully! West (this
brings you into the maze), South, East, up, and you find several
items here. Take only the coins and the key, and be careful not
to touch the skeleton! From here, go SW, East, South, SE, and
you will be in the Cyclops room. The Cyclops is not friendly,
but you can deal with him effortlessly: Just type in "Ulysses"
(or "Odysseus," if you prefer). Old One-Eye will tear out of
there right through the wall! In fact, he will create a passage
eastward from that room right into the living room! However, you
don't want to go that way yet! Instead, go upstairs, and you
will be in the Treasure Room, the thief's secret lair. Now, give
him the egg, and go back downstairs, then East to the living
room. Deposit the coins in the case, then get the knife (the
thief needs a little time to open the egg). Okay, go back West
to the Cyclops room. Again, at this point, saving is
recommended; the thief will not be easy to kill! So, head
upstairs and use the nasty knife to kill the thief. Once he's
dead, all treasures in the room will be visible. This includes
the egg, a silver chalice, and anything he may have stolen from
you before. Get everything, then follow these directions: Down,
NW, South, West, up, down, NE, and you will be in the Grating
Room. Unlock and open the grate (watch out for falling leaves!),
then go up. You will be in a clearing. From there, go South and
climb the tree again. Wind up the canary that's inside the egg.
A songbird will come by and drop a bauble for you. Climb down
again and get the bauble, then return to the living room. Put
all the treasures in the case, making sure you *REMOVE THE
CANARY* from the egg and put it in the case separately! You're
almost finished! Just one more trip to make! Now, for the last
time, enter the cellar and go North. From the Troll Room, go
East until you come again to the Loud Room. Type in: "Echo," and
you will now be able to get the bar. So, grab it and return to
the living room. Once you place it in the case, you will get a
message. Follow the advice of that message, and you will get a
map. Take that, and return to the place where this all started,
the mailbox West of the house. You should have no trouble getting
to the barrow from there. Of course, once you enter the
barrow.... You didn't really think it would end there, did you?
Not when there's still Zork II and Zork III waiting for you up
ahead! Ah, but it's too late; you can't turn back now! You'll
just have to grit your teeth and follow through to the end (with
a little help, of course).

@remark S
The Wizard of Frobozz is a lot more troublesome than the thief ever
was. This is due to his spell-casting abilities. Therefore, frequent
saving of the game is recommended! Otherwise, you will be wasting a
lot of time waiting for some spells to wear off.
Get the sword and lamp, and move along South, South, South, SW to the
Shallow Ford. At this point, turn on your lamp, then continue
South, SE to the North End of Garden. Enter the Gazebo, and get
all items on the table. Then "Exit Gazebo," and go N, NE to the
Shallow Ford and fill the teapot with water. Now, head South, SW,
SW, and you will be in the Carousel Room. This is a wonderful
place that spins you around, so you can't be sure that you're
going in the direction you specify. Fun, huh? The thing to do
here is keep moving around until you get to the Riddle Room.
That room is actually SE of the Carousel Room, but you aren't
likely to get there by typing SE, at least not for a while. So,
every time you move, and find yourself somewhere else besides the
Riddle Room, you will have to return to the Carousel Room and try
again. Also, before you start moving around, drop everything but
the teapot and the lamp; you'll pick up the things again as you
need them. These are the directions from the various other rooms
to the Carousel Room: Marble Hall - South Path Near Stream -
Southwest Topiary - West Menhir Room - North Cobwebby Corridor -
Northeast Cool Room - Southeast All right, you've finally made it
to the Riddle Room. Now, all you have to do is answer the
riddle! Actually, it's a fairly simple riddle; just enter: Say
"A Well," and you will be able to move on to the East, which is
the Pearl Room. Leave the necklace for now, and continue East
into the Circular Room. There is a large bucket here, just big
enough for you to enter, so do that. Then pour water into the
bucket, and it will rise to the top of the well. Get out of the
bucket, then go East into the Tea Room, and get all cakes except
the orange one. Eat the green cake, and you will shrink down.
Now, go East into the Pool Room, and throw the red cake into the
pool of tears. The water will be soaked up, and you can get the
package of candies. Forget about the flask; there is no use for
it. Return West to the Posts Room, and eat the blue cake.
Presto! You are returned to normal size. Stretch a little, then
head NW into the Low Room. Aha, there's a robot here. Tell the
robot to "Go E," then go that way yourself, and you will both be
in the Machine Room. I wouldn't be surprised if the controls to
the Carousel room were here! Tell the robot to "Push Triangular."
There will be a thud in the distance (something fell), and the
Carousel Room is now off. Tell the robot to go South, and do
likewise. You are now in a Dingy Closet, and a red sphere sits
invitingly just beyond your grasp. Try getting it, and a steel
cage will come down over you (uh oh!). Not to worry, however!
Once the cage is down, just tell the robot (even though you can't
see him) to "Lift Cage." Once that's done, you will be able to
get the sphere.

Now, getting back to the bucket may be a problem of sorts;
pushing the button has caused strange things to happen in the Low
Room. So, after going North and West from the closet into the
Low Room, you may have a problem when trying to go SE back to the
Tea Room. Keep trying however, and you'll get there sooner or
later. Then, go West from the Tea Room, enter the bucket, get
the water, and the bucket will descend again. Get out, drop the
Teapot, head West, pick up the necklace, then West again and NW
to the Carousel Room. There is a box here (the thud you heard
before). Open it, and inside is a violin. You don't need to
take it now, so just leave it here for the time being. Drop the
sphere, necklace and candy, then get the sword, place mat and
letter opener. Move North to the Marble Hall, picking up the
brick, then continue North until you come to the Ledge in Ravine.
Go up to the Tiny Room, which has a locked door. Slide the mat
under the door, then move the lid and insert the opener in the
keyhole. Remove the opener, then pull the mat and get the key.
Now, unlock and open the door and go North into the Dreary Room.
Drop the key and opener, and get the blue sphere. Now, it's South
and Down to the ledge, then West and North into the Dragon Room
(what would an adventure game be without a dragon?). He's not
one of your nicer dragons, so be careful here. Hit him with the
sword, then move South. He will follow you. Hit him a second
time, and move South again. He's still following you, and you're
almost where you want to be. Whack the scaly nuisance one more
time, and head West into the Ice Room. Okay, the dragon follows
you in, gets silly over his reflection in the glacier, and
proceeds to get himself drowned. You can drop the sword now,
since you won't be needing it anymore. As his body washes away,
go East and SE to the Carousel Room, then SW to the Cobwebby
Room. Get the string, then go back NE and pick up the newspaper
and the matches. Now move along NW, West, and West again into
the Lava Room. Leave the ruby for now, and continue on Southward
to the Volcano Bottom. Aha, look what's here....a hot air
balloon! All you need is a way to get it inflated, and you just
happen to have the means to do that. Get into the basket, then
open the receptacle and put the newspaper inside. Light a match,
then light the newspaper with the match. Make sure you keep the
receptacle open! Now, just wait until the balloon rises to the
Narrow Ledge, then "Land." Tie the wire to the hook and get out
of the basket. On the ledge is a gold coin. Pick that up and head
South into the Library. Get the purple book, open it, get the
stamp, then drop the book. You can ignore the other books; they
are all worthless. Now, back North and into the basket again.
Untie the wire, and wait until the balloon rises to the Wide
Ledge. Again, "Land" and tie the wire to the hook. Get out and
go South. Now, it's time for a few thrills. Put the string in
the brick, then put the brick in the hole in the box. Now light
a match, then light the string. Now, head North *IMMEDIATELY*.
There will be an explosion, then you can safely go back and get
the crown. But don't dawdle; once you have it, get back to the
basket pronto! The explosion weakened the ledge, and it won't
hold much longer. So, get in, untie the wire, close the
receptacle, and wait until the balloon lands at the Volcano
Bottom. Well, you seem to be doing almost as much travelling
around as in Zork I, and you aren't finished yet, not by a long
shot! Go North, get the ruby, then East twice and SE to (yet
again!) the Carousel Room. Drop off everything but the lamp,
then go NW, North, North, West, and West again, and you should
now be at the entrance to the bank.

The bank is tricky, so follow directions carefully here. Go NE,
then East into the Safety Depository, then South into the office
and pick up the portrait, and back North again. Now, "Enter
Light," and you will be in a small room. At this point "Enter
South Wall," and you will be in the Depository again. "Enter
Light" a second time, and you will find yourself in the vault,
with a pile of bills in front of you. Get the bills, then "Enter
North Wall," and once more you are in the Depository. Now, drop
the bills and portrait, and go East to the East Tellers Room. Go
East again to the Depository, pick up the goodies, and "Enter
Light." This time, you are in the East Viewing Room. From there,
go South and you will be at the bank entrance. You have robbed
the bank, and kept the alarms silent. Okay, head along East until
you reach the Dragon Room, then North to the Dragon's Lair. Leave
the chest for now; instead, say "Hello Princess," and wait until
she leaves. Follow her, and continue to follow her until you are
both in the Gazebo, then wait. The unicorn will appear, and the
princess will give you the key from around its neck, and also a
rose. You can drop the rose; it has no use in the game. Well,
you're getting closer to the end-game, but there are still a few
things left to do. Exit the Gazebo, then move South, West, SW.
Drop off some of the treasures, then go back NW, North, North,
North to the Lair again. Open the chest and get the statuette,
then return to the Carousel Room. From there, due South to the
stairway. This is a good place to save the game, as you are
about to enter one of the nastier mazes around. Go down the
stairs, and you will be in the Oddly-Angled Room. Things are not
always as they seem here, and the exact direction to go at this
point is not constant. Try East first, and if you can't go that
way, then try West. Either way, you should find a club. Get the
club, and from that point, go SE, NE, NW, SW. Watch the room
descriptions carefully as you do this; the little diamonds on
the floor should get brighter with each move you make (you are
actually "running the bases" here). If they are not doing this,
restore the game and try again. When you have done it
successfully, there will be a noise in the distance. Now, you
should try to go either North or South (that varies also). If
one way doesn't work, try the other, and if neither works, try
East or West. There will be a staircase going down, but you
don't want to do that yet, so go Up instead, and head North until
you are back in the Carousel Room. Get the blue and red spheres
and the candy. Drop a few things if you have to, but hang on to
the club! Now, SW twice, and you are in the Guarded Room, with a
lizard head in the doorway. Give the candy to the lizard, then
unlock the door with the gold key. Open the door and go South,
then West twice into the Aquarium. Throw the club at the
aquarium, then get the clear sphere. Go East into the Wizard's
Workroom. Put each sphere on the stand of the same color, then
get the black sphere that appears, and go South into the
Pentagram Room. Put the sphere on the circle, and the Demon will
appear. You must give him *ALL* the treasures you have
collected, as well as the gold key. This will mean at least one
more trip to and from the Carousel Room to get all the stuff.
When you have given everything to the demon, tell the demon,
"Give Me The Wand," and he will take the wand from the Wizard and
give it to you. Now, you're almost finished! Go North, East,
North, North, NE, South, and you are in the Menhir Room. You
need to get the Menhir out of the way for a little while, so do
this: Wave the wand at the Menhir and say, "Float." The Menhir
will rise up, allowing you to go SW into the kennel and get the
collar. After that, go NE, then South, then Down, and Down again
into the Cerberus Room. Cerberus is no problem; just put the
collar on him. Now, go East, then South, and you are in the
Crypt. Turn off the lamp, and you will notice a secret door in
the south wall. Open the door and go South, and you will be on
the Landing.

Well, you've come a long way since you first stood by the
mailbox outside the house in the forest. You've defeated the
thief, outwitted the Wizard of Frobozz, and now, you stand at the
foot of the endless stairs, ready to embark on the final part of
your journey. So, pick up the lamp, turn it on, and head along
due South until you come to the shore of the lake. Drop the lamp
<say goodbye to it; you won't be seeing it again>, and jump into
the lake. Brrrr!!! Pretty cold! So, don't stay in there long;
swim west and then go South into the Scenic Vista. Kind of a
strange place, with changing numbers on the wall and a bare
table...not quite all that scenic, eh? Well, get the torch, and
wait for the number to change to "II." Then, touch the table. My
oh my! You're in a room from Zork II....Room 8, as a matter of
fact. However, you don't have much time to sight-see, so get the
can of Grue repellant, then try moving East, and you will find
yourself back in Scenic Vista again. Now wait for the number to
change to "III," then touch the table again. This time, you're
in a Damp Passage. Drop the torch, and just wait there until
you're pulled back to Scenic Vista. Okay, you're finished here,
so move along North to the shore, and again jump in the lake.
Splash! It hasn't gotten any warmer; in fact, you just dropped
the can of repellant. So, go Down, and you will be on the lake
bottom. Ah, there it is! But, could there be something else
there, too? "Get all," and you will have not only the repellant
but also an amulet. This is one of those "wonderful" variable
things; it may take more than one try on your part to get both
items. In the meantime, you can't stay in the icy waters too
long, and sooner or later a hungry fish will come looking for
you. Therefore, it's best to save the game before you jump in
from the Western Shore. So if you die in the water, or get eaten
by the fish, or picked up by the Roc <while you're swimming on
the surface>, you don't have to start all the way back at the
beginning. By the way, this is the only one of the Zorks where
you don't lose points if you die. But, all the items you've
collected so far get scattered all around, and it's
time-consuming to go look for them. Okay, now you have the can
and the amulet, so head Up to the surface, then South to the
Southern shore. You can see a cave to the South, and it looks
kind of dark. In fact, it *is* dark in there, which is why you
have the repellant. So, spray the smelly stuff on yourself, and
go South, and you will find yourself in a Dark Place. Go South
again, then East, and you will be in the key room. Whew! At
least there's some light in here! And by the light you can see a
strange key. Get the key, then move the manhole cover and go
down. And here you are on an aqueduct. Since you can't go back
<the Grue repellant wouldn't have lasted that long>, you might as
well go forward. So, just head along North and you will come to
the Water Slide. Go North down the slide, and guess where you
are? In the Damp Passage! And there's the torch, so pick it up,
because you're certainly going to need a light
source...especially when you think of where you're going next.
So, from the Damp Passage hike along West to the Junction <you
can't get the sword out of the rock, so don't even try>, then
South into Creepy Crawl, and Southwest into the Shadow Land. Here
we come to another variable portion of the game. You will have
to wander around in the Shadow Land until a cloaked and hooded
figure appears. When that happens, the sword will suddenly
materialize in your hand, and you will be able to fight. However,
since there's no way of telling when that will happen, you just
have to keep moving around until it does. At least you will get
a chance to practice some elementary map-making! Also, this is
the most dangerous part of the game, as the figure is quite
capable of killing you, too! So, best to save before you enter
Shadow Land. When the mysterious figure finally appears, attack
him with your sword until he is badly wounded and cannot defend
himself. At that point, get his hood. The figure will then
disappear, leaving the cloak behind. Get that also. Now, you
have to get out of here, and I can't tell you exactly how, since
there's no way of knowing exactly where you were when the fight
started. However, if you go Eastwards, you will exit the Shadow
Land at either the Creepy Crawl or the Foggy Room. From either
place, go North to the Junction.

From the Junction, it's West through the Barren Area, and West
again to the Cliff. Bet you just can't wait to climb down the
rope, huh? Well, pick up the bread first, then go down to the
ledge. Well, well, a chest! Too bad you don't have a key to
open it. In fact, there's no way for you to open it at all. But
don't despair, there's a way of doing it. Just wait around and
someone will come along the top of the cliff. You may not really
trust him, but tie the rope to the chest when he asks, and wait
around some more. Eventually, he will return and help you back
up the cliff. He will also give you a staff, which is what
you're really after here. Take the staff, then go back down to
the ledge, and from there, to the Cliff Base. Now trek South to
the Flathead Ocean, and do a little more waiting. Sooner or
later a ship will come floating by. As soon as you see it, say:
"Hello, Sailor." The man in the ship will throw something onto
the beach for you. Take a look, and you will see it's a vial.
It'll come in handy later, so pick it up. Now comes the fun
part: You have to wait for the earthquake <notice how you've been
doing a lot of waiting around? I hope you're a patient person!>.
 While you're waiting, you might want to wander around a little,
although you've been to most of the accessible places by now. In
any case, wherever you are, once the earthquake hits, make your
way to the Creepy Crawl, and from there East into the Tight
Squeeze, then East again into the Crystal Grotto. Then all the
way South to the Great Door, and East into the Museum Entrance.
Now, open the East door, then go North into the Museum. Look at
the gold machine <it's a time machine, in case you were
wondering>, then set the dial to 776. Here comes the fun part:
Push the machine South into the Entrance, then East into the
Jewel Room. Get into the machine, and push the button. Aha! Now
you're back in 776 GUE, but the time machine seems to have
vanished! No matter, wait for the guards to leave, then get the
ring <and *only* the ring!>, then open the door, go out into the
Entrance, open the North door and go North. By golly, the
machine is right there! Put the ring under the seat, turn the
dial to 948, get in, and push the button. Whew, you're back in
the right time period again. Get out of the machine, look under
the seat <you will get the ring automatically when you do this>,
then back South, and South again, to the Royal Puzzle. Okay
folks, you are about to enter the absolute nastiest part of the
game. You must follow the instructions *EXACTLY* as given, or
you will never get out. And, since it would be easy to make a
mistake here, I strongly recommend you save the game. 1. Go
Down the hole, then push the South wall. Then go East, South,
East, East. Push the South wall, get the book, and push the
South wall again. 2. Push the West wall twice. Then go East,
South, and push the East wall. 3. Now, go straight North until
you come to the marble wall, and push the East wall. 4. Now, go
West, South, South, South, South, East, East, North, North,
North, and push the West wall. 5. From there, go East, South,
South, South, West, West, West, West, North, North, North, West,
North. Push the East wall three times. 6. Now, West, West,
South, South, East, East, South, and push the East wall. 7.
Okay, now West, West, West, North, North, North, East, East, and
push the South wall two times. 8. From there, West, South,
South, East, East, North, and push the West wall two times. 9.
Now, South, West, and push the North wall until it won't move any
more. 10. Then West and North. Finally! You have maneuvered the
ladder under the hole <which was the purpose of all this pushing
and running around>, and now you can just go up and out!

Okay, you've solved the Royal Puzzle and you have the book, so
go North to the Museum Entrance, then open the East door and get
your other stuff from the Jewel Room. Then it's back West to the
Great Door, and from there back to the Junction. Now, East into
the Damp Passage, and NE to the Engravings Room. Well, we have
here yet another <!> of those variable events: Sooner or later,
an old man will be sleeping here. If he isn't there the first
time you arrive, walk around a little and return. When you
finally do see him, wake him up and give him the bread. He will
eat it and then make visible to you a secret door. He will then
vanish. Okay, you're getting closer to the end! Open the door,
and go into the Button Room, then North to the Beam Room. Put
the sword in the beam, then go back to the Button Room and push
the button. Now, back North to the Beam Room and North again into
the Mirror Room. There will be an opening in the Mirror, so go
North one more time, and you will be inside. Now, don't let the
long and complicated descriptions scare you! It's not really as
bad as you think <it's worse! heheheheh..just kidding!>. First,
raise the short pole. Then, push the white panel twice. Now,
push the pine panel, and go North. Okay, so here you are,
standing a little too close for comfort to the Guardians of Zork.
If I were you, I wouldn't try going past them quite yet! Open
the vial, then drink the liquid. While nothing seems to have
happened, you have in fact become invisible. Now you can walk
North until you come to the locked door. Knock on the door, and
the Dungeon Master will open it and let you in. All right, hang
in there, you have reached the end game! Go North, then West,
then North again. The DM will be following you. Go North to the
Parapet, set the dial to 4, and push the button. Now, go South,
open the cell door, and step inside. The DM will not follow you
in. Once inside, you will notice a bronze door in one of the
walls. However, you can't open it yet! Something else has to be
done. And it will have to be done by someone else. So, first
tell the DM to go to the Parapet. Then tell him to turn the dial
to 1, and then tell him to push the button. All right!! The
magic moment has arrived! Unlock the bronze door with the key,
open the door, and go South!

@node "Zork Zero"
@remark CS
To put the bedbug to sleep, sing to it and it will trouble you no more.
Sit on Dimwit's favourite throne and snap your fingers to reveal a secret
tunnel. In the library, rub the armour three times to find something
which may be useful to you.

FIRST EXPLORATIONS
You start in the great hall. Take the parchment and the calendar. Read the
parchment supplied with the game, and you will discover that you need 24 items
(2 for each of the 12 Flatheads) and a magic word to complete the game. Each
time you get one of these items, your score will go up by 12 points. South of
the hall are the audience chamber and the throne room, where you will find a
SCEPTER, the first of the 24 items you need. You can also read the
proclamation in the Entrance Hall, which is north our starting place.

West of the hall is a garden with a flamingo that you will need later, and a
locked door to the west wing. Northwest of the hall you will find a parlor
with a fish tank containing a lobster (needed later), and west of the Parlor,
the Torch Room. You can take the torches for amusement, but they will burn out
soon and are not really needed.

East of the Great Hall is a Courtyard leading to the locked East Wing. North
of the Courtyard is the Banquet Hall, which is a good place to leave most
objects while they are not needed.

Upstairs and South from the great hall in the Gallery is a rebus which is
covered by six flattened animals. Go South into the closet, and press the
button there; one of the animals will be removed from the rebus. You will
encounter five more such buttons, each of which will remove an animal when
pressed. Take the bag of food from the Closet.

GENERAL HINTS
Every time you obtain one of the 24 needed items, your score will increase by
12 points. There is a character called the Jester, who will both help and
annoy you. He will give you a funny paper and a slate, both of which contain
important information that may vary from game to game. When he sticks a clown
nose on your face, you must remove it before you suffocate. When he turns you
into an alligator, you will drop all your possessions and be unable to pick up
anything until you turn back a few moves. When the bedbug appears, sleep,
yawn, lie down, or sing a lullaby to get rid of it.

THE SECRET WING
Read the calendar, especially the FUN FAX for Suspendur. Follow the
suggestion to get into the secret wing. Take the candle from the secret
passage; it seems to be a magic candle that will stay lit. Go south and go
west at the Tee to the Solar. There is a key here for the East Wing. To take
the key you must solve the Jester's riddle: The answer is "Y."

West of the Solar is Dimwit's Room and a closet containing a magic glove and
a magic cloak. Take them and wear the glove. You will need the cloak later.
There is a fly in the Parapet above the Solar, but you will not be able to get
it now.

Follow the east branch of the Tee to the Bottom of Stair. Go South into the
Dungeon, and down the hole. Take and wear the SEAMAN'S CAP (second of the 24
items), and wait a few turns if necessary. The Jester will appear and ask you
a riddle: If he is identical to his brother, but is not a twin, then what is
he? Answer triplet (or quadruplet or quintuplet), and you will escape from the
Oubliette.

Go to the Torture chamber southwest of the dungeon, and open all the torture
devices until you find and take the METRONOME (item 3).

EXPLORING THE OUTDOORS
Go to the Entrance Hall, and ring the bell. The Jester will ask you a riddle.
Answer "time," and the Portcullis will open. Go north to the Inner Bailey, and
take the worm (needed later). Continue northwest to the Causeway and Barbican.
Go up, and turn the wheel to open the bridge. Continue northwest to the
Drawbridge, and the Outer Bailey. The Perimeter Wall northwest of the Bailey
cannot be passed until the end of the game.

Go southwest from the Bailey to the Garrison, and open the locker. Take the
key, which opens the West wing. Go northeast and follow the northeast path to
the Shady Park. You can explore the church to the South, but it is not
essential to the game. In the URS Office North of the park, answer
"bookkeeper" to the riddle and take the Zorkmid Coin. Go back to the park, and
East to the Village Center. The courtroom to the North is not essential to the
game.

Go south from the Village Center to the Post Office. Take the package and
open it. The magic homing pigeon works as follows: Anyone who takes it will be
transported to the location of the perch. Go north to the Center, and east to
the FrobozzCo Lobby. Climb to the office of Frank Lloyd Flathead (see the
calendar for its location) and take the T-SQUARE (item 4). Then walk down to
the basement.

Press the button in the basement, and continue South to Philharmonic hall.
Stand on the conductor's stand, and you will be transported to the basement.
Get off and take the VIOLIN (item 5). Get back on the stand to re-enter the
hall. The areas to the south and east are not essential to the game. Return to
the Lobby, and continue east and north to the Magic Shop, where you can take
the Ring of Ineptitude. Go back to the castle.

EAST WING
Make sure you have the iron key and the candle, and go to the Courtyard.
Unlock and open the door. North of the East Wing is the Library. Touch the
armor 3 times to get the LANCE (item 6). Read the encyclopedia about various
things. In particular, read the entry about the Jester, as you will need his
name. South of the East Wing is a Chapel. Open the trap door, which is a short
cut to the Crypt.

East of the East Wing are the Guest Rooms. Take the wand, which can animate
or freeze objects for 16 turns. Go east again to the Servants' Quarters, and
up to the Jester's Quarters. Open the large door, and go North twice to the
Pyramid room. Take and wear the goggles. They will enable you to look into
objects. Return to the Jester's Quarters.

Open the small door, and you will be confronted by the Tower Of Bozbar (more
commonly known as the Tower of Hanoi). [Ed's note: Save your game before
starting this puzzle!] The recursive procedure to solve this puzzle is as
follows: To move N weights from one peg to another, move N-1 weights to the
remaining peg, move the Nth weight to the target peg, and move the N-1 weights
to the target peg. The large door in the Jester's Quarters will open only when
all weights are on one of the pegs, and will lead to 1 of 3 different rooms,
each of which contains an object you need.

You already have the goggles from the center peg. Move the weights to the
right peg (it will take 63 moves) and obtain the MANUSCRIPT (item 7). Move the
weights to the left peg and obtain the cup with the magic potion. Return to
the main part of the Castle.

WEST WING
Make sure you have the candle, the wand, and the steel key, and are wearing
the goggles. Go down from the Kitchen, and take the Walnut. Then go into the
parlor, and point the wand at the Lobster; it will turn into a nutcracker. Go
south and southwest. Unlock and open the door, then enter the West Wing. Try
to go West from the West Wing and the Jester will ask you to show him
something that nobody has ever seen before and nobody will ever see again.
Open the walnut with the nutcracker, and show it to ester. Then eat it. This
will allow you to go further West later on.

North of the West Wing is the Peg Room. Play Peggleboz (If you are unable to
win, one solution is QG SQ HR UL IK TI EJ OG AE FN MO LJ PF FC BD DK QG EJ
OG.) Go north to the Gaming Room. The Jester will play a shell game. Since you
are wearing the goggles, you will see exactly where the ZORKMID BILL (item 8)
is. Point there and you will get it. Stow all your items, and pick up the
DUMBBELL (item 9) in the gym south of the West Wing. Return to the main part
of the Castle and stow the dumbbell.

UNDERGROUND
Make sure you have the candle, the coin, the pigeon, the perch, and the
cloak, and are wearing the glove. (Note: You may have to try more than once to
pick up the pigeon.) Go down from the Great Hall to the Lower Hall, and down
again to the Lowest Hall.

To the South is a closed vault door. Examine the door, then examine the dial,
and turn it to any number. Because of the dexterity the glove gives you, you
will automatically crack the safe. Open the door, go south, and take the STOCK
CERTIFICATE (item 10). Also go north from the Lowest hall, and take the magic
passages. Read the notice that flies out when you take them.

From the Lower hall, go southwest to the Great Underground Highway, south to
the Exit, and west to the Field Office. The blueprint there is supplied with
the game. The memo indicates that a hard-hat was left in one of the lots. Go
west to lot 47.

The closest you can get to the hat is a Knight's (as in chess) move away. Go
there; you will need to install the magic passages to do so. You do not need
the hammer you will find along the way. When you arrive, drop the perch and
wear the cloak You will be transported to the Plain, an area constructed like
a chessboard. Explore the area until you find one of the knights. Drop the
pigeon; the knight will pick it up and be transported.

Take off the cloak to return from the plain. The knight will be with you
holding the pigeon and the perch. Take the pigeon from him, and tell him to go
to the hard-hat location: "SOLDIER, x THEN xx." Drop the pigeon, and take it
to join him. He will be wearing the hard-hat. Tell him to reverse his move,
and repeat the process with the pigeon. Take all to get the hat and the perch,
and work your way out of the construction zone.

From the Exit go south to the Crossroad, and south again to the Toll Booth.
Read the sign and put the coin in the basket. Ditch the cloak, and other
unneeded items here, or your hands will be too full. Follow the south path all
the way to the Orb Room, and take the orbs. Return to the Crossroads and go
east to the Cave-In. The Jester will ask you for his middle name, which you
found in the encyclopedia. Answer correctly, and take the anti-pit bomb.

Return to the Lower Hall, and go down twice to the Pits. Throw the bomb at
the pits, and you will be able to take the LANTERN (item 11). Go back up to
the lower hall and north to the Laboratory and take the SCREWDRIVER (item 12).
Return to the castle to stow your loot.

PORT FOOZLE
Make sure you are carrying the candle, and are NOT carrying the pigeon. Go
back to the Crossroads and take the west path. When you reach the Fork,
continue west all the way to the Wharf, and west to the Casino. The Jester
will ask you to play Double Fanucci. Sit down and begin playing. If you read
the calendar about Babe Flathead, you will be able to eventually win, and take
the broom.

Stand up and go south, east, and north to reach the Inquisition. Take the box
that is there, and a number, and read the rules. When your number comes up,
enter "EXECUTIONER, BEHEAD ME," which is paradoxical to the posted rules. You
will be put back into the Fishing Village. Go south twice, and southeast to
the Warning Room. It is a good idea to save your game at this point. Read the
sign and go northeast to the Room of Three Doors. Read the doors. Two of the
doors have statements that would both be of the door led to Wishyfoo territory. Open the remaining door, and take the
shovel. Go down, and you will be at the fork.

Return to the castle. In the Secret Wing go to the Cell, which is southeast
from the Dungeon. Sweep the cobwebs, and you will find a GLASS FLASK (item
13). Go north from the Bottom of Stair and north again into the crypt. By now
you should have received the funny paper. Look under the indicated slab, and a
hole to the Oracle will appear. You should also have received the slate. Work
your way outdoors to the outer Bailey, stand at the stump (remember the slate
is old and the tree was living at the time),follow the directions, and dig
with the shovel. Open the chest and take the GAUDY CROWN (item 14). Return
to the castle and stow everything.

THE LAKE AND DESERT AREAS
Be sure to have the squid repellent, pigeon, perch, and candle, and to wear
the seaman's cap. Enter the Lower Level, and go southeast to the Royal Zoo,
and east to the West Shore of the Lake. Enter the dock; then enter the boat
and examine the controls. Press the white button (while wearing the cap), and
the yacht will go to the middle of the lake.

Go down to the Hold, and examine the Bathysphere. Drop the squid repellent,
open the Bathysphere, enter it, close the door, and examine the controls. Turn
on the lights, put your hand in the hole, grab the squid repellent, and push
the lever down. Wait until you reach the bottom. Release the repellent, grab
the ruby, which is on the bottom, and push the lever up. When you reach the
top, remove your hand from the hole, open the door, get out, and take the
ruby.

Go up, and press the green button to go to the South shore. Leave the yacht,
leave the dock, and go west to the stream. When you try to go west, the Jester
will ask you a riddle. Answer "music" and you will receive a DIPLOMA (item
15). Go back east, south to the Edge of Desert, east to the Great Underground
Savannah (you will get the fly later), and northeast to the Great Underground
Woods. Leave the fox for now, and continue north to the Base of Mountain. Go
east up the mountain and take the amulet

Push the boulder, and you will be able to continue north to the Grotto. Press
the button (3) and continue northeast to the Shrine. The elixir here is toxic,
as you will discover if you use the straw from the kitchen to drink it, but
what you have to do is merely touch it. Leave most of your possessions here;
you need to keep the pigeon and the candle, and be sure to leave the perch. Go
to the Grotto, and go down. You will fall into the Lowest Hall with some
gravel. Take the gravel, the candle, and the last item to get back. Put the
gravel in the bowl, and repeat this two more times (so that there are 3
helpings of gravel in the bowl). You can now touch the elixir. This will
enable you to take the flies. Take your possessions, and wear the cap and
the amulet.

Return to the base of the mountain and go north to the Stable, where you can
take the SADDLE (item 16) and the rooster. On your way back to the docks take
the fox and the fly. Get onto the yacht, press the yellow button to go back,
make your way to the Castle, and stow you possessions. On your way back, pick
up the toboggan from the Kennels (west of the Royal Zoo). DO NOT leave the
rooster alone with either the fox or the worm!

FENSHIRE
Take ONLY the fox, rooster, and worm with you. Go to the West Hall, and
continue west to the Dirigible Hanger. Enter the dirigible, and press the
right button. Wait until you arrive in Fenshire. Leave the dirigible, go south
to the Deserted Castle, east to the Ruined Hall, and north to the Marsh.

Give the fox, rooster, and worm to the Jester, who will now have all the
ingredients for Borphbelly Stew -- although he'll insist on going North to the
Nice Lunch Spot. You now face the old puzzle (more commonly given as fox,
goose, and corn). You can carry only one item, and cannot leave the rooster
with either the fox or the worm. The solution is: Carry the rooster north.
Drop it, return, and take the fox north. Take the rooster, and drop the fox.
Go south, take the worm, and drop the rooster. Go drop the worm, and return
to take the rooster North.

The Jester will make the stew, and you will end up in the Fenshire Hangar
with a hexagonal block. Press the left button to return to the Castle; you
will have to go to Fenshire again later.

ORACLE AND GLACIER AREA
Wear the amulet, and take the ruby, candle, toboggan, pigeon, perch and all 4
orbs. Go to the Crypt and down to the Oracle. Drop the perch, and put the ruby
in the depression to activate the Oracle. If you examine the amulet, anywhere
from none to all 4 of the eyes may be open. Every few turns the Oracle will
blink, and the number of open eyes will increase by 1 (or cycle from 4 to 0).
Enter the Oracle at a time when one eye is open; you will be transported to
the Glacier.

Drop the toboggan, and ride it; you will slide down to Mirror Lake. Look at
all 4 orbs in the mirror. One of them will show a sleeping maiden. Discard the
3 that do not, throwing the last one east. The reaction will put you on the
west side of the lake. Enter the Chalet, and take the SCALE MODEL (item 17).
Drop and take the pigeon to return to the Oracle.

CRAG AREA
Leave the perch at the Oracle, continue wearing the amulet, and equip
yourself with the pigeon, the proper orb, candle, hexagonal block, and wand.
Go down to the Royal Zoo, and drop the pigeon. SAVE YOUR GAME AT THIS POINT.
You may have to wait a few turns here to get the timing right. You have only
16 turns before the rope reverts into a snake.

Point the wand at the snake, which will turn into a rope. Open the cage, and
take the rope and the pigeon to get back to the Oracle. Enter the Oracle when
no eyes are open. You will be transported to the Crag. Go down to the Upper
Ledge, tie the rope to the Spire. Go down to the Lower Ledge, and take the
EASEL (item 18), and the LANDSCAPE (item 19). Drop and take the pigeon to get
back.

Return to the Crag as before and press the button (4). Go northeast (or
southeast) to the Natural Arch, and down to the Enchanted Cave. Put the orb on
the altar, and take the flower. Return to the Crag, go southwest to the
Hollow. Put the block in the hole, and go south to the Iron Mine. Take the
sapphire, and return to the Oracle via the pigeon drop.

Return to Fenshire, and go south from the Ruined Hall to the Hothouse, and
play Snarfem (Nim). If you do not know how to play look at the flowers. The
ones on the left show the pile number; those on the right show how many to
take. After you win, take the fan. In the Ruined Hall, put the flower in the
vase, go east, and take the ladder. Return to the castle.

ANTHARIA I
Make sure you are wearing the hard-hat and the amulet, and have the candle,
pigeon, and lantern. Enter the Oracle when all 4 eyes are open; you will be
transported to the Mine Entrance. Go east to the Rubble Room, north to the
Heart of Mine, and north to the Crawl. Press the button there (5). Go
northwest and take the QUILL PEN (item 21).

Leave the mine, go west to the Coast Road, and southwest to Flathead Stadium.
You will be unable to take the club. Go southeast to the Edge of Bog, and east
to the Cliff Bottom. Turn on the lantern, go up to the Precipice, and east to
the Aerie. A bird will take one of your light sources. Continue southeast to
the Icky Cave. Summon the witches (see the Ottobur page in the calendar to
learn how). Say hello to one of the witches. They'll ask for 6 gloops of water
from the Great Underground Oasis, and for you a 9-gloop vial.

Leave the Cave. Search the nest, and take the tie. Your light sources will be
at the Cliff Bottom. Turn off the lantern, and return to the castle via the
pigeon drop.

FUBLIO VALLEY
Make sure you are wearing the amulet, and carrying the candle, pigeon, and
ladder. Enter the Oracle when 3 eyes are open to reach the Foot of Statue. Go
southwest to the view, south to Outside Hut, and west to Megaboz's Hut. Read
the poem. Leave the ladder and climb it. Open the trap door, and go up to the
Attic. Press the button -- the last of the six buttons in the game. You will
come back later to open the trunk. Return to the view (leaving the ladder
behind). Go southeast to the Cairn, and east side Shack. Read the sign and
go northeast into Gumboz's Shack. Take the 4-gloop vial. Gumboz will cast a
hunger spell on you. Return to the Castle by the pigeon drop.

BOOTHS
Take the bag of food and the wand (as well as the candle you are carrying)
and go to the Formal Garden. Point the wand at the Flamingo; it will become a
lawn ornament. Go east to the Great Hall, down, and north twice to reach the
Testing Room. Put the Flamingo into one of the booths, and enter the other.
Open the bag and wait until the ornament becomes a Flamingo again. Press the
button, and YOU will become a flamingo! Eat the food to remove the hunger
spell.

OASIS
Make sure you are carrying both vials, the candle, and are wearing the cap.
Take the yacht to the green dock. Go south, west, and ride the camel. Before
the camel will enter the desert, he must drink water at the Stream. From the
Edge of Desert, go south, southwest, southeast twice, and northeast to the
Great Underground Oasis. Dismount. You can get 6 gloops as follows: Fill the
9-gloop vial, and fill the 4-gloop vial from it twice. This will leave 1 gloop
in the large vial, which you can transfer to the small one. Fill the large
vial, and fill the 4-gloop vial from it. Six gloops will remain in the
9-gloop vial.

FUNGUS
Return with the vial to the witches. When you give them the vial, they
discover that they need some brogmoid earwax. Take the cup of potion, and go
all the way down from the Great Hall to the Pits, and continue following the
path down to the ear of the brogmoid. Drink the potion and listen. The fungi
will be seeking a long-lost cousin (the name will vary from game to game).
Return to the Castle.

MAGIC WORD AND EARWAX
By now the entire rebus will be visible. The solution is (note that it is a
mirror image): TIRED PINE, IRON MINE, WORE, MAGIC STORE. These combine with
the poem in Megaboz's hut. Take the Ring of Ineptitude, and the sapphire (plus
candle, amulet, potion, pigeon). Return to the Fublio valley, and follow the
path west from the View all the way to On Top of the World. Drink more potion
and call for the cousin by name. Take the small fungus that appears.

Work your way back down to the View. Go southeast, south and down to the
Quarry (in the shadow of a tired pine). Wear the Ring of Ineptitude (you will
drop all you are holding), and take the sapphire. Remove the ring. You can now
go to the Attic and unlock the trunk. Open the trunk and take the notebook and
the fly. Read the notebook to get the magic word.

Gather your items and return to the castle. Work your way to the ear again,
and drop the fungus. You are now able to go further IN and take the earwax.
Finally, give the wax to the Antharian witches, and go grab the CLUB (item 23)
at the Stadium.

DELTA AND ENDGAME
Before going to the Delta, go to the Parapet above the Solar in the secret
wing, and take the fly there. Enter the Oracle when 2 eyes are open to reach
the delta. This is the only maze in the game. One solution is as follows: Go
southwest twice and then northwest to reach the toad. Try to take the SPYGLASS
(item 24). You will have to ask the toad for it. Furthermore, you will have to
call him by name. Look up his name in the calendar article on John Paul
Flathead. The toad will ask for the 4 flies, after which you have 3.

Go north, then northeast twice to the River's End. Take the fly and go
southwest, northwest, and southwest back to the toad. Give him the flies, and
ask for the spyglass. Take it and return to the Castle.   You should now have
all 24 items and the magic word. Do as instructed on the parchment. Now you
can go past the Perimeter Wall (northwest of the Outer Bailey), and watch the
Castle turn into the small white house with a mailbox: The starting point of
ZORK I!
