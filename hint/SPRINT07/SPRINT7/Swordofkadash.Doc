                            ** SWORD OF KADASH **

                         From the collection of DR.J


CONTROLS

The game starts in keyboard mode.  Hold the Control key down while pressing J
to switch to joystick control.  Hold the control key down while pressing M to
switch to mouse control.  Hold the Control key down while pressing K to
switch back to keyboard control.  The game only accepts movement commands
from one input device at a time.

MOUSE CONTROL

Moving the mouse moves the animated character on the screen.  At the bottom
center of the screen is a little box with a circle in it.  The position of
the dot in relation to the center of the circle shows the direction the
character is moving.  For example, if the dot is above the circle, the
character moves up.  The dot will not move out of the box.  The circle is the
"dead zone"; if the dot is inside the circle, the character stops moving.
The number keys 1 to 9 control the size of the dead zone; 1 is the smallest
and 9 largest.  The mouse button fires darts in the direction the character
faces and the spacebar casts spells.

JOYSTICK CONTROL

The character will move in the direction that you move the joystick.
Pressing the fire button on the joystick will fire darts in the direction you
move the joystick.  You must use the spacebar to cast spells.

KEYBOARD CONTROL

The keyboard controls are grouped around the L key.  The character moves in 8
directions corresponding the the 8 keys grouped around the L key.  Tapping a
movement key makes the character move in that direction.  (Examples:  press
; (semi-colon) to go right, press K to go left).  Holding the key down shoots
darts in that direction.  Use the spacebar to cast spells.

OTHER COMMANDS

The ESC key pauses the game, and hitting any key will then allow you to
continue.  Hold down the Control key while pressing Q to save the current
game in progress and end the current game session.  Only one game can be
saved at a time.  The player may then follow the prompts on the screen to
restart the game or go to the main menu.

Hold down the control key while pressing D to terminate the current game if
you are trapped in a hopeless position and wish to end the game.  You will
have to start a new game no matter how many lives you have left when you use
this command.

Each player is allowed three lives (one initial life and two reincarnations).
A character is killed whenever hit points reach zero.  Each time a character
dies, the position in the dungeon is retained; however, the character's
status reverts to that of a new character.  All experience, weapons, armor,
etc. accumulated during play is lost.  If the character dies in the third
life, the game starts over at the beginning.

Note:  The game disk must not be write-protected.  The dungeon data is
updated on a continuous basis.  The game will freeze (and cannot be saved) if
unable to write to the disk.

DEFINITIONS
Note the type at the bottom of the screen.  As in any role-playing adventure
game, each of your characteristics interacts with the others.  When something
happens to change a characteristic, this change will trigger alterations in
one or more of the other characteristics.  For example, you find a treasure
chest (let's say it is worth 30 points), your EXPERIENCE will go up 30 points
--this can cause your LEVEL to increase. If your LEVEL goes up, so does your
ARM. CLASS and your HIT POINTS. This is just one example of how such
interaction works.  What follows are general definitions:

EXPERIENCE--Points earned as a result of victories in battle and treasure
found. When enough experience points have been gained, your level will
increase.
ARMOUR CLASS--Calculates how much damage you take from an attack or a trap.
WEAPON--Tells what weapon you have in your possession.
ARMOUR--Shows what type of armour you are wearing.
SHIELD--Tells you the last object you picked up or touched.
HIT POINTS--Represents the amount of damage you can take before dying.
LEVEL--Measures of your experience.  The higher your level, the better you
will do in combat.
SPELLS--Tells how many spells you have.

WEAPONS

DAGGER--Short, heavy-bladed knife--does the least amount damage of all four
weapons.
MORNINGSTAR--Leather wrapped handle connected by a short chain to a spiked
iron ball.  It is very useful in close combat, and is a step above a dagger.
AXE--Deadly, sharp, curved blade on a heavy wooden handle.  It is the
favorite weapon of iznik warriors, and is considered to be the next best
weapon to a sword.
SWORD--Typical, unadorned, one-handed broadsword.  It is considered to be the
best weapon for dungeon combat.

Some weapons have magical powers that allow you to cause more damage to a
monster when you hit it.  These weapons are indicated by a +1, +2, +3 or +4
rating (+1 being lowest, +4 being highest).

TREASURES

HEALER--could be called a magical first-aid box.  With its mystical
properties, a healer can heal you by restoring a certain number of your hit
points.  Caution, some healers have a tendency to set off very damaging traps.
SYMBOL--Ornamental piece of jewelry similar in appearance to that of an
Egyptian ahnk.  Symbols have the magical ability to remove curses.
KEY--Magnificently jewelled, this object is highly coveted.
SCROLL--Parchment containing a magic spell.  A scroll can be used to scare
off monsters making them much easier to kill while they are running away from
you.  When you pick up a scroll, it will be added to your current number of
spells.
CHEST--small iron or brass bound wooden box containing...?  There is no time
during battle to find out what lies within, but rumor has it that each chest
contains a different treasure: jewels, gold, chocolate...
DIAMOND ALARM--Does no immediate damage to you, but releases a trap that will.

Be Advised:  not all weapons, armour, or treasure you find will be
helpful to you. Some items are cursed.  To find out if the item you have
picked up is cursed, refer to the text window in the space above hit points.
Once you pick up a cursed item, you cannot get rid of it until you find a
holy scroll or symbol.  While carrying a cursed item, you will be unable to
use any other item except holy ones.  While cursed, your present weapon and
armour also become cursed.


OBJECT

The burning sands of a Persian desert surround you for miles.  Two nights ago
your nomad guide abandoned your journey--taking with him the camels, and the
bolts of cloth you were hoping to sell in the market place of Tabriz.  Gazing
gratefully at the waterskin he left behind, you think back on the journey
from the west. It took four long, hard months to get to Persia by camel from
where you left the Mediterranean.  Now all hopes of making a fortune are gone
--like your guide.  Taking a drink, you wonder how long it will be before the
sand covers your bones. Suddenly, a cloud of dust appears atop a nearby sand
dune.

A group of people become visible in the settling dust.  Facing you is a crowd
of about 30 men clothed in flowing robes and turbans seated on magnificent
horses.  One of the men dismounts and walks toward you.  The man you hoped
would help you is carrying a scimitar, and he has it in his hand prepared to
behead you.

"No!" shouts a voice form the top of the dune.  You look up into eyes colder
than the desert nights.

"I am the leader of these men," he says.  "The fiercest band of brigands to
roam the desert!  You are my prisoner, infidel!  Bow before me, dog of an
unbeliever, or die this instant."   Quickly, you sink to your knees and beg
to be spared.  All thoughts of safety disappear like a mirage. This just
hasn't been a good trip for you.

"Spare you?  Of course I'll spare you.  I have a task for one such as you
--strong-bodied, obedient..."

"To the north lies an enchanted sword, the  Sword of Kadash.  It can be found
somewhere in the deadly catacombs of the fortress of the Dragon, guarded by
fierce beasts and vile demons."

When you ask why the brigands don't get the sword themselves, the leader
laughs cruelly.  "A score of men have been sent into the fortress, and none
have returned.  That is why we are sending you--one with such prowess should
have no problem walking into the fortress and walking out with the Sword."

This remark brings a malicious chuckle from the thieves.  Refuse and they
will kill you now.  Since there is a chance to retrieve the Sword and
survive, you accept.  Confidently, you ask what your reward will be upon
returning.  The leader answers, "Many treasures are to be found in the
fortress.  Whatever you take is your to keep...if you get out alive.

After two nights of traveling north, the party arrives outside the Fortress
of the Dragon.  It is a huge foreboding castle situated on a stark plateau.
During the journey, the brigands have told you that the Sword of Kadash is a
great two-handed sword that was once the property of an almost invincible
Templar Knight.  The Sword is said to be enchanted, powered by the blood of
those slain with it during the Crusades.  Those who wield the great Sword are
susceptible to its enchantment. That is why it lies deep in the dungeons,
unused by even the powerful Liche who guards it.  The dreaded dragon, Aladag,
must be slain with the Sword in order for you to escape the Fortress.  The
brigands have explained that they, faithful followers of Allah, seek not to
use the Sword.  They wish to restore it to its holy resting place in the
Vizier's Palace as a symbol to all true believers of the vanquished
Crusaders.

Armed only with a dagger, a shield, and your natural charm, you set off to
complete your task.
