                            (Lost In Las Vegas)


General Notes.
(1)  Take  and wear the pants and trenchcoat immediately, since the bedroom
door will lock behind you.

(2)  From  time  to time, one of Malone's thugs will appear to warn you how
little time you have left; take one of the cigar rings that he drops.

(3)  Before going outside, visit the Casino and play blackjack at the table
of  your  former  sparring  partner.  To play blackjack, select all of your
chips  (with  the  shift-click  method  if  using the mouse), then click on
'operate' and the table. Your friend will then deal the cards. If your card
total  is  close to 21, click on 'Hit' and then the table; otherwise, click
on  'Hit'  and  then the 'Self' button. Ordinarily your former partner will
let  you  win.  When  he  is replaced, use 'Shift-click' to select all your
chips and drag them to your inventory immediately. Otherwise the new dealer
may confiscate your chips.

(4)  Going  South  from the desert-related locations often leads to getting
lost in a desert maze.

(5) Once you have enough money, head directly for the train station.

(6)  Do  not  wander  around the Las Vegas desert, or you will be bitten by
snakes.

(7)  You  should  only  travel East and West from the entrance to the Lucky
Dice Hotel/Casino.

(8)  You  will need to travel to and from Chicago by train; boarding trains
for other destinations will get you killed.

(9)  In Chicago, you can travel to different locations by cab but will have
to SHOW addresses to the Cabbie, since he cannot hear you.

(10)  Wear  the Police uniform only for the Morgue, and change back to your
regular clothes before leaving Chicago.

(11)  In  places  where you must wait, make time pass by double clicking on
objects (to examine them).

(12)  Ignore  the bag lady near Joe's Bar, as well as all food, bottles and
the  references  to  cigarettes, since these are not connected with winning
the game.

(13) Turn your printer on before the finale!
