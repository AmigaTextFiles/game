                               THUNDER BLADE  
                               by U.S. Gold


SCENARIO

Your country is being overrun by the marauding rebel forces of a  merciless 
and unforgiving dictator, General Swindells.  Battle weary troops accede to 
the  superior power of the rebels' sophisticated weaponry and it is only  a 
matter of time before the government is overthrown.   U.S.  G.  H.  Q. have 
summoned  you as their last remaining hope to vanquish the enemy using  the 
ultimate flying machine,  Thunder Blade, an advanced attack helicopter.  An 
experienced  veteran of many of an aerial campaign, can you accomplish  the 
seemingly impossible?

The mission details are outlined to you in various strategical stages:

     1.  Skyscraper City
     2.  Mountain Desert
     3.  River Delta
     4.  Refinery

In each sector,  you will come up against both ground and air  forces,  all 
trying to defend one of their super fortresses,  which must be destroyed at 
all  costs.   Once the last stronghold has been defeated you'll  deserve  a 
good rest.

LOADING INSTRUCTIONS

Insert disk, turn on computer and game will load and run automatically.

GAMEPLAY

You start the game with 5 reserve helicopters.   The game is over once  all 
of  your  helicopters have been destroyed or once the last  stronghold  has 
been  taken.   An extra  helicopter is awarded on achieving  a  pre-defined 
number of points.

You engage the enemy from both vertical and horizontal viewpoints.  Thunder 
Blade's advance weaponry system comprises a rapid-fire Chain  Cannon,  used 
for  aerial  targets such as enemy helicopters and  airplanes.   One  quick 
burst  is all that is needed.   Straight line air-to-ground  missiles  take 
care of your land and sea enemy targets.  Remember though, missiles are not 
suited  to  rapid fire,  so accuracy and timing is of  primary  importance.  
They also cannot shoot at enemy aircraft,  only ground craft,  so  remember 
Cannon for Air.  Missiles for Ground.

To hit your target on land or sea,  position yourself in a direct line with 
the enemy's vehicle and press the Fire Button.

seen it, haven't lived to tell.

Bonus  points are awarded at the end of each level.   The bonus depends  on 
the number of craft destroyed.  A time bonus is also awarded.

HINTS

In every stage the enemy attacks in patterns.   By identifying these you'll 
know where to move, where to fire and when.  Shoot all of the enemy down if 
you can to earn bonus points and helicopters.

Not all of the enemy will shoot at you but you can't be too careful.  If it 
moves or looks dangerous, shoot it.
