                              (Marlin Games)




Getting  started:  Ask  Sajo  about  the  Jade  Stone,  ask  Sajo about the

manuscript,  ask  Sajo  about Mallumo, ask Sajo about Putrons then go North

when Sajo leaves and ask him for the manuscript, examine manuscript and ask

Sajo  about  the  Guardian, go Southeast when Sajo leaves and ask him about

Carmon  (the  answers are basically clues as to what you need to do, etc.).

Go down into the Dungeon, Question Putron, Charm or Kiss Guard, Interrogate

Putron,  then  return to the Hall and search the various rooms (look at the

object list at the end of this solution to help you find everything).



The Kitchen has cakes and a knife - search table for the latter and examine

oven  to  discover  the  cakes. To get the cakes: use towel to get cakes or

remove/get cakes with towel. The Dining Hall: examine the table to find the

book,  then  swap the book for the towel (you can swap them again if you've

done  this  before  getting the cakes), examine the book and make a note of

what  it  says,  then  drop  it - collect it later if you want, but it just

provides  a  clue for later, and at this stage you'll probably need to only

carry  useful  items.  The  Town  Square is just a 'pass-through' location,

although  the  Pedlar may be here, in which case examine pedlar to discover

what  he  is selling then examine the various items, buying the thread when

you  can.  To  buy  the map, you'll need a gold nugget. Buy the other items

available  at  the two shops (North and Northeast of the Square), i.e., the

meat, the hooks and the rope - they're all needed.



To  get  money:-  2 ways (and you'll need to do both). Sell cakes to baker,

sell  jewellery  to  pedlar.  To enter the Temple: examine the priests then

remove shoes. To pass the robbers on the narrow road, pray in the Temple of

the  Sun and take the talisman, then keep it until the robbers run off. (If

you've  been  robbed, don't worry - just examine shelter in the dell in the

wood  to  find  your belongings again). To carry more objects you'll need a

bag.  Examine woman and talk to woman in the cottage (North of the village)

then  mend shawl (but make sure that you first have the needle and thread).

To   help   the  Lumberjack,  examine  him  then  tear  petticoat,  bandage

hand/wound, get logs. To catch the dog, type CATCH DOG WITH ROPE (make sure

you're  holding  the  latter  first,  though)  then  just  go  to the house

Southeast of the Town Square and you'll be rewarded with a tinderbox.



To  get the brooch:- first examine the pools (South of the cove), then make

a  crabbing  line  with  string  and  hooks (if you ask the fisherman about

crabs,  he'll give you a hint), put bait on hooks then either fish or lower

line  and  you'll catch the crab, then get brooch. To get the nugget to buy

the map, give the brooch to the hermit, ask hermit about ring (provided you

have  it,  of  course - give a coin to the tramp then get the ring). To get

salt, examine slab at cove then scrape salt with knife.



Carmon:- Go East into his room, wait, say No to both of his questions, then

get  cask,  examine  cask,  examine  powder,  go  West and ask Carmon about

Russinor/Glade  if  you  want,  but he's not allowed to be helpful. To find

Glade/Russinor  free  the  little girl East of the clearing in the woods by

cutting  the  brambles,  then West and play with the children, then scatter

the powder on the pool.



To  move  the rubble in the ruined cottage go to the Farmhouse then quietly

to  the  baby  or  rock baby gently then ask the Farmer to go to the ruined

cottage  or tell him to go North, etc., at the necessary locations, then go

to  the  Cottage and ask him to move the rubble. To get the dove, pick corn

when  in the cornfield, throw corn when under gnarled tree, then play flute

and  he'll  follow  you  to the Marsh - if he does fly off, just repeat the

process.  To  enter the Marsh, drop the logs (given by the Lumberjack) then

push logs or make path with logs then carefully cross logs. In the Marsh go

South  to the Lake, play the flute and get into the boat, provided you have

the  dove with you, Marissa will give you a chalice, climb into the boat to

return  to  the other side of the lake. To pass the Mist to the East of the

Plains,  you  must be carrying the glow-worm - found Northwest of the first

location  in  the Marsh. At the Henge, examine the chalice to discover some

runes,  read  the  runes (they are just words written sideways so turn your

head to read them - the tramp will give you a clue if you rub the ring then

ask the Tramp about the runes - provided you have the chalice), put chalice

on  slab,  say the words on the chalice (POTENCO EL JADON) and the Guardian

will swap the chalice for the Jade Stone.



Now,  to  find Mallumo.........in the Tavern buy a drink for the traveller,

ask him about the Stone if you want, then give him the map for a clue as to

how  to  get  through  the  Mountains.  At  the Canyon go Up (listed in the

exits).  To  find  the  Passage,  examine/cut/burn  brambles on the ledge -

unfortunately  a  snake  appears.  To  dispose of the snake you'll need the

stick  and  tinderbox  -  light  stick,  you'll  go Down and the snake will

disappear into the passage, only to be eaten by the Bear! The Army and your

Father  will  charge  into  battle,  and  a time factor now comes into play

(should  be  ample time to finish, though, if you leave the snake until you

have  everything  you need, including the sickle from the Barn, the armour,

the sword - bent or otherwise - you'll get a replacement if it is, provided

you keep it, the incense, tinderbox, Stone and the salt.



To  enter  the  Castle, you must first dispose of the Putrons at the camp -

talking  to  them  should provide a clue, also remember where you found the

incense  and  what was painted there, so in the Cave light the incense then

go to the Camp, examine the Putrons to find a horn (and possibly a sword if

your other one was bent), then go to the Castle walls and to open the gate,

blow horn.



In  the  Castle,  you'll need to kill the sleeping Putron in the Dungeon in

order to get his keys. To get the keys, you'll first need to dispose of the

vulture  at  the  top  of the Tower, do this by throwing meat, then examine

turrets  to  find  some wire, return to the Dungeons and get keys with wire

(can't), so bend wire and try again. In the Guard Room the graphic is meant

to help: examine the bed to find a blanket. In the Untidy Room, examine the

chairs,  junk  etc.,  until a piece of paper falls onto the floor then read

it. In the Hall look behind or pull tapestries to discover a panel, examine

the  panel to discover a slot, open panel with key or insert key into slot.

In  the  Temple, examine the altar to discover the evil force. Pour salt on

the  floor,  say  VENKI  MALBONE (the piece of paper and the book were your

clues for this), examine the altar and pull switch then go South.



To win: There are various endings but the one that earns you full points is

the following:- Throw sickle at rope (to free Guy), you'll be surrounded by

flames  so  smother/extinguish flames with the blanket, then throw the Jade

Stone  at  the  orb  (however, if your Father has been killed in the battle

before  you  finish,  your score will be less). Other ways to finish are to

throw  the Stone at the orb WITHOUT freeing Guy first; running out of time;

kissing  or marrying Carmon; getting killed by Mallumo; dying from the heat

of the flames.
