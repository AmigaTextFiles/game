THE MEKON AND HIS MUTANTS
The fate of all mankind hangs in the balance. The Mekon menace is back
again determined to conquer and dominate the human race. In doing so,
the evil Mekon has vowed to wreak his vengenance upon his arch enemy.
Colonel Dan Dare. To further his inquitious plans, the Mekon is
conducting a series of horrific genetic experiments, attempting to
mutate a variety of life-forms into an army of Treen-like creatures,
serville to the Mekon. The experiments failed, the creatures were
twisted and strange. What was needed to advance the Mekons ungodly
experiments was a human subject, and who better than the hated Colonel
Dan Dare? The Mekon issued his orders. A gigantic scientific satellite
was rapidly constructed. Manned by an army of loyal Treens, the
satellite was set on course for Planet Earth. Many months passed
before reaching the Earths orbit. Whilst their ship navigated the dark
recesses of the universe, the Mekon and his scientists continued their
horific experiments. But with little success: no Treen-like beings
were created and the weird mutant creatures formed were left to wander
at will, the corridors of the satillite. On reaching the Earths orbit,
a small army of Treens were dispatched to capture the unsuspecting Dan
Dare. Their mission was successful, seizing the Colonel, the Treens
transported their prize back to the satellite where the pitiless Mekon
had underestimated our hero, while the scientists are preparing the
lethal serum, Dan breaks free from the operating table and destroying
his captors escapes into a store chamber next to the genetic
experimentation unit. Searching the chamber he discovers a jet-pack
and sets off to explore the maze of corridors and chambers of the vast
satellite. Luck is on the side of our brave colonel. Entering a large
chamber, he finds an escape shuttle, powerful enough to accomplish the
return journey to Earth, but the fuel tanks are empty. Dan calculates
that he will need exactly 50 pounds of high grade rocket fuel to
complete the journey home. Undaunted by this catastrophe, Dan straps
his jet-pack to his back and continues his search of the Mekons evil
satellite.

USING THE WEAPONS SYSTEMS

During his exploration of the vast satellite ,Dan discovers the Mekons armoury.
From the vast arsenal Dan chooses the very latest plasma cannon. The cannon has
three shot strengths, indicated by the bar readout on the screen; a quick tap
on the fire button releases a low power bolt of energy, holding the fire button
down until the bar readout reaches the mid-point in the display, fires off a
medium power blast ; keeping the fire button depressed until the bar readout
reaches the limit of its travel unleashes a real megablast of destructive
power. You must master the cannons control system before embarking on the quest
for Colonel Dares freedom-effective destruction of the life-forms requires
practice. Also watch out for the recoil when you use the megablast option.
Remember that the more powerful the blast that you unleash from the plasma
cannon, the longer it takes to recharge. So unless you are well covered, or
have just activated a smart bomb, you will leave Dan Dare defenceless against
the Mekons mutants whilst his cannon recharges. Colonel Dare is able to long on
to the terminal found in the start location and can buy some special weapons.
The weapon currently in use by the Colonel is displayed in a window on the
screen-to select one of the items that he is carriang, press select until the
item that you want appears in the window. Then press the fire button to
activate your choice, unless of course it is fuel or money which is useful to
have at hand.

MAKE GOOD YOUR ESCAPE

The start location which is the satellites store chamber, is the only place
where Dan can refuel his jet-pack, or buy weapons and equipment: this is done
by hacking into the Mekons computerised stock-keeping system. While Dan stands
on the Mekons computer terminal, press select. This creates a menu of numbered
items that Dan can buy. By pressing the corresponding number on the keyboard,
you can allow Dan to buy or use an item. Lives can be purchased as well, but
only in extreme need. Use lives wisely, in order to escape from the Mekons evil
satillite. Dan Dare has to collect 50 pounds of fuel to power the escape
shuttle for its flight back to planet Earth. The Mekon has not underestimated
Dan Dares abilities: before Dan Dare was kidnapped,  the Mekon ordered the fuel
store to be divided into five equal parts, which were then hidden in the five
main chambers of the scientific satillite. Dan has to search each of these
chambers to discover the hidden fuel, then Dan must find the Mekon and blast
away at the evil creature until the Mekon teleports back to his regeneration
unit to recuperate from the battle. As he leaves, the Mekon drops the teleport
key which Dan needs to teleport himself to the next chamber, But beware, the
evil Mekonn has booby-trapped the key. His intention is to blast our valiant
hero into oblivion. Luckily for Dan there is a critical design flaw in the
timing mechanism of each key which allows Dan three nanoseconds after he leaves
the chamber before the chamber- and everything in it- is destroyed. So there is
no real problem for Dan unless he has left the chamber without collecting the
fuel, in which case our intrepid hero will be stranded aboard the satellite for
eternity.....Time to hit the quit button and start the game anew.

TIPS FOR SUCCESS

Although brave and rugged, our hero Colonel Dan Dare is not superhuman. He is
not indestructible. Contact with the Mekons malevolent mutants drains Dans life
force. Bumping into the walls of the teleport tunnels that link the satellites
chambers, damages his space suit, reducing his life force. Keep a careful eye
on the quantity of ammo and bombs that you are carrying. Ammo can be collected
from certain places in the play area, but bombs have to be purchased via the
terminal in the start location. Keep track of the jet-pack fuel remaining in
the tank. If you run out of fuel Colonel Dan is effectively stranded until he
loses life and is returned to the start location.
