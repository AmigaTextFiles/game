COMBAT, MAGIC & MONEY.
To  defeat K-Plants and other tough monsters, especially early in the game,
use one purlet and one parzin for each creature. When possible, do so prior
to entering the location. After visiting the Castle and a Witch in a Realm,
buy  a  better sword. To develop Strength, use prihny powder at the Witch's
hut  and drink until you attain the current maximum level. By visiting each
Wizard  you  will learn more magic spells. Carry at least ten bows and five
hundred  arrows when crossing into another Realm. Locations of some healing
pools are pointed out to assist in the early stages.
