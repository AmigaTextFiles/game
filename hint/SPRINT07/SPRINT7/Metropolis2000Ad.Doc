INTRODUCTION:

"The  Town is Down!" you hear the people cry.   The invasion  has  started.  
The  situation looks hopeless,  the town has been completely overrun by  an 
alien  force.   It seems that there is nothing anybody can do.   But  wait!  
You  see  the  prototype of a  new  patrol  craft.   With  multidirectional 
thrusters and a powerful beta-pulse gun,  this could be just the ticket for 
defeating the enemy.  But who's going to pilot it?  Why, YOU of course!!!

MISSION INSTRUCTIONS:

There  are  two  main  tasks which you  must  complete.   First  (and  most 
important  if  you are to survive) you must blast all  nasties  from  Outer 
Space into oblivion!   Also,  to prevent their return, you must pick up all 
the security cards so that a force shield may be erected.  Having collected 
all the cards, find the correct teleport that will activate the shield.

THE GAME:

As  you  fly around the city there are various features that  may  help  or 
hinder your mission.  The aliens will, of course attack you.  You will have 
to make sure your fuel tanks are always full (fly over the filling stations 
to replenish them).   However, you can pick up START BOMBS - they look like 
large  blue  crystals  - which will destroy all enemy craft  in  one  zone. 
Teleports  will transport you to another zone of the city at the  speed  of 
light!  Use these features to your best advantage.

THE CONTROLS:

All movement is controlled by the joystick connected to port two.   Use the 
fire button to release beta-pulses.  Smart bombs can be set off by pressing 
the  space  bar.   To start the game (once it has loaded!) press  the  fire 
button.

The  game  can  be paused at any time by pressing  ESCape  and  the  action 
continued by hitting any other key (but not space, for obvious reasons!).

If  you wish to remove the stunning sound-track you may do so  by  pressing 
the HELP key with paused.  (Repeat the step to turn it back on.)


AUTHORS NOTE:  DO NOT press ESC while playing the game.  It will lock up.
So, you can't pause the game and you can't turn the sound off with the Help 
key (just turn the volume on the monitor down like I did!)
