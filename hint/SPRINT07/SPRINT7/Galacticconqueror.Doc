THE STORY

After Peace on Earth was finally achieved, a rebel movement was formed.
Their goal:  to take absolute power.  The government was forced to engage in
galactic fights in order to protect the interplanetary military base,
GALLION.

The Stellar League was created to protect GALLION.  The League's technicians
had just put the final touch to a breakthrough in modern development, the
Galactic Fighter THUNDER CLOUD II, with a firepower ten thousand times
superior to its ancestor's, THUNDER CLOUD, and a negative ionization ultra-
sensoriel protection shield.

One major problem remained:  to find a pilot.  After searching for several
months, the League's scientists realized that the champions of the OFF SHORE
Game, who possessed technique, stunning strategy and reflexes, were the most
qualified to pilot THUNDER CLOUD II.

Lake Baikal, Siberia - June 2080.
YOU, the new champion of the OFF SHORE battle, are offered a mission of
extreme importance:  annihilate the enemies of Peace throughout the Galaxy.

You will receive ten million dollars if you accept!

In order to be part of the Galactic Squadron, you will have to go through
extremely intensive training.  Once you have passed all the tests, you will
attain the rank of Conqueror.  You will then have to be capable of the
highest strategy and skill to succeed.

Your life will be in danger at all times and also, for each fight you will be
engaged in, the lives of millions will be at stake!

Never let the enemy come closer than ten light-years from GALLION, where the
Galaxy's defense weapons and top-secret research information are stored.  Any
wrong decision on your part could mean destruction for GALLION, and the end
of the era of Peace...

YOUR MISSION

A brand new Conqueror, YOU enter the Mother-Ship which will take you to
GALLION where the best equipment will allow you to detect enemy positions
throughout the Galaxy.  Through the surveillance probe, you will get
information regarding the 416 planets of the interstellar group, as well as
the names and codes of enemy ships.

We advise you to select groups of planets which are under enemy domination
(red planets) or very far from ally planets (blue planets).

At all times, you will have to be aware of the way the invasion is
progressing, in order not to leave the blue planets which are near GALLION
without protection, in front of a large number of assailants.

While in mission, you will be followed by the surveillance probe which will
allow you to be teleported at once if you need it, and will give you a
digitalized view of the fight (F8 key).

THUNDER CLOUD II is equipped with a protection shield which gets reinforced
after each conflict.  You will be kept informed on the condition of your
shield which is displayed in the top right of the screen. As your shield is
depleted the blue coating recedes towards the center of the shield, and once
the coating has gone your shield has been destroyed and the next hit will
destroy your space fighter!  A bright halo surrounding the fighter will
indicate that the shield has received a violent impact:  in case of
destruction of the shield, the pilots are teleported at once to the Mother
Ship before THUNDER CLOUD II explodes.  Since an unlimited number of fighters
is available to you, you can select a less dangerous planet and go back
immediately.

Each mission includes the 3 following stages:

1.  The ground fight:
You will be confronted with mines, probe-robots, missiles and also
meteorites. At the end of the ground fight you will be automatically brought
back to the Mother Ship to have your shield reloaded and THUNDER CLOUD II
repaired.

2.  The aerial fight:
Doing tail-pins, (tail Spins ?) you will encounter the Enemy space Army,
missiles and meteorites.

Attention!
Your shield will be damaged according to your enemy's firepower.

Once rid of all your aerial enemies, you will go back to the Mother Ship to
have your shield reinforced and THUNDER CLOUD II repaired before the third
stage.

3.  The space fight:
You will fight the last of the space enemy troops and then be transported
back to the Mother Ship.

Attention!
During the space fight you may encounter the Imperial Enemy Ship, going from
planet to planet, delivering troops.  It is impossible to detect, you will
not be warned before it appears.  Because of the threat it presents, the
League will offer an extra bonus for its destruction.

After the space fight you will be brought back to the Mother Ship, examine
the map of the Galaxy to evaluate enemy progression and select a new planet
to defend according to priority.  For each new mission you will have to win
the 3 fight stages.

Remember that GALLION is constantly threatened:  a wrong strategic choice
could be fatal to it.

2.  a red planet near GALLION has been invaded.
3.  One of the 4 planets in the corners of the Galaxy has been invaded.
4.  An ally (blue) planet is surrounded by enemy planets.
