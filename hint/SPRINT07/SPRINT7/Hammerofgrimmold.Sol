The  aim of the game is to find the Hammer Of Grimmold and return it to the
King.

Examine  each person you meet to ascertain if he/they are friendly and then
SAY  GRIMMOLD to show that you too are a friend of the Dwarves. There is no
need to examine the drunken traveller, though, just steady him and get your
reward.  Kick loose stones to turn up a coin. Move a large rock and someone
is  waiting  there  for  that  coin. Eat your reward and you are now strong
enough  to  roll  the  Giant  and  find  the  boots. Wear them to cross the
stepping stones. Open the coffin, get the cross and the lid.

Go  into the hut and get the lamp, examine it and then light it. Look under
the  hut to find the lost sharpening stone then give it to the Woodsman and
receive  an  axe in return. If you have already been in the Inn and had the
door shut in your face, you can now go and smash it down with the axe. When
you  first go into the Inn the Landlord will call you, sit down and examine
him.  Saying  Grimmold now will empty the Inn of everyone except the Hooded
Men.  If  you  do not go immediately out when you stand up one of them will
kill you.

On  entering  the  Inn  a second time, after smashing the door, examine the
floor  twice  to  find  a  black hood and a crowbar. Wear the hood and then
examine  the  Landlord to find his keys. On your first visit to the Inn you
noticed  a trapdoor, but there's no sign of it now! Oh well, let's move the
Landlord; so that's where it was!! Unlock the trapdoor and go down into the
cellar, unlock the chest and get the Sunstone, examine it and wear it. Drop
the keys as they are no longer needed.

Once  out of the Inn proceed to the large oak tree, examine it. It seems to
be hollow but grunting noises come from the North. Go North and examine the
Troll. You cannot pass him so CAST LIGHT AT TROLL to turn him to stone, now
hit  him with your crowbar and he turns to dust. Remember that the Landlord
told you that you would need troll's dust to defeat Valk.

Once  past the Troll you can now visit the cave, making sure that your lamp
is  lit  and  that  you  are wearing the black hood - failure to do so will
result  in  death at the hands of a hooded man. If you are wearing the hood
he  will  acknowledge  you  and  drop  a  knife as he leaves. Now go to the
dwarves  building the bridge across the chasm. You will find that they need
some  timber  to  complete the construction so give them the coffin lid and
you will now be able to cross the chasm.

Confronted  by a Wizard, tied to a tree with a rope, you will find that all
your  attempts  to  free him by conventional means will fail. CAST LIGHT AT
ROPE will do the trick and now the magical rope is yours. Go to the site of
the  nest  on  a  ledge and throw the rope. Climb rope, examine the nest to
find  a  diamond. Down the rope and take it. If you had read the message on
the  table  in  the  Inn  you  will have deduced that you are going to meet
someone who is very fond of diamonds.

The  Orc  Archers guarding the approach to the Citadel cannot be passed. If
you attempt to use the Sunstone on them it will quickly lose it's power. If
you try to pass them you will be killed so you must find another entry.

Now  go  to  the  oak tree and climb it. GO HEART or ENTER TREE. Go down to
find  a  large  rock  barring  the way, CAST LIGHT AT ROCK will blast it to
smithereens but the Sunstone is finished. Go to the rubbish tip and examine
the  rubbish  and  then smell rubbish to find a piece of cheese. Be careful
not  to  eat  it  though  you  may taste it if you wish. Once on top of the
rubbish  throw  the  rope  and  then climb rope. Get the rope again, do the
usual  things  to  the  dwarf  to  receive  an  Orc's  uniform then wear it
immediately. Go up and into the dark dungeon with the skeleton. Examine the
grille and pull the string to find an empty flagon.

Once outside go to the sleeping Orc and examine him. Do NOT attempt to pass
him  -  yet!!  Find your way to the Gigantic Orc at the foot of the stairs.
Give  him the diamond and take the master key. Up, west and South takes you
into  a  room  with  a chute in the Southern wall. Go South and find a Wine
Cellar.  Fill your flagon and go to the sleeping Orc then PLACE FLAGON NEAR
ORC. Go back some time later when he is drunk. You will now find the key to
the  cell  below.  Don't forget to do the usual with the dwarves before you
unlock  the  chains  or  you will not receive a pair of forceps. You should
also have been given an onion.

Now go Up to the next floor and go up to the entrance to Valk's Chambers to
find  out what you must do before gaining admission, by reading the notice.
Unlocking  the  various  locked doors will reveal a Vampire, a Giant Rat, a
Dragon  and  a  bottle  with  a  Genie  in it. Throwing the cross kills the
Vampire,  dropping  the  cheese kills the Rat, peeling the onion gets you a
Dragon's  scale and pulling the cork on the Genie's bottle gets you a wish.
To  get  a  Vampire's  tooth,  carry  the dead Vampire and place him in the
dentist's  chair.  If  you are carrying the forceps the Dentist will appear
and pull a tooth for you.

Once  you  have  the  tooth,  rat's tail, wish and Dragon's scale, go up to
Valk's  Chambers.  Before  you  ring  the  bell make sure that you have the
Troll's  dust  and  the magical rope. Ring the bell and then go North to be
confronted  by  Valk  and  two  armed Orcs. THROW DUST will blind Valk, now
throw  the  rope. This will coil around Valk's neck and choke him to death,
and the two Guards will run off.

Now get the Hammer and go to the dwarf village, hand the Hammer to the King
and your quest is ended!!
