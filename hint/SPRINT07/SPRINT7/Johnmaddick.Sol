        THIS TIME THE WHOLE SOLUTION..TO SEE THE NUDE SABRINA..  
     
Let's start. 
At first you're in John's computer room. 
LOOK around in this room and view the monitor. 
Don't answer the phone, your pal won't stop talking.. 
Try not to be killed by yar parents (Fresh sharpened knife.) 
Search for a parachute to which is in the drawer.
LOOK window and GET fly, don't look at it first, coz your sight
will kill the fly.
WEAR the parachute and jump out.
Give money to the most beautiful gal ya've ever seen who is  
standing downstairs. 
You get a picture of her sister(nice piccy Dave,yar girlfriend?)
Afterwards move towards the beautifarm... 
Give the photo which ya became from the pretty girl to the nice 
chick who is blocking yar way.. 
Then enjoy yar self inside from a terrific slide show. 
Leave the farm and go to the supermarket. 
TAKE the green persil whilst there is no "new dobbelman" with
activas in it .
Try to screw the cassiere..!!..
As a reward you get a screw driver from her.
Walk into the bathroom and WASH YOURSELF.
Since you are little go to your computer room .
OPEN your Amiga 2000 with the 8MB memory.
Then type N.
LOOK GIRL, for a better view.
TALK girl and type N again.
And her she is.....SAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABRRRRINAAAAAAA..
