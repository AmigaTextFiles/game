                               WEATHER WATCHER
                              =================        TYPED BY SHARD
                                                        17-11-93

BEFORE YOU START
================

Before  using  any of the programs, please make backup copies of your disks
and  lock  away  your master disks.  That way, if you ever damage your disk
you can always make a fresh working copy.

Computer Viruses
----------------

Sharing  disks with friends has become the major cause for the rapid spread
of  computer  viruses.   Some of these are fairly harmless but nevertheless
annoying.   Others  are  very  nasty  and  will  show varying symptoms from
diskettes   not   loading  unless  not  write  protected,  diskettes  being
destroyed,  programs  not  loading  or  crashing.  Once you have a virus in
amongst  your  disks  they  are  difficult  to  get rid of, not to say time
consuming.   imagine  spending  hours creating a story only to lose it all.
Imagine collecting a years worth of data for a project and losing all that.
Don't  risk  it.   Be extremely careful who you take disks from.  And don't
give  disks  away.  If you already have a virus in amongst your disks, your
friends will not thank you for corrupting their disks

NOTE:
----

If  you  have  a 512K Amiga with an additional external disk drive, you may
have  to  disconnect  that  drive  before you can load some of the enclosed
programs.

TERMINOLOGY
-----------

In  this document, to click on something means to move the mouse pointer to
and item and then press the left mouse button.  To double click is to press
the left mouse button twice rapidly.

Some  of  the  programs take quite some time to load, please be patient and
NEVER take a disk out if the green disk light is on


NOTES:
======

If you have a 512k A500 Amiga with an additional disk drive to save memory,
you should switch off the external drive, before running WEATHER WATCHER.

WEATHER  WATCHER is designed to load itself or to be loaded from a standard
Amiga  workbench  by  "double  clicking"  on  its icon.  Unless you have an
extended  memory Amiga we recommend you simply turn on your machine and put
the  working  copy  of your WEATHER WATCHER disk.  REMEMBER - you should be
using a working copy, Not the Master Disk supplied in your pack.

Keymap
------

If  your  Workbench  is  a  version  before 1.3 you may need to change your
keymap  to the 1.3 GB version.  A copy of this is provided on the "Weather"
disk  and should be incorporated in your Workbench setup by transferring it
to your Devs:keymaps subdirectory and using "Setmap GB".

Printers
--------

The Devs/Printers directory on your "Weather" disk must contain the correct
driver  for  your  printer.   If  you  are having printing trouble check to
ensure  that  the correct driver is present.  If not you should install the
necessary  driver  in Weather:Devs/Printers by copying the appropriate file
from  your  Workbench  disk or Extras disk.  Of course you also have to set
your "Preferences" to reflect the new printer driver.

Introduction
------------

This  program  allows you to save data relating to daily weather conditions
into  a  specialised  database.   Once collected, you can display your data
either  in  tabular or graphical form.  If graphical is chosen, the program
displays  two  graphs  at  the same time, enabling you to compare different
data types.  Data can be displayed in daily, monthly or yearly detail.

Additionally  the  disk contains some computer graphics and animations that
have  been  designed  and  included  to  encourage  you  to experiment with
creating your own weather maps.

Any of the data or graphical displays can be printed out if required.

When  entering  data, faulty data will be reprinted in RED and you will NOT
be allowed to progress until you have made good the doubtful data.


THE DATABASE
============

When the program starts up it will automatically try to load a weather data
file  named  "THISYEAR"  (located in the "DATA" directory).  Whilst you can
save as many different files as you wish, with whatever names you wish, you
should  always rename your current file "THISYEAR" so that the software can
load it on startup.

Fictional Data - 1995
---------------------

In order for you to get a feel for how the program works we have included a
fictitious  partial  weather  data file for 1995.  This file has been named
"THISYEAR"  as  explained  above,  and  it autoloads when you enter WEATHER
WATCHER  for the first time (and until you save your actual data file under
the name THISYEAR).

The  best way to see all the features of WEATHER WATCHER is to start up the
program,  which  will  automatically  load the "pretend" 1995 weather file.
This will enable you to try everything out.

Looking at a day's data
-----------------------

While you have any given day's data displayed, by clicking in the main data
box (the centre of the screen), the data will be displayed graphically.

Making Your Own Weather Map
---------------------------

On  your "Weather" master disk you will find a directory called "MAP" which
you  will  find  the files which create the Weather Map display seen at the
start of the program.  These were created using Deluxe Paint.

If  you  want to create your own animated Map display all you have to do is
replace any or all of these files by your own modified versions.  (You MUST
keep  the  names  and  directory pathname identical).  Don't forget to make
backups  on  another disk BEFORE you start making changes.The files you can
change are:

Font.Pic  :   Contains  the large rainbow colored letters.  The colours are
automatically  generated  by  the  WEATHER  WATCHER  software,  the letters
themselves  are  merely single-coloured shapes.  You can modify the letters
but each letter must remain in its own position!

Message.Txt:   The  large scrolling text, you can change this with any word
processor.   NOTE  the  first  character  must  be  0 or 1 (0 turns off the
"balloons"  display,  1 turns it on) and the last character MUST be a $.(If
the file is simply "0 $" you get no text and no balloons!!)

Overlay.Pic:   This is a "transparent" overlay which holds the symbols that
are  superimposed  over your map.  Use DPaint to move the symbols around or
create  your  own  new  ones.   Remember that the background colour will be
transparent,  and  that  the  other colours will be "cycled" to produce the
animation effects.

WeatherMap.Pic:   This  is the backdrop Map.  Use Deluxe Paint to change or
modify it.

Don't  forget  that you can use this to create any other animated displays,
not necessarily representing a Weather Map.
