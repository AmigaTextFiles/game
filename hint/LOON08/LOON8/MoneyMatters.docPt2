 Further drawers may be accessed in the same way and will be separated by
a slash (/) when added to the Drawer text box. To move back to the
previous drawer level click the Parent button.

 Another way to select the drawer or filename is to type the drawer and
filename directly into the appropriate boxes.

 In the File text  box you type the name of the file you wish to open.
However, you can insert a filename automatically by clicking the name you
require in the list box. If you double-click a filename in the list box,
Money Matters will automatically open the file.

 When you open a file, Money Matters will check if any "Regular
transactions" are due and process them if necessary. If, as a result, an
Account exceeds the minimum or maximum balance warnings you set, a
warning will appear.

7.1.4 Save
----------
  Choose Save command (Project menu), or press Right Amiga-S. Saves the
current file, under the same path, replacing the previous version.

 You will be requested to confirm any file you selected to delete.

7.1.7 Open Comparatives
-----------------------
 Choose "Open comparatives" (Project menu).

 Shows a requester to open comparatives from an existing file.

 Comparatives are the monthly totals of Income and Expenditure Types,
which are loaded from an existing file. The comparative figures will be
displayed alongside actual figures in the "Budget progress" report and
included in various budget graphs. Comparatives are ideal for comparing
current Income and Expenditure figures with a previous year.

 The list box shows all files and drawers (subdirectories, labelled
(Drawer)), in the currently selected drawer.  Below this are  two boxes,
Drawer and File. To the right are four buttons: OK, Volume, Parent and

previous drawer level click the Parent button.


 Another way to select the drawer or filename is to type the drawer and
filename directly into the appropriate boxes.

 In the File text  box you type the name of the file from which you wish
to loan comparatives. However, you can insert a filename automatically by
clicking the name you require in the list box. If you double-click a
filename in the list box, Money Matters will automatically open the file.

 You can load figures from an existing file for inclusion in the "Budget
progress" report or the graphs. It is particularly useful for comparing
one year's expenditure with a previous year.

7.1.8 Clear Comparatives
------------------------

file and quits Home Accounts2, returning to the Workbench.

                                PAGE 111
7.2 Edit Menu
-------------
 You use the Edit menu to process transactions and items.

7.2.1 Add
---------
 Choose Add command (Edit menu), or press Right Amiga-A. Adds a
transaction or item to the current window.

7.2.2 Amend
-----------
 Choose Amend command (Edit menu), or press Right Amiga-M.

 Highlight the transaction or item you wish to amend and choose Amend.
Alternatively, double-click the transaction or item.

7.2.3 Delete
------------
 Choose Delete command (Edit menu), or press Right Amiga-D.

 Highlight the transaction or item you wish to delete and choose Delete.
You can also delete by pressing the Delete key or by dragging the
transaction or item to the Dustbin.

 Deleted transactions and items can be recovered from the Dustbin (by
dragging them into the appropriate window). However, if "Automatically
empty Trashcan" is selected (General-Preferences, Options menu), they
will be permanently removed.

7.2.4 Sort
----------
 Choose sort command (Edit menu) or press Right Amiga-T

 See Figure 7-3  "Sort manual transactions" requester

                                PAGE 112

 The Sort requester appears. From the cycle buttons, select the Header on
which you wish to sort, and then the Order (ascending or descending) on
the top edit window and re-sort the items.

7.2.5 Find
----------
 Choose Find command (Edit menu), or press Right Amiga-F.

 Money Matters provides comprehensive searching facilities.

 See Figure 7-4  "Find manual transactions" requester

 A requester displays the boxes available on which you can search.

 You type in the text entry boxes what you wish to search for and then
click the appropriate check boxes to switch them on. Money Matters does
not discriminate between upper and lower case when searching.

 In this way, you can search on more than one box at a time. For example,
you wish to find a transaction of Type HK which occurred on 31/03/1991.

 In the Type box you type HK and in the Date box you enter 31/03/1991.
You then click the Type and Date check boxes and then click OK.

 But imagine you wanted to search for a transaction and all you
remembered is that the Reference contained a name, Mr Smith. But you
can't remember how the name was spelt. Was it Smyth or Smith?

                                PAGE 113

 With Money Matters you can use 'wildcards'. These are special letters
which you use when you can't remember exactly what you want to find. They
work like this:

 LETTER   MEANS

 ?        Matches any character
 *        Matches zero or more occurrences of the preceding character
 +        Matches one or more occurrences of the preceding character

 In the case of Mr Smith, you would enter Mr Smi?th. This means Money
Matters will find every word Mr Sm th. Here are a few more examples:

 PATTERN         FINDS
 -------------   --------------------------------
 fund            fund, funds, refund, refunds
 mil*ward        millward, milward, milllward
 a?c             abc, afc, azc

 If you wish to find one of the wildcard letters (that is ?, *, +), you
can do this by preceding the letter with a backslash (). For example, to
search for Smith? you would enter Smith?.

 When you have set your search criteria, click OK. The first transaction
to match the search criteria will be highlighted. If no transactions can
be found the screen will flash.

7.2.6 Find Again
----------------
 Choose "Find again" command (Edit menu), or press Right Amiga-G.

 This will find the next transaction to meet the search criteria you set
using the Find command.

7.2.7 Find and Replace
----------------------
 Choose "Find and replace" command (Edit menu), or press Right Amiga-R.

 Use this command to search for transactions in which you wish to replace
some of the information. For example, you may have typed several
transactions with the Reference Business expense and wish to replace this
text with Business expenses for company A.

 It works in the same way as the Find command. A requester appears and
you enter your search criteria.

 However, when you click OK, another requester appears for you to enter
your replacement criteria.

 Additionally, there are three radio buttons at the bottom of the
requester which operate as follows:

                                PAGE 114

 BUTTON              DOES
 ------------------- -------------------------------------
 Replace once        Finds and replaces one entry
 Confirm replace     Finds and you confirm each entry
 Replace all         Finds and replaces all entries.

 When using "Confirm replace", each transaction will be highlighted and
an alert will appear with the options:

 BUTTON               DOES
 -------------------- --------------------------------------
 Yes                  Replace item
 No                   Do not replace, continue finding
 Cancel               Abandon "Find and replace" command

7.2.8 Empty Dustbin
-------------------
 Choose "Empty dustbin" command (Edit menu).

 This command permanently removes any items in the dustbin.

7.3 SETUP

particularly useful to warn you of bank charges or if you exceed your
credit card limit. You enter the maximum and minimum figures and switch
on the facility by clicking the check boxes. The warnings allow for all
manual transactions and regular transactions.

                                PAGE 116

 Warnings can operate on Reconciled or Unreconciled balances.
(See  Section 7.7.9,  "General Preferences".)

 Type: This is a cycle button from which you select the type of Account.
This can be Cash, Cheque, "Credit card" or Savings. For clarity, each
Type has a different style of icon:

 See Figure 7-6  Account icons

 Icon title: This is the title for the icon on the desktop.

 Cheque number: If appropriate, enter your current cheque number from
your cheque book. When you add a transaction to this Account, if you
press F8 when editing the cheque number box, Home Accounts2 will add the
cheque number. When adding transactions, the number automatically
increases by one each time you press F8.

 To activate the Notepad press F10. You can enter up to eight lines of
information pertaining to the Account.

 The number of Accounts you can set up is only limited by the memory of

 A window opens in which you can add, amend, delete and sort Types using
the commands from the Edit menu.

 When you add a Type, you enter the abbreviation and a description. These
are abbreviations, which may be up to four characters, used by Money
Matters to describe different groups of income or expenditure. They are

 Types are used in various areas of Money Matters, including "Regular
transactions", "Manual transactions" and Budget.

 The number of Types you can set up is only limited by the memory of your
Amiga.

 If you are registered for VAT (tax), and have set this option using the
General command (Settings menu), you will be prompted to type a "VAT
code" (see "VAT code" command). If you press F9 a requester appears which
displays the VAT rates).

 Press F10 to activate the Notepad.

                                PAGE 118
7.3.5 Transaction Markers
-------------------------
 Choose "Transaction markers" command ("Set up" menu), or double-click
the Markers icon.

 "Transaction markers" are like book marks. You set a one character code
and a description. Then, when you add transactions you can enter the
marker so that each transaction has an additional reference.

 For example, you could use one marker for your transactions relating to
buying petrol, and another for your partner. Then, using commands from
the Reports menu, you can print separate reports on petrol expenditure
for you and your partner.

 Press F10 to activate the Notepad facility.

7.3.6 Regular Transactions
--------------------------
 Choose "Regular transactions" command ("Set up" menu), or double-click
the Regular icon.

 A window appears listing the existing "Regular transactions".

 "Regular transactions" are transactions that appear regularly, like a
Standing Order, a Direct Debit or mortgage repayment.

 When you choose Add or Amend, the following requester appears.

 See Figure 7-7  "Add regular transactions" requester

 "Start date": The starting date of the transaction. Money Matters will
automatically post any transactions due between the "Start date" and the
current system date.

                                PAGE 119

 "End date": The expiry date of the transaction.

 Type: The income or expenditure Type you set up.

 Reconciled: Transaction reconciled. The box should contain an asterisk
(*) if the transaction is considered reconciled.

 A transaction becomes reconciled when you have confirmation that the
transaction has been completed (for example, when a cheque payment
appears on your bank statement). If a transaction is not reconciled, you
should leave this box blank.

 By identifying the difference between reconciled and unreconciled
transactions, Money Matters gives you both methods. You have an accurate
Account balance (reflecting every transaction), and an actual Account
balance (reflecting only transactions which have been completed).
( See Section 7.4.3,  "Reconcile...", for further information.)

 Frequency: The frequency is in two parts, in the cycle button you select
the units (either days, weeks or months), and in the text entry box you
enter the number of units. For example, if you wanted to set a payment
once a quarter, you would set the cycle button to Months, and enter 3 in
the Frequency text entry box.

 From: The "Account code" from where the transaction is debited.

 To: The "Account code" to where the transaction is credited.

 If you forget the "Account codes" you set up, press F9 for a simple
memory jogger. A requester will appear listing the available "Account
codes". Simply click your selection from the list box and the "Account
codes" will be automatically entered. If the "Account code" you require
is not displayed (and therefore does not exist), you can add another
Account by clicking Add.

 Reference: Your own reference for the transaction.

 Debit: The amount to be debited, or

 Credit: The amount to be credited.

 Marker: The marker code.

 VAT: The VAT code.

 Press F10 to activate the Notepad facility.

 "Regular transactions" are handled automatically. Every time you start
Money Matters, it is essential to enter the correct date, as this date
will be compared with the previous date (when you previously saved the
file), and then any "Regular transactions" falling between the dates will
be posted.

 If you amend a "Regular transaction", the previous postings will be
unaffected.

                                PAGE 120

 The number of "Regular transactions" you can set up is only limited by
the memory of your Amiga.

 There are a couple of important points to remember when entering
"Regular transactions":

  Remember, when adding "Regular transactions", they are instantly back-
dated to the "Start date" as soon as you finish entering the transaction.

7.3.7 Budget
------------
 Choose Budget command ("Set up" menu), or double-click the Budget icon.

 A window appears listing the existing Budget.

 This provides a simple method to allow for fluctuations, such as
inflation, for example.

 Start month cycle button: The starting month for budgeting.

 End month cycle button: The expiry date of the budgeting.

 Start value: The figure to start budgeting.

 Inc/Dec: The monthly value to increase or decrease the previous month's
figure. If you select the % check box, the value will be assumed a
percentage.

 Divide over months: This divides the "Start value" by number of months.

 Add values: Adds "Inc/Dec value" to "Start value".

 Subtract value: Subtracts "Inc/Dec value" from the "Start value".

 Click OK to calculate the monthly budget figures.

 If you forget the "Account codes" you set up, press F9 for a simple
memory jogger. A requester will appear listing the available "Account
codes". Simply click your selection from the list box and the "Account
code" will be automatically entered. If the "Account code" you require is
not displayed (and therefore does not exist), you can add another Account
by clicking Add.

 You can only use this command with "manual transactions".

 See Figure 7-11  "Manual transactions window headers" requester

 From the requester, you can select to show or hide the various
transaction headings. This means that you can remove any surplus columns
and reduce the display width to fit the window. Money Matters will store
the entire transaction information you enter, regardless of which
headings are displayed.

 The heading settings are independent for each Account and stored
automatically with your file.


7.3.11 Function Keys..

Money Matters keyboard shortcuts.

 To set the Function key, click the key required (F1 to F10). The current
value for the key will be displayed in the boxes Control and Alternate.
These boxes represent the two keys used in combination with the Function
keys.

 Marker: Either type a marker in the box, or select "Last entered" by
switching on the check box.

 With Money Matters, VAT options only appear if you have switched on the
VAT facility (Preferences command, Options menu).

7.4.2 Add or Amend
------------------
 Choose "Add or amend" command (Trans menu), or double click the
appropriate Account icon.

 You use this command to add "Manual transactions".

 If you have set up more than one Account, a list box appears. Click the
Account for which you wish to enter transactions.

 The Account window appears, showing the current transaction details
together with a running balance. If a transaction you entered is not
included in the balance, this is probably because it has not been
reconciled (by typing an asterisk in the reconciled box). If you prefer
to display all of the transactions, regardless of reconciliation, there
is an option in General (Settings menu).

 You can modify the columns to your preference using the "Window headers"
command ("Set up" menu).

 When you choose Add or Amend, the following requester appears.

 See Figure 7-14  "Add manual transactions" requester

 Transactions will be displayed in colour on colour systems, if the
balance for the Account is below zero.

 Date: The date of the transaction.

 Type: The income/expenditure Type.

 There are two reserved types:

 TRAN for transferring between Accounts. If selected, a list box appears
and you can click the Account to which you wish to transfer the amount.
Money Matters only recognises the first 3 characters, that is TRA. The
fourth character is discretional This gives you the opportunity to Budget
against several Types of TRAN transactions (for example, TRA1, TRA2).

 SPLT for splitting a transaction across up to 20 different Types. If
selected, a requester appears and you can enter the allocations.

 Reconciled: The Reconciled box tells Money Matters whether or not a
transaction has been reconciled with a statement. You type an asterisk
(*) if the transaction is reconciled.

 Reference: Your own reference.

 Ref number: The "Ref number" box is used if the transaction was paid by
cheque. You can enter this manually, or press F8 to automatically insert
the next consecutive number.

 Debit: Enter amount.
         OR
 Credit: Enter amount.

 You use the Debit box to pay out money, or the Credit box to pay in
money to your Account.

 M: Your Marker code.

 VAT: Your VAT code, if applicable.

 When editing either the Type, Marker or "VAT code" boxes, if you press
F9, a list box reminder appears. Click on the item in the list box to
make your selection. If, however, the item does not appear in the list
box, click Add to set up the item.

 Press F10 to activate the Notepad facility

7.4.3 Reconcile
---------------
 Choose Reconcile command (Trans menu).

 Once you have opened an Account window (double-click an Account icon),
you use this command to identify Reconciled or Unreconciled "Manual
transactions".

                                PAGE 129

 See Figure 7-15  "Reconcile/unreconcile manual transactions" requester

 Start date : Enter the starting date of period.

 End date : Enter the end date of period.

 Set the radio button to Reconcile or Unreconcile.

 Confirm each one : If this check box is selected, Money Matters will ask
you to confirm each reconciliation or unreconciliation.

7.4.4 Delete
------------
 Choose Delete command (Trans menu).

 Once you have opened an Account window (double-click an Account icon),
you use this command to delete a range of transactions (to delete a
single transaction, it is quicker to drag it to the Dustbin).

7.4.5 Auto Balance
------------------
 Choose "Auto balance" command (Trans menu).

 Once you have opened an Account window (double-click an Account icon),
you use this command to determine which transactions should be
reconciled.

                                PAGE 130

 For Money Matters to work correctly, you will need to make a note of the
following information on your bank (or other) statement:

  * The date of the first transaction.

  * The date of the last transaction.

  * The closing balance.

  * The number of transactions.

Now enter this information like this:

 Start Date: The first transaction date.

 End date: The last transaction date.

 Target balance: The closing balance.

 Number of transactions: The number of transactions.

 If you have a large number of transactions, this command may take
several minutes. If you wish to interrupt and cancel the command, press
the Esc key.

7.4.6 Auto Balances Again
-------------------------
 Choose "Auto balance again" command (Trans menu).

 If the previous "Auto balance" calculation was incorrect, you can use
this command to try again. Money Matters may not get the auto balance
correct first time if there is more than one way of reconciling your
transactions.

 However, Money Matters will tell you when there are no more combinations
for auto balancing.


7.4.7 What if?
--------------

 Choose "What if? command (Trans menu).

 This is used to make financial projections into the future, which can
help you plan your cashflow more easily.

 Type the date up to which you wish to project. Money Matters will then
process all regular transactions up to the projected date. At this point
the Save command is disabled to prevent you accidentally overwritting
your original file.

 After experimenting with the projections you can return to your original
file by choosing "What if?" again. If you wish to store the projections,
you will need to switch on the option "Save projections", which is
accessed using the File command (Settings menu).

 Once saved, a projection file can be loaded just like a normal data
file.

                                PAGE 131
7.5 REPORT MENU
---------------
General
-------
 Before printing, it is always a good idea to save your file. Then check
your printer for the following:

  * That it is properly connected to your Amiga.

  * That paper is loaded.

  * That it is plugged in and turned on.

  * That it is "on-line".

 Money Matters uses the printer driver and settings as configured in your
Amiga System Preferences.

 With Money Matters, you can print graphs and save them as IFF format.

 To interrupt a report whilst printing, or being displayed on the screen,
press the Esc key.

 When you choose a command from the Report menu, there are several
options common to each command:

  * Screen radio button: Displays the report on the screen.

  * Printer radio button: Prints the report.

  * File radio button: Saves a graph on disk in IFF format, or
    ASCII format for a list report. The file selector requester
    appears for you to enter the path and filename.

  * Format button: This lets you change the configuration for
    the report header, footer and body.


Format Header and Footer
------------------------
 Headers are printed at the top of each page after the top margin, and
footers are printed at the bottom of each page before the bottom margin.

 This requester appears, which is the same for configuring the header or
footer:

 Text: This is where you enter the text for the header (up to 132
characters if you are using a wide carriage printer). You can also use
these special codes:

 CODE            DOES
 --------------- --------------------------------------------------
 ~PAGENUM        Page number
 ~DATE           System date
 ~TIME           System time
 ~ACCNAME        Name of the report Account
 ~ACCNUMBER      Account number of the report
 ~ACCCODE        Account code of the report
 ~ACCOPENBAL     Opening balance of the report Account
 ~STARTDATE      Start date, if defined in the search criteria
 ~ENDDATE        End date, if defined in the search criteria

                                PAGE 132

 The last two codes are used when you are producing a report based upon a
date range.

 Codes and text may be mixed in headers and footers.

 You can then set the justification, pitch and style for the Text line
using the boxes below.

 If you wish to add more than one Text line, click Insert. If you enter
multiple lines, you use the buttons at the bottom of the requester:

 Previous: Go to previous Text line.

 Next: Go to next Text line.

 Delete: Delete the line which appears in the Text box.

 Insert: Insert another Text line before the current line in the
        Text box.

 The justification, pitch and style settings are independent for each
Text line.

 You can add any number of header and footer lines, provided you leave
sufficient space for the report body.


Format Report Body
------------------
 The list box displays the column headings, which you can select, or
deselect by clicking the headings.

 To include the Notepad facility, click the check box below the list box.

 You can then set the justification, pitch and style for the report body
using the boxes to the right of the list box.

 Some reports will naturally extend beyond the width of your printer.
However, using these configuration options, you can customise every
report to best suit your printer.

 The boxes operate as follows:

 "Opening balance", enter starting balance for transaction

 Periods, the time period unit (either years, months or weeks)

                                PAGE 145

7.6.6 Amiga Workbench Open
--------------------------
 Choose "Amiga Workbench open" command (System menu).

 Toggles the Amiga Workbench screen on or off (indicated by a check
mark). Switching the Amiga Workbench off will provide at least 32K
extra memory for Money Matters to use.



 To close Amiga Workbench there must be no open windows, for example
other programs, Shell (CLI) windows (the Amiga Workbench disk drawer
windows are not affected).

 If you want to close the Amiga Workbench on opening Money Matters, turn
Amiga Workbench off with this command, and then save Preferences from the
Preferences command (Options menu).

a new Shell (or CLI), ready for direct DOS commands. This is useful for
formatting a new data disk, deleting files on a disk, and so on.

 To quit the Shell (CLI) enter Endcli and click the screen front to back
gadgets to bring the Money Matters screen to the front.

 (For further information on Shells (CLI) see your Amiga owners guide.)

 Choose "Create icons" command (Setting menu).

 This command controls the saving of icons when you save files.

7.7.2 Icons
-----------
 You can change the titles for the desktop icons and set which
 icons you wish to be displayed in the desktop.

 Snap to grid: If selected, Money Matters will automatically align the
icons to the nearest character boundary.

7.7.3 Cleanup Desktop
---------------------
 Choose "Clean up desktop" command (Settings menu). This command
rearranges the desktop icons in a neat order. The Trashcan will be
positioned in the bottom left of the desktop.

7.7.4 Arrange Windows
---------------------
 Choose "Arrange windows" command (Options menu). This command lets you
decide how the windows are arranged.

 Stacked: Overlaid, which works like the Workbench desktop.

 Tiled vertically: Windows stacked one above the other.

 Tiled horizontally: Windows displayed side by side.

7.7.5 File
----------
 Choose File command (Setting menu).

 This command lets you set the options for the default drawer location

 Autosave: If selected, Money Matters will automatically save the current
file (with the extension .TMP) after a given period of time which you
enter in the box (minutes). If you do not require this facility,  enter
0.

 Backup files : If selected, when you save a file, the previous version
on disk is renamed with the suffix .bak. This keeps a backup of the last
revision just in case the new file is corrupted. However, this uses about
twice the disk space (since you will be storing two copies of each file).

 Save Projections: When you use the "What if?" command (Trans menu), the
normal Save command (Project menu) is disabled to stop you accidentally
overwritting your original file. This option lets you save the
projections seperately.

7.7.6 Printer
-------------
 Choose printer command (Settings menu).

 Spooler buffer size: A print spooler is provided which lets you continue
using the Money Matters during printing. However, the efficiency of the
spooler depends on the size of the spooler buffer. The spooler size is
defined in Kilobytes (if set to O the spooler is switched off).

 Page length: The number of lines per page, normally set to 66 for 11
inch paper, or 72 for 12 inch paper, or 70 lines for A4.

 Top margin: The number of lines to skip at the top of each page. Usually
set to four.

 Bottom margin: The number of lines to skip at the bottom of each page.
Usually set to four.

 This shows a requester to set the screen colours. The list box shows the
cocktail colour schemes which are available. To change the colour scheme,
click the title you require.

 You can edit the individual colours by selecting them and then moving
the Red, Green and Blue sliders.

 The colours will revert to the default, Distinctly Digita, on re-
opening Money Matters. However, if you wish to permanently save your own
colours, you can do this by clicking Save command from the Settings
menu.

 When an Account falls below zero, the transactions are displayed in the
fourth colour (the available colours are displayed below the list box).
Using the Distinctly Digita palette, the fourth colour is red, and so
negative balances are displayed in red. If you change the palette, the
fourth colour will change accordingly.

7.7.10 Goodies
--------------
 Screen saver: If selected, Money Matters screen saver will automatically
operate after a given period of time which you enter in the box
(minutes). If you do not require this facility, enter 0 .

 The built-in screen saver can protect your monitor. When information
remains static on screen for long periods, this can cause the monitor to
"burn-out" in certain areas. It works by dividing the desktop into small
squares, and then continually moves each square around the screen (if you
do not have enough memory for the screen saver to work, Money Matters
will just  blank the screen).

 The screen saver will start from the time you stop typing (or use the
mouse) plus the time delay you set. The screen is restored as soon as you
press a key or move the mouse, and you will be returned to the desktop,
just as you previously left it.

APPENDIX A - MEMORY AND MONEY MATTERS
-------------------------------------

 Memory is used by Money Matters for storing the program, its information
and the files created with it.

 The following explanations should help you understand where memory is
used, how much memory various commands might need and what to do if the
computer runs out of memory.

What is memory
--------------
 Memory, sometimes referred to as RAM (Random Access Memory) can be
thought of in terms of a large box of a certain volume. The more that is
put into the box, the less space there is free. When commands are removed
from the box, more space is made. Thus, the more programs and information
that are stored in a computer's memory, the less space is available for
storing information. Freeing up information, or quitting a program, will
free more space for use by other programs.

 The amount of memory is measured in bytes. The larger the number the
more memory is available. A Kilobyte is 1024 bytes. A Megabyte is 1024
Kilobytes. A Kilobyte is often referred to as a "K" and Megabytes are
sometimes called a "Meg."

 Money Matters requires 1 MB (Megabyte) of memory. To maximise on the
available memory, do not load other programs. Run Money Matters from the
boot disk. The print spooler buffer should be kept to the default. If
necessary, the spooler can be switched off.

 If the program does run out of memory, you will be given the opportunity
of saving your information before the program quits.





How Money Matters uses memory
-----------------------------
 To check how much free memory is available, use the "About Money
Matters" command (Desk menu).

 The amount of memory used by each item is:

 ITEM                   MEMORY REQUIRED (in bytes)
 ---------------------  --------------------------------
 Type                    64
 Marker                  58
 VAT code                62
 Account                 172
 Budget                  82
 Regular transaction     82
 Manual transaction      74
 Split transaction       38
 Investment              64

                                PAGE 155

 Every Notepad will occupy one byte for each character you enter, plus a
further 8 bytes added to the total.

 Remember, items (such as report header and footer lines) will occupy
additional memory.

 Generally, 1MB of memory provides plenty of space for a typical full
year of transactions.

 Sometimes, you may experience a inexplicable problem with low memory. if
this happens, Money Matters will prompt you to save your file.

 Inexplicable low memory can be due to fragmentation. To overcome this,
save your file, quit Money Matters, and then re-load. Full memory should
be restored.

                        APPENDIX D - TROUBLESHOOTING
                        ============================


Q  After Money Matters prompts for Name,
   Organization and License Number, it quits and I am
   returned to the desktop.

A Money Matters needs to be personalised before you
  can use it. You need to type your Name, Organization
  and License Number. Thereafter, this information is shown
  every time you use the program, confirming that you are the
  licensed user of Money Matters.


Q How can I transfer money between 2 Accounts.

A Use the Type TRAN.


Q When entering transactions, the running balance is not updated.

A To be included in the running balance, the transaction
  should be Reconciled. If you require all transactions to
  be included in the running balance, then switch on "Include
  unreconciled transactions in balance" in the General-
  Preferences command, Options menu.


Q My "Regular transactions" have not been posted.

A This means that at some point, the correct date has not
  been set. Find out the date that the first "Regular
  transaction" should have gone through, and then set the
  system date to the day before. Open your file and then
  immediately save it. Now set the system date to the current
  date and re-open your file. All entries should now be posted
  up-to-date.


Q The same "Regular transaction" has been posted twice.

A At some point the incorrect system date has been
  entered. Simply delete one of the duplicate entries.


Q As I type the screen flashes.

A The keys you are pressing are invalid. For example,
  trying to enter letters in a date box.

                             PAGE 160

Q As I print, unusual characters appear.

A The incorrect printer driver has been installed.



Q I can't print any graphs.

A Check that you have installed the correct printer driver.


Q When configuring reports the different pitches and
  print modes do not work.

A The incorrect printer driver has been installed.


Q Some reports overflow a line.

A Try configuring the report and adjusting the pitch, also
  check the margins and page width are correct in the
  printer preferences.



Q When in a requester, how do I edit a box without
  having to retype it's contents.

A Select the box and press F1


Q How do I print the Notepad.

A To print a Notepad, select "Show Notepad" in the
  appropriate report configuration requester.

Q Money Matters keeps running out of memory.

A Make sure the print spooler is set to O and try removing
  any resident programs. If there is still not enough
  memory, either start a new file or obtain a memory upgrade
  from your local Amiga supplier.

                   APPENDIX E - GETTING TECHNICAL HELP


 Before contacting technical support, check Appendix D, "Troubleshooting"
and the check for a READ.ME document on the MONEY MATTERS disk.

 Although every effort has been made to make Money Matters as easy to use
as possible, with so many different configurations of Amiga hardware,
software, and peripherals, and new products appearing monthly, there may
be important information in the READ.ME document  which affects you. You
would be amazed at some of the letters we receive. For example:

 Dear Digita

  I recently purchased Money Matters for my computer and am very pleased
with it. When printing an extra blank page is used.

 This is very annoying.

  Yours sincerely,

 This letter fails to fully describe the problem, which means we can't
help you. If you need to write to us, follow this example:

 Dear Digita

  I recently purchased Money Matters for my Amiga, my licence number is
982634.

  My computer system comprises an Amiga A200, with a 4MB expansion,
second disk drive and a Hewlet Packard Deskjet 500 Plus printer. I am
using version 3 of Workbench and Money Matters v3, r2.

 When printing a report, after each page printed an extra blank sheet is
fed through the printer. I have enclosed a sample of the file on disk
together with a sample printout.

 I hope the above will be sufficient for you to find a solution, if you
require and further information my day time phone number is 0395 270273.

  Yours sincerely


 It also helps to give a clear explanation of the problem. The offending
file was provided on disk, with a printed copy, which gives a clear
understanding of the problem. A day time number was provided, which
means, in exceptional circumstances, we can telephone if we need further
information, or the solution could be explained better verbally.

 It would really help use to help you if you could follow these steps if
you need to contact us for help.

                                PAGE 162

When telephoning
----------------

 1. Have the following information available:

    * Money Matters license number (you won't get support without it).

    * Amiga System.

    * Workbench version.

    * If you have a printer problem, your printer type and the printer
      driver selected.

 2. Have your Amiga near the telephone and make sure you are able to
reproduce the problem.

When Writing
------------

 1. As above

 2. Give as much information as possible. Explain the fault in detail,
    don't rely on us remembering the telephone conversation.

 3. Enclose a copy of the file that is giving problems, together with a
    copy of the Money Matters prefs file on disk. This file is found on
    your Money Matters disk and should be bragged onto the floppy disk
    icon you are sending us. If it's a printer problem, enclose
    printouts.

 4. Check your disks for viruses before sending them. It is totally
    irresponsible to send computer disks without checking for virus.

 5. Unless specifically requested, do not send the instruction book and
    packaging.

 To remove something, such as a character or word from a file, or a file
from a disk. Keys such as the Backspace key can remove one character at a
time by moving to the left. Delete key can remove one character at a time
by moving to the right. The Cut command removes selected text and places
it on the Clipboard; the Erase command removes selected text without
placing it on the Clipboard. (The Undo command can reverse the action of
Erase and of the Backspace or Delete key if it is used immediately.)

Deselect
--------
 A command to a device such as a printer to place it into a condition in

a disk capacity of 880K.

Disk drive
----------
 The device that holds a disk, retrieves information from it, and saves
information to it.


Double click
------------
 Two clicks in quick succession, interpreted as a single command. The
action of a double click is different from that of a single click. For
example, clicking an icon selects the icon; double-clicking an icon opens
it.

Drag
----
 To position the pointer on something, press and hold the left mouse
button, move the mouse, and release the mouse button. When you release
the mouse button, you either confirm a selection or move an object to a

inside this region moves the window to a new location and makes it the
active window.


Drawer
------
 A holder of files, applications and even other drawers on the desktop.
Drawers act as subdirectories, allowing you to organise information
logically.


Esc key
-------
 A key that generates the escape character. In many applications,
pressing Esc allows you to return to a previous menu or to stop a
procedure. The Esc key can be used with other keys to generate escape
codes.


File
----

 The horizontal strip at the top of the screen that contains menu titles.
Displayed by pressing the Right Mouse key.

Mouse
-----
 A small device you move around on a flat surface next to your computer.
The mouse controls a pointer on the screen whose movements correspond to
those of the mouse. You use the pointer to select operations, to move
data, and to draw with in graphics programs.


Mouse Buttons
-------------
 The buttons on the top of the mouse. In general, pressing the left mouse
button initiates some action on whatever is under the pointer, and
releasing the button confirms the action. Pressing the right mouse button
displays the menu on the title bar. Compare button.

Multitasking
------------
 A process that allows a computer to perform two or more tasks during a
given period of time; it is accomplished by alternating the actions of
the computer between tasks. The method by which operating systems, such
as Workbench, allow the user to open and run several applications at the
same time.

Numeric Keyboard
----------------
 A calculator-style keypad, either built-in or peripheral, that you can
use to type numbers. The layout of numbers on the keypad makes it easier
and faster to use than the regular keyboard. Some application programs
designate the keys of a numeric keypad as special function keys. See also
keyboard.

on-line help
------------
 Assistance you can get from an application program while it's running;
for example, Money Matters disk-based Help system.

Open
----
 To make available. You open files in order to work with them. A file may
not be read from or written to until it is open. In the desktop
interface, opening an icon causes a window with the contents of that icon
to come into view. You may then perform further actions in the window
when it's active.

--------------
 A program that controls the exchange of information between a printer
and the computer. You must have a separate printer driver for each type
of printer that you want to use.

Project Menu
------------
 A menu in mouse-based applications that lists commands that affect whole
file - commands like Save, Print, and Quit.

Prompt
------
 A message on the screen that tells you of some need for response or
action. A prompt is usually in the form of a symbol, a message, a
requester, or a menu of choices.

Pull-down menu
--------------
 A menu that is hidden until you press the right mouse button and move
the pointer to its title.

QWERTY Keyboard
---------------
 The standard layout of keys on a typewriter keyboard; named for the
first six letters on the top row of letter keys.


random access memory (RAM)
---------------------------
 The part of the computer's memory that stores information temporarily
while you're working on it. A computer with 512K RAM has 512 kilobytes of
memory available to the user. Information in RAM can be referred to in an
arbitrary or random order, hence the term random-access. (As an analogy,
a book is a random-access storage device in that it can be opened and
read at any point.) RAM can contain both application programs and your
own information. Information in RAM is temporary, gone forever if you
switch the power off without saving it on a disk or other storage medium.
An exception is the battery RAM, which stores settings such as the time
and which is powered by a battery. (Technically, the read-only memory
(ROM) is also random access, and what's called RAM should correctly be
termed read-write memory.) Compare read-only memory.

Read Only memory (ROM)
----------------------

 Memory whose contents can be read but not changed; used for storing
firmware. Information is placed into read-only memory once, during
manufacture. It remains there permanently, even when the computer's power
is turned off. Compare random-access memory.

Reconciled
----------
 In Money Matters, this refers to any money transaction which you know
has been processed. For example, if you paid for something by credit
card, the transaction is considered Reconciled when the money has been
transferred out of your account. (Normally you would only know this when
you receive your statement and the transaction appears on it.) By
differentiating between Reconciled and Unreconciled transactions, Money
Matters can provide you with both up-to-date account balances, and actual
balances to match the statements you receive. Compare Unreconciled.

                                PAGE 174

Regular Transaction
-------------------
 In Money Matters, this refers to a money transaction which occurs
regularly. For example, standing order to pay off a loan, a monthly
mortgage payment.

Requester
---------
 (1) A box that contains a message requesting more information from you.
Sometimes the message warns you that you're asking your computer to do
something it can't do or that you're about to destroy some of your
information. In these cases, the message is often accompanied by a beep.
(2) A box that an Amiga application displays to request information or to
report that it is waiting for a process to complete.

Reset
-----
 To restore all the default settings for a device with one action or
command.

Resolution
----------
 The degree of clarity of your display. A monitor has better resolution
than a television set used as a monitor. Resolution is usually specified
in dots per inch (dpi). The higher the value, the finer the detail of the

----------
 A key that causes the cursor or insertion point to move to the beginning
of the next line. It's also used in some cases to confirm a command.

Right Amiga key
---------------
 A modifier key that gives a different meaning or action to another key

not saved disappears when you switch off the computer or when the power
is interrupted.

Screen
------
 The part of the monitor where information is displayed. Like a movie
screen, it's the place where things are projected. Also called the
display screen.

Scroll Arrow
------------
 An arrow at either end of a scroll bar. Clicking a scroll arrow moves a

document or directory one line. Pressing a scroll arrow moves a document
continuously.

Scroll Bar
----------
 A rectangular bar that may be along the right or bottom of a window.
Clicking or dragging in the scroll bar causes your view of the document
to change.
