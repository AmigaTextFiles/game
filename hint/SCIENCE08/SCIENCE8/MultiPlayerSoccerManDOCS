General

All keyboard entries should be followed by pressing return, except when using
the function keys. All other selections should be made by joystick or mouse,
depending on which you select (Don't know how the hell you are supposed to use
the mouse for this game, as it was DONGLE protected via the mouse port, and I
can't find any option to select between mouse and joystick)!

Main Menu.

To select each player, press the funtion keys 1-8 for each respective player.

Loading & Saving.

To access these options select the disk icon from the main menu. The number of
saves per season is 3 times the number of players involved in the game. But if
you use the trainer option, you can have as mabny saves as you like.

Saving a game.

Before a disk can be used for saving a game it must be formatted by this
program, which is found in the disk menu. To save a game, first click on the
filename box and type in the filename, then hit return. Click on save.

Loading a game.

To load a saved game, simply click on DIR, then click on load.

Deleting a saved game.

Click on DIR, then delete.

Note: All messages and errors are displayed at the bottom of the screen.

From the main menu.
On the performance table option.

W       =       Win
L       =       Lose
X       =       Draw (score)
D       =       Draw (no score)

Disciplinary points option.

The fifth column of figures indicate the number of games the player is banned
for. The sixth column indicates the number of disciplinary points the player
has accumulated.

Injuries option.

When a player is injured, the figure at the right hand edge of the screen
indicates the number of weeks an injury will take to heal

No I havn't missed out the rest of the instructions. That is all there was.
