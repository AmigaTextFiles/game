             GAME CHEATS, BACKDOORS & LEVEL CODES (Update 12/26/92)

	The following list of cheats and backdoors for 488 games was compiled
by POSTCARD MAN from magazines and miscellanous postings on docs disks and 
BBSs. I believe it's the most comprehensive file to date since it incorporates
nearly every cheat file published. I never verified many of these cheats.
Sometimes more than one password is given since different sources list
different cheats. Sometimes the Atari ST cheat is listed by mistake instead 
of the Amiga cheat. I certainly don't have all of these games nor would I
have the time to play and test each cheat if I did. But I do make corrections
as soon as I know about a mistake. The file is turning into a book (7078 
lines at 66 lines / page = 108 pages). If the reader would like to add to or
ammend this file, please contact me by mail. Send paper listing of info or 
cheats on disk (if you don't care about returned disk) to:

AAARGH!

    At the start of each screen you'll find various buildings.
Blow fire over them, and then hit them. This will make them fall down
a lot faster. When you burn or knock down a house you get an egg.
    To beat the other monsters in a fight for an egg, don't jump around and 
breath fire, just hold your ground and punch forward.  After three or four 
falls, your foe will stay down.  
    Keep eating, even if it dosen't show any increase on screen, your health
will skyrocket.

won't harm you.

levels.

  Level 1 - ROTTEN CHEAT
  Level 2 - LOUSY CHEAT
  Level 3 - LOW DOWN CHEAT
___________________________________________________________________________

BANE OF THE COSMIC FORGE (WIZARDRY)

The password to enter the door in the SE tower of the 1st level is
SNOOPCHERI. Use the ROTTEN CHEESE on the MOUSEHOLE.

Some small help for playing the game successfully:

A tremendous source for playing the game can be found in getting BANE
OF THE COSMIC FORGE COMPILATION  released by Baser Evil on the 6th of
March, it contains many helpful maps to the game with marked location.

When you create your characters, it may be a good idea just to make
all of them Dracons. This is untested, but unless you have at least
one of this fire breathing race you surely won't survive the game. So
maybe it would be good to have more. Use a good mix of the classes,
try to take one of each spell class and a good solid theif that is at
full strength. Get a good enough thief and you don't need a fighter.
It may be slow, but keep rolling until you get the best character possible. 
Be sure to make at least  one character female, there are places in the 
game where this is a must. Dont do it and be sorry later!

Diversify your skills. Have each character specialise in a few skills
relative to his class. Do not worry about developing weapons skills,
you have no use for them if you created your party correctly.

In fights early in the game use Dracons breath attack, just be careful
not to overextend yourself. Rest after each encounter, backing up your
hard work. Allways search the area after a combat.

Search each square you step in. Not only this, but search facing all
four directions, many things can only be found that way.

Thieves are  not always true. If you find a lock and have your thief
open it,  always guess it is POISON unless  you are 100% sure (i.e.
tried it before) because it is better to suffer something else than to
die by getting this wrong.

Don't bash doors early in the game!  If your characters are not very
strong you  will be sorry. Jammed doors do you no good, as you might
never be able to open them again. Same foes for picking the lock. Wait
until you get a caster capable of conjuring  KNOCK KNOCK  with at least 
18 points (preferably 24) and do it this way. It is much more sure.

Once you know there are secret  panels or buttons, keep walking past
them until you discover them. You can find them by looking at the maps
and know where they are, sometimes it takes awhile to sense them.
___________________________________________________________________________

BARBARIAN (Psygnosis)

During the game, type '04-08-59'.  The screen should turn grey.
If so, you are now invulnerable and have unlimited lives. But he can still
be killed by very high falls and by the flame-hurling horned demon in the
dungeon deep.

NOTE: Other sources say code is `04 08 59' no hyphens between numbers:

To kill the final Wizard, you must have a shield. When his shot comes
at you, use the defense icon, and it will fly back at him.
____________________________________________________________________________

BARBARIAN (Palace)

On the final level when you confront Drax, walk forward and when the first
fireball comes, jump, then do a forward roll into Drax.  If you can't even
get that far then the best way to defeat an oppoent is to roll into him until
he reaches the side, then kick him, roll in to him again and kick him, keep
repeating this method and you'll soon finish the game.
____________________________________________________________________________

BARBARIAN II (Palace):  step-by-step walk-thru:
 
Level 1:  left, left, right seven times, left, right, left, in the cave,
and right.  Level 2:  right, up, left, up, left, left, right, left three
times, up, and left.  Level 3:  up, right, right, up, left, right, up, right,
left, left, up, left, left, up, up, right, right, left, left, up.  Level 4:
hit the fireballs, then try to leap across.  Several low chops will destroy
it.  Next is the Pit Demon; when he reaches out, use an overhead chop to hit
his arms; repeat until death.  Next, Drax himself!  Wait until he pauses
between spells, and hit him with a flying head chop!  The End...
__________________________________________________________________________

BARBARIAN 2 (Psygnosis)

To replenish any lost energy, simply hold down the HELP, M and E keys
simultanously.
__________________________________________________________________________

BARD'S TALE

Load your party, go to the statistics screen for the first player.
To get more gold than you will ever need (and then some), transfer all
the parties gold to one player. Save him to disk then load him back up
and transfer all to another. Keep repeating this process till you have
done it to all the players, then exit without saving. Load back up and
all your players will have the amount of gold equal to that of the en-
tire party before. Repeat until satisfied.

If your tired of waiting for morning to come enter and exit the guild.
____________________________________________________________________________

BARDS TALE II - THE DESTINY KNIGHT

If your tired of waiting for morning to come enter and exit the guild.

Find a band of  illusionists  and kill off the front line, have your
castor conjure DISRUPT ILLUSION, you will keep disbelieving and gaining 
expierence.
___________________________________________________________________________

BARDS TALE III - THE THIEF OF FATE

While the title page is displayed (one with Batman & Joker, type 'JAMMMM'.
Hold down each key several seconds and last M key should turn screen
upside down.  The words 'CHEAT MODE ON' should appear at the top of the 
screen.  You also have unlimited lives.  Press F10 to skip levels.
Retyping JAMMMM undoes the cheat mode.

BATTLE ISLE

BATTLE ISLE by Ubi-soft is a one or two player war game. Unfortunately
it has eluded most players on how to play against the computer. I'm sure it
is buried somewhere in the long documentation file. The game defaults to a
two player mode.

word FIRST. That is the first level of the two-player codes. Type in CONRA
or code for any other game level that you wish to play. The select EXIT to

BIO CHALLENGE

Pause with ESC and G key will advance you to the end of level guardian
(as if you want to go there).

Hints for the first three levels:

        LEVEL 1: Get the green armous as soon as possible. If you have
all of the amulet, don't go to the sphere unless you have collected at
least four lots of monster remains, you'll need them to battle the end
of level guardian. He's a bit soft in the head, so time your jumps
carefully, and hit him there.
        LEVEL 2: There are four planets to visit, go to everyone if
you want to get maximum points. Again, the green armour is very
useful, so get it as quickly as possible. There's loads of ammo for
the guardian of this level, unfortunetly that means there's loads of
monsters to deal with. The back of the guardians head is the weak
spot.
        LEVEL 3: Stand on the slabs and summersault. There are six
planets here, and the transporters are more difficult to so, so you
have to watch more carefully.
___________________________________________________________________________

BIONIC COMMANDO

Exit from level 1 exactly when the timer reads 1 for nine lives and a
super high score.
___________________________________________________________________________

BLOOD MONEY

Press HELP and then 1 or 2 and you will restock your supply of lives or money,
respectively.
___________________________________________________________________________

BLUES BROTHERS

Wait until the character selection screen appears, then type in HOULQ
which should cause the color of the background screen to change from black
to a maroon. Now just press the appropriate number key for the level you
want to play; 1 thru 6, then hit space bar.

When finishing a level, get the second of the two flags, and you'll keep
your record collection through to the next level.
____________________________________________________________________________

BOMBUZAL

Actually there is a hidden pause control in the game. When you press the
spacebar to access the overhead map screen, if you keep it held down the
clock stops until you release it.

When reaching a new level, it's worthwhile to sacrifice a life to see the
explosion pattern.  When trying to detonate a pulsing bomb, pick it up; it's
easier to see its size.  You are invulnerable to explosions when teleporting,
so use it to your advantage!  A blind droid can't activate switches.  Also,
here's a revised list of the level access codes:

BRIDES OF DRACULA

When you're Dracula, go right from the first screen and turn the first two
women into vampires, taking them back to their coffins. Then return to that 
screen again, walk between the lift and the second table and crouch down
just past the skulls on the floor. A vampire should then appear ready to
be put into her coffin. Do this again and again to get all eleven vampires,
and then polish off Heising before he knows what hit him.

While in the first screen, bubble the first two monsters and then fill the
screen with hundreds of bubbles.  Bubble and burst the remaining monster and
the remaining bubbles should turn into fruit (usually bananas), each of which
is worth 500 points.  Also, Hold down the fire button after losing your last
life, and you should get another set of lives, though your score will be
reset.  Beating level 100:  jump on the small platforms to collect all the
green potion bottles.  they will give you lightning bolts.  Jump down

CABAL

Type SCHLIKA during play.  The border will flash and now F2 finishes the
level.

If you pause the game you will discover that you can still aim the cross-
hair. Now you can position the crosshair over the motionless bodies, then
unpause the game and let `em have it.

* Shoot as many of the buildings as you can, as they block your shots at
  attacking / hiding enemies.
* Shoot the enemies at the bottom of the screen as the bullets they fire
  needless time to get to you and can often trap you in a corner.
* Don't forget that you can shoot the enemies' bullets!
* Try to pick up the bonuses straight away.  The 100, 200 and 300 point bonuses
  are very useful if you want extra lives.
* Collect special weapons straight away as their rapid fire removes buildings
  faster, giving more breathing space.
* The grey uniformed soldiers (the ones that take a few shots to kill) can give
  a grenade or a special weapon. When he does, two men carrying a stretcher
  will appear.  Shoot these and they will give you two grenades, collect them
  and then shoot them again before they go, to receive two more grenades.
* Never stay in corners for too long, the enemy has a habit of zeroing in on
  you.
* Don't waste grenades on buildings unless you really need to.  If you opt to
  shoot in small bursts at every building rather than concentrating on one
  building at a time then a grenade may finish the job a lot quicker.
* Try not to get killed when the end-level guardians appear otherwise your FOE
  meter will drop to zero and you'll have to start again.

CAPONE

To find a special bonus, go to the front of the Post Office.
Shoot the ball at the top of the flag pole, and your score will raise.
If you shoot it again, you'll see a screen of programmers.  Shoot it again
and you'll be invinceable, standing in the bank.  At the end of that round,
you will start at the beginning with warp speed.

CAPTAIN BLOOD

When you encounter a particularly friendly alien, ask it the 
following question using the alien icons: CODE GG1. The alien 
will then give you the co-ordinates of another alien called GG. 
Go to the specified planet and you can then ask GG for the co- 
ordinates of all the other aliens around by asking CODE 
INFORMATION HELP. If you're met with blind ignorance then put in 
the name of an alien after the HELP.

CARRIER COMMAND

While in the Walrus arming menu, select nine Harbinger surface to surface
missiles and put them in the AAV.  Select the Avatar Chemical Laser and place
it over the missiles.  Then select the pod you want (ACCB, Virus Bomb, Fuel)
and place it in the AAV.  Then, when you've launched the AAV, look at it's
weapons and you'll find you have BOTH missiles and laser!  On returning to
the carrier any missiles you have left will be added to the ship's stores.
Carry on doing this and hundreds of missiles can be yours.  Another cheat:
while in the pause mode, type GROW OLD ALONG WITH ME (include the spaces).
You should now see the message "Cheat mode active".  Pressing the + key on
the numeric keypad protects your Mantas and AAVs from missile attacks. The -
key can be used to turn this off.  Pressing the following keys in sequence:
'Help', Q, S, Control, Alternate, gives you a little message. Pressing the 9
on the keypad displays the current level.  6 and 8 have some other effect.
Returning to the title screen, press the + and - keys to view all objects in
the game.

++++++++++++++++
A different source claims the following cheat:

Pause the game from the main view screen and type:
THE BEST IS YET TO BE, complete with spaces.  The game restarts
automatically, and  displays  ' Cheat Mode Activated ' in the message panel.
Use the + and - keys to display all objects. 
      
When paused, pressing + and - on the numeric keypad toggles
Manta invincibility: the flying craft are no longer vulnerable to aerial 
attack, although collision with large objects is still fatal. Once a course
has been programmed for the carrier, Mantas or Walruses, engage autopilot 
and click on pause. To avoid sloggin around inreal type, you will find that 
pressing 3 on the keypad and unpausing again takes the corresponding craft 
directly to its destination. Likewise, pausing and pressing 2 replaces lost
shielding, while tapping 1 refuels the craft in question. 9 shows the 
current difficulty level, 7 speeds up the game and 6 brings up the 
programmers' test palette!

A lot in this excellent simulation. PAUSE the game and type
GROW OLD ALONG WITH ME then press + on the numeric keypad for your 
mantas and walruses to become sheilded. Press - to disable.

Try pressing CTRL and M on the main screen for some interesting effects.

CAR VUP

Get on the hi-score table and enter the following:

   WHOOPSIE  - start off on the prehistoric level.
   PUSSYCAT  - recieve nine lives.
   BUMPER    - give your car infinite bumper.
   ARNIECAR  - 100,000 bonus points
   WOAARRGGH - Gives you speed turn
   R.J.TOONE - Infinite lives

CAVE RUNNER

Get to level 2, then type SUB B BOYS (including the spaces).
The screen will flash blue and:
 F1   Gives nine lives.
 F2   Sets the timer to 99 - useful for level D.
 F3   Jumps to next level.
___________________________________________________________________________

CHAOS STRIKES BACK

Find a dragon and cast MON ZO GOR SAR and hit ESC to pause the game. Hold
down the ALT key and type in LORD LIBRASULUS SMITHES THEE DOWN. Unpuse
the game and slay the beast. He leaves behind a firestaff and your party
will be invincible.

Undocumented Spells:
GOR IR KU   - Detects Monsters
GOR IR ROS  - Detects fake walls and "invisible" (actually hard to see) pits
GOR IR DAIN - Detects "magic" on screen?
ZO IR NETA  - Anchors the map at the point of casting so that as you move 
              around, the map view stays at the anchored position.

(hint #1)
It's _REALLY_ easy to kill _ANY_ dragon.  Here's how.
1) Prepare all your players with MON IR VEN spells (mega poison cloud)
2) Use the green freeze life box (on the dragon)
3) Cast the spells, and then double up on each player
   (ie. each player casts 2 spells for a total of 8)
4) Wait... dinner will be served soon.

(hint #2)
Using the Vorpal Blade:
If you don't have both Vorpal Blades, you can increase #hits/time by
passing the weapon back and forth between the two attacking players.
(ie.  hit -> pass blade to #2 -> hit -> pass back to #1 -> hit ->...

(hint #3)
Contrary to what I've read on the net, everything is affected by
fireballs, including knights and dragons.  The only exceptions are
slime, black flames, and the thing that pops up from the floor.

CHAMBER OF THE SCI-FI MUTANT PRIESTESS  (KULT)

You don't have to complete all five Ordeals. Instead go into the tunnels
(from The Noose) and wait an hour. Then leave the tunnels and go to the
Master's Eye. Wait around until the master dies. Search his body for the
whistle. Use it and a panel will open up. Reach inside and grab the egg.

DRAGON'S LAIR II - SINGE'S CASTLE

One can play easy mode and still access all the screens. Here's what to do:

Select the hardest possible setting before starting the game,
this includes not only hard mode but also disabling that obnoxious 
'flip screen' feature and choosing only three lives. Then click on the 
'game' icon and do as if you were to start the game. When the
prompt bar says 'Click to play' instead choose the 'exit' icon and this 
will bring you back to the startup menu. Now you can select the easy mode
and more lives and you will still be able to see all the screens assuming
you're deft of hand enough to get to them in easy mode. Hope this helps!

usual except that when you press F10, all wounds are healed and dead
characters are ressurected.

31415927, hit Return then type SUPERVISOR. Then give your character a name.

All armor, treasure and weapons inside palaces are restocked every time you
enter. Send the strongest character in to grab the equipment, then distribute
it amoung your band. If you need some quick gold, do this repeatedly, then
go see the weaponsmith.

Get all the expirence points you want by going to Prince Haagkens castle.
Make your way past the bats, past the first fireplace with the trap to the
second fireplace.  In front of the fireplace is a switch that activates a door
two or three rooms farther on in the castle when you step on it.  This door
leads to a water fountain. Looking into the fountain transports you to a room
filled with water that has a never ending supply of water monsters.  Take your
best weapon and armour with you.  Set your character on 'auto kill' and if he
or she is able to hang in there, you can leave the character in the room for
several hours or all night killing off zillions of monsters.  Do this for each
of your characters and  youll easily be able to kill the giant dragon.

passes all the data onto this disk. Replace the original disk and continue
playing and now, if you get stuck in the game and you have to start again, 
simply continue with the other disk and all the doors that were previously
locked will be open. Plus, you'll be able to pick up the keys that you 
needed to unlock them as a bonus!

__________________________________________________________________________

F-16 COMBAT PILOT

If you`re fed up with landing try the following: Jettison all fuel and weapons
and climb to 65000ft. Stay there until the last of your fuel runs out. Dive
towards the ground and at 10 or 11 thousand feet pull up hard. You will then 
be able to rise about 4000 ft and then start falling towards the ground. Just
as you hit the ground the mission will end safely.
__________________________________________________________________________

F-29 RETALIATOR

On the Duty Roster, enter your name including the spaces as:

the plane to land automatically.

If your having limited weapon problems, just enter your name on the

with infinite weapons and cannons.
__________________________________________________________________________

FA-18 INTERCEPTOR (Electronic Arts)

Taxi down U.S. 101, turn right at Highway 92, pull up to the EA Headquarters
and blow it away!

In mission 6, once you've fired all your missiles, you can land on the
Shadow Sub (if it's still afloat) and it will refuel and rearm you.

Select option "2 Free Flight, no enemy confrontation" from the main menu.
Then select zero instead of 1 to 4.  The screen will go into a spiral and
scroll way south to 34 by 117 degrees, placing your plane somewhere without a
runway.  This happens to be in the middle of Edwards Air Force Base, where
the F/A-18 was flight tested.  hmmmm...  To take off you have to use the
afterburners.  117 degrees is the furthest south you'll be able to fly, but
you can go in other directions.  (Is there more to this back door?  hmm)
___________________________________________________________________________

FAERY TALE ADVENTURE

Take a save game file and use a PD program such as NewZap to patch byte
18 to a non-zero value.  Load your save game, and now these cheat options
are enabled:

  Arrow Keys - Move Rapidly over any terrain
  B          - Summon Gold Swan
  R          - Rescue Princess
  =          - Display coordinates
  F10        - Location in coordinates
  F9         - Increase time by 1 hour

One of the hardest things to overcome when first starting the game is how to
avoid dying. Here`s what you do. Make the crystal palace on the isle of 
sorcery your prime target with the first character, Julian.
When you confront the good witch, click on ask. She will give you a good 
statue and a clue. Now keep clicking on ask: your luck (or lives) will rise 
from 20 to 65. This makes you impossible to kill. You can always return to 
the same spot and do the same if your lives run low.
Sometimes you can accumulate all the treasure you want by going near the
item, pressing space bar, and then continue hitting 'T'.  You'll receive
an infinite supply of that treasure.

Save your position in a dungeon.  Then go through it until you run out of
keys.  When you restore your game, all the doors will be open and you will
have a new set of keys.  Also works in caves.

Jump on the turtle and start slashing.  Your bravery points will go up to
infinity and it doesn't hurt you or the turtle.

On the island with the Crystal Castle, press the right mouse button while
talking to the Sorceress and your luck will go up to 65.  'ASK'ing the
Sorceress several times will usually boost your luck.

If running low on Green keys, use a secret entrance for the fort.
It's on the left side, almost even with the door.

Beating the Turtle is not beating, it is pushing, so push the turtle across 
the land, to use it in special places: The turtle was programmed in asbestos,
and can swim in Lava. It can be used to enter the black citadel at the south.
Also, while it is present, you are not attacked, but by the time one has the
turtle, one is already invincible.
__________________________________________________________________________

FALCON

Press CONTROL-X ( X  SHIFT & CONTROL keys) for increased afterburners,
eight sidewinder missiles, and a full magazine. Don't know if it works on
the scenario disks.

Also, if you have trouble landing, select END MISSION after completing your
mission.
For a perfect landing every time, hold HELP key down about 10 - 20 feet
above the runway.
------------
If you get badly hit, don't bail out, instead swing round & head for home.
Press 'HELP' and the '+' on the keypad and keep them depressed. The F16 will
stay level and drop down.
Switch to tracking mode & rotate to side view.
Just before touch down, pitch up the nose and the plane will touch down
successfully every time.
Select end mission & you will be rescued even if you are in enemy territory.

FEDERATION OF FREE TRADERS

         Advancement in rank has nothing to do with the amount of
 credits to your name. It is releated to the number of missions you
 complete and ships destroyed. The only way to earn a lot of credits is
 to haggle on the trade-net. By staying in the space station on the
 net, and trading in guns, food and gold, you will quickly build a
 fortune.
         Travelling to space stations requires you to jump until you
 cannot get any further.
         To complete the missions:

         MISSION 1: Take message: just go there! Use E pod.
         MISSION 2: Destroy aliens, but not unknowns: Kill 4+. Use E pod.
         MISSION 3: Destroy Sat!
         MISSION 4: Escort convoy. Use E pod.
         MISSION 5: Investigate dissepearances. Kill 4+. Use E pod.
         MISSION 6: Search for survivors.
         MISSION 7: Escort VIP. Land on planet then go to destination.
         MISSION 8: Go and report.
         MISSION 9: Destroy alien.
         MISSION 10: Rescue civilians. Land on planet.

FUSION

NOTE: Don't know which of the two cheats work:
++++++++++++++++

Load it and start playing.  Press ESC.  Now, start a new game while pressing
E.  You should now be in the cheat mode.  If that doesn't work, enter SWAMP
THING into the high-score table, and restart a game while pressing E.  Now,
you can change levels by pressing + and -.  Move the joystick diagonal
up/left, press fire, then press E.  You now enter the game editor.  Pressing
ESC returns you to the level selector mode (pressing SPACE from the level
selection mode returns you to the game).  While in the game editor, press
these keys:  P - alter the game's palette (use 1,2,3,4,5 and 6 from keypad),
X - modify the exits (use - and + on keypad to select exit number, then press
S, then use + and - again to set the exit level.  Use cursor to set
position), W - weapons distribution, works like the exits distribution mode.

++++++++++++++++
Start the game as normal, collect the ship and fly to the extreme top 
left of the playing area. Disembark from the ship and drive the buggy
into the corner. Type in STONKER and re-enter the ship. Now pressing D
cycles through the available  weapons (including shield plus weapons), and
pressing C cycles through the levels.  NOTE: when entering a level, it's
always best to station the ship at the top left of the screen again, to
avoid  appearing at an illegal position, or even off-screen. On the
second level repeat the above process, getting the buggy back in the top
left hand corner, and retype STONKER again. It now enables the ship to fly
through walls, and pressing F while hovering over switches allows them to
be collected while in the air.
__________________________________________________________________________

GAUNTLET II

You need 2 keys and 2 locked treasure chests.  As you open the first chest,
hold down the Help key, collect the treasure.  Open the second chest while
holding down Insert.  An Ankh will appear and you must collect it.  You'll
hear a gong.  You should now have 50,000 health points and 32,000 reflective
super-shots.  The shots will vanish once you leave the level, and if you pick
up an amulet, the counter will be reset to 10 shots. (?? What Insert Key?)

To avoid tricky levels, pause the game and wait for three minutes.
Press fire and all the walls turn to exits. This happens anyway, but if you
pause the game, you don't lose energy, and won't get attacked while waiting
three minutes.

To get into the secret room, clear the dungeon completely, picking up the 
super shots last, then go to the exit without pressing fire.

GENGHIS KHAN

If you get a land that isn't connected with an enemy, move everything
to your home country. The land will be safe, but if another leader
captures a nearby land, make sure you put something back in or he will
attack on his next turn.

Do not move all your forces into your command unit, or an the enemy
commander will wait till he is down to his last few men and challenge you
to a one on one fight. If you lose he will get half your command unit.

GHOSTBUSTERS 2

To obtain infinite energy, (levels 1 & 2 only) hold down the ALT, Ctrl, 
S and U keys when the Activision logo appears, then press Fire. 
This also stops the cable from breaking on Level 1.

NOTE: Might be ALT CTRL 5 U  keys.

GHOSTS `N' GOBLINS

Play game and get on high score table. 
Instead of typing name, enter )!( followed by the END option to quit the table
Now start the game as normal, and you will find that once you have lost your
armor, you're invincible. Infinite lives too.

Type DELBOY on the title screen for invulnerablity.
____________________________________________________________________________

GHOULS 'N' GHOSTS

After starting the game, quickly type 'KAREN BROADHURST' for
invulnerability. The message `cheat mode on' should appear if you have
done it correctly. Holes and time running out will still kill you.
__________________________________________________________________________

GIGANOID

Press the CAPSLOCK key on the player select screen and a message appears.
Start the game, and lo and behold, MORE LIVES.
____________________________________________________________________________

GLOBULOUS

Type Zvmo!EG as a password for the cheat mode.
NOTE: Use upper and lower case as shown!

The most important thing to remember is that ALL the puzzles can be
solved without losing a life, so if you lose a life and think its the
only way to solve the screen, look closely. Some of the puzzles get
pretty obscure after level 10, but once you eventually beat them youll
kick yourself for not seeing the solution earlier.

Look before you leap. Think about how the screen will look from a
flipped perspective. A lot of jumps you make will be unnecessary and
waste time and switches if you dont.

Make sure you have enough switches, at least 10 per screen. It is
possible to get stuck on a downward slope with no way to get back up
or kill yourself, and the only way out is to press ESC and start the
whole game over.

Here are a few codes you might like to try:

GODS

NOTE: This game may generate unique passwords for each copy sold. Therfore
      the codes listed below in magazines probably don't work.

Level Passwords: Level 2 - JZS  or  CEL  or  APV
                 Level 3 - SFJ  or  HHO  or  AVJ
                 Level 4 - USX  or  DRA  or  LHH

Type SORCERY and once you pass selct password option you receive infinite
energy.

On level two, buy a shield and a magic potion, then get three fireballs and
three stars. Spend all of your remaining money on food and haelth. Collect
all the gems in the usual manner. Then get a key and make for the exit.

When you decend the last ladder, two thieves will appear, make sure that you
don't quite have enough energy to survive a direct contact! Before going down
the ladder, release your potion, then climb down and open the door. Stand in
front of the door ready to leave, but don't pushup yet! Wait until the
thieves jump down at you and as soon as they touch you push the joystick up.
You may lose that life, but then something rather strange will happen. The
bonus will start to wiz up for quit some time, until the game stars again on
world two with 28 extra men and about 5 million points! 
___________________________________________________________________________

unscathed through everything.

Press 'F2', 'F5', 'F4', 'F3' one at a time in that order. You then have
infinite speed, lives, and energy.

Hold down F5 for a few seconds for an indestructable ship, press I to move

___________________________________________________________________________

HARE RAISING HAVOC

If you press Left ALT, CTRL, SHIFT and F5 keys simultanously you can
advance to the next level.
___________________________________________________________________________

HARDBALL (Accolade):

  Various hints:
 
  * Allstars are better than champs, 
  * Only steal if you actually hit the ball, 
  * Try to get a lot of runs early, as the computer team improves
    towards the end, 
  * Bunting rarely works, 
  * Halfway through the match, swap Laws for Wells and Wratten for Harris. 
  * The best pitchers are Oliver, Perez, Leary, Cook.  The others
    will only be successful for a short while, 
  * Never pitch fastballs to the center as they will usually result
    in home runs, 
  * Change pitchers after a few innings, because as they get tired,
    their accuracy and speed get worse.
____________________________________________________________________________

HARD DRIVIN' & HARD DRIVIN' II

Get to full speed (preferably but not necessary) and press 'N' for neutral.
Now you can cruise along at full speed with easy steering and
invulnerability.  As long as you stay in neutral you will have unlimited
time as well.

Another trick is to repeatedly hit the 4 key (4th gear) until the program
has an error.  Continue with the right mouse button.  Repeat until you get
a high score.

At the start, turn the car around 180 degrees. The display should now show
the WRONG DIRECTION message. Head off under the bridge until you get to a
split in the road. Take the right hand branch and keep going until you reach
a checkpoint. Go through and turn the car through 180 degrees until your
heading the other way. Go back through the checkpoint in the right direction
and you should hear a ping. Keep going to the finish and once under the
bridge let the clock run down to zero. You should now get a message saying
that you've qualified for the race!!
___________________________________________________________________________

HAWKEYE:

Pause the game and press the DELETE key then when you die you will be warped
to the next level at the end of the game. Press 2 to go back and
forth between the stages.

Also during the game, pause and press `Help' key, then unpause and you
should have infinite lives.
__________________________________________________________________________

HELTER SKELTER

For tons of lives, follow these instructions:  Set up a two player game.
Player 1 must get an extra life.  Now both players should lose all their
lives.  Player 2 will return with 99 lives, and when he loses one life,
Player 1 will have 99 lives too.

Here are the passwords for those elusive later levels.

HEROES OF THE LANCE (SSI)

Some general tips:  
Arrange your party so that the first line consists of two strong warriors,
Raistlin and Goldmoon.  This allows you to use Raistlin's magic and the
healing staff of Goldmoon without too much hassle.  Save Tanis and Riverwind
for the later levels, where the bows come in handy.  When fighting Gully
Dwarves, use Tasslehoff who is the same height as them.  His sling stones
will never miss.  Avoid fighting Hatchlings, they're not worth it.  Just turn
and run when you meet one; when you reach an intersection move into a new
path and wait a little.  When you return, the Hatchling will have gone.
Killing Bozaks:  two methods:  1) get Raistlin to use a web, sleep or charm
spell to stun it, then send a warrior to clobber it to death, or 2) select
Flint, who is a dwarf; 9 out of 10 times, the Bozak's shots will go over his
head; get close to enter melee combat, and use low thrusts to kill it.
Spectral Minions:  they're easy to kill, so use a warrior.  Wraiths:  a
well-timed throw of an axe kills them every time.  If you miss, use a sword
and chest-thrust movements.  Don't let it get too close to you!  Spiders:
use low thrusts to keep them at bay.  If they get through your guard, retreat
until you can turn and fight again.  The blue and green potions restore
health, red slows down monsters, and yellow give your characters extra
confidence.

remember the exact day), he will leave a note in his station saying that
he is going hiking in the SW Volcanic Cone. Go to the volcano, fight the 
ants, and next day, visit Elmer's station. He'll thank you for saving his
life and give you more flamethrower fuel.

The entrance to the ants' nest will never appear on the main map, but
there are several other ways to get there:

        - By taking a flight from Hilber's Field.

        - By driving a tank from a battle going on at a nearby location.

        - By going south when you are in a battle at the M1 mine.

The entrance to the nest doesn't stay open long enough for you to get in
before the ants start invading the various locations in the town, so you'll
have to wait until they do. The 11th is the best day to enter the hole since 
it is very hot and there are few ants around. If you try cooler days, 
there willprobably be too many of them around for you to handle. Also, 
if you decide toget to the hole by plane, you can land safely on the dirt
road parallel to the tracks leading to the M1 mine.

get to race.)

KINGS QUEST III

When casting a spell and asked to recite a verse just hit RETURN.

The King's Quest series of games uses the debug command and interpreter for
the programmers (up to KQIII) KQIV doesn't have it because of the tremendous
size of the game.  Have some fun and press the "ALT" key then "D" then
"Return or Enter" (I think twice) then type in either GET OBJECT (and type in
a random #) or "TP" for transport (and a random #) and see what happens.  It
works., and if you're tired looking for a certain object the "Get Object"
function works great!
___________________________________________________________________________

KLAX

Begin play then hold down either of the SHIFT keys and SPACE together.

While playing the game, press `Space' and `4' to warp to LA stage.
__________________________________________________________________________

KNIGHMARE

This cheat involves the woodland section on the first level. Use the spade
to help you find the five apples. Take these apples and throw them at the
quest shield that hangs on the wall, and make each character consume two
rabbit pies from the inventory screen.
Continue with your quest and you should find that your hit points never
decrease.
____________________________________________________________________________

KRISTAL

Fights - Proficent swordplay is  essential if your to get anywhere in
the game. The neck chop is one of the more effective blows, but the
program blocks repetition of single moves. To get around this, occasionally
switch to a different move in order to enable the neck chop once
again. Give generously to the poor and you'll be a step closer to obtaining 
the Sword of the Spheres.

The Palace - To enter the palace, you'll need to get the invitation
from the elusive Gloop, found in Novala. Once you have it, keep out of
fights or you could lose it for good. When you get into the palace,
ask Nedrod three questions and he will give you the talisman, which
can help you find another useful item. Answer the Princess' question
with "Its a secret". She will give you the Ring of Belz, which will
only work in conjunction with the spell scroll.

In General - Objects are not always found in the same places from game
to game, so a detailed search of both fore and backgrounds is often in
order. To survive the final  confrontation, a high psychic rating is
needed, which can be increased by donating skringles to the poor. Dis-
orderly conduct can have the opposite effect. The safest technique in
the space battles, is to slow right down as soon as you see the aliens
shoot them all, then power at full  steam until the next lot.  Follow
Readheads ship if you see it. Heatpro tablets are necessary if you
beam down to one of the hotter planets. Makes notes of what you are
told, and use any new names or subjects to weavel out every last bit
of information from the characters.

LASER SQUAD

    In LASER SQUAD, for fun do THe Assassins on Level 1. Buy no armour,
   give the corporal an M4000 with two reloads, the next two rocket
   launchers with four rockets each, and the last two nothing at all.
   Deploy in the entrance, in the gap in the outer wall , and take the
   house to pieces with the rockets, waiting for droids or Regix to show
   up - get them with Jonlan's M4000. I managed to do the scenario with
   one shot - it went BETWEEN the leaves of the door, blew up against a
   wall and Regix was on the othe r side. End of story, fade to black.
___________________________________________________________________________

LAST DUEL

Start the game, pause with F9 key, then hold down HELP, Left Shift and 1

L.E.D. STORM (US Gold)

When the game has loaded in, and the title screens are flipping about, type
AMIGADAVIDBROADHURSTWANTSTOCHEAT (I do not know if you need to insert the
spaces - sorry). As you hit the last 'T' the message "CHEAT MODE ACTIVE - 
HELLO TO CAROL..." should flash onto the screen. Now your energy and fuel go
down slowly,  making it much easier to complete levels.
----------------
Type in  DAVID BROADHURST WANTS TO CHEAT  and things start to happen,
like infinite lives, etc. On the Amiga put one extra space between the
second and third words.
_____________________________________________________________________________

LEATHERNECK

This cheat works for both the ST and Amiga.

Here are several game level passwords:

   ALPHORN for 20  
   MATTERHORN for 30

   FREIBIERC for infinite lives. The screen will flash and it will tell

LIGHT CORRIDOR

First a little hint: The green diamonds are essential as these award you
with an extra life. Some of the red diamonds will allow control over two
bats but this is more of a hinderence as the two bats prove confusing.
Avoid the blue squares as they will shrink the size of your bat.

LOST PATROL

Rest for 50 minutes - and for no loss of food - your strength is restored
by a few points.  This restores all of your remaining men to 99 percent.

Keeping up your men's strength and morale is vital. Giving your men
50 minutes' rest a night, or during the day when it's too dark to
carry on, will slam your energy and morale levels to max. Even if
you don't have much food, you don't have to worry, as your men will
not eat it.
On reaching the first village (the first white cross on the map),
search the area to find a hole in the ground where the villagers
appear to be hiding. You then have two options: ENTER TUNNEL or
USE GRENADES. Gomez is useful at this point, but if he is dead, go
for the USE GRENADES option.
Start off questioning the villagers normally by aking them "Where
VC?" Once you have an answer, start the hard questioning, or a
village boy will get hold of a gun and shoot one of your men...

MEGATRAVELLER 1

A quick tip to gain cash.
Find a High Tech world with a low law level and buy as many PGMP's as
possible, although this may only be one initially. Then go to a lower Tech,
higher law level world and sell the merchandise. The ideal pleanets are:   
LLUN/EFATE (when using the trader character on the disk you can purchase a 
PGMP for 130500 credits) and STUR/EFATE (where not only is there a PGMP
lying on the floor nesar the Gun shop, but they can be sold for 244500
credits). In no time at all and with a little cost (because you are staying
within the system) you will gain riches untold!

MENACE

This one's a bit tricky - type 'XR31TURBONUTTERBASTARD' while the game
is in progress. try doing that without getting killed off! You should
now have a large supply of shields, cannon and lasers. They will run

Another cheat file lists the code with spaces between words!

Type XR31 TURBO NUTTER BASTARD and hit keys 1-6 to select a level.
Then press RETURN for extra weapons.

MERCENARY - THE SECOND CITY:

Fly the dominion dart as usual, fly to above 350 metres, level off (your
speed should be 1,781 kph) and fire a missile.  Pick the
missile up once you get close to it and then land.  Go to 08,08,
take the crashed intergalactic craft and go to 08,06, go underground
exit your ship and walk throuth the triangular door - bingo, you now have
access to the authors cheat room where you'll get keys to every door, passes
out of prison and the ability to carry oodles of
goodies in your pockets!

MIDNIGHT RESISTANCE

When the game is running in the demo mode, type in

and start the game as normal but with infinite lives.
__________________________________________________________________________

MIDWINTER

Don't bother with the tedious procedures of recruitment, just head straight
for enemy HQ with some dynamite and introduce them to Mr. Big Explosion.
Also if you start every game by clicking the mouse in exactly the same place
on the START screen, every game will be set up identically.

Invulnerablity--

AGAINST MISSILES:  Whether you are skiing or driving a now-buggy, the
moment you hear the missile being launched, stop immediately and begin to
turn around.  Keep turning on the spot.  The missile will narrowly miss you
then come back and keep pace alongside you for a while until it finally
speeds off to clobber someone else not so smart.

AGAINST MORTARS:  Watch for the bomber.  It will always come over the
horizon in front of you.  If you are stopped, wait until it is
approximately half way to you (otherwise it may be able to dodge your
missile) then blast it.  If you are moving fast blast it the moment it
appears over the horizon.  If the bomber does manage to drop mortars turn
90 degrees quickly and speed off.

MIGHT & MAGIC II

To earn heaps of experience points, make a backup of your original play disk.
Now boot and insert the disk that contains your characters. Save them onto
your second backup by going to the inn. Buy three tickets (green, yellow,
red or balck) and try to win in all three arenas. Remember to save after each
victory. Once you have a victory in each arena, go to the castle where the
bishop is held captive. Before entering flick the write protect tab to
protect your disk. Then enter and free the bishop with the correct key.
He will give you experience points if you have won three fights of the same
color. Exit and go to town. Open write protect tab and save at the inn.
You can repeat this several times. Once you have acquired mega-experience,
save your party using your original backup of the play disk.

NAVY MOVES

To reach part two of game type  786169

PART 1:
        Move back slightly when you encounter a mine. They're much
           less sensitive from the rear.
        Avoid jetski bullets by jumping or ducking.
        When approaching sharks, move the up and down nut left and right.
        Octopi and sea monsters are easily thwarted by holding down
           fire until both missiles are ignited and then releasing.
        Struggle to dock with a submarine? Put a mini-sub in the gap
           between the tailfin and the hull, face the left of the screen 
           and move upwards slowly, the computer takes over the docking 
           procedure for you.

PART 2:
        The code is 948411.
        Arrows indicate the direction of the lifts.
        Kill white marines and flamethrower troops to get more ammo,
           stand over the body and search thoroughly.
        To get the code of an official, you must shoot him with a gun,
           not a flamethrower.
        To enter computer codes, stand by a terminal, push up and
           you'll be asked for a code. Two of the codes are:

Transmit message: 1st or 2nd transmission official
Open door: 1st or 2nd machine official

        To open the reactor door, use the terminal next to the
reactor. The computer confirms the bomb is planted. Go out, use the
same terminal you used to open the door and transmit the following:
OABERYAMD. Now type END at the ready prompt and run like hell to the
conning tower.
----------------------
Another source:

The entry code for part two is 2277, and the solution is as follows, where L,
R, U and D have their usual meanings of LEFT, RIGHT, UP and DOWN.

From the start, R, D, R, Shoot 2nd Official and take his code, L,U, enter door,
R, shoot 1st Official and take his code, L, enter door, U, R, R, R, D, D, R, U,
enter door, D, enter "EMERGE" on the computer followed by 1st Official's code,
now type "STOP MOTOR" and enter 1st Official's code again, L, U, L, L, enter

-----------
    Anyone heard of the whirl-winds?  They advance you levels.  Near the
   end of level 1_1 there are three large steps that you must climb to
   reach your brother (sister?), who is in a cage.  Stand at the left edge
   of the top step, facing left and jump.  But as you jump, fire.  If your
   current weapon is arrows, fire halfway up, but if your weapon is bombs,
   fire at the top of your jump.  A whirl-wind should appear after four
   hits, and it will take you to level 1_4.

    In 1_4, you will be in a little box under some water.  Go up and to
   the right, and you come out in a small room with three boxes on the
   right hand side.  Go up these, and you will see 4 long spaces, the top
   one having an "N" and a "D" in it.  Go up t o the top one, get the
   letters, stand in the centre of the space, facing left, and fire.  Yep,
   you guessed it, another whirl-wind.  This one takes you to level 2_4.
   There are others, but I wont tell you - it would spoil it!

    But I will tell you that there is one on level 2_4.  Happy hunting!
-----------
Or on level 2.4 , stand at the entrance to the room where the giant octopus
is located and fire to the right several times. A warp will appear that will
take you to the beginning of level 3.1.
----------------

        On level 1, part 1, move to the area containing three men with
boomerangs, shoot them. Go to the top of the third platform, move to
the left, jump and fire five times. A whirlwind in a box will appear,
if you enter it, you will be transported to the end of the level. Then
you can free Tiki's naughty friend just by jumping.
        When you recch the ice whale, move to the right-hand side of
the spikes, avoid the crystals, and wait until he picks you up. Once
inside the whale, you can start shooting, but avoid the ice drops.
        Meeting the rock monster without bombs makes him difficult to
pass. So collect bombs, go to the highest platform and shoot him. Kill
it by either dodging the bullets and hitting it when the doors open,
or by fireballs.
        The last boss you encounter is the balloon seal. He can't be
killed, by blows to the body, so you must hit the balloon. Be careful
for the balloon seal is armed with a cannon and shoots cannon balls at
tiki.

The town names are:

       AUCKLAND, ROTORUA, WAITOMO CAVES, STRAIT COOK, and MT COOK.

Try shooting arrows into certain clear areas because they can force a door
to appear. Jump into the door to enter a latter stage.

OVERLANDER

Just a few tips- When cruising the highway don't stop shooting, 
and always choose the highest paid mission. Buy fuel carefully -
only enough for that level, after level 1 you MUST buy a 
leanburner. Try to stay in the middle of the road and travel 
fast, travelling slowly only burns more fuel. Fire bombs are more 
useful than smart bombs when you learn how to use them.
Bulletproofing is necessary after level 2. When travelling 
through the barriers the best speed is 90-120mph.

LEVEL 1:
 1. Select counterfeit money.
 2. Fuel up to 14 notches on the fuel guage.
 3. Get turbo, 4 battering rams and two flare bombs.
 4. After the first bikes slow down or the gunners will kill you.
 5. Destroy trucks from as far away as possible.
 6. Slow to 100-150 mph to negotioate barriers.
 7. If you stay in the middle lane when you come to the wrecks you wont die

LEVEL 2:
 1. Select kidnapped official.
 2. Fuel up to half full.
 3. Buy leanburner, a few bullet proofs, rams, and flare bombs.
 4. After first bikes there's a nasty surprise in the valley below.

LEVEL 3: DARKLANDS
 1. Select plutonium.
 2. Fuel up to half full (if you have leanburner - if you don't then fill
    up to the max.
 3. Buy rams, bullet proofing, flare bombs and lives if you need them.
 4. The toughest part of the course is early on, so don't be afraid to let
    loose with the flare bombs.

LEVEL 4: THE GUTTER RUN
 1. Select illegal chemicals. Fill up to max level.
 2. Buy maximum rams, bullet proofs and as many lives as you can afford
    and flare and smart bomb depending on your bank balance.
 3. The barriers are every where onthis level and you will need to be at
    90 - 100 mph to avoid them all. Try to save your rams for later in the
    level.
 4. So you didn't like the "gunshot alleys" in 1,2 and 3? The alleys in 4
    are real mean. Smartbombs and bullet proofing are your best chances of
    survival.

LEVEL 5: GRAVEYARD
 1. Choose the President. Fill up to maximum fuel.
 2. Buy everything $40,000 up front plus whatever you had from the last
    level should be enough, lives should be on the top of your shopping
    list followed by rams, proofing, brakes, armour and weapons - don't
    bother with the wheelblades!
 3. Do the same as for the last level. Because your car's at maximum
    everything, this level shouldn't proove too difficult.
___________________________________________________________________________

OVER THE NET

First, choose a one set game, play the sea-cup and enter one team or two 
human players.
When it's your turn to serve, move the non-serving player up to the top of 
the court close to the net.
This will force one of the computer players to follow him.
Now do a jump serve (push up and fire), then hit the ball to the other 
computer player by pushing right then down.  The ball should drop between him
and the net and he should miss the ball. Hopefully this plan should work. I 
don't know if it works with the other teams like Coco, Freaks etc but it 
works with the Rollers and the Golden Boys."
___________________________________________________________________________

P-47

Type 'ZEBEDEE' on the high score table.

  F1 - Extra lives
  F2 - Skips level
__________________________________________________________________________

PACLAND

When the title screen appears, type 'AVALON'.  It should flash indicating
you now have unlimited lives!  If that doesn't work, try the following:

Start a 2 player game.  Make it as far as you can with player 1.
With player 2, you must be able to make it as far as the fairy to collect
your boots.  Now that you have gotten your boots, you are going backwards to
where you started.  Push the THIRD cactus on the way back, and a yellow
pacman will appear.  Get it, now kill player 2.  Continue playing with
player 1.  Every time player 1 dies, get the yellow pacman with player 2 and
kill player 2 immediately.  As long as you keep getting the yellow pacman
with player 2, player 1 will never die.

Hints:

Level 1 - Run to the third fire hydrant, and when you get there, jump over
          it and push it to the left.  This will give you a blue hat that
          will make you invulnerable to the little ghosts that fall from
          planes.

Level 2 - Run to the third cactus, and push it to the left.  You will now be
          invulnerable for the entire level!

Level 3 - After getting your magic boots, push the third cactus on the way
          back for a free life.

- Jump on the roof of ghost's car to escape
- Only use powerpills when ghosts are in range, or else it is wasted
- When you reach the breaktime sign, jump when you are about 1 inch away
  for a bonus (depending how high you are when the level ends)

you can enter these codes (WITH spaces, no Return required):

       FAIR PLAY           -  Disables all previously entered cheats
       EARTHQUAKE          -  You may 'tilt' the table as you like

For a 4000 point bonus, you need to get the flooze to cross itself FIVE
times. But remember not to get too cocky, and wait until the end of the 
pipe to do this.
There is also a secret bonus of 50,000 points if you completely fill the 
screen with pipes.
__________________________________________________________________________

PIRATES

When fighting against unbelievable odds don't panic. Choose the long-
sword. Keep using the slash-high attack to cause the most dammage. You
may get down to only one man left, but you can still defeat the enemy
captain. After you win, select Send A Prize Crew so you will have 
enough people to sail your ship.

Don't attack a nation your home country is allied with, it will upset
both of them.

Don't wed till youve got all your promotions, your opportunities will
be much better. Make conversation with all the Governor's daughters,
however, they might gather important information for you from the
Governor's mansion.
___________________________________________________________________________

PITFIGHTER

To skip levels simply type in the word LOBSTERS while a fight is in progress
and press either 1,2 or 3 for the respective levels.

pressing the C key.
___________________________________________________________________________

PLAGUE

First make your score end in a three (by shooting the bubbles).
Then hit P to pause the game, then hit Escape, then click `No' when asked
if you want to play again. This takes you to the title screen with drooling
barbarian.
Now type the following; KOM JE ILLEGAAL DOOR DE PLAAG DAN GRIJPT DE JUNGLE
COMMAND JE IN DE KRAGG ; then hit Return.
Border should turn green. Hit fire button to return to game.
Now infinite lives. Must do this on Level 1 before killed for the first time.
____________________________________________________________________________

PLATOON

This one's cute. Type in 'Hamburger' at the title screen. The word
'Cheat' will appear below the credits press your joystck button, then
(F5) when the jungle screen comes up. Your man is now invulnerable to
the attacks of the little Commie @#!!$&*s. From here (F1) starts you
where you are, (F2) puts you at the location of the explosives, (F3)
takes you to the bridges that you have to blow up, (F4) takes you
straight to the village where the entrance to the tunnels is hidden in
one of the huts. From here on the cheat no longer works, the game runs
as normal and you can die but it certainly gets you further along the
track.

NOTE: Another cheat says password is HAMBURGER-HILL and pressing F1-F4
      skips you to the corresponding levels.
___________________________________________________________________________

POOL OF RADIANCE

When you bring up the options screen in a Conquest game, you can enter a
number from 0 to 32768; the program will generate a world associated with
whatever number you type in.  This gives you 128,000 worlds to choose from!!!
If you enter KILLUSPAL, it will put you on world 999.  Hmm...

a gold medal-finishing in the top 3 is -not- good enuff!) Collect all
the gold medals and you enter a bonus round on a secret couse with you

_________________________________________________________________________

POWERMONGER

Instruct your captain to invent something, pause the game, put the game
speed up to full, and wait a couple of minutes. Now unpause the game, the
captain will have kept inventing during the pause!

When you wish to invent in double quick time, click Invent and when your
men leave, click on it again. This often makes a catapult immediately.
This cheat works only once on each island.
__________________________________________________________________________

PREDATOR

If your energy gets on the low side, simply press F10 and restore it.

PREDATOR II

Pause the game, then type in YOUR ONE UGLY MOTHER , unpause and presto you
have infinite lives. ( maybe it YOU'RE instead of YOUR )
__________________________________________________________________________

PREHISTORIK

After killing the strange turtle-like creature on the first level, you should
come to a screen with two carnivorous fish bouncing up and down in the water,
along with four banks.  To get to the secret room don't jump over the first
well.  Instead, jump inside it and fall down into the secret room!

Later on the first level, look out for a ladder near some water which leads
up to a platform containing an egg.  Climb the ladder and take the egg, then
go to the left into the water to find the submarine room.

There is also a way to find some hidden extra food.  Go to the third screen
of level three and jump forward hitting empty space.  The hidden food should
now appear.
___________________________________________________________________________

PREMIERE

On the title screen (the one where it says "Press Fire to roll cameras") type
SPARKPLUGS to obtain infinite lives. The word cheat will flash to let you 
know that the cheat works. When you start the game you should be able to
skip levels by pressing the '/' key on the top row of the numeric keypad.
___________________________________________________________________________

PRINCE OF PERSIA

To skip levels hold down the CAPS LOCK key and press L.
This seems to work only to level 4 and won't work on the bottle bit at
the end of level 1.

The following cheats also work, although it might be the CAPS LOCK key
instead of the SHIFT key:

  SHIFT K to kill guard
  SHIFT + to add time
  SHIFT W to levitate when falling
  SHIFT T for full strength
  SHIFT L for next level
___________________________________________________________________________

PROJECT X

If you fly into the first end of level baddie when it opens up, avoiding
its fire and being careful not to touch it, you will be presented with a
version of Space Invaders. Complete one wave and you will be given three
extra lives and be thrown back into the fray.

When you die, pilot your flashing ship down below the score at the bottom of
the screen to have a free tunnel of aliens.

Access codes:  level 1- 170961, level 2- 010655, level 3- 610169.  And now,
some tips:  once in the core, you can't quit.  So choose droids with good
lasers, Jack and Spud for example.  The Quadralien mother is made up of 4
separate pieces grouped together and surrounded by Earthling boxes.  The
mother can only be destroyed by blowing up each box from a different
direction.  From the starting point there are three exits:  north, east, and
west.  Go east and destroy the first box, return to the starting point, and
go north to destroy the second box.  You will now have both droids to blow
the remaining boxes.  Go west through the one-way force field, and get the
other.  Don't forget to keep recharging.

RAINBOW ISLANDS

We all know that collecting the seven different-colored gems gives you an
extra life and a 100,000 Bonus Gem once the Boss is defeated.
But collecting all of the gems in the correct order of color (from left to
right on the gem counter) not only awrds you the life and Bonus Gem, it also
grants you access to a magical secret room. When you reach the end of the
level, a silver door appears. `You don't have to fight the Boss. (Hint A)

Even more useful is how to create any color gem. The screen is split into
several invisible vertical stripes of color. When a gem falls, its color is
determined by the `color' of the area into which it fell. Now all you have to
do is guage carefully where the dead enemy will fall to create the gem color
of your choice. (Hint B )

Type the following codes while the title screen is displayed

  BLRBJSBJ  awards permanent fast shoes

MINES - Each time a mine is purchased the income you receive for each time
        pass doubles.
FACTORYS - The more factorys you have the faster more weapons are produced,
           these are essential.
RIGS - These supply you with the fuel for each mission run.  The more rigs
       you have the greater the  amount of fuel you receive for each
       time pass.
ARMYS - For every army unit you own, the enemy slows down, eg. you have one
        army unit, for each four time passes that occur the enemy won't move
        for one time pass.  If more than 50% of the sector is occupied by the
        enemy then you will lose one of your assests for each time pass that
        occurs.  The best solution is when 30% of the sector is occupied go
        an attack the enemy.

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

SIM CITY

Hold SHIFT and type 'FUND' for $10,000.  It will cause an earthquake every
tenth time you do it, so do it before you start your city.

Another tip is to set the citizen's taxes to 0%.  Then just before tax
collection (December or November if playing at fast speed) quickly set the
taxes up to 20%.  Then after you collect taxes, put it back down to 0%.
This way the citizens think they are not paying any taxes.

You can build land on water. Find a straight (horizontal or vertical),
stretch of coastline and string a powerline along it. Next, move one
square over, out into the water and string another powerline parallel to
the first. Repeat as many times as you want. Then just
bulldoze all the excess powerlines and you can build on the new land.

To MAKE land you simply make a 3 lane highway across any water source.
When you make a road by putting 3 sections of road on top of three section
of road on top of three sections of road (3 by 3) you make 1 section of
land in the middle.                WWWWW   WWWWW     To make more land, just
                                   WRRRW   WRRRW     move you roads over, or
           L= land                 WRRRW = WRLRW     make your roads 4 by 4,
           W= water                WRRRW   WRRRW     5 by 5 etc.  Play with
           R= road                LLRRRLL LLRRRLLL   it.  It'll work.
                                  LLLLLLL LLLLLLLL

VOODOO NIGHTMARE

This hint will make the game somewhat easier to play. You probably noticed
that all the nasties go to sleep at night. When you pause the game, the

safe night periods, and pausing the game during the dangerous daylight.

If you're cursing Voodoo Nightmare, here's how to obtain the last few pins to
help you to destroy the Witch Doctor.

 MISSION 1:  Feed the monkey on your back bananas.  Eventually, this will
             give him a bad case of diarrhoea, and he'll run off to a
             secluded spot.
 MISSION 2:  Reunite the lion cub with his mum.  Look in the tree trunks.
 MISSION 3:  Save a sick native, buy medicine.

WINGS (Cinemaware)

Basic stuff

Each letter of the word WINGS on the main menu does something.
To access them hold down the CTRL Shift and Alt keys on the left side of the
keyboard while holding down the right mouse button.  While holding down
these keys and button, you can click on each of the letters in wings with the
left mouse button.  Each letter does the following:
	"W" toggles the music on and off
	"I" turns the CAPS LOCK key into an autofire button
	"N" no flight school missions required for new pilots
	"G" Guess
	"S" Saves game without having to exit

To access the other cheats you must go to flight school.

To get an awesome pilot (once only) click on the bullseye on the airplane
at the top of the flight school menu.  The screen will either flash or you 
will get a requester asking if you want to quit (say no).  Then create a
new pilot.  Enter the name "Orca The Killer Tomato" (without the quotes, and
remember it's case sensitive).  Orca is all ready and doesn't need flight
school.

To access a menu of options (much of which is no longer useful or active)
create a new pilot.  Enter the name "  Who is The Riddler"  Leave off the
quotes but be sure and type the two leading spaces.  DO NOT HIT RETURN to
enter the name, hit ESCape instead.  Then just follow the prompts. 
	
If you run from a hard disk you can hit LEFT-AMIGA ESCape to toggle to the
Workbench screen and back.

Game Tips:

BALLOON BUSTING- The first thing to do in Balloon Busting missions 
is to take out the AA gun. It isn't too hard so give it a try.

DOG FIGHTS- When involved in a dog fight with other planes always
attack from above. This is because if you attack from below the other
plane will climb which is very annoying. By attacking from above you
drive the other plane down rather than up. 

BEING TAILED- When you are being tailed hold the joystick to the 
bottom-right. You should turn off to the right and out of the other
planes line of fire.

exit. Go through the Gents, then you'll appear in a room with a Ladies and

XYBOTS

Get a high score and enter 'ALF' for your name.  Now you will have unlimited
lives.
        If you manage to reach level 10, you're better off using your
radar to kill the xybots. Just line them up using radar and fire, you
don't have to be able to see them.
        Keep as many keys with you as possible because some levels
don't have enough to complete them.
        There are short cuts to level seven on levels one and four -
you get extra cash for using them.
        If you have the extra energy upgrade try not to let your
energy fall below 100m, because you lose the upgrade if it does.
        Drums are not just decorations - hide behind them when
possible and use your zapper near to them to find more cannon power
        On level eight, near to the top left hand transporter you can get
to two white coins by blasting away one of the three walls around them.
        Don't split up in the two-player game, because it's easier to
complete it together.
        The master xybot lives on level 11, and you'll need to stock up
on double shot and extra shot speed to stand a chance of survival.
        Try to get one xybot to stand behind another - they'll blow
each other apart.

ZOMBI (UBI Soft):

If you have seen Dawn Of The Dead, you already have a good idea on how to
solve most of the puzzles.  But here's some extra tips anyway: 1) To lock up
the mall to keep zombies from getting in, you need to park the trucks over
the entrances.  Get the key from the office on the 2nd floor and go to the
4th floor where the keys to the trucks are kept.  2) To keep the dead zombies
from coming to un-life, lock them up in the freezer in the basement.  3)
before you can go play in the basement, you need a source of light.  Get the
fuses and gloves from the 3rd floor and go to it!!
