What's the situation?
---------------------

You're in charge of defending one of the huge mechanized space
platforms producing products for earth.  Out here, if your
platform isn't protected, it will quickly belong to someone
else.  The good news is your platform has an automated defense
network to keep the wolves at bay.  The bad news is someone has
sabotaged it and the enemy is descending on the platform at a
rapid pace.



What do I do?
-------------

You need to repair the defense network as quickly as possible
while eliminating the enemy where you can.  All you can hope to
do is slow them down though, because they're too many of them
and they're coming too fast.  You also have to worry about
supplies for your ship, because they're being rationed.



How do I get  back control of the platform?
-------------------------------------------

Once the defense network circuit board is repaired, it will take
over and eliminate the enemy.  So as soon as the circuit board
is repaired, you win.



How could I loose the platform?
-------------------------------

The enemy is rapidly deploying all over the place.  There may be
some enemy in every sector, but if the enemy FULLY occupies 5
sectors (shown in red on your ship's console display), then the
enemy has taken over and you have lost the platform.



What other problems do I face?
------------------------------

If you run out of fuel, or get hit too many times, your attempt
to save the platform has ended.



How do I use my ship?
--------------------

Use your joystick to turn the ship left and right.  Let your
ship go off the edge of the screen to access the next
sector(screen).  Pull back on the joystick and press the fire
button to access your ship's console.  This displays the status
of your ship, its supplies, and how much of the network has been
repaired.  From this screen you can also quit the game, restart
the game, access on-line help, or return to the game.



What is the console's sector map showing me?
--------------------------------------------

The squares in this map represent the 80 sectors of the
platform.  The blue square is where your ship is located.  Green
squares indicate light or no enemy activity.  Yellow squares
show where the enemy is building up.  Red squares show what
sectors the enemy has fully occupied.  If the enemy attains 5
fully occupied sectors, you have lost the game.  Squares that
show a dot in the middle indicate sectors that contain a supply
dock.  Numbers on the sector map indicate where the network
nodes are.  Each number corresponds to the position the node has
on the IC board. If the dot or number in the sector is white,
you have not accessed that item yet.  Black indicates you have
been there already.



Where do I go first?
--------------------

Your main task is to reach all network nodes in order to replace
all IC's in the defense computer. (To see what network nodes
look like on the platform, bring up the on-line help screen; 
the node image appears near the bottom).  You must get to all
the nodes while keeping control of the enemy hotspots and
maintaining supplies.



What do I do when I find a node?
--------------------------------

Just as your ship crosses over the top of the node, pull back on
the joystick and press the fire button.  This will bring up the
IC board that needs repair.  Each IC on the board represents a
different node in a different sector.  The IC for the node in
your sector is highlighted on the board.  You can only change
the IC for the sector your in.



What do I do with the IC board?
-------------------------------

You must choose the IC number for the IC by moving your joystick
left or right.  This number is used to calculate the sum for the
row and column the IC is in. When the total of all the IC rows
and columns matches the numbers around the edge of the IC area
(the numbers in white on the board) then you have repaired the
defense network. Press the fire button to exit the screen after
you have made your choice.



But I don't know what IC# to select yet
---------------------------------------

That is true in the beginning; you can only make an educated
guess.  (Hint: The only numbers used are 0,5, and 10.)  As you
get more ICs on the board, you'll have more information to
figure out what numbers are needed at what position to make the
rows and columns add up right.  You may have to revisit a
node to change its IC number more than once.



Sometimes when I hit an enemy dead on, 
my ordnance passes right over him
--------------------------------------

Your weapons work differently than you might expect.  There are
3 types of enemy weapons: floating attack probes, platform
vehicles (crawlers) and gun placements.  You have a specific
ordnance for each type of enemy weapon.  When you hit an enemy
of that type, it is deducted from that supply.  If you don't
have that type of ordnance, the enemy won't be hit and the
ordnance will be deducted from what you have the most supply of.
If you miss the enemy altogether, your supply is deducted the
same way as mentioned previously.



I'm running out of supplies, how do I get more?
-----------------------------------------------

Look on your console screen for a sector with a dot and head for
that sector.  When you arrive you'll see a red and blue dock
with a light circling around it.  You'll have to circle around
until your timing is just right to cross into the center of the
dock just as the light goes underneath your ship.  If you do
this correctly, the dock center will change to a down arrow. 
Pull back on your joystick and press the fire button.  This will
bring up the supply screen.  



How do I use the supply screen?
-------------------------------

You can choose one of the supplies listed on the notepad.  To
select an item, move the joystick up or down, then press the
button when the check mark is on the item you want.  Your ship
will be fully resupplied on that item (or fully repaired).  EACH
DOCK CAN BE USED ONLY ONCE, so plan your usage carefully.  If
you're always repairing damages, you won't have opportunity to
get anything else, so watch those hits.



HAVE FUN!
