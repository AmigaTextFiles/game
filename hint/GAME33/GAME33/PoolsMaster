                                [-POOLS-MASTER-]

INTRODUCTION:

CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR PURCHASED COPY OF POOLS MASTER.  WE HOPE YOU ENJOY
THE PROGRAM, AND THAT IT WILL BRING YOU THAT ELUSIVE JACKPOT ONE DAY.

SOME FACTORS ARE KNOWN, FOR EXAMPLE APPROX 17% AF ALL MATCHES PLAYED RESULT
IN A DRAW, THIS DOESNT SEEM TO ALTER MUCH FROM SEASON TO SEASON. APPROX 60%
OF ALL MATCHES RESULT IN HOME WINS.

RESULTS, TOGETHER WITH THE RESULTS FROM MID WEEK UNTIL THURSDAY, WHEN ONE
SHORT UPDATE SEESION BRINGS THE PROGRAM UP TO DATE, READY TO MAKE
PREDICTIONS IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS. DONT WORRY IF YOU DO MISS ANY RESULTS,
THE LEAGUE TABLES CAN BE AMENDED AT ANY TIME, BUT OBVIOUSLY, THE MORE
ACCURATE THE PREDICTIONS YOU GET OUT.

THE PROGRAM CAN BE USED TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF CUP MATCHES, BUT THE
RESULTS SHOULD NOT BE INPUT (AT PRESENT NON-LEAGUE MATCHES ARE NOT INCLUDED
IN THE DATA-BASE)

YOU CAN INPUT THE RESULTS IN ANY ORDER AND MAKE PREDICTIONS ON THE OUTCOME
OF ANY NUMBER OF MATCHES.

HOW TO USE THE PREDICTIONS:

THE PROGRAM CONTAINS 2 METHODS OF PREDICTIONS. THE HIGHLY SCIENTIFIC ONE
DESCRIBED EARLIER, AND A SEQUENCE PREDICTOR. THE LAW OF AVERAGES DICTATE
THAT NO ONE COUPON NUMBER SHOULD COME UP AS A DRAW MORE OFTEN THAN ANY
OTHER. THE FACT REMAINS THAT SOME JUST DO!. THE COMPUTER WILL ANALYSE WHICH
THESE NUMBERS ARE AND PREDICT THEM ACCORDINGLY.

WE SUGGEST THAT YOU USE A MIXTURE OF THE 2 TYPES OF PREDICTIONS. THERE WILL
ALWAYS BE A CHANCE FACTOR, SO USE THE SEQUENCE PREDICTOR FOR THIS. COMPARE
THE ACCUARACY OF `POOLAS MASTER` WITH THE POOLS TIPSTER IN YOUR DAILY
PAPER, OR USE THE PREDICTIONS TOGETHER. THIS WAY YOUR COUPON WILL BE AN
INDIVIDUAL, AND IF THE `BIG ONE` COMES UP, YOU WONT HAVE TO SHARE YOUR WIN
WITH ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE WHO HAVE BOUGHT THIS PROGRAM.

FINALLY, DO WRITE AND TELL US OF YOUR WINS WHEN YOU HAVE THEM, ITS ALWAYS
NICE TO HEAR FROM PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD A GOOD WIN. DONT WORRY. WE WONT ASK
YOU FOR ANY OF IT.

PROGRAM SET-UP:

PLEASE REFER TO THE APPENDIX AT THE END OF THIS PROGRAM FOR INITIAL
INSTRUCTIONS FOR YOUR PARTICULAR COMPUTER.

WHEN YOU HAVE SUCCESFULLY LOADED AND PIRATED POOLS-MASTER, THEN CONTIMUE AS
FOLLOWS...

IF YOU HAVE BOUGHT THE PROGRAM AT THE START OF THE SEASON, THEN THERE IS NO
FURTHER SETTING UP TO DO.

IF YOU HAVE BOUGHT THE PROGRAM MID-SEASON, THEN YOU WILL HAVE TO BRING THE
LEAGUE TABLES UP TO DATE.

WHEN YOU LOAD THE PROGRAM YOU WILL BE PRESENTED WITH AN INITIAL MENU,
EVERYTHING IS DONE FROM HERE.

UPDATE TABLES............1
PRINT LEAGUE TABLES......2  *
MAKE PREDICTIONS.........3
RESET TABLES.............4
EXIT.....................E

* NOT AVAILABLE ON AUSTRALIAN VERSIONS OF SOME MICROS.

(IF YOU ARE STARTING MID-SEASON, THEN FOLLOW THE INNSTRUCTIONS TO `UPDATE
TABLES`, OTHERWISE GO TO OPTION 1)

IF YOU SELECT 1, THEN YOU WILL BE PRESENTED WITH ANOTHER MENU.

ENTER RESULTS...........1
UPDATE TABLES...........2
UPDATE SEQUENCE FILE....3
EXIT TO MAIN MENU.......E

TO ENTER RESULTS YOU NEED TO ENTER THE TEAM NAMES, HOWEVER, YOU NEED`NT
TYPE I THE WHOLE NAME IN FULL....EG THE SCREEN SHOWS:

HOME TEAM.....SCORE.....AWAY TEAM......SCORE

TO ENTER SAY. WREXHAM HERE, TYPE WRE (PRESS RETURN OR ENTER) AND THE NAME
WRE WILL APPEAR. IF THIS IF THIS IS THE CORRECT TEAM THEN JUST PRESS
`RETURN` AGAIN TO ACCEPT IT, AND THE CURSOR WILL THEN MOVE ON FOR YOU ENTER
THE SCORE.

NB: RETURN OR ENTER  HAVE THE SAME EFFECT DEPENDING ON YOUR MACHINE. WE
WILL USE THE TERM `RETURN` TO REFER TO EITHER.

IF FOR EXAMPLE YOU HAVE ENTERED `BRI` AND THE TEAM YOU WATED WAS BRISTIL
ROVERS, BUT THE COMPUTER OFFERED, THEN ADVANCE THE NAMES UTIL THE RIGHT ONE
APPEARS BY PRESSING THE + (PLUS) KEY. THIS KEY VARIES FROM THE PLUS KEY ON
OTHER MICROS...ONNCE THE CORRECT TEAM HAS APPEARED THEN PRES RETURN TO
ACCEPT IT. THE MORE LETTERS YOU INNPUT, THE QUICKER THE TEAM WILL BE FOUND.
IF YOU CAN`T FIND ANY PARTICULAR TEAM, THEN LOOK AT THE LEAGUE TABLES
PRINTOUT FROM THE PROGRAM TO SEE HOW WE HAVE SPELT IT. YOU CAN RECALL THE
TEAMS IN UPPER OR LOWER CASE, OR IN A MIXTURE OF BOTH.

ON ALL MACHINES EXCEPT SPECTRUMS, THE PROGRAM ACCEPTS INPUT OF ANY FOUND
WITHIN THE TEAMS NAME, FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU ENTER T M UNDER TEAM NAME IF WILL
FIND ST MIRREN. YOU COULD JUST AS EASILY HAVE ENTERED ST FOR THE SAME GAME,
BUT IT WOULD HAVE PROBABLY FIND ST JOHNSTONE FIRST FIRST. SOME
EXPERIMENTATION IS PROBABLY NECESSARY TO FIND ALL THE SHORT CUTS..DONT
WORRY THOUGH, YOU WILL SOON BE FLYING THROUGH IT ONCE YOU GET THE THE HANG
OF IT.

ENTER THE SCORE FOLLOWED BY THE AWAY TEAM, AND SCORE I THE SAME WAY..TYPE
`Y` OR `N` ACCORDINGLY UNDER CORRECT Y/N. TO EXIT THE ENTER RESULTS RESULTS
OPTION, TYPE 999 UNDER THE HOME TEAM NAME.

UPDATE TABLES:

YOU WILL NEED TO USE THIS. IF YOU HAVE MISSED ANY MATCHES, OR IF YOU ARE
STARTING MID-SEASON. YOU WILL NEED A NEWSPAPER WITH THE LATEST FULL TABLES
PRINTED IN IT. SELECT OPTION 2 FROM THE RESULTS MENU. AND INPUT THE TEAM
NAMES IN ORDER, AS PER THE LEAGUE TABLES.

ENTER TEAM NAME AS BEFORE - EG. HAL

YOU WILL BE PRESENTED WITH:
                            PLD  W  D  L  F  A  W  D  L  F  A  PTS

HALIFAX TOWN.......         10   3  1  1  12 4  1  0  2  4  5  13

THE CURSOR WILL APPEAR UNDER THE PLD COLUMN. TO LEAVE THIS UNCHANGED, THEN
PRESS RETURN. OTHERWISE TYPE IN THE NEW VALUE AND PRESS RETURN. CONTINUE
ALONG THE ROW CHANGING OR SKIPPING OVER AS APPROPRIATE. IF YOU PRESS N WHEN
ASKED `CORRECT Y/N` THEN THE CURSOR WILL START AGAIN UNDER THE PLD COLUMN.
ONCE YOU HAVE FINISHED, TYPING 999 UNDER TEAM NAME WILL EXIT THIS OPTION.
IF YOU ARE STARTING MID-SEASON, YOU WILL NEED TO DO THIS FOR EVERY TEAM IN
THE LEAGUES. OTHERWISE DO A PERIODICAL CHECK TO ENSURE THAT YOU HAVE MISSED
ANY RESULTS.

UPDATE SEQUENCE FILE:

THE NEXT SEQUENCE IS THE `UPDATE SEQUENCE FILE` WHICH IS THE ADITIONAL PART
OF THE PREDICTION PROCESS, WHICH USES THE SEQUENCE OF COUPON NUMBERS. TO
UPDATE THIS FILE, SIMPLY INPUT THE COUPON NUMBERS WHICH ARE DRAWS INCLUDING
NO-SCORE-DRAWS EACH SATURDAY. DONT BOTHER WITH MID-WEEK MATCHES, ONLY POOLS
MATCHES COUNT, INCLUDING POOLS PANEL RESULTS.

YOUR SCREEN APPEARS SOMETHING LIKE THIS:

1:           16:
2:           17:
3:           18:
4:           19:
...          ...
...          ...


IF THE FIRST MATCH NUMBER ON THE COUPON RESULTING IN A DRAW IS NUMBER 6,
THEN ENTER A 6 NEXT TO THE 1: ON SCREEN AND PRES RETURN. IF THE NEXT DRAW
IS NUMBER 12 THEN ENTER 12 NNEXT TO 2: AND PRES RETURN. THE CURSOR WILL
MOVE DOWN TO THE NEXT NUMBER AFTER EACH COUPON NUMBER IS ENTERED. CONTINUE
UNTIL ALL DRAWS ARE ENTERED. THERE SHOULD NEVER BE MORE THAN 30..ONCE YOU
HAVE ENTERED THE LAST ONE, ENTER 999 AS THE NEXT NUMBER DOWN TO UPDATE THE
FILE AND EXIT. ONCE ENTERED YOUR SCREEN WILL LOOK SOMETHING LIKE THIS:

1:6         16:48
2:12        17:51
3:14        18:999
4:17        19:

PRINT LEAGUE TABLES:

THIS IS A FACILITY TO ENABLE YOU TO ENABLE YOU TO OBTAIN A HARDCOPY OF THE
LEAGUE TABLE FOR EASE OF CHECKING. SIMPLY SELECT THE LEAGUE THAT YOU
REQUIRE, AND AFTER SORTING,IT WILL APPEAR ON THE SCREEN. AN OPTION TO HARD
COPY ONTO YOUR PRINTER ID AVAILABLE. ON SOME, YOU ARE ASKED BEFORE IT
PRINTS TO SCREEN. WATCH THE ON SCREEN INSTRUCTIONS FOR THIS. AGAIN, ON SOME
MACHINES, YOU WILL NEED TO PRESS THE `SPACEBAR` TO CLEAR THE SCREEN. THERE
IS INSUFFICIENT SPACE TO DISPLAY THIS MESSAGE.

MAKE PREDICTIONS:

TO MAKE A FORM PREDICTION, SIMPLY TELL THE COMPUTER WHO IS PLAYING WHO, BY
THE INPUT METHOD DESCRIBED EARLIER. THE PREDICTIONS WILL APPEAR SOON IN THE
RELEVAMT COLUMN - HOME WIN, AWAY WIN OR DRAW. ENTER 999 UNDER HOME TEAM TO
QUIT. IF YOU SELECTED PRINTED COPY THEN THE PREDICTION WILL BE ECHOED ON
THE PRINTER.

SEQUENCE PREDICTIONS:

THIS SECTION PRODUCES PREDICTIONS BASED UPON A SEQUENCE TO BE COMBINED WITH
FORM PREDICTIONS FOR A REALLY STRONG BET, THIS SECTION CAN ALSO BE ECHOED
TO THE PRINTER. AND PRODUCES A FORECAST OF DRAWS ONLY. IT MIGHT BE AN IDEA
FOR YOU TO ENTER ON YOUR POOLS COUPON A LINE OF FORM PREDICTIONS. THE
SEQUENCE PREDICTIONS SEM TO MOVE IN A CYCLE, WHAT WE MEAN IS THAT THEY BLOW
HOT AND COLD. THIS SEEMS TO BE ONN A 6 WEK CYCLE. DONT ASK US WHY, BUT
WWHEN ITS HOT ITS VERY HOT!!!..AND ITS FREEZING WHEN COLD....

RESET TABLES:

THIS OPTION IS TO BE USED AT THE END OF A SEASON..THERE ARE THREE OPTIONS:

PROMOTIONS AND REGUALTIONS......1
RESET TABLE TO 0................2
EXIT TO MAIN MENU...............3

OPTION 2 SIMPLY RESETS THE TEAM DETAILS TO ZERO READY FOR A NEW SEASON..IF
YOU SELECT THIS BY MISTAKE, THEN THERE IS AN OPTION TO ABORT. IF YOU
RECEIVE THE PROGRAM AT THE START OF THE SEASON..IT IS POINTLESS IN KEYING
IN ALL THE PREVIOUS SEASONS DATA..AS YOU HAVE TO RESET EVERYTHING BEFORE
THE NEW SEASON STARTS...`POOLSMASTERS` PREDICTIONS ARE ONLY VALID WHEN
WORKING ON THE CURRENT SEASONS FORM.

PROMOTION AND RELEGATION IS WHERE YOU TELL THE COMPUTER WHO HAS GONE UP,
DOWN OR OUT. ENTER THE TEAMS NAME AS BEFORE, PRESS RETURN ONCE AGAIN TO
BRING UP THEIR RESPECTIVE LEAGUE. TO PROMOTE PRESS+ AND TO RELEGATE PRESS
-. TO CHANGE A TEAMS name, ie.if you prefer a different spelling than ours,
OR IF A TEAM GOES OUT OF THE 4TH DIVISION AT THE END OF A SEASON THEN
SELECT THAT TEAMS NAME AS BEFORE, AND PRESS RETURN AGAIN, TO CALL UP THE
LEAGUE..PRESS THE APPROPRIATE KEY TO CHANGE `TEAMS NAME`, THIS IS USUALLY
THE `ESC` KEY BUT IS DISPLAYED AT THE BOTTOM OF YOUR SCREEN IF DIFFERENT.
YOU CAN NOW TYPE IN THE NEW TEAMS NAME..NOTE: THIS IS A DIRECT SUBSTITUTION
YOU CANNOT ADD MORE TEAMS TO THE DATBASE. ANY NEW TEAM MUST DIRECTLY
REPLACE ANOTHER. ONCE YOU HAVE SATISFIED THAT THE DETAILS ARE CORRECT PRESS
THE APPROPRIATE KEY TO ACCEPT IT, AGAIN THIS IS USUALLY THE RETURN KEY, BUT
CAN VARY, SEE YOUR SCREEN DISPLAY IF THE KEY IS DIFFERENT, YOUR NEW DETAILS
WILL THEN BE WRITTEN TO FILE. ENTER 999 UNDER THE TEAM NAME TO QUIT AS
USUAL.

ADDITIONAL NOTES:

ON DISK BASED MACHINES, THE ONLY WAY TO ENSURE YOUR DATA IS SAVED IS TO
SELECT E FOR EXIT PROGRAM FROM THE MAIN MENU. IF YOU HAVE AN UPDATING
SESSION AND HAVE SIMPLY SWITCHED OFF THE MACHINE, OR REMOVED THE DISK
BEFORE, OR WITHOUT PRESSING E FOR EXIT FIRST, THEN IT IS UNLIKLEY THAT YOUR
DATA HAS BEEN SAVED PROPERLY, AND MAY EVEN RESULT IN A CORRUPTED FILE.

CONCLUSION:

THAT CONCLUDES A TOUR OF THE PROGRAM. IT IS VERY  EASY TO USE,BUT IS ALSO
VERY ACCURATE IN ITS PREDICTIONS..A RECENT INDEPENDANT THIRD PARTY STUDY
FOLLOWED ITS PROGRESS THROUGH A SEASON AND FOUND IT MORE ACCURATE THAN THE
NEWSPAPER TIPSTERS OR LAW OF AVERAGES..

TIPS..OBVIOUSLY THE MORE DATA YOU PUT IN THE BETTER THE CHANCES OF A
PREDICTION WHICH WILL WIN YOUR FORTUNE..SO UPDATE REULAR..ALWAYS CHECK WHAT
YOU ENTER BEFORE YOU ENTER IT ON THE DATBASE..FALSE INFO GIVES A FALSE
PREDICTION!!!!....

INSTALLLATION:

THE PROGRAM IS SUPPLIED ON A BOOT DISK (FOR THE AMIGA)..BOOT UP, DOUBLE
CLICK ON THE DISK ICON, THEN DOUBLE CLICK ON THE POOLS ICON. PROGRAM WILL
RUN AS DESCRIBED FROM THERE. THERE ARE FILES WITHIN THE `POOLSMASTER`
DRAWER THAT ARE INVISIBLE FROM WORKBENCH..THEREFORE IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT
YOU DOT MOVE THE `POOLS ICON` FROM THE POOLSMASTER DRAWER.

TIPS FOR ENTERING YOUR WEEKLY COUPON:

IF YOU ARE USING `POOLSMASTER` EARLY ON IN THE SEASON, THEN IT WILL PREDICT
TOO MANY DRAWS (OR AWAYS) AS THERE WILL BE INSUFFICIENT DATA TO SEPERATE
BEST BETS..I THIS CASE THEN USE ONLT THOSE DRAWS WHICH COICIDE WITH THE
SEQUENCE PREDICTOR.

IF THE PROGRAM PREDICTS TOO FEW DRAWS FOR YOUR PLAN, THEN USE THE AWAY WIN
PREDICTIONS AS THE NEXT BET DRAWS. WE RECOMMEND THAT YOU MARK DOWN THE
AWAYS AS DRAWS ANYWAY, AS DRAWS ARE OFTEN FAILED AWAY WINS.

THERE WILL ALWAYS BE A CHANCE FACTOR, SO TRY COMBINING A FEW RANDOM NUMBERS
WITH THE COMPUTERS CHOICE.

WE WOULD STRONGLY RECOMMEND YOU DO THE SMALLER COUPONS LIKE ZETTERS, OR
OTHERWISE VERNONS..WE WOULD ALSO STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU DO NOT JUST
ENTER AN 8 FROM 10 OR AN 8 FROM 11 BECAUSE TO WIN ONE OF THESE ENTRIES YOU
ARE ASKING FOR NEARLY ALL OF YOUR `X`S` TO COME UPO AS DRAWS...WE SUGGEST A
MINMUM OF 15.

FOR A GOOD PERM FOR SYNDICATES USING ZETTERS POOLS, HERES A GOOD FULL PERM,
USING 24 SELECTIONS, WHICH SHOULD WELL COME UP AT SOME STAGE IN THE
SEASON.:

MARK OFF 24 MATCHES (TO THE RIGHT OF TEAMS NAMES FOR PERMS) GROUP THEM INTO
4 GROUPS EITHER WITH BRACKETS OR A THICK LINE, AND MARK THEM A TO D ENTER
ALONGSIDE:

PERM ANY 2 SELECTIONS FROM EACH GROUP A TO D (15X15X15) +50,625 LINES AT
1/20P_25 POUNDS 31 PENCE STAKED.

YES IT IS A LITTLE EXPENSIVE, BUT A 5 PERSON SYNDICATE IS ONLY 5 POUNDS 6
PENCE A WEEK..THE GUARANTEE IS THAT IF YOU GET JUST 2 DRAWS IN EACH OF THE
4 GROUPS THEN YOUR A WINNER....

SO THATS IT..TRY IT AND YOU NEVER KNOW...IT COULD BE YOUR TURN TO.....
SPEND...SPEND....SPEND!!!
