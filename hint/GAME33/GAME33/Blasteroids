Insert disk one and reset the machine. The ST will require the second disk
to be inserted when prompted. The Amiga has only one disk.
Joystick or keyboard can be used. In 2-player mode, both players can use
joysticks, or one player can use the keyboard whilst the other uses a
joystick.
The keyboard always controls the red ship. The second joystick port
controls the green ship. If 2 joysticks are being used, then the first port 
will control the red ship instead of the keyboard. If the keyboard is being 
used for the red ship, then try to avoid moving any device plugged into the 
first port (the mouse for example).

JOYSTICK CONTROLS
Forward = Thrust
Back = Transform                   Right = Rotate clockwise
Left = Rotate anticlockwise        Fire button = Rire

KEYBOARD CONTROLS
P = Thrust
L = Transform                      X = Rotate clockwise
Z = Rotate anticlockwise           SPACE = Fire


OTHER CONTROLS
SHIFT + Q = Abort current game
F10 = Toggle 50/60Hz mode
F9 = Pause                         F6 = Music off
F8 = Restart                       F5 = Music on


TWO PLAYER
By pressing Fire on the second set of controls, a second player can join the
game. This will use one extra credit. Two players can play independently,
or the ships can be DOCKED for extra power and protection. To dock, one
player must be in SPEEDER mode, the other in WARRIOR. Fly the ships
together and they will dock. The WARRIOR pilot flies the SPARLET and 
controls the thrust and has some firepower, the SPEEDER pilot has control
of the TURRET and the most firepower. To disconnect, just transform one
of them into a different mode.
When disconnected, the first player to fly down the exit portal will obtain 
a large bonus and have control of the Galactic Map for the next sector.
