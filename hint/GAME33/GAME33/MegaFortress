       Mouse Play (Limited Keyboard)
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       It is highly recommended that a mouse be used to operate
       Megafortress.  When the mouse is chosen as the prime selection
       tool during startup, all selections in the game can be made by
       moving the pointer to an item and clicking on it with the left
       mouse button.  Selectable items can be buttons, switches,
       objects on radar screens, objects on camera view screens, or
       works on station monitor screens.

       The right mouse button is used to cycle through information
       supplied to database displays associated with maps in the
       mission assignment screens, and the Navigator's MAP mode screen.

       In addition, the "hot key" keyboard commands are available to
       the player from any station.



       KEYBOARD PLAY (NO MOUSE)
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       A determined player can play the game w/o a mouse, using only
       the keyboard.  This is NOT recommended, as the game often
       requires quick reactions that may be hindered by strictly
       keyboard-centered control--but it can be done.
       
       Keyboard play is accomplished by using the arrow keys and space
       bar, three function keys, and the "hot" keys listed at the end
       of this guide.



       ARROW KEYS
       ~~~~~~~~~~
       The arrow keys operate in two modes to select items, and to
       maneuver the aircraft:


       Mode 1: Selection
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       To select an item:


       1) Position the pointer over a selector (selectors can be buttons
       or lights on a panel, or works on a station monitor) as follows:

           A) Use the up and down arrow (panel selector) keys to
              move the game pointer from panel to panel within a
              screen.

           B) Use the left and right arrow or Tab and Shift-Tab
              (object selector) keys to move from selector to
              selector within a panel.


       2)  Tap the space bar.

       For example, since the REGISTER panel is the only panel on its
       screen, only the left and right arrow keys will work, moving
       the pointer within the panel from object to object.



       Mode 2: Flight Control
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       1) Tap the ALT key.  The pointer will change into a small
       airplane symbol, indicating that the arrow keys can now be used
       to make the aircraft turn or climb and descent.
       

       2) Tap the Alt key again to return the arrow keys to the
       selection mode.
       


       Function Keys
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       Three function keys (F8, F9, and F10) are used to cycle through
       and select objects on the CRT monitors at various stations, as
       follows:


                     Pilot, Copilot, EW, and OW Stations
                     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

       F10............. With the monitors at any of these stations set
       to RADAR, tap F10 to cycle through the targets currently displayed.


                          Navigator Station
                          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

       MAP mode, with the WAYPOINT selector turned off:

       F10................ Tap F10 to cycle through the type of information
       currently selected in the small monitor (borders, cities, and highways
       in CIV mode; radars, missiles, and bases in MIL mode)



       MAP mode, with the INS selector switched to EDIT:

       F10..........Tap F10 to move the pointer to the currently selected
       waypoint on the large monitor, or, if the pointer is already on the
       map, tap F10 to move the currently selected waypoint DOWNWARD.



       Shift-F10.......If the pointer is already on the map, hold down the
       Shift key and tap F10 to move the currently selected waypoint UPWARD.



       F9..............If the pointer is already on the map, tap F9 to move
       the currently selected waypoint to the RIGHT.



       Shift-F9.................If the pointer is already on the map, hold
       down the Shift key and tap F9 to move the currently selected waypoint
       to the LEFT.



       F8.........If the pointer is already on the map, tap F* to move the
       pointer to the next waypoint.



       Shift-F8.........If the pointer is already on the map, hold down the
       Shift key and tap F8 to move the pointer to the previous waypoint.



       The up and down arrow (panel selector) keys move the pointer off of
       the map to a new panel.



                   RADAR mode (to set a temporary waypoint)

       F10..............Tap F10 to move the pointer to the radar screen
       and change it to the temporary waypoint cursor, or, if the cursor
       is already on the screen, tap F10 to move it UPWARD.



       Shift F10........Hold down the Shift key and tap F10 to move the
       temporary waypoint cursor DOWNWARD.



       F9..........If the temporary waypoint curson is on the radar screen,
       tap F9 to move it to the RIGHT.



       Shift-F9....If the temporary waypoint cursor is on the radar screen,
       hold down the shift key and tap F9 to move it to the LEFT.



       F8..............If the temporary waypoint cursor is on the radar
       screen, tap F8 to set the temporary waypoint and return the pointer
       to the radar panel.



                                  OW Station
                                  ~~~~~~~~~~


                             SCAN OR ATTACK mode:

       F10............Tap F10 to cycle through the missiles listed to
       the right of the monitor (representing the currently selected
       bar or pylon).



                               CONTROL mode:

       F10...........Tap F10 to cycle through the missiles listed to the
       right of the monitor (representing the currently selected bay or
       pylon).



       F9............For any missiles that operate in more than one mode
       (for example, the AGM-88A), tap F9 to cycle through the modes.



                               CAMERA mode:

       F10.......... Tap the F10 to cycle through the missiles listed to
       the right of the monitor (representing the currently selected bar
       or pylon).


       F8..........Use the 4-way camera switch to maneuver the camera
       until the target is centered under the green aiming cursor, and
       then tap F8 to lock the missile guidance system onto the target
       (a red box will appear if the lock-on is successful). Tap F8 a
       second time to release the lock.
