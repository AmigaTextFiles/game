 SHERLOCK: RIDDLE OF THE CROWN JEWELS

 Well, here you are, standing in the fog outside Holmes's house. Maybe
there's another mystery afoot and you can reclaim some of that excitement
you used to feel. No sense in just standing there staring at the door.
Let's get on with it!

 KNOCK ON DOOR and Mrs. Hudson (my God, is she going to live forever?) will
let you in and inform you that Holmes has been locked in his room for three
days. (You know how moody and depressed he gets.) There's an important
visitor in the parlor, but don't bother trying to go there; you can't get
in there yet. Instead go up to the Vestibule and then north to Holmes'
study.

 You'll find Holmes slumped in his chair apparently ready to use the
hypodermic syringe next to him (full of Vitamin B-12 no doubt). Your first
task is to renew his interest in life. Either of two things will work. GET
NEWSPAPER THEN SHOW IT TO HOLMES. He will immediately come to life. Then
TELL HOLMES ABOUT VISITOR (you can do that first if you wish, either will
work). The visitor will tell Holmes about the theft of the Crown Jewels and
give him a paper which he will give to you. READ PAPER and you will find
four riddles. The answers all have to do with English history but should be
easy to solve for anyone. The answers, in the order of the riddles are:
Westminster Abbey, Queen Elizabeth I, Sir Isaac Newton, and King Henry V.

 Now TAKE KNIFE, GUN, PIPE, SLIPPER. (You don't really need the gun, but
who ever heard of a detective going anywhere unarmed?) Now OPEN BAG then
PUT ALL IN BAG. (You'll be AMAZED at how much this "little" black bag will
hold!) The visitor will then remind you that the jewels must be returned to
the Palace before 9 a.m. on Monday. He will leave, and Holmes will go into
his bedroom (which was locked until now). He'll come right back out and
tell you he will wait for you downstairs.

 Go west into the bedroom. You'll see an ampule on the workbench. GET
AMPULE THEN READ IT and you'll discover it's Etherium. Now TAKE LAMP AND
GLASS and PUT ALL BUT LAMP IN BAG. Now go east, south, and down to the
Entry Hall. The Parlour door is open now, so go north into the Parlour and
GET MATCHBOOK. Then south, OPEN DOOR THEN OUT and you'll be on the sidewalk
where Holmes is waiting for you. He will tell you that you are in charge of
the investigation, and we're ready to start detecting!

 It's very foggy out here so our first job is to LIGHT LAMP. The first clue
in the note was about Westminster Abbey so let's begin there. Following the
map that came with the package go south three times, southeast twice, east
twice, and you're there. You'll see that the sign tells us that we're a
little early, so WAIT UNTIL 7. At 7:00 a.m. TURN OFF LAMP THEN IN. If you
want to explore the Abbey, come back later. Right now you want to get
finished as fast as possible (you'll see why in a minute). From the Nave go
south and southeast, and you'll see some materials for making
brass-rubbings. GET PACKET AND CRAYON then OPEN PACKET. You'll see six
pieces of paper of different colors. Go northwest and north and you're back
at the Nave.

 EXAMINE TOMB and you'll see it's the tomb of Isaac Newton, one of the
names on our list. Now GET YELLOW PAPER THEN PUT IT ON TOMB. Then RUB
YELLOW PAPER WITH CRAYON THEN GET PAPER. You won't see anything exciting on
the paper yet, but wait. Now go east, north, east again, and EXAMINE TOMB.
This is the tomb of Elizabeth I. GET BROWN PAPER THEN PUT IT ON TOMB. Then
RUB PAPER WITH CRAYON THEN GET PAPER. Now go south and west and you'll see
two tombs. GET BLUE PAPER THEN PUT IT ON TOMB. You'll be asked "Which
tomb?" Just type HENRY. Now RUB PAPER WITH CRAYON THEN GET PAPER. Now it's
time to see what all this rigmarole has accomplished.

 Go east, north, west, and north. LOOK and you'll see a lot of candles.
HOLD BLUE PAPER OVER FLAME then TURN PAPER OVER. You'll discover another
riddle! The "Son of Mars" is Admiral Lord Nelson. The second part refers to
the Tower of London. Now HOLD BROWN PAPER OVER FLAME then TURN PAPER OVER
and you'll find another clue referring to Big Ben and the second part
refers to King Charles I, whose head was chopped off.

 Now HOLD YELLOW PAPER OVER FLAME then TURN PAPER OVER and you'll find a
clue referring to Under London Bridge. The second part is about the hardest
riddle. Translated, it says when you need a number at a BANK, subtract 1066
(the date of the Battle of Hastings) from 1666 (the date of the Great
Fire). This will give you 600. (I'll show you where to find this
information as we go along.)

 We've got some solid information now and no time to spare, so go south
twice and west twice. If you've done everything according to these moves
and not wasted any time, you'll just have time to get under London Bridge
at High Tide. Check your copy of the Thames of London for High Tides. If
you miss it here you can do it at the next high tide, but we'll assume you
haven't wasted any time and we'll go take care of it now.

 From the Broad Sanctuary go northeast, north, and east into Scotland Yard.
Now LIGHT LAMP THEN DOWN to the Black Museum. In the boat you'll find an
oar. TAKE OAR THEN UP. Now TURN OFF LAMP THEN WEST. Now north, northeast,
east, and south to the Embankment. GET IN BOAT THEN RAISE ANCHOR. Now
LAUNCH BOAT then ROW EAST until you are Under London Bridge. Then DROP
ANCHOR. Now LOOK AT BRIDGE and you'll see nothing of interest except some
moss. EXAMINE MOSS and you'll see something different about one clump. So
GET MOSS and you'll be left holding an Opal.

 Now RAISE ANCHOR then ROW WEST until you're back at the embankment. LAND
then DROP ANCHOR and LEAVE BOAT. A very angry boat-owner will row off with
the boat, but trust me: you'll be seeing it again. Now, having learned all
you know from Holmes, let's GET GLASS (remember, you put it in your bag)
and EXAMINE OPAL WITH GLASS. Voila! You'll discover the words "Password -
Swordfish" inscribed on it. Now TELL HOLMES ABOUT OPAL and he will tell you
that it's obviously NOT part of the Crown Jewels (but don't despair!) and
he will also give you his ring and tell you that if anything happens to him
you should contact his brother, Mycroft Holmes, at the Diogenes Club.

 Now let's go north, west, then southwest. Take a look at the statue and
you'll discover it's Admiral Lord Nelson! The clue said something about his
"watchful eye," but you'll get nowhere by examining his eye -- the statue
is 167 feet high! Let's leave that for later. For now let's deal with the
Big Ben puzzle. From here go south twice, southeast, and up. Inside the
bell, attached to the clapper, you'll see a blue sapphire. We need a little
preparation here, so GET BLUE BOTTLE from your bag. Then OPEN BLUE BOTTLE
and you'll see some orange pills and some cotton. GET COTTON BALLS THEN PUT
THEM IN EARS, and you're ready for action.

 If you've been following this exactly, it should be a little before 10:00
a.m. WAIT UNTIL 10 (or whatever the next hour is). When the bell begins to
strike GET SAPPHIRE. You may have to do this several times, but eventually
you'll be successful! Now LOOK AT SAPPHIRE WITH GLASS and you'll find "2:00
a.m." inscribed on it. Go down and REMOVE COTTON FROM EARS. (If you don't,
Holmes will soon remind you that you look absurd.)

 We've been working awfully hard so maybe it's time for a relaxing walk in
the park.

 From Parliament go northwest, north three times, east, then south, and
you're in Covent Garden. Suddenly you'll see that a girl has collapsed and
needs medical attention. Remember, even though you are a detective, you're
STILL a doctor!

 The first thing you need to do is get your stethoscope, so REMOVE HAT THEN
GET STETHOSCOPE THEN WEAR IT. (Nope! Everyone else has taken a potshot at
these fairly obscure trivia...I'm not going to comment on it here!) Now
WEAR STETHOSCOPE then LISTEN TO GIRL. This next is a variable. Either the
girl's heart will be beating very fast or very slow. READ BLUE BOTTLE. The
label will either say "Belladonna. For bradycardia and other decelerated
arrhythmias" (slow heartbeats), or it will say "Digitalis leaf. For
tachycardia and other accelerated arrhythmias" (fast heartbeats). Now GET
THE XXXXX AND GIVE IT TO GIRL. If you've given her the proper medication
she will revive, put a carnation in your lapel, and you'll get a round of
applause from the crowd. Now REMOVE STETHOSCOPE THEN PUT IT IN BAG.

 Now it's time to deal with the "chopper" clue. Go north, west, north, then
west, and you'll find yourself in front of the Wax Museum. If you try to
enter the museum, the dog will bark at you and the guard will inform you
they are worried about fire. You're going to need some fire in there, but
we'll have to fool the guard and the dog. Remember the slipper you took?
Well, it has tobacco in it, so GET TOBACCO, PIPE, AND MATCHES. Now PUT
TOBACCO IN PIPE. Then OPEN MATCHBOOK. Now GET MATCH THEN LIGHT IT. And
LIGHT PIPE WITH MATCH. Now you can DROP MATCH, TOBACCO, MATCHBOOK, AND
LAMP.

 Now north and you're in the museum. Holmes will discover a spot of ash on
the floor. You can't waste time at this point so go west into the Chamber
of Horrors. EXAMINE STATUES will tell you that there are three figures
there. EXAMINE FAWKES and you'll see a torch in his hand. GET TORCH then
GET NEWSPAPER (this is why we didn't throw it away!). Now LIGHT NEWSPAPER
WITH PIPE then LIGHT TORCH WITH NEWSPAPER, and we have a source of light!
Now DROP NEWSPAPER then EXAMINE CHARLES. GET HEAD. Now MELT HEAD WITH TORCH
and you'll have an emerald to add to your collection!

 GET GEM THEN EXAMINE IT WITH GLASS and you'll find the date 20/6/87
inscribed on it. If you haven't already done so, now is a good time to DROP
the Packet, all the papers you used for brass-rubbings, and the crayon. You
can also WEAR RING just to get it out of the way, and PUT ALL BUT TORCH AND
GLASS IN BAG. Now go east into the main museum, and on the way out EXAMINE
WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR. This will give you the date of the Battle of
Hastings (the conquest in the clue).

 Go south, GET LAMP, east, south, east twice, south, and west. The Pet
Store owner will tell you all he has is a half-trained pigeon. ASK ABOUT
PIGEON and he'll tell you that all you have to do is show him something
red, and he'll go get it for you. ASK FOR PIGEON and you'll get the bird
(sorry, couldn't resist!). Go east, north, west twice, south three times,
then west, and you'll come across a man selling telescopes. Just the thing
for examining Lord Nelson more closely! ASK ABOUT TELESCOPE and he'll start
his sales pitch. Don't be too eager. He'll tell you you can have it for one
pound. HAGGLE WITH VENDOR and he'll come down to nineteen and six. HAGGLE
WITH VENDOR and he'll come down again to nineteen shillings even. Now
that's better! BUY TELESCOPE and go back east and north twice to the
square. Now LOOK AT EYE THROUGH TELESCOPE. You'll see a ruby in the eye.
SHOW RUBY TO PIGEON. The pigeon will look interested. Say PIGEON, GET RUBY
and he'll start trembling with excitement. Now RELEASE PIGEON, and he'll go
get the ruby. But he'll then take off for parts unknown!

 Not to worry. This is obviously a homing pigeon. So go back to the Pet
Shop by going north, east twice, south, and west. Now ASK ABOUT PIGEON and
Sherman will give you the ruby. EXAMINE RUBY WITH GLASS and you'll see
"wear a carnation." Hmmm, good thing you treated that girl! Now it's time
to deal with the bank. Let's go east, north, and east again. There's a
familiar looking street urchin here, so EXAMINE URCHIN and you'll recognize
him as Wiggins, one of the Baker Street Irregulars. If you try to enter the
bank, the guard will stop you and tell you not to even THINK about bribing
him. Hmmm. EXAMINE GUARD and you'll see he has a bunch of keys which might
come in handy.

 Say WIGGINS, STEAL KEYS, and Wiggins will remind you that the standard
price for Baker Street Irregulars is one shilling. Lucky you didn't pay
full price for the telescope! GIVE SHILLING TO WIGGINS and then repeat your
request. Wiggins will come back with one key, and if you EXAMINE KEY you'll
find it's a Master Key. Now to deal with the guard who doesn't want you to
think about bribing him. Without thinking about it...this man is VERY
greedy. You can give him the gems you've collected one at a time to see his
response to each one, or you can GIVE OPAL, SAPPHIRE, RUBY, AND EMERALD TO
GUARD. Now go north into the bank.

 The vault needs some professional safe-cracking so WEAR STETHOSCOPE. This
MAY be a variable so I'll explain how to crack a safe. LISTEN TO DIAL. Now
TURN DIAL RIGHT (most safe combinations start in that direction. If you are
going in the proper direction you will hear a "whirr." If it doesn't
"whirr," you're going in the wrong direction. Continue turning the dial in
the same direction until you hear a "click." Now TURN DIAL LEFT (or the
other direction) until you hear a "click." Now TURN DIAL RIGHT again (or
the first direction) until you hear a third "click" and a "kerchunk," and
the vault door will swing open.

 You're faced with all those boxes! How to know which one to open? Well,
remember the riddle? The answer is 600, right? So UNLOCK BOX 600 WITH KEY.
Now GET TOPAZ THEN EXAMINE IT WITH GLASS. Holmes will interrupt you to show
you an important clue -- a thread from an Indian turban. You'll see that
the Topaz has "Bar of Gold" inscribed on it. Now go east and south out of
the bank.

 As soon as you leave the bank you will be knocked out, and Holmes will be
kidnapped! Looks like you're on your own from here on, Doctor.

 When you wake up, Wiggins will tell you that he'll help you, and he'll
follow you for the rest of the game. (Good thing, too!) Remembering what
Holmes told you about his brother, go west twice, south twice, southwest,
and west. When the butler asks you if he can help you, ASK ABOUT HOLMES.
He'll return shortly and tell you Mycroft Holmes asked for a token. GIVE
RING TO BUTLER, and Mycroft will show up and tell you the password to get
in the Tower of London.

 Go east, northeast, east, south, and east five times. At this point, a
guard will show up and challenge you. Give him the password you got from
Mycroft, and you'll find yourself in the Outer Ward. Go north twice,
southeast, and up. Here is where the Crown Jewels were kept, and you'll see
the weapon used to break the case. EXAMINE WEAPON and you'll discover it is
a Mace. GET MACE then go down, northwest, and northeast. Here in the Bowyer
Tower you'll see a keg. EXAMINE KEG and you'll see a bung. (That's kind of
a cork to you and me.) You can't pull it out, but HIT BUNG WITH MACE, and
the wine will spill all over the place. (What a waste!). Now EXAMINE KEG
again and you'll see a garnet. You can't reach into the keg (you're too
big), but Wiggins can! Say WIGGINS, GET GARNET, and it's yours! Now EXAMINE
GARNET WITH GLASS and you'll see "Give me to Akbar" inscribed on it.

 Now to get out of here. You CAN'T go back out the front entrance. Trust me
on this one; you really can't. So go southwest, east, and down to the
Dungeon. There's a suit of armor here so WEAR ARMOR, then go up, out, and
south three times. Now you're inside Traitor's Gate. The reason for the
armor is that you're not heavy enough to open the gate by yourself. With
the armor you are. Now PULL CHAIN and REMOVE ARMOR THEN DROP IT. For some
strange reason, there's a paddle lying here so TAKE PADDLE then south.
Remember I told you that the boat would show up again? Well, here it is!
GET IN BOAT then RAISE ANCHOR then LAUNCH BOAT. Now PADDLE west until you
are south of the Embankment then LAND. DROP ANCHOR and GET OUT OF BOAT.

 The only thing remaining now is to follow the instructions on the gems. Go
east twice and down. You'll find yourself outside the Bar of Gold.
According to the gems, the date of your meeting is June 6. If you look at
the Thames of London you'll discover that this makes it Monday morning. If
you've followed all the instructions to the letter, it should be Saturday
night. Nothing left to do but make a few preparations and then wait.

 The ampule of Etherium you took from Holmes's bedroom might come in really
handy. But you're bound to be searched. Where to hide it? Wait a minute!
The guy you're going to contact is named Akbar, and Holmes said the thread
he found was from a turban. Now, these people have a taboo against going
around with their heads uncovered, so you might get to keep your hat.
That's the ticket! REMOVE HAT then PUT AMPULE IN HAT THEN WEAR HAT. Now
we're ready for anything.

 Nothing left to do but pass the time, so WAIT 24 HOURS which will make it
Sunday night. Now WAIT UNTIL 1:59. When you're through waiting, go east
into the Pub. Say PROPRIETOR, SWORDFISH and he will get Akbar for you. (If
you go in early he won't pay any attention to the password.) When the
Indian shows up GIVE GARNET TO AKBAR. He will take you, blindfolded, to the
Lair, stripping you of almost all your possessions along the way...except
for your hat!

 The thief, who turns out, unsurprisingly, to be our old friend, Professor
Moriarty, will start gloating about how clever he is and what he's going to
do to you. Pay no attention. The following actions must be made EXACTLY as
told here -- timing is critical! First REMOVE HAT THEN GET AMPULE FROM HAT.
Now HOLD BREATH THEN BREAK AMPULE. UNTIE HOLMES THEN TIE AKBAR TO MORIARTY
THEN TAKE KEY.

 At this point, you'll pass out from the Ether, too. Since you tied up the
bad guys before passing out you're safe. When you wake up, you STILL don't
have any time to lose, so GET WHISTLE AND JEWELS. Now UNLOCK DOOR WITH KEY
THEN OPEN DOOR then OUT.

 This next little secret is revealed NOWHERE except in the sample script in
the instruction book (a sneaky little move on Infocom's part). BLOW WHISTLE
then BLOW WHISTLE again, and a Hansom cab will show up. GET IN CAB and when
you're asked "Where to?" say PALACE. Once there, LEAVE CAB then GIVE JEWELS
TO GUARD.

 Now sit back and wait for your audience with the Queen and the
satisfaction of having performed every bit as well as the Master Detective
himself!
