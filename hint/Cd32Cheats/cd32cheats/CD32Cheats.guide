@{fg shine}The Complete Solution@{fg text}

Go to the left and take the loose rung from the top of the stairs, then go to
the right and use it to prize open the door. Go outside and hide behind the
door until the guard walks off, then go back inside and down the stairs.
 Go through the door on the right.  Examine the junk - there's three separate
bits.  Insert Joey's circuit board in the middle one then stand on the lift to
make Hobbins appear.  When he comes, quickly duck through the door, open the
cupboard and take the spanner from inside.  If Hobbins returns before you've
got it, he'll stop you.  You'll just have to go back out and repeat the
process.
 Next examine the transporter then keep talking to Hobbins until you find out
what's wrong with it. Then ask Joey to fix it. It will go off and come back
with a box. When it puts the box on the elevator it will descend, leaving the
shaft open. Now's your chance to climb down.
 In the furnace room, examine the slot then ask Joey to open it. Reich will
walk in and get killed. Examine the body and take his ID card then you can
leave the room.

The next place to visit is Lamb's factory. Talk to Anita and then have a word
with Lamb. Then go and stick the spanner in the exposed cogs near where Potts
is working. Once Potts has examined the damage and gone back to work you can
recover the spanner. Go and examine the now idle droid to the left then loosen
its shell using the spanner. Talk to Joey and offer him the new shell. Send
Joey into the store-room and have him destroy the fuse box allowing you to
enter unimpeded. Lift up the gangway and take the putty from the floor. You
can ignore the WD40 and key.
 Go across to the far left where the old man is sleeping and loosen the
buttons on the steam machine using the spanner. When Joey arrives, tell him to
press the right button and you press the left one at the same time. The steam
machine will blow up and the old man will run off. Now go and flick the switch
on the yellow console, remove the light bulb and replace it with the putty. Go
back and flick the switch once more to blow the door off then pull the right
hand lever to restore the power to the lift.
 Go to the lift screen and examine the red cable, then get Joey to work on it.
He'll burn through it with his welder and it'll drop to the floor below. Use
Reich's card to enter the lift then go down and collect the cable. Find
Reich's apartment and enter using his card. Take the magazine from under the
pillow then visit the travel agent. Ask for an economy tour and when he
refuses you a ticket hand him the mag. Go back to level one and hang around by
the lift until Lamb arrives. Talk to him until he tells you he needs a holiday
then give him your ticket and in return he'll give you a tour of his factory.
Go to the factory, find Lamb and remind him about the tour then go right, past
Potts and talk to Anita. Give her the ID card and she'll install the jammer
while telling you about the Schreibman Port.
 Leave the factory and wait by the terminal until Lamb appears then use
Reich's ID card on the terminal to enter the code from the yellow security
manual (that's the one which came with the game).  Authorise aD-Linc on Lamb
and then leave the terminal.

After Lamb finds he's unable to use the lift, talk to him and offer to feed
his cat.  When you get inside his apartment, get the video cassette from on
top of the bookshelf.
 Visit Burke's BioSurgery, activate the projector and talk to the hologram.
Wait until you've asked her for the Schreibman Port then get Joey to talk to
her and go into the surgery.  Ask the doctor for a port.  First offer him a
lung, followed by a kidney, and finally your testicles.  Keep talking to him
after the port until he tells you about Anchor Insurance.  Visit Anchor and
ask for a policy, tell them Burke sent you.  Willy Anchor will go off to make
a phone call.  Immediately get Joey to remove the anchor from the statue, then
collect it.  Combine it with the red cable to make a grappling hook.
 Now return to the first screen you appeared on, go up the stairs and through
the door.  Use the grappling hook on the sign on the building opposite and
swing across the gap.  Then grab the cable and leave through the door.

Insert Reich's ID in the slot then sit down in the interface and wait until
you enter the game.  Touch the ball and exit right.  Open the bag (via the
inventory) to get the magnifying glass (DECRYPT) and the birthday surprise
(DECOMPRESS).  Next use the decompress option from the menu on the ball to get
red and green passwords.  Leave right using the red password on the first
floor tile.  The simply follow the logical route to the exit.  Pick up the
bust and the book then decrypt the three coded documents.  Now disconnect.

Use the Linc terminal to read all the documents and use the Special Operations
section temporarily increase your Linc status to unlimited.  Put the ID card
in the slot and you'll be taken to Sam and Norville's security room.  Enter
the lift and go down then enter the second lift and go down again.  When Joey
falls, take his circuit board.

Talk to the fat lady, then go to the night club and have a word with the
bouncer.  Keep talking until he tells you Mrs Piermont may be able to sponsor
you.  Go and talk to her again, then, when she returns to her flat, ring the
bell.  When you get in keep talking to her until she goes to use the phone,
then put the video tape in her VCR.  When the dog goes to watch it you can
grabs his biscuits.

Go to the lift screen and put the biscuits on the plank then leave the screen
and wander about a bit before coming back.  The dog should be barking at the
biscuits.  Pull the rope so the dog climbs onto the plank then release it and
he'll fall in the pond.  When the guard comes to help him you can duck inside
the cathedral.  Go through the door and open the middle locker.

Go back to where Anita was working and open the middle locker.  Take the
overalls and put them on then go right.  Use the control panel to open the
reactor door then go in and get the ID card.  Leave, close the door, take off
your protective suit and head back to the interface room.  Enter the interface
using Anita's card.

Get the tuning fork and play her a message.  To get the tuning fork, first
blind the eye then go through the computer as quickly as you can.  Exit the
room and blind the second eye, exit centre and centre again.  Exit right and
select PLAYBACK from the inventory to use on the well.
 You can then disconnect.

Go to the ground level and talk to the gardener and then the boy who tells you
the gardener was lying.  Talk to the gardener again then leave by the near
side door.  Run your ID through the lock.  Get the secateurs from on top of
the barrel then go back to the nightclub and talk to the bouncer once more.
 Go in and turn on the jukebox.  Choose any toon then return to Burke's
surgery.  Give the glass to Burke in exchange for Colston's fingerprints.

Go back to the club and put your hand on the metal plate at the back of the
building by the door.  Leave via the right hand side of the screen, use the
crowbar on the packing case and take the lid.  Put it on topof the smaller box
and climb on top.  Use the bar and then the secateurs on the grill and climb
into the resulting passage.  Inside, exit to the right and turn through the
diverting tunnel and then again to the right until the section with a whole
(find it by tracing the cursor with a cable).  Exit right, right again and
exit at the bottom of the sloping tunnel.

Select the crowbar and use it on the plaster at the back of the room and then
on the bricks to force one of them loose then collect it.  Stick the metal bar
into the swollen vein right of the horizontal beam and smack it one with the
brick.  Pick up the bar and walk off to the right when the droid shows up.

Look through the grill then leave via the left hand door.  Walk down the
stairs, go up to the console and use it to lower the temperature then go back
up the stairs and pull the metal bar on the grill.  Leave the room, leave the
corridor by the right and go right again.  Put Joey's board in the robot.
 Tell Joey to have a look in the tank room then get him to open the tap on the
nutrient tank.  You can now enter the tank room yourself.

Go to the right through the back of the room and, same again and then through
the door.  Use Reich's card on the terminal.  Press 2 to enter the restricted
area.  Exit the room and, after the struggle, take Joey's board and check out
the body to get a new ID.  Use it on the interface.

Blind the eye, enter the crusader's room.  Use Divine Wrath on the crusader
then disconnect.  Re-enter the interface with Anita's card and go back into
the crusader's room.  Use Oscillator on the crystal and get the Helix then
disconnect once more.

Leave the control room and go into the room from which Gallagher came.  Insert
Anita's card in the console and it'll crash.  Get the tongs then leave via the
right hand side of the screen.  Use the tongs to get the flesh from the
aquarium.  Put the fish in the other tank then exit right.  Open the middle
cabinet and insert Joey's board.  Download the character data using the
console then run the programme and exit right.  Tell Joey to put his hand on
the sensor.  Put your hand on the other sensor at the same time.  Laeve and
exit right.  Use the cable on the pipe support.  Climb down and drop the flesh
into the orifice.  An exit will then appear.  Swing across using the cable
and, when you get the chance, ask Joey to sit in the chair.  Now simply talk
to Joey to complete the game.  Easy, eh?

When you're about to enter the Pod Bay at the start, and it goes to the cut
sequence, pause the game and press the following buttons:-

 @{b}Green - Blue - Yellow - Red - Yellow - Down - Green - Right - Red - Up@{ub}

The Title screen will turn black and white and the cheat will be activated.
With this cheat, you're invulnerable; you can also warp around the map and
have all the guns on the next level you play. To warp around the map, simply
bring the map up.  There's a solid white block displaying your location and
another outlineed block, press either the Blue or the Yellow button; to warp
to that point, press the Green button. The only drawback to this cheat is that
all the amazing cut sequences are in black and white.  There are various other
codes which do the same thing at different parts of the game.  You can find
these by pausing the game and  pressing all the buttons until you find one
that makes a different sound to the others.  Press it then you have to find
the next one that makes the same noise.  Keep doing this until it makes that
noise and the cut sequences are in black and white.

@{fg shine}Or try the following:-@{fg text}

At the start of level one, turn right and at the next crossroads push up.
Pause the game, press @{b}Yellow, Red, Green, Blue, Up and Left@{ub}.  Unpause and
you'll be completely invincible.

 As a cop he's here solely on business.  A murder suspect is roaming large

justice.  For a cop, Yurgen seems to play extremely dirty.  Not only does he
carry a truncheon into battle, he can whip out his gun and shoot his
opponents.  This makes him a dangerous  foe and one not to be taken lightly.

     find a box of @{b}matches@{ub} on top of the fruit machine, so pick them up.
     Then walk over to the dwarf and cut off his beard with the scissors.
     Engage the nubile valkyries in conversation and then walk across to
     the adjoining room.

  4. Talk to the wizard's about becoming one yourself. If you're persistent
     they'll send you off on a quest to find a @{b}crystall staff@{ub}. Leave the
     pub, and head off to the left.

  5. Continue walking left past 'The Shoppe'.

  6. Outside the village gates follow the path to the right.

  7. Keep going right.

  8. Offer to help the @{b}whingeing Barbarian@{ub} by pulling the thorn out of his
     foot, and in exchange he'll give you a @{b}blocked whistle@{ub}. Take the road
     going up.

  9. At the juction turn right.

 10. Walk past the owl. It will wake up and call you over for a chat, but
     don't get too involved in a conversation because it talks rubbish!
     The only useful purpose that the owl serves is dropping one of it's
     @{b}feathers@{ub}, so don't forget to pick it up before heading off to the
     right.

 11. Continue walking to the right.

 12. At the five-pointed crossroads, take the first exit to the right
     (going down).

 13. Head on left past the spot where the Barbarian had been crying.

 14. Turn off at the junction, heading down.

 15. Continue walking right, past the fallen white tree.

 16. At the junction turn right and head down.

 17. Continue walking left.

 18. Outside the witch's cottage turn the well handle to raise a bucket
     of water, and pick it up. Back track up the path the way you came
     from. At the junction turn right.

 19. As you walk past the tree stump, the woodworms will start talking to
     you. They will send you on a sub-quest to find some wood. This is one
     of the funniest scenes in the game. Head off to the right.

 20. Continue walking right until you find a path cross a bridge blocked
     by a Troll taking industrial action.

 21. Keep him talking until he notices the whistle round your neck. Offer
     it to him for him to blow it, and watch the look of horror on his
     face as th Barbarian jumps out of nowhere to kick the ungrateful Troll
     into the river. You can now safely cross over the bridge.

 22. At the Y-junction take the upper road and continue right, crossing
     another stone bridge.

 23. Talk to the idiot sitting by the tree. Use the bucket of water from
     the well to soak his beans. Simon will then exit right. Make him go
     back to pick up the beans from the puddle.

 24. Use the map facility to return to where you met the owl. From there
     head right. You'll come to the star-shaped crossroads again. Take the
     path heading towards the top right.

 25. You'll come across an excavation site. Have a word with the
     ostentatious paleontologist digging in the hole. Continue heading up
     the road.

 26. You are now in the centre of the forest. Pick up the stone next to
     the dwarf mine and examine it, as it contains a password. Take the
     first set of steps leading above the mine.

 27. Pick up the piece of paper near the big doors and examine it (it's a
     shopping list). Go back to the entrance of the mine and follow the
     road to the right.

 28. Converse with the miserable wood-cutter until he shows you his metal
     detector. Ask to borrow it.

 29. Use the map to get you over to the crossroads. Once there, take the
     path leading down the right-hand corner.

 30. Join the clapper you took from the Blacksmith's bench with the bell,
     and ring it. The maiden will cast her pony-tail out, Rapunzel-style,
     so use her hair as a rope to climb up the tower.

 31. After the maiden has transformed, pick up the piglet and return to
     the village. Head up the little alleyway next to 'The Shoppe'.

 32. Don't get to involved with the dodgy geezer, as at this stage he's
     of little use to you. Walk past him to the other side.

 33. Pick up the ladder which is leaning against the wall. Walk inside the
     Druid's cottage.

 34. Inside you'll find some cold remedy and a specimen jar. Pick them up.
     Cross over to the left once you leave the cottage.

 35. Use the little piglet to eat its way through the chocolate truffle
     door, and enter.

 36. Pick up the smoke box and hat and go back out.

 37. Walk round to the beehive and use the matches to light the smoke box.
     When activity within the apiary has ceased you can swipe some nice
     wax. Now go back to Calypso's cottage and walk round to the back yard.

 38. Plant the beans taken from the idle idiot who you encountered earlier
     in the magic compost, and pick up the water melon that grows there.
     Go to the pub.

 39. Ask the barman for a drink, and while he stoops down to look for it,
     use the wax to block the tap of the barrel behind the bar. The barman
     will give you a beer voucher as compensation for not having your drink
     in stock. Leave the pub.

 40. Pick up the defective beer barrel left outside by the publican.

 41. Go to the dwarf mine. Put on the beard and go in, giving the password
     you found on the stone outside the mine.

 42. Make as if to walk past the sleeping guard. The accountant sitting at
     the table will wake him. You'll be challenged by the guard, so bribe
     him with the one thing that dwarves have effection for (other than
     snow white!) - beer. He'll take you and the beer barrel down with him
     into the cellar.

 43. Once there, use the owl feather to tickle the snoring dwarf's smelly
     feet. He'll keel over, revealing a key. Pick it up and go back
     upstairs.

 44. Go down the stairs where the guard stopped you. The accountant will
     scream blue murder, but there's nothing he can do to stop you, so you
     can afford a self-righteous smile as you walk past his bemused face.

 45. Unlock the safe door with the key.

 46. Offer the beer voucher to the dwarf inside. He'll reward you with a
     gem before unceremoniously turning you out. Don't forget to pick up
     the hook under the safe door.

 47. Use the map to get to the owl tree. Follow the path going right to the
     five-pointed crossroads, and head straight on, going the way that
     Simon is facing.

 48. You'll come across a noisy busker playing his musical instrument
     rather badly. Launch the water melon at his organ, which will soon
     come into your possession.

 49. Journey to the centre of the forest using your map, and go up the
     stairs on the right.

 50. Go into the cave and follow the stone path. Cross the swamp and walk
     past the statues. When you reach the sleeping giant, use the
     sousaphone to stir him from his deep sleep. He'll unwillingly knock
     down a tree, providing you with an improvised bridge. Get across and
     enter the dragon's cave for an amusing encounter. Return to the
     village.

 51. Walk up the little alley next to 'The Shoppe' and sell your gem to the
     dodgy geezer for twenty gold pieces. Backtrack to the shop when the
     transaction has been completed.

 52. Hand over the shopping list to the shop keeper. Whilst there, you may
     as well buy some white spirit and a hammer, with which you will
     recieve a complimentary free nail (no expense spared, eh?). Venture
     back to the swamp. Walk up to the house and knock on the door.

 53. Unfortunately, you now have to consume the stew - indeed, you'll have
     to eat a second bowl of the vile stuff. When the demented swampling
     serves you with a third bowl, however, empty its maggot-infested
     contents into the specimen jar. The swampling will obsessively try to
     serve you more of its evil concoction, but will mercifully find an
     empty cauldron. It will then head off out of the house with its little
     net to fish some gunge out of the local sewer, no doubt. Take this
     opportunity to reward the swampling's hospitality by snooping around
     its home. Move the wooden chest. Open the trapdoor beneath and climb
     down the ladder.

 54. Hammer the nail on the loose plank, and walk across to Skull Island.
     Pick up the frogsbane and use the map to get to the dragon's cave.

 55. Use the cold remedy on the dragon to help him rest. Cast the hook at
     the boulder on top of the cave's entrance and climb up. Tie the
     magnet to the rope, and lower it down the hole to gain some gold
     coins. Climb down.

 56. Walk to the right behind the cave, and continue until you come across
     some climbing pins with a gap. Forget about them - just jump across
     the icy ledge beneath. You'll eventually come across an old tree.
     Talk to it, then use the white spirit to get rid of the pink splodge
     on its bark. If you speak with the tree again you'll get some nagic
     words from it. Backtrack through the snow to the gargantuan face
     etched into the rock. Pick up the smaller rock scattered nearby. Go
     back inside the dragon's cave and pick up the fire extinguisher. Goto
     the place where the giant is sleeping, and head to the left.

 57. When you reach the statue of the wizard, get out the metal detector
     and find the milrith.

 58. Goto the Blacksmith and place a rock upon his anvil. He'll break it
     up, revealing a fossil within.

 59. Use the map to get to the centre of the forest, and take the left
     footpath to the excavations. Throw the fossil down to the digger.
     When he asks you where you found it, tell him 'Craggy Peaks', and
     he'll accommodate you by providing cheap labour.

 60. Get yourself to Craggy Peaks, where you left the metal detector. Dr.
     Jones has wasted no time on his new excavations. If you examine the
     dirt you'll find the milrith ore. Next, it's time to visit the wood-
     cutter again.

 61. Tell him the good news. He, in turn, will send you to the Blacksmith.

 62. As you did with the rock earlier on, place the milrith on the anvil
     and the Balcksmith will shape it into an axe-head. Take the finished
     product to the wood-cutter.

 63. The wood-cutter will take the axe and leave without shutting the door
     to his house, so why not reward his faith in humanity by breaking in?

 64. Inside his cottage you'll find a climbing pin on the table. Feel free
     to take it. Next, put out the fire with the fire extinguisher. Move
     the hook in the fireplace to go down into the basement.

 65. Help yourself to some mahogany and take it to the starving woodworms.
     They'll jump into your hat. Use your map to get to the crossroads.
     Take the path at the bottom right corner.

 66. Climb up the tower where you rescued the maiden and the pig ealier on.
     Unleash the woodworms onto the floorboards to get you onto ground
     level.

 67. Pick up the wedge securing the entrance door and then use the ladder
     to climb down into the basement.

 68. Open up the sarcophagus. You have to be quick with the next operation
     other wise Simon will get cold feet and run off, leaving you to try
     again. Search out the loose bandage with the mouse pointer, and use
     the 'pick-up' command with it in order to take care of the mummy.
     Pick up the crystal staff and take it to the four wizards with whom
     you spoke in the pub.

 69. The wizards will greedily ask you also to pay a registration fee of
     thirty gold pieces. If you haven't got enough money, then venture
     back to the top of the dragon's cave to fish out some more using the
     magnet. You should end up with forty-one gold pieces altogether.
     Give the wizards their money, and they'll give you a wizard's starter
     pack. Take special note of the allegory with modern-day banking
     institutions.

 70. Use the map to get to the crossroads, and take the little alley
     heading up to the right. When you reach the waterfall, search around
     the bottom left-hand corner where you'll find a vine. Use it to climb
     down.

 71. At the bottom you'll find a Gollum impersonator angling. Swap the
     swamp stew for the fishing rod to find the ring. Goto the village.

 72. The shop-keeper has finished the order, so climb into the cardboard
     box outside the shop.

 73. When you arrive at your destination, open up the box and climb out.
     If you search around the empty boxes you'll find your spell book.
     Inside the book you'll discover a loose piece of paper. Search with
     the mouse pointer between the boxes and the door to find a rat bone.
     Slide the piece of paper underneath the door, then use the rat bone
     to push the key off the lock on the other side so that it will fall
     on the paper. Pull back the piece of paper with the key on it to
     unlock the door. Open it and get out of the stockroom.

 74. Pick up the metal bucket with the hole in it outside the cells, and
     descend down the stairs.

 75. Pick up the mints near the dungeon window. Chat with the Druid who's
     tied up on the rack. After a while he will ignore you and refuse to
     talk any further. Take off the ring of invisibility and resume the
     conversation. He will put you through a test to make sure that you're
     not evil. Pick up the flaming brand next to the sharp objects. Place
     the metal bucket on the Druid's head. Use the flaming brand on the
     bucket to turn the Druid into a frog. Open up the Iron maiden, and
     hide in there for a few days until the frog returns with a hacksaw.
     Use it to cut through the bars so you can escape. Goto the Druid's
     cottage (where you picked up the cold remedy).

 76. The Druid will give you a magic potion in exchange for the frogsbane
     found on Skull Island. Goto the witch's cottage.

 77. Pick up the broom to conjure up the witch. Take up the hag's challenge
     to a duel. Use the words given to you by the talking tree. If you lose
     (the battle is a form of scissors, paper, stone, using spells and
     counter-spells) just keep going back until you win. Take the broom-
     stick as your reward. The witch will metamorphose into a slovenly
     dragon. All you have to do is say 'Abracadabra' to turn yourself into
     a tiny mouse. Make your escape through the mouse-hole along the edge
     of the top wall.

 78. Climb up the snowy mountains until you reach the ferocious snowman.
     Use the extra-strong mints to melt him to oblivion. Continue your
     upward climb.

 79. When you reach the castle, use the broomstick to get to the door.
     Drink up the Druid's potion and you'll shrink small enough to creep
     in through the bottom.

 80. Pick up the leafin the garden. Walk inside the rusty old bucket. If
     you look around you'll find a match, and outside, near the bucket,
     you'll also find a stone. Carry on walking left.

 81. Use the dog hair to lasso onto the tap, then pick up the leaf floating
     on the pond and bring it ashore. Use the matchstick as a mast and the
     other leaf as a sail to make an improvised boat. Pick up some seeds
     from the red pots next to the tap and bring them back. Use the stone
     to pulp the seeds into an oil which you can use to lubricate the
     jammed tap. Pull the hair to open the pub, and get on the boat to
     cross the nowirrigated puddle.

 82. You'll be confronted by a large frog on your arrival. Look in the
     water, however, and you'll find a little tadpole. Pick it up and use
     it as a hostage to negotiate peace terms with the amphibian menace.
     When the frog flees you'll find some yellow mushrooms. Eat one to
     return to your normal size.

 83. Pick a branch off the tree and open the door. The wooden chest inside
     will spring to life and chase you out. Go back and use the branch to
     jam its lethal jaws. Pick up the spear from the rack and the shield
     from by the stairs. Go on up.

 84. Pick up the magic wand on the dresser, the green sack next to the bed,
     the blue money-pouch on the bed and the book on the pink pillow at the
     right. Read the book. Speak to the mirror, then go upstairs to the
     second floor.

 85. Pick up the chemicals on the bench in the middle of the lab, then walk
     round to the bookcase and pick up Sordid's spell book. Use the
     chemicals to renew the shine on the shield, and hang the shield on the
     hook protruding from the front of the bench. See what bits of inform-
     -ation you can extract from the lower-class demons, and go down the
     stairs.

 86. Talk the mirror into spying on the demons upstairs for you so that you
     can find out their real names. Go downstairs all the way to the
     dungeon in the basement.

 87. Using the spear, knock off the skull hanging ceiling and pick it up
     from the floor. Walk over to the other side of the dungeon and pick up
     the chest. Return and pull the lever on the crushing machine next to
     the footbridge. Place the chest on the block and push the lever. Pull
     the lever to raise the block up again. You'll find the candles you
     need for your demonic incantation amongst the ruins. Go upstairs to
     the bedroom with the mirror.

 88. Look down at the side of the staircase to find a small mouse-hole.
     Put the cheesy green sock inside the blue pouch, and use it to coax
     the mouse out of its dwelling, and consequently entrapping it. Go
     upstairs for a chat with the demons.

 89. If you help the demons return to their dimension, they will assist
     you with the teleporter. They will give you the chalk with which to
     draw the square on the floor. When you've exorcised them, walk over
     to the teleporter and use it to get to the 'Fiery Pits of Rondor'.

 90. When you materialize, search around with the mouse pointer until you
     find a pebble nearby. Pick it up. To your left is a small sapling.
     Pick it up. Talk to the attendant and he'll give you some brochures.
     Look at the brochures to find an elastic band. Use the band together
     with the sapling to create a catapult. Fire the pebble at the red bell
     to get rid of the pesky attendant. Pick up the souvenir matches at the
     corner of the stall and head for the pits.

 91. Cross the bridge, picking up the bucket of floor wax, and head for the
     fiery pits.

 92. Use the magic wand on Sordid to let him taste some of his own
     medicine. Light up the fiery pits with the matches. Cast the wand
     into the flames to return the statues to life. Sordid will attack you,
     but you'll survive, so go back and use the floor wax on him. If you
     don't succeed, try again until he falls over, then kick him into the
     pit.
