                          By Alberto Manuel Ordóñez

1. Introduction:

This program can show and optionally save in IFF format some PlayStation
pics on your amiga.

2. Requeriments:

Any Amiga with AGA graphics, OS 2.0+, asl.library, some chip memory, a
CD-ROM drive capable of read PlayStation disks and at least one of these
disks.

3. Installation:

Drag the icon to any place in your hard disk.

4. Usage:

Insert a PlayStation disk in the CD-ROM, double-click on the PSX-View icon
and an ASL requester will appear, select the volume in CD0: then select a
file to view, if you want to save it in IFF format, press the "S" key, then
another ASL requester will appear asking you the name of the file to create.

The length of the pic files must be any of this 153600, 163840, 307200,
327680 or 524288 bytes or a bit more, this is because the pics are archived
in RAW format and sometimes they have a little header and frequently they
have the ".tim" extension.

If you select a binary data file, the program will display the data and you
can see a trashed screen.

The pics are TRUE color but I don't know how to convert to HAM8, so the
pics are displayed in 256 colors. To improve image quality you can activate
the dithering option, this can be activated adding the DITHER tooltype to
the PSX-View icon.

If you have a PlayStation you must have a CD called "Demo 1" a demonstration
CD that is included with the PlayStation, in the European version of that CD
you can find the next pics:

CD0:Basket/Title.tim          (Total NBA demo title screen)
CD0:Dd/Logo.tim               (What is this?)
       Warning.tim            (The copyright pic.)
CD0:Dddemo/Loading1.          (Loading screen of Destruction Derby demo)
CD0:Dddemo/Screens_/40player. (Some Destruction Derby demo pics)

                    Nightdri.
                    Timetria.

        Loading.tim           (Loading screen of Wipeout demo)
        NegPad.tim            (NegCon controls screen of Wipeout demo)
        NormPad.tim           (Normal controls screen of Wipeout demo)
        Palback.tim           (Menu background pic of Wipeout demo)
        Palhigh.tim           (Highscores background again a bit larger)
        Palload.tim           (Loading screen again a bit larger)
        Paltitle.tim          (Title screen of Wipeout demo)
        Solaar.tim            (Win screen of Wipeout demo)
        Wipeout.tim           (Menu background pic again a bit shorter)
        Wiptitle.tim          (Title screen again a bit shorter & diferent)

26 pics is not too bad for one CD...

Some PSX games have standard gfx files, I know two:
EXTREME PINBALL  the tables are in standard .PCX format.
KRAZY IVAN       there is some .LBM standard pics overthere.
