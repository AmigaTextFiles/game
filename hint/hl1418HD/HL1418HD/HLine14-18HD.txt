-------------------------------------------------------

   This ancient  Blue Byte   game had been in deep coma on my hard disk for some
time  because  it could  only be  run from the   Early Startup Shell  by  emulating 
the ECS chipset.  It is a magnificent strategy game for its time with a quite tough
AI and it drives you crazy with its generosity for the computer player.  It is very
addictive too  -for the dedicated strategist !  Read  below  about how to make the 
computer player a sitting duck !

   First how to run it from Workbench by double clicking its icon:

   Let us assume that you have HD-installed the game with the installer script that 
came with the seven disk pack.See what happens when you try to double-click the 
Program  or  Intro  icons. All you get is a scrambled screen and horrible sounds... 
Because this game was made for the A500 system and would not run on a A1200 
without degrading it.

   I have tried it with Killaga , ECSLaunch , etc. None of them could run the game.
Recently, after many trials  I have managed to configure a start script  with  TUDE 
(The Ultimate Degrader & Enhancer by N.O.M.A.D)  that launches  HL14-18  from  
Workbench in a jiffy !. TUDE  is PD-ware and is available from  Aminet  (util/misc/
tude.lha  26 K ).

   Now if you want to run this cool strategy game from your hard disk  and from 
Workbench  (and kick some  French, German or English ass under the  Great War)
copy the  TUDE  program , 20132 bytes ,(only the executable, not the icon files) 
to some place in your path ,(e.g. C:), and copy the Start icon, which is included in
this archive, to  HL14-18  drawer. Now there is a little trick to play here : There is
a file named BBStart within the c subdirectory within HL14-18 directory. It is used
by the  Start script and it must be in the same directory as the  Start  icon. So just
drag it (copy) out to the HL14-18 root directory.That's it,just click and enjoy.

   The start script  (read TUDE ! ) hardresets the Amiga whenever you chose to 
quit the game, so you come back to a fresh Workbench screen instead of the gray
AmigaDOS screen.

   A few lines of advice here:
   The game uses the German keyboard layout. So if you are asked to press (Y) to 
confirm something during the game just press (Z) instead.
   Keyboard response is very sluggish (I don't know if it is my Amiga or the game 
program)  but  very often you have to press a key  a  few  times to get  response. 
Especially when you will type a level password,  you will have to enter it  twice to 
get it accepted.

   Now about how to CHEAT and make the computer player croak ! :

   You need a Hex Editor to edit soma data files.
   
1- If you choose to play the game as GERMANY against computer:

   The first and most important thing to do is make a copy of the MAP  sub-
directory in the HL14-18 drawer and rename the "Copy of  Map" as  "Map_org".
So if you make a mistake in editing you can always make a new copy from the
Map_org drawer.

   *You can make your army stronger (and the opponent weaker)  by HEX-editing 
some data files in the MAP subdirectory. The files to edit have (.SHP) as extension. 
00.SHP  to  23.SHP  are levels for human player as  AXIS against computer player 
as ENTENTE, 24.SHP to 47.SHP are for human as  ENTENTE,  48.SHP  to 71.SHP
are levels for two human players against each other.

   *You will get  7 Armoured Cars at your HQ by increasing the value of the byte  
at the position (hex) 33 by one -e.g. if it is 04 make it 05 ,(09 to 0A,0B to 0C etc)
This applies to all  (.SHP) files from 00.SHP to 23.SHP. This will help you to stand
against the usual enemy surge at the begining of the level.Do not increase this value
with more than 1 otherwise the map wouldn't load.
 
   *You can increase or decrease the  "resources income"  of the two sides by first 
starting a level and writing down the values that the stores and factories have and 
then hexediting them in the respective .SHP file. For example if one of your stores 
has 15 (0F) resources,you can change this to 255 by overwriting  0F with FF. Or if 
your opponent has "too much geld" you can take him down a bit too !. Thus you 
can create new units or refurbish cutdown units rightaway which otherwise require 
much time to accumulate the necessary amount. But do not go in excess with this 
Robin  Hooding , the game might become  "too easy to play".

   The most ingenious feature of this game is that; when you repair a unit, which has
been cut down to e.g. 1 man (vehicle or weapon) but has increased its experiece points
to  e.g. 6, retains its experience (or hitpoints -denoted by the sign beside their
numbers) after the repair.Those with cross sign (6 hp) are almost invincible !.So you
multiply your power by repairing the experienced units rather than creating new ones!.
I think this is the key to success in this game if you are going to play it without
cheating.Tell you what, it is absolutely impossible to win any level beyond level 5
without cheating or trying it hundreds of times. It is like playing chess with 50-80
pieces against an unfair computer.Normaly the computer allocates more units to the
computer player, gives them the most favorable positions,and gives him more resources
than the human player !.OK,if you think that this is the main point in computer games,
go on playing without cheat !.

   By the way ,in order to "have seven armoured cars at your headquarters cheat" 
function, you have to reset your computer after a completed level.It seems 
to function from coldstart only,especially when new types of units are introduced
or some messages shown at the start of a new level.


2- If you choose to play the game as FRANCE against the computer:

   *I have not yet discovered a trick to put extra units in the HQ, but editing
the French XX.SHP files are much easier and straightforward.Files to edit are from
24.SHP to 47.SHP :

   Just edit the byte at position 43(hex). The highest value you can put here
is 255 (FF).So you get 255 resources right at your Headquarters to start with.You 
can also edit the stores and the factories as well.


3- If you will play againts a friend ( and make him a sitting duck too !) :

   First of all you need a "Mouse-joystick swicth" plugged in the mouse port for
the mouse control in the game is absolutely useless (but the mouse functions OK
in the Menu screens).So both players use own joystick.

   Edit the .SHP files 48 t0 71 in the same manner as the previous ones:
   Position 33 for German HQ  and  position 43 for French HQ.

If  you succesfully use this patch on your  Amiga  or if you have difficulties with
running other games from harddisk, please drop me a line at my  e-mail  address 
below.I might have solutions for other game-problems too.

Let me remind you that TUDE which does a perfect job with my hardware and its
present configuration might not function for yours.In that case you will have to
experiment with TUDE's parameters (tooltypes) in the Start script.Just type
"tude help" att the Shell prompt to get a short description of TUDE's arguments.
Or download tude.lha from Aminet and read Tude.doc for a deeper study.

I  take  up no responsibility if it does not  function on your  computer  or
causes any kind of harm.
