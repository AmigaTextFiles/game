@node INTRO "Introduction"
Wanna cheat? Use Cheata!

Cheata is a program to cheat with some games running in a multitasking
environment. A good example wood be SomniaZity®.

Cheata runs best when cooperating with SegTracker. SegTracker can be
found with newer versions of Enforcer. Enforcer can be found on newer
fishdisks.

Unexperienced usage of Cheata may call big asian brother, so better
read this documentation from the middle to the top.

@endnode

@node EXAMPLE "Example"
Next we will walk through a small example giving you some experience
for handling the average case. Some general statements will be
accompanied by a special case study: SomniaZity®.


Starting SegTracker now might be a good idea. Just open a shell,
start SegTracker from within and close the shell. You might
include SegTracker in you startup-sequence or user-startup (again,
SegTracker is not really needed, it just makes things easier).


Now start the program (normally a game) which you wanna trick out.
Let the game run until you can see the value you wanna (eh, sorry
for the "wanna", learnt my english by listening to the Ramones...)
change and stop/pause the game. Switch back to your workbench and
start Cheata by doubleclicking on its icon.

Special example: Start SomniaZity@ and select the difficulty level
which gives you $10000. This value is the one we wanna change.
Now set game speed to paused, change to Workbench and start Cheata.


Enter the value to be changed in the string gadget labeled Search Value.
Right below you enter the value which should replace the other value.

Special example: Enter 10000 in the... ah, you know, enter 500000 (or
whatever) in the gadget labeled Replacement.


Above you can see two cycle gadgets. In the first one you have to
select the maximum the value you wanna change can have.

Special case: As SomniaZitys® $-value can crawl above 65535 the only
possible selection is Longword.


Same thing with the other cycle labeled alignment. Good programms
always have longwordalignment for longwords and at least wordalignment
for words.

Special case: SomniaZity® likes the longwordalignment.


Now you are ready to hit the Start Search gadget. There will come another
window which you must not give any attention. Searching might take
some time depending on the values you entered and the configuration
of you Amiga.

Special case: nothing special.


The listviewgadget will show you all the addresses of your RAM in which
the value to be searched was found. You now have to find out, which address
is the right one. If there is only one... lucky. Mabye the SegTracker info
which is displayed in the first three columns will help you identifying the
only real one. If you do not get the trick, you have to take another
strategy. Switch back to the first application and let it run for some while
until the value to be changed changes. Now stop it again and switch to
Cheata, press the Update button and wonder what happened. If you have a lot
of entries you should now set the Sort Mode to Highlight. All highlighed
entries have changed their values and will be at the top of the display.

Special case: Look for entries with the name SomniaZity® as Loadname (shows
up in connection with SegTracker only). More than one? Switch to SomniaZity®,
select Slow Game Speed, buy a donut factory for $100 and set Game Speed to
Paused. Now press Update in Cheata and set Sort Mode to Highlight. Look for
a row with Value value 9900.


To change the value at a special address: doubleclick the row.

Special case: doubleclick the row you identified before and watch the
Replacement jumping into.


You may now kill Cheata or let it be there for another round later.
For a usage days, months, years later with the same application you
should remember the Loadname, Hunknum and Offset of the position
where you found the right value. This will always be the same, which
is not the case with the address, which may change every time you load
the application again. Hunknum and Offset might change if you install
another version of your application.

Special case: Go on building LA in SomniaZity®. You can get more
money by entering a new value in the Replacementgadget and doubleclicking
the identified row in the listviewgadget again. For later usage you should
remeber Loadname, Hunknum and Offset of the row, because they will always
be the same and help you identifying the right entry next time. This will
not be the case if you switch from SomniaZity® to SomniaZityII®® or
SomniaZity2001®®®.


---------- Addendum for V1.1

You can now save found values permanently and manipulate them much easier
and faster at a later time. SegTracker is needed to do so.

Identify the value as usual, open the macro window and drag&drop the found
entry into it. If you want to change several values at once in one program,
then identify them one after another and d&d them all in one macro.
Now enter an informative comment and save the macro (ending should
be ".cheat"). You can load it back later and simply press the Execute button
to poke all values at once into memory.

@endnode

@node SIZE "Size"
The Size gadget is for selecting the maximum the value you
wanna change can have. Byte means 0..255, Word means 0..65535,
Longword 0..(2^32-1).

In fact you will have some problems knowing the maximum
if have never seen the value getting above 100 or so. In
this case it is possible that the value might be stored in a longword,
too. If you choose Byte Size you have to choose Byte Alignment
or you will never find such a longword value. Experience, guess or
pray.


Searching for longwords is a little bit slower on computers with
16Bit RAM (500, 500+, 600, 1000, 2000) than searching for bytes or
words.


There is something to know when working with 68000 or 68010 Amigas.
This CPUs cannot read words or longwords from odd addresses. You may
not set the Alignmentgadget to Byte when looking for such sizes.
Cheata knows about these problems and will reject wrong selections.
These combinations are possible on CPUs >= 68020 but should not be
used as they are very unlikely.

@endnode

@node ALIGNMENT "Alignment"
The Alignment gadget is for choosing the RAM positions in which Cheata will
search. Bytealignment lets Cheata search at all positions, wordalignment
means all positions which can be divided by 2 without a remainder,
longwordalignment means all positions which can be divided by 4 without a
rest.

You can expect that longwords have longwordalignment and words have at least
wordalignment, but there might be some exceptions.


When selecting bytealignment Cheata has to search at 4times the positions
than selecting longwordalignment. Time spent for searching will be influenced
noticeable by this gadget.

@endnode

@node SEARCHVALUE "Search Value"
This gadget is for entering the value you are looking for. You may enter only
positive integers and the maximum value depends on the selection you made
in the sizegadget.

The value you wanna look for is important when thinking about the time Cheata
will spent for searching. As small values (like 0, 1 ...) will be very often
in RAM opposed to big hairy numbers (like 9418), searching for these small
numbers will take factors longer. Everytime Cheat finds a number, the memory
address has to be remembered, it has to be placed in the listview and
SegTracker has to be questioned. So it is not recommended to search for the
value 0.

Another problem is, that every time the value will be found, some memory has
to be allocated in the listview to remember its address. No problem for
a dozen entries, big one for a few thousands. If Cheata runs out of
memory during searching, no further values will be remembered and the final
list will be incomplete.

@endnode

@node REPLACEMENT "Replacement"
Here you may enter the value which will replace the value to be searched at
selected addresses. His max depends on your selections in the sizegad.

@endnode

@node SORTMODE  "Sortmode"
This gadget will change the sortmode of the listviewgadget.

Address: Entries will be sorted depending on their value in the
address-column. Small ones first.

Name: Entries will be sorted depending on their alpha value in
the loadname-column. With same names the values in the columns hunknum
and offset are decisive.

Highlight: First ones are the highlighted entries, inside and outside of
this group all goes like with name-sorting.

@endnode

@node UPDATE "Update"
Update will scan the address of each entry in the listview again and
compare the found value to the formerly found value. If the value
has changed, the entry will be highlighted. If sortmode is set to
highlight, sorting will follow the update.

This little action is useful, if you cannot decide right after searching
which entry is the right one to change. See example section for an
example.

@endnode

@node STARTSEARCH "Start Search"
Clicking this gadget will start the actual search. There may pop up
something like an error window if you made some wrong entries in
some of the gadgets (e.g. search value of 10000 with searchsize of byte).

If alls OK, a second window will materialize and inform you about the
progress of the search. You can abort the search with the Cancelgadget
at (nearly) any time. As only used memory will be searched, there may be
some jumps in the progress indicator.

Searching has finished as soon as the second windows transforms itself
back into a piece of unused memory. You may have to wait some more
seconds for the result, because SegTracker will inspect the addresses
after the search and MUI takes sometimes some time to display the
entries if there are a lot of them, too.
@endnode

@node LISTVIEW "Listview"
The listviewgadget is for admiring the result of Cheatas work.

The first three columns of an entry will only show something useful if
SegTracker is active:

@{B}Loadname:@{UB} Loadname gives the name of the loadfile, in which the
value to be searched was found. Sometimes path is included, sometimes
not. (Note: A program may occupy much more memory than occupied by
its loadfile, so this is column is only a hint (or so...))

@{B}Hunknum:@{UB} Programms tend to consist of several hunks.
Hunknum(ber) tells you, in which hunk the value was found.

@{B}Offset:@{UB} This is the offset to the beginnig of a hunk.
(Note: Sometimes there will be some idiot values in this column, but this
is of no importance to Cheata and its purpose. Handle them like normal
values.)


Useful columns without SegTracker:

@{B}Address:@{UB} This column shows the address where the value was found.

@{B}Value:@{UB} This column shows you the value of an address. As Cheata
is running in multitasking, the value might be changed by any other program
at any time without Cheata noticing. Sames valid, when you change a value
with Cheata.


Changing a value can be achieved by doubleclicking its entry. This will
ram the replacement value into the RAM address specified in the entry.
Doubleclicking again will place the old value again into place.

Warning: Unbrained changing of RAM-values can knock out the system
immediately or place a time-bomb for some fun in the evening. So...

@node SEGTRACKER "SegTracker from a monkeys view"
SegTracker tracks programms beeing loaded from disk to memory.
But it only knows about their static memory usage, these progs may
allocate much more memory at a later time.


Why should you use it?

First, if you are searching for a value in program A, with the help
of SegTracker you can include out addresses which belong to another
program B or C (sometimes D).

Secondly, all addresses with a blank loadname are unlikely to be of any
importance to you, as most the values you will be looking for (scores)
are allocated in a static way at loadtime.

Thirdly, if you want to change a value several times, you can easily
recognize it by its loadname, hunknum, and offset after you have
identified it the first time.
