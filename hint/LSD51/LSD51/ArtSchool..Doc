1.1     INTRODUCTION
--------------------

1.1a    New Features
--------------------

Since  the release of version one Art School has had a few reviews.  In the
main,  they  were  particularly  favourable,  however,  a  few 'bad apples'
managed  to  invade  the  barrel.  Many of the 'bugs' that were reported by
reviewers  were  in  fact  due  to concluding without researching i.e.  the
program seizure reported in Amiga Shopper was in fact the menu lock!

As I have spent a not inconsiderable amount of time writing this program, I
though  it  was  time  for  an upgrade, even though it hasn't been out that
long.   While  re-writing  some  of the code I did actually find a few bugs
(they  are listed!), so nobodys perfect.  Anyway, in true doc fashion, here
are the revisions...  :-)

BUGS FIXED since 1.0
--------------------

* Error trapping on saves now fixed.
* File buffer overflow now stops itself causing damage.
* Confused narrator & keyboard now sorted.
* Occasional effect changes failed : now fixed
	
... er, that's em all! I think...

NEW FEATURES
------------

* Help available from menu as well and keyboard.
* Independent file buffer for Slide Shower.
* Independent file buffer for Music Player.
* Independent file buffer for Colouring Book.
* File Path settings can now be altered for the above three functions.
* Child Lock renamed 'Menu Lock' to avoid confusion!
* Rainbow feature can now be reset to default.
* Arrow  Key Action Arrows are now animated to draw the users attention to
  the fact the current effect can be altered.
* Fractal  drawing  feature now included and can draw either Mandelbrot or
  Julia  sets  to  either  a  pre-defined window or full screen.  Zooming 
  and positioning controls are in.
* Curve effect added.
* Music player added with selectable playlist, tape transport style control
  panel.
* Turtle  graphics  language now implemented with full text editor, saving
  and   loading.   Instruction  set  limited  to  20  commands  and  simple
  branching, but if anyone wants it extended let me know.
* Screen shrinking by 50%.
* Magnadraw.
* Comb & ColourComb effects.
* Invert palette effect now 1000% faster!
* Spare work screen now avalable!
* Rub through effect from spare to current screen!

I think that's it for the time being. Enjoy them!
		
        
1.1b    Children and Art
------------------------

This  program  came about originally after I saw a PD painting program on a
magazine  coverdisc.   Although  the  program  was competent in its aims, I
found  it  to  be  a bit boring and so couldn't hold a childs attention for
very long.

I  decided  to  write my own program, and, after seeing the Electronic Arts
contender  some  time  later I thought I had better widen my goals a little
and  include  more features than any other program currently selling out of
the full price range.  I hope I have achieved the original aim of producing
a fun art package that children will find enjoyable.

From  my  own  experience I have seen that children like many features that
are  'grown  up'  in  feel,  such  as texture mapping made easy.  They will
eventually  move  up  to  the  likes  of  Deluxe Paint 7, and hopefully the
transition will be easy and natural.

The  use of rainbows for skylines is one example of a tool that was thought
up  by  children, and I think its one of the best effects in ArtSchool.  As
you  will  hopefully  see,  with  these  tools, brushes and your childs (or
your!)  creativity  ArtSchool  is  the  ideal medium for creating beautiful
pictures with ease.

Often  children  will come up with 'wish lists' if they enjoy something, so
if  your child or yourself has an idea that you feel would work well inside
ArtSchool,  and  if  would  like to see it implemented in future revisions,
then  please  contact  me.   Likewise, any bug reports or dislikes would be
welcomed.  My latest address can be found by reading the 'About' message in
ArtSchool.  Thank you.

1.1e	CarterSoft Productions
------------------------------

A bit of an `Indy` outfit, but we, or I, as it is 97% of the time have been
going  over two years now.  I`ve released various programs:  Batdog, an old
platformer  was  once  sold  to  Amiga  Computing.   Simon  and Skeet was a
recently  put  on PD.  Touch`n`Go was released through F1 recently and will
be  featured on the The One`s coverdisc.  Batdog II would have been out now
if  I  hadn`t  have reviewed this program first and I think it`ll do pretty
well, the source code will be available seperately code fans!!  My fave has
to  be  this  one though, ArtSchool, because I just like it myself.  It was
actually  on  a  disc  for  over  8  months  before John Howard gave me the
inspiration to get it finished along with everything else.  At that point I
had  a habit of starting 27 things at once (I know Steve!).  So if you ever
read  this  John,  I want to say thanks, honestly, for giving me that final
push  to  progress.  I know we`ve had a few differences, but thanks anyway,
its  forgotton.   Best  of  luck with your Army career, cheerz!  In a funny
kind  of weird like fuzzy way, a bit hazy as well as kind of hot - no, cold
way I owe this all to you.  Funny old life innit ?
	
Soon  to  come from ol` Cartersoft is a commercial release that is bound to
be  a  smash hit, but I can`t say more than this is how it all starts, from
humble  beginnings.   Were  also gonna be involved in the Amoszine project,
and so can you, so get in touch with F1 now!
	
I  personally  however  would  be  looking for any talented GFX artists and
musicians  to work on future CD projects, so if you want to apply, write to
me,  Al, with some demos of your work and I`ll be in touch with you.  Don`t
delay  though,  CD  will  soon  be  moving  away  from  the  realm of small
developers, so act now!!  I won`t be turning away from the Licenceware / PD
scene though as I`m a firm believer in the `scene stuff, I owe a lot, as do
many  others  to  the  collective  knowledge  of the thousands of extremely
talented   individuals  and  groups  who  have  contributed  to  the  PD  /
Licenceware  /  Shareware scene.  One name that springs immediately to mind
is  Anders  Bjerin, the author of the extensive PD C manual that trashed my
original printer!

To  end  on  another  advert!,  any publisher looking to contract out Amiga
projects  and  would like to contact me can do so, thanks everyone and long
live the AMIGA.  << Applause >>
	

Chapter 1 - First Steps
-----------------------

1.2     Getting Started 
-----------------------

1.3     SOFTWARE
----------------

ArtSchool  comes  on  two  disks:  the Program disc, which as you can guess
holds  the  actual  computer program, default pictures and samples, and the
Extras  disc,  which  holds  music, brushes, pictures, turtle examples etc.
Sorry  it  had  to spill on two discs but its got to large to even consider
the one disc option.

1.4     HARDWARE
----------------

For  ArtSchool  to  work  properly you will need an Amiga with at least one
megabyte  of  memory,  this  must  however be at least 512k of CHIP memory.
Accellerated  machines  or AGA Amigas such as the A1200 will not affect the
operation of ArtSchool.  An extra disc drive is recommended.

1.5     USING THE DISCS
-----------------------

Before  jumping  in  and  running  ArtSchool  it is a good practice to make
back-up copies of both discs, and then store the originals in a safe place.
Information on copying discs can be found in your Amiga Users Guide.

1.6     RUNNING ARTSCHOOL
-------------------------

To load and run the ArtSchool program first make sure the Amiga is switched
OFF and no discs are in the drives.  Switch on, and insert the Program disc
into  the  internal  drive,  the  program  will  now  load.  If you have an
external drive, you may like to insert your AS_Extras disk.


Chapter 2 - Exploring ArtSchool
-------------------------------

2.1     The Enviroment
----------------------

2.2     THE TOOL STRIP
----------------------

On  the  main  screen  after  loading you will see a strip of large buttons
running down the left hand side of the screen - this is the Tool strip.

Almost  every  option  is  initially  accessed  from these buttons so it is
important  to  understand  what  they do.  We will now have a look at their
functions  starting  at  the  top, with the Draw button.  While reading the
descriptions,  the  word  'pointer' is used to describe the cross-hair that
simulates mouse movements.

2.2.1   DRAW
------------

When  selected the Draw button will draw a freehand line in the current ink
colour  as  long  as  the  left  mouse button is pressed down.  You can not
accidently  press  another  button  or  change the current ink colour while
drawing, you must first release the button.

2.2.2   LINES
-------------

To  draw  a straight line between two points, first position the pointer on
screen at the start of your line, then press and hold the left mouse button
while  re-positioning  the  pointer.   When  you have finished, release the
mouse button and the line is drawn in the current ink colour.

2.2.3   BOXES
-------------

This  function will draw a box between two points in the current ink colour
using the technique as mentioned above.

2.2.4   CIRCLES
---------------

Although described as a circle tool this button can actually draw ellipses.
Again, first press and hold the left mouse button where you want the centre
of  you  circle to appear, then drag the mouse out.  Release when the shape
is how you want it.

2.2.5   EFFECTS
---------------

After  selecting this button the horizontal bar at the bottom of the screen
will  change  to  a  row  of  large  square buttons.  These are the special
effects and will be covered later.

2.2.6   RUBBER
--------------

When  this  tool  is  selected  pressing the mouse button will draw a solid
block  of colour.  You may also notice notice two arrows that appear at the
top right of the screen on the title bar.  These indicate that pressing the
arrow  keys  will  affect  a  change  with  the  current tool, in this case
altering  the  rubbers  size.  To make the change in this instance you must
also be pressing the left mouse button.

As  well  as  being used for eraser large areas of a drawing the rubber can
also be used for drawing filled squares, also for a nice effect, select the
rainbow  colour  and  draw  around with the rubber on its largest setting -
very pretty!

2.2.7   SCISSORS
----------------

The  Scissors  tool  is  used  to  make  a temporary brush from the current
picture.   Use  it  in  the same way as the box tool to outline a rectangle
containing  the  image you want to use and then release.  That image inside
the rectangle is now available as a brush to be stamped and flipped atwill.
You will notice that ArtSchool has automatically switched modes so that you
are now in 'Paste Brushes' mode, this is for your convenience.  Please note
that  the  brush  will remain as the spare until you re-select the scissors
tool  or  choose another brush.  This enables you to cut a brush, clear the
screen  or perform some other action and then re-select the 'Paste Brushes'
tool to use the spare brush again.

2.2.8   PASTE BRUSHES
---------------------

As  was  just  mentioned,  this  tool  alters  the bottom panel to show the
current  selection  of  brushes,  and  if a brush has been cut out with the
Scissors tool, that will be shown at the pointer position.  The arrows that
will  have  appeared  at  the  top of the screen show that cursor keys have
affect on the brushes and will flip them horizontally and vertically.

2.2.9   PAINT
-------------

This  tool  is  used  to  fill  enclosed  areas  with a varied selection of
patterns  and  colours.   After selecting the Paint tool a box with arrowed
buttons  on either side will appear on the bottom left of the screen.  This
shows  what  pattern  and  colours will be used to paint with when the user
clicks the left button on the screen.  To change the pattern, use the arrow
buttons.   To  change  the colours simply click a colour on the palette box
beside it.  NOTE:  clicking with the right button will cause a 'background'
colour  to  be  chosen,  this  enables  you to have a two coloured pattern.
Please  also note that the first two patterns refer to the 'foreground' and
'background'  colours,  so  occasionally  it  may  seem like the tool isn't
working.  Just click back to the beginning and all will be fine.

2.2.10  UNDO
------------

Clicking  on  this tool will cause the last action you did to be 'un-done',
so  allowing  you to quickly forget any hasty mistakes.  It isn't recursive
and so won't undo itself!  PAH!

2.3     THE EFFECTS BAR 
-----------------------

These  are  where  the  backbone  of  ArtSchool  is formed.  If you haven't
already  grasped  the  fundamentals then let just explain.  Any arrows that
appear  on  the  title  line at the top of the screen mean that the current
option  can  be  altered by pressing the arrow keys.  At any time, pressing
the  right  mouse  button when in 'Effects' mode will bring up the palette,
simply choose another colour and release.

2.3.1   CLEAR SCREEN
--------------------

This  invokes  one of seven different methods of clearing the screen.  They
are chosen randomly so as not to be totally boring!

2.3.2   RANDOM CIRCLES
----------------------

Simply  paste  random  sized  filled circles at random positions around the
pointer

2.3.3   RANDOM SQUARES
----------------------

Same as above but with filled squares!

2.3.4   UP AND DOWN
-------------------

This  tool  will cause the actual drawing position to move up and down from
the pointer.

2.3.5   LEFT AND RIGHT
----------------------

This  tool  will  cause  the actual drawing position to move left and right
from the pointer.

2.3.6   ORBITAL DRAWING
-----------------------

While using this tool the drawing position will be constantly rotating in a
circle around the mouse pointer.

2.3.7   TRI SPINNER
-------------------

The  Tri-Spinner is similiar to the old Spirograph drawing sets and is best
used  while  keeping  the mouse stationary until the drawing loop finishes.
Many  hundreds  of  combinations can be found by altering the angles of the
triangle, or changing it size with the arrow keys.

2.3.8   WACKY WORM
------------------

Select  the  Wacky Worm and watch it follow the pointer!  Pressing the left
mouse button will cause any colours under the worm to get eaten and leaving
them  partially  changed.   It  wont destroy any pictures but it can change
them there colours!

2.3.9   SAMPLE KEYBOARD
-----------------------

While  the  Sample  Keyboard effect is selected, pressing the function keys
will play a sample

2.3.10  STARPIC
---------------

This  button loads a pre-drawn 'stars at night' picture.  As with the other
picture  loading buttons, the actual picture is contained within the System
drawer  of  the  boot  disc  and  can be saved over with your own choice of
picture if you want.

A key point to note is that the pictures were designed to induce creativity
and  are deliberately sparse while retaining enough detail to justify using
them.  They work particularly well with the preset brushes.

2.3.11  LANDSCAPE
-----------------

Another  picture loader, this time a nice country scene.  After loading you
could try changing the rainbow to see the different moods it creates.

2.3.12  SEASCAPE
----------------

Another picture loader, gusty seas!  Oh yes!

2.3.13  MOUNTAINS
-----------------

Another picture loader, beautiful and cold.  Try using some snow-flakes and
clouds to build the scene.

2.3.14  HOUSE
-------------

Picture  loader  again.   This time a bare house, waiting to be made into a
pretty picture.

2.3.15  MAP
-----------

Picture  Loader.   This loads in what was intended to be a weather map.  In
conjunction  with weather map symbols it could be a fun way to simulate the
weather maps on television.

2.3.16  COLOURING BOOK
----------------------

The  Colouring  Book  button  is a slightly different picture loader.  When
ArtSchool  is  first loaded it will look for a folder named Col_Book on the
extras  disc,  and  if  it finds it will make a list of all the pictures it
finds.   Then, when you click on the Colouring Book button it will load the
pictures  in  a carousel fashion, looping back to the first when the end of
the list has been reached.

It  is  intended that the pictures be painted with various filling patterns
and colours.

The  directore  path  can  now  be altered by selecting the 'Set Book Path'
option from the Supervisor menu.

2.3.17  RAINBOW MAKER
---------------------

This  button causes the rainbow colour to be randomly generated, creating a
gradient  fill  similair  to that in arcade games.  To use it you must have
used  the  rainbow  colour  (top  right  on  the palette) somewhere in your
picture,  otherwise  you  wont  be  able to see the effect.  The rainbow is
excellent  for  adding  atmosphere to pictures and will be saved along with
your picture.

Please  note  that  the effect can only be used from within Art School, and
loading  the  picture  into any other art package will not show the rainbow
properly (indeed not all!).

2.3.18  TILE MAKER
------------------

The  Tile  Maker  is  quite a powerful tool that is used to fill the screen
with a selected picture block.

After  selecting the effect a box will appear on screen.  This will contain
the piece of picture that will be used to fill the screen.  Simply position
the  box  over the piece you want to use and click the mouse button.  For a
quick  example, make sure you are using the default brushes and then choose
the small brown square next the gate brushes.  Paste it on the screen.  Now
select  the Tile Maker effect and position the sqaure over the brown brush.
After  you  click  the screen will be filled with what looks like mud.  Now
choose the Rubber tool and set it to the largest setting.  Rub away the top
of  the  picture  to  show  a  semi-skyline  and fill that with the rainbow
colour.  Instant hillside!  Wow eh ?  Woopie doo!

2.3.19  SPLAT
-------------

This effect simply squirts a blob onto the screen.

2.3.20  FRACTAL TREE
--------------------

This  effect  will  draw a randomly generated tree on screen at the pointer
position.   Don't  forget that holding the right mouse button will bring up
the  palette  bar  so  you  can  change  colours.   Also, don't forget that
pressing  'U'  on  the  keyboard  will  undo the last action.  Oh and don't
forget...

2.3.21  3D FLOOR
----------------

This effect can be very nice to play with as it draws a 3D chess board like
floor  (or  ceiling) on screen.  While in testing a friend said it would be
useful  if it drew up from the bottom - well, without complicating things I
said why not pick it up as brush and flip it for the bottom screen!  Please
see the example pictures for a good example of this effect.

2.3.22  GHOST PEN
-----------------

While this effect is selected, any drawing on the screen will be mirrowed.

2.3.23  SMOKE PUFFS
-------------------

This  effect  is  similair  to  the  Splat  effect, but varies this time by
pasting  puffs  of  smoke  on  the  screen  -  useful  for trains and house
chimneys.

2.3.24  TALKING KEYBOARD
------------------------

After choosing this effect pressing letters on the keyboard will invoke the
standard Amiga narrator to say what key was pressed.

2.3.25  WRITING TEXT
--------------------

This  very powerful effect is used to print text on the screen in a variety
of styles and fonts.  While entering text on the screen pressing the up and
down arrow keys (at any time) will cause the font to change, while pressing
the  left  and  right  arrows  will cause the style to change between bold,
underline and italics.

The  current  text  will  not be fixed on the screen until you either press
return or move the mouse pointer to a new position.

2.3.26  LIGHT SQUARE
--------------------

While  using  this  effect any colours inside the square will be shifted up
one position in the palette.

2.3.27  AIRBRUSH
----------------

This effect will spray pixels onto the screen as long as the left button is
pressed.

2.3.28  RADIAL LINES
--------------------

Once  this  effect  is selected, pressing and holding the left mouse button
and  then  dragging the mouse around the screen will cause lines to radiate
out from the start point to the pointer.

2.3.29  DOTTED LINES
--------------------

The  effect is exactly the same in operation as the line tool but will draw
a  dotted  line  instead.   Pointless ?  Try drawing a dotted line with any
degree of acuracy!

2.3.30  GROWING SQUARES
-----------------------

While  using  this effect and the left mouse button is depressed, ArtSchool
will draw bigger and bigger squares onto the screen.

2.3.31  GROWING CIRCLES
-----------------------

Please see GROWING SQUARES

2.3.32  INVERT PALETTE
----------------------

This  effect  will  invert  any  colours inside the square you choose.  New
version is a lot faster as it simply XORs the screen!  Dopey me!

2.3.33  GRID
------------

This  effect  simply draws a pixel spaced grid over your picture to give it
that   'dotted   drawn'   look!   Wow!   As  they  say  on  the  toothpaste
advertisement.

2.3.34  ZOOM
------------

Select this effect and the whole screen will be zoomed 100%

2.3.35  3D SCREEN WRAP
----------------------

After  selecting  this  tool  the  current  picture will be replace by a 3D
square.  The square represents the angle the your picture will be pasted on
to,  and  clicking the left mouse button will start this process.  Pressing
the 'Escape' key will halt it should you not want the effect to be finished

2.3.36  SLIDE SHOWER
--------------------

This  effect  will  bring up a selection box containing all the pictures in
the current directory path ( to change the directory path choose 'Set Slide
Path'  from  the  supervisor  menu).  You can click on all the pictures you
want  to  include  in  your  slide  show and press 'Okay' to continue.  The
screen will fade and each picture you selected will be loaded and shown one
by one.  While a picture is being displayed press the mouse key to continue
the show or the 'Escape' key to quit.

2.3.37 Curves
-------------

This  effect  will  draw  a  curve  between two points, similair to Dpaints
effect.

2.3.38 Magnaline
----------------
	
Upon  activating this effect another cursor will wander onto the screen and
`attract  &  repel`  itself  away from the real cursor.  When you press the
mouse  key  a line will be drawn between the two cursors and an interesting
effect is formed.

2.3.39 Fractal
--------------
This  button is added in addition to the other fractal commands and has the
same  effect  as pressing the F key, in other words it simply activates the
fractal drawing functions once, and returns back to a stanby state.

2.3.40 Turtle Power!
--------------------

This  function is one of the best additions to ArtSchool I could have hoped
to  have  thought  up.   Using  my  own hybrid of the Logo language you can
create  many interesting shapes and effects that would simply be impossible
or impossibly difficult to attain with a different paint package.  Although
limited  (purposefully,  this  package  is  aimed at the younger user!) the
commands  available  can  produce excellent results, as well as showing the
basics of writing a computer program.

The  actual interpreter has only 20 commands and is limited to 100 lines of
turtle program code, but it will be extended if anyone has any suggestions.

Upon  clicking  the  button  or pressing T the Turtle editor will scroll on
from the bottom of the screen.  The display consists of main editing window
on the left, and a command index on the right.  Above the editor window are
control  buttons  used  to perform various functions.  I`ll deal with these
quickly.

	GO!: Pressing this will `run` the current program
	SAVE & LOAD: Save & Load a turtle program.
	Note that while saving, the file selector will 
	automatically add a .turtle suffix if one is missing.

	CLEAR: This will clear and reset the editor
	
Note that various key functions are also used:

	F1:  Run current program
	DEL:  Delete current character
	SHIFT+DEL: Delete current line
	CTRL+UP: Scroll text up one screen
	CTRL+DOWN: Scroll text down one screen
	SHIFT+LEFT: Jump to end of line
	SHIFT+RIGHT:  Jump to start of line
	ESC:  Halt execution of program

Pressing  return at the start of line will shift the whole program down one
line,  but  only  works if the current line is occupied.  Also, if the last
line in the editor is full an error is displayed.  Its all very similair to
any other text editor actually and is fairly straight forward.

The  basics  of  programming  the Turtle are fairly self explana- tory, but
I`ll  go  over  each  function  anyway,  just to make sure.  The letters in
brackets  are the shortcuts for the functions, just enter them as you would
the  full  function.  ie:  fo 3 = forward 3 The editor will accept any case
fluctuations and will tidy up the line for you automatically.
	
Function:	(fo) Forward n
-------------------------

This function will move the turtle forward `n` number of steps.

Function:	(ba) Backward n
--------------------------

See above	

Function: 	(ri) Right n
-----------------------

This  function will turn the turtle right `n` number of degrees.  The value
is added to the current direction.

Function:	(le) Left n
----------------------

See above

Function:	(pu) PenUp
---------------------

This  will  cause  the  imaginary pen to be lifted from the page so that no
actual drawing will take place, the turtle will still move.

Function:	(pd) PenDown
-----------------------

This reversed the above action and causes actual drawing to resume.

Function:	(re) Reset
---------------------

Using  this  function  at the start of a program will reset the pen colour,
the screen position and the angle to zero

Function:	(mo) Move n,n
------------------------

This function uses the two values seperated by a comma and is a function to
move the position of the turtle to a new screen co-ordinate x,y

Function:	(co) Colour n
------------------------

This  function will change the current drawing colour the the value entered
as  `n`.   It should be in the range 0-31 and will take its colour from the
standard palette in ArtSchool.

Function:	(fa) Fast
--------------------

By default, the drawing speed of the turtle is set to slow to allow younger
ones  the  opportunity  to  see exactly what is going on when the turtle is
drawing.  Using this function will make the turtle draw at full speed.

Function:	(sl) Slow
--------------------

Instructs the turtle to draw slowly, see above.

Function:	(cl) Cls
-------------------

This function instructs the turtle to clear the screen.

Function:	*  label
------------------------

This  function  allows  the  user to enter a label, or mark, in the program
that can be jumped to at any time.  The asterix must be followed by a space
and  then  a  label  that can consist of either letters or numbers.  Eg:  *
alan or * bob1

Function:	(go) Goto label,n
----------------------------

This  function will jump to a label, n number of times, and then the turtle
will  only  execute  the function between the two points.  It is not like a
for/next  loop or similair, it will only execute a jump once in the running
of the program, so once its done it done.  What I`m saying is that you cant
nest  them.  Yeah.  You may have guessed that I`m no teacher and so this is
sounding  a  little sketchy, the best thing I can say is to look at some of
the example turtle programs, trust me, it`s all very straightforward.
	  
Function:	(st) Star n
----------------------

This function will draw a 5 pointed star the size of `n`

Function:	(sq) Square n
------------------------

This will draw a square the size of `n`

Function:	(ci) Circle n
------------------------

Hey, does this draw a circle the size of `n` ?!

Function:	(en) End
-------------------

You  can  include  this  anywhere in a program, it simply stops the program
from going any further and can be quite useful.

	
ERROR MESSAGES
--------------

While entering the functions the following error messages may be flashed on
the screen:

No Room!:  
---------

The editor is full


Must be a number!:  
-----------------

The  function  requires  a  number  as  one  of  its  parameters,  you have
inadvertently entered some text instead.

Command Error:
--------------

The function you have entered is not recognised, check it on the list.

Parameter Error:
----------------

The function you have entered has either too many or too little parameters,
see  the  list  above.   Note  that  the  Turtle  editor  treats any values
seperated by commas as seperate parameters.


2.3.41 Music Player
-------------------

This  function allows you to select a music module from a list and play the
music while drawing.  The control are the same as a standard tape deck.

2.3.42 Rub Through
------------------
	
This effect allows you to `rub through` to a picture on the spare screen.

2.3.43 Comb	        
-----------

This  is similair to the standard freehand draw but has a few extras thrown
in.  Firstly, the height if line can be altered by pressing the up and down
arrows  while  drawing:   this  has  the effect of drawing in varying pitch
italics.   Also,  pressing  the left and right arrows will vary the spacing
between each point on the `comb`.

2.3.44 Colour Comb
------------------

Similair  to  the  above  except  this  time  each  point is drawn using an
adjacent colour.  The starting colour is taken from the current ink colour.

2.3.45 Screen Shrink
--------------------
	
This  command  is  the  opposite of Zoom and was overlooked on the previous
release.  It will shrink the screen half size.


2.4     ALTERING THE EFFECTS
----------------------------


2.4.1   CHANGING THE COLOURS
----------------------------

While  in Effect mode the current ink colour can be altered by pressing and
holding  the  right  mouse button.  This causes the palette bar to be shown
and  to  select  a  new  colour  simply  click on the palette with the left
button.  Simply release all buttons to return to the effect you were using.

2.4.2   THE ARROW KEYS
----------------------

Occasionally  an  effect  may well have several options assigned to it that
may  for  example,  alter  size  and  shape.  To show that an effect can be
changed,  up to four little arrows can appear at the top right of the title
bar  (very  top  right  of the display).  If any arrows appear the relative
arrow  keys  on  the  keyboard  will  have  some  effect.   Please  see the
descriptions of the effects for any effect specific information.


2.5     THE BRUSHES
-------------------


2.5.1   USING
-------------

The  brushes  supplied  with ArtSchool are designed to aid and complement a
childs  drawing  style  and  are  simple  to use.  Simply select the 'Paste
Brushes'  tool  from the tool strip at the left of the screen (smiling face
button),  and  the  bar  at  the  bottom of the screen will turn into large
buttons with various images.  These images are the brushes you can use.  To
see  more,  click on the arrow buttons at either side of the large buttons,
if these become ghosted (dark) then that means you have reached the end (or
start) of the brush file.

To  select  a  brush, click on the brushes button and then move the pointer
into  the screen, it should be accompanied by you brush image!  To paste it
into your picture, click the left mouse button.

2.5.2   MAKING NEW BRUSHES
--------------------------

If  you  need to make a temporary brush of your own, the last image in each
file  is  spare,  however, if you want to make a complete brush set of your
own, you can.

The easiest way is to click on the brush you want to replace with the right
mouse  button,  this will put a square on the screen.  The square should be
positioned around the part of picture you want to make a new brush with and
clicked  with  the  left  mouse  button.   If all is well, the brush button
should  now  be showing your new brush.  NOTE:  If at any stage you want to
cancel making a new brush, simply select a new brush or choose a new tool.

2.5.3   LOADING
---------------

Loading  a  new  Brush  set  is  easy,  just select 'Load Brushes' from the
Project menu.

2.5.4   SAVING
--------------

Saving  a  custom  Brush  set is just as easy, simply select 'Save Brushes'
from the Project menu.

2.5.5   FLIPPING
----------------

While  a  brush  is under the pointer the arrow keys can be used to flip it
along the relative axis.


2.6     PULL DOWN MENUS
-----------------------

These  menu  are  desinged  mainly  for  parental use and should ideally be
disabled with the menu lock facility before letting a child use ArtSchool.


2.6     THE PROJECT MENU 
------------------------

In here are the main file operations:

2.6.1   LOAD PICTURE : Loads an IFF or *PIC picture
2.6.2   SAVE PICTURE : Saves both IFF and PIC pictures
2.6.3   LOAD BRUSHES : Loads a brush set
2.6.4   SAVE BRUSHES : Saves a brush set
2.6.5   ABOUT        : Displays ArtSchool info, memory free
2.6.6   QUIT         : End the current ArtSchool session

*  PIC  pictures  are  IFF's with file extensions.  We chose this method to
retain compatability with other art packages.

2.6.7   THE SUPERVISOR MENU
---------------------------

Quick access to switch features:

2.6.8   ENABLE / DISABLE MENU LOCK
-----------------------------------

Locks  out  the menus use CTRL+ALT M, to restore them, a bell will sound if

------------------------

Choosing this option brings up the fractal type requester and allows you to
set the following parameters:

MANDELBROT / JULIA
------------------

Click  on one of these buttons to alter the fractal set that ArtSchool will
use to draw with.

ZOOM
----

Enter  a  value here in the range 1-999 to alter the amount of zoom, with 1
being the maximum zoom.

ITER
----

Enter  a  value  here in the range 1-999 to alter the amount of iteration (
resolution  )  used  while calculating the fractal set, the higher the more
detail.

X and Y
-------

Enter  a value in either of these in the range -32676 to 32767 to alter the
relative X and Y positions to be used while drawing the fractal set.

GO!
---

This  button while draw the fractal using currently set parameters and then
return control back to the fractal set requester.

CENTRE
------

This  button will reset all fractal co-ordinates to the centre depending on
which  fractal  set is currently selected, ie the Mandelbrot sets centre is
different to that of the Julia.
