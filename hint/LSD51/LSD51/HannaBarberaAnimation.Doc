INTRODUCTION
------------

Get ready to have lots of fun and let your imagination run wild as you
learn how to animate, using your favorite Hanna- Barbera cartoon friends.
Before you begin, we thought you might want to know a little about the men
who created these characters and how they developed some of the techniques
you will be using.

William Hanna and Joseph Barbera have been a creative team for more than 50
years, and as pioneers in television animation have won eight Emmys and
seven Academy Awards. They first met at MGM in 1938, and later set up
their own studio in 1957, which continues its ongoing success as
Hanna-Barbera Productions in Hollywood, California.

William Hanna was born and raised in Melrose, New Mexico. Miles away,
Joseph Barbera was growing up in Brooklyn, New York. During the Depression
of the 1930s Bill found an opening at Harman-Ising, the Hollywood studio
that made the original "Looney Tunes" and "Merrie Melodies". By 1937, he
was hired by MGM as a director and story editor. Several weeks later, Joe
Barbera came aboard. Bill had a talent for comic timing and Joe was a
great artist and storyteller. Their very first project at MGM came up with
a winner. "Puss Gets the Boot" starred a cat and mouse who later became
everyone's favorite team, Tom and Jerry.

At that time, most animation was seen in theaters, either before the movie
or as a full-length feature of its own. When television was invented, MGM
was concerned that movies would no longer be popular, so they closed their
animation department. This left Bill and Joe without a job. But they
didn't give up. Instead they turned their misfortune around by creating a
way to make animation for television, which had never been done before.

Their biggest problem was money. The budget to create a half hour of
theatrical animation was $50,000, but they only had a fraction of that
amount for television. They put their heads together and came up with a
whole new technique called "planned animation" which enabled them to make
greater use of each drawing. Because of this innovation, cartoons were
brought from the movie screen to the TV screen in your home. The first 6
minute episode of the Ruff and Reddy series was produced for only $2,800
and proved that Bill Hanna and Joe Barbera could provide big laughs on a
little budget.

Then came television's first cartoon series. The Huckleberry Hound Show,
which paved the way for all our favorite stars like Quick Draw McGraw and
his sidekick Baba Looney, the mischievous Pixie and Dixie, and Jellystones
famous Yogi Bear and Boo Boo. In 1960, a Stone Age family became TV's
first prime time animated stars. The Flintstones, ran for six years and
have become one of the top-rated syndicated programs of all time. As their
space- age counterparts, The Jetsons joined prime time in 1962 followed by
Top Cat, Scooby-Doo and The Adventures of Jonny Quest. In the 34-year
history of Hanna-Barbera, over 3,500 half-hours of animated programming
have been created with more than 350 different series, specials, and
television and theatrical films. These shows have been seen in more than
90 countries and translated into 22 different languages, making the antics
of Hanna-Barbera characters universally recognized and loved by children
and adults everywhere.

Hanna-Barbera Productions is committed to expanding its library by
developing new series and unique program opportunities for young talent.
We hope that this Animation Workshop will inspire you to learn how to
create and animate your own cartoon characters. Who knows - maybe one day
you may find your name in the credits of a Hanna-Barbera cartoon. We hope
so and good luck!!

LOADING & INSTALLATION
----------------------

We strongly advise that you make a backup copy of your Animation Workshop
disk(s) before using the product or installation onto your hard disk drive.
Although replacements are available from us, having your own backup will
save you time should anything go wrong. Your computer's User Guide will
tell you how to copy a disk.

We strongly recommend that prior to loading the program, you read the
README file on the Program Disk. This will contain details of any
additions or alterations made after this manual was printed. To load the
README file simply type:

       README

IBM PC and Compatibles

To run The Hanna-Barbera Animation Workshop on IBM PC and compatible
machines, you will need the following system requirements:

. IBM PC XT/AT with at least 1 Meg RAM
. MSDOS or DRDOS 2.0 and above
. VGA graphics card
. Mouse and keyboard required

(Note that the more memory you have, the larger the animation that can be
created. The program uses EMS memory.)

After making sure your computer has been booted with DOS, insert the
Animation Workshop disk in the floppy drive and type A: to change to the
floppy directory. Your computer should display the prompt, A:>

Now type INSTALL to install the program to hard drive. If you do not
specify a path then the program will automatically install it to a
directory called ANIMWORK. If you want to install it to a different
directory then type the path name on the command line after INSTALL. For
instance if you want to install to a directory on the C: drive called
PLAY/ANIMATE then type;

     INSTALL C : /PLAY/ANIMATE

You may now enter Animation Workshop by typing AW at the appropriate
prompt.

Note: If you have a Rombo video digitizer other than the VIDI-PC24 then
see below.

Digitizer Specifications

The program will work with 3 different ROMBO PC digitizers :

    VIDDI-PC24
    VIDI-PC12
    VIDI-PC

The default is to work with the VIDI-PC24. If you have one of the other
digitizers then you will need to run a different version of the program.

If you have a VIDI-PC12 type AW12 to run the program.

If you have a VIDI-PC type AWPC to run the program.

Commodore Amiga

To run Animation Workshop on an Amiga, you will need the following system
requirements:

. Amiga A500, A500+,A600, A600HD, A1000, A1500, A1200, A3000, or A4000
. Workbench 1.2 and above
. 1Mb RAM
. Mouse and keyboard required.

You can start the program by inserting Disk 1 in your machine and resetting
the machine (either by turning on the power, or by holding down CTRL and
the two Amiga (A) keys). Alternatively, you can start from Workbench by
double clicking on the Animation Workshop icon.

To install the program on your hard drive, boot the machine with a
workbench disk and then insert Disk 1. Double-click on the install icon
and the program will be copied to a directory called HB on your Hard drive.

COPY PROTECTION

When the program first loads you will be asked a protection question to
identify the 3rd icon in a sequence of 3.

The question mark in position C is the icon that you must identify.

Refer to the grids printed on the inside front and inside back covers of
this manual and find the sequence that begins with the first 2 icons (A) &
(B). The third icon in the sequence will be shown on this grid and you
must then click on that icon in the right half of the screen to enter the
program.

Note: If you click on the wrong icon the screen will flash red. You can
enter the program but all disk accessing will be disabled. This means that
you will not be able to load or save any animations, clip-art or
backgrounds. Make sure that you click on the correct icon!

HOW TO USE THIS MANUAL
----------------------

Now you have 3 choices:

1) If you really don't have time for manuals then just put it down and play
with the package. If you have used similar packages before them you will
probably get the hang of it quickly. When needed, refer to specific
features using the index on page 89.

2) Use the Getting Started Quick section on page 25 to see how a simple
animation is produced. This will lead you through most of the program
features in an easy to understand way. This is the recommended route for
you to take!

3) Methodically work your way through all of the features as written in
Features Explained, page 61. This is for the dedicated user who wants to
learn everything about the way the package works before using it. Just
remember, if you begin to feel at all bored by learning so much, then dive
into the package and start animating. Practice is better than theory in
just about everything!

THE MAIN MENU
-------------

When you start up the Hanna-Barbera Animation Workshop, you are presented
with the Main Menu screen. This screen, shown below, links all the
different aspects of Animation Workshop together.

GETTING STARTED QUICK
---------------------

You got here! This is the best way to quickly learn the power of The
Hanna-Barbera Animation Workshop.

Here we go.......

This section is a series of icons for you to click on followed by a
description of where you are and what you see on the screen.

Just click on each icon in turn using the left mouse button (unless the
right mouse button is specified).

VIEW SAMPLE ANIMATED CLIPS

First let's look at some Hanna-Barbera animations:

   (Click on the Drawer Icon)

You now have a list of the animation directories. There are animations
from The Flintstones, The Jetsons, Scooby- Doo and Yogi Bear.

   (Click on SCOOBY)

The list of Scooby animations is shown.

   (Click on SNACK)

Now you have selected the animation called SNACK and this name has appeared
in the box below the list.

   (Click on Arrow pointing from filing cabinet to computer)

Hey, time for a snack. This animation is for you to colour in later. See
how the control panel is similar to a VCR.

   (Click on the Looped Arrow)

Looping the animation again and again,

   (Click on the Tortise & Hare Icon)

Now we can change the speed.

   (Click on the Hare)

Faster....

   (Click on the Tortoise)

...and slower.

Try pressing F1 to remove the control panel. Press it again to bring it
back.

   (Click on Exit)

And now we're back at the main menu.

Let's have a look at another one!

   (Click on the Drawer Icon)

   (Click on BACK)

   (Click on YOGI)

   (Click on GRAB)

   (Click on Right Arrow icon)

   (Click on right arrow icon)

Yabba-Dabba-Doo tm! Its the Flintstones' house. Lets get Barney to visit.

   (Click on icon with left mouse button)

This takes us to a blank cel or frame.

   (Click on pencil drawing icon)
 
This is the animate mode (just 2 colors).

   (Click on icon with right mouse button)

This now allows us to see the background underneath our cel. (Note that on
the PC the background is shown in a blue outline).

Now let's get Barney.

  (Click on sissors icon)

This is the clip-art screen for loading in sample art to include in your
animations.

  (Click on the drawer icon)

To bring up the clip-art list.

  (Click the BARNEYWK + right arrow)

Here's an 8 frame walk cycle for Barney. Now comes the fun.

  (Click on the sissors icon)

The scissors icon should have turned purple. Next you need to cut out the
first Barney frame which is the one at the top left of the screen. You do
this by moving the pointer up to the top left corner of Barney and click
AND HOLD DOWN the left mouse button. Keeping it held down, move the
pointer to the bottom right of the character and release the button. You
should now have Barney moving around with the mouse pointer. If you have
not quite done it properly then click on the scissors icon twice and try
again.

  (Click on Exit)

To return to the animation mode. Now you can position Barney on the path
at the left edge of the screen. Move him there and then click the mouse
button once to put him down.

  (Click on the down arrow icon)

To add a new frame. Notice that you can still see frame 1 in a lighter
shade underneath.

  (Click on the sissors icon)

To go back to the clip-art screen.

  (Click on the sissors icon twice)

Cut out the next frame in the walk as before.

  (Click on Exit)

Now position the new Barney a little closer to the house.

Repeat steps 10 - 13 six times but each time cut out the next frame in the
walk cycle and position Barney on the screen closer to the house but
overlapping the frame that you can see underneath. Keep doing this until
you have placed the last Barney in frame 8. Now let's color him in.

  (Click on the paint brush icon)

This is Foreground Paint mode. Click on one of the colours in the bottom
right of the screen. Choose one for his hair.

  (Click on fill icon)

You can now fill Barney with color. Move the mouse pointer to inside his
hair and click.

  (Click on right arrow)

To go to the next frame. Click in his hair again. Repeat six times until
all of the hair is colored and then do the same choosing different colors
for the rest of him.

When you have completely colored in all the Barneys, you are ready to view
your animation.

  (Click on Exit)

To return to the main menu.

  (Click on the looped arrow icon) 

To play the animation over and over again. Well done! You have created a
sample animation. If it is going at the wrong speed then use the
Tortoise/Hare icon to change it. Now we can save it to disk.

  (Click on Exit)

Main menu again.

  (Click on the drawer icon)

If the list does not say FLINT, JETSONS, SCOOBY, YOGI then click on <-BACK.
Click on the empty box underneath the list and type in a name for your file
of up to 6 letters. Let's call it BARNEY.

  (Click on arrow pointing from computer to filing cabinet)

Your file is now saved to disk. It can be loaded back in at any time by:

  (Click on drawer icon)

  (Click on BARNEY + right arrow)

  (Click on the tick)

And there you have it! You`re getting pretty good at this.

CREATE AN ANIMATED CHARACTER

Now let's try drawing an animation from scratch. Make sure you're on the
main menu.

  (Click on the Dustbin icon)

  (Click on the tick)

Just to make sure the animation is cleared.

  (Click on the paint brush icon)

First let's experiment with different drawing techniques. This is going to
look like a mess!

DRAWING

  (Click on the Pencil icon (with wavy lines))

Move the pointer onto the screen and click and hold down the mouse button
and move the pointer around. This is freehand mode.

  (Click on the size icon)

This changes the thickness of the lines. Do some more drawing.

  (Click on the size icon again)
 
Back to single thickness lines.

  (Click on the Pencil icon (with a straight line))

This mode draws straight lines. Just play around moving the mouse pointer,
clicking and holding down and then dragging it to the end point.

  (Click on the box icon)

Do the same with squares and rectangles.

  (Click on the circle icon)
 
And circles and ovals.

  (Click on the OOOOPs icon)

This is the OOOPS icon. See how the last thing that you did disappears.
Click on it again to bring it back. This is very useful if you make a
mistake.

  (Click on the eraser icon)

Now you have completely cleared the screen. Let's draw something
recognizable. A simple landscape. First select color number 2, which
should be black, by clicking on it.

  (Click on the Pencil Line icon)

Draw a line across the screen.

  (Click on the Pencil freehand icon)

Draw some wavy hills above the line.

  (Click on the circle icon)

Draw a sun in the sky. 

  (Click on the fill icon)

Click on the colours that you want and fill the different areas. Note that
the colour will leak out through any holes even at the edge of the screen.

  (Click on icon)

Great. Let's draw an animation to go over the top of the backdrop.

  (Click on the Yogi pic icon)

We are now in Foreground Animate mode. See how we can only use 2 colors in
this mode. Let's draw a simple face. In this section select the tools
that you need for yourself. Most of the time you will need the freehand or
circle/oval tool. When selecting the circle/oval tool, make sure that you
click in the top left hand corner so that they are drawn just in outline.

Draw an oval for a head. Place a half circle in the centre for the nose.

Draw 2 ovals for the eyes and a half circle for the mouth.

Draw 2 ovals inside the eyes for pupils. Add 2 half circles above the eyes
for eyebrows.

Finsh the head by adding half circles for the ears. Then add the final
touch of four strands of hair.

ANIMATING

Frame 1
Brilliant! This is the 1st frame of our animation.

  (Click on the down arrow (Add Frame Icon)

This adds a frame and moves us forward to it. See how frame 1 still shows
through underneath. Every time you need to add a new frame, click on this
icon again.

Frame 2
Draw a new head where the ovals are beginning to stretch with a straight
line for the mouth and the hair standing up straighter.

Frame 3
Next frame. You should have clicked on the ADD FRAME ICON again. Complete
stretching the ovals, draw a half moon shape for the mouth, and stand the
hair straight up. You now have a surprised expression.

Frame 4
Frame 4. Return the face to its original shape. Add 2 straight lines so
that the eyes are half closed, and draw a sausage shape for a half open
mouth.

Frame 5
Last frame. Squash the ovals and close the eyes as shown above. By
stretching the line of the mouth you now have a smiling face.

  (Click on the paint brush icon)

  (Click on the fill icon)

Now color in the frame.

  (Click on the right arrow icon)

Back to frame 1. Keep going until all of the frames are
colored.

  (Click on Exit)

Back to the main menu. 

  (Click on the looped arrow icon)

Wow! An animation that you did all by yourself. Not bad! But the
animation still doesn't quite loop properly because the jump from frame 5
to frame 1 is too large.

  (Click on the Exit icon)

Back to the main menu. Now see the list saying 1,2,3,4,5 in the top left
of the screen. This is the exposure list showing which frame goes where.
What we want to do is add frame 4 after frame 5 so that the animation goes
smoothly back to frame 1. Click on the line just underneath 5 and press 4
on your keyboard.

  (Click on looped arrow icon)

Now that's better. A funny animation, Save it to disk using the same
technique that you used at the end of the last section, pages 38-39.

Brilliant! You have now passed your basic training.

ANIMATION BASICS
----------------

Animation is a simple process. Usually it either copies or exaggerates how
something actually moves in real life. Once you know the basic steps, you
can create the magic that makes still drawings come to life. Remember that
there will always be more to learn, but here's a good place to start.

DRAWING

First, an animator must be able to take any character or object and make
drawings of it doing anything. Use your spare time to practice drawing any
character you like doing many different things. This will be the best
training for your first animation projects.

Changing Shapes
When we giggle at a funny cartoon, it's probably because some movement is
so silly and exaggerated, we can't help but laugh. Here are a few tricks
that are always used to make this happen.

Example 1: When Fred's thumb gets stuck in his bowling ball as he throws
it, his arm stretches way out. All objects change shape when they are
making a strong action. Rigid objects will change very little, but
flexible ones will change a lot. Exaggerating these changes can be very
useful in creating a funny scene.

Example 2: When Dino falls from high above and hits the ground, his body
flattens, then stretches out and bounces up like a rubber ball.

These examples are called "stretch" and "squash". Nothing in real life
gets stretched or squashed as much as cartoon characters, but this
exaggerated drawing technique is constantly used in animation to create
fantasy and humour Next time you watch The Flintstones, notice how many
times you see Fred or Barney get stretched and squashed.

TIMING

"Timing" in animation is the speed that an action takes place. There are 3
very easy rules.

1. If you want the action to move slowly, then use more frames and make
the drawings overlap a lot.

2. If you want the action to move at a medium speed, then use less frames
and have the drawings slightly overlap.

3. If you want the action to move fast, then use very few frames and do
not let the drawings overlap.

The best way to understand how this works is to look at the sample
animation printed in the bottom left hand corner, from page 31 in this
manual. Using the 3 rules above, practice making your own flip books using
the corners of an old book, magazine or even a telephone book.

STORYTELLING

Stretch and Squash and Timing are important techniques to know, but there
is one more element that makes the real difference, and that is
"storytelling". This is how you get to add your own style and sense of
humor. A good storyteller knows how to create situations that bring
reactions like laughing, crying, and surprise. Once you get an idea of
what you want to animate, think about how you can add something that's
totally unexpected. Remember that animation is the perfect medium to let
your imagination run wild.

ANIMATION

Now you know the tricks of drawing. Let's learn how to animate. The
dictionary says that the word animate means "to give life or motion to".
We'll go step by step and find out how to give life to your drawings.

Step 1 - What's happening?
The first step is to know what you want to happen. Lets say you want a cat
to chase dog up a tree. Sounds funny, so how do you make it happen?

Step 2 - Block out the action
Determine what takes place first, and then last, and something inbetween.
The sketches of these poses are called "key" drawings. You might think of
them like the panels in a comic book. They are single moments of activity.
In your chase scene, the first sketch (Frame 1) might have the cat running
after the dog. The last drawing (Frame 10) could have the cat looking up
at the dog trying to hold on to a tree limb. (Frame 6) might be the dog
scrambling up the tree.

   1----------------6----------------10

Step 3 - Breaking down the drawings.
An animator creates "breakdown" drawings to show the secondary movements
that would happen between each "key" drawing. In your case, (Frame 4) the
dog jumps onto the tree trunk. (Frame 8) would have the dog jumping to
catch the tree limb.

   1-------------4----6-----8--------10

Step 4 - Inbetweening.
An animator creates all the drawings that fit in between the finished
drawings to smoothen out the action.

Step 5 - Exposure Sheet.
In 35mm film, there are usually 24 drawings (or frames) that pass by every
second. Next time you watch a cartoon, try to guess how many frames go by
in a half hour. It's a lot, so an animator uses an "Exposure Sheet" to
keep track of the drawings, frame by frame. To save time and money, some
frames are exposed twice (called "shot in twos"). Then only 12 drawings
are needed per second. Some frames are only used once, but others can be
cycled over and over, like the movement of running. It may take 4 frames
for the dog's legs to move back and forth once, so those frames can be
repeated over and over to make it look like the dog is running.

Step 6 - Shoot the Frames
Once all the frames are drawn, they are put in order according to the
exposure sheet and individually photographed onto film. Sound effects,
voices and music are added. And that's it! You now have a cartoon.

FEATURES EXPLAINED
------------------

MAIN CONTROL

Paint - (Paint Brush Icon)
Clicking on the paintbrush icon takes you into Background Paint mode.

Animate - (Yogi Icon)
This icon takes you into Foreground Animate mode, for drawing the outlines
of your animations.

Video - (Clapperboard Icon)
This icon will take you to the video digitizing module for using with a
Rombo digitizer and video camera, See page 74.

Load/Save - (Drawer Icon)
You can load and save your animations to disk. See LOAD & SAVE section on
page 71 for information on how to do this.

Trash - (Dustbin Icon)
This icon will remove the current animation from memory. Be careful doing
this, as you cannot retrieve the animation if you have not saved it to
disk.

Exit - (Exit Icon)
This icon takes you out of the program. This icon is used on other screens
to exit back to the previous screen, On the main menu there is no previous
screen and so the program simply terminates.

DRAWING

The three basic modes for drawing in are Background Paint, Foreground Paint
and Foreground Animate.

BASIC DRAWING MODES

Background Paint
This mode allows you to draw a background in 8 colours. This will provide
a static backdrop to your animation. Clicking on the BACKGROUND ICON will
change the mode to Foreground Paint.

Foreground Paint
In this mode you can draw and design your foreground animation frames or
cels in 8 separate colors that will be overlaid on your backdrop. From
this mode you can get to either Background Paint or Animate mode. Click on
the BACKGROUND ICON to get to Background Paint Mode, and the ANIMATE ICON
to get to Foreground Animate mode.

Foreground Animate
In Foreground Animate mode (you can only animate the foreground).

This mode is for drawing the outlines of the animations. Here you draw in
just 2 colors (normally black and white) as if you were using a pencil on
paper. The strength of this mode is that you can see the previous 2 frames
of your animation underneath in shades of grey. This is known as onion
skinning and allows you to carefully modify frames to really bring your
animations to life. If you click on the COMBINATION ICON the background
will also be visible underneath your current frame.

If the shades of grey are too confusing then press F7 to show the different
onion skins in red, blue and black. Press F7 again to return to greys.
Click on the FOREGROUND ICON to get back to Foreground Paint mode.

See also the section on frames for information specific to the foreground
modes only.

GENERAL DRAWING ICONS

The General Drawing icons are common to all 3 modes.

NOTE: With the Brushes and Drawing tools you can create your own drawings
or alter pictures that have been loaded from disk or shot via the video
camera.

Brushes
The four squares show the varying thickness of lines that can be used for
drawing. Just click on one and it will be highlighted to show it has been
selected.

Freehand Tool
Next to the brushes at the top is the FREEHAND TOOL which lets you draw as
you would with a pencil. When you select it by clicking on it, the picture
turns blue. You can now draw with the mouse. If you use the right mouse
button then you can draw with the background color.

Straight Line Tool
This lets you draw straight lines. Click on it and then put the mouse
pointer where you want the line to start and HOLD THE BUTTON DOWN while
moving it to where you want to end. Release the button.

Square/Rectangle Tool
Click on here to draw a square or a rectangle. Click in the top left half
to draw a hollow shape and in the bottom right half to draw a filled shape.
Move the mouse pointer to where you want to position one corner of your
shape and then HOLD THE BUTTON DOWN while moving to the opposite corner.
Release the button to draw the shape.

Circle/Oval Tool
This works in the same way as the Square/Rectangle Tool but allows you to
draw circles and ovals. Start at the center and move the mouse until you
have the shape that you want and then release the button.

Fill Tool
This allows you to fill an area with a single color. Click on this icon
and then click on the color that you want to use to fill with. Position
the mouse over the area that you want to fill and click the button.

NOTE: It is very important that the area that you fill is properly joined
so that none of the colours leak out. If they do then click on UNDO (See
Later) and patch up the hole before trying to fill again.

Text Tool
This lets you type text onto your picture. Click here and then position
the mouse where you want the text to start, click the button, and start
typing. You can choose any colour you want.

NOTE: If you make a mistake you can use the BACKSPACE key (<-) on the top
right of the keyboard. You can only delete on the line you are typing.

Magnify Tool
This will magnify a section of the screen so that you can work in detail.
Once you are in Magnify Mode you can zoom in and out with the icons.

NOTE: In Magnify Mode you can only work with the FREEHAND TOOL.

Cut and Paste TooI
This has a very special application. You can select a picture, or part of
it, to be cut out and pasted on another part of the screen, or on another
frame in the animation sequence. This can save a lot of time when you need
to repeat the same drawing in a different place. You can also create your
own brush and draw with it. For example you might want to draw a leaf and
then cut it out and paste it lots of times onto a tree.

The way that you cut something out is by clicking on the scissors which
makes them go purple indicating that you are ready to cut. Click the mouse
pointer at one corner of the thing that you want to cut out and then drag
it to the opposite corner and release the button.

NOTE: Any part of your brush that is background colour (the colour at the
top left of the palette) will be treated as transparent when you use your
brush.

You can also flip your brush horizontally or vertically by pressing F5 or
F6.

MAKING CORRECTIONS

UNDO Tool
This is a picture of Shaggy going Ooops! It only works on your last
mistake, so click here as soon as you have made an error. If you decide
that it wasn't a error after all then just click again and it will undo
what you just undid!

WIPE Tool
When you want to completely clear the screen then click on the Wipe tool.
This will fill the screen with the selected background color. If you
accidentally wipe the screen, and haven't done anything else then just
click on UNDO to bring the screen back.

You can also correct mistakes by selecting the backgound color with the
right mouse button and then rubbing out whatever is wrong with the right
mouse button again.

CREATING COLOURS

There are 8 colors which are used for the background and 8 for the
foreground. These can be selected by clicking on them (left mouse button
for foreground color, right mouse button for background color) or modified
by clicking on the palette icon.

Select the color that you wish to modify by clicking on it, and then modify
the red, green and blue content by moving the slider bars on the right.
You can either click on these bars and hold down the button to drag them
left and right, or just click to one side of them to move them up and down
in steps.

ANIMATION

The three icons that relate to the frames can be used from both the
Foreground Animate and Foreground Paint modes and look like:

 Left Arrow   Down Arrow   Right Arrow

The icons to the left and the right simply move forwards and backwards one
frame in the current animation. To start with, these will do nothing since
the program starts with only 1 frame in the animation. The central icon is
the ADD FRAME ICON and adds a new frame just after the current frame being
displayed. The frame number used is the lowest number that has not yet
been assigned.

CLIP ART AND BACKGROUNDS

Backgrounds
Background graphics can be loaded in by clicking with the RIGHT mouse
button on the background icon while in Background paint mode. This will
call up a separate screen with a disk icon. Click on this icon and a list
will appear of the available files to load in.

Clip-Art
Clip-Arts are line-drawings that you can include in your own animations.
To call up the clip-art screen, click with the RIGHT mouse button on the
SCISSORS ICON.

This will call up another another scissors icon (for cutting brushes out of
the clip-art screen), a disk icon and an exit icon to get you back to the
normal mode. Click on the disk icon to bring up a list of all the
available clip-art on the disk. See the Sample Animation Art Section for a
list of the available screens.

LOAD AND SAVE

You can load and save your animation to disk. Click on the FILING ICON on
the Main Control panel and a box will appear.

First you need to select the name of the file. You can do this by clicking
on it (if it already exists) or by clicking in the space below the list of
files and typing a name.

The list of files also contains directories which hold other files.
Directories are indicated by a > sign in front of the name. If you need to
change directory then just click on the directory name and then select a
file. You can go back to the previous directory by clicking on <--- BACK.

When you have selected the file name then you must select one of the arrow
icons. The arrows indicate whether you load or save the animation. To
LOAD an animation, click on the arrow that points from the disk to the
computer. To SAVE an animation click on the arrow that points from the
computer to the disk.

Click on the arrow that you want, and then select the file. If you are
loading a file then you will just click on the name of the file that you
want.

Be carefull! You do not want to load an animation over something that you
have just drawn, or save an animation over another one on the disk that you
want to keep. If you are going to overwrite an animation (either in the
computer or on the disk) then a box will appear:

   (Tick Icon)

If you are sure that you want to carry on then click on the TICK.
Otherwise click on the CROSS and nothing will be overwritten.

If you wish to change to a different disk drive then click on the disk
icon. This will take you to the next available disk (like the floppy
drive) and show you what is available on that disk. This can be useful if
you want to save some animations onto floppy disk instead.

EXPOSURE LISTS

The exposure list provides a list of the frames and the order that they
appear. This list can be changed very easily to alter the order of frames,
make one frame last longer, or even repeat little sections over and over.

To delete a frame from the list simply click on the number in the list and
press the DELETE key.

To add a frame just click on the frame just before where you want the new
frame and then press RETURN. Type the number of the new frame - do not
press RETURN since this will add another frame.

NOTE: You can only add frames that have already been designed. You cannot
use a frame number higher than the highest frame number. If you want to
add a completely new frame then you must use the ADD FRAME icon.

VIDEO DIGITIZING

You can only input pictures with this section of the program if you have a
video camera and a Rombo digitizer. (See specifications in the Loading and
Installation Section).

Set up the video camera, preferably on a stand, to point at a flat area
where you can place your drawings. Connect the camera to the input on the
video digitizer according to the manufacturers' instructions.

When everything is turned on, click on the VIDEO ICON on the main screen
and you will be taken to the digitizer screen.

The first screen is for digitizing hand drawn animations. This will
quickly digitize in 2 colors (black & white) the image in front of the
camera - use Appendix B in conjunction with the Animators Scrapbook for
some examples of how to use this feature.

The LARGE EYE ICON lets you view the image before you actually digitize.
If the image is too bright or too dark then simply click on the MOON or SUN
ICON until the image is clear. When it is clear, click on the VIDEO ICON
and the program will store the image and move on to the next frame so that
you can enter the next picture in your animation. In the other booklet you
are given an example of stop-frame cut-out animation of Fred Flintstone and
pre-drawn Scooby animation for you to enter.

You can also digitize backgrounds with this part of the program. Click on
the BACKGROUND ICON and you will be presented with a screen.

The difference here is that you can use either 2, 4 or 8 shades of grey -
click on the number that you require - and the digitized image will be used
as the static background for your animation. It is often easiest to
digitize a hand drawn background in 2 colors and then color it in using the
package.

ANIMATION CONTROL PANEL

The animation control icons are

REWIND
This jumps back to the first frame in the animation

PAUSE
This pauses the animation and holds 1 frame on the screen.

PLAY
This plays the current animation once from beginning to end.

FAST FORWARD
This jumps to the last frame of the animation.

STEP BACKWARDS
This steps the animation back 1 frame.

STEP FORWARDS
This steps the animation forward 1 frame,

TORTOISE & HARE
These icons affect the speed of the animation. Click on the hare will make
the animation faster, while clicking on the tortoise will slow it down.
You can also drag the slider bar.

SAMPLE ANIMATION ART
--------------------

The sample pieces of work are in 4 directories called:

FLINT
JETSONS
SCOOBY
YOGI

When loading something in you will have to enter the directory by clicking
on the name with the mouse and then clicking on the file that you wish to
load.

ANIMATIONS

The sample animations highlight various animation techniques and features
of the package. You can load them in and step through frame by frame, or
change them, colour them in or just watch them play.

To load one of the animations follow the instructions for Loading & Saving
on Page 71. Make sure that the arrow is pointing from the disk to the
computer or you will overwrite the animation.

SAMPLE ANIMATIONS

SCOOBY
WIPE: A looping animation. Try adding some rain to each frame.

SNACK: A long animation that can be colored in. You will need a lot of
memory on your computer to finish this animation.

YOGI
GRAB: Notice how the beginning and end parts loop.

CHOMP: A simple 5 frame loop for you to color. Try changing the speed to
make Yogi eat really fast!

JETSONS
DANCE: Only 10 frames in this animation but sections are re-used to make
the dance last longer. And it loops!

EAT: Judy Jetson gets fed up! Another scene to colour.

FLINT
ROCK 1: Fred gets a surprise! Notice how his head gets larger when he is
hit to add to the effect. Another example of how frames can be re-used.

ROCK2: Try coloring in the same animation the way you want.

CLIP ART

The clip-art screen contains line drawings of art-work for you to include
in your own animations. To call up the clip art screen enter Foreground
Animate mode and click on the SCISSORS ICON with the right mouse button.

You will then get the following screen :

This is essentially a spare screen that forms no part of your animation.
Load a piece of clip-art by clicking on the DISK ICON and then selecting
the clip-art file that you wish to load. These screens contain walk cycles
of some of the characters and objects for you to include in your own
animation.

ANIMATED CLIP ART

There are 3 clip-art screens in the FLINT directory called MOWERB, MOWERF
and MOWERC. These are for you to build an animation. Draw a background
with a piece of grass in front of a long low wall.

Add the clip-art to the foreground so that you have an animation of Fred
walking across the screen pushing the mower creature with Barney leaning on
the wall watching. This animation may take a long time to assemble and
will need a lot of memory.

BACKGROUNDS

Backgrounds can be loaded in separately from animations and there are some
examples for you to use. To load a background enter Background Paint mode
and click on the BACKGROUND ICON with the right mouse button. Click on the
disk icon to load a background.

VIDEO DIGITIZING HINTS
----------------------

If you are lucky enough to have a digitizer and a video camera then there
are lots of extra things that you can do with The Hanna-Barbera Animation
Workshop. Some examples are included in the booklet.

NOTE: You do not need a digitizer or a camera for section 2.

SECTION 1 - ENTERING HAND DRAWN ANIMATIONS

Pages 1 - 14 contain a 14 frame animation of Scooby for you to enter. Set
up the video camera pointing at a flat surface as described on page 74.
Enter the digitize screen by clicking on the VIDEO ICON.

Place the first frame (Page 1) down and modify the brightness control until
you can clearly see Scooby on the screen. Try to make sure that it is dark
enough so that none of the lines are broken.

When you are happy with the picture, click on the VIDEO ICON to capture a
frame and move on to the next one. Turn the page and position it in the
same place and repeat the process until you have all 14 frames captured.
Quickly play the animation to make sure that it looks right before coloring
it and adding a background.

Now you see how this works, try drawing your own animation and entering it
onto the computer in the same way. You may find that it is quicker to draw
with a pencil on paper than trying to draw everything with the computer.

SECTION 2 - COPYING A PICTURE FROM A GRID

This is a way of accurately copying a picture. On page 15 is a picture of
Dino.

Load the background called GRID into the background screen.

Now you have the same grid on screen and you can copy the picture box by
box from the page onto the screen. Draw Dino on the foreground screen so
that when you have finished you can wipe the background away and put your
own background in!

SECTION 3 - STOP-FRAME ANIMATION USING CUT-OUTS

This is a very powerful form of animation and can quickly produce
outstanding results.

An example of a Fred Flintstone cut out is on Page 16 with some extra parts
on page 17. In order to use him, cut out the different parts of Fred and
join them together with split paper clips. It may be easier if you stick
the different parts onto card and then cut them out very carefully.

Once he is joined and can be moved, place him on the digitizing area and
set up the camera as in section 1.

You can now capture a frame, move Fred a little bit and the capture another
one and so on. With this technique you can quickly build up a very
complicated animation that would take a very long time to draw.
