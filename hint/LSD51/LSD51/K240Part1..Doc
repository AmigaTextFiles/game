EPILEPSY WARNING
----------------

Please  read  before using this video game or allowing your children to use
it.

Some  people are susceptible to epileptic seizures or loss of consciousness
when exposed to certain flashing lights or light patterns in everyday life.
Such  people may have a seizure while watching certain television images or
playing  certain  video  games.   This may happen even if the person has no
medical history of epilepsy or has never had any epileptic seizures.

If  you  or anyone in your family has ever had symptoms related to epilepsy
(seizures  or  loss  of  consciousness)  when  exposed  to flashing lights,
consult your doctor prior to playing.

We  advise  that  parents  should  monitor  the use of video games by their
children.   If  you or your child experience any of the following symptoms:
dizziness,  blurred  vision, eye or muscle twitches, loss of consciousness,
disorientation,  any  involuntary  movement  or convulsion, while playing a
video game, IMMEDIATELY discontinue use and consult your doctor.

PRECAUTIONS TO TAKE DURING USE
------------------------------

Do  not  Stand  too close to the screen.  Sit a good distance away from the
television screen, as far away as the length of the cable allows.

Preferably play the game on a small television screen.

Avoid playing if you are tired or have not had much sleep.

Make sure that the room in which you are playing is well lit.

Rest for at least 10 to 15 minutes per hour while playing a video game.

PLAYING THE GAME
----------------

From Floppy disk:

1) Turn on your Amiga,
2) Insert disk 1 in your internal disk drive, (DF0:)
3) The game will automatically boot and run

From Hard Disk:

1) Turn on your Amiga,
2) Wait for the Amiga to boot into Workbench
3) Locate the directory you have previously installed K240 into, (see 
"Installing onto Hard Disk" below) and double click on the K240 game icon,
4) The game will run.

It  is  recommended that you install K240 onto a hard disk if you have one.
The  game  will  be  easier to play due to do data and screens being loaded
almost instantaneously.

On  Machines with more than half a Meg of chip ram K240 uses sampled speech
to  announce important events.  This can cause excessive disk swopping on a
single  drive  system.   If  you do not have a second drive, we suggest you
disable  the  speech  option from the Tetracorp screen.  On the Floppy disk
version,  all saved games are made to the internal disk drive (DF0:), IT IS
IMPORTANT  THAT YOU HAVE A PRE-FORMATTED DISK FOR USE AS A SAVE-DISK BEFORE
YOU  BEGIN  TO  PLAY THE GAME!  The save disk must be formatted in standard
Amiga  format.   If  you  are  unsure  how  to  format  a  disk, follow the
instructions  given  in  the  manuals that came with the Amiga.  Each saved
game requires approximately 180K of space.

Apart  from the save-disk, which will always be in DF0, K240 will recognise
any of the game disks in any Floppy disk drive, internal or external.

On the Hard Disk version, all saved games are made to the Hard Disk, in the
same directory as the game has been installed.

Installing Onto Hard Disk

1) Turn on your Amiga.
2) Wait for the Amiga to boot into Workbench.
3) Insert K240 disk 3 into any Floppy disk drive. Wait for the disk icon 
   to appear on the screen.
4) Double click on the K240 disk icon.
5) Double click on the "Install K240" disk icon.
6) Follow on screen directions.

FINDING YOUR WAY AROUND THE MANUALS
-----------------------------------

This manual comes in three distinct sections.

a) Tutorial: 
K240  is  a  complicated game.  Once you are familiar with the basics it is
actually  quite  straightforward  to  play.   The tutorial forms a painless
introduction to the basic elements of the game, and gives you an idea where
to start.  We strongly advise that you follow it.

b) Main Reference section: 
This  explains  in  detail all of the game.  It is divided into sections so
that  you  can  easily  find out about any subject.  It is not necessary to
read this part of the manual before you commence play; you can refer to the
sections  when  you  need them; but it is worthwhile skimming through it so
that you are familiar with what you can do in the game.

A  hints  section  is  included  to assist you if you are unsure of how you
should go about developing your mining colony.

c) Technical section: 
This  contains  technical details on the various weapons, spacecraft, alien
races  etc,  as  well  as some notes on Imperial history.  The bulk of this
material is for background only, and is not necessary to play the game, but
an  understanding of these technical details may help you to develop better
strategies.


ZONE 001 : TUTORIAL
-------------------

This  section  of  the  manual  is  designed  as a full tutorial.  Over the
following pages you will be taken step by step through the initial parts of
the  game.   The  more  complex  aspects  of  the  game  will  be easier to
understand when you have this basic knowledge.

For  a  painless introduction to the game, we strongly advise you to follow
this tutorial.

Because  you will be playing a proper game during the tutorial (Alien level
1  in  fact)  events are bound to happen that are not documented here.  The
most  noticeable  of  these  will  be windows that pop up to report certain
events.  For now if any message window appears that is not explained by the
tutorial, simply ignore it and click with the left mouse button on the Exit
button  that  will  appear  in a little box beside the message window.  The
message will go away and you can continue with the tutorial.

THE MAIN ASTEROID VIEW SCREEN
-----------------------------

When  you  start  the  game select your language by picking the appropriate
flag.   When  you  reach the Tetracorp screen click on "END" to begin Alien
Level one.  You will now find yourself looking at your initial asteroid, on
the  Asteroid  View  Screen.   Before  we  go any further let`s take a look
around this screen.

In  the  centre  is  a  3-D  representation  of your asteroid showing rocky
terrain and the sole building in your colony (A Colony Preservation Unit in
green.)

In  space above the asteroid is the transporter ship that you used to reach
Sector K240.

At  bottom  right  is  a  building  icon.  This indicates which of the many
buildings  is  currently active for construction.  You`ll see how it`s used
when we look at Colony Construction in a moment.

Below  it is a blue button.  This is explained in the section of the manual
about "Time Saving Techniques".

Below that is the status line.  Messages will appear here from time to time
but usually it flashes between two important pieces or information:

a) your money in Imperial Credits
b) The date in the format: E2.yyy.dd

Where  E2  marks  the 2nd Millennium AD, yyy the year and dd the day.  Each
year  has  100 standard Imperial days.  The game begins in E2.380.01, which
is the year 2380 AD.

USING THE MOUSE
---------------

Before we go any further, lets look at the 3 different mouse modes as it is
important that you are in the correct mode for an operation.

a) Hand:
This is the default mode used for most operations.  Whilst in this mode you
can  click on the asteroid to construct buildings and click on buildings to
obtain information.

b) Arrow:
This is the Ship Selection mode.  In this mode you can ONLY click on any of
your  spacecraft  (or  Orbital Space dock) to obtain information about them
and control them.  You can perform no other function.

You  enter  this  mode  by clicking on the Ship Mode button (see later), or
pressing the "S" key.  Do so again to return to the normal "hand" mode.

c) Bomb:
This  is  the  demolish  Mode.   In  this  mode  you can ONLY demolish your
buildings  should  you  desire  to do so.  Simply click with the left mouse
button over any building to destroy it.

You  enter this mode by clicking on the demolish Mode button (see later) or
pressing the "D" key.  Do so again to return to the normal hand mode.

You  carry  out  most operations by clicking with the Left mouse button, eg
selecting ships, selecting buildings, clicking on the asteroid, clicking on
buttons, etc.

Clicking the right mouse button anywhere on the screen brings up one of the
several Button Panels.  A different button Panel appears for each different
screen.  Some buttons also lead to other Button Panels.

Most  buttons  are  explained  in the appropriate section in the manual but
there  is  a  separate  card provided which identifies the purpose of every
button.

Try it now:  Click with the right mouse button.  The Asteroid Screen Button
Panel appears with 3 rows of three buttons.

Notice  the  button  in  the  bottom  right.   This  is the Exit button and
clicking  on  it  takes  you  back  to  the  game.   Every  button Panel or
information window has an Exit button and in each instance it will resemble
the return key on your computer.

Note also, that whilst any information window or button Panel is visible on
the screen, the game is paused so take as long as you like.

THE ASTEROID FIELD SCREEN
-------------------------

Let`s  have  a  quick  look  at this before we continue.  This and the Main
Asteroid View Screen will be the screens you will use most.

From  the  Asteroid  View  Screen  bring up the button Panel as shown above
(Click the right mouse button.)

The  centre button will take you to the Asteroid Field Screen.  Click on it
now.

Your  starting  asteroid is the one rotating with a little green dot an it.
The  green  dot  indicates that the asteroid is owned by you.  Those with a
red  dot  belong  to the enemy, and those without a dot are uninhabited and
free for the taking.

Around  your  asteroid  is a small black circle.  The rest of the screen is
grey.   Grey  indicates  uncharted space, and you only know about ships and
asteroids  within  the black circle which marks the extent of your sensors.
At the start of the game it is likely that the only asteroid you know about
is your own, though there are one or two others visible.

There are two ways you can discover more asteroids:

a) Sensor Range:
If  any  asteroids move into your sensor range (the black circle) then they
will  become visible.  You can extend the range of your sensors by building
a Sensor Array and by colonising other asteroids.

b) Scout Ships:
You  can  instruct  Scouts  to  head  into uncharted space and Discover new
asteroids outside your sensor range.

Other  information  will  be laid over this screen at various points in the
game but these will be explained later.

Below  your asteroid is the acronym PAFW.  This is a status summary of your
asteroid and will appear below all asteroids owned by you.  It is used as a
quick means of seeing which of your colonies needs attention.

P   Power supplies
A   Air supplies
F   Food supplies
W   Water supplies

A green letter indicates that all is well.

An  orange  letter indicates that you are using more than you are producing
on that asteroid and will be using up your surplus.

A  red letter indicates that you are producing none at all and are existing
(or maybe not!) off surpluses alone.  Time to do something!.

These  factors are explained more fully a little later in the tutorial.  In
the section about the Colony Summary Window.

Finally, at the bottom right is the date/money indicator.

Notice that the mouse pointer is now an orange cross hair.

Let`s return to your asteroid now and look at building it up a bit.

Click with the right button to bring up the Button Panel.  Notice that this
is  a  different  button Panel to that on the Asteroid View Screen since it
has  functions  applicable  to  this  screen.  Notice again that the bottom
right button is the Exit button.

The  bottom  left  button  will  take you back to the Asteroid View Screen.
Click on it now.

CONSTRUCTING A COLONY
---------------------

We`re  now  going  to  construct a small colony an our starting asteroid to
give you a feel for colony construction.

As already mentioned, you begin with a single CPU.

There  are a range of buildings available to you and more are available for
purchase  from  the  Sci-Tek Corporation.  You select the building you want
from the Engineering Window.

As  we showed you earlier click the right mouse button to bring up the main
Button  Panel.  You access the Engineering Window by clicking on the button
at bottom left.  Click there now.

The Engineering Window
----------------------

You  can browse through the buildings available by clicking on the Left and
Right  arrow  buttons.   Have  a  look  now at whats available.  The later
section on buildings gives more detailed information about each building.

Since  we are operating a Mining Colony let`s get things started.  Cycle to
the "Mine" building.  Click on the Exit button to select this building.  As
you  return to the main Asteroid View Screen, notice that the Mine building
graphic appears at bottom right reminding you of your selection.  Until you
select another building every time you click on the asteroid you will build
a Mine.

Find  a  piece  of  flat land on the asteroid and click there with the left
mouse button, to build.

Notice  the  error  message?  Good.  We have not yet allocated any funds to
the  Engineering  Section.  To do this, bring up the Button Panel and click
on  the  Information  button  (middle top).  This in turn brings up another
Button Panel.  Click on the Financial Funds button top-right)

You are now in the Financial Funds Window.  Before we proceed we`ll explain
how this works.

Financial Funds Window
----------------------

You have 5 different budgets to manage:

Money          -  spare cash not assigned to any budget
Construction   -  used for constructing buildings
Vehicles       -  used for constructing spacecraft
Intelligence   -  used tor financing spying
Missiles       -  used for constructing missiles

The  number  at  the  far  right gives the amount allocated to each budget.
There are also 3 bar charts for each budget.

Green          -  Each block = 5,000 credits     (heading is "5k")
Orange         -  Each block = 100,000 credits   (heading is "100k")
Red            -  Each block = 1,000,000 credits (heading is "1M")

To  add  some  money  to a budget simply click somewhere on the appropriate
line, under any of the three columns.  So if you click on the VEHICLES line
between  the  5K and 100K headings you will add one or more blocks of 5,000
credits.   Clicking  between  100K  and  1M  will add one or more blocks of
100,000  credits.   The  further to the right you click the more blocks you
will add.  To fine tune the amount, click and hold down the left button and
drag it either left or right - this will add or remove a block.

Go ahead and experiment, its easier to use than to describe!

To  remove  some  money  from a budget click and drag left to remove one or
more blocks.

Notice that all money is given to or taken from the Spare Cash line (called
MONEY)  at  the  top,  so you cannot directly move money from one budget to
another,  you  have to delete it from one budget (making it spare cash) and
then  add it to another budget.  If you are trying to add money to a budget
and  nothing  is happening, its probably because you have no spare cash and
you`ll have to reduce another budget first.

Continuing our tutorial return all your money to the Spare Cash line at the
top.   We  need  to  put  some  money  into  CONSTRUCTION so add some in by
clicking  on the CONSTRUCTION line.  Anything over 100,000 Cr should do for
now.  Add the lot if you like.  If during the rest of the tutorial you find
that  one of your budgets has run out, simply return to the Financial Funds
Window and allocate some more money.

Now exit from this window (using the "exit" button) and return to the game.

Construction
------------

You  can  now  build  some Mines by clicking on the asteroid.  Build 2 or 3
Mines.  Notice that scaffolding appears as your men begin work.

If  you  click  on  the scaffolding with the left mouse button and hold the
button  down  you  will be told what is being built and how many days until
completion.

Go  back  to  the  Engineering Window and move on a few buildings until you
come  to  a  Storage  Facility.   Exit  the store and build a Store on your
asteroid.

You  may want to build a couple of Solar Generators too, to ensure you have
enough power.

Interrogating Buildings
-----------------------

If  you click on an existing building with the left mouse button it will be
identified.  Certain buildings also pop up information or control windows.

As an example click on one of your finished Mines.  There is no information
window for a mine just it`s name at the bottom of the screen.

Click  on  the  Store  and  you are presented with a listing of all the ore
being  held in your Stores at this time.  For further details see the entry
on Stores in the buildings section.

We suggest that you now construct a few more buildings on your asteroid and
when  they are built, click on them to see what information you can obtain.
For  now  simply  exit  any  information windows and refer to the Buildings
section  for  more  details.   Build  what  you  like  but  we  suggest the
following:

                       4 or 5 Solar Generators
                       Command Centre
                       Weapons Factory
                       Decontamination Filter
                       Medical centre
                       2 or 3 Mines
                       2 or 3 Deep Bore Mines
                       Storage Facility
                       Sensor array

Tactical Mode
-------------

If  you  were  having  difficulty locating a flat piece of land to build on
there are two ways around this:

The  first  is to rotate the asteroid around so you can see behind existing
buildings.  To do this bring up the main Button Panel.  Click on the middle
left  button  which  will  take  you  to the Asteroid Control Button Panel.
There  are  two  yellow  arrow  buttons.   Clicking on them will rotate the
entire asteroid left or right by 90 degrees.

A  quicker way of doing this is to use the left and right arrow keys on the
keyboard.

Notice  how  the Transporter in orbit rotates as well since you are viewing
the entire asteroid from another viewpoint.

The  other  method  to  assist you is the Tactical Mode.  Bring up the main
Button  Panel  and  then the Asteroid Control Button Panel just like above.
The bottom left button (a blue cube) toggles the tactical mode on and off.

Solid  box  with  "N"  indicates normal mode 
Outline box with "T" indicates tactical mode.

The  button  will  not  take effect until you exit out of the button panels
(Later we`ll show you a quicker way to access buttons!)

Notice  that  when you exit the button panels all the buildings and terrain
have  disappeared  to be replaced by colour coded squares.  You can now see
every part of the asteroid and selecting a site to build upon is easy.

You  can  also  click on buildings to obtain information just as you can in
normal mode.

The various colours represent the following features:

Light Grey     -   Flat land
Dark Grey      -   Terrain unsuitable for building
Light Blue     -   Buildings
Red            -   Landing Pads
White          -   Buildings protected by a Screen Generator
Green          -   Asteroid Virus deposits
Dark Blue      -   Anti Virus deposits

We`ll explain some of these later.

A  quicker way of changing between normal and tactical mode is to press the
SPACE key on the keyboard.

Tutorial Conclusion
-------------------

You  should  now  have  an understanding of the basics of the game:  How to
access button Panels, view your asteroid, access the asteroid Field Screen,
select and build a building, manage your budgets, and so on.

The  rest  of  the  manual  is  a  reference  section  and will explain the
important  features of the game in depth.  We would recommend that you read
the  reference  sections.   In  the  order  they  appear, as they have been
structured in such a way as to be chronologically correct ie they appear in
the order that you are going to need them in.


ZONE 002 : COLONY MANAGEMENT
----------------------------

Your  prime directive is to extract and sell as much ore as you can but the
most  successful  and productive mining colonies all rely upon a strong and
stable  colony  infrastructure.   It  is  vital  to  regularly  monitor the
colonies on all your asteroids and to keep them running smoothly.

There are four main aspects to successful colony management:

a) Population
b) Security
c) Life Support
d) Power

a) Population
Though  many  parts of your mining equipment are robotic,the robots usually
only  undertake  the  tasks  that  are most dangerous to human life.  Human
employees are required for many important duties and to oversee and control
the  robots.   To  support  the mining and technician employees there is an
entire  Service Industry offering training, relaxation and participation in
other  leisure  activities.   Shifts  are  long  and  hard  and as a result
Tetracorp encourage their employees to play hard too.

Procreation  is  outlawed  on  mining  colonies for safety reasons but your
colonies  will  slowly  grow  in  population  as  your personnel department
entices  more  men and women out from the Home Worlds.  The more successful
and  smoother  running  your  colonies  the easier recruitment becomes.  In
general  your population will grow slowly to fill all avaiable living space
so  you  can  directly  control  your  population by building fewer or more
Living  Quarters.   The  Colony  Summary  Window  (see below) indicates the
number  of  surplus  employees you have.  These are employees available for
backup roles and to operate alternate shifts with technical employees.  For
stability  attempt  to  keep the surplus positive but not too high.  If the
surplus  is  negative  then your employees are stretched and may be working
double  shifts to complete necessary work morale will deteriorate.  If your
surplus  is  too  high,  boredom can effect those not currently working and
trouble can break out.

b) Security
Morale  can  fluctuate  quickly on a mining colony.  Spaces are cramped and
employees  work  and  play with the same faces day in and day out.  Tempers
can  flare,  fights  are  commonplace  and  employees are quick to anger at
management  failures.  There would be mutiny every day were it not for your
dedicated and highly paid security team.

Security  will keep your employees under control but only if their presence
is  large enough.  Each Security Centre can easily manage 150 employees and
often  many  more  but  don`t  stretch  your  security  too thin or you are
inviting big trouble.

You  will  be  issued  with reports when (if?) trouble breaks out but don`t
wait  for  these  reports monitor the Security status in the Colony Summary
Window (see below)

c) Life Support
Each  asteroid  colony must be self sufficient and that means producing its
own Air, Food and Water.  Each employee uses 1 unit of each every day so it
is  necessary  to  produce  at  least  as  many  units  per day as you have
employees but it is also wise to produce and store a surplus.

Initially  each  asteroid  colony  begins with a single Colony Preservation
Unit (CPU) which provides living space, power, air, food and water but only
for  a  limited  population  and  time.  (see description of the CPU in the
Buildings section) To back up the CPU you need other support buildings.

                 BUILDING                 PRODUCES

                 Life Support              AIR
                 Hydroponics               FOOD
                 Hydration Plant           WATER

In addition Environment Control continues where the CPU left off by storing
all three of the above in vast quantities.

The Colony Summary Window (see below) details how much of each resource you
are  producing,  using and storing, so monitor it often and keep production
ahead of population growth.

More  information is given for each of the above buildings in the Buildings
section.

Remember also that the PAFW display on the Asteroid Field Screen provides a
quick  summary  of the status of your asteroids.  PAFW was explained in the
tutorial pages.

d) Power
Clearly  nothing  can  operate without power.  The Buildings section of the
manual  details the power requirement of every building.  There are several
power  production  buildings  and  more  efficient  ones are available from
Sci-Tek.  Like Life Support it`s vital to use the Colony Summary Window and
PAFW  to  monitor  the  status  of power to each colony and keep production
ahead of usage.

Should  you  suffer power shortages some buildings will fail before others.
In  general the most vital buildings like Life Support and Hydroponics will
fail  last.   To  see which buildings have failed simply click on any power
generating building and those buildings without power will be listed.

RADIATION
---------

Each  asteroid has background radiation some higher than others.  Radiation
is expressed as a percentage.  0% means the radiation is immeasurable above
the  radiation given off from the local star.  Any value of 50% or lower is
acceptable  but higher radiation is harmful and will result in sickness and
even deaths amoungst your employees.  Use Radiation Filters to provide them
with  the  necessary  protection.   (see  the  description in the Buildings
section).

Factors  that  lead to high radiation values are the use of Nuclear missles
extensive  combat  and the presence of rare ores such as Traxium and Nexos.
When  mining  these ores you must be very careful to protect your employees
using Radiation Filters.

COLONY SUMMARY WINDOW
---------------------

You can access this by clicking on any of the colony support buildings such
as  Living  Quarters  Life Support, Hydroponics and CPU etc.  Remember that
you  must  be in Normal (hand) mode.  You can also access it via the button
in the Asteroid View Screen Button Panel.

This  information  gives  you  an important breakdown on the status of your
colony on that asteroid.

You  are  told  your current population, your maximum population, the total
space  in  all  your  Living Quarter) and Surplus Population.  As explained
above  in  Colony  management  try to keep the surplus a positive number to
allow  for  growth  but  if you overpopulate your asteroid you risk running
short of food, water and air.

Keep an eye on the Radiation reading (see Radiation above).

The  most  important  part of the Colony Summary Window is the breakdown of
Power,  Air,  Food and Water.  You are told how much you are producing, how
much is being used daily and how much is stored for later use.

The  colour  codes give you an instant indication of which of these factors
may need attention:

Green      -    No problems
Orange     -    The asteroid is using a commodity faster than it is being 
                produced. Your reserves are being used up.
Red        -    The asteroid is no longer producing a commodity and you are 
                running entirely from reserves (or maybe none at all!) you 
                must rectify the situation quickly!

The  Security  line  provides a summary of employee morale on the asteroid.
If  the  message suggests that the asteroid is not secure you would be wise
to construct another Security Centre.

The final line reminds you which fleets are present at this asteroid.

There are also some options available by using the supplied buttons:

            RENAME       INVENTORY      EXIT

Clicking  on RENAME allows you to rename the asteroid.  You can personalise
all  your asteroids and give them a name that reflects their function, like
MAIN MINE or ORE DEPOT or SPACE DOCK etc.

Simply  delete the existing name using the backspace key and enter your own
name up to 15 characters.

Clicking  on  INVENTORY will provide a detailed listing of how many of each
type  of building you have.  The listing is broken down into pages - simply
use the Arrow Buttons to cycle through the pages.

ASTEROID MINING
---------------

The purpose of your colony in sector K240 is to locate and extract ores for
sale  to  Tetracorp  and  the  Empire.   The more you sell, the larger your
profits  and  your fame in the mining fraternity.  This section details how
to mine ore, what to do with it, how to transport it and how to sell it.

DISCOVERING ORE
---------------

The  first  step  is  to  locate  asteroids  rich  in  ore  deposits.  This
Exploration  Phase  requires  the use of one or more Scout Ships.  To go in
search  of  new  asteroids  dispatch the Scout with orders to Explore.  For
details of how to do this see the section on Controlling Spacecraft and pay
particular attention to the subsection on Scouts.

Each  asteroid  has  different  amounts  of each type of ore.  To determine
which  asteroids are the most abundant in ore you must use a Scout with the
orders  to  Prospect  for  ore.   Again  see  the  section  on  Controlling
Spacecraft.

When  the  scout  has examined the asteroid it will return to its departure
asteroid and present you with an ore report.  You can obtain this report at
any  time  for any at the asteroids you have prospected, by clicking on the
Geology button.

The  Ore  Report simply details how much of each type of ore remains on the
asteroid  to be mined.  The most common are shown at the top and the rarest
at the bottom.

ORE EXTRACTION
--------------

To  extract  ore you must have one or more mines.  There are three types of
mine  each  mining  a  particular range of ores.  The table below indicates
which mines you require to mine particular ores by colour coding them:


Selenium       Red           Red requires a mine
Asteros        Red
Barium         Red
Crystalite     Red
Quazinc        Orange        Orange requires a deep bore mine
Bytanium       Orange
Korellium      Orange
Dragonium      Orange
Traxium        Green         Green requires a Seismic Penetrator
Nexos          Green         obtainable from Sci-Tek


As  well  as  providing  adequate power for the mines you must build one or
more  Stores  to  hold  the ore.  Clicking on a Store building provides you
with a listing of what ores you have in ALL the stores on that asteroid.

Each  mine  extracts one unit of ore about every 8 to 16 days.  You have no
control over which units are extracted.

The  main thing to remember about mining is to keep it running smoothly and
consistently.  Here are a few other points to bear in mind:

Make sure there is enough power for all mines.

Keep  a  constant  track  on  the  population  of your asteroid and try and
maintain a positive surplus.

Make sure you have enough storage space for the ore.

ORE USAGE
---------

What do you do with ore?

1) Use it for ship construction
2) Use it for missile construction
3) Sell it to the Empire (see later)

This is a summary of most of the cases in the game when you wil need ore:

 ORE            NEEDED FOR

Selenium        Explosive Missile, Scatter Missile, Assault Fighter,
                Combat Eagle, Scout Ship, Destructor, Terminator
                Transporter, Fleet Battleship

Asteros         Nuclear Missile, Powerplant

Barium          Area Explosive Missile, Anti Virus Missile, Spy Satellite

Crystalite      Vortex Missile, Assault Fighter, Combat Eagle
                Scout Ship, Destructor.
      
Quazinc         Napalm Missile, Hellfire Missile
  
Bytanium        Space Dock
 
Korellium       Stasis Missile

Dragonium       Space Dock, Terminator, Transporter, Fleet Battleship

Traxium         Virus Missile
  
Nexos           Mega missile  


SELLING ORE
-----------

It  is  necessary to retain some ore for your own use but the remainder can
be sold to Tetracorp and the Empire.  The Empire offers prices for ore that
vary  each Imperial year.  You may attempt to play the markets and wait for
a  high  price  before you sell ore but don`t speculate for too long or the
price may drop again.

To  obtain  the  Imperial  Ore Prices click on the Command Centre building.
These  are  the  prices  that  the  Empire  will  pay for each unit of ore.
Sometimes  the  Empire  will  guarantee  prices for a number of years for a
particular  ore type that it needs badly.  In this case the letter "H" will
appear  after  the ore price to indicate that the price has been held.  The
number  after  the "H" indicates the number of years that the price is held
for.

The  Prices  window  also  indicates  the  number  of  days before the next
Imperial Ore Carrier arrives at your colony.  This is important because you
can only sell ore when the Imperial Ore Carrier arrives.

The  Imperial Ore Carrier will always arrive at whichever of your asteroids
has  the  most ore in its Stores.  You can use this fact to ensure that you
transport  ore in from your other asteroids.  Tetracorp recommends that you
have  a  central  asteroid  that acts as a major storage depot and that all
other asteroids regularly ship their ore to this depot.

The  Imperial  Ore Carrier remains in orbit about your asteroid for a short
time before returning to the Imperial Home Worlds.  5 days before it leaves
the crew will radio down with the appropriate message.

Click  on  the Imperial Ore Carrier (whilst in Ship Selection Mode) and you
will  gain  access  to the Ore Transfer Window.  This lists all the ore you
have  in  the  asteroids  stores and the contents of the Ore Carriers cargo
bays.  The current Imperial Prices are listed for convenience.

To  transfer  ore to the Ore Carrier click over the name of the type of ore
with  the right mouse button.  A quantity of ore will be transferred.  This
quantity  depends upon which ore type you have selected.  Since you usually
have large numbees of the cheaper ores the transfer quantity is large.  For
rarer ores it is small.

Ores marked as red     50 units at a time.
Ores marked as orange   5 units at a time.
Ores marked as green    1 unit  at a time.

If  you  change your mind you can unload ore from the Ore Carrier into your
Asteroid  Stores by clicking with the left mouse button.  Note that you can
only Unload ore that you have previously loaded:  there is no way of buying
ore from the Empire.

You can access the Ore Transfer Window as many times as you like whilst the
Ore  Carrier  orbits  your asteroid.  You will be paid for the ore when the
Ore Carrier returns to the Imperial Home Worlds.

TRANSPORTING ORE
----------------

There are two methods of transporting ore between your asteroids:

a) Using a Transporter Ship
b) Using an Ore Teleporter Building

The  Ore  Teleporter  must  be  bought  from  Sci-Tek  but is a very useful
facility.   It  enables you to instantly teleport ore between any asteroids
that  have  an  Ore  Teleporter  installed.   This  facility is perfect for
transferring  ore  to  your  ore  depot  at  the  last  minute when using a
Transporter may take too long.

For  details about how to use the Ore Teleporter see the description of the
Ore Teleporter in the Buildings section.

TRANSPORTER SHIP
----------------

This  is  the main means of moving ore between your asteroids.  The general
procedure is:

a) Load ore onto Transporter from asteroid Stores
b) Move Transporter to another asteroid
c) Unload ore from Transporter into new asteroid Stores

Load Ore
--------

Click  on  the  Transporter  (whilst  in Ship Selection Mode) to access the
Spacecraft  Control Window.  (See appropriate section for details) Click on
the  LOAD/UNLOAD  ORE  order  button  and  you will access the Ore Transfer
Window.   This  lists  all the ore you have in the asteroids stores and the
contents of the Transporters cargo bays.

To  Load ore onto the Transporter simply use the same process as is used to
load ore onto the Imperial carrier.

Ores marked as red        50 units at a time
Ores marked as orange      5 units at a time.
Ores marked as green       1 unit  at a time.

Move Transporter
----------------

See  the  section  on Controlling Spacecraft for details of how to send the
Transporter to another asteroid

Unload Ore
----------

The  procedure  for Unloading ore is identical for that of Loading ore (see
above)  except that ore is transferred from the Transporter to the asteroid
Stores using the left mouse button.


ZONE 003 : SPACECRAFT CONSTRUCTION
----------------------------------

You  will  not get very far in the game without constructing a ship for one
reason or another.  This section describes how to do so.

There  are  8  types of ship and each has its uses as summarised here.  For
greater  details  about  each  ship, see the Spacecraft descriptions in the
technical supplement.

These ships can only be built using a Spacecraft Construction Yard:


NAME               USE                              HARDPOINTS

Assault Fighter    Combat                               1
 
Combat Eagle       Combat                               2

Scout Ship         Exploration/Prospecting/Spying       1


These ships can only be built using a Space Dock: (see Space Docks)

NAME               USE                              HARDPOINTS

Destructor         Combat                               3

Terminator         Combat                               4

Transporter        Colonisation/Ore Transporting        2

Fleet Battleship   Combat                               6

Space Dock         Constructing Larger Spacecraft       4


Spacecraft Construction Yard

Once  you have built one or more Construction Yards, you can begin building
the 3 smaller ship types.  Before you do so, you must have the following:

A Weapons Factory on the current asteroid

Money allocated into the Vehicles Fund (See Financial Funds)

Appropriate ore in Stores on the current asteroid.

Ship  construction will pause if all these things are not present.  You can
check  the  status of the Yard that is currently building ships by clicking
on  the  Yard.   Instead of the options to build ships, you will be given a
progress  report.   This  report will state if any of the above factors are
not catered for.

Each  Yard  can  only  construct one type of ship at a time (but up to 6 of
that type) but if you have another Yard then it can be building a different
type  of ship at the same time.  Each Yard can construct up to 3 ships at a
time or 6 if you have purchased the Construction Droids from Sci-Tek.

Spacecraft Construction Window

This  appears when you click on a vacant Spacecraft Construction Yard or on
the Space Dock.

Click  on  LEFT  or RIGHT or use the left and right arrows to cycle through
the ships available to you.

Most  of the ship details are repeated in the Spacecraft descriptions given
in the technical section but a few require explanation.

The  number  in  brackets  after  the ships name equals the number of ships
currently  selected  for  construction.   Click  on  BUILD to Increase this
number.

There  are  two Armour Figures.  The first is the basic armour of the ships
hull.   The  second figure (in brackets) is the total armour if any defence
hardpoints have been installed in the ship (see below).

The  Build  Times,  both  for  individual ships and for the whole group are
indicated here.

The Ore Needed is also displayed.

The Cost is the basic Hull cost + the total hardpoint cost (in brackets) to
give the total cost for each ship and for the whole production.

Hardpoints

Each  ship has a number of hardpoints into which you can install any of the
available  weapons/  defenses.   This flexible system allows you to produce
custom  ships  for  specific  purposes.   Hardpoint  weapons  fall  into  3
categories:

a) Weapon for use against an enemy asteroid
b) Weapon for use against an enemy ship
c) Defence.

Here are a few suggestions:

1) An Eagle with 2 attack weapons for use as an attack ship
2) An Eagle with 1 shield weapon and 1 attack weapon for defensive purposes
3) A Terminator with all hardpoints installed with anti asteroid weapons to 
   maximise an attack against an enemy asteroid
4) A Terminator with all hardpoints installed with anti ship weapons to use 
   as part of a fleet intercepting enemy fleets (see later)

Since  a  ship with all anti asteroid weapons could not defend itself if if
were  attacked  by enemy ships it may be wise to have a couple of each type
so the ship can attack an asteroid OR a ship.

You  must  decide  the  contents  of each hardpoint depending upon your own
strategies.

Details on each hardpoint weapon are given in the technical section.

Weapon Installation

To  Install a weapon into a hardpoint you must first select the weapon.  In
the  bottom  left  window  are  up  to  8 available weapon icons.  More are
available  by  clicking  on  the NEXT button.  There are two sets of 8, but
many are blank until they are purchased from Sci-Tek.

Click  on one of the weapon icons with the left mouse button and it will be
selected.  Its name and cost will be shown.  You can install this in one of
the  ship's  hardpoints  by clicking with the left mouse button over one of
the red boxes on the ship blueprint.  The weapon is now installed.

To  remove  the weapon simply click on it again.  To install another weapon
instead,  select  another  weapon  from the bottom icons and click over the
already  occupied  hardpoint.   The  old  weapon will disappear leaving the
hardpoint empty.  Click again to install the new weapon.

Do  this  for  every hardpoint on the ship, though you may leave hardpoints
blank if you are really short of money!

When  you  are  satisfied  with your ship remember to select the number you
want to build, using the BUILD button.  Then click on EXIT and construction
will  begin  provided  you  have  enough money and ore, and that you have a
Weapons Factory.

You may clear everything at any time by clicking on ABORT.

After Construction

As  each  ship is completed it will be stored.  Smaller ships are stored in
the  asteroid Hangers (see the section on Controlling Ships).  Larger ships
as constructed by the Space Dock remain in orbit awaiting your commands.

SPACE DOCKS
-----------

A  Space  Dock is necessary if you want to construct the larger spacecraft.
Since  the  Space  Dock has 4 hardpoints and a large amount of armour it is
also an effective defence against attack by enemy ships.

Constructing a Space Dock

Each  asteroid  can only support one Space Dock.  To construct one you must
have  a  Command  Centre  on the asteroid.  Click on the Command Centre and
then  on  the  Space  Dock Button that appears.  You are presented with the
Ship  Construction  screen  and  the details of the Space Dock.  Notice how
much ore and money is required!

Use  the  method described above to construct the Space Dock.  If you go to
the Asteroid Orbit Screen you will see scaffolding appear in space as it is
built.   Eventually this scaffolding will clear and your Space Dock will be
ready for use.  To obtain a status report click on the scaffolding.

Using a Space Dock
------------------

To construct one of the larger ships simply go to the Asteroid Orbit Screen
and  click on the Space Dock.  The Ship Construction Window will appear and
you can proceed as described above.

CONTROLLING SPACECRAFT
----------------------

Ships  can  be  controlled  individually  or  as  a group known as a fleet.
Controlling Fleets is dealt with later.

To  issue  orders to a ship you must click on the ship whilst in Spacecraft
Selection  Mode.  This is where the mouse pointer is a white arrow, NOT the
normal hand.  There are 2 ways to get into Spacecraft Selection Mode:
 
a) Click on the Ship button
b) Press the "S" key. 

Both toggle between Normal Hand Mode and Spacecraft Selection Mode.

When you click on a ship the Spacecraft Control Window appears:

The ship details remind you what the capabilities of this ship are, such as
the  contents of its hardpoints and remaining armour points.  It also tells
you  which fleet (1 to 8) this ship may belong to, or zero if it doesnt yet
belong to a fleet.

Orders are given by clicking on the buttons.  You can give each ship one or
two  orders  to carry out at a time.  Most ships revert to Patrol Mode when
they complete their orders, waiting for you to issue new ones.

Each  ship  has different orders available to it so we`ll examine each ship
individually.

Assault Fighter & Combat Eagle

These ships have the same orders.

 Land   Land Hanger  Patrol    Join Fleet   Go To Asteroid   Exit   Abort

LAND:
The  simplest order.  This simply causes the ship to locate a random vacant
square on the asteroid and land on it.

LAND HANGER:
Similar  to  LAND except that the ship will locate one of your Landing Pads
and  land there.  Once on the Pad the elelator will automaticaily lower the
ship  into the underground hangers safly storing the ship.  See the section
Controlling  Hangered  Ships for how to gain access to the ship again.  The
main  advantage at hangering ships is to get them to safety during an enemy
attack Damaged ships are repaired whilst they are in the hangers.

PATROL:
The  ship  will  enter  the  standard  patrol mode.  It will repeatedly fly
between  the  Asteroid View Screen and the Orbit Screen ready for any enemy
attack.

JOIN FLEET:
This  order is used to assign the ship to one of the 8 fleets.  For details
see  the later section on Controlling Fleets.  When you click on the button
the  order "JOIN FLEET 1" appears in the order window To assign the ship to
another fleet simply click successively on the JOIN FLEET button.

The  ship  will  do one of 3 things depending upon its position relative to
the fleet:

a)  If  the  fleet  and ship are in orbit around the same asteroid the ship
will immediately join the fleet and go into Patrol Mode.

b)  If  the  flett is in orbit around the current asteroid and the ships in
the  underground  hanger  it will launch from the hangers via a Landing Pad
and then join the fleet.

c)  If  the  fleet is at a different asteroid to the ship, or travelling in
space  between asteroids the ship will automatically leave the asteroid and
travel to join the fleet wherever it is.

Note:   Once  a  ship is in a fleet it can only be controlled via the Fleet
Control  Window  (see  appropriate section).  To remove a ship from a fleet
either  use the LEAVE option from the Fleet Control Window or simply access
the   Spacecraft   Control   Window  and  give  it  new  orders.   It  will
automatically leave the fleet and carry out the new orders.

GO TO ASTEROID:
This  order  allows  you  to  send  on  individual ship to another asteroid
friendly  or  otherwise.   It  is often easier to send ships in Fleets (see
later) but there are times when you need or want to send a single ship.

When you click on the button you will be taken to the Asteroid Field Screen
with  all  the  known  asteroids  shown.   Simply click with the left mouse
button  on the destination asteroid.  Back at the Spacecraft Control Window
notice that your order has been entered into the orders window.

EXIT:
Use  this  to  exit  the  Control  Window  and initiate the orders you have
programmed if any.

ABORT:
Use  this to erase any current orders ready for you to enter new ones, (You
must  ABORT current orders first).  You can also use ABORT followed by EXIT
to cancel all orders and cause the ship to stop in space.

Scout Ship

This ship has all the orders available to the Assault Ship and Combat Eagle
and three new ones:

          PROSPECT         EXPLORE          SPY

The  primary  purpose of the Scout Ship is to explore space looking for new
asteroids  and then to prospect these asteroids to report what ore deposits
are there.

SPY:
Once  you  know the location of one or more enemy colonies, you can use the
Scout  to  gather  very basic information about them.  For full details see
the section on Spying.

EXPLORE:
Initially your knowledge of the asteroid field is very limited and you will
need  to send out one or more scouts to discover new asteroids to colonise.
Use this option.

When you click on the button vou will be taken to the Asteroid Field Screen
with  all  the  known  asteroids  shown.  Space is divided into 40 sectors.
Simply click with the left mouse button on the sector you wish to head for.
Back  at  the  Spacecraft  Control  Window, notice that your order has been
entered into the orders window.

The  scout  will  head  for the chosen sector looking for asteroids all the
while.   As  soon  as  it  discovers  one  it  will return to the departure
asteroid  to  report its findings.  The asteroid will become visible on the
Asteroid Field Screen and you will receive a bonus payment.

PROSPECT:
It  is  vital that you prospect new asteroids to discover what ore deposits
are available for mining.  Use this option frequently.

When you click on the button you will be taken to the Asteroid Field Screen
where  all  known  asteroids will be displayed.  Simply click with the left
mouse  button  on the destination asteroid.  Back at the Spacecraft Control
Window notice that your order has been entered into the orders window.

The  scout  will travel to the chosen asteroid land take mining samples and
then return.  Upon its return it will issue a report of the ore deposits it
has found.  You can then decide whether the asteroid is worth colonising or
not.

Destructor & Terminator

These  ships  have  the same orders as the Assault Fighter except that they
can neither LAND nor LAND HANGER.

Transporter

  COLONISE    LOAD ORE     GO TO AST    JOIN FLEET    ABORT    EXIT

The two new options available are COLONISE and LOAD/UNLOAD ORE

The Transporter is primarily used for two functions:

a) Starting a colony on a new asteroid
b) Transporting ore between colony asteroids

COLONISE:
When  you  have  located  an  asteroid  that  you wish to colonise you must
dispatch  a  Transporter  to begin the new colony.  Starting a colony costs
30000 Cr which must be available in the Free Money Grant.  (See the section
On  Financial  Funds).   Upon  arrival at the chosen asteroid the Transport
will  begin  construction  of  a  Colony  Preservation  Unit.  Once this is
complete  you  may begin to build up your colony to your requirements.  See
the section on Colonisation for further details.

To give the required orders to the transporter first click on GO TO AST and
select  an asteroid.  (See instructions above).  Then click on COLONISE and
EXIT.

If you want to start a colony on the asteroid the Transporter is already in
orbit around, simply click on COLONISE.

LOAD/UNLOAD ORE:
Clicking  on  this  button  brings  up  the  Ore Transportation Window, and
enables  you  to move ore between the cargo bays on the Transporter and the
Stores on the current asteroid

See  the  section  on  Ore Transportation in the Mining section for further
details.

Fleet Battleship

This  has  only  the  following  orders  available  to  it all of which are
detailed above:

    GO TO AST       JOIN FLEET       ABORT       EXIT

Space Dock

No  orders are available to the Space Dock.  Clicking upon it will initiate
the  Spacecraft  Construction  Window.   See the section on Space Docks for
further details.

CONTROLLING HANGERED SHIPS
--------------------------

When  ships  are in the underground hanger you obviously can`t control them
by clicking on the ship graphic.  Instead you must click on the Landing Pad
whilst in Normal Hand Mode.  This brings up the Ship Inventory Window.

This  details all the ships in orbit around the current asteroid and in the
underground hangers, but ONLY ships not currently members of another fleet.
All these ships are available for control.

To  select  one  or  more ships click the mouse button over the name of the
ship.   Click  right  to  select  one  ship  or  left to deselect one ship.
Selected  ships  are  shown  by green blocks, and non selected ships by red
blocks.  You can quickly select more than one of a ship by holding down the
mouse  button.   The  numbers at the right remind you of how many ships you
have selected.

The ABORT button will deselect all selected ships.

The Exit button will exit the window performing no action on the ships.

Clicking on the SHIP button enables to you to access the Spacecraft Control
Window  and issue orders to the ships as described earlier in this section.
You  can now issue any order to the ships and they will automatically leave
the hangers via a Landing Pad before carrying out those orders.

A  distinct  advantage  of  using the Ship inventory Screen is that you can
issue  the  same orders to several ships at once.  You could select several
ships  and  tell them all to land in the hangers or go to an asteroid.  You
cannot  however  give  them  different  parameters to the order:  so if you
ordered  7  scouts  to explore, they would all head for the same sector you
couldn't direct them to different sectors.

Note  also  that  some  orders  are  unavailable to certain ships eg if you
selected  a  Scout  and a Transporter, you could order the Scout to explore
but  the  Transporter would simply ignore that order.  They`re Transporters
you see.  For transporting things.


ZONE 004 : SPYING
-----------------

Though  the  Empire  and  Tetracorp  have  extensive  databases  containing
information  about  the known alien races, much of this data is interpreted
and  assumed  from  long distance sensors and spy satellites.  We know very
little  about  the  physical  make up of alien colonies and even less about
their expansion and military tactics.

During  your  exploration  of  sector K240 you will need to supplement this
information  with  more  specific  details  discovered  by  your own spying
efforts.  Obtaining data about the aliens on a regular basis will allow you
to predict their moves and could well give you an edge over them in combat.

There  is  nothing  you  can learn until you discover at least one of their
asteroid  colonies (It will be marked on the Asteroid Field Screen by a red
dot).

There are two approaches to gathering information:

a) A Scout Spying Mission
b) A Spy Satellite

USING SCOUTS TO SPY
-------------------

This is the easiest approach to spying but the information gained is limited.

Once  you have an available Scout click on the SPY button in the Spacecraft
Control  Window.   You  will be taken to the Asteroid Field Screen with all
the known asteroids shown.  Click on the asteroid of interest with the left
mouse button.  Back at the Spacecraft Control Window notice that your order
has been entered into the orders window.

The  scout will head for the chosen asteroid.  Once there it will gather as
much  information  as  it  can  without  being  detected and return to your
asteroid to issue a report.

The  report  simply indicates the number of buildings on the enemy asteroid
(not what types), the number of ships observed in orbit around the asteroid
and in particular the number of Transporter ships and Battleships (or ships
of  a  similar size since exact ship details vary from alien to alien).  Be
aware that due to the brevity of the Scouts mission, this information is an
estimation only.

THE USE OF SPY SATELLITES
-------------------------

There  are  three  major reasons for using Spy Satellites rather than Scout
Ships for spying:

a) They offer more detailed information
b) They provide warnings of enemy fleet and missile movements
c) They allow you to examine the enemy asteroid

Once  you  have  a Spy Satellite orbiting an enemy asteroid, it continually
transmits  back  video information about the surface of the asteroid.  This
allows  you  to  use  the Asteroid View Screen and actually watch the enemy
colony  yourself,  to  see  what  buildings they have, how quickly they are
building,  what  ships  are  in  orbit  etc.   This information is free and
extremely useful.  If you click on an enemy building you can get an idea of
its function.

The  only other time you can watch an enemy asteroid from the Asteroid View
Screen  is  when you have ships or fleets currently attacking it.  Then you
can watch the battle take place!

CONSTRUCTING A SPY SATELLITE
----------------------------

You  may have as many satellites as you wish.  To construct one you need to
build a Satellite Silo on one or more of your asteroids.

When  you  click on the Satellite Silo with the left mouse button you enter
the  Satellite  Construction  Window.  You are told the number of satelites
currently in the asteroid hangers and the number under construction.

     BUILD     ABORT     LAUNCH     TARGET      EXIT

To  construct  a new satellite click on BUILD.  Each click will order a new
satellite  to be constructed.  You may cancel these requests for satellites
by clicking on ABORT.

At  the present time each satellite costs 10,000 Cr and requires 2 units of
Barium  Ore.   You  also  require a Weapons Factory on the same asteroid to
construct the complicated shielding equipment needed by the satellite.  The
money  is  taken  from  the Intelligence Grant so ensure you have allocated
sufficient  funds  to  that grant via the Financial Funds Window.  A status
line will inform you of any problems with construction.

Completed satellites are sent to the main asteroid hangers and are ready to
launch.  It is recommended that you construct several satellites before you
actually need them.

LAUNCHING A SPY SATELLITE
-------------------------

To launch a satellite click on the Satellite Silo and check that it reports
that you have a satellite available for launch.

First  you  must  select its destination.  Click on the TARGET button.  You
will  be  taken  to the Asteroid Field Screen where you can select an enemy
asteroid by clicking on it with the left mouse button.  This target will be
remembered  by  the  Satellite  Silo  until  either  you  change  it or the
destination  asteroid is destroyed.  Thus you can launch further satellites
to the same asteroid without having to select the target again.

To  launch the satellite simply click on the LAUNCH button you will observe
the  satellite  leave the silo and head for the enemy asteroid.  You cannot
launch  another  satellite  from  the  same silo for several days since the
launch mechanism must be reset.

SENSOR REPORTS FROM SPY SATELLITES
----------------------------------

Once  a  spy  satellite  arrives  at  its destination it shields itself and
immediately  begins  to monitor the asteroid.  On the Asteroid Field Screen
you  will  see  a  small  blue  animation  indicating that the satellite is
operating normally.

A  satellite  provides  you with warnings of an enemy attack.  Normallv you
are only aware of the presence of enemy missiles and fleets when they enter
the range of your sensors.  If the satellite detects missiles leaving silos
on  the  asteroid it will immediately issue a missile Launch Detection.  It
will do a similar thing the moment it detects a Fleet leaving orbit.

This warning takes two forms.  On the Asteroid View Screen you will see the
missile  or  fleet  warning icons appear in the bottom left corner but with
the addition of the word Launch.  You will receive this warning even if the
enemy  asteroid  is  not  inside  your sensor range.  In this case you will
receive a Launch warning and then a short while later you will also receive
the usual warning when the fleet or missiles enter your sensor range.  Thus
a  satellite  can  warn  you of approaching danger long before your sensors
detect the threat.

The other visual indication is on the Asteroid Field Screen.

Once  you recieve a Launch Detect Warning you may need to know which of the
enemy  asteroids  has  launched the attack.  A flashing launch indicator (a
red  box)  surrounds the asteroid from which the launch was detected.  This
warning will disappear after a short while

Warning:   The  spy satellite is not infallible.  On rare occasions it will
fail  to detect a missile launch or fleet departure.  Do not over rely upon
your spy satellites!

SPY REPORTS FROM SPY SATELLITES
-------------------------------

At  any  time  you  can  interrogate  any of your spy satellites and obtain
immediate information about the asteroid it is orbiting.  To do so click on
the  SPY  button  from  the  Asteroid  View  Screen.   You are taken to the
Asteroid  Field Screen and asked to select the asteroid that interests you.
You  must  select  an  asteroid which has an orbiting spy satellite.  After
selecting the asteroid you gain access to the main Spying Screen.

There  are 8 categories of information listed on the screen and the cost of
obtaining that information.  At the top of the screen is the money you have
available  (The  Intelligence  Fund).   Always  ensure  you  have allocated
sufficient  money  to  the  Intelligence  Fund  before  entering the Spying
Screen.

To   obtain   information,  simply  click  on  the  chosen  category.   The
appropriate  cost will be deducted and a report will be issued.  Whilst you
remain in the Spying Screen, you can call up these reports as many times as
you  like  at  no  furthur  cost.   The categories are described below, but
remember  that  the information is not always accurate, since the enemy are
careful  to  encode  their transmissions and conceal their true plans.  For
peace  of  mind  interrogate your spy satelites on a regular basis, perhaps
annually.

Population
----------

This estimates the population on the asteroid

Missile Inventory
-----------------

This  estimates  the number of warheads stacked in their underground silos.
Since  their  technology  differs from ours the exact types of warheads are
not  given.   There  are three categories estimating the yield (destructive
power)  of  the  warheads.   A  fourth  category  marked  "Other" indicates
warheads of whose purpose we have no idea at this stage.

Number of Enemy Asteroids
-------------------------

This  estimates  the  number  of  asteroids  occupied  by the enemy and may
indicate that they occupy asteroids that we have not yet discovered.

Our Asteroids Known to Enemy
----------------------------

This  gives  a  list  of our asteroids that are known to the enemy.  It can
give  a  valuable  insight  into  where  they  are likely to attack or what
asteroids we need not defend since the enemy are unaware of their presence.

Building Inventory
------------------

This  provides  an  indication of the buildings observable on the asteroid.
There  are  categories  for  general  buildings, defensive buildings (maybe
Shield  Generators  or  Anti  Missile  Pods)  offensive  buildings (Turrets
Missile Silos etc) and power generating buildings.

Make Up of Deployed Fleet
-------------------------

If  you  have  been warned that this asteroid has recently deployed a fleet
you  can obtain an estimation of its size.  The report indicates the number
of ships and number of Battleships in the fleet.

Destination of Deployed Fleet
-----------------------------

If  you  have  been warned that this asteroid has recently deployed a fleet
you  can  determine  where  that  fleet  is  headed.   Clearly this is very
valuable information allowing you to prepare a welcoming surprise!

Destination of Missile Strike
-----------------------------

If  you have been warned that this asteroid has recently launched a missile
strike you can determine where those missiles are headed.

Remember  that  spying information can occasionally be in error.  Tetracorp
accepts  no  responsibility for the loss and damage caused by an inaccurate
or incomplete spy report.

LOSING SPY SATELLITES
---------------------

It  is  inevitable  that  the  enemy will detect our satellites and destrov
them.   The  longer  a  satellite orbits an enemy asteroid the greater this
chance  is.   The  satellite  can  also  betray  its presence each time you
request  specific  information  from  the  Spy  Screen so don`t ask for spy
information  too  regularly.  Better still dispatch more than one satellite
to the same enemy asteroid to provide a backup.


ZONE 005 : FLEETS
-----------------

A  convenient  method  of  controlling  ships is to place them into fleets.
Once joined together as a fleet ships can be easily ordered to move between
asteroids.   There  are  advantages  and  disadvantages  to using fleets as
opposed to controlling each ship individually.

The advantages are that you can dispatch an entire battle fleet by clicking
on  just  a  couple  of buttons.  It is also easier to group ships by their
type  so  that  you  know  where ships are and what they are supposed to be
doing.   There  are also some functions such as intercepting an approaching
enemy fleet, that can only be done using fleets.

The  disadvantages  are  that  you have less control over individual ships.
There  are  only  4  orders  you can give a fleet though they are powerful.
However  you  can always remove a ship from a fleet at any time if you want
it  to  perform  more  specialised duties.  Certain orders can only be done
using   individual   ship   control  such  as  colonisation,  exploring  or
prospecting.

JOINING A FLEET
---------------

There are two ways to group ships into a fleet:

a)  Use  the JOIN FLEET option from the Spacecraft Control Window.  See the
    appropriate section

b) Use the JOIN SHIPS button from the Fleet Control Window described below

In  general  it you are making a fleet for the first time it is best to use
method  b).  If you later want to add one or two ships to an existing fleet
you will usually use method a).

FLEET CONTROL WINDOW
--------------------

You can obtain the Fleet Control Window by one of 2 means:

a) Clicking on the Fleet button

b) Clicking on one of your fleet markers on the Asteroid Field Screen

You  can  control up to 8 fleets.  To obtain the details about any fleet or
to  create  a  new one, select the fleet number 1-8 by clicking on the PREV
and NEXT buttons.  The fleet number in the top right will alter.

If  the  Fleet  Listing Window is empty then this fleet does not yet exist.
If  it  does exist, there will be a listing of all the ships in the current
fleet and their current armour points.

To  create  a  fleet  or add ships to an existing fleet click on JOIN.  The
display  will  switch  to  the Ship Inventory Window.  This details all the
ships  in  orbit  around  the current asteroid but ONLY ships not currently
members  of  another  fleet.   All these ships are available to be added to
this fleet.  You cannot use this method to add hangered ships to the fleet:
to  do  that  you must use the Spacecraft Control Window and the JOIN FLEET
button.

To  select  one  or  more ships click the mouse button over the name of the
ship.   Click  right  to  select  one  ship  or left to de-select one ship.
Selected  ships  are  shown  by  green  blobs and non-selected ships by red
blobs.   You can quickly select more than one of a ship by holding down the
mouse  button.   The  numbers at the right remind you of how many ships you
have selected.

The ABORT button will de-select all selected ships.

The EXIT button will return you to the Fleet Control Window remembering the
ships you have selected These will be added to the fleet and will appear in
the  Fleet Listing Window.  These ships will switch to Patrol Mode orbiting
the asteroid until you issue an order to the fleet.

If  the  Fleet Listing fills its window then you can use the PAGE button to
flick between the various pages of the listing.  The current and total page
numbers appear in the top right of the window.

You  can  obtain  more  detailed  information  on  any ship in the fleet by
clicking  on  the  ship  in  the  Fleet Listing Window with the right mouse
button.   This  is useful if you forget the hardpoint assignments of any of
the ships in the fleet.

LEAVING A FLEET
---------------

There  are  two  ways  to force ships to leave a fleet, but remember that a
ship can only leave a fleet when the fleet is orbiting an asteroid not when
it is in space between asteroids.

a)  Simply issue new orders to the ship from the Spacecraft Control Window.
The ship will automatically leave the fleet to obey those orders.

b) Use the LEAVE button in the fleet Control Window:

First  you  must select which ship(s) you want to leave the fleet.  Do this
by  clicking  on those ships in the Fleet Listing Window.  Their names will
be  highlighted  in  a  different  colour  to show they have been selected.
Clicking  on  a highlighted ship will de-select it.  You can also de-select
all the highlighted ships by clicking on ABORT.

Then  click  on LEAVE and the highlighted ships will leave the fleet.  They
will  disappear  from  the Fleet Listing Window and enter Patrol Mode about
the current asteroid waiting for further orders.

FLEET TACTICS
-------------

There  are four orders or tactics that you can give a fleet.  These are the
large buttons on the fleet Control Screen

Move Fleet (Non-Hostile Move)

This is used to move an entire fleet to another asteroid.  You can only use
this  order  to  move a fleet to one of your asteroids or to an uninhabited
asteroid NOT an enemy asteroid.

Click  on  the MOVE FLEET tactic button.  You will be taken to the Asteroid
Field  Screen  where  you can select the destination asteroid with the left
mouse  button.  In the Fleet Control Window notice that the Destination has
been  entered  at  the  top of the window as well as a summary of the order
selected.

Click  on  Exit  and  the  fleet  will carry out the order.  The ships will
depart from the asteroid and then you can monitor the progress of the fleet
from  the  Asteroid  Field  Screen  where  the  fleet appears as a numbered
marker.

A  fleet using a non-hostile movement can move at a faster rate than one in
attack mode since it does not have to consider the possibility of an attack
whilst it is in transit.

Attack Asteroid (Hostile Move)

This  is  used to move an entire fleet to an enemy asteroid with the intent
of attacking it upon arrival.

Click  on  the  ATTACK  ASTEROID  tactic  button.  You will be taken to the
Asteroid  Field  Screen  where you can select the destination asteroid with
the  left  mouse  button  in  the  Fleet  Control  Window  notice  that the
Destination  has been entered at the top of the window as well as a summary
of the order selected.

Click  on  Exit  and  the  fleet  will carry out the order.  The ships will
depart from the asteroid and then you can monitor the progress of the fleet
from  the  Asteroid  Field  Screen  where  the  fleet appears as a numbered
marker.

A  fleet  using  hostile  movement  moves  slower than normal since it must
always be prepared for an enemy attack as it nears its destination.

When  the  fleet  arrives at the destination asteroid it will automatically
enter  an  attack  pattern.   Ships will either attack enemy ships or enemy
buildings  depending upon the hardpoint weapons at their disposal Since the
attack  Is automated you can dispatch several attack fleets and not have to
worry  about  them,  though  it  is  fun to watch your fleets devastate the
enemy.

Intercept Enemy Fleet

This  is used to send your fleet to attack an approaching enemy fleet.  The
purpose  of  this is to attempt to destroy or weaken the enemy fleet before
it can do damage to your asteroid.

Click  on  the  INTERCEPT  FLEET  tactic  button.  You will be taken to the
Asteroid  Field  Screen where you can select the destination fleet with the
left mouse button.  In the Fleet Control Window notice that the Destination
has been entered at the top of the window as well as a summary of the order
selected

Click  on  Exit  and  the  fleet  will carry out the order.  The ships will
depart from the asteroid and then you can monitor the progress of the fleet
from  the  Asteroid  Field  Screen  where  the  fleet appears as a numbered
marker.

Your  fleet  will  use hostile movement so it will move slower than normal.
When  your  fleet  arrives  at the enemy fleet it will engage it in combat.
The  two  fleets  will  automatically  fight  until one is destroyed or one
retreats.   On  the  Asteroid  Field  Screen you will see the fleet markers
(yours  and the enemies) flashing to indicate that they are in battle.  You
can  elect  to  watch the battle by clicking on the flashing fleet markers.
See the Space Combat Screen section for further details

Sentry Mode

This  is  used  to guard one of your asteroids.  Simply click on the SENTRY
MODE  button  and  then  EXIT.   Your  ships  will continue patrolling your
asteroid  as  if nothing has happened but they are in constant contact with
your  asterold  sensors.  As soon as an enemy fleet is detected heading for
the  current  asteroid  the fleet will enter Intercept Fleet Mode and go to
Intercept the enemy fleet (as above).  If it is successful in defeating the
enemy  it  will return to the asteroid and go back to Sentry Mode.  It will
continue  to  intercept  all approaching enemy fleets until you instruct it
otherwise or it is destroyed.

RETREAT THRESHOLDS
------------------

Each  fleet  has a retreat threshold which is normally 100%.  This reflects
the  amount  of  the original fleet which can be destroyed before the fleet
will abandon its attack and return to a friendly asteroid.

To  alter  the  retreat  threshold  simply click over the figure at the top
right of the Fleet Control Window.  Click the left mouse button to decrease
the figure by 10% or the right mouse button to increase it by 10%.

With  100%  the  fleet  will  never  retreat.   It  will  fight until it is
successful or all the ships in the fleet are destroyed.

With  0%,  the  fleet will retreat as soon as a single ship in the fleet is
destroyed.

SPACE COMBAT SCREEN
-------------------

When  two  fleets meet in space they will pause in their initial orders and
engage  in combat.  The battle will continue until either side is destroyed
or retreats.  The fleet icons on the Asteroid Field Screen will flash.  You
can watch the combat by clicking on the flashing icons.

On  the  Space  Combat  Screen  you  can view yours and the enemys fleet in
battle.   You  cannot examine your fleet listing but there are some buttons
available by clicking with the right mouse button anywhere on the screen.

           RETREAT       ASTEROID
           PAUSE         EXIT

RETREAT:  Enables you to force your fleet to retreat immediately

ASTEROID: Returns you to the Asteroid Field Screen

PAUSE:    Have we really got to explain this?

EXIT:     Returns you to the space battle


ZONE 006 : BUTTON SELECTION PANELS
----------------------------------

When the game is playing you can bring up a Button Panel by clicking on the
right  mouse  button.   A  Button Pane appropriate to the screen you are on
will appear.

Whilst  the Button Panel is in view the game is paused.  You can select any
of  the  buttons  by clicking on them using the left mouse button.  You can
only  select  buttons  from the Button Panel - any buttons elsewhere on the
screen are inactive until you exit the Button Panel.

This section summarises the major button panels.  Use it to locate a button
when  you  don`t  know  what  Button  Panel it is on.  Better still use the
Button Extraction technique explained later.

BUTTON EXTRACTION
-----------------

Most  likely you are finding it annoying accessing nested Button Panels all
the  time.   You  can  avoid  this  by customising the Asteroid View Screen
making  available  all  the  buttons  you  commonly use.  Note you can only
customise  the Asteroid View Screen and Orbit Screen NOT the Asteroid Field
Screen or any other screens.

When  any  Button  Panel  is  active you can pull out or extract any button
(except  the  Exit  button).   Click  the left mouse button over the chosen
button  and  keep the button held down until the button appears in the main
screen at the right or bottom edge.  Notice that the button function is NOT
carried out.

There  is  space  for 6 buttons up the right side of the screen and 8 along
the bottom.  No button may be duplicated.

It is well worth the time to extract your often used buttons since they are
now available at any time without you having to remember which Button Panel
to access.

You  can delete an extracted button from the screen by clicking and holding
in the same way as you extracted the button.

Your customised screen will be remembered if you save the game.

TIME SAVlNG TECHNIQUES
----------------------

Once you are familiar with the game you may wish to use these techniques to
speed up play.

Keyboard Short-cuts
-------------------

D   -   Toggles Demolish Mode on and off

S   -   Toggles between Normal (hand) mode and Ship Selection (arrow) Mode

SPACE Toggles between normal and Tactical mode on the Asteroid View Screen

Left and Right Arrows - Rotate the asteroid left or right 90 degrees

QuickView
---------

If  you  are  managing  several  asteroids and maybe know about a couple of
enemy  asteroids as well it can be very time consuming if you are switching
between them frequently.

When  you  click  on  the  QuickView  button you are given a listing of the
definitions  of the 10 function keys F1 to F1O.  You can define an asteroid
to  any  of the function keys.  Then simply pressing that function key will
take  you  to  the  Asteroid  View Screen.  For that asteroid from whatever
screen you were previously on.

To  define  a function key click on the line in the listing from F1 to F10.
Then click on any asteroid with the left mouse button.  The function key is
now defined.  You can redefine it at any stage by the same method.

The listing is colour coded;

Green       - asteroid owned by you
Red         - asteroid owned by enemy
Orange      - uninhabited asteroid

With  several  function  keys defined you can browse through asteroids very
quickly.

Select Building
---------------

You  may  discover  that there is a subset of buildings that you are always
building  when  you  colonise a new asteroid, and that it takes a long time
choosing  them all from the Engineering Window.  You can program the keys 1
to  9  to specific buildings then to select one of those buildings you just
press 1-9 instead of accessing the Engineering Window.

In  the  Engineering Window you may have noticed numbers in brackets at the
top  left  of some buildings eg the Living Quarters.  These are the default
definitions of the keys 1-9.

To  program  any  building  to  a key 1-9 simply locate the building in the
Engineering  Window  and  press the key 1-9.  The number will appear at top
left  and  that  building is now programmed.  You can redefine a number key
1-9 by the same method.

It is well worth taking time to define the keys 1-9.  Your definitions will
be remembered if you save the game.

As  well  as selecting a programmed building using the kevs 1-9 you can use
the  Blue  Button  situated  under  the  building icon on the Asteroid View
Screen.   Each  click  on the Blue Button will select one of the programmed
buildings 1-9.

You  can  in  fact have a tenth programmed building because key 0 is alwavs
defined  as  the  last  building  selected  by  from the Engineering Window
itself,  it will of course change every time you select a new building from
the Engineering Window.

included in the cost presented to you in the game.

You can access the Sci-Tek database from the Sci-Tek button.  In some cases
the   database  may  take  a  few  seconds  to  access  even  via  hi-speed
communication devices.

From  the database you can peruse Sci-Teks catalogue and opt to buy as many
blueprints  as  you  desire.  All purchased blueprints will be delivered to
you  on  the  next scheduled Imperial Ore Carrier and are NOT available for
construction until then.

On  the  database screen you are shown one device at a time.  At the bottom
of the screen is the command line:

          PREV        NEXT     PURCHASE     CLEAR      END

Use PREV and NEXT to cycle through the catalogue.  Click on PURCHASE to buy
the  displayed  blueprint,  or  CLEAR to change your mind.  Clicking on END
will break the communication link with Sci-Tek and order any blueprints you
have purchased.

Note:   The money available to you is the funds you have in the Basic Money
section  of  your  Financial  Funds (See appropriate secton) You cannot use
money  allocated to Construction, Vehicles, Intelligence or Missiles unless
you remove money from those funds prior to accessing Sci-Tek.

GAMEPLAY TIPS

K240  is  an  open ended game - there is no one way to win.  These notes do
not  necessarily  represent  the  best  way to play K240 they only serve to
offer some assistance if you have no idea what you should be doing next.

When  you  begin  the  game  spend about 50% of your money building up your
first asteroid.  Build Mines, Stores, Power generation buildings, a Command
Centre,  Sensor  Array,  Ship Construction Yard, Landing Pad, buildings for
producing air, food and water and any other buildings that take your fancy.
Dont worry about military defences just yet.

Once your asteroid is a mass of scaffolding take the time to have a look at
the  Asteroid  Field Screen to see where you are and whether you know about
any other asteroids yet.

It  is  often  a  good  idea  to enter into communications with Sci-Tek and
purchase  one  or two cheap devices.  A Gravity Nullifier is well worth the
investment  at this stage (assuming of course one has not been supplied for
you  by  Tetracorp).   Once  you  begin  to discover asteroids you may find
several of them on a collision course with your main asteroid and it may be
too  late  then to purchase a Gravity Nullifier and wait for its arrival on
the Imperial Ore Carrier.

Your colony should now be producing ore nicely.  Your immediate concern now
is  to  expand onto other asteroids.  You need to build some Scout Ships so
get your Ship Construction Yard building a couple of Scouts.  They shouldnt
take long.

If  you  have  already  discovered  some  other  asteroids  you may wish to
dispatch  your new Scouts on a Prospecting mission to see how rich they are
in  ores.  If your sensors are looking bare send the Scouts out with orders
to Explore.

Once  you  have  discovered  a few other asteroids and obtained Ore Reports
about  them,  you  are  in  a position to decide which asteroid to colonise
first.   Pick  the  one with most ore deposits, particulary the rarer ores.
If  you have discovered any send your Transporter ship off to colonise that
asteroid.   When  the  new  colony  has  been established (the CPU has been
built) you are in the position to expand that colony too building Mines and
Stores etc.

There  is  usually  a phase where you run severely short of money so try to
spend  it  wisely.  Dont spread yourself across too many asteroids at once,
dont  invest  in unnecessary luxuries from Sci-Tek yet and ensure you build
the most important buildings first, whilst you have the money.  There is no
point  in  having  20  Mines  on  an  asteroid if they have no power or the
employees  are  dying from radiation because you can`t afford any Radiation
Filters.

Once you have sold several shipments of ore to the Imperial Ore Carrier the
situation  should  improve  It is now worth your while beginning to build a
small fleet and lay down a few defences on your asteroids preparing for the
time when you discover the enemy or they discover you.

Maintain a balance.  Keep all of your colonies growing slowly.  Keep mining
at  all  costs.   As  you  deplete an asteroids reserves colonise and begin
mining  a  new  asteroid.   Build a few ships and put them into a defensive
fleet.   Maybe  build a few missiles.  Purchase a few devices from Sci-Tek.
Everything in moderation.

When  you finally discover the enemy start spying at once to gather all the
information you can about him.  You may well need different tactics against
each Alien.

End Of Part One...
