MILITARY STRATEGY
-----------------

Not  too  many clues here!  Until you discover the weaknesses and strengths
of  each  Alien,  maintain  a varied defence.  If it appears that the enemy
concentrate  on  missile strikes build plenty of Anti-Missile Pods.  If you
are  constantly  plagued  by  enemy attack fleets maintain a strong defence
fleet  which  can  intercept  the  enemy  fleet  as soon as it is detected.
Protect your colonies with gun turrets and Screen Generators.

Your attack tactics will also depend upon what you discover about the enemy
and how they react when they are attacked.  Sometimes it is better to build
large  and  strong  attack  fleets  and  back  them up with regular missile
strikes.   Other  times  regular  attacks  by  small skirmish fleets may be
enough to keep the enemy at bay whilst you plan something special for them!
Examine the enemy defences carefully before you attack.

Dont  leave it too long in the game before constructing a Space Dock.  This
will allow you to buy the blueprints for the Terminator and Battleship from
Sci-Tek and to add them to your fleet.

One  last  tip:   Watch  where the enemy attacks carefully.  It is possible
that  he  does  not know about all your asteroids and attacks the same ones
over  and over.  If you think this is the case use the undetected asteroids
for the bulk of your mining and ship production whilst they are safe.

ZONE 009 : BACKGROUND
---------------------

THE EMPIRE
----------

The  Terran Empire governs a vast area of space, a sphere approximately 300
light years in radius with Earth at its centre.  Over 1000 worlds have been
inhabited  and  are  home  to  countless  billions  of  humans  and a minor
population of alien races discovered during the great expansion in the 23rd
century.

The  Empire came into unofficial existence in the year 2215 when command of
the  homeworlds  (the  most  densely populated worlds nearest to Earth) was
seized  by  the  Commander  of  the Fleet Parillo, during the 5 year war at
Deneb  Markab.   Several  years  of  uncertainty  followed  but most worlds
quickly  offered  their  support  for  Parillo  when he began his Expansion
Policy; promising to push out in search of new worlds to ease overcrowding.
By  2250  he  had discovered and opened up many new worlds for colonisation
and  established  the Industrial Worlds so called because they concentrated
industry  away  from  population  areas  and maximised productivity.  These
advances led to Parillo being formally declared Emperor in the year 2253.

Upon  his  death  in  2274  title  of  Emperor  passed to his son Marcissus
Parillos policies were continued but his xenophobic nature led to many wars
with newly discovered alien races, many of them highly advanced and capable
of inflicting serious damage upon the Imperial Fleet.  The Decade of Terror
came  about  in 2294 when the Tharmaxlons declared war on the Empire.  In a
few  short years they opened a great gash in the side of the Empire nearest
their  homeworlds  in the Capella Sector.  In 2301 they penetrated right to
the  heart  of  the Empire and attacked and destroyed the Industrial Worlds
orbiting  Beta  Hydrae.  Marcissus was blamed for his refusal to enter into
peace  negotiations  with  the  aliens.   That  and  the hatred of even the
friendly  alien  minorities  in  the  Empire for his open racism led to his
being deposed as Emporer in 2303.

Lynn  Salaria,  Marcissus  daughter and greatest critic was crowned Empress
that  very  year.   Her first act was to push back the Tharmaxions with all
the  Imperial  might  and  then  negotiated  treaty  with  them  which  was
incidentally  very  preferential to the Terran Empire, Peace and prosperity
returned  and  she  is  Empress  to this day (the year 2380), though she is
expected to abdicate in favour of her eldest son at any moment.

SCI-TEK
-------

Under  the  prosperity  established  by  Parillo  and  later Marcissus many
companies  grew to immense size and profitability especialiy those directly
linked to the Expansion Policy.  One such company was Sci-Tek.

Sci-Tek  was  founded  in 2309 after decades of research into gravitational
theory.   It's  first products were the much acclaimed Asteroid Engines and
Gravity Nuilifier:  allowing complete control of an asteroid independent of
the   gravitational  influence  of  other  space  objects  Countless  other
corporations  bought  the  devices providing Sci-Tek with enough capital to
channel more money towards R&D.

Within  ten  years  it led the way in the design and manufacture of obscure
but useful devices and facilities.  However its legal departments proved as
cunning  and  resourceful as their technicians.  They devised an incredibly
complicated  licensing  agreement whereby its clients could buy the license
rights  to  the  design  blueprints  for  a  particular Sci-Tek product and
manufacture  it  themselves.   The results were phenomenal as were Sci-Teks
profits.   Other  corporations  preferred  to  use  their own manufacturing
facilities  and  this  allowed  Sci-Tek  to  phase out their own industrial
plants  and  concentrate  purely  on development.  They could put all their
resources  into developing a larger product line.  Surpisingly, no loophole
has  been found in Sci-Teks license agreement and as a result none of their
designs  have  been stolen.  In the few cases where a client has broken the
license  agreement the Imperial Administrator himself has stepped in favour
of Sci-Tek

TETRACORP
---------

Another,  larger,  Imperial  company  is  Tetracorp.   It  began  in  2221,
manufacturing  scout  ships  and  sensory equipment for the Imperial Fleet.
Its assets grew and it soon realised the potential of space exploration and
asteroid  mining.   It  began  developing new techniques for extracting and
transporting  rare  ores  mined  in  the  depths  of  space  which  were so
successful  that  by  the year 2280 it had grown to own and fill the entire
Industrial World of Barnard Five.

By  the  middle  of  the  24th century it had cornered the market in mining
franchises.   Having  manufactured  superior  mining  equipment and support
ships.  It offered packages to anyone with the ambition to take over one of
the  asteroid  fields  being  discovered  every year on the frontier of the
Empire  (known  as  the  Fragmented  Sectors).   It  would  provide all the
equipment  and support required to establish one or more mining colonies on
these  ore  rich  asteroids.   In  return  for a degree of control over the
colonies  and  full  rights  to purchase all ore mined at standard Imperial
prices.

THE FRAGMENTED SECTORS
----------------------

As  expansion  continued  in  search  of habitable worlds and resources the
exploration  fleets  began to discover an increasing amount of star systems
whose  planets had been torn apart to produce huge asteroid fields orbiting
the star.  The cause of this widespread destruction in so many star systems
is unknown but it proved incredible good fortune for Tetracorp.  The fields
of  asteroids  made  it far easier to extract the valuable ores and several
new  and  phenomenally  valuable  ores  were discovered such as Traxium and
Nexos.

K240
----

In  the  year  2380,  Sector  K240  was  made available for colonisation by
Tetracorp.   K240  is  one  of the Fragmented Sector and occupies a cube of
space  50  light  years  across.   As a Tetracorp franchise holder you have
claimed  a section of K240 and are ready to begin your mining operations in
the asteroid fields Good luck!

TERRAN  APPROVED:   2450  THE  FOLLOWING SECTION IS FOR THOSE WITH SECURITY
CLEARANCE BLUE AND ABOVE ONLY.


ZONE 010 : BUILDING REFERENCE SECTION
-------------------------------------

This section describes each building available and its features and purpose
in  the  game.   Some  are  unavailable at the start of the game but can be
purchased from Sci-Tek.  These are marked as (Blueprint).

Note:   This  data is accurate at the present time but is subject to change
without warning, as manufacturing techniques improve.

Anti-Missile Pod (blueprint)
----------------------------

Cost:   7000 Cr
Power:  3 MW/day
Time:   36 days

These  are  your  major  defence  against  incoming  enemy  missiles.  They
automatically  detect  enemy missiles and target them though their accuracy
is low.  To improve accuracy build several

Asteroid Engines (blueprint)
----------------------------

Cost:    45000 Cr
Power:   0-5 MW /day depending upon speed
Time:    64 days

This is a phenomenally advanced facility that provides the means to control
the gravitational field of the asteroid enabling it to change direction and
speed any time you want

When you click on the building a control window appears:

The  current  direction and speed of the asteroid is shown.  To alter speed
click  on  the  right  arrow  button  (increase)  or  the left arrow button
(decrease).   A  speed  of  zero  indicates  that  the asteroid will remain
stationary.

To  alter  the  direction  click  on  any  of the yellow dots in the circle
surrounding the asteroid.

If  the  Engines  run  out  of  power  the  speed will drop to zero and the
asteroid  will  no longer move.  Power is essential to maintain the gravity
field that moves the asteroid.

Colony Preservation Unit
------------------------

Cost:    30000 Cr to start a new colony
Power:   none
Time:    40 days

This  building  can  only  be  built  when  beginning  a  new  colony on an
uninhabited  asteroid.  (See the section on Colonising New Asteroids).  The
Transporter  ship  will  automatically construct one when it arrives at the
new asteroid provided enough funds are available.

The  purpose  of the CPU is to establish a minimum survival colony allowing
you  time  to  construct.  Further more specific buildings.  To this end it
provides:

          Living space for 100 employees
          8 MW/day of power
          300 units of air per day
          250 units of food per day
          250 units of water per day

In addition it has storage capacity for:

          1000 air units 
          1000 food units
          1000 water units 
          50MW of power.

The facilities at the CPU will degenerate over time since it is meant to be
phased  out  when you have your colony up and running.  Because of this all
production  of  air, water and food (NOT power) will decrease by 1 unit/day
until  they  reach  zero.  Thus the CPU cannot sustain a colony after about
250 days.

Command Centre
--------------

Cost:     8000 Cr
Power:    3 MW/day
Time:     32 days

This is a very important building and you are advised to have more than one
amongst  your  asteroids.   A  Command  Centre  can  control  any number of
colonies  therefore  its  exact location is unimportant.  It makes all your
asteroids run more smoothly and also offers specific functions when clicked
upon.  These are:

a)  A  window  appears listing the prices at which the Imperial Home Worlds
will  buy your mined ore.  Sometimes the Empire will guarantee prices for a
number of years for a paticular ore type that it needs badly.  In this case
the  letter  "H" will appear after the ore price to indicate that the price
has been held.  The number after the "H" indicates the number of years that
the  price  is  held  for.   This  window also indicates the number of days
before the next Imperial Ore Carrier arrives at your colony.

b) By clicking on the Space Dock button you have the option to construct an
orbiting  Space  Dock  around  the current asteroid.  See the section about
Space Docks.

c)  By clicking on the Ship Button you can obtain a list of the location of
all your Transporter ships whether they are around an asteroid or in space.
Use this to manage your transporters more effectively.

Note:   You  will  be  unable  to  command  any fleets without at least one
Command Centre.

Construction Yard
-----------------

Cost:   7500 Cr
Power:  2 MW/day
Time:   32 Days

This  large  building extends underground into huge caverns (accessible via
the  Landing  Pads).  you can construct the smaller spacecraft in the yard,
namely Assault Fighters, Combat Eagle, and Scout Ships.

When  ships  are  constructed they are left in the underground hangers.  To
issue orders to the hangered ships, click on the Landing Pads.

Clicking  on this building allows you to construct ships or obtain a status
report  of  ships  currently  under  construction.   Full  details  on ship
construction are given elsewhere.

Decontamination Filter
---------------------

Cost:   8000 Cr
Power:  3 MW/Day
Time:   36 Days

The  background  radiation  on  some  asteroids  is  high  causing employee
sickness  which  leads  to  loss  of  production.   The Company advises the
construction  of  one or more of these Filters which offer a screen against
the  heavier  radioactive  particles protecting the employees inside colony
buildings.

Deep Bore Mine
--------------

Cost:   5500 Cr
Power:  2 MW/Day
Time:   36 Days

This  is  a sophisticated mining drill for locating and extracting the more
valuable Ores.  It can extract:

    Quazinc
    Bytanium
    Korellium
    Dragonium

All mined ores are sent directly to Stores.

Environmental Control
---------------------

Cost:     3200 Cr
Power:    none
Time:     20 Days

This  facility  primarily  stores surplus environment commodities for later
use.   Each building can store up to 5000 air units, 600 food units and 600
water   units.   It  also  monitors  the  usage  and  production  of  these
environment commodities to provide an uninterrupted supply in every section
of your colony.

Clicking on this building will access the Colony Summary window.

Protected Environmental Control
-------------------------------

Cost:   8500 Cr
Power:  3 MW/Day
Time:   32 Days

This  is an extension to the normal building, with an integral Laser Turret
for  colony  defence.   Bearing  in  mind  the  importance of environmental
control, it would seem prudent to protect it.

Clicking on this building will access the Colony Summary window.

Gravity Nullifier (blueprint)
-----------------------------

Cost:   35000 Cr
Power:  4 MW/day if on
Time:   52 days

It  can  take  considerable time to monitor the movements of your asteroids
and  those  nearby  and  collisions  are  a constant danger.  The Nullifier
generates  a  gravitational field that stops all asteroids within a certain
range  from moving including the one the Nullifier is built on.  As long as
the  field  is active you don`t have to worry about collisions, however any
asteroid using Asteroid Engines will be unaffected by the field.  Note that
the  field  will  collapse  if  you  have  insufficient  power to drive the
Nullifier so regular checks on it`s operational status should be maintained

Clicking on the Nullifier gives the option of turning the field on or off.

Hydration Plant
---------------

Cost:    5000 Cr
Power:   1 MW/day
Time:    20 days

These buildings provide essential water for your employees.  Each hydration
plant  provides  water  for  up to 500 employees.  A very efficiet chemical
process is used to extract water and oxygen from ice crystrals trapped deep
within  the asteroid.  Surplus water will be stored in Environmental Stores
if you have any.

Clicking on this building will access the Colony Summary window

Hydroponics
-----------

Cost:     7000 Cr
Power:    2 MW/day
Time:     16 days

These  buildings  provide  essential  food  for  your  employees.  Each one
provides  food  for  up to 400 workers which is grown from a slurry tank of
algae  fed  with  concentrated nutrients.  It sounds inedible but the basic
slurry  can be moulded into any foodstuff (In tests it was found that 8 out
of  10 employees could not tell the difference and the drastic reduction in
cost  when compared to fresh food has made these units a Company Favourite)
Surplus food will be stored in Environmental Stores should you have any.

Clicking on this building will access the Colony Summary window.

Landing Pad
-----------

Cost:    300 Cr
Power:   none
Time:    16 days

These  are  the  access  points  for  ships  to  enter  and  leave the vast
underground  hangers.  It is advisable to leave unused ships in the hangers
as  this  keeps them safe from enemy attack and enables damaged ships to be
repaired.

Landing  Pads  cannot  be built too close to the edge of the asteroid where
the rock is at its thinnest.

Clicking  on  a  Landing  Pad displays a list of all ships currently in the
hangers  or  orbiting the current asteroid.  You may issue orders to one or
more  of  these  ships  from here.  For more information see the section on
Controlling Ships elsewhere in this manual.

Laser Turret
------------

Cost:    3400 Cr
Power:   2 MW/day
Time:    24 days

This low powered weapon offers defence against attack by enemy ship(s).  It
will automatically track and fire upon any enemy ship(s) around the current
asteroid assuming it has sufficient power.

Life Support
------------

Cost:    13000 Cr
Power:   2 MW/day
Time:    48 Days

This  building  provides  vital  air and atmospheric control throughout the
colony  buildings.   Each  life  support  module  can generate a breathable
environment  for  up  to  500  employees.  A revolutionary (and top secret)
chemical  process  is used to extract Hydrogen Oxygen and the various Noble
gasses trapped within the asteroid and render them breathable.  Surplus air
will be stored in the Environmental Stores if you have any.

Clicking on this building will access the Colony Summary window

Living Quarters
---------------

Cost:    1000 Cr
Power:   none
Time:    32 Days

The  basic  support  building  for  employees  in  the colony.  Much of the
building is underground and has adequate facilities for about 50.  They are
quick to construct but very susceptible to damage from attack.

Clicking on this building will access the Colony Summary window

Medical Centre
--------------

Cost:   5000 Cr
Power:  1 MW/Day
Time:   30 Days

This is a state of the art facility incorporating all the medical equipment
and  staff  you`d  expect  to  find  in  a major planetary Hospital.  It is
capable  of  supporting  a  colony  of  up  to 100 employees, handling both
routine  and  emergency  medical care.  It is unwise to have a large colony
without  at  least one Medical Centre.  Having one improves employee morale
and  health  and in addition lowers the number of fatalities through mining
accidents.   It  is  also invaluable in the rare cases when a virus spreads
rapidly through the close confinement of a mining colony and can also offer
treatment for low doses of radiation

Mine
----

Cost:   4000 Cr
Power:  1 MW/Day
Time:   32 Days

The  basic  mining  drill for extracting the commoner types of ore.  It can
extract:

      Selenium              Asteros

      Barium                Crystalite

All mined ores are sent  directly to Stores

Missile Silo
------------

Cost:   4300 Cr
Power:  none
Time:   32 Days

All  your missiles are constructed and launched from these silos.  For full
details  about  Missiles  see  the  appropriate  section  elsewhere in this
manual.

Each asteroid has underground caverns capable of storing 10 of each type of
missile,  a  total  of 110 missiles.  Obviously no matter how many missiles
you  have  in storage you cannot launch them without a silo.  The advantage
of multiple silos is that your launch rate is far greater.

Clicking  on  a  silo  brings  up the Missile Construction Window where you
select  which missiles to build.  Launching missiles is done by clicking on
the  Missile  Button (See the section on Missiles for details of both these
operations)

Ore Teleporter (blueprint)
--------------------------

Cost:   45000 Cr
Power:  1 MW/Day
Time:   48 Day

This  is  a  very  effective  and  swift means of transporting ores between
asteroids  you  must  have  an ore transporter on both of the asteroids you
want  to  move  ore  between.   For  best  results  install one on all your
asteroids.

To teleport some ore, click on the Ore Teleport on the asteroid you want to
move ore FROM.

A  window  appears  listing  all  the  ore  available in the Stores on this
asteroid both in bar chart form and numerical form

You  cannot  do  anything until you select the destination asteroid.  To do
so,  click on the asteroid button.  You will be taken to the Asteroid Field
screen  where you can move the cross hair over the destination asteroid and
click with the left mouse button you must of course select an asteroid that
is owned by you and that contains an Ore Teleporter.

After  selecting  the  destination you will be returned to the Ore teleport
window where you will now see the contents of the stores on the destination
asteroid (The second column of figures).

To teleport ore simply drag the bar charts either left or right (similar to
the  means  explained  earlier  in  the  manual) and Ore will be teleported
instantaneously between the asteroids.

To  teleport  from  the  current  asteroid  to the destination drag the bar
charts to the right.

To  teleport  from  the  destination  to  the current asteroid drag the bar
charts to the left.

Plasma Turret (blueprint)
-------------------------

Cost:     5500 Cr
Power:    3 MW /day
Time:     30 days

This  weapon  offers greater fire power than the standard Laser Turret.  It
automatically  tracks  and  fires  upon  any enemy ships around the current
asteroid providing it has sufficient power.

Photon Turret (blueprint)
-------------------------

Cost:     7500 Cr
Power:    5 MW /day
Time:     52 days

This  weapon offers the greatest fire power of the three turret types.  The
Photon  Turrets  power and accurracy is beyond compare and is only rivalled
by  some  of the larger intergalactic warships.  Having sold this however a
warship  moves  pretty  damn fast whereas a turret is rooted to the spot as
you  would  expect.   It  too automatically tracks and fires upon any enemy
ships around the current asteroid providing it has sufficient power.

Powerplant (blueprint)
----------------------

Cost:    10000 Cr
Power:   variable
Time:    40 days

This  is  the major means of power generation upon your asteroids.  It is a
large  and  complicated  building to construct but it offers superior power
generation.   It  extracts  Asteros ore direct from the asteroid and uses a
fusion process to turn it into a daily output of 32 MW.  Ensure you have an
adequate supply of Asteros before construction since it uses 1 Asteros unit
every 4 days.

If there is an ample supply of Asteros it will generate 32 MW/day otherwise
it will use less ores to give a much reduced output of 8MW/day.

Clicking  on  this  building  brings  up  a list of all buildings currently
without power if any.

Power Store
-----------

Cost:    1500 Cr
Power:   none
Time:    32 days

Unused  surplus power is channelled into these for later use.  They offer a
good  backup in the rarer cases where you may temporarily lose some of your
power  generation  buildings, perhaps during an enemy attack.  They will at
least prevent you from being totally out of power for a short while.

Each one has a capacity of 200 MW of power.

Clicking  on  this  building  brings  up  a list of all buildings currently
without power if any.

Repair Facility (blueprint)
---------------------------

Cost:    20000 Cr
Power:   none
Time:    36 days

Colony  buildings get damaged in the harsh environment of the mining colony
especially  during enemy attacks, Normally there are insufficient resources
to  affect  repajrs.   This building controls a fleet of repair robots that
routinely move about the colony and undertake building repairs.

Resiblock
---------

Cost:   3000 Cr
Power:  2 MW/Day
Time:   48 Days

This  is  a  more  advanced  support building, offering more facilities for
employees  especially  in  the way of entertiainment and leisure.  It takes
longer  to  construct  than  the  basic  Living  quarters  but supports 150
employees and is more space efficient.

Clicking on this building will access the Colony Summary window

Protected Resiblock
-------------------

Cost:   8500 Cr
Power:  5 MW/Day
Time:   56 Days

The  standard resiblock is now protected by an integral Laser Turret giving
better  protection  from  enemy  attack  and subsequently safeguarding your
workforce.

Clicking on this building will access the Colony Summary window

Satellite Silo
--------------

Cost:   5000 Cr
Power:  none
Time:   24 Days

Gathering  intelligence about the enemy requires the frequent launch of spy
satellites.  Satellites are both constructed and launched from these silos.
For details see the section on spying.

Screen Generator (blueprint)
----------------------------

Cost:   20000 Cr
Power:  7 MW/Day if on
Time:   52 Days

Most  buildings  have very little defence against damage from enemy attacks
and  are  easily  damaged  or  destroyed.  A screen generator uses power to
erect  a  force  screen  over  one  or  more  buildings  to  offer  greater
protection.

To  identify  the  area of effect of a screen (an asteroid can have several
Screen  Generators)  select Tactical Mode on the main asteroid view screen.
All buildings shown with a white square are protected.

Security Centre
---------------

Cost:   4500 Cr
Power:  2 Mw/Day
Time:   24 Days

The  Company believes in high pay for hard work but sometimes the employees
forget  this  and  become  slack  or  troubled  by the long shifts and hard
dangerous work.  It is inevitable that there will be regular rebellions and
standoffs  between  the  management  and  the workers and this is where the
highly  trained  security  team  steps  in.   They  possess  the  power  to
discipline  employees  fine  them,  and  imprison  them if necessary.  More
importantly  they also have guns.  It is wise to have a Security Centre for
about every 50 employees to prevent criminal activities taking a foothold.

Clicking on this building will access the Colony Summary window

Seismic Penetrator (blueprint)
------------------------------

Cost:    26500 Cr
Power:   3 MW/Day
Time:    42 Days

This  is  the  very latest mining equipment recently introduced by Sci-Tek.
It  takes  more  asteroid  space  and  power than conventional Mines but is
capable of extracting very valuable ores.  It can extract:

                    Traxium and Nexos

All mined ores are sent directly to Stores.

Sensor Array
------------

Cost:    3500 Cr
Power:   2 MW/day
Time:    36 days

Without  a  sensor  array  an asteroid has a very small sensor range.  (The
small  black circle on the Asteroid Field screen).  The array improves this
range  (increases  the  circle)  and  gives  better  warning of enemy fleet
movements.

Whenever  enemy  missiles  or  an  enemy fleet enters sensor range you will
receive  an  on  screen  (and  audible) warning.  In the bottom left of the
screen  one  or more icons will flash.  A missile inside a circle indicates
the presence of missiles and a ship inside a circle indicates the detection
of  a fleet.  The Asteroid Field Screen will indicate their position as red
dots (for Missiles) or a red logo (for fleets).  For as long as these icons
flash you are in danger!

Protected Storage Tower
-----------------------

Cost:    7500 Cr
Power:   4 MW/Day
Time:    48 Days

This  is  an  improved  design  of  the Storage Tower with an inbuilt Laser
Turret  to  fend  off  unwelcome visitors.  It should be noted that all ore
storage devices will be prime targets for enemy attacks, as they are one of
the  prime  requisites  of  any  colony.   It  would therefore seem wise to
protect  them.   This is done by putting a huge fake plastic gun on the top
and  a  fairly  pathetic real lasser turret inside it.  This is in the vain
hope  that any attacking fleet will see the fake weapon and decide they are
outgunned.   The  reality of course is that they see the tiny laser that it
fires and think oh its another one of those realistic plastic guns I`m off.
Honest.  Don`t delay buy one today.

This  is  a computer controlled multi-headed drill assembly for use on Deep
Bore Mines.  It will automatically be added to your existing shafts and all
those  built in the future.  It doubles the speed at which a Deep Bore Mine
can extract ore.

Anti-Missile Pod
----------------

Cost:   250000 Cr

This  is  a  powerful  addition  to  your asteroid defences.  The pods will
detect  and  track  any incoming enemy missiles and attempt to destroy them
harmlessly  in  flight.   The  pod  accuracy  is low but can be improved by
building several pods on each asteroid.

Anti-Virus Missile
------------------

Cost:   100000 Cr

This  warhead  is  the  only  known means of halting the effects of a Virus
missile launched against one of your asteroids, For further details see the
description of this warhead in the Missiles section.

Asteroid Engines
----------------

Cost:   190000 Cr

Engines  allow you full control over the direction and speed of an asteroid
enabling  you  to  steer  it  clear  of collisions or even just position it
exactly  where  you want it in space.  For full details see the description
in the Buildings section.

Asteroid Tracker
----------------

Cost:    40000 Cr

This  powerful  computer  works in conjunction with your sensors to analyse
the movement of all known asteroids.  It provides data on the direction and
speed of each asteroid, enabling you to anticipate collisions.

Once  you  have  the  blueprint  you  must  activate  the computer from the
Asteroid  Field  Screen  Bring up the button panel and click on the Display
Modes  button.   Two  new  buttons  have  now appeared in the Display Modes
button panel:

      PATHS          SPEEDS           PAFW           EXIT

The  PATHS button toggles on or off the display of asteroid paths.  Once on
the Asteroid Field Screen will display the path of an asteroid with a green
dotted  line.   It  will  always  show  the  path  of  the current asteroid
(providing it is actually moving) and will temporarily show the path of any
asteroid  you  move  the cross hair over.  You can therefore quickly get an
idea of the direction of all the asteroids.

The  SPEEDS  button toggles on or off the display of asteroid speeds.  Once
on,  the  Asteroid  Field Screen will display the speed of an asteroid as a
number  next  to it.  It will always show the speed of the current asteroid
and will temporarily show the speed of any asteroid you move the cross hair
over.   You can quickly get an idea of the speeds of all the asteroids.  If
the  speed  is  shown  in  red then that asteroid is caught in some kind of
gravity nullifying field and is not currently moving.  The number indicates
its speed should it escape the nullifying field.

Building Armour
---------------

Cost:    110000 Cr

You have purchased the rights to a strengthened construction material.  You
can  use this in all new buildings you construct making them more resilient
to enemy attacks.

Construction Droids
-------------------

Cost:   20000 Cr

Usually  your  Vehicle  Construction  Yards  only  have  the  resources  to
manufacture up to 3 craft at a time.  Once you have this blueprint all your
yards  and  all future yards will be modified to include a state of the art
robotic  assembly  line.   The sophistication of these droids allows you to
construct  up  to  6 craft at a time.  You can now build larger fleets with
less of your time spent supervising the Yards.

Deflector
--------

Cost:   115000 Cr

This is a hardpoint that can be added to newly constructed ships to improve
their  defence.   It consists of a generator that pulses energy through the
ships  hull  all  the  time  that it is in flight using power from the main
engines.   The  energised  hull is more resilient to attacks and can absorb
and  deflect most attacks.  The Deflector can be used with existing shields
and greatly improves the lifetime of a ship.

Fleet Battleship
----------------

Cost:   150000 Cr

One  of  the  most  powerful  ships  produced  in  the  Empire.  Using this
blueprint  you  can  construct  these battleships at any asteroid where you
have  a  Space  Dock.   For  further  details  see  the  description in the
Spacecraft section

Gravity Nullifier
-----------------

Cost:    70000 Cr

The  Nullifier  generates a powerful gravity field about the asteroid it is
built  upon.   This  prevents the asteroid and close neighbouring asteroids
from  moving.   This is particularly useful to avoid asteroid collisions or
simply  to  hold  several  of  your  asteroids  together for quick movement
between  them.   For  further  details see the description in the Buildings
section.

Hi-Energy Power Stores
----------------------

Cost:   15000 Cr

This specialised capacitance circuit is automatically installed in all your
existing  Power  Stores  and  any built from now on.  It simply doubles the
storage capacity of all Power Stores.

Improved Sensors
----------------

Cost:   34000 Cr

Sci-Tek have recognised the reliance most asteroid mining colonies put upon
their  Sensor  Arrays  Without  them  an  asteroid is very vulnerable to an
unexpected  collision  or  surprise enemy attack.  They have developed this
device  that  is installed in all your existing asteroids and also added to
the  CPU building so that all future colonies will have this device also it
renders  Sensor  Arrays  unnecessary  by hiding the sensors underground and
using new techniques to allow them to probe surrounding space

MEGA Missile
------------

Cost:   500000 Cr

Incredibly  expensive  but  then you are buying the most powerful weapon in
the  Empire  capable  of  destroying  an  entire asteroid upon impact.  For
further details see the summary of this warhead in the Missiles section.

Missile Bay Extension
---------------------

Cost:   30000 Cr

Conventional  missile  Silos can only store a maximum of 10 of each type of
warhead  on  an asteroid.  If they are to be loaded and launched as quickly
as  possible.   This  new  loading  rack  system  is  installed in all your
existing and future Missile Silos and allows them to store up to 20 of each
type of missile.  The rack system is compact but can arm any warhead on any
silo in a matter of seconds.

Missile Guidance System
-----------------------

Cost:   35000 Cr

This  device  uses  your  sensors  to  accurately  measure the distance and
relative  vectors  of  the  launching  and  target asteroids.  It uses this
information  to  provide  you  with an indication of the likelihood of each
missile hitting the target asteroid.  By using this device you can maximise
your  attacks  and  avoid  wasting  missiles  by firing them at targets too
distant.

See the Missile section for details about how to use the Guidance System.
 
Nuclear Missile
---------------

Cost:   300000 Cr

This  missile  inflicts  large amounts of damage upon the asteroid it hits.
For further details see the summary of this warhead in the Missiles section

Ore Teleporter
--------------
 
Cost:   150000 Cr

Transporting  ore  between  your asteroids via Transporter ships can take a
lot  of  time and effort You can avoid this by constructing Ore Teleporters
on  all  your  asteroids.   Any  type  of  ore  can  be  teleported between
Teleporters   instantaneously.    For  instructions  on  its  use  see  the
description of the Ore Teleporter in the Buildings section.

Photon Turret
-------------

Cost:  100000 Cr

The most powerful turret on the market today.  Very effective against enemy
ships attacking your asteroids.  For further details see the description in
the Buildings section.

Plasma Turret
-------------

Cost:   60000 Cr

A more powerful turret than the standard Laser Turret.  For further details
see the description in the Buildings section.

Power Amplifier
---------------

Cost:   100000 Cr

This optimises your solar panels allowing them to double their power output
to  your  colony.   The Amplifier is automatically added to all present and
future Solar Panels, Generators and Solar Matrices.

Powerplant
----------

Cost:   40000 Cr

The  Powerplant  is a very cost effective means of power generation using a
fusion  process to convert Asteros ore into power.  For further details see
the description in the Buildings section.

Repair Facility
---------------

Cost:  150000 Cr

This  building  supports  a  fleet  of repair droids that move through your
colony  buildings  and  carrying out repairs of battle damage.  For further
details see the description in the Buildings section

Screen Generator
----------------

Cost:  175000 Cr

The   Screen   Generator  produces  a  defence  screen  around  itself  and
neighbouring  buildings  absorbing  some  of the damage of an enemy attack.
For furthur details see the description in the Buildings section.
 
Seismic Genetrator
------------------

Cost:  120000 Cr

This  is  the  only  type  of  drilling  assembly capable of extracting the
incredibly  rare  (and  expensive) Traxium and Nexos ores from underground.
It is a large and very complicated building but vital if you have ambitions
of  becoming a major ore supplier.  For further details see the description
in the Buildings section.

Shield X40
----------

Cost:  30000 Cr

This is a Hardpoint that can be added to newly constructed ships to improve
their defence.  It simply adds an extra layer of armour to the ships hull.

Shield X50
----------

Cost:  40000 Cr

This  is  another  hardpoint that can be added to a newly constructed ship.
It  provides  a state of the art defence system almost guaranteed to render
the ship invulnerable (but not quite) And all for a mere 40000 Cr.

Solar Matrix
------------

Cost:  30000 Cr

This  is a more space and cost effective means of power generation than the
basic  Solar Panel For furthur details see the description in the Buildings
section.

Static Inducer
--------------

Cost:  80000 Cr

This  is  a  Hardpoint that can be added to newly constructed ships it uses
the  ships  main engines to concentrate and emit a powerful electromagnetic
pulse  that  temporarily  confuses  the  electronics  of  enemy ships.  The
blueprint also shows how our own ships are protected against the e m pulse.
During  the  pulse  all  enemy  ships  are unable to move or attack and are
completely vulnerable to our own attacks.

Stasis Missile
-------------

Cost:  250000 Cr

This  state  of  the  art  missile  encompasses  the target asteroid with a
temporary  field  that  stops  time, freezing the asteroid and all ships in
orbit  about  it for a period of time.  For further details see the summary
of this warhead in the Missiles section.

Terminator
----------

Cost:  90000 Cr

This  is  a powerful Cruiser warship with 4 hardpoints making it a superior
attack  ship  to  everything but the fleet battleship.  For further details
see the description of this ship in the Spacecraft section.

Turret Optimiser
----------------

Cost:  240000 Cr

This  devise  has  been  long awaited.  It modifies all existing and future
turrets  of  any  type giving them the power to double the damage that they
can  inflict in each shot.  Quite how the device works is a closely guarded
secret, however the most popular theory is that a huge capacitor is used to
charge the turret up when not in use and the surplus of power increases the
damage it is capable of inflicting.

Virus Missile
-------------

Cost:  350000 Cr

This warhead releases a volatile substance upon impact that causes the very
rock  of an asteroid to become unstable.  It is impossible for buildings to
stand  upon  this  new,  unstable  substance.  The virus will slowly spread
across  the  asteroid  destroying  everything in its path.  A very powerful
weapon  (hence  its price).  Upon its initial release the Virus missile was
declared  illegal  on  almost  200  separate worlds however modern thinking
suggests  it  is  a  more  humane  method of warfare:  Maximum results with
minimum  casualties.   Such  is  the turnaround in the concensus of opinion
that  Sci-Teks  PR  department  has won several awards for its work on this
particular project.  For further details see the summary of this warhead in
the Missiles section.

Warp Generator
--------------

Cost:  75000 Cr

This  is a hardpoint that can be added to newly constructed ships.  It is a
limited defence device.  A capacitor is charged from the ships main engines
and  then  the charge is released as a powerful warp field phasing the ship
out  of  the  Spacial  Matrix  (tm).   In  its phased out state the ship is
impervious  to  all  damage  but  may still fire its own weapons.  When the
capacitor  has  discharged the ship phases back into normal space until the
capacators  charged  again  and  is  thus vulnerable to attack again.  This
pulsing warp field happens automatically.

Navy.   Originally  designed  and  built  in  2321,  this is the latest and
updated  version 5, newly built in 2371.  Its original designer is unknown,
but  version  5 is credited to I.  Atkin.  He (Atkin) is considered by many
to be one of the greatest naval architects the galaxy has ever seen.  It is
also  widely  believed  that he has the worst colour sense of anyone in the
known worlds, hence the Terminator's lurid (original?) colour schemes

Another  ship designed by Y.  Inara on Brekon 7, Inara obviously had a poor
year when he designed the Gax Transporter as in many areas it is inadequate
and  in  others  it is woefully underspecced.  As an example it has far too
powerful  a  computer  which  is  prone  to system crashes when the Impulse
Drives are used to manoeuvre the Transporter into orbit.  Many clients have
asked  for  better armour and longer range communicators and as a result it
is  likely  that  Inara will update the ship for re-release in the next few
years.  The reason the Gax Transporter sells is its enormous cargo bays and
the ease of loading.  Despite it's slow speed, the XLR Sensor Array is more
than  adequate  for  the  ship  to  be used in an asteroid field.  Shame it
handles like a brick though.

One  of  Sci-Tek's  most  modern  and powerful ships, it was designed by R.
Giggs  in  2364.  Despite its grand name, it is a mere fraction of the size
of  the  real  Imperial  Battleship, but is easily large enough to form the
centrepiece  of  any independent fleet.  Both Sci-Tek and Tetracorp use and
recommend  them  as  their  primary warship, and its 6 hardpoints make it a
very flexible vessel.

Designed  by  M.D.Glossop at the Morgan Design Institute on Barnard Five in
the year 2338.  Tetracorp intended the O.S.D.  to be used as a control post
in  the Frontier Sectors, keeping each mining colony in touch with the Home
Worlds  and  Tetracorp.   Glossop originally designed larger cargo bays but
altered them at the last moment into a ship construction facility.  This is
probably the sole factor that has made the O.S.D.  as successful as it is -
the ability to contruct large warships in the depth of space


ZONE 013 : HARDPOINT WEAPONS
----------------------------

This is a summary of the devices available for installation in a hardpoint.
Ones  marked  with  (blueprint)  are  only  available once the construction
rights have been purchased from Sci-Tek

Note:   Costs  given  are  correct  at  the present time but are subject to
change without warning

Ion Cannon
----------

Cost:   1000 Cr

This  is the basic (and very cheap) weapon for use against enemy asteroids.
It has a minimum impact area and does little damage

Disruptor
---------

Cost:   6000 Cr

This  weapon  is  another  Air-to-  Surface  weapon  for  use against enemy
asteroids.  It has a greater area of effect than the Ion Cannon but darmage
is still limited.

Napalm Orb
----------

Cost:  4000 Cr

This  fires a stream of high temperature plasma gas at an asteroid with its
own  Oxygen supply which will burst into flame upon impact.  Damage will be
inflicted  upon  any  buildings caught in the flame.  The area of effect is
very limited however.

Chaos Bomb
----------

Cost:   12000 Cr

This  is  an improved version of the Napalm Orb but with a much larger area
of  effect.   Like  the  Hellfire  Missile  the flames from this weapon can
easily  spread  to  neighbouring  buildings  and devastate huge areas of an
asteroid.  Very effective against densely populated asteroids.

Vortex Mine
-----------

Cost:  5000 Cr

An  electrical  vortex  is  released  upon the asteroid.  It will wander at
random  upon  the  surface  inflicting damage upon any building it touches.
The  longevity  of the vortex is indeterminate.  It can vanish at any time.
It  is  possible  for the vortex to split into two parts each continuing to
wreak havoc and each with the possibility of splitting again

Laser
-----

Cost:   1000 Cr

This  is the standard Ship to Ship weapon based on a focused beam of light.
It does very little damage.

Photon Cannon
-------------

Cost:   4500 Cr

A more effective ship to ship weapon.  The twin guns fire packets of energy
held together by a force field.

Plasma Cannon
-------------

Cost:  9000 Cr

The  most  powerful ship to ship weapon.  It fires a focused disruptor beam
housing  superheated  plasma gas and is capable of ripping through even the
most  powerful  armour.   Caution  should  be  exercised in the use of this
weapon,  and  the Company is not liable for any damage incurred to the user
should anything untoward happen.

Static Inducer (blueprint)
--------------------------

Cost:  4500 Cr

This  devise uses the ships main engines to concentrate and emit a powerful
electromagnetic  pulse  that  temporarilly  confuses  the electronics of an
enemy  ship.   During  the pulse the enemy ship is unable to move or attack
and completely vulnerable to our own attacks.

Warp Generator (blueprint)
--------------------------

Cost:  9000 Cr

This  is  a  limited defence device.  A capacitor is charged from the ships
main  engines  and  then  the  charge  is released as a powelful warp field
phasing  the  ship  out  of the Spacial Matrix (tm) In its phased state the
ship  is  impervious  to all damage but may still fire its own weapons When
the  capacitor  has discharged the ship phases back into normal space until
the  capacitor  is  charged  again  and is thus vulnerable to attack again.
This pulsing warp field happens automatically

Deflector (blueprint)
---------------------

Cost:  12000 Cr

This  devise  consists  of a generator that pulses energy through the ships
hull  all  the time that it is in flight using power from the main engines.
The  energised hull is more resilient to attacks and can absorb and deflect
most  attacks.  The Deflector can be used with existing shields and greatly
improves the lifetime of a ship

Shield X10
----------

Cost:  1500 Cr

This extends the armour of the ships hull to give better protection against
damage.   This  shield  adds 10 armour points and may be stacked with other
Shields or defences

Shield X20
----------

Cost:  3000 Cr

This extends the armour of the ships hull to give better protection against
damage.   This  shield  adds 20 armour points and may be stacked with other
shields or defences

Shield X30
----------

Cost:  5000 Cr

This extends the armour of the ships hull to give better protection against
damage.   This  shield  adds 30 armour points and may be stacked with other
shields or defences

Shield X40 (blueprint)
----------------------

Cost:  6500 Cr

This extends the armour of the ships hull to give better protection against
damage.   This  shield  adds 40 armour points and may be stacked with other
shields or defences

Shield X50 (blueprint)
----------------------

Cost:  8000 Cr

This extends the armour of the ships hull to give better protection against
damage.   This  shield  adds 50 armour points and may be stacked with other
shields or defences.


TERRAN  APPROVED:   2450  THE  FOLLOWING SECTION IS FOR THOSE WITH SECURITY
CLEARANCE ORANGE AND ABOVE ONLY


ZONE 014 : MISSILE WARFARE
--------------------------

Missiles  are  an  integral part of the military might of your colony.  You
should  rely  on  neither  ships  alone  nor  missiles  alone,  but  use  a
combination  of both of them.  The advantage of missiles is that they are a
long range weapon, allowing you to strike at the enemy deep in space.  This
is a disadvantage too since missiles cannot be used to combat enemy attacks
on your asteroids.

BUILDING MISSILES
-----------------

To  be  able to build and launch missiles you must have one or more Missile
Silos  on  an  asteroid Select these from the Bullding Selection Window and
construct  them on suitable asteroids preferably ones with a variety of ore
and  not  too distant from an enemy asteroid.  You need only one silo on an
asteroid  but  the  more  you  do  have  the  more  missiles you can launch
simultaneously for a quicker attack.

To  build  a  missile click on the Missile Silo building.  A window appears
detailing  each of the missiles available to you at this time.  See the end
of  this  section for a summary of each missile warhead type.  Some missile
types  are  only  available  once  you  have  purchased the blueprints from
Sci-Tek.  At the start of the game you have 6 types available but there are
11 in total

                      LEFT             RIGHT

                      BUILD            ABORT

                                       EXIT

Use  the  Left  and  Right Arrow buttons to cycle through the missile types
until you reach the one you wish to build.

Click  on  the Build Missile button to build a missile and click successive
times to build more than one.

Click  on  the  Abort  button  to abort the building of any of this type of
missile.  Other types will be unaffected.

Missiles  will  be  built  over a period of time.  Each type takes the same
amount  of  time to build but clearly the more you want to build the longer
it  will  take.  The cost of each missile will be deducted when the missile
is  finally  built  and  delivered automatically to the underground missile
hangers.   These  hangers can hold up to 10 of each type of warhead on each
asteroid.   NOTE:   Money  must be pre allocated to the Missile Fund in the
Financial Fund Window.  See the appropriate section for how to do this.

The  type  of  Ore  needed to build the missile is given in the information
window  but  you  will  be warned if there is insufficient ore to build any
particular missile.  The ore must be held in Stores on the current asteroid
so  you may need Mines to extract ore (See the section on Mining) Similarly
you will be warned if the current asteroid does not have a Weapons Factory.
Missiles cannot be built without one.

Even  if  you receive one of these warnings about insufficient ore, lack of
money  or  lack of Weapons Factory the Missile Silos will continually check
whether  they  can  build  another  missile.  So as soon as you rectify the
fault  (ie  mine  or  transport more ore allocate more money to the Missile
Fund   or   build   a  Weapons  Factory)  the  construction  will  continue
automatically.

LAUNCHING MISSILES
------------------

To  launch  a  missile  click  on the Launch Missile button either from the
Asteroid View Screen or the Asteroid Field Screen.

A  window  will  list  the  number  of each type of missile you have on the
current  asteroid.   Each blob on the barcharts represents one missile.  At
the bottom of the window the current target is listed, if you have selected
one,  and  the  expected  accuracy  of  any  missiles launched against this
target.   This  accuracy is unavailable unless you have purchased a Missile
Tracker  from Sci-Tek.  So until you buy a Missile Tracker you will have to
estimate your chances of success for a missile attack (see below)

               LAUNCH   TARGET    ABORT     EXIT

SETTING THE TARGET ASTEROID
---------------------------

Missiles  can  only  target  asteroids  not individual ships or fleets.  To
select a target from the Missile Control Window click on the Target button.
You  will  be  taken  to  the  Asteroid View screen (unless you are already
there) and shown all the asteroids known to you.

A  circle  is  entered  on the current asteroid and this marks the range of
your  missiles.   The  circle  is  of  little use unless you have a Missile
Tracker.   In  which  case it will be accompanied by a percentage chance to
hit  figure.  If you don`t use a Missile Tracker you`ll have to experiment.
As  you  move the cross hair with the mouse the circle will grow and shrink
and  the  percentage chance to hit will alter.  The percentage chance is an
approximate  indication  of the chance of EACH of your missiles hitting but
remember  that  even if a missile reaches its target successfully the enemy
may have the means to shoot it down.

To  select a target asteroid move the cross hair over an asteroid and click
the  left  mouse  button.   You  will return to the Missile Control window.
That  target  is  now  set  and  will  remain so unless you alter it ot the
targetted asteroid is destroyed

SELECTING THE MISSILES TO FIRE
------------------------------

You  can  fire as many missiles at a time as you want but remember that the
missiles  will  take  longer  to launch if you only have one or two Missile
Silos.

To  select  missiles  move  the  mouse  pointer over the name of a missile.
Click  right to add one missile of that type to the launch bay.  Click left
to  remove  one missile from the launch bay.  Hold down the mouse button to
add/remove  several  missiles.   The  red blobs show available missiles and
green blobs show missiles selected for launch.

The  numbers  at  the right of the window echo this information showing how
many missiles you have selected of each type.

The abort button will clear all selected missiles of all types.

LAUNCHING THE MISSILES
----------------------

To actually launch the selected missiles click on the Launch button.

To quit without launching any missiles click on the Exit button.

You  can  watch  the progress of missiles in flight from the Asteroid Field
Screen.  Your missiles appear as yellow dots.

MISSILE WARHEAD DATA
--------------------

The  data  on  each missile type follows.  Missiles marked with (blueprint)
are only available from Sci-Tek.

Note:   This  data  is  accurate  at  this moment in time but is subject to
change by Sci-Tek and the other missile manufacturers without warning.

Explosive
---------

Cost:  1000 Cr
Ore:   1 Selenium

This  is  the basic (and very cheap) warhead.  It has a minimum impact area
on  the  target  and several such missiles may be required to destroy enemy
buildings.  For best results launch many at one time.

Area Explosive
--------------

Cost:  8000 Cr
Ore:   2 Barium

As  an  extension to the basic Explosive warhead, this warhead does similar
damage  but  over  a  wider  area.   For  best  results use against densely
populated asteroids.

Napalm
------

Cost:  6000 Cr
Ore:   1 Quazinc

This  warhead  has  a  core of plasma gas which is released at a phenomenal
temperature  upon  impact.   It  carries  its own Oxygen supply causing the
impacted buildings to erupt into flame.  This flame will burn for some time
inflicting further damage.  The area of effect is very limited however.

Hellfire
--------

Cost:  20000 Cr 
Ore:   3 Quazinc

The  chemical  substance  encased  in  this  warhead is a by product of the
development  of  the  Napalm  warheads.   Upon impact the core shatters and
spreads high temperature plasma gas over a wide area.  Any structure caught
in  this  blast  will  begin  to  burn ferociously and suffer damage over a
period  of  time.   The  hellfire substance has the capability to spread to
neighbouring  buildings  and it is possible for one missile to devastate an
entire  asteroid  if  the  hellfire  burns long enough.  Clearly it is most
eftective against densely populated asteroids.

Scatter
-------

Cost:  10000 Cr
Ore:   3 Selenium

This  is  a  larger  version  of  the  basic Explosive warhead.  In fact it
contains  25  such warheads.  It will explode just above the surface of the
asteroid  and  the multiple warheads will fall at random upon the asteroid.
The  damage  is  slight  but  the  random pattern is good at weakening many
buildings at once.

Vortex
------

Cost:   9000 Cr
Ore:    3 Crystalite

Upon  impact  an  electrical vertex is released upon the asteroid.  It will
wander  at  random  upon the surface inflicting damage upon any building it
touches.   The  longevity  of  the  vortex is indeterminate and Sci-Tek are
still  attempting to develop a Vortex MkII that has a guaranteed longevity.
It  is  possible  for the vortex to split into two parts each continuing to
wreak havoc, and each with the possibility of splitting again.

Nuclear(blueprint)
------------------

Cost:  50000 Cr
Ore:   5 Asteros

This is a multi-megaton warhead capable of inflicting enormous damage to an
asteroid  possibly destroyirng every building upon it.  Spacecraft in orbit
will  also  suffer  damage  from  the blast.  WARNING:  USE WITH CARE!  The
radiation   effects   from   a   nuclear  attack  can  render  an  asteroid
uninhabitable for many many years.

Virus (blueprint)
-----------------

Cost:  30000 Cr
Ore:   1 Traxium

This  is  a very powerful weapon which unfortunately reguires the very rare
Traxium  ore for its payload.  Upon impact it releases a volatile substance
which  begins at once to eat at the fabric of the asteroid itself.  It will
alter  the  molecular  consistency  of  the asteroid material, turning it a
different  colour  as  it  does  so.  No building can stand upon a weakened
section  of  asteroid,  but will simply collapse.  The mutated rock becomes
radioactive too.  Over time the virus will spread across the asteroid never
stopping  until it has affected the entire asteroid which is then incapable
of  supporting  any  colony at all.  A virus infected asteroid is living on
borrowed time!  There is one way to combat the virus an Anti-Virus missile.

Anti-Virus (blueprint)
----------------------

Cost:  10000 Cr
Ore:   4 Barium

The  only  known  means  to enadicate the effects of a Virus missile.  Upon
impact  it  disperses  a  bacterial  agent  over  the entire surface of the
asteroid.   Within  moments  this  will  seek  out  and  destroy  the virus
substance and halt its spread.  It will then begin to act upon the parts of
the  asteroid that have been altered by the virus.  It takes a long time to
act  but will eventually restore the asteroid to a more stable form capable
of  supporting buildings again.  The only known side effect is an increased
radiation.

Since you will only be firing this missile aganst one of your own asteroids
it  is  possible to target the same asteroid as the launching silo by using
the same technique explained above.

Mega (blueprint)
----------------

Cost:   65500 Cr
Ore:    1 Nexos

This  is  the  most  devastating weapon available!  It took Sci-Tek some 40
years  of  research  to  perfect  it.   Quite  simply it destroys an entire
asteroid  or  even  a small sized planet - nothing but rubble remains.  The
actual  process  is  extremely complicated, relying upon a gravity pulse to
rip  apart  the  target  asteroid  rather than simply using huge amounts of
explosives.

Stasis (blueprint)
------------------

Cost:  40000 Cr
Ore:   2 Korellium

This  is  the  latest  warhead  from  Sci-Tek utilising their research into
temporal  physics.   Upon  impact it will establish a temporal field around
the  asteroid  latching  it  to  the Spacial Matrix (TM) of the surrounding
space.   The  effect  is  to  freeze time itself or at least the local time
inside  the stasis field.  Nothing will happen on the affected asteroid and
no  spacecraft  or  missiles may arrive or leave.  The field will decay and
die over a period of time.


ZONE 015 : THE ENEMY
--------------------

KLL-KP-QUA

Home world: Tau Ceti III

Physical  Description:   At  first  glance  they  resemble a Terran Praying
Mantis,  standing  just  under  1m  tall.   Their  face  however bears more
resemblance  to  a bird than an insect.  They have two eyes, two ears and a
single  mouth  positioned  where  we  would expect a nose to be.  It is not
known whether they possess a sense of smell.  Atop their heads they wear an
ornate   headpiece,  whose  complexity  and  colours  denote  theie  social
standing.   At  all  times  they  dress  in  exquisite and colourful robes,
usually adorned with large ruffs and gemstones.

Habitat:  Their native habitat varies from hot and arid grassland to steamy
jungles.   They  can  adapt  to  other  habitats  except  they  have little
resistance to cold or ice.

Technology:   They have adapted to space very well, building well-insulated
structures  and large underground caverns, filled with native jungle fauna,
their spaceships are basic and their technology generally barely adequate.

Social  Structure:   They  exhibit  remarkable  similarities to Terran hive
insects.   Each  asteroid  possesses a single Queen, responsible for laying
and  hatching  all  eggs,  the  rest  of  the  population is split into two
distinct and genetically different groups.  One remains on the asteroid and
fulfils  a  support role building, maintenance, serving the Queen, etc, the
others  operate  the  spacecraft  and  are  never  allowed to return to the
asteroids.   They spend their entire life inside the spacecraft.  In normal
circumstances  a  Queen  is born every 2 to 3 Terran Years.  Once the Queen
reaches  maturity,  in a few short months, she commandeers a transport ship
and goes in search of her own asteroid.  It is not known whether their is a
hierarchy   amongst   the   Queens.    Each  asteroid  appears  to  operate
independently,  but  there  is  regular  communication  between  Queens  on
different asteroids.

Power  Generation:  The primary means of power generation is the burning of
their  own  corpses.   All  dead  are  carefully recovered and taken to the
burners.  Secondary power generation is by means of solar panels

Special  Weapons:  It is known that they possess a special type of warhead,
but its effects are unknown.

Military  Strategy:   Their  actions  appear  very predicable so expect few
surprises.


LAK`MAJ`TRAAL (ORE EATERS)

Home  world:   Their  exact  home  world  is  not  known.   We beleive they
originated  in  the  M53  galaxy  in Sagittarius, which they appear to have
explored extensively.

Physical  Description:   An adult male stands 1m high at the head and up to
12m  long.   They are very large wormlike creatures covered in hard scales.
Their  fangs  and horns have the strength to break up rocks.  Their diet is
one  of rock.  They regurgitate a special chemical that can break down even
the  hardest  ores,  which  they  then  eat  hungrily,  digesting them with
extraordinarily strong stomach acids.  Their heat signature in Infra Red is
enormous.   They  are  slow  moving which is why they rely on technology to
assist them.

Habitat:   They  seem  able to exist in any habitat but particularly in the
vacuum  of  space.   Examining the M53 galaxy, we have discovered that huge
areas  of  it  have  been destroyed.  planet literally eaten apart by great
migrations  of these creatures.  Their appetite is enormous - an adult male
will eat up to twelve times his own body weight in ores every day!

They are a real threat to the Empire

Technology:  Most of their structures are simple domes, protecting areas of
an  asteroid  from solar radiation and meteorite bombardment while they eat
into  the  heart  of the asteroid in search of food.  They possess powerful
spacecraft  which have carried them to our galaxy from M53.  We know little
of  their  technology since whenever they evacuate an asteroid they destroy
all remnants of their structures and devices.

Social  Structure:  We have been unable to determine their heirarchy, other
than  the  obvious  dominance  that the adult males have due to their size.
Procreation  is  via egg laying, but the population grows slowly due to the
longevity  of  each  male.   It appears that duties are simply performed by
whoever is in the right place at the right moment.  Their must be some form
of overall control, even if it is only the signal which makes them suddenly
board  the  transporters  and  head  for another asteroid which they do the
minute they have drained it of ore.

Power  Generation:  They use chemical reactions to break down useless rock,
harnessing the power created.

Special Weapons: No information

Military Strategy:  They are vicious when disturbed.  We have observed that
they  only  ever attack our mining colonies and never inhabited planets, as
if  they  identify  that  our mining colonies are robbing them of food.  Be
prepared for regular missile strikes.


AX-ZILANTH`S

Home  world:   Beta Hydrae IV, though they are extensive in the Capella and
Arcturus  Sectors,  where  we  have  fought  skirmishes  with  them on many
occasions.

Physical Description:  The bulk of their 2m tall bodies are a hard carapace
that  protects  their vital and sensory organs The lower part of their body
consists  of  six extremely sensitive and flexible tentacles which they use
both for movement (fast!) and manipulation of objects.  Their eyes see in a
greater  spectrum  than  our  own,  allowing them access to Ultraviolet and
Infrared light.

Habitat:   Varies from sparse desert and rocky badlands to temperate forest
and grassy plains.

Technology:   Their technology has developed upon similar lines to our own.
They  use smelting processes to produce steel and use silicon and germanium
components in their electronic circuits.  Their spacecraft are certainly on
a par with our own, if not superior and many possess cloaking devices.

Social  Structure:   They operate on a strict hierarchy as does our Empire.
Each  asteroid is divided into sections responsible for a particular aspect
such as engineering, food supply spacecraft manufacture, etc.  Each section
head  reports  to  an  asteroid council which determines overall policy for
that  asteroid.  The chair being of each council participates in a regional
council  that  comprises twenty or more asteroids and planets.  We conclude
that a representative of these regional councils sits upon a higher council
that governs their entire Empire.

Power  Generation:   Standard  techniques  of Fission and Fusion as well as
harnessing solar energy.

Special Weapons:  No information.  We suspect that they have

Military  Strategy:   Our skirmishes with them in other sectors have led us
to  determine that they are never first to initiate an attack.  They parade
a  threatening  arsenal  of  weapons and warships but always wait for us to
take  the  initiative  before  retailaiting.   Try  to  use  this  to  your
advantage.


TYLARAN EMPIRE

Home world: Deneb Mira III

Physical  Description:   They  resemble  hideous  lizards, standing over 3m
tall.  Though they have no balancing tail, the bulk of their body and their
strong legs enables them to walk easily as a biped.  Their clawed hands are
surprisingly  dextrous and capable of manipulating very fine objects.  They
possess  large mouths with fangs, identifying them as carnivores, and their
craniums support a brain larger than our own.

Habitat:   Their  homeworlds are ice worlds, far from their primary sun and
covered  with continual ice and blizzards.  They are at home in the cold of
space!   We  believe  that their hide contains special insulating layers to
protect them against temperatures up to -100 degrees below freezing.

Technology:   Their  technology  varies greatly.  On the one hand they have
only  recently developed spacecraft capable of crossing interstellar space,
(though we have monitored their home world for over a century and know that
their  weapons technology is spohisticated).  On the other hand we have yet
to understand other aspects of their technology, such as power generation.

Social  Structure:   They  seem  to  operate  on  the principle of Imperial
supremacy,  where  each  region of space has a sub Emperor who has complete
control over his region, but reports to the real Emperor on Deneb Mira III.
They  are  very social creatures and work well with each other.  Discipline
is strong and absolute and apparently welcomed.

Power  Generation:   We  can  only suspect that they harness power directly
from  the  Spacial  Matrix,  which  would  give  the  access to practically
unlimited  power.   We  have  detected  new  kinds  of  radiation  from the
buildings  that  we have called Flux Convertors and Power Collectors and we
suspect that these play an important part in the process.
 
Special  Weapons:   One of their structures emits a huge surge of energy at
regular  intervals.   This  could  well  be  a weapon proceed with caution.
Their asteroids also have a screen generator whose purpose is unclear.

Military Strategy: Unknown.


THE RIGELLIAN CONFEDERATION

Home world: Rigel system

Physical  Description:   We  were  very  surprised when we first identified
their  species  over  a century ago.  They corresponded almost exactly with
historical  depictions  of  vampires,  which makes it conceivable that they
visited  Earth in the long distant past to provide a source for the classic
legends.   They appear similar to a human but with bald domed heads, and of
course  those legendary fangs.  Their eyes glow an eerie red, which we know
to be the reflection of light off their retinas.  All their senses are well
developed.

Habitat: Unknown

Technology:   Their  technology is sophisticated, though not in the area of
power  generation.   Their devices appear to require vast amounts of power,
and  several of our scout ships have been mysteriously drained of all power
after  entering  Rigellian  Space.  They are also extremely advanced in the
areas of Warp technology.

Social  Structure:   From the few communications we have made with them, we
know  them  to  be  an extremely ancient race.  It is likely that they were
developing   technology   when  dinosaurs  walked  the  Earth.   They  name
themselves a Confederation, which suggests that they operate as a series of
individual  states  or  worlds  that  are  independently  governed but have
allegiance and common laws with each other under the authority of a federal
government.   They are highly developed socially, but steadfastly refuse to
open negotiations with us for the trade of materials or information.

Power  Generation:   Primitive  methods of burning fossil fuels.  They only
recently  aquired  the  secrets  of  atomic  power,  stolen from one of our
research vessels.

Special  Weapons:   They  have  the  abilility  to  drain  power  from  our
batteries.  Otherwise, we expect few surprises.

Military  Strategy:   We  would  best describe their strategies as muddled.
They  are  very trigger-happy with missiles.  We also know that their ships
carry advanced warp engines.


SWIXARANS

Home  world:   They  originate from the densely grouped star systems at the
heart  of  our galaxy.  We have detected their presence in over thirty star
systems.

Physical Description:  The Swixarans are one of those rare cases when plant
life  has  developed intelligence and the ability to develop technology.  A
typical  Swixaran  is between 1m and 4m high and composed of a mass of soft
and  pliable  shoots  and  creepers.   Constantly moving.  Their exact form
varies with their surroundings - if they enter corridors they flatten their
body  and use many of their creepers to probe the way ahead.  We are unsure
of  their sensory organs but it is likely they possess very sensitive touch
sensors  in their extremities and maybe motion detectors as well.  There is
a  small  part of their body which we suspect houses their vital organs and
brain, but it is always well protected by the creepers.

Habitat:   Unknown,  but  we  suspect  either  dense  jungle worlds or huge
forests.

Technology:  Almost incomparable to our own, since much of their technology
is  based  on biological proteins and DNA encoded, self replicating tissue.
They are very advanced in areas of shield generation and cloaking devices.

Social  Structure:  Difficult to determine.  We suspect that they possess a
group intelligence and there is evidence to support the theory that a great
deal  of  this  intelligence  is  located  in a particular location on each
asteroid.  Their aims seem only to be expansion and colonisation.

Power  Generation:   We do not understand their method of power generation.
It  is  certainly biologically based and undoubtedly bears more resemblance
to  blood  sugar  levels  in  their  organic  structures,  rather  than the
harnessing of nuclear power.

Special  Weapons:   Our  spies  report several closely guarded weapons, the
details of which are unavailable at this time.  Be prepared for anything!

Military  Strategy:   They  seem to react to our own strategies and attacks
rather  than  initiating  their  own  they  are  especially  susceptible to
fire-based  weaponry,  but  otherwise  their structures are well protected.
There  does  seem  to  be  a  pattern  to their attacks, but we have yet to
understand it.
