                                 IMPORTANT

                               ANNOUNCEMENT!
			     ¯ ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ ¯




This is a PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT which will hopefully help out a lot of sysops 
in the scene who run an Ami-Express BBS to decide which cause of action is
most appropriate to their circumstance. I.e; choose to pay and upgrade to 
Version 4.00 or look for an alternative system sporting similar features,
'look' and 'feel'. Until today the only viable scene alternative was to
turn to 'S-Express' since 'C-Net' has always been very scene-unfriendly,
being more suited to P.D and business systems. We have now decided to come
out of the closet and leak some information pertaning to the inniment 
release of "Swift-Professional"...

This release comes after the announcement of the very expensive 'upgrade' 
fee`s which are being touted for the move over to Ami-Express Revision 4,
we feel the upgrade prices for registered users is far to high for the
average sysop and hence we now present our answer to your problems...








                      Introducing Swift Professional
                    ¯ ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ ¯



This announcement was originally to be delayed until September 1994 after 
which we felt the research, development and testing phases would be 
sufficiently completed for the initial release of Swift-Professional ®.
After the late news of the massive price upgrades for /X4.xx we are now 
releasing theses vital notes for sysops before they part with their
hard earned cash... The /X market monopoly situation is history!

Swift-Professional ® is a brand new BBS System written exclusively for the 
Amiga scene by Amiga coding enthusiasts. Key members of the Amiga community
have given many interesting and worthy suggestions, many of which have been 
greatly recieved. Swift has been in constant development for over a year and
thousands of revisions to the source have taken place since its initial beta
stages.

Sysops currently running Ami-Express (3 series) will be pleased to know that 
this system is based around the concepts of this BBS System and so they will
feel right at home using Swift. Infact Swift is 99% compatible with most
doors written for Ami-Express v3.xx .People after reading this statement may 
feel that Swift is therefore a blatent rip-off of the PD Ami-Express source-
code released about a year ago. We must STRESS that this is not the case. 

Swift is loosely based around the original source to Ami-Express v3.xx. It
has undergone an almost complete re-write. Also during this re-code we opted
to program the new system using highly efficient optimised Motorola MC680x0
Assembly language. Opting for assembly language has had its disadvantage for
us in that development has taken far longer than would have been the case
in using a high-level language like SAS/C. The overwheming benefits that
development in assembly has had to the system are that object-code is very
very compact (it is now half the size of the current Express incarnations)
and from memory conservation aspects you can expect to run a 4 or maybe 
even 5 node BBS on a standard Amiga-A1200 and still have some free memory!
The speed increase is also quite substantial, you can expect to see text-
output on an `020 race to about 3 times faster than /X can handle when 
running flat out on an 030...







                     Swift as a System for Door Writers
                   ¯ ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ ¯


Below explains information for door developers, coders and just the 
inquisitive. Non-technical knowledgable sysops may skip this section...

Fundemental changes have taken place to the original single node type design
of the original code. Ami-Express was written by Thomas X quite a few years
ago when BBS`s where tame single node systems run of 20mb hard-disks... Now
the number of nodes a BBS uses can run into double figures and a thousand
or more members with 3-Gigs online is not uncommon.

The old port interface was far too inflexible and provided far too many 
limitations for a fast well designed system which we intended Swift to be.
Swift has been written with a different approach. Instead of having one 
main program which sets up links for each node and for each door we have 
developed a new system to minimise CPU overhead and memory usage. 
It utilizes many amiga specific features;


		BBS:Swift			- node callback code,
						  kickstarts the nodes

		LIBS:Swift.library		- main amiga shared library
						  access for doors and each
						  node shares the same code

		L:Swift-handler			- for CLI Door access, 
						  re-directs pr_CLI, pr_COS
	                                          input and ouput to swift
						  without any speed loss
						  or time usage overheads...


Door writers will be pleased to hear they can develop their doors and access
ALL important memory structures, variables and routines virtually DIRECT via
the mult-access shared library. Many examples will be supplied with the 
release and Assembly programmers documentation/examples will not be left out!

You now no longer need to setup inflexible, memory hungry door ports. Simple
calls to the 'swift.library' allow writers very easy development and faster
development & debugging times. You can ofcourse still develop doors using the
old system as its fully compatible with the Ami-Express 32-Node Multi-Comm
structure and JH-Door interface but the new interface allow far more 
flexiblity. You now specify the node to access as a parameter for each library
call enabling you to access all active nodes without ANY door interface 
polling! - Its all handled via the library.. Extensive documentation will
be included and many examples will be supplied...





          Swift Professional - Current *NEW* [BUILT-IN] Features
         ¯ ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ ¯

Below contains some of the new additional features over the current
Ami-Express 3.xx series that Swift has (and over the planned /X4.0 
release! - grin)


»	Swift is Fully "Localized" so that every single BBS String is 
	configurable. Catalogues will be available to support different
	languages. This means each user can select their language preference
	(catalogue availability permitting) thus enabling multi-language 
	support for each individual member of your BBS. A catalogue editor 
	will be supplied so you can translate and create your own custom 
	catalogues and really change the 'look' and 'feel' of your system!

»	Swifts internal commands, like 'g' for goodbye, 'd' download, etc.
	are fully configurable and all names are redefinable, etc. Please
	refer to the example configuration script for more information
	about commands...

»	Swift supports ALL CLI-driven doors making available online games 
	like 'Hack-and-Slash' using our custom written handler...

»	Swift supports the Public-Domain specifications for BI-DIRECTIONAL 
	'Hydra' file-transfers enabling chat, upload and download facilities 
	with modems supporting full-duplex transfers and the appropriate
	terminal software.

»	Swift currently consumes only 250k per node, (this may vary in
	the final release) but our general aim is to reduce this amount to
	even less during later stages of development!

»	Swift can be configured to support upto 100 independent nodes
	in a true multi-tasking fasion...
	
»	Swift has a brand new Workbench 2.x+ style guidelines complient
	GUI interface.

»	Swift can be configured using a brand new GUI control interface
	or more seasoned sysops can configure the BBS directly via the
	configuration bbs script. Sysops can carry out Configurations 
	while on-line. (see supplied files for a beta example of a bbs
	configuration script)

»	Swift Sysop node snooping screens are now far more flexible;

	> Use of custom palettes		 - Palette Requesrs
	> Use of custom fonts			 - Font Requesters
	> Use of Screenmodes including AGA modes - Screenmode Requesters
	> Use of Public screens for consoles
	> Border blanking available on OS3.x+
	> Optional Scrollback buffers on nodes

»	Swift has a Special cutdown size versions of callerslogs,
	udlogs, etc. in a very compact format taking much less storage..

»	Swift has a built in fully featured, fully configurable
	File nuker! This has a public-file nuke facility so that users
	can delete files they uploaded if they discover they have uploaded
	a fake .. will reduce (co)sysop maintenance overheads...

»	Swift has Public "EALLS" mailing facilities. Users can send "PUBLIC
	EALLS"  that everyone has the ability to recieve however each user 
	can set their public eall access level so they recieve public ealls
	only from access levels they set, etc. eg; 200+.

»	Swift has Public and private mail-screening facilities, users can
	block mail from certain users and or access levels (not sysops)

»	Swift mail sent Private to the "local-sysop" cannot be read by anyone
	else, not even co-sysops! (optional)

»	Swift has some new "stealth file-transfer" options;

	> User-2-User Encrypted File/Mail-Transfers 
	  - Whereby only 1 particular user can DL the file...

	> Password Encrypted File/Mail-Transfers
	  - Anyone with decryption password, useful for group confidential
	    materials, information, source-codes, demos & releases, etc.)

	> Optional automatic usage of PGP and Keyrings to validate releases
	  and pass one encrypt mail...

»	Swifts accounting system is fully encrypted, not just the user
	passwords. Non-reversible algorithms for passwords and special
	BBS 'Seed' cyphier strings will be required to alter/access any
	user-data information from outside the door-interface making
	BBS Viruses which add Sysop access accounts a thing of the past!
	Actual user.data type file is locked out from access during BBS 
	usage thereby preventing even reading or writing to the files...

»	Swift has a new command to let users view the portion of "CallersLog" 
	Relating to themselves. This allows them to view if someone has been
	using their account.. View their last 10 downloads/uploads etc. 
	They`ll ONLY be able to view THEIR OWN CALLS!

»	Users have a brand new preferences section to customise their BBS
	usage to their preferences. This allows them to customise the way
	they logon to the BBS, etc.

Select Option : 


»	Swift`s login procedure has altered the way the new accounts are 
	added. If a username is not recognized it will prompt with
	"Invalid Username!" and the user will be asked for another try. 
	It will not any longer ask 'Continue as a new user'. To begin the
	New user account opening phase the user must enter his/her name as
	"GUEST" or "NEW" (infact any keyword setup in the localized catalogue)


User-Password Notice	If a hacker has been trying to get in on a users
			account the next time the user connects with the
			correct Password it will tell them how many times 
			Password Fails have occured and forces them to 
			change their password. This is recorded in the
			callerslog and user can see how many times their
			password has been changed and see if their account
			has been hacked...

Ansi-Mode (Y/n)		At login on Ami-Express and C-NET boards this is
			a standard question. Now a user who`s already a
			member of the BBS gets this preference saved in
			their account (users don`t get asked to choose 
			type now its a user-preference) <ON/OFF/ASK>
			They can ofcourse set this to be asked at every
			login if they so desire..

Quick-Login		Users can configurate the information they see
			at a login phase and set an auto-quick login
			if they have access to this action.
		
Auto-Mailscan		Now scanning mail in each conference is a user
			preference... <ON/OFF>

Auto-Who		At login shows status of nodes, again a user
			preference... <ON/OFF>

Auto-Cmd-String		At login executes a user-defined list of door
			commands..eg; "T\J 2\N S U\" - This would show
			the time. Join Conference 2, Scan Newfiles...



Below a tiny few of the new configuration options explained;
(NB: Please refer to the configuration script for more of the available
options)

CLOSED_SYSTEM		By adding this tooltype to the node it disallows
			the [GUEST] keyword (or whatever the localized
			equivelent is) from being recognised thus 
			disabling the ability for new users to even begin
			to join. This makes the system "Member Referral" 
			Only in a quick way.

LOCAL_SYSOP		If you add this tooltype it will FORBID any
			attempt to login as the Sysop from [REMOTE]
			This is for sysops who are at home and *KNOW*
			that nobody should be trying to login as them
			Only LOCAL Logins for the sysop will be allowed
			when this icon is used. The callerslog will be
			notified of any attempts to REMOTE LOGIN as well
			as the user being auto-disconnected before they
			even get the chance to enter a password.

USERNAME_RETRIES=	This allows you to set the maximum number of
			[Username] chances a user who logs in gets before
			they get disconnected. Default 2. <Range 1-5>
			NB: The sysop account has an override to this
			function... The Sysop account has only ONE chance
			at the password before getting disconnected.

USERPASS_RETRIES=	This allows you to set the maximum number of
			[Password] atttempts a user who logs in gets before
			they get disconnected. Default 2 <Range 1-5>

SYSTEMPASS_RETRIES=	This allows you to set the maximum number of
			System Password atttempts a user who logs in gets 
			before they get disconnected. Default 3 <Range 1-5>

NUP_RETRIES=		This allows you to set the maximum number of
			Retries at the NEWUSER_PASSWORD before they get 
			auto-disconnected. Default 1 <Range 1-5>

PWFAIL_FEEDBACK		If this setting is added it will not attempt to
			execute the external "PWFAIL" door. Instead it will
			use an internal password fail door. This will ask
			the user if they want to notify the sysop if they
			have failed their password and let them leave mail
			then auto-disconnect the user. Once a user has
			failed their password their access level regardless
			of what it usually is, is dropped to 5 during the
			message sending phase. Remote logins as Sysop simply
			disconnect without asking to leave the sysop mail.


"G" 	 		Goodbye command now asks user if they really want
			to disconnect.

"G!" 			Instant Goodbye.No checking for partuploads/etc. 
			just an instant 'normal' logff.

"VS" or "V"		Now the view command will allow viewing of ANY 
			file, be it a textfile or binary. It strips all
			non-ansi characters and replaces them with full
			stops... Also now changed to PAGE FLIP text
			instead of scroll.. for faster viewing..

"WHO"			Revamped command,
			Default Looks like below...

			(Who door "ASCII template" is 100% configurable
			and different access level users can be shown
			different templates pertaining to more information
			about individual nodes!)

The Sysop`s node (Node 00) can now be setup as 'REMOTE_NODE_EMULATOR'.
This allows you to fully 'test' the bbs as if you where logging in from
remote. You login with a term program (you can use the built in term
program) Then you can upload/download, etc. exactally like connecting to 
the BBS from remote. This uses the 'nullmodem.device', however in an 
'intellegent' way.. it knows if your using the nullmodem device so you 
Don`t need to type the usual, ATD, RING, RING, CONNECT 19200, etc.. You 
simply type 'ATD'<return> just as you would if connecting to a normal bbs
and it does the rest...

Filename	This item tells you the filename of the program, Notice the
brackets []...  Within these contains the filenumber that corresponds to
that file. If you wanted to download this file you could select it file by 
its Name or Number. eg;	'TRASHV20.DMS' or '1'

UL-Date		This item shows you the Date and Time at which the file was
uploaded onto the BBS. This helps you to determine how 'new' the file is.

Filesize	This item gives you the length of the file (rounded off to 
the nearest KByte.)

Xfer-Time	This tells you time [HH-MM-SS] it took the uploader to send 
the file and the CPS they obtained.

File_Diz	This tells you if the file already contains a valid
File_description

No DL`s		This tells you how many time the file has previously been
downloaded since it was uploaded to the BBS. This is updated every time
a file is transfered and so does not slow down the BBS or require any
offline processing. It also means its always upto date.

UL-Node		Tells you what node the user uploaded the file on.






Below is an example screen for statistics when you select to download
or upload a file...

                       Availability, Pricing & Costs
	             ¯ ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ ¯


PLEASE NOTE 'SWIFT-PROFESSIONAL' WILL ONLY BE AVAILABLE FOR AMIGA`S
WITH AT LEAST AN MC68020 PROCESSOR - IF I GET ENOUGH REQUESTS I -MAY-
REWRITE THE 020 SPECIFIC CODE TO MC68000 SPECIFICATIONS.. (ARG, BUT THIS
WILL BE A HELL OF A *LOT* OF WORK... A LOT OF SOURCE HAS BEEN WRITTEN
IN ASSEMBLY SPECIFICALLY FOR 020.. SO IT AIN`T JUST A RECOMPILE.. THE
JOYS OF SAS/C EH?!!!!!!!)

A beta version of Swift-Professional is expected to be released soon.
Hopefully the features outlined in this textfile will have appealed to
you and you may wish to run Swift in the near future after final coding
and beta testing has been completed.

We opted against icon configuration, however we will supply you a 
conversion tool to convert your Ami-Express v3.xx system over to Swift.
If your an 'icon' type person you can always use the easy to use supplied
GUI Editor. Hardened sysops can edit the configuration script by hand 
using an ascii text-editor. This should make the move efforless and you 
can then begin enjoying the benefits that Swift (we hope) will bring you.

We will release this software as SHAREWARE because we feel that sysops are
being  forced into paying for the development of new Hydra BIDIRECTIONAL 
transfer system for /X. The scene is a funny old place and a BBS running old
versions of the BBS software will be 'percieved' as being SLOW or LAME by 
its members for not using the 'latest' versions.. Therefore we feel it is 
simply not fair that REGISTERED Sysops should have to spend an extra $55.00
to upgrade to the new system that supports the new hydra protocol. I`m sure 
that both "Big Boss and Major Theft" did actually spent countless hours in
understanding the Hydra protocol (its quite a complex beast!) and 
incorporating this function into /X BBS. So why should sysops NOT pay then? 
Well let me explain something to the uninformed out there. The Hydra Protocol
allows bi-directional transfers along with chat facilities... The PC Users 
have been enjoying these features for quite some time now. BUT Let me 
explain;

             The "HYDRA" Protocol © is actually PUBLIC-DOMAIN!

The specifications and Example source-code already WORKING on the Amiga 
is in the public-domain. The protocol system was ported over to the Amiga
by the author of Term 3.4 so why pay $55.00 upgrade for 'allergy' PD
Hydra protocol support?

You may all be asking yourselves by now, "How much will Swift cost then?"
Well Swift-Professional is to compete with Ami-Express 4.00 in the market
place. We hope we have implemented and are implementing features which
appeal to you as a sysop and user alike (sorry about the added security 
measures hackers!) As we are scene members ourselves ( I have been for
over 8 years now, back in the old days of BAMIGA-SECTOR ONE, ORACLE, 
THE ACCUMULATORS, etc) we feel we owe the scene a contribution in some
way.. we hope this program will be it. So because of this and because
we feel the prices to update to Ami-Express are so ridiculously HIGH
our prices will be ridiculously LOW!

We will release this product under the Concept of "SHAREWARE". Please respect
our wishes and pay this $15.00 if and when you decided to use the program. 
The program will be supplied with >NO< copy-protection or limitations but if
you do register we will make sure you obtain copies of the updates as soon as
they are released and you will support future development of this project.. 

if we do not get much support we may shelve the whole project and let you 
pay LightSpeed Technology Prices!


Below is the Ami-Express pricing chart (as of June 29th, 1994)

                     Notes To LightSpeed Technologies
		   ¯ ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ ¯

"Swift-Professional" is NOT meant to be an attack on LST, we where to 
release Swift in a few months anyway.. All we are doing now is releasing 
the specifications early so people can choose for themselves if they want
to pay the (we feel) the rather high upgrade price or wait for Swift to 
be completed...


                            Notes To Joe Hodge
			  ¯ ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ ¯

Hi Joe, This is 2-Cool, sorry that it didn`t work out propery about us 
working together on /X4.x. I just felt like a piggy in the middle when
attempting to develop and aid development of /X with you. I respect your
work but I feel that the business side of things has got a little out
of hand at LST and prices are far to high in my mind. Hopefully the release
of Swift will not break our friendship. I simply just wanted to develop
a BBS System to the best of my abilities, sorry if I`m tredding into your
territory with this one. Sorry if it hits sales, but I remeber you telling
me that you didn`t care about the money side of things anyway since you
did`nt make any money out of express.. The same goes for me, I don`t plan
to make any REAL money out of swift either, I just wanted to write a really
GOOD BBS. As I said, I tried helping to upgrade /X but without any real
commitment from LST and now the inflated upgrade prices that your 'business'
friends at LST are trying to market express at I just feel a little let
down. I mean, you didn`t even give me a working copy of /X to play with,
let alone any workable source-code! Don`t forget that I wrote and helped 
you with the password encryption, etc. among other things and fresh ideas. 
Ah well, sorry it had to end like this with Swift becoming a rival BBS... 
I will hopefully voice chat to you in the near future m8..




                        Notes to Sigma on S-Express
		      ¯ ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ ¯

Hi man! How are you now? hope your A4000 got fixed.. I`ve been real busy
with Swift.. (as you can see) smile ):- Hope to chat with you again soon 
m8, oh and if you want S-Express to 100% support encrypted passwords in a
compatible way to /X3.xx let me know.. I`ll supply you with the source
Also I`ll chuck you my implementation of the 'Hydra' Bi-directional
transfer protocol so you can add it into S-Express... Lets make this
show a 3 horse race man!!!! l8rs...

Also quick hi`s to PICARD / USS Enterprise (USA)... Yoooooooohooo!!!



                           Notes to P0t-Noodle
			 ¯ ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ ¯

So Potty do you mind if I implement your Dupe-checker into Swift? Thanx
for the source-code to it...still managed to find some optimizations to
do.. hehehe (very well coded tho m8! nice one...)




                           Notes to Marc Panther
			 ¯ ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ ¯

Ok marc, if you bug me enough,.....MAYBE I`ll make Swift work with a
boring old MC68000 ):- hehehe



                             Notes to Skylark
			   ¯ ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ ¯

Hope you get this msg bro! So are the options in Swift worth the wait
or what? Makes my NodeSnoop door look a little tame eh? hehehe


                               Notes to RAD!
                             ¯ ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ ¯

Not much longer to wait now m8... hope we get the calls sorted out so
I can have some more nice kewl chats with you again... thanx for all
the suggestions and ideas you wrote...  see, you got "Private" Sysop
mail in the end ... ):-


                            Notes to FireFlash
                          ¯ ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ ¯

Its nearly finished,.. Its nearly finished,.. Its nearly finished,..
Well very nearly now anyway.. sorry bout not giving you a beta preview
but anyay Its nearly finished,..









           CONTACT 2-COOL (THE AUTHOR OF SWIFT) FOR SUGGESTIONS,
                         IDEAS, IMPROVEMENTS, ETC.
