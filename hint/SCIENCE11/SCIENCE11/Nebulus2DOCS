The 'UP' Towers :
-----------------

	The only aim on the 'up' towers is to reach the top of the towers
	and activate the tower self-destruct button inside the final door
	at the top of each tower.

The 'DOWN' towers :
------------------

	Pogo is beamed onto the upper-most platform of the tower he has just
	just destructed. He must then proceed down the tower, repairing
	as many of the broken platforms as possible as he goes.
	Pogo has to repair at least 80% of the tower's platforms before he's
	allowed to leave the tower via the lower door!

Tower objects and features :
----------------------------

	Around the towers, there are several different objects and features
	that Pogo must use to enable him to continue up/down the Towers.
	These are as follows :

LIFTS:
------

	These are used to carry Pogo from one level of the tower to another.
	They are controlled by standing on them and moving the joystick in
	the direction you wish to travel (up/down). Some of the lifts stop
	at more than only one position!

SWITCHES:
---------
	
	These are used to change some element of the tower. e.g.: make a 
	parcel appear, make a dynamite plunger appear (woooom), make a door
	appear, etc ... To use them, just stand over them and press fire
	button.

TOWER PUSHER:
-------------

	These appear in different guises on every tower such as dragons,
	electronic orbs, opening parcels etc. They push Pogo off the edge 
	of the platform in front of them , if he tries to walk past them.
	To destroy them use dynamite plungers.

DYNAMITE PLUNGERS:
------------------

	These are used for destroying the tower pushers. Just press fire
	when standing over them, the plunger will be depressed and within
	a couple of seconds the pusher will explode allowing Pogo to pass.

MOVING PLATFORMS:
-----------------

	These are metallic(a) platforms with flashing left/right arrows on
	them. When standing on them push up your joystick and you will 
	travel round the tower horizontally until you get hit by a solid
	object or something knocks you off the platform.

TRANSPORTER PLATFORM:
---------------------

	These are metallic platforms with either a black up or down arrow
	on them. They are used for transporting Pogo up/down the tower.
	See 'THE WEAPONS' for more info.

SPRINGBOARDS:
-------------

	They appear as bouncing platforms. If Pogo jumps on them they 
	allow him to jump great heights to shoot enemies in upper parts
	of the tower. To reach greater heights push up joystick each time
	Pogo lands on the board after each jump.

DISSOLVONG PLATFORM:
--------------------

	These are different in appearence to the normal platforms and when
	Pogo jumps on them they start to dissapear, so move quickly!

ORAGANIC GLUE PLATFORMS:
------------------------

	They appear as bubbling platforms and slower down Pogo's speed by
	walking over them.

MAGIC PLATFORMS:
----------------

	Sometimes when it appears there is no way for Pogo to go magic
	platforms appear building a bridge for Pogo to cross.


THE WEAPONS
-----------

         AS YOU TRAVEL UP AND DOWN THE TOWERS THERE ARE SVERAL PARCELS
         IN EACH OF THESE PARCELS IS AN EXTRA WEAPON TO AID POGO IN HIS
         QUEST. TO PICK UP A WEAPON JUST WALK INTO THE PARCEL, THEN SELECT
	 WHICH WEAPON YOU REQUIRE BY MOVING THE FLASHING ICON IN THE 
	 LOWER PANEL TO THE WAEPON SYMBOL YOU WANT AND PRESS FIRE.
	 YOU ARE CARRYING THE SELECTED WEAPON. A MAXIMUM OF 5 OF EACH
	 WEAPONG CAN BE CARRIED AT A TIME. 



THE WEAPONS ARE AS FOLLOWS:
---------------------------

KEYS       - THERE OPEN LOCKED DOORS.

ROCKET     - WHEN POGO USES THIS ROCKET TO FLY AROUND THE TOWER IT KILLS
             EVERYTHING IN ITS PATH.

MAGNET     - SOME PLATFORMS ARE MAGNETIC AND THE MAGNET CAN BE USED TO PULL
             POGO UP TO THE PLATFORM ABOVE HIM. MAGNETIC PLATFORMS ARE
             INDICATED BY A FLASHING MAGNET ICON ON SCREEN AS POGO WALK
             BELOW THEM.

ALL SEEING - POGO USES A PERSONAL 'FLYMAN' HELMET TO FLY AROUND THE TOWER
       EYE   THE TOWER ALLOWING HIM TO ABSERVE WHAT DANGERS LIE AHEAD.

JUMPING... - THESE BOOTS HAVE SPECIAL AIR FILLED SOLES THAT GIVES POGO
     BOOTS   A MUCH BIGGER SPRING TO HIS STEP.

MATTER...  - WHEN COLLECTED THESE ALLOW POGO TO USE SPECIAL TRANSPORTER
TRANSPORTER  PLATFORMS TO TRANSPORT HIM FROM ONE PART OF A TOWER TO ANOTHER!.
             THE TRANSPORTER PLATFORMS HAVE ARROWS ON THEM, POINTING ON
             THE DIRECTION THEY WILL TRANSPORT POGO. ONCE THE TRANSPORTER
             HAS BEEN SELECTED PUSH UP ON YOUR JOYSTICK TO BEGIN
             TRANSPORTING.
