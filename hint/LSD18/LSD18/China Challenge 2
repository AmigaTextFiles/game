New features of Version II:
---------------------------

1) If you look at the Options Menu, you can see two new items:
   a) Save Dragon:
      With this option, you can save the current dragon on
      the screen to disk. After you activate "Save Dragon",
      the Workbenchscreen will appear with a small window on
      it. Just type the name of the Dragon's data file.
      The Playscreen comes up again and you can continue
      with another game.
   b) Load Dragon:
      With this option, you can load a saved dragon. The
      input window will appear. Type in the filename of the
      saved dragon. If this file exists, China Challenge
      will load the dragon into memory and displays it on
      the screen.

2) In the first Version, you can only take back one move,
   but the wrong pair is mostly taken many moves before.
   In China Challenge II, you can take back every move you
   did without any restrictions.

3) China Challenge II now plays a little background music
   during the game. Enjoy it...

The dragons are saved as ASCII files, so it is rather easy
to edit these files with a normal text editor.
So you can design your own dragons with your own difficulty
level. Please notice that there must be four tiles of each
symbol. Otherwise, you create unsolvable dragons.

CHINA CHALLENGE II is Freeware !  Please copy it...
