THE GAME

THE GAME SIS DIVIDED INTO SIX LEVELS.  THE FIRST FIVE PUT YOU IN CONTROL OF
THE PLANETEERS IN TURN - EACH SET IN A DIFFERENT LOCATION AND WITH
DIFFERENT ENEMIES.

BEFORE EACH LEVEL 'GAIA' EXPLAINS YOUR QUEST TO YOU.  SHE WILL ALSO WARN OF
THE POTENTIAL DANGERS THAT LIE AHEAD - LISTEN TO WHAT SHE SAYS AND YOU WILL
FIND THE QUEST EASIER.

ONCE YOU HAVE COMLETED THE LEVEL, 'GAIA' WILL SHOW YOU AN EXIT SIGN WHICH
APPEARS ON SCREEN SHOWING WHICH WAY TO GO TO ESCAPE THE LEVEL.

LEVEL ONE
FIRE LEVEL

THE PRINCE OF POLLUTION SLY SLUDGE IS SENDING UP BALLOONS FILLED WITH THE
HARMFUL CFC GAS TO DESTROY THE OZONE LAYER, TURNING THE PLANET INTO A HUGE
SUN RESORT FOR HIM TO BUILD HOTELS AND BEACHES AND RUIN THE EARTH AS WE
KNOW IT! ITS UP TO YOU TO FOIL THIS MANIACS EVIL SCHEME.

ABOVE THE OXONE LAYER ARE THE ONLY SURVIVORS OF AN ENDANGERED SPECIES OF
SEAL (!?!?!) THE ONLY WAY THEY CAN RETURN TO THEIR NATURAL HABITAT
IS TO WALK ACROSS THE OZONE LAYER WHICH IS IN NEED OF REPAIR.  YOU MUST
REPAIR THE LAYER BY COLLECTING OZONE IN THE GEO-CRUISER AND DROPPING IT
ONTO THE DISAPPEARING LAYER TO REJUVENATE IT.

WHEELERS CONTROLS

USE THE JOYSTICK OR KEYBOARD TO RUN AND JUMP AROUND PART OF THIS LEVEL. 
FIRE WILL SEND OUT A FIRE BURST IN THE DIRECTION YOU ARE FACING TO REMOVE
THE CANISTERS.  WHILST FALLING USE FIRE TO CREATE A BALLOON TO BREAK YOUR
FALL.  SHOOT SLUDGES BALLOONS WITH THE GEO-CRUISER TO PREVENT FURTHER
DAMAGE TO THE OZONE.  TRY TO RESCUE FALLING PARACHUTES TO GET A BONUS. 
COLLECT DROPLETS FROM THE OZONE PIPE ON THE ROOF OF THE GEO-CRUISER AND
DEPOSIT THE FLUID ON THE LAYER TO PATCH UP HOLES.

LEVEL 2
WATER LEVEL

LOOTEN PLUNDER HAS STOLEN THE DOLPHINS!  THE DERANGED VILLAIN HAS
IMPRISONED THEM IN A CRUEL WATER PRISON AND WILL NEVER LET THEM BACK INTO
THE SEA UNLESS YOU USE THE GI AND THE POWER OF WATER TO STOP HIM.

THE DOLPHINS MUST BE GIVEN A SAFE ROUTE FROM THEIR TANKS IN THE SKY.  MAKE
SURE THE WATER POOLS ARE FULL BEFORE RELEASING THEM - AND THAT THE SEA IS
CLEAN ENOUGH FOR THEM TO SWIM IN.  USE THE ECO-SUB TO CLEAR OUT THE
POLLUTING CANS OF NUCLEAR WASTE FROM THE SEA TO MAKE IT BLUE AGAIN.

GI'S CONTROLS

USE NORMAL KEY AND JOYSTICK CONTROLS TO MOVE ABOUT.  FIRE SENDS OUT AN ICE
PLATFORM.  JUMP ON THE PLATFORMS TO MAKE YOUR WAY ROUND THE SCREEN.

FALLS, USE FIRE TO CREATE AN ICE SLIDE SO SHE CAN GLIDE TO SAFETY.  TO
ACTIVATE THE ECO-SUB, FALL INTO THE TOP OF IT.

DESTROY THE FORMER KINGS RESTING PLACE.

USING LINKAS POWER OF WIND YOU MUST CREATE CYCLONES TO WHISK AWAY BOMS AND
DISCARDED RUBBISH TO SAVE THE PYRAMID AND ITS TREASURES FROM DESTRUCTION.

FAIL, YOU TOO WILL BE DESTROYED IN THE BLAST.  ONLY WHEN ALL BOMBS HAVE
BEEN DEACTIVATED WILL BLIGHT NAKE GOOD HER ESCAPE.
