Well here are some quick doc's for Blue Max, as far as I know there
are only a few keys to really worry about.
It would appear that two can play the game at the same time, as seems to be
many keys assigned that do the same things (like Views, fire guns, etc..) 
on keyboard


+ & F4            :Back view (from the cockpit)

9 & F1            :Front view

0 & F2            :Left View

- & F3            :Right View

F5 & Backspace    :Chase Plane? view from rear

F9                :Instrument/Damage/Plane attitude screen

+ - on keypad controls throttle

Keypad controls plane if you don't have a joystick.

Space bar/Return/Tab :All fire weapons

ESC   :Exit Mission, back to main menu


While this does not look as nice as some of the screens I have seen from 

Red Baron, it does look very good in VGA, but sometimes the program aborts back

to DOS with overflows etc.., not a common occurence, but a bit annoying. This

has to be one of the best games 360 Software has ever released. However someone

might release a cheat as I keep getting shot down!

Greets to Doctor PJ, Byter, Phantom, Slavelord.
