                          A walk through by Floyd Gillen

  First a little about this walk through, I will tell you what you need,where
 to get it,where to use it and the right questions to ask the right people.
 I will tell you where to go by map names and numbered locations on the maps.
 At the end of this walk through I will tell you the NPC'S Want TO KNOW or 
 need so you can get what you need.
  Somethings beginners should know, add points to your scouting or you will
 not be able to find anything and add points to your thief's skulduggery and
 don't change your thief's profession because it's skulduggery + level 
 that = open doors.
 Now search map "Castle LEVEL"for what ever items you can find then go to
 the north wall where you will find a gate, to the right of the gate you will
 find a button use the search command to open the gate, then go "A" and
 search and you will find a key of ramm.
