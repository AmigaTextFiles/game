  @{b}About the DCBoT Spoilers@{ub}
  Initial release, version 0.5.

These spoilers are the result of many people's contributions over a period
of many months. We believe them to be accurate as of ADOM version
0.9.9gamma6, but there may be inaccuracies due to rapid changes due to game
development, bad research, or just plain human (or dwarvish, elvish,
orcish, you get the idea) error. The Drakalor Chain Board of Tourism is not
responsible for any character deaths, maiming, close calls, or other
terrible things that might happen when using this information, whether the
information given is correct or not.

In many places, the version variations have been noted, especially where
new items or skills have been introduced.
If you have contributions or corrections to make to these spoilers, please
contact Richard Fowler, thinker@texas.net In this first release, many
things are not included which are known, but time constraints did not allow
their inclusion before release.

  @{b}The Nasty And Not So Nasty Effects Of Corruption@{ub}

     These appear randomly and re-appear randomly (ver. 0.9.9+) if removed.
Some of the corruptions have work-arounds, but many do not.

@{b}You grow a bulging cranium: Le: +6, Wi: +4, Ap: -6, PV: -4, To: -3@{ub}
     You gain more skill increases with each level, but it costs you in
     hitpoint increases. Not so bad if you are already buff.

@{b}You become very light: 1/10 weight, St: -6, Dx: +4, To: -6, Ap: -6@{ub}
     The strength decrease means you'll probably have to drop some stuff,
     and the toughness drop is bad for future hitpoints. This is half of the
     requirement to enter the quickling tree.

@{b}You becomes extremely thin and nimble: 1/2 weight, DV: +6@{ub}
     This is the other half needed to enter the quickling tree.

@{b}You look somewhat apish: St: +3, Le: -1, Wi: -1, Ch: -2, Ap: -3@{ub}

@{b}Your skin becomes covered by tough scales: PV: +8, Dx: -6, Ap: -4@{ub}

@{b}You begin to rage: DV: -9, +6 melee damage@{ub}
     Note that the reduction in DV makes you easier to hit (and to corrupt
     further).

@{b}You start emitting an unholy aura: Ch: -10, DV: +6@{ub}
     Things start running away from you, which makes chatting quite
     difficult

@{b}Close attunement to the astral plane allows teleportation.@{ub}
     You start teleporting randomly; this can be useful if you have
     teleport control, or very annoying if you don't.

@{b}You grow thorns on your hands: 3d3 melee damage, Dx: -2, Ap: -3@{ub}

@{b}You grow antennae which sense distant life forms: Ap: -4@{ub}
     You sense intelligent beings, even through stone. Great for detecting
     vaults before opening the door, but you won't see the oozes.

@{b}Poison drips from your hands.@{ub}
     Adds poison to attack, turns all potions touched into poison, curses
     any food touched.
     Work-around: wear "thick gauntlets."

@{b}You become a living mana battery.@{ub}
     Touching wands drains them of all charges and increases your total
     Mana. Remember that drained wands are not totally useless.

@{b}Your corrupted tissue heals at an accelerated rate.@{ub}
     You heal more quickly, but it leaves scars which reduce both your
     appearance and your dexterity.

@{b}Your feet transform into hooves: +8 kicking damage, Dx: -6@{ub}

@{b}You grow horns: +3 melee damage, Ap: -4@{ub}

@{b}You start to exhale sulphur: Ch: -4@{ub}
     This also gives you the ability to spit a corrosive acid.

@node "Herbs" "Herblore Of The Chain"

@{b}How Does Your Garden Grow?@{ub}

Herbs can be found in underground areas, growing according to Conway's Life
(Any square with exactly 3 herbs adjacent to it will support an herb in the
next round of growth, any square with 2 adjacent herbs will remain the
same). If you want to farm herbs over the entire game, I advise picking
stray plants until they wither and die, leaving 2x2 squares of the herbs
you want over the long term. These 2x2 squares will remain, and will fill
in any one corner that you over-harvest. This way you can pick herbs from
any cluster until one corner withers, then leave it for a while (until the
corner fills in). Then harvest again.

If you don't have the herbalism skill, you won't be very efficient at
removing herbs without damaging the plant, so they'll wither fairly
quickly. Also, all of the herbs you pick will be cursed. The herbalism
skill allows more samples to be picked before the plant dies, and fewer of
the picked herbs are cursed (100 skill results in most herbs being
blessed). The herbalism skill will give you a chance of identifying
plants/herbs each time the plant is examined. Without this, other methods
of identification must be used.

@{b}So, what are the herbs?@{ub}

Some herbs occur in pairs that are taken from the same plants; these pairs
counter each other's effects. The herbs are:

     stomafillia/stomacemptia
     curaria mancox/devil's rose
     alraunia antidote/demon daisies
     pepper petal/burb root
     morgia root
     spenseweed
     moss of mareilon

Herb bushes have a hierarchy of strengths, so, once identified, you know
how close a bush is to disappearing. The bushes regenerate every turn
(growth cycle) you leave them alone.

Hierarchy:
     full of blooms
     strong
     withered
     *poof* gone

This means you are going to get a better harvest from the healthier plants,
so when collecting, you can safely get every last possible herb from a set
of plants, and better govern the growth of the larger shapes that always
seem to get away from me (which is why I stick with the simple squares).

                                            stomach)

 Some have said that burb root develops Willpower, but it's never worked
 for me. It has no effect on those who are acid resistant.

 Morgia seems to credit the Toughness category first, and after a certain
 overflow, begins to credit Willpower as well. So only eating a few at a
 time exercises Toughness, but large quantities in a short period of time
 exercise both Willpower and Toughness.

     Stomafillia can be a lifesaver when hunger is an issue. Stomacemptia
is great when you've got lots of intrinsic-granting corpses and want to eat
them all for the nutritional benefits.

     Pepper petals and spenseweeds are great (if blessed) in those
dangerous situations where healing is required.

     Long term character development is greatly aided by the use of morgia
roots and moss of mareilon. These are great for development beyond 20,
where training becomes too expensive. These herbs, along with potions of
exchange and balance, are one way to develop extremely powerful
well-rounded characters.

@node "MesLev" "Level Messages"

@{b}Level Messages@{ub}

These are messages you get when entering a level for the first time that
indicate either a unique level, or that something interesting has been
created on that level.

@{b}You feel excited.@{ub}
     Somewhere on this level is a large monster nest (a room full of
     critters, frequently harder than level, usually with a trapped
     door so they can get out and swarm you).

@{b}You feel really excited.@{ub}
     About half the level is a really scary monster vault, usually filled
     with Emperor liches. It also probably contains at least a couple of
     artifacts. I've lost powerful game winners to this level.

@{b}You feel an intense tension.@{ub}
     This will only happen once, and only fairly deep in the Caverns of
     Chaos. The battle bunny level.

@{b}You feel a surge of power.@{ub}
     An artifact is lying around somewhere on the level (but probably not
     unguarded). This no longer occurs in the infiinite dungeon.

@{b}You shudder.@{ub}
     This one is fairly rare. There is a special trap room on the level
     (this is a room in which much (more than half) of the floor is trapped,
     not a good place to hang out unless you've found them all and just love
     being cruel to things that insist on following you around). If one of
     the traps is of the fireball variety, be very careful about what else
     is in the room with you.

@{b}The air of this level is filled with a strange smell.@{ub}
     Only in the Caverns of Chaos; somewhere on the level the si can be
     found (always before Dwarftown). It sits on a trap, so kick it aside
     before picking it up (if possible).

@{b}This level somehow seems to be removed from the rest of the world.@{ub}
     Another unique level in the Caverns of Chaos. This is where
     kitty-karma catches up with you; the realm of the Master Cat.

@{b}You go down the staircase...the stairs are very long!!!@{ub}
     The theory is that the game was just taking too long to generate the
     level, and so Thomas had it make the excuse that the stairs were long,
     and so it was taking a while to get there. Nothing special has been
     noted about the level generated after one of these messages.

@{b}You feel like you did something very stupid.@{ub}
     This only occurs in the infinite dungeon, and only when the level you
     just left had an artifact on it that you left behind. It's gone the
     way of the level, although could be randomly generated again.

@{b}The chaos level in the infinite dungeon@{ub}
     This is a unique level in the infinite dungeon; it is very colorful
     and contains a Chaos artifact and its guardian. Once you leave the
     level, it and all of its contents will vanish and be unavailable for
     the duration of the game.

@{b}You hear "Thumb"@{ub}

 Poison resist        "Your throat is rough and your "Your stomach stings

 Lucky                "You feel lucky."              "You feel cheated."

 In versions prior to 0.9.4, there was also a "very lucky" intrinsic that
 has been replaced by Fate smiling and the appropriate messages.

 Fate smiles upon you "You feel very lucky."         "You feel very bad
                                                     off."

 Cursed               "You sense trouble."           "You feel relieved."

                      invis:"You feel transparent.") ("?")
 Able to see
 invisible things     "Your eyes tingle."            "Your eyes sting."

 Sleep resist         "You feel totally awake."      "You feel tired. ?"

 Mute                 "You feel a lump in your       "?"

 Healing rate changed "Your blood seems to course    "Your blood cools
                      faster"                        down."

@{b}Not about intrinsics@{ub}

"A truly strange sensation floods your entire body." Dex increases while
Toughness decreases

"Extremely glibbery meat" It could've granted fire resistance, but either
you already had it or you missed the roll to get it

"Extremely fat meat" Either it was a hobbit or something that might've
increased your strength, but you either missed the roll or already had a
higher strength than the monster.

"Extremely tough meat." This has a significantly better enjoyment (and
possibly food) value when cooked and so made "Soft and delicious."

 Teleport control    "You feel like jumping      "You no longer feel like
                     around."                    jumping around."

 Paralysis resist    "You are moved by the sheer "You feel inflexible?"

@node "Spells" "A Magic Users Guide To Spells"

@{b}The Ancardian Spell Book@{ub}

Spells are listed alphabetically; if the spell has different wizardly and
priestly names, the priestly name appears second. Note that in learning
spells from spellbooks, improvements can be made either by increasing the
remaining usage (usually in the hundreds), or by decreasing the power
points (pp) used in casting the spell. The minimum pp usage is listed after
the spell's effects. 

Note that since one of the 0.9.9 versions, the pp cost to cast a spell may
vary with the day of the month. On Silvernight, Lawful casters expend only
half the power points to cast spells; I suspect the same with Chaotics on
Darknight. (If you cannot confirm, let me know as it might be a special
effect of a particular birth month.) Also, values will be slightly lower
for those born in the month of the wand.

@node "Rumour" "I Heard The Other Day..."

@{b}Rumor & Truth@{ub}

Each rumor, followed by my interpretation of it or its truth.

@{b}A sharp axe is easier to wield than a sharp wit.@{ub}

@{b}All roads lead to chaos, in the end.@{ub}
     No matter which alignment path you choose, you'll end up at the gate
     or as a chaotic blob.

@{b}Always consider the consequences of yer deeds lest ye be surprised.@{ub}
     Think before you act, because others will react, especially the gods.

@{b}Always watch your back!@{ub}
     Don't let yourself get surrounded.

@{b}An anvil is nothing more than an oversized ingot of iron.@{ub}
     And it will rust just like one, too.

@{b}Be as resistant as you can.@{ub}
     Collect resistances for your own sake.

@{b}Being light as a feather makes you very rifty.@{ub}
     The rift is much safer if you are not burdened.

@{b}Care for more intelligent monsters.@{ub}

@{b}Don't believe everything *they* say.@{ub}
     Not all rumors are true!

@{b}Dragons want items made from their hide back.@{ub}
     In fact they get downright violent about seeing their skins worn by
     others.

@{b}Eating a demon daisy will make you a demon lover.@{ub}
     False, it'll just make you sick/poisoned.

@{b}Feeding rust monsters is costly but definitely worth it.@{ub}
     If you need to get away, give them some metal to munch on.

@{b}Gift shops are overpriced, unless you use a five finger discount.@{ub}
     The gift shop is overpriced, and theft is the only way to get
     everything you might want.

@{b}If you are doomed, this will be the last fortune you ever read.@{ub}
     It's that hard to survive when doomed. It's doomed, after all.

@{b}If you eat the heart of a Dragon, you will share in its strength.@{ub}
     As long as you interpret its strength as its special releation to
     certain elements. Eat dragon corpses to gain their resistances.

@{b}If you lick a Karmic Lizard, you can get high.@{ub}
     Or at least higher luck; but you have to eat it, too.

@{b}In the land of eternal darkness, light must come from within.@{ub}

@{b}It takes an iron stomach to eat black dragon steak.@{ub}
     So if you eat one, you must have an iron stomach (resistant to acid).

@{b}Join DARK (*D*ragons *a*gainst *r*easonable *k*illing).@{ub}

@{b}Living sacrifices are the most valuable of all.@{ub}
     The gods really like living sacrifices, but more than artifacts?

@{b}Look for strange items.@{ub}
     Because they are quite helpful in several circumstances.

@{b}MADE: Mindcrafters Against Drunken Explorers@{ub}

@{b}Remember to write something on this cookie.@{ub}

@{b}Rifts are deep.@{ub}

@{b}Smoking is bad for your health!@{ub}

@{b}Some gems harbour magical powers.@{ub}
     True--light, power, darkness, knowledge--just use them and find out.

@{b}The coin of chaos has two faces -- power and corruption.@{ub}
     The one is paid for with the other.

@{b}The Mad Minstrel harbours a dark secret.@{ub}

@{b}They say fortunes must be followed by the incantation 'in bed' to work.@{ub}
     This is only true if you're in bed at the time.

@{b}They say that a good memory might pay.@{ub}

@{b}They say that all white dragons suffer from a bad cold.@{ub}

@{b}They say that an empty stomach is one's worst enemy.@{ub}

     If you're getting hit anyway, go berserk and maybe you'll manage to
     kill them first.

@{b}They say that at times things can get zorky.@{ub}
     There are several Zork references in the Drakalor Chain.

@{b}They say that attacking shopkeepers is bad for your karma.@{ub}
     It could just curse you (or doom you?).

@{b}They say that being able to read is very useful when visiting the library.@{ub}
     It's the only way to take advantage of what's there.

@{b}They say that Berzio potions are useful for taming monsters.@{ub}

@{b}They say that blessed items improve one's eyesight.@{ub}

@{b}They say that boozed bozos can be very helpful.@{ub}
     So give the fool some booze and find out.

@{b}They say that bugs can be really nasty.@{ub}
     Poison, swarming, and they're just gross.

@{b}They say that burning torches can be very dangerous.@{ub}
     They cause more damage than non-burning ones.

@{b}They say that champions may pray for more favours than ordinary people.@{ub}
     They sure can!

@{b}They say that companions fear darkness.@{ub}
     They tend to lose their masters.

@{b}They say that controlled teleportation is really great.@{ub}
     It is!

     Sometimes it wins the conversion test.

@{b}They say that cursed potions of invisibility might have strange effects.@{ub}
     They make you invisible to yourself, but not to anyone else.

@{b}They say that cursed thieves picks might do strange things.@{ub}

@{b}They say that dark elves are especially good in the night.@{ub}

@{b}They say that distortion is the way to godhood.@{ub}
     Chaos godhood only.

@{b}They say that drinking black potions during the night corrupts your soul.@{ub}
     Nah!

@{b}They say that eating beings of true evil corrupts your very essence.@{ub}
     Eating the Orb guardians corrupts your essence, not just your body
     (and so cannot be cured).

@{b}They say that eating humans is evil.@{ub}
     Or just chaotic (unlawful).

@{b}They say that eating magic-wielding monsters might be a boon for your mana.@{ub}
     They sometimes increase your mana by a point or more!

@{b}They say that elves trade strength of body for speed.@{ub}
     Eating them increases dexterity, but reduces toughness.

@{b}They say that essence of marellion moss is proof against the undead.@{ub}

@{b}They say that every coin has two sides.@{ub}

@{b}They say that excitement is a messenger of battle.@{ub}
     And if you feel excited, there's a large nest on the level.

@{b}They say that fire is the most violent element.@{ub}
     You must three times as resistant to it than other elements.

@{b}They say that gambling is bad for your finances.@{ub}
     Only if you lose; or if you win too much.

@{b}They say that gods like sacrifices of food and valuable stuff.@{ub}
     They sure don't dislike them.

@{b}They say that good gamblers know which coins they have to use.@{ub}

@{b}They say that graveyards are dangerous places.@{ub}
     You can lose strength, toughness, or life!

     Frequently they have a named creature and an artifact in them.

@{b}They say that green pools contain deadly slime.@{ub}

@{b}They say that herb bushes grow according to magical patterns.@{ub}
     That old Conway magic. (See @{"Herbs" link "Herbs" 0})

@{b}They say that herbs have strange effects.@{ub}
     Each has its own strange effect.

@{b}They say that hobbits don't like shoes.@{ub}
     It reduces their dexterity.

@{b}They say that holy water might bear fruits.@{ub}
     Try using it on an herb plant.

@{b}They say that Infinity does not permit to visit any place twice.@{ub}
     Levels are generated randomly, and you can never go back.

@{b}They say that it is not wise to leave one's cause after being crowned to be
a champion.@{ub}
     The god who crowned you will find a punishment.

@{b}They say that it might be useful to remain persistent with uncharged wands.@{ub}
     Eventually they will work once more.

@{b}They say that it might come in handy to discover a use for useless potions.@{ub}
     There is a use for them, but not until late in the game; you will be
     rewarded.

@{b}They say that Khelavaster is still alive.@{ub}
     He is; it's just a matter of time until you find him.

@{b}They say that kicking a stuck door helps.@{ub}
     As long as it isn't trapped.

@{b}They say that kicking stairs helps to train your strength.@{ub}
     Well, maybe after a while.

@{b}They say that kicking stairs might be bad for your health.@{ub}
     Only if the dungeon comes crashing down on top of you.

@{b}They say that killing cats is bad for your karma.@{ub}
     It sure won't endear you to the Cat Lord.

@{b}They say that killing friends won't help you finding new ones.@{ub}

@{b}They say that merchants are really well-spoken thieves.@{ub}

@{b}They say that monsters tamed by bards will never willingly leave.@{ub}

@{b}They say that monuments can hold dark secrets.@{ub}
     The monument to Infinity hides a Chaotic secret. And statues might
     hold less dark secrets.

@{b}They say that nobody ever heard the wail of the Banshee more than once.@{ub}
     It causes a lot of damage, usually enough to kill the first time it is
     heard.

@{b}They say that not all herbs must be eaten.@{ub}
     Some must be used, and others mixed.

@{b}They say that once you have opened the final gate there is no way back.@{ub}

@{b}They say that pools contain mysterious secrets.@{ub}
     But I'm not telling.

more than just your alcohol level.@{ub}

     They have a pretty good food value.

     Yes, but not too often.

     They increase your lawfulness.

     Don't bug them unless you've done enough to keep them happy.

@{b}They say that rubbing moss of mareilon onto your skin might get you moving.@{ub}
     Using it will exercise your dexterity.

     Wands.

     Like wonder and ball lightening.

     Just ask him!

@{b}They say that the banshee transformed after losing her beloved husband.@{ub}
     And so she might be transformed again by another husband.

@{b}They say that the cat lord finds no fault with ye if ye never harmed any
cat.@{ub}
     In fact, he rewards you.

     Sure, but who knows where the dungeons of mystery are? These are the
     Caverns of Chaos.

@{b}They say that the forces of Law built a monument to Infinity.@{ub}
     But it has been corrupted, and is now the infinite dungeon.

@{b}They say that the gods do not yearn for material wealth.@{ub}
     They don't know what they're talking about.

     Greatly.

@{b}They say that the great rift is very dangerous for almost everyone.@{ub}
     Very true.

@{b}They say that the guild of industrious brutal muggers writes really
confusing manuals.@{ub}
     Just read one and see, but backup first.

@{b}They say that the home of the banshee is ruled by eternal decay.@{ub}

     Good thing he left a Royal Guard.

@{b}They say that the library charges high fees.@{ub}

@{b}They say that the mint-flavored juice distilled out of morgia roots
improves stamina, slakes thirst and conceals bad breath.@{ub}
     Toughness and wisdom.

@{b}They say that the radiance of chaos will corrupt you the faster the deeper
you descend.@{ub}
     Depth accelerates the process even more.

@{b}They say that the secret to becoming a Chaos God is hidden in the Drakalor
Chain.@{ub}
     In pieces in various places, yes.

@{b}They say that there are many gems deep under the mountains.@{ub}

@{b}They say that there is a secret level guarded by many powerful monsters
which contains several artifacts.@{ub}

@{b}They say that thick gauntlets are great for isolating your hands.@{ub}
     Isolating them from, say, other things. Use against poison hands.

@{b}They say that those who hear the wail of the banshee are doomed.@{ub}
     It does lots of damage, but doesn't doom.

@{b}They say that those, who manage to empty a pool, will receive a wish.@{ub}
     Only if they're extremely lucky.

@{b}They say that tiny caves can be very large.@{ub}
     Yes, they can.

@{b}They say that to be a champion of one's cause is very valuable when using
ancient magic.@{ub}
     Artifacts are tiring to use, but less so for champions.

@{b}They say that too much chaos essence corrupts thy inner self.@{ub}
     Don't eat it!

@{b}They say that true berserkers fight naked.@{ub}
     They also die young, but what the heck!

@{b}They say that using artifacts costs a lot of energy.@{ub}
     You'll need to eat more to compensate. Using some of them corrupts.

@{b}They say that wands of knocking might split your skull.@{ub}
     Or the skull of another.

@{b}They say that when you hear a "Hurumph!" you'd better start to run.@{ub}
     Because things that make that noise can be very dangerous.

@{b}They say that you might find gems on the deep levels.@{ub}

@{b}They say that you need a strong will to enter the great rift.@{ub}
     At least 20, much higher to not fall.

@{b}They say that you need to be an expert climber to survive the great rift.@{ub}
     100 climbing, minimum.

@{b}They say that you need to be very experienced to enter the great rift.@{ub}
     At least level 18.

@{b}They say that you only can be the champion of your deity if you are very
close to your deity.@{ub}
     Extremely close would be more accurate.

@{b}They say that you should not slow down in your final fight.@{ub}
     But the creatures there will try to slow you.

@{b}They say that you should seek the heart of the mountains.@{ub}

@{b}They say that you should try to investigate the potential uses of beewax.@{ub}
     It can be very useful.

@{b}They say that you should wish for appearance.@{ub}

@{b}They say that you should wish for charisma.@{ub}

@{b}They say that you should wish for dexterity.@{ub}

@{b}They say that you should wish for friends.@{ub}

@{b}They say that you should wish for wealth.@{ub}

@{b}They say that you should wish for willpower.@{ub}

@{b}They say that you should wish for wishes.@{ub}
     Only the foolish do this.

@{b}They say that you will feel the corrupting incursions of Chaos.@{ub}
     Far too soon.

@{b}They say that you will need a weapon of mass destruction to come closer to
your goal.@{ub}
     It certainly helps.

@{b}They say that your piety depends on your disposition towards all gods of
your pantheon.@{ub}
     If you can keep all the gods of your pantheon happy, your score will
     reflect it.

@{b}They say ye cannot shoot yourself, no matter how hard ye try.@{ub}
     I've managed (but only with magic).

@{b}This cookie will make you pay a high price.@{ub}
    This is a joke.

@{b}Those of Trollish Blood must drink from the Bloody Pool.@{ub}

@{b}Those who guard artifacts are deadly enemies.@{ub}
     Only if they see you.

@{b}To be heavy is not very nift in a deep rift.@{ub}
     Not very nifty, indeed.

@{b}To leave the animated forest you will have to reach the corner opposite of
the entrance.@{ub}
     True.

@{b}Ye dost not need to find some kind of amulet to save the world.@{ub}
     True.

@{b}Your termination is long due.@{ub}
     Uh oh.

@endnode

@node "People" "A Who's Who Of The Chain"

@{b}Terinyo, the village@{ub}

@{b}Munxip the shopkeeper.@{ub} The easiest food source in the beginning.

@{b}Twyat Pare the Sheriff.@{ub} Great for helping lawful character along the way, he
offers two quests. The first is to kill the Raider leader, Kranach, but
will be voided if not completed before the character reaches level 6
(Kranach is no idiot). The second is to bring Hotzenplotz, the Crime lord,
to justice (a completely lawful act if he's already hostile). The first
quests yields 3000 gold, the second an amulet of order. If both are
completed, the Sheriff will teach the Law skill. He gives a 100 gold bounty
for raider corpses, 50-75 for outlaws. He is also the object of a quest
from Hotzenplotz.

@{b}Guth'Alak the Druid.@{ub} Source of a quest to kill Keethrax, a corrupted Druid.
This quest and the elder's quest are mutually exclusive. Also provides a
quest to help the Greater White Unicorn to characters of level 30 or
greater. If given the corpse of a greater chaos creature, he will reward
you with a potion of cure corruption.

@{b}Blup the baby water dragon.@{ub} Will teach the swimming skill if given enough
potions of carrot juice. Finding his mother and telling him her location
will eventually yield the artifact, the runed trident.

@{b}Yggaz the fool.@{ub} Full of rumors, he also trades random potions when given
potions of booze.

@{b}Rynt the village elder.@{ub} Source of the quest to relieve the carpenter, which
is exclusive of the Druid's quest. Completion of the quest yields rewards
from the Carpenter, and reduced prices at the market.

@{b}Yrrigs the Carpenter.@{ub} Crazed by the Village Dungeon, he is the object of the
quest from the elder. Only found here if the quest i speacefully completed.
He can be killed or peacefully rescued, which results
in the healing skill from the healer in the village dungeon for
non-chaotics. His death yields a book of bridge building and a hatchet; his
peaceful rescue also yields a potion of rust removal. He can also verbally
teach/improve bridge building, if sane.


@{b}Lawenilothehl, the outlaw settlement@{ub}

@{b}Barnabas the shopkeeper.@{ub}

@{b}Yergius the Master Thief.@{ub} Teaches pick pocket skill to non-lawfuls, and
teaches several other skills to members of the thieves' guild (climbing,
stealth, pick pockets, open locks, detect traps, disarm traps).

@{b}Hotzenplotz the crime lord.@{ub} Quest to kill the Sheriff yields an amulet of
chaos. If you've not taken the Druid's quest, he'll ask you to kill the
healer, giving you the elder's quest to rescue the carpenter. If you
complete this quest, he'll make an appointment for you with the mad doctor.
He is the object of a Sheriff's quest.

@{b}Grunge and Munge the half-orc bouncers.@{ub} They just guard Hotzenplotz, and are
amazing conversationalists.

@{b}Shriek the cloaked ratling.@{ub} He'll sell you keys.

@{b}Kranf Niest the mad doctor.@{ub} If you complete Hotzenplotz's quest to kill the
healer, Kranf will teach you the healing skill (at the expense of some
Learning and Willpower, while removing any helmet you are wearing), or give
you a stethoscope if you already know healing.


@{b}in the underwater cave@{ub}

@{b}Shyssiryxius the female great water dragon.@{ub} This is Blup's Mom. Chat with
her and then return to Chat with Blup and send him on his way home and
eventually you'll get the artifact "the rune-covered trident."

@{b}in the village dungeon@{ub}

@{b}Yrrigs the Carpenter.@{ub} (as in Terinyo) He's mad at this point, so either kill
him or lead him up to the healer to be cured.

@{b}Jharod the healer.@{ub} If you are merciful and non-chaotic, he will teach you
the healing skill and give you a stethoscope. Healing injured monsters or
leading the carpenter to him to be healed count as merciful acts.


@{b}in the high mountain village@{ub}

@{b}??? the shopkeeper.@{ub} He sells and buys stuff.

@{b}??? the Ogre guard.@{ub} He guards the gaol; not its contents, just the building.

@{b}Hawkslayer.@{ub} He's a companion for non-chaotics who reach a certain level and
can give him the password (iceberg).

@{b}Baay'Gaab the old crone.@{ub} She's useless for non-chaotics. She assigns various
quests for others, starting with the satisfaction of the demented ratling.
Then a giant boar skull, a potion of cure corruption, a farmer corpse, a
scroll of danger... She'll eventually give you the Medal of Chaos, part of
the trinity for becoming a Chaos God.

@{b}the nefarious doctor.@{ub} He has a pricey flesh golem for sale.

@{b}the oracle.@{ub} She'll only talk to one who is ready to become a chaos god (have
all three artifacts of chaos--the sceptre, the medal, and the crown) and is
ready to dive.

@{b}in the Pyramid@{b}

@{b}Rehetep the mummy lord.@{ub} He grants a challenge when the charater reaches
level 13; the offer is closed at level 17. He wears two artifacts, the
ancient mummy wrapping and the ankh. Vulnerable to flames.

@{b}in Dark Forge@{ub}

@{b}Kherab the dwarven artificer.@{ub} He offers highly chaotic quests with artifact
rewards that corrupt the user. Kill the village Druid for the shield of raw
steel, the dwarven elder for the amulet of raw steel. There's a spear of
raw steel, too, but I've never gotten it (not sure it's coded in as
attainable). He holds an anvil, a great hammer, and a decent heavy
crossbow.

@{b}in the Tower of Fire@{ub}

@{b}the Ancient Chaos Wyrm.@{ub} Holds the Orb of Elemental Fire

@{b}at the Minstrel's hut@{ub}

@{b}the Mad Minstrel.@{ub} Will sing to you lots of hints that are really helpful
unless you've already learned about them through some silly spoilers files.

@{b}in the Great Library@{ub}

@{b}the librarian.@{ub} Well, he doesn't say much.

@{b}in the peaceful glade@{ub}

@{b}the old Barbarian.@{ub} After achieving level 13, he'l assign non-chaotics a
quest to kill 20 of the first monster you killed. When you do it, he
teaches you the Courage skill.

@{b}in the green glade@{ub}

@{b}Riurri the Greater White Unicorn.@{ub} He appears after talking to the village
Druid after level 30. He'll ask you to kill the Greater Black Unicorn; if
you do, he'll cleanse you of all corruptions, but only once.


@{b}in the corrupt glade@{ub}

@{b}???? the Greater Black Unicorn.@{ub} He'll ask you to kill the Greater White
Unicorn; if you do, he'll corrupt you and give you 7 potions of gain
attribute.

@{b}in the Dwarven graveyard@{ub}

@{b}(the undead dwarven chaos berserker) Griff Bloodaxe.@{ub} Put him out of his
misery either by killing him, or 'U'sing a potion of holy water on his
grave.

@{b}Nonnak the Necromancer.@{ub} He raised Griff and all the others in the area. He
keeps his artifact sword in Griff's grave and the artifact the elemental
gauntlets in a hidden nook on the east side of the room.

@{b}in the Caverns of Chaos@{ub}

@{b}in the Arena{ub}

@{b}the arena master.@{ub} He grants you access to the arena and upon your 20th win
gives you the artifact the Golden Gladius.
the possible Champions to face: @{b}Bonk the Hill Giant, Li-Hon-Kay the Ogre
Magus, Ripclaw the Troll berserker, Spardakius the Minotaur.@{ub}

@{b}in Dwarftown@{ub}

@{b}Thrundarr the Dwarven elder.@{ub} He assigns several quests, each with their own
rewards. If you complete a quest before he assigns it, he'll just give you
another random monster quest instead. His first is to kill a random
monster, but the reward is the potion of literacy for non-literate
characters, or identifying your entire inventory for others. Next is the
quest to find the other side of the animated forest, which yields a wand of
fireball. Then vanquishing the neighboring Ogre tribe for 5000 gold. Then
becoming Champion of the Arena (or another random monster quest if you're
already champion) which grants you the artifact shield Rolf's Savior.
Finally killing a daemon attacking the village to get the artifact Big
Punch. You should also ask about the "portal", which will give the separate
quest to free the soul of Griff Bloodaxe. He can answer questions about all
of the following: shop, waldenbrook, traits, gart, innkeeper, torgall,
gladiator, grizzelled, smith, glod, mace, hammer, axe, ogre, orc, gold,
khelevaster, sage, corruption, chaos, caladriel, phial, king, high,
ancient, bloodaxe, griff, portal, gate, banshee, greet, hello, groro,
gorko, sis, si, rolf, dwarven, dwarf, city, guest.

@{b}Waldenbrook the shopkeeper.@{ub} Again, he sells and buys stuff. He occassionally
manages to stock an artifact or other really great item.

@{b}the priest.@{ub} He's of your race and can be chatted for information if your
alignment matches his. The town is quite loyal to him, as is his god, so
treat with caution or his ghost just might haunt you.

@{b}Garth, the dwarven weapon master.@{ub} Chat with him to buy training from him. I
pay him between 90 and 200 times the current skill I'm trying to improve,
which seems to work up to 18 or 19, and then just gets annoying (but I
over-tip at restaurants, too).

@{b}Glod, the dwarven smith.@{ub} He can teach you smithing, but the price depends on
your appearance. He can also fix broken items and remove the rust from
anything you're not wearing (for a price).

@{b}Bart, the grizzled gladiator.@{ub} He has a few tales about his days, but is most
useful if you give him the Golden Gladius. He'll increase your weapon
knowledge and teach you any fighting skills you are lacking
({(Learning)d10} skill points in all melee weapons, backstabbing, find
weakness?, tactics, two-weapon combat).

@{b}Torgall, the barkeeper.@{ub} He has heard all kinds of rumors.

@{b}the dwarven mystic.@{ub} If you aren't chaotic or doomed, he'll give you the
artifact Rolf's Companion. You have to teleport into his room, though, and
out again.

@{b}the demented ratling.@{ub} He will give chaotics a quest for 6 artifacts. If
completed, he'll reveal the method for getting one part of the trinity for
becoming a Chaos God. ("Listen, blob. Visit da ancient stone circle in da
middle of da darkest night. Den ya'll find ze entrance to a part of dat
trinity. Originally it wuz built for all da alignments... ...and it
prubably haz zume other special effex. But we are gonna uze it for us
means, aye?" The demented ratling winks at you. "Get da part of ze trinity
and try to win ze price.")

@{b}Khelavaster, the dying scholar.@{ub} He's the one who inspired you to start this
journey. Kill him or talk to him. He has a few things to say about how to
close the Chaos Gate. His equipment is fairly consistant (boots of dex,
amulet of defense/protection).

@{b}the Eternal Guardian.@{ub} You must have the Ring of the High Kings to pass him
peacefully. You can try to kill him, but be prepared to do it again.

@{b}in the Casino@{ub}

@{b}???? the shopkeeper.@{ub} He sells, but does not buy. There is usually at least
one artifact in the shop, and several other goodies. Try picking up
everything interesting, expensive, or unidentified and reading a blessed
scroll of identify. Or you could win enough in the casino to buy what you
want.

@{b}the big casino guard.@{ub} The big guard is substantially tougher than the
others.

@{b}the Snake from Beyond.@{ub} Holds the Orb of Elemental Water.

@{b}Bugs the Bunny Master.@{ub} Leader of the bunny level.

@{b}the Cat Lord.@{ub} If you've never killed a cat, chat with him to get your
reward, the artifact the ring of the Master Cat; otherwise prepare to be
attacked.

@{b}Yuglash, the Master Summoner.@{ub} Holds the Orb of Elemental Air.

@{b}the Ancient Stone Beast.@{ub} Holds the Orb of Elemental Earth.

@node "Objects" "The List Of Everything You Can Carry"

For all non-artifacts, the values given are as close to the base values as
can be guessed (or, in some cases, confirmed by Thomas). These values may
be affected by how out of depth the item is when generated (a rare item
found on level one will not have stats as good as these, but a mithril
dagger found on level 50 will probably be significantly better). Items made
of the higher metals (mithril, adamantium, eternium) tend to be lighter and
stronger than those made of iron. Prior to 0.9.9 all metals and even
crystal could "rust" when in contact with water; in 0.9.9+, only iron is
subject to rust damage from water. Note that rusting reduces a weapon's
damage by half, as does breaking (cumulative), but that a rusted weapon has
a chance of causing blood poisoning in a stricken opponent. Artifacts
cannot be damaged by any means.
