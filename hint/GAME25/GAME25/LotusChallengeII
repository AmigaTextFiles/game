STAGES AND CHECKPOINTS;

THE GAME IS PLAYED OVER A NUMBER OF STAGES, 8 IN TOTAL, EACH ONE IS MADE UP OF
A NUMBER OF CHECKPOINTS, WHICH WILL VARY BETWEEN 6 AND 10, DEPENDING UPON THE
STAGE. THE PLAYER MUST REACH THE NEXT DESIGNATED CHECKPOINT WITHIN THE ALLOTTED
TIME IN ORDER TO CONTINUE RACING. THE OBJECTIVE,OBVIOUSLY, IS TO REACH THE
FINAL CHECKPOINT ON ANY STAGE AHEAD OF YOUR OPPONENTS,AND WITHIN THE GIVEN
TIME.

EACH STAGE TAKES PLACE IN A DIFFERENT PART OF AMERICA, AND EACH HAS A PASSWORD
WHICH ALLOWS YOU TO START ON THAT STAGE IN FUTURE RACES. EACH HAS ITS OWN
HAZARDS AND DANGERS, FROM ICE TO GIANT BOUL. THE STAGES WHICH WILL ALSO
DETERMINE WETHER YOU DRIVE A LOTUS ESPRIT OR A LOTUS ELAN, ARE IN THE FOLLOWING
ORDER.

THE STAGES;

FOREST;5 checkpoints.
dense trees line this stage, and you will find water,trees and logs strewn
across the track. hitting a log,however,will cause the car to do a spectacular
jump,which can be used for overtaking or jumping over other hazards.

NIGHT; 7 checkpoints.
the darkness will be your biggest enemy, as it will ake the track beyons a
certain distance obscure to you. this stage also contains some long tunnels,but
it is a relatively fast section of the race.

FOG; 8 checkpoints.
unlike this one, this is one of the more difficult stages,with fog serving to
obscure your vision to a very high degree.low visibilty and twisting roads will
make this section very difficult.

SNOW; 6 checkpoints.
trees and bushes could again prove to make the going difficult on this
section.add to this the driving snow, ice patches and lighter than light
steering, and you`ll know you have a challenge on your hands.

DESERT; 10 checkpoints.
not the easiest surface to race on,try to stick to the centre of the road,
where there is less sand to clog up your car,towards nthe edge there will be
more sand,and in some places small snadrifts will prove hazardous.

CITY; 8 checkpoints
there are 2 lanes in this stage,and its up to you wether you want to take the
chances-if you cross over into the right hand lane,there will be less traffic
going in your direction,but a lot more coming coming towards you. this is very
difficult,in addition,there are also lorries crossing your path at the
intersections. you couls avoid them,but managing to drive underneath them will
earn you extra points.

MARSH; 10 checkpoints.
oil and water make the gong tough,but on this stage, you`ll be given some help
in the shape of green time bonuses to be found on the road.

STORM; 6 checkpoints.
wild rain,thunder and kightning serve to slow you down, but again theres extra
help on hand for the final stage of the race.red turbos, which are activated as
soon as you pick them up, will give you an extra burst of speed.

RACING;
if you choose 1 player, then you will be presented with a full screen view of
the 1st section once it has loaded. the screen layoutis as follows;

YOUR SPEED IS INDICATED IN THE TOP LEFT CORNER OF THE PLAYING SCREEN, WITH YOUR
REVS DIRECTLY UNDERNEATH, AND YOUR GEAR UNDERNEATH THIS. IN THE TOP RIGHT HAND
CORNER IS YOUR SCORE. WITH THE RELATIVE POSITION INDICATOR IF YOU ARE IN
MULTI-PLAYER MODE BELOW THIS.AND YOUR TIME REMAINING BENEATH THIS.

2/3/4/ PLAYER OPTIONS;
if you choose a multi player option,another icon will appear on the screen
underneath your score. this indicates the positions of the other players
relative to you. 

LINKING 2 COMPUTERS;
linking 2 computers is possible with lotus II. 2 amigas or 2 atari st`s can be
linked,offering a number of opportunities,obviously each machine will need a
copy of lotus II, 2 players can now race. each with a full screen
view,alternatively, 3 or 4 players can race simu;taneously with a split screen
view.
to do this you will need to obtain a null kodem lead to link the serial ports
of the 2 computers.(these can be purchased from gremlin for just 9.99 each)
once the 2 computers are connected to each other,you need do no more,except
select the 2 computer link up option indicated on the main menu...

and thats yer lot...signed scooter...30/10/91
