                   SORCEROR (aka Enchanter II) from Infocom


IMPORTANT -- YOU CANNOT WIN (OR EVEN GET VERY FAR) UNLESS YOU HAVE THE 
INFOTATTOR THAT COMES WITH THE GAME.  IF YOU DONT HAVE IT, SEE BELOW.

    Enchantor II/Sorcerer takes up where Enchantor I left off.  After the 
defeat of Krill you have earned a seat on the Circle of Enchantors.  But 
lately, Belboz has seemed troubled, pre-occupied, withdrawn.  You have heard
frightening noises coming from his chamber and voices when Belboz was 
supposedly alone. Is some evil spirit at work?  Belboz is possibly the most 
powerful Enchanter in the kingdom.  What would happen if his powers were 
somehow used by the forces of darkness?

    To cast spells, for example, the Bozbar spell.  First LEARN BOZBAR
then CAST BOZBAR AT HORSE.  A SPELL MUST BE WRITTEN INTO YOUR SPELL BOOK
TO BE USED. To do this, GNUSTO BOZBAR.

So first you must
  GNUSTO spell
then
  LEARN spell
then
  CAST spell
(which will make you forget it).  

However you can learn the spell several time s (I don't believe this will 
work in Enchantor I though).
-----------------------------

    When you purchase Enchantor II you will also get an "infotater" a 
rotating data wheel which is also mentioned as an object in the game.  
You will need this wheel during the game.
   A brief summary of the wheel is as follows:

    BLOODWORMs are white and gray and black and red and gray.
    BROGMOIDs are red and purple and red and black and purple
    DORNS are gray and purple and black and gray and white
    DRYADS are black and gray and white and red and red.
    GRUES are black and black jand red and black and purple
    HELLHOUNDs are purple and white abnd gray and red and gray.
    KOBOLDs are red and purple and black and purple and red.
    NABIZs are purple and black and black and black and red. 
    ORCs are red and gray and purple and gray and red.
    ROTGRUBs are gray and red and gray and purple and red.
    SURMINs are black and black and purple and red and purple.
    YIPPLEs are gray and purple and white and purple and black.

    This brief description may be easier to use than reading the infotator 
pro vided.

IMPORTANT -- THE ABOVE WILL WORK WITH THE COPIES CRACKED BY FINEOUS FINGERS.
THIS IS A BETA TEST VERSION WITH SOME BUGS (SUCH AS -- YOU CANT SAY "CAST
BOZBAR SPELL AT ELEPHANT" YOU HAVE TO SAY "CAST BOZBAR AT ELEPHANT".
IF YOU HAVE A LATER VERSION THERE MAY BE SOME DIFFERENCES.  THE COPY I 
BOUGHT HAS THESE DIFFERENCES --
  
Bloodworm -- white and gray and black and red and black
Surmin -- black and black and purple and red and black
(the rest were the same)
This will teach you to buy a copy!

ONE HINT - you will have to die to win the game, so save, save, save.  You'll 
probably die several times trying to get through the coal mine since there is
only one specific set of moves that will get you through. At last you'll find
a use for that darn timber!  Have fun!

SO CONSERVE THE NUMBER OF MOVES YOU HAVE
   -- GOOD LUCK --
