ARCADE SECTION 1 : DRIVING
--------------------------
THE POLICE FORCE IS ON STRIKE AS DETROIT BECOMES A NO-GO ZONE. ON THE HIGHWAYS
ROBOCOP IS ATTEMPTING TO APPRHEND RUNAWAY DRIVERS AND STOLEN VEHICLES.

ARCADE SECTION 2 : STREET FIGHT
-------------------------------
THE BACK STREETS OF THE CITY ARE PLAGUED BY PUNKS WHO BRING TERROR TO THE
NEIGHBOURHOOD. ROBOCOP IS ABOUT TO CLEAN UP!

ARCADE SECTION 3 : HOSTAGE SITUATION
------------------------------------
OCP TOWER IS IN THE HANDS OF A TERRORIST FACTION WHO ARE HOLDING EXECUTIVES
HOSTAGE FOR A BILLION DOLLARS RANSOM...
NOBODY PLANS ON IT. ROBOCOP MUST PENETRATE THE TOWER AND DESTROY ALL THE
TERROROSTS.

ARCADE SECTION 4 : FLYING
-------------------------
SECURITY GUARDS ARE PROUD TO PRESENT THE LATEST ADDITION TO THE ROBOCOP
INVENTORY. A GYROPACK!. A TRIAL COMBAT SITUATION HAS BEEN ARRANGED AGAINST THE
MILITARY OVER THE SKIES OF DETROIT.

ARCADE SECTION 5 : HAND TO HAND COMBAT
--------------------------------------
A NEW ROBOTIC NINJA HAS BEEN CREATED BY HANEMETSU INDUSTRIES WHO ARE KEEN TO
IMPRESS THE WORLD OF ITS SUPERIOR COMBAT FACILITIES. ONLY ONE ADVERSARY IS UP
TO THE JOB...ROBOCOP!

AFTER THE SECTION HAS BEEN COMPLETED YOU THEN RETURN TO THE MAIN ARCADE
SELECTION MENU. IF YOU ARE ELIMINATED OR FAIL TO COMPLETE YOUR MISSIPON, YOU
RETURN TO `MEDIA BREAK`, THEN A HIGH SCORE TABLE.

THE STORY SO FAR
----------------
IT HAS BEEN 6 MONTHS SINCE THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE DELTA CITY PROJECT. OCP ARE
NOW IN A DESPERATE SITUATION AS THEY STAND TO LOOSE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IF WORK
DOES NOT COMMENCE WITHIN THE WEEK. THE CITIZENS OF DETROIT HAVE BEEN RELUCTANT
TO MOVE FROM THEIR HOMES SO OCP HAS HIRED A SPECIAL ARMY GROUP CALLED THE
`REHABS`, THEY ARE URBAN REHABILITATION OFFICERS WHO ARE ROOTING PEOPLE FROM
THEIR HOMES.

DELTA CITY MOVES EVER CLOSER.
-----------------------------
THE MOVIE SECTION OF THE GAME RUNS LIKE AN ADVENTURE. LIKE ALL ADVENTURES IT
HAS MANY TWISTS AND TURNS, SIO IT IS DIFFICULT TO GIVE AN ACCURATE FLOW OF HOW
THE GAME WILL RUN.
SO WE ARE NOT ATTEMTING TO DO SO!
MEDIA BREAK IS USED TO PROVIDE AN UPDATE OF THE EVENTS SO FAR AND CREATES THE
BACKDROP TO THE GAME.

MEDIABREAK KEYS: SPACE BAR - SKIP TO NEXT LINE OF TEXT
                 ESCAPE    - SKIP REST OF MEDIA BREAK

DIRECTIVES: 1) PROTECT THE INNOCENT
            2) UPHOLD THE LAW
            3) SERVE THE PUBLIC TRUST

ROBOCOP CANNOT VIOLATE THESE PRIME OBJECTIVES - ANY VIOLATIONS WILL RESULT IN
SHUTDOWN.

IN THE GAME ROBOCOP IS ABLE TO FUNCTION IN ALL ENVIROMENTS. HE IS CAPABLE OF
WALKING,FLYING,DRIVING AND ALL FORMS OF COMBAT.

AS A MEMBER OF THE METROPOLITAN POLICE FORCE OF DETROIT. THE SECURITY CONCEPTS
-ROBOCOP- WILL BE PROVIDED WITH A POLICE TURBO CRUISER FOR ACTIVE PATROL DUTY.

DESCRIPTION OF THE WORLD.
-------------------------
1) ACTIVE PATROL DUTY, ALL OF DETROITS PRECINCTS ARE WITHIN THE JURISDICTION OF
ROBOCOP FROM UP NORTH AND WEST TO THE INTERSTATE AND SOUTH AND EAST TO THE
SEAWAY AND CANADA. A RESTRAINING DEVICE HAS BEEN FITTED TO THE VEHICLE SO THE
CITY BOUNDERIES ARE NOT VIOLATED.

ROBOCOP HAS BEEN PROVIDED WITH NFULL GEOGRAPHICAL DATA OF THE CITY,COMPLETE
WITH MAP DISPLAYS,RADARS AND LOCATION POINTERS TO AID NAVIGATION AROUND THE
CITY.

THE CITY IS SPLIT UP INTO DIFFERENT URBAN AREAS:
1) DOWNTOWN BUSINESS DISTRICT COMPLETE WITH SKYSCRAPERS AND MODERN ULTRA TECH
   SHOW CASE BUILDINGS.
2) THE SUBURBS,THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE CITY WITH NICE HOUSING,TREES AND SHOPPING
   MALLS.
3) THE DOCKS, A\ INDUSTRIAL AREA SHOWING SIGNS OF DECAY AS THE RECESSION BITES
   HARD.
4) THE INNER CITY OF OLD DETROIT,THE RUN DOWN SLUM AREA OF DETROIT WHERE THE
   SITE OF DELTA CITY IS TO BE LAID.(THIS AREA IS NOW SEALED OFF WITH AN
   ELECTRIFIED PERIMETER FENCE)

ON THE MAP PARTICULAR ATTENTION HAS BEEN PUT TO THE MAIN AREAS INVOLVED IN THE
GAME,AT VARIOUS TIMES DURING THE GAME, YOU MAY NEED TO VISIT SOME OF THE
LOCATIONS.

1) ROCKET MOTORS - ABANDONED DISUSED CAR FACTORY.
2) OCP TOWER     - THE HQ OF O.C.P
3) METRO SOUTH POLICE HQ
4) TWENTY FOUR HOTEL
5) CHURCH

IN SOME DRIVING SECTIONS, WHEN YOU ARRIVE AT ANY OF THESE LOCATIONS THE
COMPUTER AUTOMATICALLY TAKES OVER THE GAME AS THE PLAYER SEES A GRAPHIC
BACKDROP WITH THE 3D SUPER IMPOSED OVER IT. FROM THIS POINT ROBOCOP WILL FOOT
IT.
WHILST ON PATROL ROBOCOP WILL RECEIVE MISSION ORDERS,REPORTS AND UPDATES FROM
POLICE HQ, THIS DATA WILL BE PRINTED ACROSS ROBOCOPS VISOR. IT IS THROUGH THIS
SYSTEM THAT MISSION ORDERS WILL BE CONVEYED TO ROBOCOP. MISSIONS WILL INCLUDE
APPREHENDING `411` VEHICLES AND THE CAPTURE OR DESTRUCTION OF CRIMINALS.

IT IS LIKELY,DURING PATROL,THAT GUNFIRE WILL BE AIMED FOM THESE VEHICLES,GREAT
CARE SHOULD BE TAKEN TO AVOID UNNECESSARY GUN-FIRE.

DRIVING PARAMETERS.
-------------------
THE TURBO CRUISER IS A FAST EFFICENT POLICE CAR..IT IS ABLE TO ACCELERATE TO
60MPH IN 8 SECONDS WITH A TOP SPEED OF 140 MPH. IT IS ABLE TO PULL HARD AT FAST
SPEEDS AND DECELERATES RAPIDLY FOR TURNING CORNERS. MAKING IT LESS HAZARDOUS.

THE VEHICLES TURBO BOOST CUTS IN AT 30 MPH UP TO 80MPH WHICH IS VERY USEFUL FOR
OVERTAKING AND FOR ACCELERATING OUT OF TIGHT CORNERS.

DISPLAYS.
---------
THE CAR DASHBOARD HAS A SPEEDOMETER MOUNTED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CONSOLE AND A
MAP ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE. ON THE STEERING WHEEL A SMALL WHITE DISPLAY DOT
SHOWS HOW FAR THE STEERING WHEEL IS TURNED AND IN WHAT DIRECTION IT IS
POINTING. THE CAR IS ALSO FITTED WITH FLASHING POLICE LIGHTS: THESE LIGHTS ARE
AUTOMATED AND WILL FLASH AUTOMATICALLY DURING ARREST MODE.

THE CAR HAS AN ACTIVE MOVING MAP DISPLAY TO SHOW THE PLAYER THE LOCATION OF ANY
ADVERSARIES AND HIMSELF IN RELATION TO THE WORLD.
THIS IS ESSENTIAL DURING HIGH SPEED CHASES. DUE TO THE MAP RESOLUTION IT IS
SPLIT INTO 4 SECTIONS FOR THE -NORTH EAST - SOUTH EAST - SOUTH WEST - NORTH
WEST AREAS OF THE CITY.
YOUR VEHICLE IS INDICATED BY A GREEN SQUARE, THE SUSPECT VEHICLE BY A RED
SQUARE.

DAMAGE AND EFFICIENCY.
----------------------
THE CAR IS ABLE TO WITHSTAND A GREAT DEAL OF DAMAGE,AKTHOUGH THE MORE DAMAGE
THE CAR RECIEVES THE LESS RESPONSIVE AND MORE DIFFICULT IT MAY COME TO CONTROL.
DURING THE DRIVING SECTION,ROBOCOPS EFFECIENCY READING IS DEDICATED TO THE CAR
AND NOT ROBOCOP.

THE EFFECICIENCY READING SHOWS THE OVERALL TURBO CRUISER EFFECIENCY. WHEN
ROBOCOP IS IN ACTION THIS READING WILL DIMINISH DUE TO THE EFFECT TO WEAPONS
WHICH CAN DAMAGE ROBOCOP. ie HEAD ON COLLISIONS WITH BUILDINGS AND OTHER
VEHICLES OR HEAVY GUNFIRE CAN DESTROY THE TURBO CRUISER AND LIGHT GUNFIRE CAN
SLOWLY WEAR DOWN THE EFFECIENCY READING.

ANY READING BELOW 30% WILL SHOW A WARNING AS THE VEHICLE WILL HAVE SUSTAINED A
LARGE AMOUNT OF DAMAGE. IT ALSO MAY PROVE MORE DIFFICULT TO DRIVE AND MAY INCUR
LOSE TO POWER AND REACTION DUE TO DAMAGE. THE TURBO CRUISER WILL BE DESTROYED
WHEN EFFECIENCY IS REDUCED TO ZERO.

THE PLAYERS SCORE IS CALCULATED ON THE FOLLOWING;
HOW QUICK THE MISSION IS ACHIEVED.
HOW MUCH EFFECIENCY ROBOCOP HAS REMAINING
AN OVERALL MISSION SCORE
SCORE FOR INDIVIDUAL NUMBER OF THOSE ELIMINATED

NOTE: IT IS POSSIBLE TO GET A NEGATIVE SCORE SCORE IF ROBOCOP SHOOT ANY
INNOCENT PEOPLE WHILST ON DUTY. ie WOMEN AND CHILDREN. IF A NEGATIVE SCORE IS
ACHIEVED AT THE END OF THE MISSION IT IS LIKELY THAT THE PLAYER WILL BE
DECOMMISIONED FROM THE FORCE AND DEACTIVATED.

F7 - EXTERNAL REAR TRTACKING OF TURBO CRUISER
F8 - VIEW OF SUSPECT VEHICLE
F9 - INTELLIGENT CAMERA VIEW SETS UP ANGLES TO VIEW TURBO CRUISER AND SUSPECT
     VEHICLE.

YOUR ADVERSARY IS INTELLIGENT SO TREAT HIM WITH RESPECT, KEEP ON THE
ROAD...ALTHOUGH YOU CAN DRIVE ON THE SIDEWALKS AND OPEN AREAS IT WILL DAMAGE
YOUR VEHICLE AND WEAR DOWN EFFECIENCY.
KEEP AN EYE ON THE BRAKE LIGHTS AS YOU WILL KNOW THEN IF YOUR CHASE VEHICLE IS
ABOUT TO SLAM ON THE BRAKES OR TURN RAPIDLY.
WHEN IN PURSUIT OF A VEHICLE,DONT GET TO CLOSE AS IT IS LIKELY THAT ITS DOORS
WILL SWING OPEN WITH MACHINE GUNS FIRING AT YOU. ALSO LOOK OUT FOR PEOPLE
SHOOTING AT YOU FROM THE ROADSIDE OR OTHER VEHICLES.
TO APPRHEND A VEHICLE IT IS BEST TO CHOOSE YOUR MOMENT.ie WHEN ON A STRAIGHT
SECTION OF ROAD USE YOUR TURBO ACCELERATION TO MOVE UP ALONG SIDE HIM AND RUN
INTO HIM.
IT COULD TAKE SEVERAL COLLISIONS TO FORCE THE VEHICLE OFF THE ROAD,DURING THIS
YOU MAY ALSO BE UNDER FIRE. WATCH OUT FOR OBSTACOLES IN THE ROAD SUCH AS OIL
SPILLS,DESTROYED VEHICLES AND DEBRIS. ON TURNING USE THE WIDTH OF THE ROAD,BUT
DONT IVERSTEER. SQUEELING TYRES WILL LET YOU KNOW IF YOUR CUTTING IT TOO FINE.
WHEN IN PURSUIT OF FASTER VEHICLES YOU WILL STRUGGLE TO KEEP UP..REMEMBER USE
YOUR TURBO ACCELERATION AT THE RIGHT TIME.

FLYING SECTION.
---------------
THE LATEST ADDITION TO ROBOCOP ARMOURY IS `GYROCYCLE`. THIS IS A SPECIALLY
ADAPTED JETPACK WHICH ALLOWS ROBOCOP TO ACHIEVE FULL FLIGHT.
THE GYROCYCLE IS INTERFACED TO USE THE ROBOCOP SOFTWARE AS A NEW HELMET DISPLAY
CALLED `H.U.D`. ON THE HELMET MOUNTED DISPLAY MISSION DIRECTIVES ARE PRINTED
AND ALSO ANY DATA WHICH MAY BE RELEVANT,BELOW THIS IS THE EFFECIENCY READING IS
PRINTED PERMANTLY.

EFFECIENCY.
-----------
THE EFFECIENCY READING SHOWS THE OVERALL ROBOCOP EFFECIENCY. WHEN ROBOCOP IS IN
COMBAT THIS READING WILL DIMINISH DUE TO THE EFFECT OF WEAPONS WHICH CAN
DAMAGE ROBOCOP. ie HELICOPTER GUNFIRE CAN BLOW ROBOCOP OUT OF THE SKY AND
GROUND GUNFIRE CAN SLOWLY WEAR DOWN THE EFFECIENCY READING.

ANY READING BELOW 30% WILL SHOW A WARNING AS ROBOCOP WILL HAVE SUSTAINED A
LARGE AMOUNT OF DAMAGE. IT ALSO MAY PROVE MORE DIFFICULT TO FLY AND MAY INCUR
LOSS OF POWER AND REFLEXES DUE TO DAMAGE. ROBOCOP WILL BE DESTROYED WHEN
EFFECIENCY IS REDUCED TO ZERO.

WEAPONS.
--------
WHILST IN FLIGHT ROBOCOP HAS A MULTI WEAPON WHICH IS CAPABLE OF FIRING CANNON
AND RAPID MACHINE GUN FIRE,THE WEAPON IS SELECTED AND THE AMOUNT OF AMMUNITION
REAMAINING IS PRINTED ON THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN.
THE CANNON IS THE MORE POWERFUL THAN THE MULTI WEAPON ARM MACHINE GUN. THE
CANNON IS ABLE TO KNOCK OUT HEAVY ARMOUR SUCH AS TANKS AND HELICOPTERS MORE
EFFECIENTLY THAN THE MACHINE GUN.

ROBOCOPS AVIONIC SOFTWARE HAS A NEW TARGET SYSTEM SIMILAR TO A FIGHTER AIRCRAFT
WHERE A LOCK CAN BE ACHIEVED WHICH WILL ALLOW THE WEAPONS TO BEAR. IT IS UP TO
THE PLAYER TO THEN FIRE WHEN READY.

COUNTER MEASURES.
-----------------
H.U.D THIS DISPLAY IS DESIGNED TO SHOW THE PLAYER ALL RELEVANT FLIGHT
INFORMATION..ie, POWER,RADAR AND OTHER VARIOUS READINGS.

1) ALTITUDE BAR - THIS IS THE LEFT HAND INDICATOR BAR, A WARNING WILL APPEAR IF
   THE ALTITUDE LEVEL IS TO LOW.
2) THRUST BAR - THIS IS THE RIGHT HAND INDICATOR BAR SHOWING THE THRUST OF THE
   JET PACK. THE GREATER THE THRUST THE GRATER THE VELOCITY OBTAINED.

3) RADAR - THE CENTRAL AREA OF THE DISPLAY SHOWS A RADAR DISPLAY OF VARIOUS
   THREATS RELEVANT TO YOUR POSITION OBJECTS ARE SPLIT INTO THREE COLOUR CODES.
   RED   - IS AN AERIAL THREAT. ie HELICOPTERS
   GREEN - IS FOR FRIENDLY .ie POLICE CARS
   BLACK - SHOWS THE LOCATION OF IMPORTANT OR RELEVANT BUILDINGS ie OCP TOWER
   YELLOW- INDICATES A GROUND BASED THREAT ie, ED209,TANKS ect
   
HORIZON BAR INDICATOR[USED WITH CANNON] WHEN A VALID TARGET IS WITHIN H.U.D, A
GREEN TARGET `LOCK` APPEARS WHEN WITHIN RANGE TO FIRE. A RED TARGET CIRCLE WILL
OVERLAP,WHEN THEY MEET YOU CAN FIRE.

THE PLAYERS SCORE IS CALCULATED ON THE FOLLOWING;
HOW QUICK THE MISSION IS ACHIEVED.
HOW MUCH EFFECIENCY ROBOCOP HAS REMAINING
AN OVERALL MISSION SCORE
SCORE FOR INDIVIDUAL NUMBER OF THOSE ELIMINATED

NOTE: IT IS POSSIBLE TO GET A NEGATIVE SCORE SCORE IF ROBOCOP SHOOT ANY
INNOCENT PEOPLE WHILST ON DUTY. ie WOMEN AND CHILDREN. IF A NEGATIVE SCORE IS
ACHIEVED AT THE END OF THE MISSION IT IS LIKELY THAT THE PLAYER WILL BE
DECOMMISIONED FROM THE FORCE AND DEACTIVATED

KEEP LOW ALTHOUGH SUSCEPTIBLE AT THIS ALTITUDE TO SMALL ARMS FIRE WHICH WILL
SLOWLY LOWER YOUR EFFECIENCY IT IS FAR LESS DANGEROUS THAN A LARGE AAA AND
HELICOPTER GUNFIRE.ALSO AT HIGH ALTITUDE THE MISSILES PROVE EFFECTIVE.

THE HELICOPTERS ARE PERHAPS THE MOST DANGEROUS SO SHOULD BE AVOIDED. TAKE
SUGGEST THAT ALL AERIAL THREATS SHOULD BE ERADICATED BEFORE GROUND ENGAGEMENTS
IT IS THEREFORE FEASIBLE TO DEAL WITH THE HELICOPTERS IMMEDIATELY.
TRY TO CONSERVE FUEL.

ROBOCOP WAS PRIMARILY DESIGNED AROUND THE USE OF URBAN PACIFICATION WHICH
INCLUDES HEAVILY BUILT AREAS SUSCH AS ALLEYWAYS,LARGE BUILDINGS AND GENERAL
PEDESTRIAN AREAS. ROBOCOP HAS FULLY FUNCTIONS AROUND ALL ENVIROMENTS AND CAN
PENETRATE ALMOST ANY BUILDING.
ROBOCOP IS ABLE TO MAP A ZONE HE ENTERS AND IS ABLE TO USE WEAPONS IN A CLOSED
ENVIROMENT AGAINST ANYTHIN HOSTILE.
HE IS ABLE TO WALK THROUGH DOORS,OR PUNCH DOWN CLOSED DOORS, AND WITH THE USE
OF HIS TARGETING SYSTEM IS ABLE TO OPERATE ELEVATORS BY USING THE UP OR DOWN
CURSOR ON THE KEYBOARD.

WEAPONS AND TARGET ACQUIISITION.
--------------------------------
ROBOCOP HAS AN ADVANCED TARGET ACQUISITION SYSTEM WHICH IS ABLE TO DETECT
ANYTHING HOSTILE.

THE PLAYER MUST POSITION THE CROSS HAIRS OVER A VALID TARGET. ROBOCOPS SOFTWARE
WILL AUTOMATICALLY DESIGNATE AND LOCK ONTO THE TARGET, AND THE PLAYER IS THEN
ABLE TO FIRE WEAPONS.

THE TARGET WILL FLASH GREEN FOR AN INSTANT FOR CONFIRMATION.

ROBOCOP IS NOW FITTED WITH A DETACHABLE MULTI WEAPON ARM. THE ARM HAS A MULTI
HEAVY CALIBRE MACHINE GUN.

EFFECIENCY
----------
THE EFFECIENCY SHOWS THE OVERALL EFFECIECY OF ROBOCOP IS IN ACTION THIS READING
WILL DIMINISH DUE TO EFFECT OF WEAPONS WHICH CAN DAMAGE ROBOCOP.ie BOMBS OR
HEAVY GUNFIRE WHICH CAN CAUSE SEVERE DAMAGE AND LIGHT GUNFIRE WHICH CAN SLOWLY
WEAR DOWN THE EFFECIENCY READING.

ANY READING BELOW 30% WILL SHOW A WARNING AS ROBOCOP WILL HAVE SUSTAINED A
LARGE AMOUNT OF DAMAGE. IT ALSO MAY PROVE MORE DIFFICULT TO MOVE AND MAY INCUR
LOSS OF POWER AND REACTION DUE TO THE DAMAGE. ROBOCOP WILL BE DESTROYED WHEN
WHEN THE EFFECIENCY IS REDUCED TO ZERO.

THE CROSS HAIRS ARE ALSO USED TO DIRECT THE MOTION OF ROBOCOP. WHEN USING A
MOUSE IF THE CROSS HAIRS ARE PUSHED TO THE TOP OR SIDE OF THE SCREEN WILL
CHANGE DIRECTION ACCORDINGLY.

THIS WILL NOT HOWEVER INTERFERE WITH THE TARGET LOCK SYSTEM AS THE CURSOR IS
ABLE TO BE POSITIONED OVER ANY TARGET WITHIN THE SCREEN ALLOWING ROBOCOP TO BE
ACCURATELY POSITIONED FOR A SHOT.

IN SOME URBAN AREAS ROBOCOP CAN USE AN ACTIVE SONIC HOMING DEVICE TO LOCATE A
PERSON. THE AUDIO BLEEP WILL ACCELERATE AS HE GETS CLOSER TO THE SOURCE. THIS
DEVICE WORKS AUTOMATICALLY.

NOTE: IT IS POSSIBLE TO GET A NEGATIVE SCORE SCORE IF ROBOCOP SHOOT ANY
INNOCENT PEOPLE WHILST ON DUTY. ie WOMEN AND CHILDREN. IF A NEGATIVE SCORE IS
ACHIEVED AT THE END OF THE MISSION IT IS LIKELY THAT THE PLAYER WILL BE
DECOMMISIONED FROM THE FORCE AND DEACTIVATED

HINTS AND TIPS
--------------
CAUTION SHOULD BE TAKEN AT ALL TIMES AS DANGER LURKS AROUND EVERY CORNER. YOU
SHOULD ALWAYS TAKE EXTREME CAUTION WHEN TURNING CORNERS AND BE PREPARED TO
FIRE. ALWAYS AIM FOR A BODY SHOT TO ACHIEVE ACCURATE TARGET LOCK.

AVOID INNOCENT CIVILIANS AT ALL COSTS
-------------------------------------
TARGETS SHOULD BE CHOSEN CAREFULLY. ie IF THERE ARE 3 BADDIES ATTACKING YOU.
FIGURE OUT WHO IS THE MOST DANGEROUS. A MAN ABOUT TO THROW A HAND GRENADE IS
FAR MORE DANGEROUS THAN A MAN WITH A HAND GUN...
IF A HAND GRENADE IS THROWN YOU STILL HAVE A CHANCE TO DESTROY IT WITH YOUR
GUN, AS THE DAMAGE SUSTAINED WILL THEN BE GREATLY REDUCED.

IT IS VERY EASY TO BECOME LOST SO PAY ATTENTION TO ANY PARTICULAR LAND MARKS OR
SIGNS. MANY ALLEYWAYS AND CORRIDORS HAVE COUNTLESS DOORS, MANY OF THEM LEAD
NOWHERE. EXPLORING EVERY DOORWAY WILL ONLY WASTE TIME, MANY OF THEM ARE BOOBY
TRAPPED, SO CARE MUST BE TAKEN.
MAKE A NOTE OF THE DIRECTION THE BADDIES ARE COMING FROM AS THEY MAY LEAD YOU
TO YOUR OVERALL MISSION DIRECTIVE.

TO OPERATE ELEVATORS, SIMPLY WALK INSIDE AND PRESS CURSOR-UP OR CURSOR-DOWN
KEY/S ON THE KEYBOARD.

CLOSE QUARTER COMBAT
--------------------
IN AN URBAN ENVIROMENT, AN ENFORCEMENT DROID IS LIKELY TO ENCOUNTER MANY
DIFFERENT MODES OF ATTACK, WEAPONS SUCH AS A MACHINE GUN ARE NOT ALWAYS
AVAILABLE,AND ONLY MINIMUM AMOUNT OF FORCE MAY BE REQUIRED TO PERFORM AN
ARREST. ROBOCOP IS ABLE TO MANIPULATE LIMBS FOR USE IN UN-ARMED COMBAT, HE IS
ABLE TO PUNCH LOW AND HIGH,BLOCK INCOMING THRUSTS,PERFORM EVASIVE MANOEUVRES
AND IS ALSO ABLE TO RECOVER HIMSELF FROM THE GROUND.

OTOMO OS A HIGHLY ADVANCED MACHINE AND IN MANY WAYS FAR SUPERIOR TO ROBOCOP AND
IS ABLE TO OUT-MANOEUVRE ROBOCOP AT ANY LEVEL OF COMBAT. SOME OF THE BASIC
RULES OF ENGAGEMENT:

DO NOT GET TRAPPED IN A CORNER AND WAIT FOR OTOMO TO MOVE ON YOU. DO NOT RUN
STRAIGHT AT HIM.

OTOMO MAY SEEM TO FAR AWAY TO STRIKE OUT BUT BE CAREFUL. HE IS ABLE TO LEAP
GREAT DISTANCES WITH FLYING KICKS.

IF OTOMO MOVES CLOSE IN AND STARTS PUNCHING DONT SLUG IT OUT IN HAND TO HAND
FIGHTING BECAUSE HE IS ABLE TO QUICKLY PULL HIS SWORD OUT AND STRIKE A DEADLY
BLOW. SO KEEP YOUR DISTANCE AND MOVE AWAY.
