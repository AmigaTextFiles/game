|      You've distinguished yourself among the young Enchanters by defeating  |
|  the evil Warlock Krill,  whose attempt to subjugate the land was thwarted  |
|  by  your  cleverness,  as  your inexperience allowed you to succeed where  |
|  others might have failed.   This earned you a place on the Circle of  En-  |
|  chanters,  second only to the great Belboz the Necromancer.   Then Belboz  |
|  himself was nearly destroyed,  and your rescue of him from the evil demon  |
|  Jeearr earned you the ultimate honor given a mage,  the leadership of the  |
|  Circle of Enchanters.                                                      |
|      Now,  a  crisis has befallen the kingdom.   Magic itself seems to  be  |
|  failing.   Spells fail to work or go strangely awry, the populace is con-  |
|  fused  and restive,  and even the Enchanters Guild is baffled.   A  great  |
|  conclave of the Guildmasters is ordained, and it is at this conclave that  |
|  the final conflict between good and evil begins to unfold.....             |
|                                                                             |

|       Again - this will respond as if you had repeated your previous sent-  |
|               ence. Abbreviation is "G".                                    |
|       Brief  - gives a full description of a location only the first  time  |
|                you  enter  it.   Subsequent visits will tell you only  the  |
|                name of the location and the objects present.  This is  the  |
|                default setting unless changed by the VERBOSE or SUPERBRIEF  |
|                commands.                                                    |

|       Oops - If you accidentally typed something wrong and it responds  "I  |
|              don't  know the word 'papwe'."  You can type "Oops paper" ra-  |
|              ther than typing in the whole sentence in again.               |

|       Restart - stops story and starts over from the beginning.             |
|       Restore - restores position made using the "Save" command.            |

|                     objects are present.  This only gives the name of  the  |

|  Remember that Infocom games can take a whole sentence as a move with pre-  |
|  positions,  etc.,  or several commands separated by a comma, period, or a  |
|  "Then".  To  move,  just enter  in the compass direction, i.e. E)ast,  NE  |
|  (northeast), or U)p or D)own. "All" or "It" can save typing time, for ex-  |
|  ample,  "take the scroll,  read it,  put it in the box", "examine all the  |
|  dusty scrolls".  "All" refers to the objects that are visible,  not  ones  |
|  that  are hidden and uncovered by you.   You can say something in quotes,  |
|  'Say "Hi!"' or talk to someone by typing their name,  then a comma,  then  |
|  whatever you want to say to them, "Turtle, Follow me".  Any further ques-  |
|  tions should be directed to me at :                                        |
