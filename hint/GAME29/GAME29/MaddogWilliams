  =======================================================================

WELCOME ADVENTURER TO THE WORLD OF MAD DOG WILLIAMS. A WORLD OF KINGS AND
CASTLES, OF GREAT DRAGONS AND LOVELY PRINCESSES. COME SIT WITH ME FOR A WHILE.
REST FROM YOUR WEARY TRAVELS AND I WILL TELL YOU A TALE. THIS IS A STORY 
FILLED WITH BOTH GOOD AND EVIL. FOR YOU SEE, MANY YEARS AGO THERE WAS
A KING...

THIS KING WHO WAS NAMED `SERAK` WAS SEDUCED BY THE POWER OF THE DARK GOD
`MALTHAZAR`. HE BECAME AN EVIL AND POWERFUL MAN. FOR MANY YEARS HE RULED WITH
BLOOD AND HORROR FROM HIS FORTRESS ATOP THE CORBBALA MOUNTAINS.

ONE DAY, A MAN NAMED SIR ROBERT THAYLOR, A COUSIN TO THE WICKED `SERAK`,
DECIDED THE TIME HAD COME TO END THE DARK KINGS RULE. HE GATHERED TOGETHER A
SECRET ARMY AND TRAINED THEM IN THE ART OF WAR. IN THE LAND WERE `WHITE
WIZARDS` WHO PRACTISED THE MAGIC OF TRUTH AND LIGHT. THAYLOR GATHERED THESE
WIZARDS TOGETHER ANDENLISTED THEM IN HIS NOBLE CAUSE. THEY PLANNED FOR MANY
MONTHS, DEVELOPING STRATEGIES AND MAKING WEAPONS. WHEN THE PREPARATIONS WERE
COMPLETE, THAYLOR TOOK HIS MEN ACROSS THE PLAINS OF GILGORATH TO THE FOOT OF
THE CORBALA MOUNTAINS.

THERE THEY ENGAGED BATTLE AGAINST THE ARMIES OF `SERAK`. THE FIGHTING WAS
FIERCE AND THE BATTLE FOR GOOD AND EVIL RAGED FOR MANY DAYS. THE POWERS OF
MALTHAZAN WERE PITTED AGAINST AGAINST THE WILL OF THE WHITE WIZARDS. MANY GOOD
MEN LOST THEIR LIVES IN THE CONFLICT, BUT THAYLORS ARMY PREVAILED AND DROVE 
THE ARMY OF `SERAK` INTO THE WILDERNESS. THEN THEY STORMED THE CATSLE AND 
CAPTURED `SERAK`.

THE WHITE WIZARDS CAST `SERAK` INTO AN ENCHANTED LAND CELL, BANISHING HIM FOR
ETERNITY. AS THE PORTAL SLOWLY CLOSED `SERAKS` VOICE ECHOED THROUGH THE CASTLE,
`BY ALL THAT IS EVIL AND IN THE NAME OF MALTHAZAR, I SHALL RETURN AND WREAK MY
VENGEANCE UPON THIS LAND!!!`. THE DARK CASTLE OF SERAK WAS LEFT IN RUIN AS A
REMINDER OF THE EVIL THAT HAD ONCE ENVELOPED THE LAND.

THE PEOPLE IN THE LAND MADE THAYLOR THEIR KING AND THE KINGDOM PROSPERED. 
AFTER SEVERAL YEARS OF PEACE AND PROSPERITY THERE WAS BORN TO KING THAYLOR AND
HIS QUEEN, A DAUGHTER WHOM THEY NAMED `LEORIA`. TIMES WERE GOOD FOR THE PEOPLE
OF DURIDIAN AND MARINOR. NO LONGER OPPRESSED, MANY MEN BEGAN TO TRAVEL TO FAR
LANDS SEEKING ADVENTURE AND FORTUNE.

ONE OF THE MOST ADVENTUROUS OF THESE WAS SIR WALTER WILLIAMS OF MARIONOR, SIR
WALTER TRAVELLED TO ALL KNOWN LANDS TO MEET WITH KINGS AND PRINCES. HE
TRAVELLED THROUGH DANGEROUS WATERS JUST TO WATCH THE SUNSET OVER THE BAY OF
BALDAGORG AND SWIM WITH THE MERMAIDS OF CARISH.

WHILE SIR WALTER ROAMED THE WORLD, HIS WIFE STAYED BEHIND AND RAIED THEM A SON
WHOM THEY CALLED MICHEAL.
MICHEAL WILLIAMS GREW UP A BRIGHT AND INVENTIVE BOY, ALWAYS TINKERING AND
INVENTING NEW THINGS. AS MICHEAL GREW INTO ADULTHOOD HE FOUND HE HAD
A PASSION FOR HISTORY AND BEGAN TO COLLECT OBJECTS FROM TIMES GONE BY.

SOME DAYS MICHEAL WOULD SIT ON THE ROCKS BY THE BEACH AND WATCH FOR HIS 
FATHERS RETURN. HE WAS ALWAYS ANXIOUS TO HEAR THE STORIES HIS FATHER WOULD 
TELL. MICHEAL WOULD LISTEN WITH INTEREST AND LONGING TO ALL HIS FATHERS 
ADVENTURES. WHEN HE WOULD ASK IF HE COULD ACCOMPANY HIS FATHER THE ANSWER WAS 
ALWAYS..`WHEN YOU ARE A MAN YOU MAY COME`.

ONE DAY WHEN HIS FATHER WAS AWAY, YOUNG MICHEAL VENTURED INTO THE LOCAL TAVERN.
PULLING UP A CHAIR. HE SAT DOWN AMONGST HIS FATHERS FRIENDS. `BEGONE YOU YOUNG
PUP, THIS IS A PLACE FOR MEN!` ONE GRIZZLED OLD SAILOR SAID. TODAY IS MY 18TH
BIRTHDAY, SO TODAY I AM A MAN!..MICHEAL SAID. `BAH` THE SAILOR SAID, YOU ARE`NT
A MAN UNTIL YOU CAN OUT DRINK ME!!!...BARKEEP BRING US 2 TANKARDS OF YOUR
FOULEST ALE.
SOON 2 FOAMING MUGS OF ALE WERE PLACED BEFORE THEM. IF YOU CAN FINISH THE ALE
BEFORE ME THEN YOU CAN CALL YOURSELF A MAN. THE OLD SAILOR GRABBED HIS MUG.
LIFTING IT TO HIS LIPS HE BEGAN TO GULP DOWN THE ALE.

MICHEAL ACCPETING THE CHALLENGE RAISED HIS MUG, THREW BACK HIS HEAD AND POURED
THE ALE DOWN HIS THROAT AS FAST AS LIGHTNING.AND SLAMMED HIS EMPTY MUG ON THE
TABLE. THE OLD SAILOR CHOKED, SPEWING ALE ALL DOWN HIS FRONT. LOOKING AT THE
ALE DRIPPING FROM MICHEALS FACE THE OLD SAILOR SAID, `WITH ALL THAT FOAM ON
YOUR FACE YOU LOOK LIKE A MAD DOG`. THE PUB ERUPTED INTO LAUGHTER. WIPING HIS
FACE, MICHEAL STOOD WITH PRIDE AND WALKED OUT OF THE PUB, THE MENSTILL LAUGHING
BEHIND HIM.

HENCEFORTH MICHEAL WILLIAMS WAS KNOWN AS `MAD DOG WILLIAMS` HE HAS BORN THE
NAME SINCE.

MAD DOGS FATHER SHOOK WITH LAUGHTERAS MAD-DOG TOLD OF HIS EXPERIENCE IN THE
PUB, SLAPPING HIS SON ON THE BACK, SIR WALTER SAID, `WHEN I LEAVE NEXT SPRING
YOU MAY ACCOMPANY ME` MADDOG FILLED WITH EXCITEMENT AND ANTICIPATION, LOOKED
FORWARD TO THE FOLLOWING SPRING.

THE FOLLOWING WEEK, MAD-DOGS FATHER TOOK HIM TO THE WEAPON SMITH IN SYDRA.
THERE SIR WALTER PURCHASED THE FINEST SWORD AND PRESENTED IT TO HIS SON, 
DURING THE FOLLOWING MONTHS, MADDOGS FATHER TAUGHT HIM THE ART OF SWORD PLAY.
MADDOG PRACTISED MANY HOURS AND BECAME A FINE SWORDSMAN.

THE WINTER THAT YEAR WAS HARSH. ONE DAY IN LATE WINTER WHILE MADDOG AND HIS
FATHER WERE CHOPPING WOOD, MARINOR WAS ATTACKED BY A GROUP OF PIRATES. THE MEN
OF THE VILLAGE CAME TO DEFEND THEIR FAMILIES AGAINST THE RAIDING PIRATES. THE
FIGHTING WAS FIERCE AND MUCH BLOOD FLOWED THAT DAY. MADDOG AND HIS FAMILY
ENTERED THE FIGHTING SIDE BY SIDE, BUT AS THE BATTLE WORE ON SIR WALTER AND
MADDOG WERE SEPERATED. WHEN THE BATTLE WAS DONE AND THE PIRATES DRIVEN FROM 
THE VILLAGE. MADDOG WENT IN SEARCH OF HIS FATHER. AS MADDOG ROUNDED ONE OF
BUILDINGS HE SAW HIS FATHER SITTING AGAINST THE WALL CLUTCHING HIS STOMACH AS
BLOOD RAN FROM THE LARGE GASH IN SIR WALTERS BELLY. SIR WALTER LOOKED UP AT
HIS SON AND SIAD `I`M NOT MUCH LONGER FOR THIS WORLD` TAKE CARE OF YOUR MOTHER
I`M PROUD OF YOU. SIR WALTER GASPED AS HIS BODY WAS WRACKED WITH PAIN.
GRASPING MADDOGS SHOULDER, SIR WALTER DIED. MADDOG WAS HEARTBROCKEN. AFTER 
THEY BURIED SIR WALTER. MADDOG SAT UPON THE ROCKS WHERE HE HAD IN TIMES PAST,
WAITED FOR HIS FATHERS RETURN AND LOOKED OUT OVER THE OCEAN. MADDOGS MIND WAS
FILLED WITH MEMORIES OF SITTING BY THE FIRE , LISTENING TO HIS FATHERS TALES.

THAT SPRING MADDOG BOARDED THE SHIP AND SET FORTH WITHOUT HIS FATHER ON HIS
FIRST ADVENTURE. MADDOG TRAVELLED TO FAR LANDS AND COLLECTED TREASURES AND
ARTIFACTS. MANY TIMES MADDOG AND HIS COMPANIONS HAD TO FIGHT OFF PIRATES AND
OUTRUN SEA-MONSTERS, THEY FOUGHT AGAINST THE `NAVARALL` ON THE ISLAND OF
`WILKARIK` AND PROCURED THE STONE OF GORACK.

AFTER SEVERAL YEARS OF TRAVELLING THE WORLD, MADDOG DECIDED IT WAS TIME TO
SETTLE DOWN, HE RETURNED TO THE VILLAGE OF MARINOR, BUILT HIMSELF A HOUSE AND
OPENED A SHOP. HE DEALT IN RARE AND PRECIOUS OBJECTS.

UNKNOWN TO MADDOG AND THE RSIDENTS OF MARINOR WAS THE EVIL BLIGHT SLOWLY
ENVELOPING THE LAND. KING THAYLOR AND HIS DAUGHTER HAD NOT BEEN SEEN FOR
WEEKS, AND RUMOURS ABOUNDED THAT THE VILE AND EVIL `SERAK` HAD ESCPAED HIS
ENCHANTED CELL. THE PEOPLE OF SYDRA WERE LIVING IN FEAR OF `SERAKS` REVENGE. 
SO IT WAS THAT ONE DAY MADDOG AWOKE AND FOUND HIMSELF THRUST INTO THE MIDST OF THE
EVIL AND TREACHERY.
