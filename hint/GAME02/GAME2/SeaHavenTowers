Thank you for purchasing SeaHaven Towers.

This disk contains two versions of SeaHaven Towers.  One is a 
full implementation, with great graphics and internal help.  This 
version is called "SeaHaven Towers" on the disk.  The other is a 
stripped version, with less appealing graphics and no help.  The 
stripped version takes only 33K, compared to close to 100K for 
the full version.  Both versions are functionally identical.  To 
learn the rules of the game, run the complete version and press 
the "Help" key.

This disk is your key disk.  You can copy the program to a hard 
drive, but have this disk ready when you run it.  You will need 
this disk each time you run the game.

SeaHaven Towers saves your current position in a file in your S: 
directory called 'SeaHaven Scores'.  If you boot off of different 
disks each time you run the program, you may find yourself 
replaying the same games.

"Cheat" in the program does a blind depth first search.  This 
means it may take several days to solve a game.  Because of this, 
it is not recommended that you have the computer try to solve a 
game from the very beginning of the game.  If you get stuck in 
the middle of a game, it may be able to help you out in a 
reasonable amount of time.

We don't think there are any bugs in the program.  However, if 
you find any bugs, please tell us.  The first person to report 
each (reproducible) bug will receive two UnSane creations free!

Speaking of other UnSane creations, you'll also find demos of 
Accordion and Calculation on this disk.  We think these games 
live up to our high standards, and we hope you enjoy them as much 
as SeaHaven Towers.
