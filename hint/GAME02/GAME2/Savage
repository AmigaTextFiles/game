Savage - A Great game from Probe!
To get to level 2 or 3 you must complete the preceding levels
however the game will let you practice level 2 or 3 without finishing the
preceding levels, but you will only have one life.
Upon completion of each level you will be given a password.
When level 2 is loaded, press S on the title screen and it will
prompt you for the password - enter SABATTA
For Unlimited lives enter BRUISER

When level 3 is loaded select the ENTER CODE FOR LEVEL 2 option on the menuy
and when prompted enter PORSCHE

This is definately one of the best games out for the Amiga so far, and there
are more to come.
Great soundtracks - from Probe.
