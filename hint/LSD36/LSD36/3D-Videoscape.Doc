                       WRITTEN BY OZZY OF 2000 A.D.



GETTING STARTED:
----------------
ONCE YOU'VE GOT THE MAIN VIDEOSCAPE 3D PROGRAM UP AND RUNNING, THE FIRST 
THING YOU'LL WANT TO DO IS LOAD IN A DEMO ANIMATION. THEESE AREN'T STORED AS
A SERIES OF GRAPHIC FRAMES; INSTEAD THERE ARE SEPERATE DIRECTORIES CONTANING
DATA FOR THE OBJECTS, BACKGROUNDS, 'FLIGHTPATHS', AND CAMERA POSITIONS AND
MOVEMENTS. TO GET A FEEL FOR WHAT THE PROGRAM CAN DO, FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS
FOR LOADING UP AN ANIMATION.

1.  FROM THE MAIN VIDEOSCAPE 3D SCREEN, CLICK ON THE 'LOAD OBJECT' BOX, LOCATED
    IN THE TOP LEFT CORNER OF THE SCREEN.

2.  A REQUESTER BOX WILL APPEAR, GIVING A DIRECTORY LISTING OF THE DISK IN
    THE INTERNAL DRIVE. CLICK IN THE FILENAME 'LIGHTPLANE', FOLLOWED BY A CLICK
    ON THE 'OK' BOX.

3.  THE TEXT IN THE TOP BOX (MARKED 'DRAWER'), WILL NOW CHANGE TO 'MOT'.
    CLICK IN THIS BOX AND DELETE THE CONTENTS.

4.  NOW PLACE DISK TWO IN YOUR FIRST EXTERNAL DRIVE IF YOU HAVE ONE, AND 
    REPLACE THE TEXT YOU JUST DELETED WITH 'DF1:MOT', AND PRESS RETURN, IF
    YOU HAVE JUST ONE SINGLE INTERNAL DISK DRIVE, REMOVE DISK ONE AND REPLACE 
    IT WITH DISK TWO, TYPE INTO THE TOP BOX 'DF0:MOT', THEN PRES RETURN.

5.  THE LOWER BOX WILL NOW CHANGE TO SHOW THE FILES 'BOUNCEBALL' AND
    'FLYPAPERAIRPLANE', THEN CLICK ON THE 'OK' BOX.

6.  YOU SHOULD NOW BE BACK ON THE MAIN SCREEN HOLD DOWN THE RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON 
    AND HIGHLIGHT 'OVERSCAN'. KEEPING THE MOUSE BUTTON DEPRESSED, MOVE ACROSS 
    TO THE OFF-SHOOT MENU, AND SELECT THE TOP OPTION 'OFF'.

7.  MOVE DOWN TO THE BOTTOM LEFT QUARTER OF THE SCREEN MARKED 'CAMERA MOTION'
    CLICK ON 'LOAD MOTION', AND THE FILE REQUESTER WILL REPEAR.

8.  IF YOU HAVE DISK TWO IN THE INTERNAL DRIVE, CLICK IN THE TOP BOX MARKED
    'DRAWER' AND CHANGE THE TEXT FROM 'CAM' TO 'DF0:CAM', THEN PRESS RETURN
    IF DISK TWO IS IN AN EXTERNAL DRIVE, REPLACE THE 'CAM' WITH 'DF1:CAM'
    IN THE TOP BOX. THEN PRESS RETURN.

9.  CLICK ON 'FLYTHROUGHTUBE', THEN CLICK ON THE 'OK' BOX.

10. ON THE RIGHT OF THE SCREEN ARE TWO SETS OF SMALL ARROWS, NEXT TO WHICH
    ARE THE WORDS SKY COLOUR AND GROUND COLOUR. CLICK ON THE TOP UP ARROW
    OF THE TOP PAIR UNTIL 'LT BLUE' APPEARS NEXT TO IT. THEN CLICK UN THE UP
    ARROW FROM THE LOWER PAIR, UNTIL THE TEXT BESIDES THAT READS 'DK BLUE' 
    
11. NOW YOU'VE READY TO SEE SOME ACTION. CLICK ON THE TOP BOX MARKED 
    'BEGIN ANIMATION' AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN, AND MARVEL AS THE AIRCRAFT
    BANKS AND ROLL INTO THE FOREGROUND.

12. PRESS ZERO ON THE NUMERIC KEYPAD (NOT ON THE MAIN KEYBOARD) TO EXIT BACK
    TO THE MAIN SCREEN. WHEN YOU'VE SEEN ENOUGH OF THAT, TRY LOADING SOME 
    DIFFERENT OBJECTS, BACKGROUNDS AND MOVEMENTS PATHS, AS YOU DID WITH THE
    FIRST LOT. MOST OF THE ANIMATION DATA DIRECTORIES ARE ON DISK TWO, BUT
    THE VIDEOSCAPE PROGRAM DOSN'T KNOW WHERE TO FIND THEM, SO YOU'LL HAVE
    TO CHANGE THE DIRECTORIES YOURSELF CERTAIN FUNCTIONS. THIS INVOLVES 
    NOTHING MORE COMPLEX THAN CLICKING ON THE RELEVANT DEVICE BOXES AT THE 
    BOTTOM OF THE FILE REQUESTER. THEY'RE THE ONES LABELLED DF0:, DF1: AND
    DH0:.

DESIGN IT YOURSELF.
-------------------
AS PART OF THE VIDEOSCAPE 3D PACKAGE, YOU ALSO GET A PROGRAM CALLED ROT.
THIS IS WHERE YOU CAN DESIGN YOUR OWN 3D OBJECTS FOR USE IN THE MAIN VIDEOSCAPE
PROGRAM. IF YOU HAVE ENOUGH AVAILBLE MEMORY, YOU CAN RUN THIS ALONGSIDE THE
MAIN PROGRAM. JUST MOVE THE VIDEOSCAPE BEFORE LOADING ROT.

RATHER THAN JUMP STRAIGHT IN AND TRY DESIGNING AN OBJECT FROM SCRATCH, THE
BEST THING TO DO IS LOAD UP AN EXAMPLE OBJECT, THEN MESS AROUND WITH THAT
UNTIL YOU'VE GOT THE HANG OF IT. GIVE THIS A GO: 

1. FROM THE MENU, SELECT 'LOAD A ROT OBJECT'.

2. A FILE REQUESTER WILL APPEAR. CLICK ON 'ROT OBJECTS', AND THEN CLICK ON
   THE FILENAME 'ROBOTHEAD', WHICH HAS JUST APPEARED IN THE DIRECTORY WINDOW.
  
3. CLICK ON THE BOX MARKED 'DO IT!'. 

NOW YOU ARE BACK IN THE ROT MAIN SCREEN, AND SHOULD BE ABLE TO SEE THREE
PROJECTIONS OF A ROBOT HEAD, DRAWN IN TRANSPARENT VECTORS. TO SEE WHAT HE
REALLY LOOKS LIKE, HOLDING DOWN THE RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON, MOVE UP TO THE MENU 
MARKED 'ACTION', AND SELECT THE 'SWITCH TO ACTION EDITOR' OPTION. CLICK ON
THE 'PREVIEW' BOX, AND THE ROBOT HEAD (NOW IN SOLID 3D) WILL BEGIN SPINNING.
AFTER A FEW SECONDS OF FLICKERY ANIMATION, IT WILL HAVE STORED ALL THE FRAMES,
WHICH IT CAN THEN CYCLE THROUGH FOR A MUCH SMOOTHER ANIMATION.
CLICK ON 'STOP' WHEN YOU'VE SEEN ENOUGH. NOW WE CAN GO AND MODIFY IT IN THE 
EDITOR. SELECT 'SWITCH TO OBJECT EDITOR' FROM THE OBJECT MENU.
    
LET'S GIVE HIM A NOSE JOB....
1. DE-SELECT 'SHOW ALL POLYGONS' FROM THE OBJECT MENU

2. DRAG THE POINT SLIDER WITH THE LEFT MOUSEBUTTON SO THAT THE POINT NUMBER
   READS. 

3. THE FRONT AND SIDE ELEVATIONS OF THE ROBOT HEAD SHOULD NOW EACH HAVE A
   LITTLE YELLOW DOT ON THE TIP OF THE NOSE. MOVE INTO THE SIDE ELEVATION BOX
   (THE ONE AT THE BOTTOM LEFT), AND MOVE THE YELLOW DOT TO THE TOP RIGHT 
   CORNER OF THE BOX.

4. NOW THE SELECT 'SWITCH TO ACTION EDITOR' FROM THE ACTION MENU

5. CLICK ON PREVIEW, AND WATCH THE ROBOT HEAD SPIN AROUND WITH HIS BRAND NEW
   NOSE.

AFTER A WHILE, YOU CAN HAVE A GO AT MAKING YOUR OWN OBJECTS, AND USING THEM IN
FULL LIGHT-SOURCED 3D ANIMATIONS WITH VIDEOSCAPE. FOR MORE DETAILED 
INSTRUCTIONS, SELECT THE 'HELP' OPTION FROM ROT'S PROJECT MENU.
