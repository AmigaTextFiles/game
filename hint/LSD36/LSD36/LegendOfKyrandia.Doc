              The History Of Kyrandia 
 
 
  Deep Within The Ancient Forests, the enchanting world of 
Kyrandia has long been known as the most magical of the 
ancient Kingdoms. 
 
  Many centuries before our story, King William the first 
created a covenant with the Natural kingdom.  The residents 
of Kyrandia and the Natural world were made partners in a 
plan of mutual care and protection. 
 
  An enormous gem, now known as the Kyragem, emerged from the 
ground on the spot where King William stood. 
 
The gem was given to the people of Kyrandia by the Land as a 
symbol of this sacred alliance.  It was the responsibility of 
the Royal family to ensure the safety of the Kyragem. 
 
  Before the Kyragem, Magic only existed as unconnected 
fragments of a temporary nature. The Kyragem has concentrated 
the magic in Kyrandia that anywhere else in the kingdom of 
man. 
 
  The simple stone masons faced with the difficult task of 
building a vault to house the magical artifact developed the 
first uses of the Kyragem's powers. 
 
  Originally used as the source of magic for the protective 
covering about the gem itself, the powers were later also 
used during the construction of the wondrous Castle Kyrandia. 
 
  The descendants of these early craftsmen passed on 
knowledge of the magic to the following generations. Each 
geneation added to the knowledge, and expanded the 
applications to various sites throughout Kyrandia. 
 
 Many years later, abuse of the magical powers became common 
and the magic was used daily for even simple tasks.  As a 
result, Queen Thelia the Strict created the Order of Royal 
Mystics to organize and control all magic from the Kyragem. 
Choosing from among those stone masons posessing knowledge of 
the various forms of magic, Queen Thelia established the four 
mystical disiplines of Alchemy, Spirituality, Scrolls, and 
Gem Lore. 
 
  The Royal Mystics celebrate their humble orgins each year 
with the festival of mortar, which is believed to be the 
luckiest week of the year. 
 
 During the reign of King Bernard the fourth, nearby nations 
became jealus of Kyradia's prosperity and declared war. 
Several long years of brtal attacks almost rined Kyrandia. 
Reluctant to use magic as an offensive weapon, King Bernard 
eventually employed the magic of the Kyragem to turn the 
invading armies against the evil of their own commanders. 
Thus began the friendly alliances that endure today with 
Kyrandia's neighboring lands. 
 
 Benjamin the Gardner, nephew of King Bernard, and first king 
of the modern lineage, spent his lengthy tenure occpied with 
the complete re-creation of the forests and natural wonders 
that had been so horribly destroyed by the invading armies 
during his childhood. 
 
  The Roya Mystics assisted Benjamin in his work, and 
installed many of the magical natural wonders that exist to 
this day.  Many historians also credit Pantos, a tailor to 
the court of Kyrandia, with the invention of trousers durning 
this period. 
 
  Recent history has not been kind to Kyrandia.  The 
enlightened reign of King William the Generous ended 
tragically not long ago when Malcom, a friend of the family 
and jester to the court, murdered both king and queen, and 
seized the Kyragem. 
 
  For a brief and terrifying moment, Kyrandia was at the 
mercy of Malcolm.  Fortunately, Kallak, chief of the Mystics, 
and father of the slain qeen, was able to create a magical 
seal that prevented Malcolmfrom leaving the castle. 
 
  Fearing for the safety of his grandson, Kallak chose to 
leave the palace and raise young Brandon in a rural are 
beyond the Timbermist woods and far away from the castle now 
inhabited by the captive usuper Malcolm. 
 
  Orphand as an infant, and sole heir to the throne of 
Kyrandia, Brandon has been kept ignorant of his royal status 
by his protective grandfather. 
 
  Despite its long and gloris history, all is not well in 
Kyrandia today.  Denied further access to the Kraygem, the 
Royal Mystics are unable to replenish their magical stores. 
 
  Reseres are scare, and the Mystics have been forced to 
disassemble more protective enchantments every year in an 
effort to maintain enough power for the spell which restrains 
Malcolm. 
 
  Now Grown To adulthood, Brandon will soon be drawn into the 
madness of Malcolm.  Alone in his confinement, and unsable to 
escape, Malcom has carefully planned his revenge.  He has 
worked against the bonds that hold him and ploted against all 
Kyrandia, as none would crown him king. 
 
 
    At this very moment the shackles which held Malcolm have 
failed! Malcom has broken free, and his vengeful spite has 
already begun to destroy the land.  Brandon is Kyrandia's 
only hope.  You must guide him before it is too late! Focus 
your magic.  Restore the Kyragem, and claim your rightful 
place in the legend of Kyrandia! 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                    How To Play

correct graphics mode and sound card during this pocedure. 
 
  It is always advisable to make back-up copies of your 
master program diskettes to increase the life of the masters 
and uard against accidents.  Follow your computer's 
instructions to make copies of all game diskettes. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                     Getting Started: 
 
 
  The introduction to Kyrandia will begin once the game has 
been loaded.  If you are in a hurry, or have already wathced 
the introductory scenes, you may bypass the introduction 
scenes by presing any key.  If you do, the 'Load A Game' menu 
will appear, and you may either load a previosly game or 
begin a new game. 
 
  You will find Kyrandia easy to learn and fun to play.  All 
characters and game items are activated simply by pointing 
and clicking with your mouse.  The first few scenes are not 
immediately dangerous to the Brandon, so feel free to roam 
about for a few scenes as you get comfortable. 
 
 
 
 
 
           Using a Mouse to Play or: 
           Clicking around Kyrandia: 
 
 
 
  All of the game playing activities in Kyrandia can be 
easily controlled by using your mouse.  Only the left button 
is needed.  The middle and right buttons that you may have 
are not used in this game. 
 
  The mouse is connected to the pointer arrow [cursor] on 
the monitor screen, and any movement of your mouse will 
result in a corresponding movement by the pointer on the 
screen. 
 
  You play the game by moving the pointer to an area or on an 
object and then pressing on the mouse button.  This activity 
is called 'clicking'.  Clicking Brandon Around Kyrandia. 
 
 
   The Main character in this game is named Brandon.  You as 
the player will control the activities and even the fate of 
Brandon by clicking him around the scenes of Kyrandia.  Click 
on the left side of the screen, and Brandon will walk in that 
direction.  Click to the right, and Brandon will obediently 
walk to the right. 
 
 
     In many cases, Brandon will walk to the exact spot where 
you clicked.  In other cases, Brandon may not be able to walk 
as far as you wish.  In those cases, Brandon will walk as far 
as he possibly can.  You can often re-direct Brandon even as 
he is walking if you change your mind. 
 
   You can walk Brandon out of the scene in wich he currently 
appears by clicking on the edge of the scene in the direction 
you would like him to go.  He will walk to the edge, and then 
appear in the adjoining area as it is displayed. 
 
  Notice that the shape of the pointer will change when it is 
positioned on a scene edge or doorway through which Brandon 
may pass.  This is an indication to the player that clicking 
there will exit Brandon from the current scene, and send him 
into the adjoining area. 
 
  Although Brandon can usually walk up, down, left or right, 
he will often find himslef in areas where his movements are 
restricted.  The pointer will change to a NO GO sign when 
there is an area through which Brandon cannot pass. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                Using a Keyboard to Play: 
 
 
The keyboard controls for Kyrandia are similar in function to 
those for using a mouse.  The on-screen pointer can be 
maneuvered by using the numeric keypad.  Once you have 
positioned the pointer where desired, pressing the ENTER key 
or INSERT SPACE bar will serve the same function as clicking 
the left button on the mouse, and will initiate all walking 
and other activities. 
 
 
 
 
              Object manipulation, or: 
              Carrying on in Kyrandia: 
 
 
 
  You can make Brandon pick up, carry, and use many of the 
objects that appear in Kyrandia simply by clicking on them. 
For example: you make Brandon pick up the apple that is 
hidden in the pot in his home by positioning the pointer on 
the pot and clicking. 
 
 
  The apple appears and 'becomes' the pointer.  This is an 
indication that the apple is Brandon's active possesion. 
Moving the Mouse will now allow you to move the apple around 
the screen. 
 
   Once the apple becomes the pointer, several options are 
available to Brandon.  You may have Brandon add the apple to 
the items he is carrying in his knapsack by positioning the 
apple down below the screen in one of his inventory slots, 
and the clicking to release it.  the apple/pointer will 
remain until it is either released into the knapsack 
inventory, released somewhere in the scene, or otherwise used 
or dropped.  Once the apple in his knapsack, Brandon will 
carry the apple with him as he moves about Kyrandia. 
 
  Another option you have with the apple is to make use of 
it.  There are many things to find in Kyrandia, and the 
employment of various objects in necessary to solve some of 
the puzzles Brandon is likely to encounter.  In the case of 
the apple, it may be used by having Brandon eat it.  If you 
picked up the apple and click it on Brandon, he will aet 
apple and an apple core will remain. 
 
  There are also number of actives areas and objects in 
Kyrandia that Brandon cannot pick up.  Clicking on these 
areas, and clicking objects on these areas will often 
initiate actions.  For example: Clicking on the purple pot in 
Brandon's home will expose the contents of the pot, which is, 
in this case, an apple.  Brandon will be as surprised as you, 
and will likely make some comment about finding the apple. 
The pot also has further potential for action.  Once the 
apple has been removed, other items may be dropped in.  The 
apple core may be disposed of in a hygenic manner by dropping 
in.  The apple core may be disposed of in a hygienic manner 
by dropping in into the pot. 
 
   Most of the other people in Kyrandia will speak to Brandon 
briefly upon meeting him, and can be prompted to speak at 
greater length by clicking on them.  Some of the people may 
require that brandon bring specific objects to them [and that 
you click these items on them] before they will continue 
their conversations. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                  The Game Screen: 
 
 
  The game screen in Kyrandia is divided into two distinct 
areas are distinguished.  The upper portion of the screen 
displays the graphics depicting the current location of the 
principal character Brandon.  If you move Brandon far enough 
in one diection, the game screen will change to display his 
new surroundings.  You, as the player, cannot view any other 
areas.  Access to certain areas may not be allowed to Brandon 
unless specific game puzzle condirions are satisfied.  For 
example, Brandon may need to assist Herman in repairing the 
broken bridge before he can cross into the Timbermist Woods. 
 
  The bottom section of the game screen has four parts.  On 
the left side there is a blue gem labeled 'OPTIONS'. 
Clicking on this icon will pause game play and activate the 
appearance of a menu of the choices available to you. 
Further instructions about your options concerning saving 
games, adjusting game controls, and quitting or resuming play 
are availble by selecting and click on the desired option. 
For more information on saving games see the section 'SAVING 
GAMES'. 
 
   The middle of the lower screen section shows two rows of 
rectangular slots which may be used to carry items for 
Brandon.  This area is analogous to Brandon's 'knapsack'. 
Anything placed into the inventory of the knapsack will be 
carried with Brandon from scene to scene until it is either 
used or discarded.  If you wish to store more objects than 
you have slots, you may have to create stockpiles, or 
remember where you left a particular item. 
 
  The right side of the lower screen has an area reserved for 
the display of a magic amulet.  If you are successful in 
guiding Brandon towards its disvovery, the gold flame will 
appear.  The frame supports four gems which may or may not 
become activated, depending on your direction of Brandon. 
Activated gems will be brightly colored, and clicking on them 
will iniiate specific activities.  un-activated gems cause no 
actions, and are colored black. 
 
  In between the upper display screen and the three lower 
areas is a narrow area that covers the full width of the 
screen.  This is called the message box.  Text displayed here 
may either to identify the specific area of Kyrandia 
currently shown or may comment on the status of things in 
Kyrandia.  When you click on the apple the message box will 
say 'Apple Taken'.  Move the apple into Brandon's knapsack 
inventory and the text will read 'Apple Placed'.  Release the 
apple somewhere in the scene the text will show 'Apple 
Dropped'. 
 
 
 
                  The Options Menu 
 
 
   By clicking on the options icon on the game screen you 
will activate a menu which includes headings titled 'Game 
Controls', 'Load a Game', and 'Save a Game' 'Quit Playing' 
and Resume Game'.  Clicking on a head will activate a sub- 
menu within that area. 
 
 
 
 
 
                   Loading a Game 
 
 
 
   Clicking on 'Load a Game' in the main options menu will 
activate 'load a Game' menu.  You may then make a selection 
that allows you to either start a new game, or reload a game 
that you have previosly saved.  Although you may save a 
number of different games, only five will be displayed on the 
menu at any one time.  By clicking on the scrolling arrows 
you may move up and down within the list. 
 
 
                    Saving Games 
 
 
  Clicking on the 'Save this Game' on the main options menu 
will activate display of the 'Save a Game' menu.  When you 
save the game you are currently playing, you may place it 
into a empty slot or you may keep it in an already titled 
slot.  Saving a game into an already occupied slot will 
replace the prvious game with the version you are currently 
saving. 
  Clicking on the scrolling arrows will allow you to move the 
list of your saved game up and down.  Selecting to save a 
game will activate a name box into which you can type a 
description of the game you are saving.  You may name your 
saved games however you wish. 
 
 
  As a matter of practice, it is advisable to save the game 
frequently as you progress.  It is particularly advisable to 
save your game before you explore situations that may be 
hazardous to Brandon.

                       THE LEGEND OF KYRANDIA SOLVE 
                       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
Getting Started: 
 
TREEHOUSE: 
~~~~~~~~~~ 
We start off as Brandon the grandson of... your grandfather. 
Pick up the garnet (red jewel) on the table. 
Pick up the note from the table. 
Pick up the saw from under the table. 
Click on the big pot (you get an apple). 
Leave this place. 
 
 
OUTSIDE: (FOREST 1) 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
Two screens to the right you will find a pond of (salty) water. 
Click on the pond and get a teardrop. 
Proceed to the right. 
A leaf should fall and will turn into a (green) peridot. 
Pick up the peridot. 
 (On your way around this place, you will find an Amethyst. If you do 
  find it, pick it up also.  It's a purple jewel.) 
After you pick up the peridot, go up and then left. 
Here is the Forest Altar.  Pick up a lavender rose here. 
Go to the right.  (The Amethyst usually appears here.) 
Let's proceed back.  Go left, left, down, left, left, left, left. 
Here lies a half-dead willow tree.  Use the teardrop on the willow. 
Merith comes a long at this moment and asks you if you want to play. 
Merith has the marble so follow him to the right. 
Follow Merith until he has disappeared. 
Go to the south.  Go south again and then to the left. 
There's Herman.  He tends this bridge, which is now broken. 
Talk to Herman. 
Give your saw to Herman. 
Leave the cave to the right and go north and north again. 
Go all the way to the left until you can no longer proceed that way. 
Now go up and enter the church building. 
Brynn enters the room.  Talk to Brynn. 
Give Brynn the note.  She will decipher it for you. 
Give Brynn the lavender rose.  You now have a silver rose. 
Leave this place and go south. 
Go all the way to the right and then up. 
Merith should be here.  Just watch. 
Pick up the marble when Merith is gone. 
Go to your right. 
Here is the forest altar. 
Use the marble on the altar. 
Use the silver rose on the altar.  You now have the amulet. 
Now go left and all the way south and then left again. 
You're back in the cave, and by this time, Herman should have fixed up the 
 bridge. 
Now you can cross the bridge safely. 
 
 
AREA 2:  (FOREST 2) 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
Once across the bridge, proceed to your left. 
Enter the hut. 
Talk to Darm the wizard.  He will tell you to find a quill for him. 
Leave the hut and go south. 
This is a small forest and is a near quadilateral shape so it is not 
 hard to find your way around.  During your exploration, you will find 
 certain gems and jewels.  It would be convenient to put these in front 
 of the golden plate altar once your inventory is full. 
Look for three items.  An acorn (on a tree), a walnut and a pinecone. 
 Once you have found these items, go to the screen (at the bottom of the 
 area) where there is a hole in the ground. 
Drop these three nuts into the hole. 
 A Pseudobushiahugiflora will appear and will give you the first stone 
 to your amulet.  It allows you to have the power of healing. 
Now go north a few screens until you see a bird nest with a bird on it. 
Click on the yellow stone on your amulet. 
Pick up the quill. 
Go back to the hut and give the quill to Darm.  In return, he will give 
 you a magical scroll.  You can try this scroll out if you wish. 
Once you have the scroll, Darm will tell you about the birthstones.  The 
 first birthstone you seek is at the fountain in the river. 
Go to the river and click at the bottom of it.  Voila, a SUNSTONE. 
During your exploration around this forest, you should have found 
 quite a few gems and jewels.  (i.e. Onyx, Topaz, Opal) 
Anyhow, the other three birthstones you need are in order: 
        (SUNSTONE) GARNET, TOPAZ, and RUBY. 
To get rubies, grab a few from the ruby tree.  Use the yellow stone on 
 your amulet after you've gotten your rubies. 
Once you have all the right stones and have placed them in order, you 
 will get a flute. 
Now go to the bottom right screen of the forest. 
Here is the entrance to the fiery dragon cave. 
Let's go in. 
Well, here's ol' Malcolm trying to stop you. 
Once he throws one of his knives at you, throw it back at him. 
Malcolm will chicken out but he shields the cave now. 
Here's your chance to use your flute. 
 
NOTE:  Before you enter the cave, make sure you have some empty slots in 
       your pockets.  You will no longer need the flute nor the note. 
       Nor do you need any gems.   Drop the apple outside of the cave. 
       So you should only have a scroll when you enter the cave. 
 
Enter the cave. 
 
 
IN THE LABYRINTH 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
The Labyrinth is pretty deep and dark. 
 If you wish to explore this labyrinth on your own, you can draw a grid 
 map for yourself.  It'd make it a lot easier.

where there is a pond of water:

Okay.  Put all the rocks on the counterweight thingio.  The gate opens. 
Let's get out of here. 
Go to the (wishing) well. 
Drop in the golden coin.  Et voila, you have a moonstone. 
Let's go back into the cave, and into the Pantheon of Moonlight. 
 
To make your life easier again, start at the gate and go: 
right, up, right, down, down, right, up, up, right, up, right, right.

left, left, down, left, up, (cross chasm), up, and right. 
 
We are finally out of this darn cave. 
 
 
AREA 3:  (FOREST 3) 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
Now I'm going to let your worry about your inventory.  When you run out 
of room, drop an item somewhere, but make sure you can find it at your 
convenience. 
 
Go to your right two screens.  You will be clobbered by a tree. 
 
You will wake up in Zanthia's home. 
After a brief conversation, she will tell you to fetch magic water. 
Pick up the empty bottle. 
Go left three screens. 
Here you meet Malcolm. 
Malcolm has taken a magic lamp (or whatever) from the fountain.  You 
 have to get it back. 
I think you go all the way down, one screen to the left, and a few 
 screens up.  You should find a place on fire.  If you are not in the 
 right place, find it yourself. 
Once you find this place, use your magical scroll once more.  This will 
 be the last time you use this scroll so you can throw it away if you 
 like. 
Get the lamp and find your way back. 
Use the lamp on the magical fountain and get some water. 
Drink it.  You now have a blue stone in your amulet. 
Get some more magic water. 
Go three screens to your right to Zanthia. 
Give Zanthia the magic water. 
Another brief conversation with Zanthia and she'll tell you to gather 
 some blueberries. 
Go two screens to the left.  Here would be a great place to drop items 
 which you might need later.  Such as the emeralds, gems, jewels. 
Blueberries are:  extreme South, extreme Right, Up, right, up. 
 Somewhere there.  It shouldn't be too hard to find. 
Get one blueberry, it's all you need. 
Go back to Zanthia and she'll probably tell you to get some fresh 
 blueberries. 
Go get another blueberry.  Come back to Zanthia and she should be gone. 
Put the blueberry in the pot.  The liquid should turn bluish.

------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Go get your sapphire, rubies, tulip, topaz, apple and rose back in 
forest 2.  You need the apple & rose for later on in the game. 
Even though you've used the jewelry, they should reappear. 
 
Make sure to click on the purple stone before you re-enter the cave. 
Once in the cave.  Go all the way down and all the way to the left. 
Get the items 
 
To get the EXOTIC FLOWER go back to Zanthia's place and click on the 
carpet.  You've discovered a secret doorway.  Go in. 
 
AREA 4:  FOREST (4) 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
Well, the exotic flower, should be to the NORTH EAST.  (UP AND RIGHT). 
The exotic flowers are on a beach where there are two golden unicorns at 
the side of a chopper landing place.  Pick one up. 
 
Go and mix your potions now. 
Once you have a blue potion, a yellow potion, and 2 red potions.  Go 
through the secret doorway again. 
 
From here, go: 
 2 screens down 
 1 screen left 
 2 screens down 
 1 screen right 
 1 screen up 
 
You should now be at a place where there are two big green crystal 
towers. 
 
MIX BLUE POTION WITH RED POTION. 
Result = magical purple potion. 
 
MIX RED POTION WITH YELLOW POTION. 
Result = magical orange potion. 
 
These are all the potions you need throughout the rest of the game.  If 
you want to play around with the other potions such as the magical 
yellow, blue, and red potions then go ahead.  They're nothing special, 
nothing to see.  Yellow tastes like furniture polish.  Blue gives you 
hiccups.  And red tastes warm and good (chili?). 
 
Well, since you have mixed these potions, let's go get the Royal 
Chalice.  You may have seen this in forest 2. 
 
Go back to Zanthia's place.  From there, go to the fountain.  Go down 
and to the left.  The grail should be floating in the air here. 
Click on the blue stone. 
 
Hmmm... you didn't quite get the grail did you?  Let's go 1 screen to 
the right.  Click on the door. 
 
Drink the purple potion.  You're inside. 
The pipsqueak wants something good.  So why not a rotten apple? 
Give the pipsqueak the apple. 
Go outside and get the royal chalice. 
Once you have the royal chalice, let's go to the chopper landing site. 
 (You know, the one with the two gold unicorn statues) 
 
Once you are there, drink the orange potion. 
 
IMPORTANT NOTE:  Make sure you have the following before you drink the 
                 orange potion:
