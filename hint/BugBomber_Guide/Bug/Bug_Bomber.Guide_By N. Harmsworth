                    Bug Bomber Guide Version 1.8 (30-4-99)

    This guide is basically the manual that never was...no, actually its
    more like the User Guide that never was! This guide will help you to
    further understand the basics of the game, along with installing it and
    giving you tips & explainations of the options available and so on!

        Full Game:-                            Demo Version:-

@node ENEMIES "Enemies"
Some of the computer opponents (from the manual):-

GHOST    -=-  Can go through walls. IQ significance: for evasive purposes.

RUNNER   -=-  Fast & strong, no special abilities. IQ significance: as above

MINER    -=-  Lays mines. IQ significance: for evasive puposes and
              frequency of mines.

BUILDER  -=-  Builds blocks. IQ significance: for evasive purposes and
              frequency of walls

FLASH    -=-  Really fast. On contact will place Bomb's all around its
              enemy i.e. you and your robots. IQ significance: for evasive
              purposes. (We call it Psycho here of obvious reasons)

@node TODO "My "To Do List"..."

Really, there isn't much to do with this guide now except:-

 - Add some music to listen to while browsing this guide

 - Include a link wherever a different section is mentioned

 - General tinkering

 - Adding an advanced tactics & playing styles section (will replace Tips
   probally!)

 - Installation Script for guide (& demo!). Need to learn the language or
   find a utility (plugin for GoldED!) for Installer! Can anyone help? :)

 - Pictures (to illustrate options, icons, etc.)

 - More info on the enemies i.e. Their skills, strengths & weaknesses

 - "Highest amount of energy" section - The top amount of energy you've
   got when completing a level (Computer Mode Only!!!!!). No cheating
   please ;)  --- It was only a idea !!! ---

 - Convert it into a HTML style guide...might take a while!!?

 - ...any suggestions?

Honestly, it looks alot but it isn't much really!

@node OTHERS "Other Information..."

Other information:-


The demo's 4 levels are not 4 levels in a row that increase in
difficulty slowly - They must be 4 levels that are from various stages in
the game i.e. level 10, 20, 30, 40 !!! with the computer IQ of 3 ??? Who
knows!!

I have (finally) got in touch with Kingsoft who have said they don't mind
this providing I only make the DEMO available (which is obvious really!)
so this is all legal (not that it wasn't anyway).

@node FVINSTALL "Full Version Installation..."

As yet, I'm not sure how to install it to the Hard Drive. The copy I have
wont allow you to run it from the HD. There must be a way around it. I am
looking in to it. Any suggestions???

There could be a HD Install hack/patch on the Aminet/Web somewhere!!??

Also, in order to run the game, you need to Degrade your computer to a A500.
This is also a way of getting around the Graphics Mode problem !!!

Any program like RELOKICK or DEGRADER will do the job ;)
These are easily obtainable from the Aminet! Don't know where they are on
it though! Sorry :(

If anyone needs it, I can send it to them, but you should be able to find
it by searching the Aminet!

@node LIMIT "Demo Limitations..."

In the demo, you get the following limitations (sigh!):-

- Only 4 levels to play (It comes up with the "Game Completed" picture after
level 4!) Although you only get 4 levels, alot of fun can still be had (I've
played it for HOURS and HOURS. I couldn't tell you how many. Too many
probably!)

- The only option that can be changed is the Amount of Players on the main
menu screen (F2 - could be F1 in the demo!!!) so at least you can still have
4 players fighting in unison against the computer - 2 Joystick/Joypad, 2
Keyboard.

Apart from that, all in features in actually playing the game are there -
Quite lucky they didn't incorporate a 5 minute limiter on the demo!

@node OPTIONS "The Options menu & In-Game Keys..."

Firstly, here is the Options Menu / Title Screen explained:-

    F1 - VS Computer / Opponent

Pressing F1 will swap play modes.

To see the options screen when computer mode enabled, @{" Click Here " link compmode}.
                          when opponent mode enabled, @{" Click Here " link oppomode}.


By The Way, you cannot quit the game (and it doesn't multitask either) so
make sure you've saved any work you were doing before you start the game as
you'll have to reboot after you've finished playing!

The In-Game keys are:-

Help - Lose one life
Esc - Quits the current game
P - Pauses the game (pressing it again will unpause it)


Back to the @{" Main Menu " link main}
@endnode
@node OPPOMODE "Options Menu - Opponent Mode..."
Opponent Mode
-------------
In this mode, you will be on your own! You will face all the other
players playing (including the computer if turned on! See below).
This doesn't work by levels, but rather by rounds & matches instead.

This is a great way of playing if you have more than two players as
with two players, there's no skill or tactics involved as you can only go
after one other player. The addition of the energy egg makes all the
difference in this mode!


    F2 - Change No. Of Players

This will change the amount of players against each other

    F3 to F6

This will change the controls selected for the player associated with each
function key:-

        F3 = Player 1
        F4 = Player 2
        F5 = Player 3
        F6 = Player 4

The available controls are:-

        Joy One     -   Joystick Port
        Joy Two     -   Mouse Port
        Joy Three   -   4-Plyr Adaptor Port
        Joy Four    -   4 Plyr Adaptor Port
        Key Left    -   w, z, a, d, LShift
        Key Right   -   Arrow Keys & RShift

    F7 - Few Enemies

By pressing this key, you can change the amount of enemies that will appear
every round. The options are:-

        Few Enemies     -   A few appear (Obvious really!)
        Some Enemies    -   Some Appear
        Many Enemies    -   um...
        Low Random      -   A Small amount of different enemies appears (?)
        Medium Random   -   A Average amount of different enemies appears
        High Random     -   A Large amount of different enemies appears
        No Enemies      -   If you want it 'Just Players' !!!

    F8 - Rounds To Win

All this means is the first person to get the amount of rounds you set it
to wins!

    F9 - Computer IQ Level

Pressing this key will alter the intelligence level of the computer controlled
opponents from 0 to 7

    F10 - Not available in Opponent mode!

Back to the @{" Main Menu " link main}
@endnode
@node COMPMODE "Options Menu - Computer Mode..."
Computer mode
-------------
In this mode, you will play (join forces if you have more than one player
playing!) against the computer where you will be set against level after
level of computer enemies.

This is an ideal option for experienced players as you can make
the IQ level of the computer high and have a real challenge (especially
if you are playing alone). Also, this is the best option for people
playing it alone!

The rest of the options will look like this:-

    F2 - Change No. Of Players

This will change the controls selected for the player associated with each
function key:-

        F3 = Player 1
        F4 = Player 2
        F5 = Player 3
        F6 = Player 4

The available controls are:-

        Joy One     -   Joystick Port
        Joy Two     -   Mouse Port
        Joy Three   -   4-Plyr Adaptor Port
        Joy Four    -   4 Plyr Adaptor Port
        Key Left    -   w, z, a, d, LShift
        Key Right   -   Arrow Keys & RShift

    F3 to F6

This will change the controls selected for the player associated with each
function key i.e. F3 would change the controls used for Player 1, F5 would
change the controls for Player 3, etc.

    F9 - Computer IQ Level

Pressing this key will alter the intelligence level of the computer
controlled opponents from 0 to 7

    F10 - Enter Password

This, although not shown on the screen as an option allows you to enter a
password in order to continue where you left off last time i.e. if you got
to level 33, you would be able to continue at level 31 again (providing you
wrote the password down when it appeared at the end of level 30!!!).

@node AIM "Introduction..."

There really isn't much to it...

The Aim Of The Game is similar to that of "Dynablaster" and "Bomberman" !
In that you run around the screen, dropping Bombs and attempting to destroy
the enemy (or each other when there's more than one player!) to advance to
the next level.

But in this case, it's more complicated as there is more to life than Bombs
(See the Controls section for more details !!!)

So the rules are simple - Kill, Kill, and Kill really!!!

Oh, and by the way, here are the characters names:-
(In case you're wondering!)

Red Player - Punky
Green Player - Martian
Blue Player - Jailbird
Yellow Player - Neando

@node FUTURE "Plans for the future :)"

"What next?" you may ask!

I intend to cover every aspect of the game full version and demo (at least)
including tips, tactics and the like!!!

-=- New Projects (since last update!) -=-

By the way: As now I'm pretty with many projects (not including this guide),
            the updates are DEFINATELY becoming less frequent.

- GoAD = A few months ago, A group and mailing list was setup called
         The Gathering of Amiga Developers (GoAD). I'm happy to be one
         of this group. I am the webmaster for the group as well as being
         the Text Writer for the current game being produced - Cauldron 2000.
         At the moment, we have everyone we need really, except for coders so
         if you think you're up to it, please contact us but check out the
         website first to get some info as to what we are about, etc. Ta!


Projects I'm working on/Have worked on:-

- Guide for Frontal Assault by James Daniels.
  This I have still a fair bit to do. If anyone has any queries to this
  game, please @{" Contact " link Contact} me about it and I'll see what
  I can do...

- Assisted in documentation updating for the DICE (C Programming Env.)
  package. Also in charge of the Official DICE web site which is now
  up and running! http://drummond.u-net.com/DICE

- And of course, this guide updating!

There are other projects which aren't final so I'm keeping them top-secret
until I know if they are going ahead! Watch this space!

Everything mentioned here is available on the Aminet 
i.e.  Frontal Assault (this is probably found in the game/2plr section!)
        DICE 3.16 (devs/c)
        Bug Bomber guide (as you already know, game/2plyr)
If you can't find it where I've guessed they are, try searching for a 
keyword i.e. DICE
             Frontal
             Bug

That should help you find the relevent file!

Also one idea I have come up with is that if there is a game you have trouble
with or you'd just like a guide for it like this - providing I have the
game, I will compile a guide for you. So then, any requests??? The type of
games I'm likely to have are Populous I & II, Civilization & Colonization,
etc. Plus Eye of the Beholder II (I do have "EOTB I" but I've lost the
manual - actually, I got it from a market and I didn't check its contents
when I bought it but for 3 quid, you can't complain can you? Well...

In the future, I will include a list of all the game I have available
(that I could possibly write guides for) but until then, I'm open to
suggestions/offers!

@NODE Needs "What specs ya Amiga needs to have"
OK. Ready for a shock? Good, coz this is the requirements:-

    - An Amiga ...

Yes, that's it! Strangely enough because it's an old game (1991 Copyright)
so it was probally design to run on a basic A500. This I haven't tested as
I don't have one but what I have is pretty strange:-

    - A Amiga CD32 with a SX-1 module unit thing in the back which
      houses a 4MB SIMM card (altogether 6MB RAM) and a humble
      internal 250MB HD (desperately need a bigger HD! Any offers???)

That's my system. You could say I have a slightly upgraded A1200!

I have tried it on a A500 (could be a A500+) that's got a ram expansion in
it and it works fine on that!

   ***@{FG shine}IMPORTANT@{FG text}***
Be warned though that if you have anything graphically superior to an ECS
system i.e. AGA, graphics card, etc., make sure you boot with the graphics
mode (on the 'hold-mouse-buttons-down-while-switching-on' menu) as Original
(or whatever the top one i.e. the most useless one! Sorry A500 owners 8> )
Mode. This is because when you start the game, you will get a graphics up
as a load of garbage and will not be able to play it (unless your God!).
This doesn't always happen (as I've been told) but it does to me on my
system. Please let me know how you get on with your system(s).

Apart from that, there isn't anything else required.

In the game, you can use a 4-player adapter (the one used in Dynablaster!)
so you can use 4 joysticks/pads, and according to my sources, it does work!

@ENDNODE
@NODE DVInstall "The Installation - Maybe complex to some!"

Right then...Installing it!

The file 'mainpart' needs to be where it is assigned in the program
'BugBomber'. Confused?

Thought so, but it simply means that '@{FG fill}mainpart@{FG text}' has to be in the @{FG fill}Bug:@{FG text}
assign which you will have to assign in your @{FG fill}user-startup@{FG text} (or
startupsequence) in the @{FG fill}s@{FG text} drawer of your hard drive or floppy disk but
usually where the For example:

@{FG shine}assign Bug: Dh0:Games/BugBomberDemo@{FG text}

or wherever you put the game should be fine but make sure you call the
assign 'Bug:' otherwise the program will go wrong and you'll get the screen
all messed up.

Also remember about setting the right graphics mode.
(See ***@{FG shine}IMPORTANT@{FG text}*** on the @{" Requirements " link Needs} page!)

Right, I think that's the Installation sorted out. In case you want it
again then very simply:

- Put BugBomber and Mainpart in a directory wherever you like
- Assign Bug: in your s:User-Startup to wherever you put the above directory
- Reboot using the Original display type thing (if needed)

Bob should be your uncle and you should be able to see the starting screen 
when running the game.

@NODE Controls "Controling your players..."

I shall attempt to explain all the moves/features as best I can!

Up, Down, Left, Right move the guy you control Up, Down, Left, and yep, you
guessed it, Right. Now things get more complicated :)

By holding down fire and letting go again will drop a block on the location
you are standing.

The following are moves activated by holding down the fire button and
moving the corresponding way on the joystick/joypad/keyboard.
(Don't worry, you'll see what I mean when you try it!!!)

I've included the keyboard controls in the table in case you don't know
them!


   Function      | Key Left |  Key Right |   Action            | En. Points
 ================+==========+============+=====================+===========
  Tapping Fire   |Left Shift|Right Shift | Lays block          |   (1)
 ----------------+----------+------------+---------------------+-----------
 Fire & Up       |   W      |Up Arrow    | Drops a bomb        |   (1)
 Fire & Right    |   D      |Left Arrow  | Drops a thunderbolt |   (2)
 Fire & Left     |   A      |Right Arrow | Lays a mine         |   (2)
 Fire & Down x1  |   X      |Down Arrow  | Lays a energy egg   |   (4)
 Fire & Down x2  |   X   x2 |  "    "  x2| Lays a painter egg  |   (5)
 Fire & Down x3  |   X   x3 |  "    "  x3| Lays a cruncher egg |  (10)
 Fire & Down x4  |   X   x4 |  "    "  x4| Lays a hunter egg   |  (15)
 Fire & Down x5  |   X   x5 |  "    "  x5| Lays a tank egg     |  (20)

Right, that should have you nicely confused. If you are wondering what
'x3' is meant to mean, it means tapping down three times i.e.

- Hold Fire Button down
- tap down once...twice...and again
- Release fire button
- Voila, one cruncher egg

Be careful not to push/tap another way while doing the process otherwise
you end up doing something else instead! Practice is the key. Getting it
right is all important in mastering the game.

I'll explain what en. points means later!

Right, you have the controls there and what they do but what do the things
they do do????

@NODE Problems "Troubleshooting & Problems..."

(Under Construction...)

You shouldn't experience any problems except:-

 - The @{" graphics mode " link requirements} problem

 - On the DEMO ONLY (it hasn't come up in the game yet!), the "fast"
   (you know the ones I'm taking about!) sometimes get carried away and
   start corrupting graphics. Usually they will either shoot off the
   side of the screen or will just go into the floor and corrupt the
   graphics in the surrounding blocks when you walk over them. This is
   a problem in the game and cannot be fixed! :(
   If it happens, you can usually hit HELP to lose a life and then you
   should be OK! Sometimes it will crash the computer too so you'll have
   to reload!

 - It has crashed for no reason what so ever!

@ENDNODE
@node Tips "And a few tips..."

 Just a few tips to keep in mind...

 - New: It may sound obvious but try not to let the enemy group up together.
   They are much more vunerable if they are scattered throughout the screen.
   This is most important with Tanks as if there are a big group of
   intellegent tanks, you may not be able to get a shot in yourself before
   you get wiped out (if you don't have much energy left)!

 - Remember too that only a certain amount of hatched creatures i.e. tanks,
   enemy droids, etc. can be on screen at one time which means that once
   that limit is reached, nothing else will hatch (including your own eggs)
   until something is destroyed i.e. a enemy tank, painter, etc. but the
   eggs don't stop appearing unfortunately.

 - Be careful of a chain reaction when there are so many eggs on the screen
   as eggs also explode and can lead to a BIG chain reaction as one will
   explode on to another one which will explode...etc and so on.

That's it really on the simple terms

If you are on a level and cannot get further, try some of @{" these " link codes} to get you
on your way...but only use them if you're desperate !

Thanks for reading (if you got this far) and I hope to start a user group
soonish. Dunno what I'll call it yet but keep your eyes out for me.

@node OBJECTS "Objects & General info..."

I think I should point out the icons and display on the side of the
screen when you start a game.

The game screen is split into two areas (roughly):-

The area you control the players and the area that shows your player(s)
stats. You have your energy level indicated by the numbers, then the
picture of your player so you can identify him (or her case you happen to
be female!) and a little status box which will show you what your current
action is when you push down on fire and (try to) perform a move. It's a
handy way of keeping track on where you are in a complicated move i.e.
laying a hunter egg!

In this game, you have intelligence. Not you, but the players rather
{though it helps if you do too :) } and this is indicated next to the
status box by a sad/happy face. Now this may be obvious but the happier
your face is, the more intelligent you are and in order to become
'intelligent', you need to pick up IQ+ icons which randomly appear around
the screen.

There are a limited amount that appear so help other players by not
collecting IQ's if you already have full IQ (very happy face! There is a
limit as to how far it will go!).

This is also true with energy icons (EN+) which give you 25 energy points
(thus en. points - see above) and are vital in survival. Yes, this is a
strategic game. There are lots of ways to go about the game but I am not
going to spoil it for you. Only if you ask nicely!!

On the controls section, I included the amount of energy each action takes
(yes, you don't get it all for free you know!) so you do have to make
things count on this game! Of course, it doesn't cost any energy points to
walk around! (But be wary that the less energy points you have, the slower
you go and vice versa, although there is a point where you can't go any
faster otherwise... Terrible things could, and probably, Would happen :)

Right, the bomb! The bomb will explode after a certain period of time. This
all depends upon how much IQ you have (this is an important feature of the
IQ. This affects pretty much everything you do really as I shall go on to
explain...) as the more IQ you have, the longer it will take to explode!
The bomb damages anything in its path so be careful it doesn't damage
you!!!

(Getting hit in an explosion will take off 25 Energy points! Be careful
when you're lacking on points. Get your friends playing with you to help
you out!)

A mine will do the same as a bomb but obviously won't explode until a) An
enemy walks over it (You or the other players don't set it off! Phew!), or
b) It has been left for a certain period of time (dependant on IQ again!)

A block is a block. Use it for..... I'll let you work that out. It is
probably one of the most useful things except from....

The thunderbolt! The weapon of doom against the enemy. Laying one of these
will cause those vertical and horizontal lines to be danger zones for the
enemy as if an enemy steps into the 'line of fire', the thunderbolt will
shoot off and attempt to hit the enemy (like a homing missile!). But of
course, it will only stick to the line it is moving along and explode where
the enemy was (otherwise it would be a bit to chaotic) so remember to lay a
few along the line!

Now for the eggs! Remember that they have to a) hatch which takes time (The
good ol' IQ factor comes into play again as to how much time!) b) cost more
energy points than a simple bomb, mine, etc. (see earlier), and c) The
amount of IQ ALSO affects their PERFORMANCE as to what they do and act i.e.
walking into enemy mines, etc.

A energy egg isn't really used in this demo except for transferring energy
from one player to another (tip for you there!) so don't bother with this
that much!

A painter egg is very useful in that it 'paints' over ANY EGG it crosses,
even the enemies (which simply means it will become your follower and part
of your team!) so you can gain a great deal of helpers at not much of a
cost. It isn't particularly strong so keep this in mind when you are
creating it and thinking statistics!

A cruncher egg has the simple use of destroying blocks in it's way! Not
really useful unless you're trapped in and need to get out without
destroying yourself, etc.

Hunter eggs are good as they have strong armour and can withstand alot of
damage. They try and home in on enemies with the sole purpose of damaging
the enemy by ramming it. This does affect the hunter but usually it will
survive depending on the strength of the enemy.

Tank eggs are the ultimate fighting machine, or are at least meant to be.
Basically, they are a strong force that can shoot thunderbolts at the enemy
the same way as the players can. Only snag is that they are only any good
if you have ALOT of IQ and also that they cost 20 Energy points to produce.
Ouch! Overall worth making though. Could be used as a scout or...

@NODE Thanks "My thanks fly to..."

My thanks must go to:-

 - Kingsoft for releasing the game and Volker Wertich for creating it!

 - Dietmar Eilert who made GoldED (possibly the best editor this side of the
   millenium!). Keep up the good work :) I advise everyone to at least try
   it - It's large for an editor but has so many features, it'll have
   something for everyone :) (I'm using GoldED 4.7.3 in case you were
   wondering. I can't afford to register and buy the full version although
   I recommend you do!)

 - Anyone who contacts me regarding...well...anything really, but mainly
   news about the game!

 - Thanks to:-

        Mike Bailey for some manual information
        'String' for the shortcut & file !

 - You for trying it out and taking the trouble to read this guide. Staying
   up until the early hours of the morning seems to be worth it now :)

@NODE History "History"

As it's version 1.0, there is no History as such except for this possibly:-

V0.9        Readme included in Archive. <not uploaded to Aminet!>

So here comes the history so far (The date is by the way, the date of
finishing that particular version):-

17-10-98
    V1.0    Readme converted to Guide (used a guide 'plugin' for GoldED
            which made this guide easy to make & edit!). A bit more info
            included (I think. Made it more easier to understand)!
            <Not Uploaded to Aminet!>

18-10-98
    V1.01   Used the info in the Doc (ReadMe) I made to fill up this guide.


22-10-98
    V1.02   Just a few small changes to the general look of the guide.
            Added the Future page too. Will be the second upload (I worked out
            how to do it!!! :>) to the Aminet. Only includes Guide and ReadMe
            At The Moment ...

03-11-98
    V1.5    It's a big jump as I'm now covering the actual full version also!
            I've basically changed every page and changed the layout (again).
            Pages I've added are:- Limitations, Other Info, To Do List,
            Options & In-Game Keys, and The Aim Of The Game! The next update
            will contain the demo unless told otherwise ;)

07-11-98
    V1.6    Yet more fiddling with the layout (It's best viewed with the
            DigiBoosterEd Font - email me if you need it :> or a smaller
            font than Topaz 8 ).
            The To Do List was there but I forgot the button for it :( This
            is now fixed! :)
            I've added a bit more information in various places of the guide
            such as the @{" options " link options} menu.
            The @{" Controls " link controls} section has been updated too!
            Getting near to not being able to think of improvements :)

19-11-98
    V1.65   Not really worth the download (or upload in my case!) as I've
            done very little this week. Tonight I've updated the To Do List
            (and this part also). Also I've included a level code page (see
            the @{" tips " link tips} page) and fiddled about a little.
            Next week's update should have music playing in the background.
            (Gulp!)

05-12-98
    V1.70   Updated various parts of the guide that are irelevant (as I've
            got hold of Knigsoft!). Messed around with other little bits
            too. The weekly update won't be so weekly anymore as I've
            started on other projects. See the @{" Future " link Future}
            section for more info on these...
            Alot of sections have been altered - not by anything much but 
            have just had slight info. changed. Maybe a while before the 
            next update.

30-04-99
    V1.80   Not a whole hell of a lot despite the time gap! Still, added the
            @{" Enemies " link enemies} section. Currently a bit basic i.e.
            What was in the manual. Will improve it in further updates. Also,
            have updated the @{" Future " link future} Section. Added new
            projects, etc. Also added website links to the @{" Contact Me " link contact}
            Section and a tips to the @{" Tips " link tips} Section.
