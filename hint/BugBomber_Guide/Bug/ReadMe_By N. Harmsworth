     The Bugbomber Readme files ! ! !
     ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


OK it ain't gonna be nothing special and it's not 
going to pass any A-Levels or anything but it may 
help a little :)

Please read it as it should help you enjoy the 
game better by providing help as to what does what 
as well as the complicated (to some) setup of the 
program! I've tried to add abit of hUmOuR to this 
readme so it 'should' make good reading! ;)

-----------------------------------------------


 To start off with, let's sort out installing it!

The file 'mainpart' needs to be where it is 
assigned in the program 'BugBomber'. Confused? 

Thought so, but it simply means that 'mainpart' 
has to be in the Bug: assign which you will have 
to assign in your user-startup (or startup-
sequence) in the s drawer of your hard drive or 
floppy disk but usually where the For example:-

assign Bug: Dh0:Games/BugBomberDemo

or wherever you put the game should be fine but 
make sure you call the assign 'Bug:' otherwise the 
program will go wrong and you'll get the screen 
all messed up.

Of course, for the more adventurous people out 
there, you could try changing 'Bug:' in the 
'BugBomber' file to 'dh0:' and have the 'mainpart' 
in the root of dh0:, using NewZap or another 
ASCII/HEX editor.

One more thing though, on loading on the 'better' 
class of machines i.e. AGA and so on, you will 
probably need to hold the two mouse buttons down 
when you reboot or turn on the machine so you get 
the startup-menu-thing (I have no idea what you 
call it !!!) and change the display type to 
Original instead of Advanced, etc. Possibly other 
settings also depending what machine you have!

I have only had a A600 and a CD32 SX-1 before so I 
couldn't tell you what other settings there are to 
be had! (Sorry) You could always try a degrader of 
some sort. There are plenty out there. I can 
always supply you with one if needs be!

Right, I think that's the Installation sorted out. 
In case you want it again then very simply:-

- Put BugBomber and Mainpart wherever you like
- Assign Bug: to wherever you put the above files
- Reboot using the Original display type thing

Bob should be your uncle and you should be able to 
see the starting screen!


-----------------------------------------------


 Alrighty then, A quick look at how to play the 
demo.

The game is Dynablaster but more complicated! 
Don't remember which I played first but that's not 
relevant. I shall attempt to explain all the 
moves/features as best I can!

First up are the controls (gulp):-

Help - Lose one life
Esc - Quits the current game
F1 (on main menu) - Chooses amount of players

You cannot quit the game (and it doesn't multitask 
either so make sure you've saved any work you were 
doing as you'll have to reboot after you've 
finished!

Up, Down, Left, Right move the guy you control Up, 
Down, Left, and yep, you guessed it, Right.
Now things get more complicated :)

Just holding fire and letting go again will drop a 
block on the location you are standing.

The following are moves activated by holding down 
the fire button and moving the corresponding way 
on the joystick/joypad/keyboard (Don't worry, 
you'll see what I mean when you try it!!!):-

 Direction    |     Action            | En. Points
 -------------+-----------------------+-----------
   Up         |   Drops a bomb        |   (1)
   Right      |   Drops a thunderbolt |   (2)
   Left       |   Lays a mine         |   (2)
   Down X1    |   Lays a energy egg   |   (4)
   Down X2    |   Lays a painter egg  |   (5)
   Down X3    |   Lays a cruncher egg |  (10)
   Down X4    |   Lays a hunter egg   |  (15)
   Down X5    |   Lays a tank egg     |  (20)

Right, that should have you nicely confused. If 
you are wondering what 'Down X3' is meant to mean, 
it means tapping down three times i.e.

- Hold Fire Button down
- tap down once...twice...and again
- Release fire button
- Voila, one cruncher egg

Be careful not to push/tap another way while doing 
the process otherwise you end up doing something 
else instead! Practice is the key. Getting it 
right is all important in mastering the game.

I'll explain what en. points means later!

Right, you have the controls there and what they 
do but what do the things they do do???? Well...


-----------------------------------------------


 Objects and general info time!!!

First, I think I should point out the icons and 
display on the side of the screen when you start a 
game.

The game screen is split into two areas 
(roughly):-

The area you control the players and the area that 
shows your player(s) stats. You have your energy 
level indicated by the numbers, then the picture 
of your player so you can identify him (or her 
case you happen to be female!) and a little status 
box which will show you what your current action 
is when you push down on fire and (try to) perform 
a move. It's a handy way of keeping track on where 
you are in a complicated move i.e. laying a hunter 
egg!

In this game, you have intelligence. Not you but 
the players rather {though it helps if you do too 
:) } and this is indicated next to the status box  
by a sad/happy face. Now this may be obvious but 
the happier your face is, the more intelligent you 
are and in order to become 'intelligent', you need 
to pick up IQ+ icons which randomly appear around 
the screen.

There are a limited amount that appear so help 
other players by not collecting IQ's if you 
already have full IQ (very happy face! There is a 
limit as to how far it will go!).

This is also true with energy icons (EN+) which 
give you 25 energy points (thus en. points - see 
above) and are vital in survival. Yes, this is a 
strategic game. There are lots of ways to go about 
the game but I am not going to spoil it for you. 
Only if you ask nicely!!

On the controls section, I included the amount of 
energy each action takes (yes, you don't get it 
all for free you know!) so you do have to make 
things count on this game! Of course, it doesn't 
cost any energy points to walk around! (But be 
wary that the less energy points you have, the 
slower you go and vice versa, although there is a 
point where you can't go any faster otherwise... 
Terrible things could, and probably, Would happen 
:)

Right, the bomb! The bomb will explode after a 
certain period of time. This all depends upon how 
much IQ you have (this is an important feature of 
the IQ. This affects pretty much everything you do 
really as I shall go on to explain...) as the more 
IQ you have, the longer it will take to explode!
The bomb damages anything in its path so be 
careful it doesn't damage you!!! 

(Getting hit in an explosion will take off 25 
Energy points! Be careful when you're lacking on 
points. Get your friends playing with you to help 
you out!)

A mine will do the same as a bomb but obviously 
won't explode until a) An enemy walks over it (You 
or the other players don't set it off! Phew!), or 
b) It has been left for a certain period of time 
(dependant on IQ again!)

A block is a block. Use it for..... I'll let you 
work that out. It is probably one of the most 
useful things except from....

The thunderbolt! The weapon of doom against the 
enemy. Laying one of these will cause those 
vertical and horizontal lines to be danger zones 
for the enemy as if an enemy steps into the 'line 
of fire', the thunderbolt will shoot off and 
attempt to hit the enemy (like a homing missile!). 
But of course, it will only stick to the line it 
is moving along and explode where the enemy was 
(otherwise it would be a bit to chaotic) so 
remember to lay a few along the line!

Now for the eggs! Remember that they have to a) 
hatch which takes time (The good ol' IQ factor 
comes into play again as to how much time!) b) 
cost more energy points than a simple bomb, mine, 
etc. (see earlier), and c) The amount of IQ 
ALSO affects their PERFORMANCE as to what they do 
and act i.e. walking into enemy mines, etc.

A energy egg isn't really used in this demo except 
for transferring energy from one player to another 
(tip for you there!) so don't bother with this 
that much!

A painter egg is very useful in that it 'paints' 
over ANY EGG it crosses, even the enemies (which 
simply means it will become your follower and part 
of your team!) so you can gain a great deal of 
helpers at not much of a cost. It isn't 
particularly strong so keep this in mind when you 
are creating it and thinking statistics!

A cruncher egg has the simple use of destroying 
blocks in it's way! Not really useful unless 
you're trapped in and need to get out without 
destroying yourself, etc. 

Hunter eggs are good as they have strong armour 
and can withstand alot of damage. They try and 
home in on enemies with the sole purpose of 
damaging the enemy by ramming it. This does affect 
the hunter but usually it will survive depending 
on the strength of the enemy.

Tank eggs are the ultimate fighting machine, or 
are at least meant to be. Basically, they are a 
strong force that can shoot thunderbolts at the 
enemy the same way as the players can. Only snag 
is that they are only any good if you have ALOT of 
IQ and also that they cost 20 Energy points to 
produce. Ouch! Overall worth making though. Could 
be used as a scout or...


---------------------------------------------


 Just a few other things to keep in mind lastly.

Remember too that only a certain amount of hatched 
creatures i.e. tanks, enemy droids, etc. can be on 
screen at one time which means that once that 
limit is reached, nothing else will hatch 
(including your own eggs) until something is 
destroyed i.e. a enemy tank, painter, etc. but the 
eggs don't stop appearing unfortunately. 

Be careful of a chain reaction when there are so 
many eggs on the screen as eggs also explode and 
can lead to a BIG chain reaction as one will 
explode on to another one which will explode...etc 
and so on.

As this is only a demo, you only get 4 levels but 
alot of fun can be had (I've played it for HOURS 
and HOURS. I couldn't tell you how many. Too many 
probably!) and the only option is how many players 
you want (1-4) using F1 key. 

That's it really on the simple terms

I will probably update this doc at some point 
should I get another few hours spare :) so thanks 
for reading (if you got this far) and I hope to 
start a user group soonish. I'll probably call it 
Isolation so keep your eyes out for me.

If anyone wants to contact me about anything I've 
mentioned, would like to swap games - general 
Amiga talk or if anyone knows where I can get hold
