                         PLEASE NOTE !!!
                         ---------------

    The ReadMe DOES NOT contain the information that is in the
    Guide file. If you have Workbench 2.0/2.1, you can use the
    utility AmigaGuide to view the Guide file.
    Obviously, Workbench 3.0+ owners need not worry as they can
    use Multiview to view the guide.

    If you have Workbench less than 2.0, you will not be able to
    view it as a guide but if you use the Workbench utility More,
    you should be able to see it as a Text file!

    I will eventually get around to updating the ReadMe that I've
    included with the Guide. My apologies to those with OS 1.3!
