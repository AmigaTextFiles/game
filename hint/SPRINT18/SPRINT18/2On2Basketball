Docs For CHAMPIONSHIP BASKETBALL 2 - ON - 2

CHOOSING PLAYING ABILITIES:

 Once you get to the screen where you are confronted by the following:

 INSIDE       2      OUTSIDE    6
 DRIBBLING    3      STEALING   5
 QUICKNESS    4      JUMPING    4

 you must choose the attributes that you want for the player that YOU will control.  Pushing the button will change the attributes of the statistics that you're highlighting... 

 Once you get through this, you either choose your individual computer partner or the person with the second joystick controls his statistic setting.

 P.S. - The higher the number, the better the ability

PASSING AND SHOOTING:

 Once you get the ball (and you, the lighter colored player, always bring the ball up the court) you can either pass the ball or shoot it. To pass the ball to your teamate, quickly press and  immediately release the joystick button. However, if you pass  the ball, and the other player moves, he will more than likely miss it, so don't pass when the other person is still coming up the court.

 When you want to shoot, hold down the button and keep it held down until the player "cocks" his wrist. It may take a little time to get used to looking for it, but with practice, you can get pretty good at it. Of course, if you don't release the ball before you come back down to the floor, you get charged with travelling.

 To make a hook shot, you must be downcourt, near the baseline, with your back to the basket.

 To make a slam dunk, you must be under the basket and have at LEAST a 4,5, or 6 rating as an inside shooter.

 You can also tip-in the ball by jumping right under the basket.

 P.S. - If a player shoots a basket from outside the white 3-point line, then you get three points. Kinda obvious huh?


DEFENSE AND BALLHANDLING:

 To steal the ball, you must "bump" the offensive player on the side which he is dribbling the ball.


CALLING PLAYS WITH THE PLAYCALLING SCREEN:

 In all the game modes except two-player teamates, you must choose both an offensive and defensive alignment.  When the playcalling  screen comes up, just push the stick in the direction of the play  you want.  The screen will go away once the ball is brought past  half-court.

 OFFENSIVE PLAYS:

 LFT Left Wing
 RHT Right Wing
 TOP  Top of Key
 BKT Basket

 DEFENSIVE PLAYS:

 By the way, to call a timeout or pause the game, just press F7.
