                            ATTENTION

Because of the delays in getting this product ot you, most of which were
due to complications in perfecting modem-play, MicroIllusions has chosen to
release Turbo as it stands: Modem-play is not reliable and not recommended,
but in one- and two-player modes Turbo works fine.  It can work on a 512K
Amiga if all external drives are removed before it has been turned on, but
1 megabyte of RAM is recommended.
