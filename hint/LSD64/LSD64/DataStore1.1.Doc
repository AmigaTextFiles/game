 What Is A Database?
---------------------

 A database is a software program which lets you store and organise 
information on a computer. The main advantage is that once added, the 
information can be easily accessed and manipulated.

 To use a database like Datastore effectively, it is important to 
understand some of the basic computer terminology:

 NAME     MEANS

File      This is the container which holds the data (information).
          In a file, the data is divided into sections, or records.

Record    This is one section of the file (usually one page). A record
          is divided into elements, or fields.

Field     This is an element (usually one line) within the record.

 For example, a file would contain all of the people, a record contains 
one person, and each field contains one part of the person's details.

 With  Datastore, you can easily open, save and close any number of files 
from the Project menu. When you open a file, the first record appears on 
the screen and you scroll through the other records using the Record 
Browser palette (the icons work like the controls on a VCR).

 Page 5

 See Fig 0-1 Datastore with Address Book template open

 You can see that the data is divided into fields.

 To add new records you use the "Insert Record" command (Record menu), or 
click the Insert icon on the "Record Browser" palette. A new record 
appears on the screen with empty fields, ready for you to type new data.

 To change a file (for example, to add new fields or alter the appearance 
of the record), or if you want to create a new file, use the "Change 
Design" command (Edit menu). A range of commands becomes available (Design 
menu) and the "Design Tools" palette appears. You can freely create, 
alter, re-size or remove fields, and create other items such as boxes and 
pictures.

 When you have finished, use the "Edit Records" command (Edit menu) to 
switch off the design tools and return to the database.

 HOW TO USE THIS BOOK
----------------------

 The best way to learn Datastore quickly is by following the Tutorials 
Sections. The tutorials centre on specific features of Datastore, relevant 
to the task required.

                     example, "type mydata in the File text gadget".
                     They are also used to indicate program or disk
                     names. For example, "use the INSTALL program,
                     which is on your DSINSTALL disk".

 Preparing to Use Datastore
----------------------------

 What You Should Already Know

 To set up Datastore on your Amiga, you need an understanding of basic 
Amiga concepts. Before you begin, you should know how to:

 * Use icons on the Amiga Workbench.

 * Use the mouse to point, drag, click and double-click.

 * Start and quit applications using Workbench

 * Initialize (format) and copy disks using the Shell and Workbench.

 * Open, copy, and delete Amiga files and disks from Workbench.

 * Select menus, pull down menus and choose commands.

 * Scroll in windows, and resize and re-position windows.

 * Use requesters and requester gadgets (more information is contained
   in the Datastore on-line help).

 If you are not familiar with these terms or processes, see your Amiga 
owner`s guide.

 Make Backups

 You have been provided with one master disk. It`s important to work with 
a copy of your Datastore disk rather than the original. If a copy is 
damaged or lost, you can go back to the original and make another copy.

 step 1

 Make backup copies of your master disk. Before copying the master disks, 
slide up the small tab (if it exists) in the upper-left corner on the back 
of each disk so that it is in the uppermost position (the tab will no 
longer be visible from the front side of the disk). This locks information 
on the disk, preventing accidental deletion of files and documents.

 step 2

 Now copy each disk as follows. Switch on your Amiga and insert the disk 
titled Workbench. Double-click the Workbench disk icon, double-click the 
System drawer, and the n double-click the Shell icon.

 Type Sys:System/diskcopy from df0: to df0: and press the Return key (be 
sure to type zero, not the letter o).

 step 3

 Now place the original master disk in the internal disk drive and when 
prompted, press the Return key. Follow the on-screen instructions.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT  If you make backups from Workbench be sure to rename the backup 
disks removing copy_of_ and make sure there are no hidden spaces contained 
in the disk titles.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------
 Installing Datastore
----------------------

 You need to install Datastore once before you can use it. Once Datastore 
has been successfully installed, you do not need to repeat the process.

 Floppy Disk Users

 You need to have the following items before you can begin:

 * A backup copy of your Datastore master disk (to make a backup copy,
   follow the procedures outlined in section "Preparing to Use
   Datastore").

 * Two blank floppy disks onto which Datastore will be installed.

 Throughout this procedure you will be prompted to change disks as 
necessary (for example, Insert volume Datastore in any drive).

 step 1

 Switch on your Amiga and insert the disk titled DSInstall.

 step 2

 When the Workbench screen appears, double-click the Dsinstall disk icon, 
and then double-click the Install Datastore icon.

 Step 3

 Before the installation begins, you will be asked to specify your 
knowledge of the Amiga:

 Novice            A basic installation is automatically performed for
                   you. From time-to-time the installer may ask you to
                   insert other disks.

 Intermediate
 and Expert        A basic installation is automatically performed for
                   you. Occasionally, you may be asked to make certain
                   choices that will affect the installation.

 Click Proceed to start the installation and follow the on-screen 
instructions.

 step 4

 When prompted, select the radio button titled "On Floppy Disks" and then 
click the Proceed button to start the installation process. Installing 
onto floppy disk may take some time as the installer need to create two 
disks for you to use.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT If you get a message to insert a disk which is already in the 
drive, then the disk is incorrectly titled and need s renaming.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

 A message will appear to confirm that the installation has been 
successfully completed. Now reset your Amiga with the disk titled 
Datastore in the internal drive and refer to the section "Starting 
Datastore".

 Hard Disk Users

 You will need a minimum of 2MB of disk space to install Datastore to hard 
disk.

 This installation copies Datastore into a drawer titled Datastore on your 
hard disk. Within this drawer, the installer will copy the Datastore 
EasyStart Templates, icons, and the Datastore help files.

 Page 10

 step 1

 Switch on your Amiga and insert the disk titled DSInstall.

 step 2

 When the Workbench screen appears, double-click the Dsinstall disk icon, 
and then double-click the Install Datastore icon.

 Step 3

 Before the installation begins, you will be asked to specify your 
knowledge of the Amiga:

 Novice           A basic installation is automatically performed for
                  you. From time-to-time the installer may ask you to
                  insert other disks.

 Intermediate
 and Expert       A basic installation is automatically performed for
                  you. Occasionally, you may be asked to make certain
                  choices that will affect the installation.

 Click Proceed to start the installation and follow the on-screen 
instructions.

 step 4

 When prompted, select the radio button titled "On A Hard  Disks" and then 
click the Proceed button to start the installation process.

 step 5

 Novice users only - the installer will install Datastore onto your hard 
disk. At the end of the installation, you will be told where the Datastore 
drawer containing the Datastore program is situated. (On most hard disks, 
this will be in the partition titled Work.

 However, if a partition of this name does not exist, the installer will 
make an informed guess.)

 A message will appear to confirm that the installation has been 
successfully completed. Now reset your Amiga as usual (ensuring that no 
Datastore disks are in the internal drive) and refer to the section 
"Starting Datastore".

 Intermediate or Expert users - the installer will ask you to select the 
destination for Datastore (where you wish the Datastore program and files 
to be located on your hard disk). Insert the appropriate disks as 
requested.

 You will also need about 25k disk space in your System partition for 
Datastore fonts and other files.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT If you get a message to insert a disk which is already in the 
drive, then the disk is incorrectly titled and needs renaming.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

 A message will appear to confirm that the installation has been 
successfully completed. Now reset your Amiga with the disk titled 
Datastore in the internal drive and refer to the section "Starting 
Datastore".

 Page 11

--------------------
 Starting Datastore
--------------------

 Floppy Disk Users

 Insert the disk titled Datastore into the internal disk drive and switch 
on your Amiga

------------------------------------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT Be sure to use the Datastore disk, not your DSInstall disk or 
the Amiga Workbench disk.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 To start Datastore, double-click the Datastore icon and then double-click 
the Datastore program icon (you may be prompted to swap disks, this is 
normal as Datastore searches for files located on other disks).

 Hard Disk Users

 Double-click the Datastore icon located in the Datastore drawer on your 
hard disk.

 Personalising Datastore

 The first time you start Datastore, you will be prompted to type:

 * Your name.

 * The name of your organisation. (If this is not applicable, type your
   name again.)

 * Your licence number (this appears on your registration card).

 Click OK.

 You must type information in all three boxes.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT Don`t forget to return the prepaid registration card. Only 
registered Datastore users receive technical support and special upgrade 
discounts.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

 Once you have personalised the program, your mane and details will appear 
every time you start Datastore, confirming that you are a licensed user. 
If you do not personalise Datastore correctly, you will be returned to the 
Workbench screen.

 Page 12

-------------------------------
 Tutorial 1 - Your First Steps
-------------------------------

 This tutorial assumes you have:

 * Successfully installed Datastore.

 * Personalised copy of Datastore.

 * Double-clicked the READ.ME document (which if it exists, will be on
   the disk titled DSInstall).

 * Started Datastore by double-clicking the icon titled Datastore.

 This is what should be on screen:

 See Fig 1-1 Datastore opening screen

 If you cannot get this screen, refer to the previous sections.

 1.1 What`s on The Screen

 Close Gadget: Closes the database file (window).
 Title Bar: This shows the program name, version number and copyright
owner.
 Window Zoom: Toggles between maximum and minimum window size.
 Depth Gadget: This gadget moves the front screen backwards.
 Scroll Bars and Scroll Arrows: The scroll bars are displayed on the right 
and across the bottom of the database window. The scale of the box within 
the scroll bar is directly proportional to the length and width of the 
record. You can move about the record by dragging the solid box, clicking 
each side of the box, or using the scroll arrows.
 Sizing Gadget: Drag this gadget to re-size the window.
 Working Record Area: This is shown by the white area on a blue background 
and represents the record area on which you create your database record.
 Design Tools: A floating palette of icons used for creating elements on 
your record.

 Page 13

 Toolbar: The toolbar is a group of icons to the left of the page. It 
allows you to select various commands just by clicking the icon (each icon 
 
 See Fig Icons Toolbar Icons
 
is explained on the rear of the operating book).

During lengthy operations, Datastore will display messages here about its 
progress.

 See Fig 1-2 Choosing Datastore commands, pop-down menus

 Menu Bar: The menu bar is shown by pressing and holding the menu button 
(Right Mouse Button). It appears in place of the title bar as long as the 
menu button is depressed.

 To choose a command from a menu, press and hold the menu button, and then 
move the arrow pointer over the menu you want (Project menu, for example). 
The full command list will then pop-down, and with the menu button still 
depressed, move the arrow pointer down the list until its over the command 
you want. Then, release the menu button to choose that command (Save, for 
example).

 1.2 Creating a Database

 When you start Datastore, the record window appears, "untitled", and you 
are placed in Design mode. Before you can start adding information (using 
the "Edit Records" command, Edit menu), you have to create at least one 
field in the record.

 1.3 Getting Help

 Anytime you want information about a command or option, you can ask 
Datastore for help. Choose the menu command you want help with, but before 
releasing the mouse button press the Help key (floppy disk users may be 
prompted to insert the appropriate disk).
 You can also ask Datastore for help by pressing the Help key.

 Each help topic has further cross references, which are accessed by 
clicking their button in the text.

 The Help window can be re-sized and moved like any other.

 Click the close gadget to close the Help window.

 (As AmigaGuide menus vary depending on the version of Workbench they are 
not documented in this book.)

 Datastore Requesters

 For help on how to use the requesters and gadgets in Datastore, use the 
AmigaGuide on-line help system.

 Choose Contents (Help menu), click the "Datastore Basics" button, and 
then click the button titled "How To Use Datastore Requesters".

 Page 15

---------------------------------------------
 Tutorial 2 - Creating a Simple Address Book
---------------------------------------------

 When you start Datastore, you start in `design mode`. A blank record with 
a grid appears on screen, called "untitled", which is framed on the left 
and top by rulers, and the "Design Tools" palette appears in a floating 
window. You use the `design mode` to create elements on your record. This 
is how the "Design Tools" palette works:

 See Fig 2-0 Design Tools palette

 2.1 Creating Fields

 step 1

 By default, the Arrow pointer will be selected, so click the Field tool 
and drag an outline of a box on the page.

 See Fig 2-1 Creating a field

 Once created, a requester appears showing various attributes of the field 
(the position and settings of the field). This type of requester is called 
an Information requester.

 The name text gadget will appear active, delete the contents, type Name 
and press the Return key. Then, type the following values in the gadgets 
in the Position group:

 Page 16

 Position-"From Left": 1.00 in
 Position-"From Top": 0.50 in
 Position-Width: 5.75 in
 Position-Height: 0.25 in

 Ensure the checkboxes "Show Name" and "Show Box" are selected, then click 
OK.

 See Fig 2-2 Information requester

 step 3

 Now create an address field. Choose "Create Field" from the Design menu 
and drag a field  outline on the record below the field you created in 
step 1. Type these values in the Information requester:

 Position-"From Left": 1.00 in
 Position-"From Top": 1.00 in
 Position-Width: 5.75 in
 Position-Height: 1.00 in
 Field Settings-Name: address
 Field Settings-"Show Name": On
 Field Settings-:Show Box": On
 Click OK.

 step 4

 Select the Field tool from the "Design Tools" palette and create a field 
below the address for the year of birth. Type the following attributes in 
the Information requester:

 Page 17

 Position-"From Left": 1.00 in
 Position-"From Top": 2.25 in
 Position-Width: 5.75 in
 Position-Height: 0.25 in

 Click Apply and you will notice that the settings have been applied to 
the field but the requester remains on the screen. This is so that you can 
try out different values before closing the requester.

 Now type the following:

 Field Settings-Name:  YearOfBirth
 Field Settings-"Show Name": On
 Field Settings-:Show Box": On
 Click OK.

 Notice that there are no spaces  in the field YearOfBirth. This is 
because field names in Datastore cannot contain spaces. They should also 
be unique. It`s worth remembering that field names are case independent, 
which means Datastore considers the fields HomeAddress and Homeaddress 
identical.

 If you want to use a field containing spaces, deselect the "Show Name" 
check box and create a separate Caption item on the record (using the 
Caption tool) to the left of the field.

 2.2 Saving Your Database

 It is important to save your file regularly. It is now time to save the 
database you created. As this is the first time you save the database, you 
will need to give it a name.

 step 1

 Choose Save from the project menu (single floppy disk users may need to 
swap disks).

 See Fig 2-3 "Save Datastore File" requester

 Page 18

 step 2

 The "Save Datastore File" requester will appear (since the file is 
untitled).

 In the File text gadget type My Address Book and click Save (if the file 
already exists, you will be prompted to confirm whether you wish to over- 
write it). The database stays on the screen after you save so that you can 
continue working on it. Notice that the window title bar now shows the 
database name.

 To save your database onto a different floppy disk, in the Drawer box 
type the disk name (followed by a colon), and press the Return key. When 
prompted place the new disk in a drive and type the name of your database 
in the File text gadget, then click Save or press the Return key.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT You need to save your work on the disk by choosing the Save 
command at the end of each session. It is wise to save your database about 
ever 10 minutes as you work. This ensures that your work will not be lost 
if there should be a power cut or other problem causing the computer to 
shut down or restart.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

 2.3 Changing The Format of a field

 The "YearOfBirth" field should only accept numbers (in this example, the 
year date will always be a whole number), therefore the field needs to be 
defined in terms of style and format of its contents.

 step 1

 Select the field by clicking on it with the Arrow pointer. Four small 
boxes (handles) appear on each corner and another four along each edge of 
the field outline. Choose Information (Design menu) to display the "Field 
Information" requester.

 Page 19

step 2

 Select Number from the Type pop-up gadget in the "Field Settings" group. 
This will tell the field to only accept numbers.

 step 3

 The format of the number can also be specified. Click the "Type Options" 
button and the "Number Field Options" requester appears. In the list, 
there are several different types of number format from which to choose. 
Select "Whole Numbers" by clicking it.

 Click OK to leave the Options requester, and OK again to close the "Field 
Information" requester.

 2.4 Creating a Title

 The record need a title to clearly identify which database you are using.

 step 1

 Choose "Create Other" from the Design menu and you will notice three more 
menu commands appear to the right. This is called a sub-menu. With the 
Menu button (Right Mouse button) still held down, move the mouse to the 
right and select the Caption command.

 step 2

 Click and drag an area at the top of the record for the title. The 
"Caption Information" requester will appear.

 See Fig 205 "Caption Information" requester

 Type Address Book in the "Caption Text" text gadget. Then, click the 
Select button to display the font requester, Select DGSansSerif From the 
first list box (you may need to scroll the list), 13 from the second list 
box and click the Bold checkbox. Click OK to return to the "Caption 
Information" requester.

 In the Position-"From Left" text gadget type 3.25 in and 0.00 in the 
Position-"From Top" text gadget. Click Apply.

 Page 20

 The Caption will appear at the top of the record and the requester will 
remain open. If the requester obscures the caption, select the requester 
title bar and drag the requester out of the way.

 Select "Light Red" from the Colour pop-up and then click OK.

 2.5 Using a Simple Address Book

 Before using the newly created address book, it is necessary to switch 
from "Change Design" mode to "Edit Records" mode. Records can only be 
edited or browsed in "Edit Records" mode.

 Choose "Edit Records" from the Edit menu. The grid disappears and then 
the record appears on the top of the stack of other records. The "Design 
Tools" are replaced by the "Record Browser" palette.

 See Fig 2-6 "Edit Records" Mode

 2.6 Inserting Some Addresses

 A database consists of records of data held sequentially that can be 
edited, deleted, browsed, sorted and viewed quickly and easily.

 step 1

 In the first field, Name, you will see a black rectangle. This is the 
Insertion Cursor and shows the position that text will appear when you 
type.

 Step 2

 Type Bertrand Russell and press the Tab key to move onto the next field 
(address).

 Type 5 Philosophers Close and press the Return key to create a new line. 
Type Verse Town, press the Return key, type England and then press Tab to 
move onto the last field. Lastly type 1872 in the "YearOfBirth" field, and 
then press Tab to complete this record.

 Page 21

 step 3

 Insert another record, choose "Insert Record" from the Record menu or 
click the "Insert Record" tool on the "Record Browser" palette. Again, you 
will be presented with an empty record and the cursor will be in the first 
field. Add the following record:

 Name: John Stuart Mill and press Tab.

 Address: Philosph Manor and press the Return key.
                Cornwall and press the Return key.
                 England and press Tab.
 YearOfBirth: 1806 and Press Tab.

 Now add these records:

 (The Character  means press Tab and ¶ means press the Return key.)

 NAME                 ADDRESS                               YearOfBirth

 Descartes           Flat 3b¶Philosophical Flats¶Greece    1596
 Ralph Waldo Emerson The Writers Cottage¶Philoside¶England 1803
 Martin Luther King  19 Speech Close¶The Suburbs¶USA       1929

 It is a good time to save your database again. Choose the Save command 
from the Project menu to save the database to the same place and using the 
same name specified previously. Notice that no file requester appeared, 
this is because the file now has a name. If you want to give the file a 
new name or wish to save it to a different place, choose "Save As" 
(Project menu) instead.

 2.7 Browsing The Records

 You now have a small database with five records in it. These records can 
be viewed on at a time by using the "Record Browser".

 step 1

 If the "Record Browser" palette is not on screen, choose "Record Browser" 
form the View menu to display it. On the browser there are five icons:

 See Fig 2.7 Record Browser palette

 The "Record Browser" also shows the current record number and the total 
number of records in the database (you should be viewing Record 5 of 5).

 Click the first icon to view the first record in the database. The 
browser should now indicate that you are viewing Record 1 of 5.

 Page 22

 step 2

 Click the "Next Record" icon to display the address of John Stuart Mill 
and click again to display Descartes` address.

 step 3

 The Record Browser can be used quickly and easily to sequentially view 
the records in your database. You can also use the menu or keyboard. 
Choose Last from the Record menu to go to the last record, Martin Luther 
King.

 step 4

 If you look at the menu commands on the Record menu you will notice a 
black A followed by a letter to the right of the command. This is the 
keyboard shortcut for the command. The shortcut for the Previous command 
is A-,. This means for the shortcut, hold down the Right Amiga key and 
press the Comma key.

 Press Right Amiga-, to go to the previous record, Ralph Waldo Emerson.

 2.8 Sorting Records

 The records in your database are not in any particular order, but you can 
sort them alphabetically.

 Choose Sort from the Record menu to display the Sort requester (or click 
the Sort icon on the toolbar).

 See Fig 2-7a Sort requester

 Form the Field pop-up in the Level 1 group, choose Name and ensure that 
the Order is Ascend. Click OK and the records will be sorted by Name, 
alphabetically from A to Z.

 Choose Save from the Project menu to Save the database to disk.

 Page 23

 2.9 Finding a Record

 As there are only five records in our database, it is not to difficult to 
find a record you want using the browser. However, if there were several 
hundred records, it would be difficult and time consuming.

 Finding records with Datastore is very easy using the Find command.

 step 1

 Press Right Amiga Shift-, to move to the first record in the database (or 
choose First command, Record menu). Then choose Find from the Edit menu 
and type John in the "Find What" text gadget. Select Name from the In pop- 
up gadget.

 See Fig 2-8 Find requester

 step 2

 Click "Find Next" to find the first occurrence of John in the datavase. 
The record of John Stuart Mill will appear (when the txt is found a 
message appears in the Status Bar). Click Done to close the Find 
requester.

 2.10 Using Reports to View The Database

 The reports feature of Datastore is very powerful and allows you to 
create different sets of data in different ways. Reports can be viewed on 
screen, printed or output to a file for inclusion in a word processor like 
Digita Wordworth.

 Step 1

 Choose Report from the Record menu.

 The list contains all previously created reports which can be recalled, 
deleted or edited. There is also one permanent report at the top, 
"Database Statistics". Click View to view this report.

 Page 24

 See Fig 2-9 "Database Statistics" report window

 Choose "Close Report" from the Project menu to close the window.

 step 2

 To create a report, again choose Report from the Record menu and then 
click New. Delete the contents of the "Report Name" gadget, type 
YearOfBirth and press the Return key.

 See Fig 2-10 "New Report" requester

 step 3

 The list gadget on the left contains all of the fields in the database 
and the list on the right contains all of the fields which will appear on 
the report.

 Page 25

 Select "YearOfBirth" from the "Available Fields" list and click the >> 
button to copy it into the "Chosen Fields" list, then select Name from the 
first list and copy it into the second list.

 The fields in the "Chosen Fields" list are in the order that they would 
appear on the report. In this report, "YearOfBirth" should follow Name. To 
swap them around, select the Name entry and click "Move Before" to move it 
up the list.

 step 4

 Click OK to close the "New Report" requester and then click View to see 
the report in its own separate window.

 See Fig 2-11 "Years Of Birth" report window

 Click the window close gadget in the top left corner of the window to 
close the Report and return to the database.

 2.11 Quitting Datastore

 Choose the "Quit Datastore" command from the Project menu to close all 
database files that are open and exit Datastore. A requester will appear 
informing you that the "My Address Book" database has been changed since 
it was last saved (reminding you to save the file before it is closed).

 Click Yes to save the database, close the file and exit Datastore.

 Page 26

--------------------------------
TUTORIALS 3 - Advanced Features
--------------------------------

 This tutorial is for people with database experience who understand the 
basic concepts of Datastore and the Amiga. It uses the Address Book 
created in the earlier tutorials and changes it into a members database 
for a small club.

 3.1 Changing a Record Design

 This section covers many aspects of changing the design of a record. 
Adding new fields, re-sizing and moving existing fields, as well as more 
advanced formatting features.

 Fields can be moved anywhere on the record and when positioned, snap to 
the on screen grid; this keeps them in alignment. You can switch off the 
option using the "Snap To Grid?" command (Settings menu). (For this 
tutorial leave this setting on.)

 step 1

 Choose Open from the Project menu select "My Address Book" from the list 
and choose Information from the Edit menu.

 step 2

 One way a field can be moved and sized is using the Information 
requester.

 Select the Name filed so that handles (small boxes) appear along the 
sides and choose Information from the Design menu.

 When the "Field Information" requester appears type in the following in 
the Position gadgets:

 Position-"From Left": 0.25 in
 Position-" From Top": 0.50 in
 Position-Width: 4.50 in
 Position-Height: leave unchanged

 Click OK and the field will move and shrink to its new position.

 step 3

 The second way of moving a field is by clicking and dragging it to a new 
position.

 Select the Address field and, with the Mouse Selection Button still 
depressed, drag the field to just below the Name field.

 Page 27

 See Fig 3-1 Field being dragged

 step 4

 A field can also be sized using the mouse. Select the Address field so 
that the handles appear. Move the pointer to the handle on the right 
corner of the field and double ended arrow will appear, this is the Re- 
sizing Pointer.

 See Fig 3-2 Field being sized

 With the re-sizing pointer still shown, click and drag the field outline 
to the left so that it is the same width as the Name field.

 Page 28

 step 5

 As you can see, the Name and Address field outlines touch causing a large 
black line.

 Double-click the Name field to display the "Field Information" requester, 
deselect the "Show Box" checkbox and click OK. This turns off the outline 
around the field data entry area.

 Now do the same for the Address Field.

 step 6

 Select the "YearOfBirth" field and choose Information (Design menu).

 Type the following (the Height should remain unchanged):

 Position-"From Left": 5.00 in
 Position-"From Top": 0.50 in
 Position-Width: 2.25 in
 Set the "Field Settings"-"Show Box" Off.

 Click OK.

 Step 7

 Select the title caption and choose Information (Design menu). Delete 
Address Book from the "Caption Text" gadget and type Philosophers Club.

 Finally, change the Position-"From Left" gadget to 3.00 in and click OK.

 3.2 Saving The Database Using a Different Name

 As the database is now evolving into something quite different, it is a 
good time to re-save using a different file name. Choose "Save As" 
(Project menu), in the File gadget type Philosophers Club and click Save.

 3.3 Creating New Fields

 Now create a few more fields for the new database "Philosophers Club".

 step 1

 The first new filed to add to the club database is the type of 
membership. As there are only three type of membership for the club, a 
"Preset list" field type can be used.

 Choose "Create Field" (Design menu), draw a field on the record and type 
the following information:

 Position-"From Left": 5.00 in
 Position-"From Top": 0.75 in
 Position-Width: 2.25 in
 Position-Height: 0.25 in
 "Field Settings"-Name: Membership
 Set the "Field Settings"-Type to "Preset List".
 Set the "Field Settings"-"Show Bow" Off.

 step 2

 Click the "Type Options" button to display the "Preset Field Options" 
requester.

 Page 29

 See Fig 3-3 "Preset List Field Options" requester

 For this field, three items need to be created. Click New and type 
Student and then press the Return key. Do the same for Adult and OAP. 
Click OK and then OK again.

 step 3

 Create two more fields beneath Membership with the following:

 First field:

 "Field Settings"-Name: Paid
 "Field Settings"-Type: Number
 "Field Settings"-Show Box": Off
 Position-"From Left": 5.00 in
 Position-"From Top": 1.00 in
 Position-Width: 2.25 in
 Position-Height: 0.25 in

 Click the "Type Options" button to display the "number Field Options" 
requester. From the Type list gadget, select "Currency, Two Decimals", 
click OK and the OK again.

 Second Field:

 "Field Settings"-Name: Paid
 "Field Settings"-Type: Number
 "Field Settings"-"Show Box" Off.
 Position-"From Left": 5.00 in
 Position-"From Top": 1.25 in
 Position-Width: 2.25 in
 Position-Height: 0.25 in

 Page 30

 Click "Type Options" and from the Type list gadget, select "Currency, Two 
Decimals". Click OK and then OK again.

 step 4

 Now create a field that will calculate the amount of subscriptions due, 
by subtracting the Subs Paid field from the Subs field. This is done by 
creating a computed field, which is essentially a number field that 
calculates its contents from other fields.

 "Field Settings"-Name: Due
 "Field Settings"-Type: Number
 "Field Settings"-"Show Box" Off.
 Position-"From Left": 5.00 in
 Position-"From Top": 1.50 in
 Position-Width: 2.25 in
 Position-Height: 0.25 in

 Click "Type Options" and from the Type list gadget, select "Currency, Two 
Decimals". Then type Subs-Paid in the Compute text gadget, click OK and 
then OK again.

 See Fig 3-4 "Number Field Options" requester

 step 5

 Now create a picture field for storing small icons relating to the type 
of activity the person wants to do in the club (football, tennis or 
swimming).

 Choose "Create Field" (Design menu) and draw a box outline below the due 
field, then select Picture from the "Field Settings"-Type pop-up gadget.

 Page 31

 Ensure "Show Name" and "Show Box" are selected and type the following 
values in the Position gadgets:

 Position-"From Left": 5.00 in
 Position-"From Top": 1.75 in
 Position-Width: 2.25 in
 Position-Height: 0.75 in
 "Field Settings"-Name: Activity
 "Field Settings"-"Show Box" On.

 Click OK

 step 6

 The last field will be for general comments. Create a field beneath 
Address.

 See Fig 3-5 Comments field

 Position-"From Left": 0.25 in
 Position-"From Top": 2.00 in
 Position-Width: 4.50 in
 Position-Height: 0.50 in
 "Field Settings"-Name: Comments

 Leave "Show Name" selected but deselect "Show Box"

 Click OK.

 step 7

 Choose Box from the "Create Other" command (Design menu) and drag an 
outline from the top left corner of the record to the bottom right. Select 
"Light Green" from the "Fill Colour" pop-up gadget (if it is not already 
selected) and click OK.

 All items drawn onto the record have their own `layer`. Any other item 
can move in front, or behind this layer with the commands "Move 
backward/Forward" or "Send To Back/Bring To Front" (Design menu). In this 
way you can arrange any number of items overlapping each other; this gives 
great flexibility when designing records.

 Page 32

 With the box still selected, Choose "Send To Back" (Design menu) to move 
the box behind all of the fields and captions on the record.

 See Fig 3-6 Box item

 3.4 Validating Field Entries

 Validating a field can be extremely useful. In this example, a condition 
can be added to the Subs field to disallow an entry of less or more than 
100.

 step 1

 Double-click the Subs fields and click the Condition button in the 
Information requester.

 See Fig 3-7 "Field Condition" requester

 Page 33

 Select "is greater than or equals" from the second pop-up and type 0 in 
the text gadget. This means that any amount that is 0 or more will be 
accepted.

 step 2

 Select And from the Operator pop-up gadget, select "is less than or 
equals" from the second pop-up of the "Second Condition" group, and type 
100 in the text gadget.

 The combination of these two conditions restricts anyone to typing a 
number between 0-100 (inclusive) in the field. Click OK and then OK again.

 step 3

 Repeat steps 1 and 2 for the Paid field.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT Do not forget to save regularly in case of power or system 
failure
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

 step 4

 Choose "Edit Records" (Edit menu) and move to the first record in the 
database using the First command (Record menu).

 Ensure that the Insertion Cursor is in the first field by clicking in it 
with the mouse pointer, then press the Tab key three times to move to 
Membership field. As this field is a "Preset List", a requester will 
appear with a list of entries from which to select.

 See Fig 3-8 "Preset List" requester

 Select Student from the list gadget. Click OK to return to the record (or 
double-click an entry to select it and return to the record).

 step 5

 Press Tab to move to the Suns field and type 50.00, then press Tab to 
move to Paid and type 25. Press Tab to move to the Comments field; notice 
that the Due field is automatically calculated from the two previous 
fields.

 Leave the Comments field blank and press Tab again.

 Page 34

 step 6

 When you press Tab on the last field (Comments), the cursor returns to 
the first field (Name). This is because the Tab key cycles through all of 
the fields on the record moving from top to bottom in a left-to-right 
sequence. Pressing tab on the bottom field moves the cursor in the first 
field (shift-Tab moves backwards).

 To use the Picture field, you need to click on it. Click the Picture 
field and a file requester appears.

 See Fig 3-9 "Picture Field" file requester

 Select Tennis from the list and click Insert.

 step 7

 Go through each record adding the following information:

 NAME                 MEMBERSHIP  SUBS   PAID   ACTIVITY

 Descartes            O.A.P.      10     10     Football
 John Stuart Mill     Adult       25     20     Swimming
 Martin Luther King   Adult       50      5     Tennis
 Ralph Waldo Emerson  O.A.P.      10      0     Football

 3.5 Viewing Sets of Records

 If a database consists of many records, it would be convenient to view 
only records that match a specific requirement. For example, just people 
who have not paid all of their bills; or all the people living in a 
particular town.

 One a subset of records has been created, the subset can be exported to a 
word processor like Digita Wordworth, to another database, or even to a 
mailing program like Digita Mailshot Plus.

 To separate records into a subset, you use the query command.

 Page 35

 step 1

 Choose Query from the Record menu to display the Query requester.

 See Fig 3-10 Query requester

 Click New to display the "New Query" requester so that a query can be 
created for all of the people in the club whose subs are overdue.

 See Fig 3-11 "New Query" requester

 step 2

 Replace the contents of the "Query Name" text gadget with Overdue Subs. 
Select Due from the first pop-up in the "First Condition" group, select 
"is greater than" from the second pop-up and type 0 in the text gadget.

 Page 36

 In this example, the query will display any record that has more than 
zero in the Due field (in-other-words, members who owe subs). Click OK to 
return to the Query requester and the "Overdue Subs" query appears in the 
list. Click Done.

 3.6 Using a Query

 A query can be applied to the database at any time to create a subset.

 step 1

 Choose Query (Record menu), select "Overdue Subs" from the list by 
pressing the Down Arrow key, and click Use.

 step 2

 The "Record Browser" can be used to easily navigate through the subset of 
records which you have just created using the "Overdue Subs" query (it 
displays the current record number and the number of records in the file 
(subset in this example)).

 step 3

 Return to the whole database by choosing Query (Record menu), select 
"Show All Records" and click Use.

 3.7 Using Reports

 Reports are used to display lists of information from the records in a 
database. The reports can be viewed on screen, printed or saved as a disk 
file for use with other programs.

 step 1

 Choose Report from the Record menu and click New. Type Overdue Subs in 
the "Report Name" text gadget, replacing the default contents. Select Name 
from the "Available Fields" list gadget and click the >> button. Next, 
select the following fields from the first list gadget and click >> after 
each, to move them into the "Chosen Fields" list: Membership, Subs, Paid, 
Due.

 Ensure the checkbox "Include Field Headings" is selected.

 step 2

 Next click the Titles button to display the "Report Titles" requester.

 Type Overdue Subs Report for (type an extra space at the end) in the Text 
gadget in the "Page Header" group. Select "Current Date" from the "Special 
Codes" pop-up to insert the special code for current date. Finally, select 
Centre from the Justify pop-up.

 step 3

 Type Page (with an extra space afterwards) in the Text gadget in the 
"Page Footer" group, select "page Number" from the pop-up gadget to the 
right, and select Centre from the Justify pop-up. Click OK to return to 
the "New Report" requester.

 Click OK again to return to the Report requester, and click the close 
gadget on the requester to close the requester without viewing the report.

 Page 37

 See Fig 3-12 "Report Titles" requester

 3.8 Applying a Query to a Report

 This report relates to those members of the club who still owe money.

 step 1

 Choose Report (Record menu) and select "Overdue Subs List" from the list. 
Click Edit to edit the report and click the Query button.

 Select the query "Overdue Subs" from the list, click Use then click OK to 
return to the Reports requester. Click View to view the "Overdue Subs 
List" report for today.

 step 2

 The information does not quite fit on the page, use the Printer 
Preferences program (this is contained on the Amiga Workbench disk) and 
change the "Print Pitch" to Elite or Fine. It may be necessary to change 
the "Paper Format" to a larger page size and adjust the margins to allow 
more characters on the page. For more information about printing and 
Workbench refer to your Workbench User Guide.

 step 3

 There are three buttons at the top of the Report , on the "Report 
Ribbon", which performs the commands "Previous Page", "Next Page" and 
"Print". The "Previous Page" and "Next Page" buttons are available when 
more than one page has been created.

 Close the Report Window, either by clicking the window close gadget or 
choosing the "Close Report" command (Project menu).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT If memory is getting low, the pages of a report are created in 
real-time and may therefore be slightly slower than usual.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

 Page 38

 3.9 Protecting The Database

 Datastore can add a password to any saved file so that it is protected 
from prying eyes. Creating passwords, opening protected files and changing 
passwords are covered in this section.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT If you use passwords, remember them! Due to the nature of the 
encryption in Datastore, Digita is not able to help recover files with 
lost passwords.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 step 1

 Choose File from the "Change Settings" submenu (Settings menu) to display 
the "File Settings" requester. Select the checkbox "Save Password With 
File" and click OK.

 See Fig 3-13 "File Settings" requester

 step 2

 Choose "Save As" (Project menu) and a small requester will appear asking 
you to type the password for the file. Use a password that combines both 
letters and numbers for maximum security and make sure you do not forget 
it. Then click OK>

 step 3

 In the File gadget on the file requester type Protected Club and press 
the Return key to Save (you will be prompted to replace the existing file 
if appropriate).

 step 4

 Choose Open from the Project menu, select the file Protected Club and 
click Open. Before the file opened, as it is password protected, a 
requester will appear asking you to type the password. An error message 
will appear if you appear if you get the password wrong.

 If you want to change the password, first open the protected file, choose 
"Save As" (Project menu", and you will be prompted for a new password.

 Page 39

 3.10 Using Librarian

 Librarian is used for storing text which can then be inserted quickly and 
easily many times.

 step 1

 Choose Librarian from the Edit menu. Click New, type This member has 
special dispensation rate in the text gadget and press the Return key, 
Notice that the text has been added to the list. Click the close gadget to 
close the requester.

 See Fig 3-14 Closing the Librarian requester

 step 2

 Using the "Record Browser", search through the records until the record 
"John Stuart Mill" appears. Click the Comments field and choose Librarian 
(Edit menu). Double-click the list entry This member has special.. and the 
text will be inserted into the Comments field automatically. Notice that, 
unless you click the window close gadget, Librarian will remain on the 
screen while you continue work.

 3.11 EasyStart Templates

 EasyStart Templates will give you a head-start when creating a new 
database. They do this by using an existing record design which is blank.

 There are many different EasyStart Templates supplied with Datastore, and 
you may find it quicker to modify one of these databases than create your 
own from scratch.

 Choose New (Project menu), select the template you want from the list 
gadget (select "Blank Record" if you do not want to use a template). 
Notice that a description of the template appears in the box beneath the 
list gadget (if it exists).

 Click New and the template will open into a window called "untitled".

 Page 40

 See Fig 3-15 Template requester

 There is no special procedure for creating templates. Datastore looks at 
the files in the same destination as the Open command and will use any of 
them as templates.

 To change the template description, select the database icon on the 
"Workbench Screen" and choose Information from the Workbench-Icons menu. 
Type the text that you wish to appear in the Comments text gadget, press 
the Return key and click Save.

 3-12 Creating a New Datastore File From a Subset of Records

 You can create a new Datastore file from a subset of records quickly and 
easily.

 step 1

 Use the Query command (Record menu) to separate the records into the 
subset required. Choose "Export Data" from the Project menu, ensure the 
"Datastore File" radio button is selected on the "Export Data" requester 
and click Export.

 step 2

 Type your file name in the File gadget in the "Export Data File" file 
requester and click Export. The export database will contain the current 
subset of records as well as the record design.

 Page 41

-------------------------------------
 USING DATASTORE WITH OTHER PROGRAMS
-------------------------------------

 Importing

 Datastore can use data from many other applications, provided the file is 
ASCII format (the industry standard - plain text format). For example, 
spreadsheets from Turbocalc, databases from Superbase or mailing lists 
from Digita Mailshot Plus.

 step 1

 Export the file from Turbocalc or any other program in ASCII format.

 step 2

 Start Datastore and choose File from the "Change Settings" submenu 
(Settings menu) and select "Turbocalc and Superbase (CSV)" from the Format 
pop-up gadget.

 See Fig 4 "File Settings" requester

 This pop-up defines how the ASCII file is structured. Turbocalc separates 
each field with a comma and each record with a line feed. Other programs 
use different combinations of separators and therefore when importing or 
exporting data, using the correct format is important.

 Click OK

 step 2

 Choose "Import Data" from the Project menu, select the file you created 
in step 1 and click Import. Datastore will try and import the data into 
the current database.

 If no fields have been created, and Datastore is in "Change Design" mode 
it will create its own record layout for the data file by creating the 
fields as it comes across them. Datastore can only do this if the first 
record of the data contains a header (or, the field Names as a separate 
record).

 Page 42

 Exporting

 Datastore can export any record data held within the database as a 
separate ASCII data file. This means that programs such as Digit Wordworth 
can use this information and then, for example, produce a mail merge with 
a form letter.

 step 1
