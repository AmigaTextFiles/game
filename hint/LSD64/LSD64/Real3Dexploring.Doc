                               INTRODUCTION.
 
  Welcome  to our humble little book, which over the coming pages will act as
  our guide to exploring the tremendously powerfull rendering engine you will
  have found on this months coverdisk.

  If  you  have found this tome in a dentists waiting room or on the top deck
  of the Clapham Omnibus, you may be wondering what is going on. This biik is
  meant  to accompany the REAL 3D coverdisk, comprising the complete software
  for REAL 3D 1.4.

  The software will allow you  to  create  just  about  any  object  you  can
  imagine,put it in a scene and render it as a high quality 24-bit image. You
  can even animate your images to create impressive opening titles  for  your
  home movies, or even interesting features in their own right.

  Of  course,  to  be  able  to  do  any  of this you must understand how the
  software works. Thankfully, REAL 3D is fairly easy to pick up and use,  but
  to  help  you  along  in  your  journey  through all things 3D, we have put
  together hints, tips and examples of all major features of the software.

 
                                      (7)
 
                                    OBJECTS.
 
  Obviously, in order to render three realistic three dimensional images, you
  first need to create the objects which are going to feature in your picture
  or  animation. The objects are the very guts of rendering software - if you
  can`t easily create the objects you wish to appear in your  virtual  world,
  you  aren`t  going to get very far at all. Fortunately for you, REAL 3D has
  very sophisticated modelling tools, primitives and  operators,  which  will
  enable you to create just about anything you can imagine. This chapter will
  show you how to take advantage of REAL 3D`s exellent features.

  REAL 3D has two main types of object. CSG primitives and  meshes  based  on
  polygonal lines.

  CSG   primitives  (CSG  stands  for  Constructive  Solid  Geometry)  are  a
  collection of commonly used objects such as  Spheres,  Cubes,  Polyhedrons,
  Cylinders,  etc.  CSG  objects are different from most other 3D programs in
  that they aren`t made up of lots of triangles joined together  to  form  an
  object.  Instead  REAL  3D  sees  them  as the mathematical formula for the
  object which means they are very quick to render and are  always  perfectly
  curved.  This  does  lead to some limitations though. To start with you can
  only perform certain modifications to them, stretching, rotating, etc  work
  but  you can`t, for example,pull a point on the object away to form a bump.
  A CSG object has to maintain it`s basic nature, one end of a cube can`t  be
  rotated, only the entire cube.

  Meshes  are  formed  in  several  ways,  by  connecting  a series of lines,
  sweeping one curve along another, or by rotating one curve around  another.
  The  object  created  by  these techniques is a hollow surface or skin. The
  object is made up from triangles and can be shaded to appear  smooth.  This
  kind  of  object  is  better  suited to more organic shapes whereas CSG are
  ideal for more mechanical objects. The  combination  of  the  two  provides
  perfect blend for almost any type of object.

  CREATING OBJECTS
 
  Primitive creation in REAL 3D consists of two main parts, regardless of the
  primitive being created. The first input for any object is for  the  centre
  or first corner of the object. The second stage actually defines the object
  and may require more than one click of the mouse depending  on  the  object
  type. For example a Polyhedron can have unlimited sides and the right mouse
  button is used to finish the creation, the same is TRUE  of  the  line  and
  tube  drawing tools. Objects such as cubes, spheres and cylinders only need
  two inputs, the centre or first corner and then the radius  or  the  second
  corner. One thing to remember when creating objects is that REAL 3D doesn`t
  use dragging to size objects, each point is defined with a  click  and  the
  mouse  is  moved  to  the next point, clicked, and so on. Mouse dragging is
  used for a different aspect of the modelling process.

  DRAG BOXES

  Any  object  in  a  view  window  has  points wherever there is a change in
  direction of the wireframe. A cube has points on every corner, a sphere has
  36  points,  12  on  each  of  the  3  circles that consist of the sphere`s
  wireframe. These points can have  a  box  dragged  around  them  using  the
  mouse.,  for  example.  Create a few objects in a view window. Try dragging
  around the points on these objects - to `drag`  click  and  hold  the  left
  mouse  button  and  you  will  see a `dragbox` form, When you let go of the
  mouse button REAL 3D will place the curser at the middle of all the  points
  inside  the  dragbox.  Dragboxes can be used at any time during creation or
  modification.

  EXAMPLE Aligning a sphere and a cylinder.

         * Create a cylinder in the front view.
         * In the side view drag around the right  hand  edge of
           the cylinder. This will place the curser at the front
           the cylinder.

  In the front view create a sphere in the following way.

         * To define the centre drag a box that encloses the
           entire cylinder.
         * To define the size drag a small box that just encloses
           the point of the cylinder at the top.

  If  you  now  go  to  the wireframe screen and take a 45 degree view of the
  scene and then render you  should  be  able  to  see  that  the  sphere  is
  perfectly  aligned  with  the  cylinder. No matter how much you zoom in you
  won`t be able to see a join, well assuming the dragging worked!

  REAL 3D has a couple more tricks for dragging  operations.  There  are  two
  keys  that  can be used immediately before a drag, "/" and "=". The "=" key
  is used when you want  REAL  3D  to  only  consider  the  points  from  the
  currently  selected object. This comes in usefull when a scene becomes more
  complex and the wireframes from other objects maybe  overlapping  and  make
  the  drag  difficult.  The "/" key tells REAL 3D to use a 3D average of the
  points instead of the default 2D. In the example above if the "/"  key  had
  been  pressed  before  the  drag used to define to define the centre of the
  sphere then the sphere would  have  been  created  at  the  middle  of  the
  cylinder, not at the end.

  More key commands are described in Appendix 1 of this book.

                                     (15)

                                   HIERARCHY

  Objects in REAL 3D are constructed hierarchically. This means that they are
  organised in a very natural way, for example: A fish lives in a pond, which
  is  in a forest which is in a country which is on the earth which is in the
  solar system and so on. If the country was moved then so would  the  forest
  and therefore the pond and therefore the fish.

  This is how the hierarchy works. Any object can be part of the whole and so
  modifications, animations, or anything else that effects  the  whole  would
  therefore  effect  all  the  parts  that make up the whole. When a scene is
  built in REAL 3D initially only a root level exists and  anything  that  is
  created  will  be  placed  inside  the  root  level.  When creating a scene
  remember to think about the hierarchical structure of the  objects  as  you
  build them, for example:

  ROOT
     SKY

        SUN
        CLOUDS
        RAINBOW
     GROUND
        GRASS
        TREES
        HILLS
     HOUSE
        WALLS
        WINDOWS
        GARDEN
           FLOWERS
           SWIMMING POOL

  The  structure  above shows a natural layout for the scene. The SKY, GROUND
  and HOUSE are all seperate elements  inside  the  ROOT  level.  This  means
  moving  the  house  to  a  new place would only involve selecting the HOUSE
  object and performing the move. If the WALLS, WINDOWS and GARDEN  were  all
  just  placed inside the ROOT level the move operation would have to be done
  three times, once for each object.

                                     (19)

                                   MATERIALS

  Creating  photorealistic  objects  isn`t  just  about making them the right
  shape. many similarly shaped objects in the real world throw back light  in
  a  completely different way, like an orange and a ball bearing. To properly
  model objects, these properties of  different  types  of  surface  must  be
  modelled too. REAL 3D does this by using materials.

  REAL  3D`s  materials  consist  of two main aspects, surface properties and
  textures. Surface properties are items such as how  brilliant  (reflective)
  or  transparent  an object is. Textures are image files that are wrapped on
  to the object for colour, bumpmaps, etc.

  To create a new material you first need to  open  the  material  window  by
  selecting Project>Materials from the menus.

  NAME

  Click on this button to name a new material or to select an existing one.

  TXTR. INDEX

  This  button is used to define the total number of frames used in a texture
  sequence.  The  format  for  the  filename  is  as  follows:  frm0,   frm1,
  frm2,,,,frm99,,,,frm546,  etc If the txtr index is greater than 0 then REAL
  3D will automatically append the current frame number to the filename  when
  the  scene is rendered, the software will cycle through the frames it finds
  untill the animation is finished.

  BRILLIANCY

  This  is  a  surface property which defines how reflective the material is,
  the higher the setting the more reflective the material will be.

  TRANSPARENCY

  This slider defines how much light is transmitted through the object. Don`t
  confuse  transparency with how `see through` the object is. To make a glass
  material you need to use brilliancy as well as  transparency,  transparency
  on it`s own can be used for making materials like paper.

  SPEED OF LIGHT

  This  defines  the  refraction index of the material. A value of 100 is the
  same as air, the lower the value the more the light will be bent.  A  value
  of  around 64 is good for glass. Because REAL 3D deals with with refraction
  properly, and as it is a solid modeller, you can even construct  a  working
  lens object.

  TURBIDITY

  Defines  how  foggy  the  material  will  be,  or how the light is randomly
  scattered while it`s inside an object. The  higher  the  setting  the  more
  `foggy` the material is.

  SPECULARITY

  Defines  how  sharp  the specular reflections will be on the surface of the
  object. The higher the values the the  smaller  and  sharper  the  specular
  highlights.

  SPEC. BRIGHTN

  Used  in  conjunction  with  specularity  to define how bright the specular
  highlights appear.  Note  that  the  actual  brightness  of  the  highlight
  ultimately  depends  on the colour of that object at any given point. If an
  object is completely black then the highlights will  never  appear  as  all
  light hitting the object is absorbed.

  BUMP HEIGHT

  Defines the maximum bump height to be used when creating a bumpmap.

  PICTURE

  Path  and  filename  of  a  picture to be used for colour, bump, or special
  mapping. Note that REAL 3D classic only supports 2,4,8,16,32,64  (EHB)  and
  HAM colour images - it will read images created in AGA screen modes but the
  image will be rendered incorrectly. The select and show buttons do  exactly
  what  they  say,  let  you  select  and  view the IFF image being used as a
  texture.

  MAPPING

  Specifies the type of mapping to be used. PARALLEL -  the  mapping  uses  a
  rectangle proportional in size to the IFF image.

  CYLINDER  -  The  image  is wrapped around a cylinder, the X direction goes
  around the circumference and the Y direction travels along  the  length  of
  the cylinder.

  SPHERE  - Similar to cylinder mapping, but the top and bottom are `pinched`
  in to create a sphere. Default - This mapping has no shape so it only makes
  sense  to  use  it with materials that do not use a texture, such as glass,
  chrome, etc.

  NO 0 COLOUR

  The first colour in the image map`s palette is treated as  transparent  and
  so  the  objects base colour will be visible through any parts of the image
  with colour 0.

  MAPTYPE

  COLOUR - Set this button to use the IFF to define the colour of the object.

  BUMP - Set this button to make the material a bumpmap. The  height  of  the
  bumps  depends  on  the red value of the IFF image, the more red the higher
  the bump.

  SPECIAL - This is a special  type  of  mapping  that  defines  a  different
  property  from  each  colour  component.  Red defines the bump height, blue
  defines the brilliancy, and green  defines  transparency.  Special  mapping
  means  you can have a single material define all three properties to create
  some very unique effects.

  CLIP - This allows the IFF to `cut` away parts of the object  the  material
  is  applied  to.  The  No 0 Colour button has to be set for clip mapping to
  work. When active any part of the IFF that is colour 0 will be removed from
  the  object.  A  simple example would be a mesh fence, rather than building
  thousands of individual objects to make the fence a clip map could be  used
  to `cut` the holes into a simple rectangle.

  GRADIENT

  When  an  IFF  is  used  for colour mapping you may notice that as you move
  close to the object the IFF starts to  become  pixelated  or  chunky.  This
  happens  because  the  way the image is being mappedonto the object and the
  size and/or closeness of the object  means  the  IFF  is  in  effect  being
  enlarged. To prevent this happening REAL 3D can detect these situations and
  instead create a gradient from one pixel to the next in the image map. This
  smoothes out the pixels but will soften the image slightly. The gradient is
  a good way of making smooth colour gradients,  e.g..  Create  a  1x2  pixel
  image, the top pixel being white, the bottom one black. Use this image in a
  material with vertical gradient and apply it to  a  rectangle.  Render  the
  rectangle  so  that  it nearly fills the screen and you will have a perfect
  gradient.

  TILE, FLIP AND ANGLE

  These three settings control exactly how the  image  map  is  wrapped  onto
  objects.  Tile  tells  the images to tile infinitely instead of the default
  once. Flip will mirror the image every time it is  tiled.  This  means  the
  images  doesn`t  have to have each side matching the other in order to have
  seamless edges when tiling. Angle defines how many  degrees  the  image  is
  wrapped  around before it tiles when using sphere or cylinder mapping. When
  using cylinder mapping only the first angle is used, Sphere uses both.

  UNSHADED

  When active Unshaded tells REAL 3D not to perform any shading  calculations
  on  this  material.  The  colour of image or the object will remain at full
  brightness regardless of lights and shadows.

  SMOOTH

  When set surface reflections will be removed from any glass like objects. A
  glass  material  will no longer have reflections. Smooth is often used with
  Turbidity to create fogs.

  LIGHTS

  There is no limit to the number of  lights  sources  or  their  colour.  By
  default REAL 3D will use auto-exposure when rendering. This mode calculates
  the amount of light falling at the  origin  (0,0,0)  and  then  scales  the
  brightness  of  all  lights to keep the origin correctly lit. This has some
  disadvantages though, imagine a scene of a car driving through  a  city  at
  night.  As  the  car  gets nearer it`s lights will be casting more and more
  light on the origin. As this happens REAL 3D  will  make  them  darker  and
  darker  in order to maintain a constant lightlevel for the scene. Obviously
  this is incorrect and so auto-exposure can be turned off.

  Doing so gives you full control over the lights, to change  the  brightness
  of  a  light  simply change it`s colour. When the car moves now it`s lights
  will no longer be effected and the scene will  be  correctly  lit.  Working
  without  auto-exposure  can  be tricky but heres a couple of tips that will
  help.

  * If the scene is too bright try making it bigger  by  selecting  the  root
  level and re-sizing it. This increases the distance the light has to travel
  and in effect reduces the brightness. The reverse is TRUE if the  scene  is
  too dark.

  *  The  colour  of  a light can be above 15, upto 100 in fact so if a light
  isn`t giving enough light you can always increase it`s brightness.

                                      (29)

                               BOOLEAN OPERATIONS

  You may have come across the term Boolean Operator in a maths class at some
  stage,  if  you  were  paying  attention.  If you were, you will be able to
  understand REAL  3D`s  Boolean  functions  ever  so  much  easier.  Boolean
  operations  all  work  in the same way but have very different results. Two
  objects are needed for any Boolean, the target object and the tool. Imagine
  drilling  a  hole (tool) into a table top (target). The drill could be, for
  example, a cylinder and the table a cube. To cut the cylinder  out  of  the
  cube you would do the following:

         * In the top view window create a cube.
         * In the front or side view use stretch to change the
           height of the cube so it represents a typical table top.
         * In the front or side view position the curser so it is
           just below the table.
         * In the top view create a cylinder, this will be the hole.
         * With the cylinder selected, choose Modify/Boolean/AND NOT
           from the menus.
         * The select window will now ask for an object so select
           the cube and click on OK at the bottom of the select window.

  The  Boolean AND NOT is now complete. now delete the cylinder (by selecting
  it and using the "D" key) - if you render the cube you will see that it now
  has  a  hole where the cylinder was. You may also notice that the colour of
  the cube has changed in the select window. This shows that it is a  Boolean
  operation.

  The  next form of Boolean operation is AND. While AND NOT allows you to cut
  objects AND will combine objects so that only the overlapping parts of  the
  two are visible. One example would be a dice which in effect is a cube with
  rounded corners:

         * Using the grid create a perfectly square cube.
         * Create a sphere centered in the middle of the cube but
           make the radius slightly less than that of the cube.
         * With the cube selected choose Modify/Boolean/AND from
           the menus, or using the icon.
         * Select the sphere and complete the operation.

  Again the colour of the object in the select window will change to show the
  object is a Boolean. Render the scene to see the final effect. Remember  to
  delete  the  "tool" object after the operation, otherwise it will appear in
  the rendered scene too - You should always put your tools away.  To  create
  the  circles  on  the  dice, you could use a spherical primitive to AND NOT
  away holes on the cubes surface. This could also save you a lot of  effort,
  because  if  you make the sphere tool white, and use the AND NOT with paint
  operator, you will save yourself the bother of having to paint the dots on.
  These are both very simple examples of boolean operations but the principal
  is the same for more complex objects.

  CONSTRUCTING COMPLEX OBJECTS

  Unfortunately the space in this book doesn`t allow for a complete  tutorial
  of building a complex scene so instead here are some tips and guidelines to
  help you with the creation process.

  Use the hierarchy - remember to use a  logical  structure  of  levels  when
  creating  objects.  This  is  especially  TRUE  if the scene is going to be
  animated.

  Break the object you are constructing into smaller pieces. The smaller  the
  sections,  the  easier it will be to build. Most objects can be constructed
  with fewer objects when Boolean operations are used well. Here are a couple
  of good examples:

  *  Use  the lathe tool to create the profile of the guitar and then Boolean
  AND it with a cube that surrounds the entire profile but  is  thinner.  The
  result will be an object with a flat front and back but with bevelled edges
  for the guitar shape.

  * Boolean AND a cutcone and polyhedron to create the tip of a  screwdriver.
  The polyhedron is wider than the cutcone but not as tall so the final shape
  is a flat surface that rounds off at the edges.

  Try to build as  much  of  the  object  as  possible  before  applying  any
  materials.  This  means  you  won`t  need  to re-apply the materials if the
  object has to be modified or even rebuilt.

  When you haven`t a clue where to start, try thinking of how the  object  is
  constructed  in  real  life.  You  already  have  a  lathe, and the Boolean
  operations are your milling machine - You should  be  able  to  build  just
  about anything.

                                      (35)

                                    WIREFRAME

  The  wireframe  screen gives interactive control over the camera through an
  easy to use interface. The main gadgets are:

  AIMP - X,Y,Z coords of the aimpoint, where the camera is looking.

  POS - X,Y,Z coords of where the camera is currently located.

  POSITION GADGET

  The largest box with a button in the centre, to the  right  of  the  camera
  coordinates  can  be  used  to  move the camera interactively. Clicking and
  holding the mouse on the button in the middle allows the view to be rotated
  in realtime. The view is always rotated around the aimpoint.

  DISTANCE  -  Defines  the  distance  between  the aimpoint and observer and
  adjusts the perspective.

  SCREEN - Allows the size of the image to be scaled.

  AR - Automatic recording. If active all changes made  to  the  aimpoint  or
  observer  are  recorded. Each time a new change is made the frame number is
  increased. This makes creating a manually sequenced animation a  whole  lot
  easier, not to mention faster.

  >> and << - Animation controls for stepping through frames.

  REC - Saves the current settings to the aimpoint and observer. If you don`t
  press this button, all the changes you make are lost  when  you  leave  the
  wireframe environment.

  SAVE  -  Allows  the wireframe screen to be saved as IFF images. To do this
  define a suitable name in the solid screen but add a _w  postfix.  Activate
  the save button and click on play.

  RBOX  -  Turns  on  bounding boxes for all objects in order to speed up the
  screen refresh rate.

  CLEAR - Resets the aimpoint and observer coords to the default settings.

  PLAY - Starts animation playback in a continuous  loop.  To  stop  playback
  click the play button again.

  FRAME - Shows the current frame number.

  EDITOR/SOLID - Moves to the editor or solid screens.

                                      (39)

                                  SOLID SCREEN

  This  screen  controls  all  of  the settings used for rendering images and
  animations. The controls are as follows:

  FRAME

  You can move to any frame in the animation using the frame field.

  NAME

  Use this field to define the path and filename to be  used  when  rendering
  images  - just click in this field and change it to any path you desire. If
  no path is set the images will be saved in the current directory.

  BOX OFF

  If a render box has been previously defined this button will delete it.

  BASELIGHT

   Defines the colour and brightness of the ambient  light  for  the  rendered
  image. The more baselight the less contrast in the final image.

  BACKGROUND

  Defines R,G,B values for the background colour of the scene. The background
  is rendered wherever an object is not present.  The  background  colour  is
  also used as the default reflection for all objects whose material has some
  brilliancy and where no other object is reflected.

  BRIGHTNESS

  Sets the global brightness for all  light  sources.  Use  this  slider  for
  control over how bright a scene will be rendered.

  OVERLIGHT

  Controls how bright the highlights on objects will be. If over light=0 then
  an object will never get brighter than it`s actual  colour.  by  increasing
  the  overlight  shiny  surfaces can be simulated without the high rendering
  times of reflective materials.

  ANTI-ALIASING

  Defines how well the scene will be anti-aliased. This function smoothes out
  jagged  edges in the picture, the higher the setting the smoother the scene
  and the longer it will take to render the scene.

  RESOLUTION

  The default of 1*1 means uses  normal  screen  resolution.  Increasing  the
  value  means larger and larger pixels are used, upto 8*8. The image quality
  is reduced but render times are halved with each  increase  in  pixel  size
  which makes this a usefull tool for rendering quick previews of a scene.

  WIDTH AND HEIGHT

  Defines  the  output  image  size  in pixels. You can set these to whatever
  values you desire. Even really large images, (larger than any screen  size)
  can be used, as long as you have enough memory and disk space.

  RECURSION DEPTH

  Defines how many times a ray of light can bounce off surfaces in the scene.
  This field only has an effect when transparent and reflective  objects  are
  present.  The higher the setting the more rendering time will be increased.
  It is worth using values 5 or 6 if you have a number of transparent objects
  in a scene.

  FAST MODE

  This  is  the  fastest  rendering mode available, no materials are used and
  only a single light source is used. The light source is  always  placed  at
  the observer regardless of light sources in the scene.

  NORMAL MODE

  This   is   the  highest  quality  rendering  mode.  Shadows,  Reflections,
  Refraction, and all light sources are used. If you have not created a  lamp
  in your scene, don`t render with this mode - all you`ll get is black.

  SHADOWLESS MODE

  This  is  the  same  as  normal mode except no shadows are calculated which
  speeds up the rendering process considerably.

  LAMPLESS MODE

  This is sinilar to fast mode but materials and reflections are  considered,
  again only a single light source is used.

  OUTLINE MODE

  This  renders  the  scene using a 2 colour outline of all the objects. This
  mode is good for producing wireframe preview animations  as  the  2  colour
  images require very little memory and render fairly quickly.

  SINGLE

  When  working on an animation this tells REAL 3D to only render the current
  frame not the entire animation.

  AUTOLIGHT

  When set REAL 3D will use automatic  scaling  of  each  light  source.  The
  scaling  is  calculated to maintain a correct level of light falling on the
  origin.

  INTERLACE, OVERSCAN, GREYSCALE

  These buttons each  define  the  type  of  screen  mode  to  be  used  when
  rendering.

  DITHER

  Turns dithering on which improves the image quality by mixing the available
  colours to give the impression of greater colour  bandwidth.  The  type  of
  dithering can be defined in the dither menu.

  HLSHADE

  Tells  REAL  3D  to  only  use pure colours when rendering. By default this
  option is off and REAL 3D will use proportional scaling of the colours.  HL
  shade  will  add contrast to the scene and will help reduce fringing in HAM
  modes.

  SAVEMEM

  This tells REAL 3D to leave at least 150K of chip  memory  free  but  could
  slow down rendering.

  TARGA / IFF

  These  buttons  define what kind of image format to use when rendering to a
  file, both output a 24bit image  in  fast  mode.  Also,  when  using  these
  options  you  will not get a screen display showing the rendering progress.
  Instead a percentage complete figure  will  be  displayed  just  above  the
  render button.

  FRAME COMMAND

  Allows  a  shell command to be executed after each frame of an animation is
  rendered. This is usefull for  single-frame  recording  devices  and  other
  similar hardware.

  ASPECT RATIO

  Defines  the  aspect  ratio  used when rendering the image. The most common
  ratios are.........

                                   640x256 = 2
                                   640x512 = 1
                                   320x512 = 0.5
                                   640x480 = 1.0667
                                   640x400 = 1.28
                                   800x600 = 1.0667

  RENDER

  Starts  the  rendering process. If you are rendering a 24bit image to disk,
  an indicator will show, in terms of percentage, how complete the image  is,
  note  that some parts of the image may be quicker to render than others, so
  if the indicator says 10% completed after one minute, it  does  not  follow
  that it will be finished completely in 10 minutes.

  EDITOR AND WIRE

  Exits  the  solid  screen  and  returns  to  either the Editor or Wireframe
  screens.

  ANIMATION

  REAL 3D has several different ways of animating objects  but  possibly  the
  easiest  to  use  is  the orbit function. Orbits allow you to define a path
  that the object will follow over a specified number of frames. To  see  how
  easy the Orbit function is try the following.

  * Create a simple object such as a sphere.
  * With the object selected choose Project>Animation> orbit from the menu.
  * Next draw a path in one of the view windows for the object to follow.
  * To complete the path click the right mouse button.
  * A requester will appear asking for the start and end frames numbers for
    the orbit. Enter 0 and 50 and click on OK.

  REAL  3D  will  now  calculate  a  smooth  orbit  for the object. Go to the
  wireframe screen and click on the play button. You  will  see  a  wireframe
  preview of the object following it`s path.

  A  more  flexible  method  of applying orbits is to use a pre-defined path.
  This means the path can be drawn and edited in all 3 view windows before it
  is used as an orbit. To use the path for the orbit do the following.

                   * Select the target object.
                   * Use the menu Project>Animation>Orbit
                   * Press the * key on the numeric keypad.
                   * REAL 3D now asks for the orbit line to
                     be selected so find it in the select
                     window and click on the OK button at
                     the bottom.

  REAL 3D will then use the pre-defined curve for defining the orbit. This is
  probably the quickest way to animate an object in REAL 3D but of course the
  more complex methods allow greater control over the animation.

  DIRECTION

  Having  given  an orbit to an object the Direction tool can be used to make
  the object rotate as it follows the path. In order to do this make sure the
  object is rotated correctly to follow the orbit before applying the initial
  orbit. REAL 3D doesn`t know which way an object should point and so it will
  always assume the object is orientated correctly when the direction tool is
  applied.

  ROTATION

  Applying A rotation to an object works in a similar way to the  orbit  tool
  except instead of a path REAL 3D requires a mouse click in a view window to
  define the centre of rotation. A window will then  appear  asking  for  the
  start/end  frames  and  angle of rotation. An angle of 360 will produce one
  revolution and 720 will produce two.

  Note that rotation should be applied before  an  orbit  or  the  centre  of
  rotation will be incorrectly placed on all frames except the first.

  MORPHING

  REAL 3D is capable of using it`s keyframe animation features to effectively
  "morph"  an  object,  or  in  other  words,  to  seamlessly  transform  one
  representation  of  an  object in to an altered representation. Lets have a
  look at this. By default REAL 3D animations have only  one  frame,  to  add
  more  frames the menu Project>Animation>Size is used. REAL 3D will then ask
  for a new size and add the frames to the end of  the  animation.  Once  the
  animation  has more than one frame we can start to define keyframes for the
  object being morphed. To do this we need to  first  expose  the  object  in
  frame  one.  Exposing an object tells REAL 3D that the current frame should
  be a keyframe for the object. To expose  an  object  for  any  given  frame
  simply  select  the  object  and  current frame number and click on the (X)
  button on the title bar. Now lets animate the sphere using morphing.

  EXPOSE THE SPHERE ON FRAME ONE

  Move to frame 24 using the forward button "<" to the right  of  the  expose
  button.  Expose  the sphere in frame 24 and then move it to a new position.
  You can use any of the modification  tools  to  strtch,  rotate,  etc,  the
  sphere.  Go  to  the last frame of the animation, frame 49 and again expose
  the object. Again modify the object to define the final keyframe.

  To perform the morph use the menu Project>Animation>Morphing.  A  requester
  will  ask  for  the  start  and  end  frames  for  the  morph and curvature
  parameter. For this example use 0,  49,  and  5.  The  curvature  parameter
  defines  how  the  object  moves  between keyframes, The default value of 5
  produces smooth motion, a value of 0 will give linear movement  with  rapid
  changes  in  direction  and  speed.  Large  values  such  as  15  will give
  exaggerated movement and may even produce extra  loops  between  keyframes.
  Later  on try this example again with different curvature values to see the
  different effects.

  The morph is now complete, when REAL 3D calculated the morph it  looked  at
  each  frame  the  morph  was  to  happen over and used any frame the target
  object was exposed in as a keyframe. In the example we used 3 keyframes  at
  0, 24, and 49 so REAL 3D will morph 0 to 24 to 49.

  Now  that  morphing and keyframing will only work with objects that are the
  same. You cannot morph a sphere to a cube but could morph a  sphere  to  an
  ellipsoid.  Meshes offer more flexibility for morphing as each point on the
  mesh can be edited for the morph.

  DE-EXPOSING

  After performing a morph, orbit, etc, the target object will be exposed  on
  every  frame  the animation tool was asked to use. If you aren`t happy with
  the results there are two ways to change the animation.

  The first is to simply go to the frames to be changed and edit the  object.
  As the object is already exposed the changes are instant.

  The second technique is to re-animate the object using the animation tools.
  Before you can do this you need to de-expose  all  frames  for  the  object
  except  the  keyframes.  To do this use the menu Project>Animation>DeExpose
  and REAL 3D will ask the number of frames to be  de-exposed.  The  function
  starts  from  the  current  frame  so  be sure you are at the correct frame
  before using it.

  APPENDIX 2 - SUPPORT SOFTWARE

  DISPLAY

  When  REAL  3D saves an image the default tool is set to this image viewing
  program so when you double click on the icon for the picture  Display  will
  be run to show the image. Display can show 24bit Targa images by converting
  them to HAM.

  DELTCONVERT

  This program will build a REAL 3D DELTA animation  from  a  series  of  IFF
  images. To do this run the program and supply the following information:

  Type of compression, Small Delta, or Fast Delta or Anim5.
  Filename to save the animation as.
  First image filename (minus the frame index).
  Starting frame index.
  Final frame index.

  Deltaconvert will now process each image in turn and compile the animation.
  When completed you can choose to add another sequence of images or click on
  all done to complete the conversion.

  DELTAPLAY

  This program will play animations created by Deltaconvert.

  All  animations  created  in  Deltaconvert  will  have Deltaplay set as the
  default tool in their icons. To  stop  the  playback  of  an  animation  in
  Deltaplay press "q" followed by return.

  SCULPT TO REAL

  Converts  Sculpt  3D  data  files  into  REAL  3D format. It is possible to
  convert the  Sculpt  file  into  a  point-editable  primative  or  seperate
  triangles, the latter requiring much memory.

  APPENDIX 3 - GLOSSARY

  AIMPOINT

  The  position  in  the  3D  world of the software towards which the virtual
  camera is pointing.

  ANTI-ALIASING

  A shading technique which removes the hard edges on objects, by  graduating
