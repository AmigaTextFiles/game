 Italics           Indicates words or characters you enter. For
                   example, "MyAccounts in the File text gadget ".
                   They are also used  to indicate program or drawer
                   names. For example, "use the Install Money Matters
                   program, which is in your Money/MattersInstall
                   disk."

 Shortcut keys     Right Amiga-S, for example, is a combination

1.5 Terminology used in this book

 * Account refers to your own sources of money. For example, a bank
   account, a credit or charge card, a store card, an investment or
   building society account.

 * Budget refers to the amount you estimate you will be spending. For
   example, a budget for a summer holiday.

 * Manual transaction refers to a money transaction which occurs
   once. For example, writing a cheque to buy some food, buying a
   radio using a credit card.

 * Notepad refers to the facility in Money Matters to save a few
   lines of text. For example, you can set up a Notepad for your bank
   account - this may contain the bank's address and the name of the
   local manager.

 Page 6

 * Reconciled refers to any money transaction which you know has been
   processed. For example, if you paid for something by credit card,
   the transaction is considered Reconciled when the money has been
   transferred out of your account. (Normally you would only know
   this when you receive your statement and the transaction appears
   on it). By differentiating between Reconciled and Unreconciled
   transactions, Money Matters can provide you with both up-to-date
   account balances, and actual balances to match the statements you
   receive. Compare Unreconciled.

 * Regular transaction refers to a money transaction which occurs
   regularly. For example, a standing order to pay off a loan, a
   monthly mortgage payment.

 * Type refers to the groups into which you allocate your income and
   expenditure. For example, you probably want to analyse your
   spending over different headings, such as Food, Petrol
   Housekeeping.

 * Unreconciled refers to any money transaction for which you have
   not received confirmation that it has been processed. For example,
   you may have written a cheque for something, but it has not yet
   gone through to your bank account. Compare Reconciled.

 4. Preparing To Use Money Matters
-----------------------------------

 4.1 What you should already know


 To set up Money Matters on your Amiga, you need an understanding of
basic Amiga concepts. Before you begin, you should know how to:

 * Use icons on Workbench desktop.

 * Use the mouse to point, drag, click and double-click.

 * Start and quit from applications using Workbench.

 * Initialize (format) and copy disks using the Shell or Workbench.

 * Open, copy and delete icons from Workbench.

 * Pull down menus and choose menu commands.

 * Use requesters and requester gadgets (more information is
   contained in the Money Matters on-line help).

 If you are not familiar with any of these terms or processes,
see your Amiga owner's guide.

 4.2 Making Backups


 You have been provided with one master disk. It`s important to work with a copy of your Money/MattersInstall disk rather than the original. If a copy is damaged or lost, you can go back to the
original and make another copy.

 step 1

 Before copying the master disk, slide up the small tab (if it exists) in the upper-left corner on the back of the disk so that it is in the uppermost position (the tab will no longer be visible from the front side of the disk). This locks information on the disk, preventing accidental deletion of files.

 step 2

 Switch on your Amiga and insert the disk titled WORKBENCH. Double-click the WORKBENCH disk icon, double-clicking the SYSTEM DRAWER, and then double-click the SHELL icon.

 Enter SYS:SYSTEM/DISKCOPY FROM DF0: TO DF0: and press the Return key (be sure to enter zero, not the letter O).

 step 3

 Now place the original master disk in the internal disk drive and when prompted, press the Return key. Follow the on-screen instructions. Then put the original disk away in a safe place.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT If you make backups from Workbench be sure to rename the backup disks removing copy_of_ and make sure there are no hidden spaces contained in the disk titles.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

 Page 9

 4.3 Floppy Disk Installation

 You need to install Money Matters once before you can use it. Once Money Matters has been successfully installed, you do not need to repeat the process.

 You need to have the following items before you can begin:

 * A backup copy of your Money/MattersInstall master disk (to make a
   backup copy, follow the procedures outlined in Chapter 4.2,
   "Making Backups").

 * Two blank floppy disks onto which Money Matters will be installed.

 Throughout this procedure you will be prompted to change disks as necessary (for example, "Insert Volume Money Matters in any drive").

 step 1

 Switch on your Amiga and insert the disk titled Money/MattersInstall.

 step 2

 When the Workbench desktop appears, double-click the Money/MattersInstall disk icon and then double-click the Install Money Matters icon.

 step 3

 You will be asked to specify your knowledge of the Amiga:

 OPTION            DOES

 Novice            A basic installation is automatically performed.
                   From time to time the installer may ask you to
                   insert other disks.

 Intermediate      A basic installation is automatically performed.
 and Expert        You will be asked to make certain choices that
                   will affect the installation.

 Click Proceed to start the installation and follow the on-screen instructions.

 step 4

 When prompted, select the radio button titled "On Floppy Disks" and then click the Proceed button to start the installation process. Installing onto floppy disk may take some time as the installer needs to create two disks for you to use.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT If you get a message to insert a disk which is already in the drive, then the disk is incorrectly titled and needs renaming.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

 A message will appear to confirm that the installation has  been successfully completed. Now reset your Amiga with the disk titled Money Matters in the internal disk drive and see Chapter 5, "Starting Money Matters".

 Page 10

4.4 Hard Disk Installation

You need to install Money Matters once before you can use it. Once Money Matters has been successfully installed, you do not need to repeat the process.

 You will need a minimum 2MB of free space to install Money Matters on your hard disk.

 step 1

 Switch on your computer (without a disk in the internal disk drive) and wait for Workbench screen to appear as normal.

 step 2

 When Workbench appears, insert the disk titled Money/MattersInstall. Double-click the disk icon and then double-click the icon titled INSTALL MONEY MATTERS.

 step 3

 You will be asked to specify your knowledge of the Amiga:

 OPTION            DOES

 Novice            A basic installation is automatically performed.

 Intermediate      A basic installation is automatically performed.
                   Occasionally, you may be asked to make certain
                   choices that will affect the installation (like
                   where on your hard disk you would like to install
                   the program).

 Expert            You will  be asked to make certain choices that
                   will affect the installation (like where on your
                   hard disk you would like to install the program).


 Click Proceed to start the installation and follow the on-screen instructions.

 step 4

 When prompted, select the radio button titled "On A Hard Disk" and then click the Proceed button to start the installation.

 step 5

 You will also need about 25K disk space in your System partition for Money Matters` fonts and other files.

 Novice users only - the installer will install Money Matters onto your hard disk. At the end of the installation, you will be told where Money Matters drawer containing the Money Matters program is situated. (On most hard disks, this will be the partition titled Work. However, if a partition of this name does not exist, the installer will make an informed guess.)

 Page 11

 A message will appear to confirm that the installation has been
successfully completed. Now reset your Amiga with the disk titled Money Matters in the internal disk drive and see Chapter 5, "Starting Money Matters".

 Intermediate or Expert users - the installer will ask you to select the destination for Money Matters (where you wish the Money Matters drawer, containing the Money Matters program and files, to be located on your hard disk). Insert the appropriate disk a s requested.

A message will appear to confirm that the installation has been
successfully completed. Now reset your Amiga with the disk titled Money Matters in the internal disk drive and see Chapter 5, "Starting Money Matters".

 Page 12

---------------------------
 5. Starting Money Matters
---------------------------

 5.1 Floppy Disk Users

 Insert the disk titled Money Matters into the internal disk drive and switch on or reset your Amiga.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
 IMPORTANT Be sure to use the Money Matters disk, not your Amiga Workbench disk.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

 To start Money Matters, double-click the Money Matters disk icon and then double-click the Money Matters program icon.

 Now go to section 5.3, "Personalising Money Matters".

 5.2 Hard Disk Users

 Double-click the Money Matters program icon located in the Money Matters drawer on your hard disk.

 5.3 Personalising Money Matters

 The first time you start Money Matters, you will be prompted to type:

  * Your name.

  * The name of your organisation. (If this is not applicable, enter
    your name again.)

  * Your license number (this appears at the back of this book, next
    to the registration card).

  * Click OK.

 Once you have personalised the program, your name and details will appear in the "About Digita Money Matters" requester (About command, Project menu), confirming that you are a registered licensed user. If you do not personalize Money Matters correctly, you will be returned to the Amiga Workbench.

 5.4 Setting The System Date And Time

 When you start Money Matters, a requester appears prompting you to enter the current date and time. If you have an Amiga with built-in clock, you just need to click OK as the date and time should be correct. If not, you should enter the correct date and time before clicking OK.

 If you have a built-in clock and wish to prevent the "Set Date and Time" requester appearing every time you start Money Matters, deselect the "Set Date and Time on Startup" checkbox on the "General Settings" requester (" Change Settings" - General, Settings menu), and then choose "Save Settings" (Settings menu).

 7. Tutorial
-------------

Follow this tutorial closely and do not try to modify the
application until you finish. This tutorial purposely illustrates a
wide variety of the features of Money Matters.

 This is what should be on screen

 *** See Figure 7-1 Money Matters opening screen ***

 If you cannot get this screen, refer to Chapters 1 and 2.

 7.1 What's on The screen

 The requester requests the current date and time. The text box titled "Current date" should be highlighted; if it isn't, click inside it with the Left Mouse key.


 step 1

 For the tutorial to work correctly you should set the date to 1st April, 1995. To do this enter 01041995. As you enter the first number notice that the mouse pointer disappears and the text box changes to / / and indicates you are now in edit mode.

 When editing, note these keyboard shortcuts:

 KEY                     DOES

 Left Arrow              Move cursor left
 Right Arrow              ""    ""   right
 Shift-Tab               Move to Previous text box
 Tab key                 Move to next text box
 Shift-Left Arrow        Move to start of text box
 Shift-Right Arrow       Move to end of text box
 Right Amiga-X           Clear text box
 Right Amiga-Q           Restore text box settings

 Page 18

 Backspace               Delete character to the left
 Delete                  Delete current character
 Enter                   Select default button
 Esc                     Cancels requester

 If you wish to edit an entry simply click in the appropriate gadget.

 step 2

 Now press the Tab key, this completes the entry for the "Current
date" and moves the cursor into the "Current time" Enter the current time in any format you wish (for example, 20.15 or 8.15AM) and press the Return key.

 Click OK with the Left Mouse key, the requester disappears leaving the blank desktop and menu bar. However, the requester will not disappear if you typed an invalid date or time.

 7.2 Creating a new file

 Press the Right mouse key and move the pointer onto the menu bar and
choose New from the Project menu.

 The file requester looks like this:

 *** See Figure 7-2 `File selector` requester ***

 This is used whenever you create a new file, or open or save existing files.

 Click the Drawer text box, delete its contents and type MYDATA: (type this exactly as it is written, with no spaces and ending with a colon), and press the Return key.

 Page 19

 When prompted insert the disk titled MYDATA. If the system continues to ask for volume MYDATA then this indicates the disk has not been renamed correctly. Rename the disk and try again.

 Click the File text box and type MYFILE and press the Return key.


 The message shown on the screen is an alert box and is used to ask simple questions or give warnings where only a button click response is necessary (requesters are used where more information, such as a date, is required).

 This message provides the option to load an existing configuration from another Money Matters file (you would normally use this to load a configuration from a previous year's file).

 *** See Figure 7-3 Money Matters desktop ***

 These are the standard icons which appear on the desktop:

 Printer, Help, Calculator, Types, Markers, Regular, Budget, Investment and Trashcan.


 7.3 Setting Up Accounts

 step 1

 From the EDIT menu choose Accounts to show the list of accounts, as there are none yet click Add to display the "Accounts Details" requester. This requester is used to set up bank accounts, credit card accounts and so on.

 Page 20

 *** See Figure 7-4 `Account Details` requester ***

 step 2

 Enter Natwest Current Account into the Name text gadget and press the Tab key. Type 77777 in the Number text gadget and press the Tab.

 If you wish to edit an entry simply click in the appropriate gadget and change its contents.

 step 3

 The gadget titled Code allows you to enter a 2 character reference code that is used in other areas of the Money Matters, such as budgeting or standing orders. Enter NC (Natwest Current) and press Tab.

 step 4

 The Type may be changed by clicking the arrow to display a pop-up menu containing a list of previously created Types. This is currently set to Cash. The Account you have set up is a cheque Account therefore click the pop-up, and with the Left Mouse Key held down, move the selection bar down the list until Cheque is selected and then release the Left Mouse Key.

 step 6

 Click the "Opening balance" gadget, enter 425.98  and press the Tab key.

 In the  "Warning Limits" group, Min allows a minimum Account balance to be set, if the balance drops below this amount, you will be warned. Type -500 and press the Tab.

 Max allows a maximum Account balance to be set, if the balance exceeds this amount, a warning will be given. Enter 1500 and press the Tab. The minimum and maximum warning limits are currently inactive, so switch them on by clicking in the check boxes to the right. A tick indicates that the warning is active.

 step 7

 The Title gadget in the Icon group lets you set the title for the desktop icon, enter NATWEST and click the "Show Icon" gadget.

 Now click the "Create Another" button, this adds the Account to your file and clears the requester for you to create another.

 step 8

 Now type another Account with the following information:

 Name  : Halifax savings
 Number: 111111
 Code  : HS
 Opening Balance: 2500
 Warning Limit Min: 500
 Warning Limit Max: 0
 Type: Savings
 Icon Title: HALIFAX
 Cheque Number: 0
 Set the "Warning Limits" Min check box (a tick appears).
 Icon - Title: Halifax
 Click the "Show Icon" gadget and click "Create Another".

 Now create another Account:

 Page 22

 Name: Access card
 Number: 5224 2222 3333 4444
 Code: AC
 Type: Credit Card
 Opening Balance: 0
 "Warning Limits" -Min: -500
 "Warning limits" -Max: 0
 Set the "Warning limits" Min check box (a tick appears).
 Icon Title: ACCESS CARD
 Click the "Show Icon" gadget.

 step 9

 Click the Notes button to display the Notepad requester.

 Notepad lets you type up to 8 lines of additional information. Enter the following:

  APPLIED FOR INCREASED CREDIT LIMIT press the Tab key
  TO 750, LETTER SENT 24/03/1993 press the Tab key

 Notepad is a good example of one requester overlaying another.
Sometimes, you may wish to move the requester to view information in
another requester behind. You do this by clicking the mouse in the centre of the bar at the top of the requester (in this case titled Notepad). Keep the Left Mouse key depressed and move the mouse pointer. When the  mouse key is released, the requester will reappear in the new position.

 Click OK  to exit the Notepad. Then, from the "Accounts Details" requester, click OK to close it.

 The desktop should now contain three additional Accounts icons:
Natwest, Halifax and Access Card.


 7.4 Setting up Income and Expenditure Types.

 step 1

 From the View menu choose the "Transaction types" command.

 A Type (called TRAN) already exists. This is used to transfer amounts between Accounts and you will learn later on. Before creating transactions, you need to set up income and expenditure Types.

 Types consist of four character abbreviations and a description, and are used to describe different categories of income and expenditure when adding transactions.

 step 2

 To add a Type, choose "Add Item"  from the Edit menu. Enter SAL and press the Tab key. In the Description text gadget enter SALARY and press the RETURN key. Click "Create Another".

 Page 23

 Now add the following Types and Descriptions in the same way.

 TYPE            DESCRIPTION

 HK              House keeping
 CL              Clothes
 PTRL            Petrol
 MISC            Miscellaneous
 TAX             Local tax
 CARI            Car insurance
 CARE            Car expenses
 CARL            Car loan
 ENT             Entertainment
 CASH            Cash withdraw;
 HOBB            Hobbies and interests
 HOLI            Holidays
 CDS             Compact discs
 COMP            (leave blank)
 BCHG            Bank charges
 INT             Interest
 GIFT            Gifts

 Click OK. The types should now appear, alphabetically in the window.

 *** See Figure 7-5 Types window ***

 You should see that there is no Description for COMP. To add the Description, click COMP (to highlight it), then choose "Edit Item" from the Edit menu. COMP is displayed in a requester ready for editing. (A quicker way to edit an item is to double-click the Type in the window.)

 Page 24

 Press the Tab key to move down to the Description text gadget and type COMPUTER ACCESSORIES. Press the Return key and click OK.

 step 3

 Types are automatically displayed in alphabetical order. Choose Sort command from the Tools menu.

 The Header cycle buttons let you set the heading to sort on. The radio buttons set the order, either ascending or descending.

 Click Cancel, and close the Types window by clicking the window closer in the top left corner of the window.


 7.5 Setting up Regular Transactions

 step 1

 Choose "Regular transactions" from the "View" menu.

 Regular transactions are transactions that occur on a regular basis, for example, a standing order, direct debit, loan repayment, mortgage repayment.

 To add a regular transaction choose "Add Item" from the Edit menu.

 *** See Figure 7-6 `Regular Transactions Details` requester ***

 step 2

 Imagine you have a monthly standing order for a car loan, starting on 5th March, 1995 for 12 months, for an amount of £51.37, which is debited monthly from the Account Natwest.

 Page 25

To set this up, enter the following:

 Start date: 05/03/1995
 End date:   05/03/1996
 Type: CARL  (This is the Type you set up earlier)
 Reconciled: set this checkbox on (This option will be explained
             later)
 Frequency - Every:  1 (This is the number of times the transaction
             occurs, in months, weeks or days, depending on the
             setting of the adjacent pop-up gadget). Set the adjacent
             pop-up gadget to Month.


 step 3

 The "From Account" and "To Account" text gadgets  should contain the code for the Account the transaction is being debited From or credited To. When you set up the Account "Natwest current" you used the "Account code" NC. Since this loan
is debited from "Natwest current", use the From gadget.

 From:      NC (Leave the To gadget blank)
 Reference: Car loan for Mini

 step 4

 The Debit and Credit boxes are used to enter the amount to be debited or credited, in this instance the Account is being debited, so use the Debit gadget.

 Debit: 51.37

 The Marker box is like a bookmark and lets you set your own lookup
point. Leave the Marker gadget blank and click "Create Another".

 Set up the following regular transaction. It represents your salary, which is paid every two weeks into your "Natwest current" Account by direct transfer.

 Start Date: 01/03/1995
 End Date: 01/03/2000
 Credit: 312.91
 Description: Salary
 Type: SAL
 To: NC
 Frequency - Every: 2 (Set the frequency pop-up gadget to Week.)
 Reconciled: set this on

 Now click "Create Another". Now set up this standing order which transfers £60.00 to "Halifax savings" from "Natwest current" on 15th day of each month. It starts on 15th March, 1995 and lasts for two years.

 Page 26

 step 6

 Start Date: 15/03/1995
 End Date;   15/02/1997
 Debit: 60.00
 Type:       TRAN
 From:       NC
 To:         HS
 Frequency:  1
 Leave the frequency pop-up to the default, Month.
 Reconciled: set to on
 Click "Create Another".

 The Type titled TRAN is used exclusively for transferring funds between Money Matters. When using TRAN, you need to tell Money Matters which Account you are posting from, and which Account you are posting to.

 Money Matters only recognises the first three characters, that is TRA. The fourth character is discretional. This gives you the opportunity if you wish to analyse several Types of TRAN transactions (for example, TRA1, TRA2). If you leave the Description gadget blank, Money Matters automatically enters the details of the transaction.

Click Cancel. The "Regular Transactions" window will now be updated with the new transactions:

 Close the window by clicking on the window close gadget.

 Like Types, there is a desktop icon, titled Regular which you can
double-click to re-open the window.

 7.6 Saving Information

 When you created this file, you named it Myfile. As you enter
information into Money Matters, the information will remain in the
computer's memory. Therefore, it is wise to regularly save this
information onto your data disk. Remember to do this at regular intervals (about every 30 minutes is ideal).

 Choose "Save" from the Project menu.

 Money Matters has an auto-save facility, whereby you set the time
interval between automatic saving.

 7.7 Budgets

 step 1

 With Money Matters you can set up budgets for each Type. Choose the Budget command from the View menu.

 Page 27

 step 2

 Choose "Add Item" from the Edit menu. To set up a budget of £60.00 a month for petrol, paid by Access credit card, type the following:

 Type: PTRL (This is the Type you set up earlier)
 Account Code: AC (this is the "Access card" Account you set up
          earlier)

 *** See Figure 7-7 `Budget Item Details` requester ***

 For each of the months, type 60.00.

 The radio button allows you to budget either income or expenditure
Types. Leave this set to Expenditure.

 Click "Create Another". Now set up another budget of £30.00 a month for clothes:

 step 3


 Type: CL
 Account Code: NC

 Rather than entering the same figure for each month, you can just enter one figure and then let Money Matters copy it into every month for you. To do this, click the "Calculate Budget" button. This will display a requester from which you can get Money Matters to automatically fill in the other text gadgets.

 Click the "Start Month" pop-up and select January from the list, then click the "End Month" pop-up and select December.

 Enter 30.00 in the "Start Value" gadget, set the radio buttons to "Add Value to Start" and click OK. The amount 30.00 should now appear in each month gadget.

 Set the radio buttons to the Expenditure, and click "Create Another".

 Page 28

Now you need to budget for personal cash withdrawals, say £80.00 a
month.

 step 4
------

 Click the small arrow on the Type gadget to display a pop-up list of the Types and their descriptions (you can also remind yourself of the "Account Codes" in the same way).

 From the list you can see that the Type you need is titled CASH.

 With the Left Mouse Key still held down, select CASH from the list and then release the Mouse Key.

  Account Code:  ** (This lets you budget over multiple Accounts).

 Enter 80.00 in the first month and press the Return key. Click "Calculate Budget" and as before, enter 80.00 in the "Add Value to Start" radio button and click OK. Set the radio buttons to Expenditure, and click "Create Another".

 Now enter the following budgets, setting the radio button to Expenditure. Click "Create Another" after each budget.

Type Code Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec

HK   NC   50  50  50  50  50  50  50  50  50  50  50  50

ENT  NC   20  20  20  20  20  20  20  20  20  20  20  20

 Click OK. The budget window will reappear with all the new budget
figures.

 If you have made any mistakes, double-click the appropriate budget to make any corrections.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT  Double-check that the figures you have entered correspond exactly to the figures shown
---------------------------------------------------------------------

 Close the budget window. As before, there is a desktop icon representing Budget.

 7.8 The Calculator

 On the Tools menu you will notice the Calculator command. On the right side of the command appears the keyboard shortcut, L. This means that you can choose Calculator without using the mouse by holding down the Right Amiga key and pressing L. Many of the menu commands may be chosen this way.

 Page 29

 step 1

 Choose Calculator from the Tools menu, or press Right AMIGA-L.

 *** See Figure 7-8 The Calculator ***

 step 2

 Click the buttons 1 2 3 * 7 + 100 =

 The text gadget is the calculator display. Click the text gadget and try entering 56*24-17 and then press the Enter key on the numeric keypad (press * instead of X for multiplying values ).

 Click C to clear the display. Now click AC to clear the history window.

 Page 30

 7.9 The Interest Calculator

 With the Calculator still displayed, click the Interest button. button.

 *** See Figure 7-9 The Interest Calculator ***

 This is a simple loan calculator and provides estimates of loan costs. Because credit card companies, finance companies and banks use a multitude of ways to calculate interest, such as daily interest, monthly, compound and so on, it may not be precisely accurate.

 "Opening balance" is for entering the starting balance for the
transaction, Periods is the time period measurement (either years, months or weeks), "Interest rate %" is the interest rate % per period and the Payment is the payment per period.

 For example, if you had a credit card balance of -600 (that is you owe £600), and you can afford to pay off the debt at £40 a month. The
interest rate is 1.76% a month. You want to estimate the outstanding
balance after five months.

 Opening balance: -600.00
 Periods:           5
 Interest rate %: 1.7600
 Payment        : 40.00

 Now click Calc, the calculated balance will be -443.88. This represents the outstanding balance after five months. Click Exit and then Quit to return to the desktop.

 Page 31

 7.10 Entering Transactions

 step 1

 Double-click the icon titled Natwest Bank.

 The entries are postings of the "Regular transactions" you set up
earlier. The transactions have been automatically back- dated to 1st
March, 1995. Notice the opening balance is displayed in the window title.

 step 2

 Choose "Add Item" from the Edit menu.

 This requester is used to enter the day-to-day transactions which go
through your bank Account. In this example, the transaction relates to a pair of trousers costing £24.87 that you purchased using your Natwest Current Account. When adding transactions, remember to enter the date of the transaction, as opposed to the current or system date.


 *** See Figure 7-10 `Manual Transactions Details` requester ***

 step 3

 Enter the following:

 Date:       11/03/1995
 Type:       CL
 Reconciled: Leave this gadget unselected.

 The Reconciled box tells Money Matters whether or not a transaction has been reconciled with a bank statement. It may be used in a number of different ways which will be covered later in this tutorial.

 Page 32

 Description: New jeans

 The Reference gadget is used if the transaction was paid by cheque. You can enter this manually, or press F8 to automatically insert the next consecutive number.

 Reference: Press F8.

 This will insert the cheque number you set up earlier when you created the Account "Natwest current" (765534).

 Debit: 24.87

 Leave the Credit gadget empty (you use the Debit gadget to pay out money, or the Credit box to pay in).

 Leave the Marker gadget empty (this is for setting your own reference marker).

 step 4

 Click "Create Another", and then enter these transactions:

 Date        Reference Debit  Credit  Description   Type Marker

 03/03/1995            20.00          Cash Machine  CASH
 05/03/1995  765535    23.67          New Battery   CARE
 06/03/1995  765536    12.94          John Birthday GIFT
 08/03/1995  765537    50.00          Housekeeping  HK
 12/03/1995  765538    10.99          Compact Discs CDS
 13/03/1995            20.00          Cash Machine  CASH
 15/03/1995  765539    22.91          Fishing Rod   HOBB
 18/03/1995            20.00          Cash Machine  CASH
 27/03/1995            20.00          Cash Machine  CASH

 Click OK. The new transactions appear in the window.

 *** See Figure 7-11 `Natwest Current Account` window

 Page 33

 step 5

 Amending a transaction is simple. First, click the transaction with the description "Fishing rod" to highlight it and then either choose "Edit Item" (Edit menu). Alternatively, double-click the transaction.

 From the requester select the Debit box, and change the amount to 26.91. Click OK.

 step 6

 Choose "Add Item" (Edit menu) and enter this transaction:

 Date:        20/03/1995
 Reference:
 Debit:       8.95
 Credit:
 Description: Great Expectations
 Type:        BOOK
 Marker:
 Reconciled:

 Click OK. A warning requester appears to tell you that the Type Book has not been set up and would you like to insert it. Click Insert and create the new Type from the "Type Details".

 step 7

 Notice that the Type name BOOK has been entered for you, so click the Description text gadget, and enter Literature books and then click OK.

 You will now be able to click OK from the "Manual Transaction Details" requester without any warning messages appearing.

 step 8

 Imagine this scenario...

 You visit a store and purchase some motor oil and a bottle of wine (a birthday gift). You pay by cheque.

 You have purchased two items with one payment, therefore the transaction needs to be split over two Types, namely CARE (Car Expenses) and GIFT (Gifts).

 Money Matters has a special Type called SPLT, which allows you to do
this. Using this example, choose "Add Item" (Edit menu) to display the "Manual Transaction Details" requester again, and enter:

 Date: 21/03/1995
 Type: SPLT (or click Split button).

 Page 34

 *** See Figure 7-12 `Split Manual Transaction Details` requester ***

 You can spread one transaction over a maximum of 20 Types.

 Enter the following into the requester:

 Type    Description   Amount

 CARE    Oil           7.95
 GIFT    Wine          6.25

 The "Total Amount" should be 14.20. Leave the Debit radio button
selected. Click OK. 14.20 has been inserted into the Debit text gadget on "Manual Transaction Details".

 Leave the Reconciled checkbox unselected.

 Description:  Hamilton Store
 Ref number:   765540 (Press F8.)

 Click Add, and then close the window.

 Double-click the Access icon and add these transactions:

 Date      Reference Debit Credit Description Type Marker Reconciled

03/03/1995           12.96        Petrol      PTRL        *
11/03/1995           14.77        Petrol      PTRL        *
17/03/1995            8.93        Petrol      PTRL        *
24/03/1995           17.41        Petrol      PTRL        *

 Click OK. The transactions appear in the "Access card" window. They
are displayed in red, this indicates that the balance for this Account is below zero.

 Click the window horizontal scroll bar and move the mouse to the right to display the right side of the window. Notice the balance is negative, with a total balance of -54.07

 Page 35

 Scroll the window to the left back to its original position and add this transaction:

 Date      Reference Debit Credit Description Type Marker Reconciled

27/03/1993                 500.00 Insurance   CARI        *

 Click OK. When you originally set up the "Access account" you set the "Minimum balance" to 500, therefore the alert tells you the Account has dropped below that balance.

 Now delete the previous transaction. To do this click the transaction (to highlight it) and then choose "Erase Item"  from the Edit menu. You will be asked to confirm the deletion, click Erase.


 7.11 Setting Transaction Window Display Headers.

 With Money Matters you can customise the display to your preference.

 step 1

 To remove the Reference column choose "Window headers" from the "Change Settings" sub-menu (Settings menu).

 The check boxes allow you to switch the headers (and their contents) on or off.

 step 2

 Switch the headers Reference and Marker off by clicking the check boxes (the ticks should disappear). Click OK and the window reappears in the new style.

 You can customise every "Manual Transaction" window if you wish and Money Matters will automatically remember the header settings for each Account (the information contained in each heading will be retained, although it is not displayed.

 Choose Sort from the Tools menu. Like Types, you can set the box with which you wish to sort, and the sort order. This is the same for Types, Markers, "Regular Transactions", Budget, Investments and "VAT codes". Click Cancel.

 Previously, when you set up the Access Account, you used the Notepad
facility. The Notepad is also available for Types, Markers, "Regular
Transactions", Budget, Investments and "VAT codes".

 Click the first transaction and choose "Edit Item" from the Edit menu. With the "Manual Transaction Details" requester displayed, click the Notes button. The Notepad allows you to make notes for this transaction.

 Click Cancel, and then click Cancel again to close the requester.

 Close the window and choose the "Manual Transactions" command from the View menu, select "Natwest Current Account" from the list and click OK. As you can see, this operates the same way as double-clicking the desktop Natwest icon.

 Page 36

 7.12 Finding Transactions

 step 1

 From the Edit menu choose the "Find and Replace" command and click the "Find What" button.

 In the Description gadget enter CASH MACHINE and press the Return key. Set the Description checkbox to on (this tells Money Matters you wish to search only the Description part of your transactions). Click OK.

 Click Find and Money Matters
will search through all transactions in "Natwest Current Account" to find the first transaction with the word Cash Machine in its Description gadget.

 step 2

 The first transaction found is highlighted. To search for the
next transaction click Find again on the "Find and Replace" requester. Repeat this procedure until the screen flashes, indicating
there are no more entries.

 Choose the Find command and experiment with different search  combinations. This command is particularly useful, especially when you have been using Money Matters for several months and you wish to search through hundreds of transactions.

 7.13 Finding and Replacing Transactions

 step 1

 Choose "Find and Replace" from the Edit menu. C lick "Find What" to display a requester for you to enter your search criteria. Notice that Money Matters has remembered your last search criteria. Click OK.

 step 2

 Click "Replace With" to display a similar requester where you enter the information you want to replace.

 In the Description box enter Cashpoint machine and set the corresponding checkbox on.

 The three buttons to the right of the requester perform these
operations:

 BUTTON             DOES

 Find              Find next transaction.
 Replace           Replaces current transaction.
 Replace all       Replace all transactions.

 step 3

 Click Find and, when the first transaction has been selected, click  Replace. Money Matters now looks for the next occurrence, click "Replace All" to replace  the remaining transactions. the screen will flash to indicate that no more transactions can be found.

 Page 37

 7.14 Reconciling Transactions

 Notice that some of the transactions have not been included in the
running balance figure. This is because these transactions are not
reconciled, and therefore are not included in the total balance.
Unreconciled transactions appear without an asterisk (*) in the left
column.

 There are ways to customise reconciliation to suit your personal
preference and this is explained a little later in this tutorial.

 In principle, you should reconcile each transaction as it appears on
your bank or credit card statement. You then have a method of monitoring which transactions have cleared and those which are still outstanding. Therefore, you know the TRUE balance of your Account.

 To reconcile an individual transaction (when it appears on your
statement), highlight the transaction and then use the "Edit Item"  command (Edit menu), and select the Reconciled checkbox. A quicker method is to press and hold the Alt key and click the transaction you wish to reconcile.

 step 1

 Try this with the transaction FISHING ROD . Notice an asterisk (*)
appears to indicate the transaction is now reconciled and the balance is updated to reflect the value. Repeat the process, as this is a toggle command, the transaction will revert to being unreconciled.

 step 2

 Choose Reconcile from the Transactions menu.

 This command is used to search transactions between date ranges and then globally reconcile or unreconcile. You also have the option to confirm each transaction for reconciliation if you wish (particularly useful for bank statements).

 step 3

 Entering the following:

Start Date: 01/03/1995
End Date: 05/03/1995

 Ensure the Reconcile radio button is selected and the checkbox
"Confirm Each One" set on.

 Click OK and, as prompted, click Reconcile to confirm each reconciliation.

 You can also ask Money Matters to calculate which transactions should be
reconciled. Your own bank statements, will contain the following
information:

  * The date of first transaction ("Start date").

  * The date of last transaction ("End date").

  * The Account balance ("Target balance").

  * The number of transactions ("Number of transactions").

 Page 38

 step 4

 Choose "Auto balance" from the Transaction menu and enter:

Start Date: 01/03/1995
End Date: 15/03/1995
Target balance: 822.04
Number of Transactions: 10

 Click OK. Notice that some of the transactions are now reconciled. Money Matters has evaluated all of the transactions you entered, between the two dates, and established a combination of 10 transactions that total the "Target balance" figure.

 Occasionally, a reconciliation may be wrong, particularly if you have several transactions of the same amount. In this case, you use the "Auto balance again" command (Trans menu) and Money Matters will attempt to reconcile again, using a different combination (unless there are no more combinations possible).

 If the "Auto balance" fails, this is probably because you made a mistake when you inserted the  transactions.

 7.15 Setting Transaction Defaults

 step 1

Choose "Set Defaults" from the Transactions menu.

 *** See Figure 7-13 `Manual transactions default` requester ***

 Page 39

 With a program like Money Matters you spend much of your time entering transactions. To make this process as efficient as possible, Money Matters offers the ability to set defaults, which you can personalise to your requirements.

 With the Type, Reconciled, Amount and Marker gadgets you have three
options :

  * No default.

  * Your own Default.

  * Default to the entry of the previous transaction "Last Entered"

 For example, to set the default type to HK, enter HK in the text box and leave the adjacent pop-up set to Specific. To set the default
type to the previous entry, select the "Last Entered" from the pop-up gadget.

 The Date and Description gadgets have four options :

  * No default

  * Date: to "Current Date".

 7.16 Function Keys

STEP 1

From the Settings menu choose "Change Settings" - "Function keys".

 This is another time-saving facility. You can program up to 20 common words or phrases. Ten for the key combination Control-Function key and ten for Alt-Function key. You cannot program a direct Function keypress (for example, F3), as these contain keyboard short-cuts for Money matters.

 For example, the description "CASH MACHINE" may be used regularly, and you can program this word into a Function key so that whenever you wish to enter "CASH MACHINE" you just press the appropriate Function key combination.

 step 2

 Select F1 from the list gadget, then enter in the Control text gadget CASH MACHINE and in the Alt box enter HOUSE KEEPING.

 Control-F1 is now set to "CASH MACHINE" and Alt-F1 to "HOUSE KEEPING".

 To change the Function key (currently set to F1), click the Function key icon and overtype in the appropriate text box. Now click OK.

 7-20 Desktop Icons

 With Money Matters you have the option to display icons on the desktop for menu commands and Accounts.

 *** See Figure 7-14 Additional desktop icons ***

 Page 42

 The default icons are:

 Experiment by dragging a few of the icons around the screen, but take care not to drag icons over the Dustbin or Printer icons.

 Now choose "Clean Up Desktop" from the Tools menu. This command neatly rearranges the icons.

 7.21 Setting up Your Printer.
-----------------------------
 Before you can experiment with the reporting options, you need to set up your printer. Choose Printers from the "Change Settings" sub-menu (Settings menu).

 *** See Figure 7-15 `Printer Settings` requester ***

 Money Matters uses the printer preferences as you have set up in your Amiga System Preferences.

 Spooler size: This lets you set aside memory for background printing. By default, this is set to zero. If you have 1MB or more of
RAM, set this to about 20 (Kb). Background printing, as the name

you are using, 11" paper is 66 lines, 12" paper is 72 lines, A4 paper is 70 lines.

 Page 43

 Top Margin: Set this to the number of lines to feed at the top of each page before printing.

 Bottom Margin: Set this to the number of lines to skip over at the
bottom of each page.

 Right Margin: Set this to the width of your paper (characters), in 10 Pitch you would use 80, or 132 for a wide carriage printer.

 Left Margin: Set this to the number of characters space for the left
margin.

 Cut sheet: Pauses printing at the end of each page.

 Print quality: Select required print quality (draft or NLQ).

 Click OK.

 7.22 Reports

 step 1

 From the Reports menu choose Types.

 Whenever you choose a command from the Reports menu, you have the option to view the report on the screen, print it or save the report as a file on disk. You can also change the report layout by choosing the Reports command from the "Change Settings" sub-menu. With this tutorial, set the radio button to Screen or Printer click Print.

 step 2

 A list of the Types (for income and expenditure) you set up earlier will appear. Experiment with the Budget and "Regular Transactions" reports. The only reports not selectable (as they are dimmed) are Markers, "VAT codes", VAT. This is because you have not entered any information relating to these commands.

 step 3

 Choose "Account Summary" from the Reports menu. This reports lists the Accounts and provides two balances:

 "Reconciled balance": The current balance of the Account.

 "Unreconciled balance": The Account balance with all transactions
reconciled.

 Choose "Account Statement" from the Reports menu and select the graph style you want (list, line graph, or scatter graph).

 The two boxes "Start Date" and "End Date" let you set a date range to search within.

 step 5

 Click the Options button. You can define more criteria for your report. Include: Reconciled and Unreconciled transactions; Show Credits or Debits. You can also define specific Accounts, Types and Markers clicking the appropriate buttons. The Description lets you search for all or part of a description.

 Page 44

 Click the Types button. You can use this list box to select the Type on which you wish to search.

 Click on individual Types to select them (shown by a `+` sign to the left of the Type) or click "Select All". "Clear All" will deselect all Types previously selected. If the "All Types" checkbox is
selected, then all Types will be included in the search, regardless of the selection in the list box.

 The same selection principle applies to the Accounts and Markers (the Markers button should be ghosted since no Markers have been set up).

 Experiment with the various search options.

 step 7

 From the Reports menu choose "Income and Expenditure".

 The requester is similar to the "Account Statement". Experiment with the various options. You will find this particularly useful to calculate totals for income and expenditure.
