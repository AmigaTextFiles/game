      Well,here are some guessed Copy Protection codes for Metal Masters.I'm
sorry this is the best I can do,but the original docs were'nt made available
to me at the time of downloading this game,so here they are: (So Far....)



               (1) (H)  =  (2) (5)
              (10) (E)  =  (9) (1)
               (6) (I)  =  (2) (7)
               (2) (I)  = (13) (7)
               (5) (M)  =  (1) (11)
               (5) (E)  =  (1) (3)
              (12) (B)  = (11) (7)



      These are ones that I have doubts about,but if they're correct,they
might come up sometime in the game,so here are the 'iffy' codes:



               (4) (E)  = (15) (2)
               (3) (C)  = (14)(15)
               (5) (N)  =  (1)(12)




      Welp,that's all I have.If I get any requests for an updated version of
this list,I'll make a revised edition of this Metal Masters Documentation.
      Guessing is'nt really that hard at all! If the first # that comes up in
a sequence of numbers/letters is written down already,say for example the
number 12,and the........Well,heck! It's easier if I just show you,hehe!!

      O.K: The numbers and letters that are 'computer generated' and that
come up in the title bar area all have values assigned to them.These
values,in the form of numbers ONLY,were probably written down in this games'
instruction manual on certain pages,not unlike some other copy protection
set-ups,i.e.Sim City wich has symbols listed in sequence along the sides of
the pages of a seperate list supplied with the simulator in it's normal
puchased package.This game's copy protection set-up is Very similar to that
of Sim City's shape matching 'scheme'.
      Now,since we don't have the shapes depicted in the screen we are shown
when Metal Masters ends it first stage of battling,(The weapons,leg types,
body types,etc.)the only thing to go by are the numbers underneath the shape
pictures as refference to the code that we need in order for the game to
continue.This is how it works(Sometimes):

      Let's take a hypothetical situation like this.A code comes up in the
screen following the first battle activity.The code is (1) (H).Now,let's say
that,by accident,you guess the answer wich is (2) (5).The game continues,and
the copy protection screen with the shapes does'nt come up again unless the
machine is turned off.
      Now,let's say that you DO turn the power off,and start playing at
another time.(You will ALWAYS have to deal with the copy protection screen
when beginning a new playing session As far as I know,there is NO way to
avoid this.)A new 'computer generated' code comes up wich is (1) (E).
"Sometimes',the number 1 will always equal a 2,and you can accurately answer
the first and/or second number of the codes answer by having the prievious
correctly guessed answers' value,duplicated in your answer of the next
'computer generated' code that comes up.Let me show you:

            Prievious 'computer generated' code: (1) (H)
            Prievious 'user generated' correct guess: (2) (5)
            (Power-down)

            (New session starts)
            Current 'computer generated' code: (1) (E)
            Current 'user generated' (possible) correct guess: (2) (1)

      See how that was done??By having the value of (1) prieviously being
(2) in the first guess,that SAME value may be able to be used in the current
guess by way of the program-chosen answer code pre-determined by the program
itself before generating 'it's' code for you to answer.AND,by having the
value of H prieviously being 5,you just count backwards,or forwards,
(depending on what order the letters of the alphabet are in,and what value
the program has set each letter to in it's 'computer generated' code it
presents to you) to get the (possible) value of that letter.
      Thus,I decided: "(1) = (2) last time.I'll put 2 there again to try to
answer the first part of this current 'computer generated' code,AND (H) = (5)
last time.I'll just count Backwards '5 letters' (wich is equaled to 'E'),get
the number 1,and put it in as my attempt for the second part of 'my' answer
to the current 'computer generated' code."

      Yes,yes.I know.... I over-elaborated,hehe!! But I just don't want
anyone to get confused,or misunderstand EXACTLY what it is that you have to
do in order for your guesses/answers to work correctly in this situation
that this game and it's protection 'scheme' presents to every down-loader
that gets this game,and does'nt have the original docs to it.That's all!!


      Welp,I hope that you all understand what you have to do.I really tried
to make it as clear as possible! If you have ANY questions,or problems,feel
free to E-mail me about this information,and I'll help you in ANY way I can!
      Take Care All!! Later.............................................M&M.
