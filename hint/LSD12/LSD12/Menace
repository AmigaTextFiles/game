PLAYING INSTRUCTIONS
Select F1 for the normal game.  All collisions with the aliens and guardians
will reduce your ships shield.  Once your shield has gone and you are in a
collision your ship will be destroyed.  Remember you have only one chance.

Select F2 for the expert game.  Collisions with the scenery will reduce your
shield, although not as much as a collision with an alien.  If you have
outriders attached they are not affected by the scenery.

If you fail in your mission, you will be given the option to restart on the
level you were destroyed on.  You will however be without any of the weapons
systems you had collected and you will find this a very serious disadvantage.

Control the craft with either mouse or joystick.

The following keys may be pressed at any time during play.

ESC      -      Abort the game.
SPACE - Pause the game, press fire to start.
 M    - Toggle the music on/off.
 E    - Toggle the sound effects on/off.

HOW TO COLLECT NEW WEAPONS
Destroying a complete attack wave will produce a bonus icon on the screen.
The last alien of any wave that you destroy will turn into a bonus icon.
Every five times you shoot this it will change into a different bonus
feature.  Collect the bonus you want by flying over the icon whilst its
pictorial representation depicts the feature you require.

End.
