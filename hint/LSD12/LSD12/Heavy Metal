THE FAV
This Vehicle Is Controlled Entirely By Joystick And Is More Like
An Action Game, I Couldnt Find Any Keys That Did ANYTHING here!

THE ADAT
This Vehicle Cannot Move And Is Once Again Mostly Controlled By Joystick
There Is One Key Command Here:

           Space Bar - Fire Missle

Their Is An Indicator On The Target Which The Missle Has A Lock On!
