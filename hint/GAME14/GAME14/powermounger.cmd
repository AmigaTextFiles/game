1 - The four icons at the top left allows the player to click between
contour, political, landscape and people maps.

2 - Map on left side of screen currently selected... Your leader can be
clearly seen, with your men shown as white pixels. The white cross
indicates the area in view on the main screen, and can be moved all over
the map with simple mouse clicks, allowing you to keep an eye on enemy
movements. It's the sort of ability Napoleon would've given his right arm
for!

3 - Message window... Beneath the map and above the rotation icons on left.

4 - The compass. The arrow always points North, and clicking on the compass
points will move you in a direction relative to this.

5 - Click on these icons to rotate the landscape in either direction.
Located on the upper right, just above the compass.

6 - Icons directly to the right of the compass allows you to zoom in or out
on the main view.

7 - The Leader of the Pack! (Figure standing in the background.) The bars
above indicate various facets of your current status. When other Captains
are recruited, they queue up to the left and just behind the Leader, and
can be switched between by clicking on them.

8 - Your window on the world. The view can be manipulated in just about any
way possible, thanks to the flexibility of the polygons used to construct
it.

9 - These are the icons around the main window. These will be lettered
starting on the far left going down. These simple icons are the only
controls you'll need to get into Powermonger.

A - Save/load games.

B - Spy on your enemies.

C - Make alliances with other leaders.

D - Trade with or bribe villagers.

E - Query mode - click on any character on screen to learn pertinent
information about them.

    F-H relate to the next column over to the right starting at the top.

F - First three icons... The aggression levels. These are very important,
as your attitude affects just about every interaction with other characters
in the game.

G - Return troops to base.

H - Transfer men between Captains.

    I - O relate to the top horizontal row below the main window going from
left to right.

I - Drop food.

J - Pick up food.

K - Search for food.

L - Supply or stockpile food.

M - Demob troops, i.e. send them back into food production.

N - Conscript troops, i.e. call them in from the fields.

O - Equip men with weapons, if available.

    P - R relate to the very bottom row of icons.

P - Attack mode. When selected, simply click on the location you want
attacked.

Q - Invent mode.

R - Send Captain. Having selected this, move the mouse onto the map and
click on the required destination.


This is simply the command summary. More detailed docs are required to get
a better understanding of each command and the game.

A few greets to some cool people off the top of my head...

     Dark Knight, Merlin, Masterblaster, Robin Hood, The Stranger, and
     Kraken for bringing in Powermonger! And to all the other people who
     help support the DFW Amiga boards!!
