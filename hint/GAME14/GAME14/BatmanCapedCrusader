BATMAN INSTRUCTION GUIDE

                      A TROUBLESOME TWOSOME

The Penguin:  A Bird in the Hand.  Commissioner Gordon calls you with the
news that the Penguin is back.  He's set himself up as a respectable
umbrella merchant.  But the commissioner is sure the Penguin's factory is
just a cover for his plot to take over the world with an army of robot
penguins.  The only way to thwart the penguin's plot is to destroy his
master computer.

To get to the Penguin's master computer, you have to make your way to the
factory through streets and across rooftops crawling with the Penguin's
thugs.  Once you've discovered how to get into the factory, you can search
out the master computer and destroy it.  But don't think it will be easy. 
The Penguin has more than one surprise waiting for you.

The Joker:  A Fete Worse than Death.  You don't need Commissioner Gordon to
tell you about the Joker's latest feat of sleight of hand - he's kidnapped
Robin!  Your search leads you through the sewers of Gotham City to the
Fair, where the fun house isn't so much fun and a ride on the rollercoaster
could be your last.

                 or display status screen

STATUS SCREEN

The percentage at the top of the screen shows how much of the game you've
completed.

The small pictures on the status screen are called icons.  There are two
types of icons on the status screen:  object icons and action icons. 
Object icons are things you need at some point during the game.  Action
icons let you use objects, restart the game, and turn the music off and on.

Bat Cursor:  Use the joystick to move the Bat cursor to the icon you want
to choose.  Press the fire button to choose the icon.

Getting an Object:  As you play Batman, you will need to pick up items that
can be used later to solve a puzzle, open a door, give you more power, and
the like.  A few examples will make this easier to understand.

1)   In certain parts of the game, you may enter a completely
     dark room.  You need to look for light-producing items in
     the rest of the game, then use one of them in this room to
     be able to see what's there.  (And just to make things
     really sticky, not every light source works in every room).

2)   You will occasionally come across food items as you move
     throughout the game.  Use these carefully - it's a good idea
     not to eat too much too soon.  When you "use" a food item,
     you'll restore some of your power.

If you try to use an item in an area and nothing happens - you've got the
wrong item!

You will find objects as you move through the game screens.  (In the ST
version, you'll see the object itself; in the C63 version, you'll see a
locked chest).

To pick up an object:

Position Batman over it, then hold down the fire button and move the
joystick down.

In the ST version, when you've acquired an object, an icon appears on the
status screen to show you what you've acquired; in the C64 version, a
message appears on the screen to tell you what you've acquired.

Using an Object:  To use an object: (Closed hand icon)

Go to the status screen.

Move the Bat cursor over the icon of the object you want to use, then press
the fire button.  The square around the icon flashes.

Move the Bat cursor to the Use icon, and press the fire button.  When you
use the right object at the right time, the percentage at the top of the
screen increases to show you've solved part of the game.

Dropping an Object: (Open hand with fingers pointing down icon)  Dropping
an object leaves it where Batman is standing.  You can't use an object
you've dropped.  You can carry only a limited number of objects, so drop
objects you don't think you need anymore.

To drop an object:

Go to the status screen.

Move the Bat cursor over the icon of the object you want to drop, then
press the fire button.  The square around the icon flashes.

Move the Bat cursor to the Drop icon, and press the fire button.  The icon
of the object disappears from the status screen.  The object reappears on
the game screen.

Returning to the Game Screen: (pointing finger icon).  To return to the
game screen:

Move the Bat cursor over the Return icon, then press the fire button.  The
game screen reappears.

Turning the Music On or Off. (musical notes icon).  To turn the music on or
off:

Go to the status screen.

Move the Bat cursor over the Music icon, then press the fire button.  If
the music is on, it goes off; if it's off, it comes on.

Restarting the Game: (keyboard icon).  To start the game over at any time:

Go to the status screen.

Move the Bat cursor over the Restart icon, then press the fire button.  The
message appears that asks if you want to start the game over.

Type y if you want to start over; or type n if you want to go back to the
game where you left off.

Energy:  At the bottom of the screen, the graph (on the C64 version) or
Batman's face (on the Atari ST version) shows how much energy you have
left.  As you use energy, the bars on the graph get shorter or Batman's
face slowly turns into a skull.

To get more energy, eat food objects you picked up.

To eat:

Pick up food items (sweets, lemonade, and so on) throughout the game.

Go to the status screen.

Move the Bat cursor over the icon of the food object you want to eat, then
press the fire button.  The square around the icon flashes.

Move the Bat cursor to the Use icon, and press the fire button.  The bars
on the graph grow longer, or part of the skull that's showing changes back
to Batman's face.

                         HINTS AND TIPS

1)   Don't eat too much too soon.

2)   Some objects do more damage than good.

3)   You can carry only a limited number of objects at a time. 
     Drop objects you don't think you need anymore.

4)   Duck to avoid bullets.

5)   Continued punching of enemies can produce valuable food (ST
     version only).

THE PENGUIN:  A BIRD IN THE HAND

When you learn from Commissioner Gordon that the Penguin is plotting to
take over the world with an army of robot penguins, you rush to the
Batcave.  Before you leave, be sure to collect all the items you think you
can use.  When you reach the streets of Gotham City, keep an eye out for
other useful items.

Watch out for the thugs that roam the streets - they may shoot at you. 
Punch, kick, or hit them with your batarang for temporary defense.

THE JOKER:  A FETE WORSE THAN DEATH

To reach Robin, you first have to make your way through the sewers of
Gotham City - not a pleasant prospect.  Make sure you've collected the
items you think you'll need before you plunge in.  You'll come across many
bombs in the sewers.  You need to disarm them before you can leave the
sewers - but it will take you a while to come across the tool you need to
do the job, and you'll have to do a lot of backtracking to disarm all of
them.

When you find the bat ears, use them to amplify your hearing.
