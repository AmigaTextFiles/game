	This is a list of documentation needed from games that I know exist
as of January 1991. Obviously docs to newly released games in 1991
are also requested. Several games are preseeded by an * symbol. Those are 
games where the docs are definitely needed to play the game and are
important to this disk series. 
	Send docs, preferably on disk, although if you are lazy and you
wish to send a Xerox of the manual, it is acceptable. Send to:
