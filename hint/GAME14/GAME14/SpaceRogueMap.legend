Docs for using the Map of Space Rogue included in this documentation set.  The map was drawn with Deluxe Paint III in Med Res 2 color mode.  You should have no trouble printing this thing out.

The map shows you the section of a galaxy you will be operating in.  The main point on the map is your starting solar system of Karonus.  In each system, there is at least on Milar Gate that will let you get to another system.  These routes are marked by a line from one system to another on the map.
