the Amiga version. Ripped from the IBM scene by the Hellion and made Amiga

                              ABOUT FACES... 
                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
  The object of FACES is to assemble chin, mouth, nose, eyes and forehead 
segments of a face into a complete face that will then be removed from the 
playing screen. When a perfect face is completed (one that uses all five 
segments if the same personality), all "blocked" segments of the column the 
face was on will be removed down to the next "open" segment. If a mixed face 
(a complete face with segments of different personalities) is completed, the 
"blocked" segment directly below the completed face will be removed. When a 
face is completed, it will be transferred to the left hand side of the
screen. The game is over if a column of "blocked" segments reaches the top
of the playing screen. 
 
 
                       THE TERMINOLOGY IN FACES... 
                       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
  A SEGMENT refers to a portion of a face which is a block containing
either a "chin," "lips," "nose," "eyes" or "top." 
 
  A PERSONALITY refers to a specific face. For example, Joan of Arc is a 
personality. 
 
  A PERFECT FACE refers to a completed face that contains all five face
segments of only one personality. 
 
  A MIXED FACE refers to a completed face that contains segments of more
than one personality. 
 
  MOVEMENT refers to the horizontal and vertical manipulation of a pair of
face segments as they fall from the top of the game screen. 
 
  SWAPPING occurs when you transpose the position of the two face segments
on game screen. 
 
  FLIPPING occurs when you substitute the current face segments with a
different pair of face segments. The alternate pair will always be the same 
portion of the face (chin, nose, etc.) but it might be a segment of a 
different personality. 
 
 
                         LEVELS OF DIFFICULTY... 
                         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
  There are 10 difficulty levels in FACES, numbered 0-9. The higher the 
difficulty level, the faster the face segments will drop from the top of the 
screen. Also, the number of different personalities that can appear increases 
by one every two levels beginning with 4 on level 0 and increasing to 8 on 
level 9. The different personality categories are listed below: 
 
LEVEL     CATEGORY                              # OF PERSONALITIES 
0         Universal Faces                       4 
1         Modern World Figures                  4 
2         Faces from Art                        5 
3         Scientists                            5 
4         Musicians                             6 
5         Historical Americans                  6 
6         Literary Figures                      8 
7         Monsters                              7 
8         Historical Figures                    8 
9         American Holidays                     8 
 
 
                             ADVANCE MODE... 
                             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Advance mode gives the expert FACES player an added challenge. When advanced
mode is selected, the segments fall much faster than they do in regular play
mode. The benefit of playing in advanced mode is that your score for dropping
pieces and completing a face is greater then it would be in regular play mode.
Of course, the game is much harder... 
 
 
                                SCREENS... 
                                ~~~~~~~~~~ 
  CONFIGURATION SCREEN 
  The configuration screen allows you to set the options you would like to 
have for your FACES game. This screen will appear at the conclusion of every 
game to allow you to adjust your options before playing again. To move and 
select choices on this menu, use the arrow keys and enter. Following is a 
brief description of the options available to your from this screen: 
 
  LEVEL 
  This option allows you to change the level of play for you game. The range 
is from 0 (slowest speed and least number of personalities) to 9 (fastest 
speed and greatest number of personalities). 
 
  ADVANCED MODE 
  This toggles the advanced mode ON or OFF. 
 
  CONTROL 
  This toggles your controls to utilize either the KEYBOARD or the JOYSTICK. 
 
  PLAYERS 
  You can select the number of players(up to 10) using this option. If more 
then 1 player is selected, all players will be playing in tournament mode. 
If HEAD 2 HEAD is selected, two players can compete against each other 
through direct-connect or over a modem. 
 
  SHOW HIGH SCORES 
  This allows you to view the top ten scores on your FACES game. Press any 
key on the high score screen to exit. 
 
  RESET HIGH SCORES 
  This option will allow you to clear the top ten high scores. You will be 
prompted for confirmation of this action in case you selected it by mistake. 
 
  LOAD GRAPHICS 
  Use this selection to substitute faces in the game with faces that you have 
created on you own. 
 
  UNLOAD GRAPHICS 
  Use this selection to remove faces that you have inserted using the load 
graphics option. 
 
  QUIT 
  This quits the program by exiting to DOS. 
 
 
                              HOW TO PLAY... 
                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
  To complete a face, you must assemble the face segments in order; chin, lips, 
nose, eyes and then top. If you place any segment out of order (for example, 
placing a chin segment on a nose segment) that piece will become "blocked." 
To complete a perfect face, you need to assemble all five face pieces of only 
one personality. You can distinguish the different personalities from each 
other because each has its own separate background color or pattern. 
If you have a pair of segments straddling a column of pieces, you can move one 
piece from side to side without moving the other one. In addition, when one of 
the two pieces comes to rest on a column, you can move and flip the second one 
on its own. 
 
 
                     MANIPULATION THE GAME PIECES... 
                     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
  Pieces will fall from the top of the screen in pairs, and you can manipulate
the movement, flipping and swapping of these face segments either by the 
keyboard or a joystick. 
 
 
                                SCORING... 
                                ~~~~~~~~~~ 
  Points are accumulated in FACES through a number of different ways. 
 
  Each time a pair of pieces finishes its movement on either the bottom of the 
screen or on the top of one of the stacks of blocked pieces you gain points. 
Unlike TETRIS or WELLTRIS, you do not get any extra points for how far a 
piece drops. 
 
  Bonus points are achieved on completion of a face. You obtain more points 
for creating a perfect face then for a mixed face. When a face is completed, 
it is removed from the game screen. 
 
  The taller a completed face is, the more bonus points you gain. However, you
will always get more points for a perfect face than for a taller mixed face. 
 
  In addition, the higher the level you are playing, the more points you get 
for each piece and for completing a face. Playing in the faster advanced mode also 
increases your overall score. 
 
 
                      ADVANCING TO THE NEXT LEVEL... 
                      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
  After completing 10 total faces(any combination of perfect or mixed faces),
you will advance to the next difficulty level. You can also press the + key 
to increase your level. 
 
 
                           HOW THE GAME ENDS... 
                           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
  The game ends whenever you press the ESC key or when a column of blocked 
pieces reaches the top of the game screen. In tournament mode, a game can end 
after the set time limit has expired. Play will then pass on to the next 
player in the tournament. In head-to-head mode, the game ends when one player 
has a column of blocked pieces reach the top of the screen. After the game 
ends, press any key to go to the high score screen. 
 
 
                           HIGH SCORE SCREEN... 
                           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
  This screen show the top ten scores for your FACES game. If you have just 
completed a game where you score was greater than the existing tenth place 
score, you will be prompted to enter your name for the record books. Your 
name and score will be saved and then placed on the screen among the existing 
scores. Note: Some of the lines will be blank until ten games have been 
played. 
 
 
                            TOURNAMENT MODE... 
                            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
  Up to ten players can complete against each other in tournament mode. After 
selecting the number of players on the configuration screen, press ENTER to 
begin entering the participants' names and the time limit for each player's 
game. Use the arrow keys to increase and decrease the amount of time each 
player has during their turn. The default time limit is "OFF." If a time limit 
limit has been selected, the tournament timer will appear in the lower left 
hand corner of the playing screen throughout each player's game. 
 
  After pressing SPACEBAR to begin the tournament, the game will prompt Player
One to get ready to play. Pressing SPACEBAR again will start the game. 
 
  Each player will play exactly the same sequence of pieces as every other 
player, and the player with the highest score at the end of the tournament 
wins. 
 
  After everyone has finished playing their game, a tournament scoreboard 
appears listing all of the players and their respective scores. If one of 
the players has achieved a score high enough to be included on the top ten 
list, their name will be placed there as well. 
 
 
                              STRATEGIES... 
                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
  There are quite a few hints and tricks you can utilize in order to play 
better and achieve a high score. The following is a short list of basic ones 
you can employ in FACES. Not everything is covered; we can't let all of our 
secrets out of the bad... 
 
  Position your pieces before flipping them. Rather than frantically trying to 
flip, switch and move your pieces all at the same time, try to line up the 
pieces above stacks where you want them to eventually end up, then flip them. 
This tactic is somewhat useful in tournament mode as well, but in head-to-head 
mode you usually don't have the luxury of time. 
 
  Drop pieces as quickly as possible in tournament mode and head-to-head mode. 
In regular play mode, you have virtually unlimited time to maneuver and 
position your pieces, but in tournament mode and head-to-head mode you are 
racing against the clock. To coin the old adage, "He who hesitates is lost." 
Nothing could be more true when you have FACES opponents breathing down your 
neck. 
 
  Try to make perfect faces, especially in head-to-head mode. While it is 
always a good idea to create a perfect face, in head-to-head mode perfect 
faces are essential to winning. Creating a perfect face sends blocked pieces 
to your opponent which could be the difference in the game.
