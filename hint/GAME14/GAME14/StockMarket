     You may now select from  1  to  6 players and
type in their names. The  player  names can not be
any  longer  than  ten  letters.  After  the  last
player's name has  been  typed  in,   the computer
will then go to MARKET  OPEN   and  hold for a few
seconds before going to  the  first players chart.
Players will have their  own  colors for the chart
and player turns will  be   at  random, so even if
you were entered as the  first  player it does not
mean that you will be  first  each turn. There are
ten turns per game. The  object  of the game is to
buy and sell large amounts of shares and make more
money than your opponent(s).

                *** THE CHART ***

LAST - This is  the  price  per  share of the last
turn.
CURRENT - This  is  the  price  per  share  of the
present turn.      
CHANGE - This  section  tells  you  whether or not
your stock went up or  down.   At  the end of each
turn each one of the  stocks  go  through a random
change of ether up,  down,  or stay the same. Then
the results  of  the  ticker  tape  are  added  or
subtracted from that.
COST - This is what  you  had  paid  per share for
this particular stock.  If  you  purchase stock at
two or three different prices  your cost per share
will be averaged for you.
DIFFERENCE -  Whether  or  not  you  have made any
money on this stock.
SHARES  -  Each  company   has  1  million  shares
available for sale to the players. This section of
your board will show you how many shares you own.

     Remember   stocks    will    split   at   140
points(price)  or  better.  A  stock  split can be
anywhere from (2 for  1),(3  for  1), or (4 for 1)
but the  price  will  only  be  divided  by two no
matter how much it splits by.
     If a stock goes  bankrupt,  you lose all your
shares. If the stock  comes  back on the board you
will not receive any shares back.

     Below the chart  you  find  several  choices,
SELL, BUY, LOAN, ASSETS, GRAPH, END, TOP 15.

SELL - You may enter the sell mode in two ways:

 1.  You may press the 'S' key.  The computer will
then  ask  you  to  select  the  desired  stock by
placing the mouse  pointer  over the desired stock
and clicking a  mouse  button.   If  you  keep the
mouse button depressed, the computer will tell you
how many stocks of each company  you own, and when
you release the mouse  button  it  will select the
stock under which the mouse  pointer is located to
sell.

 2.  Depress the left  mouse  button, and move the
mouse pointer over the desired stock.  If you keep
the mouse 
button depressed the  computer  will  tell you how
many stocks of each company  you own, and when you
release the mouse button it  will select the stock
under which the mouse pointer is located to sell.

You must sell before you buy. 

BUY - You may enter the buy mode two ways:

 1.  You may press the 'B' key.  The computer will
then ask  you  to  select  the  desired  stock  by
placing the mouse  pointer  over the desired stock
and clicking a  mouse  button.   If  you  keep the
mouse button depressed the  computer will tell you
how many stocks of each company  you own, and when
you release the mouse  button  it  will select the
stock under which the mouse  pointer is located to
buy.

 2.  Depress the right mouse  button, and move the
mouse pointer over the desired stock.  If you keep
the mouse button depressed  the computer will tell
you how many stocks of  each  company you own, and
when you release the  mouse  button it will select
the stock under which the mouse pointer is located
to buy.

ASSETS - To enter the  assets  mode, press the 'A'
button.
 
LOAN - If you  would  like  to  go to the bank and
borrow some money, press  the  'L' button. Keep in
mind, you can only make  one  trip per turn to the
bank to borrow or pay back.

GRAPH - Press the  'G'  button  to  check out your
favorite stock's track record.

TOP 15 - Press the 'T' button to check out the top
15 score board.

END - Press the 'E' button to end your turn.

                  *** SELL *** 

    Remember, you must sell  any  shares  that you
would like to cash in before  you go to BUY or you
will have to wait until the next turn to do so.
     If you wish to sell all of the shares in that
one particular  stock,  all  you  do  is enter the
number 1 and press  return.  If  you would like to
only sell part of  your  shares  then  type in the
amount  and  press  'RETURN'.  Once  the  'RETURN'
button is pressed  you  will  then  return  to the
chart board.
     If the amount of  shares  that  you  sell are
greater than 250,000  -  you  could  influence the
market by dropping the  selling  price  as long as
the   selling    price    is   greater   than   10
points(dollars).

                   *** BUY ***

      The BUY mode will show  you  how many shares
are remaining in each  company,  how much cash you
have, the current price of the stock, and how many
shares your money  will  buy  up  to  the limit of
shares remaining in
the company.
     At any time you  may  press  the  '1' key and
then the 'RETURN' key to either  use all your cash
or buy all of  the  remaining  stock  if  you have
enough money to do so.  If  you like you may enter
only what you plan on 
spending and then press the 'RETURN' key.
     If you buy  250,000  shares  or  more and the
price per share is 4 or  higher  then you might be
able to bump  the  market  price  up,  so the next
player will have to pay  that  much more per share
and you will have made 
that much more on your shares already.
     After you have made your selection, press the
'RETURN' key, your  selection  will be entered and
you will automatically  be  returned to the chart.
Your buy  now  shows  on  the  chart  under  cost,
profit(if any), and 
shares(how many you purchased).
     If you purchased the  remaining  shares  that
were left in a  company,  when  you  return to the
chart you will notice under the price column there
is a pink fill under the price. This indicates all
of the stock in this company has been bought up.

                  *** ASSETS ***

     When you press the 'A' button  you will go to
a  board  that  will  automatically  analyse  your
present standing in  the  game.  You  will see how
much cash you  have,  your  stock  and its present
value, a total of both and  then the computer will
subtract your bank balance  with interest, showing
how well or bad you are  doing  in the game. Don't
let the  figures  discourage  you  because in this
game you can be several million in the hole and on
the next turn(with good  investments)  be  quite a
few million dollars to the good.
     To return to the chart,  press  the  'R' key,
'SPACE BAR', 'RETURN', or click the left and right
mouse button at the same time .

                   *** LOAN ***

     Press the 'L' key to go to the bank. When you
get to the bank you will have a choice to make. Do
you want to borrow some money?  Do you want to pay
back some or  all  of  your  outstanding  loan  or
simply return to the chart  after checking out the
present interest rates?  If  you decide to borrow,
press the 'B' button and  you  will enter the loan
office, where you will  be  welcomed.  Type in the
amount you wish  to  borrow  and  press  'RETURN'.
Remember if you  want  it  all  then  type '1' and
press 'RETURN'. You may  see  what  your borrowing
limit is by checking the upper right corner of the
bank.
     Once you borrow  any  amount  of  money, your
interest rate  becomes  the  same  as  the present
interest rate; all  previous  loans are considered
rewritten to the present interest rate.
     If you decide you would like to pay back some
money to the bank, then  press  the 'P' button and
you will be welcomed by  the  bank teller. Type in
how much you  would  like  to  pay  back and press
'RETURN' If you  would  like  to  pay back all the
cash that you have or  you  have more cash on hand
than you owe, but would like to pay off your loan,
press the '1' key and  then  the 'RETURN' key. The
computer will make the proper transaction for you.
     To leave the bank and  return  to  the chart,
just press the 'R' key, 'SPACE  BAR', or click the
left and right mouse button at the same time.
     Remember you are only allowed one trip to the
bank per turn. If you borrowed  money on this turn
and decided that you  didn't  want it, you may pay
it  back  immediately  as  long  as  you  had  not
returned to the chart.

     You can not go to the bank on the tenth turn.

                  *** GRAPH ***

     Pressing the 'G' key  will  bring  you to the
graph chart. This graph will  show how good or bad
a particular stock is  doing  throughout  the game
since the first turn.
     To flick through the different companies, use
the left mouse button to go  one way and the right
mouse button to go the other way. You may also use
the 'S' key but it  will  only  flick  through the
companies in one direction.
     The graph can be  useful  in  forecasting  an
investment  in  the   company  that  you  wish  to
purchase shares in, but like  always, there are no
guarantees.
     To return to the chart,  just  press  the 'R'
key, 'SPACE BAR',  or  click  the  left  and right
mouse button at the same time.

                   *** END ***

     When  you   have   finished   all   of   your
transactions and feel you  are all done, press the
'E' key. Once this key  is  pressed,  if there are
any  more   players   then   the  bell  will  ring
signifying the next  players  turn. If you are the
last (or only) player,  the  market will close and
this will end the round.

                   *** *** ***

     At the end of  each  round  the  market  will
close and then open  at  Wall  Street.  Each stock
will randomly go through a process of one of three
changes: it could go up in price, it could go down
in price, or it could have no change what so ever.
Also it could be a bull  market  or a bear market.
After each stock goes through its change, then you
will see the ticker tape go by. On the ticker tape
will be some type of event  showing something that
might influence the market  in that months period.
Any ups or downs on the  tape  will be added to or
subtracted from that particular stock after it has
already gone through its first change.
     Dividends  may  be  awarded   as  long  as  a
companies  stock  is  worth  more  than  10 points
(dollars). Dividends may be  awarded to as many as
one to three companies per turn.
     A bull market means that the  price per share
could go up or down  anywhere  from 8 to 38 points
(dollars) per share.
     A bear market means that the  price per share
could go up or down  anywhere  from 5 to 19 points
(dollars) per share.

     On turn 10 instead of leaving the ticker tape
and going to the  chart  you  will  instead  watch
another  ticker  tape  describing   how  well  the
computer thought  your  performance  was.  Keep in
mind that the computer  might  not  understand all
the time how hard  you  really  try  to get a good
score.  After  going  through   the  ratings,  the
computer will then  load  another  screen  and you
will then see who the winner was for sure.

     Press the 'RETURN' key and  the computer will
then place any player who might qualify on the top
15 score board.  Any player  who is entered on the
board  will  have  their  name  printed  in  white
letters  along  with   their  score  so  they  can
identify their proper place in this game.

                  *** HINTS ***

 1. If you are  first  player  make  sure that you
sell any  stock  that  you  might  have  more than
250,000 shares in. This could  mean that following
players could lose money when selling their shares
from that company.

 2. Playing low  cost  stock  could  be  risky but
could also pay off with big rewards. Remember, the
lower the cost per share  the  more shares you can
buy with the least amount of money.

 3. Try not to invest in more  than six companies,
if you invest in too many  you could find out that
you are not gaining or losing  too much each turn.
You will never become a  billionaire  if you don't
take some risk.

 4. Think big, in  terms  hundred  thousands,  not
hundreds.

     This is not  an  arcade  game  and  does  not
require a lot of  dexterity.  An average game will
last approximately  one  and  half  hours, but the
time really  depends  on  how  long  it  takes for
people to make their decisions.
     You will find that you will  spend many hours
playing this  game,  whether  by  yourself or with
other players.
