SYSTEM INFORMATION

Making a Backup

We recommend that you use a backup copy of the program and store the
original for safekeeping.

Loading Jigsaw!

Insert your Jigsaw! disk at the 'Workbench' prompt.  When the Workbench
screen appears, double-click on the 'Jigsaw!' icon to open the disk.  After
the drive light goes out, double-click on either the 'Jigsaw!' icon to load
the game or the 'Preferences' icon to set Jigsaw! for your printer.

Entering your Classified Counter-Code

Once you've booted your disk, you will be asked to type in an activation
counter-code from your Jigsaw! Activation Codebook.  You will be given the
following information: Codebook Page - 0 Horizontal Numeric Code - 00
Vertical Numeric Code - 00

First find the correct page, then look for the designated number across the
top of the chart.  Now locate the prescribed number along the left side of
the chart.  The box that falls where the two columns intersect is your
counter-code.  Type in this number and press RETURN.

If you have entered the correct number, Jigsaw! will begin.

If you need more information on the Workbench or Preferences refer to your
Amiga User's Manual.

USING JIGSAW!

Load "General"

Pull down the File menu, and select LOAD.  Use the scroll bars to see the
names of the graphics files on the disk.  Click on "General" to select it,
then click on the LOAD button.

Scramble "General"

Highlight START GAME and then choose ONE PLAYER from the Game menu to start
a one-player game.

Move a piece

Using the left button, click on any piece.  Notice that you now control the
piece you selected: it moves with the mouse.  Click anywhere else.  Note
that the piece you were controlling is now at the spot where you just
clicked, and the piece that was in that spot is now in the place of the
original piece you picked up.  This is the fundamental move of Jigsaw!  You
will hear an "audio hint" when you move a piece to the correct place.

If you are playing at the "Hard" or "Very Hard" difficulty level, click the
right button of the mouse while you are in control of a piece to rotate the
pieces that appear upside down or backwards.

                                5

Keep moving pieces

Select another piece, guess where it should go and move it.  If you need a
hint, select VIEW PUZZLE or SHOW MISTAKES from the Game menu.  These will
help you complete the picture.

Finish "General"

Keep moving pieces until you finish.  Fastest times are the top scores.

LEVEL

Difficulty

	Easy

	At this level the puzzle will simply be broken into the desired
	number of pieces.  All of the pieces will appear right side up. 
	When playing at this level, pushing the right button while holding
	a piece will have no effect.

	Hard

	At this level, the puzzle will be scrambles into the desired number
	of pieces, with some pieces rotated (upside down), some pieces
	flipped (turned horizontally) and some both rotated and flipped. 
	If a piece was rotated or flipped at the start of the game,
	pressing the right button while holding that piece will cause it to
	return to its correct placement.  The right button will have no
	effect if the piece was positioned correctly at the start of the
	game.

	Very Hard

	This level is the same as hard, except that if you press the right
	button while holding a piece, it will rotate and flip regardless of
	whether it started the game that way.

Pieces

	You may have the puzzle broken into 200, 160, 128, 80, 50, 40, 20
	or 8 pieces.  Remember, the more pieces you have, the smaller they
	are!

HINTS FOR BETTER SCORES

	Before You Start

	The timer doesn't start until you scramble the picture.  Try to
memorize as many key features of the picture as possible.

	The "Key" Piece

	It's a good idea to use a "key" piece to start your puzzle.  Look
for a prominent feature.  Find the corresponding puzzle piece and put it
in the right place first - using the audio hint or VIEW PUZZLE - then build
your puzzle from that piece. Like a building block, you'll find it easier
to start this way.  Look for a piece that's next to it and go from there.

	Resetting the Level

	Occasionally, you'll find the puzzle too difficult to do at the
current level.  Reset the level and difficulty by using the Level menu. 
Then select RESTART from the Game menu.

	Sound On

	Sometimes all you need is an idea of where a single piece should go.
 Turn the sound on to know when you've moved a piece to the correct place. 
Remember that using VIEW PUZZLE adds to your time!

	Percent Complete

	If you think you've finished a puzzle, but the timer keeps going -
look closer!  The percent display will tell you how close you are.  You may
need to use VIEW PUZZLE or SHOW MISTAKES.  Find pieces that may be subtly
different.  Swap pieces that look alike.  Remember - puzzles are tricky!
