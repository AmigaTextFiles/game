			INTO THE EAGLE'S NEST

			     INTRODUCTION

CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNIQUE

DATE: March 8, 1945	TIME: 12:43
ISSUED BY: Army Intelligence, 9th Division
MISSION: Destroy the Eagle's Nest

BRIEFING: Six key divisions are in your area - the main force is believed
to be quartered in the Nazi fortress codenamed Eagle's Nest. Command is
concerned that the increase in number of axis troops may represent
preparations for a new counter-offensive. Three allied saboteurs sent into
the Eagle's Nest have failed to report back. Intelligence indicates limited
success by the third man: The explosives were planted prior to his capture

ORDERS: Penetrate the Eagle's Nest. Rescue captives before they break.
Destroy Eagle's Nest using hidden explosive caches. In process, save as
many stolen art treasures from destruction as possible. Good luck.

			PLAYING THE GAME

	As the game begins, you have smuggled yourself into the Eagle's
Nest and are safe - for the moment - in a small storage room on the ground
floor. You are armed and have 99 rounds of ammunition - hardly enough to
make a dent in the Nazi hordes you hear in the hallway outside. You are in
good health, and luckily, the key to the steel door in front of you is in
easy reach. Your screen looks like the following:

	When you first enter the game, you will start with the first of
four missions inside the first castle. Missions one, two and three each
involve the rescue of one of the prisoners, and mission four is to blow up
the castle. You will enter a second castle with four new missions once you
successfully destroy the first castle.

	Now that you have entered the castle, your mission starts in
earnest. You need to explore the four floors of the castle in search of
either the mission man or (in the case of the demolition mission) the four
detonators needed to explode he hidden dynamite caches. In the process of
exploration, you will find various objects designed to help and hinder you.
They are:

Nazi Soldiers: Very unhealthy. They shoot you and do great damage. You must
shoot each twice to kill. Be careful, you won't know you've been shot
unless you watch the hits indicator. You can take 50 hits before you die.
When the limit is approached, you will start flashing. At 50, the game
ends. Hits can be cured with first aid and food.

Drunken officers: Harmless, but kill them anyway.

Keys: Needed to unlock steel doors.

Art Objects: Worth points, but not worth your life. There are paintings,
jewels, vases, and other things lying about the castle.

Chests: Closed or open. Open closed chests by shooting them. Be careful not
to shoot an open chest as it may contain fragile and valuable items. It may
also contain explosives (also fragile).

Elevator Pass: Needed to operate the elevators.

First Aid: Heals hits.

Cold food: Heals hits.

Ammo: Useful for killing Nazi soldiers. You can carry 99 rounds at a time.
Each box holds 7 rounds.

Steel Door (Grey): Locked and impenetrable without a key.

Wooden Door (Yellow): Can be shot open.

	To rescue your fellow soldiers, find them and bring them back to
the starting point. Be careful not to lose them though; their fatigue makes
them travel more slowly than you do. If they seem to be dazed and refuse to
move, you may even have to fire a warning in their direction.

	Each time you complete a sub-mission (i.e.:rescue a prisoner), you
will have the option of proceeding to the next sub-mission. When all three
men are freed, blow up the castle. If you survive this first mission, you
will be offered the chance to perform the same service in another castle of
greater difficulty.

				TIPS

1) Always fire from a covered position. Remember, you can't see incoming
fire, so you had better stay covered and watchful as much of the time as
you can.

2) Explore only as much of a level as you need to. Once you have found what
you need, move on.

3) Use the elevators only when you are certain you are done with the
current level. All open doors will be relocked while you are on the other
floor.

4) Don't waste: keys, bullets, your life.

5) Only shoot at a known target. It is awfully easy to hit a dynamite crate
by accident.

6) Have fun!
