                                CHARACTERS

 MAC, the hero (player)

He  enters the castle to save the PETERS and once the RED Peter is  secured 
he gets a POWER UP which transforms him into the invincible MACHOMAN.

 DOM, KAIROS's son

Rounding himself into a ball shape,  he rolls toward MAC and rises up at  a 
nearby position and tries to kick him.

HENCHMEN 2, Deburacho and Gaburacho Brothers

They attempt to capture MAC and upon making contact with him, they start to 
apply  a  lying down hold.   Shake them off by moving the  lever  sideways.  
Gaburacho  wears blue pants and Deburacho,  green ones.   Gaburacho is  the 
stronger of the two.

 ZOMBIE

Appears alone and is manipulated by BAJO.   ZOMBIES are the girls who  were 
taken  away  by the KAIROS long ago and a number of them will try  a  lying 
down hold on MAC.

 PETERS

Red  Peter  gives  you  a POWER UP to transform  you  into  the  invincible 
MACHOMAN.

in attaining the maximum speed.

in advance.

 BAJO, KAIROS' mother

Manipulates ZOMBIES in STAGE 3 and PARJO in STAGE 4.  She moves swiftly and 
fires flame shots from her cane.  The only way to down her is to anticipate 
where she will move, wait in ambush and hit her when she least expects it.

 HENCHMEN 1

A  lower  ranked henchman,  who when making contact with  MAC  absorbs  his 
energy.   You can easily punch him.   The one in the blue suit requires one 
punch and the other in the green suit requires two punches.

 PARJO, KAIROS' daughter

She  has a basketful of apples which she throws at MAC and goes  away  once 
pursued.  If you corner her, punch once and she'll fly away screaming.

 KIDAN, the castle's guardsman

Hiding  himself in the straw and boxes,  he attacks swiftly when MAC  comes 
close to him.

obstructing MAC.  He can be sent flying by a punch.

 ARMOR
