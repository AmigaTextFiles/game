Your instructions come from Nancy at Chase HQ as she sends a description of
the criminals vehicle to your on-board computer. You have limited time to
catch up to the villain,at which point you wlii be allotted a further time
bonus to force him off the road.To achieve this you must ram his car a
number of times - as shown on your status panel.If you run into any other
vehicles this will slow you down and make the capture more
difficult.However,you have a limited number of Turbo Boosts which will give
you extra acceleration for a very short period.Use these wisely !
When you have inflicted the necesarry number of collisions , the criminals
car will pull over to the side of the road,and you can arrest him.
There are five missions in all,each successively tougher than the
last,taking you over varied landscapes and through different towns.
Occasionly you will be presented with a fork in the road and an arrow will
imdicate the shortest route to take.A constant hazard is the presence of
other innocent ,but appalling drivers whom you must avoid,or pay the time
penalty.
The clock is ticking,crimes are being committed,your Porsche is tanked up
and the bad guys are getting away.
"LETS GO MR.DRIVER!"

                           * HINTS AND TIPS *

Only use your Turbo when ramming the target vehicle.
Slow down when the road splits and follow the correct turn off.
Take your time when"bashing" to increase your score.
Try to find the hidden bonuses.
You will score less for using the continue-play option.
