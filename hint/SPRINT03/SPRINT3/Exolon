[EXOLON]

The ST version is out and there is supposedly an AMIGA version planned.

You have nine lives to finish this game, you'll need them.

Make sure you pick up the supplies left for you throughout the game.
Sometimes they are a hint as to the direction to take.

There are five levels to this game.   The game consists of destroying all
the creatures that come at you and blowing up obstacles that get in your
way.  The action is furious and fast and flows over 125 screens.

The device that looks like a red telephone box will put an exoskeleton on
you that makes you impervious to all the crusher type traps.  Its draw back
is that it slows you down.

There are all sorts of creatures to go after, both animal looking and
otherwise.  Creatures that fly or swarm at you can be shot down or dodged
by ducking down.  

Your weapon consists of a "blaster" and a "grenade launcher".

The grenades are "intellegent" and will home in on the walls or
emplacements but are very low on range.

Beware of mines and the pop-up defense pods.

You cannot retrace your steps in this game and some mapping may be
necessary to assist you in not repeating past mistakes.

Most traps are not predictable, so you will have to experience it and learn
from it.

This is a large game and there is no ability to start from anywhere but the
beginning.

It was not well liked by the reviewers.
