		  * W A N T E D *   D O C S    L I S T (3/18/92)

     The game docs on this list are requested for the completeness of my Game
     Player's Docs Disk series. Obviously docs aren't needed to play many of
     the simple shoot-em-up or hack & slash style games. Other games, however
     those marked with an * are definitely needed to play properly and are
     important to this disk set. Often a game appears simple, but there is
     often things that you don't know about in the game. Sometimes an object
     collected has a hidden use and requires knowing there is a hidden key
     stroke required to use. Sometimes you just need to know your objective.
     
     The disk set is getting wide distribution, but NOBODY IS CONTRIBUTING. 
     Some of my friends in the Los Angeles area who collect everything and 
     occasionally find obscure European docs disks have helped considerably.
     Some are dilligent in pulling docs from various BBS, but most people
     claim it is a waste of time because I have docs to nearly everything.
     Yes it is true that my set has docs to probably 85% of all Amiga games,
     but I PUBLISH THIS LIST BECAUSE THESE ARE THE MISSING 15% and I find
     less than 50% of the docs to the newest games within three weeks of
     release. I know some of the users have bought the games on this list or
     know someone who has. Some readers even obtain docs compilations from
     Europe. If you have the files on a disk, send it, otherwise Xerox the 
     manual and send it to:

        ************* Total = 293 missing game docs ********

	NOTE: LSD set from England has been helpful but I'm missing 
              the following disks from set: #1, #2, #3, #4,  
              #29 and up. Don't confuse this with the LSD 
              set from California that is over 200 disks long. While
              that set is helpful, much of it is repetition and 
              public domain text files from Fred Fish disks, etc.
