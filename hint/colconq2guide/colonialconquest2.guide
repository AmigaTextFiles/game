  This is a wonderful game written by Christian Mumenthaler using the AMOS 
  programming language. This FREEWARE guide is an UNOFFICIAL guide for Colonial 
      Conquest 2 v1.1 intended to supplement the instructions document 
                      which is included with the game.

                      Playing Against An Alien Opponent

The aliens never seem to attack your planets until very late in the game, after
they have colonized a lot of the uncolonized planets in the universe. I can not
guarantee that the aliens will attack late in the game but it is very likely
that they will leave you alone until at least turn 150. As soon as possible
build an @{"exploration ship" link "exploration ship" 0} and send it with a couple of other @{"combat ships" link "combat spaceships" 0} 
(for protection) to the surrounding planets, this serves two purposes - to 
look for @{"planets to colonize" link "colonizable planets" 0} and to look for alien life-forms. 
When you find alien life-forms and the empire offer you fleet forces or 
resources. (a transporter partially filled  with food, material and energy) 
I would recommend that you always take the fleet forces because spaceships are 
usually much more useful than a transporter partially filled with food, material 
and electricity, also the empire can send the spaceships to any planet instantly 
which cuts down the time spent exploring the universe for good colonizable 
planets. 
The details of fleet forces and resources obtained at different IQ levels can be 
seen below:-

IQ Rating Of Life Form  Fleet Forces                 Resources
                                          Food       Material       Energy
     1                  Fighter            15           0             15
     2                  Dreadnought        30           60            30
     3                  Cobra Ship         45           180           45
     4                  Pulsar Destroyer   60           240           60
     5                  Battlestar         75           360           75

When the aliens attack your planets in overwhelming numbers and you do not have
a realistic hope of recapturing it, it is most important to destroy the 
@{"energy storage units" link "energy storage" 0} so that when you come to destroy the planet with your 
@{"planet destroyer" link "planet destroyer"0} and the aliens have built a @{"planet shield" link "planet shield" 0} you can destroy 
the planet since you need twice as much energy as is contained in the planets 
energy storage units (if you have demolished the energy storage units that 
should be 20 energy units). 
When you no longer have a use for the colony station on your colonized planets 
it is a good idea to demolish them - this gives you 11 units of material and 
1 more place to build things and the you still have the space for 4000 people 
that you had before you demolished it. The aliens tend to build more objects 
on their planets, the higher the difficulty level. On the easy level they 
tend to build 4 objects - typically an alien central unit, a 
@{"nuclear power plant" link "nuclear power plant" 0}, a @{"ground defence unit" 
link "ground defence" 0} and a @{"space port" link "space port" 0}. 
On the suicide level the maximum I have seen the aliens build, given time is 10 
objects - an alien central unit, 2 nuclear power plants, 2 planet defence units, 
a space port, 2 energy storage units, a planet shield and an 
@{"anti spy satellite antenna." link "anti spy satellite antenna" 0} This gives the aliens a maximum of 620 units of 
energy and the alien central unit produces 24 units of material per turn 
regardless of which difficulty level you are playing on.
Do not leave your spaceships in orbit around planets colonized by the aliens as 
they will build tripods(alien troops) endlessly until you leave which can cause 
problems later on if you decide to invade the planet with troops.

@node "colonizable planets" "Colonizable Planets"
                            Colonizable Planets
It is difficult to say how many planets should be colonized to their full
capacity as it largely depends on how quickly you defeat the aliens and the
difficulty level you are  playing at. However I would suggest as a rough
guide:-
                  
            Level                      No. Of Planets To Colonize 
            Easy                                1-2        
            Medium                               3                      
            Hard                                 4
            Suicide                             5-6

The best planets to colonize are planets with the highest food and mineral
wealth (petrol and metals) though mineral wealth is more important since
@{"greenhouses" link "greenhouse" 0} can be built to provide food but mining sites cannot be built.
There are two main ways to defeat the aliens - one is to invade their planets
with spaceships and troops (Very difficult and time consuming), two is to keep
building spaceships, and research until you reach @{"Tech. level" link "technology levels" 0} 9 and then build 
a planet destroyer and destroy all the planets that the aliens have colonized 
and then wipe out the aliens with your large fleet (Much,much less difficult and
much,much less time consuming). It is best to choose which of these methods you
are going to use near to the start of the game (needless to say I would
recommend the second method). If you choose the first method you will need to
build @{"barracks" link "barracks" 0} - one or two per planet should be enough and troop transporters.
If you intend invading the alien planets with troops, you will need 
approximately three or four times as many troops as there are tripods defending.
If you choose the second method you will need to build lots of 
@{"fusion power plants" link "fusion power plant" 0} (6 or 7), 7 or more @{"energy storage units" link "energy storage" 0} and a 
@{"planet destroyer" link "planet destroyer" 0} on the same planet - it is best to build these units on the 
planet furthest away from where you think or know the aliens are so that it 
takes more energy when you use the planet destroyer and that way if the aliens 
have a @{"planet shield" link "planet shield" 0} you are more likely to destroy their planet. The most 
important part of this game is that you can only ever build 35 objects on a 
planet. But remember you can bulldoze them for the return of half of the 
material it cost to build them. The bulldozer facility along with the increased 
number of different constructions gives the game a lot more flexibility, this 
means that the number and type of objects built on your planets will be 
different from game to game. Always remember to demolish constructions on your 
planets after they have ceased to be useful,especially @{"irrigation units" 
link "irrigation unit" 0},
@{"snow melting units" link "snow melting unit"0} and @{"universities." link
"university" 0}
When tech level 5 is reached you should build fusion power plants and demolish 
any @{"energy collectors," link "energy collector" 0} @{"coal power plants"
link "coal power plant" 0} and @{"nuclear power plants." link "nuclear power plant" 0} If you use
method two, after you have destroyed all the alien's planets, the planet 
destroyer, extra fusion power plants and extra energy storage units can be 
demolished.

@node "Mothership" "Mothership"
                                Mothership
The mothership is a very powerful spaceship and the only ship capable of
repairing itself. Destroying it will stop the aliens colonizing other planets
but they can still wipe you out with combat ships and troops. When you have 
built a planet scanner and think you have enough @{"combat ships" link
"combat spaceships" 0} to protect your 
planets try and find the mothership by sending some fighters to all of the 
planets or you can just wait until it finds you and then track it with the 
@{"planet scanner" link "planet scanner" 0} and send enough ships to destroy it. (12-15 pulsar destroyers 
(at Tech. level 8 or above) or equivalent should be sufficient) You will have 
to chase the mothership from planet to planet as it usually moves, once it has 
encountered resistance. 
Do not attack the mothership with small numbers of ships as it will destroy 
them and by the time you have attacked it again it will have repaired itself.

@node "playing against a human opponent" "playing against a human opponent"
                     Playing Against A Human Opponent
Playing against a human opponent is more difficult than against the aliens.
Humans can use @{"energy cannon" link "energy cannon" 0} or @{"planet destroyer" link "planet destroyer" 0} against you.
The number and type of buildings built on your planets is roughly the same
as against the aliens but all of your planets should have @{"universities,"
link "university" 0}
because being the first to develop an energy cannon or planet destroyer can
accelerate victory. A @{"planet shield" link "planet shield" 0} is also advisable so there is less chance 
of the above happening.
The @{"planet scanner" link "planet scanner" 0} becomes a more useful piece of equipment. It can be used to 
discover which planets your opponent has colonized because from time to time 
spacecraft will move between the planets and it is likely that the busiest 
planets will be colonized, it will at least tell you which area of the universe 
is being colonized or explored.
Building @{"spy satellites" link "spy satellite" 0} is still a waste of time and resources as your opponent 
may have an @{"anti spy satellite antenna" link "anti spy satellite antenna" 0} and knowing what is happening on their 
planets is not a major advantage, and you can only be 50% sure of the number of 
spaceships in orbit around the planet.

@node "bugs,anomalies and stuff" "bugs,anomalies and stuff"
                         Bugs,Anomalies And Stuff
When you start a new game the planet the computer allocates you can never be
explored for life forms.
When you build a @{"food robot" link "food robot" 0} on grassland it gives you 3 units of food NOT 2
units as the help feature may display.
After the @{"planet destroyer" link "planet destroyer" 0} is used, it should self destruct afterwards, but if 
you have enough energy you can take 2 or 3 shots with one planet destroyer in 
the same turn by selecting the option more than once from the special commands 
menu.
Colonial Conquest can be multitasked by pressing the left Amiga and A keys.
If you use the planet editor it is worth knowing that when you design your own 
planet and come to save it and you use the 'GB' keymap you will need to press 
the 'Z' key instead of the 'Y' key, to save it.
If you are using a mouse blanker on your system, then it may cause some problems 
when you run Colonial Conquest.
Both Colonial Conquest and the planet editor are available on the Aminet and
from all good PD suppliers.

On planets with few mining sites, greenhouses are best built on desert or

2 energy storage units per planet is a good idea especially if you intend

now require energy to function. If you intend to build a @{"planet scanner"
link "planet scanner" 0} or 
@{"energy cannon" link "energy cannon" 0} on the planet, 2 energy storage units is fine, but if a

It takes 4 energy units, a long time to build and at least 700 energy units to

The best use for the transporter is to move between all of your planets, loading 
and unloading food, material and energy as needed. It is especially useful for 
collecting energy for a @{"planet destroyer" link "planet destroyer" 0} attack.

Build an exploration ship as soon as possible after @{"Tech. level" link
"technology levels" 0} 2 is reached 
and send it out with a couple of combat ships as backup to explore planets for 
alien lifeforms and @{"colonizable planets." link "colonizable planets" 0}

 Only worth building late on in the game if you have troops to transport.

                               Combat Ships
Fighters are only really worth building to protect @{"exploration ships"

explore the universe early on in the game for good @{"colonizable planets."

It is difficult to say which combat ships are the best to build.
Dreadnoughts take less time and material to build and aren't that powerful.
Cobra Ships are take more time and material to build but are more powerful.
I find that Pulsar Destroyers and battlestars are best to build as they are
very powerful and give you more time to get reinforcements to a battle.
