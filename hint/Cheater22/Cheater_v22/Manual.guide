@node desc "What is Cheater ???"
Cheater is a tool that helps you to solve games easier as it allows
you to manipulate scores or the number of lives while you are
playing.

Let's say you're are playing Galaga and you haven't got a lot of
money but you would really like to buy a great weapon. Impossible ???
Not with Cheater. With Cheater you could give yourself the money for
2, 5, 10 or even 100 weapons. Sounds good, doesn't it ???
(See @{" How it works " link how} for detailed information).

Well, although there are other tools that do the same (exactly one, called
TrainerMaker, to be precise) there are some obvious reasons for using
Cheater:

           TrainerMaker           |                 Cheater
                                  |
 - Can only search chip mem       |  - Searches both chip mem and fast mem
 - Can only handle one cheating   |  - Handles unlimited cheating projects
   project                        |    (lives, money)
 - Can only change one address    |  - Can change several addresses at the
   at the same time               |    same time
 - No ARexx port                  |  - ARexx-Port
 - Unflexible gadtools gui        |  - Nice @{" MUI " link mui} gui
 - Costs 18(!) US$                |  - Costs only 10 US$
 - Fast                           |  - Faster
 - No keyfile, updates must       |  - Keyfile support for free updates
   be ordered                     |

->fs how
@node how "How Cheater works"
First of all it is important to know that Cheater can only be used with
games that don't switch off the Amiga multitaskting. To check whether
a certain game runs in multitasking or not, just press <LAMIGA> + <m>.
If the workbench or any other screen appears, it supports multitasking,
if not it doesn't. An exception are games written in AMOS, as there
<LAMIGA> + <a> can be used to toggle between the workbench and the
AMOS game.

Well, every game has to store information such as lives or your score
somewhere in memory. Now, if you want to set this value to what
you want to be, Cheater has to find out where in memory this value
is stored. This is how it works:

1. Start Cheater
2. Start your game and play a little while
3. Pause your game and remember the value that should later be changed
4. Tell this value to Cheater

  *** Cheater will now search the whole memory and remember all     ***
  *** addresses (positions whithin memory) that are containing this ***
  *** value.                                                        ***

5. Switch back to your game and play a little while until the value
   you would like to manipulate has changed.

6. Pause the game again and switch back to Cheater.
7. Tell the changed value to Cheater

  *** It will now check which of the addresses found in step 4 do   ***
  *** now contain the new value. Usually one address will be found. ***
  *** This should be the one where the game has stored the value    ***
  *** you want to manipulate.                                       ***

8. Now you can tell Cheater to set a new value to this address. This
   might for example be 5000 for the number of lives.

9. Switch back to your game and enjoy your great playing skills.

->fs projects
@node projects "Cheating projects"
Maybe you wouldn't like to manipulate only one thing within a game but
two or even more, e.g. your money and the number of lives. Either you would
have to start Cheater twice, or you would have to repeat the complete
procedure (as described under @{" How it works " link how}) everytime
you want to change a value. As this is not very comfortable, I decided
to build in the possibility of having several "cheating projects".

Example:

Let's say you want to change your money and the number lives. Add two
projects (for example "money" and "lives"), choose "money" and act as
described under @{" how it works " link how} in order to give you enough
money. Now select "lives" and repeat the same.

If you'll need more money later, just switch back to "money". Cheater has
remembered everything you've done here and the addresses you have found
(if there are any). So you'll just have to select the address and set it
to a new value.

Great, isn't it !?!
@endnode
->fe
->fs gui
@node gui "Cheater's user interface"
Cheater has got a nice @{" MUI " link mui} gui that consists of one
window which is put up immediately after Cheater is started.

Control elements:
=================

Projects  (only visible if 'use projects' from project menu is selected)
--------

This list shows all projects. With a single click you can select the current
project. A double click displays information about the current project:
The value you searched for, the compare value and the value an address was
last set to. This is the same as 'Information' from the projects menu.

In the string gadget you can change the name of the actual project.

"Add" adds a new project  (only available in the registered version)
"Del" kills the actual project


Settings  (see @{" technical information " link tech} for detailed information)
--------

Mode: Select search mode (Byte, Word or Long)

      Byte can find numbers between 0 and 255  (should only be used
                                                if really necessary)
      Word can find numbers between 0 and 65535
      Long can find numbers between 0 and 2^32


Chip: Select whether Chip ram should be searched for not
Fast: Select whether Fast ram should be searched for not


Let's go cheating
-----------------

Value: Value to be used for a certain function (search, compare, set)
       It can be entered in decimal, hexadecimal (e.g. $1000) or
       binary (e.g. %101011) format and mustn't be bigger than the
       maximum value of the selected mode.

0: Sets "Value" to 0
Max: Sets "Value" to maximum value of selected mode

Search: Search the selected memory for the value entered in the value
        field. This could for example be your actual score.

Compare: After you searched for a certain value and you have played
         until this value has changed, you have to enter it into the
         value field and then press compare. If Cheater has found the
         address(es), they are shown in the address list.

Compare again: Having already searched, this filters out all addresses that
         CURRENTLY do not match the given value.

Set: If comparing succeeded, you can now select one or more addresses,
     enter a new value and press set to set the chosen address(es) to
     the new value. If several addresses are selected, multitasking is
     switched off while they are set. This allows you to evade
     anti-cheating routines of some games.

Address list: Here all found addresses and their current contents are shown.
              The contents are refreshed every 3 seconds.
@endnode
->fe
->fs tech
@node tech "technical information
How to find out which mode should be used:

Usually you should use word mode, as it is ok for the most games,
but there are some exceptions:

- If the game uses very big numbers, higher than 65535, you should
  try long mode.

- If you want to manipulate very small numbers (1-255) AND WORD
  MODE DIDN'T SUCCEED, try byte mode as it is very slow due to
  some technical reasons. (Not a problem caused be Cheater but a fact !!)

The best way is first to try word mode, only if this doesn't work you
should try another mode.
@endnode
->fe
->fs tt
@node tt "Tooltypes / ARexx port"
Cheater understands the following tooltypes:

PROJECTS (without parameters) Project list is shown at start

BUFMEMSIZE=     Size of buffer memory PER PROJECT

Number of memorized addresses = buffer mem / 4
(100000 Bytes => 25000 addresses)

       DOC=     Name and path of the documentation for online help

  KEYFILE=      Name and path of the keyfile (Default 'Cheater.key'
                                                  and 'S:Cheater.key')

The same keywords can be used from CLI:
Cheater: BUFMEMSIZE/N,PROJECTS/S,DOC,KEYFILE


ARexx commands:  (Port: 'CHEATER')

SET   does the same as the 'Set'-Button

Use: Can be sent by for example MCP, FKeys or Toolmanager via hotkey.
     So you can change values while you are playing.
     Great idea, Mucho !!!  :-)

I have already written some programs you might be interested in, too:

AmigaTrainer, a vocabulary trainer. It allows you to learn almost any
language with your computer. The actual version v2.2 can be found in
Aminet, directory misc/edu. Registration fee: 15 US$

DArc is an cataloging tool for the contents of CDROMs or pd disks
(e.g. Fish disks). So it helps you to find any programs on one of your
CDs or disks. Version 1.6 available via Aminet, directory disk/cdrom.
(If you can't find it there, look for v1.5b in biz/misc)
Registration fee: 20 US$.

Registered Cheater users can buy each program for 10 US$.

If you are interested in one or more of the tools you can get it from
Aminet or directly from me. (See also @{" My address " link addr}).
