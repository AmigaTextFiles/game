+-----------------[ Game Informations and Documents: ]-------------------+

 Hype Race is an overhead racing game which features 32bit color graphics.
    Each of the cars feature about 160 frames of animation. If you are 
 running the game on a machine with one megabyte of memory then Hype Race
  allows three cars on the screen. If it is running on machines with two
 megabytes of memory or more, Hype Race allows four cars on screen at once. 
               Any of the cars can be human controlled. 
      Hype Race requires a lot of memory to run. If you only have one     
  megabyte then you probably will not have enough memory to run Hype Race 
    while workbench is running. Even if you have two megabytes you still   
      might only have enough memory free to run the three car version.

   
    You have the improved and updated Version 2.o in your hands which is
     the first real Final Version which will be sold in the stores.
                       The previous Release was a
  beta and also we made some changes which will make the game running on 
 some other amigas with different configurations. This Version will never
    crash from now on. In fact that a lot of people liked this game we
  decided to license it under a new Software Label for Amiga and Pc Games
     We will finish another update soon which you could get by sending us
  your original disc .Also some new Track Disks will follow. The Game will
           be out in some shops in the middle of January 1995.
