                                  ADDENDUM

 Many improvements and modifications have  been  made  to Final Writer since 
its original version released in October 1993. This addendum describes those 
features and should be used  as  a  supplement  to the original Final Writer 
User Manual. If there  is  a  conflict  between  the  addendum  and the user 
manual, the addendum will  contain  the  correct  description. This addendum 
covers all features added to Final Writer in Release 2 and Release 3.

 Addendum 1

                             UNDO/REDO COMMANDS

 *** See Fig - 1 ***

 The "Undo" command instructs  Final  Writer  to  reverse  the most recently 
completed command or action  whether  it  be  typing,  editing or formatting 
information. When an  action  or  command  is  reversed  through  the "Undo" 
feature, Final Writer returns the document  to  its original status prior to 
the reversal.

 When Final Writer reverses an action,  the  action is retained in memory in 
case you want to "Redo"  it.  The  "Redo"  command instructs Final Writer to 
perform an action or  command  that  was  previously  reversed  by an "Undo" 
command.

 The "Undo" and "Redo" commands are  found  in the "Edit" menu. Normally you 
will see the words "Undo"  and  "Redo"  accompanied  by  some action such as 
"Undo Typing" or "Redo Formatting." Generally you can undo a command as long 
as you do not type additional characters.  If  you perform an action that is 
not supported by undo, the menu item will read "Can't Undo."

                              FONT/STYLE STRIP

 The Font/Style Strip is a new command strip that can appear at the top of a 
document's window.  In  the  Final  Writer  User  Manual,  all illustrations 
containing a document window show  the  original  command  strip that is now 
named the Tool strip. Only one command strip can be visible at a given time.

 *** See Fig - 2 **

 The font/Style Strip provides a fast and convenient way to:

 * select paragraph styles.
 * select fonts.
 * select font sizes.
 * change text position.
 * change text case.
 * set text style to any combination of bold, italic, and underline.

 The command strip option can be set  for the document using a menu command, 
or as a preference item through the "Display Preferences" requester.

 2 Addendum

                      EASY BOLD, ITALIC, AND UNDERLINE

 *** See Fig - 2 ***

 When the Font/Style strip is visible you  can click on icons to change text 
to different combinations of BOLD, ITALIC,  and UNDERLINE. The bold, italic, 
and underline icons operate on text in  a  similar manner as do items in the 
"Text" menu. If text is selected when an icon is pressed, the selected range 
of text is affected. If text is  not  selected  when an icon is pressed, new 
characters typed at the current  insertion  point  will reflect the state of 
the icons.

 The "B" icon sets text to BOLD, the  "I" icon sets test too ITALIC, the "U" 
icon sets text to UNDERLINE, and the  "P"  icon  is  used to set text to its 
plain version. Clicking  on  the  "P"  icon  removes  and  bold,  italic, or 
underline attributes.  Combination  of  the  "B",  "I",  and  "U"  icons are 
allowed. For example, to set text to  BOLD-ITALIC, click on both the "B" and 
"I" icons.

 Previously to set text to bold, italic and bold-italic it was necessary for 
you to open a font designed  for  bold, italic, or bold-italic. Final Writer 
still must open a font in order to draw text in one of these styles, but now 
all you have to do is  click  on  an  icon.  When  you click on one of these 
icons, Final Writer uses the font  name  to  determine  if the font is bold, 
italic, or bold-italic. For example, SoftSans-Bold  is  the name of the font 
Final Writer looks for when searching for  the bold  version of SoftSans. It 
is possible that a font you  may  be  using  does  not have one of the bold, 
italic, or bold-italic fonts available.  Furthermore,  the bold, italic, and 
underline icons only work with  NimbusQ  and  Type1 fonts - not Compugraphic 
fonts.

                             FLOATING PALETTES

 *** See Fig - 2 ***

 There are now three palettes  available  from  which  you can select tools, 
user buttons, and paragraph styles. You have the option of showing or hiding 
these palettes by choosing  the  appropriate  menu  command  from the "View" 
menu. Once a palette is  shown,  you  can  move  its  window anywhere on the 
screen. You can also size the "User Button" and "Paragraph Styles" palettes. 
When you quit Final Writer,  the  program  will remember which palettes were 
open, where they were on  the  screen,  and  their  sizes. The next time you 
start Final Writer, the  palettes  will  be  automatically restored to their 
saved size and position.

 Addendum 3

 Palettes are shared between document  windows.  If  you  have more than one 
document window open, only  one  set  of  palettes  will  be  used. When you 
activate a document window, the appropriate settings in each palette will be 
selected to agree with that document  window will remain active. However, if 
you click on a palette's title  bar,  or  change  the size of a palette, the 
palette window becomes active. When this occurs, you must click the mouse on 
the title bar of your document window to reactivate the document window.

 Palettes can be positioned and sized with  the mouse. You can also position 
and size palettes using the keyboard as follows:

 * Left, Right, Up, and Down arrows move palettes in medium sized
   increments.

 * CTRL along with Left, Right, Up and Down arrows move palettes in
   one-pixel increments.

 * Shift along with left, Right, Up, and Down arrows move palettes to either
   side of the screen.

 * Space bar sizes the palette's window to exactly fit the buttons shown
   within it.

 All of the above keyboard manipulations require the palette window to be
 active.

 Palette windows may be closed by:

 * Choosing the appropriate "Hide" command from the "View" menu.

 * Clicking in the palette window's "Close" box.

 * Pressing the "ESC" key when a palette window is active.

                     SELECTIVE DISPLAY OF MASTER PAGES

 *** See Fig - 3 ***

 Previously, master page items were included  on  each  page of a section or 
document. Now you have the  option  of  displaying  master page items on all 
pages, only the first page, or on all pages except the first page. A typical 
use for this new feature would be to hide a page number on the first page of 
a document, but show it on succeeding pages.  Another use might be to show a 
letterhead on the first page  of  a  document,  but not on succeeding pages. 
This new option is set in the "Section  Setup" requester and also in the new 
"Easy Page Number requester.

 4 Addendum

                              NEW PAGE FORMATS

 *** See Fig - 3 ***

 Now there are two  new  options  for  formatting  page  numbers. One option 
instructs Final Writer to automatically place  the word "Page" before a page 
number. The other option instructs the program  to place a section name with 
the page number. When the latter option  is chosen, the program will put the 
section name on the left side of the page number on right-sided (odd) pages, 
and on the right side of the  page on left-sided (even) pages. This "Section 
Name" option is  the  one  used  for  formatting  the  page  numbers in this 
addendum.

                        AUTO-SAVE WITHOUT REQUESTERS

 *** See Fig - 4 ***

 Originally  Final  Writer's  auto-save  feature   worked  by  displaying  a 
requester asking you if it  was  all  right  to  save  the document once the 
appropriate time had elapsed since the document  was last saved. Now you can 
instruct Final Writer to  automatically  save  a document without displaying 
the requester. This new option  is  set  in  the "Document Save Preferences" 
requester.

                       TRIPLE AND QUAD CLICK COMMANDS

 The following mouse click options are now available:

 SINGLE-CLICK  - Sets insertion point in text.
 DOUBLE-CLICK  - Selects the current word.
 TRIPLE-CLICK  - Selects the current sentence (New).
 QUAD-CLICK    - Selects the current paragraph (New).

                        SHIFT KEY EXTENDED SELECTION

 A range of text can be selected by  first clicking the mouse where you want 
the selection to begin. Then  while  holding  down  the SHIFT key, click the 
mouse where you want to end the  selection.  This feature is useful when the 
range to be selected spans more than  one  screen of text. It is faster than 
dragging the mouse through several pages of text to be selected.

 Addendum 5

                          ENHANCED TEXT SELECTION

 When dragging the mouse to select  text,  text  added to the selected range 
now depends upon any multi-click  operation  that started the selection. For 
example, to select whole sentences at a time while dragging the mouse, first 
triple-click to select a sentence and  before  you  release the mouse on the 
third click, begin to drag the mouse over the remaining text to be selected.

                         DRAG AND DROP TEXT EDITING

 Drag and Drop editing is a short  cut  for  moving a block of text within a 
document. Previously, your only choice  of  moving  a  block  of text was to 
select the text, choose "Cut" from  the  "Edit"  menu, click the mouse where 
the block of text was to be moved,  and choose "Paste" from the "edit" menu. 
Now all you have to do is select the text and drag it to its new location.

 TO MOVE A BLOCK OF TEXT USING THE DRAG AND DROP FEATURE:
 --------------------------------------------------------

 1. Select the block of text to be moved.

 2. Press the mouse within the selected text and while holding down the
    mouse button, drag the mouse so that the insertion mark is where you
    want the block to be moved.

 3. Release the mouse button.

 The program will move the block of text and redraw the window.

 6 Addendum

                        EASY HEADER/FOOTER CREATION

 Not everyone cares to learn about master  in order to create headers and/or 
footers in their document. Final  Writer  now  lets you easily create header 
and/or footer in a document.

TO CREATE A HEADER AND/OR FOOTER IN YOUR DOCUMENT:
--------------------------------------------------

 1. Choose "Easy Header/Footer .. " from the "Layout" menu.

    The program will display the Easy Header/Footer" requester.

 *** See Fig - 5 ***

 2. Indicate elements you want in your header and footer using the
    requester.

    You can specify that either a Page Number, Section Name, or text is to
    appear in either the left, centre, or right of the header and/or footer.
    If you choose the "Text" option, the program will use whatever is typed
    into the "text" data entry area. Use the "Type Spec - Define" button to
    specify the type of font you want to use for the header or footer.

 3. Click on "Save" or "Use."

    If you click on "Save" the settings made will be saved as defaults for
    new documents. If you click on "Use," the settings will only affect the
    current document.

 Addendum 7

                            EASY PAGE NUMBERING

 The simplest way to number  a  document's  pages  is  to  use the Easy Page 
Number feature. Using this  requester  you  can  specify  the position of an 
automatic page number including whether it  is  to appear on all pages, only 
the first page, or on all pages except for the first page.

TO CREATE AN AUTOMATIC PAGE NUMBER IN YOUR DOCUMENT:
----------------------------------------------------

 1. Choose "Easy Page Number ... " from the "Layout" menu.

 *** See Fig - 6 ***

 2. Indicate where and how you want the page number to appear using the
    requester.

 3. Click on "Save" or "Use."

    If you click on "Save," the settings made will be saved as defaults for
    new documents. If you click on "Use," the settings will affect only the
    current document.

                            FINAL DATA INTERFACE

 Final Writer's "Print  Merge"  feature  now  works  directly with databases 
created in SoftWood's Final Data database manager as well as ASCII files, If 
you use Final Data, you can  "Print  Merge"  with Final Writer without going 
through the extra step of saving an  ASCII data file within Final Data. When 
you specify the file name to be used  (See "Print Merge" in the Final Writer 
User Manual), the program  will  automatically  detect  it  as  a Final Data 
database rather than an ASCII file. You  do  not have to do anything special 
to indicate the file is in Final Data format.

 8 Addendum

                            POLYGON GRAPHIC TOOL

 A new polygon graphic tool lets  you  draw straight line bordered shapes of 
any type. For example, using the polygon  graphic tool you can create stars, 
diamonds, triangles, or any other shape  that  is  formed with three or more 
straight lines.

TO CREATE A POLYGON:
--------------------

 1. Choose the "Polygon Tool" icon from either the Tool Strip or the Tool
    Palette.

 *** See Fig - 2 ***

 2. Click the mouse within the document where you want to start drawing and
    release the mouse.

    Unlike the other graphic tools which require you to press and drag the
    mouse while drawing, polygons are drawn by clicking the mouse where line
    segments are to begin and end.

 3. While the mouse button is up, move the mouse to where you want the
    current line segment to end.

    While you move the mouse, the program will draw a dashed line to
    represent the line segment.

 4. Complete the polygon be eventually clicking the mouse over the point
    that started the polygon.

    The program will now draw the polygon and flow text around it according
    to the default polygon settings as specified in the "Shape Settings"
    requester.

                           SPECIAL GRAPHIC SHAPES

 You can use Final Writer's special rectangle  and oval tools to create your 
own shapes using a rectangle, rounded-corner  rectangle, oval, or filled arc 
as the starting shape. The  shapes  you  can  draw  are limited only by your 
imagination. Line thickness, text  flow,  and  other  attributes depend upon 
default preference settings  defined  in  the  "Shape  Settings Preferences" 
requester.

TO CREATE A SHAPE USING THE SPECIAL RECTANGLE OR OVAL TOOL:
-----------------------------------------------------------

 1. Choose one of the special shape icons in either the Tool Strip or Tool
    Palette.

 *** See Fig - 2 ***

 Addendum 9

 2. Press the mouse in the document where you want to begin drawing, and
    while holding down the mouse button, drag the mouse to draw the object.

 3. Release the mouse button when the starting object is as large as you
    want it to be.

 4. Click the mouse on the "Select" tool.

 5. Click the mouse on the object to be manipulated.

    Final Writer will draw several control points around the object. These
    control points can be used to change the shape of the object.

 6. Press the mouse on one of the control points and drag the mouse to the
    desired location.

 7. Release the mouse button when the control point is where you want it.

TO RESIZE A SPECIAL SHAPE:
--------------------------

 1. Click the mouse on the shape to be resized.

 2. While holding the SHIFT key down, press the mouse on one of the selected
    shape's control points, and drag the mouse.

    As you drag the mouse the program will draw an outline of the resized
    shape.

 3. Release the mouse button.

    Final Writer will redraw the window with the shape resized.

                       DRAWING EMPTY AND FILLED ARCS

 Empty arcs can be drawn using the Oval toll while holding down the ALT key. 
Filled arcs can be drawn using the  Special Oval tool while holding down the 
ALT key. To draw either type of arc, be  sure the ALT key is held down while 
drawing the oval. When you release  the  mouse  button, an arc will be drawn 
rather than an oval.

 10 Addendum

                         "SECTION SETUP" REQUESTER

 The original "Section Setup"  requester  has  been  modified to support new 
features and make defining page numbers easier.

 *** See Fig - 7 ***

New objects within the "section Setup" requester are:

 MASTER PAGE ITEMS  This option defines whether or not master page items are
                    to appear on all pages, only the first page of a
                    section, or on all pages with the exception of the first
                    page.

 NUMBER BY          This option defines whether the document is to be
                    numbered by document or section.

 FORMAT             This defines the format of the page number.

 TEXT               This defines text that Final Writer is to include when
                    creating page numbers. "Page" results in the word "Page"
                    being inserted before the actual page number. "Section
                    Name" results in the name of the section being inserted
                    along with the page number. When "Section Name" is
                    selected, the section's name is placed to the left of
                    the page number on the right-side (odd) pages, and to
                    the right of the page number on left-sided (even) pages.

 PREFIX             Any text you place in this data entry area will be
                    inserted before the page number.

 FIRST#             This is the number to use for the first page of the
                    section when numbering by section, or the first page of
                    the document when numbering by document.

 Addendum 11

                           "PAGE SETUP" REQUESTER

 The original "Page Setup" requester has  been modified by removing the page 
numbering objects and placing them in the "Section Setup" requester.

 *** See Fig - 8 ***

                      "DISPLAY PREFERENCES" REQUESTER

 *** See Fig - 9 ***

 The original "Display Preferences" requester  has  been modified to support 
new features. New objects within this requester are:

 USER BUTTON STRIP  This option defines which, if any, user button strip
                    should appear at the top of each document window.

 COMMAND STRIP      This option defines which if any, command strip should
                    appear at the top of each document window.


 12 Addendum

                      "SPELLER PREFERENCES" REQUESTER"

 The original "Speller/Hyphenation" requester has  been modified by removing 
the hyphenation options and placing them in there own requester.

 *** See Fig - 10 ***

                     "HYPHENATION PREFERENCES" REQUESTER

 This is a new requester  that  was  created from the hyphenation preference 
settings that were in the original "Speller/Hyphenation" requester.

 *** See Fig - 11 ***

 The following new  object  has  been  added  to  the hyphenation preference 
settings:

 METHOD             This indicates how Final Writer determines how to
                    hyphenate words. "Algorithm only" is faster, but
                    "Dictionary only" is usually more accurate. When
                    "Dictionary and Algorithm" is selected, if the word
                    cannot be found in the dictionary, the algorithm method
                    is used.

 Addendum 13

                       "EASY HEADER/FOOTER" REQUESTER

 This new requester is used  to  define  simple  headers and footers without 
working directly with master pages.  This  requester is described earlier in 
the addendum.

 *** See Fig - 5 ***

                        "EASY PAGE NUMBER" REQUESTER

 This new requester is used  to  define  the document page numbering without 
working directly with master pages.  This  requester is described earlier in 
the addendum.

 *** See Fig - 6 ***

 14 Addendum

                               "LAYOUT" MENU

 The "Layout" menu has been  modified  to  support  new features and to make 
operation of existing features easier.

 *** See Fig - 12 ***

                      "DOCUMENT PREFERENCES" REQUESTER

 The old "Document Item Preferences" requester has been renamed and enhanced 
with new preference options.  The  new  name  of  the requester is "Document 
Preferences."

 *** See Fig - 13 ***

 The following objects have been added to this requester:

 TURN ON            Use this setting to turn on or off various typing and
                    editing features.

 DEFINE             Use the buttons in this object to define options for
                    some of the features that are turned on in the "turn on"
                    object.

 LANGUAGE           This preference item is used to specify the language to
                    be used for spelling, thesaurus, and hyphenation.

                               TYPE AND SPELL

 Release 3's "Type and Spell"  feature  will  flash  the screen whenever you 
type a word that Final Writer cannot find in its spelling dictionary. Before 
the program checks a word, it  waits  for  you  to enter some character that 
cannot be part of  the  word  (space,  period,  comma,  etc.). The "Type and 
Spell" feature  is  turned  "on"  or  "off"  in  the  "document Preferences" 
requester.

 Addendum 15

                         MULTIPLE LANGUAGE SUPPORT

 Prior to  Release  3,  Final  Writer  was  created  so  that  its  speller, 
thesaurus, and hyphenation databases  were  the  same  as  the screen text's 
language. Therefore, it was  not  possible  for  a  German  version of Final 
Writer to use the  English  spelling  dictionary  to  spell check an English 
document. Currently Final  Writer  Release  3  can  access  databases of the 
following languages:

 * US English
 * British English
 * Canadian French
 * European French
 * German
 * NORWEGIAN

 In order for more than one choice to  be available in this option, you must 
have the files of the  other  languages  in  the FWSpell and FWThes drawers. 
Only one set of languages files come with Final Writer. Other language files 
are available for a small fee from SoftWood. Call 1-800-247-8330 for pricing 
information. Instructions for installing  multiple  languages accompany each 
language purchased. The  language  you  want  to  use  is  specified  in the 
"Document Preferences" requester.

                          PREFERENCES NAME CHANGES

 The "preferences" sub-menu has been changed as follows:

 * "Speller/Hyphenation" preferences are now two items.
 * "Document Item" preferences are now "Document" preferences.

                              TROUBLESHOOTING

 This is a collection of frequently requests SoftWood receives for technical 
support. Each problem described refers  to  one  or  more solutions from the 
"Solutions" list. Some  problems  may  have  solutions  other  than the ones

                                 SOLUTIONS

  (1) The name of the disk is not correct. The disk was probably copied or
      renamed and a leading, trailing, or embedded spaces in the new name.

  (2) Make sure you have the correct version of Workbench. Final Writer
      requires version 2.04 (System Library Version 37.67) or higher.
      Version 2.01 does not meet the version requirement.

  (3) Most of the time one of the system files was replaced with an older
      version by some installation procedure. The most common file that gets
      replaced is "diskfont.library" which is located in the SYSTEM:LIBS
      drawer.

 Addendum 17

  (4) For new disks, return the disk and proof of purchase to SoftWood for a
      free replacement. For "used" disks, return the disk and $5.00 for
      replacement.

  (5) To correct, access the "Page Setup" requester and set the
      "Orientation" setting to "Wide." This will reverse the dimensions and
      edit area values within the requester. Next manually change them back
      to their original values. If you use a PostScript printer, you must
      also set the "Orientation" setting in the PostScript Print
      Preferences to "Wide."

  (6) PostScript printers require the correct tray for the size of the
      document to be printed (even if the printer menu or switch is set to
      the document's size). For example, if you specify "Print Size" as
      "Legal", then the printer must have a legal size paper feed tray.

  (7) This may be due to a lack of computer CHIP memory. To reduce the
      memory that is being used, when you start Final Writer, select
      "Workbench" for the "Screen Type." You can also save memory by setting
      all Spelling and Hyphenation preference setting to their smallest
      size.

  (8) Depending upon the printer, set the "paper Feed" to "Continuous" is
      the same as "fanfold."

  (9) The Print Area and/or Edit Area settings are probably incorrect. The
      Print Area defines the physical limitations of a printer, and are
      usually specified in the printer's manual. For most printers, the left
      and right Print Area settings should be .25. For continuous feed
      printers, the top and bottom settings are always 0. Generally for
      sheet fed printers, the top and bottom settings are not zero and
      usually have different values.

      The Edit Area defines where you want to limit the document's text on
      a page. The top, bottom, inside, and outside values must be equal to
      or larger than the corresponding Print Area values. In other words,
      the Edit Area must not lie outside of the Print Area.

      To view the Print Area and Edit Area as they are set for a document,
      select the Print Area and Edit Area page guides from the "Page Guides"
      sub-menu within the "View" menu. Make sure that rectangles formed by
      the Edit Area is equal to or within the Print Area.

 (10) Workbench fonts are not readable by SoftWood products except for
      Compugraphic fonts that have been installed according to the Amiga's
      guidelines for installing fonts.

 (11) You must use the proper printer driver to obtain the best results. If
      you cannot locate a driver for your printer, try on of the drives
      whose name appears similar to your printer. For example, the HP 560c
      printer will work with the HP_DeskJet driver, but will not fully
      utilize the printer.

 (12) Use tab stops to align columns rather than using spaces.
