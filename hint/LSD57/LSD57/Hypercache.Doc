NEW SUMMARY VERSION 1.01C

The  new  version of Summary included on this diskette cures an infrequent problem
with some systems which caused Summary to not locate all active caches.
	
CHANGES FOR VERSION 1.01B

The diskchange logic code has been replaced, enabling more effective determination
of disk changes, particularly on removable media where more than one filesystem is
being  run  on  that  device  (eg:  DF0 with both AmigaDOS and an MSDOS filesystem
active)
   
The  device  search routine has been revised, eliminating infrequent enforcer hits
that may have occurred on some systems in earlier versions.

The cache is approximately 25% faster than the initial 1.01 release.

CHANGES FOR VERSION 1.01

Version 1.01 is approximately 35% faster than version 1.0


HINTS, CAVEATS

What do "lines", "sets", and "prefetch" mean?

A set is a completely independant cache for your device.  Rather than running only
one  cache  when you start HyperCache, it sets up several, as defined by the value
of  your  "sets"  parameter,  or 8 by default.  In this way, if a sector cannot be
found  in  one cache, it may be found in another.  Although transparent to you, it
increases  the  chance  a  sector  will  be found in the cache (known as your "Hit
Ratio").

The  amount  of "prefetch", which defaults to 4 sectors, refers to the size of the
sector  groups  which HyperCache moves to and from the actual device.  If prefetch
is  4,  for example, HyperCache will never read less than 4 sectors at a time from
the device.  Not only is it more efficient to read several sectors at once, but it
can  also  increase  your  performance, since when your application wants the next
sectors  from  the  device, they are often already in memory, even before they are
needed!

The  number  of  "lines"  refers to the number of these prefetch sector groups per
"set".    Thus,  at default, you have 8 sets each with 32 lines of 4 sectors each.
The  overall  size  of the cache can thus be computed as LINES * SETS * PREFETCH *
512.  (Here 512 is the number of bytes per sector).

Changing the cache size:

The  default  cache  geometry is 4 prefetch, 8 sets, and 32 lines.  If you wish to
double  the  size of the cache, you can double any one of these parameters.  It is
generall  suggested  that  you  double  the  number  of lines or sets, rather than
prefetch.    For  example, to set up a one megabyte cache on DH0:, you would enter
the following:

HyperCache -v dh0 -l 64        // Recommended for 68000 systems
or
HyperCache -v dh0 -s 16        // Recommended for accelerated systems

The number of "sets" is actually the number of independant caches that will be set
up  for  that  device,  and  "lines"  is  the  size  of  each one of those caches.
Increasing the number of sets normally increases the cache hit ratio, but requires
slightly  more  CPU  to  locate  a  sector  in  the cache.  For slow media or fast
processors,  this is recommended as the setting to increase.  For a standard 68000
CPU with a fast hard drive, we recommend increasing the number of lines instead.

The  -p parameter allows you to specify the minimum number of sectors that will be
read  from  the  device,  regardless  of how few an application actually requests.
Under  normal  circumstances,  this  can increase performance significantly.  On a
very  fragmented drive, however, it can actually hurt performance.  If this is the
case,  it  is suggested you defragment your hard drive or decrease the prefetch to
2:

HyperCache -v dh0 -p 2 -s 32

[  Note that you may supply any one, two, or three of the -s, -l, and -p options. 
Those that are not supplied will retain their default values.  ]

You  may wish to experiment with these values to determine which provides the best
results for your particular system and usage.

If  you are having trouble getting HyperCache to detach from the command line, ie:
you  cannot  close  the  Shell  or  CLI  window from which it was run, remember to
include  the  -n  parameter  on  the  command line.  This prevents HyperCache from
displaying  its startup information and locking the output stream for that window.

When  using  a  backup  program  and  writing to a floppy disk, you should disable
caching  on  that  floppy  if you intend to verify your writes.  If you fail to do
this,  the  backup  program  will verify what it has just written against what was
retained  in  the  cache, which is pointless.  You need only do this for the drive
you are writing to.  HyperCache may be left active on all other devices.

It  is  recommended  that  you  disable  HyperCache  on any drive which you may be
performing  low-level repairs to, such as a disk salvage operation, DiskDoctor, or
a file re-orginization process.  HyperCache will not normally interfere with these
operations,  and  has never shown to be incompatible with them, but it is still an
advisable safety precaution.

Users  of  68020-based  systems  may  opt  to  use  the  special  68030 version of
HyperCache  included  in  this  distribution,  although  the  code itself has been
optimized with the 68030 processor in mind.

Some  users  have  experienced  problems  when starting Consultron's CrossPC after
starting  HyperCache.    If  you experience such problems, try starting HyperCache
after CrossPC.  This only effects drives which CrossPC will share with AmigaDOS.

If  you  are  not receiving as big a performance jump as you had expected, you may
want to check your hard drive for fragmentation.  Fragmentation (which means large
files  are  broken up into smaller pieces and scattered across the disk) hurts the
performance  of  HyperCache  significantly.  To defragment your drive, you may use
any  of  several  available  commercial  and  shareware  hard  drive reorganizers.
Backing  up your drive, formatting it, and restoring it will have the same effect,
but of course takes more time.

Problems with Certain Devices and Controllers:

Some users have reported problems with the HardFrame controller as well as certain
ICD  controllers.    If  you  have  such  a controller, and have been experiencing
problems  with  it,  please  indicate  this  on  your  registration  card.  We are
continually  revising  the  product to enhance its compatibility with non-standard
controllers, and may have a fix for you.

HyperCache  has  been  optimized for use with the OFS, FFS, and MSDOS filesystems,
all  of  which  employ  a  512  byte sector size.  If you are using a device which
deviates  from the 512 byte normal, please contact us, as we can provide a version
which  is far more generic in its approach to the filesystem (although at a slight
cost in performance).


Please  note  that  for  the  protection  of  the  customer  and  the authors, all
executables on this distribution disk are serialized and traceable.

If  you  are  impressed  enough  to consider giving a copy of your HyperCache to a
friend, don't!  :-)
