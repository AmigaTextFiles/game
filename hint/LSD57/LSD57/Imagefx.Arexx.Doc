                          IMAGEFX AREXX COMMANDS
                                RELEASE 2.0


   This document assumes that you are familiar with programming in the
Arexx language, and only describes the commands specific to ImageFX.

   All commands, unless otherwise noted, return a non-zero error code if
something went wrong. This includes cancelling the operation.  If the
return code is 0, then a result string may be provided.

   Those commands marked with (Arexx Only) may only be used properly from
an Arexx macro.  All other commands may be used in scripts, key
definitions, toolbox definitions, the command shell, or Arexx macros at
will.

   When a command is invoked from the shell, any result string returned
will be printed to the console.  Arexx errors will also be displayed on the
console.

   Commands and arguments marked with (2.0) are new for ImageFX 2.0.

HOW TO READ THIS DOCUMENT

   FORMAT
      This gives the command name followed by its argument template.  The
      argument template follows the standard AmigaDOS CLI command format.
      Each keyword (separated by commas) represents a possible argument.
      Here are the types of arguments:

           /A   Always required (cumulative with other modifiers).
           /F   Final argument (rest of line).
           /K   Keyword required.
           /N   Number argument.
           /S   Switch keyword.

      Example:

      FORMAT
           RequestFile Title/A,Path,File,Pattern

      There are four possible arguments to this command.  The first one
      MUST be specified.  The remaining three are optional.  All are text
      arguments.  This template can be filled in any of the following ways:

      /* the complete longhand format: */
      RequestFile TITLE "Load Image" PATH "DH0:" FILE "Image" PATTERN
      "#?.pic"

      /* the abbreviated format (if the keywords are not specified, the
      arguments are filled in in order.) */
      RequestFile "Load Image" "DH0:" "Image" "#?.pic"

      /* only the first argument is required: */
      RequestFile "Load Image"

      /* to skip arguments... you MUST use the "pattern" keyword in this
      case otherwise the "#?.pic" will go into the "path" argument: */
      RequestFile "Load Image" PATTERN "#?.pic"

      /* quotation marks around arguments are only necessary if there are
      spaces in the argument. */

   FUNCTION
      Describes what this command actually does.

   INPUTS
      Describes in detail all of the possible arguments to the command.

   RESULT
      Describes the result string returned from the command, if one is in
      fact returned.  If the command is used from Arexx, this result string
      will be found in the RESULT variable.  If the command is typed in the
      command shell, then the result string is just printed out to the
      console.  The result string is lost when invoked from a key, script,
      or the toolbox.

      All commands will return a result code in the Arexx variable RC
      regardless of whether they return a result string or not.  A result
      code of zero indicates success.

   FUNCTION
      Set the active palette range.

   INPUTS
      Range
         Palette range to make active directly (0-8).  Range 0 is taken to
         mean the ALL range.

      Next
         Cycle up through the ranges.

      Prev
         Cycle down through the ranges.

      Note: If no arguments are given, no change is made.

   RESULT
      Returns the current active range number, before any changes are made.

   EXAMPLES
      /* activate the "all" range */
         ActiveRange 0
         /* activate color range 4 */
         ActiveRange 4




ADD (OBSOLETE)

   FORMAT
      Add Alpha/S,Scale/S

   FUNCTION
      Perform a composite add operation to the main and swap buffers.  For
      backwards compatibility, this command uses the old-style Add routine.
      See the Composite hook for details on the new-style compositing
      functions.

   INPUTS
      Alpha
         If specified, the alpha channel will be used as a blend control
         image during the composite.

      Scale
         If specified, the swap buffer will be scaled to fit the region
         processed.

   RESULT
      None.

   EXAMPLES
      /* composite add the main and swap buffers */
         Add
         /* composite add, using alpha channel */
         Add ALPHA
         /* composite add, scaling swap into region */
         Add SCALE




ADDAREA

   FORMAT
      AddArea X/N/A,Y/N/A

   FUNCTION
      Add a point to the current area definition.

   INPUTS
      X,Y
         Coordinates of the new point, in buffer pixels.

   RESULT
      None.

   EXAMPLES
      /* add point 100,50 to current area */
         AddArea 100 50

   FUNCTION
      Draw into the main buffer using the airbrush.  The path the airbrush
      follows is defined by calls to NewArea/AddArea.

   INPUTS
      None.

   RESULT
      None.

   EXAMPLES
      Airbrush

   SEE ALSO
      NewArea,AddArea




AIRBRUSHSETTINGS

         The state is toggled between either Frisket or Texture.

   RESULT
      Returns the state of the alpha channel before any change is made,
      either "Off", "Frisket", or "Texture".




ANTIALIAS (OBSOLETE)

   FORMAT
      AntiAlias Threshold/N

   FUNCTION
      Perform an anti-aliasing effect on the current image or region.  For
      backwards compatibility, this command uses the old-style (1.5) anti-
      alias routine.  See the AntiAlias hook for details on the new anti-
      alias routine.

READPIXELS (AREXX ONLY)

   FORMAT
      ReadPixels Var/A,Row/N/A,Width/N,LeftEdge/N

   FUNCTION
      This function will directly read a block of pixels from a specified
      scanline of the Main buffer.  This can only be used from Arexx, as it
      requires a variable in which to store the results.

   INPUTS
      Var
         Specifies the name of the Arexx variable in which to store the
         resulting pixel information.  The information is stored as a byte-
         packed string of digits in the order “RGBRGBRGB...”; for example
         ‘FF0000 00FF00 0000FF’x would be three pixels of bright red,
         green, and blue respectively.  When reading from a greyscale
         buffer, only one byte per pixel is stored; thus ‘FF 00 40’x would
         be 3 pixels of high, medium, and low intensity grey.  Be careful
         that Arexx does not expard you variable name; you must enclose it
         in quotes within the Arexx program like this:

         ReadPixels 'MYVAR' 0 320 0
            newpixels = REVERSE(myvar)
            /* etc.... */


         You should always specify the variable in upper case, as all
         variables are converted to upper case by Arexx.

      Row
         Scanline of the image from which to read pixel information.
         Scanlines are numbered starting with 0 at the top and going down
         to Height-1 at the bottom.  An error will be returned if you try
         to read outside the bounds of the main buffer.

      Width
         Number of pixels to read from the specified scanline.  If not
         specified, the entire width of the scanline is read.

      LeftEdge
         How far from the left edge of the image to start reading.  This
         value should range from 0 (at the leftmost edge) to the width of
         the image minus 1.  If not specified, a left offset of 0 is used.

   RESULT
      Pixel information will be returned in the variable specified, in the
      format detailed above.

WRITEPIXELS (AREXX ONLY)

   FORMAT
      WritePixels Var/A,Row/N/A,Width/N,LeftEdge/N

   FUNCTION
      Write a block of pixels to a specified scanline of the main buffer.
      This can only be used from Arexx, as it requires a variable from
      which to read the pixel data.

   INPUTS
      Var
         Specifies the name of the Arexx variable from which to read the
         pixel information.  The information is stored as a byte-packed
         string of digits in the order “RGBRGBRGB...”; for example ‘FF0000
         00FF00 0000FF’x would be three pixels of bright red, green, and
         blue respectively.  When writing to a greyscale buffer, only one
         byte per pixel is used; thus ‘FF 80 40’x would be 3 pixels of
         high, medium, and low intensity grey.  Be careful that Arexx does
         not expand your bariable name; you must enclose it in quotes
         within the Arexx program like this:

         newpixels = REVERSE(myvar)
            WritePixels 'NEWPIXELS' 0 320 0
            /* etc.... */


         You should always specify the variable in upper case, as all
         variables are converted to upper case by Arexx.

      Row
         Scanline of the image where the pixel information is stored.
         Scanlines are numbered starting with 0 at the top and going down
         to Height-1 at the bottom.  An error will be returned if you try
         to write outside the bounds of the main buffer.

      Width
         Number of pixels to write to the specified scanline.  If not
         specified, the entire width of the scanline is assumed.

      LeftEdge
         How far from the left edge of the image to start writing.  This
         value should range from 0 (at the leftmost edge) to the width of
         the image minus 1.  If not specified, a left offset of 0 is
         assumed.

   RESULT
      None.




XOR

   FORMAT
      Xor Alpha/S,Scale/S

   FUNCTION
      Perform a composite exclusive-or operation between the main and swap
      buffers.

   INPUTS

         image during the composite.

      Scale
         If specified, the swap buffer will be scaled to the size of the
         region processed.

   RESULT
      None.




YELLOW

   FORMAT
      Yellow Adjust/N

   FUNCTION
      Adjust the yellow content of the current image or region.

   INPUTS
      Adjust
         Amount to adjust the yellow (-127 to +127).

      None.




ZOOM

   FORMAT
      Zoom Direction/A,Mouse/S

   FUNCTION
      Zoom the preview display into or out of the current buffer.

   INPUTS
      Direction
         Direction of zoom; should be one of "In", "Out", or "Full" (to
         zoom all the way back out to full screen).

      Mouse
         If specified, the zoom will be centered around the current mouse
         coordinates.  Otherwise, it will be centered on the display.

   RESULT
      None.
