Part Three


    OVERLANDER:
                    
        JUST A FEW TIPS - When cruising the highway don't stop shooting, and
        always choose the highest paid mission.  Buy fuel carefully, only
        enough fuel for that level, after level 1 you must buy a leanburner.
        Try to stay in the middle of the road and travel fast, travelling
        slowly only burns more fuel.  Fire bombs are more useful than smart
        bombs when you learn how to use them.  Bulletproofing is necessary
        after level 2.  When travelling through the barriers the best speed
        is 90-120mph.

        LEVEL 1:
    
            1. Select counterfeit money.
    
            2. Fuel up to 14 notches on the fuel guage.
    
            3. Get turbo, 4 battering rams and two flare bombs.
    
            4. After the first bikes slow down or the gunners will kill you.

            5. Destroy trucks from as far away as possible.

            6. Slow to 100-150 mph to negotioate barriers.

            7. If you stay in the middle lane when you come to the wrecks
               you wont die.

        LEVEL 2:

            1. Select kidnapped official.

            2. Fuel up to half full.

            3. Buy leanburner, a few bullet proofs, rams, and flare bombs.

            4. After first bikes there's a nasty surprise in the valley
               below.

        LEVEL 3: DARKLANDS

            1. Select plutonium.

            2. Fuel up to half full (if you have leanburner - if you don't
               then fill up to the max.

            3. Buy rams, bullet proofing, flare bombs and lives if you need
               them.

            4. The toughest part of the course is early on, so don't be
               afraid to let loose with the flare bombs.

        LEVEL 4: THE GUTTER RUN

            1. Select illegal chemicals. fill up to max level.

            2. Buy maximum rams, bullet proofs and as many lives as you can
               afford and flare and smart bomb depending on your bank
               balance.
            3. The barriers are every where on this level and you will need
               to be at 90 - 100 mph to avoid them all.  Try to save your
                rams for later in the level.

            4. The alleys in 4 are real mean.  Smartbombs and bullet
               proofing are your best chances of survival.

        LEVEL 5: GRAVEYARD

            1. Choose the president.  Fill up to maximum fuel.

            2. Buy everything $40,000 up front plus whatever you had from
               the last level should be enough, lives should be on the top
               of your shopping list followed by rams, proofing, brakes,
               armour and weapons - don't bother with the wheelblades!

            3. do the same as for the last level.  Because your car's at
               maximum everything, this level shouldn't proove too
               difficult.

    PACLAND:

        When the title screen appears, type "AVALON".  The screen should

        the following:

        Start a two player game.  Make it as far as you can with player one.
        With player two, you must be able to make it as far as the fairy to
        collect your boots.  Now that you have gotten your boots, you are
        going backwards to where you started.  Push the third cactus on the
        way back, and a yellow pacman will appear.  Get it, now kill player
        two.  Continue playing with player one.  Every time player one dies,
        get the yellow pacman with player two and kill player two
        immediately.  As long as you keep getting the yellow pacman with
        player two, player one will never die.

        HINTS:

            LEVEL 1:    Run to the third fire hydrant, and when you get
                        there, jump over it and push it to the left.  This
                        will give you a blue hat that will make you
                        invulnerable to the little ghosts that fall from
                        planes.

            LEVEL 2:    Run to the third cactus, and push it to the left.
                        You will now be invulnerable for the entire level!

            LEVEL 3:    After getting your magic boots, push the third
                        cactus on the way back for a free life.

        -Jump on the roof of ghost's car to escape.
    
        -Only use powerpills when ghosts are in range, or else it is wasted.

        -When you reach the breaktime sign, jump when you are about 1 inch
         away, for a bonus (depending how high you are when the level ends)

    PANZA KICK BOXING:

        low leg kick is useful for keeping your opponent out of range and on
        target for a round house followed by an upper cut.  The double
        backfist is also very poweful and often provides a knockout punch.

        then press the 'ESC' key so that your stats remain intact.

        bay for a further three minutes. A 5000 point bonus is given for
        completing a ship with grafgold key.  Complete the final ship with
        every grafgold key to be beamed aboard the pirate mothership for a

    PLAYER MANAGER:

        1.  Buy a few young, cheap players and keep them in the squad for a

            should have no trouble selling them for a huge profit. 

        2.  Only buy players with very high agility ratings, as this effects
            all their other attributes. If agility is high (about 200),
            expect the player to become an excellent footballer, given a
            season or two.

        round on a secret course with you in control of the f-14 tomcat from
        afterburnner.  With no collision detection.  Do the same thing on
        course D and you will be in control of the super hang-on bike.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    POWERDROME:

        Here are some tips on the various tracks:

            Oval:   The secret with this track is to use as much afterburner
                    as possible, but without blowing up your engines.  Keep
                    your eye on the temperature gauge.  This track is fairly
                    wide, so switch the centering field OFF and pick up
                    speed.  Go around as fast as you can.

            Antacorp: A difficult track.  Turn the centering field up to
                    four or five, which will put you in the middle of the
                    course.  When you go through the underground chicane,
                    hold down the right shift key.  This will take you
                    through the vertical scanner without slowing down; then
                    straighten.

            Clortek: Shortly after the start line, you will encounter a
                    trench.  Don't waste your time flying through it; just
                    go over it.  When you reach the pressure gate, which is
                    around half way, don't slow down.  If you're going to
                    crash into it then slow down.  Hopefully this won't
                    occur, but in this instance it's no use fighting the
                    consequences.  When you come out of the exit, switch
                    the afterbunrers on.  Go for speed on this next stretch.

            Otyaka: It's main section's underground, very dark and at first
                    quite difficult.  The track careers from left to right
                    so turn the centering on at around level five.  Once you
                    emerge into the open, you'll come across a nasty right
                    hand hairpin, so hold down the centering key again.
                    This section takes some practice.

            Banzal: So named because it really is the hardest track.  Crank
                    the centering up as much as possible but reduce it down
                    to six if feasible and necessary.  You'll encounter the
                    same kind of underground dip as on the Otyaka course, so
                    use the same tactics.  If you get through this you are
                    GOOD.

            Apocalypt: This section has an alarmingly tight hairpin situated
                    three corners from the start.  Take it using centring
                    mode.  While underground you will go through a loop de
                    loop.  You get through this using gentle movements of
                    the mouse, with centring set around six.  This should
                    see you right.

            Estoria: Back into sunny climes and a fairly wide track.  Bomb
                    around the course with a low centring setting or none at
                    all.

    POWERMONGER:

        Instruct your captain to invent something, pause the game, put the
        game speed up to full, and wait a couple of minutes.  Now unpause
        the game, the captain will have kept inventing during the pause!

        When you wish to invent in double quick time, click invent and
        when your men leave, click on it again.  This often makes a
        catapult almost immediately, but this cheat only works once on
        each island.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    PREHISTORIK:

        After killing the strange turtle-like creature on the first level,
        you should come to a screen with two carnivorous fish bouncing up
        and down in the water, along with four banks.  To get to the secret
        room don't jump over the first well.  Instead jump inside it and
        fall down into the secret room!

        Later on the first level, look out for a ladder near some water
        which leads up to a platform containing an egg.  Climb the ladder
        and take the egg, then go to the left into the water to find the
        submarine room.

        There is also a way to find some hidden extra food.  Go to the
        third screen of level three and jump forward hitting empty space.
        The hidden food should now appear.

    *PUTTY: (Keith Krellwitz)

        On the high score screen after the games is over (you don't need a
        high score), type "HEADLIKEAHOLE" and press the 'ENTER' key on the
        keypad.  Use 'F1-F10' to skip levels.  This also gives you infinite
        lives.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    PUZZNIC:

        When playing the game, press the 'SPACE BAR' to bring up the retry
        screen, but don't release the 'SPACEBAR'.  All the time that it is
        held down the game will be paused and you can work out what to do
        without having to rush.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    QUADRALIEN:

                                (LEVEL CODES)

                        LEVEL 2_________________"170961"
                        LEVEL 3_________________"010655"
                        CORE  4_________________"610169"

        Tips:  Once in the core, you can't quit.  So choose droids with
        good lasers, Jack and Spud for example.  The Quadralien mother is
        made up of 4 separate pieces grouped together and surrounded by
        Earthling boxes.  The mother can only be destroyed by blowing up
        each box from a different direction.  From the starting point there
        are three exits:  north, east, and west.  Go east and destroy the
        first box, return to the starting point, and go north to destroy
        the second box.  You will now have both droids to blow the
        remaining boxes.  Go west through the one-way force field, and get
        the other.  Don't forget to keep recharging.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    *RAINBOW ISLANDS:

        Collecting all of the gems in the correct order of color (from left
        to right on the gem counter - RED, ORANGE, YELLOW, GREEN, LIGHT
        BLUE, DARK BLUE, and MAUVE) not only awards you the life and Bonus
        Gem, it also grants you access to a magical secret room.  When you
        reach the end of the level, a silver door appears.  You don't have
        to fight the Boss.

        On the fifth island you'll find a box in the secret room which you
        should collect.  There's also a gate with a '7' on it, leading to
        island 7.

        Even more useful is how to create any color gem.  The screen is
        split into several invisible vertical stripes of color.  When a gem
        falls, its color is determined by the `color' of the area into which
        it fell.  Now all you have to do is guage ca refully where the dead
        enemy will fall to create the gem color of your choice.

        Type one of the following on the title screen, while the rainbow is
        cycling through colors:

            "BLRBJSBJ"_____________________________Permanent fast shoes.
            "RJSBJSBR"________________________Permanent double rainbows.
            "SSSLLRRS"__________________________Permanent fast rainbows.
            "BJBJBJRS"___________________________________________Hint a.
            "LJLSLBLS"___________________________________________Hint b.
            "LBSJRLJL"_______________________Continue after island five.
            "RRLLBBJS"_______________All hidden food becomes money bags.
            "RRRRSBSJ"____________________Does both of the previous two.
            "SRBJSLSB"____________________Gives you 100 million counter.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    RALLY CROSS CHALLENGE:

        On the fifth track, drive around until you reach the wooden level
        crossing.  Turn the car 90 degrees and drive down the track at full

        race points.  When the game starts, follow the railroad tracks and

        cheat this game.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    SENSIBLE SOCCER:

        To score off a corner every time, kick the ball towards the goalie.
        When a forward gets hold of it, kick it across the goal mouth and
        use after-touch to bend it into the net.  The computer never quite
        manages to work out what is going on until it is too late.  When
        your match appears next on the fixtures screen, for example
        England (You) v Germany (The Opposition), instead of choosing next
        match, click on Exit.  Now choose friendly from the main menu and
        choose Germany as your team.  Go to the Team/Formations Screen and
        get all the German star players on the bench, put the forward in
        goal, and generally mess about with the original team selection.
        Now start to play the game, but escape from it as soon as it begins.
        Return to the League/Cup games and View Opposition (Germany).  Your
        opponents team will still be mucked up.  Using this cheat you
        should be able to win every match.

        This cheat will allow you to play the game in slow motion (aka Kick
        Off 2).  What you have to do is play a match and then make a
        substitution.  Then when the player is walking off, press the 'ESC'
        key and you will quit the game.  Start another match and you should
        notice that everything plays at slow speed, even the timer!  To
        return to normal, make another substitution, but let it carry
        through.

        Go left to where the bad guy has a guy trapped in a force field.
        Quickly hit him a couple of times to kill him and free the lower
        guy.  He will then tell you the position of a switch (upper or
        lower) for later in the game.  Now go left and down the rope to
        the swamp.  Go left until you get to the building.  Enter the
        building, go left and pick up the jug.  Now go back to where you
        started the game.  From here go right and through the spear
        throwing dudes.  Go up and kill the guy who is throwing the green
        puddle things at you.  Pick up the axe he drops.  Now go left and
        fall from the ledge.  Go right to the rock that is by itself and
        you can see a little grass spot on the ground.  Jump on this like
        4-5 times and it will fall through.  Go down the steps and you are
        in the crystal cavern.  Go left, at the bridge a guy will start
        running left.  Chase him and he will take you to a bridge that is
        being mechanically shortened.  Jump and shoot the dude thats
        cranking the bridge(3 or so shots with the axe).  Now break the
        door at the other side of the bridge with your ball & chain.  Go
        up the first chandelier.  Go left and hit the correct switch.
        Now go down and kill the guards and go right.  Get the key and go
        left, you will get caught and they throw you in jail.  USE THE 'O'

        down the door with ball & chain.  Kill the guard.  go up the rope
        (faster than the prisoner) and kill the guard at the upper left
        and then go back down the rope to get the key he dropped.  Now go
        up the rope and go left at the first chance you get.  Use 1 of the
        keys and free the prisoner.  Go to the top of the rope and go left
        and get the ring.  Now if you go right the prisoners get killed.
        Give the ring to the old man who lost it, but he still wants a
        parchment before he will teach you a spell.  The other key is for
        the locked door in the first building (the inn where you got the

        credit, it says 1, start tapping the '1' and '2' keys alternately,
        all the way through the change disk prompt until both men fall from
        the sky.  This gives you infinite lives.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    *SHINOBI:

        Pause the game and type "LARSXVIII" for infinite credits or hold the
        LEFT MOUSE BUTTON, then type "LARSXVIII" for invincibility.  Press
        'Q' while game is paused, for music menu.
        
        On the helicopter boss pause the game and type
        "HELICOPTERTOOTOUGHFORME".  Then die and you will then go to level
        3 (if you have another life left).

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    SHOCKWAVE:

        A few hints and tips follow on how each of the four zones (armys,
        factorys, mines and rigs) effect the game:

        MINES - Each time a mine is purchased the income you receive for
                each time pass doubles.

        FACTORYS -  The more factorys you have the faster more weapons
                    are produced, these are essential.

        RIGS -  These supply you with the fuel for each mission run.  The
                more rigs you have the greater the amount of fuel you
                receive for each time pass.

        ARMYS - For every army unit you own, the enemy slows down.  You
                have one army unit, for each four time passes that occur
                the enemy won't move for one time pass.  If more than 50%
                of the sector is occupied by the enemy then you will lose
                one of your assests for each time pass that occurs.  The
                best solution is when 30% of the sector is occupied go an
                attack the enemy.

    SIDEARMS:

        During play, hit the 'CAPS LOCK' and type "FTBOK".  Use the

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    SIDEWINDER:

        If you look on disk 2, you will see a screen editor program.  You
        can access a specific level by pressing the appropriate function
        key.  You can save the changes by holding down both mouse buttons.
        You should back up disk 2 first, since the changes are permanent.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    *SILKWORM:

        On the options screen, type "SCRAP 28" for infinite lives.  Press
        '0'-'1' on the keypad to select levels.  On early versions press
        "HELP" and fire together to activate the cheat.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    SIMULCRA:
    
        THE MOTHERSHIP: It follows you around generating meanies and can
                        take many hits.  Ram rather than shoot.

        HOMING WEAPONS: Retreat as fast as possible then shot them.  Most
                        homing weapons have a limited range and can be out
                        run.

        BLITZKRIEG:     The best attack is a fast one.  Attack a generator
                        by flying along power barriers at full speed.
                        Learn to recognise the edge barriers.  Barriers you
                        can shut down never merge with the edge, and nearly
                        always lead to a generator.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    SIM CITY:

        When the title screen appears, hold down the 'SHIFT' key and type
        "FUND".  This gives you an extra 10,000 smackers.  It also causes an
        earthquake every tenth time you do it, so do it before you start
        your city.

        Another tip is to set the citizen's taxes to 0%.  Then just before
        tax collection (December or November if playing at fast speed)
        quickly set the taxes up to 20%.  Then after you collect taxes, put
        it back down to 0%.  This way the citizens think they are not
        paying any taxes.

        You can build land on water.  Find a straight (horizontal or
        vertical), stretch of coastline and string a powerline along it.
        Next, move one square over, out into the water and string another
        powerline parallel to the first.  Repeat as many times as you want.
        Then just bulldoze all the excess powerlines and you can build on
        the new land.  To make land you simply make a 3 lane highway across
        any water source.  When you make a road by putting 3 sections of
        road on top of three section of road on top of three sections of
        road (3 by 3) you make 1 section of land in the middle.
