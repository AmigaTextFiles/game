INTRODUCTION
------------

TV*TEXT  Professional  has  been designed to run properly under all versions
the Amiga's operating system.  This note deals with the minor differences in
operating the program with Version 2.0 of AmigaDos.

USING COLORFONTS
----------------

In  order  to  use  ColorFonts  with  AmigaDos versions prior to 2.0, it was
necessary  to  run the ColorText program included with this program prior to
running  TV*TEXT Professional.  As AmigaDos 2.0 directly supports the use of
ColorFonts, this is no longer necessary.

Although  no  harm  is  likely  to  occur,  you should NOT run the ColorText
program  provided  on  this  disk or any similar program which may have been
provided  as  part  of a font disk or other graphics program disk when using
AmigaDos 2.0.

FUNCTION KEYS AND COMMODITIES
-----------------------------

TV*TEXT  Professional  permits you to use the function keys on your keyboard
to facilitate the selection of Render Preferences. 

Workbench  2.0  includes  the  Commodities  Utility which permits you to run
certain utility programs through the use of function keys.

If  a  Commodities Utility uses the same function keys as TV*TEXT Pro and if
that  utility is enabled, TV*TEXT Pro will not respond to that function key.

You can ensure that there is no conflict by using qualifier keys on all your
Commodities  function  key  assignments or by disabling the commodities when
running  TV*TEXT  Professional.    See  your  Amiga  manual   for additional
information on Commodities.

OVERSCAN
--------

AmigaDos  2.0  now supports overscan screens in a manner which is compatible
with TV*TEXT Professional. 

Under 2.0 the system overscan screen dimensions are set through the Overscan
Preference editor.

Unfortunately, the many possible combinations of screen modes, overscan, and
scrolling  screens can make it difficult to determine the actual screen size
TV*TEXT Professional will use.

Basically, you have two options:

   1. Let TV*TEXT Professional determine its screen size by setting
      Overscan Preference sizes to their minimum.
 
   2. Always select NONE in TV*TEXT Professional's Screen Format
      requester and set Overscan Preferences to the desired TV*TEXT
      Professional screen size.

There  is  actually  a  third  option  possible of both setting the overscan
preferences  and  selecting  Medium  or  Maximum from the TV*TEXT Pro Screen
Format  requester  (or  in  tooltypes).    See   the   OVERSCAN AND MOREROWS
discussion  in the Read.Me note for how TV*TEXT Pro determines its screen in
this case.

We recommend using one of the two options described here for simplicity.

OVERSCAN DETERMINED BY TV*TEXT PRO
----------------------------------

If  you  set  your  overscan  sizes  to minimum using the WorkBench Overscan
editor,  then the degree of overscan in your TV*TEXT Professional screens is
determined  soley by your choice of an overscan mode in TV*Text Pro's Screen
Format requester (or tooltypes).  This requester appears at program startup,
or when you select Screen Format from the Project menu.

The NTSC Screen sizes when Overscan Preferences set to minimum sizes:

       Mode         None                Medium                 Maximum
  Lo Res NoLace   320 x 200            336 x 222              352 x 240
  Lo Res I'Lace   320 x 400            336 x 444              352 x 480
  Hi Res NoLace   640 x 200            672 x 222              704 x 240
  Hi Res I'Lace   640 x 400            672 x 444              704 x 480

To set your overscan size preferences to minimum:

1. Open the Overscan preference editor on Workbench.

2. Click on "Edit Text Overscan..."

3. Using the "handles" on the box, size the box as small as possible
   and center it on your screen.

4. Press "Enter" on your keyboard to keep the change.

5. Click on the "Edit Standard Overscan..." and repeat steps 3 & 4
   for the box that appears.

6. At this point this preference editor should display 640 x 200 (NTSC)
   for Regular Text Size, Text Overscan, and Standard Overscan.

7. Click Save to make the changes permanent.  Click Use to make them
   effective for this current session only.

OVERSCAN DETERMINED BY OVERSCAN PREFERENCES
-------------------------------------------

You  can  use  the  settings  of the Workbench Overscan Preference editor to
determine  the  size  of  a TV*TEXT Professional screen if you always select
NONE  from  the  TV*TEXT  Pro's Screen Format requester.  To set your screen
size:

1.  Open the Overscan preference on Workbench.

2.  Click "Edit Standard Overscan..."

3.  Use the "handles" to set the size of the screen you wish 
    TV*TEXT Pro to use.

4.  Press "Enter" on your keyboard to keep the change.

5.  This will return you to the preference editor.  The size of
    a HiRes NoLace screen is indicated in the "Standard Overscan:" 
    field as width x height.  These numbers apply to the Hi-Res,
    NoLace screen mode. To determine the screen dimensions for
    other TV*TEXT Pro screen modes, halve the width figure for Lo-Res
    screens double the height figure for LACE (interlaced) screens.

Example:

   Standard Overscan Size:  704 x 240

   TV*TEXT PRO Mode                Screen Size
    Lo Res No Lace                  352 x 240
    Lo Res Lace                     352 x 480
    Hi Res No Lace                  704 x 240
    Hi Res Lace                     704 x 480

OVERSCAN SCREEN POSITIONING
---------------------------

Under  AmigaDos  2.0  you  use  the  Overscan Preference editor to center or
otherwise  position  your display.  If you are using Overscan Preferences to
set  your  TV*TEXT Pro screen size, it should not be necessary to reposition
your  screen;  however,  if  you  choose anything other than NONE in TV*TEXT
Professional's  Screen  Format  requester,  it might be necessary for you to
adjust  your screen's position as described in the Read.Me note also on this
disk.    The  procedure, described under SCREEN POSITIONING AND OVERSCAN, is
the  same  except  for the fact that with 2.0 you will be using the Overscan
Preference  editor to adjust the positioning.  In addition there is only one
screen  depth  gadget  in  version  2.0 screens.  Just make sure it is fully
visible.
