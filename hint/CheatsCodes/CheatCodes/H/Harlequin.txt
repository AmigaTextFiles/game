        Guide the Harlequin to the jigsaw puzzle section whilst carrying
        the space hopper.  When you fall from the kite, select the space
        hopper and jump up to the lower of the two platforms above you.
        Disengage the space hopper and jump across to the other platform,
        then leap over the low wall.  When you land, keep on firing to see
        where the ground is and move across to the point where you're
        walking on air.  Run left until you cannot go further, jump up and
        you'll hit an invisible warp.  You'll be prompted to insert disk 1,
        and now you can watch the end sequence.
