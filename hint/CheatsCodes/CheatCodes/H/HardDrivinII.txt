        Select manual gears, and then press 'N' during the game when you
        reach top speed.  You will now zoom around on the circuit. (Also
        works on Hard Drivin' I.)

        At the start, turn the car around 180 degrees.  The display should
        now show the "wrong direction" message.  Head off under the bridge
        until you get to a split in the road.  Take the right hand branch
        and keep going until you reach a checkpoint.  Go through and turn
        the car through 180 degrees until your heading the other way.  Go
        back through the checkpoint in the right direction and you should
        hear a ping.  Keep going to the finish and once under the bridge
        let the clock run down to zero.  You should now get a message
        saying that you've qualified for the race. (Also works on Hard
        Drivin' I.)
