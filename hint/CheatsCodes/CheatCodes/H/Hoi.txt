        On the level access screen, place the lvl mouse pointer in the far
        bottom right of the green quarter screen.  The bottom L must be
        positioned in the corner with pixel perfect precision (two pixels on
        the pointer will be hanging over the edge to the right).  Click the
        LEFT MOUSE BUTTON, then shift the lvl mouse pointer to the very top
        left of the screen (as far as you can physically ove the mouse to
        the top left) and click the LEFT MOUSE BUTTON again.  You should now
        have access to the first four levels.
