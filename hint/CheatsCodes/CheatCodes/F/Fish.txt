                                  Part 1
                                 --------

  Tell Rod to make the coffee and then get the tapes from the bin, the tape bin
can be found in the cupboard in the secondary control room. Set the amplifier
fader in the control room to a suitable level and clean the tape heads with the
cleaner. Play the tapes in the player and the producer will storm in and sing
the combination to the cabinet in his office. Get what you find inside it and
you've solved the first part of Fish.



                            Part 2 - The Abbey
                           --------------------

  Get dressed and pick up the torch from the rubbish in the cab. Head east
until you get to the Abbey and find your way to the catacombs.
  Open the sarcophagus lid and find the ceremonial cord. Go back up to the
ruined transepts and turn off your torch . Drag the pew past the hippier until
it`s beneath the arch; you can climb this by standing on the pew. Tie the cord
and collect the gargoyle. Put it in its rightful place. Get the grommet from
the chalice to complete part 2. You may have to do this several times thanks to
hippier interference.



                        Part 3 - Exploding Parrots
                       ----------------------------

  Timing is critical in this part so don`t waste any time. Go south east to the
smithy and free the budgie. Return to Mickie (mind the bird) and get the disc
from the stump when he leaves. Return to the smithy and get the tools, gloves
and mould. Wear the gloves and place the disc in the crucible. Hold it in the
fire with tongs and pour it in the mould when it melts. Take this to the cool
glade avoiding Mickey and anywhere wet. Let it cool for a few turns. When this
is done smash the mould with a hammer and lo and behold HYDROPOLIS!
