          GrandPrix Patch v2.20 by Multiplex of Chrome
          --------------------------------------------

        
        Introduction
        ------------

        This patch is freeware. It has nothing to do with Microprose
        nor F1GP Editor by Oliver Roberts. To use this patch you
        need the original Formula One Grand Prix written by 
        Geoff Crammond. Thanks for ReqTools go to Nico François and
        for many hours (>1000h for sure!) beta-testing to Tero
        Savolainen.


        Requirements
        ------------

        Over 1MB memory and faster Amiga recommended. Please note that
        when you're racing with this patch, you need 100KB more memory
        than normally. This is mainly required for ReqTools to function
        properly.


        How to use
        ----------

        At first run GPPatch background by writing 
        "run GPPatch" on your cli or shell window.
        Then start F1GP normally from shell or Workbench.
        If you're running F1GP from disks then add
        the command in the beginning of your F1GP-disk's
        startup-sequence.
        Also you must have reqtools.library (KS1.3 & KS2.0+ versions
        supplied) installed.
