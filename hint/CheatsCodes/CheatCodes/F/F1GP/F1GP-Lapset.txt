         F1GP-LapSet V1.00 - Copyright (c) Oliver Roberts 1994


F1GP-LapSet is a short utility to enable you to print out lap records and
setups from Formula One Grand Prix or World Circuit without having to
write them down manually everytime they change!  The records will be
written to a file in a similar format to how they are displayed in the
F1GP Hall of Fame on the Internet (use the -f option to print out only
the fastest lap at each circuit).

F1GP-LapSet is a CLI-only program.  Run it with no arguments at a CLI
prompt to find out the valid options.  You must specify a "lap record"
file and a "current car setups" file.  These are saved out from the
game.

If you don't specify a outputfile then the output will be saved in
"ram:F1GP-LapSet.txt".

    so already).
