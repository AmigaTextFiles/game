		Replacement Startup for Formula One Grand Prix
		==============================================

I recently bought Microprose's F1GP for my Amiga, and while being very
pleased with it, I felt that the startup routines could be better. In
particular, I wanted the game to open an NTSC display (rather than a PAL
one with that annoying black area at the bottom of the screen), and I did
not like the intro bit, which appears corrupted on my machine.

As a result of this, I wrote this program to replace the small
"Formula One Grand Prix" program that starts the game. This replacement
requires KickStart 2.04 or higher, an Amiga capable of producing an NTSC
display (for PAL machines, this means at least a Fat Agnus chip (ie A600,
A1200, A3000, A4000, and late model A500, A1500 and A2000s)) and assumes
that it is running off a hard drive. On startup "f1gp_disk_#n:" (where
n = 1 to 4) is assigned to the current directory (so the file "s:gp.dat"
is no longer needed), and the main file "f1gp" executed. OpenScreen() is
patched to ensure that the game opens an NTSC screen. This patch is removed
when the game is quit.

To use, replace the original "Formula One Grand Prix" file with this one.
Do not change any other files. Make sure you have a backup of the original
installation. I make no guarantees as to whether this works on any
particular system. Use at your own risk. I have no connection with
Microprose, and Microprose do not in any way condone use of this program.
