@node "Intro" "Introduction"
 Welcome to the last public release of F1GP-Ed.  With this editor you can
 customize your copy of MicroProse's Formula One Grand Prix (or World
 Circuit) by designing cars, pit crews and helmets and by changing the way
 the computer drivers drive and respond, amongst other things.  The aim of
 F1GP-Ed is to allow users to make F1GP more realistic, by using an
 easy-to-use user interface.

 I have supplied an example datafile which will convert your copy of F1GP,
 so it plays like the real-life 1994 season at a more realistic speed!
 The lap-times churned out by the computer cars will be alot faster than
 before and much faster than in real life - the performance of your car is
 not modified.  It also contains my recent car setups and lap records.
 Please note that it may take a long time to get F1GP setup to be realistic
 - I have not had time to perfect the 1994 datafile!
@endnode

@node "Disclaimer" "Disclaimer"
 I cannot guarantee that every possible combination of the settings in
 F1GP-Ed will affect F1GP as intended.

 I cannot be held liable if this program causes your copy of Formula One
 Grand Prix / World Circuit to become corrupt, nor can I be blamed if this
 program causes any other problems with your system.  Any problems are
 entirely the user's responsibility.  If your binary becomes corrupt, then
 tough luck - don't go running to MicroProse for a new copy!  So:

 @{b}***** IMPORTANT *****@{ub}
 Please use a backup of the game, before you start altering the binary.
 Then you will have another copy of the game if it gets corrupted (ie power
 failure when saving).

 Any Amiga computer

 A copy of the original Formula One Grand Prix / World Circuit game by
 MicroProse - this must be version 1.02 (See the @{"F1GP Versions" link "F1GPVersions" 0} section).

 Disk based libraries that should be in the LIBS: drawer on you boot disk:
 (refers to your hard drive, Workbench disk or F1GP-Ed bootable disk)

 @{b}@{u}COMPATIBILITY@{ub}@{uu}

 F1GP-Ed has been tested on the following machines:
 A500, A500+, A600, A1000, A1200, A2000, A3000, A4000/030

 With the following kickstarts being put to test:
 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.04, 2.05, 3.0, 3.1

 A number of memory configurations, accelerators, HDs, etc, were also used.

 F1GP-Ed will work fine on all Kickstarts, but it works best with KS 3.0,
 as KS 3.0 includes various changes which F1GP-Ed takes advantage of.
 KS 1.x users may notice slight irregularities - this is due to the
 GadTools emulation.
@endnode

@node "Registration" "Registration"
 F1GP-Ed is SHAREWARE.  UK users are expected to send me at least 5 UK
 pounds (cheque or cash).  Non-UK users should send me a postal order
 (or something like that) for 5 pounds sterling (minimum).  If this
 is not viable then send me $10 US in notes, as a last resort.

 If you do this, you will become a registered F1GP-Ed user.  Registered
 users will get a personal keyfile which enables the `Timing' option
 in F1GP-Ed V2.02+ and allows use of future versions (unusable without
 a keyfile), and the latest version of F1GP-Ed, of course.

 Users with internet access will get their keyfile and any new updates
 for F1GP-Ed via e-mail, if preferred.  Alternatively, send a disk
 and enough money/stamps to cover return postage along with your
 registration fee and I will send the disk back with your keyfile and
 the latest version of F1GP-Ed.  If you do not include return postage I
 will not be able to return the disk to you or you can send me a extra
 pound, which will cover the price of a disk and return postage.

 Try out the F1GP-Ed_Demo which is supplied with F1GP-Ed V2.04.  It allows
 you to see what the registered F1GP-Ed looks like and get a "feel" of the
 new GUI - all options are enabled, except any involving saving
 (AmigaGuide® on-line help isn't available in the demo either).

 The registered version of F1GP-Ed currently (at the time of writing this
 text) offers these improvements:

  * Change the timing in F1GP to PAL or NTSC
  * Allocation of the positions of the teams garages
  * Alteration of the points awarded to the top 10 finishers in
    championship races
  * Change all the sound samples used in the game
  * Output lap records and/or car setups to a text file, which can then
    then be printed
  * A lap record editor
  * A car setup editor
  * Alteration of external camera views
  * AmigaGuide® on-line help
  * Improved GUI which is font adaptive, more "colourful", easier to use,
    modular design allowing all windows to be open at once and has 5 more
    options in the Settings menu for more flexibility and new features.
  * The colour editors now allow you to click on the actual graphics
    (like a paint program, eg DPaint) as well as the descriptive names
  * Improved error checking in file handling and low memory situations

 There are some more features that will be added if/when I work out how to
 to implement them (they are "vapourware").  Here are some of the
 possibilities:

  * Preset the detail level to your choice
  * Reorder the schedule for the grand prix season
  * Alter the braking distance of the computer cars
  * Store all lap times of all cars
  * Display time margins on the F1GP game screen of the cars behind or
    in front of you (as in the PC version or Indy 500)
  * Change the frame rate for F1GP, so that users with more powerful
    Amigas can have smoother updates according to their CPU speed.
  * Track Editor (a bit unlikely, but may be possible)

 So if you want to see more features added, make sure you send me the
 registration fee.  Feel free to send me suggestions you might have, for
 future versions.

 Send the registration fee and a completed registration form (which can
 be found in the Registration.TXT file, or obtained from the initial
 requester in F1GP-Ed) to me at the following address:

@node "GettingStarted" "Getting Started"
 Installing F1GP-Ed is easy - just double-click on the "Install_F1GP-Ed"
 icon from Workbench.  All necessary files will be installed, including
 system libraries (only if no versions exist, or the existing versions
 are old).

 @{b}@{u}Starting from Workbench@{ub}@{uu}

 There are two ways of running F1GP-Ed from Workbench:

   (1) Double-click on the F1GP-Ed icon.  The default F1GP values will be
       used if no config file exists.  If a config file does exist and
       the "Autoload" feature is enabled, the datafile of your choice will
       loaded automatically.

   (2) Double-click on a F1GP-Ed datafile icon.  F1GP-Ed will be loaded
       and the selected datafile will be loaded automatically.

 @{b}@{u}Starting from the Shell@{ub}@{uu}

 Again there are two ways of running F1GP-Ed:

   (1) Type `F1GP-Ed' at the prompt to load F1GP-Ed the same way as the
       Workbench (1), mentioned above.

   (2) Type `F1GP-Ed <filename>' where <filename> is the datafile of your
       choice.  This file will then be loaded into F1GP-Ed.
@endnode

@node "QuickstartGuide" "Quickstart Guide"
 If you want to convert your copy of F1GP so that it uses the 1994.f1gp
 datafile supplied with F1GP-Ed, then here is all you need to do:

 o Load F1GP-Ed as in the the @{"above section" link "GettingStarted" 0}

 o Select @{"Load >> Datafile..." link "REF-ProjectMenu" 4} from the "File" menu

 o Select the "1994.f1gp" file and click on "Load"

 o Select @{"Save >> F1GP Binary..." link "REF-ProjectMenu" 6} from the "File" menu

 o If you have a hard drive then select the "f1gp" file in the relevant
   drawer, otherwise just put F1GP disk 2 (@{"versions A & B" link "F1GPVersions" 5}) or disk 1
   (@{"version C" link "F1GPVersions" 17} - change the drive from "f1gp_disk_#2:" to "f1gp_disk_#1:")
   in any drive and click on "Save"

 o Read the message and click on "OK"

 o When disk activity has finished, load F1GP in the usual way

 This will provide you with an updated version of F1GP - you can also
 customize many other features too by experimenting with F1GP-Ed.

@node "F1GPVersions" "F1GP Versions"
 I currently know of 3 different versions of F1GP.  Unfortunatly, they all
 have the same version number (1.02).  Here are the differences, sizes and
 locations of the "f1gp" binary file which is needed by F1GP-Ed:

 +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
 | (A) Formula One Grand Prix (4 disks)   -   Disk 2   -   @{b}582992@{ub} bytes  |
 |                                                                       |
 |      The original version which is hard-coded for PAL machines.  This |
 |      version has also been re-released on the PowerPlus budget label. |
 +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
 | (B) World Circuit (4 disks)            -   Disk 2   -   @{b}582780@{ub} bytes  |
 |                                                                       |
 |      US version of F1GP which is hard-coded for NTSC machines.  All   |
 |      occurences of "Formula One Grand Prix" text are replaced by      |
 |      "World Circuit".  Also, there is no manual selection screen as   |
 |      the English manual is assumed.  Same as (A) otherwise.           |
 +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
 | (C) Formula One Grand Prix (3 disks)   -   Disk 1   -   @{b}582988@{ub} bytes  |
 |                                                                       |
 |      This version of F1GP was bundled with the A600 Wild, Weird &     |
 |      Wicked pack, and hence the intro was omitted to save on disks.   |
 |      There are some minor changes in this version, but the only one   |
 |      I have pin-pointed is the screen position.  In (A) & (B) you     |
 |      have to set up the overscan preferences to a certain position,   |
 |      otherwise the left-hand side of the game screen would be         |
 |      *chopped* off, with a black border on the LHS of the screen.     |
 |      This problem seems to have been corrected in this version.       |
 |      Apart from that it's essentially the same as (A).  God knows why |
 |      the 2 keypad keys used by F1GP weren't remapped to keys that are |
 |      available on the A600 - that's MicroProse for you!               |
 +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

 F1GP-Ed will work on all versions mentioned above.  It may fail on pirate
 versions, so go and buy the original now if you have not already done so.
 Pirate versions will never be supported, intentionally.

 If you have a version of F1GP which is different to the above, please let
 me know so I can support it in F1GP-Ed.
@endnode

@node "F1GPSavedGames" "Notes on F1GP Saved Games"
 When saving a game from F1GP, these things are always saved, and will
 overwrite settings in the F1GP binary when loaded:

  * Current settings from the "Race Options" menu
  * Current car setups
  * Names of teams, engines and drivers

 Therefore you may experience problems if you save a game, alter the
 allocation of drivers to teams using the "Team Editor", and then load
 that same game.  If you make changes to any of the settings above they
 will always be replaced by the ones in the save game file.  All other
 settings in the binary should remain unchanged when loading games.

 An option to update save game files, with current F1GP binary settings,
 may be implemented in a future version of F1GP-Ed.
@endnode

@node "Problems" "Known Problems"
 Only one minor problem:

    Race Lap Records do not seem to be registered when playing the game as
    Driver #40.  This is weird, as the Qualifying Records work fine, so
    don't play as Driver #40, if you can help it.  This is a problem with
    F1GP (ie not F1GP-Ed).

@node "REF-TeamEditor" "Team Editor"
@toc "Reference"
 The Team Editor allows you to alter team settings much like you do in
 F1GP itself.  The difference is that this editor allows you to change
 relative team performances, car numbers, the number of teams to compete
 and more.

 There is a facility to copy or swap teams.  To do this select the one
 you want to copy/swap, then click the copy/swap button, then click on
 the second one, then click the copy/swap button again to perform the
 operation.

 You may use the left/right cursor keys to select the team when the main
 window is active.  Kickstart 1.x owners have to use the `6' and `7' keys
 instead.

 Now the descriptions of each gadget:

 @{b}Team Name@{ub}: Name of the selected team

    @{b}Engine@{ub}: Name of the team's engine.

        @{b}HP@{ub}: Horsepower setting for the team's cars.  This will determine
            how quickly computer controlled cars can accelerate.  Values
            between 0 and 1432 are accepted.  The higher the setting -
            the faster the car will accelerate.

  @{b}Driver A@{ub}: Use the slider to select a driver from the list of drivers
            specified by you in the @{"Driver Editor" link "REF-DriverEditor" 0}.  Legal values are
            0-40 (0 means that the car will not participate in any
            events).

  @{b}Driver B@{ub}: Select the second driver - as above.

 @{b}Global HP@{ub}: This will increase/decrease all the cars HP setting by 5.
                     You do this by clicking on the "+" or "-" gadget.

 @{b}Max Teams@{ub}: This determines how many of the teams will actually be used
            by F1GP.  You can select between 13 and 20 teams, but you
            must have at least 26 drivers allocated to your chosen teams.
            (default is 18 teams)
@endnode

@node "REF-DriverEditor" "Driver Editor"
@toc "Reference"
 The Driver Editor allows you to change driver names like you do in F1GP
 itself, but it also lets you specify whether a driver(s) should be
 selected automatically, and there qualifying and race performances. One of
 the good things about F1GP-Ed is that you can assign any driver to any of
 the teams.

 There is a facility to copy or swap drivers.  To do this select the one
 you want to copy/swap, then click the copy/swap button, then click on the
 second one, then click the copy/swap button again to perform the
 operation.

 You may use the up/down cursor keys to select the driver when the main
 window is active.  Kickstart 1.x owners have to use the `Y' and `U' keys
 instead.

 Now for the descriptions of the gadgets:

 @{b}Name@{ub}     : Name of the selected driver.

 @{b}Initially@{ub}: Allows you to determine if a driver should automatically be
 @{b}Selected@{ub}   selected when you load F1GP.  You must select at least one
            driver!

 @{b}Qual@{ub}     : How well a driver performs in Qualifying sessions.  This will
 @{b}Perform@{ub}    determine how fast the actual driver is (not taking the HP
            setting of the car into account).  Low values will ensure
            that the driver will driver reasonably well, and high values
            will result in the driver spinning off too often.  This also
            affects how quickly the driver accelerates.  Range: 0-255.
            This will not really affect starting positions if you
            skip the qualifying session - the HP values for the teams
            are used to calculate the grid positions in this case.

 @{b}Race@{ub}     : How well a driver performs in a Race.  Details as above.
 @{b}Perform@{ub}

 @{b}Global@{ub}   : This will increase/decrease all the cars Qual and Race
 @{b}Perform@{ub}    performances by 5.  You do this by clicking on the "+" or "-"
            gadget.

@node "REF-ColourEd" "Colour Editor"
@toc "Reference"
 The colour editors allow you to change the colours of the cars, helmets
 and pit crews.  There is a separate editor for each of the above, but
 each works in the same way:

 Select the part you would like to change from the list on the left of
 the screen, and then change it to the desired colour by clicking on the
 respective colour in the palette gadget.

 You can also change the colour of all major parts by clicking the 'ALL'
 button.

 The 'UNDO' button resets the colours to what they were when the colour
 editor was started.

 You can also tell the editor to Hilight the selected part, so you know
 where it is (there is a choice of 2 colours).  Turn it on and off using
 the appropriate gadget or click the right mouse button to toggle it.

 *** Keyboad Shortcuts ***
 The editor has shortcuts for selecting parts and colours.  The
 up/down cursor keys will select a part, and the left/right will select
 the colour.

 *** Car Editor Note ***
 You should be aware that the style of the car of the first team is
 different from all the others.  The first team has a car with a
 different nose design (ie McLaren style nose).

 *** Please Note ***
 It is best not to change most of the attributes which are marked with
 a question mark.  Feel free to change these, but they will generally
 make the color scheme look ridiculous.  Some of the unknown values may
 represent something in F1GP-Ed, but not necessarily in the game!

@node "REF-Options" "Options"
@toc "Reference"
 The options in this window allow you preset the options normally
 available in F1GP.  They are all described in the F1GP manual and
 documentation, except this one:

 @{b}Analog@{ub}  : Determines whether the you wish to use an Analog Joystick by
 @{b}Joystick@{ub}  default.  If you "check" this option, then you must enter the
           correct calibration figures for your joystick.  These are
           displayed when you calibrate it in F1GP.  If you do not enter
           the correct figures, then you will have to calibrate your
           joystick in F1GP as usual.

 (Note: the "Miles/Km" option has no effect on @{"version B" link "F1GPVersions" 10})

 The "Separate Qual/Race Setups" option is not available as it will
 automatically be altered when you load a car setup file into F1GP-Ed.
@endnode

@node "REF-Hacks" "Hacks"
@toc "Reference"
 This window contains a selection of hacks to make F1GP even better.

 @{b}Default@{ub} : This is the directory/volume that F1GP will use for save
 @{b}Dir@{ub}       games, etc.  The default is "DF0:".

 @{b}Quick@{ub}   : The number of laps to be run for a Quick Race.
 @{b}Race Laps@{ub}

 @{b}Select@{ub}  : This option tells F1GP to ask you to select the circuit you
 @{b}Quick@{ub}     wish to use for a Quick Race.
 @{b}Race@{ub}

 @{b}Use@{ub}     : Usually F1GP will use a separate HP value for your car (you
 @{b}Team@{ub}      can alter this with the "Player HP" option in the hacks
 @{b}Settings@{ub}  window).  This option tells F1GP to use the HP values from
           the value you have specified for your team.  This allows each
           player in a multiplayer game to have different HP values for
           their cars (I think).  Therefore, the "Player HP" value will
           be overrided by your team's "Engine HP".

 @{b}Skip@{ub}    : This option tells F1GP to go straight to the main menu after
 @{b}Startup@{ub}   you have entered the correct password.
 @{b}Menu@{ub}

 @{b}Driving@{ub} : Allows you to use all driving aids on all skill levels.
 @{b}Aid@{ub}
 @{b}Cheat@{ub}

 @{b}Wet Race@{ub}: Change the chance of a wet race (0% means no chance).
 @{b}Prob.@{ub}

 @{b}Damage@{ub}  : There are 5 different values which affect how easily you can
           damage your wings or be put out the race in different
           situations.  This also applies to the computer controlled cars.
           The lower the value the easier it will be to damage your car.
           Please note that two of these attributes affect the same thing
           so if you change one of these you should change the other or
           you may experience the magnetic wall sensation!
           (Values between 0 and 32767 are allowed)

 @{b}Keyboard:@{ub} There are 4 choices:

              A600: As the A600 does not have a numeric keypad you can now
                    use the "BackSpace" key to return to your cockpit
                    (instead of the "Home" key).  As yet, I have not
                    worked out how to remap the "Other Action Replay" key.

             A1200: If you play F1GP with the keyboard (some people do, you
         (Layout 1) know!), then you will have discovered that Commodore
                    changed the way the keyboard works.  F1GP will no
                    longer recognise that you are pressing 2 keys on the
                    same row.  So, this option will let you use the '2' key
                    for accelerating, the 'W' key for braking, the ':;' key
                    for steering left and the '@#' key for steering right.

             A1200: As Layout 1 except use these keys: L.Alt to steer left,
         (Layout 2) L.Amiga to steer right, R.Shift to accelerate and
                    R.Amiga to brake.

          Standard: As the name suggests, the default keys are used.

 @{b}Manual@{ub}  : If you have F1GP (ie not World Circuit), you will be aware that
           you have to select the language your manual is written in.
           This option tells F1GP to select the specified manual
           automatically or to allow you to select it as normal.
           (Note: This option has no effect on @{"version B" link "F1GPVersions" 10})

 @{b}Timing@{ub}  : This option is only relevant to F1GP users, and only really
           useful to PAL Amiga owners who use a utility (such as Degrader)
           to switch their machine into NTSC mode so the full screen is
           used when playing F1GP.  It allows you to change the timing
           according to whether you are running F1GP in PAL or NTSC screen
           mode.  If F1GP is run on a NTSC display the timing will be too
           fast.  So set the timing to correspond to the screen mode you
           use for F1GP - one exception is for owners of 68000 Amigas
           which are not accelerated, who may wish to leave the timing on
           PAL even when running in NTSC as F1GP will still run a bit
           slower than real time.
           (This option has no effect on @{"version B" link "F1GPVersions" 10})

           The following is a list of lap times measured in real time,
           based on a lap time of 1m 20sec as reported by the F1GP:
           (not very accurate, but it helps clarify the general idea)
              +-----------+---------+------------+-------------+
              | Processor | Display | PAL Timing | NTSC Timing |
              +-----------+---------+------------+-------------+
              |   68000   |  PAL    |  1m 30sec  |  1m 35sec   |
              |   68000   |  NTSC   |  1m 25sec  |  1m 30sec   |
              +-----------+---------+------------+-------------+
              |   68030   |  PAL    |  1m 20sec  |  1m 23sec   |
              |   68030   |  NTSC   |  1m 17sec  |  1m 20sec   |
              +-----------+---------+------------+-------------+

 @{b}Player@{ub}  : The acceleration of your car.  The higher, the faster you can
  @{b}HP@{ub}       go (normal HP is 716).  If you want the fastest possible car
           set your HP to 1432, and set your car up in F1GP to have
           no downforce and alter the gear ratios so that 6th gear has a
           value of 80.  This should let you travel around 270mph!
           (This value also affects the place you will qualify at, if you
            skip the qualifying session).

 @{b}Tyre@{ub}    : Increasing this value will make computer cars go faster along
  @{b}Grip@{ub}     straights and around corners without affecting HP settings.
           This allows the cars to make more challenges and brake later
           into the corners - this is NOT a real solution to the early
           braking techniques employed by computer cars, but it is the
           next best thing!

 @{b}Level@{ub}   : The text in the level button is what will appear instead of
 @{b}Button@{ub}    the "1991 Levels" button on the "Race Options" menu in F1GP.

@{b}V2.04 - 26 November 1994@{ub}

Bug fix: V2.03 failed to work with the A600 WWW version of F1GP, due to me
         accidently pressing the delete key while editting the source code!
         This update will definitely work with the the A600 WWW version.
============================================================================
@{b}V2.03 - 19 November 1994@{ub} (Update of V2.02 & bug fixes from V2.10-V2.21)

Added support for the A600 WWW version of F1GP.

Added a couple of other non-F1GP-Ed things from the registered version (ie
AmigaGuide® documenation, Installer script & Version string)

@{i}Bug fixes:@{ui} Minor bug in the default team names: Team 10 was named as
           "Sorrell" instead of "Masuka Realm".

           Slight mistake in the PAL Timing code, the mistake did not seem
           to cause any problems, but I have corrected it anyway.

           Major bug when saving an engine sample.  If the sample was less
           than 21160 bytes, F1GP-Ed would probably corrupt the memory,
           resulting in "Software Failures".

           The graphics data for the colour editors had a few minor errors -
           corrected them.

           Slight bug in the damage, analog stats and tyre grip gadgets
           if you entered a value over 65535.  The value should have been
           decreased to the maximum, but I made a slight mistake in the
           source code.

           Whoops... the maximum damage should have been 32767.
============================================================================
@{b}V2.02 - 27 July 1994@{ub}

Added an option to adjust the timing according to whether PAL or NTSC is being
used.

Added a keyfile processor which loads in relevant information about the
registered user and enables the `Timing' option.

From now on, new versions will only be available to registered users.
============================================================================
@{b}V2.00 - 23 June 1994@{ub}

As there are so many changes I decided to go straight onto V2.00. Well here
goes... there are alot of changes:

The crowd no longer disappears if you use the default data.

When writing to the binary, F1GP-Ed will assign no drivers to any teams that
will not be used (ie excluded by Max Teams setting).  This will ensure that no
cars will go extra slow, but means that the drivers that were erased cannot be
read back from the binary.

Added memory check routines to try and prevent F1GP-Ed crashing in low memory
conditions.

Added an option to the configuration menu to allow the user to disable the
quit requester.

Added an UNDO button to the colour editor.

Removed the Read and Write cycle gadgets as they have become pretty pointless
at the moment as there are only 2 ways you can read and write (I aimed to
write to memory also).  Extra items added to the file menu to cope with these
changes.

Renamed the prefs menu to configuration menu, due to possible confusions
between F1GP Preferences and prefs.

Splitted the F1GP Preferences into 2 separate windows, due to lack of space.

Added a new F1GP Preferences menu to access these 2 windows and provide
options to reset the options and hacks to normal.

Added an option to save a new engine sound sample to the F1GP binary.

Added alot of new features in the new Hacks section of Preferences.  Briefly
these are: Manual selection, driver aid cheat, damage, skip menus, use team
settings, choose quick race, wet race probability, tyre grip, player HP and
additional A1200 keyboard layout.

Changed the Max HP to 1432 (logically correct, but not fully tested!)

All these changes resulted in a new format for the F1GP-Ed Datafile.  Old
format still recognized though.

Major rewrite of file handling routines, resulting in more reliable and faster
saves, but a slight increase in the code size for these.

F1GP-Ed should now use less stack - although this is not important as F1GP-Ed
ues and infinite stack (that is until you run out of memory!)

A few other cosmetic changes also, including some graphics.
============================================================================
@{b}V1.02 - 30 May 1994@{ub}

Discovered that F1GP-Ed did not work with World Circuit, so support is now
included.  Also added another confirmation requester to make sure users don't
overwrite the wrong files.  Altered the colour editor palette slightly.

F1GP-Ed is now compiled as registerized, which means it is more efficient and
slightly faster.
============================================================================
@{b}V1.01 - 23 May 1994@{ub}

Added dynamic stack allocation, so that the stack would never overflow causing
requesters to crash.
============================================================================
@{b}V1.00 - 22 May 1994@{ub}

First public release of F1GP-Ed.  Found out how to use the whole 20 teams -
users can now have between 13-20 teams.  A few cosmetic changes.  Put the
minimum performance settings back to 0 again, and reset the maximum HP to
1400, as higher values caused problems.  Added a "Save Icons" feature, which
saves an icon with datafiles.  Added an Iconify (Zoom) gadget to the F1GP-Ed
window (KS 2.0+).

@{i}Bug Fixes:@{ui} The Analog Joystick setting did not initialize properly in the
           bin.  It should do now.

           Sorted out a few bugs in the keyboard routines for the GUI.

           Imposed a limit of a minimum of 26 drivers, as F1GP crashes
           if there are less.

           Removed the necessity of having to have a stack of 8192, F1GP-Ed
           now works fine on the default stack size (4096).

           Changed the keyboard controls for the A1200 again, as they
           still did not work 100% (due to C='s redesign of the keyboard
           matrix on the A1200).

           Serious bug in the load prefs routine - if autoload was not
           enabled, the car setups did not initialize - meaning that all
           the setup values (ie wings, gears) were 0, causing F1GP to
           completely mess up!

           Bug in the calls to draw the Bevel boxes, worked fine in early
           versions - but now the call is completly legal.

           Slight bug when first loading a file with no drivers in team 1,
           now fixed.
============================================================================
@{b}V0.4 Beta - 6 May 1994@{ub}

Changed the the max HP values to 2131 - this is the maximum F1GP can cope
with. The minimum performance value has changed from 0 to 1, due to a few
problems the 0 causes.

Added Global Performance buttons.

Added a new prefs menu option which allows the user to preset the: default
dir, fast windows, animations, analogue joystick attributes and all the other
major options in the Help/Game/Race options menus in F1GP.  You can now select
the keyboard layout from 3 presets.

@{i}Bug Fixes:@{ui} Found out why the busy pointer was not appearing on pre-2.0
           machines.  There is a bug in KS1.2/1.3 - F1GP-Ed now relizes
           this and the busy pointer is OK.

           Removed the problem of having to have driver #5 selected
           (English version).  They is now total control over what drivers
           are selected.
============================================================================
@{b}V0.3 Beta - 21 April 1994@{ub}

Added Support for loading car setups into datafiles and an 'ALL' button in the
Colour Editors.  Alot of the code was also optimized.  The way the graphics
data is stored has now changed, saving 40K of memory which was previously
wasted!  Have now added keyboard shortcuts.  Also added an option to change
the level button and reset to default options.

@{i}Bug Fixes:@{ui} No longer assumes topaz font is being used - layout adjusted
           accordingly.

           Failed to load the Autoload file specified in Prefs - fixed.

           File routines for Kickstart 1.x users now work 100% of the time.

           When using reqtools all the Confirmation requesters seemed to
           work (except when they caused the machine to lock!), but
           theorectically, whichever option the user clicked - it should
           always have selected Cancel - but it didn't (very strange!).
           I think this is why the machine crashed sometimes when quitting,
           saving, etc - should now be fixed.

           Fixed the current colour indicator under 1.x and also the
           'Selected on startup' checkbox is now displayed as well as
           possible under 1.x (there must be a bug in gadtools13.library)
============================================================================
@{b}V0.21 Beta - 18 April 1994@{ub}

The editor now removes protection from the "f1gp" file automatically, removing
the need to use the protect command from AmigaDOS.
============================================================================
@{b}V0.2 Beta - 17 April 1994@{ub}

First release of the Editor - for beta testers only. Added reqtools support to
enable 1.x users to load and save.  2.0+ users can still use asl.library if
they want.
============================================================================
@{b}V0.1 Beta - 15 April 1994@{ub}

This version was not released, as it didn't support KS 1.x.
