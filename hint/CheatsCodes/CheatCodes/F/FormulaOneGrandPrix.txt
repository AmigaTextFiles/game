        Go to the pits, escape from the game and go to accelerate time.
        This should now finish the grand prix in pole position.  It might be
        that you have to do this on the last lap.

        Slip into the pits after your first lap and then simultaneously
        hold down the keys that make up the word "PALIR" and press the fire
        button.  Not only will you be unable to crash but the game will not
        react as though you have pressed 'F4'.

        Race a non-championship race and keep driving untill the last lap.
        Then enter the pits and drive to your pit-crew.  Wait for the
        message "Race over".  This way you will always win the race.
