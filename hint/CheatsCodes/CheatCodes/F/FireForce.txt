        Start the game as normal with just one bazooka shell.  Arm the 
        weapon, press and hold the fire button.  Now press 'ESC'.  Go to
        the armory and get rid of all your rockets.  Now you can start the
        mission with infinite supply of bazooka shells.  The same applies to
        all weapons as well.
