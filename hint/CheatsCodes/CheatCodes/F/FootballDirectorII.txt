  Here's a way of starting the game with lotsa' money.
  Copy the game onto another disk - files are going to be changed so don't
  use the original.  Boot up the copy as normal, clicking on the `FD II'
  and `BOOT.BAS' icons as they appear.
  Enter the game as normal.  When it's up and running, select the `QUIT'
  option from the Main selection of the pull down menu.  A CLI window now
  appears.  Type "list" to list the `FOOT.BAS' part of the game.
  Using the cursor keys, edit the program lines 1514 and 2547 to read as
  follows :
  1514 NEXT
  NW=150+INT(RND*200)
  NW=INT(NW/AP)
  NV=200+INT(RND*300)
  NV=INT(NV/AP)
  AI=5000000pound sign+INT(RND*(500000pound sign/AP))
  NF=(5000+INT(RND*3000))/AP
  NP=INT(NP+NA+NF)
  GOTO 332
  2547 GOSUB 2548
  IF RA=9 AND AI>300000pound sign OR AI>1500000pound sign THEN ]2547
  GOTO 2548
  ]2547: RA=INT(AI/5000)
  PRINT TAB(5);
  PA5
  PRINT "DIRECTORS WITHDRAW";
  PA1         "
  PRINT TAB(30);
  MONEY INT(RA)
  PRINT TAB(38);"-"
  JR=JR-RA
  In line 1514 making AI equal 5,000,000 provides $5M starting budget; this
  can be changed to suit, however Line 2547 making RA=INT(AI/5000) stops the
  directors from withdrawing too much cash every week.
  Click on the `close window' icon for the window containing the program
  text, and save the amended program file by typing: save "FOOT.BAS"
  To run the amended disk, boot up the disk as normal, by clicking on the
  FD II icon.  When the BOOT.BAS icon is clicked the message BAD FILE MODE
  appears.  Accept this by using the OK box.
  Close the CLI window containing the few lines of text, by clicking on the
  close window icon.
  Type "load".  A message box appears prompting for the name of the program
  to load.  Using the left hand mouse button click on the text bar and type
  this: FOOT.BAS
  When the OK message appears, type "RUN".  The program should now start as
  normal with plenty of dosh to spend.
