        Advancement in rank has nothing to do with the amount of credits to
        your name.  It is releated to the number of missions you complete
        and ships destroyed. The only way to earn a lot of credits is to
        haggle on the trade-net.  By staying in the space station on the
        net, and trading in guns, food and gold, you will quickly build a
        fortune.  Travelling to space stations requires you to jump until
        you cannot get any further.  Guide to completing the missions:
