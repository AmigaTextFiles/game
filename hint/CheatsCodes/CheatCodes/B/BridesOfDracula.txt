        When you're dracula, go right from the first screen and turn the
        first two women into vampires, taking them back to their coffins.
        Then return to that screen again, walk between the lift and the
        second table and crouch down just past the skulls on the floor. A
        vampire should then appear ready to be put into her coffin.  Do
        this again and again to get all eleven vampires, and then polish
        off heising before he knows what hit him.
