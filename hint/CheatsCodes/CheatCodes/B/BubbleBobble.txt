        If you can get to levels 10, 20, 30 and 40 without losing a life, a
        magic door will appear to take you to a bonus screen, and if you
        can get up to stage 50 without losing a life, a magic door will
        appear and take you to level 70.  On levels 7 & 22 wait a few
        seconds until an umbrella falls and grab it, you will warp ahead 6
        levels.  Alternatively, try these:
                    'F1'____________________To advance 1 level.
                    'F2'_________________To advance six levels.
                    'F3'______________To advance eleven levels.
