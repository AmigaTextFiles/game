  To earn heaps of experience points, make a backup of your original play
  disc.  Now boot and insert the disk that contains your characters.  Save
  them onto your second backup by going to the inn.  Buy three tickets
  (green, yellow, red or black) and try to win in all three arenas.
  Remember to save after each victory.  Once you have a victory in each
  arena, go to the castle where the bishop is held captive.  Before enter-
  ing flick the write protect tab to protect your disk.  Then enter and
  free the bishop with the correct key.  He will give you 10,000 experience
  points if you have won three fights of the same color.   Exit and go to
  town.  Open the write protect tab and save at the inn.  You can repeat
  this several times.  Once you have acquired mega-experience, save your
  party using your original backup of the play disk.

  Hirelings
  - Dead Eye and Red Duke are in Bozorc's (BOSS ORC) control in D1 at
    14,01.
  - Sir Kill and Jed I are in Sarakin's Mines.  Unfortunately, you have
    to kill Sarakin first (and his undead friends!)
  - Might Nakazama and Lord Peabody's servant Sherman were last seen having
    some problems with amazons near Native's Cove at 10,1.
  - A couple of guys are in prison in Atlantium - break `em out!
  - A couple of kids are in kept in prison by kobolds in kobold's HQ in the
    dungeons beneath Middlegate
  - Buy fried troll's liver at bar in Vulcania.  I think there are a couple
    of hirelings who like your taste...But ya gotta demonstrate your skills
    to them first... (So what is killing a dozen cripples and misers...)
  - A couple of hirelings are almost dinner for the snowbeast in Tundara.
    Kill the snowbeast (in the outer walls of the city), skip the emerald
    ring or you will be accused of murder, and save the 2 hirelings.
  - A lichlord guards a high level wizard in Area D3.
  - A couple of guys are currently being held in prison in Castle Hillstone.
  - Anyway, with the exception of Sherman, most of the hirelings are not
    necessary to win the game.  They are nice to have around.  The most a
    hireling can cost is 50000 gold a day.  There is a list of all the
    hirelings and their locations in the hall of hirelings in Castle Xabran.
  General:
  - New tips appear in the bars every odd, even, 30th and 180th days.
  - Catch a Ferry to Murray's resort isle at C3-7,9.
  - Star Burst is in the centre of the Dead Zone
  - The password for use at Square lake is WAFE
  - To unlock the frozen secrets of evil, try Right 46, Left 23.
  - To free the mystic Thaumaturge of Good, enter Right 32, Left 64.
  - Go to bar in Tundara and eat red-hot wolf nipple chips.  Then go to
    Druid's Grove (C3 - 1,9) and you will find a druid eating the same
    thing.  He'll like your breath so much he will give you the Nature's
    Gate spell
  - For the clerical Divine Intervention spell,  Go to the Druid's Cave,
    and at 14,15 is a arch druid who needs a favor from you.  Find Horvath!
    Well, Horvath is within the cave (5,3?) find him and kill him.  Horvath
    is a pretty tough opponet so beware.  If you succeed, go  back to the
    druid and he will grant you this spell.
  - For the Eagle Eyes spell, complete Nordon's quest in Middlegate, and
    this spell is part of the reward.
  - You will need some sort of protection to get the Starburst spell!
    It is supposed to be in the middle of the Dead Zone, but I do not
    know anyone who has actually got it.
  - For the Enchant Item spell, find the Gemmaker in the Gemmaker's Cave
    (D1 - 10,12? - a bit north of Vulcania!)  The Gemmaker is at 3,3 in
    the dungeon.  Warning: His fee is TIME! (Your character gets AGED.)
  - A list of all spells to be found is at the Hall of spells in Castle
    Xabran.
  - On days 140-170 at B2 - 14,4 (the circus grounds), there is a circus.
    Now try a few events there.  You will probably lose, but you do a
    consolation prize...A cupie doll!   Now go (fly is quicker) to D3
    7,13? (somewhere there!) and meet this old raving hermit.  He will
    take  the doll and direct you to the pool in the Inner Limits (E2 -
    10,11?).  Bath in this pool (usually it is acid) and you will feel
    like a WINNER!  Go back to the circus grounds and choose a category
    you want to improve on.  For example, if you want improved strength,
    try to ring the bell.  Horseshoes for improved accuracy, Kissing booth
    for better personality, Shell game for better intelligence, Sack race
    for better speed, Head dunk for better endurance, etc.  +10 to the
    category.
  Individual Quests
  For one to be true, each class must fulfil his quest.  Each class must be
  alone or be in the company of thieves.  When the quest is done, return to
  Mt. Farview in area D2 - 07,00 to claim true status (+) and 5 million
  experience.
  Tasks for individual characters are:
  Archers must defeat Baron Wilfrey.  (B2 11,02)
  Barbarians must defeat Brutal Bruno, the barbarian chieftain.  (C4 00,15)
  Clerics must defeat a haunt of ghosts at C1 10,15 in the Lost Soul's
          Woods and collect Corak's Soul.  Then go to Corak's Crypt and
          reunite the soul with his body.  One must have an Admit 8 Pass
          to enter the crypt though, and to obtain one, you have to get it
          from a zombie in the dungeon beneath Sandsobar (or find one as
          treasure after a fight!)
  Knights must defeat the Dread Knight of Jouster's Way.  (B3 05,14)
  Ninjas must assassinate the chaotic Dawn of Dawn's mist bog.  (D4 08,09)

           the Forbidden Forest.  (B3)
  Sorcerers must release both the Good and the Evil wizards from the Isle
            of the Ancients.
            For Evil (dark), follow this set of markeddoors: 1, 3, 1, 7, 9,
            11, A, C, G, I.  The combination to free the evil wizard is
            Right 46 (type 46 when you enter the right alcove) and Left 23
            (type 23 when you enter the left alcove!)
            For Good (Light), follow this path: 2, 2, 4, 6, 6, 12, A, D,
            F, I.  The combination to free the good wizard is Right 32 and
            Left 64.
  Robbers must accompany some/all characters on their relevant quests.
  Triple Crowns
  Buy a key of the appropriate colour.  Buy several arena tickets and then
  fight in the 3 different arenas (Middlegate's ARENA, Sandsobar's Monster
  Bowl, and Atlantium's Colliseum).  Once you have won all 3 fights, you
  are a triple crown winner of that colour.  Go to the bishop of the
  appropriate colour to claim the experience earned.  There are 4 colours
  and 4 types of tickets.
        Green Key -   Key Shoppe in Middlegate
        Green Ticket - Supplies Store in Middlegate

        Black Bishop - Luxus Castle
  You have to be both True and a Black Triple Crown winner to qualify for
  the quest for Princess Lamanda (goal of the game).
  To finish the game
  Get the four weapons (Tolidor, Fluxer, etc.)
  Get the Element Orb.  (Dawns mist bog cavern - 10,15)
    You can't leave with Orb in hand!  There should be a teleporter in
    the dungeon (very near the entrance), use that instead and you should
    end up in Murray's Cave in Murray's Resort Isle.  Another way is to
    transfer the Orb to the hireling and then Dismissing my hireling.  Now
    I can leave the cave with no problem and I can find the hireling with
    the Orb same and sound back at the original inn.
  Get the four elemental talons.
  Use Lord Peabody's time machine to get to the 9th Century (Era 8), and
    go to Castle Xabran at C2 - 14,08.
  Get the four discs
    Using the time machine in Castle Pinehurst, or through the vortex holes
    at the corners of each elemental planes, travel back to the years 100,
    200, 300, 400 to find the talons.  The locations of the talons are
    given above.  Each shrine which holds a talon requires the appropriate
    disc to open.
  Now you should have all 4 talons and the orb.  Go back to the 9th Century
  again and find King Kalohn at C4 - 14,5 and see him fighting the Mega
  Dragon.  When he sees you with the talons and Orb, you will haved changed
  history because history had said the battle would have been lost.  Now
  that the dragon has been vanquished, King Kalohn will live after all.
  You return to the 10th Century and you go back to Luxus Palace.  Instead
  of Princess Lamanda, you now see King Kalohn!  He tells you of the final
  quest.  To go to Square Lake and try to stop the villain that is going to
  doom Cron.
  You enter this fantastic maze.  At the end of this simple maze, you meet
  him.  SHELTEM and his elemental friends...You should be able to defeat
  him, but alas, can you beat his recorded message?  He has left a pre-
  recorded message and REAL-TIME cryptogram puzzle.  If time expires, the
  world crashes into the Sun.  Now, the encription algorithm changes EVERY
  time so I can't help you with that.  But the message is the same every
  time:
  We, the people of Terra, in order to form a more perfect union, establish
  justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense.
  The answer of this is given already, Preamble.  Now, find the corre-
  sponding encryption and translate the word Preamble to its encrypted code
  and then you are done!  Cron is saved from crashing into the Sun.
