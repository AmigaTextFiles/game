            
        A quick tip to gain cash.  Find a high tech world with a low law
        level and buy as many PGMP'S as possible, although there may only
        be one initially.  Then go to a lower tech, higher law level world
        and sell the merchandise.  The ideal planets are: LLUN/EFATE (When
        using the trader character on the disk you can purchase a PGMP for
        130500 credits) and STUR/EFATE (Where not only is there a PGMP
        lying on the floor NESAR the gun shop, but they can be sold for
        244500 credits).  In no time at all and with a little cost (because
        you are staying within the system) you will gain riches untold!
