        Pause the game and press the buttons.  You should notice that one
        of the buttons will produce a sound with a higher pitch.  Now press
        another button.  If you don't get another high pitched sound press
        the button that first made the sound and continue to try the other
        buttons.  The cheat is a sequence of 5 or 6 buttons.  Just think of
        the game SIMON and remember the sequence until you get it right.
        You will hear a different sound when you complete the sequence.
