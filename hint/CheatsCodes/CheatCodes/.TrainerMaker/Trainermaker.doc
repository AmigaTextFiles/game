 TrainerMaker V0.8 (from here on referred as TM) allows you, similar to the
 train-function of the Amiga-Action-Replay to 'modify' money, number of lives
 or high-scores of some games.

RESTRICTIONS:

 a). the game to be modified must be capable of multitasking ( e.g. Ports of
     Call, RailRoad Tycoon or SimCity). Most of the existing action-games
     unfortunately are not.
 b). TM only searches all CHIP-memory and the internal 512K expansion.
     Additional FAST-mem remains disregarded.

FUNCTION:

 First you pass a value to TM (your money or whatever you want to change) and
 TM searches all your memory for this value and saves the addresses found.
 Then you go on playing till this value is changed. Now you pass this new value
 to TM and TM compares all addresses found against this new value.
 The possible addresses will be displayed and then they can be modified at
 pleasure.

PARAMETERS:

 Only the first character is significant, the remaining part of the line will
 be ignored !
 Number inputs can be decimal or hexadecimal ($-character in front !).
 Wrong inputs (e.g. letters different from a-f) will cancel any action.
 Negative decimal-inputs aren't implemented yet.

 f - asks for a value and searches all your memory for this number.
     (0,1,and $ff are not advisable !)
 c - compares the addresses found against the new value. If more than 3 or 4
     addresses are displayed you should repeat the search with an other value.
 m - asks for an address (displayed after running c) and a value to be written
     at this address.
 b,w,l
   - with these commands you can switch the searchmode
     with b you can search for values which are maximal +127 ($7f or 2 hex-
     digits)
     with w values up to +32665 ($7fff [4 hex-digits]) and any value higher
     with l. ($7fffffff [8 hex-digits])
     [It's not advisable to search byte-values because there're always many
      possibilites.]
     Attention: When switching the mode, all found addresses will be cleared
                because they are no longer valid.
 s - shows the active mode.
 q - quit

HINTS:

 The largest numbers are $7f, $7fff and $7fffffff.
 Everything larger is negative ( with BYTE e.g. $80 = -128, $ff = -1)

 SimCity: Your money is saved in LONG-format. ( l!)
 RailRoad Tycoon: Here we have WORD-format. (Attention: You mustn't enter the
          last 3 digits of your money because they are disregarded in the in-
          ternal handling of the money.

 If you shouldn't have success, you can switch the mode and try once more.
 Or if you notice that your game works wih complete thousands (e.g. RT) you can
 try leaving out the last three digits of your money.

FIRST STEPS:

 If your game is started via Workbench, start first TM by double-click on its
 icon and then your game.
 If it's an auto-start-game, copy TM on the game-disk and insert trainermaker
 in the first line of s/startup-sequence of that disk.
 [TM works fine with all games, where you get/hide the Workbench-screen by
 <left Amiga>N/<left Amiga>M.]

 Now play your game till you get the value you want to have modified on your
 screen, take TM, use the f-function and go on playing till the value is
 changed. Use c and the m to make live easier and enjoy your game !

FINAL CONSIDERATIONS:

 Maybe there's a couple of game-freaks who've got enough time to test out the
 games TM works with and what kind the values are and who'd be so kind to send
 their results to Fred !

 And now I wish you success and fun with the TrainerMaker V0.8
