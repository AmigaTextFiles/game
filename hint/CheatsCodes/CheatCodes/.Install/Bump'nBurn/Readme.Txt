              Fixed For Hard Disk By Mars Bar / Crimewatch Uk

                            Cracked By Prestige


To install Bump N Burn, run "BumpNBurn->Hd.Exe" from the directory you want
to install to.

							1 Meg Fast Ram

Depending on your setup you may need to use the Runit program to disable/
reset certain parts of your system (Runit Vbase Nocache etc.)

Ill release an update to this patch when someone decides to train it...

The loading time is still quite slow (due to wads of decrunching) but its
at least TWICE as fast and theres no faffing around with disks.

I havent been able to test this 100% but it should be Ok... if you get any
problems mail me at Soap City.

And Somet I forgot to include in the Benefactor Hd-Fix Readme...

BENEFACTOR NOTE: Occasionally you will get corrupted game graphics - this
only happens if you have, or have had, other programs running prior to
running the game. The best time to run these patches is on a "clean"
machine, straight from bootup.
