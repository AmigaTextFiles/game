                  ELFMANIA Hard-Disk Installer By Mars Bar


To install onto Hard Disk run the file "Elfmania->Hd.Exe" from the directory
you want the game installed in.

After installation run the file "Cwuk-Loader".

This has only been tested on Aga, I don't have ECS...

Depending on your setup you may need to use the Runit program to set VBR to
zero (Runit Vbase should do it) or to disable certain aspects of the system
(Databurst etc.)
