              Fixed For Hard Disk By Mars Bar / Crimewatch Uk

                            Cracked By Fairlight


To install MUPLC, run "ManUtd->Hd.Exe" from the directory you want to
install to.

After installation, you can choose one of two loaders:

	Cwuk-Fast	: Use with 3 Meg Fast
	Cwuk-Loader	: Use with 1 Meg Fast

Depending on your setup, you may need to use the Runit program to disable/
reset certain parts of your system (Runit Vbase Nocache etc.)

NOTES:  This game was fixed using 2 Meg Chip machine, it *SHOULD* work with
1 meg chip but as I dont have a Hard Disk with that machine, I cant test it.

Game saving/loading is still done to/from disk.

To FORMAT a disk use the Disk Version (FORMAT doesnt work when running from
Hard Disk).  You need only FORMAT a disk once to use it as a saved game
disk. Remember to have at least one formatted disk to hand before running
the game from Hard Disk or you wont be able to save your games.
