Short : LotusII HD-Installer
Type : game/patch

Written 1995 by JOTD


To install LotusII on your HD, first copy the contents of the directory LotusII2HD in
the target directory, then go into this directory and double-click the Install-LotusII
icon. You'll be prompted to insert the original LotusII disk and the contents of this
disk will be copied on your HD.

To play LotusII, then, double-click the GAME_PAL or GAME_NTSC icon, or type in the shell

1> lhd pal (for a PAL display)
or
1> lhd ntsc (for a NTSC display, more frames)

The game will load.

If you have a A1200 and/or you use Multiscan or any other special mode, use the
GAME_PAL_FIX and GAME_NTSC_FIX to run the game, else it works randomly !

Note : you must have at least 1MB of fast RAM and 1MB other ram to run LotusII

This installer was written and tested on a A1200 68030/50 16MB RAM.

It works with the cracked version by the company and has been patched for A1200 users
(it didn't worked before).

Have fun with this cool game (even cooler on HD !)
