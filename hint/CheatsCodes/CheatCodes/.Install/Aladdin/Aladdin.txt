You need:   AGA
            1 meg of fast ram
            2.9 meg of hd space approx

To install, run "Aladdin-Hd.Exe" from the directory you want to install to.
Copy MackHd.Library into your LIBS: directory.

To load the game:

   Loader.Exe        - use with AGA and 1 meg of fast ram

You may need to degrade your system (Vbase, Caches etc.). Kill off ANY other
programs you may have running (Virus Checkers, Monitors etc.). The patch was
written on an A1200+4 Meg Fast, there is no guarantee it will work on any
other machine (but it SHOULD...)
