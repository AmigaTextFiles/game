        Hard Drive Installer For Crash Dummies By Mars Bar 06-06-94


System Requirements:		1 Meg Chip
								1 Meg Fast
								+ 2 Meg Of Hd Space

This has only been tested on Aga, I dont have ECS... should be Ok though.

Run the installer from the directory you want the game installed in.

Depending on your setup you may need to use the Runit program to set VBR to
zero (Runit Vbase should do it) or to disable other aspects of the system
(Databurst etc.)

After installation you can choose from two different loaders:

	Cwuk-Loader		: Use if you have more than 2m of Fast Ram

	Cwuk-Hd			: Use if you have 1m of Fast Ram

The game doesn't like any other programs running in the background, make
sure you are running Crash Dummies and NOTHING ELSE!
