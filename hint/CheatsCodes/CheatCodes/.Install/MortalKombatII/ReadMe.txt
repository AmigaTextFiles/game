		QUICK DOCS FOR MORTAL KOMBAT 2 (HD RAM VERSION)
		-----------------------------------------------

This game requires 4Meg Fast ram and about 1meg chip..

i dont usually bother doing hd-installs for games that are over 3 disks but
this one is an exception ...

the reason being is that this game, with 1 Drive, is bloody murder to play
because of all the shitty disk swapping, so thats why i have done this ..

ive noticed through no fault of mine, that the game locks up whenever it 
feels like it, even from the disk version .. so dont blame me if it does!!

anyway m8s, have phun with this game .. need the docs though cause i cant
figure out the bloody special moves... see yah!!
