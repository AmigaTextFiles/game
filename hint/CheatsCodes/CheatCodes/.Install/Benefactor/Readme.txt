To install Benefactor, run "Benefactor->Hd.Exe" from the directory you want
to install to.

After installation, use one of these loaders:

	Cwuk-Loader		: Use with 1 Meg Chip + 1 Meg Fast
	Cwuk-Fast		: Use with 1 Meg Chip + 3 1/2 Meg Fast

Depending on your setup you may need to use the Runit program to disable/
reset certain parts of your system (Runit Vbase Nocache etc.)

(NOTE:  At Level 60 the game will ask for DISK 4 - there isnt one!  This
also happens when you select "Load Extra Levels" from the menu.  It seems
there will probably be a data disk released some time in the future.  )

LEAVE DISK 1 IN THE INTERNAL DRIVE AT ALL TIMES. THE GAME LOOKS AT THIS WHEN
SAVING THE HIGH SCORE.
