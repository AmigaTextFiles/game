              Fixed For Hard Disk By Mars Bar / Crimewatch Uk

                  Cracked By Skid Row & Trained By Anthrox


(NOTE: Due to lack of quality new warez I've decided to look back at games
of bygone days to see if any are worth fixing for Hard Disk. If you think
this is lame, thats your problem not mine!)

To install Bills Tomato Game, run "Bill->Hd.Exe" from the directory you want
to install to.

After installation, choose one of these loaders:

	Cwuk-Fast			: Use with 1 1/2 Meg Fast
	Cwuk-Loader			: Use with 1 Meg Fast

Depending on your setup you may need to use the Runit program to disable/
reset certain parts of your system (Runit Vbase Nocache etc.)

                                - Mars Bar -

PS: Two disks were spread with the Anthrox trainer installed - the second
disk is NEVER USED! Boot it and you'll see its the untrained version!
