                              How Do I Do It?
                              ===============
This is the tutorial on how I installed Chaos Strikes Back on to my hard
drive.  Yes, it is a hack and yes, it ain't pretty, but it works (for me
at least 8->).  This is not really a tutorial but actually a recount of
the things that I did to get it installed and working. You should know your
way around CLI or Shell pretty well and not be afraid to do things like
alter your MountList.  This tutorial is based on my system and it's
requirements, yours may be different, and therefore you will have to deviate
from this tutorial.  You should know your system and it's requirements.  If
you don't then you should ask someone that knows, maybe the salesperson who
sold you CSB (if they are Amigawise and not just saleswise) or you can ask
me.  Proceed at your own risk, and don't yell at me if you or your computer
gets screwed up.
 
Here's how the installation was done:
------------------------------------ 
1)  I bought Chaos Strikes Back.  Only $29 with tax at Computer Mania.
    One hell of a bargain for such a wonderful game.
 
2)  I became thoroughly frustrated with the floppy-only boots and no
    multitasking.  (See 'MyStory')
 
3)  I failed at normal hard drive install attempts.  But then, I got
    an idea, and it worked.
 
4)  I called a local BBS that wasn't down to process FIDO mail. (Up late!)  
    From here I downloaded an archive call FMSDIS.LZH which I kindly 
    put in this archive, so you don't have to call any BBS!

5)  I backed up my hard drive, just to be safe. DO THIS!

6)  I unarchived FMS and READ ALL OF THE DOCS.  I copied FMSdisk.device to
    my DEVS: directory, and then I altered my DEVS:MountList to include FF0:
    according to the instructions of the mountlist example included in
    FMSDIS.LZH.  I used FFS, made it Unit 0 and 0 - 79 tracks. Here is the
    exact MountList entry:

FF0:	Device = devs:fmsdisk.device
	FileSystem = l:FastFileSystem
	Unit   = 0
	Flags  = 1
	Surfaces  = 2
	BlocksPerTrack = 11
	Reserved = 2
	Interleave = 0
	LowCyl = 0
	HighCyl = 79
	Buffers = 10
	BufMemType = 0
	GlobVec = -1
	DosType = 0x444F5301
#
 
7)  I created a new dir DH1:CSB and did an 'Assign FMS: DH1:CSB', all
    according to the docs supplied with FMSDIS.LZH. Then I used 'Mount FF0:'
    to make the system recognize the device, and then issued this command:
 
	1> Format drive FF0: name DungeonMaster NOICONS
   
    You have to name it 'DungeonMaster' for this to work.  You can do this
    while formatting or later with the 'Relabel' command.

8)  I popped into FF0: to make sure it was working.  Used the 'Info' command
    to make sure the device was recognized.

9)  Then I went to the CSB Master Disk and copied all of the files from 
    the root directory to FF0: (Copy df0: FF0:).  I also copied from the C
    dir of the Master Disk the program called 'Version', although I don't
    think this particular one is necessary (Copy df0:c/Version FF0:).  I
    also copied s/StartUp-Sequence from the Master Disk to FF0: (Copy
    df0:s/StartUp-Sequence FF0:). From FF0:, I renamed StartUp-Sequence to
    'Start.SH'.

10)  I took my editor and edited Start.SH down to this command:
 
	DungeonMaster:BJELoad_r

11)  Then I created a file called CSB.sh into my S: directory.  I added
     the .sh extension so CShell4.00a would auto-execute it.  You do not
     need to do this if you don't use CShell.  In the file I put the
     following commands:
 
	echo ""
	echo "Loading Chaos Strikes Back - FTL..."
	echo ""
        echo " Make sure that the DungeonMaster master disk is in df0:!"
	assign FMS: DH1:Chaos        ;(Assign FMS: as required by FMS)
	mount FF0:                   ;(Mount the volume)
	cd ff0:                      ;(Go to the dir to fully load FF0:)
	start                        ;(CShell will auto-execute 'start.sh'
				     ; you will need to put 'Execute
                                     ; Start.sh' if not using CShell)

    This script mounts FF0:, which should be named DungeonMaster:, goes to
    FF0: and executes the modified startup-sequence (Start.SH).

If you use a saved game, you then will be required to insert your Save Game
disk, and follow that procedure, the re-insert the Master Disk. If you wish
to save your game, you are still required to insert a floppy into DF0: for
that operation.
If everything works right, the game will load from your hard drive and your
face will be all smiley!

Caution - Caution - Caution - Caution - Caution
----------------------------------------------- 
Be very careful when working with your Chaos Strikes Back originals. Write-
protect them and use a backup if you have one.

For this hack to work, the original must be inserted into DF0: BEFORE the
script is executed.  If not then some, most, or all of it will be loaded
from floppy and that is no fun.  Plus the copy protection requires that the
Master Disk be in DF0:

When messing with your hard drive, please use a freshly backed up partition
or drive.  If something goes wrong, you will be very unhappy unless you
have a backup handy.

I take no responsibility for your originals, your hard drive, or your sanity
if anything goes wrong while you are attempting this procedure
