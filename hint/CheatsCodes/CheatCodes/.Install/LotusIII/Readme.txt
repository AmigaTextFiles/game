                       Hd-Installer By Crimewatch Uk

( This Hd-Installer was based on the Fairlight/Crack Inc. version after it
was FIXED. If you dont have the fixed version, sorry, theres nothing I can
do about this! )

To install the game copy "Lotus3->Hd.Exe" to the directory you want the game
installed in, and run it.

System Requirements:	1 Meg Chip (Minimum)
							1 Meg Fast (Minimum)
							Approx. 2 Meg H/d Space

After installation you can choose from two loaders:

	Cwuk-Fast		: Use with 3 Meg Fast
	Cwuk-Loader		: Use with 1 Meg Fast

Depending on your setup, you may need to use the "Runit" program to set VBR
to zero (Runit Vbase) or to disable other aspects of the system (Databurst
etc.)
