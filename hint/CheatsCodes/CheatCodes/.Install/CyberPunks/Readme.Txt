(NOTE: Insert the game disk before booting.)

To install Cyberpunks, run "Cyberpunks->Hd.Exe" from the directory you want
to install to.

You need just over 1 Meg of FAST to run this, 1 meg might do it if you have
NO OTHER PROGRAMS RUNNING. The file you want to run is called "Cwuk-Fast"

Depending on your setup you may need to use the Runit program to disable/
reset certain parts of your system (Runit Vbase Nocache etc.)
