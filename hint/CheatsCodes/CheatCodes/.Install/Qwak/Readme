Short : QWAK HD-Installer
Type : game/patch

Written in 1995 by JF FABRE

QWAK is copyright 1993 Team17 Software.


To install QWAK on your HD, first copy the contents of the directory QWAK2HD in
the target directory, then go into this directory and double-click the Install-QWAK
icon. You'll be prompted to insert the original QWAK disk and the contents of this
disk will be copied on your HD.

To play QWAK, then, double-click the GAME icon.
The game will load.

Note : you must have at least 1MB of fast RAM  and 1MB other ram to run QWAK

For A1200/4000 users, when you use Multiscan in the Workbench, sometimes the
display is corrupt. In that case, start with GAME_FIX instead of GAME
(it uses setchiprev).

This installer was written and tested on a A1200 68030/50 16MB RAM.

Have fun with this cool game (even cooler on HD !)

PS : As the original QWAK disk is not copy-protected, I don't consider this
     installer is a way to crack the game !
