 Cheat Mode:

 When batting, to get a lot of runs press [P] when the fielder picks up
 the ball to pause the game. The fielder will be frozen, but your batsmen
 won't. Simply waggle the joystick and your batters will run.
 You can now chalk up a high score. When you've had enough simply press
 [P] again to unpause the game. You can also press the [Spacebar] twice
 while your bowler is running to start your bowl again.
