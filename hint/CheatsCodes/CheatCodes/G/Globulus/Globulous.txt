GLOBULOUS

The most important thing to remember is that ALL the puzzles can be
solved without losing a life, so if you lose a life and think its the
only way to solve the screen, look closely. Some of the puzzles get
pretty obscure after level 10, but once you eventually beat them youll
kick yourself for not seeing the solution earlier.

Look before you leap. Think about how the screen will look from a
flipped perspective. A lot of jumps you make will be unnecessary and
waste time and switches if you dont.

Make sure you have enough switches, at least 10 per screen. It is
possible to get stuck on a downward slope with no way to get back up
or kill yourself, and the only way out is to press ESC and start the
whole game over.

Here are a few codes you might like to try:
