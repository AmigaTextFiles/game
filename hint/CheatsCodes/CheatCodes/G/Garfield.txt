                                 GARFIELD
                                ==========

  From the start screen go left until you come to the front door with the cat
flap. Pick up the red rubber bone and drop it next to the cat flap. Wait until
Odie opens the cat flap  and then move back to the start screen with the green
chair and go through the door. Pick up the torch and go into the back yard.
Enter the shed and fall down the hole. Walk right until you come to an alley
and then go up to it. Carry on right and down until you get to Nermal. You'll
need to kick him repeatedly until he drops the mouse and then move Odie to pick
up the mouse and leave the sewer.
  You should then drop the mouse off at the health shop. A spinach doughnut
will fall and you need to take this to the rat in the sewer. Drop him the
doughnut and he'll stop. Then go to the chest, kick it and pick up the key.
Take the key to the park and drop it next to the lady on the bench.
  The next step is to fetch either the bucket from the garden or the spade from
the shed and take it to the hardware store. By using it in the shop you can
gain a one dollar bill which may be used to buy some bird seed from the health
food shop. Take the bird seed to the park and drop it next to the key. Quickly
lift up the key and stand still. The duck will pick you up and drop you in the
dog pound. Walk right and go up the alley. Go right again and all that`s left
to do is get a big smacker from Arlene.





                          GENERAL HINTS AND TIPS
                         ------------------------

1.  NEVER EVER attempt to go to the sewers without the torch.
2.  To get lots of points do any of the following:
  a.  Go to the pizza party (a building without a sign on it). Waggle your
      joystick left and right to eat pizzas. When you get splatted by a pie
      you'll see a pizza monster!
  b.  Take the golf ball from the shed to the golf course (the scene before
      the busty lady picture). Kick it to try for a hole-in-one. If you miss
      you'll find the ball near the busty lady.
  c.  Jump on the settee and kick it. You'll then see it's ripped.
3.  Pick up the aniseed balls for invincibility (as long as you carry them).
4.  If Odie picks up the aniseed balls he'll not pinch any of your items.
