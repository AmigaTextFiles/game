NOTE: This game may generate unique passwords for each copy sold. Therfore
      the codes listed below in magazines probably don't work.

Level Passwords: Level 2 - JZS  or  CEL  or  APV
                 Level 3 - SFJ  or  HHO  or  AVJ
                 Level 4 - USX  or  DRA  or  LHH

Type SORCERY and once you pass selct password option you receive infinite
energy.

On level two, buy a shield and a magic potion, then get three fireballs and
three stars. Spend all of your remaining money on food and haelth. Collect
all the gems in the usual manner. Then get a key and make for the exit.

When you decend the last ladder, two thieves will appear, make sure that you
don't quite have enough energy to survive a direct contact! Before going down
the ladder, release your potion, then climb down and open the door. Stand in
front of the door ready to leave, but don't pushup yet! Wait until the
thieves jump down at you and as soon as they touch you push the joystick up.
You may lose that life, but then something rather strange will happen. The
bonus will start to wiz up for quit some time, until the game stars again on
world two with 28 extra men and about 5 million points!
