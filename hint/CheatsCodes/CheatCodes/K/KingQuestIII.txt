        When casting a spell and are asked to recite a verse, press
        'RETURN'.  The king's quest series of games uses the debug and
        interpreter for the programmers (up to KGIII).  Press 'ALT', 'D',
        and hit 'RETURN OR ENTER' twice.  Now, type "GET OBJECT" (and type
        a random number) or type "TP" (and a random number) to transport to
        different locations.
