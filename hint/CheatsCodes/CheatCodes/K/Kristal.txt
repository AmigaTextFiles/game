        the game.  The neck chop is one of the more effective blows, but the
        program blocks repetition of single moves.  To get around this,
        occassionaly switch to a differnt move in order to enable the neck
        chop once again.  Give generously to the poor and you'll be a step
        closer to obtaining the sword of the spheres.

        THE PALACE - To enter the palace, you'll need to get the invitation
        from the elusive Gloop, found in Novala.  Once you have it, keep out
        of fights or you could lose it for good.  When you get into the
        palace, ask nedrod three questions and he will give you the talisman,
        which can help you find another useful item.  Answer the princess's
        question with {ITS A SECRET}.  She will give you the ring of belz,
        which will only work in conjunction with the spell scroll.

        IN GENERAL - Objects are not always found in the same places from
        game to game, so a detailed search of both fore and backgrounds is
        often in order.  To survive the final confrontation, a high psychic
        rating is needed, which can be increased by donating skringles to
        the poor.  Disorderly conduct can have the opposite effect.  The
        safest technique in the space battles, is to slow right down as soon
        as you see the aliens shoot them all, then power at full steam until
        the next lot.  Follow readheads ship if you see it.  Heatpro tablets
        are necessary if you beam down to one of the hotter planets.  Makes
        notes of what you are told, and use any new names or subjects to
        weavel out every last bit of information from the characters.
