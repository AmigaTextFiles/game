                                  ======

First, how to complete the five ordeals :-

                                 THE TWINS
                                -----------

Object needed - GOBLET.

  Go to the source on the left hand side. Inspect the fountain and press the
eye. Fill the Goblet and go back to the room called 'THE TWINS'. Open the
left-hand serpent and empty the goblet into it. Get the die that emerges from
the serpent then open the right hand serpent. Throw the die, and note the
number thrown. Put the die into the right-hand serpent and go to the room
facing you. The hands are in a dice formation (except for the middle one) Pull
up the hands until they resemble the formation you threw earlier, then push the
serpent's head on the wall. The sliding partition should open; note down the
shape which it covered. Go back to the fountain room and inspect each cube
(each is patterned). Lift the cube which resembles the one you found behind the
sliding partition.



                        IN THE SCORPION'S PRESENCE
                       ----------------------------

Object needed - FLY.

  Pray to the statue then enter the room called 'THE WEB'. Look at the web on
the floor and crawl on it. Give the mistress the fly; show affection but don't
be too saucy with her. Feed the fly to the blue spider and get the red one.
Leave the room, and then put the red spider into the statue's mouth. Don't
listen to the man who pops out, just pass through the trap door.



                                 THE WALL
                                ----------

Object needed - DAGGER or you can use the PSI-SHIFT.

  First choose the third zone, then the second zone; this means that you can
unlock the sliding wall when you open either door. Go through either door, left
or right, and inspect the step. Then take a look at the slot on the Sculpted
Warrior and climb onto the step. Either put your dagger into the slot, or if
you haven't got one, use Psi-Shift. You will be spun around by the wall. There
are now TWO separate gaps in the wall, one which goes straight on, and the
other is a dark, black strip; it depends on which door you have taken. Move the
cursor to go down the black passage, not straight on. Stick your hand in the
gap on the floor. Return the way you came, and this time go straight on.



                               DE PROFUNDIS
                              --------------

Object needed - ROPE.

  First of all, wait. Then lasso your rope onto the hook on the ceiling. When
the Granite Monster lurks towards you, jump onto him. Wait a few minutes.



                                 THE NOOSE
                                -----------

Object needed - none.

  Do not do as the Poormouth says. Use either the lantern, or your Solar Eyes
Power. Grab hold of left hand rope and climb up. Push the lever, remove the
noose-rope and he will fall. Take the left-hand piece of rope. Inspect the
hollow on the platform. Finally, leave and go to the Master's Orbit.



                            AFTER THOSE ORDEALS
                           ---------------------

  Give all five skulls to the Protozorg underneath the trader. He will announce
that you are a divot. Go to the concourse outside the ring, and remember, if
you are asked any questions, show the egg you were given. Once you are in the
concourse, ignore the guard and use all the violence you can muster on the
upper right-hand guard; then enter the upper right-hand passage.
  Go left. Inspect the toad's head and poke it's eye. Use the Lantern (if you
have it) or the Solar Eyes to see. Inspect the lever and the trap door. Use
Psi-Shift on the lever and pass through the trap door. Next keep going straight
through until you meet Norma Jean and Ash. You MUST do as Norma Jean says.
Don't move !! Tell her the truth...talk to both of them and then use your Zone
Scan. Lift your block on the floor and get both objects, the beam and the
flask. Unwrap the bandages from the mummy, go to the left and keep going
forward.
  By going through the trap door you will enter the Threshold of Truth. Kill
the priestess and put the egg in the opened mouth. Next off, take a look at the
Lantern. Read the book, then use your Psi-Shift on the statuette to retrieve it
on the left-hand side, near the ceiling.
  Leave and go to the refectory, then go to Saura's Repose. Put the statuette
you found into the niche then go to the Presence of God, and then to Placating
the Powers. Kill the first priestess, then make use of Psi-Shift on Saura's
Mark, aiming it at her dagger. Use Brain Warp on the character, Sci-Fi, then
giver her the flask to drink. Go to Saura's Repose, putting the monkey into the
small tunnel. Enter the Presence of God and wait. Go into the passage. Wait.
Use aggro on the god, Zorg, and then use Brain Warp on Pratozim, who is holding
Sci-Fi hostage. Use Psi-Shift on trap door, and finally, throw the knife or
dagger at Pratozim.





                      SOME ADDITIONAL HINTS AND TIPS
                     --------------------------------

*  Don't waste your Psi-Powers, they are needed much later on in the game.
   If you run out of it early you can't complete the game.

*  Don't fight the guards in the Monster's Orbit. You will be instantly
   killed.

*  If you go onto the concourse before you become a divo, you won't be able
   to complete the game.
