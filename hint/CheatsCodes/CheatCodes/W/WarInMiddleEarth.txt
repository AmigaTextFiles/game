                            WAR IN MIDDLE EARTH
                           =====================

 RACE          ABILITY
-----         ---------

Elves         Good shots, but physically weak.
Dwarves       Bad shots, but very strong.
Humans        Fine on both.
Tree Ents     Good shots and mighty fighters, but they will run if the
              forest is in danger.
Hobbits       A peaceful race, bad at everything.
Orcs          Strong but stupid, easy to kill.
Half Orcs     Wimps and stupid, even easier to kill.
Trolls        Killers, avoid at all costs.

  If Gandalf goes to Derdingle, 1,000 huorns will go to Hornburg and 1,000 Ents
will go to Isengard. Aragorn can be found at Bree and Merry can be found at
Buckland.
  Five-hundred trolls can easily handle everyone from Minas Tirith, Osgiliath
and Cair Andros.



GANDALF has staggering power in battle and is the only character you can
control who is capable of defeating the Nazgul, Saruman or Sauron in single
combat. Just Gandalf on his own can wipe out an entire company of Orcs. So,
Gandlaf should be used wherever the need is greatest if you are trying to
sneak Frodo into Mordor undetected and virtually unaccompanied, Gandalf is
best employed at Minas Tirith. If you are planning instead to escort Frodo,
Gandalf makes a magnificent bodyguard!

The NAZGUL also have staggering power in battle. The Ring bearer,
unaccompanied, can avoid Nazgul by taking paths that do not cross the
routes of the enemy in Sauron's campaign plan. In the case of the Nazgul,
discretion is always the better part of valour and the best way to deal
with them is to avoid them entirely. They are quite capable of massacring
an entire army.

SAURON, like the Nazgul,is to be avoided altogether. However, he spends
most of his time within the confines of Mordor itself. If he does venture
beyond the borders of his foul realm, it will only be for a very short
distance. There is no danger, for instance, of encountering him at Minas
Tirith.

Although not as deadly as the Nazgul, SARUMAN is a power to be reckoned with
in battle. he is usually to be found within the triangle of Orthanc,
Edoras and Helm's Deep, but may occasionally attempt to seize the citadel
of Minas Tirith. If it is well guarded, Saruman alone is unlikely to
succeed. Even so, treat this character with caution.



                              SHORT SOLUTION
                             ----------------

First leave Frodo and the company to follow the way they are going.
When they meet Merry take him and keep going to Rivendell.
Before you get there go South at Trollshaws.
The Hobbits can beat Wolves but not trolls.
Wait there till the computer tells you about Gandalf being found. Then bring
Gandalf to the Hobbits.
You should make two armies, one to the South (at Welsford) and one to the North
(Thraduil's Palace). Do not worry if initial orders are not obeyed. Once the
enemy starts moving your armies will start to take orders.
You can then meet at the Dagorlad plain.
Now march to Mt Doom and fight the 5000 Orcs and finish off with one of the
Hobbits dropping the ring into Mt Doom to complete the game.
