        Go to the shop with all five stars and over a hundred pounds, and
        buy another star.  You'll get an extra hundred pounds.  You can
        achieve the same by getting the balloon back to the shop and buying
        another balloon.  This can be done as many times as you want.

        A secret room on the first section will warp you to any level in
        the game.  Simply buy the token from the shop and exit as the body.
        Now go down the well and enter the Gents toilets.  Use the token on
        the bubble gum machine and you'll fly up to a secret room with
        another Gents toilet door and an exit.  Go through the Gents, then
        you'll appear in a room with a Ladies and Gents door.  Go over to
        the right and enter an invisible door (Go to the far right and it
        should be found there).  Now go through the Gents to the following
        patterns to enter the desired section of the game.

        The directions for the various choices are given below.  If you
        choose the wrong door or wish to return to theis screen, go through
        the invisible door on the right.
