  * It is probably a good idea to save every now and then, just in
    case :-)

    The timing in the Lab and the Inner Lair is tricky, so it's a good
    idea to save before knocking on the Alchemy Dept. door and before
    opening the wooden door to the Inner Lair.

  * [USERNAME] is the 9-digit number underneath the bar code on your
    student ID contained in the game package, and [PASSWORD] is
    written in your student handbook (also contained in the game
    package).

  * If you have cut-and-paste capability you can just cut and paste
    each line below; the periods seperate the commands and the game
    will understand that.
