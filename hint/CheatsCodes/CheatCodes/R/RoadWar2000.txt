  When you visit certain cities, special options are given to you.  For
  example, in the sequel to Roadwar 2000, Roadwar Europa, if you visit
  Bordeaux in France, you are given the opportunity to allow your men to
  indulge in a little wine quaffing, and if you do they get into a drunken
  brawl.  The cities and choices in Roadwar 2000 are:
  Anaheim / Santa Ana / Garden Grove
  There is an amusement park here - If you allow your men to have a go on
  the rides, morale is improved.
  Dallas / Fort Worth
  Here you can get some fuel addatives.
  Detroit
  Huge power-ups for your vehicles.
  Houston
  The space research centre is here!  You can get some food additives here.
  Las Vegas
  You can allow your men to gamble.  I'm not sure what this does, though!
  Minneapolis / St. Paul
  The home of the Mayo Clinic.  You can get a doctor here.
  Napa / Vallejo / Fairfield
  Wine country!  If you allow your men to indulge some wander off in a
  state of drunkeness.  Lose some men!
  New Orleans
  The Mardi Gras is in town!  If you allow your men to join in with the
  celebrations morale is improved.
  New York
  The home of the U.N. - get a politician.

  These may not be all of the special cities, though.  Explore and find
  out.
