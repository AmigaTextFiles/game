        Collecting all of the gems in the correct order of color (from left
        to right on the gem counter - RED, ORANGE, YELLOW, GREEN, LIGHT
        BLUE, DARK BLUE, and MAUVE) not only awards you the life and Bonus
        Gem, it also grants you access to a magical secret room.  When you
        reach the end of the level, a silver door appears.  You don't have
        to fight the Boss.

        On the fifth island you'll find a box in the secret room which you
        should collect.  There's also a gate with a '7' on it, leading to
        island 7.

        Even more useful is how to create any color gem.  The screen is
        split into several invisible vertical stripes of color.  When a gem
        falls, its color is determined by the `color' of the area into which
        it fell.  Now all you have to do is guage ca refully where the dead
        enemy will fall to create the gem color of your choice.
