        Play the military droid and lose.  Then set the options to the
        following:

                            Difficulty Hard
                            Timer off
                            7 bouts
                            Cinematics On
                            Shadows On
                            Screen Shake On

        Now select two players, and on the handicap screen push left so
        that the red bar moves about quarter into the player one side and
        back again about six times until the screen flashes.  After this
        has happened, cycle through the opponents and after the sentry
        droid, there she'll be.  Player two can now play as her, with
        special moves being; down, towards, up, for a mutation, or; down,
        back, and up, quickly, to melt and reform.
