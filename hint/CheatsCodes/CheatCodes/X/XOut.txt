                                  X - OUT
                                 =========

  If you want 500,000 credits take the DEAREST ship which is the last one and
place it in the outfit area. Then buy the cheapest SATELLITE and place it on
the credits of the shop and press the button. VOILA'......
  There is also another cheat but this one takes a very long time to work. It
is...
  When you are confronted by the first end of level guardian shoot of the
bottom hooter (the one closest to the skull) then position yourself so that you
are not shooting the last hooter (the top one). Make sure you are only shooting
the bubbles that he fires at you. This should give you approximately 20 credits
per second. This takes ages, but if you are persistent leave your room for an
hour and come back. It is very interesting what happens.
  In actual fact you can have twelve different ships. All you do is press F1
for the first ship fully decked with weapons. Pressing F2 for the second ship
and so on. After a while you won't get any more ships because you will run out
of money.
  The best ship that will last the longest is the last one with the bottom
three way laser, two non-moving satellites placed either side of the ship. Then
get the arc satellite, sprite bomb and bouncing bombs. It is also very
advisable in the later levels to get the shield.
[32m<----->
  Choose any of the 4 ships in the shop.
  Click the ship as usual onto the blue print screen and then choose the
invincible icon (the one below the laser - the one to the right of the orange
spiked ball).
  Now drag this icon to your ship and click it on and off the ship.
  Your money increases by 500 units.
  Drag the icon to the Alien Trash Can and trash it.
  Carry on doing this to boost your money to your heart's content.
