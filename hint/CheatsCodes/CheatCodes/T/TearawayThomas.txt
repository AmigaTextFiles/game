        Any time in the game, type "TIMEFLIESLIKEABANANA" for infinite time.

        There is a secret level located on level 1.3, and can be found by
        climbing up to the ninth branch of the tree (which is the one with
        the birds on it) and running off the end. You then will be whisked
        off to a room containing some diamonds which can be collected for
        extra points.
