 Cheat Mode:

 On the filling screen pop up a file and instead of entering your name
 type in `Let me cheat!' (making sure you include the capital and the
 exclamation mark). Now instead of pressing return, hit the Reset button.
 The number next to the losses columm will now be 1, and this shows you
 are in the cheat mode. Now type your name in and you can get into the
 game as normal.
 In this cheat mode there are two major facilities. If you press the
 left [Amiga] key and [W] during a scenario you will automaticly win the
 battle. And if you go to the map screen screen during the game, and
 select a desination using the mouse, then pressing the left [Amiga] key
 followed by the number of the unit you are playing (1,2,3 or 4), that
 unit will instantly go to the the destination marked.
 This cheat mode is the same for all three games in the Team Yankee
 series.
