  To get past the ghostly lady, go towards the hall from the stairs, enter
  the storage closet and take the No-Ghost bottle.  Open the bottle and
  go back to the hall.  Operate the bottle on the lady.  To get past the
  dogs, say "INSTANTUM ILLUMINARIS ABRAXAS" to them.  You will find a key
  if you operate the knife on the left chair in the lounge.  This key is
  used to open the cabinet in the master bedroom.  In the cathedral, say
  "SPECAN HEAFOD ABRAXAS" to the plaster head.
