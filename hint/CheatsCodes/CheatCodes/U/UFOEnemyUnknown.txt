        After playing the game for a while and building up your stores save
        the game.  Now quit the game and go into your current save game
        directory and make a copy of the base.dat file.  Now boot the game
        back up and sell everything you have (if you need money) or transfer
        stores (not ships or personel) to other bases.  Now save the game
        again and quit.  Next replace the base.dat file with a the copy of
        the original that you made earlier.  Now when you go back to the 
        game you'll have all the money from the sales plus all the equipment
        you sold.  And, if you transferred anything those items will arrive
        shortly.  Continue the above procedure as often as you like.
