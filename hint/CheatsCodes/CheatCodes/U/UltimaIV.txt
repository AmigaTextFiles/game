                                 ULTIMA IV
                                ===========

I have changed some of the details in this doc because I am currently
playing this game amongst others, and in my opinion some of what this guy
has to say is utter crap!

                                                               Voodoo Dreamer
                                                              ----------------

                       NOW SOME STUFF ON GATE PHASES
                      -------------------------------

PHASE   VIRTUE     TOWN         STONE    MANTRE    PARTY MEMBER

1      HONESTY     MOONGLOW     BLUE     AHM       MARIAN
2      COMPASSION  BRITAIN      YELLOW   MU        IOLO
3      VALOR       JHELOM       RED      RA        GEOFFREY
4      JUSTICE     YEW          GREEN    BEH       JAANA
5      SACRIFICE   MINOC        ORANGE   CAH       KATRINA
6      HONOR       TRINSIC      PURPLE   SUMM      DUPRE
7      SPIRITUAL   SKARA BRAE   WHITE    OM        SHAMINO
8      HUMILITY    MAGINCIA     BLACK    LUM       <UNKNOWN>

THIS IS FROM THE GATE SPELL, I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY HOW THE MOON GATES WORK.
ONLY THAT THEY DO. ONE LAST THING ON THE MOONGATES. IF YOU GOTO THE MOONGLOW
GATE AND STAND ON THE GATE, WHEN THE TWO MOONS GO DARK, SEARCH AND YOU WILL
FIND THE BLACK STONE.

I KNOW THAT THERE HAS BEEN MORE THEN ONE SPELL LIST WRITTEN BUT THIS ONE WILL
INCLUDE THE HINTS IN SPELL CASTING THAT THE GAME WILL GIVE YOU.

LADDER DOWN SILK, MOSS            (DE)  MOVES PARTY DOWN ONE IN DUNGEONS

  A FEW NOTES ON THE SPELLS. AWAKEN ONLY WAKES UP ONE MEMBER AT A TIME.



THERE ARE FOUR ENERGY BARRIERS:

(S)LEEP, (P)OISON, (F)IRE, AND (L)IGHTNING
(LIGHTNING IS IMPASSABLE, THE OTHERS CAST THOSE SPELLS UPON THE MEMBER
ENTERING)
YOU WILL BE PROMPTED FOR WHICH ONE YOU WANT.
IN CASTING OR DISPELLING A ENERGY BARRIER YOU MUST STAND NEXT TO THE
SPOT YOU WANT TO CAST IT.

JINX SPELL WILL CAUSE A RANDOM NUMBER OF THE ENEMY TO FIGHT AMONGST THEM
SELVES.. SEEMS TO WORK BEST ON GREMLINS.

KILL SPELL WONT KILL TWISTERS OR REAPERS ON THE FIRST SHOT.
SOMETIMES OTHER MONSTERS CAN AVOID THE KILL SPELL BUT THESE ARE THE ONES
THAT DO IT EVERYTIME.
TREMOR IS GREAT FOR A MASS KILL, IT EFFECTS ALL TYPES OF ENEMIES!

QUICK GIVES RANDOM QUICKNESS EACH TURN, MAGES SEEM TO BENEFIT MOST FROM
THIS SPELL.

SOME LISTS STATE THAT YOU NEED MORE THEN ONE ITEM TO MAKE THE SPELL LIKE:
QUICK NEEDS TWO BLOODMOSS TO WORK.. THIS IS ALL UNTRUE IN EVERY CASE!

THE MOON GATES WORK LIKE THIS. WHEN THE GATE APPEARS IT STAYS FOR TWO PHASES
OF THE MOON ON THE FIRST PHASE IT WILL MOVE YOU TO THAT NUMBER GATE - 1 (IN
THE CASE OF IF YOU ARE AT MOONGLOW, IT WILL TAKE YOU TO GATE 8 (MAGINCIA)).

ON THE SECOND PHASE IT WILL TAKE YOU TO THE GATE NUMBER + ONE. (IF YOUR IN
MAGINCIA, YOU'LL GOTO MOONGLOW).





1]  GET THE CHARACTER REF. SHEET AND THE TWO OTHER DOC FILES THAT GO WITH
    THE GAME.  READ THEM!



2]  SETTING UP YOUR CHARACTER.
    ACCORDING TO RICHARD, NICE GUYS WILL HAVE AN EASIER TIME.
    IN OTHER WORDS, THE GAME KEEPS TRACK OF HOW NICE A GUY YOU ARE. SO, WHEN
    ANSWERING THE SET-UP QUESTIONS, KEEP KINDNESS & HONOR IN MIND.



3]  FRIENDS
    THERE ARE PEOPLE ALONG THE WAY WHO WILL JOIN YOUR PARTY.
    I SOON GOT TIRED OF TALKING TO EVER DAMN PERSON.
    HERE ARE THE NAMES TO LOOK FOR AND IN WHAT TOWN YOU MAY FIND THEM.
    THEY MAY NOT CHOOSE TO JOIN YOUR PARTY, BUT THAT'S UP TO THEM.
    IOLO (BRITAN), JAANA (YEW), JULIA (MINOC), SHAMINO (SKARA BRAE),
    GEOFFIEX (JHELOM), CATHERINE AND DUPRE.
    USUALLY THEY WILL BE STANDING WITH THREE OTHER PEOPLE AROUND A FIRE OR
    SOMETHING.  YOU WILL NEED ALL THE FRIENDS YOU CAN GET.



4]  DUNGEONS
    WRONG, SHAME, DECEIT, ETC.
    SECRET ENTRANCE TO 8TH LEVEL OF DUNGEONS IS FOUND BEHIND LB'S CASTLE.

  -> A TRICK I USE IS GOING DOWN TO THE EIGHTH LEVEL THROUGH LB CASTLE AND
    FINDING A CRYSTAL BALL TO RAISE ME.  THEN I GET KILLED AND BROUGHT BACK
    BY LB.  I LOSE MY MONEY, BUT EVERYONE IS FULLY HEALED AND I KEEP THE
    EXPERIENCE & RAISED STATS.

  -> ANOTHER SLY MOVE IF A MEMBER OF YOUR PARTY IS DEAD, IS TO DO THIS:
   1. GET $300 FOR TREASURE ROOM IN LB CASTLE (IF POISONED SLEEP AT SEER).
   2. GET PERSON REINCARNATED AT HEALTH.
   3. HAVE HPS RESTORED BY LB.
   4. Or just go to Lord British and ask of his health.
      He will ask of yours.  Say that you are not fine (NO).
      He will return all characters to full health (and I think raise the
      dead)

 -> IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU HAVE TO WIN A BATTLE WITH A WATER MONSTER
    BEFORE A PIRATE SHIP WILL COME BY.  TRY IT AND SEE IF IT WORKS.
    SHIPS ARE FUN.



5]  TOWNS
    HERE IS A PARTIAL LISTING OF TOWNS:  PAWS, BRITAN, TRINSIC, YEW, ABBY,
    MINOC, VIRTUE, MAGINCIA, AND LYCAEUM.
    AGAIN, I HAVEN'T BEEN DOING A GREAT JOB OF WRITING THINGS DOWN,
    THESE ARE ONLY THINGS I AM REMEMBERING.

    SPECIAL TOWNS:  SKAR BRAE SELLS HERBS USED FOR SPELLS!
    -------------:  VIRTUE SELLS TORCHES, GEMS, AND KEYS!
        - - -    :  PAWS SELLS HORSES ($100 * members of party.)



6]  SHRINES:
    I have not found it particularly useful to meditate at shrines as a
    regular past-time.
    When you visit the Seer ask him of the virtues.  If you are
    successfully proficient in one he will tell you to go to it's shrine
    and meditate for three cycles.
    Do this and you will achieve this portion of your avatarhood.
    As you complete these philosophical (?) achievements a Anhk will form
    in the top line of your stats.
    If you do an evil thing, like attacking towne guards you will loose all
    but one of your portions. (You will have to attack guards at least once.)



6]  RUNES: (SAME AS SHRINES)
    HONOR      - TRINSIC
    SACRIFICE  - MINOC
    LOVE       - ABBEY
    JUSTICE    - YEW
    COMPASSION - BRITAN
    TRUTH      - LYCAEUM
    THE RUNES ARE FOUND BY (S)EARCHING AN AREA (USUALLY A BATH ROOM,
    INN ROOM, CLOSET AREA, END OF HALLWAY, JAIL CELL,  ETC).

    THE BELL OF COURAGE IS FOUND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE OCEAN (A WATER ISLAND)



7]  SECRET DOORS:
    SECRET DOORS (AND YOU WILL BE VERY SURPRISED TO SEE HOW MANY THERE ARE!)
    ARE EASILY SPOTTED BY A LITTLE DOT (HI-RES) IN BETWEEN THE BRICKWORK IN A
    WALL.  SIMPLY WALK THROUGH THE WALL WITH THE DOT. THERE ARE SEVERAL SECRET
    DOORS IN LB'S CASTLE AND IN THE TOWNS.
    (LB: GUARD'S ROOM, ABOVE HEALING, PRISON CELL, ETC)



8]  ADVENTURE TIPS:

 A] MONEY:
    GETTING MONEY FAST MAY HELP YOU GET SOME GOOD ARMOUR AND BETTER
    YOUR INITIAL CHANCES FOR SURVIVAL.  AN EASY WAY OF GETTING ABOUT $500
    IS BY OPENING ALL THE CHESTS FOUND IN THE SECRET ROOM (GUARDS ROOM) IN
    LB'S CASTLE.

 -] SPEND MONEY CAREFULLY, BUT DON'T CARRY IT AROUND.  YOU WILL LOSE IT IF
    YOU DIE.  BUT YOU'RE ABLE TO KEEP YOUR WEAPON & ARMOUR (SO INVEST THE $).
    You can also keep magical ingredients and spells when resurrected, this
    is a very wise investment and stocks of ingredients and spells should
    be topped up regularly.

 -] SELLING THINGS BACK TO THE DEALERS IS A BAD IDEA AS THEY BUY IT BACK FOR
    1/2 PRICE.

 -] BE CAREFUL WHEN FIGHTING THIEVES, ROGUES, OR PIRATES AS THEY WILL STEAL
    YOUR MONEY.


 B] POISON:
    POISON IS THE MOST COMMON REASON FOR DEATH.  LEARN WHAT MARSHLAND LOOKS
    LIKE AND AVOID IT!  REMEMBER THAT YOU CAN HEAL YOURSELF BY (H)OLE UP AND
    CAMP.  TO CURE (SPELL C) POISON, MIX B & C (YOU HAVE ABOUT TWO CURES TO
    START OUT WITH).  ANOTHER WAY TO CURE POISON IS TO ALSO GET SLEEPED BY A
    TRAP OR MAGIC FLOOR (SEER IN LB CASTLE).  OR YOU CAN ALWAYS PAY $100 AT A
    TOWN HEALER.

 -] AVOID SPIDERS IN DUNGEONS AS THEY WILL POISON YOU.
    Lets not forget the rats and snakes (snakes can throw their poison!)


->  BE WARY OF TRAPS IN DUNGEONS (FIGHT MODE) - YOU CAN STEP SOMEWHERE AND A
    WALL MIGHT OPEN UP OR FIRE MAY SPRING UP, OR A BRIDGE MIGHT DISAPPEAR.





                          FIRST STEP IN ULTIMA IV

                                VISIT TOWNS


WHILE IN THE TOWNS TALK TO EVERYONE.  AFTER A BIT YOU WILL DEVELOP A NEAT
KNACK FOR SPOTTING THE MAIN WORDS IN WHAT THEY SAY SO YOU CAN GET EVERYTHING
OUT OF THEM WITH LITTLE TROUBLE.  (EG: I WATCH THE SEAS.  SEAS?  YES, ETC)
[1] FIND PEOPLE TO JOIN YOUR PARTY.
[2] ASK PEOPLE ABOUT THE RUNES (USUALLY A RUNE TO EACH TOWN).
[3] ASK PEOPLE ABOUT THE MANTRAS (SHRINES ARE USELESS WITHOUT THEM).





                           RUNES/MANTRA LISTING
                          ----------------------

SPIRIT          : LBC      : TREASURE ROOM (NE CORNER)

                               ASSORTED TIPS
                              ---------------

[] DON'T RISK BEING SUNK BY PIRATE SHIPS.  SAIL UP AND KILL CREW.
[] USE HORSEPOWER AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE (ESP. AFTER YOU'VE BEEN PLAYING
   AWHILE).  THIS IS BECAUSE THE GAME REMEMBERS EVERY TIME YOU FLEE FROM
   BATTLE.  THIS WAY YOU CAN OUTRUN THE ENEMY BEFORE YOU HAVE TO FIGHT THEM.
[] IF YOU CAN'T WALK THROUGH A SPACE (MAGIC SQUARE) THEN DISPEL  THE MAGIC!
[] YOU CAN HOLE-UP AND CAMP WHILE IN THE OCEAN BY JUST EXITING AND H.
   THEN B.
   (NOTE: IF YOU'RE AMBUSHED AND WIN THE BATTLE, YOU HAVE TO GET THE CHEST
   BEFORE YOU CAN REBOARD)
[] GIVE BLOOD WHILE AT THE HEALERS AS THIS MAKES YOU A NICE GUY.
[] GIVE MONEY TO BEGGARS AS THIS WILL TOO. (Can also lead to getting info.)
[] DON'T "APPROPRIATE" CHESTS THAT AREN'T YOURS (SIGH) AS IT WILL COUNT
   AGAINST YOU.

[] WHEN BUYING SPICES YOU CAN PAY ONLY $1 FOR THEM, BUT THAT TOO MAKES YOU
   LOOK BAD (ROTTEN ISN'T IT?).
[] BE SURE TO GO DOWN A WHIRLPOOL IF YOU GET THE CHANCE.  THIS IS ABOUT THE
   ONLY WAY YOU CAN GET A BOAT INTO THE SEA IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CONTINENT.
   (AND THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN GET TO THE CITY OF COVE)
[] TO GET A SEXTANT CHOOSE OPTION D AT THE THIEVES GUILD ($900).
[] HORSES ARE $100 EACH (# MEMBERS).
[] SOMETIMES (MAYBE MY IMAGINATION) BUT YOU DON'T SEE THE SECRET DOORS
   (DOTS) THE FIRST TIME.  A PEER INTO A GEM OR JUST RE-ENTERING THE ROOM
   MAY CLEAR THIS UP.
[] THE MOONS WILL CHANGE BY THEMSELVES (NOT ANY RELATION TO COMMANDS), SO IF
   YOU'RE WAITING ON A MOONDOOR, DON'T JUST SIT THERE AND HIT SPACE + REPT.
   THIS WILL ADVANCE YOUR # OF MOVES AND ALSO GIVE MONSTERS A CHANCE TO BE
   BORN AND FIND YOU.
[] IF A MEMBER OF THE PARTY IS POISONED, ONE WAY OF FIXING HIM IS TO LET
   HIM OPEN ALL THE CHEST YOU FIND.  THIS WAY HE WILL HAVE A BETTER CHANCE
   OF GETTING SLEPT (THUS CURING THE POISON).
   Another natty way, and surer is to cast the CURE spell at him.
[] THE BUCC'S DEN (LOVE THE NAME!) WEAPON SHOP SELLS MAGIC BOWS & WANDS.
   ($2000 AND $5000 RESPECTIVELY)
[] TORNADOES SEEM TO ONLY MOVE YOU A COUPLE OF PLACES + HURT YOU.





                                  STONES
                                 --------

STONES ARE FOUND IN THE DUNGEONS (VARIOUS LEVELS).
YOU SEEM TO HAVE TO HAVE THE RUNE FIRST BEFORE YOU CAN GET THE STONE.
THEY ARE ON ALTARS (PEER).
YOU WILL NEED TO GET THEM!
