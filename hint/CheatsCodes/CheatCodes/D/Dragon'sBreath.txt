                              DRAGON'S BREATH
                             =================


                                 MONTH ONE
                                -----------

Cast the following spell on dragon:
        2 * Rasgon-rind and heat
        2 * Churl-normal and heat
        3 * Arolig-normal, heat and ¹/4 condense.
        2 * Mionacal-grind and condense.
        7 * Haloros-cut and condense.
        7 * Igele-normal and heat.
        2 * Churl-normal and heat.
        1 * Acrus-mix and heat.

Although this uses up a lot of ingredients, it makes your dragon unbeatable
in a duel and devastating when attacking villages - it can kill over 1000
people in any one attack!  The dragon will have full speed, strength,
wisdom, eyesight and health.

Place two eggs in incubation on full heat.  Look in books at ongoing
battles, then record them on paper; now go to the map of Anrea.  Send your
dragon to a town with a population of about 900 on a conquer and keep
mission (Hanmon / Olom are good).  Do not buy anything from the traders
yet.  End your turn.





                                 MONTH TWO
                                -----------

Go to the map of Anrea, then return the dragon to the lair and inspect
conquered villages and towns.  Cast the following spell on town:
        3 * Tius-normal and heat.
        4 * Churl-normal and heat.
        2 * Acrus-grind and condense.
        1 * Churf-normal and heat.

This spell should make the village or town into a city with over 1000
inhabitants.  If more churl is added it will become even bigger, always
remember to calm the mixture down if it becomes too potent; chife is very
useful.  Raise the taxes to full and repeat the spell if desired., perhaps
twice.  Check in the library to see if your dragon is guarding a piece of
the talisman.  If he is note the name of the town or city.  End your turn.





                                MONTH THREE
                               -------------

Forget about the city, it should grow without your help, sprouting towns
all by itself.  Meanwhile, send out your mega-dragon to beat up other
towns.  For example if your city is at war with someone else, go out and
kill that village or town.  If any town with a population greater than 1000
is at war, send your dragon on a return after task mission to conquer the
enemies.  The reward depends on how badly the enemy has been hit.  With
this dragon, the whole town is usually knocked out completely, with huge
loss of life - sometimes the whole population is wiped out!





                           THE FOLLOWING MONTHS
                          ----------------------

Once dragons have hatched, try to find a trader who can sell you the right
ingredients for a mega-dragon.  Keep using spells on new towns formed from
the original, soon you could have as many as 30 tax-giving cities.It's
possible to have an income of up to 1000 gelds per month.  With this sort
of income you're sailing.  Watch the health of your dragons, and, unless
you know of any good spells for eggs or humans, don't waste ingredients on
them.  Soon you should have an invincible army of eight mega-dragons.  If
you attack all the other townes, the other two players are in trouble.

Although the training missions are easy, they are usually a waste of time.
Just set zeal to medium and you can easily remove on average village.  If
zeal is set to high super-dragons usually wipe out the townes they are
attacking, instead of just conquering them.

Never avoid other player's dragons a you can always beat the hell out of
them and sometimes kill them - but keep your eye out for enemy dragons.

Soon you may be able to buy ingredients in enormous quantities; your
maximum is 99.
