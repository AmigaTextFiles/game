NOTES:

Statistics are in the following form -
STRENGTH / DEXTERITY / WISDOM / VITALITY / ANTIMAGIC / ANTIFIRE / HEALTH
                                                                / STAMINA /MANA

Resurrecting a champion keeps stats.  Reincarnating may lower or raise stats.

==============================================================================

  No monsters are encountered on this level.  You should choose your party
members carefully.  A well-balanced party may get you farther than four of the
most powerful champions of the same type.  Use this level to practice wielding
weapons and casting spells.  It will give you an idea of which champions you
may wish to bring along on your adventure.  If you have no idea who to take,
try these four:  Zed, Tiggy, Azizi, and Wuuf.

  Be sure to monitor your champions' stats, fatigue, and hunger on this level
as well.  Notice how much food and water it takes to restore stats, and bed
down for a while to monitor stat regeneration.  Food and water are plentiful
in the early dungeon levels, but become very scarce as you go on.  Conserve!
Make a note on your map where you may have left food so that you can return
there in a pinch.

  As you encounter monsters in the lower levels, be sure to have all of your
party members participate in battles.  Your champions experience levels raise
in proportion to how much they accomplish or attempt.  Plan team efforts
before battling.

  Conserve torches.
  Use light spells when possible, and store your torches away for those times
when MANA is important.

  Scrolls themselves have no use, other than to provide guidance and
instructions.  You may wish to use the scrolls as path markers.

  On this level, fill your water flask(s) and find/store all food.

  If one of your champions dies, be sure to pick up their bones and equipment
if possible.

  Learn which champion can cast which spells.  Eventually, you will notice
which spells/potions kill each type of monster easily.

  Learn which weapons work best with which champions.

==============================================================================
 
  Screamers make for a good meal.  Mummies are dangerous, and you must hit and
move in order to kill them this early on (keep in mind where you saw an altar).
A couple of things to note on battles....closed gates can be an asset, and
what is dangerous to your party is also dangerous to monsters.

  Recover any thrown weapons after a battle.  If some are missing, a monster
may have picked it up.  Find and kill it.

  Do not be stopped by closed/locked doors.  Where there is a will, there is a
way.  Sound is as important as sight, so turn up the volume!

  On this level you will encounter two seemingly impenetrable barriers:  a
door and a force field.  They have a lot to do with each other, and one of them
can be violated.

CAST YOUR INFLUENCE - This is a two-part obstacle.
                      You must use two distinct aspects of your champions
                      abilities in the correct order; the first is a spell.

GENERAL NOTES: Save the game position to disk regularly, especially before
               dangerous moves and after a tough portion of the game.  If your
               champion has not enough MANA to chant a spell in total, chant as
               many syllables as possible and then sleep.  When you awaken you
               can chant the remainder of the spell.
               You may pre-chant a spell for each champion and keep them at the
               ready in case you run into some surprising situations.  You
               should also know by now that objects/weapons to be used must be
               placed in right hand.  Best use of chests is to store one type
               of item together in each chest (food in one, clothing and armour
               in another, etc).

VAULT - Don't horde -all- the money you find.  Key word in the phrase is
        'cast'. Remember other means of opening doors besides keys, buttons,
        switches, or pads.  Some things cannot simply be taken, but must
        instead be 'exchanged'.

TIME - Hit and run 4 left, 2 forward. Recall one aspect of CAST YOUR INFLUENCE.
       Trap door works just like other encountered, except the trigger might
       not be where you expect it to be.

GUARDIANS - Following the chest is one way of acquiring it.  Think about what
            you do with a mirror and don't leave the immediate area without
            using it.

MATRIX - Remember, walls are important to notice.  Use object you found upon
         entering this dungeon level or you may become a bit disoriented.

GEM - Pits are the pits, so lose some of your less important objects.  Again,
      watch the walls.


GENERAL NOTES: It is often helpful to find a small room close by when you need
               to sleep; simply close the door and your party will be
               sufficiently safe.
               Many times you will move so quickly that you will pass right by
               wall switches which open doors and secret panels.
               Remember that running and closing a gate may be the ticket to
               killing monster parties.  Doors and gates closing on a being
               will cause much damage.

  A second staircase is around somewhere which leads back to previous level.
There is a room here which contains Screamers.  Open door, kill Screamers, get
food.  Close door, re-open door and Screamers are there again.  Nice food
supply.

  Purple Worms are just as dangerous to you as that first mummy you encountered
in level two.  Circle and hit them.  Move, hit, move.

  Be sure to examine aqueducts.

  Don't take short cut the first time.  Come back to it later.

  If you find the 'prisoner' you will be near staircase leading down a level.
Heed the writing or you will have more work to do.  As long as prisoner is
imprisoned, so are you.

   Bow raises Ninja level very slowly.  Best use it later when you find slayer
arrows.

  Lock Picks are worthless.

open.
        Left hand corridor: After passing through the gate you will find a
door on the left.  Nearly opposite is a metal ring set in the wall, press
this to open a secret passage.  Towards the end of the passage is another
secret passage opened with a button on the wall.
        Stuck between two gates with a blue haze turning on and off - cast
a spell to open the gate then take off armour to move faster and run through
the haze.

staircase leading up.  This is the way to the restricted area on level 5 in
the pit room.
        Do not enter the transporter saying "Ha Ha Ha", you will end up
back on level 5.
        Towards the end of the level is a passage with a lever at one end
and a gate and transporter at the other.  Ignore the transporter - it only
takes you to an earlier part of the level.  To enter the room you must throw
the lever and move quickly to the gate and enter before it closes.

        Although all the following information guides you through level 7,
on first entering the level you can only open one gate (with a Ra key).
The other three Ra keys and other keys must be obtained from lower levels.
        `THE TOMB OF THE FIRESTAFF' - after passing through the first 3
doors that require Ra keys, you ill come across 4 rooms on the right.  Only
one of these can be opened with the turquoise key that you will find on this
level.  A lift of items to be found within these rooms was given in an
earlier part of this guide (I hope, I only copied this document from the
beginning of `CONDENSED MAD MAN'S RAMBLINGS' Part One).
        `DANGER, ENTER WITH CAUTION' - First you will find alcoves that may
prove rewarding.  As you turn right along a corridor with short passages on
the right, a button will be found on the left wall (three and a half
passages along).  Press this button to open a passage on your return
journey.
        In the room at the end of corridor will be found a Turquoise key
under some ashes.  To the left is a button that opens a passage at the end
of which are some scrolls and a Ra key.
        On your alcove to the room with the alcoves you will find a passage
has opened in front of you.  Enter, turn right, left and seven paces
forward to find a button on your left.  Press the button and walk back the
way you came to find the winged key has been revealed.  Travel down the
corridor, it is a direct route to level 13.  Open pan and return.
        Return to the `DANGER, ENTER WITH CAUTION' door.  Opposite is
another corridor at the end of which are some very useful items.  Leave
this corridor and open the door on your left with the Ra key.  Walk along
this corridor for some distance taking many turns to find the Ra key.
Don't hang around when you find the firestaff  You now need the Power Gem
from level 14.
        Ruby key opens `ENTER WITH CAUTION' door.
        Master key opens door to retrieve Firestaff.



                                Level Eight
                              --------------

Items to be found:      Delta                   Rabbit's foot
                        4 FUL bombs             2 Chests

                        Torch                   Copper coin


        Level 8 consists of a very large room with a number of secret
passages, also numerous pits.
        Around the wall you will find a short corridor with a chest and two
holes in the wall.  The holes fire fireballs which pass through various
blue hazes and travel around the room.  At the start of this passage you
will find a button on the wall.  Press it to open a secret panel behind the
blue haze on your right.  Press the green button behind this panel to
switch off the haze and thus stop the fireball from hitting you as you
search this level.  If you stand with your back to the fireballs and walk
forwards you come to the end of the wall.  Step around this to the other
side and take a further 10 steps forwards to find a key in front of you.
        One of the buttons around the wall will reveal a series of passages
culminating in what seems to be an endless passage.  In effect you are
being transported back to the start of the passage.  Stand with your back
to the beginning and take 26 paces forwards, then turn right and wait for a
moment for a panel to open.  You will find a gate behind which is a button
on the left wall.  Press to open a secret room.
        One passage you will find will end in a gate (you should have a
solid key on you to open it).  At the end of the passage you will find a
skull on the wall.  Use the skeleton key that you found in the chest to
open a secret panel.  You will find a number of these in the levels to
come.  Always open them to reveal access to the master staircase which
begins on level 8 and finishes on level 14., opening on all the levels in
between.
        If you drop down one of the pits in the room you will find a series
of corridors. Search them to find another pit at the bottom of which is a
Yew staff.




                                Level Nine

                        Green gem


        `WHEN IS A ROCK NOT A ROCK' - Take one step left and walk through
the wall.  It is a good idea to mark this place in case you need to return
in a hurry.  Turning left will bring you into a gated room.  Search for a
button to open a secret room.
        A short distance after you pass the wall you can walk through, on
your right, is an invisibly field which turns you through 180.  This can
be confusing, so don't rush.
        After passing through a gate, keep to the left while searching for
a button to open a secret room.
        The next gate you come to will lead to some downward stairs, ignore
these, there is nothing in the room below.
        You will find an unopenable gate with a chest beyond and a lever on
the right.  The lever opens a pit dropping the chest into a room below
(mentioned earlier).  With the pit closed, explore the passage to your
right to find an upward staircase.  Go up and you will find a pit to your
right which will will drop you behind the gate.  Search for a button before
dropping down the pit.
        `WHAT IS UNDER FOOT IS SOON OVERHEAD' - the passage ahead has 3
floor buttons on each side.  As you step on each, a fireball is fired at
you.  You must place an item on each floor button moving away quickly to
avoid being hit (this only needs to be done on one side).
        Two exits are found on the other side of the floor buttons.  The
left hand one takes you through a series of passages and rooms at the end
of which you will find a button to open a secret room.
        `LIGHTER THAN A FEATHER' - Corbamite weighs nothing, use it to open
the gate by placing it in the alcove.
        The last gated room on this level contains an important item.



                                 Level Ten
                                -----------


Items to be found:      2 keys of B             Hard cleave

                        Leg plate               Foot plate
                        Magnifier


        `BEWARE OF MY TWISTED HUMOUR, THE DECEIVER, THE SNAKE' - you must
snake your way through the pillars, going first to the extreme left, the
right, left, and right again, to find an opening on your left.  Which ever
passage you use the key of B to open, they both end up at the same point.
Check the items dropped by anything you kill, to find a second key of B to
get you out.
        `ZOOOOOM' - as you step on the first pad you will be moved around
the room until you successfully step off into the passage on the other
side.  Precise timing is required to get off the moving pads.  Halfway
round the room you will find a blue haze with a space beside it.  If you
decide to enter this space, be careful, as the haze will transport you to
the very beginning of the level.
        The next gate you come to opens into a large irregularly shaped
room.  If you press the button just after the gate you will release
monsters that are held in fields around the room.  If you walk straight
ahead of you, you will come to monsters guarding a button to open a short
secret passage to the right.
        As you leave this room, the fields containing the monsters will be
turned off releasing them.  As you travel along the corridor you will find
a gated room on the left, enter and search for a button to open a secret
panel.  This room may be transported back to a later stage.
        A monster will drop a skeleton key when killed in the passages to
come, so look out for it.
        Two secret rooms are to be found in the following corridors so
check in the following corridors so check the walls and back track to find
the rooms after pressing buttons which have no obvious immediate effect.
        You will soon come to two gates almost side by side, these should
be closed to allow you time to plan ahead, and when threatened, to run back
and fight from.
        Further along the passage you will find another two gates a little
further apart than the previous two, they should be closed as before.
        A room will be found with a brown button on the wall, this button
transports you back to the room mentioned earlier.  This could be useful if
trapped by some pursuing monsters.

        As you enter this level you will be confronted with a rectangular

moves you between them.  Figure 1 shows transporters (T), a staircase (S),
a gate (G), and a chest (C).  W marks the location of the secret panel

which is your key out.  As you move around the rooms you must find a key to
open the gate in room number 4.  This gate will not open immediately, step
back and wait for a moment.  Open the chest and take out the key.  This
must be turned in the keyhole on the wall of one of the rooms to open the
panel and allow you out.
        When you finally escape the rooms, go down the corridor to the
right and through the gate.  You are in the passage with many holes in the
wall.  Go to the end of the passage, you will find a useful item.  When you
pick up this item the corridor will fill with poison gas.  Have plenty of
VI options handy and wait until the gas has gone while drinking the porions
to stay alive.  Once you have survived the gas, regain your strength
because the next step forwards will release gas further along and fire 2
poison darts at you.  Two more, more gas.  Be patient, let all the gas
clear and you will survive this puzzle.
        Search the next gated room to find a handy weapon.
        As you search further you will come to a short passage just around
a right turn with another short passage behind you on your left.  Step back
around the corner and wait a moment for the panel to open.  You will find a
button on the right wall where the panel was.  Press to reveal skeleton
key.
        You will come to a gate behind which are three gates.  On the floor
is a Cross key to open only one of them, they all lead to the same place.
You need to find copper coins in the passages to use later on.  The centre
door is probably the easiest to get through.  Search carefully for those
copper coins.  When you have emerged from your chosen passage, find the
exit gate (far right).  Search carefully in the corridors to come, for a
butt to open a secret room.
        Later you will come to double gates.  Beyond these is a left turn
leading to a gate after which you can use your skeleton key.
        `ENLARGE MY VIEW' - Use the magnifier to open a secret panel, step
on the pad to find the ruby key.

        At the end of the passage with the double gates is a room with 7
coin slots in the wall.  Copper coins will open wall alcoves containing
useful items (listed below).

        See figure 2.
        1)  VEN potion
        2)  FUL bomb
        3)  Green magic box, FUL bomb
        4)  2 Copper coins
        5)  Cross key
        6)  Chest of food
        7)  Green magic box

        Open number 4 first to reveal more copper coins.  If you don't have
enough coins for all the slots, open 5, take the cross key and walk all the
way back to  the start of the three gates where you first used a cross key,
and explore another passage for more copper coins.



                               Level Twelve
                              --------------

Items to be found:      Greave of Darc          Shield of Darc
                        Plate of Darc           Poleyn of Darc
                        Helm of Darc            Helm of Lyte
                        Morning star            Slayer
                        Snake staff             2 FUL bombs
                        VEN potion              Boots of speed
                        Torch                   Master key
                        Emerald key             Topaz key
                        Skeleton key


        At the end of the first corridor is a large room.  Tow paces right
into room are a series of pits opened and closed by the pressure pad you
just stepped on.  You can see a broken black line when the pit is open.
        Taking the right hand exit from the pit room you pass a gate
requiring a key to open.  Keep to the left and enter a small room, press
the large button found here on the left in an alcove and return to the pit
room.  Now take the other exit, ignore the gate on the right and enter
another larger room.  In the middle of this room is a small room with a key
in it.  Take the key and return to the room you passed which required a key
(mentioned earlier).  After this door has been opened, the monster within
must be killed to make it drop a key, dropping it down a pit in the other
room is advised.  You must then climb down to retrieve the key.  Use the
rope to get down, if you picked it up on an earlier level, if not, you will
have to drop down.



                              Level Fourteen
                             ----------------


Items to be found:      Square key              Eye of time
                        Calista                 Numerous coins
                        Blue gems               Green gem


        Use the winged key to gain access to the Dragon level.  This is
aptly named as it is guarded by only one dragon, which is the most
resilient monster you will ever encounter.
        Travel along the corridor until you find a lever on the wall - this
opens a panel to the main room where you will find the dragon, to be
careful!
        Just as you enter the room you will find a pile of ashes under
which is the square key.  Carefully move to the left of the room where you
will find the door to open with the key.  Near the door are scattered a
number of items, one of which (the eye of time) could prove extremely
useful.  Pass through the door.  in front of you is a power gem, encased in
a field which must be broken.  Use a ZO KATH RA spell to get the gem.
When the gem is free, hold the firestaff up and click the mouse to join the
two.  You now have the most powerful weapon to be found within the dungeon.
        The door on your left is opened by placing a silver coin in the
slot provided - there is a coin on the floor to the left of the door.  This
room only contains an alter of rebirth but is very useful for evading the
dragon.
        You will find that the staircase you entered down is now closed.
You must go to the staircase at the opposite end of the dragon room, this
will take you to level 13.



                              Level Thirteen
                             ----------------


Items to be found:      The Hellion flamitt


        You are now near the end of your quest.  You must get rid of the
demons first.  The passage you walk along cannot be entered by any
creatures, including Lord Chaos.  You can use magic at range.  The fire
elements can be done away with by repeated fusing with the Firestaff.
        The best pace to take on Lord Chaos is in the room on the far left.
        If you succeed you will be rewarded with an impressive show.





What kills the Creatures: As you get stronger in your wizard skills you will
                          be able to make stronger version of the same spell
                          as the creatures show up they each take a stronger
                          version of the same potion and it may take more than
                          one to kill it.

  To advance Ninjas a level, stand in a hall and throw all your weapons, then
get them and repeat.
This also works with magic and Fighter levels: Cast a spell at the air, or
                                               slash and bash until you gain a
                                               level.



There is nothing wrong with equipping your characters with cursed armour (so
says the person who wrote into the magazine).
This will cause you to have incredibly fewer injuries from the enemy.
Apparently this is why the enemy knights have such a low armour class.
