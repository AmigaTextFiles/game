        Start as normal, then press GREEN, YELLOW, BLUE, and RED BUTTONS
        simultaneously.  Now press FORWARD and REVERSE together, then
        GREEN, YELLOW, and BLUE BUTTONS.  A whooshing sound activates the
        cheat mode.  To skip levels, push all the buttons as well as
        FORWARD and REVERSE, but don't press pause!
