        For infinite lives, pause the game and type "IREM".  Also, you can
        press 'N' to skip to the next level.  At the end of a level, while
        the next one is loading, hold down the left mouse button, 'DEL', and
        'HELP'.  The screen should flash, now use a key to skip levels (not
        sure what key).  You may have to hold the 'SHIFT' while you type
        "IREM".
