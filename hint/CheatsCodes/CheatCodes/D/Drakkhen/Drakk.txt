DRAKKEN

Create a new set of characters using procedure described in the manual, but
with the following changes. When you are asked for the first name, type
SUPERVISOR and press Return. Now enter a normal name and continue the
creation process. When you use this team of characters, the game works as
usual except that when you press F10, all wounds are healed and dead
characters are ressurected.

Info magazine says: When the program asks you for first character type
31415927, hit Return then type SUPERVISOR. Then give your character a name.

All armor, treasure and weapons inside palaces are restocked every time you
enter. Send the strongest character in to grab the equipment, then distribute
it amoung your band. If you need some quick gold, do this repeatedly, then
go see the weaponsmith.
