                               DRAGON'S LAIR
                              ===============


                                 DISK ONE
                                ----------


                               Drawbridge(S)
                              ---------------

Swing the sword as the tentacles appear and approach you. As they dodge away,
quickly push UP to climb out of the hole.



                                   Room
                                  ------

Push RIGHT immediately after the door flashes, which is once the 'DRINK ME'
sign has flashed.





                                 DISK TWO
                                ----------


                                   Cave
                                  ------

If entered from the right, move LEFT-RIGHT-LEFT as soon as the steps flash. Go
the opposite way if entering from the left hand side.



                                   Room
                                  ------

Execute the following moves once the tentacle drops down :
If door is on inner, right hand side:- FIRE, UP, RIGHT, DOWN, LEFT,  UP
If door is on inner,  left hand side:- FIRE, UP, LEFT,  DOWN, RIGHT, UP





                                DISK THREE
                               ------------


                                 Whirlpool
                                -----------

When Dirk's boat approaches the whirlpool, go to the side with space to pass,
either LEFT or RIGHT. There are 4 whirlpools and the sides alternate, so your
moves will be either LEFT RIGHT LEFT RIGHT, or the other way around.



                                   Rapids
                                  --------

If your first Whirlpool move was left, your first rapids move will also be left
and vice versa. After the whirlpools the sea goes red while the Rapids sign
flashes. Wait for the sea to turn blue again - then, as soon as Dirk's boat
appears (from the right) go LEFT - UP - Pause - UP.



                               Cauldron Room
                              ---------------

SLASH as soon as the Dragon's head appears - not before. Don't be tricked by
the Cauldron boiling over.





                                 DISK FOUR
                                -----------


                               Bowling Alley
                              ---------------

Don't do anything until Dirk has appeared at the far end AND then jumped into
the alley AND the red ball has passed him. Then, AS SOON as the red ball passes
Dirk, jump DOWN towards yourself. Then DOWN again as each coloured ball passes,
6 down moves altogether.



                                  Knight
                                 --------

Very tricky - concentrate! If the Knight on the far end has his sword on the
RIGHT, you start LEFT (and vice versa.)

Your first move is made when the Knight's sword strikes the ground.
The next moves MUST all be made WHILE DIRK IS JUMPING the previous move.

Sword in right hand :- RIGHT, LEFT,  UP, LEFT,  RIGHT, LEFT,  RIGHT.
Sword in left  hand :- LEFT,  RIGHT, UP, RIGHT, LEFT,  RIGHT, LEFT.

Once a close-up of the knight appears, press FIRE. Enter it just before Dirk
lands on the floor.





                                 DISK FIVE
                                -----------


                          Bedroom With Stone Wall
                         -------------------------

Wait until the door has STOPPED FLASHING (important!) - then immediately go
UP - UP.



                              Treasure Vault
                             ----------------

As soon as you hear the pretty music, go TOWARDS the rocking Candelabra (either
LEFT or RIGHT) and catch it. The princess appears and says "Save me!"

Now do the following... if your first move was LEFT, then go immediately RIGHT
& DOWN.

If your first move was RIGHT, then go LEFT & DOWN.

Dirk now stands before a teetering jewelled pillar. Go DOWN.

The princess reappears and says "Use the magic sword." On the word "sword",
SLASH. The magic sword appears embedded in a stone.





                                 DISK SIX
                                ----------


                             The Final Battle
                            ------------------

As soon as you see Dirk standing in front of a blue pillar hiding from the
dragon, go DOWN. (He ducks and avoids the claws).

Before he ducks, he looks around. Observe which way he looks first (left or
right) and as soon as he has ducked, go the way he looked - LEFT or RIGHT.

He now stands before the Dragon. Don't do anything until he has drawn the magic
sword from the stone. Then WHILE THE DRAGON'S TAIL IS HOVERING OVER DIRK duck
DOWN. The tail slashes and misses. This is repeated two more times. Then Dirk
jumps towards the Dragon with sword at the ready. The INSTANT HE LANDS, SLASH.

And that is it.
