        When the title screen appears, type "AVALON".  The screen should
        flash.  You should have unlimited lives.  If that doesn't work, try
        the following:

        Start a two player game.  Make it as far as you can with player one.
        With player two, you must be able to make it as far as the fairy to
        collect your boots.  Now that you have gotten your boots, you are
        going backwards to where you started.  Push the third cactus on the
        way back, and a yellow pacman will appear.  Get it, now kill player
        two.  Continue playing with player one.  Every time player one dies,
        get the yellow pacman with player two and kill player two
        immediately.  As long as you keep getting the yellow pacman with
        player two, player one will never die.

        HINTS:

            LEVEL 1:    Run to the third fire hydrant, and when you get
                        there, jump over it and push it to the left.  This
                        will give you a blue hat that will make you
                        invulnerable to the little ghosts that fall from
                        planes.

            LEVEL 2:    Run to the third cactus, and push it to the left.
                        You will now be invulnerable for the entire level!

            LEVEL 3:    After getting your magic boots, push the third
                        cactus on the way back for a free life.

        -Jump on the roof of ghost's car to escape.
    
        -Only use powerpills when ghosts are in range, or else it is wasted.

        -When you reach the breaktime sign, jump when you are about 1 inch
         away, for a bonus (depending how high you are when the level ends)
