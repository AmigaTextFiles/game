        Pause the game when your health nears zero, then run your fingers
        along 'F1' through 'F7'.  You'll get 2000 healths, 4 keys, 4 goms,
        and you'll be transported to the next level. 

        Also, if you have 2 goms, you can call up a map of the level by
        pressing the 'F6' and/or 'F7' KEYS.  Press 'F5' and 'F6' together
        and you will be advanced to level 7.  Press 'DEL' to go to level 8
        press it again to go to level 9.
