                                 PAPERBOY
                                ==========

        A hundred points are scored for the successful delivery of a paper
into a mailbox or on a doormat.
        Fifty points are scored for picking up a bundle of news-papers -
this also resets the number of papers you have to eight.
        Bonus points are awarded for breaking windows, lamps and
gravestones and for knocking the lids off dustbins.
        Go for as many broken windows as possible, as these will build up
your bonus total which is added to your points total at the start of the
target course.
        Don't throw away your papers recklessly - make sure that you have
enough left for the deliveries before the next bundle pick-up.
        Don't ride over drains or manhole covers as these will cause you to
crash.
        Don't bump into anything that moves, as this will cause you to fall
off your bike - some hazards may be stopped in their tracks by hitting them
with a paper.
        If you deliver a paper to every house with a mailbox (subscriber),
you will score a perfect delivery and will be awarded an extra subscriber
on the following day.
        Don't hit the man in front of houses with mailboxes, otherwise you
will loose their subscription on the next day.
        If you fail to deliver a paper to a subscriber's house, then he
will cancel his subscription and will not be available on the following
days.

                             THE TARGET COURSE
                            -------------------

        250 points are scored for hitting a target.
        On the target course, ride flat out - do not slow down.  Use your
papers to hit only the targets - not points are scored for breaking the
orange blocks with your papers.
        Riding your bike over the ramps will replenish your supply of
papers.
        If you complete the course in time, the remaining time will be
converted into bonus points and added to your points total.
