        Use your scanner to pick up off-screen freeze capsules. In your own
        zone, hang around the goal mouth until someone takes a shot.  This
        should give you a chance to get the ball straight into the tunnel in
        the shortest possible time, while decreasing the risk of conceeding
        goals.
