        First make your score end in a three (by shooting the bubbles).
        Then hit 'P' to pause the game, then hit 'ESC', then click {No}
        when asked if you want to play again. This takes you to the title
        screen with drooling barbarian.  Now type the following:
        "KOM JE ILLEGAAL DOOR DE PLAAG DAN GRIJPT DE JUNGLE COMMAND JE IN
        DE KRAGG" (space in between each word), then hit Return.  Border
        should turn green.  Hit fire button to return to game and you will
        have infinite lives.  You must do this on Level 1 before killed for
        the first time.
