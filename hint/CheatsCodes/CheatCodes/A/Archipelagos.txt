                               ARCHIPELAGOS
                              ==============


Solve levels One and Two. Then press RETURN to select an Archipelago and type
8421 and press RETURN. Press RETURN again and you can select any Archipelago
between 1 - 9999.






Firstly, you have to remember that all the minion rocks have to be
connected by land to the monolith. This doesn't have to be a direct route,
but just so that you can trace a path from rock to obelisk without crossing
water. The easiest way to do this is, when searching for the stones, not to
jump over the small stretches of water you come across. Deposit a bit of
land and then cross. That way, before you know it, you've linked all the
islands in the archipelago.
        Something else worth remembering is that the stones are widely
spaced. You don't have a time limit finding them, so wander around for a
bit. Note the position of the  stone nearest the monolith and destroy this
one last. That makes your job of destroying the monolith within the 90
second time limit a bit easier.

        Now for a couple of odds and ends. The easiest way to get rid of
the necromancer is to build a piece of land, about three squares long and
one wide, jutting out from the coastline just before where the necromancer
will strike. He will teleport to another section of land, after a delay.
The lost souls are indestructible, so give them a wide berth. Don't worry
about running out of energy when creating land, as the energy rocks are in
abundance. Finally try and find the blood eggs before they hatch. When they
burst they spread their poison to the whole lot of the connected islands, even
through the sand as well as the land connections.
