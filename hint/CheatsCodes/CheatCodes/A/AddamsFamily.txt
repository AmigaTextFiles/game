 Playing Tips:

 In the hallway, go to the bottom left and press up on the joystick to
 reveal a hidden door. Now enter the door and on the next screen, directly
 above you is another hidden door which hides even more doors and extra
 lives. 
 Pause the game by pressing the [Spacebar] and then hit the [Escape] key.
 You will now be in a room with a continue door and a eacape door.
 Instead of choosing one of these options just keep walking left untill
 you come across another room full of extra lives.
