 Cheat Mode:

 When playing the game pause it and type `DSIMAGIC'. Now unpause the game
 and catch the pill that is falling down from the centre of the screen.
 You can now press any of the following keys:

 [B] = Exit Open.
 [C] = Magnetic Bat.
 [D] = Three Ball Split.
 [E] = Extended Bat.
 [F] = Final Screen.
 [L] = Lazer Bat.
 [P] = Extra Bat.
 [S] = Slow Ball.

 And you can also press [Enter] on the numeric keypad to skip levels.
 Or for an extra 33 levels press [F3] for a one player game and [F4] for a
 two player game instead of [F1] and [F2].
