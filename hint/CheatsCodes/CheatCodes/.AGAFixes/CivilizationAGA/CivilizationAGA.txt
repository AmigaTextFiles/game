                               CivilizationAGA
                               ---------------





    There has been much talk on comp.sys.amiga.games over the past few months
on the subject of finding ways of improving the speed of CivilizationAGA. 
This file contains information posted by David Andrew Clayton
(dac@prolix.apana.org.au) which I found to work perfectly with my hard disk 
installed version of the game.


In order to perform the changes to the file you will need:


i)  Either Powerpacker Professional or DLD (found in the VirusZ archive on
    Aminet - util/virus/virsz307.lha) in order to decrunch the executable
    Civilization file.  If you use DLD don't forget to install
    decrunch.library, also found in the archive.

ii) A hex file editor such as AZap, FileX etc.




Before we start, a quick disclaimer - I take no responsibility for any damage
you may cause to your hard disc and the files there on it nor do I guarantee
that the following will work. It just worked for me (and Mr Clayton presumably).


A)  Unpack the CivilizationAGA file, perhaps taking a backup copy of it first
    just in case anything should go wrong.  Use either of the above decrunchers.

B)  Load up your file editor and load the uncrunched CivilizationAGA file.

C)  Change the following entries:



To remove the screen fades (thank-you God):

At offset &2CCF2 change  &6728     to &66B0
At offset &2CE60 change  &59466002 to &4E714E71


To stop the pointer annoying you with its constant blinking:

At offset &2D17C change  &4EAEFEF2 to &4E714E71


To make the game run mostly from FAST RAM:

At offset &14    change  &40       to &00
At offset &1C    change  &40       to &00
At offset &20    change  &40       to &00


D)  Save the file back, and recrunch it if you wish, though you do not need
    to.

E)  Run this file as normal by double-licking on its icon.

    With luck everything is OK, the music is still fine and the game runs at a
    less terrifyingly slow speed (on faster machines especially).  Now a game
    of Civ no longer takes a week !

    It is also worth bearing in mind that the pointer may now disappear when
    you stop moving the mouse - don't be alarmed if this happens.  Also, if
    you use the 'End of Turn' option, allowing the pointer to vanish before
    hitting the return/space bar should speed up the computer moves a little.


Good luck !         Nick Ridley         (nick@mentaur.demon.co.uk)
