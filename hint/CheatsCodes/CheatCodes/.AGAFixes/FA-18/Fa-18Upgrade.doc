                      for FA-18 Interceptor By Electronic Arts
                                (NOV,06,1993)

              Upgrade written by Alvin Derouen and Randy Jouett


-------------------------------INSTALLATION-----------------------------------

NOTE: The default ICONS are designed for WorkBench 2.0. WorkBench 1.3 ICONS are
      also included. They have "For1.3" appended to the normal name. Just
      rename and copy over the normal one to use. (All this will do is make the
      the icons look better , there are no other differences.)


                                   FLOPPY
 Move the FA-18 Upgrade to the "F-18 Interceptor" disk.
    WARNING: use a copy , DO NOT use the original!!!
 This may be accomplished by either:
  A. Copying both "FA-18 Upgrade" and "FA-18 UpGrade.info" from the CLI.
  B. In workbench, open the directory the Upgrade is in then double click on the
     "F-18 Interceptor" disk icon. Now use the mouse to move the "FA-18 Upgrade"
      icon and drop it into the "F-18 Interceptor" window.


---------------------------------- LOADING -----------------------------------
 Just click on the icon from the workbench , or from the cli, run the file
 "FA-18 Upgrade". (With quotes)


  NOTE: This Upgrade does not in any way change the original program. You MUST
        run the program each time by useing the IDD upgrade. If you do not ,
        none of the new features will operate.



  NOTE: You may also run the upgrade without installing it. Double click on the
        "FA-18 Upgrade" icon on the analog upgrade original disk. You will then
         be prompted to insert "F-18 Interceptor". After the disk is inserted,
         it will load normally.

--------------------------------- NEW FEATURES --------------------------------
ALL of the following NEW features for FA-18 Interceptor are now available using
the Amiga Smart Port from IDD!
  1.    Support of ANALOG JOYSTICK!! Provides more sensitive control, adds the
        full analog range (0-251) of the AMIGA Smart Port for better control.
  2.    Auto-Sensing of an Amiga Smart Port in analog mode with automatic
        software switching between digital and analog joysticks modes.
  3.    Joystick centering function to provide exact centering which can be
        used at anytime... Even during flight!
  4.    Dynamic Joystick Scaling - The IDD Upgrade will adjust the control
        scale to use the full capabilities of your joystick to obtain maximum
        performance simply by moving your joystick!
  5.    Joystick and rudder sensitivity Setting - You can use any one of 20
        sensitivity settings per axis. Use the one you need to suit the speed
        of your machine and your personal preference! Switch between them at
        any time!
  6.    Support for ANALOG PEDALS!! This feature contains the same centering
        and dynamic scaling features used with the joystick. Analog Pedal and
        Rudder inputs can be reversed for wiring compatibility.
  7.    Support for ANALOG THROTTLE!!  Now you can quickly and easily move
        between throttle settings without going to the keyboard.
  8.    Support for FOUR BUTTONS!! Users of two joysticks or joysticks with 4
        buttons can now use the extra buttons to reduce the need to access the
        keyboard.
  9.    Ability to reverse the Throttle/Rudder inputs for wiring compatibility.
 10.    Adjustable dead zone around center for the joystick and pedals to
        allow for variations in the centering.
 11.    Support for "VIEWS ON THE JOYSTICK"!! Allows use of the CH FlightStick

******************************************************************************
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CONTROL	  KEY(s)	FUNCTION
--------  ------  ----------------------------------------------------
JOYSTICK:                   CENTER

            L    Center Analog Joystick if active
                 Needed on start-up and any time the center changes and causes
                 the aircraft to drift. (Not to be confused with battle damage.)
                 This will vary according to the quality of your joystick.

                 SWITCHING BETWEEN ANALOG AND DIGITAL JOYSTICK:
                  ANALOG:
		       Press the "FIRE" button on the ANALOG joystick once.
                       This activates the "PC1" light on the AMIGA Smart Port
                       and places the hardware in analog mode.

                  DIGITAL:
                       Press the "Fire" Button on the DIGITAL joystick to
                       turn off the "PC1" light. This deactivates the
                       analog mode of the AMIGA Smart Port hardware and places
                       the unit into digital joystick mode.

                  NOTE: The FA-18 Upgrade software will follow the AMIGA Smart
                        Port mode by switching from analog to digital as the
                        hardware does.

     Shift+K    Turn off analog throttle.
                 (DEFAULT on start-up)
           K    Turn on and center analog throttle

                NOTE: Analog throttle will NOT work correctly unless:
                     1."PC1" light on the AMIGA Smart Port is activated FIRST.
                     2. Either "PC2" light is on OR the mouse mode switch on
                       the Smart port is switched AWAY from the 15 pin plug.
                      (See "USING THE ANALOG THROTTLE" below)

                      For technical reasons, it is not possible to sense
                      the Amiga Smart Port Mouse Port 1 mode (indicated by
                      the "PC2" light).  The software will NOT automatically
                      follow any changes in the mode of Mouse Port 1.



GENERAL:
           Y     Toggle Throttle/Pedals inputs. (Press again to restore)
                 NOTE: As this puts the rudder on the "Special Mouse Mode"
                      input it is possible to use a Rudder Pedal Adapter
                      (From IDD) or The original Game Port Adapter (From IDD)
                      in conjunction with the "Y" key to use a set of rudder
                      pedals without requiring that the "PC2" light be on (as
                      is done in Fighter Duel Pro.)
                 (DEFAULT on start-up is NORMAL)
           W     Activate use of buttons 3 and 4 on the analog joystick. Also
                 enables use of the CH FlightStick PRO "HAT" switch for view
                 modes.
     Shift+W     Deactivate use of buttons 3 and 4 on the analog joystick. Will
                 Also Deactivate use of the CH FlightStick PRO "HAT" switch for
                 view modes.

                 (DEFAULT on start-up is DEACTIVATED)
                  NOTE: The PC1 light on the AMIGA Smart Port MUST be on before
                        Buttons 1 and 2 will work. BOTH the PC1 and  PC2 lights
                        on the AMIGA Smart Port MUST be on before buttons 3 and
                        4 will work.

                          Button assignments are as follows:
                 Button 1(MAIN JOYSTICK FIRE)  = Fire weapon (Same as space bar)
                 Button 2(MAIN JOYSTICK BUT. 2)= Track Target (Same as "T" key)
                 Button 3(AUX. JOYSTICK FIRE)  = Afterburner (Same as "F10"Key)
                 Button 4(AUX. JOYSTICK BUT. 2)= Radar Range (Same as "R" Key)


         DEL     Toggles between the two available view modes when using the
                 CH FlightStick PRO. (SEE "W" Key above)
                 VIEW MODES: (View mode 1 is the default on start-up)
                   1. UP       = Up view.
                      DOWN     = Back view.
                      LEFT     = Left view. One turn of your head, 11 o'clock.
                      RIGHT    = Right view. One turn of your head, 1 o'clock.
                      Released = Forward view
                   2. UP       = Forward view
                      DOWN     = Back view.
                      LEFT     = Turns your head to the left, incrementally.
                      RIGHT    = Turns your head to the right, incrementally.
                      Released = No effect, last view is locked.
                NOTE: In View Mode 2 multiple use of the LEFT and RIGHT allows
                      you to cycle through a complete circle and obtain views
                      otherwise not available.


NOTES ON SPECIAL MOUSE MODE:
 Normally, the "PC2" side of the Smart Port is either "ANALOG" (LIGHT
 ILLUMINATED) or "DIGITAL" (LIGHT NOT ILLUMINATED). However, there is a hybrid
 mode called "SPECIAL MOUSE MODE" which is enabled by switching the mouse mode
 switch away from the 15-pin connector. In this case, you are converting the
 middle mouse button into an analog input.  All other digital mouse functions
 will be unaffected.  This allows you to activate ONE analog line while the
 mouse is still available.  This is VERY useful if your hardware does not
 have a button available to put the port in full analog mode.  With this feature
 the built-in throttle on the CH FlightStick (and others) can be used.  This is
 the mode Fighter Duel Pro uses to provide rudder capability.


******************************************************************************
* FA-18 Interceptor - DETAILED PRE-FLIGHT CHECK LIST (after entering cockpit)*
*               Performed on start-up or as needed.                          *
* It is recommended that these procedures be preformed before take off.      *
******************************************************************************
 The following instructions describe various configurations for several
 combinations of hardware.  Locate the appropriate combination for your
 particular situation.

IMPORTANT: NO analog functions will work correctly, unless the light labeled
           "PC1" on the AMIGA Smart Port is illuminated. In addition, the analog
           throttle and the analog pedals will not function if the indicator
           light labeled "PC2" on the AMIGA Smart Port is not illuminated.
           Unless the special mouse mode switch is engaged.

IMPORTANT: At the beginning of the session, the center and full scale
           for each analog device must be initialized at least once
           For more information, see the detailed description below.
           This can be repeated as often as necessary.

WARNING:   Pressing the digital joystick "FIRE" button will deactivate "ALL"
           analog functions ("PC1" light not illuminated).  Press the analog
           joystick "FIRE" button to restore the analog functions ("PC1" light
           illuminated).

           Pressing the left mouse button ("PC2" light not illuminated) will
           deactivate the mouse port one analog mode.  Functions such as pedals,
           analog rudder, buttons 3&4, and "HAT" switch will not operate
           properly under these conditions.  To restore the "PC2" functions,
           perform one of the methods in Step 3 of "USING THE ANALOG PEDALS"
           described below.


USING THE ANALOG JOYSTICK:
1. Connect an analog joystick to the AMIGA Smart Port.
2. Place Port 2 of the Amiga Smart Port in analog mode by pressing the analog
   joystick "FIRE" button.
3. The "PC 1" light on the AMIGA Smart Port should be illuminated.
4. Make sure the analog joystick is in the center, then press the "L" key to
   set the center point.
5. Move the joystick to all four corners of travel to set maximum scale.
6. If you want a different sensitivity than the default (HIGH/5),
   select it at any time by performing the following:
   A. Hold down the Left AMIGA Key and press the "L" key for the high
      sensitivity joystick range (DEFAULT) or the Right AMIGA key and the "L"
      key for the low sensitivity range.  Try experimenting as you fly!
   B. Fine tune the sensitivity by holding down the SHIFT (for the Roll axis)
      or Left AMIGA (for the pitch axis) key and pressing a numeric key on the
      main keyboard.   Left to right on the keyboard:
            1 = (lowest sensitivity) to   0 = (highest sensitivity).
      Be sure to hold down the shift or left AMIGA key BEFORE you press the
      numeric key.    Try experimenting while your flying!
   This provides 10 settings per range. Using both ranges yields 20
   settings per axis.
7. If you want a different center "DEAD" zone than the default, select it at
   any time by pressing the "U" key alone or any one of the following keys
   {SHIFT, LEFT AMIGA, RIGHT AMIGA} with the "U" key.
   The best center "DEAD" zone is determined by the centering accuracy of your
   joystick, and your personal preferences.
(See "DEAD" Zone Description below)


USING THE ANALOG RUDDER PEDALS:
1. Attach one of the following combinations to the AMIGA Smart Port:
    A. Aircraft pedals and a standard analog joystick connected
       via an Advanced Game Port Adapter (from IDD).
       NOTE: The Advanced Game Port Adapter is necessary if your joystick
             does not incorporate at least three buttons.
       Both switches on the Game Port Adapter should be switched to "NORMAL".
    B. IDD'S PC PEDALS(TM) and a standard analog joystick.
    C. An analog joystick with a second analog joystick (for use as pedals)
       using a standard IBM "Y" adapter cable (Available from IDD).
    D. Aircraft pedals and a standard analog joystick connected
       via the original Rudder Pedal Adapter (no longer available from IDD).
       In addition you MUST use the "Y" key on the keyboard to set the rudder/
       throttle inputs to "REVERSE". Also the "Special Mouse Mode Switch" on
       the AMIGA Smart Port MUST be switched away from the 15 pin connecter.
2. Perform the steps under "USING THE ANALOG JOYSTICK".

   IF YOU ARE USING A RUDDER PEDAL ADAPTER, SKIP TO STEP 5.

3. Place Port 1 of the Amiga Smart Port in analog mode, using ONE of the
   following methods:
   (If none apply to you, then you do not have the proper hardware)
   A. Press button 3 on your joystick if it has extra buttons. Button 3 is
      simply the button that turns on the AMIGA Smart Port "PC 2" light.
   B. If you have the Advanced Game Port Adapter (from IDD), enable the
      "PC 2" Trigger Switch. Press the second button on the analog
      joystick.  The "PC 2" light on AMIGA Smart Port should now be on.
   C. If you are using two joysticks with a "Y" cable (available from IDD),
      press the "fire" button on the second analog joystick.
      The "PC 2" light on AMIGA Smart Port should now be on.
   D. Press the mode select button on the IDD PC Pedals... available December
      1993 from IDD.
4. The "PC 2" light on the AMIGA Smart Port "MUST" now be on.
5. Make sure the analog pedals are in the mechanical center, then press the "Q"
   key to set the center point.
6. To set the full scale, push the left pedal to the maximum travel, then
   push the right pedal to the maximum travel.
7. If you want a different sensitivity than the default (HIGH/5),
   select it at any time by performing the following:
   A. Hold down the Left AMIGA Key and press the "Q" key for the High
      sensitivity pedal range (DEFAULT) or the Right AMIGA key and the "Q"
      key for the Low sensitivity range.
      Try experimenting while you are flying!
   B. Fine tune the sensitivity by holding down the Right AMIGA key and
      pressing a numeric key on the main keyboard.
      Left to right on the keyboard:
      1 = (lowest sensitivity) to   0=(highest sensitivity). Be sure to hold
        down the right AMIGA key BEFORE you press the numeric key.
      Try experimenting while you are flying!
   This provides you with 10 settings per range. Using both ranges yields 20
   settings.
8. If you want a different center "DEAD" zone than the default, select it at
   any time by pressing the "I" key alone or any one of the following
   {SHIFT, LEFT AMIGA, RIGHT AMIGA} with the "I" key.
   The best center "DEAD" zone is determined by the centering accuracy of
   your pedals and your personal preferences.
   (See "DEAD" zone description below)


USING THE ANALOG Throttle:
1. Attach one of the following combinations to the AMIGA Smart Port:
   A. Two analog joysticks using a standard IBM "Y" adapter cable.
      (Available from IDD)
   B. Two analog joysticks connected via the PC PEDALS(TM) [BY IDD].
   C. An analog joystick with built-in throttle, using either the
      Advanced Game Port Adapter or the PC PEDALS(TM) [Both from IDD].
   D. An analog joystick with built-in throttle.
      (With this option, the "Special Mouse Mode" switch on the AMIGA Smart
      Port can be switched away from the 15-pin connecter to activate the
      built-in throttle.
   NOTE: Any device used for throttle should NOT be self-centering.
2. Initialize the joystick by performing the steps under "USING THE ANALOG
   JOYSTICK".

   IF THE "SPECIAL MOUSE MODE" SWITCH IS ENABLED(TOWARD THE 15 PIN CONNECTOR),
   SKIP TO STEP 5.

3. Activate the analog mode on Port 1 ("PC2" light illuminated) of the Amiga
   Smart Port by any of the three methods described in step 3 of "USING THE
   ANALOG RUDDER".
4. The "PC1" and "PC2" indicator lights "MUST" be illuminated.
5. Press the "K" key to activate the throttle.
6. Move the device used for throttle to maximum range in both directions.
   WARNING!!!  Be quick or the aircraft will take off!


USING BUTTONS 3 AND 4 FUNCTIONS:
1. Connect a joystick with extra buttons to the AMIGA Smart Port.
2. Activate the analog mode of Port 1 ("PC2" light illuminated) of the Amiga
   Smart Port by any of the three methods described in step 3 of "USING THE
   ANALOG RUDDER PEDALS".
3. Press the "W" key to activate the buttons.

OPTIONAL:  If you are using a CH FlightStick PRO, press the "DEL" key to toggle
           between the viewing mode styles.


CENTER "DEAD" ZONE DESCRIPTION:
  The center "DEAD" zone is an artificially extended area around the center
  point of the joystick or pedals which the software interprets as center or
  null.  This allows for variations in the precision of the centering return
  mechanism of the joystick or pedals.
  Simple rule... If the center drifts, try a less sensitive setting.
        ("NARROW" = Most Sensitive / "WIDE" = least Sensitive)
  If you like to make very small corrections, you may want to select the most
  sensitive setting for your joystick.  Otherwise, accept the default or use
  the WIDE setting.  There are many parameters which affect the mechanical and
  electrical characteristics of your joystick and pedals.  Experiment with the
  various combinations of joystick and software settings to fit your

WARNING:   Pressing the digital joystick "FIRE" button will deactivate "ALL"
           analog functions ("PC1" light not illuminated).  Press the analog
           joystick "FIRE" button to restore the analog functions ("PC1" light
           illuminated).

           Pressing the left mouse button ("PC2" light not illuminated) will
           deactivate the mouse port one analog mode.  Functions such as pedals,
           analog rudder, buttons 3&4, and "HAT" switch will not operate
           properly under these conditions.  To restore the "PC2" functions,
           perform one of the methods in Step 3 of "USING THE ANALOG PEDALS"
           described below.

HINT: When you start the game, pick menu item "2" (Free Flight).  Once in
      the cockpit, set all options.  This completes the initialization.

PROBLEM:  The program requests a log disk in df0:, but does not use it.
SOLUTION: The original program ALWAYS used df0:, but the upgraded version uses
          the disk and directory in which the program is found.  The df0:
          prompts are irrelevant.  Make sure the FA-18 disk you running is
          write enabled.

PROBLEM: The controls appear to behave in an abnormal manner.
SOLUTION: Use the SmartPortCal program to adjust the range of the joystick.
          Use the adjustment knobs to adjust the Smart Port such the Maximum
          value at maximum extremes in any direction does not exceed a value
          of 251.  A value of 249-251 is acceptable. Even a lower value will
          function, just do not exceed a value of 251.

PROBLEM:  The joystick does not respond at all.
SOLUTION: Make sure the "PC1" light is illuminated and the joystick is
          connected correctly. Make sure you have pressed the "L" key to set
          the center point of the joystick.

PROBLEM:  The pedals do not respond at all.
SOLUTION: Make sure the "PC2" light is illuminated and the pedals are
          connected correctly. Make sure you have pressed the "Q" key to
          activate and set the center point.

PROBLEM:  The throttle does not respond at all.
SOLUTION: 1. Make sure either:
            A. The "PC2" light is illuminated and the throttle device is
               connected; or
            B. The "Special Mouse Mode Switch" on the AMIGA Smart Port is
               switched away from the 15-pin connecter and the throttle device is
               connected properly.
          2. Make sure you have pressed the "K" key to enable the throttle.

PROBLEM:  The joystick or pedals drifts when I release it.
SOLUTION: Make sure you have set the center point for the device in question.
          HINT:  Operate the device several cycles before returning to center
                 and press the "L" (or "Q") key to set the center point.
          If the above does not work, then widen the center "DEAD" zone.

PROBLEM:  The stick or pedals responds too fast or too slow.
SOLUTION: Use the sensitivity setting to slow down or speed up the axis you
          are experiencing problems with.
