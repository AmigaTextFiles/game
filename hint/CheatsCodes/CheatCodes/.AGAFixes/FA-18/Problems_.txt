WARNING:   Pressing the digital joystick "FIRE" button will deactivate "ALL"
           analog functions ("PC1" light not illuminated).  Press the analog
           joystick "FIRE" button to restore the analog functions ("PC1" light
           illuminated).

           Pressing the left mouse button ("PC2" light not illuminated) will
           deactivate the mouse port one analog mode.  Functions such as pedals,
           analog rudder, buttons 3&4, and "HAT" switch will not operate
           properly under these conditions.  To restore the "PC2" functions,
           perform one of the methods in Step 3 of "USING THE ANALOG PEDALS"
           described below.

HINT: When you start the game, pick menu item "2" (Free Flight).  Once in
      the cockpit, set all options.  This completes the initialization.

PROBLEM:  The program requests a log disk in df0:, but does not use it.
SOLUTION: The original program ALWAYS used df0:, but the upgraded version uses
          the disk and directory in which the program is found.  The df0:
          prompts are irrelevant.  Make sure the FA-18 disk you running is
          write enabled.

PROBLEM: The controls appear to behave in an abnormal manner.
SOLUTION: Use the SmartPortCal program to adjust the range of the joystick.
          Use the adjustment knobs to adjust the Smart Port such the Maximum
          value at maximum extremes in any direction does not exceed a value
          of 251.  A value of 249-251 is acceptable. Even a lower value will
          function, just do not exceed a value of 251.

PROBLEM:  The joystick does not respond at all.
SOLUTION: Make sure the "PC1" light is illuminated and the joystick is
          connected correctly. Make sure you have pressed the "L" key to set
          the center point of the joystick.

PROBLEM:  The pedals do not respond at all.
SOLUTION: Make sure the "PC2" light is illuminated and the pedals are
          connected correctly. Make sure you have pressed the "Q" key to
          activate and set the center point.

PROBLEM:  The throttle does not respond at all.
SOLUTION: 1. Make sure either:
            A. The "PC2" light is illuminated and the throttle device is
               connected; or
            B. The "Special Mouse Mode Switch" on the AMIGA Smart Port is
               switched away from the 15-pin connecter and the throttle device is
               connected properly.
          2. Make sure you have pressed the "K" key to enable the throttle.

PROBLEM:  The joystick or pedals drifts when I release it.
SOLUTION: Make sure you have set the center point for the device in question.
          HINT:  Operate the device several cycles before returning to center
                 and press the "L" (or "Q") key to set the center point.
          If the above does not work, then widen the center "DEAD" zone.

PROBLEM:  The stick or pedals responds too fast or too slow.
SOLUTION: Use the sensitivity setting to slow down or speed up the axis you
          are experiencing problems with.
