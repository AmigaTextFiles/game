                   InterACTIVE Digital Devices Presents:
               AMIGA Smart Port(TM) Analog Upgrade Version 2.0
                      for GunShip 2000 by MicroProse
                                (OCT,3,1993)

                     Upgrade written by Alvin Derouen


Developed for GunShip 2000 Version 3.01 3/6/1991 - may work on other versions.

---------------------------- UNDOCUMENTED FEATURE ----------------------------
While it is not in the manual, you can turn off the music on the mission
select level by pressing the "F1" key.  Note that it does not always work.
This is a function of the original game.



-------------------------------INSTALLATION-----------------------------------

NOTE: The default ICONS are designed for WorkBench 2.0. WorkBench 1.3 ICONS are
      also included. They have "For1.3" appended to the normal name. Just
      rename and copy over the normal one to use. (All this will do is make the
      the icons look better , there are no other differences.)

                                 HARD DISK
 Move the GS2000 Upgrade to the directory in which GunShip resides.  This may
 be accomplished by either:
  A. Copying both "GunShip 2000 Upgrade" and "GunShip 2000 UpGrade.info" from
     the CLI.
  B. In workbench, open both the directory which contains the upgrade and the
     hard disk directory that contains GunShip 2000. Now use the mouse to move
     the "GunShip 2000 Upgrade" icon and drop it into the GunShip directory
     window on the hard disk.

                                   FLOPPY
 Move the GS2000 Upgrade to the GS_DSK1 disk (GunShip 2000 disk number 1).
   WARNING: use a copy , DO NOT use the original!!!
 This may be accomplished by either:
  A. Copying both "GunShip 2000 Upgrade" and "GunShip 2000 UpGrade.info" from
     the CLI.
  B. In workbench, open the directory the Upgrade is in and double click on the
     GS_DSK1 icon. Now use the mouse to move the "GunShip 2000 Upgrade" icon
     and drop it into the GS_DSK1 window.


---------------------------------- LOADING -----------------------------------
 Just click on the Icon from the workbench , or from the cli, run the file
 "GunShip 2000 Upgrade". (With quotes)


  NOTE: You may also run the Upgrade without installing it. Double click on the
        "GunShip 2000 Upgrade" icon on the original disk. You will then be
         prompted to insert "GS_DSK1". After the disk is inserted, it will
         load normally.


  NOTE: This Upgrade does not in any way change the original program. You MUST
        run the program each time by useing the IDD upgrade. If you do not ,
        none of the new features will operate.


  WARNING: A system with only one meg of ram is unlikely to able to load from
           workbench with a full system installed. In this case, you need to
           boot from a copy of the gunship 2000 disk with the GS2000 Upgrade
           icon in it. You then double click on the icon to start.
           (See floppy installation above)

--------------------------------- NEW FEATURES --------------------------------
ALL of the following NEW features for GS2000 are now available using the Amiga
Smart Port from IDD!
  1.    More sensitive control!  The GunShip 2000 upgrade makes use of the full
        range (0-251) of the AMIGA Smart Port instead of the original limited
        range provided by the game (0-40).
  2.    An Enhanced Flight Mode which yields more realistic flying.
        (Allows flying sideways or at an angle and using pedals!)
  3.    Keyboard pedal controls using the left and right arrow keys when
        in the Enhanced Flight Mode.
  4.    Auto-Sensing of the Amiga Smart Port in analog mode with automatic
        software switching between digital and analog joysticks modes.
  5.    Analog joystick will work at all levels (including menus) with
        automatic switching between digital and analog modes.
  6.    Joystick centering function provides precise centering. This feature
        can be used at anytime... Even during flight!
  7.    Dynamic Joystick Scaling - The IDD Upgrade will adjust the control
        scale to use the full capabilities of your joystick to obtain maximum
        performance simply by moving your joystick to all extremes!
  8.    Joystick Threshold Sensitivity Setting - You can use any one of three
        threshold sensitivity settings. Use the one you need to suit your
        joystick! Switch between them at any time!
  9.    Support for ANALOG PEDALS!! This feature contains the same
        centering and dynamic scaling features used with the joystick.
        Analog pedal and collective inputs can be reversed for wiring
        compatibility.
  10.   Support for ANALOG COLLECTIVE!!  Now you can quickly and easily move
        between collective settings for maximum flying advantage.
  11.   Analog joystick buttons 1 (fire) and 2 now operate as per the manual.
        (the original game has them reversed)
  12.   Users of two button joysticks or joysticks with 4 buttons can now use
        the extra buttons for multiple (selectable) functions. This reduces the
        need to go to the keyboard during battle.


******************************************************************************
*                   NEW GunShip 2000 KEYBOARD FUNCTIONS                      *
******************************************************************************
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CONTROL	  KEY(s)	FUNCTION
--------  ------  ----------------------------------------------------
JOYSTICK:
            J    Center analog joystick if active with "MEDIUM" threshold
      Shift+J    Center analog joystick if active with "MAXIMUM" threshold
        ALT+J    Center analog joystick if active with "MINIMUM" threshold

                 Needed on start-up and any time the center set point changes.
                 This will vary according to quality of your joystick.


                 SWITCHING BETWEEN ANALOG AND DIGITAL JOYSTICK (CYCLIC):
                  ANALOG:
		       Press the "FIRE" button on the ANALOG joystick once.
                       This activates the "PC1" light on the AMIGA Smart Port
                       and places the hardware in analog mode.

                  DIGITAL:
                       Press the "Fire" Button on the DIGITAL joystick to
                       turn off the "PC1" light. This deactivates the
                       analog mode of the AMIGA Smart Port hardware and places
                       the unit into digital joystick mode.

                  NOTE: The GS2000 Upgrade software will follow the AMIGA
                        Smart Port mode by switching from analog to digital as
                        the hardware does.




ENHANCED FLIGHT MODE (EFM):
           K     Turn off Analog Pedals and Enhanced Flight Mode.
                 (DEFAULT on start-up)
           I     Select Enhanced flight.

                 HINT: If you would like to rotate while in hover using the
                       joystick (but you don't have a second joystick or
                       pedals), just switch off the Enhanced Flight Mode, make
                       your movements, then switch (EFM) back on.

  LEFT ARROW    Simulate the application of the left pedal. Holding the key
                down will increase the rotational speed.  Only operational in
                Enhanced Flight Mode.

 RIGHT ARROW    Simulate the application of the right pedal. Holding the key
                down will increase the rotational speed.  Only operational in
                Enhanced Flight Mode.

                NOTE: The effectiveness of the pedals is a function of forward
                      speed.  As in real helicopters, the higher the speed, the
                      less effect the pedals have in forward flight.  The speed
                      at which pedal inputs have no effect occurs at about
                      70 M.P.H.


PEDALS:
           K    Turn off analog pedals and Enhanced Flight Mode.
                 (DEFAULT on start-up)
           R    Turn on and center analog pedals with "MEDIUM" threshold
     Shift+R    Turn on and center analog pedals with "MAXIMUM" threshold
       ALT+R    Turn on and center analog pedals with "MINIMUM" threshold

                NOTE: Centering the pedals will also turn on the enhanced
                      flight mode. Analog Pedals will NOT work correctly
                      unless the "PC1" and "PC2" lights on the AMIGA Smart
                      Port are illuminated before center.
                      (See "USING THE ANALOG PEDALS" below)

                      For technical reasons, it is not possible to sense
                      the Amiga Smart Port Mouse Port 1 mode (indicated by
                      the "PC2" light).  The software will NOT automatically
                      follow any changes in the mode of Mouse Port 1.


COLLECTIVE:
           L    Turn off analog collective.
                 (DEFAULT on start-up)
           ~    Turn on and center analog collective with "MEDIUM" threshold
     Shift+~    Turn on and center analog collective with "MAXIMUM" threshold
       ALT+~    Turn on and center analog collective with "MINIMUM" threshold

                NOTE: Analog collective will NOT work correctly unless:
                     1."PC1"  light on the AMIGA Smart Port is activated FIRST.
                     2. Either "PC2" light is on OR the mouse mode Switch on
                       the Smart port is switched AWAY from the 15 pin plug.
                      (See "USING THE ANALOG COLLECTIVE" below)

                      For technical reasons, it is not possible to sense
                      the Amiga Smart Port Mouse Port 1 mode (indicated by
                      the "PC2" light).  The software will NOT automatically
                      follow any changes in the mode of Mouse Port 1.


GENERAL:
           T     Toggle Collective/Pedals inputs. (Press again to restore)
                 NOTE: As this puts the rudder on the "Special Mouse Mode"
                      input it is possible to use a Rudder Pedal Adapter
                      (From IDD) or the original Game Port Adapter (From IDD)
                      in conjunction with the "T" key to use a set of rudder
                      pedals without requiring that the "PC2" light be on (as
                      is done in Fighter Duel Pro.)
                 (DEFAULT on start-up is NORMAL)
           Y     Activate/Deactivate use of buttons 3 and 4 on analog joystick.
                 (DEFAULT on start-up is DEACTIVATED)
           U     Cycle through buttons 3 and 4 assignments:
                  1. Button 3 = Select weapon
                     Button 4 = Toggle Missile View/Cockpit View
                     (DEFAULT on start-up)
                  2. Button 3 = Select weapon
                     Button 4 = Toggle Enhanced flight mode on/off
                  3. Button 3 = Drop chaff
                     Button 4 = Drop flares
          HELP   Reports Version Info.



NOTES ON SPECIAL MOUSE MODE:
 Normally, the "PC2" side of the Smart Port is either "ANALOG" (LIGHT
 ILLUMINATED) or "DIGITAL" (LIGHT NOT ILLUMINATED). However, there is a hybrid
 mode called "SPECIAL MOUSE MODE" which is enabled by switching the mouse mode
 switch away from the 15-pin connector. In this case, you are converting the
 middle mouse button into an analog input.  All other digital mouse functions
 will be unaffected.  This allows you to activate ONE analog line while the
 mouse is still available.  This is VERY useful if your hardware does not
 have a button available to put the port in full analog mode.  With this feature
 the built-in throttle on the CH FlightStick (and others) can be used.  This is
 the mode Fighter Duel Pro uses to provide rudder capability.


******************************************************************************
*   GunShip 2000 - DETAILED PRE-FLIGHT CHECK LIST (after entering cockpit)   *
*               Performed on start-up or as needed.                          *
* It is recommended that these procedures be preformed before take off.      *
******************************************************************************
 The following instructions describe various configurations for several
 combinations of hardware.  Locate the appropriate combination for your
 particular situation.

IMPORTANT: NO analog functions will work correctly, unless the light labeled
          "PC1" on the AMIGA Smart Port is illuminated.  In addition, the analog
           collective and the analog pedals will not function if the indicator
           light labeled "PC2" on the AMIGA Smart Port is not illuminated.
           Unless the special mouse mode switch is engaged.

IMPORTANT: At the beginning of the session, the center and full scale
           for each analog device must be initialized at least once.
           For more information, see the detailed description below.
           This can be repeated as often as necessary.

WARNING:   Pressing the digital joystick "FIRE" button will deactivate "ALL"
           analog functions ("PC1" light not illuminated).  Press the analog
           joystick "FIRE" button to restore the analog functions ("PC1" light
           illuminated).

           Pressing the left mouse button ("PC2" light not illuminated) will
           deactivate the mouse port one analog mode.  Functions such as pedals,
           analog collective, and buttons 3&4, will not operate properly under
           these conditions.  To restore the "PC2" functions, perform one of the
           methods in Step 3 of "USING THE ANALOG PEDALS" described below.




USING THE ANALOG CYCLIC:
1. Connect an analog joystick to the AMIGA Smart Port.
2. Place Port 2 of the Amiga Smart Port in analog mode by pressing the analog
   joystick "FIRE" button.
3. The "PC1" light on the AMIGA Smart Port should be illuminated.
4. Make sure the analog joystick is in the center, then press the "J" key to
   set the center point.  Press SHIFT+J / ALT+J - depending upon your joystick.
5. Move the joystick to all four corners of its travel to set maximum scale.
6. If you want a different threshold sensitivity than the default (MEDIUM),
   select one it at any time by performing steps 2,3, and 4 using "J"+ALT or
   "J"+SHIFT KEYS. The best threshold is determined by the centering accuracy
   of your joystick and your personal preferences.
   (See Threshold description below)


USING THE ANALOG PEDALS:
1. Attach one of the following combinations to the AMIGA Smart Port:
    A. Aircraft pedals and a standard analog joystick connected
       via an Advanced Game Port Adapter (from IDD).
       NOTE: The Advanced Game Port Adapter is necessary if your joystick
             does not incorporate at least three buttons.
       Both switches on the Game Port Adapter should be switched to "NORMAL".
    B. IDD'S PC PEDALS(TM) and a standard analog joystick.
    C. An analog joystick with a second analog joystick (for use as pedals)
       using a standard IBM "Y" adapter cable. (Available from IDD)
    D. Aircraft pedals and a standard analog joystick connected
       via the original Rudder Pedal Adapter (no longer available from IDD).
       In addition you MUST use the "T" key on the keyboard to set the rudder/
       collective inputs to "REVERSE". Also the "Special Mouse Mode Switch" on
       the AMIGA Smart Port MUST be switched away from the 15 pin connecter.
2. Perform the steps under "USING THE ANALOG JOYSTICK".

   IF YOU ARE USING A RUDDER PEDAL ADAPTER, SKIP TO STEP 5.

3. Place Port 1 of the Amiga Smart Port in analog mode, using ONE of the
   following methods:
   (If none apply to you, then you do not have the proper hardware)
   A. Press button 3 on your joystick if it has extra buttons. Button 3 is
      simply the button that turns on the AMIGA Smart Port "PC 2" light.
   B. If you have the Advanced Game Port Adapter (from IDD) then enable the
      "PC 2" Trigger Switch then Press the second button on the analog
      joystick.  The "PC 2" light on AMIGA Smart Port should now be on.
   C. If you are using two joysticks with a "Y" cable (available from IDD),
      press the "fire" button on the second analog joystick.
      The "PC 2" light on AMIGA Smart Port should now be on.
   D. Press the mode select button on the IDD PC Pedals... available December
      1993 from IDD.
4. The "PC 2" light on the AMIGA Smart Port "MUST" now be on.
5. Make sure the analog pedals are in the mechanical center, then press the "R"
   key to set the center point.  You may like to try SHIFT+R or ALT+R to
   experiment with different center thresholds.
6. To set the full scale, push the left pedal down to the furthest position,
   then perform the same to right pedal.
7. If you want a different threshold sensitivity then the default (MEDIUM),
   then select it at any time by performing steps 4, 5, and 6 using "R"+ALT or
   "R"+SHIFT KEY. The best center threshold needed is determined by the
   centering accuracy of your pedals, and your personal preferences.
   (See Threshold Description below)



USING THE ANALOG COLLECTIVE:
1. Attach one of the following combinations to the AMIGA Smart Port:
   A. An analog joystick (CYCLIC) and a second analog joystick (COLLECTIVE)
      using a standard IBM style "Y" cable. (Available from IDD.)
   B. An analog joystick (CYCLIC) and a second analog joystick (COLLECTIVE)
      using the PC PEDALS(TM) [BY IDD].
   C. A joystick with a built-in throttle, using either the "Advanced Game Port
      Adapter" or the  PC PEDALS(TM) [Both from IDD].
      Both switches on the Game Port Adapter or PC PEDALS(TM) should be switched
      to "NORMAL".
   D. A joystick with a built-in throttle.
      (In this case The "Special Mouse Mode" switch on the AMIGA Smart Port can
       be enabled by switching it away from the 15-pin connecter. This means
       you do not have to perform steps 3 and 4)
   NOTE: Any device used for collective should be self centering.
2. Perform the steps under "USING THE ANALOG JOYSTICK".

   IF YOU ARE USING A JOYSTICK WITH A BUILT-IN THROTTLE, SKIP TO STEP 5.

3. Place Port 1 of the Amiga Smart Port in analog mode, using ONE of the
   following methods:
   (If none apply to you, then you do not have the proper hardware)
   A. Press button 3 on your joystick if it has extra buttons. Button 3 is
      simply the button that turns on the AMIGA Smart Port "PC 2" light.
   B. If you have the Advanced Game Port Adapter (from IDD) then enable the
      "PC 2" Trigger Switch then Press the second button on the analog
      joystick.  The "PC 2" light on the AMIGA Smart Port should now be on.
   C. If you are using two joysticks with a "Y" cable (available from IDD),
      press the "FIRE" button on the second analog joystick.
      The "PC 2" light on AMIGA Smart Port should now be on.
   D. Press the mode select button on the IDD PC Pedals... available December
      1993 from IDD.
4. The "PC1" and "PC 2" lights on the AMIGA SMART PORT "MUST" now be
   illuminated.
5. Make sure the device used for collective is centered, then press the
   "~" key (the large key on the top left right below the "ESC" key) to set
   the center point.
6. Move the device used for collective to its maximum range in both directions
   to set full scale.
7. If you want a different threshold sensitivity than the default, (MEDIUM)
   then select it at any time by doing steps 4,5, and 6 using "~"+ALT or
   "~"+SHIFT KEYS.  The best threshold is determined by the centering accuracy
   of your joystick and your personal preferences (See Threshold Description
    below).


USING BUTTONS 3 AND 4 FUNCTIONS:
1. Connect a joystick with the extra buttons to the AMIGA SMART PORT.
2. Activate the analog mode of Port 1 ("PC2" light illuminated) of the Amiga
   Smart Port by any of the three methods described in step 3 of "USING THE
   ANALOG PEDALS" as described above.
3. Press the "Y" key to active the buttons.
4. To select other button assignments, press the "U" key as many times as
   necessary to cycle to the desired configuration.

THRESHOLD DESCRIPTION:
  The center threshold is an artificially extended area around the center
  point of the joystick or pedals which the software interprets as center or
  null.  This allows for variations in the precision of the centering return
  mechanism of the joystick or pedals.
  Simple rule... If the center drifts, try a less sensitive setting.
        ("MINIMUM" = Most Sensitive / "MAXIMUM" = least Sensitive)
  If you like to make very small corrections, you may want to select the most
  sensitive setting for your joystick.  Otherwise, accept the default or use
  the MAXIMUM setting.  There are many parameters which affect the mechanical
  and electrical characteristics of your joystick and pedals.  Experiment with
  the various combinations of joystick and software settings to fit your
  preferences.


******************************************************************************
*                         HAVING PROBLEMS?                                   *
******************************************************************************
WARNING:   Pressing the digital joystick "FIRE" button will deactivate "ALL"
           analog functions ("PC1" light not illuminated).  Press the analog
           joystick "FIRE" button to restore the analog functions ("PC1" light
           illuminated).

           Pressing the left mouse button ("PC2" light not illuminated) will
           deactivate the analog on mouse port one.  This will cause problems if
           pedals, analog collective, or buttons 3 and 4, are in use.
           To restore the "PC2" functions, perform one of the methods described
           in Step 3 (Above) of "USING THE ANALOG PEDALS".


PROBLEM: The controls appear to behave in an abnormal manner.
SOLUTION: Use the SmartPortCal program to adjust the range of the joystick.
          Use the adjustment knobs to adjust the Smart Port such the Maximum
          value at maximum extremes in any direction does not exceed a value
          of 251.  A value of 249-251 is acceptable. Even a lower value will
          function, just do not exceed a value of 251.

PROBLEM:  The joystick does not respond at all.
SOLUTION: Make sure the "PC1" light is illuminated and the joystick is
          connected properly. Make sure you have pressed the "J" key to
          set the center point of the joystick.

PROBLEM:  The pedals do not respond at all.
SOLUTION: Make sure the "PC2" light is illuminated and the pedals are
          connected correctly. Make sure you have pressed the "R" key to
          activate and set the center point.

PROBLEM:  The collective does not respond at all.
SOLUTION: 1. Make sure either:
            A. The "PC2" light is illuminated and the collective device is
               connected; or
            B. The "Special Mouse Mode Switch" on the AMIGA Smart Port is
               switched away from the 15-pin connecter and the collective
               device is connected properly.
          2. Make sure you have pressed the "~" key to enable the collective.


PROBLEM:  On the mission level, both joysticks (analog and digital) and my
          mouse do not work right.
SOLUTION: You have something set up in your system that is affecting all three
          devices. This is a known problem with the basic GS2000 game. The only
          cure is to stop running the program that causes the problem (The cause
          may vary from system to system).

PROBLEM:  Sometimes, when I am viewing the "MAP" screen or have the game
          paused, I can't return to the cockpit.
SOLUTION: GS2000 Upgrade 2.3 still contains a software glitch which causes an
          interaction with the mouse on some computers. Just move the mouse and
          it will allow you to return to the game. We were ready to release the
          2.3 Upgrade when this was reported.  Because it is such a minor
          problem and does not happen often, we decided to release GS2000 as
          is.  The next release of this upgrade will correct this inconvenience.
