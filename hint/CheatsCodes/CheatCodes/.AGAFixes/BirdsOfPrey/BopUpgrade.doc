                   InterACTIVE Digital Devices Presents:
               AMIGA Smart Port(TM) Analog Upgrade Version 1.2A
          for Birds of Prey by Electronic ARTS And Argonaut Software

                     Upgrade written by Alvin Derouen


IMPORTANT: It has come to our attention that there are two versions of Birds of
           Prey. This upgrade works with the 1991 version. If the files on your
           Birds of Prey disk 2 are dated 1992, then this upgrade will NOT work.



-------------------------------INSTALLATION-----------------------------------
NOTE: The default ICONS are designed for WorkBench 2.0. WorkBench 1.3 ICONS are
      also included. They have "For1.3" appended to the normal name. Just
      rename and copy over the normal one to use. (All this will do is make the
      the icons look better , there are no other differences.)


                                 HARD disk
 Move the BOP Upgrade to the directory in which Birds of Prey resides. This may
 be accomplished by either:
  A. CLI:
     Insert the original "SmartPortCal" disk in a floppy drive. Copy
    "BOP Upgrade" and "BOP Upgrade.info" to the hard disk directory that holds
     Birds of Prey.
  B. Workbench:
     Insert the original "SmartPortCal" disk in a floppy drive. Open the
     directory "Analog Upgrades" on the "SmartPortCal" disk. Open the directory
     inside the "Analog Upgrades" window named "Birds of Prey".
     Now Open the directory on the hard disk that holds "Birds of Prey".
     (It should be named "BOP")
     Next use the mouse to move the "BOP Upgrade" icon and drop it into the
      hard disk "BOP" window.
     (You may have to rearrange the windows to do this)


                                   FLOPPY
 Move the BOP Upgrade to the Birds of Prey: disk (Birds of Prey disk number 2).
   WARNING: Use a copy , DO NOT use the original!!!
 This may be accomplished by either:
  A. CLI:
     Insert the original "SmartPortCal" disk in a floppy drive. Insert a COPY
     of the original "Birds of Prey:" disk in a floppy drive.
     (That is the name of the Birds of Prey Disk 2)
     DO NOT USE THE ORIGINAL DISK!!! Copy the "BOP Upgrade" program and
     "BOP Upgrade.info" to the "Birds of Prey:" disk.
  B. Workbench:
     Insert the original "SmartPortCal" disk in a floppy drive.
     Open the directory "Analog Upgrades" on the "SmartPortCal" disk. Open the
     directory inside the "Analog Upgrades" window named "Birds of Prey".
     Insert a COPY of the original "Birds of Prey:" disk in a floppy
     drive. (That is the name of the Birds of Prey Disk 2)
     DO NOT USE THE ORIGINAL DISK!!!  Now Double Click on the "Birds Of Prey:"
     icon to open up a window for the "Birds Of Prey:" disk. Next use the
     mouse to move the "BOP Upgrade" icon in the "Birds of Prey" window of the
     SmartPortCal disk and drop it into the "Birds of Prey:" window of the
     game disk.
     (You may have to rearrange the windows to do this)


---------------------------------- LOADING -----------------------------------
 Just click on the Icon from the workbench , or from the cli, run the file
 "BOP Upgrade". (With quotes)


  NOTE: You may also run the Upgrade without installing it. Double click on the
        "BOP Upgrade" icon on the original disk. You will then be prompted to
         insert "Birds Of Prey:". After the disk is inserted, it will
         load normally.

  NOTE: This Upgrade does not in any way change the original program. You MUST
        run the program each time by useing the IDD upgrade. If you do not ,
        none of the new features will operate.


  WARNING: A system with only one meg of ram is unlikely to be able to load
           from workbench with a full system installed. In this case, you need
           to boot from a copy of the Birds of Prey disk with the BOP Upgrade
           icon and file. You also have to replace the startup-sequence line
           that reads "GSG L BOP_C" with ":BOP Upgrade" (with quotes). Now it
           will boot directly into Birds of Prey as usual, but do so with the
           upgrade installed.    (See floppy installation above)

--------------------------------- NEW FEATURES --------------------------------
ALL of the following NEW features for BOP are now available using the Amiga
Smart Port from IDD!
 1. More sensitive control!  The BOP Upgrade will use the full range (0-251)
    of the AMIGA Smart Port instead of the original range provided by the game. (0-40)
 2. Mode Auto-Sensing of the Amiga Smart Port.  The game will switch between
    digital and analog modes automatically with switching of the Amiga Smart
    Port.
 3. A centering function allows for precise centering by pressing the "0" Key.
    (can be re-centered at anytime - even in flight!)
 4. Automatic joystick range scaling!  The software will adjust the joystick
    scaling to use the full range of your stick without any calibration
    procedure by moving the joystick to all extremes of travel (this is always
    active and will work at any time if you forget - even in flight!)
 5. Manual Target Tracking works!!  The original game had a bug which would not
    allow the manual target tracking to work in analog mode.  This has been
    fixed.

                 NEW KEYBOARD FUNCTIONS CHART
JOYSTICK:
            0    Center analog joystick if active.
                 Needed on startup or any time the center changes (which
                 generally causes the aircraft to drift; Not to be confused
                 with battle damage).  This will vary according to quality
                 of joystick.

                 SWITCHING BETWEEN ANALOG AND DIGITAL JOYSTICK:
                  ANALOG:
		       Press the "FIRE" button on the ANALOG joystick.
                       This activates the "PC1" light on the AMIGA Smart Port
                       and puts the hardware in analog mode.

                  DIGITAL:
                       Press the "Fire" Button on the DIGITAL joystick
                       to switch off the "PC1" light.  This deactivates the
                       analog mode of the AMIGA Smart Port hardware.

                  NOTE: The BOP Upgrade software will follow the AMIGA Smart
                        Port mode by switching from analog to digital as
                        the hardware does.

*               (performed on first start-up and as needed)                   *

******************************************************************************
IMPORTANT: The analog joystick will not function, if the light labeled "PC1"
           on the AMIGA Smart Port is not on.


IMPORTANT: You must set the center and full scale for the joystick at least
           once at the beginning of the game. (See below) This can be repeated
           as often as necessary.


USING THE ANALOG JOYSTICK:
1. Connect an analog joystick to the AMIGA Smart Port.
2. Place Port 2 of the Amiga Smart Port in analog mode by pressing the analog
   joystick "FIRE" button. (The "PC 1" light will be on)
3. The "PC1" light on the AMIGA SMART PORT should be on.
4. Make sure the analog joystick is in the center then press the "0" key to
   set the joystick center.
5. Move the joystick to all four corners of its travel to set maximum
   scale.

IMPORTANT: The analog joystick will not function, if the light labeled "PC1"
           on the AMIGA Smart Port is not on.


PROBLEM:  When I run the upgrade, it returns without doing anything.
SOLUTION: It has come to our attention that there are two versions of Birds of
          Prey. This upgrade works with the 1991 version. If the files on your
          Birds of Prey disk 2 are dated 1992, then this upgrade will NOT work.

PROBLEM:  The controls appear to behave in an abnormal manner.
SOLUTION: Use the SmartPortCal program to adjust the range of the joystick.
          Use the adjustment knobs to adjust the Smart Port such that the
          maximum value at maximum extremes in all directions does not exceed
          251.  A value of 249-251 is fine.  Even a lower value will work,
          just don't exceed a value of 251.

PROBLEM:  The game starts, but the screens are garbled.
SOLUTION: Hard disk users: Make sure the assign "Birds of Prey:" is made and
          set to the directory Birds of Prey resides in.
          AGA Users: Make sure you are booting in the ECS chip set mode.


PROBLEM:  The manual target tracking is hard to use because the target ring
          jumps all over the screen.
SOLUTION: If you have an Amiga 500 , then this is normal. Due it's known noise
          problems and the way the Birds of Prey software handles the tracking
          input, it can not be eliminated.
          If you are useing any other type of Amiga , you should not see more
          then a very slight bounce.
