This is a POOR preboot hack to allow Archon I to run on a B2000.
Boot from scratch, type archoni, then immediately boot up a
doctored archonI disk.  You doctor the disk by adding the bootblock
I will provide (ARCHONIBOOTBLOCK) with the Program SafeBoot.  
This HACK is for your use only and assumes you have expansion 
RAM at $300000.  If not it will crash.
