IMPORTANT: The analog joystick will NOT work correctly, if the light labeled
           "PC1" on the AMIGA Smart Port is not on. Press the "Fire" button
           to activate the "PC1" light and switch to analog mode.

PROBLEM: The joystick appears to behave in an abnormal manner.
SOLUTION: Use the SmartPortCal program to adjust the range of the joystick.
          Use the adjustment knobs to adjust the Smart Port such that the
          maximum value at full extremes in any directions does not exceed a
          value 251.  A value of 249-251 is fine.  Even a lower value will
          work, just do not exceed a value of 251.  Also try to get the
          center value as close to 126 as possible.

PROBLEM:  The joystick does not respond at all.
SOLUTION: Make sure the "PC1" light is on and the joystick is connected
          correctly.  Also make sure you have pressed the ALT+ "J" key to
          center the joystick.
