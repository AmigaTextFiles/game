                   InterACTIVE Digital Devices Presents:
               AMIGA Smart Port(TM) Analog Update Version 1.0
                    for Flight Simulator II by SubLogic

                     Upgrade written by Alvin Derouen




-------------------------------INSTALLATION-----------------------------------
NOTE: The default ICONS are designed for WorkBench 2.0. WorkBench 1.3 ICONS are
      also included. They have "For1.3" appended to the normal name. Just
      rename and copy over the normal one to use. (All this will do is make the
      the icons look better , there are no other differences.)


                                 HARD DISK
 Move the FS2 Update to the directory in which Flight Simulator II resides.
 This may be accomplished by either:
  A. CLI:
     Insert the original "SmartPortCal" disk in a floppy drive.
     Copy "FS2 update" and "FS2 Update.info" ( Or "FS2 update A500" and
     "FS2 Update A500.info" if you have an A500) to the hard disk directory
     that holds Flight Simulator II.
  B. Workbench:
     Insert the original "SmartPortCal" disk in a floppy drive.
     Open the directory "Analog Updates" on the "SmartPortCal" disk. Open the
     directory inside the "Analog Updates" window named "Flight Simulator II".
     Now Open the directory on the hard disk that holds "Flight Simulator II".
     Next use the mouse to move the "FS2 update" ( Or "FS2 update A500") icon
     and drop it into the hard disk window.
     (You may have to rearrange the windows to do this)


                                   FLOPPY
 Move the FS2 Update to the "SUBLOGIC FS II" disk (That is the name of the
 original disk).
   WARNING: use a copy , DO NOT use the original!!!
 This may be accomplished by either:
  A. CLI:
     Insert the original "SmartPortCal" disk in a floppy drive.
     Insert a COPY of the original "SUBLOGIC FS II" disk in a floppy drive.
     (That is the name of the Flight Simulator II disk.)
     DO NOT USE THE ORIGINAL DISK!!! Copy the "FS2 update" program and
     "FS2 Update.info"( Or "FS2 update A500" and "FS2 Update A500.info" if you
     have an A500) to the "SUBLOGIC FS II" disk.
  B. Workbench:
     Insert the original "SmartPortCal" disk in a floppy drive.
     Open the directory "Analog Updates" on the "SmartPortCal" disk. Open the
     directory inside the "Analog Updates" window named "Flight Simulator II".
     Insert a COPY of the original "SUBLOGIC FS II" disk in a floppy drive.
     (That is the name of the Flight Simulator II Disk)
     DO NOT USE THE ORIGINAL DISK!!!  Now Double Click on the "SUBLOGIC FS II"
     icon to  open up a window for the "SUBLOGIC FS II" disk. Next use the
     mouse to move the "FS2 Update"(Or "FS2 update A500" if you have an A500)
     icon in the "Flight Simulator II" window and drop it into the
     "SUBLOGIC FS II" window.
     (You may have to rearrange the windows to do this)


---------------------------------- LOADING -----------------------------------
 Just click on the Icon from the workbench , or from the cli, run the file
 "FS2 Update". (With quotes)


  NOTE: You may also run the update without installing it. Double click on the
        "FS2 Update" icon on the original disk. You will then be
         prompted to insert "SUBLOGIC FS II:". After the disk is inserted, it
         will load normally.

  NOTE: This Upgrade does not in any way change the original program. You MUST
        run the program each time by useing the IDD upgrade. If you do not ,
        none of the new features will operate.



--------------------------------- NEW FEATURES --------------------------------
ALL of the following NEW features for FS II are now available using the Amiga
Smart Port from IDD!
 1. More sensitive control!  The FS II upgrade uses the full range (0-251) of
    the AMIGA Smart Port instead of the original limited range provided by the
    game (0-40).
 2. Automatic scaling! The software will adjust the joystick scaling to use
    the full range of your joystick without any calibration procedure other
    then moving the joystick to full extremes in all directions (this is always
    active and will work at any time if you forget - even in flight!)
 3. Two versions of the update:
    FS2 Update      --- Standard update for all AMIGAS.
    FS2 Update A500 --- A500 update provides extra filtering for any A500's
                        that exhibit a large amount of "Jitter".
                        (This is a known problem in the A500 and is not caused
                         by software.)

******************************************************************************
*    Flight Simulator II - PRE-FLIGHT CHECK LIST (after entering cockpit)    *
*               (performed on first start-up and as needed)                  *
* Best is before take off. May be done at any time and repeated as necessary.*
******************************************************************************

IMPORTANT: The analog joystick will NOT work correctly, if the light labeled
           "PC1" on the AMIGA Smart Port is not illuminated. (Press the "Fire"
           button to activate it.)

IMPORTANT: You must set the center and full scale for the analog joystick at
           least once at the beginning of the game. (See details below.)
           This can be repeated as often as necessary.


USING THE ANALOG JOYSTICK:
1. Connect an analog joystick to the AMIGA Smart Port.
2. Place Port 2 of the Amiga Smart Port in analog mode by pressing the analog
   joystick "FIRE" button.
3. The "PC 1" light on the AMIGA SMART PORT should be illuminated.
4. Make sure the analog joystick is in the center position, then press the "J"
   key to set the center point.
5. Move the joystick to all four corners of its travel to set the maximum
   scale.

******************************************************************************
IMPORTANT: The analog joystick will NOT work correctly, if the light labeled
           "PC1" on the AMIGA Smart Port is not on. Press the "Fire" button
           to activate the "PC1" light and switch to analog mode.

PROBLEM: The joystick appears to behave in an abnormal manner.
SOLUTION: Use the SmartPortCal program to adjust the range of the joystick.
          Use the adjustment knobs to set the Smart Port such the maximum
          value at the extremes in any direction does not exceed a value of
          251.  A value of 249-251 is acceptable.  Even a lower value will
          work,  as long as it does not exceed 251.

PROBLEM:  The joystick does not respond at all.
SOLUTION: Make sure the "PC1" light is illuminated and the joystick is
          connected properly.  Make sure you have pressed the "J" key to
          set the center point.
