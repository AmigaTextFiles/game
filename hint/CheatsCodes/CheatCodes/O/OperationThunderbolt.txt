        On the high score table enter your name as "WIGAN NINJA", to recieve
        infinite lives.  Also if you get a score of 50,000 or more die and
        type "SPECCY MODE" on the high score table.  This will give you
        twice as many enemies.  Press 'F8', 'F7', 'F6', 'F5', 'F4', 'F3',
        'F8' and then 'F1' three times (oR 'F2' three times) ('F1' and 'F2'
        are for what player is to have the sight).  This will give you the
        laser sight thoughout the game.  Also, type "EDOM TAEHC" on the high
        score table for infinite lives.

        Usually you have to shoot equipment boxes to get the laser sight,
        but press 'F8' and fire at the same time on the title screen and you
        will start a 1 player game with laser sight. For 2 players press
        'F2' instead of 'F8' on the title screen.
