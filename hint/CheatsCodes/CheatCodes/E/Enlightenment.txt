ENLIGHTENMENT

To find secret levels at the start of the game immediately go left to the
desert, then continue left to the fire zone. Head to the uppermost left
corner of this area and you should see lava with a patch on it that looks
like a section of the Firewall spell. As quickly as you can, walk on this
patch and you'll be wisked away to secret levels.
