            
        Make two copies of disk 2 then make up your parties on both disks.
        Play the game as usual, but when you find any secret passages or
        walls, or unlock any doors, insert the other disk and continue
        playing for a short while.  This passes all the data onto this disk.
        Replace the original disk and continue playing and now, if you get
        stuck in the game and you have to start again, simply continue with
        the other disk and all the doors that were previously locked will
        be open. Plus, you'll be able to pick up the keys that you needed to
        unlock them as a bonus!
