                                ==========


                           THE WINNEMUCCA FOREST
                          -----------------------

Starting from the canoe, head east into the next screen.  Load your gun and
shoot the Iroquois the makes his way towards you, and then continue east
and enter the forest.  At the crossroads take the upper trail and head back
west.  When you arrive at the screen with the archer, go behind the trees to
avoid his arrows and then use the knife or hatchet to dispose of him.  In
the next screen you will come up against the Iroquois chief; use the
hatchet to kill him, and then take the necklace and skin.  Go back to the
last crossroads and climb the mountain, being careful not to fall off the
edge (it's advisable for you to game at the peak).  Pick up the nuggets at
the top of the mountain, and then climb all the way back down and return to
the first crossroads.  Go east from the crossroads until you come across
another archer.  To kill him, hide in the first recess, and cause him to
shot an arrow by moving diagonally backwards and forwards, then place
yourself in his line of sight, make a jump and take cover in the second
recess.  Cause the archer to fire another arrow and then use the knife or
hatchet to kill him.  Be careful of the jump in the next screen, and then
carry straight on.



                                MAC BIGGLE
                               ------------

Swap the nuggets, skin and necklace with him, and if necessary, drink a
potion.  Now continue walking east and climb to the end of the blind alley.



                            THE CANYON OF DEATH
                           ---------------------

Climb up, avoid the Apaches and then continue east; take care at the jump.
On the other side you will be attacked by two Apaches; use the gun to
dispose of these two, and then save the game.  Continue on the lower road
until you get to the next screen.  As soon as you enter, move into the
recess and reload your gun.  Fool the archer into firing at you, then move
back out of the recess and shoot him; walk east.  Kill the Apache you come
across with either the knife or hatchet.  Do the same in the next screen,
and then walk east again.  Yet again, take care on the two jumps, and after
you have got to the other side, reload the gun.  Use the gun as soon as you
enter the next screen, and then use the axe or knife to get rid of the
Apache Chief.  Change the powder horn (freeing one icon), pick up the
necklace and the peace-pipe.  Go back to the fork and take the staircase;
at the top of the stairs reload the gun, and as soon as you arrive in the
next screen use it; reload the gun once more, shoot the next Apache you
come across and then use the axe or knife to finish him off.

                                  -------

Drop the pace-pipe in front of the Hopi chief and swap it for the silver
bullet.  Return to the first room in the canyon and make two left turns and
pick up the nuggets then return to the forest.



                                MAC BIGGLE
                               ------------

Trade the nuggets and the necklaces, drink a potion and return to the
canoe.



                              BIG BEAR FOREST
                             -----------------

Take a right turn twice and then prepare to fight the first of the big
bears, there are three methods that can be used but the best is the third
method.  Firstly, you can kill the bear with a stick of dynamite and one
bullet; secondly, you can use one complete powder charge; lastly, is to
fight him with the knife.  After you have defeated the bear, go right for
two passages, take the passage at the back to save the game, and then come
back to the second passage (in front of the tree on the right) and cross
the field of rabbits.  When you fight the wolf the beast thing to do is to
hit it immediately with a low blow from the axe, otherwise you will have
to go back a pace in order to let the wolf pass in front of you so you can
give it a low blow with the axe, or, you can simply avoid it by not moving
in a straight line.  Continue right, and pick up the nugget.



                          THE GANG DOWN THE MINE
                         ------------------------

Throw the dynamite into the pile of rocks, then reload your gun and shoot
the miner.  Now select the knife or the axe and strike at the miner who
will then run away.  Start moving right and when you get to the blind alley
kill the miner you find there.  Follow Huck through the mine where a
passage will open up (NB - if there is a tree (free ?) icon, you can pick
up a nugget in the room to the right of the secret passage room); take this
passage and at the first fork take the trail at the back.  Go over a jump
and at the second fork take the door at the bottom.  Reload the gun, shoot
the miner and then finish him off.  Go to the second fork and take the door
at the back, reload the gun, and on entering the room, take a few steps
forwards and shelter in the recess.  Make the Old Timer shoot, then sue the
gun in the low position to deal with him.  Take, and then read the
parchment (drop it afterwards).  Go right and throw the dynamite into the
pile of rocks, then go to the peak where you can save.  Return to the first
fork and go through the lower door; kill the miner with the gun, knife or
axe.  In the next room advance gradually, and when you hear the waggon,
take a diagonal step into the recess (pick up the nuggets if the icon is
available), and then carry on right and kill the miner.  Continue right and
you will come across the head of the miners; if you still have some
dynamite left use it to kill him, otherwise use the gun and knife or axe.
Pick up the large nugget and return to the forest, and to the canoe.



                           IN CHEYENNE COUNTRY
                           ---------------------

Right twice - jump over the fire, turn right.  Pick up skin (if the icon is
not available, put down the object, pick up water skin, swap it at Biggle's
store for gunpowder, change the powder horn, pick up object you put down).
First fork:  take the upper road.



                                MAC BIGGLE
                               ------------

Swap the nuggets and the big nugget.  Right, second fork: take the one at
the back behind the tents.  Make sign of peace to the medicine-man, then
find out what the parchment says.  Go back to the first fork, take the
lower road in front of the tent.  Fight the giant in the same way as you
did the bear.  Go right, make the sign of peace to Chief Two Moons, find
out what the parchment says: return to the canoe.



                            TERROR IN THE WOODS
                           ---------------------

Move right (four times), kill the Indian, right, Mac Biggle, kill the chief
and take the necklace and skin.
MAC BIGGLE:    Swap the necklace and skin.  The silver bullet and potions
               can be left there; the powder horn can be swapped and you can
               drink a potion.
     Return to the third room in the forest and take the passage at the back
to the right of the rock.  Climb the mountain and fight the indian (you can
avoid him but be careful of the sheer drop).  Archer in the next room:
reload the gun beforehand, crouch down on entering, cause the archer to
shoot an arrow with standing/crouching action, then use the gun.  Jump and
then right.



                         THE MEDALLION OF COURAGE
                        --------------------------

Return to Chief Two moons and put down the Papoose.  Recover the medallion.
Take canoe at the beginning of the camp go back to the forest.  Move back
up the mountain; save in the cave and leave the cave by the right.  Keep on
going right killing all animals you encounter.



                        IN THE KINGDOM OF THE DEAD
                       ----------------------------

Save again.  Passage behind the burial-place on the right.  Note the
contents of the parchment, go right, pass in front again and to right.
Kill two wolves, right.  To kill lone wolf, load the gun with silver
bullet, take two steps to the right then use the gun, shooting low.
Because you have the medallion you will not be hurt by the Great Spirit;
take the canoe.



                              POWHATAN'S CAVE
                             -----------------

Save your position.  Take the right blind alley and climb at the bottom.
If you take the right, kill the bear with the dynamite and the gun or in
the traditional way.  Return to the left and choose the barrel on the
extreme left (move back to avoid the blast of the explosion); the Passage
of the Great Cross is open.  Left and take the lift.  Return to the mine.
Go back to the fork then go to the back to return to the peak.



                              TWO MOON'S SON
                             ----------------

At the foot of the peak, save and then climb the mountainside to the level
of the sticks.  Climb and at the top fight the condor.  Take the papoose.
Return to the mine;  Return to the cave using the lift.  Go back down the
mountain, pick up the silver bullet you had put down.  In the second room
in the forest, use the passage behind the large bush.  Left, reload the gun
and kill the indian using either of your weapons.  Right, jump, right.



                           POCAHONTA'S GOLD MINE
                          -----------------------

Right, place the medallion in front of chief, the passage opens, and that's
it - you've completed Colorado.
