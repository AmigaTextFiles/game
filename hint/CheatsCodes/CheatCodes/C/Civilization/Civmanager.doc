Overview
--------

    Civilisation  is  an  absolutely  brilliant  game,  but  it is sadly
    lacking  when it comes to saving games - you must save them  to  the
    root directory of a disk, and they have names like 'CIVIL0.map' etc.
    which make it impossible to workout which game is which from outside
    civilization.  CivManager fixes this, allowing you to save your game
    to any location, with any filename, and as a single file.




Requirements
------------

    A Copy of CivilizationAGA.

    A Hard Disk Drive (CivManager will work on a floppy disk,
                       but is totally pointless to use it, since
                       you save the root dir anyway)

    2Mb of chip memory. (Well, CivManager only uses around
    20k, but civilization needs 2Mb)

    Workbench 3.0 (Civmanager only needs 2.04, but CivAGA needs 3.0)

    The Commodore Installer Utility (Recommend, but not neccessary)





Installation
------------

    To  install  CivManager  -  Simply Click on the "Install-Civmanager"
    icon. If the commodore "Installer"  program  is  not on your current
    path,  you  must  set  the default tool of this icon to  the  actual
    location  of  your installer  with  workbenches  "information"  menu
    option.


    To install by hand:

    1) Copy "CivManager" & "DefSaveIcon.info" to your CivAga directory.

    2) Copy Reqtools.library to your LIBS: if you don't already have it.

    4) Rename the icon CivilizationAGA.info to CivManager.info

    3) Set the tooltypes of this CivManager icon:

	CIV=<Your civAGA directories path>
        FONTS=<Your civilization fonts path>
        DIR=<Your Default Game saves directory path>

       You can leave out the FONT= line if your civilization fonts are
       in civAGA/Fonts, where they are put by the civilization install 
       script.

	       
    4) Remove the 5 assigns (CIV1:, ... , CIV4: and FONTS:) from your
       s:user-startup file that were put there by the civilization
       installer program - this is done by Civmanager at runtime.




Starting A New Game Of Civilization
-----------------------------------

    To begin a new game of civilization under CivManger, double click
    the CivManager Icon.  When the reqtools filerequester appears,
    enter the name of a new file to save the game to.  (I recommend you
    end the name in ".Civil", as the default pattern of the
    filerequester is to only list "#?.Civil" files).  This allows you to
    give your files descriptive names, instead of "Civil0.map", and put
    them in a sub-directory.

    When  the  civilization  title  screen appears, select Start Game as
    usual, but when you come to save  the  game,  save  it  to  the  top
    position  on the RAM: disk. Whenever you save to the top position on
    the RAM: disk,  CivMangaer  will  copy  your  saved game to your the
    .Civil file.




Loading an Existing Game Of Civilization
----------------------------------------

    To continue a game, simply select the '.Civil' file to load from the
    file  requester.  When the civilization title screen appears, select
    load game, and load  the top file from the RAM: disk. To resave your
    game, save it back over  this file, and CivMangaer will copy it back
    to disk.

    Alternatively, shift-select the .Civil icon of the game you wish
    to play, or double click it, or create a tool manager Exec object
    & App Icon / Dock Icon for CivManager, and make the exec object of
    type WB with the arguments box checkmarked. Then you can drop game
    saves on the icon to load them into civilization, or click on the
    dock icon to bring up the file-requester.




Controling CivManager
---------------------

    Civmanager installs itself as a commodity, so it can be quit by:

	- Running It Again

        - Selecting Remove from Commodities Exchange

        - Any other standard way of removing commodities

        - You can also quit by deleting the file RAM:CIVIL0.SVE

	- CivManager does not quit when you quit civilization

    You can also suspend it (Stop it copying the file to harddisk)
    can making it inactive from commodities exchange.

    NOTE: I have not implemented any normal commodities tooltypes -
          It does not have an interface, therefore no popup or hotkey.
          It does not intercept the input stream therefore no priority.

	  I only made it a commodity, because that saved me having to
          build an interface to quit / suspend the program, and it made
          it more system friendly.




Converting Existing Civilization Saves To CivManager Files
----------------------------------------------------------

    To convert your existing civilization files, open a shell, and CD to
    the directory containing your saves, then type:

        join CIVIL0.map CIVIL0.SVE AS=<Filename>.Civil

    Where  <Filename>  is  the  full path & filename of where you wish
    to create the ".Civil" file. Repeat the process for CIVIL1, CIVIL2,
    etc. e.g.

    Join CIVIL4.map CIVIL4.SVE AS=MyGame.Civil




How Does It Work
----------------

    CivManager  uses  the  new  AmigaDOS  2.04+  Notify  facility to ask
    AmigaDOS  to  inform  it  every  time  the  file  RAM:CIVIL0.SVE  is
    modified. When it is modified, CivManager joins the  .map  and  .SVE
    files, and copies them to the file you selected. If the modification
    made was a delete, the program quits.

    Many Thanks Go To Wouter van Oortmerssen for the wonderful 'Amiga E'
    language  which  which CivManager was written, Nico Francois for the
    reqtools library,  all  those  who've  distributed installer scripts
    with  their  programs from which I gleamed  enough  information  to
    write the CivManager installer, Commodore for writing the installer,
    Jason Maskell for his example of how to program a commodity in E,
    and of course  Sid  Meier & Microprose for the best amiga game there
    is - Despite the bugs :-(
