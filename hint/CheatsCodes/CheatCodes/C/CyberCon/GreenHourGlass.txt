A MAJOR HINT:

One of the hardest puzzles in the game concerns the whereabouts of the green hourglass code.  If you don't want to spoil the game by plowing through the walkthrough, read on.....

One of the robot factories i.e. the green and yellow chevronned doors in Zone 4 (the maze) is a fake.  Just walk through and you'll find a normal corridor.

Still stuck?  Can't face opening up every bloody robot factory in the maze?


<<  SPOILER FOLLOWS!!  >>




























The fake door is in ROOM 282:  A short dead-end east-west corridor.  There are two elevators at either end of the north wall, and the door is in the middle.  See "CYBERCON_ZONE4.MAP" if you really can't find it.
