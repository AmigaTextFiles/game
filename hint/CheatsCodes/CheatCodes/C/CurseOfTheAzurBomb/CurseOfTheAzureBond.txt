        In case anyone was wondering, The `Wizard in Red' refers to
        Dracandros.  He is the owner of the Crescent Moon bond.  The `Woman
        in Green' refers to the leader of the Cultists of Moander.  They,
        of course, are the owners of the Mouth in the Hand bond, which is
        the symbol of the God Moander.  The `Lord of the Black' refers to
        the leader of the Zhentrim, or `Black Network', an evil alliance of
        priests, mages and thieves that operate out of Zhentil Keep.  They
        own the big `Z' in the Triangle bond.  Lastly, `The Flamed One' is,
        of course, good old Tyranthraxus.  He owns the Flaming Bond, which
        is the Symbol of Tyranthraxus.

        To defeat Tyranthraxus, you must gather the Amulet of Lathander,
        which is in Zhentil Keep, the Helm of Dragons, which is currently
        being kept by Dracandros in his castle near Haptooth, and the
        Gauntlet of Moander, which is kept by Mogion (the Woman in Green!)
        in Yulash.  You must take these items to the Pool of Radiance.
