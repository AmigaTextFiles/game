  There are several `random' elements within this adventure, so it is not
  possible to indicate EXACTLY where or when they occur.  The best thing
  to do is follow the procedures, detailed in these preliminary notes, to
  deal with each problem as and when it arises.
  * The first Dwarf you meet will throw an axe or small knife at you.  It
    always misses the first time.  Ignore the knife but get the axe.  From
    then on, when you meet a Dwarf, throw the axe and take it again.  One
    throw will usually suffice but you may have to repeat the action.
  * When you have some treasures the Pirate will rob you.  To retrieve
    them (also the chest, which is itself a necessary treasure) go to the
    West End of the Hall of Mists. Now follow these directions EXACTLY:
    South, East, South, South, South, North-East, East, North-West
    You will now have found the chest containing your stolen treasure.
    Take the chest AND your stolen treasures and proceed EXACTLY as
    follows:
    South-East, North, Down, East, East, Say `Xyzzy'
    You are now back at the Small Brick Building.  deposit the chest and
    treasures and resume where you left off.  The Pirate will not return.
  * When you are told that the lamp is flickering, this is a warning
    that the batteries need replacing.  Go back to the Small Brick Building
    and Get The Coins. `Say Plugh' and then `On Lamp' then proceed EXACTLY
    as follows:
    South, South, Up, West, West, West, West, West, South, East, East,
    Climb
    You will now have found the Vending Machine and you should `DROP
    COINS'.  The machine will dispense new batteries and your lamp is
    automatically `recharged'.  Now proceed:
    North, Up, East, East, East, East, East, Down, North, North, Off Lamp,
    Say `Plugh'
    You are now back at the Small Brick Building.  As the coins were a
    necessary treasure, this procedure will deduct TEN points from your
    final score!  This solution cuts a few unnecessary corners out, and
    fully utilises ON/OFF LAMP and the magic words: PLUGH, PLOVER and XYZZY
    to reduce the chances of needing replacement batteries.
  * The `Endgame' will materialise when ALL treasures have been collected
    and shortly after you are informed that the `Caves are closing'.
  * Finally, each time you `SAVE' your position, ONE point is deducted
    from your score.
