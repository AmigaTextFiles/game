                   ANTHEADS - IT CAME FROM THE DESERT II
                  =======================================

  The combination to the safe is most important - the numbers for the
combination are gained by shooting antennae off people who have ant heads.
  To shoot antennae off, simply aim at the base - if you manage to hit one,
just pull left or right on your joystick to get the other one. The safe is in
the Morgue in the basement of the hospital. When you get in, block the door
with the wheel chair so the doctors and nurses can't get in.
  Once you've revealed the Ant head plot, go to the situation map at the police
station. Place army, workmen and other townsfolk at key areas like the airport,
the town, North Volcano and the armoury. On the eighth or ninth day fly to the
ant nest, which is due North of the North Volcano. Wait until the ant appears,
then spray him. Land the plane on the road then walk to the nest. Once you've
found the queen ant and set the explosives, run back to the second
entrance - don't hang around, or the caves will collapse on your head!
