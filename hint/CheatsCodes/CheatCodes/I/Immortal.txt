  In Level 4, walk around the ring on the floor three times to open the
  floor.  In level 7, when Norlac dives underwater, you must hurry back and
  throw yourself into the whirlpool rather than climbing the ladder.   In
  level 8, to defeat the dragon and Mordamir, use the BLINK spell six
  times, then use the fire protection spell just before he breathes fire at
  you, and not when he takes a quick breath.   When he pauses, hold up the
  amulet and Mordamir will spin in.   Use the STATUE spell three times to
  avoid being killed by the lightning, then just as he starts his next
  spell, put up a SONIC spell.   Use STATUE twice more and when he animates
  the bones, hit the statue just before they reach you.   He will now say
  that you have no more defences, so wait until he holds up the amulet then
  cast the MAGNETIC spell.   Bingo - end of game.
