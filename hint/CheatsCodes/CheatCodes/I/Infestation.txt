        To get into the underground complex, first find a small, upright,
        rectangular box with two flashing squares on it; thats the computer
        terminal.  Face the flashing squares, hit 'F2' to bring up the
        computer, and enter the words "KAL SOLAR" to activate it.  hit 'F2'
        again to exit.  On your way to the computer, you should have passed
        a shower like structure.  That's the transpoorter.
