        On the title screen, type "MAJORTOM".  You should now find an option
        to play a round on mars.

        To get a hole in one everytime, choose to play as an amateur, then
        start the game.  When you putt, the {A MULLIGAN} option will appear.
        Click on {OLD} and your shots should decrease by one.  Repeat until
        you are on stroke one, and put the ball in.
