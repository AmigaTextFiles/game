    
        If you get to the penalty shoot-out and you are not very good at
        saving goals, then as the opposing team player is running towards
        the penalty spot press 'C', 'F2' and fire.  This should cause a
        white wall to spring up out of the ground in front of him, and his
        shots will either miss the goal or fly straight into your arm.
