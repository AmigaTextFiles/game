                                SPACE ROUGE
                               =============

  Firstly you must get yourself some decent weaponry. After docking at Hiathra
go see Orellian, the Imperial Representative and take your Space Pilot's exam.
The answers to this are:
 1.) 3.26
 2.) type O
 3.) F = M + A
 4.) THE IMPERIUM

  If you don't have your Space Pilot's licence you can't buy any weapons,
shields, etc which doesn't help matters.
  Talk to everyone on the base, especially VEDA (a green monster). If he sells
you some CONTACT LENSES, buy them. Go to the room where CEBAK is (the girl who
keeps talking about the greatest coin-op in the galaxy, HIVE!). Inspect the far
right SPACE SUIT on the back wall and you should find a KEY CARD. When you have
spoken to everyone, go and see the SHIP OUTFITTER. Buy 4 extra CARGO PODS off
him. Then go to the Trader and buy 8 tons of either 1GB RAMS or SUPERCOMPUTERS.
If they don't have any of these, don't buy anything.

  Next go to the MICON I outpost. Sell the 1GB RAMS or SUPERCOMPUTERS and buy
EXPLOSIVES or FORGED CREDITS. The important thing about smuggling CONTRABAND is
to remember to have a different item in your last CARGO POD. That way you don't
usually get caught. Go and see Sir Eld. He will ask you to do him a favour, so
agree to do it. Go back to HIATHRA Starbase and deliver the Statuette to The
Imperium Representatives. Sell the EXPLOSIVES or FORGED CREDITS but NOT
SUPERCOMPUTERS or 1GB RAMS. Return to MICON I and talk to Sir Eld. He will give
you some useful advice and give you a Stealth Box. Repeat this HIATHRA to
MIACON I run until you have enough credits to buy a PARTICLE BEAM LASER. Now
the fun begins!!

  Here you must make a decision. Whether you will become a PIRATE or a BOUNTY
HUNTER. Being a pirate means that you get more combat practice and get (most
importantly) more money but this also means that every ship you come across
will attack you. If you're a Bounty Hunter, at least the Merchant ships won't
attack you.
  The next item on the agenda is to get more ARMOUR. When you've got 500 of
this and your REPUTE  is FIERCE or higher, go and see DUCHESS AVENSTAR at
DENEBPRIME STARBASE in the DENEB system. Talk to the STUDENT an Deneb who will
tell you to go to NAR'SEE and say 'RAKBIT' to one of the ALIENS.
  Do this and go back to Deneb and speak to the student. She will give you a
MALIR ARTIFACT. Next go to the BASSRUTI system. Here go to the MINING STATION.
You are advised to save your position before docking with the station as there
are rather a few monsters running around the station with an unsociable
tendency to tear you limb from limb.

  When you have docked, go to the  room directly down from the docking bay. A
monster should enter here so be careful. You must try to get a table between
the monster and yourself and then run through one of the doors. When you are
sure that you have lost the monster, go to the room at the bottom left of the
station (the one with the SAFE in it) and inspect the CABINET below it. You
should find some NSBs. Now go back to the ship and fly to the ARCTURUS system
and go to the MICON II MINING STATION. Go to the MADMAN in one of the corridors
and talk to him. Select 'OTHER' and type 'NSB'. He will ask you the name of his
mission, to which you should reply 'FERRET'. He will tell you to go and see
GUT.

  Go to the KOTH carrier and use the CARD on the LOCKED DOOR. Avoid the ALARM
SQUARES and go and inspect one of the squares on the TOP WALL. You will find
the TRANSMUTATION COIL as long as you have bought the CONTACT LENSES off VEDA.
  Go back to the BASSRUTI system and soar through the vacuum to the FREE GUILD
OUTPOST. Go to CHI-SHA and say you are a ROGUE. Select 'OTHER' and say
'LUX-23A'. Agree to help her and she will come on your ship as a repair droid.
Go and see OMAR and demand to see GUT. He will tell you to go and destroy a
TITAN first. This 'small' task is not too difficult as long as you have 500
ARMOUR and decent shields. When you have done this, go back and talk to GUT.
Explain KOTH'S plot and he will tell you to go and see a BAAKILI FAR TRADER.
Say to him 'MANCHI' and offer him the MALIR ARTIFACT. When you have received
the information, go and see GUT again. He will tell you to go to TROCHAL to
steal the CHIGONGER back.

  First, go to the MICON IV MINING STATION in the ZED N27 system. Once at the
station search behind the locked door until you find a PSIONIC SHIELD. Then, go
to the TROCHAL OUTPOST in the SIGURE system and go to see VILANIE. She will ask
you to remove the shield - DON'T! She will call the guards so quickly unlock
the DOOR in her ROOM and inspect next to the EGG. Pick up the CHIGONGER and go
back to GUT. Then go to ZED N27 and talk to PROFESSOR PROSK. Give him the
TRANSMUTATION COIL and ask him for the NULL DAMPER. Explain about the EGG and
enter in the CO-ORDINATES "GC 3409". Go to the NAVIGATION CONSOLE and set
course for the MANCHI HOMEWORLD. Dock here, turn the disk over and look at the
pretty pictures.



                                   TIPS
                                  ------

  Use the map to get through the Bassruti Mining Station. If you start
wandering around the monster may sneak up and have you. It's a fairly thick
monster and escape is impossible.

                            -------------------

  Don't think about becoming a pirate or bounty hunter until you're armed to
the teeth, naturally the most expensive laser is the best (the Particle Beam);
they're very effective in cutting up Manchi and other baddies. Initially, buy
the Sapphire
