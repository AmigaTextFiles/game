                        take many hits.  Ram rather than shoot.

        HOMING WEAPONS: Retreat as fast as possible then shot them.  Most
                        homing weapons have a limited range and can be out
                        run.

        BLITZKRIEG:     The best attack is a fast one.  Attack a generator
                        by flying along power barriers at full speed.
                        Learn to recognise the edge barriers.  Barriers you
                        can shut down never merge with the edge, and nearly
                        always lead to a generator.
