                               SUPER HANG ON
                              ===============

  Have you always been fed up when you're just about to get to a checkpoint and
another biker gives you a biff & slows you down, ever felt like you could kill
the other bikers, well now you can. Here is one superdoopa cheat mode that
gives you a MACHINE GUN !!

  Get the highest score on the score table (Africa  is easiest, it may take you
a couple of goes, but persevere !)

  Now you when you enter your high score name, enter '750J' now hold down the
following keys 'CTRL' & 'LEFT ALT' & 'Z' 'T' at the same time when the title
screen is on, so when it switches to the next, instead of the next screen, you
get a blank screen and then the cheat screen. You can now enter new values
using the numerical keypad, the inner & outer coefficient alters how well you
handle corners. If you enter a high number you will be more prone to skidding
off on the corners. If you enter a low number, say 20 & 10 respectively, when
you come to a corner at about 300 mph, you can corner with no problem at all,
making it easier to complete a course, also to activate your biker
exterminator, press, or hold the left 'A' Amiga key. You will see a stream of
yellow bullets come from the front of your bike, and blow away the other
bikers. BUT there are no gun sound efx !
