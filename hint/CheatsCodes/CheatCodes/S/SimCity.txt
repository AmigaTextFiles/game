        When the title screen appears, hold down the 'SHIFT' key and type
        "FUND".  This gives you an extra 10,000 smackers.  It also causes an
        earthquake every tenth time you do it, so do it before you start
        your city.

        Another tip is to set the citizen's taxes to 0%.  Then just before
        tax collection (December or November if playing at fast speed)
        quickly set the taxes up to 20%.  Then after you collect taxes, put
        it back down to 0%.  This way the citizens think they are not
        paying any taxes.

        You can build land on water.  Find a straight (horizontal or
        vertical), stretch of coastline and string a powerline along it.
        Next, move one square over, out into the water and string another
        powerline parallel to the first.  Repeat as many times as you want.
        Then just bulldoze all the excess powerlines and you can build on
        the new land.  To make land you simply make a 3 lane highway across
        any water source.  When you make a road by putting 3 sections of
        road on top of three section of road on top of three sections of
        road (3 by 3) you make 1 section of land in the middle.
