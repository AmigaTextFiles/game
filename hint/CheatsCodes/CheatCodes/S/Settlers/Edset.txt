This is EdSet v0.8, BETA TEST, by Ed Mackey.  It is a partially functioning
version of a program that will edit save files generated by Blue Byte's
game "The Settlers."  It requires Workbench 2.0 or higher.  Currently
tested and working features include:

* MEGA-Geologist, who finds all minerals in all mountains everywhere.
  (this is the original reason for EdSet's existence, and works well!)
* Stock Mountains with Minerals, for when you're running low.
* Stock Lakes with Fish.  You won't believe the fishing production this is
  capable of giving you.  You can burn your farms, they're a waste of
  space!
* Remove Useless Objects.  Dead trees, brown rocks, etc., are erased from
  the landscape.
* An extremely flexible and powerful "stencil" function, which limits the
  actions of all other EdSet functions to certain areas of your choosing.
  For example, limit "Stock Mountains" to only your own territory.
* Empty Mountains and Empty Lakes, for your enemies.
* The ability to edit the landscape by hand, with docs on how to do this.
* Documentation can be read as text or with AmigaGuide (hypertext).

Some parts of this program are very easy to use, other parts are
complicated.  The docs will help you steer clear of the complicated stuff,
if you want to avoid it.  Please read.
