  Here are some general hints for the game:
  - While playing Wizards Squares, I find that the ball usually lands
    on Red or Blue.
  - If you have low hit points, watch out for Slasher Boars.   Also,
    steer clear of swamps and mountains, as they contain the toughest
    of monsters (Hurlers, Ice Urchins, Spikers,etc.).   Grub Snufflers
    are the best monster to meet because they have a much greater pro-
    fit ratio. (hit points against gold carried)
  - The game is finished in the realm of sorcerers, in the Dungeon of
    Despair.   You must have about 10,000 hit points and many spells
    to finish it.   An absolute neccessity is the "Scroll of Scalna",
    which can be found in the other dungeon in the realm.   The Scroll
    is a magical map, and it automatically maps your path.
  - Watch out in the dungeons, and constantly check ahead of you with
    the "Xamine" command at the bottom of the list of commands, as bear
    traps or spikes whip up and destroy your amour, or do up to 4000
    hit points damage.
  - Some weapons are better than others for killing certain monsters.
    Here is a table indicating what weapon is best against some of the
    different monsters.
                        Tanglers  -  Dagger
                        Wave Slappers  -  Rapier
                        Spincers  -  Rapier
                        Mutant Carps  -  Cudgel
                        Slasher Boars  -  Spear
                        Ramdarts  -  Bow and Arrow
                        Giant Cockroach  -  Fauchard
                        Spiker  -  Staff
  - Make sure that you have plenty of food before descending into any
    dungeons or tombs, as you may get lost and run out of food.   This
    will cause you to starve to death
  - Some magic items can help you in your quest - If you Use the wand
    of power, you gain 200 hit points, and if you Use the moonstone
    amulet, you gain 100 food.
  Here is a part solution.  If I ever get round to it, I may even update
  to the full solution someday!
