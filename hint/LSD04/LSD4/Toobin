THE GAME:
Toobin - The first of its kind. Join Biff and Jet, the tube-dudes, as
they cruise the baddest rivers in and out of this world!

GETTING STARTED:
A game for one or two, play either Biff or Jet in search of the most
outrageous party they can find. Guide the tube-dudes to places to
places even your travel agent doesn't know about!

Each river contains new and exciting backdrops to the varied obstacles
that you must negotiate. Pick up tin cans that you'll find in the
rivers to defend yourself against the shoreside creeps like punks, fly
fishermen, swamp monsters and even kamikaze penguins. Watch out for
sticks, branches and spiked logs that can easily burst your tube,

Paddle through the gates for megabonuses, but don't bumb the poles or
you'll halve your score. Hot toobers can rack up the points this way.
Don't lag behind 'cos the big 'gator is just waiting to catch those
slow toobers at the back. Hold tight as you challenge the white water
rapids.

Toobin's got lots of special features like simultaneous two player
action for double the fun, and higher levels with wild and varied
rivers from the Amazon to Mars!, taking in the Nile and the Colorado
along the way. Complete the rivers and you can join in the partying!
