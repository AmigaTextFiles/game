                                TARGHAN

Typed in by QUARTEX (i think!!). Edited by PARASITE.



   Somehere in a valley, a valley fertile enough to shelter
   human beings, a village lies.  The men who built it, gave it
   the sweet name of Edengarfin, and for generations now, joy
   and prosperity have been taken for granted.

   In this village one day, a man called Tharn married a
   woman named Fabella.

   This man, due to his charisma and cleverness was the chief
   of the tribe.  They gave birth to a boy they named Targhan
   following the advice of the old wizard Athna-An.  In the
   language of the valley.  Targhan means "the one who will
   come back".

   Then, Tharn died.  The little boy grew up, and became a
   chief in his turn.  He inherited  the qualities of his parents.
   His apprenticeship and his mastership of sword gave him
   the warriors indispensable qualities.  He never learnt that
   he would become the "Chosen" for the ultimate quest.

   When he was a child, he liked to listen to the legends that
   the wizard Athna-An was singing to him.  One of them,
   less far fetched than the others, as it seemed to him,
   has remained etched in his memory and unceasingly
   tormented his thoughts.

   He still remembered these verses:

  "Far from Edengarfin is the castle of the Evil
   One, far from your village, a lord keeps the
   secret, such a powerful lord that he cannnot be
   human, a creature floating in a world that dies
   and grows again".

   From now on, he knew that he would do anything to
   complete the legend and he was ready to leave his wife
   and tribe to live the greatest adventure ever lived before.
   And this challenge, he said to himself, he would accept
   alone, because he was the one who had been chosen.

   The formerly respected and listened Athna-An had died
   long time before Targhan became a grown up man. And
   yet, sitting on his couch in the big hut of the village, he
   saw him standing there in front of him, as before.

   The words continued to flow away with a
   supernatural harmony:
   "And now, as others went before you, as others will go
   after if you die, you must learn that this is your turn to
   face the Evil, and now it's up to you, are you
   coming back?"

   As Targhan stood up, Athna-An disappeared.  Had he really
   existed?  He, in any case, was sure of it.  He would train for the
   last time, then he would choose a reliable man capable of
   assuming the responsibilites of a chief during his absence.
   Finally, he would get ready to depart, and would promise his
   friends and his wife that he would return within a season.

   Then he left.  Athna-An appeared to him a last time:

   "Go to the East.  After the dense forest of Luneclare, you will
   have to go over the mountains of Clorg.  One talks about a
   temple which would be guarded by evil sentries.

   Finally, if at any time you see me again, make sure that it is me
   and kneel to me.

   If you ever succed, come back quickly among yours with
   the gift.

   "But now, you have to go
   and get prepared for the
   bad encounters.  I have
   faith in you, do not
   disappoint me".
