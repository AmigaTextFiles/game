WONDERBOY IS BACK!
This time as an adventurous adolescent who must slay the ferocious
fire-breathing MEKA dragon before peace can return to Wonderland.
Tom-Tom takes on the most malicious monsters ever known. Evil
anacondas, vicious vampire bats, mad mudmen and screaming skeletons to
name just a few.
Collect  treasures along the way to strengthen and protect yourself.
Revivial potins to perk up life levels, whirlwinds for long rage
battles and winged boots to fly.
There lies ahead the greatest challenge - a nightmarish adventure of
the force of good against evil, as once more the peace-loving people
of Wonderland turn to SUPER WONDERBOY to free them from the gasp of
MEKA and his murderous monsters!!!
The future of WONDERLAND is now in your hands!
