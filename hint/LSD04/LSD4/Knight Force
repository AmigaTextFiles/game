3 - THE STORY 
On Earth, thousands of years ago, lived a nation of superior
intelligence who had the secret of time travel. The secret was
possionately sought after by other nations, but only Helias, the master
of the kingdom of Belloth had the power to use it. Helias was not a
native to the nation, but he had been appointed by the gods to guard
the gates of space and time.
That was how the kingdom of Belloth became the crossroads of time and
space, with each gate being the entrance to the past and the future
times.
The people of Belloth were a very pacifist people and each individual
respected the masters power.
But Helias was extremly intelligent and realised that evil beings could
destroy any person or a complete civilisation in order to dominate
them. So he began to teach the knight and to make him aware of the
dangers surrounding the nation and their secret. Knight of Thunder
would one day be the most powerful man in the kingdom.
When King Helias' died, Knight of Thunder, the new master, was YOU.
