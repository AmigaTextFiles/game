A funny one this, is it all here???


SCENARIO
As Strider, your task is to infiltrate the Russian Red Army and return
enemy secrets to your superiors. Your mission begins in Red Square, and
after fighting off KGB attacks there, you must battle your way to the snow
capped peaks of Siberia, to confront both the elements and the enemy. If
you survive the icy test, your orders are to proceed to the southern
lowlands, where jungle tribes lurk with spears and poisoned arrows. Then
return to Moscow to face the Grand Master of the Red Army - the furure of
the western world depends on your success in this ultimate confrontation.
