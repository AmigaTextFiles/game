				PART 2


COMMAND CONTROL

The command list is utilized to pass instructions to the other helicopters in
the flight. Commands given to a section leader apply to all helicopters in 
thatsection. Helicopters in your section always fly your course, speed and
altitude unless instructed to do otherwise.


Next Unit

All commands applicable to a section leader may also be given to a single
helicopter. In this case, the helicopter deviates from the leader's control.

Press the Next Unit (n) key to toggle between the helicopters. If the 
helicopters are flying as part of a single section, the helicopters display
in numerical order. If a heavy and light section are both operational, the
other section leader displays first, followed in numerical order by the
remaining helicopters.


Fly To

Press the Fly to (f) key to establish a flight path. Up to three waypoints
can be placed. This command is applicable to your helicopter.


Hold Position

Press the Hold Position (h) key to order the section to maintain its present
position. The Section maintains its current altitude and heading, but reduces
its airspeed to 0. This command can be given to a section at any point; it
doesn't cancel existing waypoints. Pressing the key a second time cancels the
hold.

Upon reaching its destination, the section immediately assumes a hold command.


Speed

Press the Speed (s) key to modify the section's airspeed. There are three
possible settings - slow, medium and fast.

Slow speed is 50% of the possible maximum for the current altitude.

Medium speed (the default) is 75% of the possible maximum.

Fast speed is 100% of the possible maximum.

Pressing the key loops through the possible settings.


Altitude

Press the Altitude (a) key to modify the section's altitude. There are three
possible settings - NOE, contour and low.

NOE altitude (the default) is 20' higher than your present low altitude limit
setting.

                                                                  [Page  76]

Contour altitude is 150' higher.

Low altitude is 350' higher.

Pressing the key loops through the possible settings.


Land

Press the Land (l) key to order the section to land upon reaching its final
waypoint. If no active waypoints exist, the section immediately lands. The
section seeks out terrain suitable for a landing in the immediate area.


Return to Base

Press the Return to Base (b) key to order the section to immediately return to
base; all existing waypoints are cancelled. If on a deep strike mission, the
section returns to the passage point.

The section initiates the default speed and altitude unless ordered otherwise.
The section takes the most direct route to the base, and lands upon reaching
its destination.

This command is applicable to your own helicopter. It sets a single waypoint
with your base as the destination. You must initiate the autopilot or head
towards the waypoint.


Disengage

Press the Disengage (d) key to order the section to immediately break contact
and move away from all opposing forces. Upon reaching a "safe" position, the
section assumes a hold command. This command cancels all existing waypoints.

The section disregards this command if not currently in contact with opposing
forces.


Regroup

Press the regroup (g) key to order an independent helicopter to immediately
rejoin its section. It takes the most direct route, and initiates default
speed and altitude settings. This command cancels all existing waypoints.


Weapons Free

Press the Weapons Free (w) key to order a section to engage all sighted
targets. The section employs the appropriate weapons, if available, based on
target type. Pressing the key a second time returns the section's weapons to
"hold". Helicopters on "hold" status fly directly to their destinations.

The section freely employs defensive measures on either setting.

                                                                  [Page  77]

Cargo Drop

Press the Cargo Drop (c) key to order the section's cargo carrying helicopters
immediately to drop their cargo. The section's UH-60 K/L Blackhawks drop
their cargo upon reaching the Primary/Secondary waypoint.


COMMUNICATIONS

Communication is the key element to any successful operation. Since you're an
active pilot in the flight, not some desk jockey, you must rely on your
pilots to keep you abreast of developments.

During the course of a mission, your pilots communicate key information and
status updates. The message include target sightings, reaching destinations
and damage updates.

Their call sign appears on the screen, along with their message. This enables
you to fly your portion of the mission and not constantly check on flight
status.

When important situations do develop, you can immediately access the Map
View to re-evaluate and revise orders as necessary. You can also "jump on
their tail" by pressing the Flight Chase View (shift F5) key to directly
view the situation.

If, for any reason, you are unable to read an entire message, press alt m to
redisplay the last message.


Strategy

It's probably easier to just say I'll do it myself, but combat is a team
effort. The commander that best employs flight assets will be the most
successful. You could always keep the entire flight with you at all times, but
that will limit your options dramatically. Give the other pilots a chance;
they'll give you their best.

                                                                  [Page  78]

Experience

Use your flight to the best of its abilities. Inexperienced pilots may not do
exactly what you had in mind. Developing skills and moxie takes time, just as
you've probably found out by now. Experience is a measure of missions flown,
rank and decorations. Your best pilot will have flown the most missions, is
one rank under you, and has a chest full of decorations.

This pilot is your best choice for the other section leader. Avoid selecting
that wet behind the ears W-01, fresh out of flight training. Don't ask any of
them to do more than they're capable of accomplishing.


Commands

Try to envision yourself flying this leg of the mission; what would you do if
you were there? Apply a command stream that accomplishes that image. If you
give them poor orders, they'll perform poorly. You're their commander; they
look to you for the right measure.

The tactics described earlier still apply here. Fly and fight smart!


Scouts

Scouts play a very useful role as independent helicopters. Send one on ahead
to look for enemy units and/or to clear a safe flight path. It's no use
sending loaded Blackhawks into totally unfamiliar territory; their loads are
just too valuable to squander away.

A Kiowa Warrior can also mark targets for Hellfire equipped Apaches, 
SuperCobras and Blackhawks. The gunships can wait safely behind a hill while
the Kiowa Warrior is out looking for some ripe targets.


Ambush

With the opposing forces constantly on the move, it's easy to stuble across a
force occupying an area you thought was clear or just flew through a few
minutes ago. It's usually expedient to position a helicopter in covering
terrain along any suspected movement paths.

Also, a helicopter can be positioned to watch your "back door". This way you
can be confident that your means of exit is clear of enemy forces when you
need to get out quick.

                                                                  [Page  79]

Special Considerations

Upon landing, UH-60K/L Blackhawks automatically drop off their passengers,
unless at a base or FARP. Be sure they're at the correct location before
giving the orders to land. They also automatically pick up and passengers, if
in the vicinity, when they land.

Cargo drops are also automatic. Even though cargo can be successfully dropped
without making a landing, it's easier to verify the location by landing first.
Of course, if the LZ is "hot", you may be forced to drop the load and get
out quickly.

                                                                  [Page  80]

AFTER THE MISSION


MEASURE OF SUCCESS

You've landed, and are relatively safe and secure. The S2 now wants to run
through the debriefing. Never an easy read, you can't tell if he's pleased or
disappointed. The mission replay indicates how well you did this time out.

If you do nothing else, complete the primary and secondary missions, and
return safely to your base. If you can manage only one of the two, make it the
primary. Destroying additional units is always a plus, but not at the expense
of your missions. Stay focused, but flexible. The TF commander has a habit of
changing missions.

Promotions and decorations are awarded for hitting the assigned missions and
returning an intact helicopter to base. Time is also a performance measure. 
You can't spend the entire day flying just one mission; you need to get in and
get out as quick as possible. There's only so many helicopters and pilots
available, and more than enough mission to go around.


Ditching

If you land and abandon your helicopter, every attempt is made to pick you up,
but you may be captured by the opposing forces. Naturally, the chance of 
rescue increases if you're near a base or FARP. The best bet is to make it
back to base. It's better to return even if you can't complete your missions.
You can always return to fight another day.


Campaigns

When a campaign is completed, you are advised as to the outcome. This
shouldn't be any surprise, you've known the progress all along. The campaign
map is routinely updated when you attend briefings.


Promotion

Successful completion of your assigned mission improves your overall record.
An excellent record leads to promotion. However, even in combat, promotions
take time. Don't expect a promotion after every mission. As you increase in
rank, promotions are even harder to come by. After all, not everyone can be a
Brigadier General.

A reprimand on your record makes promotion more difficult. Reprimands occur
whenever you decline a mission, or you fail to achieve either the primary
or secondary mission. On the other hand, decorations for heroism move you
to the head of the promotion pack.

                                                                  [Page  81]

Battlefield Commissions

The TF commander is always on the lookout for pilots with leadership potential
If you're selected to receive a commission, you're approached by the TF
commander. The choice is yours to make; it's not required. However, accepting
the commission does open the door to the exciting world of multiple
helicopter flight.

The TF commander is persistent. He'll keep after you even if you decline a
commission. If you continue decline the offer of a commission, CW4 is the
highes rank you can attain.


Decorations

If you do exceptionally well on a mission, you may be awarded a medal for
heroism and valor. Unlike promotions, decorations are based purely on your
performance during a single mission. Your curren rank and record have no
effect on your chance of getting decorated.

In addition to the decorations for heroism and valor, two other decorations
can be awarded. The National Defense Service Medal is given for successfully
completing training, and the Purple Heart is awarded for wounds received in
combat.


MISSION REPLAY

The mission replay summarizes the key events of your mission. It shows what
went well and not so well. It's a learning experience; the next time out
apply the lessons learned from this mission.


Film Library

Upon the completion of a mission, or if you access the mission films through
the Squadron Archives, the Film Library panel appears.

Here you select the film to view; the last mission flown is always titled
"Last Mission". To select a film, position the cursor on the title line and
press Selector #1; the selected title highlights. Press "Play" to begin the
replay.

From this control panel, you may also rename and delete mission films.
Remember, if you wish to save the current mission, you must rename "Last
Mission" or it'll be lost after the next mission.

Once you fill the entire page, the slide bar to the right is used to scroll
the film listing.


External Viewpoint

In this, the default viewpoint, replay displays the actual combat films from
your mission. You are there again with your flight, with an "out of body"

                                                                  [Page  82]

view of all the action. A short mission summary is displayed at the top of
the replay screen.

A running list of events is displayed on the panel. This way you can follow
along with the action as it happens.


Controls

Replay uses a "VCR" type panel to control the replay functions. During the
Conventional Replay, the Controller is used to position the cursor over a 
key; press Selector #1 to activate the key. As an alternative, the tab and
shift keys can be used to position the cursor.
                                 __
Position over and press the  /\  \/  |>  <|  keys (or press directional keys)
to adjust the point of view. ~~

Position over and press the  | <| <|   key (or press the r key) to rewind to
the beginning of the replay.
                              _
Position over and press the  |_|  key (or press the s key) to stop the replay.

Position over and press the  |>  key (or press the p key) to start the replay.

Position over and press the  |> |   key (or press the n key) to fast forward
to the next event. Upon reaching the next event, replay automatically shifts
into the "play" mode.

Position over and press the  |> |>  key (or press the f key) to fast forward.

Position over and press the  1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 keys (or press the respective
numeric key) to shift the view to that helicopter. If the mission type was
"Single", only the "1" key is active.

Position over and press the  T  key (or press the t key) to shift the view to
the target.

Position over and press the  RESUME key (or press alt x) to resume the fight.

Position over and press the  DEMO key (or press alt y) to activate the Demo
Viewpoint. Press alt y to return again to the external viewpoint.


Demo Viewpoint

The replay takes the "pilot's" viewpoint. In this mode, you view the mission
from the pilot's seat. All actions are replayed exactly as they occured in
the actual mission.

To exit the replay, press alt e, this returns you to the game. To return to
the control panel, press alt y.


Resume Flight

Replay offers one additional exciting feature. You can jump in and take over a
flight at any point during the replay! Position the cursor over the Resume key
and press Selector #1 (or press alt x).

                                                                  [Page  83]

This feature is an excellent combat tool for learning and developing tactics.
You can re-fly a tough mission, change your tactics, and observe the impact
of a revised plan of attack. Or, you can re-enter another pilot's mission, and
see if you can top their results. These "films" are loaded via the squadron
archives file.

When you re-enter a mission, you are positioned in the #1 helicopter and are
now in control with all game controls active.

The results of a re-entered mission never affect your record, nore are the
results of this "mission" recorded for future viewing. The original replay
remains intact.

To exit, press alt e; this returns you to the game.


FLIGHT PROMOTIONS

The pilots in your flight are also eligble for promotions and decorations.
The high command makes recommendations as to who should be promoted and who
should receive decorations. As the flight commander, you're authorized to
accept the recommendations or transfer the awards to other pilots.

To change a recommendation, highlight the award and press Selector #1. The
award is transferred to the next pilot. Promotions are automatically adjusted
to the next higher rank. A pilot can't be promoted to a rank equal to your
current rank. Decorations are awarded as presented.

When you concur with the recommendations or changes, highlight the Accept key
and press Selector #1.


REPLACEMENTS

If you're ever faced with the unfortunate situation of having lost a pilot in
combat, you'll automatically receive a W-01 replacement from the pilot pool.

If you're not satisfied with the replacement or you with to change an existing
pilot, the pilot replacement screen is provided to make these administrative
changes. You may replace the pilot, but the new pilot's rank and decorations
are comparable.

Highlight the pilot to be replaced, and press Selector #2. Enter the name of
the new replacement and then press Selector #1.

                                                                  [Page  84]

                                3. THE HELICOPTER


HISTORY OF DEVELOPMENT


Father of the Helicopter

Leonard da Vinci is widely considered to be the "Father of the Helicopter."
In the late 15th Century, da Vinci developed the first theories of flight, and
designed a screw-like rotary-wing aircraft that operated on the principles he
developed.

Da Vinci's Helix had a large, screw-like rotary wing. Da Vinci had theorized
that air has a "substance", or density, and that a lifting force could be
generated by pushing down against it; it would, theoretically, bore through
the substance of the air like an auger bit through wood.

While a full-size version of da Vinci's Helix never flew, some small working
models were produced. The problems that faced da Vinci's craft would confront
every would-be-inventor of a self-propelled helicopter. The power plant and
structure of the aircraft needed to be kept low, the torque produced by the
spinning propellers had to be counteracted, and the craft had to be
controlled.


The Helicopter Takes Shape

The next significant step toward rotary-winged flight occurred in 1783, at the
World's Fair in Paris. Two Frenchmen, Launoy and Bienvenu, created a toy
rotary-wing craft with four feathered propellers. The propellers were placed
on either end what was basically a stick, and turned independently of one
another in opposite directions.

The toy, drive by a wind-up bent-bow system, managed to fly up to altitudes
of seventy feet, and provided a great deal of inspiration for other inventors.
But they still lacked a propulsion plant strong enough to generate the lift
needed to get larger craft airborne. It would be nearly another hundred years
before inventors would have any significant successes.

In 1862, another Frenchman named Ponton D'Amecourt developed a steampowered
helicopter. The craft had coaxial propellers, counter-rotating wings spinning
about the same axis. The helicopter's steam engine was made of aluminium, and

                                                                  [Page  86]

weighed only four pounds. While the power-to-weight ratio of the craft was 
still too low for it to get airborne, it bobbed and bounced on the ground on
the threshold of flight. This alone encouraged inventors to continue.

By 1870, an Italian inventor, Enrico Forianni, met with some success. His
steam-powered coaxial helicopter weighed only six and a half pounds, but it
managed to fly up to heights of 40 feet and for a duration of 20 minutes.
Rotary flight, albeit unmanned rotary flight, was a reality. But the hurdles
to manned flight - the power-to-weight ratio and control of flight - still
remained.

The first breakthrough in manned rotary flight would not come until 1907, four
years after the Wright brothers' first flight at Kitty Hawk. The development
of internal combustion engines had finally produced a power plant with a 
sufficient power-to-weight ratio to be effective, and yet another Frenchman,
Paul Cornu, set out to take advantage of that new technology.

His craft had dual rotors, one placed forard and the other at the rear of the
fuselage. Each rotor measured twenty feet in diameter. The rotors were 
connected by drive belts to a 24-horsepower internal combustion engine. For
control of flight, Cornu had placed tilted vanes below each rotor.

The belts slipped and the rotors spun unevenly, but Cornu's helicopter became
airborne. His flight was short, and he only managed to rise a few feet above
the ground, but he had flown!

Many other helicopter designs followed; but for the next ten years, few met
with any greater success than Cornu's. Control remained the greatest problem.
And while World War I had a drastic effect on the evolution of the airplane,
it produced few advances in powered rotary-wing flight.

The 1920s saw two major step forward in rotary wing aircraft design. The first
was in 1922, when Raul Pateras, an Argentinean, built (with the backing of the
French military) a coaxial helicopter with controlled-pitch propellers. The
controllable pitch of the rotor blades while in flight increased the 
maneuverability, and the craft also demonstrated the effect of autorotation -
allowing the rotors to spin freely in unpowered flight to slow descent.


The Autogiro

The second major step forward came not in the form of a helicopter, but from
an entirely different aircraft. Juan de la Cierva, a Spanish airplane 

                                                                  [Page  87]

designer, decided to investigate rotary winged flight in 1924, and soon after
unveiled an entirely new type of aircraft - the autogiro.

Rather than using a powered rotary wing for lift, the autogiro has a freely
rotating overhead wing that is allowed to windmill. The forward motion of the
aircraft through the air, generated by the thrust of a conventional propeller,
causes the rotor to spin and generate lift. Consequently, the autogiro
cannot hover; but it can take off and land in a substantially smaller area 
than conventional aircraft. In 1928, de la Cierva flew his autogiro across
the English Channel, attaining an airspeed of nearly 100 miles an hour.

The autogiro found its way into the hands of the military in limited numbers,
mostly for evaluation purposes. One was the first rotary aircraft flown off
a ship, launched from the carrier USS Langley on September 23, 1931; another
was evaluated by the Marine Corps during operations in Nicaragua in 1932.
Admiral Richard E. Byrd used an autogiro during his exploration of the
Antarctic in 1933 and 1934, and the Army tested several autogiros between
1935 and 1938.

But all of these craft were "of-the-shelf" civilian models, and little more 

                                                                  [Page  88]

was done with the craft. Some military applications, such as antisubmarine
warfare and artillery spotting, were noted, but there was little real 
interest in further development; its low payload capacity and its inability to
take off vertically made it unsuitable for what the military had in mind.


World War II

The Second World War accelerated the development of helicopters dramatically,
especially in Germany. The first truly practical helicopter, the Focke-
Achgelis Fa61, was built for the Third Reich by Dr. Heinrich Karl Johann
Focke, and flew for the first time on June 26,1936 (even though he had been
marked by the Nazis as being "politically unsafe").

The Fa61 was a single-seat aircraft, with side-by-side threebladed rotors and
a conventional propeller for forward thrust. Both the rotors and the propeller
were powered by a single 160 horsepower engine.

The craft proved to be difficult to fly at first; eventually, it was mastered
by Hanna Reitsch, one of Germany's most respected test pilots. In February of
1938, she flew the Fa61 in the Berlin Deutchlandhall sports arena, 
demonstrating the helicopter's incredible handling characteristics. She later
described the experience as "intoxicating." 

Reitsch and the Fa61 went on to set numerous world records for rotary flight
between 1937 and 1939, proving the practicality and reliability of the
helicopter once and for all. Among its records were a top speed of 77 miles
per hour, a distance of 143 miles, and an altitude of 11,243 feet.

While Dr. Focke did not intend the helicopter for military applications, the
Nazis had other ideas. Another German, Anton Flettner, built what is 
considered to be the world's first military helicopter - the F1 282 Kolibri.
The Kolibri had twin counter-rotating propellers that turned in 
synchronization, their planes of rotation intermeshing. Flettner's Kolibri
flew for the first time in 1940, and by 1942 was operational on German 

                                                                  [Page  89]

airships and escorts in the Mediterranean, Aegean, and Baltic Seas. Eventually
a modification of the Kolibri was used for antisubmarine warfare.

Another Focke design, the Fa 233 Drache, was the world's first transport
helicopter. The Drache, which carried six passengers and could carry a cargo
load suspended from a cable, was tested extensively for use as a general
purpose transport for mountain troops. Allied bombing raids destroyed all but
seven, and by 1945 only three remained serviceable. These were formed into the
first (and only) WWII Luftwaffe helicopter squadron, Transportstaffel 40.

While more Fa 233's were built, only one additional helicopter was ever
completed. At the end of the war, only two operational helicopters remained.

In the United States, Igor Sikorsky's Sikorsky Aircraft Company received a
contract from the U.S. Army for a two-passenger observation helicopter.
Sikorsky had earlier demonstrated a prototype helicopter, the VS-300, and the
success of that aircraft had finally drawn the interest of the Army back to
rotary-winged flight.

In January of 1942, Sikorsky's Army prototype, the XR-4, flew for the first
time. By the time it was delivered to the Army on May 17, 1942, it had broken
practically all of the existing worl records for helicopter operations. The
U.S. military was now thoroughly convinced of the helicopter's potential.

The XR-4's design, like Sikorsky's VS-300 before it, utilized a single rotor
with three blades, and a tail rotor to counteract the torque of the main rotor
This design set the standard for the great majority of American helicopters
that followed it.

By the end of WWII, over four hundred Sikorsky helicopters of three designs
were flying for the Army, Navy and Coast Guard, and for the British Navy and
RAF. They served as scouts, delivered mail to ships at sea, and served as
rescue craft during carrier operations. In addition, the growing need for
antisubmarine platforms gave the helicopter an active combat mission in fleet
operation; with the advent of the dipping sonar in the mid-1940s, the
helicopter became a viable sub-hunter.

In 1944, the helicopter saw its first duty as a combat search and rescue
(C-SAR) and medevac craft, during operations in Burma. In April of that year,
Sikorsky R-4 helicopters attached to the U.S. Army's First Air Commando Group

                                                                  [Page  90]

based at Hailakandi, India, were fitted with fuel tanks from fixed-wing
aircraft to extend their range, and were flown behind enemy lines to rescue
the crew and passengers of a light British medevac aircraft. The mission
was a success, and the R-4 was called upon almost daily afterwards for other
SAR missions.


The Malayan Emergency

The first real conflict in which helicopters were used extensively was the
Malayan Emergence, a counter-insurgency war fought by the British for twelve
years beginning in 1948. By the time the Korean War began, the British already
had nearly forty thousand troops fighting a guerilla war against Chinesebacked
communist insurgents. British forces depended heavily on helicopters in this
jungle war, for medical evacuation, troop transport, observation and
reconnaissance. The operational flexibility of helicopters, along with their
ability to deploy and retrieve troops in jungle terrain, proved their worth in
combat beyond a shadow of a doubt.


The Korean War

The Korean War was to U.S. helicopter aviation what the Malayan Emergency was
to the British. During the course of the war, the helicopter was used by all
four branches of the armed forces, and tactics were developed for their use.

While the helicopter was primarily used for transport, medevac, search and
rescue, and reconnaissance by all of the service, there was some unofficial
experimentation with gunship tactics. For the first time, helicopters became
a threat to enemy troops.

The first shots fired in anger from a helicopter were from a U.S. Navy
helicopter in January, 1951. Lieutenant, j.g.John W. Thorton and his crewman,
Petty Officer Whitaker, experimented with light attack helicopter tactics by
firing .45 caliber pistols and carbine rifles and dropping grenades from their
HO3S-1 on North Korean troops. If fragmentation grenades were not available,
LTJG Thorton would obtain percussion grenades and tape nails to them, so they
could "nail them to a tree."

These tactics did not endear Thorton to the North Koreans, nor to his fellow
pilots. The North Koreans quickly learned that the helicopter was a potential
threat, and soon were firing upon all they saw.

The HO3S-1 had been the subject of another experiment in helicopter armament a
year earlier, at Lakehurst Naval Air Station in New Jersey.

                                                                  [Page  91]

Mechanics at Helicopter Utility Squadron One (HU-1) attempted to install
swivel gun mounts with .30 and .50 caliber machine guns in the doors of a
helicopter. Unfortunately, the airframe wasn't strong enough to support the
guns, and when they were fired, they nearly ripped the sides of the aircraft
off. The experiment was only slightly ahead of its time.

The Army experimented with the idea of an armed helicopter during the war.
The need for armament aboard helicopters became apparent when the H-19 troop
transport helicopter was deployed to Korea - it proved to be extremly
vulnerable during troop assault landings. The Army tried mounting a bazooka
on an H-13 helicopter in 1950, with little success; three years later, the
Army tried a grenade launcher, with the same result.

American experience with the helicopter during Korea led to the development
of the "Air Cavalry" concept. General Matthew B. Rideway, who had seen the
importance of the helicopter in Korea, reorganized Army aviation in January
1955, and laid the foundation for the modern "Air Cav". Accompanying this
new organizational concept was that of a "helicopter gunship".

In 1956, the Army began testing various types of helicopter armament again,
with the goal of providing an effective for providing suppressive fire during
assault landings. Air Cavalry units experimented with .30 and .50 caliber
machine guns, rockets, and varioius cannons. Eventually, these experiments
led to the formation of an aerial combat recon company in 1958.

The French would be the first to apply the gunship concept under actual
combat conditions. During the bloody French-Algerian War, the French Army
and Air Force applied the American experience with helicopter armament to
their Vertol H-21's twin rotor helicopters originally built for troop
transport.

The French used several mixes of armament, from .30 and .50 caliber machine
guns to 37mm rockets and 20mm cannon in their war against the Muslim rebels.
The French also armored their helicopters, using self-sealing gas tanks, and
fiberglass armor plating around engine compartments and the cockpit. After
adding weaponry and armor to their helicopters, the French did not lose
any helicopters to ground fire. The French also pioneered the development of
a helicopter-launched anti-tank missile, in 1958.

While the French had some success with the use of helicopters during the

                                                                  [Page  92]

French-Algerian War, in the end they were forced to quit Algeria, granting
their former colony independence. The helicopter alone could not win a 
guerilla war. Still, the utility of the armed helicopter had been proven, and
important lessons had been learned about its employment.

But the real test of "Gunship" weapons and tactics would come with the
escalation of a war in another former French Colony - Vietnam.


The Vietnam War

The Vietnam War has often been called the "Helicopter War" because of the
pivotal role that helicopters played in all aspects of the conflit. U.S.
forces depended heavily on the helicopter because of its utility and flexi-
bility in an environment similar to that the British faced in Malaya during
the early '50s. During the conflict, more helicopters, and more types of
helicopters would be used than ever before. Some eighteen types of helicopters
were flown by U.S. pilots over the course of the war (many of which are still 
in service today in some capacity). The war also saw the first widespread use
of gas turbinepowered helicopters in all facets of operations.

The first gas turbine-powered helicopter deployed to Vietnam became a symbol
of the war itself - the UH-1 Iroquois, more commonly knows as the Huey.
First delivered to the Army in 1959, the Huey was commonly referred to early
on as the "helicopter ambulance," despite its multi-role design. The Huey
was remarkably successful in all of its roles, and eventually over nine
thousand were built - many are still in service.

The UH-1B Huey became the first true helicopter gunship. It was built with
universal wiring and "hard points" for the attachment of various weapons
systems. Three weapons were used by the UH-1B: the XM-6 quad (four 7.62mm
machine guns and four grenade launchers, mounted in pairs on each side of
the ship), the XM-3 rocket pod system (two pods of 24 2.75 inch rockets),
and the SS-11 guided anti-tank missile (three guided missiles mounted on each
side of the helo). While the XM-3 and SS-11 systems were not available early,
the XM-6 quad was almost universally in use as early as 1962, giving the Huey
a lethal punch.

Huey 1A's were also equipped with weaponry, though their lower turbine
power and lack of universal wiring limited the range of weapons available.
They were equipped with two fixed rocket pods and two 30-caliber machine guns,
mounted on the skids of the aircraft.

                                                                  [Page  93]

The first Huey 1A's and 1B's to arrive in Vietnam were organized into the
Utility Tactical Transport Helicopter Company (UTTHCO). The 1B's proved to
be much more flexible in meeting the needs of the local commanders. Almost
as important as the 1B's better armament mix was its higher shaft power,
essential for maneuverability in the high humidity of Vietnam. The gunships
provided light close-in fire support for assault landings of airborne troops,
and were essential to the evolution of the "airmobility" strategy of the 
U.S. Army.

The "airmobility" concept emerged in the early sixties as a product of a study
by a board of Army officers convened by Secretary of Defense Robert MacNamara.
The Army Tactical Mobility Requirements Board, also known as the "Howze Board"
(for its chairman, General Hamilton H. Howze, an experienced Airborne 
commander), recommended the substitution of helicopters for a large amount of
the Army's ground transportation. All Army units would be equipped with 360
air vehicles to every 2000 wheeled land vehicles.

The committee also recommended the formations of specialized, completely
airmobile "air assault divisions". The concept of Air Assault Division was
tested by a skeleton division formed at Fort Benning, Georgia, in 1964. During
exercises in North and South Carolina, the division proved itself against the
82nd Airborne.

The Secretary of Defense recognized the effectiveness of such a unit, and gave
the Army the approval to proceed with organization of the first airmobile
division. The division selected for this honor was the famed 1st Cavalry
Division. On July 28, 1965, President Johnson ordered the 1st Cavalry Division
(Airmobile) to Vietnam.

As the war excalated, and helicopters took increasing amounts of ground fire
from heavy antiaircraft weapons, it became apparent that a dedicated 
helicopter gunship was needed. The UH-1B, while highly successful, was limited
in its capabilities - it was, after all, just a modified logistics helicopter.
Bell helicopter had foreseen the Army's need, and was preparing to meet it. In
1966, the Army ordered its first true gunship - the Bell AH-1 Huey Cobra.

The Cobra was based on the UH-1B, but had some major innovations. The airframe
was narrow, presenting a very small head-on target. The very look of the 
helicopter suggested its purpose - it was death from above for the enemy.

                                                                  [Page  94]

The first Huey Cobra went to Vietnam in 1968. Perhaps their most famous role
in the war was the operations conducted by AH-1's over the Ho Chi Minh Trail,
ambushing North Vietnamese and Viet Cong supply trains. It was during these
ambushes that Cobra pilots developed tactics like "Cobra Stacking," flying one
above the other to maximize the amount of ordnance delivered on a small area.

But the AH-1s also earned their keep in the troop transport escort role as
well, protecting assault helicopter landings and providing "instantaneous fire
suppression". The Marine Corps found them vital to carrying out their mission.

With a broad range of weaponry, high speed and high maneuverability, the Cobra
proved to be a very important asset to American field commanders; its success
insured the long line of gunships that followed it. Many other nations have
copied it, and the Army and Marine Corps use modifications of the AH-1
(particularly the AH-1W SuperCobra) to this day.


Afghanistan

Vietnam was the proving ground for American gunships; for the Soviets, 
Afghanistan served a similar role.

While the Soviets had been pioneers in heavy lift helicopter design and
construction, and had been arming helicopters since they early 50s, their
first helicopter gunship was not introduced until 1972. The Mi-24 Hind-A was
really a heavily armed and highly mobile transport helicopter. It is believed
that the Hind-A was designed to act as its own fire support during troop
insertions; the Soviet staff believed at the time that they could not afford
a large number of single-purpose helicopters.

Soviet attitudes about gunships changed over time, and the Hind went
through a series of modifications. The Hind-D was equipped with a nosemounted
gatling gun. Still, the Hind retained its transport capability; the Hind-E,
introduced in 1976, can carry up to ten troops with its full weapon load.
With its weaponry and heavy armor, the Hind is comparable to a very fast
and meneuverable flying armored personnel carrier.

In December of 1979, the Soviets invaded Afghanistan under the pretenses of
an invitation by the Aghani government. By mid-January, the Soviets had
more than 75,000 troops in the country.

                                                                  [Page  95]

The Hind gunship was the workhorse of Soviet aviation in Afghanistan; nearly
200 of them were deployed by January of 1983. The Hind served in a role
similar to the Cobra in Vietnam, escorting troop transports in assault on
guerilla concentrations. But like the French in Algeria and the Americans in
Vietnam, the Soviets faced an enemy that enjoyed considerable freedom of
movement, superior knowledge of the terrain and had the will to fight. The
Mujahadeen also had U.S. made stinger anti-aircraft missiles, a great threat
to the Soviet helicopter forces.

One Soviet soldier said after the war, "You could tell when a landing zone
was really hot by the number of assault troops they put on a helicopter. The
more men a (Hind) had to land, the longer it was vulnerable to guerilla fire.
If you had four or five to a helicopter, it wasn't too bad. If you had two or
three to a helicopter, you knew it was really bad."

As the therat to Soviet helicopters increased, more and more infrared decoys
(essentially flares) were carried to draw away the Stingers of the Mujahadeen.
And the Soviets also reportedly deployed chemical weapons in large numbers
from Hinds.


Grenada - Operation Urgent Fury

In 1983, the U.S. and a coalition of Caribbean States invaded the isle of
Grenada to overthrow the oppressive Marxist military junta that had recently
taken power.

During the invasion, code-named Operation Urgen Fury, U.S. Army and
Marine forces met stiff resistance from Cuban "advisor" forces, and fought a
heavily armed and fortified force holed in the island's fortress prison. AH-1
Cobra gunships proved their versatility and, unfortunately, their 
vulnerability during engagements with these force. Army Cobras and Mrine
SeaCobras provided close air support and assaulted the fortress with TOW
missilis, but two of them were lost to ground fire.

Other Marine helicopter forces were used in the mission to rescue American
students at the St. George's Medical School. These Marine Sea Knights were
used as well for "vertical envelopment" assaults on the island in the early
stages of the operation.

Lasting only a few days, the operation is not considered to be one of the high
points in U.S. military history. It's generally felt that U.S. forces will

                                                                  [Page  96]

ill-prepared for the level of opposition, and rushed into the operation with
too little planning. In any event, its effects went a long way to shape the
future of helicopter operations.


The Apache is Born

In the early 70s, the U.S. Army sought a heavy gunship in the form of the
AH-56 Cheyenne. The program was cancelled, however, and for the remainder of
the decade, the only heavy helicopter gunships in the U.S. inventory were on
paper. The Cobra was called upon to fill the gap.

The 70s saw an increased emphasis on the anti-armor capability of the
helicopter gunship. With the addition of the TOW missile to the Cobra (and
later the SuperCobra), and similar weapons to the helicopters of other nations
the gunship was becoming a real "force multiplier", with greater anti-armor
capability than most ground units.

In 1976, the Hughes Aircraft design for the all-weather heavy helicopter
gunship, the AH-64 Apache. It would be stuck in development for another
six years before the production line got rolling. In the meantime, the U.S.
invaded Grenade in 1983. The Cobra provided the only dedicated gunship
capabilities available at the time.

Now fully operational, the Apache is the front-line anti-armor aircraft of the
U.S. Army. The AH-64 marks the true beginning of a new generation of
helicopter gunships - highly automated, heavily armed, and capable of combat
in all weather, night or day. While the airframe is essentially a conventional
helicopter, the advanced electronic systems about the Apache make it the link
to future helicopter gunships. It is being considered for a number of other
mission areas, including anti - ship missions.

There is still a great deal over debate as to which type of helicopter 
technology should be the basis of the next generation of gunship.

Panama - Operation Just Cause

In the early months of 1989, relations between the U.S. government and the
regime of General Manuel Noriege in Panama were rapidly deteriorating, and
by the end of spring, events had reached a flash-point. After a number of
violent incidents, including the killing of an off-duty American soldier by
Panamanian Defense Force (PDF) troops, the crisis escalated, and the United
States mounted an invasion of Panama to remove General Noriege and put the
elected president of Panama in power. Operation Just Cause, as the invasion

                                                                  [Page  97]

was called by the military, lasted only a few days, but it demonstrated the
lethality of modern weapons.

Operation Just Cause saw the first use of Apache helicopters in actual combat.
AH-64A Apaches were used in the attack on the PDF Commendancia in downtown
Panama City - the helicopters were used against targets on individual floors
of the building. Ground based laser designators were utilized to pinpoint
the targets for the deadly accurate Hellfire missiles.

While, there was no opposition to U.S. helicopters during the operation, the
Apache proved itself an effective weapon nonetheless.


The Persian Gulf - Operations Desert Storm and Sabre

The Apache would get its first real test on the battlefield during the quick
and bloody war with Iraq in January and February of 1991. On August 5, 1990,
Saddam Hussein's army invaded the city-state of Kuwait, and Hussein
proclaimed its annexation. The United States quickly mobilized a coalition of
nations to come to the defense of Saudi Arabia, and began putting pressure on
Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait.

By January, the United States had completed the largest deployment of troops
since Vietnam, and was ready to take back Kuwait by force, With the aid of
the British, Italian, French, Saudi and Kuwaiti air forces, an air offensive
was launched on January 16 against Iraqi forces in Kuwait and Iraq. Apache
gunships played a significant role in the early air campaign, attacking Iraqi
positions in Kuwait and Iraq.

The first mission for the AH-64 came during the first hours of the war. On the
night of January 17, Apaches were sent in to take out two Iraqi electronics
installations near the Saudi-Iraqi border. The Apaches launched Hellfire
missiles at several targets in Kuwait and Iraq, including mobile air defense
sites and electronic sites. All objective targets were destroyed. In some
cases, it was reported that Special Forces troops provided forward laser
designation for Hellfires launched by Apache gunships.

The night-fighting abilities of the Apache were used heavily during the first
phase of the war. Apaches were used against a variety of fortified targets
during night operations, including Iraqi artillery batteries and radar sites.
Iraqi forces attempted to begin the ground war on their own terms in early
February, by invading the Saudi coastal city of Kafji. Apache helicopters took

                                                                  [Page  98]

part in a night time assault on the Iraqi armored forces there, and during
combat accidentally fired on U.S. armored vehicles, killing two American
soldiers. This incident highlights the hazard of the modern battlefield, where
smoke, fire and darkness can make it difficult to separate the enemy from
friendlies on the ground.

With allied air superiority established, Apache gunships and other helicopter
forces raided the Iraqi rear at will. On February 20, OH-58D Kiowa Warriors
and AH-64A Apaches destroyed "fifteen to thirty" Iraqi bunkers in Kuwait, and
421 Iraqi soldiers surrendered to them. Only one US serviceman was killed in
the operation.

In the early hours of February 24, a combined allied air-ground offensive
began. The operation, code named Desert Sabre, lasted 100 hours, and nearly
completely destroyed the Iraqi armed forces in and near Kuwait. Apache and
Cobra gunships played an important part in the offensive, taking part in some
of the largest armored battles since World War Two. In fact, the first shots
fired during the operation were by Apache gunships.

The 1st Marine Division was assigned one of the more difficult missions of 
the offensive - a frontal assault on Iraqi defensive lines in Kuwait. After
punching through Iraqi fortifications, the division pushed on toward Kuwait
City. In a battle with an Iraqi armored brigade and mechanized infantry
brigade near the Burquan oil fields, Marine AH-1W SuperCobras and ground 
forces destroyed about 30 enemy vehicles. This battle proved to be only a
prelude to the tank battle that would follow at Kuwait International Airport,
where an estimated 310 Iraqi tanks were destroyed.

To the west, the 101st Airborne began a heliborne assault into Iraq, with over
460 Blackhawk, Apache and other helicopters. Their operation, nicknamed 
"Cobra", severed Iraqi roads along the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, and cut
off the only Iraqi escape route to the north.

On February 28, the operation ended, having taken over 80,000 Iraqi POWs and
having destroyed or "rendered ineffective" at least 40 of the 42 Iraqi
divisions. No US aircraft were downed during the last phase of the war - a
tribute to the level of organization planning employed and to the men and
women that took part in the operation

The operation more than reaffirmed the role of the helicopter in modern
combat operations.

                                                                  [Page  99]

The U.S. Army

Today, the Army deploys its helicopters as integral parts of nearly every type
of division, from light infantry to heavy armor. As a result, the battlefield
commander of any Army formation will have some "organic air support" within
his assets. The highest concentration of helicopters of all types is within
the airborne and air assault divisions; within a typical air assault division,
for example, there is one full squadron of air cavalry and an aviation
brigade consisting of eight helicopter battalions.

The air cavalry squadron's primary missions are "airmobility" and 
reconnaissance, so its aircraft will be of the troop transport variety - the
UH-60 Blackhawks and probably a few UH-1 Hueys. In addition, the squadron will
have some AH-1 Cobra gunships for escort and air reconnaissance.

A squadron will usually have about 950 soldiers assigned to it; 70 
commissioned officers, 100 warrant officers and 780 enlisted men. These 
personnel are divided among the squadron's four "troops" and headquarters
"troop." A single troop of air cavalry will have about 200 men assigned, with
15 commissioned officers and 32 warrant officers among them.

The aviation brigade within an air assault division is made up of some 1000
personnel, and is broken down into four mission groups: assault, medium lift,
command, and attack. Two assault helicopter battalions are dedicated to the
combat troop transport mission, and arre equipped with UH-60's. The medium
lift helicopter battalion, equipped with CH-47 Chinook cargo helicopters, 
provides logistical air support for the division, while the command helicopter
battalion provides administrative, scouting, and command and control support
for the division commander with its UH-1 Hueys and OH-58 Kiowa scouts.

The other four battalions of helicopters in the aviation brigade are attack
helicopter battalions. These units are equipped with a mixture of aircraft,
including AH-64 Apaches, OH-58 Kiowas and probably some AH-1S SuperCobras.
These units are manned by some 20 commissioned officers, 44 warrant officers,
and 177 enlisted men per battalion.

In addition to these air assets, the division will also have an air ambulance
company assigned to its medical battalion, equipped with UH-60 and UH-1
helicopters and dedicated to air medical evacuation.

The number and type of helicopters that are assigned to a unit may vary with
the theater of operation that they are assigned to and their level of
readiness.

                                                                  [Page 100]

There are large numbers of helicopters considered "obsolete" for front line
troops that have been widely spread through the Army's aviation reserve
units. As demonstrated during Operations Desert Shield, Storm & Sabre, these
units may quickly find themselves on or near the front line of any conflict
of arms.

The number and type of helicopters assigned to a mission group during
operations will also vary widely, depending on the theater of operations, the
mission objective, and other forces deployed in the area. For example, a
formation of Apaches may be supported by Special Forces units on the ground
(with laser designators for their Hellfire missiles), or they may need a Kiowa
scout configured for laser designation to accompany them if there are no
forward forces to support them. The terrain, battlefield conditions, and
weather may all be factors in deciding the number and type of aircraft to
assign to any specific mission.

                                                                  [Page 101]

FLYING THE HELICOPTER

Flying a helicopter is a lesson in the physics of vectors. It places a great
demand on the ability of the pilot to simultaneously control each of the
factors affecting the flight of his aircraft. The following material only
begins to scratch the surface of the intricacies of rotary-wing flight.


The Basic Forces

The four basic forces, or vectors, that act on all aircraft are gravity
(which pulls the craft down), lift (which pushes it up), thrust (which moves
the craft horizontally), and drag (resistance against thrust). These four 
forces, and to what degree they act on an aircraft determine if and how well
if flies. Changing vectors that act on an aircraft and, consequently, change
its flight characteristics.


Lift, Thrust and the Helicopter

Helicopters and airplanes both get their lift from an airfoil - a shape that
creates lift from relative motion through the air. An airfoil is shaped so
that air moving across the top of it must travel farther than air crossing
along its bottom; this creates a condition known as the Venturi Effect, in
which an area of low air pressure is created above the airfoil. As a result,
the airfoil is drwan upward into the low pressure area, creating a lifting
force.

Conventional airplanes depend on the relative motion of air across their
fixed wings, caused by forward motion, to create the lift necessary for them
to get and ramain airborne. As a result, lift for an airplane follows the
thrust of its engines; the more thrust available, the more lift an airplane
can get out of its wings, or the less wing surface it needs to generate
that lift.

Helicopters, on the other hand, get all of their lift and thrust from one
source - the rotor blades; these are the helicopter's "wings". Since the
helicopter spins its lifting surfaces through the air, it creates the relative
motion necessary to generate lift without having to move the whole helicopter
through the air. This is why helicopters can hover and maneuver at low speeds.

Unlike the wing of an airplane, the blades of a helicopter's rotor are
symmetrical - the top and bottom of each blade is shaped the same. Thus, if
they were allowed to spin perfectly flat, they would provide no lift at all.
The difference in surface area needed to create lift is achieved by changing

                                                                  [Page 102]

the pitch, or angle of the blades. By increasing the tilt of the rotor blades,
a helicopter can essentially take a bigger "bite" out of the air and create
more lift.

The helicopter's directional thrust - the force that moves it horizontally -
is created by tilting the plane of the rotor blades' spin. When the rotor is
tilted, it pulls the helicopter in the direction of the tilt, as well as
providing lift.

There are four basic configurations for helicopter rotors. The most common is
what the Britis call "penny and farthing" - the single overhead rotor with a
smaller stabilizing tail rotor. The smaller rotor counteracts the torque
generated by the main rotor. Another common rotor configuration is the twin
tandem - two rotor, one forward and one aft. The rotors revolve in opposite
directions to counter act each other's torque.

The twin side-by-side is not very common among military helicopters. In this
configurations, the rotors are mounted on the side of the helicopter, and 
often intermesh. Several commercial helicopters manufactured by Kaman used
this design. The coaxial rotor configuration is most commonly used by
Soviet helicopter designers, and can be seen in the Hormone, Helix and the new
Hokum helicopters. Two counter-rotating sets of rotor blades revolve about the
same axis, counteracting each other's torque.


Dissymetry and Asymmetry of Lift

Since a helicopter's rotor blades spin about an axis, the relative speed of 
air over the rotor blades is slower toward the inside of the blade and faster
toward the tip of the blade. This means that a greater amount of lift will be
created at the tips of the blades, so the blades will tend to bend up at the
ends. This phenomena is known as dissymetry of lift.

Also, if the helicopter is moving forward, one side of the rotor (the side
spinning toward the direction of movement) will have a higher relative air

                                                                  [Page 103]

speed than the other (spinning away from the direction of movement). This
effect is called asymmetry of lift. The effect, first noted by Juan de la
Cierva during his development of the autogiro in the 1920's, tends to make
rotary-winged aircraft roll to one side unless it is compensated for. In most
cases, helicopter designers have adjusted to this effect by hinging the
blades, allowing them to rise slightly while they spin forward.


Torque

Since the helicopter's rotor blades are spinning, another force is exerted on
the helicopter - torque. When a helicopter has only one rotor, the torque
generated by that rotor tends to turn the helicopter in a direction opposite
of the spin of the rotor blades. This is counteracted in most helicopters by
a tail rotor, which pushes back against the torque. In helicopters with two
rotor blades, the rotors spin in opposite directions and the torque is
cancelled out.

Torque can also be used to the helicopter's advantage. Torque, in conjunction
with the tail rotor, can be used to help turn the helicopter in flight, and
pivot the helicopter about its axis when it's hovering.

                                                                  [Page 104]

Blade Stall and Air Compressibility

There are two properties of helicopter flight which significantly limit the
top speed of all helicopters. The first of these is called blade stall. As a
helicopter accelerates its forward flight, its rotor tilts forward, adding
thrust. As it does so, the angle of attack, or the angle of the blades in 
releation to the direction of flight of the "retreating" blades becomes
steeper. When the helicopter exceeds its maximum speed, this angle becomes
too great, and the retreating blades stall - they cease to provide lift - just
as an airplane stalls when flying at too low a speed.

The second speed-limiting factor affecting helicopters is the compressibility
of air. The faster the rotor spins, the greater the airspeed of the advancing
blades; when the relative speed of the advancing rotor blades exceeds the
speed of sound, a wave of compressed air, known as a shock wave, forms in 
front of the blades, increasing the drag on the blades and possibly decreasing
lift.

                                                                  [Page 105]

The Controls

A helicopter requires both hands (and both feet) on the controls at all times.
Helicopters are controlled in flight by three pilot "inputs": the cyclic and
collective sticks (which occupy the hands), and the rudder pedals (which are
controlled by the feet of the pilot).

The cyclic controls the "attitude" of the helicopter - its direction and
degree of tilt. This affects the horizontal direction and speed of flight, by
adjusting the direction of thrusts from the rotor. Direction of flight as
controlled by the cyclic is independent of heading (the direction the 
helicopter is pointing); this enables a helicopter to fly forward, backward or
sideways.

The collective controls the lifting and thrusting force of the rotor blades by
altering their pitch - taking a bigger or smaller bite out of the air. While
the helicopter is in a hover, the collective controls the vertical thrust 
(lift) of the helicopter. The collective is often combined with, and always
used in conjunction with the engine throttle, to adjust the engine's power to
the demand of the collective.

The rudder pedals control the heading of the helicopter - the direction it 
points in. Using the pedals, a pilot can turn a helicopter about the axis of
its rotor blades while in a hover. Using the foot pedals in combination with
the cyclic control when the helicopter is in forward flight enables it to make
a very tight turn.


Hovering

To hover a helicopter, the cyclic must be held at center, so that the
helicopter does not gain airspeed in any direction. The collective controls
keep the helicopter at a constant altitude, while the rudder pedals keep
the helicopter pointed in one direction. Since the air is a dynamic 
environment, the pilot must constantly adjust these controls to maintain the
hover.

When a helicopter is in a hover or in slow forward flight close to the ground,
it creates an effect known as ground cushion. Air forced down by the rotors
cannot escape quickly and is compressed between the helicopter and the
ground. This, in turn, increases the efficiency of the helicopter's engine
and rotor blades.

                                                                  [Page 106]

Accelerating Forward

To accelerate a helicopter forward from a hover, the pilot pushes the cyclic
forward and pulls up on the collective. More lift is generated by the rotors
as the collective is pulled up, and this lift is converted to forward
thrust as the rotor (and the helicopter) is tilted forward by the collective.

As the helicopter shifts from a hover to forward flight, the helicopter 
settles toward the ground. This is because of a slight loss of lift as some of
the helicopter's lift is converted to thrust, and as it "slips off" the ground
cushion. But when the helicopter has gained some forward momentum, it also
gains what is called "translational lift" - the additional lift generated by
the relative motion created in horizontal flight. As the helicopter 
accelerates forward, the translational lift grows. However, this additional
lifiting efficiency is cancelled out by other effects once the helicopter
reaches about 90 kts forward speed.


Level Flight

When the helicopter is in straight, level flight, the cyclic controls airspeed
for the most part, while the collective maintains altitude. When climbing or
descending, the cyclic maintains the airspeed of the helicopter while the
collective increases or decreases lift as required. Since an increase or
decrease in collective often corresponds with an increase or decrease in
throttle, the torque of the helicopter may increase or decrease during 
altitude changes. This means the rudder pedals need to be adjusted constantly
to match the torque on the helicopter.


Takeoff and Landing

Helicopter takeoff usually consists of two maneuvers - going into a hover, and
forward, climbing flight. First, the pilot lifts off the ground vertically
using increased throttle and collective, maintaining horizontal position as in
a hover but adding more collective to pull the aircraft upward. Then, the
pilot pushes the cyclic forward and pulls up on the collective to attain 
airspeed and climb to altitude.

Whenever possible, helicopter takeoff should be done into the wind, to
prevent drift during takeoff. The pilot should also pick some reference point
on the ground to keep his heading steady on during initial acceleration.

Landing is essentially a reverse process - descending forward flight to a 
point above the landing point, and a gradually descending hover to the ground.
All descent should be stopped when the helicopter goes into the hover.

The helicopter should not be allowed to drift horizontally while touching

                                                                  [Page 107]

down, as it could easily tip over. This could lead to the pilot and crew
eating pieces of shattered rotor blade. Also, it is important that the 
collective be handled gently during landing, as too rapid a descent can prove
dangerous. At best, a very expensive aircraft is bounced off the ground, and
several vertebrae are compressed.


"Stepping on the Brakes"

There may be occasion where it becomes necessary to rapidly slow down 
horizontal flight - a large, impassable obstacle ahead, or some other
condition that might have a negative impact on the service life of the
helicopter. In such a situation, care should be taken by the pilot to maintain
altitude and avoid wild changes in heading. Coordinated, simultaneous use of
the controls is essential.

To "put on the brakes", the pilot lets down on the collective and pulls back
on the cyclic at the same time, while adjusting the rudder to prevent a wild
swing in heading. As the helicopter slows to the desired speed, the pilot
levels the craft by pushing forward on the cyclic (to prevent the helicopter
from settling tail-first and hiting the ground) and adjusting the collective
(to maintain altitude).

                                                                  [Page 108]

HELICOPTER TACTICS

One of the great handicaps of helicopter combat is that there is nowhere to
hide in the sky. Anti-aircraft artillery (AAA), surface-to-air missiles,
helicopters, and ground fire from small automatic weapons can swat a 
helicopter from the sky. With the wide proliferation of man-portable, high-
tech weapons like the Stinger, SA-7 Grail, and SA-14 Gremlin missiles, the
open skies are an even more dangerous place for slow-flying helicopters than
before. To survive, the pilot must be able to use the unique flight
characteristics of the helicopter to his advantage.

One of the most commonly used defensive maneuvers for helicopters is nap-of-
the-earth (NOE) flying. In this type of flying, the helicopter follows the
contour of the earth, in almost all respects becoming a ground vehicle. This
type of flight demands a great deal of skill. But if the pilot doesn't hit a
tree or hill, he gains a great deal more security on the battlefield from SAMs
and AAA. Exposure to fire from enemy units is minimized because the helicopter
is masked by the terrain for a majority of its flight, and the helicopter
gains a degree of surprise.


Helicopter VS. Tanks and Ground Units

The maneuverability of helicopters gives them the best of both worlds when it
comes to combat with ground forces; they can use the terrain to their
advantage, and then fly above it when it becomes an impediment. This ability
gives the helicopter gunship the ability to ambush enemy ground forces 
whenever the terrain permits.

Ambush tactics for gunships date back to the Vietnam War, when Huey Cobras
patrolled the Ho Chi Minh trail. The most common ambush maneuver is the
"pop-up" - the helicopter masks itself behind a tree line, house, or other

                                                                  [Page 109]

terrain feature, and then "pops up" from behind its hiding place to deliver
the attack. The usual minimum number of helicopters for an ambush attack is
three, bu NATO doctrine.

A "pop-up" is only necessary to use direct-fire weapons - weapons that require
the target to be in a line of sight. With the Apache's Hellfire laser-guided
anti-tank missiles, the Apache does not even need to pop up. Another
helicopter or a forward observer can designate the target with a laser, and
the Apache can fire from cover.

Another weapon that offers virtually no exposure time to enemy fire is the
sub-munition-type anti-armor system attack. This attack relies on a pattern of
multi-purpose bomblets from exploding unguided rockets. The helicopter
makes its approach shielded by the terrain, then pulls up and fires, and turns
toward the rear, immediately returning to NOE flight to avoid enemy fire.


Helicopter VS. Helicopter

The first all-helicopter dogfight on record occured during the Iran-Iraq war,
when an Iraqi Hind shot down an Iranian Cobra. Even before this event, it
was widely assumed that in any large-scale conflict of the future, helicopters
would meet other helicopters in air combat. The Soviets have even designed a
helicopter for the single purpose of air-to-air combat operations (the Hokum).

Helicopter-to-helicopter combat tactics are an evolution of the combat tactics
used first by fighter pilots in World War One. The unique maneuvering 
abilities of the helicopter add some considerations to the equation, but the
old problems are essentially the same - how to convert velocity and altitude 
into a shooting position.

                                                                  [Page 110]

If approached from behind, the first instinct of many helicopter pilots is to
brake hard to force the enemy to overshoot. To recover from an overshoot,
helicopter pilots have developed a maneuver known as the "High Yo-Yo." When 
the target brakes, the attacker pulls up hard to avoid an overshoot, 
converting airspeed into altitude, and then maneuvers to the "six-o'clock"
position (directly behind the target) and drops down for the attack.

Rather than braking hard, a pilot finding himself in front of an oncoming
attacker might execute a maneuver known as the "Horizontal Scissors." In this
maneuver, the pilot turns hard to one side and reduces forward velocity. The
attacker is forced to turn to follow, and the pilot then turns hard in the
opposite direction. The attacker is forced to reverse his turn and is forced 
out in front of the defender, who is now in a position to take a shot.

When faced with an attacker in close proximity, a helicopter pilot can use a
manevuer developed by the U.S. Marines known as the "Side Flare Quick Stop."
The pilot pulls up hard and flares to one side, forcing the attacker to
overshoot. Now behind the opponent, the pilot dives down into the six-o'clock
position and has the enemy in his sights.

When meeting an adversary from an opposite direction, a pilot can use a
maneuver known as a "Stern Conversion." The pilot accelerates and performs a
hard, banking turn called a "wing-over" (similar to the maneuver used in 
World War Two movies by pilots turning out of formation for an attack run).
The pilot then performs a turning dive into attack position behind the enemy
aircraft.

                                                                  [Page 111]

As of yet, these tactics are fairly theoretical - none have been truly proven
in combat. But it is clear that pilots will use some derivative of the them
in any future conflict where helicopters meet over the battlefield.

                                                                  [Page 112]

                          4. EQUIPMENT AND ORGANISATION


DATA FORMAT


All are expressed in metric measurements. Metric measurements are used because
most armies, including the U.S. Army, utilize the metric system.


Length, Width, Height, Weight and Diameter

Vehicles list fully loaded combat weights. Aircraft list maximum take-off
weights.


Crew/Pass

The "crew" is the normal fighting complement of the vehicle or aircraft - the
men who remain aboard in combat situations.

While most all vehicles can carry passengers in some form or another, only
those that are specifically built for transport, or provide a modicum of cover
list passengers. The "passengers" frequently dismount in combat.


Engine

The horsepower (hp) and type of the main (engine(s). Helicopter engines are
rated in "shaft horsepower" (shp). Fixed-wing aircraft engines are rated in
"pounds of static thrust" (lb st). "AB" indicates afterburner capability.


Max Speed

For vehicles, this is maximum rated road speed in kilometers per hour (kph).
For aircraft and ships, this is the maximum level speed in knots (kts) at sea
level.


Rate of Climb

For helicopters, this is the vertical rate of climb from hover in feet per
second (ft/sec). In most case, the maximum rate of climb is about twice this
value.


Service Ceiling

The maximum attainable altitude with a nominal weapon load. The Rules of
Engagement (ROE) for a Theater of Operations (TO) normally limit the
maximum altitude to a much lower value.


Main Gun

The size and type of the main gun, if any. All guns are rifled unless "SB"
(smoothbore) is indicated. For guns other than machine-guns (MG), the
number of rounds carried (rds) is also indicated.


Missiles

The name and type of missile carried. Aircraft and ships will also list the
predominate non-missile weapons. Please note that other weapon systems could
also be carried.


Weapon Load

For aircraft, this is the maximum weapon load. More often than not, aircraft
fly with less than their rated maximum load.

                                                                  [Page 116]

Sec Guns

Many vehicles mount one or more secondary weapons, usually machine-guns, for
local ground and air defense.


Armor

Vehicle armor thickness is expressed as Heavy, Medium, Light or None.


What's in a Name

You may wonder where the Soviets came up with all those weird names? Well,
the names listed for most of the Soviet equipment are in reality NATO
designations, not the real Soviet names. These NATO designations utilize the
first letter of the unit's type to formulate the name. That's why Soviet 
fighter aircraft have names beginning with an "F", helicopters with an "H",
air-to-air missiles with an "A", and so on.

The reason is twofold. First of all, the Russian language is not that easy to
read or pronounce; secondly, the actual names are sometimes not known until
years after the unit has been spotted or released - afterall, you have to call
it something.

                                                                  [Page 117]

YOUR HELICOPTERS AND WEAPON SYSTEMS

AH-64A Apache Gunship

In the mid-1960s, after the AH-56 Cheyenne program failed to meet required
developmental specifications (too expensive and too complex), the US Army was
left without an advanced attack helicopter. At that time, the AH-1 Cobra was
considered to be only a near-term step. The search continued, and the contract
for the Apache was finally awared in 1976; the first Apache entered service in
1986. The Apache is now considered to be the premier helicopter gunship.

Avionics: Includes a full suite of advanced communication systems, 
navigational flight aids and survivability systems. The target aquisition/
designation sight and pilot's night vision sensor (TADS/PNVS) are the heart
of the avionics package. These linked systems include an auto-focus thermal
imager, laser ranger/designator and TV camera. Both are integrated into a
helmet-mounted sighting system. IR signature is reduced by the Black Hole
System. An airborne target handoff subsystem (ATHS) data link is also included

AH-64B Longbow Apache Gunship

A natural follow-on to the AH-64A, the Longbow Apache will feature a number of
mid-life product improvements, but will be built around the new millimeter-
wave radar guided Hellfire weapon system. This system includes an integrated
mast-mounted sight. The MMW Hellfire is a true fire-and-forget weapon. Its
seeker head will guide itself to the target; a target designator is not 
required. It's also longer ranged, and suffer less degradation from rain, fog
and smoke than FLIR's & thermal imagers. These upgrades will make the Longbow
Apache and the Comanche unbeatable stable mates.

Avionics: Will be an upgrade to the current Apache systems, but changes will
mainly involve the target type discriminating MMW systems and related
subsystems.

AH-1W SuperCobra Gunship

The first AH-1 Cobra was built from the UH-1 Huey airframe, and saw combat in
Vietnam. The Cobra has gone through many modifications and model changes. The
"W" model is the SuperCobra on or about the "S" model). While it's currently
only fielded by the US Marines, the US Army is soon expected to upgrade to
"W" standards.

Avionics: Includes a full suite of communication systems, navigational flight
aids and survivability systems. The nose mounted night targeting system (NTS)
includes a FLIR, laser ranger/designator and TOW fire controls. This system

                                                                  [Page 119]

is integrated with the helmet-mounted sighting system. An airborne target
handoff subsystem (ATHS) data link is also included.

AH-66A Comanche Gunship/Scout Helicopter

In 1982 the US Army invited manufacturers to submin design concepts for its
Light Helicopter experimental (LHX) program. The original procurement called
for 5,000 units to replace UH-1, AH-1, OH-58 and OH-6 airframes; this was
later revised to 2,096 units (the UH-1 Huey follow-on was eliminated). The
LHX, now designated the AH-66A Comanche, will feature many advances in
helicopter technology, including all-composite airframe construction, advanced
bearingless rotor system, internal weapons bay and retractable landing gear.
Stealth technologies will be employed where feasible. Its tandem cockpit
seats the pilot in the front seat, as in jet aircraft.

Avionics: Includes the most advanced systems to date. All will be fly-by-wire
technology. All systems are integrated into the wide field-of-view helmet
sighting/targeting system. MFD's will dominate the console, and the 
architecture will be of the same generation as US Air Force's Advanced
Tactical Fighter (ATF).

OH-58D Kiowa Warrior Scout Helicopter

The first OH-58's saw service in the Vietnam War. It had been selected as the
replacement for the OH-6 Cayuse. It also has seen great commercial success as
the JetRanger. The Kiowa Warrior is considered to be only the near-term scout
helicopter. It's scheduled to be replaced in the mid-1990s by the AH-66A
Comanche, The US Army plans to field a total of 477 OH-58D's, by upgrading
OH-58A models to OH-58D standards.

Avionics: Mast-mounted sight includes auto-focusing thermal imager, laser
ranger/designator and TV camera. The airborne target handoff subsystem (ATHS)
enables remote targeting for the Hellfire missile.

UH-60K/L Blackhawk Assault Helicopter

As a replacement for the UH-1 Iroquois Transport Helicopter (the famous Huey),
the Blackhawk entered service in 1979. Designed primarily to transport 11 
fully equipped troops, its spacious cabin enables it to also be used, without
modification, for medevac, supply and command functions. The external stores
support system (ESSS) can carry a significant number of weapons. The "K" &
"L" models entered service in 1988.

Avionics: Includes a full suite of communication systems, navigational flight
aids, including advanced AFCS subsystem, and survivability systems. UHF 
satellite communication is also available. IR signature is reduced by the
hover infrared suppressor (HIRSS) system.

AH-6G Defender Light Gunship/Scout Helicopter

The original Defender dates back to the Vietnam War, where it saw action as
the OH-6A Cayuse LOH (Light Observation Helicopter - "Loach"). The AH-6G is
based on the commercial MD530 helicopter. A compact integrated crew station
with multiple MFD's enhances this helicopter's field of view. It's designed
primarily for day or night point attack and antiarmor missions, but is 
equally suitable for scout missions.

Avionics: Includes a full suite of communication systems, navigational flight
aids and survivability systems. Mast-mounted sight includes FLIR, laser
ranger and TOW fire controls.

M230 30mm Chaingun

Primary armament on the Apaches. The chaingun is a single barrelled, 
externally powered weapon that's drivin by a simple chain mechanism. The
chain literally pulls the rounds of ammunition through the gun, therefore
greatly reducing the chance of a jam. The chaingun configuration is lighter
than gating guns.

Weight:               55.9 kg

Rate-of-Fire:         625 rpm

Aiming Mechanism:     Helmet Mounted Sight or Gunner's Sight

Primary Target:       Medium armored or unprotected targets

                                                                  [Page 123]

M197 20mm Gatling Gun

Primary armament on the SuperCobra. The M197 is a lightweight, externally
powered 3-barrelled variation of the M61A1 20mm Vulcan 6-barrelled fighter
aircraft weapon. It uses the gatling gun principle of rotating barells
around a common axis. This makes for a high rate-of-fire and limits jamming.

Weight:               66 kg

Rate-of-Fire:         3,000 rpm

Aiming Mechanism:     Helmet Mounted Sight or Gunner's Sight

Primary Target:       Lightly armored or unprotected targets


SUU-11B/A Minigun Pod

The minigun is a 7.62mm development of the M61A1 20mm Vulcan 6-barrelled 
gatling gun. It's available as a wing mounted pod weapon on the Blackhawk,
SuperCobra, Kiowa Warrior or Defender, and it's also the fixed gun weapon on
the Defender. It provides excellent area suppressive fire for a small cost
in weight.

Weight:               147 kg, with 1,500 rds

Rate-of-Fire:         2,000/4,000 rpm

Aiming Mechanism:     Direct fire along axis of flight

Primary Target:       Unprotected targets

                                                                  [Page 124]

GPU-2/A Gun Pod

The GPU-2/A is basically a M197 20mm 3-barrelled gatling gun in pod form. It's
totally self-contained unit with gun and ammunition. It even has its own
rechargeable power source. All the pilot needs to do is aim and fire. It's
available as a wing mounted pod weapon on the Blackhawk, SuperCobra, Kiowa
Warrior or Defender.

Weight:               270 kg, with 300 rds

Rate-of-Fire:         1,500 rpm

Aiming Mechanism:     Direct fire along axis of flight

Primary Target:       Lightly armored or unprotected targets


Viper 20mm Gatling Gun

Primary armament on the Comanche. The Viper is a lightweight 2-barrelled 
cannon. It uses an all new configuration, but is still based on the gatling
gun principle of rotating barrels around a common axis. It's speculated that
it fires a more effective round of ammunition than the standard M197 20mm
cannon round.

Weight:               50 kg

Rate-of-Fire:         2,000 rpm

Aiming Mechanism:     Helmet Mounted Sight

Primary Target:       Lightly armored or unprotected targets


AIM-92 Stinger AAM

The air launched version of the Stinger has been in operation since 1988.
Based on the excellent man-portable system, this version combines a new dual
color IR & UV seeker head and a reprogrammable microprocessor (RPM). The
missiles are mounted in a twin missile pod system. The Stinger is a very
effective lightweight missile.

                                                                  [Page 125]

Weight:               47 kg, twin launcher

Maximum Firing Range: under 10 km

Guidance System:      IR homing

Primary Target:       short range, low-flying targets


AIM-9R Sidewinder AAM

The Sidewinder missile dates back to the late 1940s, when it was first
developed by the US Navy. The current model bears little resemblance to the
original other than in outward appearence. It has gone through innumerable
changes in its lifetime. The "R" model has an all-aspect seeker head and
improved low-smoke rocket engine.

Weight:               87 kg

Maximum Firing Range: 18 km

Guidance System:      IR homing

Primary Target:       All airborne targets


AGM-122 Sidearm AGM

The Sidearm system evolved out of the need to develop a low cost, lightweight
anti-radar missile. Unused Sidewinder AIM-9C's were refurbished and brought up
to AIM-9L/M standards, and a broadband passive radar seeker replaced the
existing seeker. It will be carried by AV-8B Harriers, F-4G Phantom Wild
Weasels, and helicopters.

Weight:               91 kg

Maximum Firing Range: 15 km

Guidance System:      Passive radar homing

Primary Target:       SAM & gun control radars

                                                                  [Page 126]

AGM-65D Maverick AGM

The Maverick "D" model entered service in 1983, and was a naturaly follow-on
to this very successful weapon. It has replaced the earlier "TV" guidance
system with an imaging infrared system. The IR system has a much greater
range and has ability to "see" through smoke and dust. Maverick is a true
fire-and-forget weapon system.

Weight:               220 kg

Maximum Firing Range: 25 km

Guidance System:      IR homing

Primary Target:       Heavily armored targets & fortifications


AGM-114A/B Hellfire AGM

Hellfire is the US Army's latest anti-armor weapon system. The "A" model's
laser seeker requires the target to be illuminated by a laser source; however,
it need not be the launching helicopter. The "B" model's millimeter wave radar
seeker is a true fire-and-forget weapon system. It will be carried by the
Longbow Apache.

Weight:               43 kg

Maximum Firing Range: 6 km (A), 8 km (B)

Guidance System:      semi-active laser (A), MMW Radar (B)

Primary Target:       Heavily armored tarets & fortifications


BGM-71D TOW-2 AGM

The TOW system has been utilized as an airborne ATGM since the Vietnam war.
It (SACLOS) uses semi-automatic command to line-of-sight guidance. All the
operator need to do is keep the cross-hair centered on the target. Commands
are transmitted to the TOW via a thin wire. The TOW-2 model has a larger,
improved warhead.

Weight:               22 kg

Maximum Firing Range: 4 km

Guidance System:      Command to Line-of-Sight via Wire

Primary Target:       Heavily armored targets & fortifications

                                                                  [Page 127]

Helstreak HVM AGM/AAM

The Helstreak High Velocity Missile (HVM) system is based on the British
Starstreak SAM. It's laser guided warhead contains three accurate darts that
independently home in on the target. This makes for a wide coverage pattern,
which is important in the air-to-air role. With HUMs, exposure time is
reduced.

Weight:               40 kg

Maximum Firing Range: 7 km

Guidance System:      semi-active laser homing

Primary Target:       Medium armored ground & air targets


Penguin-3 Anti-Ship Misisle

The Norweigian developed Penguin-3 anti-ship missile's modest weight (as far
as anti-ship missiles go) makes it ideally suited for helicopters. The missile
is aimed at a point on the surface, and it flies there under its own inertial
guidance. Then, it switches on its IR homer, seeking out the heat of a ship
against the cool ocean background.

Weight:               380 kg

Maximum Firing Range: 40 km

Guidance System:      IR homing

Primary Target:       Medium & Light ships

                                                                  [Page 128]

Hydra 70 Rocket System

The Hydra 70 rocket System (the 70 = 70mm, or 2.75 in) is a series of rockets
each with a special purpose warhead. The M261 has a sub-munition multipurpose
warhead. The M247 has a shaped-charge warhead for use against armored targets.
The M255 has a flechette warhead for use against unarmored targets or 
Helicopters.

Weight:               9 kg

Maximum Firing Range: 2-3 km

Guidance System:      Unguided

Primary Target:       Varies by Warhead Type

                                                                  [Page 129]

THE GROUND AND AIR UNITS


U.S AND ALLIED UNITS

The friendlies and not so friendlies. These are the predominate vehicles,
aircraft and ships you'll cross paths with throughout your missions. While
you'll certainly come across many other units (e.g. trains, trucks, buildings,
bridges, oil tanks and airfields), they're just too numerous to mention.


M1A1 "Abrams" Main Battle Tank

Unquestionably the finest tank in the field today, the M1A1 entered service in
1985. It mounts the hard-hitting German Rheinmetall 120mm smoothbore cannon
(same as the German Leopard-2) backed by a sophisticated fire control system.
Later versions have depleted uranium (DU) armor added to the turret and hull
fronts.

Weight:        57.2 tons            Main Gun:    120mm SB, 40 rds       

Crew/Pass:     4/0                  Missiles:    None

Speed:         64 kph               Armor:       Heavy


M60A3 Main Batle Tank

The M60A3 lineage dates from the venerable M47s and M48s. An earlier model,
the M60A1, saw great success in the hands of the Israelis. It's slow and tall
by today's standards (not a good combination), but still possesses reasonably
good armor and firepower. It's also fielded by Saudi Arabia and Egypt.

Weight:        52.6 tons            Main Gun:    105mm, 63 rds       

Crew/Pass:     4/2                  Missiles:    None

Speed:         48 kph               Armor:       Heavy

                                                                  [Page 130]

Challenger Main Battle Tank

The British began design work on a replacement for the Chieftain in the late
1960s. The final concept took a round-about route, as the Challenger is 
essentially the Iranian Shir-2. It was designed by the British, for, at that
time, the Shah led Iran, but the Ayatollah had a different opinion about
buying tanks from the British.

Weight:        62 tons              Main Gun:    120mm, 64 rds       

Crew/Pass:     4/0                  Missiles:    None

Engine:        1,200 hp diesel      Sec Gun:     two MG's

Speed:         56 kph               Armor:       Heavy


AMX-30 Main Battle Tank

A French design, the AMX-30 entered production in 1966. Emphasizing the
predominate European theories of the time, its design embraces speed and
firepower, as armor was considered a secondary factor. The AMX-30 is also
fielded by a number of middle eastern nations including Saudi Arabia and
Qatar.

Weight:        36 tons              Main Gun:    105mm, 47 rds       

Crew/Pass:     4/0                  Missiles:    None

Engine:        720 hp multi-fuel    Sec Gun:     one cannon, one MG

Speed:         65 kph               Armor:       Medium


M2A1 "Bradley" Infantry Fighting Vehicle

The first Bradleys entered active service in 1983 after a protracted 
developmental period; the need was first identified in 1963. Its 25mm 
"Bushmaster" chaingun (a relative of the 30mm chaingun mounted on the AH-64
Apache) fires highly effective depleted uranium shells; TOW ATGM's provide
the long-range hitting power.

                                                                  [Page 131]

Crew/Pass:     3/7                  Missiles:    TOW-2,7 rds

Engine:        500 hp diesel        Sec Gun:     one MG

Speed:         66 kph               Armor:       Light


Warrior Mechanized Combat Vehicle

In the 1970 the Brit's embarked on a program to develop a mechanized combat
vehicle. Somewhat austere by US standards, the Warrior lacks long-range
missile capability, and has relatively simple fire control systems. But, it's
relatively inexpensive, and quite sound mechanically. The Warrior entered
service in 1987.

Weight:        24.5 tons            Main Gun:    30mm, 228 rds       

Crew/Pass:     3/7                  Missiles:    None

Engine:        550 hp diesel        Sec Gun:     one MG

Speed:         72 kph               Armor:       Light


M113A3 Armored Personnel Carrier

The profilic M113 series was originally designed in 1956, and entered service
in 1960. The A3 version entered production in 1987. The M113 is a "battle-
taxi", designed to only transport the infantry into the general vicinity of 
the battle. Over 75,000 have been produced. It's used by many middle eastern
nations.

Weight:        12.1 tons            Main Gun:    12,7mm MG       

Crew/Pass:     2/10                 Missiles:    None

Engine:        275 hp diesel        Sec Gun:     None

Speed:         64 kph               Armor:       Light

                                                                  [Page 132]

Scorpion Reconnaissance Vehicle

Born out of a British study conducted in the 1950s, the Scorpion entered 
British service in 1972. Its excellent cross-county performance and high
speed make for the ideal recon vehicle. The scorpion's basic design has
spawned 7 follow-on vehicles. It's also fielded by Saudi Arabia, UAE and Oman.

Weight:        8.1 tons             Main Gun:    76mm, 40 rds       

Crew/Pass:     3/0                  Missiles:    None

Engine:        190 hp petrol        Sec Gun:     one MG

Speed:         81 kph               Armor:       Light


Scimitar Reconnaissance Vehicle

A descendant of the Scorpion, the Scimitar followed it into service one year
later. The two vehicles differ primarily only in their armament. The Scimitar
is intended to provide area suppressive fire, while still having the
penetrative power to engage opposing recon and light vehicles.

Weight:        7.8 tons             Main Gun:    30mm, 165 rds       

Crew/Pass:     3/0                  Missiles:    None

Speed:         81 kph               Armor:       Light


M901A2 ITV Anti-Tank Vehicle

The ITV (Improved TOW Vehicle) entered service in 1979 as a replacement for
the M150 open-topped TOW vehicle. It's a M113A2 fitted with the Emerson M27
TOW cupola. The M27 mounts a twin launcher, TOW guidance systems and a thermal
imager. The TOW's can be fired and reloaded from "under armor".

Weight:        13.0 tons            Main Gun:    None       

Crew/Pass:     4/0                  Missiles:    TOW-2, 12 rds

Engine:        215 hp diesel        Sec Gun:     one MG

Speed:         55 kph               Armor:       Light

                                                                  [Page 133]

M163A2 PIVADS Self-Propelled Anti-Aircraft Gun

The M163 entered service in 1968; the PIVADS (Product Improved Vulcan Air
Defense System) came on to the scene in 1984. The system is an M113A1 chassis
with a one-man electrically-driven turret. The 20mm gatling gun is the same
as used by Air Force Fighters. Even with its high rate of fire, it's very
limited.

Weight:        12.3 tons            Main Gun:    20mm, 2100 rds       

Crew/Pass:     4/0                  Missiles:    None

Engine:        215 hp diesel        Sec Gun:     None

Speed:         68 kph               Armor:       Light


M998 "Hummer" Utility Vehicle

The multi-purpose "Hummer" entered service as a replacement for the famous and
ubiquitous Jeep (M151). The Hummer fulfills many rolse, serving as an APC,
Scout, TWO platform and fire support vehilce. To date, over 100,000 have
been ordered for various branches of the US Armed Forces.

Weight:        2.3 tons             Main Gun:    12.7mm MG       

Crew/Pass:     2/4                  Missiles:    None

M109A3 Self-Propelled Artillery Vehicle

The M109 concept dates back to 1952, when it was born out of a study on
self-propelled artillery. The lessons learned in WW2 and Korea clearly spelled
the ultimate demise of static artillery. The M109 series emerged as the 
standard by which all other "SP's" are judged. It's fielded by most NATO
members and many other nations.

Weight:        24.9 tons            Main Gun:    155mm, 36 rds       

Crew/Pass:     6/0                  Missiles:    None

Engine:        405 hp diesel        Sec Gun:     None

Speed:         56 kph               Armor:       Light


MRLS Rocket Launcher

An international design/production program, the MRLS (Multiple Rocket Launch
System) entered service in 1983. The vehicle is partially based on the M2
Bradley chassis. Its primary rocket is the M77 rocket; each warhead contains
644 dual purpose shaped-change fragmentation bomblets.

Weight:        25.2 tons            Main Gun:    None       

Crew/Pass:     3/0                  Missiles:    12-227mm rockets

LHA Tarawa Class Amphibious Assault Ship

The first ship of this class has been in service since 1976. The LHA's are
intended to combine the capabilities of LPH (helicopter carriers) and LPD
(amphibious docks) into one ship. Four landing craft are carried in its deck.
Its boilers are the largest ever installed on a US ship. It has a complete
300 bed hospital.

Weight:        39,400 tons          Main Gun:    3x127mm       

Crew/Pass:     1014/1924            Missiles:    Sea Sparrow SAM

Max Speed:     24 kts               


FF Knox Class Frigate

The Knox Class is typical of many escort frigates built during the 1970s. The
class packs a large amount of firepower onto a small frame. The Harpoon SSMs
are fired from the forward mounted ASROC launcher. The originally fitted Sea
Sparrow SAM system, are being replaced by the Vulcan/Phalanx 20mm system.

Weight:        4,250 tons           Main Gun:    1x127mm

THE OPPOSING FORCES

T-80A Main Battle Tank

The Soviet T-80A is thought to have entered service in 1983. It has closer
developmental ties to the T-64 then to the T-72. It's considered to be
only an evolutionary design, although, the gas turbineengine is a radical
departure. The AT-8 Songster was added to provide long range capability, as
the 125mm SB's accuracy is poor.

Weight:        42 tons              Main Gun:    125mm SB, 42 rds       

Crew/Pass:     3/0                  Missiles:    Songster, 2 rds

Engine:        980 hp turbine       Sec Gun:     two MG's

Speed:         75 kph               Armor:       Heavy


T-64B Main Battle Tank

The original Soviet T-64's entered service in 1967, and were plagued with
autoloader and engine problems. The "B" model seems to have corrected these
problems since it's still in production. It appears the T-64's were the "high-
tech" option while the T-72's embodied the "bargain-basement" approach. The
T-64 has never been exported.

Weight:        42 tons              Main Gun:    125mm SB, 42 rds       

Crew/Pass:     3/0                  Missiles:    Songster, 2 rds

T-72M1 Main Battle Tank

The Soviet T-72 followed shortly after the T-64, entering service in 1972.
The T-72 series has had a long career, and has been exported to many nations.
Over a dozen sub-models have been identified to many nations. Over a dozen
sub-models have been identified to date. This model features enhanced
turret armor, resulting in the nickname "Dolly Parton". It's also fielded
by Iraq, Syria and Kuwait.

Weight:        41 tons              Main Gun:    125mm SB, 39 rds       

Crew/Pass:     3/0                  Missiles:    None

Engine:        780 hp diesel        Sec Gun:     two MG's

Speed:         80 kph               Armor:       Heavy


T-62E Main Battle Tank

The Soviet T-62 was developed from the earlier T-54/T-55 series, and entered
service in the early 1960s. It was the first tank to mount a smoothbore gun.
Its low ballistic shape was a plus, but otherwise it was mediocre. The "E"
model features add-on "horseshoe" turret armor and a laser sight. It's also
fielded by Egypt, Syria and Iraq.

Weight:        41.1 tons            Main Gun:    115mm SB, 40 rds       

Crew/Pass:     4/0                  Missiles:    None

Engine:        580 hp diesel        Sec Gun:     two MG's

Speed:         50 kph               Armor:       Heavy

                                                                  [Page 138]

T-55M1 Main Battle Tank

This latest version of the Soviet T-55 (the first entered service in the late
1950s) features add-on "horseshoe" turret armor and a laser sight. This is 
your basic "no frills" tank; simplicity is king here. The T-54/T-55's are the
most widely exported of all Soviet MBT's, and is fielded by over 50 nations
including Egypt, Syria and Iraq.

Weight:        37.0 tons            Main Gun:    100mm, 43 rds       

Crew/Pass:     4/0                  Missiles:    None

Engine:        580 hp diesel        Sec Gun:     two MG's

Speed:         50 kph               Armor:       Heavy


Chieftain Main Battle Tank

The British designed Chieftain introduced a number of innovations when it 
appeared in 1963. It was the first tank to mount a 120mm gun, and its highly
sloped armor provided then unheard of protection. Yet still, it's slow and
relatively clumsy. Iraq does field a large force, but aquired them as war
booty from Iran and Kuwait.

Weight:        55 tons              Main Gun:    120mm, 64 rds       

Crew/Pass:     4/0                  Missiles:    None

Engine:        750 hp multi-fuel    Sec Gun:     three MG's

Speed:         48 kph               Armor:       Heavy

                                                                  [Page 139]

BMP-2 Infantry Fighting Vehicle

The BMP-2 is an upgrade ofthe Soviet BMP-2, and probably entered service
around 1980. It saw the poor 73mm gun replaced with a high-velocity 30mm
auto-cannon. The commander was moved from the hull to the turret, improving
labor distribution and vision. The Sagger was replaced with the longer-
ranged Spandrel.

Weight:        14.6 tons            Main Gun:    30mm, 500 rds       

Crew/Pass:     3/7                  Missiles:    Spandrel, 5 rds

Engine:        400 hp diesel        Sec Gun:     one MG

Speed:         65 kph               Armor:       Light


BMP-1 Infantry Fighting Vehicle

The Soviet BMP-1 caused quite a stir when it entered service in 1967. This
revolutionary design was the first to combine cannon, ATGM and a full
infantry squad with under armor fire capability. Its 73mm gun has poor long
range accuracy, and the one-man turret is inefficient. It's also fielded by
Egypt, Syria and Iraq.

Weight:        13.9 tons            Main Gun:    73mm SB, 40 rds       

Crew/Pass:     3/8                  Missiles:    Sagger, 5 rds

Engine:        300 hp diesel        Sec Gun:     one MG

Speed:         70 kph               Armor:       Light


BTR-60/70/80 Armored Personnel Carrier

The first version of this Soviet APC, the BTR-60, entered service in 1960. 
These vehicles are rather mediocre in all respects. The later models did
overcome a number of flaws; at least the BTR-80 (data is for this vehicle) did
replace the volatile petrol engines. The BTR-60 is fielded by most of the
middle eastern nations.

                                                                  [Page 140]

Weight:        10.5 tons            Main Gun:    14.5mm, 500 rds       

Crew/Pass:     2/12                 Missiles:    None

Engine:        260 hp diesel        Sec Gun:     one MG

Speed:         80 kph               Armor:       Light


MT-LB Armored Personnel Carrier

The Soviet MT-LB design closely followed the MT-L arctic tractor. This 
accounts for its excellent cross-country performance. Typical roles for the
MT-LB include artillery prime mover, command post and cargo carrier. Its
chassis is also the bases for a number of other vehicles.

Weight:        9.7  tons            Main Gun:    7.62mm MG       

Crew/Pass:     2/10                 Missiles:    None

Engine:        240 hp diesel        Sec Gun:     None

Speed:         62 kph               Armor:       Light


EE-11 Uruto Armored Personnel Carrier

The Brazilian EE-11 first entered service in 1974. By all measures, it's a
nondescript, basic every day APC. Even its wheeled configuration is much
easier to maintain than a tracked arrangement. Like its cousin, the EE-9,
it has been exported to many nations including Iraq.

Weight:        14 tons              Main Gun:    12.7mm MG       

Crew/Pass:     2/11                 Missiles:    None

Engine:        260 hp diesel        Sec Gun:     None

Speed:         105 kph              Armor:       Light

                                                                  [Page 141]

BRDM-2 Reconnaissance Vehicle

The Soviet BRDM-2 replaced its predecessor, the BRDM-1, in the mid-1960s. Its
also used as a command or an observer vehicle. It has become outclassed by 
more modern vehicles, and its 14.5mm gun is outdated and inadequate. It's also
fielded by most of the middle eastern nations.

Weight:        7.0 tons             Main Gun:    14.5mm, 500 rds       

Crew/Pass:     2/3                  Missiles:    None

Engine:        140 hp petrol        Sec Gun:     one MG

Speed:         100 kph              Armor:       Light


AML-90 Reconnaissance Vehicle

The French ordered the construction of this light recon vehicle after their
sucessful use of the British Ferret scout car in North Africa; the AML-90
entered service in 1961. Over 5,000 AML's have been built to date in many
configurations. It's fielded by Suadi Arabia, UAE and Iraq.

Weight:        5.5 tons             Main Gun:    90mm, 20 rds       

Crew/Pass:     3/0                  Missiles:    None

Engine:        90 hp petrol         Sec Gun:     one MG

Speed:         90 kph               Armor:       Light


EE-9 Cascavel Reconnaissance Vehicle

Of Brazilian design, the EE-9 entered service in 1974. It shares many
automotive components with the EE-11 APC. It now mounts a 90mm gun of 
Brazilian design; earlier models had 37mm gunsfrom WW2 vintage US M3 Stuart
tanks. It's very simple yet robust, and this has made it a popular export.
It's fielded by Iraq.

                                                                  [Page 142]

Weight:        13.4 tons            Main Gun:    90mm, 44 rds       

Crew/Pass:     3/0                  Missiles:    None

Engine:        212 hp diesel        Sec Gun:     two MG's

Speed:         100 kph              Armor:       Light


BRDM-3 Anti-Tank Vehicle

The Soviet BRDM/Spandrel (often called the BRDM-3) was first seen in 1977. It
has replaced the less capable BRDM - Sagger combination in front line service.
This missiles are fired from a roof mounted launcher. Some vehicles have been
seen with Spandrel/Spigot missile combination.

Weight:        7.7 tons             Main Gun:    None       

Crew/Pass:     3/2                  Missiles:    Spandrel, 15 rds

Engine:        140 hp petrol        Sec Gun:     None

Speed:         100 kph              Armor:       Light


2S6 30mm/SA-19 Self-Propelled AA Vehicle

The Soviet 2S6 was first seen in 1986 in then East Germany. It appears to be
a very capable gun & missile system. Its four 30mm guns, although much longer,
probably share ammo with the BMP-2. The SA-19 SAMS are IR homers and probably
have a range of 10 km. It has separate serach and track radars and a laser
ranger.

Weight:        18.0 tons            Main Gun:    4x30mm, 2000 rds       

Crew/Pass:     4/0                  Missiles:    SA-19, 8 rds

Engine:        520 hp diesel        Sec Gun:     None

Speed:         60 kph               Armor:       Light

                                                                  [Page 143]

ZSU-23(4)"Shilka" Self-Propelled AA Gun

The Soviet ZSU-23(4), or "Zoo" as it's known to western forces, entered 
service in 1966. Each 23mm gun has a rate-of-fire of 1000 rpm. Its single
search/track J-band fire control radar has a range of 20 km. It's a very
effective system when employed with missile armed systems. It's also fielded
by Egypt, Syria and Iraq.

Weight:        14 tons              Main Gun:    4x23mm, 2000 rds       

Crew/Pass:     4/0                  Missiles:    None

Engine:        280 hp diesel        Sec Gun:     None

Speed:         44 kph               Armor:       Light


ZSU-57(2) Self-Propelled AA Gun

The first post-WW2 eastern bloc AA system, the Soviet ZSU-57(2) entered
service in 1955. Its chassis is based on the T-54 tank, but with much thinner
armor. Its twin 57mm guns are quite effective in a ground fire role, but have
limited AA capability due to its mechanical reflex sight. It's still fielded
by Egypt, Syria and Iraq.

Weight:        28.1 tons            Main Gun:    2x57mm, 316 rds       

Crew/Pass:     6/0                  Missiles:    None

Engine:        520 hp diesel        Sec Gun:     None

Speed:         50 kph               Armor:       Light


SA-6 "Gainful" Self-Propelled SAM Vehicle

The Soviet Gainful had a long and troubled development period, finally
entering service in 1967. It saw much success in the 1973 Yom Kippur War. The
SA-6 missile uses semi-active radar homing guidance. Gainful works in
conjunction with the "Straight-Flush" radar system. It's also fielded by
Egypt, Syria and Iraq.

                                                                  [Page 144]

Weight:        14   tons            Main Gun:    None       

Crew/Pass:     3/0                  Missiles:    SA-6, 3 rds

Engine:        240 hp diesel        Sec Gun:     None

Speed:         44 kph               Armor:       Light


SA-13 "Gopher" Self-Propelled SAM Vehicle

The Soviet Gopher entered service in 1977. In Soviet units, it's replacing
the older Gaskin on a one-for-one basis. The SA-13 missile is very capable.
It uses radar only for ranging as the missile is an IR homer; it has a range
of 8 km. The Gopher utilizes a variant of the MT-LB chassis. It's also fielded
by Siria and Iraq.

Weight:        12.5 tons            Main Gun:    None       

Crew/Pass:     3/0                  Missiles:    SA-13, 4 rds

Engine:        240 hp diesel        Sec Gun:     None

Speed:         60 kph               Armor:       Light


2S1 S0-122 Self-Propelled Artillery Vehicle

The Soviet "Gvozdika" (Carnation) entered service in 1971. Outwardly, its 
appearence is very similar to the US M109. The Soviets were slow to adopt
self-propelled artillery, continuing to rely on towed weapons. SP's are less
vulnerable to counter-battery fire nad provide crew protection. It's also
fielded by Syria and Iraq.

Weight:        16 tons              Main Gun:    122mm, 40 rds       

Crew/Pass:     4/0                  Missiles:    None

Engine:        240 hp diesel        Sec Gun:     one MG

Speed:         60 kph               Armor:       Light

                                                                  [Page 145]

S-60 Anti-Aircraft Gun

The Soviet S-60 is indicative of the many types and calibres of towed/fixed
anti-aircraft guns still in use today. While limited in their flexibility,
they are as accurate, or more accurate in some cases, than their self-
propelled counterparts. Towed guns are fielded by many nations including
most middle eastern nations.

Weight:        4.5 tons             Main Gun:    57mm, 200 rds       

Crew/Pass:     7/0                  Missiles:    None

Engine:        None                 Sec Gun:     None

Speed:         Towed                Armor:       None


Sa-3 "Goa" Low/Medium Altitude SAM System

The Soviet Goa is obsolete by today's standards; it entered service in 1961.
Aircraft counter-measures have made significant advances rendering missiles
of the Goa's ere almost useless. However, there's always luck. The Goa is a
radar beamrider; it works in conjunction with the "Low Blow" radar system.
It's also fielded by Iraq.

Weight:        7.0 tons             Main Gun:    None       

Crew/Pass:     3/0                  Missiles:    SA-3, 4 rds

Engine:        None                 Sec Gun:     None

Speed:         Towed                Armor:       None

                                                                  [Page 146]

MI-24W "Hind-E" Gunship

The Soviet Hind first appeared in 1972. It was originally designed as a 
heavily armed assault helicopter, but has evolved into a capable gunship.
It lacks the nap-of-the-earth maneuverability of its western counterparts. 
Still, it carries a heavy load, and has retained its transport capacity. It's
also flown by Syria and Iraq.

Weight:        12 tons              Main Gun:    12.7mm       

Crew/Pass:     2/8                  Missiles:    Spiral ATGM, Rockets, 
                                                 SA-7 AAM
Engine:        two 2,200 shp        Weapon Load: 2.4 tons

Speed:         295 kph              


Mi-8TBK "Hip-E" Transport Helicopter

When it first appeared in 1961, the Soviet Hip was a simple, quasi-military
transport helicoper. After years of modifications, the Hip has evolved into
one of the most widely accepted military helicopters with over 10,000 in use.
It's described as the most heavily armed assault helicopter. It's flown by
Egypt, Syria and Iraq.

Weight:        11.2 tons            Main Gun:    12.7mm       

Crew/Pass:     2/28                 Missiles:    Swatter ATGM, Rockets 
                                                 
Engine:        two 1,700 shp        Weapon Load: 3 tons

Speed:         130 kph              

                                                                  [Page 147]

MI-28 "Havoc" Gunship

Often descried as the Soviet Apache, the Havoc completed pre-production
testing in 1989. A true gunship, as opposed to the Hind's hybrid approach,
the Havoc's narrow silhouette and tandem seating are much more suited to its
role. Its high speed agility has also been enhanced by a new rotor structure.

Weight:        11.4 tons            Main Gun:    30mm, 300 rds       

Crew/Pass:     2/0                  Missiles:    Spiral ATGM, Rockets, 
                                                 SA-14 AAM
Engine:        two 2,200 shp        Weapon Load: 3 tons

Speed:         165 kph              


KA-34 "Hokum" Combat Helicopter

By 1990, the Soviet Hokum was still in the testing stage. The exact role of
the helicopter is not yet known. Kamov (Ka) helicopters have always been
produced mainly for maritime roles. It may be intended for amphibious assault
escort or anti-helicopter combat. It has the distinctive Kamov mark of
contra-rotating rotors.

Weight:        7.5 tons             Main Gun:    30mm, 300 rds       

Crew/Pass:     2/0                  Missiles:    Spiral ATGM, Rockets,

SA-342 Gazelle Utility Helicopter

The French Gazelle first flew in 1967. It has been utilized in many different
roles, from recon, liaison and light attack, and many civilian applications.
A disguised Gazelle was used in the filming of the movie Blue Thunder. It has
been exported to over 41 nations including Great Britain, Egypt, Syria, Kuwait
Qatar and Iraq.

                                 APPENDIX


REGIONAL DEPOLYMENTS


CENTRAL EUROPE


Current Events

This area has gone through more change, in a short perios of time, than any
regional area in the twentieth-centure. Ten years ago, no one could have
predicted what is now taking place.

The Germanies are reunited and the Warsaw Pact has collapsed into a quasi-
polititcal organization; its military teeth are gone. Civil and political
strife continues to escalate in the Soviet Union; this has further de-
stabilized the region.

The Soviet Union is a giant teetering on the brink of civil war. The old guard
conservatives and the liberal progressives (right-wing moderates by our
standards) are each vying for control of the country. Whoever ultimately
evolves as the victor will have far-reaching effect on the military stability
of the region.

Western Europe is a very appealing target. Its consumer goods, resources,
technology and labor force are hard to ignore. The Soviet Union, regardless
of who wins political supremacy, has tremendous "needs" and corresponding
expectations. They will get the goods one way or another.

The ex-Soviet client states are also a potentional hotbed. Their new found
freedom has opened the door for secularism to again rear its ugly head. There
have been clashes between the Czechs and Slovaks, and the Baltic States are
constantly at odds with their old master.

These internal conflicts have a habit of escalating to major proportions and
drawing in other "interested parties".


Military Balance

Even without the non-Soviet Warsaw Pact Forces, the Soviet Union can still 
field over 3,000,000 men just in the land forces. Equipment includes over
50,000 tanks, 70,000 IFVs and APCs, 60,000 pieces of artillery and over 4,500
helicopters. There's no question that a portion of the equipment is obsolete,

                                                                  [Page 152]

and is no longer of the first line status, even by Soviet standards.

The Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty (CFE) is being touted by many as
the greatest peace initiative since the Treaty of Ghent. Don't be fooled by
all the rhetoric.

The CFE treaty calls for equal force limits in five broad categories: MBTs,
AFVs, artillery pieces, combat aircraft and armed helicopters. These 
categories were arbitrarily selected because of their reference to "offensive"
weapons. These limits affect the forces fielded by all treaty signors (it was
signed by the 22 members of NATO and the Warsaw Pact). The immediate result
of the treaty - many nations, especially the Soviet Union, must dispose of
military equipment.

Here's where it gets sticky. The treaty simply allows the Soviet Union to
dispose of outdated equipment or just to hold or store it east of the Ural
mountains. Only the countries physically located in Europe must permanently
dispose of their equipment.

Of course, the USA also benefits from this apparent "loophole". Much of the
US equipment must be stationed outside of Europe (the Persian Gulf region, for
example) or returned to the USA. The question is, how long will it take to
move it back?


Geography

The area boasts of some of the most fertile ground found in the world. Parts
are mountainous or heavily forested, while others are as flat and clear as
the plains of Kansas. Towns and villages dot a countryside cut by many small
rivers and their tributaries and crisscrossed by a highly developed road and
rail net.


The Conflict

Soviet forces cross the border into the new Germany after "rescuing" Poland
from Western Europe dominance. Economic woes and a restless, impatient
populace prompt the new conservative Soviet government to use military might
to quickly solve their problems. After all, the aggressive Western Europeans,
backed by the equally aggressive USA, have forced them to take this
action to protect their borders.

As part of the US V Corp, you must stem the Soviet tide to buy time for the
mobilization of all NATO forces and the re-deployment of US forces from other
regions.

                                                                  [Page 153]

PERSIAN GULF


Current Events

The recent events in this region have been near and dear to all of our hearts.
It couldn't have had a better ending if it had been written as a Hollywood
movie script. Still, conflict is a way off life here.

The region has seen constant war dating back to biblical times. In addition
to the most recent UN sanctioned action, the past fifty years have witnessed
constant civil wars and changes of government (mostly bloody), five Arab -
Israeli conflicts, regional clashes, terrorism, internal genocide and a
protracted war between Iran - Iraq ... not a pretty picture when you
think about it.

It remains an extremely volatile region. The coalition force that fought in
Operations Desert Storm and Sabre are held together by a thread. Countries
not stand beside allies whom they only recently fought as enemies. The 
smallest provocation could trigger a conflict between these strange bedfellows
No one has forgotten the old hatreds; there was just something else a little
more pressing.

The poor Arab States hate the rich Arab States; the communist Arab States hate
the monarchies; most of the Arab States hate the Israelis and the Egyptians
because they don't hate the Israelis this year; and the Iranians generally
hate Arabs because they're Arabs, not Persians. In addition to all this,
Lebanon looks like a wasteland since just about everyone is using it as a pin
cushion to work out their differences.

In spite of this, don't let anyone tell you different - oil is the focus. 
That's not to say that these other issues are just passing fancies. Its a 
matter of the have-nots wanting what the have's have or the have's just 
wanting more. Economics, not politics is calling the shots.


Military Balance

The recent conflict has left the area in a very fluid state, to say the least.
In spite of the drubbing they took, the Iraqis still possess a large fighting
force even if most of them are now on foot. How many men remain in uniform
and how much equipment is still in Iraqi hands is unknown. They were able to
save the majority of their aircraft by flying them over the border into Iran.

To the east of Iraq is Iran; not one of our closest allies by any stretch of
the imagination. They appear to be perched like vultures; waiting to pounce on
any opportunity. They field a 750,000 man army, but modern mechanized
equipment is limited or in disrepair.

                                                                  [Page 154]

Another potential antagonist is Syria. They have never really cared for the
rich royalty of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. After all, Syria doesn't have much
oil to speak of - see, that oil issue again! They only went along with the
coalition, not being as shortsighted as Jordan, because they knew Iraq
couldn't win. There was a lot of money to be had from those same rich Arabs.
They have a 400,000 man army, with the equipment to back them up. While always
considered a bit suspect militarily, they can't be overlooked.

With the exception of Israel and Egypt, the other Arab States field rather
small forces.


Geography

This is a desert region, pretty much hot, flat and generally barren. The 
cities are situated on the coasts, with the exception of the Tigris-Euphates
valley (the fountain of life - a bit of irony) that runs through most of Iraq.
The topography of Iran is, however, quite different. It's fairly mountainous
and water is plentiful.


The Conflict

Still licking her wounds from the last war and bitter about the UN imposed
sanctions, Iraq allies with Iran (that was part of the plan all along) and
launches a renewed offensive into Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. They have managed
to "buy" off Syria who decides to sit this one out.

As part of the standing US Persian Gulf force, you must hold the line while
the RDF is staged into the region.

                                                                  [Page 155]

DESIGNER'S NOTES


The Plan

It was a bit scary when MicroProse's President, Bill Stealey, originally
proposed a sequel to the highly successful Gunship. The first thought that
came to mind was, how could we possible ever top that product?

After the smelling salts were passed around, we started to kick around a few
ideas. That really got the creative juices flowing, and it started to seem 
like a great idea - we now wished we had suggested it first.

We knew that the new simulator had to be much broader in scope than the
original. It would have to include most of the neat helicopters that the Army
(sorry Marines, we'll give you equal time in a later scenario) currently have
in their inventory, plus the ones that are still on the drawing board. This
futuristic perspective is where the 2000 in the title comes from.

We were lucky in one respect. Early on, we guessed that the Army would select
the Boeing/Sikorsky version of the LHX, now designated the AH-66A Comanche.
We knew if we went in that direction, we were committed, since the Army wasn't
going to make its final selection until April of 1991. You know what they
always say - I would rather be lucky than good.

We also wanted to exapnd into the operational components of multihelicopter
command. Not that flying a single helicopter can't be fun (after all, we did
retain that capability), it's just that there's more to helicopter operations.

We tried to go to extremes to capture the "realism" of helicopter combat.
Real action doesn't take place at 2,000 feet. It happens right next to the
ground. You feel like you're going to suck the leaves off the trees as you
fly by. This is why Gunship 2000 is the way that it is. We wanted you right
next to the ground, weaving in and out of the canyons and between the hills
just like the real pilots.

We made the "bad" guys act like bad guys, to a point - we still wanted you to
have fun. After all, this is supposed tobe fun, not work. We only took a few
liberties with the realism.

The selection of the Persian Gulf was made, believe it or not, long before the
actual conflict erupted in the region. It's not that we have a corner on

                                                                  [Page 164]

crystal balls; the region has been a hotbed for years. It was really a pretty
easy call. It's lucky the real thing worked out as well as it did. We never
intended to capitalize on the conflict; we're happy to strictly deal in
"simulating" the actions.

The selection of Central Europe as the other theater was not an attempt at any
political statement, or a prediction of impending doom and gloom. It's just
that the US has a large standing fore in the region, in spite of the forces
transferred to the Persian Gulf. Since Gunship 2000 is a simulation, we're
simulating what could happen IF, and only IF, a war did break out. The terrain
found in the region also gave us the chance to show off Gunship 2000's new
3-D system.


The Team

Many people contributed to the making of Gunship 2000; I apologize to those
not specifically mentioned. It was a team effort, and we had a great team!

Early on, we realized that we certainly couldn't utilize the 3-D system from
the original Gunship and the 3-D system used in our other 3-D products, such
as F-19 and F-15II, didn't provide a low level view of the terrain. We just
had to design a new system.

This is where Darrell Dennies worked his magic. Darrell started on the system,
now dubbed Topographical 3-D, back in February of 1990. He developed an 
entirely new concept to emphasize and accent the terrain where helicopters
operate. The results of his efforts speak for themselves. The worlds are rich
in color and depth of detail. The terrain features aren't just painted on the
ground, they actually "fit" into one another as they do in real life. You can
actually look through the railroad tunnel to the other side! The terrain also
includes fills and "fancy" patterns on the ground and even the trees. In the
campaign game, the structures destroyed in previous missions are still 
destroyed when you find them again; the train even moves along the railroad
tracks. This system is the most complex 3-D model yet developed by MicroProse;
it's probably superior to anything you've seen.

Darrell also programmed all of the "flight" related functions. He never ceased
to amaze us all. One moment there could be a problem with a function or 
feature, and before you could bat and eye, Darrell had it corrected or added
to the game. There wasn't anything Darrell couldn't fix or, somehow, squeeze
into the program.

                                                                  [Page 165]

The mission generation system was developed, and for the most part designed,
by Detmar Peterke. He had the patience and insight to interpret my obscure
concepts into something that would work. It wasn't easy coming up with a
system that would generate challenging missions that could still be fun. He
developed the "action area" system that's used for selecting options. Detmar,
with the help of Dave McKibbin, also "tweaked" all of the nifty animations
into the game.

Detmar applied an "artist's eye" to his programming; this touch is reflected
in the "look" of the game's starting and ending sequences. It's not often
that you find this rare combination of talents.

Speaking of art, we couldn't have been more fortunate than to have Mike Reis 
as a member of the team. He spent many long, tiring hours designing and
drawing all of the terrific art. The screens aren't just scanned images or
touch ups of other people's art, they're original and hand drawn. His art has
the look of real "live imagery"; you get the feeling that you're standing in
the room or sitting in the tent. That's a lot of pixels and colors to worry
about!

I know Mike often wanted to say "not you again" whenever we walked into his
office with another change or idea, but he put up with constantly critiquing
of suggesting changes to the art. It's a good thing he's not thin-skinned;
he probably would have "skinned" us many times over - and deservedly so.

I would be remiss in not thanking Max Remington for his terrific 3-D objects.
He outdid himself again! Max is known as the "machine" around these parts.
Whatever you ask for, he produces, no matter how complex or obscure. The
helicopters in Gunship 2000 are the most complex objects we've ever included
in a simulation; and, it's not like he had the luxury of working in an
environment of unlimited capacity - he still had to make it fit.

Jeff Briggs wrote all of the music that you hear during the game. He did a 
great job in capturing and setting the "mood" of the game. He had to write
them all as original compositions, and had to try to make them fit within the
presentation of the game. This wasn't an easy task. In many cases he had only
concepts to work form.

Ken Lagace along with Jim McConkey and Scott Patterson produced all of the
game's sound effects. If you're lucky enough to have a Roland or AdLib
sound card, you can experience the exciting sounds of helicopter flight and
combat.

                                                                  [Page 166]

Iris Idokogi and her staff of thousands (just kidding, the printed material
looks so good, you would think it really took that many people to develop it)
are to thank for the printed material. They're the group that usually gets
the least amount of time. We designers always try to wait until the last 
minutes to finish writing the manual. Fortunately, Iris is persistent, and she
doesn't let us get away with too much.

I tip my hat to the quality assurance folks; they have the toughest row to hoe
They are tasked with finding all of the things that don't work. No one is ever
happy to see or hear from them, but their job is a key part of the process.
Chris Taormino and the gang did a great job in keeping all of us honest.

After all that, it leaves the design element of the game - that's me. I did
what all designers do at MicroProse - research & develop the scope and flow
of the game, and basically annoy everyone else. I also wrote the documentation
with the help of Sean Gallagher, and developed all of the charts, tables and
miscellaneous text.

One part of the game i really enjoyed doing, at least I thought so when I 
started it, was designing the terrain and layouts for the 6 worlds in Gunship
2000. Darrell developed a number of tools specifically for this portion of
the game that made my life easier. About 150 unique tiles were created for the
worlds. Each world has over 4,000 "tiles" that are linked together to make the
terrain look uniform. I started to dream about these tiles; I was smart enough
not to tell my wife that she had been displaced in my dreams.

The whole idea behind the game was to capture the essence of helicopter combat
and to present it in an enjoyable, entertaining format. I believe we were
successful. Only you can truly judge the results.
