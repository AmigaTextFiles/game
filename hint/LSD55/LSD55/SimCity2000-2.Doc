   WATER SYSTEM            
    The Water System tool is a multi-use tool. Clicking and holding on
    it opens a submenu that allows you to choose between five different 
    water-related functions: laying water pipes, installing water pumps, 
    buying storage tanks, and  building treatment and desalinization plants. 
    When this tool is active, the cursor appears as a water faucet.

    Depending on the year and technology level I your city, you may only 
    have access to pumps and water towers. As time passes and inventions 
    are invented, the other options become availible. A city can exist 
    without a water system, but population density will be limited. When 
    the Sims build, they install the underground water pipes for their 
    buildings. You're only responsibility is to hook the buildings up to 
    the water system.                   
    
    Pipes (the default setting) lets you "paint" your water pipes onto the 
    landscape by clicking in the place where you want the pipes to stop, and 
    releasing the mouse button. If you start laying a water pipe and change 
    your mind, you can cancel the operation by holding down the Shift key 
    before you release the mouse button. Water pipes are always laid 
    underground. Activating Pipes automatically turns on the underground
    view so you can see your pipes.
    Cost: $3 per tile.               
    
    Water Pumps when placed on land act as wells, a good source of water.
    water. Water pumps need to be hooked to the power grid to function. 
    When pumps are placed right next to a lake or river, they supply twice 
    as much water as a well. A pump placed next to a coastline (salt water) 
    only produces as much water as a well.
    Cost: $100 per pump. 

    Water Towers lets you store precious water so you won't have summer 
    shortages in arid climates.
    Cost: $250 per tower.

Page 62  SimCity 2000 - Reference

    Treatment  plants clean and recycle your city's water, lessening
    seaonal shortages.
    Cost: $500 per treatment plant.

    Desalinization plants remove the salt from sea water. They are expensive,
    but sometimes necessary in beach communities with little or no other 
    source of water. Desalinization plants, which need power to function, 
    have internal pumps, and don't require extra water pumps. They produce 
    approximately twice as much as a water pump next to a river.
    Cost: $1,000 per desalinization plant.

   REWARDS
    This button is like a surprise package. It will be ghosted and 
    unavailable until you deserve a reward. Rewards are based on your city's 
    population, and consist of special buildings and monuts to your mayoral 
    prowess. When this tool is active, the cursor appears as a mayor tipping
    his hat.

    The rewards you can strive to gain are... no, I won't tell you. You'll
    just have to wait and see for yourself.

   ROADS
    Roads is a multi-use tool. Clicking and holding on it opens a submenu that 
    allows you to choose between five different road-related functions:   
    placing roads and highways, and building tunnels, onramps and bus depots. 
    When this tool is active, the cursor appears a a piece of paved road.

    Depending on the year and technology level of your city, you may only have 
    access to roads and tunnels. As time passes, the other options become 
    available.

Page 63  SimCity 2000 - Reference

    Road (the default setting) lets you "paint" your roads onto the land by 
    clicking in the place where you want the road to start, dragging the 
    cursor to the place you want the road to stop, and releasing the mouse 
    button. If you start laying a road and change your mind, you can cancel 
    the operation by holding down the Shift key before you release the mouse 
    button.        

    Roads can run in straight lines, 90-degree angles and 45-degree angles. 
    When roads cross, they form an intersection. If you lay a road across 
    water and it is possible to build a bridge, you will be told how much it 
    will cost. If a bridge can't be built, you will be notified.
    Cost: $10 per road tile.  

    Highways are high-capacity roads that are raised above the ground on 
    pylons. They can handle four times as many cars as regular roads. They 
    are placed the same way as roads. You will need to place onramps to allow 
    cars to get on and off highways. When highways cross, they form 
    cloverleafs. if you lay a highway across water and it is possible to 
    build a bridge, you will be told how much it will cost. If a bridge can't 
    be built, you will be notified.
    Cost:   $100 per highway section (4 tiles).

    Tunnel lets you make pathways for roads through hills and mountains.
    Tunnels cannot curve, and you cannot cross tunnels even at different 
    altitudes. To place a tunnel, click on the tile that you want as your 
    entrance point. The entrance point must be a sloped tile. Your highway 
    engineers won't try to build a tunnel where it's impossible to build, or 
    where it is unsafe, due to unstable terrain. If you pick a good spot, an 
    engineer's report will tell you how much the tunnel will cost and ask if 
    you want to go ahead or not. 
    Cost: $150 per tile of tunnel.

Page 64  SimCity 2000 - Reference
	
    Onramps allow cars and buses to travel back and forth between roads
    and highways.  Place them as junctions between roads and highways. 
    For best results, put onramps on both sides of a highway
    Cost: $25 per tile.

    Bus Depots allow commuters to take the bus to work and help alleviate
    traffic. They must be placed on level ground. You will need at least 
    two bus depots since buses travel between them.  Passengers can get on
    and off between depots.
    Cost: $250 per depot.

   RAILS
    Rails is a multi-use tool.  Clicking and holding on it opens a submenu
    that allows you to choose between four different rail-related
    functions: placing rails, placing subways (underground rails), building 
    rail depots and building subway stations. When this tool is active, the 
    cursor appears as a length of track.
    
    Depending on the year and technology level of your city, you may only
    have access to rails and rail depots. As time passes, the other options
    become available.

    Rail (the default setting) lets you "paint" your tracks onto the land
    by clicking in the place where you want the rail to start, dragging
    the cursor to the place where you want it to stop, and releasing the
    mouse button. If you start laying a rail and change your mind, you
    can cancel the operation by holding down the Shift key before you
    release the mouse button. Rails are useless without rail depots.
    Cost: $25 per tile.

Page 65  SimCity 2000 - Reference

    Subways are an underground rail system.  They are places in the
    same way are rails, but while looking at the underground view.
    Subways are useless without subway stations.   
    Cost: $100 per tile.    
    
    Rail Depots allow commuters to get on and off trains. Without depots,
    rails are useless. They must be placed on level ground and adjacent to 
    tracks.  
    Cost: $500 per depot.    

    Subway Stations allow passengers access to access subway trains. Subway
    trains only stop at stations. They must lie placed on level ground, 
    adjacent to a subway line. It's usually easiest to place subway stations 
    while looking at the underground level.
    Cost:   $250 per depot.

    Subway to Rail Junctions allow you to hook up your subways and 
    above-ground rails for a continuous transit system. They must be placed
    adjacent to a rail tile.                 
    Cost $250 per tile.

MAP WINDOW
   
IN GENERAL
   The Map window shows your complete city limits at once with
   vital information in a number of different map displays. It can be
   opened by selecting Map from the Windows menu. It can also be
   opened-in two ways-with the Map button on the City toolbar.
	
   If you click and hold on the Map button, the map (just the map - no Title 
   bar or frame) will pop up, and then go away when you release the button. 
   If you click and drag the button, the full Map window will appear.

   The Map window can be moved around the screen by clicking and dragging 
   the Title bar.  It can be closed by clicking the Close box.

   The Map window has two sizes. Click the Zoom box to toggle between the 
   two sizes. This may vary on different computers; check your machine-
   specific Addendum.

   All map displays include the terrain. Trees and forests are green, water 
   is blue and the land is different shades of brown-the higher the 
   altitude, the lighter the shade.

   Somewhere in the map is a rectangle that outlines the area of the city 
   that currently shows in the City window. Clicking on the map moves the 
   rectangle to the place where you clicked, then redraws the City window 
   to show the rectangle's new contents.

THE MAP TOOLBAR
   The Map toolbar has a number of buttons that let you see a number of 
   different map displays. The pop-up map, which has no toolbar, always shows 
   the last-selected display. Some of the buttons on the toolbar have submenus 
   for even more displays. In maps that display information in shades of grey, 
   the darker the grey, the higher, heavier or denser the item being mapped.

   revenues and expenses. Below those figures is a summary of the current 
   financial situation and an estimate of what your finances will be at the 
   end of the year.

   Each revenue or expense has:
         The name of the revenue or expense. Shift-click on the name to bring 
	 up a helpful explanation of what it is and what it does.

Page 81  SimCity 2000 - Reference

         A percentage setting (in most cases) where you set either the tax 
	 rate you are charging or the amount of funding you are allotting.

         A year-to-date figure showing the up-to-the-moment amount
	 that you've spent or made.

         An annual estimate of what you will have spent or made at the
	 end of the year at the current budget settings.

	 what you should do.

       Note:   When the Budget window opens automatically at the 
	       beginning of a new year, the Year-to-Date column
	       shows the total for the year that just ended and 
	       the Annual Estimate column shows estimated costs 
	       for the year that is just beginning.

   Below is a detailed explanation of each budget item.

   PROPERTY TAXES
    Property taxes are your main source of cash for maintaining and
    expanding your city. You can set the overall tax rate for all zones
    by clicking on the up- and down-arrows. The minimum tax is 0%,
    the maximum is 20%. Any taxes you set here will be equally
    applied to all zones. You can independently set the tax rates for
    residential, commercial and industrial zones in the Property
    Taxes Books.

    Clicking on the Books icon displays a detailed report of the year's
    past and projected tax income. For each month, the following
    information is given:
       
          The residential zone tax rate and tax amount

          The commercial zone tax rate and tax amount

    rates for the three types of zones. If you change the tax
    rates here, the overall rate as shown in the Budget window
    will display the average of the three rates.

    Click on Done to close the Property Taxes Books.

   CITY ORDINANCES
    This line item is a summary of the costs and revenues of all combined 
    city ordinances. These range from education drives to sales taxes to 
    neighborhood watch to an annual carnival.

    Usually, you, as mayor, must approve and establish these programs, but if 
    your city is doing very well, the City Council may take it upon itself to 
    enact some programs that benefit the city. These programs are viewed and 
    established in the Ordinance window, which can opened from the Budget 
    window by clicking on the Community Programs Book icon. The Ordinance 
    window will be described in detail below.

    Click Done to return to the Budget window.

   BOND PAYMENTS
    This is the interest you pay on bond issues.

    If you need cash above and beyond the money you make from property taxes, 
    you can issue municipal bonds, which is basically a loan from your 
    citizens. All bonds are issued for $10,000. The interest you pay on 
    outstanding bonds is prime rate plus 1%, plus an additional percentage 
    based on your city's current value and loan rating.

Page 82  SimCity 2000 - Reference

    Clicking on the Interest book icon opens a dialog box with detailed 
    information and buttons for extra financial transactions.

    For each month of the year, the following information is given: (actual 
    amounts are shown in blue, projected amounts are shown in red.)

          The bonds you have outstanding
	
          The average interest rate you pay on the bonds

          The monthly amount of interest you pay on the bonds

          The accumulated total interest paid

    Show Bonds displays:
       
          Your city's current loan rating

          The total number of bonds you have outstanding

          The current interest rate the bank is paying on your account

          The interest rate you will pay on a bond if you issue it now

          The current value of your city (the infrastructure)

    Loan ratings range from AAA to F. Your rating is based on your city value. 
    The higher your rating, the more bonds you can issue and the lower the 
    interest rate you pay on them.

    Issue Bond opens a dialog that tells you the current interest rate for 
    bonds and asks you if you want to issue one. All bonds are $10,000. If 
    you need or want more than $10,000, then you can issue two bonds. If you 
    need or want less, too bad-take the $ 10,000 and keep what you don't 
    spend in the bank. If your loan rating or city value is too low, you 
    won't be allowed to issue any more bonds.

    Repay Bond opens a dialog that tells you the interest rate on the oldest 
    outstanding bond, and asks if you want to repay it. Bonds are always 
    repaid from the oldest to the newest. During the life of the bond, 
    interest accrues monthly, and is paid out at the end of

Page 84  SimCity 2000 - Reference

    each year from your city funds. You will pay the interest every year until 
    you repay the bond, so once you're flush with cash, pay them off and get 
    out of debt.

    Clicking on Done closes the book.

   POLICE DEPARTMENT
    This is the cost and funding level for police departments in your city. 
    You can set the percentage of funding for your departments by clicking on 
    the up- and down-arrows. In general, try to keep police funding as high 
    as possible to prevent rampant crime. Any funding you set will be equally

   EDUCATION
    This is the cost and funding level for education in your city. This
    funding supports both schools for the children and colleges for higher 
    learning. Without schools, education in your city will be entirely based 
    on verbal lore, and you will be unable to support high-technology 
    industries.

    You can set the percentage of funding for education by clicking on the 
    up- and down-arrows. Any funding you set here will be equally distributed 
    to all schools and colleges. You can independently set the funding rates 
    for schools and colleges in the Education books. Complete funding for a 
    school costs $25 per year, and a college costs $100 per year.

   TRANSIT AUTHORITY
    This is the cost and funding level for maintaining the transportation 
    system in your city. This funding maintains roads, rails, highways, 
    subways, bridges and tunnels. Without proper funding, your transit 
    systems will deteriorate and commuting and commerce in your city will 
    fall to pieces.

    You can set the overall percentage of funding for your transportation 
    systems by clicking on the up- and down-arrows. Any funding you set here 
    will be equally distributed to all types of transportation. You can 
    independently set the funding rates for roads, rails, highways, subways,

ORDINANCE WINDOW

    The Ordinance window is where community programs and city ordinances are 
    established and inspected. This window can be opened either by selecting 
    Ordinance from the Windows menu or by clicking on the City Ordinance Book 
    icon in the Budget window.

    There are five categories of programs and ordinances: finance, health and 
    safety, education, promotional and other. Click on the names of each 
    program or ordinance for an explanation of what they do as well as their 
    pros and cons.

    To enact a program, click in the checkbox to the right of the program's 
    name. The cost or projected revenue will appear to the right of the 
    check. These amounts will vary with the size and development of your 
    city. The Estimated Annual Costs for all programs is provided in the 
    lower-right corner of the window.

    Click Done to close the Ordinance window.

   FINANCE PROGRAMS

    1% Sales Tax will add cash to your coffers, but may also inhibit local 
    commerce.

    1% Income Tax is a source of city revenues, but may discourage residential 
    growth, and even cause some tax-haters to move away.

Page 89  SimCity 2000 - Reference

    Legalized Gambling can provide extra money that can be put to good use, 
    but brings with it an increase in crime.

    Parking Fines are a small, steady source of the green, but tend to hinder 
    commercial growth a little.

   SAFETY & HEALTH PROGRAMS
    A Volunteer Fire Department can be an economical way to fight fires in 
    small communities, but can't replace the professionals in a big city or 
    during a forest fire.

    A Public Smoking Ban can increase the overall health level in your city 
    and eventually increase the average life expectancy, but will cost a 
    small fee to administer.

    Free Clinics increase the overall health level in the city, but free
    clinics aren't free - at least not to you.

    Junior Sports increases the overall health level of the youth of your 
    city.

   EDUCATION PROGRAMS
    A Pro-Reading Campaign will increase the overall education level in your 
    city, preparing it for an influx of new, high-tech industries.

    An Anti-Drug Campaign can help reduce crime.

    Providing CPR Training as a service to your Sims increases the overall 
    level of health in your city.

    Neighborhood Watch helps reduce crime in residential areas, but at a 
    price.

   PROMOTIONAL PROGRAMS
    Tourism Advertising may or may not pay off in bringing visitors
    with their loose dollars to your fair city. If you do advertise for

Page 90  SimCity 2000 - Reference

    tourists, make sure you have the right attractions, like marinas, 
    stadiums, parks, zoos, rivers, etc.

    Business Advertising can bring new industry into town, but make sure you 
    can support the businesses with ample water, power, transportation, and 
    enough residential and commercial space to hold the influx of new 
    citizens. And low taxes won't hurt, either.

    City Beautification increases residential desirability and land value.

    An Annual Carnival can increase tourist trade and local commerce, and 
    show your Sims a darn good time. The size, cost and benefit of the 
    carnival varies with your city size.

   OTHER PROGRAMS
    Energy Conservation establishes an educational drive to conserve 
    electricity by, among other things, adding insulation to homes and water 
    heaters. This program takes a few years to ramp up to full effect, but 
    will eventually allow your power plants to power up to 15% more buildings.

    Declaring your city a Nuclear Free Zone costs nothing, but can make some 
    of your citizens feel safer, and may even attract new citizens to your 
    fair town. It's a small plus for residential desirability and a small 
    minus for industry. A Nuclear Free Zone will not stop the military from 
    building missile silos or basing nuclear weapons near your city if you 
    give them permission to build a base.

    Homeless Shelters are expensive, but decrease the number of homeless 
    people and increase the number of residents, increasing the labor pool 
    for commerce and industry and marginally increasing land value.

Page 91  SimCity 2000 - Reference

    Pollution Controls slightly lower the amount of industrial pollution in 
    your city, but also make the city slightly less desirable to industry.

    Population shows the age distribution of your population, and
    gives the percentage of the population that is your potential work
    force.

    Health shows the Life Expectancy (LE) of your population, by age,
    and summarizes the LE of your work force.

    Education shows the average education level of your citizens at
    various ages, expressed in their Education Quotient (EQ). A high
    EQ attracts high-tech industry to your city. EQ is affected by the
    presence of schools, colleges, libraries and museums.

   Graphs window can be moved around the screen by clicking and dragging the 
   Title bar. It can be closed by clicking the Close box. The many buttons on 
   the bottom of the window let you toggle on and off various graphic 
   displays. Click on the 1 year, 10 year or 100 year button to set the time 
   scale for the graphs.

   Each graph:

         Is shown in a different color

         Has a "marker" letter or symbol at its right end to help you
	 identify it

         Is followed by a number that gives its current value

   City Size, marked with an "S," is the total city population.

   Residents, marked with an "R," shows the population that isn't part of the 
   job market, including children, elderly and spouses not employed outside 
   of the home.

   Commerce, marked with a "C," shows the number of people employed in 
   commercial jobs.

   Industry, marked with an "I," shows the number of people employed in 
   industrial jobs.

   Traffic, marked with a "T," shows the average density of your road network 
   including buses, but not trains or subways. For this graph, traffic is 
   considered road congestion, not the total amount of travel.

   Pollution, marked with a "P," shows the growth or decline in the general 
   level of pollution in the city.

   Value, marked with a "V," shows the fluctuations of the average land value 
   in the city by graphing the median home price.

   Crime, marked with an "X," shows the changing crime rate in your city.

   Power%, marked with a "p," shows the remaining capacity of your power 
   plant(s). When you get to 0 you'll start to have brownouts.

   Water%, marked with a "w," shows the remaining capacity of your water

   people that are out of work in your city.

   Gross National Product (GNP), marked with a "g," shows the total value of 
   goods and services produced by the residents of SimNation. This affects 
   the market for industrial goods produced in your city.

   National Population (Nat'l Pop), marked with an "n," shows the
   changes in SimNation's total population.

   Fed rate, marked with "%," is the prime interest rate as set by

NEIGHBORS WINDOW 

   The Neighbors window displays your city's population along with the 
   population of its neighboring cities and the total population of 
   SimNation. Use this window to compare your city with the cities that you 
   compete with for people and other resources, and to see just how big a 
   part of the whole nation you are (or aren't).

   The neighbors window can be opened by selecting Neighbors from the Windows 
   menu. It can also be opened - in two ways - with the Neighbors button on 
   the City toolbar.

   If you click and hold on the Neighbors button, the window, with no Title 
   bar or frame, will pop up, and then go away when you release the button. 
   If you click and drag the button, the full Neighbors window will appear, 
   and stay until you make it go away by clicking in the Close box.

   You can move the window around on the screen by clicking and dragging the 
   Title bar.

INSIDE THE SIMULATION
 EASY MEDIUM AND HARD GAMES

   Whenever you start a new city, you have the choice of three difficulty 
   levels, easy, medium and hard. The differences between the levels are:

    The amount of money you start with. In an easy game, you start with 
    $20,000. A medium game gives you $10,000. In a hard game, you start 
    $10,000 in debt, with a bond issue to pay back when you can and interest 
    to pay every year.

    The national financial model. Your city is located somewhere in SimNation. 
    The growth of your city depends on its surroundings - rich, financially 
    healthy neighbors are good customers for your industrial products and, 
    bring their money with them when they visit your tourist attractions. In 
    easy games, SimNation is in a boom cycle. In medium games, the national 
    economy is stable. For hard games, SimNation is in a recession.

    The external industrial product demand. The easier the game, the more 
    demand for the products that your city's industries can produce.

    The propensity for disaster. The harder the game, the more likely is it 
    that your city will be host to a disaster. Choosing No Disasters in the 
    Disasters menu prevents disasters at all difficulty levels.

THE EFFECT OF TIME   

   When you start a new city, you can choose between 1900, 1950,
   2000 and 2050 for its founding year. And as time goes by, things
   change, including:

    The avallable technology. The technology levels in SimCity 2000
    roughly follow reality, give or take a few years. (Except for the
    future stuff, which is just guessing, so don't come to us in 2050 and
    complain that we don't have fusion power yet.) Inventions that
    give you access to new technology are announced in newspaper
    headlines.

Page 97  SimCity 2000 - Reference

    The national financial model. Since the national and world population is 
    larger now than it was in 1900, there are more potential citizens and 
    more potential customers. External demand increases with time. It is 
    easier to build a bigger city in 2000 than it is in 1900.

    The per capita (per zone) power consumption. In 1900 there aren't many 
    ways for the average citizen to squander energy. Then, starting around 
    1930, with the advent of muscle cars and electric-powered everything and 
    lots of electronic toys, power consumption zooms, peaking around 1970. 
    From 1970 to 2000, because of both conservation practices and more 
    efficient gadgetry, per capita power use sinks and levels off. This 
    energy effect in SimCity 2000 is subtle, but can be affected by passing 
    the energy conservation ordinance in the Ordinance window.

SCENARIOS   
   
   SimCity 2000 scenarios are special cities with problems, included both to 
   provide a number of gaming challenges and to help you better design your 
   own cities by seeing the mistakes and problems other cities have faced.

   Scenario cities are all in separate files, and are read into the game
   when you load them. Additional scenarios can be added later.

   Each Scenario includes:

         A pre-built city

         A problem to solve or disaster to face

         A goal to reach
	 
         A time limit to reach the goal

   If you reach the goal within the time limit, you win the scenario, you're 
   given the key to the city, and you can continue to rule the city. If you 
   don't reach the goal within the time limit, you're kicked out of town.

Page 98  SimCity 2000 - Reference

   Typical goals include:
         Reaching a population level
         Reaching a financial goal
         Rebuilding your industry
         Reducing crime, pollution or traffic

ZONES

   One of your primary functions as city planner is zoning-deciding what 
   types of buildings go where. Good zoning allows all city functions to be 
   accessed by all citizens, and sets the feel and flow of life in the city. 
   All zones in SimCity 2000 can be decreed to be either light-density (low 
   population) or dense (high population).

   As you zone areas, the empty zones are shown in colors so you can easily 
   keep track of them. You can turn on and off the display of empty zones in 
   the underground view with the Show Zones button in the City toolbar.

   There are three basic zones in SimCity 2000: residential, commercial and 
   industrial.

         Residential zones, shown in green, are places where Sims live.
	 They include everything from luxury homes to slums.

         Commercial zones, shown in blue, are the shops, stores and offices 
	 of the city.

         Industrial zones, shown in yellow, are the factories and 
	 manufacturing centers of the city.

   Zones can be almost any shape or size that can be made out of squares or 
   rectangles. If you zone over an area that is already zoned, you will be 
   charged for rezoning only if you change the type of zone or the density. 
   You won't be charged for zoning light residential over an existing light 
   residential area, but you will be charged if you zone dense residential 
   (or light or dense industrial or commercial) over light residential.

   To remove zoning from an area without rezoning, use the D&zone
   function of the Bulldozer tool in the City toolbar.

Page 99  SimCity 2000 - Reference

   Sims only build in zoned areas. You, as mayor, can build elements of the 
   city infrastructure (roads, rails, power lines, power plants, etc.), city 
   services (police and fire stations, etc.) and other public places (parks, 
   zoos, museums, libraries, schools, etc.) either in zoned or unzoned areas.

   Zones grow and decay as Sims move in and out of individual buildings, 
   zones or the city. Depending on the times, the economy and your design 
   skills, booming, bustling zones may be abandoned, or empty zones may 
   suddenly become prime real estate and suddenly grow into a city center.

SPECIALIZED ZONES

   Seaports and airports are actually special-purpose zones. They are placed 
   and sized like the basic (residential, commercial and industrial) zones 
   and they needn't be placed in existing zones. Military bases are also 
   specialized zones, but they are automatically placed by the simulation.

NON-ZONES

   Roads, rails, stations, depots, and cityowned buildings like power plants 
   and police stations don't need to be placed in zones. In fact, when you 
   place them in a zone, they de-zone that land. For example, if you place a 
   road across a zone, then remove it with a bulldozer, the newly exposed 
   land will be unzoned. You can save a lot of zoning money by leaving spaces 
   between them for roads and rails and keeping your power plants, stations, 
   depots and departments out of zoned areas.

COMMERCE

   Commerce is primarily trade within your city. It is slow in a small city, 
   since your internal market is small. Commerce remains a much less 
   important aspect of a city until it reaches a population of about 100,000, 
   where income from commerce catches up with industry. As your population 
   grows beyond that, your city may become primarily a commercial center. It 
   will become more and more independent, relying less and less on the 
   external market, but you'll always need at least some industry for a 
   well-balanced city.

Page 100  SimCity 2000 - Reference

   Commercial zones develop better and faster near the city center. Airports 
   provide a big boost to your city's commerce once your city reaches a 
   population of at least 20,000.

INDUSTRY

   Industry is the manufacture of goods and services to sell. You can sell 
   both to the internal market (within your city) and the external market 
   (outside your city).

   Industry is the lifeblood of a small city, and is much more important 
   than commerce while your population is small. When a city is small, there 
   aren't enough customers in it to support itself. You have to manufacture 
   things to sell to the external market and bring in more cash and people. 
   In fact, industry can be thought of as the reason to start a new city.

   Industry is a primary source of employment in your city. It is also the 
   primary source of pollution. Industrial areas tend towards low land value 
   and high crime.

   The Industry window is an important tool if you want to control the 
   direction of industry in your city. It gives you a readout of the current 
   distribution of industries in your city, as well as the external demand 
   for the products of the various industries. It also lets you set different 
   tax levels for different industries to encourage the ones you want and 
   discourage those you don't. You may want to discourage an industry that 
   causes a lot of pollution. You may want to encourage a small industry 
   that you think may be about to boom.

   When you create an industrial zone, the Sims tend to build the industries 
   that are in highest demand. The demand for different industries is related 
   to the era. For example, in 1960, the electronics industry isn't nearly as 
   important, or in as much demand as in 1990.

Page 101  SimCity 2000 - Reference

   A forward-thinking mayor in 1930 just may believe that there is a big 
   future in that upstart, tiny electronics industry. Since it is in low 
   demand, the Sims won't invest in it - unless their mayor gives them a tax 
   incentive. So the mayor lowers the tax on the electronics industry and it 
   begins to grow. Thirty years later it begins to bloom, then boom. That's 
   when the mayor raises the taxes and makes a fortune for the city - while 
   securing lots of jobs in a high-tech, still-growing industry.

   Another forward-thinking mayor whose city is almost entirely supported by 
   one industry, say automotive, may want to diversify before the market 
   crashes and the city becomes a ghost town.

   And yet another forward-thinking mayor may realize that the new high-tech 
   industries won't thrive without an educated population, and will make sure 
   to provide schools, colleges and other educational institutions.

   Many aspects of city design affect industry. The presence of hospitals can 
   give a boost to the petrochemical industry (pharmaceuticals). The presence 
   or lack of seaports can help or hinder heavy manufacturing like steel, 
   mining, and automotive. The presence or lack of a good highway and/or rail 
   system can also affect heavy industry's development. City ordinances can 
   also hinder or help various industries.

POWER

   Yes, cities existed before electricity, but not in SimCity 2000. Sims are 
   electronic life-forms and can't exist without it.

   All zones need power to develop - except for military bases. Power lines 
   transfer power between power plants and zones and between non-adjacent 
   zones. Power isn't transferred through adjacent zones or through roads or 
   rails that divide zones without power lines.

   Tiles with power lines consume power. If you place too many power lines 
   you waste a lot of power.

Page 102  SimCity 2000 - Reference

   The types of power sources available are timedependent. You can't build a 
   nuclear power plant in 1900. As new technology becomes available, it will 
   be announced in the newspapers. All power plants are introduced when they 
   become coefficient - no early, flaky experimental models in this game. 
   Some of SimCity 2000's power sources do not yet exist in the real world. 
   We've made some rough predictions as to when they'll be available and put 
   them into the game. If our predictions are off, sorry - we specialize in 
   simulation, not real stuff. You can mix and match the types of power 
   plants in a single city.

   All power plants have a 50-year life span, after which they collapse. When 
   they collapse, they don't cause fires or leak radiation, they just stop 
   working, and you have to rebuild them (and pay for them all over again). 
   You'll receive warnings about aging power plants in the newspapers, and 
   the Query tool will give your plants' exact ages.

   If you have the No Disasters setting activated (in the Disasters menu), 
   then plants won't collapse. They'll be automatically rebuilt and you'll 
   be charged. If you don't have the cash to rebuild them, then they'll 
   collapse and you'll be out of power and out of luck. So save up cash for 
   power plant replacement or be ready to issue a bond.

   Power is measured in megawatts (Mw). Developed areas require on the 
   average one Mw for three occupied tiles. The exact power consumption 
   varies with time, population density and an occasional city ordinance. 
   Connecting too many buildings to a power source results in brownouts.

Page 103  SimCity 2000 - Reference

   Here is a table comparing the different power plants. The years are +/- 
   10 years.

		 Type           Year   Mw      Cost    Cost
				Avail                 per Mw
		 Coal           1900   200    $4,000    $20
		 Hydroelectric  1900    20      $400    $20
		 Oil            1900   220    $6,600    $30
		 Gas            1950    50    $2,000    $40
		 Nuclear        1955   500   $15,000    $30
		 Wind           1980     4      $100    $25
		 Solar          1990    50    $1,300    $26
		 Microwave      2020  1600   $28,000  $17.5
		 Fusion         2050  2500   $40,000    $16

   Coal power is always available, even in 1900, and is fairly efficient,
   but is the worst polluter.

   Hydroelectric power is always available, even in 1900, is fairly 
   efficient, and doesn't pollute. Hydroelectric dams can only be placed on 
   falling water.

   Oil power is always available, even in 1900, and pollutes about half as 
   much as coal.

   Gas power pollutes even less than oil, but is very inefficient.

   Nuclear power is expensive to build and not too efficient, but it puts 
   out a lot of power. There is also the risk of a meltdown disaster. 
   Nuclear power plants are unavailable if you declare your city a nuclear-
   free zone.

   Wind power is fairly efficient and very clean, but puts out very little 
   power, so you'll need a lot of wind generators to produce serious wattage. 
   Wind power is also subject to the whims of the weather. There is more 
   wind at higher altitudes.

Page 104  SimCity 2000 - Reference

   Solar power is non-polluting and fairly efficient, but has a low output 
   and is unreliable - very little power is produced when it's cloudy or 
   foggy. A combination of solar and wind power plants can produce a stable 
   energy flow since one generally thrives while the other snoozes.

   Microwave power is actually solar power collected by an orbiting satellite 
   and beamed down to a microwave collector disk. It is very efficient and 
   produces a massive amount of power, but is very expensive to "get off the 
   ground," and once in a while the energy beam from the satellite misses the 
   dish. Oops.

   Fusion power is very clean and reliable. It is the most efficient power 
   source and produces enough power to run a city half the size of your 
   entire city limits. It is very safe, with no radiation leakage or 
   meltdowns. But it costs a whole heck of a lot of money.

TRANSPORTATION

   People gotta move. Sims gotta move. Products, delivery trucks, 
   construction materials and all kinds of things need to be moved around 
   the city. Transportation is the city's circulation system. Sims won't 
   start developing a zone or building any buildings until there is access 
   to some sort of transportation system.

   It not only costs money to build your transportation system, but there is 
   a yearly maintenance fee, found in the Budget window. By examining the 
   Transit Authority books, you can set separate funding levels for roads, 
   highways, rails, subways, bridges and tunnels.

   The most basic transpoftation system consists of roads. Sims won't build 
   buildings that are more than three tiles from a road (or other 
   transportation system), so if you're after density, the largest area that 
   will fully develop is a 6 x 6 square surrounded by road. If you're more 
   interested in aesthetics, then you can make larger squares or rectangles 
   and put parks or forests in the undeveloped center.

Page 105  SimCity 2000 - Reference

   Tunnels allow roads to run through mountains instead of going around them. 
   They can be a real convenience, but they can also be expensive. They cost 
   more to build than roads, and their yearly maintenance is higher. Tunnels 
   can't cross each other, even at different altitudes.

   When roads carry up to 44 cars per minute, it is considered to be
   "no traffic." From 44 to 88 cars per minute is light traffic, and above
   that is heavy traffic. Watch the newspapers for traffic-related
   stories and check the traffic map in the Map window to find
   trouble spots. In addition to causing traffic, roads or the cars on
   them are a major source of pollution in your city.

   Once your roads are overloaded, you have a number of options, depending 
   on the year in your city. In 1900 your only transportation options are 
   roads, tunnels, rails and rail depots. Other options become available as 
   new technologies develop. Watch the newspapers for inventions that give 
   you access to new forms of transportation.                           

   These are the years, +/-1 0 years, when different forms of transportation 
   become available:

       1910    Subways and subway stations
       1920    Buses and bus depots
       1930    Highways and onramps

   Buses allow roads to carry more people than roads alone without generating 
   problem traffic. To start a bus line, you need at least one bus depot. 
   Buses leave the depot and let passengers on and off all along the way. 
   There are no animated buses, so the visible effect of a bus depot is a 
   lowering of traffic near the depot. Bus depots must be adjacent to roads. 
   If they are adjacent to onramps or highways but, not a road, they won't be 
   effective. Buses are a more efficient use of gasoline than cars, so they 
   produce much less pollution per passenger. Pollution levels are slightly 
   but noticeably lower around effective bus depots.

Page 106  SimCity 2000 - Reference

   Highways are basically two roads, one in each direction, so they are 
   capable of carrying twice as many cars as a road. In addition, because 
   they can travel at a higher speed on a highway, Sims will commute farther 
   on a highway than on a road-up to three times as far. You must provide 
   onramps everywhere you want to let Sims enter or exit the highway. Sims 
   can't travel back and forth between zones and onramps without roads. A 
   highway system is an extension of a road system, not a replacement.

   Rails are the paths your trains follow. Sims can only get on or off 
   trains at rail depots. Depots must be adjacent to rails, and you need at 
   least two for a working rail line. Rails can carry many more commuters 
   than roads, plus they are a big boost to heavy industry, allowing 
   shipping of goods and raw materials around the city. Since trains go 
   faster than cars on city streets, Sims will commute farther by train than 
   by car. Compared with cars, trains produce almost no pollution.

   Subways are underground rail systems, but are primarily for passengers, 
   and less for the shipping of goods and raw materials. They can be 
   connected directly to rail lines for a continuous flow of train cars. 
   Passengers can only get on and off subways at subway stations. The 
   advantage of subways over other transportation systems is that they are 
   mostly underground. They don't take up valuable real estate. And if you 
   want to add rails to an already developed city, you'll have to tear down 
   a lot of buildings for the rails themselves as well as the large depots. 
   Subways only require small (1 tile) access ways above ground, so they can 
   be added to a city without calling in the wrecking crew. The disadvan-
   tage of a subway system is that its very expensive to build and maintain. 
   Subways produce almost no pollution.

   When simulating traffic, SimCity 2000 doesn't really simulate every Sim 
   in your city going to work and back and to the store and back and to 
   school and back and to the pub and back and everywhere else they go. With 
   thousands or millions of citizens this would take forever to simulate. 
   The way the traffic model works is a process called "trip generation" and

Page 107  SimCity 2000 - Reference
   
   works on a building-by-building basis. It also works on the assumption 
   that most trips will be from one type of zone to another.

   For each building in each zone, the simulator generates trips to both of 
   the other types of zones. If the starting building is a house in a 
   residential zone, the simulation will search out a path to a commercial 
   zone and back, and to an industrial zone and back. It tries to avoid 
   heavy traffic areas, and if it bumps into mass transit, there is a 50/50 
   chance it will take it.

   There is a time limit for each trip, and if the time runs out before 
   reaching a zone, then the trip is a failure. The time limit is stable, 
   but the allowable distance to the destination depends on the mode of 
   transport. Since highways, rails and subways travel faster than cars on 
   regular roads, the simulation can go up to three times as far while 
   looking for a destination zone.

   If a failed trip involves mass transit, then the next time that same
   building is checked, it won't even try that same type of mass transit.

   So the amount of traffic alleviated by mass transit depends on two
   things:
      
      1.      The whims of the Sims - that 50/50 chance.
      2.      Your city's design - if the bus or train won't get the Sims
	      where they want to go, they'll drive.

   A bad mass transit system is worse than none at all, because it
   won't get used. To promote the use of mass transit as much as
   possible:
   
   1.      Put bus or rail depots or subway stations near busy intersec-
	   tions.
   2.      Make sure that mass transit lines travel through different
	   types of zones. A bus line that stays in a residential zone won't
	   have much business.

Page 108  SimCity 2000 - Reference

PORTS

   Airports and seaports are specialized zones. Placing them in areas that 
   are already zoned is a waste of your funds. An airport's  primary effect 
   is to boost commerce. Seaports boost industry. Neither type of port is 
   necessary (or affordable) in a very small city.

   Once your city starts to grow, your citiSims will let you know when they 
   want ports. The bigger the city, the bigger the ports it will require. 
   Since you can make ports any size you want, and they're very expensive, 
   start small - but leave open space for later expansion. When the city 
   outgrows your small ports, the Sims will let you know when it's time to 
   expand. But if you notice your commercial or industrial zones' growth 
   rate slowing down, you may want to add ports before your Sims ask for 
   them.

   Both types of ports produce pollution, but airports pollute more.

TREES

   Trees and forests add beauty to your city and its surroundings, and 
   improve property values. They are flammable and can help fires spread.

WATER

   Lakes, rivers and oceans are sources of drinking water for your city. 
   They also provide recreational areas and tourist attractions, and improve 
   land value.

   You can add as much water to your city as you want in Terrain-Editing 
   mode, but once you start a city, it is very expensive, so plan ahead.

   Seaports must be on a river or the ocean to be effective, and marinas in 
   the desert are no fun at all.

Page 109  SimCity 2000 - Reference

   You can build a city without any water system at all, but the population 
   won't grow very dense. A basic water system consists of pumps and pipes. 
   When Sims build buildings, they put in the underground plumbing. All you 
   have to do is add the water mains to connect the buildings to the system 
   and supply the water.

   Parts of the water system that are properly supplied with water are 
   animated in light and dark blue. Areas that aren't animated either aren't 
   hooked up or your water source is too small for the population.

   Water pumps, when placed away from fresh water act as wells. The amount
   of water they provide depends on your city's water table and the season. 
   Water pumps placed right next to fresh water (lakes or streams) produce 
   about three times as much as a well on dry land. A pump placed next to 
   salt water (coastline) acts just like a well away from water. To get 
   drinking water from a coastline you need a desalinization plant, which is 
   expensive, but sometimes necessary. Desalinization plants produce twice as
   much water as a water pump near a river.

   Since the amount of water varies with the season, you may end up with 
   shortages during the dry months. Water tanks store water during the wet 
   season so you don't run low in dry times. Another way to prevent droughts 
   is to build a treatment plant to clean and recycle your water.

RECREATIONAL FACILITIES AND OPEN SPACES   
   
   Open spaces, whether they are undeveloped greenbelts or manicured 
   recreational facilities, are important to a city, both aesthetically and 
   psychologically. Besides adding land value, trees, forests and open space 
   give a city a better feel, an openness that makes citizens feel 
   comfortable and encourages new residents.

   As your population rises, your Sims will start demanding recreational 
   facilities. The developed recreation facilities that are available in 
   SimCity 2000 are small parks, big parks, zoos, stadiums and marinas.

Page 110  SimCity 2000 - Reference

   Recreational facilities are primarily for your city's residents, 
   increasing land value and promoting residential zone growth, but they 
   also influence tourism. Small parks increase land value about the same 
   amount as trees, and big parks increase it twice as much. Marinas, zoos 
   and stadiums are a big boost for residential growth.

THE CLIMATE

   Even though you don't see the seasons change or the rains fall, and you 
   don't feel the wind blow (other than an occasional tornado or hurricane), 
   there is a climate model in SimCity 2000 that affects your city. Weather 
   reports are available in the newspapers.

   Weather trends are generated on a monthly basis, when the simulation 
   looks at the current trend and the season and throws in a certain 
   weighted random element and decides the next trend. The different trends 
   are: cold, clear, hot, foggy, chilly, overcast, snowy, rainy, windy, 
   blizzard, hurricane and tornado. Blizzard, hurricane and tornado are the 
   least likely to occur.

   Each trend has a temperature, a wind and a humidity element. In general, 
   temperature affects the water supply, the availability of solar power, 
   and the likelihood of fires and riots; wind affects the availability of 
   wind power, and humidity affects the water supply. These effects combine 
   in various ways in the various trends.

Page 111  SimCity 2000 - Reference

   Pollution as shown in the maps and graphs is a general overall level 
   combining air, water and noise pollution. The biggest polluters in your 
   city are automobiles, then industry and some types of power plants.

   The main things you can do to keep pollution down in your city are to 
   provide good mass transit, opt for low- or non-polluting power sources, 
   and promote low- and non-polluting industries through tax incentives.

REWARDS
   
   So you're a great mayor. So you build a great city with the power of your 
   mind and the sweat of your mouse-finger. So your citiSims love you. So 
   what? Where are the perks?

   That's where the rewards come in. For the most part the rewards are more 
   for the city than for you personally. Some say that the art and the 
   artist are one, so a reward for your city - your creation - is a reward 
   for you. Others say, "Give me the cash." In any event, there are at least 
   a couple rewards that should give your ego a boost.

   Rewards are based on population. As you reach various population levels, 
   you will be notified that a reward is available in a newspaper article 
   and the offering will appear in the submenu under the Rewards button in 
   the City toolbar.

   At population:  You get:

	2,000      A mayor's house

       10,000      City Hall

       30,000      Something cool that will boost your ego


   When your population reaches 60,000, the military asks you if you want a 
   military base in your city. The pros and cons of military bases are 
   covered later in this manual.

   As your city grows, there will be other things that you'll just have to 
   find out for yourself, because I won't tell you. Well, OK. I'll tell you 
   one more: Arcologies at a population of 120,000.

   Arcologies are huge, tall, dense cities-in-a-building. They are like a 
   very dense combination residential, commercial and industrial zone. 
   Arcologies are a way to help your population zoom from mere hundreds of 
   thousands to millions, expanding your tax base. There are four different 
   arcologies, designed in 2000, 2050, 2100 and 2150. Even if you have a 
   huge population, you can't build an arcology until it's ready.

Page 112  SimCity 2000 - Reference

   Arcologies also spur the growth of nearby residential, commercial and 
   industrial zones. Even though they are theoretically totally contained 
   cities, people who live inside will come out to shop and see the sights, 
   and may even work outside. Others may live outside and work inside.

   They look cool too. Unfortunately, arcologies have all the problems of an 
   extremely dense city: lots of crime, pollution and traffic. Technically, 
   arcologies have their own internal police force and traffic system, but 
   there is always an overspill of criminals, travelers and fun-seekers. 
   Make sure you have police coverage near arcologies and that there is 
   ample public transportation surrounding them.

MILITARY BASES   
   
   When your population reaches 60,000, the government will ask if you will 
   grant land for a military base. Depending on the base and your plans for 
   your city, this can be a good thing or a bad thing.

   When you grant land to the military, you don't choose what type of base 
   you get or where it goes-the government does. The types of bases are: 
   army, navy, air force, and missile silos. If your city is on the coast, 
   the odds are that you will get a naval base. If you don't get a naval 
   base, then if your city is fairly flat, you'll most likely get an air 
   force base, and if it is fairly hilly, you'll get an army base. If it's 
   very hilly, you'll probably get missile silos.

   The good parts about a military base are that it gives a boost to your 
   local commerce both by bringing in extra customers for the stores and 
   services in your city, and by supplying civilian jobs. The presence of 
   a military base (other than missile silos) also has a deterrent effect on 
   the monster, and may encourage it to leave sooner. During an emergency, 
   you may also be able to deploy military troops to aid your fire and 
   police departments with the Emergency button.

Page 113  SimCity 2000 - Reference

   The bad parts of a military base are a possible increase in crime (wild 
   times on shore leave and civilian crooks preying on soldiers) and traffic 
   congestion.

   Missile silos are the least desirable base, since they don't have a big 
   enough staff to have an effect on your economy and they're useless 
   against monsters - these missiles would do more damage to your city than 
   to the monster. Even if your city is a nuclear-free zone, you risk getting 
   missile silos if you agree to a military base.

EDUCATION

   Education in SimCity 2000 is expressed as an Educational Quotient, or EQ. 
   The higher the EQ, the more educated your population is. You can see a 
   readout of your citiSims' EQ in the population window. EQs range from 
   zero (brain dead) to 150. The equivalent of a high school education is an 
   EQ of 90. A four-year college degree is an EQ of about 140. The 
   SimNational average EQ is 100.

   A high EQ is a source of pride to your citizens. It makes your city a 
   more attractive place to raise their children. It also attracts high-tech 
   industry. A low EQ is a source of embarrassment and causes insulting 
   stories to appear in your local (and unread) newspaper. A city with a low 
   EQ has a higher likelihood of both unemployment and rioting.

   When you start a new city, the Sims who move in and start their new lives 
   are at least somewhat educated, so you don't have to build schools right 
   away. But don't wait too long, or your settlers' children will be 
   ignorant.

   If you have no schools or colleges, then education consists solely of 
   verbal lore passed down from generation to generation, and children will 
   only achieve about 20% of their parents' EQ.

   Schools each service a population up to about 15,000, depending on the 
   age distribution of your citizens. Enough schools with full funding can 
   increase your city's EQ up to 90 over a period of years.

Page 114  SimCity 2000 - Reference

   Colleges each service a population of up to 50,000, and can eventually 
   increase your city's EQ to as much as 140, but only if you have enough 
   well-funded schools to prepare students for college.

   After Sims graduate high school or college, their EQ will slowly erode. 
   The presence of libraries and museums stops this erosion.

   All educational facilities raise the local land value, and require yearly 
   funding in the Budget window to remain effective.

CITY SERVICES

   City services consist of police and fire protection, hospitals and 
   prisons. All city services require yearly funding in the Budget window to 
   be fully effective. The locations and effective areas of city services 
   can be seen in the Map window.

   Police stations lower the crime rate and raise the land value in a radius 
   around each station. They have the most effect right near the station, 
   and less as distance from the station increases. The locations of police 
   stations, their coverage and the crime rate can be seen in the Map window 
   by using the submenu under the Crime button.

   Each police station has a small jail where prisoners are kept. As a city 
   grows and if crime runs rampant, the small jails will be so full and the 
   police will be spending so much time taking care of the prisoners that 
   their efficiency and area of coverage will go down. At this point you can 
   either build a lot more police stations or build a prison. In SimCity 
   2000, prisons raise the efficiency and effectiveness of your police 
   departments-but only if there is a lot of crime. Prisons are no help to 
   cities with low crime or small populations. If and when your prison gets 
   too full, the newspaper will let you know.

   The presence of fire stations makes fires go out sooner, helps prevent 
   fires from occurring in the first place, and raises land value. They have 
   the most effect near the station. The locations of fire stations and 

Page 115  SimCity 2000 - Reference

   their coverage can be seen in the Map window by using the submenu under 
   the City Services button.

   Hospitals keep your Sims healthy, fix them when they're broken, and raise 
   their Life Expectancy (LE). A fully funded hbspital can serve a population 
   of 25,000 Sims. You can see the effect of hospitals on your population's 
   LE in the population window. If you don't have a hospital, your city's LE 
   will slowly decline to about 35. If you have enough fully funded 
   hospitals the LE will slowly climb to 85. There are also city ordinances 
   (in the Ordinance window) that can have a positive effect on your city's 
   LE.

NEWSPAPERS

   Your city's newspapers are your link to your citizens. Reading them keeps 
   you informed, not only of current events, new inventions, city-
   development announcements and other important or disastrous occurrences, 
   but also of public-opinion polls. Watch your papers closely to see what is 
   important to your Sims.

   The newspapers change every month, so reading them all can be time 
   consuming - but useful. If you activate Subscription in the Newspaper 
   menu, your paper will be delivered twice a year. If you activate Extra!!! 
   in the Newspaper menu, then papers announcing important events-inventions 
   and rewards for city growth-will appear. Otherwise, you will have to open 
   the Newspaper menu and select the paper you want to read. Newspapers 
   announcing disasters will always appear.

   The different papers (once your city is big enough to have more than one) 
   will have different angles on stories, so you may want to read through 
   more than one.

INVENTIONS

   As time passes, things are invented. These inventions give you access to 
   new technologies that you can incorporate into your city. As the 
   technologies become available, new tools will appear in the submenus 
   under the buttons in the City toolbar. Inventions are announced in 
   newspaper Extra!!! editions.

Page 116  SimCity 2000 - Reference

   Here are the inventions and their approximate discovery dates, 
   +1-10 years.

	Subway systems          1910
	Buses and bus depots    1920
	Highways                1930
	Water treatment plants  1935
	Gas power plants        1950
	Nuclear power plants    1955
	Wind power plants       1980
	Solar power plants      1990
	Desalinization plants   1990
	Arcologies              2000, 2050, 2100, 2150
	Microwave power plants  2020
	Fusion power plants     2050


   SimCity 2000 is a very complex simulation. It is also in 256 colors. Both 
   these facts require a lot of computer power. The actual time it takes for 
   a year to pass in your city depends on a number of things, including:

         The type of microprocessor in your computer. SimCity 2000
	 runs on a wide variety of computers. The more powerful your
	 microprocessor, the faster time will pass.

         The microprocessor's clock speed. The faster the processor,
	 the faster the simulation will run.

         The resolution of your screen and the size of your monitor.
	 Depending on your computer, you may be running SimCity 2000 
	 in as low as 512 x 384 pixel resolution or as high as 1280
	 x 1024 or more. The higher the resolution, the more dots
	 SimCity 2000 has to draw on your screen, and the slower it will
	 go. Of course the speed of your computer and your graphics
	 card may make up for lost time.

         The size of your city. The simulation model spends a lot more
	 time and does a lot more calculations on tiles that are
	 developed than on bare land tiles. In a busy city that fills the
	 whole city limits, time will pass much, much slower than in a
	 tiny town. 

Page 117  SimCity 2000 - Reference
	 
   Ways to make the simulation go faster include:

         Setting the speed to Cheetah in the Speed menu.
      
         Keeping the City window small.

         Keeping as few windows as possible open at a time.

         Turning off both Subscription and Extra!!! in the Newspaper
	 menu.

         Turning off Music and Sound Effects (in the Options menu)
	 helps a little.

   But then again, sometimes you don't want time to pass too fast,
   especially when disasters are sweeping through your city or when
   you are trying to keep your city center from decaying. In these
   times of need, you can always open the Speed menu and slow
   things down - or even stop them entirely.

Page 118  SimCity 2000 - Reference

STRATEGIES
 IN GENERAL

   The first thing to do is decide what kind of city you want to build. Once 
   you know what your long-term goals are, you can best plan your strategy.

   If you want to grow your population as large as possible, then zone 
   densely, keep control of crime, and watch the newspapers for public 
   opinion and important inventions. If you want to make a lot of money, 
   then tax your subjects until they scream and keep your spending to a 
   minimum. If you want to create a city that you'd like to live in, then 
   keep your eye on the newspapers for public opinion, and mentally put 
   yourself in your Sims' places.

   Once you start to build, stay small and go easy on the infrastructure. 
   Keep your costs down. You want to get out of the red and into the black 
   as soon as possible. Show a little patience and build up a good reserve 
   of funds.

   As you build, try not to make large, densely concentrated areas. The 
   denser the population of an area, the more pollution and the more crime 
   you have. Try to find a happy medium between suburban sprawl and 
   super-dense city.

   Remember that not only does it cost to build city infrastructure, but it 
   costs to maintain it.

   If you need to skimp on city services, go ahead, but keep your police 
   well-funded. If your town is small or you have a lot of police stations, 
   you may not need to keep them fully-funded, but be careful. Use the Query 
   tool in the City toolbar to see your police stations' effectiveness. If 
   the arrests are equal to the crimes, you can try lowering the funding for 
   a while. Once the arrests fall behind the crimes, add more funding or 
   more police stations. High crime destroys land value, chasing out some of 
   your population and lowering your tax income.

   Skimping on fire department funding is a little less drastic, but can be 
   dangerous. Do so at your Sims' risk. You can turn off disasters in the 
   Disasters menu-if you're a wimp.

Page 119  SimCity 2000 - Reference

   Try to maintain high land values to keep those property taxes coming in. 
   But be sure to zone for some lowcost housing, since all your Sims can't 
   afford to buy luxury homes on waterfront property.

   Remember that you have to replace your power plants every 50 years. 
   Buying the big expensive power plants is more efficient as far as cost 
   per megawatt, but only if your city is large enough to need all that 
   power.

   You need a good balance of the three basic zones, with the number of 
   tiles zoned residential approximately equal to the total tiles zoned 
   commercial and industrial. In a small city, you'll need more industrial 
   than commercial. You'll need equal numbers of each at a population of 
   about 100,000. Above that, lean more towards commercial. The Demand 
   Indicator in the City toolbar lets you know which zones you should be 
   adding.

   Try to work with the land instead of using brute force to overpower it. 
   You'll not only end up with a much more "organic" looking and feeling 
   city, but it'll save you a lot of money. Best yet, pick - or build - a 
   beautiful site for your city before you start to build.

   As for the actual layout of your city, maps of cities from all over the
   world are easily available. Start with your favorite city and improve on 
   it.

   Try the modular approach. First try to design a small, compact 
   "neighborhood," complete with all the zones, transportation and city 
   services you need, that runs very efficiently, or better yet, at a 
   profit. Then copy the pattern of that neighborhood all over the place. 
   Place them strategically so they can share the high-cost city items like 
   schools, colleges, museums and power plants.

   Above all, use your imagination.

Page 120  SimCity 2000 - Reference

DEALING WITH DISASTERS

   Unless you have No Disasters set in the Disasters menu, disasters just 
   happen. The disasters that are connected with a scenario happen even when 
   you have disasters turned off. So there. If you're the adventurous type 
   (or just plain mean) you can set off your own disasters from the 
   Disasters menu and test your preparedness, your quick thinking and the 
   robustness of your city's design. Not all disasters are available in the 
   Disasters menu.

   Certain conditions in your city attract or discourage disasters, and 
   certain city events can even cause them. So, to a certain extent, you can 
   prepare for and even lessen the likelihood of disasters.

   In the event of a disaster, the first thing to do is stop any fires that
   you can. Next, rebuild the utilities, then the transportation system. Be 
   ready to jump on that Emergency button in the City toolbar. It will let 
   you deploy your fire, police and sometimes the military to areas of need, 
   but be careful where you put them. In general, firemen are good at 
   fighting fires, but can be wiped out by rioters; police are good at 
   controlling riots, but can get burnt up in a fire. Both fire and police 
   can handle the manual labor of building dams to help fight floods. If you 
   have a military base, you may have access to troops during an emergency. 
   Military troops are capable of anything police or firemen can do, just 
   not quite as specialized or effective.

   Where a disaster causes destruction in a zone, you must manually bulldoze 
   the rubble in Demolish/Clear mode before the zone will begin to rebuild.

   FIRES
    Fires are most likely to occur when the weather is hot and you don't 
    have good fire department coverage. Fires are also the byproducts of 
    other disasters including air crashes, riots and tornadoes. You can 
    fight fires by using the Emergency button in the City tool bar and 
    blocking their path with the Emergency Fire icons.  As tiles burn up,

Page 121  SimCity 2000 - Reference

    move in and surround the fires. Dispatching your police to the scene of 
    the fire can help keep cars and crowds away and let the firemen do their 
    jobs, but police can't fight fire. If you have the right kind of military 
    base, the Emergency button may give you access to military troops to help 
    fight fires.

   FLOODS
    Floods occur in the wet season, and can be the byproducts of hurricanes, 
    tidal waves or tornadoes. They are most likely to occur on the coastline, 
    but occasionally a river will flood. There's not much you can do once a 
    flood begins, but you can prepare for the worst. Floods only destroy 
    things at sea level. Your buildings that are even one tile up will 
    weather the storm. Since seaports must be at sea level, they are prime 
    targets for flood damage. If you have a river, try building your 
    seaports upriver, away from the coast. You can also use the Raise 
    Terrain mode of the Bulldozer tool to build protective dikes in areas 
    that you think might flood. You can try deploying your police and fire 
    departments with the Emergency tool to help build dams to hold back 
    floods. You might lose a few civil servants, but it should slow the 
    advance of the flood.

   RIOTS
    The main causes of riots are heat, high crime and unemployment. Riots 
    can also occur if your city has a long blackout. A good economy and a 
    low crime rate are the best ways to prevent riots. And keep your power 
    going. You can fight riots with the Emergency button and your police 
    departments the same way you'd fight a fire with your fire departments. 
    Fires are byproducts of riots.

   AIR CRASHES
    Sometimes planes or helicopters crash. Other than a smashed building 
    here and there, the main danger from an air crash is fire. Put out the 
    fire as quickly as you can, then hold an investigation and call it pilot 
    error. If a plane crashed at the airport, fire the air traffic 
    controller.

Page 122  SimCity 2000 - Reference

   TORNADOES AND HURRICANES
    Tornadoes and hurricanes occur because of climatic conditions, and 
    cannot be prevented. Keep an eye on the weather reports of high winds in 
    the newspaper and you might receive enough warning to reinforce your 
    police and fire departments in time. While they are very different in 
    the real world, as far as their effect in SimCity 2000 goes, they are 
    pretty much the same, except that tornadoes cause a narrow path of 
    destruction and hurricanes can really mess up the place.

   EARTHQUAKES
    Once again, there's nothing you can do to prevent them. All you can do 
    is treat the symptoms - and those are many. Earthquakes not only shake 
    down buildings and damage your city's infrastructure (roads, rails, 
    power lines, etc.), but cause fires, looting and riots. All you gotta 
    do is put out the fires, restore power and transport, control the mobs 
    and rebuild your city.

   NUCLEAR MELTDOWN
    If you have a nuclear power plant, there is a slight chance that it will 
    melt down. If it does, your city is in real trouble. There will be a big 
    explosion, fires will break out, and radiation will spread and 
    contaminate the surrounding land and water. The radiation lasts many 
    generations. Neither you nor your Sims can build on contaminated ground.

    Don't confuse the end of your power plants' workable life span with a 
    disaster. Even though your nuclear plants will stop working and blow up 
    after 50 years, there is no danger, other than from blackouts or 
    brownouts. This is just the plant wearing out, not blowing up, melting 
    down or leaking.

    Fusion plants don't melt down and don't leak radiation, only
    fission (standard nuclear) plants.

Page 123  SimCity 2000 - Reference

   OOPS
    The microwave power plant has its accidents, too. On occasion, the beam 
    of energy from the satellite misses the collector dish and causes some 
    inconvenient death and destruction. There's nothing you can do to 
    prevent it, but put the fires out as soon as you can. Play it safe and 
    build microwave power plants out in the boonies.

   THE MONSTER
    The monster is an intelligent creature from outer space. But then again, 
    it might just be a Hollywood movie special effect run amok. Since we 
    seem incapable of communicating with it, we don't know if it is really 
    out to destroy our cities or if it just doesn't understand that we find 
    it unpleasant to be smashed, set on fire or whisked away to another 
    planet. The presence of certain military bases may deter the monster or 
    rush it on its way. Maybe if you could make it understand that its 
    behavior is antisocial, it will stop. But then again, maybe not.

   OTHERS
    There are a number of other disasters that will pop up from time to time 
    in SimCity 2000, but you'll find out all about them in your own good 
    time.
