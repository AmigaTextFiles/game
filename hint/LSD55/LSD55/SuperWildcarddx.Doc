                    motion. Each time you press the buttons, 
                    you slow down the game 1 level.

   the CHEAT CODE FINDER function.
   - this time, use CONTINUE SEARCH function
   - Now, the possibilities are reduced from the previous possi-
   bilities. IF you have only 1 or 2 possibilities, then you have
   found the code, if you still gave more possibilities, then 
   you will have to repeat this proceddure until only 1 or 2
   possibilities remain.
6. Now go back to the CHEAT CODE FINDER and use LIST CODE function
   to list possible codes. You can press SELECT to save this code 
   in the password function and press B to continue listing.

All your cheat codes can then be saved to a disk using the BACKUP
PASSWORD function for future play. Some games do not use the same
number that you have on the screen. For example, SUPER MARIO WORLD
the number of lives that you see on the screen is 5 but you have
to use 4 when searching for this. In some games, you might have to
add 1 to the nuber you see on the screen. It takes some practice 
and once you become familiar with this, you can finish all the
games before your friends and easily master any game you want to
try your luck with.
