INTRODUCTION

   Welcome to SimCity 2000.        
	
   When you play SimCity 2000, you become the planner, designer
   and mayor of an unlimited number of cities. You can take over and       
   run any of the included scenario cities, or build your own from the     
   ground up.
	
   You're in charge. You can choose to build small, rural towns, or        
   huge bustling megalopolises. As you design and build your cities,       
   simulated citizens, known as Sims, move in and build their homes,
   stores and workplaces, raise their families and invite their friends.   
   If your city is a nice place to live, your population will increase. If 
   it's not, your Sims will leave town. And be assured that they'll let    
   you know what they think about you and your policies.   
      
   One of the toughest challenges of SimCity 2000 is to maintain a 
   huge city without sacrificing your Sims' quality of life, without
   going broke maintaining the infrastructure, and without raising 
   taxes so high that businesses relocate. SimCity 2000 lets you face      
   the same dilemmas that mayors all over the world are facing.    
   We've all said at one time or another that we could do a better job
   than our elected officials-here's your chance to prove it.      
	
   SimCity 2000 is primarily a "building" game, where you create and       
   try to increase the size of your cities-but you also have plenty of
   opportunities to destroy. From bulldozers to earthquakes to air
   crashes, the implements of destruction are only a mouse-click
   away. But remember, it's a lot more challenging to build than to
   destroy, and the lives, hopes and dreams of millions of Sims are
   in your hands.

ABOUT THIS MANUAL

   This manual is divided into four main sections: 

   The Introduction welcomes you to SimCity 2000, explains a little 
   about the manual in general, helps you get the game up and
   running on your computer and sends you on your way to play.

   The Tutorials are small guided tours through different aspects of
   city-building with SimCity 2000.

   The Reference section describes in detail all the windows, but-
   tons, features and functions of SimCity 2000, and explains much
   the behind-the-scenes simulation action.

   The Gallery section consists of contributions from a number of
   people to give you varying views, feelings, interpretations and
   predictions about real cities in words and pictures. Some of these
   Individual pieces are located at the back of the manual in the
   "official" Gallery section. Others are spread throughout the rest of
   the manual.

   And for those who are familiar with an earlier version of SimCity,
   there is an Appendix that lists SimCity 2000's new features and
   differences from the earlier versions.

   In addition, the SimCity 2000 package includes a machine-specific
   Addendum to cover installation, startup, and any special features
   and functions on your computer.

Page 3  SimCity 2000 - Introduction

FROM SIMCITY TO SIMCITY 2000

   If you're already familiar with an earlier version of SimCity, then
   you should have no trouble moving into SimCity 2000.  If you
   haven't played SimCity before, then skip the rest of this section.
   You will not be quizzed on this material.

   A few major features have changed and some tools have moved
   since the earlier versions of the game, so you may have just a little          
   trouble finding things. A summary of all the changes and differ-
   ences between the programs can be found in the Appendix. But to
   help you get started, here are the three most-asked questions by
   SimCity users when we sat them down in front of SimCity 2000:

     Where the heck are the power plants?
   They're in a submenu under the power icon. Select Power Plant
   from the submenu and you'll have a choice of from three to nine
   different power sources, depending on the city's date.

     I click and click-why won't the durn thing set down zones?
   Instead of the fixed-size zones that you plop down, SimCity 2000
   lets you make any size square or rectangular zone by clicking and
   dragging the mouse where you want to zone. You can zone over
   roads and rails, and place roads and rails in zones. By the way,
   airports and seaports are placed the same way as zones. 

     What's the deal with the water system?    
   We've added a water system to the game, including pumps, pipes,
   treatment plants, water towers and desalinization plants.  You
   don't need to worry about water to start a city. But you will need
   a water system before the population can grow very dense.

GETTING STARTED

   SimCity 2000 must be installed toahard disk before it can be run.
   Please look in the machin&specific Addendum for complete in- 
   structions on installing SimCity 2000 to your hard disk and on
   starting the program.

   Once you're up and running, feel free to jump right in and play, or
   if you want some guidance and a quick introduction to the main
   features and functions of the game, check out the tutorials.

Page 4  SimCity 2000 - Introduction

Tutorials

   Congratulations! By the virtue of owning SimCity 2000 you are
   hereby proclaimed Mayor of a million cities and ruler of a billion
   simulated lives (your Sims).  It's a tough game, but somebody's
   gotta play it.  

   These tutorials are designed to help you adjust to your new office
   with as little transition time as possible.            
	
   There are three tutorials, each designed to be finished in one
   short sitting so you can get them out of the way and get on with
   the important business of building and running your cities. The
   first one is a general overview of the basic features of SimCity
   2000 enough so you can start a new city, and get going on your
   own. The second one focuses on creating, editing and modifying
   your city's terrain, both before and after you've begun building
   your city. The third one goes into detail on a few of the advanced
   features.
   
   We suggest that you whip through the first tutorial, then go play
   on your own for a while. You may figure everything else out on
   your own, and never need the other tutorials, but they're here if   
   and when you want them.      

Page 6  SimCity 2000 - Tutorial

BEFORE YOU BEGIN
  Mouse And Keyboard Stuff

   Before jumping into the tutorials, take a moment to look over the
   following skills and conventions that will make your stay in
   SimCity 2000 a pleasant one. 

   SimCity 2000 requires a mouse. To play, you must know how to    
   use a mouse for the following actions:

      Click-point the cursor to an object and briefly press the
      left (or only) mouse button.

      Doubleclick-point the cursor to an object and briefly
      press the left (or only) mouse button twice quickly.

      Click and drag-point the cursor to an object, then press
      and hold the left (or only) mouse button, then move the
      mouse to drag the object. Release the mouse button to
      release the object.

   Unless otherwise specified, whenever this manual refers to click-
   ing, doubleclicking or clicking and dragging, use the left (or only)
   mouse button.

   When you see the term "Shift-click," it means to hold down either
   Shift key on the keyboard and click the mouse button.

   When you see the term 'Option/Control-click," it means:

      On a Macintosh you should hold down the Option key on
      the keyboard while you click; or

      On a DOS or Windows-based computer you should hold
      down the Control key on the keyboard while you click.

Page 7  SimCity 2000 - Tutorial

INSTRUCTIONS AND EXPLANATIONS


   To prepare you for building your city in the rest of this tutorial
   here is a basic explanation of exactly what is city in SimCity 2000
   is made of.
	
   While SimCity has many layers of complexity and lots and lots of
   features and all sorts of stuff to put in your city, it's fairly easy to
   get a small city started. All you need is:
   
        A place for the Sims to live: a residential zone

        A place for the Sims to work: an industrial zone

        A place for the Sims to shop and conduct business: a commercial zone

        A source of power: a power plant

        A way to get the power from the power plant to the zones: power lines

        A way for Sims to travel between work, home or shops: roads

   That's all you need to build, and Sims with that pioneering spirit    
   will move into your city and build their own houses, factories and
   offices. They'll drive their cars and carry on business and com-
   plain about taxes. If you build it, they will simulate.

Page 8  SimCity 2000 - Tutorial


Once your city has begun to grow, you can add:

        More zones with different density levels

        Multiple above and below-ground means of transportation       

        A complete water system

        Custom landscaping

        Airports and seaports
	
        Police and fire stations

        Educational and recreational facilities

        A whole lot more

Enough talk ... time for a simulating experience.


Page 9  SimCity 2000 - Tutorial


TUTORIAL 1 - THE BASICS

   If you haven't already, take a look at your machine-specific   
   Addendum, and install SimCity 2000 to your hard drive.   

   Start SimCity 2000.     

   See your Addendum for instructions.    
	
   Either the first time you play the game or during installation, you     
   will be asked to enter your name to personalize your copy of
   SimCity 2000. Be sure to type your full name - and be polite
   because the name that you type in will appear a number of times
   and places in the game.

   Soon a list of four choices will appear; it's time for your first real 
   decision. Here you can load a city that you've already saved, start   
   a brand-new city, edit a new map (we'll be doing this in Tutorial 2),
   or play one of the pre-built scenarios. For this tutorial, we'll want  
   to start a new city.

   Click on Start New City.        

   In mere moments you'll see a dialog box that asks you to make 
   three decisions: how hard or easy you want your game to be, what    
   year the game should start, and what your new city should be
   named. The defaults are Easy and 1900, which will be just fine, so
   all we need to do is type in the name.

   Make sure the City Name is highlighted and type in: Tutorial 1 City.    

   Click on Done.
       Note: On the Macintosh or other computers that
       allow long file names, the city name you type here
       will also be your file name. On computers that
       run DOS or Windows, where file names must be
       shorter, you'll get to type in a file name when you
       save the city to disk.

Page 10  SimCity 2000 - Tutorial 

   Soon the founding of your city will be announced in the 
   newspaper. The newspaper is your tool for staying in touch   
   with your adoring SimConstituents.   

   Click on the headline. Read the story that zooms out. Click again.

   Open and eead the other stories if you like, by clicking on them.

   Click In the Close box In the upper-left comer of the Newspaper
   to send It to the recycling bin.

   You are now looking at the City window, where you will spend  
   most of your time as you build, run and rule your city. 

   At the top of the window is the Title bar. It contains the current city
   date, the city name, and the amount of money you have in your
   city treasury.

   Over on the left side of the screen is the City toolbar. It has lots of
   buttons-your tools for creating and running your city.

       Note: Every January, the Budget window will pop
       up. For now, just click on its Done button to make
       it go away. We'll worry about the budget later. If
       the Newspaper pops up, click on its close box.

Page 11  SimCity 2000 - Tutorial
   
   In the window itself you see the site of your city-to-be. A pristine
   wilderness: bare land, some forest areas and some flowing water.     
   And the land isn't flat-there are hills and valleys, peaks and
   canyons. The terrain is divided into tiny squares. Each of these       
   squares is called a "tile." Each tile is approximately one acre, or a
   200 x 200 foot square.

   We'll explore your new domain in a moment, but first, we need to
   take a detour and go straight to the top ... of your screen.    

   At the top of your screen is, of course, the Menu bar. These menus    
   are well-behaved and work just like the menus in your other     
   programs. Click and hold on the menu name to open the menu,
   slide the cursor to the menu item you want to activate, then    
   release the mouse button.

   Take a moment and open each of the menus, revealing their hidden
   glory. 
	
   Once you've looked them over: 
   
   Open the Options menu.
   Select Auto-Budget.     

   This option makes the simulation repeat the same budget until   
   you tell it otherwise and stops that pesky Budget window from   
   popping up and spoiling your view.     

   Open the Disasters menu.        
   Select No Disasters.  

   This setting keeps random disasters from occurring. (Those
   disasters really mess up a tutorial.)  

Page 12  SimCity 2000 - Tutorial

   And speaking of views, behold the vistas and valleys of your city-
   to-be. How'd you like another angle on the place?               

   Click on the Rotate CounterClockwise bullon in the City toolbar.

   Do It again.

   Click on the Rotate Clockwise button until you find the angle that
   pleases you.

   As you can see, you can rotate the city and view it from all sides.
   This'll come in very handy later, when you're building your city.
   What's that? You want a closer view? No problem.

   Click once on the Zoom In button in the City toolbar.

   How's that? Closer?

   Click again on the Zoom In button.

   That's as close as you get. (Notice that the Zoom In button is
   ghosted and unavailable.) Now that you're here, how do you get
   around? Let's zoom out for a wider view, then do some travelin'.

   Click once on the Zoom Out button.

   Click on the Center button.

   Click anywhere on the landscape.

   The landscape will redraw in the City window, centered on the
   spot where you clicked. You can also use the Scroll bars to move
   around the landscape, but the Center button gives you more
   precise control.


Page 13  SimCity 2000 - Tutorial


MAKE YOURSELF AT HOME

   Time to pick a spot to found your city. Since each landscape 
   generated by SimCity 2000 is different, the landscape on your   
   screen, and therefore the city that you build, won't look exactly
   like the one in this manual-but it should be close. Kinda. Sorta.
   Maybe. 
	
   Click on the Zoom Out button until you are as far out as you can get.

   Look for a nice, flat spot.

   If there is water nearby, or even running through your spot, all the
   better, but not necessary. If there is no spot in your city that you
   are willing to call home, then open the File menu, and select New
   City. You'll be asked if you want to save the old one - click No.
   Then a new landscape will be generated, and you'll get to name
   your city and all that other stuff you did a few pages ago. You can
   repeat this until you find a home.

   Once you're satisfied, then it's time to zone out.

   As mentioned in What Makes a (Sim)City above, we'll need three 
   kinds of zones in our city: residential, where the Sims live,   
   commercial, for offices and stores, and industrial, for factories.
   
   Survey your chosen territory and pick a spot to zone residential. If 
   there is water nearby, include some waterfront in your zone.
   
   Click on the Residential Zone button.
		
   Click and drag on the landscape to form a rectangle where you want to 
   make a residential zone.
   
   You can zone right over hills and trees.

Page 14  SimCity 2000 - Tutorial 

   Now find a spot for the industrial zone. It is in your Sims' best
   interest to leave a bit of a buffer zone between residential and
   industrial zones.

   Click on the Industrial Zone button.

   Click and drag on the landscape to form a rectangle where you want
   to make an Industrial zone.

   Now find a spot for a commercial zone. Close to residential is
   handy. Some waterfront is nice, but not necessary.

   Click on the Commerelal Zone button.

   Click and drag on the landscape to form a rectangle where you want
   to make a commercial zone.

Page 15  SimCity 2000 - Tutorial


POWER TO THE PEOPLE

   The Sims that live in SimCities may have that pioneering spirit, but   
   they won't move in until you supply electric power. After all, they     
   are electronic life-forms.     

   To supply power, you need a power plant of some sort and power  
   lines to get the power to where you want it. Both of these things       
   are available from the Power button in the City toolbar.

   Click and hold on the Power button in the City toolbar. 
		      
   Move the cursor to highlight Power Plant... and release the mouse
   button. 

   An assortment of power plants will appear, with pictures of, 
   prices for and outputs from each plant. There is also an INFO  
   button for each power plant that brings up even more fascinating  
   facts. Power plants are not available to you until the city year   
   reaches the time when that technology is available. 
   words, you can't have nuclear fusion in 1901.
			
   Click on the Coal Power Plant.
			
   The power plant assortment will disappear, and a grey 4 x 4 tile 
   shadow will follow the cursor. This is the size of the base of the
   power plant. Find a plac~preferably near your industrial zone   
   and far from your residential zon~to place the power plant. It
   must be placed on flat ground. 
		      
   Click on the terraIn to place your power plant.

Page 16  SimCity 2000 - Tutorial

I'VE GOT A LINE ON YOU

   Now we need to power up the zones. We'll need power lines to get   
   the power from the power plant to each zone. Power won't travel
   from zone to zone without power lines, even if they're touching.       
   Within zones, the building-to-building power lines are built by the
   Sims when they build their buildings. (But that's a private sector
   problem-you only have to power up each zone.)

   Placing power lines can be a bit tricky, so it's best to zoom in as
   close as you can get.

   Click on the Center button.

   Click on your power plant.

   Click on the Zoom In button until you are as close as you can get.

   Click and hold on the Power button in the City toolbar.

   Move the cursor to highlight Power Lines and release the mouse
   button.

   You're ready to lay some power lines.

   Click or click and drag to place power lines that connect the power
   plant to each of your zones.

   If you place power lines that aren't connected to power, they'll
   blink to indicate that they aren't hooked up yet. If your power lines
   flash, then you've missed a connection. You may have to rotate
   the terrain to get a good look at your power plant from all sides.

       Note:   Laying power lines in hilly areas can be
       tricky. You may have to rotate the landscape and
       zoom in for a good close look. Try to stay on flat
       land for this tutorial

Page 17  SimCity 2000 - Tutorial


THE DRIVE TO THRIVE

   Now all we need is a transportation system, and your town should     
   be ready for some Sims to move in.  


   Click on the Road bulton in the Cily toolbar.   out.

   Click and drag through and around your zones to set up a network of  
   roads.
	       
   By the time you get your roads down, some Sims should be  
   moving into your town.  
	
   Power cannot travel through roads without wires, so place power 
   lines across the roads to make sure each section of every zone has
   power. 
		
   Click and hold on the Power button and select Power Lines again. 
   
   Place power lines across the roads to connect all parts of each zone.   

   Now sit patiently for a few minutes as your city slowly begins to     
   grow.  
	  
       Note: If nobody moves into your city, then it's    
       either because the zones aren't powered up, or      
       the residential and industrial zones are too far     
       apart. Sims like to drive their cars, but they hate
       to commute very far.

YOUR JUST DESSERTS        

   Your city should be growing now. Go ahead and add some more   
   zones, or play with roads to get in some practice. Fairly soon a     
   newspaper will announce to the world that your little town has  
   reached the lofty population of 2000, and as a reward, you may
   build yourself a house.

       Note:   if you don't get this message after 5 or 7
       minutes, then you may not have made your zones
       large enough.

Page 18  SimCity 2000 - Tutorial

   This is but the first of many rewards that you will reap as mayor
   of SimCity. Rewards are based on population, and include your
   own house, a city hall, a statue in your honor and ... well, you'll find
   out.

   Rewards show up under the Reward button in the City toolbar,
   which is ghosted and unavailable most of the time. Once you
   reach the population of 2000, then the Reward button will no
   longer be ghosted.

   Click and hold on the Reward button, slide the cursor to Mayor's
   House and release the mouse button.

   Place your house In a prestigious spot, preferably with a good view.

   Connect your house to the rest of the town with roads and power lines.

   Congratulations. You've successfully taken a hunk of barren dirt and 
   built a small city. But this is no time to rest on your laurels. For 
   now, save your city to disk, then we'll move on.

   Open the file menu.

   Select Save City.

   Depending on your computer, it will either go ahead and save
   without asking you any questions, or prompt you for a location
   and file name. See your machin&specific Addendum for details on
   saving files and file names.

Page 19  SimCity 2000 - Tutorial

BELLY ON UP TO THE [TOOL]BAR
	
   Let's take a quick look at the City toolbar. If it ever gets in your way        The bull
   you can move it around the screen by clicking and dragging the  
   bar at the top. 

   An important-and useful-thing to remember is the built-in     
   help. Aust hold down either Shift key, and click on any button in the
   toolbar for a complete explanation of what the button does.     
					
   All of the buttons in the top five rows activate submenus that give the 
   button more power and flexibility. You've already seen that with the
   Power button.
   
   Click and hold on all the buttons in the top five  
   rows, one by one, to see all their submenus.
	
   Two of the buttons will not do anything: the Reward button and the 
   Emergency button. The Emergency button, which lets you dispatch
   police and fire departments to the scene of an emergency, only works 
   during an emergency. And as you already know, the Reward button      
   only lights up as you reach certain population levels.

   Seeing all those submenus should assure you that there's a lot more to 
   mastering SimCity 2000 than building a town of 2000 people. Many of these 
   features will be covered in Tutorial 3, but there are a few items that 
   will prove useful to you right away: the bulldozer, landscaping and 
   building bridges.

Page 20  SimCity 2000 - Tutorial

DOIN' SOME DOZIN'

   The bulldozer has a number of uses, but for now we'll concentrate
   its Demolish/Clear function.

   Click and hold on the Bulldozer button.

   Highlight Demolish/Clear.

   Now go on a rampage through your city. Bulldoze any extra      
   sections of road, abandoned factories or anything else you'd care               
   to eliminate. (Don't worry, the city has been saved to disk, you can     
   undo any damage you do by loading it back in.)        

   The first time you 'doze something, it turns it to rubble (with quite
   a jolly explosion). 'Doze it again to clear the rubble.

   The Landscape button lets you add trees or water to the land-  
   scape. Click and hold on the Landscape button.  

   Highlight Trees and release the mouse button.

   Click or click and drag across the land to add trees.  

   Trees add value to land as well as an aesthetic touch to your
   creation. Now for water.

   Click and hold on the Landscape button. 
   HighlIght Water and release the mouse button.
   Click or click and drag across the land to make a small lake - but keep
   it small, adding water is expensive.

   Water also adds value to land, and has recreational value, too.

Page 21  SimCity 2000 - Tutorial

A LITTLE BRIDGEWORK
   
   And speaking of water, how do you make your roads cross it?

   Locate and center the screen on a lake or river that has flat land  
   surrounding it.

   Click on the Road button.

   Click and drag the cursor so it crosses the lake or river.      

   Just by laying a road over water, the SimConstruction crew knows
   that you need a bridge. So they pop up this dialog box to let you 
   decide what kind of bridge you want and tell you how much it'll 
   cost. There is also an Info button you can press for more informa-     
   tion on each type of bridge. Depending on the year in your city,
   and the width of the water, you will be shown a choice of one, two
   or three different bridges you can build. For now, go ahead and 
   build a causeway bridge.   

   Click on the Causeway bullon to build the bridge.      
   
   The causeway is only one of the three types of bridges that you 
   can have in SimCity 2000. Let's build another one, or two if they are
   all available.

   Click and drag across the water next to the causeway. 

   When given the choice of bridges, build a raising bridge, if it is
   available.  

   Now build a suspension bridge if it is available.

Page 22  SimCity 2000 - Tutorial

   A handy-dandy feature of SimCity 2000 is the ability to add signs to 
   buildings or spots of interest in your city.

   Click on the Sign button.

   Click on one of the bridges you just built.

   Type "Orthodontist's Dream" into the dialog box. 
   
   Click the Done button.


   At the bottom of the City toolbar are six buttons. The one with the    
   question mark brings up a reminder that you can get help on each
   button of the toolbar by holding down the Shift key and clicking on
   the button.     

   To the left of the help button is the Underground button. Clicking   
   on it reveals SimCity's soft white underbelly, where you can build
   an underground transportation system and run water to all your
   city's buildings. Clicking on it again takes you back up to the
   surface.

   The four buttons above Help and Underground are Show Buildings,
   Show Signs, Show Infrastructure and Show Zones. Each of these
   buttons toggles on and off different parts of the city. The parts
   aren't destroyed, theyjust turn invisible until you want to see them
   again.

   Zoom out, center on the built-up part of your city and play with the four
   Show buttons, the Underground button and the Help button forawhile.

   Hang in there. We're almost done with Tutorial 1!

Page 23  SimCity 2000 - Tutorial

YOU'RE IN DEMAND        

   Now take a look at the City toolbar and pick out the and Indicator. This 
   lets you know what type of zones are in demand in your city. The bars 
   stick up to show demand and down to show oversupply for Residential,     
   commercial and Industrial zones.        

WHAT A PANE   
   
   To the left of the Demand Indicator are six buttons. Each of these      
   buttons opens small information windows that sit on top of the 
   City window. The information in these windows helps you under   
   stand what's going on in your city, and helps you keep things  
   running smoothly. Some of them will be covered in Tutorial 3. All      
   of them are explained in detail in the Reference section.    

   Most of these buttons (all but the one with the money sign) work  
   in two ways:   

   1. Click and hold on them to see a small pop-up information
      display that disappears when you let go of the mouse button. 

   2. Click and drag them away from the toolbar to open a window that stays 
      until you tell it to go away.

   One at a time, click and hold on each of the six buttons, take a quick
   look at what comes up, then release the mouse button. (Note that the
   Budget window stays there unless you click the Done button.)

   One at a time, click and drag each of the six buttons to open all the
   windows.

   Close all the windows.

   Well, that's it for Tutorial 1. When you're ready for more, check out
   the next two tutorials. And the Reference section is always there
   when you need it for details on every window, toolbar and button.
   Now go play.

   Play.
   
   Have fun.

   Have more fun.

Page 24  SimCity 2000 - Tutorial

   Welcome back. In this tutorial, we'll be modifying and customizing   
   the landforms that you build your cities on.

   In the last tutorial we touched on adding trees and water with the
   Landscape button, and looked at the submenu under the Bull-
   dozer button. These are powerful tools for molding, shaping and 
   beautifying the land. But if you make drastic changes, it can drain
   your city's treasury.

   All the time you spent in Tutorial 1 was in "City-Building mode." As
   an alternative, SimCity 2000 has a "Terrain-Editing mode" that
   allows you to make all the modifications to the land you want - at
   no charge - before you actually start your city. When you've
   created the perfect locale for a new town, you can switch to City
   mode and start building. But you can't switch back. Sorry, them's
   the rules.

   Enough gabbing. Put on your work boots and grab your hard
   hat-we've got mountains to move.

TUTORIAL 2 - LANDSCAPE ENGINEERING

   Welcome back. In this tutorial, we'll be modifying and customizing   
   the landforms that you build your cities on.

   In the last tutorial we touched on adding trees and water with the
   Landscape button, and looked at the submenu under the Bull-
   dozer button. These are powerful tools for molding, shaping and 
   beautifying the land. But if you make drastic changes, it can drain
   your city's treasury.

   All the time you spent in Tutorial 1 was in "City-Building mode." As

   created the perfect locale for a new town, you can switch to City

   the rules.

   Enough gabbing. Put on your work boots and grab your hard
   hat - we've got mountains to move.


Page 25  SimCity 2000 - Tutorial


IN THE MODE

   First, we'll get into Terrain-Editing mode.

   If SimCity 2000 isn't running now, start it up. You'll soon see this
   dialog box:    
   
   Click Edit New Map.   
	
   If SimCity 2000 is already running, and you've been playing for a   
   while, save whatever you're working on (if you wish) and: 

   Click on the Zoom Out button until you are all the way out.  

   Open the File menu.     
   
   Select Edit New Map.  

   This is the same old City window as in Tutorial 1, but  
   with a big difference - this time we're in Terrain mode, 
   and the City toolbar has been replaced by the Terrain  
   tool bar.      

   Near the bottom of the toolbar are six buttons that you are already 
   familiar with. The Zoom In, Zoom Out, Rotate, Center and Help buttons 
   work here exactly as they do in the City toolbar.                  
			
   And, of course, if you ever need a reminder of what a button does, hold 
   down either Shift key and click on the button.


Page 26  SimCity 2000 - Tutorial

MY GENERATION

   The top section of the Terrain toolbar gives you a good head start  
   on reaching that perfect landform by letting you select some
   general characteristics that you want, then generating the land to
   your specifications. Once generated, you can customize it to your
   heart's content.

   The Coast button lets you choose to (or not to) have an ocean
   coastline along one side of your city.

   The River button lets you choose whether or not a river runs
   through it.

   The three slider bars let you set how much of the land you want
   to be covered by mountains, water and trees. To set the slider
   bars, you can either click and drag them or just click at your
   desired setting. The higher the bar, the more mountain, water and
   tree coverage.

   When you've finished with the Coast and River buttons and the
   sliders, clicking on the Make button generates the new landform.

   To test it out, try generating landforms with each of theses settings:

   Set the buttons and sliders to match example one, to the right
   
   Click on the Make button.
   
   Look over the landscape.  

   Repeat for the other two examples.   

   With the two buttons and three sliders you can create an almost
   unlimited number of Iandforms. Play around with generating
   landforms for a while if you wish, then generate the landform from
   example 3.


Page 27  SimCity 2000 - Tutorial


DID THE EARTH MOVE FOR YOU, TOO?

   You should be looking at something approximately like this:

      ( INSERT K3WL PICTURE HERE!!  - D.L. )

       Note: As you go through the rest of this tutorial, feel free to zoom 
       in for a closer look and rotate to get a different angle on your 
       creation. You already know how to do it, so I won't bore you with 
       the details.

   Look over the terrain and pick a nice, big, flat, boring spot. We'll
   use the Raise Terrain tool to give it a lift.

   Click on the Ralse Terrain button.

   Click and drag on a flat spot of land to build a huge mountaln.

MAKING MOLEHILLS OUT OF MOUNTAINS   
   
   Well, maybe that mountain is a bit too high for this flat, prairie-like 
   wilderness. Let's bring it down with the Lower Terrain tool.
   
   Click on the Lower Terrain button.

   Trim the mountaln down to size, but not too small.

Page 28  SimCity 2000 - Tutorial


ON THE LEVEL

   Sometimes you need to flatten out the top of a mountain and form 
   terraces to make some usable, level space. That's where the Level
   Terrain tool comes in.

       Note: If you don 't have enough of your mountain left after lowering it, 
       use the Raise Terrain tool to build it back up again.

   Click on the Level Terrain button.

   Click and hold somewhere on your mountaln near - but not at - the top.

   Drag the cursor across the top of the mountaln to chop it off.

   You probably noticed that the Level Terrain tool raises land to
   your chosen level as well as lowers it. Now make some terraces on
   your mountain.

   When you do a lot of terrain modifications, you will sometimes see
   grey triangular areas. These are actually cement supports to keep
   the land from shifting or caving in. SimConstruction engineers are
   trained professionals who know how to do their jobs.


Page 29  SimCity 2000 - Tutorial


A BIT OF A STRETCH

   The Stretch Terrain tool lets you grab a section of land and  
   stretch it up into a mountain or pull it down to a mesa or canyon.

   Locate a flat, empty section of land.

   Click on the Stretch Terrain tool.
   
   Click and hold on the land, drag it upwards to create a pyramid-like  
   mountain, and release the mouse button.
	
   Click on the top of the mountaln and drag it down to flatten it into a
   mesa.
	
   Click and hold on the side of the mountaln and drag the cursor down 
   to carve out a canyon.

Page 30  SimCity 2000 - Tutorial  


WATER YOU THINKIN' ABOUT?

   Enough of this dealing with dirt-let's get wet. There are a few 
   water tools in the Terrain toolbar. One works just like the Water 
   setting on the Landscape button in the City toolbar. The other is    
   a little more powerful-and little more unpredictable. It lets you
   place flowing streams.

   Find or build a small hill somewhere In the terrain.

   Click on the Water button.

   Click and drag on the flat terrain at the foot of the hill.

   Click on the Place Stream button.      
   
   Click at the top of the hill to send a stream running down into the lake.
   
   Click a few more times In the same area to produce a cascading
   waterfall.

   There are also buttons that let you raise and lower sea level.
   
   Click on the Zoom Out button until you are all the way out.
   
   Click once on the Raise Sea Level button.

   Click twice on the Lower Sea Level button.

   Click again on the Ralse Sea Level button.

   These buttons let you turn mountains into a chain of islands, turn
   wet grassland into a desert, or create swampland if you know any
   rich suckers.

Page 31  SimCity 2000 - Tutorial  


OUT IN THE WOODS
   SimCity 2000 lets you add trees and forests to your landscape, 
   with (of all things) the Tree and Forest buttons.      
	
   Find a spot in the terrain that is sadly lacking trees.       
   
   Click on the Tree button.

   Click and drag across the barren plaln to plant some trees. 
   
   Click on the Forest button.    

   Click and drag across the plain to plant a lot of trees.

CITY A LA MODE

   You are now the master of land, sea and forest, able to shape them   
   to suit your whims. If you wish, take some time and play around
   with the landscape. When you're ready to get a city going, then 
   head for the Done button at the bottom of the Terrain toolbar. It    
   sends you into City mode, changes the toolbar, and starts time in
   the city.      
			
   Click Done and start building a city.
   
   You'll find the Raise Terrain, Lower Terrain and Level Terrain
   functions in the submenu under the Bulldozer button. But remem-
   ber: in City mode, you'll be charged for each tile you raise, lower   
   or level.
			
   If and when you feel like it, Tutorial 3 is just around the corner,             type of £
   filled with useful advanced city-building techniques.         


Page 32  SimCity 2000 - Tutorial


TUTORIAL 3 - ADVANCED FEATURES

   If you're here then you must already be an experienced mayor 
   with complete mastery of all the tools and techniques in Tutorials
   1 and 2. Either that or you're so excited about the advanced
   features of SimCity 2000 that you just couldn't wait.

   In any event, in this tutorial, you will:     
  
         Load in your old city from Tutorial 1.
   
         Take a look around with the Query tool.
   
         Add police and fire protection.
       
         Take a quick look at all the smaller windows and get an idea
	 of what they do.

         Play with the Budget window and city finance.
      
         Make a couple political deals in the Council window.

         Deal with an emergency.

A NEW BEGINING   
   
   If SimCity 2000 isn't running now, start it up. You'll soon see this 
   dialog box:
     
   Click Load Saved City.

   Load your city from the end of Tutorial 1.   

   If SimCity 2000 is already running, and you've been playing for a  
   while, save whatever you're working on (if you wish) and:

   Open the File menu.
   
   Select Load City.
   
   Load your city from the end of Tutorial 1.

       Note: Loading cities is a little different for each type of computer. 
       See your machine-specific Addendum for details.

Page 33  SimCity 2000 - Tutorial

   Within seconds, you will be looking over the familiar landscape of  
   Tutorial 1 City. Before moving on, let's do a couple things: turn on  
   and hold on the City Services button in the City toolbar.     

   Select Police from the submenu. 
	
   Place the police station somewhere in your city.   

   Click and hold on the City Services button again.  
   
   Select Fire Station from the submenu.     Notice the Rer

   Place a fire station somewhere in your city, possibly near  
   police station.

   Make sure the stations have power and access to roads.

THE QUERY THEORY

   Inquiring mayors want and need to know what's going on in their
   towns. And whether you need to research important city issues or
   are just curious, the Query tool gives you the low-down on your
   city.

   Click on the Query button in the City toolbar.

   Click on a house in your residential zone.


   An information box has popped up with all the vital stats the simulator 
   has about the spot where you clicked.

Page 34  SimCity 2000 - Tutorial 
   
   Click on the Information box to close it.
   
   Click on your police station.   
   
   Once again an information box has opened, but this time with different 
   information - information that is important in judging the effectiveness
   of a police station. Whenever you query a place in your city, you will 
   see the most useful information for that place. Pay attention to the 
   numbers of officers, crimes and arrests in this box, and scribble them 
   down on a piece of paper if you have one handy. Later on we'll see what 
   cutting the police budget does to these numbers.

   Notice the Rename button. SimCity 2000 allows you to personalize
   your city by renaming many of the buildings and locations.

   Click on the Rename button.
   
   Type In your own name for your police department, something like,
   "Tutorial Enforcement Unit," or "Sims In Blue."
   
   Click the Done button.

Page 35  SimCity 2000 - Tutorial 


THE WHIRLWIND[OW]

   Other than a brief glimpse at the other windows in Tutorial 1,
   we've spent almost the whole time in the City window. The City  
   window is the mainstay of SimCity 2000. It stays active even when  
   other windows are open on top of it. Clicking on the City window       
   won't bring it to the front, covering any of the other, smaller 
   windows on the screen. When you place the other windows, try  
   not to cover the City window's Scroll bars.     

   After the City window, the Map window is the most-used and most
   versatile.     

   Click and drag the Map window button in the City toolbar away from  
   the toolbar to open the Map window.    

   Click In the Grow box in the upper right corner to enlarge the Map     
   window.

   Welcome to the Map window. It shows a number of different map displays 
   that give you location-based information about your city. You can open it 
   either through the Windows menu  or with the Map window button in the  
   City toolbar.
   
   Somewhere on the map is a white rectangle. The rectangle shows the area 
   of the map that is currently visible in the City window. When you click      
   on the map, you move the rectangle, and the city window redraws to show 
   the new area in the rectangle.     

   Click on the map a few times to move the rectangle, and see how the City 
   window changes.   

   Click on the map, over the middle of your city.

   The buttons along the left side of the Map window let you choose
   different map displays. Some of the buttons have submenus for
   even more displays. Let's take a quick look at all the map displays.


Page 36  SimCity 2000 - Tutorial 

       Note: In map displays that show density or coverage, the darker the 
       greyscale, the higher the density.

   Click and hold on the top Map window button.

   Select the first Item In the submenu and release the mouse button. Take
   a look at the map.

   Repeat for every item of every submenu of every Map window
   button - except the very last button. (Don't worry, it won't take very
   long; some of the buttons don't have submenus.)

   The last Map window button doesn't change the view in the Map
   window-it turns the City window into a super-duper-extra-large
   map. (This is the City window's Map mode.) Clicking the button
   again returns the City window to its normal state. Sometimes you
   need a huge, detailed map to see all the finer details of your city.

   Click on the last Map window button.

   Take a look, then click on it agaln.

   Click in the Close box to close the Map window.

   The Graphs window shows time-based information about the people, places 
   and problems in your city. Use it for identifying and tracking trends and 
   changes in things like pollution, land value, and levels of health and 
   education. You can open it from the Windows menu or by clicking and 
   dragging the Graphs window button in the City toolbar.

   Click and drag the Graphs window button on the City toolbar to open the 
   Graphs window.

   Spend 2 minutes and 37 seconds turning on and off each of
   the graphs, and changing the scale Irom 1 to 10 to 100 years.

   Close the Graphs window.

Page 37  SimCity 2000 - Tutorial 

   The Population window gives you information about the people    
   in your city, and their levels of health and education. You can open   
   the Population window in the usual ways.       
  
   Click and drag the Population window button on the City toolbar. 

   Click on each of the three buttons at the bottom of the window and
   look at each of the three displays.    

   Close the Population window.   

   The Industries window shows the ratio of the different types of industries 
   in your city. It also shows which industries' products are in demand 
   nationally, and allow you to set different tax rates for each industry to 
   encourage, discourage, or drain dry those industries like, don't like or 
   just want to exploit. You can open the Industries window by... you know 
   the rotine by now.                
   
   Click and drag the Industries window button in the City toolbar.                         monthly
	
   Look over the current (Population) display. 

   Click on the Tax Rates button.


Page 38  SimCity 2000 - Tutorial

   Pick an industry you want to encourage, and lower its tax rate by
   clicking and dragging its bar toward the left.

   Pick an industry you want to discourage, and raise its tax rate by
   clicking and dragging its bar toward the right.

   Click on the Demand button and look over the Demand display.

   Close the Industries window.

   The Neighbors window shows your city surrounded by its neigh-
   boring cities, and gives the populations for each city, and for
   SimNation as a whole. I bet you can figure out how the Neighbors
   window is opened.

   Open the Windows menu and select Neighbors (unless you really
   really want to use the Neighbors window button).

   Take a look and close the window.      

   The Budget window is where you control all the finances of your
   city. The  Budget window is so important that it deserves its own           
   clever headline in this tutorial, so here goes:

THE BUCK STARTS HERE

   Click on the Budget window button in the City toolbar.  

   Along the left side of the Budget window is a list of all the revenues
   and expenses that you face as a mayor in SimCity 2000. For each
   revenue or expense, there is:

         Year-to-Date Column - a number (in blue) that shows the actual 
	 cash amount you have made or spent so far this year.

         Estimated Column - a number (in red) that shows what the 
	 end-of-year expense or revenue will be at the current Budget 
	 window settings.

         Books - a button to push to see a detailed monthly report on the 
	 revenue or expense.

         Advisors - a button to push when you want a little advice.

Page 39  SimCity 2000 - Tutorial

         Percentages - most (but not all) of the revenues and expenses have 
	 a percentage setting so you can set the amounts of funding or 
	 taxation.     
	
   Help is available by holding down either Shift key and clicking on 
   any word, number, column or button in the Budget window.        

   The very first revenue is your main source of income: property     
   taxes. To the right of the words "Property Taxes" is the current tax
   rate given as a percentage (currently 7%). You can set the property tax 
   rate to anything between 0 and 20% by clicking on the up and down arrows 
   to the right of the percentage number. Give your Sims a break and lower 
   their taxes.

   Click twice on the down-arrow to the right of Property Taxes and lower    
   the rate to 5%.

   If your computer is equipped to play sound effects, you'll hear the       
   cheers of the populace.        

   Click once on the up-arrow to the right of Property Taxes and raise the   
   rate to 6%.

   Once again, if your computer can play sound effects, you'll hear     
   the reaction of the masses. How soon they forget.   
	
   Skip down to Bond Payment. This is the amount of interest you  
   pay on bond issues. Part of financing your city is issuing bonds,
   which is basically borrowing money from your citizens. The     
   interest rate the city pays varies according to the simulated
   market and the difficulty level of the game. Everything you need  
   to deal with bonds is in the Bond Payment books.       

Page 40  SimCity 2000 - Tutorial

   Click on the Book button for Bond Payment.

   The bond Payment books give you a month-by-month breakdown of the number 
   of outstanding bonds, their interest rate, the monetary amount of 
   interest  you pay and a total of interest paid. Blue numbers show actual 
   year-to-date amounts, red numbers are projections for the rest of the 
   year.
   
   At the bottom of the window are buttons for dealing with bond issues.

   Click on the Show Bonds button.
	
   You are shown a pop-up box with your city's credit rating, and general 
   status on bonds and interest rates.

   Click on the pop-up box to close it.

   Click on the Issue Bond button.

   You are given the current bond interest rate and asked if you want to
   issue the bond.  Go ahead. 

   Click Yes to issue the bond.  
   
   Click on the Show Bonds button to see that it has been issued.

   Click to close the Show Bonds box.

   Later, when you have the money, you can come back here and repay the bond,    
   but for now, let's move on.

   Click the Done button to close the Bond Payment books and return to
   the budget window.

   Look at the line just below Bond Payment. This is the financial 
   information for your Police Departments. To the right of the words 
   "Police Department" is a percentage number set to 100, and to the right 
   of that are up- and down-arrows that let you change the level of funding.

Page 41  SimCity 2000 - Tutorial

   Click on the down-arrow to change the Police Department funding to
   50%.
	
   Click on the Police Department Book button.     

   Look it over, then click to close the Police books.     
	
   We'll check out the effect of lowering the police budget a little later. 
   There are no other buttons or adjustments in the Police books.

   Let's look at another set of books.     
	
   Click on the Transit Authority Book button.                   
   
   Not only do the Transit Authority books give you a monthly breakdown of 
   transit expenses, but they let you individually set the funding levels 
   for different transportation systems. Since the bridges we built in
   Tuto lI 1 aren't hooked up to anything  there's no point in funding them. 
   And just to see what happens, we'll remove funding from a couple other 
   systems.     
   
   Click on the down-arrow for Bridge funding until it goes to 0%.
	
   Set funding levels for Subway and Tunnel to 0%.           

   Click Done to close the Transit Authority books and return to the Budget 
   window.

   Notice that the percentage setting next to Transit Authority changed.
   When you change settings in the books, they are reflected here.
	
   One more set of books to inspect: City Ordinance (just under Property 
   Taxes).      

Page 42  SimCity 2000 - Tutorial

   Click on the City Ordinance Book button.


   These are various programs, bills and ordinances that you can enact as 
   mayor. Each program contributes in some way to the quality of life in
   your city, but each also has a drawback, usually its cost. Politics is a 
   rough business, filled with hard decisions.

   That's it for the Budget window - except for one detail. Let's clear out 
   all this budget stuff then see how our funding change affected the police 
   department.

   Click Done to close the Community Program dialog.

   Click Done to close the Budget window.

   Click on the Query button in the City toolbar.

   Click on the Police Department.

   When you compare it with your last query, you should have about half 
   as many officers. Depending on the size of your city, crime may be running 
   rampant, or it may be under control.  In a very small town, you don't 
   necessarily need full police or fire department funding.
   
   And speaking of fire departments...

A HOT TIME IN OLD TOWN   
   
   From time to time, or when you feel like it, you will have the solemn    
   duty (or distinct pleasure, depending on your personality) of dealing 
   with disasters. Of course, the best way to deal with a disaster is to 
   prevent it. The better fire coverage you have, the less fires will occur. 
   But sometimes, no matter how prepared you are, disaster strikes. 
   Especially when you choose them from a menu.

Page 43  SimCity 2000 - Tutorial
   
   Open the Disasters menu.        

   Select Fire.

   Once you select Fire, two things will happen: a fire will break out
   somewhere in the city limits and the Emergency button will become 
   available. The Emergency tool lets you dispatch your police and fire 
   departments to the scene of the emergency.

   Click and hold on the Emergency button in the City toolbar.

   Select Dispatch Fire.

   Click near the fire.

   Click and hold on the Emergency button.

   Select Dispatch Police.

   Click near the fire.

       Note: If the fire went out before you had a chance
       to dispatch your troops, start another one.

   You can't place your fire fighters directly on fires, but you can use
   them to block the path of the fire, and even chase it down. You can
   place one police or fire icon for every station you have. If you have
   three of four stations, it makes it easier to surround a fire and
   block its path. 

GRADUATION
   
   You have completed an extensive tutorial in city design and
   management. You are now an expert in everything from planning
   to landscaping to politics.

   When you're ready for even more advanced features, check out
   the Reference section for tips on adding a water system to you
   city, and improving and expanding your transportation system
   with highways, onramps, tunnels, rails, subways, and bus lines.

   Go forth and play SimCity 2000.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++[<*| REFERENCE |*>]++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

   This Reference section is an in-depth explanation of (just about)
   every window, button, feature and function of SimCity 2000 on a
   number of different computers. This section will make a lot more  
   sense to you if you play through Tutorial 1 first.    

THE BASICS

   Here are a few basic points that should clarify your place in the
   SimCity 2000 universe and prepare you for the rest of the Reference 
   section.

WHERE ARE YOU AND WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

   In SimCity 2000 you are the planner and mayor of an unlimited number of 
   cities. These cities can be as small as you want or as large as you can 
   make them.
   
   Your cities don't live in a vacuum. Their growth and decline are
   affected by surrounding cities. These surrounding cities are both
   a market for selling your manufactured goods and competitors,
   vying for population and businesses.    
			
   In your role as mayor, you are directly responsible for:        
      
         Planning - zoning, long- and short-range strategies

         City infrastructure - water, power, transportation       

         Government services - fire, police, hospitals, prisons  
      
         Education - schools, colleges, libraries, museums       

         Recreation and open spaces - parks, zoos, stadiums, marinas
      
         City budget and taxes
      
         Major and minor land manipulation

         The health, wealth and happiness of the Sims that live in your city


   You are not directly responsible for building houses, stores, factories 
   or other buildings (the Sims take care of them).

Page 46  SimCity 2000 - Reference
   
SCENARIOS AND CITIES   

   There are a number of scenarios built into to SimCity 2000. Each
   scenario provides you with different challenges at different levels
   of difficulty.

   Each scenario has a "win" condition. If you meet this condition within
   a specific time, you'll receive the key to the city and be allowed to 
   continue your job as mayor. If you don't meet the condition, you'll be
   run out of town - until you're ready to try again.

   When you start your own city, there are no time limits to beat and
   no conditions to meet. There is no winning or losing. You are the
   judge, passing judgment upon yourself. The only two criteria
   in this judgment are your own enjoyment and the quality of life of
   your Sims.

SIMCITY 2000 ON DIFFERENT COMPUTERS

   Each computer platform has its own rules and conventions for
   terminology, menu use, keyboard use, mouse use, file loading and
   saving, and windowing. We have kept SimCity 2000 as consistent  
   from computer to computer as we could while staying true to each
   computer's interface. In those few places where things differ
   greatly from computer to computer, you will be referred to the
   machine-specific Addendum.

   The graphics for this manual were taken from the Macintosh
   version of SimCity 2000. If there are any differences between the
   graphics in the manual and the graphics on your screen, see the
   machine-specific Addendum.

Page 47  SimCity 2000 - Reference

MOUSE AND KEYBOARD CONVENTIONS

   In general, all instructions that refer to clicking, doubleclicking or
   clicking and dragging refer to the left mouse button (if you have more 
   than one). 

   Things that are done on the Mac by holding down the Option key while 
   clicking, are done on DOS- and Windows-based computers by holding down 
   the Control key and clicking.  

GETTING HELP

   Help is available in most places in SimCity 2000. lf you see a button    
   with a question mark on it, click on it for help.       

   If you have a mouse with more than one button, clicking with the
   right button on any button or icon will invoke a help message  
   explaining that button or icon. If you have a mouse with one    
   button, hold down either Shift key on your keyboard and click on any 
   button or icon for help.

   Terrain in SimCity 2000 has 32 levels of altitude, with mountains,
   valleys, lakes, rivers, streams, and waterfalls. You can customize   
   and modify the landform, both at the beginning of a game and during 
   actual city-building.    
	
   When you start a brand-new city with the Edit New Map command from the 
   File menu, you can mold and shape the terrain for your city as much as 
   you want, without any charge. Once you start playing a game and begin 
   building a city, it will cost you to modify the terrain.  

   The land is divided up into "tiles." A tile is the smallest piece of
   land that can be raised, lowered or covered with water. It is 
   approximately 200 by 200 feet square, or about one acre.  

   The total city limits are equivalent to approximately 5 miles by 5 
   miles square. Buildings, objects, roads, etc., are also divided up into 
   tiles. One section of road is one tile. Some of the larger buildings are 
   made of many tiles.

Page 48  SimCity 2000 - Reference

   The entire city limits is yours for city expansion, for parks and
   open spaces, or to leave wild. A city in SimCity 2000 can be tiny,
   or fill the entire rectangular city limits.

   You can build multiple separate communities or small cities but the 
   simulation will treat them as one city. All the statistics and 
   information in the Graphs, Population, industry and other windows 
   collectively covers everything within the entire city limits.

THE CITY WINDOW AND THE REST OF 'EM

   The City window is your main view of your city. It is always open
   as long as SimCity 2000 is running. The game is easiest to control
   with the City window as large as possible, but you can resize it on
   some computers.

   Most of the other, smaller windows, such as the Map and Population 
   windows, open either by selecting them in the Windows menu, or by 
   clicking on their button on the toolbar.

   If you just want to take a quick look at one of the smaller windows
   (momentary view), click and hold on their buttons in the toolbar.
   The window will be visible until you release the mouse button. If,
   while holding down the button, you drag the window away from the
   toolbar then release the mouse button, then the window will remain
   on the screen until you close it (tear-off view).

   There are two oter important points to remember about the small 
   windows:

      1. Some of them have extra buttons or controls that appear in tear-off,
	 but not in momentary view.

      2. As long as small windows are open, they will remain on top of the 
	 City window. When you click on the City window to modify the city,
	 it will not cover the small windows - place them carefully so they 
	 don't block your access to the City window scroll bars.

MENUS

   These are all the menus and menu items in SimCity 2000. There
   may be a few slight differences on different computers.

FILE MENU
   
   This menu has the commands for file management, starting new games and 
   scenarios and quitting SimCity 2000.  

   ABOUT SIMClTY 2000
    Brings up exciting and thrilling information about the game and its
    makers. If your computer has a special menu, like the Macintosh "Apple" 
    menu, this item will be there and not in the File menu. 
   
   LOAD CITY
    Opens a file-loading dialog box allowing you to load in and play a
    previously saved SimCity 2000 city. This command can also be used to 
    import a city from SimCity or SimCity Classic.  
   
   NEW CITY
    First asks if you want to save your existing city, then generates a
    new, empty terrain, prompts you for the city's name and game level, then 
    begins the game.
   
   EDIT NEW MAP
    First asks you if you want to save your existing city, then removes
    all buildings and infrastructure and delivers the bare terrain into
    Terrain-Editing mode. In Terrain-Editing mode, you have access
    to tools to customize and/or regenerate the terrain to your heart's
    content - without being charged. 
   
   LOAD SCENARIO
    Opens a dialog box that allows you to view all the different scenarios, 
    then select one.
   
   SAVE CITY      
    Saves the current city to disk under the same name and in the same place 
    where it was last saved. If it hasn't been saved the Save City As... 
    dialog box will open, allowing you to rename the city and choose the 
    destination disk and directory or folder.

    Opens a dialog box that allows you to name/rename a city and choose the 
    disk and directory or folder where you want to save it.

   QUIT
    Rips SimCity from your computer's memory and makes it go away until you're 
    ready to resume your mayoral responsibilities. It will first ask if you    
    want to save your existing city.

   SPEED MENU
    This menu has the commands for setting the simulation to different speeds,   
    including pause. The currently set speed will be marked by a check mark. 
    Actual speeds will vary, depending on your computer, its microprocessor 
    and its clock speed.

   PAUSE
    Stops time in the simulation.

   TURTLE
    Sets the simulation to run slower than molasses on a cold day.

   LLAMA
    Sets the simulation to run at a medium speed.

   CHEETAH

OPTIONS MENU

    This menu controls a number of simulation and sound options so you can
    tailor the game to your style of play. Options that are active have a 
    check mark next to them.

   AUTO-BUDGET
    When selected, Auto-Budget stops the Budget window from opening at the   
    end of each year, and automatically repeats the previous budget.

Page 51  SimCity 2000 - Reference

   AUTO-GOTO       
    When active, Auto-Goto automatically centers the City window over an 
    important occurrence, such as a disaster. When inactive you will still 
    receive messages to notify you of important goings-on on in your city.

   SOUND EFFECTS

DISASTERS MENU                          
	
   This menu lets you activate various disasters, or disable them entirely.
   For more information on disasters, see Dealing with Disasters in the 
   Strategies section below.

   FIRE
    Causes a fire to break out somewhere within the city limits.

   FLOOD
    Causes a wave of raised water to come in off the coast or down a river, 
    washing away anything that isn't tied down.

   TORNADO
    Sets a tornado loose to wreak havoc across the city limits.
   
   EARTHQUAKE
    Sets the earth to quakin' and the ground to shakin'. 

   MONSTER
    Releases the terror of the year 2000.


Page 52  SimCity 2000 - Reference


   NO DISASTERS
    Prevents disasters from occurring. No Disasters will not prevent the
    "official" scenario disasters, or stop disasters already in progress.
    No Disasters also prevents the City Council from voting in ordinances
    without your approval.

       Note:All power plants have a 50-year life span, and then they blow 
       up. They don 't cause fires or spread radiation - they just stop 
       working and collapse. Watch your newspapers for warnings that power
       plants are getting old.  If you have No Disasters active, when power 
       plants reach the end of their lives, they are automatically rebuilt
       and you are automatically charged. If you don't have enough cash in   
       your city funds to pay for the power plant replacement, it goes boom.

WINDOWS MENU

   This menu lets you access the various windows in SimCity 2000.  

   MAP
    Opens the Map window for various displays of your entire city.

   BUDGET
    Opens the window for fiddling with your city's finances.

   ORDINANCES
    Opens the Ordinance window for setting and inspecting various bonds, 
    bills and ordinances.

   POPULATION
    Opens the Population window to see a demographic breakdown of the
    Sims in your city.

   INDUSTRY
    Opens the Industry window to see the different types of industries
    currently operating in your city, and to set individual tax rates for
    different industries.

Page 53  SimCity 2000 - Reference

   GRAPHS
    Opens the Graphs window to see graphical displays of city data and
    statistics over time.     

   NEIGHBORS
    Opens the Neighbors window to see how you compare with your   
    surrounding neighbor cities. 

NEWSPAPER MENU
	
   This menu lets you set your newspaper delivery rate and read various
   local papers. Even with both delivery options below turned off,  
   newspapers announcing disasters will be delivered.      
		
   SUBSCRIPTION    
   
   When active, a newspaper will be delivered (popped up on the screen) 
   twice a year.   
			
   EXTRA!!!
   When active, only newspapers that report important occurrences - 
   inventions and major steps in city growth - will be delivered
			
   THE NEWSPAPERS        
   Opens and/or activates the various local newspapers. There will
   be from none (at the start of a city) to six (in a very large city)     
   different local newspapers. The newspaper that is marked with a   
   circle to the left of its name is the paper that will be delivered.     
   Opening a newspaper manually changes it to the one that will be     
   delivered.

WINDOWS

   This section describes in detail each of the windows in SimCity 2000.  

CITY WINDOW
   
   IN GENERAL 
   The City window is your main work area for molding, shaping and growing
   your city and the land under it. It is always open while SimCity2000 is 
   running (on most computers).
   
   At the top of the window is the Title bar, containing the simulation
   date, the name of the city and your current funds. On the right end
   of the Title bar is some sort of box or button (depending on your 
   computer) for quickly resizing the window. 
         On the Macintosh and on DOS-based computers, it is the Zoom box, 
	 which toggles the window between full-screen size and the last 
	 previously set window size.
      
         On a Windows-based computer, there will be two buttons. The Maximize
	 button toggles the window between full-screen size and the last
	 previously set window size. The Minimize button shrinks the window
	 to an icon.

   You can resize the City window by clicking and dragging the Resize box.
   The Scroll Bars and scroll Arrows let you move the city around in the
   City window.

   The toolbar provides all the tools you'll need to zone, build and run 
   your city. It appears differently, depending on the mode you are in.
   And speaking of modes...

Page 55  SimCity 2000 - Reference

   MODES
   The City window has three modes: City-Building, Terrain-Editing, and  
   Map.

   City-Building is the main, most-used mode. It lets you build and grow 
   your city. You can also edit the terrain, but there are physical and 
   financial limitations.      

   In Terrain-Editing mode, you can make all the changes and modifications 
   you could ever desire to the new, empty landscape without being charged. 
   Once you leave Terrain-Editing mode and enter City-Building mode to start 
   your city, you can never return that same landscape to Terrain-Editing 
   mode. 

   Map mode turns the entire City window into a giant, scalable display that 
   mirrors the information in the Map window. The City window's Map mode is 
   toggled on and off from the Map window.
   
   THE VlEW
   The view in the City window is an isometric, simulated 3-D landscape. It 
   can be viewed in three different sizes, allowing you to see more or less 
   of your city at once, at various levels of detail. 

Page 56  SimCity 2000 - Reference
	
   THE LANDSCAPE
   Each time you start a new city in SimCity 2000, a new landscape is 
   generated. You can regenerate the landscape as many times as you like. 
   You can modify the land scape as much as you like.

   When the City window is in terrain-editing mode, you can make changes to 
   the land at no cost to the city. You can raise or level mountains, dig
   streams, raise or lower the sea level, and place individual trees or 
   forests.

   Once the City window is in city-building mode, you can still make changes 
   to the landscape, but you'll have to pay for the work out of the city's
   funds.

   There are three basic elements to the landscape: land, water and trees.

   The land in SimCity 2000 is divided into small squares, called tiles. 
   Tiles can be raised or lowered to provide 32 levels of altitude. Land 
   that is below sea level will be under water.

   Water in SimCity 2000 flows downhill, as all good water should. When you 
   generate a new landscape in terrain-editing mode, you can choose whether      
   or not you want a river running through the landscape, and you can, if 
   you want, have one edge of your city be a coastline. Your landscape can 
   also have streams, ponds and lakes. And you can raise or lower sea level, 
   to make your city a desert or a chain of islands.

   Trees in SimCity 2000, as in the real world, are big plants that provide
   shade and homes for wildlife. They add an aesthetic touch to cities, and 
   improve land value.

Page 57  SimCity 2000 - Reference

   THE CITY TOOLBAR

   When the City window is in city-building mode, it has the City toolbar - 
   your main control center for building, modifying and running your city. 
   It can be moved around your screen by clicking and dragging the bar at 
   the top.

   For ease of use, especially for newcomers to SimCity 2000, you can simply 
   click on any button, then use the default setting of the tool. When you're 
   ready for more power,  more features and more flexibility, you can make 
   use of the submenus that are hidden below many of the buttons. If you 
   click and hold on a button with a submenu, the submenu will pop up,      
   allowing you to access many more choices and options. The submenus, and 
   their available options, change over the years, reflecting the available                
   technology
   
   The City toolbar contains tools that let you:         

         Modify the landscape  
      
         Zoom in and out for close-up and far-out views
      
         Center on different areas of the City window       
      
         Rotate the city in the City window
      
         Zone residential, commercial and industrial areas  
      
         Build the city infrastructure 
      
         Add special-purpos buildings 
      
         Closely inspect city areas
      
         Add signs or markers          
      
         Turn on and off the display of various objects and layers in the
	 City window
      
         Open various information windows

   It also has a Demand Indicator for various zones.

Page 58  SimCity 2000 - Reference
   
   Any time you need a reminder of what each of the buttons does,
   hold down either Shift key and click on a button. A friendly help
   message will pop up and set you straight.

   These are the tools in the City toolbar:

   BULLDOZER
    The bulldozer is a multi-function multi-level tool, with a default
    setting and a submenu to choose between four additional actions.
    Click and hold in the Bulldozer button to open the submenu. When
    bulldozer is active, the cursor will appear as a bulldozer.

    To operate the bulldozer, choose the function you want, then
    click or click and drag where you want to do your 'dozin'.

    Demolish/Clear (the default) destroys and removes trees, rubble,
    and man-made (Sim-made?) objects without affecting the terrain
    or zoning status. Just click on anything to destroy it.
    Cost: $1 per tile
    
    Level Terrain lets you choose an altitude level and slice off hills
    and mountains at your chosen height. Level also clears, removing all
    trees, roads, power lines and buildings.
    Cost: $25 per tile per altitude change.

    Raise Terrain lets you make mountains out of molehills.
    Cost: $25 per til per altitude change.

    Lower Terrain lets you lower mountains and dig canyons. (If you
    lower the terrain below sea level, it will fill with water.)
    Cost: $25 per til per altitude change.

    De-zone lets you change undeveloped residential, commercial or
    industrial zones to unzoned land.
    Cost: $1 per tile

    Raising, lowering and leveling terrain can be very expensive, so do
    sparingly. If you want to make a lot of changes to the landscape,
    do it in terrain-editing mode before you start your city, or save up
    a lot of cash.

   LANDSCAPE TOOL  
    The Landscape tool lets you add trees and water to your city. When 
    active, the cursor will appear as a tree. Clicking and holding on the 
    button opens a submenu that allows you to choose between 
    trees and water.      

    Tree tool lets you place trees onto the landscape. Each click will    
    place either one or two trees. You can click repeatedly on a single tile
    to create dense thickets, and click and drag across many tiles to
    create forests.
    Cost: $3 per click.     

    The Water tool lets you create lakes and streams by clicking where you 
    want your water to appear.    
    Cost: $100 per tile.

   EMERGENCY               
    The Emergency tool lets you dispatch police and/or fire departments
    to the scene of a disaster. This tool will be ghosted and unavailable 
    unless a disaster is occurring.  When active, the cursor will appear
    as an emergency beacon. Clicking and holding on the tool opens a submenu 
    that allows you to choose between dispatching police and fire.        

    Once you activate the tool and choose the department you want
    to dispatch, click on the area of the city where you want your city's
    finest to go. An icon representing either your dispatched fire or
    police troops will be placed where you click. You can place one
    icon for each station you have. After you have placed then all,

    Clicking again will move the first one you placed to the last place
    clicked, enabling you to block, surround and contain a fire or riot.
    There is no cost for dispatching police or firesims.

   POWER
    Power is a multi-use tool. Clicking and holding on it opens a
    submenu that allows you to choose between two functions: laying
    power lines and placing power plants. When this tool is active, the
    cursor appears as a lightning bolt.

    Power Lines (the default setting) lets you "paint" your power lines
    onto the land by clicking in the place where you want the line to
    start, dragging the cursor to the place where you want the line to
    stop, and releasing the mouse button. If you start laying a power
    line and change your mind, you can cancel the operation by holding 
    down the Shift key before you release the mouse button.

    Power lines blink warning lights to let you know if they're not
    hooked to a power source. Power lines can only be run in straight 
    lines and 90-degree angles. They can cross roads or rails but not on 
    curved sections or straight sections that run at 45 degrees. Laying
    power lines across water is a little more expensive.  If you lay power
    lines across water, a dialog box will open and let you know how much it 
    will cost.   
    $2 per tile across land, $10 per tile across water.

    Power Plant... lets you choose power sources for your city.  Depending 
    on the year and the technology level of your city, there may be from 
    three to nine types of power plants available. Click on the power source 
    you want, then click on the terrain where you want it to go.  There is
    an info button for each power plant that tells you the advantages, 
    disadvantages and costs for each type of power plant.
