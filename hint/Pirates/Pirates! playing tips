Tips for playing Microprose pirates! by Colin Attle.

1.When choosing nationality,choose english if it's your first game,the others are 
more harder in sequence(French,Dutch,Spanish)but in different historical periods 
each has it's own advantages and disadvantages.As for difficulty levels,the more 
loot you get and the less help from your crew,i think that the governors,Pirate 
hunters and different nationalitys have better memorys,but dont quote me on this.
At the start of the game,when choosing skill it's a toss up between Wit and Charm 
or Medicine.With Wit And Charm you can charm the Governors daughters,but this 
only works if you see them regualary,no use if you are at the other end of the 
map.Medicine will Give you one last trip around the Spanish main.

2.I always choose Port royale to start from(if you choose English as your Nationality 
You are nearly always at war with Spain,and there's Santiago and Puerto principle 
to start off with,but the choice is yours.)Have patience on your first voyage you will 
sometimes get your boat blown to smithereens when approaching an enemy city by 
sea,or lose most of your men in a land battle,more of the tactics for those situations 
later.With no experience you will lose land or sea battles due to having too few 
men,but with no experience(reputation)you cannot get enough men to help you.
Joseph Heller anyone(Catch 22).

3.The best way to deal with Sea battles i have found is as follows:-
When sighted a boat dont automatically sail away if in friendly waters Or close for 
battle in enemy waters,chances are you'll make the wrong choice and undo a great 
deal of work for nothing,so take your time and choose wisely.If you sail out of your 
first port,hope you meet a pirate hunter.IS HE MAD.No.Because if you win the 
battle you might get of the enemy's crew to join your's,thereby increasing your 
chances in subsequent battles,and boosting your reputation.The best way to deal 
with enemy craft in battles,is to,if close raise sails and go in close(by close i mean 
about 1-4 boat lenghths away.)Dont forget  the mood of your crew (which goes 
from Happy,Pleased,Unhappy,Angry)can have a bearing on the crews cannon 
loading in battles.If you cant get to the boat and want it for you're fleet try and 
disable it with you're cannons,remembering to use battle sails first,try and realise 
that you cannot fire straight at the boat,your shots will miss if you try and shoot at 
the ship,aim a little bit in front and that should work.Also if you let a pirate boat 
go sometimes if you have a large fleet your tail end boat may be captured,so watch 
out Choose a longsword for battles,good reach and damage.When swordfighting 
see what the mood of your crew is,strong go in for the kill,shaken go with 
CAUTION.The fight itself is different matter.I Normally stick to slashes,the higher the 
rank the faster they attack(and so will you)but its more tricky,much more.The only 
thing i can say here is to practice,there is a pattern to the attacks from you're 
opponent so take heart.When you've won the battle youcan take the ship or 
abandon it.Take my advice,dont put all you're gold in one ship.Plunder anything 
above a sloop,have 3-4 sloops,and go around the Spanish main in these.Iv'e found 
that if you have on big ship(above a sloop)it's harder to steer,and fatal to go across 
reefs.Take what you need from a ship,food is especially handy,if you have a big 
crew and whatever else.Dont take something,just because you'll get 10 gold more 
per item,when you're sacking 6 enemies citys,it wont matter,you'll only get 1000-
2000 more gold pieces.The best size crew i have to go looting is about 225,so stick 
to that,at the end when of a trip when dividing up the plunder have as few as crew 
as possible,the more crew you have the less money each one will get and think less 
of you next ti
 
4.Attacking enemies ports can be tricky so here goes.Always try to attack anywhere 
apart from the west side,it will turn out to be a slow boat to leogane,cartagena,
etc,etc.If the winds are light turn back and try again.Indian attacks will reduce the 
number of soldiers and nothing else,pirates take the towns gold and damages the 
economy,malaria cuts down the number of troops in the fort and will slow or even 
stop the economy,and gold mines turn a poor town into a rich one fairly quickly.If 
you land near to the city(3 boat lengths away or more)you might take all of the 
citys gold,or you might not.In  land battles try and have more than the fort,then 
you'll go straight to the fight with the fort's commander.If you dont have enough 
troops then hide one of of your parties in bushes and lure the forts troops away 
and past you're hidden party,then take the luring troops off the screen and take the 
hidden ones to to fort.It is important that you take the flag on the fort to enter it,if 
it doesnt work try again,it will.If you reduce a city to 1 person left when 
swordfighting,chances are you'll be able to see off the old inhabitants and insatll a 
new nationality,this will do no harm when you come to visit a governor for services 
to your crown(king).Handy eh.

5.In port always visit the governor,no not for his daughter..,just in case he wants 
you to do an errand for you.These are up to you,sometimes there near sometimes 
they're not and can make you miss a treasure fleet or such,so you decide And save 
if you must.Propose to the governors daughter only when you're rich and famous 
or should that be,anyway if you dont prepare to be humiliated and have cheeks the 
the same colour of the of the young ladys dress.If playing at higher levels buy 
information about other cities,because if you check when you first start a game the 
cities list will be sparse.The old man who offers you a map must be quick on his 
feet,because if you decide to buy it,3 quarters is missing,another saving oppurtunity 
methinks.Also if you've done you're share of looting and feel that you might be 
promoted divide up the plunder first,plan another expedition and then go to see 
the governor,that way you'll get to know the whereabouts of some cad who's got a 
map to one of you're family.On this point i can only say to memorize the 
coastline,isles,and anything else,or you could save the game find one of you're 
family and restart.After you've found one of you're family they'll give you another 
map and after you've calmed down you can go and track this down(believe me its 
worth the effort,worth 4-5 rich cities effort).The family you'll find is,Sister ,Father 
,Mother,Uncle.If you do try to sneak into an enemy port you might get seen by a 
guard,or not served by a Spanish shopkeeper it depends on how rich the city is 
(Struggling,Surviving,Prosperous,Wealthy) so keep an eye on your crews 
stomachs,thats how much food you've got letf and be on the lookout for a friendly 
port.

6. All the ships handle differently,some more slower than others.Some steer better 
to 12 o'Clock some to 9 o'Clock.Dont think that smaller is quicker,could larger be 
faster?

Well thats about all that i can tell you,have fun with this brilliant game and hope 
some publisher brings this out with a proper size detailed map and full instruction 
book.This is Freeware.
