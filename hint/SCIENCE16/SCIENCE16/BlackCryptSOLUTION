FIRSTLY LET ME EXPLAIN A FEW THINGS ABOUT THE GAME,
IN THIS DOC I REFER TO LOCATIONS, YOU GET THE LOCATION UP BY CLICKING ON
THE FIGHTER THEN YOU CLICK ON HIS STONE TABLET WITH THE SWORD IN, AND THIS
WILL GIVE YOU THE LOCATION AND THE CURRENT LEVEL THAT YOU ARE ON.

ALSO I STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU ALWAYS USE THE SPELL WIZARD SIGHT, AND THE
SPELL COMPASS AS SOON AS IT BECOMES AVAILABLE.

I THINK THAT THIS IS JUST ABOUT THE FULL GAME SOLUTION, I HAVE COMPLETED THE
LEVELS BUT I CANNOT SEEM TO FIND ANYTHING ELSE LEFT TO DO.

I ONLY USE LOCATIONS IN THIS DOC RATHER THAN E,E,S,S ETC. AS THIS IS SUCH A 
VAST GAME IT WOULD TAKE MONTHS!!!!

BUT I DO REFER TO SPECIFIC DIRECTIONS EG. E,E,N,S,S ETC, AT SOME PLACES IN
THE GAME WHERE I THINK IT IS NECESSARY.
