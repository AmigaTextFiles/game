The archive contains LaTeX source and PostScript output. If you have
access to neither LaTeX nor a PostScript printer, the .tex file is
more-or-less human readable. A save game file is included, if you just
want to try some higher levels. Any scientifically minded person is
strongly recommended to have a look at LaTeX - it's not for the
layman, but it's the best system for writing technical reports ever
devised.

Happy hacking
