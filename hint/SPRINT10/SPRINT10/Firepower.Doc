                         WELCOME TO FIREPOWER !

     There are three modes of play in FIREPOWER, you have chosen:

                        JOYSTICK VS. COMPUTER

     In this mode of FIREPOWER your adversary is the computer.  One
joystick is required (in the second joystick port). In this mode the
playing screen is larger than in the two player modes and the STATUS
WINDOW is located along the right side. After you read these
instructions you will be prompted to pick your tank.  There are three
tanks to choose from. Each has its own characteristics and
specifications. Make your selection by pressing the joystick to the
left, right or center.  Press the firebutton while holding your
selection. 
 
                            GAME PLAY

     The goal of FIREPOWER is to find the enemy's flag and return it
to your base.
     The game begins with your tank sitting in a garage at your base. 
Drive forward and your tank will come out of the garage and become
visible (refer to JOYSTICK CONTROLS at the end of this document). If
you remain stationary at any location for too long, the enemy
will locate you and attack with helicopters. It is possible for your
tank to get stuck when driving through rubble or other projections
from the ground.  Moving in the reverse direction will usually solve
this problem.

                       THE STATUS WINDOW
 
     SCORE:  You gain points by destroying your enemy's
helicopters, men and fortresses. You also gain points by saving your own
men and returning them to a First-Aid Station (marked with a red
cross).

     MEN:  The number in this window indicates the number of your men you
have on board your tank. You pick up your men by stopping when they run
up to your tank.  If the tank is moving, the men will be killed. 
After you have taken on the maximum amount of men, your own men will not
attempt to run up to your tank. You unload your men by stopping on the
right hand side of the First-Aid Station.  Your men will then exit
the tank and run into the Station.  

     FUEL:  Each tank starts with a full load of fuel. The fuel load is
consumed as the tank drives from place to place. Additional fuel can
be acquired by finding and destroying your enemy's fuel depots,
 (A large dome connected diagonally to a smaller dome), also by
returning to your garage. If your tank exhausts its fuel, it will
explode to prevent the enemy from taking abandoned tanks on the battle
field.

     LIVES: You start with 5 lives, new lives can be obtained by
rescuing 15 of your men.

     RADAR:  In the center you will see a light brown dot representing
your tank.  All enemy vehicles including helicopters and the
enemy's flag are represented by light green dots.

                         JOYSTICK CONTROL

     The joystick controls in FIREPOWER are absolute, so that if
you are facing up and you would like to drive to the left, all you
need to do is push the joystick to the left and hold it there. If you
are facing left and you would like to back up, press the joystick to
the right (the opposite direction).


                          SOME HINTS

     Keep track of the direction of your home base, as you will have to
return there with your enemy's flag in order to win the game. The gun
turrets on both fortresses only have eight positions.  The turrets can
fire  at a 45 degree angle, but not at 25 degrees.  Thus they are
vulnerable to a well-positioned attack. In addition, the turrets are
programmed not to shoot in any direction that might damage other
portions of its own fortress. Thus, if your tank is well
positioned, the enemy turrets will not fire on you when your tank is in
close proximity to other vulnerable parts of its fortress.
     Good luck, and capture the Flag!
