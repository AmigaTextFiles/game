Hawaiin Islands

The distance from the eastern tip of Hawaii (also known as the Big Island)
to the west side of Niihau is about 380 statute miles.  

Most of the Volcanoes are now extinct except on the Big Island, where you
will find the mountains Mauna Kea (13,796 feet) and, on the southern half
of the island, Mauna Loa (13,677 feet).  On the southeast slope of Mauna
Loa is Kilauea (4,090 feet).

The Hawaiin Islands contain a total of 26 airports and airstrips.

Experimental Scenery

Kilauea is located on the southeast slope of Mauna Loa on the Big Island
(Hawaii).  If you fly into the main crater, or caldera, of Kilauea you will
be thrown into a instantaneous space/time warp.  You will be transported to
the opposite end of the island chain where you may find a late seventeenth
century Barkentine ship.  Use slew©mode (if available) to get a better
look.

Make a slow descent into the Crater at the summit of Mauna Loa and you will
be translated to a wasteland containing the Seven Portals, each leading to
a different alternate reality.  Beyond these Portals, you may find a
kitchen that is about four miles wide, a piano with an 8,000 foot
keyboard/runway, a city where concepts like up and down are not
neccessarily what you are accustomed to.

Scenery Adventure

Locating the secret jewel of the goddess Pele from the cockpit of your
aircraft isn't easy.  You must find and follow a set of clues scattered
about the islands that, with luck, will lead you to your goal.

The treasure hunt starts at General Lymann Field near the city of Hilo on
the Big Island.  To begin the hunt, taxi or slew your aircraft through the
big square box with the X in it at the airport.  A series of large arrows
will appear on the ground.  You must fly in the direction indicated by
these arrows.  Additional arrows will appear to guide you across the
islands.  These arrows flash red/white from a distance and are solid whit
up close.  Some segments of your journey will take longer than others
before the next arrow becomes visible.

This treasure hunt takes roughly over 1 hour to fly from start to finsih at
jet aircraft speeds (gear and flaps up, 350-400 knots), longer if flying a
single engine aircraft, and about 15 minutes in slew mode.  If you want to
stop before completing the journey and resume it at a later time, there are
several X-marked start boxes along the route.  Save mode locations at or
near these boxes to more easily pick-up the hunt where you left off.  These
start boxes can be found at the following coordinate locations:

	X-Marked Start Box Locations

The Volcanoes on the Big Island can be viewed to the best effect by flying
over them at dusk or dawn to enhance the view of the craters' lava flow.
