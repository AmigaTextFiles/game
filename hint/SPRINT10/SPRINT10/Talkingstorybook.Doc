       Installing The "Talking Storybook Player" Diskette

The "Talking Storybook" uses two diskettes to operate.  The first is
labeled "Player Diskette".  The "Player Diskette" uses several files
contained on the diskettes labeled "EXTRAS" and "WORKBENCH" that were
purchased with your AMIGA personal computer.  Please make sure that these
diskettes are handy before proceeding.  Make sure a copy of the "Player
Diskette" is being used when installing.  NOT THE ORIGINAL DISKETTE!

STEP 1

Turn on your AMIGA computer and insert the diskette labeled "KICKSTART
V1.1".

STEP 2

Remove the "KICKSTART V1.1" diskette from the drive and replace it with the
backup copy of the "PLAYER diskette".  A warning message will now appear to
remind the user that the install program is to be executed only on the
"PLAYER diskette" backup.  If you are not using the backup diskette, Please
remove the diskette from the drive and turn off the computer and read the
instructions again for proper backup procedures.

If you are now ready to install the backup copy of the "PLAYER diskette",
follow the instructions that appear on the warning screen and exchange the
"EXTRAS" diskette at the prompts.  Please follow all instructions.

MAKE SURE THE RED LIGHT LOCATED ON YOUR AMIGA DISK DRIVE TURNS OFF
COMPLETELY BEFORE REMOVING OR EXCHANGING DISKETTES.

At the prompt, "Press Control, AMIGA, AMIGA," the installation is complete.

Note: the backup story diskette labeled "STORYBOOK diskette" need not be
installed.

                     Booting The Installed Diskette

After booting with "KICKSTART V1.1" the AMIGA will prompt for "WORKBENCH". 
Instead of putting in the "WORKBENCH" diskette as normal, insert the
installed "PLAYER diskette".  The AMIGA will now load the "TALKING
STORYBOOK" program.  After a brief moment the theme music will play and the
title screen will appear.

Next a prompt for the "STORYBOOK diskette" will be viewed.  You may now
insert any of the "STORYBOOK diskettes" into either drives.  If you are
operating a single drive system, remove the "PLAYER diskette" and replace
with the "STORYBOOK diskette".

                    Operating The Talking Storybook

A screen will next appear with graphic representations of the stories
contained on the diskette and four options for functions.  These options
are:

	Lips	- if the lips are open then the speech is on.
	Music   - if you can view the staff the music will play.
	ABC's   - if the ABC is viewed then text will be displayed.
        oo	- if the infinity symbol (oo) is viewed the story is on
                  continuous play (the pages will automatically turn.)

The above four functions may be selected in any combination by selecting
with the left mouse button.

After the desired options have been selected, again use the left mouse
button to select the story to be played.  You will now view the first
"page" of the story.  In the upper left hand corner of the page, the page
number will be displayed.  At the bottom of the screen are several movement
gadgets.  Press the left arrow gadget to turn the page back, one at a time.
 Press the right arrow gadget to advance to the next page in the story. 
The "END" gadget ends the story and returns to the "options screen".  Press
the "FLIP" gadget and you are allowed to enter any page to flip to in the
story (notice that the numbers are displayed in the "page gadget").

                         Final Suggestions and Notes

The "Talking Storybook" can be a very powerful tool for readers to improve
their skill levels.  Selecting the "lips" to off, will allow the operator
to read at any pace.  Viewing the pictures will help hold the reader's
interest.  One should note that when the speech is turned off that two
mouse clicks are required to turn to the next page.

This product was designed as a reading aid for readers of all ages.  It is
the intent of "The Other Guy's" to select stories of several difficulty
levels, and these will be clearly viewed on the exterior packaging as to
what grade level is being targeted.  Several projects are now available or
under production, including:

Greek Mythology			World Historical Stories
The Child's First ABC's		Classics From Years Gone By
Natural Mysteries		Science Brought To Life
Space The Final Frontier	Wild Life
Ocean Going Animals
