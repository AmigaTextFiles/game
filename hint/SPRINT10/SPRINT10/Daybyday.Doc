 BACKUP YOUR PROGRAM DISK
--------------------------
 Use X-Copy.



 DATA FILES AND THEIR SECURITY
-------------------------------
 You will be storing your information on your backup copy of the DAY-BY-DAY
program disk. It will contain all the information that you will be typing
into the system in future. It is therefore very important to keep a backup
copy of the disk on a regular basis, in case a fault develops.

 Although time consuming, imagine how much time it will take you to re-type
say, 100 appointments. Faults can develop on discs and it can be very
difficult or impossible to recover your lost data.



 CAPACITY
----------
 DAY-BY-DAY can store up to 1,000 messages in memory. This may be limited
by the amount of available memory, or by storing a number of unusually large
messages. You will be able to store more messages by removing any memory
resident programs or utilities.



 DATES
-------
 When entering a date the following prompt will appear on the screen:

             Day   :    DD
             Month :    MM
             Year  :    YY

 DD, MM and YY are the default values for the date, Simply press RETURN once
to accept the default date. Alternatively, enter the date required, DAY-BY-
DAY uses two digit years.

 Additionally, in the day prompt, three letter abbreviations for the day of
the week may be entered (e.g. Tue). The date will then be automatically
calculated within a week of the current day. In the Month Prompt, three
letter abbreviations may also be entered (e.g. Jan).

 DAY-BY-DAY will check for invalid dates.

 Intelligence !
 DAY-BY-DAY is intelligent in that it automatically changes the default as
you are entering the date. If you enter a new day which is less than the
current day displayed. DAY-BY-DAY will assume that you are starting a new
month. Similarly, if you enter a month which is less than the current
month displayed, it will assume that you are starting a new year.

 For example, assuming the default date is 31.12.88, if you enter 1 for the
day, DAY-BY-DAY will automatically change the default date to 1.1.89.



 SAVING AND LOADING INFORMATION
--------------------------------
 DAY-BY-DAY uses only one data file (called DBDDATA) which is stored on the
same disk as the program. This is automatically loaded when you load DAY-BY
-DAY and you will be prompted to save the file when exiting the program (if
you have made any changes).

 Hard-disk users please note : This data file will be loaded/saved to the
current directory (i.e. the directory from which you loaded DAY-BY-DAY).



 MODES OF OPERATION
--------------------
 DAY-BY-DAY is divided into two modes of operation - SCREEN and MENU.

SCREEN - This mode is for displaying/adding/editing your messages.
         Additionally, it is used for weekly/monthly summaries.

MENU - This mode is for selecting options for setting up categories
       searching for messages, selecting to display weekly/monthly planners.

             DAY will prompt you for the new information, with the existing

             ically move forward onto the next screen.

             menu.



 MENU MODE  -  THE MAIN MENU
-----------------------------
 Having loaded DAY-BY-DAY, and used FORWARD to scroll through the different
screens (or EXIT), you will be presented with the main menu.

 To select options from the main menu simply press the key corresponding to
the option (e.g. F for Forthcoming engagements, M for Month planner).

 Please note: Mouse users may select an option by clicking the mouse.

 As mentioned previously, it is possible to go back and view the URGENT/
OVERDUE/THIS WEEK messages by selecting the appropriate option from the main
menu (i.e. 1 for Urgent, -for Overdue, =for This Week). ?Thats what it says!



 FORTHCOMING ENGAGEMENTS
-------------------------
 Use this option to display all messages from today's date onwards. Messages
will be displayed on a month by month basis (using FORWARD option). When you
have reached the end of the file (i.e. there are no more messages) DAY-BY-
DAY will display:

                    *** NO MORE ENTRIES ***


 OVERDUE
---------
 Use this option to display all messages that are overdue (i.e. prior to
todays date).



 THIS WEEK
-----------
 Use this option to display all messages that are dated today or the next
six days.



 CATEGORIES
------------
 Used tp group related messages. You may set up a maximum of 9 categories.

 For example, in the category called `Urgent', you would enter any urgent
messages by selecting the categories from the main menu. This will take you
into SCREEN mode - (within the urgent category) at which point you can enter
the message. The category heading (as per the main menu) will be displayed
at the top of the screen.
 As a result, this option provides the means to search and display messages
in particular grouping (in this case Urgent).
 URGENT is apre-defined category. New categories may be set up using CHANGE
CATEGORIES (see next section).
 Messages entered into a category will not only be displayed under the
selected category, but also under Forthcoming Engagements/Overdue/This Week.
 Information may be added without a date in a category. This is achieved by
accepting the default date of 0 when adding the message. Such an entry will
ONLY be displayed under the category heading. Hence, a category `NOTEPAD'
may be created which would be suitable for reminders which are not dependent
on the date.



 CHANGE CATEGORIES
-------------------
 Select option C from the main menu. A sub-menu will appear (at the bottom
of the screen). Simply type the first letter corresponding to the screen
option (e.g. type A to add). The selected screen option will be delighted.

 (A)dd:       Adds a new category. The heading of this category will then

 (D)elete:    You will be prompted for the category number (as displayed on
              the main menu). Any messages still remaining under a deleted

              Overdue and This Week as appropriate. Any undated messages
              will be displayed under Overdue.
               It is not possible to delete the `URGENT' category.

 OPTIONS
---------
 Options are used to determine the amount of information to be prompted for
each message. The Options are Duration, Range and Time. When you load DAY-BY
-DAY, all of these options will be set to OFF, thus when entering messages
the minimum amount of information is required. To switch them ON simply

switch the OFF.

 DURATION:  Setting this option to ON results in DAY-BY-DAY requesting (when

            adding an entry): How many entries: (You may enter up to 99).
            Days between entries: (e.g. 1 for daily,7 for weekly,etc.)

            Use this option if you wish to enter an appointment/message over
            a `range" of dates (e.g. town hall meeting every fortnight).

 TIME:      Setting this option to ON results in DAY-BY-DAY requesting the
            of the message (when adding an entry). Enter the starting time
            in hours and minutes. Simply press RETURN for minutes and a
            default 0 will be entered. After the starting time, enter the
            finishing time in the same way.

            Use this option to plan your day to the minute and this will be
