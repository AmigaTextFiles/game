INSTRUCTIONS

     Insert the JMH diskette, "The Talking Coloring Book", at the Workbench
     prompt.

     At the JMH title screen, move the mouse pointer to the CONTINUE box
     and press the left mouse button.

     After the JMH title page, this program will provide 4 options.  Select
     an option by pointing to the desired box, then pressing the left mouse
     button.  Or an option can be selected by typing the letter (A, B, C,
     or D) of the desired option.

OPTIONS

A.  DEMONSTRATION - As the computer speaks the color word, the word and the
    associated color are shown on the screen.  The user can then direct the
    computer to display another color or repeat the previous color by
    moving the mouse pointer to the proper box.

B.  PRACTICE - Verbally, the computer directs the user to identify each of
    nine different colors.  This is done by moving the mouse pointer to the
    correct color and pressing the left mouse button.  Using a teacher
    approach, the computer patiently helps preschoolers learn the color
    words. 

C.  COLOR - Any picture on the disk may be colored with any combination of
    the brilliant colors provided.  The color is selected by moving the
    mouse pointer to the desired color and pressing the left mouse button. 
    Next, move the pointer to the region of the picture to be colored and
    press the left  mouse button again.

D.  DRAW - Additional creativity can be exercised in this option, allowing
    new pictures to be drawn, changed, and stored on the disk.  These
    pictures are then available for coloring.  The drawing is done by
    holding down the left mouse button and moving the mouse pointer.  Any
    of the pictures that the user has created and stores on the disk can be
    deleted.  The pictures provided with the program are permanent and can
    not be altered or deleted.
