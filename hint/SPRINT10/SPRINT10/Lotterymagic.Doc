Author's Hints for winning the lottery:
1) Set Configuration to '10 Weeks' or '26 Weeks', this allows the computer
   to compute hot numbers which are current.
2) Play 'Hot' or 'Wild' numbers when possible.
3) Use the wheeling systems as often as you can.
4) Keep you lottery file up to date!

Good Luck!
