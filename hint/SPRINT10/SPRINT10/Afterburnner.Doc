[Afterburner] [ST/AMIGA]

There are 23 level in this game and each level will be changed when your
aircraft refuels and rearms with the flying tanker.

This was a real successful arcade game and converting that game to the 16
bit machines must have been one heck of a job.

This is basically an aerial combat game in which you fly a sole F-14
against what may seem like a complete enemy air force.

Unusual for its display, you see yourself from behind your aircraft.

You have basically an unlimited supply of bullets, which you should be
using to your best ability.  Unfortunately, the air-to-air missiles are
what you need, and they are limited in number.  The gun can be used when an
aircraft is in front of you, but it is very limited.

A good technique to try is to take is slow and only speed up against the
missile attacks or when a fighter gets behind you.

After you practice through the first several waves of planes, you will
start to see the enemy begin to fire air-to-air missiles at you.  Good
eyesight and responses on the flying stick are your only key to survival.
The enemy missiles get better as the game goes.  Yours don't,
unfortunately.

Against the missiles, try watching for the missile launch and wait a
little.  As they zip near you, pull your aircraft up and bank away and get
your speed up.  

There are no gauges to look at except your speed, ammo levels and lives.
This game requires you to keep your eyes on the action screen.

Someone recommended just doing 360 degree turn-overs and you will basically
be missed by everything, though is sounds boring and stomach upsetting.

Sooner or later you will encounter the aircraft that try to come up from
behind you.  To get out of this you will have to learn how to go into a
"spin".  Move your stick to one direction and immediately go to the other
direction till your have gone all the way around.  This should help you get
away from the bogie behind you.

When going through the canyon scenes, slow down your aircraft as much as
you can so you won't hit the sides.  You will also be able to pick your
targets better.  Go for the tankers first.

You can rest at the two airports provided during the action.
