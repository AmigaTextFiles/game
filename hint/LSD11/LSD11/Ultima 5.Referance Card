                        ULTIMA 5 REFERANCE CARD

Typed by THE MOUSER.  Edited by PARASITE.

Note: these commands are from the Apple reference card.  It is possible there
will be minor differences in the versions for other computers.


As an extra note, anyone who plays Ultima V should know that it is
IMPOSSIBLE to solve the game without certain information from The Book of
Lore.  This information is contained in ULTIMA5 DOCUMENTS  I guess you could
call it a form of copy protection.

     (Well, that's about the best I can do on the Runes.  When you're
deciphering runes, 'the' and 'Lord British' are very popular words on signs.
'Here lies' can also be found on most tombstones.)

End.
