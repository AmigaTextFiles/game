WEIRD DREAMS

Weird Cheat! In the hall of mirrors,walk into the mirror that is to the
right BUT don`t pass through it.Go as far as you can without going through
then you need to tap out SOS in morse code on the HELP key so do 3 quick
stabs,followed by 3 presses of about a second each then 3 more quick
stabs.The lives counter should now be replaced by an infinity symbol!
(Be warned,it is very hard to execute the cheat mode!)
