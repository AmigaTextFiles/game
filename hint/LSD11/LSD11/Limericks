Well, Its become a bit of a tradition to include some jokes on our docs

There was a young man of Kings Lynn
Who was so exceedingly thin
That when he essayed
Making love to a maid
He slipped on the mat and fell in!

There were two young ladies from Grimsby
Who wondered what use could their quims be?
The bit in the middle
Was, clearly, for piddle,
But what could those hair-covered rims be?

In the Lord Bishop's seat he was sat,
He was thinking of Venus
While pulling his penis
And catching the drops in his hat

A bit further down
Was an RSM's crown

There is a good story concerning 'em
They lifted the frock
And played with the cock

He took off the britches
Of those dirty bitches
And used his episcopal tool!

Who waylaid a young girl and attacked 'er
In reply to this trick

Of whom the Town Clerk took advantage
Said the Borough Surveyor:
'You'll now have to pay 'er
