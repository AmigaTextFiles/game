TETRIS
======

GETTING STARTED

AFTER LOADING ,SELECT YOUR STARTING LEVEL OF DIFFICULTY (FROM THE 
HIGH SCORE SCREEN ).THE HIGHER THE NUMBER,THE GREATER THE REWARD, 
BUT THE HARDER THE TASK.

PLAYING TETRIS

A VARIETY OF DIFFERENTLY SHAPED BLOCKS FALL,ONE BY ONE,FROM THE 
TOP OF THE SCREEN,OR PLAYFIELD.YOU CAN MANIPULATE THESE SHAPES 
LEFT/RIGHT AND ROTATE THEM BEFORE THEY LAND AT THE BOTTOM OF THE 
PLAYFIELD.

THE IDEA IS TO CREATE COMPLETE HORIZONTAL LINES OF BLOCKS ACROSS 
THE PLAYFIELD.WHEN ONE OF THESE UNBROKEN LINES IS COMPLETED IT 
DISAPPEARS,AND ANY BLOCKS ABOVE FALL INTO THE NOW VACANT AREA.

OBJECTIVE

YOUR AIM IS TO CREATE AS MANY COMPLETE LINES AS POSSIBLE.IF YOU 
LEAVE GAPS,THE PLAYFIELD WILL FILL UP RAPIDLY,LEAVING YOU LESS 
ROOM FOR MANOEUVRE.SHOULD THE PILE OF BLOCKS REACH THE TOP OF THE 
SCREEN THE GAME ENDS.

THE SHOW KEY (DATAPAD NO/ 1 )DISPLAYS THE SHAPE OF THE NEXT BLOCK 
THAT WILL FALL AFTER THE CURRENT BLOCK HAS LANDED - USEFUL FOR 
FORMULATING YOUR OPTIMUM STRATEGY.

THE RATE AT WHICH THE BLOCKS FALL SPEEDS UP AUTOMATICALLY AS YOUR 
SCORE INCREASES.
