	All of the screens up to the Labrynth can be solved by following
the arrow window (turn it on from the main menu icon).

Labrynth:  The object here is to go forward in three T-intersection
	   corridors.  Just move around in the maze, being careful not to
	   run into any of the walls.  When you come upon a screen where
	   there are only two possible ways to go:  either forward or to
	   one of the sides, go FORWARD.  You HAVE to push up on the 
	   joystick, or you will die.  Do this (going forward in these
	   T intersections) three times.  On the third one, you'll go to
	   a different screen.
	   
	   Now you are in a courtyard.  A skeletal arm will come up out of
	   the ground to one side of you.  We'll say it comes up to your
	   right.  You'll turn to face it.  Then:
	   	Move left.
		Move up.
		Move right.
		Move left.
	   
	   You'll move on to The Crypt.  If the arm comes up to your left,
	   just reverse the left/right commands above (ie.  move right, then
	   up, then left, then right).
	   
The Crypt:  Now you're back into the maze.  This time, you want to go
	    forward through five of the four-way intersections.  Sooooooo,
	    just wander around in the maze, and when you come across a
	    four-way intersection, push up (or do nothing--Dirk will move
	    straight ahead without your help).  When you go through your
	    fifth intersection, you'll go to the crypt itself.
	    
	    Now, you're face to face with the wraith.  What you want to do
	    here is note which side of the wraith the princess is.  If her
	    head is to the right of the wraith, do the following:
	    	   Move RIGHT, wait half a second, then move
			LEFT, wait for the screen to change, then
			LEFT, then
			UP, wait for the screen to change, then
			LEFT, then
			UP, the screen will change, and hit
			DOWN as soon as it changes.  Wait for the disk to
			     stop accessing, the wraith will start to
			     rise up.  Move
			UP, then hit
			BUTTON right after Dirk moves to the wraith.  Dirk
			       will start to swing his sword, then hit
			BUTTON again (right away) and he'll kill the wraith.
			
		If the princess' head is to the left of the wraith, just
		change all of the "left" commands above to "right" and vice-
		versa.
		
		
	Ta-daaa!  Thou is't finished!
