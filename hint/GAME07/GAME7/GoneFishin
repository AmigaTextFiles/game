    You start the game with a few dollars and very little 
equipment. Your task is to build you supply of fishing equipment 
and capitol so you may enter the "Fishen Tournaments". 

The tournament cost $500 to enter so that is a ways off.
For now you need to know how to control the game.

At the password prompt enter anything. It must be something, 
but anything will work. Next you go through the entro's. A click 
here and there will speed things up a bit. Reading this you will 
be new user, so, select the New Game option. 

Change the name window and the next screen is the "year-
week" click on the days you want to fish (work and fish toggel). When 
you get enough cash, $500, you will be able to fish the tournament 
but that is a thursday, friday and saturday event.

     The next screen is the Map, Radio, Bass(book) and Fish'Log.
To see what a lake is like click on map and then the telephone. 
This lets you call and see a report. After you decide on the lake 
you wish to fish, click on the car and boat. Don't forget to visit 
the Tackle Shop first or you will have no bait.

     The two motors move the boat. Use the trolling motor when you 
want to move into an area to fish. The gas motor scares off the 
fish. To start fishing click on the anchor and sellect a lure.
Next put the "X" (mouse) where you want to cast. Then click on 
fast or slow ( S or F ) for the retrieve speed. Different clicks of 
the mouse make the different lures work differently. When the fish 
jumps quit reeling (left button) and hit the right button. If not 
you will likely lose the fish.    

One last note. When you see the fish hit the lure you will hear a
click. Hit the right button, this sets the hook.

enjoy...Y.T.
