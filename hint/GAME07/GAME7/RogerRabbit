                                 THE SETTING
                                 ^^^^^^^^^^^

 Welcome to Hollywood-1947-a bussy,bustling,colorful,drama,and dreams;a place
where you can go straight to the top-or at least across town on a network of
electronic street cars called the "RED CARS" For a nickel you can ride to the 
end of the line,where two bits buys a Ham on Rye at hte Terminal Bar and Grill
    Cartoons are in their heyday,and our "TOON" hero,Roger Rabbit,is a true
superstarr! But his status as a Saturday matinee idol hasn't gone to his head.
 He 's just a nice,ordinary,well-rounded guy. That's right! Like all his comic
cronies,Roger is real,three-dimensional, just like you and me. He goes to 
work every day at Maroon Cartoon Studios and comes home to the animated 
suburb of Toontown.
    Then trouble hits Roger like a ton of bricks! He's framed for murdering
Marvin the gag king. When Marvin's will also disappears,it's clear that 
someone is up to some not-so-funny business... Espscially since Marvin,who 
owned Toontown,had promised to leave the place to the TOONS.

                                  THE GOAL
                                  ^^^^^^^^

    Things look bad for Roger.He's on the lamb,with sinister Toon-Hater,Judge
Doom after him.Doo wants to "ADMINISTER JUSTICE"-in the form of a nasty
chemical concoction called "THE DIP" that dissolves TOONS on contact!
    Roger has to move fast to stay out of Doom's clutches (It's not that he
minds an ocasional bath,it's just that he'd rather not be all washed up so
early in his career!) Help him stay ahead of Doom in a race to find Marvin's
will- and prevent ToonTown from being DIPPED off the faceof the earth!!

                             PART 1: BENNY THE CAB
                            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    Benny is a freewheeling,streetwise,and (usually)"wreckless" Brooklyn cab
with the gift of gab. Able to hop building and rise above it all on his 
accordion suspension,Benn's great in a jam.(But watchout for Bridges!).
    You're at the controls as Roger and Benny race Judge Doom through the 
streets of Hollywood. You beat him,if you watch out for the weasels in thier
Toon Patrol wagons,puddles of the deadly DIP,and collisions with the RED CARS.
     (Try landing on top of a RED CAR <THE BUSSES> AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS!)
    Touch the RUBBER GLOVES to temporarily protect Benny from puddles of DIP;
the WHEELS to get a burst of SuperSpeed;and the DIAMONDS to remove a bucket 
of DIP from your tally. Keep your eyes open for other helpful items too!
                       Start your engines-- and get going!!

                         PART 2: THE INK AND PAINT CLUB
                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    Whew! With your help,Roger and Benny have arrived at the INK AND PAINT 
CLUB the ony place in the world where humans can enjoy live preformances by 
TOON stars like Roger's Gorgeous wife Jessica.
    Marvin's will is somewhere in the piles of nightclub receipts,knapkins,
and  checks. Since it was written in disappearing ink,you must grab all the 
papers in the club to make sure Roger gets his mits on the will before the 
music stops.
    You control roger on his mad race around the tables collecting papers as
fast as the penguin waiters replace them. Aviod the gorilla and don't ever,
ever,ever let Roger take a drink. (comment: LET HIM DRINK!)

                             PART 3: THE GAG FACTORY
                            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    At last! You've reached the place where all those famous gaga are made.
Unfortunately,the weasels are waiting to jump you! But don't give up,Just grab
the gags you find and use them to temporarily disable the weasel you meet in
the factory. Since the weasels are TOONS your only hope of permantly destroying
 them is making them laugh themselves to death. Do anything funny,the more gags
the merrier- and the faster,the better for you!
    If you survive the weasels,it's not over! Judge Doom is waiting for you,
ready for the moment of thruth! Lose and it's all over for you, Roger, and
ToonTown. Defeat DOOM and you save ToonTown from total destruction and
Hollywood from a future of strip malls,exhaust fumes,dimand lanes and gridlock

                                   BUCKETS OF DIP
                                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  A bucket of DIP will be added to the tally when Benny Collides with something
When Roger is bounced from the Ink and Paint Club,or when the weasels use a gag
on Roger. Once 5 buckets are accumulated,the game is OVER.

(COMMENT:) WHEN THE GAME ENDS IT DROPS YOU TO A WORKBENCH SCREEN.YOU WILL HAVE
 TO RE-BOOT YOUR MACHINE TO RESTART THE GAME. TO BYPASS THE LONG STARTING
 SEQUENCE HIT THE >SPACEBAR< THE GAME WILL LOAD FASTER AND NO LOAD UP ALL THE
 CREDITS AND THE SCENE WITH BABY HERMAN.
ANOTHER FLAW IN THE PROGAM IS WHEN YOU ARE STUCK IN TRAFIC WITH CARS IN BOTH
LANES,BOTH CARS STOP! THE ONEY WY TO GET OUT OF IT IS TO KEEP HITTING THE CAR
IN FRONT OF YOU TILL YOU GET PAST IT OR JUMP OVER IT IF YOU CAN.
