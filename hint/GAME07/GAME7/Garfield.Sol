                  ======================================

Here's the complete solves to Garfield!  (Don't cheat unless you have to):
  Get the flashlight from the bedroom and eat the antiseed balls to stop
Odie from picking it up.  Collect the rubber bone and place it by the cat
flap.  When Odie appears, kick him at the flap to open it, allowing access
to other screens.
   Now head for the garden shed and fall through the hole in the floor.
Head down into the bowels of the sewer until you find Nermal.  Kick his ass
and he drops the mouse.  Let Odie pick it up.  Now go back up to the ground
level and drop the flashlight.  Get the mouse back from Odie.
    Take the mouse to the health food store and drop it near the shop
keeper, who then provides a spinach donut.  Send Garfield back into the
sewers and drop the donut in front of the giant rat.  The rat moves away
from the chest, allowing Garfield to kick it open (revealing a key within).
     Drop the key near the park bench, then return to the shed.  Take the
spade to the hardware store and a lucky dollar appears in exchange for the
tool.  Go back to the health food store and use the dollar to buy some bird
seed.
      Returning to the bench, drop the seed and pick up the key once more.
When the bird appears, jump up and hitch a ride to the City Pound.  It's
then simply a matter of folowing doors until Garfield is re-united with his
beloved Arlene!
