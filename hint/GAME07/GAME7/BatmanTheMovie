Bruce Wayne The multi- millionaire head of the Wayne Foundation is an
unassuming, quiet type of guy. However, when night falls and evil
stalks the street, he sheds his daytime persona and becomes the masked
vigilante of GOTHAM CITY  -   B A T M A N !
Crusading against crime from the rooftops of the sickened city, his
objective becomes the elimination of Gus Grisson's criminal empire; in
particular, the conquest of Jack Napier, the psychotic second-in-
command.
Napier was the most cunning and sadistic force in Gotham anyway, but
when an accident befell him, twisting him both physically and mentally,
he became the ultimate criminal  -  T H E  J O K E R !
You control BATMAN in five different scernarios as he is pitted against
his malevolent nemesis in the life or death struggles that ensue.

G A M E P L A Y

SECTION 1 - AXIS CHEMICAL PLANT
As BRUCE WAYNE, you overhear Commissioner Gordon telling the Mayor of
an attack on the Axis Chemical Plant by JACK NAPIER and his henchmen.
Acting swiftly, you put on your black costume and make your way to the
scene. Once inside the factory, you must move towards the exit (and
NAPIER) on the far right of the map. You will meet assorted criminals
along the way, some of whom will attack you physically, some will shoot
at you and some will throw grenades. Avoid also, leaking chemical
droplets and gas bursts at various points on your route. You can
sustain a limited amount of hits as your body armour affords a certain
degree of protection, but your energy can get depleted quite repidly if
you do not try to defend yourself.
Use the BATARANG to throw at your attackers, and your "batrope" to
access levels above, by shooting a grapnel device from your belt and
reeling yourself Up. On the final screen of this level, you will
confront NAPIER himself. If you defeat him, he will fall into a vat of
toxic chemical waste which will disfigure his appearance and mind. You
have created THE JOKER!

SECTION 2 - THE STREETS OF GOTHAM CITY (1)
Having rescued Vicky Vale from the clutches of THE JOKER in the
Flugelheim Museum, you must make goodyour escape in the BATMOBILE.
Racing at high speeds through the streets of GOTHAM CITY, you must
avoid both THE JOKER's vehicles and the police who have set up road
blocks, as they are still unsure which side of the law you are on.
Your BATMOBILE is equipped with a sphisticated radar ahich will
indicate the direction you must follow in order to escape safely. If
you do not maintain a high speed. THE JOKER will catch you up and
inflict damage upon the BATMOBILE, as will any collisions with other
cars.
 The BATMOBILE is also equipped with a rope and grapnet, If whilst
travelling a high speed, you wish to make a fast turn, shoot the
grapnet out at a lamppost on the street corner; if timed correctly,
this will enable you to make the turn without speed loss.

SECTION 3 - THE BATCAVE
The JOKER has invented a compound, "Smilex" which, on contact, will
kill its victims, leaving a deathly rictus grin on their faces. The
JOKER has 'spiked' certain everyday consumables with elements from
this compound which, when mixed together forms Smilex.
Using the powerful computer in your BATCAVE, you must, in the time
given, ascertain which three objects contain those elements. As you
select any three, the display will indicate how many of those you have
chosen correctly. You must, by process of elimination select the exact
trio of elements before the time runs out.

SECTION 4 - THE STREETS OF GOTHAM CITY(2)
THE JOKER's deadliest scheme is now taking place at midnight on the
Streets of GOTHAM CITY. By promissing massive handouts of money to the
people of Gotham, the streets are packed with masses of unsuspecting
citizens. However, all is not as it seems, for the carnival-type parade
contains a sinister secret.
Inside the dozens of bright balloons is enough Smilex gas to kill the
entire population of GOTHAM CITY. These balloons are about to be
leaked.....
You are piloting the BATWING and must cut through the mooring ropes of
the balloons with the wings of the flying craft. If you miss any of
them, they will self-destruct, sending clouds of gas into the crowds,
similarly if you miss the rope and hit the balloon itself, the same
will occur. If, however, you slice the rope, the balloon will float
harmlessly away where the gas will dissipate into the atmosphere.

SECTION 5 - THE CATHEDRAL
Pursuing THE JOKER to Gotham Cathedral, you must negotiate the
crumbling floors and avoid the rabid rats in order to confront,
finally, THE JOKER on the roof. As in the Chemical Factory, you must
use your BATARANG and 'batrope' to achieve this aim.
On the rooftop, you must defeat THE JOKER, or he will make his escape
by helicopter and bring GOTHAM CITY to its knees.
