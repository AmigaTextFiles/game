                   POLICE QUEST I SOLUTION

By THE KK CLUB. Edited by PARASITE.


     Police  Quest  is  a  very long Sierra, possibly even longer
than King's Quest III. Hence, the solution  file  is  also  long.
The ending sequence of the game is the longest ending sequence of
any  Sierra  up to this point and well worth watching. OK, enough
raving, on with the solution!

     You start the game in the Lytton Police Station. Go  to  the
room on the right (the briefing room). Use the door furthest away
from  you,  not the closer door (which leads to the locker room).
Within the briefing room, go to the pigeonhole second-closest  to
the  back  and LOOK HOLE. You will have received and read a note.

*** Your score is now 2 points. ***

     After reading the note, move to the rear right table and GET
PAPER, which you will automatically read.

*** Your score is now 7 points. ***

     Now, go to the front right table and stand at the left  side
of this table. This is your assigned position for briefings.

*** Your score is now 11 points. ***

     Now,  watch  the  action.  At  the end of the briefing, your
score will go up.

*** Your score is now 15 points. ***

     Leave the briefing room and enter  the  other  door  on  the
right,  to  the locker room. Go to your locker. Your locker is in
the right bank of lockers, second from the front.

OPEN LOCKER

*** Your score is now 16 points. ***

GET BELT

*** Your score is now 17 points. ***

GET AMMO

*** Your score is now 18 points. ***

GET CASE

*** Your score is now 19 points. ***

CLOSE LOCKER
OPEN CASE

*** Your score is now 20 points. ***

GET PEN

*** Your score is now 21 points. ***

GET NOTE BOOK

*** Your score is now 22 points. ***

GET TICKET BOOK

*** Your score is now 23 points. ***

CLOSE CASE
WRITE NOTE

     Write anything for a note -  it  doesn't  matter.  The  only
reason  you need to do this is because writing a note of any sort
is worth a point.

*** Your score is now 24 points. ***

     Now, leave the locker room. Go to the key board and GET KEY.

*** Your score is now 25 points. ***

     Go to the table, and GET RADIO.

*** Your score is now 27 points. ***

     Now, go left and then leave the next screen to the left. You
will now be in the car yard. The car assigned to you is the  left
front  car. Go to this car, and walk around the car until you get
a message saying that the car has been checked. You will need  to
do  this every time you take a car out  of  the  yard  (excluding
your  own  red corvette). If you forget, you will get a flat tire
shortly after leaving the yard.

*** Your score is now 32 points. ***

     Move to the front left door of the car (this is an  American
game  -  cars  drive  on  the right hand side of the road and the
driver sits on the left hand side of the car) and OPEN DOOR,  GET
IN and CLOSE DOOR. Then, GET NIGHTSTICK.

*** Your score is now 35 points. ***

     Now, GO (you can also press F4 to do the  same  thing),  and
the street map will appear.  This map is numbered as follows;

                           A1 A2 A3 A4
                           B1 B2 B3 B4
                           C1 C2 C3 C4
                           D1 D2 D3 D4

     and the Police Station is located at C3. It is a  good  idea
to  SAVE the game here, as it takes a while to locate yourself on
the map the first time, and  driving  the  car  also  takes  some
getting used to. Drive around for a while, avoiding map reference
B2,  until  Despatch  sends  you  a  message.  When  you get this
message, go to screen B2. In about the middle of the screen,  you
should  see a car which has hit a building. Drive up close to the
scene of the accident and your car will automatically stop.  When
it  has stopped, STOP (or F4) and you will go from the map screen
to a more normal picture.

*** Your score is now 38 points. ***

OPEN DOOR
GET OUT
CLOSE DOOR

Go to the man in the car which has crashed.

LOOK MAN

Now, go over to the crowd of onlookers.

TALK MAN
TALK MAN
CALL

     Despatch will send some other officers over to the scene  of
the  accident.  You  must  now wait for these officers to arrive.
When they arrive, your score will go up.

*** Your score is now 43 points. ***

     You can now go, so go back to your car, OPEN DOOR,  GET  IN,
CLOSE DOOR and GO.

     Now,  drive  around until Steve calls you. When he calls, go
to A3 and park near the cafe (spots where you can stop are fairly
obvious in this game). STOP and your score will rise.

*** Your score is now 46 points. ***

     Get out of the car and go into Carol's. Sit near  Steve  and
wait  for  the  phone  to  ring. When the phone rings, Carol will
answer it and say that it's for you. GET UP, go to the phone  and
USE PHONE.

*** Your score is now 48 points. ***

     Once  the  conversation  is finished, go back to the car and
drive around. Eventually, you will be `aching to write a ticket'.
When you are, go to a screen with a set of  traffic  lights  (eg.
A2)  and  you  will  see someone go through a red light. You must
chase this car. The way to chase and stop a  car  is  by  getting
precisely  behind  it  and then speeding up. The chased car  will
then automatically pull over and come to a stop, as will your own
car.

     You  have a choice of three driving speeds in Police Quest -
Code 1, Code 2 and Code 3.  Code  1  is  normal  driving  and  is
achieved  by  pressing  F6.   Code 2 is faster and is achieved by
pressing F8. Code 3 is police chase speed, with siren on  and  is
achieved by pressing F10. A police car travelling at Code 3 speed
can  go  through  red lights.  It is a very good idea to SAVE the
game before beginning a chase as pulling a car  over  takes  some
practise.

When you have pulled over the car, STOP.

*** Your score is now 52 points. ***

CALL

*** Your score is now 53 points. ***

Get out of your car and walk over to the sports car.

     You  can  try  letting the girl off, and ringing the number,
but you have been warned...

     After you have given the girl a ticket, go back to your  car
and  continue cruising the streets until Despatch tells you to go
to Carol's. Return  to  screen  A3  and  park.  Go  into  Carol's
Caffeine Castle, go up to the counter and TALK TO CAROL.

*** Your score is now 61 points. ***

     Leave  Carol's and go next door (Wino Willy's). Go up to the
head bikie and

passenger door and then close the doors. Always close  car  doors
when you are getting out of your car, or your car will be stolen.

     Walk  up  the steps of the jail with your prisoner and go up

this room.  Enter Dooley's office (the left door) and  watch  the
action  for  a  while,  then  leave Dooley's office.  You will be

to your car and drive back to the Police Station (C3).

the speech.

*** Your score is now 93 points. ***

     When the speech is over, go  to  your  pigeonhole  and  LOOK
HOLE.

*** Your score is now 96 points. ***

     Now,  leave  the briefing room and go to the key board.  GET
KEY.  Go to the table and GET RADIO. Go to the car yard  and  get
into  your  police car, first of all doing a walk-around check of
your car.

     Drive around until Despatch sends  you  a  message  about  a
stolen  car  in  your vicinity. SAVE the game here, especially if
you only have a CGA and start chasing the cars on the  screen  at
the  time  of the message. One of them will speed up when you get
close - this is the car that you are interested in chasing. Chase
this car until it pulls over and then STOP.

*** Your score is now 101 points. ***

for the jail (D3). Once at the jail, STOP.

     Get out of the car and let the suspect  out  as  well.  Make

     When Woody moves, follow him. When he wants  to  frisk  you,
move to his right and he will frisk you. Once inside the gambling
room,  go  to the table with two players and SIT DOWN.  Now, wait
for the fourth player to arrive, and the game will start.

     The quickest way to win is to bet up to the maximum on every
hand, saving if you win, restoring if you lose (the same  way  as
in  all  other  Sierras).  Once a hand has been completed, typing
DEAL will start the next hand.

Keep playing until the game ends (with you winning).
