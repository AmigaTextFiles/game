                HINTS & TIPS FOR SOME OLDIES!!

Typed in by PAUL B. Edited by PARASITE.


ARKANOID II
On the high score screen, type in the name  DEBBIE S
(with the space), and you'll have infinite lives.

BARBARIAN
Boot and run the game as usual, but at some point after the
game has started, type in:  04-08-59   ...It will make the
Barbarian character almost invincible, but he can still be
killed by very high falls, and by the flame-hurling horned
demon in the dungeon deep, pictured on the cover.

After you type  04-08-59  the screen will turn gray, telling
you that you're invincible.

Once you make it to Necron, you must have a shield.  Face
Necron when he turns to face you.  When he throws a fireball
at you, press the defense button as it hits your shield.

BARD'S TALE

How to hoard millions in gold without trying:  Load your
party, go to the stats screen for the first player.  Pool
all of the party's gold to the first player, then remove
him from the party, then load him back in.  Then pool the
gold to another player.  Repeat this for each player.

Then turn off the computer without saving the game.  Reboot
and ezch player will have gold equal to the TOTAL the party
had before.  Repeat if you're really greedy !

BETTER DEAD THAN ALIEN
If you are just about to be hit by an alien or a bomb, press
the ESC key to pause, move your ship out of the way, then
press  N  to resume the action.

Type  CHAMP  on the options screen, then press the  HELP
key.  You'll be shown a list of cheat keys.

DEFENDER OF THE CROWN
To get 1,024 Knights:  After conquering a territory, press
these four keys at the same time, while the drive is still
running:  H J K L  ... If you do it just right, you'll have
1,024 knights both in your home and in your army.  Hey, this
is good stuff!

Another way was reported in which to get 1,024 Knights, but
it doesn't seem to work:  After first picking the knight,
when Robin Hood appears, type PATTERSON over and over until
the map of England appears.  Don't press the Return key.
If this trick doesn't work the first time, try again.
I was only able to get this to work most of the time if,
before typing  PATTERSON  over and over, I first typed in
my name with no spaces:  GEORGEKNOCHEL   Yep, Twilight Zone!

DUNGEON MASTER
To advance Ninjas a level, stand in a hall and throw all
your weapons, then get them and repeat.  This also works
with magic and Fighter levels:  cast a spell at the air,
or slash and bash until you gain a level.

F/A-18 INTERCEPTOR
Select option "2 Free Flight, no enemy confrontation" from
the main menu.  Then select zero instead of 1 to 4.  The
screen will go into a spiral and scroll way south to 34 by
117 degrees, placing your plane somewhere without a runway.
To take off you have to use the afterburners.  117 degrees
is the furthest south you'll be able to fly, but you can go
in other directions.  (Is there more to this back door? hmm)

LEISURE SUIT LARRY
Press ALT and X at the same time to bypass the proof-of-age
questions.

STARGLIDER 1
Boot and play as usual until launched and ready to do
battle.  Then slow down until completely stopped in
space.  Press the F1 key to turn on the fixed sight, and
press the backspace key to pause the game.  Now type:
    js[space]arg[space]s     You should now be invincible!
You'll know you're in invincible mode when you can
repeatedly press the  P  key and get additional missiles (up
to 9).  If the password didn't take the first time, try
again.  To may have to dock and re-exit for it to work.
Once invincible, your fuel will remain constant and shields
will never be depleted.

Also, a secret built-in 3D object viewer running in the
background is available by pressing the  z  key once you've
entered the invincible mode.  Use the keyboard to pause [p],
select [, and .] and manipulate objects - use all keys
except q and ESC.  Use the mouse to change point of view
and magnification and hold down the right button.  ....
