 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1 This is the stage are. Here you will see everything that George sees!
 Double click on almost anything in the area to get a description of the
 object.  There may be more to see than you think! Try to look at as
 many objects as possible.  When you want to leave the area, click on
 one of the exits twice, or do the same in the layout area.

2 This is the Narration Area, Everything that happens in the game is
 described here. Sometimes there will be more text then can fit inside
 the window. (See Scrolling.) Allways be sure to check both the stage
 area and the Naration area: Dont Depend on one alone for all your
 information

3 This is the CAST area. Since you are playing George, he is allways
  shown in the first box. Whenever there is someone else in the area,
  that persons portrait will appear in one of the boxes.  Click twice
  on the portrait to get a description of the person, or to talk to
  them. Note that not everyone will want to talk to you.

4 This is the ACTIONS area. Whenever there is an opportunity to talk
  to someone, or perform a unique action, the choices will  be
  displayed here.  You only need to click once on an action; clicking
  twice may result in choosing two actions. BE CAREFULL!

5 This is the layout area. It shows an overhead view of the area George
  is currently in. Red circles indicate obvious exits. Double clicking
  on one of these dots will usually take George through, but sometimes
  the doors are locked, or the way is otherwise blocked off.

6 This is the command buttons area.  There are several command buttons
  for George to use. Each command has a symbol as shown below:

[   -><-   ]  INTERACT
 This command allows george to interact with objects and to use objects on
other things. For example: If you want george to use the visaphone, click
on George in the cast area, then click on the interact command, and then
on the visaphone.  The most obvious operation between the two objects
will be preformed and the action reflected in the narration area.

[ Eyeball ]  Look
 If you would like to examine an object more closely, click on the object
and use this command.  A description will appear in the narration window.
It is a good idea to look at everything in the stage area.

[ Up Arrow ]  Go
 This command will attempt to take George to any position selected in the
stage area.  For instance, clicking on go when a door is selected will
usually take George through that door.

[ Box With Top Open ]  Open
 If you want to look inside something, first click on the object, then on
the open command, a window similar to the inventory window will open up
to show you what other objects are contained within.  Note that not all
objects can be looked inside and some thing may be locked.

[ Box with top closed ]  Close
 To close something you have opened, or anything else closable, simply
click on the object and then this command.  If the open object has an
objects window, you can close the object by clicking on the close
button in the upper left corner of the window.

[ Hand on top droping object into hand on bottom ]  Give
 This command allows you to pass objects reasonably between two people.
Example:  if you want to give some money to Jane, select Jane, then
click on the give button, and then on the money.  The money will
disappear from the inventory area, and the result will be reflected
in the narration area.

7  This is the inventory area.  If you want to take oan object with you,
try to drag it over this area.  It might be to big, or you might have to
put something down first!  If you want to look inside soemthing you have
in your inventory (like a brief case), just click on it and then click on
the open button.

SHORT CUTS
You can save time from selecting commands by clicking twice on any object,
door, or character portrait.  Doing this on an object will give you a
description of that object; doing it on a door will take you through that
door; while clicking twice on a portrait will give you a description of
that character and possibly allow you to talk to him.

SAVING AND LOADING GAMES

Choose save and give your game a name at the requester.  When you want to
return to this game, simply choose load from the menu, and select the
name you gave it.

SCROLLING
Sometimes there is more information than can fit inside a specific area.
Then it is necessary to scroll the hidden information into view.  Here
are the areas that use scrolling, and how it is performed:
