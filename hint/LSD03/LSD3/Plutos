Mission Information :-
On loading, press 1 for one player, or 2 for two players.

You start the game with four lives, with new lives being awarded
throughout the game.

All objects destroyed yield a score of 50, except the 500-point
objects (which are marked as such). Some objects require more than
one hit to be destroyed. Beware of tall buildings and pyramids, as
collisions with these is possible.

Keep fuel topped up by shooting fuel dumps.
The '?' symbol, when hit sufficiently, gives a one in four chance
of yielding an extra life.

Space Bar toggles pause on and off.

You cannot progress onto te next stage unless you bling the
sentinel by destroying its eyes. If you fail, the current stage is
repeated. If you succeed, 5000 points and an extra life is
awarded.

Two-player action is simultaneous - the players cannot shoot each
other, but otherwise compete for fuel and points. Fuel consumption
is halved whilst both players are alive.
