                   Kings Quest IV - The Perils of Rosella

Typed in by ???. Edited by PARASITE.


           This is the legend of King's Quest...

           Once,  In a kingdom called Daventry  there  lived  a  King  named
           Edward.  Daventry was a very old kingdom, and it had its share of
           kings,  both good and bad,  over thousands of years.  King Edward
           was  a  very  good  King,  but he was also very old,  and without
           children.  Disorder ruled the land since the loss  of  the  Three
           Great   Treasures.   King   Edward  feared  that  disorder  might
           degenerate further once he died.  Besides,  he knew (as well  did
           his  people) that without an heir to the throne the kingdom would
           be in dire  straits  indeed.  This,  King  Edward  sent  for  his
           favorite knight, Sir Graham.

           You are the bravest and most trustworthy of my knights,  quick of
           wit and stout of hear.  I have chosen you to succeed me as  king,
           but first you must prove yourself worthy of my crown.  Far beyond
           the walls of this castle lie shrouded the Three  Great  Treasures
           of  Daventry,  stolen  years  ago  by  stealth and sorcery.  This
           kingdom will not be restored to its former glory  and  prosperity
           until  these  great  treasures  are  returned  to  their rightful
           hearth.  Succeed in this my request,  and the crown shall  become
           yours  upon my death.  Fall,  and our once beautiful kingdom will
           fall to the hands of evil forces who will use the powerful  magic
           of the Three Great Treasures against us.

           "May you return victorious, Sir Graham!"

           Thus  Sir  Graham  ventured where most humankind dared not tread,
           and returned home victorious  with  the  cherished  Treasures  of
           Daventry, as is chronicled in the tale Quest For The Crown.

           Now Graham ruled over the land,  with the aid of the Magic Mirror
           and the other Great Treasures of Daventry. The people of Daventry
           prospered greatly under the reign  of  the  kindly  monarch.  But
           peace and prosperity can become quite dull for valiant Kings. Not
           more  than  a week after the third anniversary of his appointment
           to the throne (on the eve of King Edward's death) did King Graham
           begin to feel the pangs of loneliness.

           Fate would have it that Graham was standing  next  to  the  Magic
           Mirror  as  he  pondered  his  plight.  As he glanced towards the
           Mirror, he noticed that the glass had grown inexplicable cloudy.

           As the  mist  cleared,  Graham  beheld  the  image  of  the  most
           beautiful  maiden  he  had  ever seen.  She stood glancing from a
           window, motionless except for stray breeze that stirred her hair.
           A tear fell from one eye,  and  sparkled  on  her  cheek  like  a
           diamond on velvet.

           Seel How the tears run down her face.  Oh,  that I were the glove
           upon the hand that  could  brush  away  such  sorrow!"  exclaimed
           Graham.

           The  Kings  heart  was suddenly intoxicated with longing for this
           maiden-indeed this was the women ho must be his Queen.

           "Oh Mirror wise," said Graham,  "I have vowed to make this maiden
           my bride. Where may I find her?"

           The Mirror clouded once more,  and a voice spoke forth.  "This is
           the maiden Valanice.  She is from the kingdom of Kolyma,  and  is
           known for her goodness no less than her beauty. The jealous crone
           Magatha   whisked  Valanice  away  to  an  enchanted  land,   and
           imprisoned her in a quartz tower guarded by a ferocious beast. To
           rescue Valanice, you must travel to the kingdom of Kolyma,  where
           you  may  search for the keys which unlock the three doors to the
           enchanted land..."

           As the tale is told,  King Graham did indeed find the three magic
           keys,  and  faced  the battles that led to the safe rescue of the
           beautiful maiden Valanice,  The full  account  of  King  Graham's
           search  for  his  bride  is  chronicled in the tale Romancing The
           Throne.

           King Graham married the beautiful girl he had  rescues,  and  two
           years  later the young Queen Valanice gave birth to twins,  a boy
           and a girl.  Alexander bore a striking resemblance to his father,
           and likewise Rosella to her mother. The family lived a very happy
           and peaceful life...at least for awhile.

           But  from  deep  within  the forests came rumblings of a terrible
           beast who was  ravaging  a  bloody  trail  towards  the  land  of
           Daventry.  Sightings  of  dragons had been rare in these tranquil
           times,  and never before in  the  kingdom  of  Daventry  had  one
           witnessed  such  a beast as the terrible three-headed dragon.  As
           the years crept by the notoriety of the beast grew  as  great  as
           the destruction it wrought. Soon the whole population of Daventry
           tremored  with  the  news  of  the  dragon's  approach,  and each
           homestead dwelt in terror.

           Meanwhile,  in a land  far  away,  lived  the  malevolent  wizard
           Manannan.  Manannan  kept  a  watchful  eye  upon kingdoms of the
           world. With a sardonic grin he watched as the three-headed dragon
           rampaged its way towards Daventry.  Manannan's hatred of  mankind
           ad intensified with his great age, and his coal-black eyes burned
           a  strange  reflection  upon  the  glass  of  the  crystal  as he
           mirthfully watched another human swallowed whole by  the  vicious
           beast.

           Preferring  his solitude,  the powerful Manannan was only allowed
           to be observed by one servant-boy,  who maintained his house  and
           performed  all  of his menial chores.  Of course,  Manannan could
           have conjured up spirits to  do  his  dirty  work,  but  he  much
           preferred  to see the toll and strain of a young mortal suffering
           under his thrall.

           Most would call it depravity,  but it was fear  that  fueled  the
           flames  of  Manannan's hatred of humanity,  a fear instilled by a
           vision from his prophetic crystal ball.  For within its walls  of
           quartz had Manannan seen his own hideous destruction at the hands
           of a conquering hero.

           Time  has  wrought  many  changes  and  with it much sorrow.  The
           kingdom of Daventry was ravaged by  the  deplorable  dragon,  and
           they young Princess Rosella was abducted.  The entire kingdom was
           overcome by  the  brutal  onslaught  of  the  beast,  and  though
           forewarned,  found  themselves  helpless  to  defend  against its
           supernatural  strength.   Much  weeping  and  wailing  was  heard
           throughout the land.  Even with its power of prophecy,  the Magic
           Mirror could provide no answers, not even a clue, for some bearer
           of black magic had cast a cloud of darkness upon its face...

           And the wizard watched with eyes of venom...

           The entire tale of Rosella's rescue,  the wizard's downfall,  and
           the restoration of the royal family are chronicled in the saga To
           Heir is Human.

           According  to legend,  shortly after Rosella's rescue King Graham
           decided it was time to pass on his adventurer's cap. Gathering in
           his wife and two children,  the King  offered  a  grateful  smile
           upwards, for each member of his family had given him great pride.
           Gazing  down at his children,  he couldn't help but see the glint
           of spirited valor in  their  eyes.  Knowing  the  future  of  his
           kingdom  would  rest soundly in the hands of its future heir,  he
           slowly lifted his hands to display the infamous adventurer's cap.

           And now the commencement of the noblest adventure of all...

           quest.  Fail,  and your loved ones will  die,  and  you  will  be
           stranded in a strange land for the rest of your life.

TIPS FOR NEW ADVENTURE PLAYERS
           Note:  If  you  have  played  an Animated Adventure before,  this
           section can be skipped.

           1. HOW TO MOVE AROUND
              Basic instructions on how  to  interact  with  this  game  are
              included on the reference card enclosed. For those who are not
              sure  of what to,  there is a WALK THRU included at the end of
              this manual

           2. STAY OUT OF DANGER
              Due to the dangerous nature of this adventure game,  you  will
              want  to  save your game often.  Type SAVE GAME after you have
              made important progress.  Type SAVE GAME when you encounter  a
              potentially dangerous situation.

              If  you  do  encounter  danger,  and you character suffers and
              unfortunate accident (such as death),  you  can  type  RESTORE
              GAME  to  return  to the place you were at when you last saved
              your game. Careful use of this function has saved many gallant
              knights from returning to lowly peasant status.

           3. BE OBSERVANT
              Look at and examine everything you can.  When you enter a  new
              location  type LOOK AROUND.  When you open a box type OPEN THE
              BOX.  If you want to see the contents of the box type LOOK  IN
              THE BOX. When you want to talk to a fisherman type TALK TO THE
              FISHERMAN.  The descriptions and close-ups offered may provide
              valuable clues.

           4. MAP YOUR PROGRESS
              Draw a map that includes each place you visit,  objects found,
              dangerous areas, and every landmark you see along the way. Try
              not  to  miss any area,  or you may miss and important clue or
              item necessary to the completion of your  quest.  Also,  don't
              think that because you've been somewhere once,  it will be the
              same next time.  The people of Tamir  (and  other  places  you
              might  visit)  can  move  around  as  well  as  you (some even
              better).

           5. BRING ALONG SOME HELP
              The Land of Tamir can be terrifying at night.  You may find it
              helpful  to play with a friend.  Different people come up with
              different  ways  to  interpret  clues,   and   besides,   most
              adventurers work in teams.

           6. ARM YOURSELF WITH THE PROPER VERBS

           7. LEAVE NO STONE UNTURNED
              There's  much more to a 3-D Animated Adventure Game than meets
              the eye.  Try any action you can think of-even the  forbidden.
              No one every served a stretch of time on the rack from playing
              computer  games.  If you do run into serious trouble,  you can
              always resort back to your RESTORE GAME function.

           8. AT THE END OF YOUR ROPE?
              If you've tried every possible trick in  the  book  and  still
              can't  get  anywhere,  don't panic.  Even the most stalwart of
              adventures have been caught in the midst of a confusion spell.
