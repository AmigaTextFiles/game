                          SPACE ACE SOLUTION

By DEPECHE MODE. Edited by PARASITE.


        First of all I would like to say that This game even though it has
a better routine and more scenes, that it ain't as good as i though it would
be. It was missing alot of scenes from the real game.The Motorcycle,
Rollerskate, the underwater scenes was all gone.. Your Dont even
get to see Dexter turn into SPACE ACE.However, I enjoyed the game and since I
didn't even have to pay for it, it was worth it. I bet I was the first one to
solve this. As A matter of fact it took me only 2 hours. I know their are
people that just can't stand not finishing  a game, So heres the solution...
  NOTE: the MOVES WORK! If you mess up Try Waiting a second or two, since
a lot of scenes involve timing. I will try and point out the scenes that
needs some timing moves..

  1)The First Scene is very easy,the manual even told ya how to do it,
    but there's always people who dont like to read, or can't even read
    at all!
      A)RIGHT to jump to the rock
      B)LEFT to Dodge the laser
      C)DOWN to jump back to rock (WHY DOWN?? stupid readysoft)
  2)The Is the Scene with Floating Robot that crushes the rocks.
      A)RIGHT to dodge the crusher
      B)LEFT (wait until the Crusher goes up, that was a tuffy)
      C)LEFT (this is a timing move,the best way to do is to wait until you
              see 3 pieces of rocks get crushed,then LEFT)
      D)LEFT (wait until the Crusher goes up)
      E)LEFT to Exit the scene (i'm not sure if this move is needed, but just
                                in Case)
  3)This is the Scene with the Space Ships shooting at you
      A)DOWN to dodge
      B)UP to dodge

    part of the game for me?? hehehe)

                          see a Exit at the Middle LEFT,However dont Press
                          left right away,Wait until your near the middle
                          then Press Left!)
      C)RIGHT to dodge ray(this is the scene with the Mirror! Almost there!)
 11)Right after you dodge his ray at the mirror scene,he will shoot
     again and this time its the last 2 moves of the game!
     You will see a mirror after he shoots,this is what you do
      A)LEFT to push mirror towards the Ray
      B)RIGHT to Dodge Ray (note:wait until you push the mirror into the
