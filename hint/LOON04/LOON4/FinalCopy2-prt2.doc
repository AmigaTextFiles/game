				  PART 2



 TO APPLY A STYLE:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1. To apply a style to a single paragraph, click the mouse in the
    paragraph you want to apply the style to. To apply a style to several
    consecutive paragraphs, drag the mouse through the paragraphs you
    want to apply the style to.

 2. Choose the desired style from the "Styles" menu, or press the FKey
    function that has been assigned to the style.

    Any text in the paragraph(s) you have selected will be redrawn in the
    new style. If "No Style" is selected from the "Styles" menu, any
    style name currently assigned to the text will be removed. While
    doing this will have no affect on the text's current settings, it
    will keep future changes to that text's original style from affecting
    the text any more.


 TO DEFINE A NEW STYLE:  See fig 7-21
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1. Select "Define" from the "Styles" menu.

    The "Define Styles" requester will appear.

 2. Click on the button labelled "New".

    The "Edit Style" requester will appear.

 3. Click in the data entry area under the word "Name", and replace the
    words "New Style" with the name you want to call the style.

 4. To define paragraph settings, click on the "Para..." button under the
    word "Setting".

    The "Paragraph" requester will appear. Instructions for using this
    requester appear earlier in this chapter.

 5. To define tab settings, click on the "Tabs..." button under the word
    "Settings".

    The "Tabs" requester will appear. Instruction for using this
    requester can be found in the next section of this chapter.

 6. To define type settings, click on the "Type..." button under the word
    "Setting".

    The "Type Specs" requester will appear. Instructions for using this
    requester appear earlier in this chapter.

 7. Click on the appropriate buttons in the "Style Applies" section of
    the requester.

    This will tell Final Copy which of the settings to actually apply to
    the style. For example, if the "Type Settings" button is turned off,
    the style will not affect any aspects of type specs. If all three
    buttons are turned on, the style will utilize the full range of
    definitions.

 8. If you want to assign a function key to the style, make sure the
    check box "Assign" inside the "FKey Assignment" area is checked, and
    indicate which FKey you want to assign.

    You can use the F1 - F10 function keys to access a style. Unshifted
    and ALT function keys are reserved for ARexx macros, and can not be
    assigned to styles.

 9. If you want to save the current styles as the program's default
    styles for future documents, check the "Set Default" box in the lower
    left corner of the requester.


 10. Click on "OK".

     The newly defined style will now appear on the list of available
     type styles in the "Styles" menu.

    The "Edit Style" requester will appear.

 4. Make any desired changes to name, setting, and style applications.
    Also make appropriate adjustments in the "Style Applies" section of
    the requester.

 5. If you want to save the current styles as the program's default
    styles for future documents, check the "Set Default" box in the lower
    left corner of the requester.

 6. Click on "OK".

    The edited style will now appear on the list of available type styles
    in the "Styles" menu.


 TO REMOVE AN EXISTING STYLE:  See fig 7-21
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1. Select "define" from the "Styles" menu.

    The "define Styles" requester will appear showing a list of style
    names.

 2. Click on the name of the style you wish to remove.

 3. Click on the "Remove" button.

 4. If you want to save the current styles as the program's default
    styles for future documents, check the "Set Default" box in the lower
    left corner of the requester.

 5. Click on "OK" when you are finished removing styles.


		       USING THE "TABS" REQUESTER
 When you click on the "Tabs..." button in the "Settings" area of the
"Edit Style" requester, the "Tabs" requester will appear. Within this
requester is a list of existing tab stops and a series of action buttons

that you use to define new, edit existing, and remove existing tab stops
from a style. Only 8 tab stops may be defined for a style.

 TO DEFINE A NEW TAB STOP:  See fig 7-24

    list of tab stops showing the tab stop you want to modify.

 2. Modify the default settings to what you wish them to be.

 3. Click on the "OK" button when you are finished defining the style's
    tab stops.


 TO REMOVE AN EXISTING TAB STOP:  See fig 7-24
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1. Access the "tabs" requester and click the mouse on the line in the
    list of tab stops showing the tab stop you want to remove.

 2. Click on the "OK" button when you are finished removing the style's
tab stops.


			      MASTER PAGES
 A master page is a place in a Final Copy document where you define text
and graphics that are to appear on each of your document's pages. There
are many uses for master pages, including document titles, chapter names,
special graphics, dates, page backgrounds, headers, footers and page
borders.

**** See fig 7-26 *****

 Every time a new document is created, blank master pages are also
created. If you leave master pages blank, they will have no effect on the
body text and/or graphics on a master page, those items will appear on
each page of your document except the optional title page.

 If you have set the "Left/Right" page option (See Chapter 4), the left
master page will be used for items that are to be repeated on left-sided
pages, and the right master page will be used for items on right-sided
pages. If you have not set the "Left/Right" page option, only items
entered on the right master page will affect your pages.

 Master pages are accessed through the page icons in the horizontal ruler
at the top of a document window. There are three page icons -- left
master, right master, and body. Clicking on the left or right master page
icon will bring the appropriate master page up on your screen. Clicking
on the body page icon will return you to the body of your document.


TO DEFINE LEFT AND/OR RIGHT MASTER PAGES:  See fig 7-26
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1. Click on either the left or right master page icon in the ruler.

    The selected master page will appear.

    NOTE. When you are editing a master page, the window title will show
    which master page is being edited.

 2. Enter any text or graphics you wish to include as master items.

    Remember that any text or graphics placed on a left master page will
    appear on every left-sided page of a document. Similarly, any text or
    graphics entered on a right master page will appear on every right
    page of your document. If you are not using the "Left/Right" page
    option (See Page Setup - Chapter 4), nothing you enter in the left
    master page will appear on your body pages.


			   HEADERS AND FOOTERS
 There are a number of ways in which you may utilize a header or footer.
The most common use for headers and footers is for page numbering. Other
common uses are for inserting the date and time that the document was
written or printed, and for running headlines at the top of each page.

 In Final Copy you create headers and footers inside a master page. At
the top of a master page you place header items, and at the bottom of the
same master page, you place any footer items.

 Final Copy is a word processor where text must be entered sequentially
from the top of the first page down through a document. This is in
contrast to desktop-publishing programs that allow you to start a text
block wherever you want it. For example, in a desktop-publishing program,
if you want to place text at the bottom of the page, you start a new text
block at the bottom of a page. In a word-processor, however, you need to
advance the insertion point to the bottom of the page by pressing the
RETURN key or by entering text. Therefore, when you want to place a
footer at the bottom of a Final Copy master page, you advance the
insertion point to the bottom of the master page.

 When you use a master page to define header and footer items, you will
probably not want text you enter on a body page to be placed on top of
the header and footer items. In order to accomplish this, you will need
to limit the size of the "Body" area of your page by specifying the
height you are using for header and footer areas
See Chapter 4 - Headers and footers).

**** See fig 7-26 ****



			       PAGE BREAKS
 Page breaks will occur naturally as you type your document. Final Copy
inserts a page break whenever it gets to the end of a page. You may also
manually insert page breaks at any place in your document.

 TO INSERT A PAGE BREAK:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1.  Set the insertion point where you want the page break to appear in
     your document.

 2. Choose "Insert Page Break" from the "Page" menu.


 TO REMOVE A PAGE BREAK:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1. Set the insertion point at the beginning of the line of text
    immediately following the page break you want to remove.

 2. Choose "Remove Page Break" from the "Page" menu.

    If the "Remove Page Break" menu item is disabled, it is because you
    did not set the insertion point in the paragraph immediately
    following a forced page break.

			  WORKING WITH GRAPHICS

 Nothing adds interest to a word processing document like carefully
created, well placed graphic. Graphics that can be used in Final Copy
are:

 * Diagonal, horizontal, and vertical lines
 * Arrow-tipped lines
 * Boxes and perfect squares
 * Rounded-corner boxes and prefect squares
 * Oval and perfect circles
 * IFF ILBMs

 Text can flow automatically flow around any of the above graphics
according to your instructions.

 Each graphic in Final Copy is treated as an independent object and may
be deleted, sized, or moved according to your needs.

 In this chapter are instructions to help you:

 * Create graphics
 * Insert IFF ILBM graphics
 * Change graphic settings
 * Select graphics
 * Delete graphics
 * Size graphics
 * Move graphics
 * Specify exact size and position of graphics
 * Crop graphics
 * Cancel graphic operation


			   SETTING REQUESTERS
 There are four settings requesters each corresponding to one of the
graphic types supported in Final Copy. These requesters are:

 * IFF ILBM Settings
 * Line Setting
 * Box settings
 * Oval Setting

 These requesters may be used in several different ways:

 * Set permanent default values for a type of graphic object. When a new
   document is created these default values define the attributes for
   graphic objects placed in documents.

 * Set temporary default values for a type of graphic object. When a new
   graphic object is created, these temporary default values are used as
   the attributes for the objects, however the permanent default values
   remain the same.

 * Reset the attributes of existing objects. Attributes of any existing
   graphic object can be modified at any time.


		    CREATING LINES, BOXES, AND OVALS
 Graphic elements like (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal),
rectangles/squares, and ovals/circles may be created in your document
using the tool icons found in the command strip at the top of the window.

**** See fig 8-2 ****

 When you create a graphic Final Copy creates it using the default
settings for the type of graphic being created. For example, if the
default settings for a line are 2 points thick and coloured red, when you
draw a new line, it will be drawn as a 2 point, red line. You can, of
course, change a graphic`s current or default settings at any time.

 You have two choices of how a new graphic is to be drawn when you create
it. One choice is to set the default settings to the way you want the
graphic drawn, and then create the graphic. The other choice is to just
create the graphic using the default settings, and then after the graphic
is drawn, change its settings to suit your needs. In the instructions
that follow for creating graphics, the default setting are defined, and
then the graphic is created.


				  LINES
 In Final Copy you can draw lines at any angle, and with any thickness
ranging from hairline (thinnest at any given resolution) to 12 points.
Lines may be created in any of the 16 colours defined in Colour
Preferences. Text can be made to flow around or on top of lines. A
special option allows you to create a line with an arrow at one of the
line`s end points.

 TO DRAW A LINE:  See fig 8-3
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1. Select "Line Settings" from the "Graphics" menu.

    The "Line Setting" requester will appear. Below are brief
    descriptions of the options presented in the requester.

    TEXT FLOW OPTIONS - This defines the way in which text is to flow
    around (or over) a graphic element. Text may flow on the left or
    right side of a graphic, following either the graphic`s contour or a
    vertical line created by the graphic`s frame. If the "None" option is
    selected, the graphic will become a back ground element, and the text
    will flow over it.

    TEXT FLOW DISTANCE - This specifies the amount of space between the
    graphic and the text that flows next to it. For example, a setting of
    0.25 will leave 1/4" of empty space between a graphic and the text
    flowing around it. The minimum flow distance is 1/8" (0.125).

    LINE COLOUR - This defines the line`s colour when it is printed. To
    specify a different colour, click the mouse on the desired colour`s
    name in the list.

    LINE WEIGHT - This defines the thickness of the line.

 2. Reset any of the requester values to match the way you want the line
    to be created.

 3. Click "OK".

 4. Click on the desired line tool icon in the ruler at the top of your
    window.

    The "New Line" tool will produce perfectly horizontal, vertical, or
    45 degree diagonal lines. The "New Free Line" tool will produce
    diagonal lines at any angle. NOTE. The two line tools are only for
    your convenience in drawing a new line. Once a line is drawn, you can
    change its angle no matter which tool you used to create it.

 5. Position the mouse pointer at the place in your document where you
    wish your line to begin.

 6. Hold the mouse button down and drag the mouse in the direction you
    want the line to be drawn.

 7. Once the line has reached the desired length, release the mouse
    button.

    A line of the width and colour selected has now been placed  in your
    document. Any existing on your page will flow around (or over) the
    line based on your "Line Flow" settings.

 TO DRAW AN ARROW-TIPPED LINE:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1. Follow the steps above for drawing a line except that in step #6,
    hold the LEFT ALT key before pressing the mouse button, and continue
    to hold the ALT key down while dragging the mouse.

    The size of the arrow depends upon the thickness of the line. The
    arrow will draw on the end where the mouse is released.


				  BOXES
 Final Copy lets you create boxes in any width and height combination. a
box can have a line as a border, and can be filled with a colour, or left
empty. Special option for boxes are the ability to make boxes with
rounded corners and/or perfect squares.

 TO DRAW A BOX:  See fig 8-4
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1. Select "Box Settings" from the "Graphics" menu.

 2. Modify any of the settings in the requester to match the way you want
    the box drawn.

 3. Click on the "OK".

 4. Click on the "New Box" tool icon.

 5. Position the mouse pointer at the place in your document where you
    wish your box`s corner to begin.

 6. While holding the mouse button down, drag the mouse in the proper
    direction to draw the box.

 7. Once the box has reached the desired size and shape, release the
    mouse button.

 TO DRAW A ROUNDED-CORNERED BOX:  See fig 8-4
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1. Follow the above steps above for drawing a box except that in step
    #6, hold the LEFT ALT key before pressing the mouse button, and
    continue to hold the ALT key down while dragging the mouse.

 TO DRAW A PERFECT SQUARE:  See fig 8-4
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1. Follow the above steps above for drawing a box except that in step
    #6, hold the LEFT SHIFT key before pressing the mouse button, and
    continue to hold the SHIFT key down while dragging the mouse.

 TO DRAW A PREFECT SQUARE WITH ROUNDED-CORNERS:  See fig 8-4
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1. Follow the above steps above for drawing a box except that in step
    #6, hold the LEFT ALT and the LEFT SHIFT key before pressing the
    mouse button, and continue to hold the ALT and SHIFT key down while
    dragging the mouse.


OVALS
 Final Copy lets you create ovals in any width and height combination. An
oval can have a line as a border, and can be filled with a colour, or
left empty. A special option for ovals is the ability to make ovals as
perfect circles.

 TO DRAW AN OVAL:  See fig 8-6
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1. Select "Oval Settings" from the "Graphics" menu.

 2. Modify any of the settings in the requester to match the way you want
    the box drawn.

 3. Click on the "OK".

 4. Click on the "New Oval" tool icon.

 5. Position the mouse pointer at the place in your document where you
    wish your box`s corner to begin.

 6. While holding the mouse button down, drag the mouse in the proper
    direction to draw the oval.

 7. Once the box has reached the desired size and shape, release the
    mouse button.

 TO DRAW A PERFECT CIRCLE:  See fig 8-6
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1. Follow the above steps above for drawing a oval except that in step
    #6, hold the LEFT SHIFT key before pressing the mouse button, and
    continue to hold the SHIFT key down while dragging the mouse.


		       IMPORTING IFF ILBM GRAPHICS
 In addition to graphics drawn with Final Copy`s drawing tools, you may
also import pictures and brushes created by other programs as long as
they have been created in the Amiga graphic format IFF ILBM. This format
is used in various paint and digitizing programs, HAM, Extra Halfbrite,
and 24 bit IFf ILBMs may also be imported.

 IFF ILBM graphics may be inserted before or after text is entered. Text
will always reformat to flow around a graphic according to that graphic`s
text flow settings.

		       INSERTING IFF ILBM GRAPHICS
 Any picture or brush may be inserted in a Final Copy document as long as
it is in IFf ILBM graphic format.

 TO INSERT AN IFF ILBM GRAPHIC:  See fig 8-7
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1. Select "IFF ILBM Settings" from the "Graphics" menu.

    Final Copy will display the "Iff ILBM Settings" requester.

    Included in the requester are the following settings:

    TEXT FLOW OPTIONS - This defines the way in which text is to flow
    around (or over) a graphic element. Text may flow on the left or
    right side of a graphic, following either the graphic`s contour or a
    vertical line created by the graphic`s frame. If the "None" option is
    selected, the graphic will become the background element, and text
    will flow over it.

    TEXT FLOW DISTANCE - This specifies the amount of space between text
    and a graphic. For example, a setting of 0.25 will leave 1/4" of
    empty space between a graphic and the text flowing around it. The
    minimum flow distance is 1/8 (0.125).

    BORDER WEIGHT - If you want Final Copy to draw a border around the
    imported graphic, set this value to the weight, or thickness, you
    want a line to be.

    BORDER COLOUR - The colour of the border.

    SAVE/LINK OPTION - The "Save graphic" option actually stores a copy
    of the inserted IFF ILBM graphic in your document. The "Save link"
    option does not save the graphic itself in your document, but rather
    saves a link to that graphic. However, when you open your document,
    the graphic will also be opened through the link and will appear on
    the page where you have placed it. The "Save link" option is helpful
    when your graphics takes up a great deal of memory, or when you
    anticipate changing your graphic before your document reaches its
    final draft stage. In this latter instance, the link will open the
    revised graphic and insert it when you reopen your document.

    BACKGROUND - The background of an IFfILBM graphic can be treated as
    solid or transparent. If the background is transparent, the picture`s
    "transparent" colour (usually colour 0) will not be used when
    rendering the graphic. If you plan to wrap text to the contour of a
    graphic, you will want to make the background transparent. If a HAM
    graphic was clipped as a brush, it will use the shape of the brush
    for the transparency.

 2. Modify any of the settings in the requester to match the way you want
    the graphic drawn.

 3. Click on "OK".

 4. Choose "Insert IFF ILBM" from the "Graphics" menu.

    A file requester will appear on your screen.

 2. Use the file requester to locate the graphic you want to import.

 3. When you have located the graphic you want to insert, click on its
    name to select it.

 4. Click on "OK"

    The graphic will be drawn in the upper left corner of the screen.
    When the graphic is inserted it is already selected. You can move,
    size, and crop it to suit your needs.


			   SELECTING GRAPHICS
 In order to size, move, crop, delete, or redefine a graphic you must
first select it.

 TO SELECT A SINGLE GRAPHIC:  See fig 8-2
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1. Click the mouse on the "Graphic Select" tool.

 2. Click the mouse on the graphic you want to select.

    Notice that "anchor points" (tiny boxes in the corner and midpoints
    of the graphic) appear around or on the graphic. On an IFF ILBM
    graphic, these anchor points will appear on a boarder surrounding the
    graphic. On lines, boxes, and ovals, the anchor points will appear
    directly on the image. The presence of anchor points indicates that a
    graphic has been selected, and the anchor points may be used to size
    and crop an image (explained later).


 TO SELECT ONE OR MORE GRAPHICS
 BY DRAWING A MARQUEE:	    See fig 8-2
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1. Click the mouse on the "Graphic Select" tool.

 2. Position the mouse pointer above and to the left of the first graphic
    you want to select.

 3. Hold down the left mouse button and drag the mouse to the right and
    bottom of the last graphic you want to select.

    As you drag the mouse the program will draw a marquee rectangle on
    the screen. When you release the mouse, all graphics that fit within
    the marquee will be selected.

 4. Release the button.


			    DELETING GRAPHICS
 Graphics in your document may be deleted at any time.

 TO DELETE GRAPHIC(S):
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1. Select the graphic(s) you wish to delete.

 2. Press the BACKSPACE or DELETE key, choose "Delete" from the
    "Graphics" menu.

    The selected graphic will be deleted.


			     SIZING GRAPHICS
 A graphic already inserted in a document can be made smaller or larger
at any time. When you make an IFF ILBM smaller, it may appear to lose
resolution (dots) on the screen, but on printouts you probably won`t lose
any resolution.

 TO CHANGE THE SIZE OF A GRAPHIC IN YOUR DOCUMENT:  See fig 8-2
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1. Select the graphic to be sized.

 2. Press and hold the mouse on one of the anchor points at the corners
    or midpoints of the selected graphic.

 3. Drag the mouse inward toward the middle of the graphic to reduce its
    size. Drag the mouse outwards away from the middle of the graphic to
    increase its size.

 4. Release the mouse when the graphic has reached the desired size.


		     CONSTRAINED SIZING OF IFF ILBMs

 OPTION 1 If you hold the SHIFT key down while pressing on an IFF ILBM`s
	  anchor point and continue to hold it down while dragging the
	  mouse, Final Copy will keep the graphic`s original proportions
	  intact.

 OPTION 2 If you want an IFF ILBM to be sized to take maximum advantage
	  of your printer`s resolution, hold down the LEFT CTRL,SHIFT,and
	  ALT keys while dragging the mouse on the lower right anchor
	  point. Since your printer`s aspect ratio is usually different
	  than a graphic`s original aspect ratio, this method of
	  constraining will produce an image that may look out of
	  proportion on your screen. It will, however, result in the best
	  printouts. This method of constraining is known as INTEGER
	  SCALING.


			    "SNAP TO" SIZING
 If you hold the CTRL key down while pressing on an anchor point, and
continue to hold it down while dragging the mouse. Final Copy will snap
the size of the graphic to the nearest tick mark on the ruler.

			     "QUICK" SIZING
 If you want to reduce an image by 1/2, hold down the SHIFT key and
double-click the mouse  on the image to be reduced. You can continue
reducing the image in this manner. Each time the image is reduced, it
will be by 1/2.

 If you want to double the size of an image, hold the CTRL key and double
click the mouse on the image to be enlarged. Each time the image is
enlarged, its size is doubled.


			     MOVING GRAPHICS
 A graphic already inserted in a document can be moved anywhere within
the document.

 TO MOVE A GRAPHIC FROM ONE LOCATION TO ANOTHER:  See fig 8-2
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1. Select the graphic to be moved.

 2. Click and hold the mouse button on the graphic while dragging the

 If you hold the SHIFT key down while pressing the mouse on the graphic,
and continue to hold it down while dragging the mouse, Final Copy will
move the graphic either vertically or horizontally depending upon your
mouse movement.

			    "SNAP TO" MOVING
 If you hold the CTRL key down while pressing the mouse on the graphic,
and continue to hold it down while dragging the mouse, Final Copy will
move the graphics so that its left/top is snapped to the nearest tick
mark on the ruler.


		     MODIFYING A GRAPHIC`S SETTINGS
 An existing graphic can have its settings modified at any time. These
settings are the ones that comprise the settings requester for that
graphic.

 TO MODIFY AN EXISTING GRAPHIC`S SETTINGS:  See fig 8-2
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1. Click the mouse on the "Graphic Select" tool if it is not already
    selected.

    The program will return to the settings requester.

 5. Click on the "OK" button.

    Final Copy will redraw the selected graphic using the new values.


		       CROPPING IFF ILBM GRAPHICS
 Cropping is the process of cutting out unwanted portions of an IFF ILBM
graphic. The cut portions are limited to rectangular areas on the left,
top, right, or bottom of the graphic. A graphic already inserted in a
document can be cropped at any time.

 TO CROP AN IFF ILBM GRAPHIC: See fig 8-2
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1. Choose the "Crop" tool from among the tool icons in the ruler at the
    top of your window.

 2. Click the mouse on the IFF ILBM graphic you want to crop.

    Anchor points will appear.

 3. Press and hold the mouse on one of the anchor points in the corners
    or midpoints of the selected graphic.

 4. Drag the mouse to crop the area of the graphic the anchor point is
    in.

 5. Release the mouse when you have cropped the desired amount of the
    graphic.

 TO RESTORE AN IFF ILBM TO ITS UN-CROPPED SIZE:  See fig 8-2
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1. Select the graphic to be restored.

 2. Press the ALT key and while holding it down double-click the mouse on
    the graphic.


		       CANCELLING GRAPHIC ACTIONS
 You can cancel a size, move, or crop operation by pressing the right
button before releasing the left mouse button.


	  GRAPHICS COLOUR VS SCREEN COLOURS VS PRINTED COLOURS
 Final Copy tries to print in the colours in which they were defined.
However, when graphics are displayed on the screen they probably will not
be drawn in their true colours. When rendered  on the screen, a graphic`s
colours are changed to the colours that are currently available. If you
are using Final Copy Custom screen, for example, only four colours
(Black, White, Grey, and Blue/Grey) are available. So no mater what
colour you define for a graphic, that colour will be modified to one of
the colours used in the screen.

 If you are using Workbench 2.0 or higher, you can set the number of
colours used for the Workbench to more than 4 colours. For example, if
you set your Workbench to 8 colours, and open Final Copy on a Workbench
screen, 8 colours will be used to show graphics on screen. The downside
to this is that when you increase the number of colours for the Workbench
screen, the screen display may slow down.

 When the "Graphic Select" tool is selected, and you hold the mouse down
on a graphic (does not apply to IFF ILBM), the colours of the mouse
pointer will change to reflect the graphic`s colour.

			  PERFECTING A DOCUMENT

 Now that you have created, edited, and formatted your document, it`s
time to turn to Final Copy`s speller, thesaurus, and statistics feature
to help make your document as perfect as possible.

 In this section, you will learn how to :

    * USE THE SPELLER - Includes information on checking a document,
			obtaining spelling suggestions from Final Copy,
			and working with your own personalized user
			dictionary.

    * USE THE THESAURUS - Final Copy allows you to obtain lists of
			  synonyms for words in your document.

    * OBTAIN STATISTICS - Once your document is complete, you may
			  instruct Final Copy to count its various
			  elements, Including characters, words, lines,
			  sentences, paragraphs, and pages. Averages are
			  also provided.


			    USING THE SPELLER
 Final Copy`s built in spelling detector will scan your document for
words it does not recognize and give you the opportunity to revise the
spelling. Final Copy`s spelling corrector will provide spelling
suggestions for words that it flags as possible misspellings.

 All spelling functions are accessed through the "speller" requester.
Once the speller requester is open, it can be moved to any place on the
screen, or depth arranged behind a document window.

 There are two ways the speller can be used: "Word Verify" mode, and
"Document Scan" mode. In "word Verify" mode you instruct the speller to
verify a single word in your document text. In "Document Scan" mode, you
instruct the speller to scan a document starting at the insertion point,
and continue until the end of the document or until you tell it to stop.

			   "WORD VERIFY" MODE
 When checking a single word, the speller will check and word that you
have selected. If you have selected more than one word, the speller will
only check the first word in the selected range.

 TO CHECK A SINGLE WORD IN YOUR DOCUMENT:  See fig 9-2
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1. Double-click the mouse in the word to be verified.

 2. Choose "Speller from the "Extra" menu.

    The "Speller" requester will appear and the word is verified. The
    speller will display a message indicating whether or not the word is
    spelled correctly.

    If the word is not spelled correctly, you can use any of the
    "Speller" requester`s options for obtaining suggestions or adding the
    word to your user dictionary.


			  "DOCUMENT SCAN" MODE

 When scanning a document, the speller will start at the position in the
document where the insertion point is.

 TO BEGIN A DOCUMENT SPELL CHECK:  See fig 9-2
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1. Set the insertion point where you want the spell check to begin, and
    choose "Speller" from the "Extra" menu.

    The "Speller" requester will appear on the screen.

 2. Click on the "Spell" button.

    The spell check will begin at the insertion point, wrapping around if
    necessary to examine the entire document for errors. As they are
    found, potentially incorrect words will be highlighted in your
    document, and the highlighted word will appear in the "Word" data
    entry area of the "Speller" requester. A message indicating the
    potential error simultaneously appears in the "Alternatives" section
    of the requester.


		       CORRECTING SPELLING ERRORS
 Once a potential error has been identified Final Copy offers you several
ways in which to correct it. You may enter the replacement from the
keyboard, ask Final Copy to provide a list of potential alternatives from
which to choose, or you may skip a word that has been incorrectly flagged
by the spell checker. Please remember that if you have turned on the
"Auto Suggest" feature in the "Speller Preferences" requester, spelling
alternatives will be provided automatically for every flagged word.

 In any of these correction scenarios, the spell checker will
automatically resume its document scan after the revision has been made.


 TO CORRECT AN ERROR FROM THE KEYBOARD:  See fig 9-2
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1. Click the mouse in the data entry area next to "Change To", and type
    in the correct word.

 2. After verifying that the word you have typed in appears as you wish
    it to, click on the "Replace" button.

    The original highlighted word in your document text will be replaced
    with the characters you typed.


 TO ASK FOR SPELLING SUGGESTIONS:  See fig 9-2
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1. After the word has been highlighted on he screen, click on the
    requester`s "Suggest" button.

    A list of correctly spelled alternatives will appear in the
    "Alternatives" section of the requester. The first word in the list
    is the one the spell checker considers the most likely replacement
    for the word highlighted in your document. This most likely word will
    automatically appear in the "Change To" data entry area.

 2. If the spell checker`s most likely alternative is not the correct
    replacement, you may examine the remainder of the list. If the list
    is lengthy, use the scroll bar to move through the remaining
    alternatives.


 TO MAKE A CORRECTION USING THE "ALTERNATIVES" LIST:  See fig 9-2
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1. Once you have determined which of the alternatives is the correct
    replacement, select that word by clicking the mouse on it.

    The word you selected will appear in the "Changes To" data entry area
    in the requester.

 2. Click on the requester`s "Replace" button.

    The highlighted word in your document will be replaced with the
    alternative word you selected.


 TO IGNORE A WORD THE SPELLER THINKS IS MISSPELLED:  See fig 9-2
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1. Determine if the word highlighted by the spell checker is actually
    spelled correctly.

    Final Copy`s spell checker will automatically flag any word that
    does not appear in the main or user dictionaries. It is always a
    good idea to verify the correct spelling of such words before
    skipping the word.

 2. Click on the requester`s "Skip" button.

    The spell checker will automatically skip over other instances of the
    same word as long as the "Speller" requester is open.


			      ADDING WORDS
 Final Copy flags words as possible misspellings when it cannot find them
in either the main or user dictionary. You can add any word to the user
dictionary so it will not be flagged again.

 TO ADD A WORD TO THE USER DICTIONARY
 DURING A SPELLING CHECK:	      See fig 9-2
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1. Verify that the highlighted word is spelled correctly and that it
    should be added to the user dictionary.

 2. Click on the requester`s "Add" button.

    The word will be added to the user dictionary. If you are examining
    your entire document for errors, the spell checker will automatically
    continue its scan. All future instances of the word will be verified
    against the spelling you have entered in the user dictionary. The
    word will only be highlighted in the future if it does not match the
    entry in the user dictionary.


			     DELETING WORDS
 You can delete words from the user dictionary when you no longer want
that word to be accepted as a correctly spelled word.

 TO DELETE A WORD FROM THE USER DICTIONARY:  See fig 9-2
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1. Click on the requester`s "User" button to bring up the list of words
    in the user dictionary.

    The list will appear in the "Alternatives" section of the requester.

 2. Click on the word to be deleted.

 3. Click on the "Delete" button.


			   USING THE THESAURUS
 Final Copy`s thesaurus is a tool that helps you find the best word for
given situation. The thesaurus gives a list of synonyms for words you
specify.

 TO USE THE THESAURUS FOR A WORD IN THE DOCUMENT:  See fig 9-7
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1. Double-click on the desired word.

 2. Choose "Thesaurus" from the "Extra" menu.

    The "Thesaurus" requester will appear on your screen. Notice that a
    selected word appears in the "Word" data entry area, and that a
    number of alternatives are listed.

 3. Review the list, using the scroll bars if necessary.

 4. If you like to view additional lists of alternatives, click on any
    word in the current list, then click on the "Find" button.

    A new list of definitions and synonyms will appear.

 5. Once you have found the desired word to replace the selected word in
    your document, click on that word in the list.

 6. Click on the "Replace" button.

    The selected word in your document will be replaced with the word
    from the list.


		      OBTAINING DOCUMENT STATISTICS
 Final Copy`s document statistics feature is helpful if you are writing a
document that has certain limitations on the number of words.

 TO OBTAIN DOCUMENT STATISTICS:  See fig 9-7
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1. Choose "Statistics" from the "Extra" menu.

    The "Document Statistics" requester will appear on your screen.

			   PRINTING A DOCUMENT

 Now that your document has been created, revised, formatted, and made
perfect in ever way, it is time to print. this chapter includes all the
information you will need to print your document successfully.


			   PRINTING A DOCUMENT
 Final Copy provides two ways of printing: draft, and final.

 DRAFT - In draft mode the program uses the built-in mono-spaced font of
	 your printer to produce output. Draft mode is used primarily for
	 quick printouts of your text during proofing. In draft mode all
	 graphics, headers, footers, and formatting are ignored. You can
	 set margins to be used for draft printing, but these are used
	 only in printing - not on the screen.

 FINAL - In final mode the program prints a document exactly the way it
	 appears on the screen. Final mode printed to a graphic printer
	 is slower. Final mode always results in the best output a
	 printer is capable of.

			 HOW TO PRINT A DOCUMENT
 Printing a document is simple, however it is necessary to ensure that
your computer is prepared to print - this includes installing and
selecting the appropriate printer driver. In addition, you may want to
modify some Final Copy`s print settings to suit your needs.

 TO PRINT A DOCUMENT:  See fig 10-2
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1. Choose "Print" from the "Project" menu.

    The "Print Document" requester will appear.

 2. Modify any settings you wish to change.

    Refer to the next section for full details on settings that can be
    modified in the "Print "Document" requester.

 3. Click on the "Print button.

    If you are printing to a PostScript file, a requester will appear
    prompting you for the name of a file to write the PostScript
    information to.


    Supplied in the requester will be a default name. You can either use
    the default name, change the name in the requester, or use the
    "Choose" button to specify a name via a file requester.


			  HOW TO STOP PRINTING
 While a document is being printed, the program will display the
"Printing Document" requester. You can cancel or stop printing while
printing is occurring as long as this requester is on the screen.

 TO STOP PRINTING:  See fig 10-2
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1. Click on "Stop" in the "Printing Document..." requester.

    Information in the print buffer will still be printed, but no more
    information will be sent to the printer by the program.


		     THE "PRINT DOCUMENT" REQUESTER
 Final Copy provides considerable flexibility in the producing printed
output. The options and settings that are available via the "Print"
requester can be modified to suit your needs. When the "Print" requester
is displayed, all options are set to either their default values, values
that you have saved, or values from your last print.

 TO ACCESS THE "PRINT DOCUMENT" REQUESTER:  See fig 10-2
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1. Choose "Print" from the "Project" menu.

    If you have not specifically saved the "print" requester`s settings,
    the settings displayed will be the program`s default values set by
    SoftWood. If you have saved the "Print" requester`s settings, those
    settings will be the program`s default values, and will be shown in
    the "Print" requester. Some settings may be carried over from a
    previous printing as long as the document has not been closed since
    the last time it was printed.

    Below are descriptions of the settings found in the "Print"
    requester, and how you can use them.

    COPIES      - Enter the number of copies of your document that you
		  want printed in the "Copies" data entry area.

    PREFERENCES - Click on these buttons to access additional print
		  options. These options are discussed in later sections
		  in this chapter.

    PAGES       - Clicking on the button preceding "All" will cause Final
		  Copy to print your document in its entirety. If you
		  only want a certain range of pages to print, click on
		  the button preceding "Ranges" and enter the first and
		  last pages of your desired range in the data entry
		  areas under the words "From" and "To".

    ORDER       - This option is used to specify the order in which pages
		  of your document are printed when printing in Final
		  print mode.

    COLLATE     - This option defines which pages are printed when
		  printing in Final print mode. Normally you will use the
		  "All" setting. If you are printing two-sided pages, you
		  can use the "Odd only" option to print pages 1,3,5,
		  etc., turn the printed pages over, and then use the
		  "Even only" option to print pages 2,4,6, etc.

    PRINT TO    - This option specifies where Final Copy is to print. If
		  you are printing to a printer, you will either specify
		  Graphic Printer or PostScript Printer. If you are
		  saving PostScript data to a disk file so you can take
		  someone who has a PostScript printer, you should use
		  the "PostScript File" option. See "PostScript Printing"
		  later in this chapter for more information.

    PAPER FEED  - This option defines the way your printer handles paper.
		  Laser printers and printers with sheet feeders are
		  specified as "Single Sheet": otherwise use
		  "Continuous".

    SET DEFAULT - Check this if you want the "Print Document" requester`s
		  settings to be saved as the program`s default values.


			   GRAPHIC PREFERENCES
 Settings that affect Final Mode printing on a graphic (non PostScript)
printers are found in the "Graphic Preferences" requester.

 TO ACCESS THE "GRAPHIC FINAL PRINT
 PREFERENCES" REQUESTER:	     See fig 10-5
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1. Click on the "Graphic" button in the "Preferences" section of the
    "Print Document" requester.

 Below are descriptions of the settings in the "Graphic Final Print
Preferences" requester:

 DENSITY	- Graphic printers print by creating images out of a
		  series of dots. Density is a term used to describe the
		  quantity of graphic dots in a given space on the
		  printed page. Different printers have different
		  densities. Some have a number of available densities.
		  Final Copy lets you select from seven different density
		  settings (1 is low density, 7 is high density). However
		  not all density settings may be available for your
		  printer. If you are unsure of the number of densities
		  available for your printer, or the dots per inch of
		  each, click on each density button and observe how the
		  numbers in the "DPI" box change. A higher density will
		  increase the time it takes to print your document and,
		  with some printers, may result in muddy colours.

 THRESHOLD      - This setting determines which colours on the screen are
		  printed as white, and which are printed as black when
		  the "Shade" option is set to "Black and White".

 COLOUR CORRECT - If you are printing colour graphics, this setting helps
		  you to better match screen colour to the colour
		  produced by the printer. Without colour correction, the
		  printer device can print 4096 colours displayed by the
		  Amiga on a colour printer. However, as colour
		  correction is applied, the total number of printed
		  colours is reduced by 308 shades for each colour
		  selected for correction. The total number of colours
		  available is always displayed in the area under the
		  word "Colours".

		  To see the effect of colour correction, you may wish to
		  print a picture with solid red,green, and blue shades
		  once with colour correct on, and once with it off. Then
		  compare the two pictures with the screen display.

 DITHERING      - Dithering refers to the way in which colours are
		  produced on the printed page. It enables you to produce
		  printouts with various shades on a printer that only
		  uses four colours. Dithering only applies to colour or
		  grey scale printing.

		  ORDERED DITHERING - colour intensities are formed using
		  an ordered dither method. Ordered dithering produces
		  shades on the printer using an ordered pattern of dots.

		  HALFTONE DITHERING - colour intensities on the printer
		  are formed using halftone dither method. This technique
		  is similar to the one used in newspapers and comic
		  books. It works best on high density printers (greater
		  than 150 dots per inch".

 SHADE	  - Use this setting to specify whether documents are to be
		  printed in colour, black and white, or shades of grey.
		  For faster printouts use black and white.


			 POSTSCRIPT PREFERENCES

 Settings that affect printing to a PostScript printer, and printing
PostScript information to a disk file are made in the "Postscript
Preferences" requester.

 TO ACCESS THE "POSTSCRIPT PREFERENCES" REQUESTER:  See fig 10-5
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1. Click on the "PostScript" button in the "Print" requester.

 Below are descriptions of the settings in the "PostScript Preferences"
requester.

 PRINTER TYPE - Use this setting to define to Final Copy whether your
		laser is connected to your Amiga through the Parallel or
		Serial port.

 SHADE	- This setting defines whether you want colour PostScript
		information generated. If you are not printing to a
		colour PostScript printer, set shade to "Grey Scale".

 ORIENTATION  - If you want your page printed in the normal fashion, set
		this option to "Tall". If you want to print sideways, set
		this option to "Wide".


		      "DRAFT PREFERENCES" REQUESTER
 The settings in the "Draft Preferences" requester affect printing in
draft mode. Draft mode is not available on PostScript printers. If you
choose to print to a PostScript printer or disk file, the Print Draft
option is not available.

 TO ACCESS THE "DRAFT PREFERENCES" REQUESTER:  See fig 10-8
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1. Click the mouse on the "Draft" button in the "print" requester.

 Below are definitions for the options and settings in the "Draft
Preferences" requester:

 LINES  - Use this option to specify the size of your page in terms of
	  the maximum number of lines that can be printed on it. This
	  setting will depend upon the vertical size of your page, the
	  "Spacing" option (also found in the "Draft Preferences"
	  requester), and the printable area on the page. Below are few
	  examples:

	  Page size     Spacing  Feed	   Paper Length

	  8 1/2 x 11    6	Continuous     66
	  8 1/2 x 11    8	Continuous     88
	  8 1/2 x 11    6	Sheet	  54
	  Label	 6	-	      6

 MARGINS
  TOP    - Top margin is the number of lines from the top of the
	   printable area of a page that you do not want to print to.
	   This value is measured from the top of the printable area. For
	   example, a one inch top margin on continuous feed printing,
	   using "6 lines per inch" spacing, would require a Top Margin
	   value of 6. On a continuous feed printer, there will already
	   be a top margin equal to the non-printable area at the top of
	   the page.

  BOTTOM - Bottom margin is the number of lines from the bottom of the
	   printable area of a page that you want to print on. If you are
	   using a sheet fed printer, there will already be an area at
	   the bottom of the page where printing can not occur.

  LEFT   - Left margin is the number of characters from the left of the
	   printable area of the page that you do not want to print on.
	   For example, a one inch left margin using Pica (10 characters
	   per inch) pitch would mean a Left Margin value of 10.

  RIGHT  - Right margin is measured from the left side of the printable
	   area of a page. It defines the maximum width to print on. For
	   example, on a page with a printable area of 8 inches, using
	   Elite (12 characters per inch) pitch, a one inch Right Margin
	   would require a value of 84 ((8 inches - 1inch)x12 characters
	   per inch).

  FIRST  - First margin is the number of characters from the left side of
	   the printable area of a page you want to indent when printing
	   the first line of a paragraph.

 PITCH   - Pitch defines which mono-spaced printer font you want to print
	   with. Pica gives you 10 characters per inch, Elite gives you
	   12 characters per inch, and Fine gives you condensed print.

 SPACING - Spacing defines the vertical placement of lines on a page as a
	   function of lines per inch.

 QUALITY - Quality defines the type of printer font you want to print
	   with.


			   POSTSCRIPT PRINTING
 If you have a PostScript laser printer, or if you know someone who does,
you can use Final Copy`s built-in PostScript printer driver. For best
results be sure to use fonts in the PSFonts drawer on the FCExtras disk
when creating your document. These fonts are similar to fonts that are
generally included in PostScript printers. See Appendix E for a list of
fonts in the PSFonts drawer along with their similar PostScript names.

 Final Copy`s PostScript output can be directed to your Amiga`s parallel
(PAR:) or serial (SER:) device. It may also be re-directed to a file
which can be taken to a typesetting service and printed.

		   COMMUNICATING WITH THE SERIAL PORT
 Final Copy will communicate through the serial (SER:) device to a
PostScript printer using the current Serial Preferences. The output
generated is strict (7-bit) ASCII to provide widest acceptance on the
host PostScript printer.

 Making sure your Amiga has the proper serial connection with the printer
is very dependent on the output device. the default settings of either
9600 or 1200 baud, 8 bits/char, No parity, 1 stop bit, and XON/XOFF
handshaking usually work with no problems.

			       HANDSHAKING
 Often, when a simple document is printed it works fine, but when a
complex document is printed, the printer produces no output. In most
cases, this is due to a handshaking problem and can be corrected by
matching the handshake between the Amiga and the printer.

 To find out what handshaking your printer uses run the PostScript
program shown below. Use a text editor like emacs or ed. You can also use
Final Copy but make sure you save the file as ASCII.

   /HELVETICA FINDFONT 20 SCALEFONT SETFONT
   40 300 MOVETO
   STATUSDICT BEGIN
   25 SCCBATCH
   (THE OPTIONS NUMBER IS ) SHOW
   10 STRING CVS SHOW
   (. THE BAUD RATE IS ) SHOW
   10 STRING CVS SHOW
   END
   SHOWPAGE

 Save this file as "shake" and exit the editor. From the CLI, copy the
"shake" file to the serial port with a command command such as "copy
shake ser:". this will send the PostScript program to the printer where
it will be run. The printer should print a sheet of paper. If nothing
seems to happen, cycle the power on the printer, wait a moment and try
again. The output should read.

    THE OPTIONS NUMBER IS 0. THE BAUD RATE IS 9600

 If your options number is in the range 0 - 3, the handshake is properly
set to XON/XOFF. If your options number is in the range 4 - 7, there is a
problem - the printer is set to DTR handshake. This won`t work well with
the Amiga.

 The option number is interpreted as follows:
     0 or 4 Ignore parity
     1 or 5 Odd parity
     2 or 6 Even parity
     3 or 7 No parity

 For the Amiga the options should be set to 0.

 Some printers have switches or front panel controls for the options and
baud rate. If you have one of these, look in your manual for the correct
settings. Other printers require a PostScript program, like the one below
.

  Replace BAUD and OPTIONS with the numbers you wish set.

	SERVERDICT BEGIN 0000 EXITSERVER
	STATUSDICT BEGIN
	25 BAUD OPTIONS SETSCCBATCH
	END

 Type the program in using your text editor and run it by copying it to
the SER: device as described above. This will change the internal baud
and options settings. The settings will stay in effect even if you turn
the power off. You should not change the settings more often than
necessary, through. The EEPROM device that stores the settings wears out
after about 10,000 uses.

 After running the program, either send a CTRL-D to the printer or wait
30 seconds for the changes to take effect.


			     ADVANCED TOPICS
 THE "SW_PROLOGUE.PS" FILE
 Located in the "FCFiles" drawer is the file, "sw_prologue.ps". This file
must be available for Final Copy to generate PostScript output. If Final
Copy is properly installed, this file will be available at all times.
Please do not modify "sw_prolog.ps". PostScript programmers can do
customized procedures using the "user_def.ps" file.

 THE "USERDEF.PS" FILE
 Although the file "user_def.ps" is not included on your Final Copy
disks, a PostScript programmer may want to create a few custom PostScript
procedures for doing such things as colour separations, page,
registration marks, etc. Final Copy leaves these options open for the
PostScript programmer.

 When printing, Final Copy looks in the "FCFiles" directory for the file
"user_def.ps". If the file is found, it is inserted into the PostScript
output, giving the user a chance to define a few custom PostScript
procedures that will be called while the document is printing. These
PostScript procedures names are:

 USERDOC
 USERBOP
 USEREOP


 UserDoc is called right before the document begins printing. This gives
the PostScript programmer the ability to set up device dependent
information such as undercolour removal, halftone screens and the like.

 UserBOP is called at the beginning of each page, and UserEOP is called
right before each page is ejected from the printer. These two procedures
can be used to print registration marks or other information that you
want to print on each page.

 Final Copy also keeps a few PostScript variables current while the
document is printing. These variable are:

  u_doc	     The document name
  u_time	    The current time (as printing)
  u_date	    The current date
  u_page	    What page number when printing
  u_copy	    What copy of this page is printing
  u_pageht/u_pagewd The document`s page dimensions

 The variables"u_doc","u_time" and "u_date" are updated when the document
begins printing, and can be used inside the user`s procedures to print
cover sheets or for typesetters information printed in the margins of
each page.

 The variables "u_page" and "u_copy" are also useful for typesetting
information printed on each page. "u_copy" is particularly useful for
doing colour separations. You may specify that Final Copy print four
copies of the document, and your "UserDoc" or "UserBOP" procedure may use
the variable "U_cop" to set up halftone screens and colour separations
for Cyan, Magenta, Yellow and Black.

			      FROM LETTERS
 With Final Copy, you can create a form letter, a list of recipients and
print an individualized copy of the form letter for each recipient.
Included in this chapter are instructions on:

 * Creating and saving merge data.
 * Creating a form letter.
 * Merging data with a form letter.


			 PRODUCING FORM LETTERS

 To print form letters in Final Copy, you need:

 * A form letter document containing the text that is the same for every
   copy of the letter, and indication where custom data unique for each
   copy is to be inserted.

 * A data file containing actual information that is different for each
   letter, such as names and addresses of recipients.

 The form letter and the data file are combined using the "Print Merge"
command to print individualized form letter.

**** See fig 11-2 ****


			  CREATING A DATA FILE
 In the discussions that follow, "row" is used to refer to a collection
of related data: and "field" is used to refer to a piece of data within
a row. For example in a name and address data file, a row refers to all
the information for one person; while field refers to a person`s name.

 A data file is an ASCII disk file where fields are separated by comma or
tab characters, and rows are separated by a NEWLINE (0x0a) or RETURN
(0x0d) character. For example, in a name and address data file, each
person`s name and address information (row) is separated from another
person`s name and address, by a NEWLINE or RETURN character. Within each
row the name, address, city, state, etc., fields are separated from each
other by either a comma or tab character. Although either a tab or comma
can be used to separate data, only one method can be used in any given
data file. Therefore, if data is separated with a tab for one row of
data, a comma can not be used to separate data in another row.

 Final Copy uses the first row of a data file to determine the names
field. Therefore in a name and address data file, the first row could
contain the words "First" "Last" "Address" "City", etc. Subsequent rows
would contain the actual names and address.

 To summarize, the rules governing the format of data files that can be
used in Final Copy`s Form Letter feature are:

 * Data file must be an ASCII data file.

 * Rows within a data file are separated by either a NEW LINE or a RETURN
   character.

 * Fields within a row are separated by either tab or comma character.
   Only one method of separating fields can be used in any given data
   file.

 * The first row of a data file must contain the names of the fields
   contained in the file.

 * The sequence of fields within a row must follow the sequence of field
   names used in the first row.

 A typical name and address data file might appear as:

 FIRST  MIDDLE LAST       STREET   CITY     STATE   ZIP
 Woody	 Williams   120 Company Str.  Tempe   AZ      12345
 Terry  R.     Wright     43 Sailboat Ave.  Tempe   AZ      32321
 Mary   B.     Unes       55 Golf Street    Phoenix AZ      39393
 Pat	   Brouilette 23 Rock Climb Rd. Tempe   AZ      38290
 Ben	   Fuller     553 Amiga Lane    Mesa    AZ      3234

 NOTE. Where a field does not exist within a row, only the separating
character is entered.


TIPS FOR SETTING UP A DATA FILE DOCUMENT
 You may want to modify two preference settings to make entering, saving,
and opening a data file more convenient. These preferences are:

"TAB EVERY" VALUE
 Final Copy has a default tab distance value that is set in the "Document
Preferences" requester. This value specifies the distance the program
will move the insertion point whenever you press the TAB key where no tab
stops are set. When you are creating a data file, and intend to use a tab
character to separate data, you may want to set this value larger than
Final Copy`s original default value. We recommend setting the "Tabs
Every" value in the "Document Preferences" requester to at least .75
inches.

**** See fig 3-10 ****

			  ASCII I/O PREFERENCES
 We recommend the following settings for the ASCII I/O Preferences used
to read and write your data file.

**** See fig 3-6 ****


			   SAVING A DATA FILE
 If you Final Copy to edit and save your data file, you will need to save
it as an ASCII file. In order to do this properly, always use the "Save
As" feature rather than "Save". The reason for this is that "Save" will
always save an existing file as a formatted Final Copy document. By using
the "Save As" feature, you can specify that the ASCII format is used.

 TO SAVE A DATA FILE IN FINAL COPY:  See fig 11-5
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1. Choose "Save As" from the "Project" menu.

    A file requester will appear.

 2. Use the file requester to locate where you want the data file to be
    saved.

 3. Insert in "File" whatever name you want to save the file as. If you
    are saving a data file that already been saved, click the mouse on
    the name of the file in the file requester`s list.

 4. Click on the "Export..." button in the file requester.

    A list of formats will be shown.

 5. Click on the word "ASCII", and then click on the "Save".

    The file will be saved as an ASCII file.


			 CREATING A FORM LETTER
 A form letter is created in Final Copy like any other document. The only
difference is that wherever you want data merged into the text from a
data file, you will choose the "Insert Merge Field" menu item and specify
the name of the field that is to be merged. Once a merge field definition
has been inserted, you can change it, remove it, and even change its type
attributes.

 TO INSERT A MERGE FIELD DEFINITION:  See fig 11-6
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1. Make sure the insertion point is where you want data to be inserted
    from the data file.

 2. Choose "Merge Field" from the "Insert item" sub-menu located in the
    "Edit" menu.

    The "Select Merge Field" requester will be displayed.

 3. If the "Fields" list is empty:
  A. Click on the "Select..." button.

     A file requester will appear.

  B. Use the requester to locate a data file that contains the names of
     the merge fields in the first row of the file.

  C. Once the data file is located, double-click the mouse on its name.

     Final Copy will read the data file, locate the field names, and
     place the names into the "Fields Names" list.

 4. Double-click the mouse on the name of the field in the "Field Names"
    list whose data is to be merged.

    Final Copy will remove the requester, and insert the field`s name
    into your document surrounded by double-bracket characters.

    For example, "<<First>>".

 5. Continue typing your form letter and repeat the above steps for each
    merge field.


		CHANGING A MERGE FIELD`S TYPE ATTRIBUTES
 A merge field created by Final Copy has its own unique type attributes.
For example, your form letter could be in Times-Roman while data merged
into a particular merge field could be Times-Bold.

 TO CHANGE A MERGE FIELD`S TYPE ATTRIBUTES:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1. Click the mouse on the merge field whose attributes are to be changed.

    Final Copy will select the entire merge field including its
    surrounding brackets.

 2. Set the type attributes using the Text menu items or the "Type Specs"
    requester.

		   CHANGING A MERGE FIELD`S DATA NAME
 You can change your mind as to what field is to be merged in a merge
field that is already defined.

  TO CHANGE A MERGE FIELD`S DATA NAME:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1. Click the mouse on the merge field whose data name is to be changed.

    Final Copy will select the entire field including its surrounding
    brackets.

 2. Choose "Merge Field" from the "Update item" sub-menu located in the
    "Edit" menu.

    The "Select Merge Field" requester will be displayed.

 3. If the "Fields Names" list is empty:

  A. Click on the "Select..." button.

     A file requester will appear.

  B. Use the requester to locate a data file that contains the names of
     the merge fields in the first row of the file.

  C. Once the data file is located, double-click the mouse on its name.

     Final Copy will read the data file, locate the field names, and
     place the names into the "Fields Names" list.

 4. Double-click the mouse on the name of the field in the "Field Names"
    list whose data is to be merged.

    Final Copy will remove the requester, and insert the field`s name
    into your document surrounded by double-bracket characters.


			 REMOVING A MERGE FIELD
 You can remove a merge field from a form letter at any time.

 TO REMOVE A MERGE FIELD:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1. Click the mouse on the merge field to be removed.

    Final Copy will select the entire field including its surrounding
    brackets.

 2. Press the DELETE or BACKSPACE key.

    The merge field will be removed from the document.

			  SAVING A FORM LETTER
 A form letter is saved as a Final Copy document. There is nothing special
about saving a form letter - do it just as you save any other document.


		     MERGING DATA WITH A FORM LETTER
 Once you have created a from letter and a data file you can instruct
Final Copy to merge the data file with the form letter. This process will
print an individualized copy of the letter for each recipient in the
data file.

 TO MERGE DATA WITH A FORM LETTER:  See fig 11-10
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1.If the form letter document is not already open , choose "Open" from
the "Project" menu, and open the form letter like you do for any other
document that you open.

 2. Choose "Print Merge" from the "Project" menu.

    Final Copy will display the "Select Merge Data" file requester.

 3. Use the file requester to locate the data file you want to use for
    the merge.

 4. Once the data file is located , double-click the mouse on its name in
    the file requester's list.

    The "Select Merge Records" requester will appear.

    Final Copy will analyse the data file and determine the number of
    rows (records) contained in the file. It will put the number "1" in
    the "From" range, and the last record number found in the "To"
    range. This gives you the ability to select which group of data
    records to be merged. This feature is handy if you have to restart a
    merge because of printer error or some other problem.

 5. If you want to print all rows in the data file, click the mouse on
    "All". If you want to print a range of rows, click the mouse on the
    "Range", enter the beginning row # in the area labelled "From", and
    enter the ending row # in the area labelled "To".

 6. Click on the "OK" button in the "Select Merge Rows" requester.

    Final Copy will display a requester.

**** See fig 11-11

 7. Use this requester just as you would if printing a single document.
    Refer to Chapter 10 for details on using this requester.

    Final Copy will display the "Printing..." requester and you will
    begin to merge rows of data with the form letter. Each page of the
    form letter will be printed for each data record merged. You can
    cancel this process at any time by clicking the mouse on the "Stop"
    button.

			      AREXX SUPPORT

 Advanced users can use Final Copy's ARexx facility to create "macro"
programs. These macros can execute Final Copy commands as well as
commands understood by other programs. In order to use ARexx it must be
installed on your system. ARexx is included as part of the Amiga 2.0
operating, system, but must be purchased separately in earlier versions.

 This chapter describes commands that can be used in an ARexx macro to
execute Final Copy.


			USING AREXX IN FINAL COPY
 To use ARexx in Final Copy you must have ARexx installed on your
computer and be familiar with the ARexx language. ARexx is considered a
feature for "advanced users.

 An ARexx macro program is usually created in a text editor, but can also
be created in Final Copy and saved as an ASCII file. The name of this
port always begins with "FinalC." and ends with a number indicating the
order in which the window was opened. For example, the first window
opened has an ARexx port name of "finalC.1"; the second window opened has
a port name of "FinalC.2".

			SENDING SCRIPTS TO AREXX.
 You can create as many ARexx scripts as you want for Final Copy.

 Up to 10 ARexx scripts can be assigned to Final Copy's "Macros" menu.
These scripts can be accessed by choosing the appropriate menu item or by
pressing one of the F1 - F10 function keys. The names for these scripts
must begin with "AMacro_" and end with a number from 1 to 10 (AMacro_2).
These scripts must exist in the same drawer that the Final Copy program is
in.

 Another 10 ARexx scripts can be accessed by pressing the ALT key and one
of the F1 - F10 function keys. The names for these scripts must begin
with "AMacro_" and end with a number from 11 to 20. These names will not
appear in Final Copy's ARexx menu. These scripts must exist in the same
drawer that the Final Copy program is in.

 Any ARExx macro can be executed within Final Copy using the "Other" menu
item in the "Macros" menu. When you choose the "Other" menu item, A file
requester will appear which you use to locate the script to be executed.

			      AREXX ERRORS
 Final Copy returns one of the following numbers in the ARexx variable
"RC" after each ARexx command it processes.

 0    No errors
 5    Warning
 10   Command failed
 20   Command has invalid arguments
 100  Unknown or invalid command
 200  Can't open fcarexx.library

			     COMMANDS SYNTAX
 In the list below each command is listed followed by any parameters it
requires, and a description of what the command does. Bracketed
characters "<" and ">" indicate required parameters. The vertical bar
character "|" separates commands for documentation purpose only.
Parenthesis characters "(" and ")" indicate optional parameters.


			      MENU COMMANDS
 Most of Final Copy's macro commands duplicate an equivalent menu command.
These commands let you execute Final Copy menu commands from within macro
programs.

			       13 OUTLINING

 USING STYLES TO FORMAT AN OUTLINE OVER VIEW
    Formatting an outline........................13-2
    Promoting and demoting levels................13-4
    Changing outline styles......................13-4


				 OUTLINING
 With Final Copy, you can easily format an outline using Final Copy's
predefined "Outline" style. In this chapter are instructions on:

 * Creating an outline.

 * Promoting and demoting outline levels.


		    USING STYLES TO FORMAT AN OUTLINE
 When you begin a new document. Final Copy defines several default Styles
for the document. Four of these styles can be used to create outlines.
Using styles to create an outline makes the process of indenting,
demoting, and promoting levels extremely easy.
 Contained within each of these outline styles are margin, first line
indent, tab stops definitions. Each outline style has a function key
assigned to it, so the process of indenting or outdenting a line or an
entire level is a easy as pressing a function key.

 Below, the names of Final Copy's predefined outline styles are shown
with the indentation defined for the style.

OUTLINE 1

   OUTLINE 2

      OUTLINE 3

	 OUTLINE 4

 Using these four styles you can create like the ones below.

Planing for An Older Population

All evidence indicates that the population of elderly people to younger
people in society is increasing. The shift will require new planning for
the future.

I.    Evidence of the shift
      A.  The declining birthrate
      B.  The changing death rate
      C.  Population profiles for the future
	  1. Profiles based on current rates
	  2. Profiles based on various predictions for the future
	     a.  same birthrate, lower death rate
	     b.  lower birthrate, same death rate
	     c. lower birth and death rates
II.   Implications of the population shift
      A.  For work and retirement patterns
	  1. Current patterns
	  2. Prospective patterns
      B.  For government planning
	  1. Government income
	  2. Government services
	  3. Need for planning careers

 The preceding outline was written in phrases. The same outline can be
written in full sentences. Final Copy's outline styles makes this easy
since all margins, tab stops, and indentation are defined within each
style. Below is a portion of the same outline written in full sentence.

I.  Evidence of the shift in the ratio of older people in the population
    is available in our present statistics.
    A.  The birthrate is declining. Fewer children are born to the average
	woman.
    B.  The death rate is decreasing. More people are reaching a greater
	age.
    C.  From present statistics we can provide a profile of future
	population ratios. All profiles will suggest an older population.
	1.   We can project the profiles by assuming the same birthrate
	     and a lower death rate.
	2.   We can assume a lower birthrate and the same death rate.
	3.   We can assume both lower birth and death rates based on
	     current trends.

 Final Copy will not insert the heading numbers and letters - you will
have to do this to suit your own needs. Final Copy's outline styles will,
however, properly indent the first line, tab into the line, and indent
the succeeding lines for any given level. When entering text for a given
level, and you need more than one line for that level, do not press
RETURN at the end of the line - Final Copy will automatically word wrap
and indent the next line. The outlines shown above can be created using
Final Copy's default outline styles.

    LEVEL    STYLE NAME    FUNCTION KEY

    1 (I)    Outline_1     F1 (Shifted)
    2 (A)    Outline_2     F2 (Shifted)
    3 (1)    Outline_3     F3 (Shifted)
    4 (a)    Outline_4     F4 (Shifted)

 TO CREATE AN OUTLINE USING STYLES:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1. Press the SHIFT and F1 keys together, or choose "Outline 1" from the
    "Styles" menu.

    This applies the level 1 style attributes.

 2. Enter "I." and press the TAB key.

    When you press the TAB key, the program advances the insertion point
    into the line

 3. Enter the text for the first level and press RETURN.

    For example, "Evidence of the shift".

 4. Press the SHIFT and F2 keys together, or choose "Outline 2" from the
    "Styles" menu.

    This applies the level 2 style attributes.

 5. Enter "A." and press the TAB key.

    When you press the TAB key, the program advances the insertion point
    into the line

 6. Enter the text for the first level and press RETURN.

    For example, "The declining birthrate".

 7. Continue pressing the function keys to obtain the indentation
    necessary for the lines being entered.


		      PROMOTING AND DEMOTING LEVELS
 You can use the outline styles to promote and demote subsequent topics
within a single level. Only one group of topics can be done at one time.

 TO PROMOTE OR DEMOTE A SERIES OF TOPICS:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1. Drag the mouse over the text in the topic to be promoted or demoted.

 2. Press the function key or choose the appropriate style menu item that
    corresponds to the level you want the topic to be.

 3. Modify the topics level indicators.

			 CHANGING OUTLINE STYLES

 You can change the attributes of Final Copy's default outline styles,
add new ones of your own, and even delete ones you don't want to use. To
accomplish these tasks refer to the instructions on Style in Chapter 7.

			       THE RULERS
 Final Copy's rulers are used to show horizontal and vertical distances
in a document. In addition, the horizontal ruler provides an easy, visual
way to set paragraph characteristics. A paragraph is defined as zero or
more keyboard characters terminated by a RETURN key. Every paragraph in a
Final Copy document can have its own ruler settings. When you terminate
one paragraph by pressing the RETURN key, the program automatically
copies the ruler settings of the paragraph just terminated to the new
paragraph. The following settings can be made using the ruler:

 * Left margin
 * Right margin
 * First line indent
 * Tab stops
 * Hyphenation "hot-zone"
 * Paragraph justification
 * Line Spacing
 * hyphenation ON/OFF

 In addition to making the paragraph settings, the ruler amy also be used
to select master pages and various drawing tools, and to specify which
rulers are actually visible on the screen.

**** See Fig 1-9 ****


		    STARTING FINAL COPY FROM THE CLI
 Final Copy can be operated in either its own custom screen or on the
Workbench screen. The program's custom screen is a four colour screen
that uses predefined colours that you cannot change. If you want control
over screen colours you will need to operate Final Copy on your Workbench
screen.

 You can start Final Copy from either its Workbench icon, a Workbench
icon of a Final Copy document, or from the CLI. When you start Final Copy
fro m the CLI you can specify an optional command line parameter to
specify the type of screen you want to use. The options for this
parameter are:

 -WB  Workbench screen
 -CL  Custom interlace screen
 -CN Custom non-interlace screen

 In addition, when starting Final Copy from the CLI you can specify a
document to be opened. Below are example of starting Final Copy from the
CLI:

 FINALCOPY -CL WORK:DOCS/LETTER  Start FinalCopy on its own custom
				 interlace screen, and open the document
				 titled "Letter".

 FINALCOPY -WB		   Start FinalCopy on the Workbench screen.


			       TOOL TYPES
 The following can be added to Final Copy's program icon:

 NOICON		Don't create icons for saved documents.

 DOCDRAWER=PATHNAME    Use "pathname" as the default drawer when opening
		       or saving a document.

 GFXDRAWER=PATHNAME    Use "pathname" as the default drawer when
		       inserting an IFF ILBM graphic.

 MACRODRAWER=PATHNAME  Use "pathname" as the default drawer when "Other"
		       is selected from the ARexx menu.

 FONTDRAWER=PATHNAME   Use "pathname as the default drawer when opening a
		       font.

 MAKEBACKUP	    Instructs Final Copy to make a backup copy of a
		       document as it existed the last time it was saved.
		       The name of the backup document is the same as the
		       original with ".BAK" appended to the end. For
		       example, "Hello.BAK" would be the backup copy of
		       "Hello". Use of this tooltype ensures that you
		       have a back up of a document prior to new changes
		       you make. The only down side is that the backup
		       copy requires disk space.


			  CURSOR KEY FUNCTIONS
 As you get used to using Final Copy, you may wish to learn some of its
cursor key functions. The cursor keys are up, down, right, and left arrow
keys on the right side of the keyboard. When pressed, the cursor keys
achieve the following actions:

    CURSOR KEY     CURSOR ACTION

    Left_Arrow     Move to previous character
    Right_Arrow    Move to next character
    Up_Arrow       Move to previous line
    Down_Arrow     Move to next line

 The CTRL and ALT keys can be used to modify the action of the above
cursor keys. In the list that follows the "+" character indicates that
keys are pressed together. When cursor keys are pressed while holding the
CTRL, and/or ALT keys down, these actions result:

  KEYS		 CURSOR ACTION

  CTRL+Left_Arrow      Move to first current or previous word
  CTRL+Right_Arrow     Move to beginning of next word
  CTRL+Up_Arrow	Move to beginning of current or previous line
  CTRL+Down_Arrow      Move to beginning of next line

  ALT+Left_Arrow       Move to beginning of current or previous sentence
  ALT+Right_Arrow      Move to beginning of next sentence
  ALT+Up_Arrow	 Move to beginning of current or previous paragraph
  ALT+Down_Arrow       Move to beginning of next paragraph

  CTRL+ALT+Left_Arrow  Move to beginning of current line
  CTRL+ALT+Right_Arrow Move to end of current line
  CTRL+ALT+Up_Arrow    Move to beginning of document
  CTRL+ALT+Down_Arrow  Move to end of document

 If you also depress the SHIFT key with any of the functions described
above, the text through which you are moving will be selected (if not
already selected) or deselected (is already selected).


			   KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS
 Whenever a menu item appears with a letter to the far right of the
item's border, you have the option of using the keyboard to choose the
menu item rather than using the mouse.

 TO USE THE KEYBOARD TO CHOOSE A MENU ITEM:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1.  Hold down the "A" (Right Amiga) key that is on the right side of the
     spacebar on the keyboard.

 2. While continuing to hold down the "A" (Right Amiga) key, press the
key that is appropriate for the menu item you want to choose.

		   HELPFUL HINTS FOR BETTER DOCUMENTS

			 READABILITY AND LAYOUT
 The ultimate gaol of any documents is to be read. Your job, as the
creator of that document is to do everything in your power to make it
appealing and readable. Layout is merely a way of drawing a way of
drawing the reader through the pages and should never interfere with the
reader's ability to read and understand the message of the document.

 The following are some suggestions on how to make your document look
good and get read. These are just guidelines. There is no substitute for
your own instinct and experiment when it comes to making your document the
best it can be.

			  SERIF VS. SANS SERIF
 A serif typeface is one in which the strikes of the letters end with
small finishing strokes. Sans serif type do not.

			    MIXING TYPEFACES
 Final Copy gives you the flexibility to combine any number of typefaces
in your documents. If you follow a few general guidelines when mixing,
your results will be very effective.

 First, similar typefaces are normally not used together. That's why you
should not use two serif (or two sans serif) faces on the same page. The
substitutes that make each typeface unique are lost when two more similar
faces are competing.

 Second, minimize the number of typefaces, size, style, case formats,
etc. on each page. It may be tempting to use as many of Final Copy's
exciting features as possible in each document, but the result would be a
very busy, confusing jumble. By all means, experiment with your type, but
keep each document clean and readable.

 Third, provide a contrast between headlines and body text in your
document. You will notice that most publications use bold sans serif
typeface for headlines and a serif face for the text. There are reasons
for this tried and true practice. A bold sans serif face provides and
instant "pop" of recognition and legibility (an important requirement for
headlines), while serif face gives the readability that is so important
in larger blocks of text.

				BODY TEXT
 Sans serif type gives a clean, less conventional look to your text, but
is not as readable in large quantities as serif text. So while you might
wish to use sans serif type face occasionally for your body text,
remember that it is not usually as readable as a serif face.

				HEADLINES
 In order to be effective, headlines should be left justified. This
guideline is based on the rudiments of reading. Your eyes naturally wants
to move to the right and downward. A left justified headline has the
effect of pulling your reader's eyes into the body text below.

 Avoid all caps in a headline, too. A series of capital letters slows
down the readers ability to decipher the words, and you want the headline
to grab them quickly and pull them into the text.

 Above all, be consistent. All headlines in a document should be of
uniform size and style.

			 COLUMNS AND LINE LENGTH
 Studies have shown that seven to eight words per line are most readable
(a serif typeface may handle nine to ten words per line without
sacrificing too much readability). This may be achieved in several ways
using Final Copy's columns and type features.

 First, consider increasing the number of columns if you have large
blocks of text. If you elect to use very narrow columns, use left
justified type to avoid hyphenation and spacing problems that can occur
with full justified type.

 Second consider increasing the size of your type if it is very small.
Typical, body text is set in 10 or 12 point type. Anything smaller than
the alienates an older reader and impairs readability for readers of all
ages.

			      WHITE SPACES
 When designing your documents, do not hesitate to leave blank spots, or
white spaces in your documents. A page that is filled completely with
text and graphics can look overwhelming to a reader and decrease his or
her likelihood of actually reading your document. White space, however,
gives the page a feeling of openness and gives your reader room to
breathe.

 White space may be achieved in may ways. Try using wide margins, or
leaving empty space before or after a headline. To see how white space is
used by designers, study a few magazines, paying special attention to the
advertisements. Then take what you like and apply it to your own
documents.

		       WIDOWS, ORPHANS, AND RIVERS
 These are three big typographical problems with funny names. Avoiding
them whenever possible.

 A widow occurs when a paragraph ends and leaves less than seven
characters in the last line (the last line is called the widow). This is
made even worse when the last line is only a portion of a hyphenated
word. Adding a word or widening a margin slightly will usually correct a
widow.

 An orphan occurs when the last line of a paragraph is too long to fit
entirely at the bottom of a column and continues at the top of the next
column. An orphan may be corrected by removing words or lengthening a
column slightly.

 A river occurs when the spaces between words becomes greater than the
space between the lines. The phenomenon typically occurs only when you
are working with fully justified text. Be alert to any rivers of white
running vertically through your text. It may be possible to correct this
problem by switching to left justified text.
