I saw a few people who wanted this walkthrough, and since I'd just gotten
it down from a board here I thought that I'd post it for you all. Don't 
ask me about it, I havent even played the game yet (waiting till _after_
exams :(  ).

<MAJOR SPOILERS>



























On Saturday.
------------

This is a day for general stuff. To prepare the way. Very few
puzzles actually need doing today. Most of this stuff can be put
off.

Once you wake up from your dream. (cast the WOO spell and make a
move on the girl).

GET BOOK. D. NE. SIT. Once all is loaded on the carpet. the carpet
controls come on. TAKE OFF. Follow the directions in the DOX.TXT
file. Print that file up. It is very useful.

Once you get to Fort Naughtytail, you will have to push everything
off the carpet. Push the stuff off in whatever order you want. You
will find it all by the end on Monday anyway and the only things
you really need are the trunk and the lotion.

The game will carry you along until the confrontation with GLY.
Then cast the FRIMP spell on each barbell (SMALL, MEDIUM, LARGE)
just before he tries to lift them. FRIMP takes time to recharge so
only cast when he is standing before each barbell.

Go to the souvenir shop. (There is a mapping function in the game
so I will not give specific directions to most places). Near the
Hotel. Buy the UPPSSY spell.

Open all spell boxes if you have the book with you, this writes the
spell in the book for multiple uses.

Then go to the Casino near the center of the village. Cast the
UPPSSY spell on the casino (UPPSSY CASINO), when you are outside.
This makes it no longer "crooked" both literally and figuratively.
Then save the game and go in and PLAY RUELOTTO. Bet on number 6
until you win or have bet six times. If you win go outside and save
the game. If you lose restore. Remember if you didn't cast the
UPPSSY spell you can never win in the casino. Get about 1800 or so
gold. This will be as much as you need for the whole game. It takes
patience but it is worth it in the long run.

Once you have 1800 gold. Buy the key from the rummy in the
groggery.

Buy the slimfish from the fish stand in the fish market.

Go to the mouth of the cave and get the haunch. Take it to the end
of the road (From mouth of cave S.S.SW.)

Drop the haunch. Tomorrow there will be a hole under the fence.

Get the gloves batman dropped at the cliff road. At the bottom of
the cliff you will find one of the things you pushed overboard.

Go to the open shops (Pawnshop, hardware store and souvenir) BUY
ALL in each store except the pawnshop. There BUY BOX,BOMB. OPEN
BOX.

Leave everything but the BOOK AND SHOVEL in the lobby. Go to the
seafood restaurant (the TOURIST TRAP). SIT. ORDER BISQUE. when the
bisque gets there EAT BISQUE. GET ALL. N. The sheriff will bust you
for the first of many times in the game. To get out of jail. DIG.

Go to the hotel lobby and GO TO ROOM 911. Wait until someone offers
to sell you a good ticket and BUY TICKET. When your turn comes go
in. OPEN SUITCASE. OPEN RATANT BOX.

Go to the lighthouse at the jetty end. UP. Get bulb. Get treatise.

Go to the fort. L IN CANNON. GET MOSS.

Go to the lobby. DROP ALL. If you followed all instructions (and
had enough time) then the following items should be there.

Open the box. (SPUNJ SPELL)

Go west to enter maze game. One way of winning at the hard level
is:
