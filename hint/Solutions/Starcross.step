  * It is probably a good idea to save every now and then, just in case :-)

    You should save before beginning the sequence with the silver sphere,
    because the maintenance mouse sometimes wanders in and picks things up
    in the middle, which can be a pain. Also, save just after you put the
    red disk on the mouse since sometimes the mouse doesn't take the red
    disk to the garage in time.

  * Once the mouse has an item he can enter the garage from *any* location.
    Note that following the mouse around *lessens* the chance he'll enter
    the garage: if you're in the same room with him there's a 30% chance he
    won't even try to enter; if he tries there's a 16% chance he will.

  * If you have cut-and-paste capability you can just cut and paste each
    line below; the periods seperate the commands and the game will
    understand that.
