              A WALK-THROUGH for ERIC THE UNREADY from LEGEND

ReadMe.1st

        This walkthrough assumes that you've tried each section first
      and have at least made your own maps (use the F6 key), so that you
      don't need specific directions to go somewhere: eg. Go east, go
      north, kiss pig, etc.

        The adventure is made easier in that items which are no longer
      useful are conveniently removed from your inventory after each
      section.

        Be sure to collect and read the newspaper after each part.

Kissing Pig

        You need the rope from the barn to descend into the pit. For a
      laugh, EAT SHIT. Also get everything from the medicine chest
      beforehand. You'll need to use one of these items on the pig.

Next Day

        Wait until your squire gets you out of your armour. Attend the
      meeting at the Union Hall. Go to the armoury and answer the copy
      protection questions to get the cloak. Look in its pocket. Go back
      to your barracks and get the helmet. At the pond, fill the helmet
      with water. Go to the palace and talk to the guard. Get the
      kindling from the fireplace. Go outside and plant the bean in the
      garden. Water it. Climb the beanstalk. After the briefing by Bud
      the Wizard, take the magic coin and go to the torch vendor's. Then
      enter the ice cream parlour and talk to the boy. Make a fire,
      accept his earmuffs and wear them. Buy the float. Pay the bard to
      recite the epic and wait. Take him to the palace. Wait, then go
      upstairs and eavesdrop. Downstairs, wait until the fight breaks
      out. Outside, pull the banana from the stone. After another
      briefing from Bud (make a note of the five items of your quest,
      and WHERE you need to use them), go to the pond and follow his
      instructions regarding the banana.

In Quest of the Pitchfork

        Check out the graveyard, then get past the tree to the west by

      offer. Go to the rock shop and get your free gift. Use it to break
      into the house. Pull the rug and open the trap door. Get the beard
      from the trophy case. Go upstairs, and search the bones to get the
      ID. Go to the publishing house and give the prize offer to the
      dwarf. Go outside, wear the beard, kneel, and go in and try again.
      Go to the rock shop and get the starter rock. Wander around until
      someone gives you a coin. Win the memory game to get the catapult.
      Load it with the starter rock. Get on the ferris wheel, pull the
      lever and push the green button. At the top, shoot the red button
      with the catapult. Stand and get the pitchfork. Tie the cord to
      the roots and jump. Now go back to the house and go to the top.

      Go in. Attend the reciting of the legend and Lily's show at the
      auditorium. Go to the shooting gallery and shoot until you win a

      everything.


In Quest of the Crowbar

        Read the paper over the past few days and make a note of the two
      items about unicorns. Note the sad story in today's paper. Do what

      the leaf. Go to the temple. Take the robe, wear it and look in its
      pocket. Ring the fourth bell. Show the paper to the virgin and
      give her the hanky. Wait. Once outside, put the hanky and leaf in

      Clio. Give what he gives you to the repairgod. Get some nectar. Go
      to the Library and borrow books until you get one about reaching
      Mount Spa. Take it to the duplicator quickly before your loan
      expires. SAVE (or be prepared to UNDO). In the lab, work the
      machine (one of the switches is fatal) until you get a slimewig
      from it. Take it, go outside and get the message for Morty from
      the pigeon. Deliver it. When he calls in Clio, go outside and take
      the woad. Repeat this, and this time take the costume from the
      case. Read the bulletin board near the vending machine, ring for a

      the steak on the black eye. Take the candygram! Use the bolt
      cutters on the lightning. Turn the moon with the wrench. In the
      turret, turn the hourglass on its side. Take the eyeballs and put
      them in the sockets of the skull. Hoot. Answer the question (it's
      reflected, so the answer must be too). In the passage, look at
      what is right under the chain. In the dressing room, take the
      makeup, read it and apply it to the chain in the passage exactly
      half an hour before the wedding. Go back to the dressing room and
      get on the broom. It may take more than one attempt to reach the
      passage below the Great Hall. Open the trap door and come up under
      the cake. Wait and watch events unfold. At the right time, give
      the candygram to the witch. Take the princess and at the gates,
      blow the whistle. That's it.


        Enjoy!
