Before we start off, two important things:

1. At random places a spell won't work and you'll get comments
like "your fingers grow numb". Since there is nothing you can do
about this, I advise you to save frequently. Sometimes 'wait'
will help to make spell casting possible again.
2. After a while, you'll get tired in the adventure. You will
have to sleep then. Be very careful, because after you wake up,
you'll have forgotten all the spells you learned before you
started sleeping!!

Keeping these things in mind, we can begin:

write "9" on cube: learn blorple: blorple 9: s: sit on green
rock: take fragment: give fragment to green rock: sit on green
rock: look [this piece of the adventure is random, so I can't
give the exact commands: Once you're on the green rock, you can
move around on the lines on the ground, using commands like: 
rock, west. You should try to get in the same location as the
brown rock, since he's carrying a cube on his back! Every time
you let the green rock move one location, the brown rock moves
one location too. You should try to get the brown rock into a
corner, because when he makes his move then, you can always get
to him! The best way to do this is to map the area and use two
different coins, representing the green and the brown rock, so
you can keep track of their whereabouts. I found out that the
best way to start is:  w.ne.s.e and then you're on your own, but
it's random, so it could be different when you play it! Good
luck!]: jump on brown rock: take cube [25]: write "10" on cube:
learn blorple: blorple 10: d: learn snavig: drop all: take 10:
take book: d: snavig grue: d: climb on pillar: take cube [25]:
wait [until you are yourself again]: learn blorple: blorple 10:
d: take all: write "11" on cube: learn blorple: blorple 11: n:
take box: examine box [notice the figures on the box, which are
different for every cube you put in the box: this gives you the
chance to know which cube you should use, when you've given them
different names from the names I use: see the list below]: put 10
in box: take 10: throw box at outcropping: learn blorple: blorple
10: u [this is one of the directions you can't use normally,
although it seems to be there: this leads you to where the gold
box is and works with all these exits, provided you put the
corresponding cube in the box first!]: take box and cube [25]:
write "12" on cube: put all in zipper: take 7 and book: learn
blorple: blorple 7: s: ask belboz about me [He will ask you a
question to find out if you're not the cloaked figure: answer
this question correctly! If the program recognizes the answer,
but it's not the right one, you'll find out that you did
something wrong when you try to open the cabinet, much later in
the adventure!! Belboz should give you a key.]: ask about cube:
ask about figure: learn blorple: take 9: blorple 9: e: rezrov
door: put all in zipper: take book: [if you want to save before
the next puzzle, you'll have to do it here, since 'save' won't
work once you're in the outer vault!]: n: [* this puzzle is
random too, so I'll try to explain it:  There are 12 cubes here
and you should try to find the most powerful one. This can be
done using the jindak spell, which makes the pile with the
powerful cube glow more brightly. You only get three chances to
use the jindak spell! The trick is to make three piles of four
and compare two of them. The one that glows more brightly is the
pile with the powerful cube in it. Now swap two cubes from this
pile with two from the other pile and jindak again. This way
you've just two cubes left that can be the powerful one. Swap one
of these with any of the cubes in the other pile and jindak. Now
you know which cube is most powerful! See to it that you learn
the blorple spell before you jindak for the last time! Blorple
the powerful cube right away!! As an example I'll give you the
commands that worked with me:  take x1,x2,x3,x4,x7,x8: put x7,x8
in first: learn jindak (3 times): learn blorple: jindak [However,
the first pile is glowing more brightly:so the powerful cube is
either x5,x6,x7,x8]: take x7,x8: put x7,x8 in second: take
x9,x10: put x9,x10 in first: jindak [However, the first pile is
glowing more brightly:powerful is x5 or x6]: take x6: put x6 in
second: take x12: put x12 in first: jindak [However, the first is
glowing more brightly: cube x5 is the powerful one!!]: take x5:
blorple x5 :one final note:  when the piles glow with identical
brightness, the powerful one is in the pile you're holding
yourself! *]: [getting the cube is 25 points]: d [after blorple
powerful cube]: take key: unlock cabinet with key [here you find
out if you answered the question from Belboz correctly!]: open
cabinet: take vellum scroll [10]: examine vellum scroll: learn
all spells: again (6 times): [remember the description before?
Leave everything in the room the way it was when you first
entered it, otherwise you're memory will be confused and you die
using blorple]: put book in cabinet: close cabinet: lock cabinet
with key: rezrov door: blorple .. [powerful cube]: u: open sack:
take flimsy scroll: take burin: copy flimsy on vellum: take sack:
empty zipper in sack: put flimsy in zipper: close zipper: drop
zipper [this way you leave everything as you encountered it
before, remember?]: take 12: blorple 12: e: wait (3 times): take
knife: wait (6 times) [until it says:  Chortling gleefully, it
prepares to jump into the hypercube!]: girgol: take 11: put sack
in tesseract: wait. [This gives you 600 out of 600 points and
solves the adventure completely!!]
