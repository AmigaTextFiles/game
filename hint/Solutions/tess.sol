SOLUTION TO BEYOND THE TESSERACT
================================

Hint : Scan everything with the stack.
       Need some VERY basic knowledge of science & math.


WalkThru follows ....


Read book.
Put disk in projector slot.  Hit projector.  Push 4.  Read Tomb.
"THE ETERNAL SOUL".       <TES>
Stop reading.

Break prism into tetrahedron.  Read tetrahedron in UV-IR chromatic room.
"SEEKS THE EXACT".        <SE>

Eat Z-pills.  Sleep.
Prove supposition with postulate -> lemma.
Prove hypothesis with lemma -> theorem.  Give theorem to mathematician.
"REASONS AND ANSWERS".    <RA>
Wake.

Roll hexagon 4 times.  Do the last operation indicated "+nnn".
Sum of the 3 numbers generated = probability of getting the improbability.
Get improbability.  Drop improbability in the field of absolute certainty.
The field warps to an eastern exit -> integral.  Differentiate integral
with the undifferentiable function -> singularity.  Put singularity in
groove in the audio device.  Wear audio.
_Y_ hexagon -> 4D solid.  Melt solid with plasma -> 4D liquid.
_Y_ strip -> klein bottle.  Fill klein with liquid.  Pour klein in plant.
Listen.
"OF COUNTLESS TESSERACTS".   <CT>

pop stack all the way back up.  Say TESSERACT.


           *********  DONE  ********

btw, u can THINK in the twilight of thought -> idea.
EVALUATE the idea -> contradiction.
but u must drop the contradiction before u can prove anything.

sasi.
