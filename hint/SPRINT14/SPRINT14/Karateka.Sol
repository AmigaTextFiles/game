this file is written in order to teach you how to win the game
"karateka," by broderbund.

unlike an adventure walk through, you still have to learn the moves.
i will explain what to do to win the game, after that, it is up to
you.


[:] [:] [:] [:] [:] [:] [:] [:] [:] [:]


i consider the game in 3 levels.  the first level is outside of the
castle, the second level is inside, and the third is under the first
level. each level has its own group of fighters, although the third
level is somewhat intermixed. you must have complete mastery of the
controls in order to win this game. if you can't control your man,
practice.  it is not too difficult, using the joystick of course.


level one
---------

when you start this level, you have just climbed the castle and you
are standing in front of an enemy. notice this man's head.  it is by
the head, or mask, that each fighter is distinguished from the other.
against these fighters of level one, there are two strategies you can
use.

   1. kick in the foot method

        this method is almost "cheap." these fighters will move
towards you constantly.  all you have to do is stand back and whenever
they move forward, do a downward kick three times.   if you do this a
sufficient number of times, the man will die.  you might suffer a few
blows, but that is no problem.  you will kill all the guards.


   2. banzai method

        the other strategy you can use on the first level guards is
the so called banzai method. all you do here is press both buttons all
the time while moving forward.  by pressing both buttons, you will be
kicking and punching randomly, thus confusing and killing the guard.
this method will not work on any other level, i guarantee it.


hints: remember that the first level guard will always be moving
forward. take advantage of this be remembering that he will be on the
wrong foot for an attack.
        after you kill the first guard, run immediately.  after the
internal display, an enemy guard will begin to run to you.  keep
running when the screen switches back to you.  when it switches back
to the guard, and then to you, count to two and let up.  you will be
in perfect position for an attack.



level two
---------

(the bird appears in this level. please see the explanation of the
bird in the third level)
note that the first guard encountered in the second level is a first
levelguard! this level is much like the first, except that the guards
do not move forward all the time.  this eliminates the "kick in the
foot" method.  also, the banzai method will not work because the
guards are often waiting for an attack.
        when you encounter a level two guard, he will usually, after
the usual tangle and seperation, begin a kicking sequence.  by saying
the "usual tangle and seperation," i am alluding to the fact that you
will rush up to him, fight a bit, and then back off or be knocked off.
anyway, when you seperate, the guard will do several 1-kicks, and then
either move forward or being doing 3-kicks. a 1-kick is a single kick,
while a 3-kick is a series of 3 kicks. here is what you can do:  when
the guard does a 1-kick, as soon as his foot begins to retreat, move
forward and punch. i usually prefer to punch downward in this attack,
but it is not that important.  now, you might be asking what if he is
doing a 3-kick and i think it is a 1-kick?  the answer is that you
will get knocked several times.  knowing that the first several times
are 1-kicks, you can either wait until he begins 3-kicks or just guess
and hope. if you guess wrong and the blows start falling, pull out
because you are in a bad position to kick, your legs are crossed, and
you can not benefit out of a 1 for 4 trade off.
        if the guard begins to charge at you, the kick in the foot
method will not always work, mainly because the guard comes at you
with a kick already going. what yuo should do here:

   1.  hope he is doing a 1-kick and get knocked but the punch him.

                 or--

   2.  pull back quickly, wait until his foot is releasing, and then
go in for the kill. if you are losing the fight, i would recommend the
second method.
the falling gate:
when you get to the end of the second level, there is a gate.  if you
run or walk through the gate, it falls on you and you die.  always.
this is what you do. walk very slowly up to the gate and get right
next to it.  then quickly move forward and the back. you must do this
fast of you will die. the gate will
then fall, but, not on you.  as the gate begins to rise, run into it.
notice i said, run, not walk.  you will lose a point every time your
head hits the gate, but keep running and start early so you have time.
as you run through the gate, you get to the third level.

level three
-----------
the level three guards are not stupid and are fast. they will not
charge foolishly towards you, and will wait for the kill.  also at
this point, you have very few points compared to the guards, so be
careful and watch how many points you have. the basic strategy that i
employ when fighting level three guards is this:

  1. wait until the start doing kicks.

  2. move in quickly and hit them with a punch, maybe two if you are
lucky. if they stand there, kick them, if they move back, that is
fine. you just inflicted 1 or 2 points on them at no cost to yourself.

  3. if they insist on fighting, your best bet is to punch.  in the
time that it takes to get a kick going, they will punch you away.
remember that if one kick nails you, more are coming, so get out of
the way fast.

the bird:  the bird is very difficult to kill. however, once you get
it down, it becomes easy. after you have killed 4 level 3 guards, you
will suddenly get a large amount of points. you will get to a blocked
door in front of you. when you go to kick it in, do an upwards kick.
as soon as the door breaks in, wait a millisecond, and then do 2 more
up kicks.  this will knock the bird before it gets a chance on you.
from here on, it is up to you.  i prefer kicking the bird and it is
easiest when it is on the top level. just wait until the bird is 1 1/2
inches in front of you, and then kick 3 times. if you get it good, if
not, try again.

akima himself:  he really is no different than any other level 3
guard. ignore the fact that he appears bigger and concentrate on
getting in 1 or 2 punches after some kicks. kill him, run into the
room where the princess is standing.if you walk, she kills you.  just
run right into her. one technique that i did not mention is spar
fighting.  in this method, just wait until he is not kicking, jump up
and punch.  there is a delayed reaction, so pull back right after you
have hit the button.  you might think you will not punch, but you will
and usually hit.  sometimes you will get hit back, but not always.
you can use this technique on the level 3 guards which can be
difficult sometimes.


i hope this explains how to win in this game.  just practice, and it
becomes easy.
