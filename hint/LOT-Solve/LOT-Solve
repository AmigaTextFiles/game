LABYRINTH OF TIME

I have been thinking of writing a solve for Labyrinth of Time for awhile
now. So I would like to thank Kim Borbjerggaard for inspiring me by
writing a small solve for Labyrinth which I have added to considerably.

apaulo@qb.island.net

BEGINNING

The game begins in the subway car and all you have in your inventory is
a single quarter.  Don't use this coin in anything other that the pay
phone at the end of the hall in the 50's Diner on the upper level.  Got
that?  Good. When wandering around the various levels and areas of this
game, click the eye icon on the various walls and lights etc., there are
some very nice pics in this game.

You'll begin the game in a subway car on the middle level.  You can exit
the middle level in one of three ways; by using the elevator in the
hotel, by falling through the city street when you cross against the red
light which is through the south exit door in the subway, or by the stairs
which you will come to after making your way through the MEDIEVAL MAZE.  As
the exit door to the south of the subway car is secured all you can do is
bravely exit the subway car by the west exit and walk into the hotel.  When
you first enter the hotel there will be two doors, one you can open and one
is locked.  Go into the one you can open and have a look around.  Nothing
of importance happens here, but it is worth checking out.  You will go back
to the locked one later, when you find the key.  The only other room of
interest is Number 14, the other rooms you can't enter anyway as they have
do not dirturb signs on them.  This is the room with the wardrobe in it
(which is locked) and the key to it is located in the western town on the
upper level.  There is one other door you can enter on this level, which is
the door to the mirror maze which is located across from the elevator which
is in the south hallway of the hotel.  For now we will go to the western
town and get the key for the wardrobe.  To get to the western town, go up
in the elevator.  The door you see straight ahead of you goes to the
theatre, go through there for now and walk through the balcony section and
out the other exit this will take you to a wall.  Notice the slider puzzle
on the wall, the correct alignment for the slider pieces is located in the
construction site at the end of the hedge maze on the upper level.  When
you eventually find this area you will line up the pieces in the right
sequence and the wall will open.  Now go back to the lobby by the elevator,
the door to the detectives office is locked you will get this key later.
Now turn right.  you will be facing south at this point, walk through the
doorway and down the hallway.  As you exit the hallway, notice the temple
floating in the air, this is your ultimate objective.  At this point turn
right and head,across the crystal cliffs, through the cave entrance and
down the tunnel.  At the end of the tunnel turn left and go through the
multi-colored doorway into the railway car.  Have a look around the railway
car and the town.  The locked door at the west end of the railway car is
never opened, I never found a key for it.  The door at the east end of the
railway car gives you another view of your objective.  The only places of
importance are the newspaper office, the sheriff's office and the mine
tunnel.  Nip into the sheriff's office and open the drawer on the desk,
look in the drawer and take the brass key inside.  Oh, and while you're
here, pop into the saloon and grap the bottle of whiskey, you can take a
drink from it periodically if you wish.  Now head back to room 14 in the
hotel when you are finished exploring.  Open the wardrobe, look inside and
take the journal and the card.  The journal has an interesting story in it
and will later reveal a clue when you have accomplished a couple of tasks,
more on that later.  The card is used to turn on the various teleporters in
the game.  For now we will head for a teleporter which is located at the
end of the mirror maze.


MIRROR MAZE

Go to the doorway across from the elevator and walk inside, now go
through the insanely laughing clowns mouth and follow the map below.
When you get to Morgan in the centre of the maze, do not use your
quarter in him unless you save your game first.  If you put your quarter
in before saving your game, he will tell you, "You will wish you had
that coin back" and then you will have to start over as you can not
finish the game without that quarter.  So save your game first and then
plunk in your quarter and watch the animation.


 [R]--[R]--[R]  [R]--[R]--[R]    R  = Room
  |         |    |         |     M  = Morgan

 [R]--[R]--[R]  [R]--[R]--[R]
                 |
               [CR]


Once you make it through the maze you can use the cardkey in the
teleporter slot, After using the cardkey you must press one of the
buttons to teleport. The green button will teleport you to the library,
the blue button to the museum.


MUSEUM

Pressing the blue button takes you to the museum where you should pick up
the alien belt (I never found a use for this, outside of the fact it
flashes).  There are also three levers here, pulling the levers will place
or remove bridge sections, they are also used in conjunction with some
other levers later in the game.

Pulling the left lever will remove a bridge section from the mine and the
one under the subway causing the subway car to be crushed but don't despair
as it can be 'pumped up' with the bicycle pump which is found in a toolbox
at the construction site on the upper level after you solve the slider
puzzle.  You have to crush the subway anyway to get an item you need.
After the car has been crushed and you pump it up, check out the legs
sticking out from under the subway car, it ain't Kansas anymore.  Also as I
mention later in the solve, I have played two complete games and one time
the subway was crushed and one time it was not.  I'm assuming that pushing
the left lever back up causes the subway car to be crushed as you replace
the bridge section when you do this and it is sitting on top of the subway
car. When you leave here make sure all levers are down.

Next press the green button to teleport to the library, the orange button
takes you back to the control room.  The cave and the mountain road can be
reached by teleporting from the southern-most room of the library.  The
first time you exit the cave and walk across the road, you will narrowly
dodge the falling rocks and they won't injure you.  However, to cross back
you must be wearing the hekmet which is found in the south-east corner of
the medieval maze.  You will not be able to pass the rocks if you aren't
wearing the helmet.  Safety first.


CRETAN PALACE

After crossing the mountain road and dodging the falling rocks you will be
facing east in a Cretan hall.  Walk down the hallway and go through the
doorway.  You will be in another Cretan hall, there are two exits from this
hall.  If you turn left you will end up on a bridge platform, this is were
you will cause pieces of a bridge to appear to get to the doorway in the
temple.  For now turn right and go through the doorway, you will be in the
Cretan Palace, have a quick wander round and take the Labrys which you can
find in the central room inside the large circular well.  Also note the
design on the door in the palace, you need to place an artifact there from
King Minos tomb.  Below is map of palace.


             [CH]
               |                                                  N
      [R]-[R]-[R]-[C]      R  = Room

 [TR]-[R]-[W]-[R]          W  = Well with Labrys
       |   |   |           C  = Courtyard to Medieval maze        S
      [R]-[R]-[R]          TR = Throne room of Minos


Now on to the medieval maze.


MEDIEVAL MAZE

The maze is located on the middle level to the east of the cave and the
Cretan palace.  To navigate through the maze to get the helmet and exit
maze follow map below.


                        [WC]

     [R]-[R] [R]-[R]-[R]-[R]    H  = Helmet
          |   |           |     WC = Wierd Cave, to 50's Diner
 [C]-[R] [R] [R]-[R]-[R]-[R]
      |   |   |   |
     [R]-[R] [R] [R]-[R]-[R]                  N

     [R]-[R] [R]-[R]-[R]-[R]                W | E
      |   |           |   |
     [R]-[R]-[R]-[R]-[R] [H]                  S


After getting the helmet make your way to the upper level and the 50's
diner through the northwest exit from the maze.


50's DINER

Upon exiting the Medieval Maze you will be in a wierd cave, go through
the doorway in front of you.  After climbing the stairs, the first
object you'll find is a can of paint.  This is very important so be sure
to take it.  Now turn to your right and enter the diner.  Have a look
around check things out but do not use your quarter in the jukebox.
After checking out the diner exit it were the sign is for the telephone
and head down the hall to the pay phone (another view of the Temple),
drop your quarter in the slot on top of the phone.  After inserting the
coin in the slot, thirteen coins will fall onto the stool underneath the
pay phone. Pick up the quarters.  Use a coin on the jukebox, and get the
silver key from the coin return.  After retrieving the silver key, go
back to the pay phone and put a quarter in the coin slot for the pay
toilet.  Now enter the hedge maze.

 [D]


After dashing through this maze you'll enter a construction site.  Take
the screwdriver lying on the workhorse and jote down the numbers on the
west wall.  These numbers are the solution to the theatre slider puzzle.

You also have the silver key, it's now time for a long walk back to the
detective's office on the middle floor.  On the way through the Mirror maze 
you can plunk some quarters into Morgan and he will give you some advice in 
the form of riddles. See below.

- Whatever will be will be, Doris Day
- It's all done with mirrors.
- If one could speak to the past, how would it answer.
- Some doors were never meant to be opened.
- Sometimes a closed door is greater than an open one.
- You will meet a tall dark stranger.
- The future is what the past has made it.
- If you cannot reach your goal, you must learn to build bridges.
- A blank piece of paper, is full of potential.
- Beep Beep - Harpo Marx
- Great power hides behind the thrones of Kings.
- Morgan the Magician says you should figure it out yourself.

Use the silver key to open the detectives door and take the iron key which
will open the jail cell in the sheriff's office.  I never found a use for
the Falcon statue or the notes.

Just hang onto the key for the jail cell right now as you do not really
need it until later on near the end of the game, but if you want you can
check out the jail cell and get the gun under the blanket. The gun is never
used in the game. You can also do this later near the end of the game.

So where to next? Go to the slider puzzle on the wall outside the theatre,
and line up the slider puzzle like it was on the wall in the construction
site. Ah, forgot to write it down did you, here it is. :)

7  2  9  10
1  11 5  13 
8  15 14 12 
3  4  6

Once you solve the puzzle the wall will open reveailing another entrance to
the construction site.  Look inside the toolbox to get the gold key and the
bicycle pump. Never got the spigot to turn in the keg.

Once you have the golden key you can open the locked door in the hotel
across from the washroom.  Note the door in the rock wall with the
combination lock.  In the servant's room note the message on the wall.
There is a blank sheet of paper in the closet which you must use with the
printing press in the western town on the upper level.  I never found a use
for the broom, bucket or teapot.  Once you have printed the newspaper,
return it to the servant's room and place it underneath the sign on the
wall.  Also while you are in the Western Town, go into the mine and push
the mine cart down the tracks, it will crash through the door as the bridge
section has been removed by pulling the left lever down in the Museum.
While there get the lantern behind the door and you can get the sword in
the stone if you want and become the King of England.  I never found a use
for it.


SURREAL MAZE

Next you're going to need the shirt so return to the subway car and pump it
up with the bicycle pump. Hm, I re-played this game as I wrote the solve to
make sure it was correct and the subway car was not crushed. There was
still some legs sticking out from under the subway car, but this time there
was a different message when you looked at the legs. With the subway car
crushed and pumped back up the message said "You don't seem to be in Kansas
anymore". This time the message was "You wonder if Minos will get your little
dog to". The only thing I can remember doing different in the museum was to
leave all three levers pulled down. My original game I did not leave all
three levers down, also if you pull the left lever down and then push it
back up you will see the bridge section lying on the crushed subway. Though
this could be what crushes the subway, by pushing the lever back up the
bridge section does in the subway Hm. Once the subway car is restored go
south to the locked door. The door can be opened by unscrewing the screw in the
latch with the screwdriver and then taking out the screw. Once you remove the
screw you can open the door and enter the city streets. If you still have a
quarter left you can buy a newspaper, but I never found a use for it. Nor 
did I ever find any keys for the doors on the street. Actually all you can 
do is walk down the street and attempt to cross the intersection. Whereupon
you fall down to the bottom of a well. Now walk ahead and you will be in
the main room in the Surreal maze. You will be facing the chair and the TV.
Follow the directions below exactly and you will make it to the Ziggurat. 

Okay go S,S,S,S,S,W,W,W,S. 

On the third south you will be in the main room again, but that is okay,
after all it is a surreal maze, on the fifth south you should be in the
room with the red brick wall and pulsating black doorway.  Also the frame
around the doorway should be wood curved at the top.  When you turn to the
west you should be facing the stone doorway with the curved top.  After
three wests you should be back in the red brick room facing the stone
doorway.  Now if you did it correctly turn and enter the Ziggurat.  If it
didn't work try it again.  This is the most reliable way I found to find
the Ziggurat. Now head west and go up the stairs and push the column you
find there. If you are playing on an IBM through the shell it may freeze up
on you here, so save before you try this. A lady I know with an IBM had
this happen to her and to get past this point she had to play this part by
starting the game from Windows.  After the column is moved it will open the
two doors halfway down the stars.  Go down the stairs and enter the
lefthand door.  Hm, kind of dark aye, time to turn on that lantern, and
follow map below.  For now do not move the red switch as you will be 
teleported after moving any switches in the Ziggurat and you might as well
have the shirt with you.  The three switches you find here operate
different parts of the bridge in conjunction with the ones in the museum.
So go to the yellow lever pick up the dirty shirt and push the lever.  Also
on the map were it shows there is an entrance to another room, I never got
in there.  If you left any of the two right levers in the museum up, not
sure which one there will be a bridge section leaning against the wall.


                         [W]    W  = Well
                      ____|_    SM = Surreal maze                  N
                     |      |   Z  = Ziggurat outside
                     |  SM  |   M  = Mayan Ziggurat inside       W | E
                     |      |   R  = Red Lever
    -[M]-[R]-[M]     |______|   Y  = Yellow lever + dirty shirt    S
      |       |       |         P  = Purple lever
 [M]-[M] [Z]-[Z]-[Z]-[Z]
  |   |       |
 [Y]-[M]-[P]-[M]


You will now find yourself on the bridge platform with one section of the
bridge in place, the dirty shirt must be taken to the laundry chute on the
upper level in the hotel and dropped inside.  The shirt will appear, clean
and pressed, later in the servant's room under the sign.

Now what do I do about the combination lock - how do I open it?  Well, the
combination to the lock can be found in the journal which you found in the
wardrobe in the hotel on the middle level.  However, the combination will
only appear after you have cleaned the shirt and put the newspaper you
printed under the note in the servant's room.  The locked door will allow
access to King Minos tomb.  Now at this point when I read the journal it
turns out the number was wrong.  The combination is the date for the last
entry.  In my game the date was 4/8/12, which is obviously wrong as the
year does not follow the rest of the journal.  The correct combination is
4/8/72, don't forget zeros in front of the 4 and 8.  Open the door and
enter King Minos tomb and wander down to the sarcophagus and open it and
pick up the Cretan ornament.  There is also a pith helmet that you can pick
up but I never found any use for it.  Hm, I wonder were this ornament goes,
look familiar, no?  You place the ornament in the door in the Cretan
palace, once opened move the throne and take the other can of paint.

Now you will have to return to the Ziggurat and pull the purple lever to
place another section of bridge, after pushing the lever you will be back
on the bridge platform with two sections of the bridge in place, with one
more to go.  Now once again make your way to the Ziggurat and pull the
final red lever.  Hurray you are once again on the bridge platform with
your bridge completed.

Now head to the museum and look inside the broken display case. There will 
be something there. It appears only after the bridge is finished. Take the 
Mayan Talisman and head for the bridge. Oops, ended up in jail for theft 
did we, never fear you have a key. If you haven't been here before check
out gun under the blanket. Now release yourself from jail and head for the 
bridge yet again. Once there cross over and enter the maze centre. You will 
be facing the minotaur. Notice the light shining on him, well do something 
about it. Get rid of the light, how you say, well paint over the mirrors. 
Now place the Labrys in the indentation were the minotaurs head was and 
then use mayan talisman on the pyramid keystone. It will be blasted to 
pieces, now sit right back and I I'll tell you a tale, oops wrong era. 
Enjoy the ending animation. To the best of my knowledge Labyrinth II never 
came out.

Wonderful game, would love another one like it.
