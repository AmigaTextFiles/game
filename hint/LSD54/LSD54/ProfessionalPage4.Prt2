PRINTING COLOR
--------------

All  of  the  color  information you have created with Professional Page is
intended  for  use widh the Professional Color separator.  However, you can
still  print  any document containing color information in black and white,
without using the separator.  Any color information will be printed as gray
tones.

7. DESIGN...
------------

There  are two things to consider when designing something for publication.
The  first  is  the  idea that you are trying to convey.  The second is the
reader.  If you understand what it is you are trying to convey and to whom,
you will find it much easier to design a suitable publication.

Consider  the effect that design has on you as a reader.  For example, when
you  read  a  newspaper,  do  you read everything?  Probably not.  You scan
headlines  and read articles that look interesting.  What draws your eye to
an  article  or  advertisement?   More  often than not, it is an attractive
layout,  a  striking  illustration,  or  an  interesting  headline.  On the
printed  page  form  and  content  are  forever  linked.   When it comes to
catching the eye of a reader the way the infornation is presented can be as
vital as the informlation itself.

Printed  communication  is a dialogue between the reader and the publisher,
client,  or author.  The quality of the publication's design can affect the
reader's  choice  as  much  as can their personal interests.  An advedising
agency spends most of its time creating a concept and a graphic design that
makes  their  ad  stand  out  from  all  others yet still convey a specific
message.   If  you want a message to reach more readers, spend as much time
on the presentation of the message as on the rnessage itself.

This  is not to suggest that you substitute design for content.  Attractive
typography and layout show respect for the reader's needs, it makes reading
more  pleasurable and productive, and this gives your client the best value
for his or her money.

This  section  discusses  typography,  page  layout,  and  design from this
perspective.   As  a desktop publisher, you want your documents to be read.
By  taking  the  time  to improve your layout skills your creations will be
more popular with your readers.

This  section  begins  with  the  basics of typography, and continues on to
discuss effective page layout.

TYPOGRAPHY
----------

In  Professional  Page,  typography can be changed at any point in the body
text.   TYpography  includes  the  typeface,  size,  style,  kerning,  line
spacing, baseline shifts, hyphenation, and justification.

All  typography  attributes  can be set in Professional Page's text editor.
Many  of  the  attributes  can also be set by embedding format codes in the
word processor's text (see Appendix F:  Formatting Text).

Typography is used in the text editor in two ways:

*  In  block mode:  Once a block of text is marked (see "Text" in the Using
Professional  Page  section),  the typography of the first character in the
block  is  reflected  in  the  Type  menu.   Pull down theType menu and the
typographical  attributes  are  shown  with  checkmarks  beside  the chosen
values.  Should a list not have a sub-item with a checkmark beside it, call
up  the requester for that submenu, and the current value will be displayed
in  its  text  line.   Although  the  attributes displayed in the Type menu
reflect  the  first  character  of  the  block,  changing the typographical
attributes affects the entire block.

* In Text mode:  The text cursor can be postioned using the mouse or cursor
keys.   The  Type  menu  will  take  on the typographical attributes of the
character  just  before  the  text  cursor  position.   Therefore,  without
changing  the  typography,  the  next  character  typed  will look like the
character  before  it.  Changing these type attributes will affect the next
character  typed.   However,  should  you  move  the cursor position before
typing  a  character,  the Type menu will reflect the typography at the new
cursor location and any previous typographical changes made will affect the
next character to be typed.

NOTE:   Be  sure  to  set the attributes at the beginning of the box, since
there  is  no  previous  character to set the attributes for the next typed
character.

Let's review type terminology
-----------------------------

Letterforms are composed of the following elements:

(72 point "Type")
Ascender
X-Height
Serif
Baseline
Descender

Units of Measure
----------------

Typeface  sizes  are measured in points.  There are approximately 72 points
in  an  inch.   However,  the  12  point pica has become a standard unit of
measure.

Units  of  measure  (inches,  picas,  and  centimeters) are selected in the
Preferences/Layout  Tools/Units  of Measure sub-item.  Rulers, Coordinates,
and  all  other  positioning  tools  use the current unit of measure.  When
using  picas,  the  number before the decimal place is the number of picas,
and  the  number  after  the  decimal place is the number of points not the
decimal fraction of the pica.

Styles of Typeface
------------------

Professional  Page supports a variety of PostScript typefaces (see Appendix
K:   Fonts)  which can be selected via the Type/Typeface menu item.  If the
desired  typeface  does  not appear in the sub-item list, select New.  This
lists all the ypefaces known to Professional Page at the time.  You can now
pick the needed typeface from the list.

Serif
-----

Serifs  are  horizontal  widenings  or  crosslines  at the ends of the main
strokes  of  a  letter  (this  text is set with a serif typeface).  A serif
helps  the  horizontal flow in reading the text which makes serif typefaces
more suitable for body copy.

Sans Serif
----------

Sans  serif  typefaces  have  constant  widths  on  the main strokes of the
letters  or characters.  They have a cleaner, more "modern" appearance, but
are harder to read in long passages.

Roman
-----

For  most  typefaces,  the Roman version is the normal, balanced version of
the  typeface,  such  as  you are reading now.  A Roman style typeface with
serifs on the characters has been shown to be more readable than sans serif
or italics.

Styles
------

Bold, Italic, Underline, and outline styles are accessible through the Type
menu.

Novelty or Specialty
--------------------

If  you  look  through  type  catalogues,  you  will  find  many script and
decorative  letterforms  mainly  used for headlines and advertising display
type since they are quite uncomfortable to read in longer passages.

Type Size and Column Size
-------------------------

Professional Page is capable of handling type sizes up to 127 points.  Type
Sizes  are  generally  categorized as either Text or Display.  Text type is
usually  fourteen points or smaller, and Display type is more than fourteen
points.   Your  choice  of  typeface  is very important for the reader.  "8
point  Eyestrain"  is  not only a description of a typeface, but a reminder
that your typeface choice directly affects the reader.

Column Width
------------

For easiest reading, body copy (the text of an article) should be set in at
least  a  ten  point  typeface in columns no smaller than one alphabet wide
(a-z).   An  optimum length is one and one-half alphabets.  The alphabet is
used  to  measure  this because it has a balance of character widths.  As a
general rule, a column of text should be not wider than two alphabets.

Another  popular  rule  of thumb is that the length of line in picas should
not  exceed  twice  the  point size.  If you are using ten point type, then
colunlns  should  be  no  more  than twenty picas in length.  A line should
average nine to ten words.

Kerning
-------

Kerning is the fitting of pairs of letters closer together or farther apart
to  make  the  letter  spacing more readable.  This is becauge some letters
naturally  fit closer together.  For example:  letter pairs such as AT, Tu,
Ve,  Wo, Te, and To.  Professional Page has automatic kerning, which can be
turned  on  and  off  by  selecting the Type/Kerning item.  When kerning is
selected,  type  will  have  a more compact, and consistent letter spacing.
Manua]  kerning  is  done  by  tracking two letters (see "Tracking" in this
section).

Line Spacing
------------

Line  Spacing  is  the  amount  of  space  inserted  between lines of text.
Sufficient line spacing makes text more readable.  There is no set rule for
the  amount  of  line  spacing you should use, but there are severa] useful
guldelines:

*  A  sans  serif typeface may need more line spacing than a serif typeface
because it has less honzontal flow.

*  The  longer the measure (the wider the colunn), the more line spacing is
necessary  in  order for your eye to pick up the next line as you read down
the page.

*  Small  point  sizes need proportionately more line spacing to spread out
the type and make it easier to read.

*  "Fat"  typefaces  (those  with  large a x-height and short ascenders and
descenders) need more line spacing than typefaces with a small X-height and
long ascenders and descenders.

Professional Page offers four kinds of line spacing:

* Fixed
* Relative
* Leading
* Paragraph Spacing.

Line  spacing  in Professional Page is calculated from the top of a capital
on  one line to the top of a capital on the line below it.  To set the line
spacing,  select  Type/Line Spacing.  A Line Spacing requester will appear.
Select  one of the Fixed, Relative, or Leading sub-items by clicking on the
appropriate  button.   Enter  the  line  spacing  value  desired  into  the
appropriate text line.

Fixed line spacing and Leading are defined in points (for example, 10 point
text on 11 point body would insert one point of leading between each line).

Relative  line spacing is defined as a percentage of the largest text point
size on the line.  For example, 10 point text with relative line spacing of
110% would have one point of leading between lines.  If "baseline shift" is
active on the line, the program will automatically adjust inte-line spacing
accordingly.

Leading (pronounced "ledding") is the constant space between lines of text.
It  gets  it  name  from the strips of lead that were once used to separate
lines  of  type  when  typesetting  was  done using slugs of cast hot metal
(lead)  to  form  each  line of type.  The body text of this manual was set
using 12 point type woth leading of 2 points.  This could be defined:

* fixed line spacing 14.00 (i.e.  14 points)

* leading 2.00 (i.e.  2 points of leading in excess of the point size)

* Relative 117% (i.e.  117% of the point size)

Extra  spacing  between  paragraphs is often useful in indicating paragraph
divisions  clearly.   The Paragraph Spacing sub-item allows extra paragraph
spacing  to  be  set  as  a  percentage  of  the current line spacing.  The
interparagraeh  spacing  between  text  paragraphs of this manual is set at
150%  of  line  spacing (i.e.  150% of 14 points or 19 points total between
paragraphs).

Tracking
--------

Tracking  is the adjustment of the horizontal spacing between characters by
the  insertion  or  deletion  of  space.  Tracking is specified in terms of
hundredths  (or  a  percentage)  of  a  em space.  It can be performed on a
marked  block  by either selecting the Type/Tracking menu-item or using the
left  and  right cursor keys.  Each press of these keys adjusts tracking by
2% of a em space.

Baseline Shifts
---------------

In  some cases, not all text in a column is set in uniformly straight lines
(for   example,  when  setting  mechanical  equasions,  or  using  sub  and
superscripts).   To  allow  you  to  control  variations in the baseline of
sections  of  text  mark a block of text, and then move its baseline up and
down.   Select  the  Type/Baseline  item  and  a  Baseline  Shift requester
appears.   Type the point size of the baseline shift into the text line for
example:

              +5.000 to move up five points

              -5.000 to move down fie points

and  the marked block will be moved up or down.  It can also be adjusted by
using  the up and down cursor keys.  Each press will adjust the baseline by
1/2 point.

Paragraph Indents and Tabs
--------------------------

Tabs  are  specified  on a box-by-box basis (see the Set Tabs gadget in the
Box/Alter/Active  item).   When  a tab position is entered in the requester
the  cursor  skips to the next available location.  The paragraph indent is
also specified in the Set Tabs requester.

The  first line of a paragraph can be flush with the body of the paragraph,
indented,  or  outdented  ("hanging").  Paragraphs in the body ttxt of this
manual are all "flush", and all items preceeded by "bullets" are an example
of "hanging" indents.

Justification
-------------

Justification  is  the method of setting text so that itl lines up with the
left, right, both, or neither margins of the box.  Text can be:

Flush  justified.   Text  is  flushed  to both left and right margins.  The
spacing  between  words  is  adjusted  so that both left and rigjht margins
align.

Left  justified.   Text is flushed left, leaving a ragged right edge to the
paragraphs.  This is sometimes referred to as "flush left/ragged right".

Right  justified.  Text is flushed right, leaving a ragged left edge to the
paragraphs.  This is sometimes referred to as "flush right/ragged left".

Centered.   Text  is  centered  on  each line.  This produces both left and
right ragged margins.

The  justification  of  the line is determined by the justification setting
for the first character of that line.

Hyphenation
-----------

Hyphenation  is the breaklng of a word at the end of a line so that part of
the  word  appears at the end of the line, and the rest of the word appears
at  the  beginning of the following line.  This allows you to create better
proportioned   word   spacing,  especially  in  narrow  columns.   Text  is
hyphenated in Professional Page poge in two ways.

The program has a hyphenation algorithm and a built-in exception dictionary
which  look  for where to break the word.  Hyphenation can be turned on and
off by selecting Type/Hyphenation.  To not hyphenate a word, block the word
and  turn  hyphenation off.  To control the number of characters before and
after  a  hyphen select Preferences/Hyphenation Control, and type the value
you  want  (the  default  value  is two).  The larger the prefix and suffix
value,  the  harder it is for the hyphenation program to break small words,
but the less likely it is that you will see odd word breaks.

The  program  also  uses  a  user-defined  hyphenation-exception dictionary
containing a list of words with permissible word breaks specified.  You can
customize  the dictionary by using the text editor of your choice to create
a  list of words with the prefenred breaks indicated by hyphens.  If a word
is not to be hyphenated enter the word without hyphens.  To access the list
in Professional Page, select the Preferences/Hyphenation Control item.  You
may  now load your list in as the new exception dictionary or merge it with
the existing one.

An alternate means of hyphenation control is to use "discretionary hyphens"
within  the  Professional  Page  text  editor.   While editing text, "soft"
hyphens  are inserted at preferred hyphenation point by typing "-" (hyphen)
while holding down the CTRL-key.

PAGE LAYOUT AND DESIGN
----------------------

When  you  think  a  page needs a little variety in typeface, do not choose
another  typeface but instead vary the standard typeface with bold, italic,
underline,  outline,  or  a  combination.   Unless  you want to emphasize a
phrase  or  passage,  body  copy should not be set in bold or italic style.
Setting  text  in  all capital letters will emphasize a passage, but at the
expense of reading speed.

Limiting the Number of Typefaces
--------------------------------

A  common  mistake is using too many typefaces in a document.  One typeface
for  the  body  copy  may  even be sufficient, though this runs the risk of
being  boring.   A  document should have no more than two typefaces for the
body  copy  and  no  more  than  two  for the headlines.  Advertisements or
special messages are exceptions to this rule.  When the reader encounters a
new typeface, particularly a novelty typeface, it is similar to coming into
a  dark  room  after  being in the sun.  The reader's eyes need a moment to
adjust.

Similar Typefaces in a Document
-------------------------------

Do  not  mix  similar  typefaces.  For example, Palatino and Garamond would
give  a  very  unpleasant  look to your document if they were both used for
setting body text on the same page.

Typefaces in Professional Page
------------------------------

Professional  Page  comes  with  metric  tables  (font  width tables) for a
variety  of  typefaces  (see Appendix K:  Fonts).  If your laser printer or
typesetting  machine  has these fonts available, you can choose from all of
these fonts to design your document.

A Professional Page Type Specimen Book
--------------------------------------

Designers,  typographers,  and  printers  use  a  "specimen book" to choose
typefaces.  The specimen book shows a particular set of characters in every
typeface  available.   This set of characters might be a complete alphabet,
or just a characteristic sentence of your choice.  It is worthwhile to make
your  own specimen book with the typefaces available in your laser printer.
It should have exanaples in the typeface sizes you most often use.

Creating a Consistent Style
---------------------------

The  layout  of  the page should let the reader get the most information in
the  least  amount  of  time.  Even if your document is a one-time thing, a
consistent  style  helps  the  reader  find  infornlation.   A  consistent,
recognizable style is even more vital if your document appears on a regular
basis,  since that style is the basis of how people recognize and judge the
quality of your publication.

Many  things  should  be  consistent  in  a  professional publication.  The
typeface,  the  size of the margins, the way articles are composed, the way
authors  are given credit, and the size and weight of box borders should be
all carefully chosen and maintained.

If  a  document  is  published  regularly,  such as a monthly newsletter, a
consistent style makes your job easier.

The  templates  in  Professional  Page allow you to use the same basic page
layouts from issue to issue.

Functional Layout
-----------------

The  physical  layout  of  your  pages  influences  the  way information is
presented.   For  example,  newspapers  are  folded  into quarters.  on the
newsstand  or  in  a  street  corner  newspaper box, only one corner of the
entire sheet is visible.  A newspaper layout artist keeps this in mind when
designing a front page.

Consider the ways in which a newspaper's physical shape affects its graphic
layout.  The most familiar parts of a front page are the name plate and the
banner  headline.   The  name plate displays the name of the newspaper in a
particular typeface and style that does not vary from day to day.

Very  often  the  front page has an eye-catching picture in the upper-right
corner,  just above the fold.  On the left edge of the front page, there is
a  summary  of  articles  inside.  Each item on the front page is carefully
chosen and placed for the best effect on the prospective reader.

If  you are composing a newsletter, consider its physical layout and how it
affects your graphic layout.  Newsletters are often mailed to a reader.  If
the  newsletter  is  printed  on  standard 8 1/2 by 11 inch paper it may be
folded  for  mailing.   This  creates  two  faces that could be seen by the
reader, one where their address is printed, and another blank side.

To  make  a  newsletter stand out, an eye-catching graphic or a headline on
the outside face of the folded newsletter are excellent ideas.

Grids and Templates
-------------------

The  grid method is the most common way of organizing a page.  With a grid,
the page is divided into a pattem of rectangles that guide the placement of
all  elements on the page.  The grid lines are not printed on the page, but
only  serve  as placement guides.  All elements of the page layout (such as
pictures and columns of text) can be aligned with these grid lines.

To  lay out a grid on a page, use the Page/Create/From Default sub-item and
specify  a  number of columns (see the Technical Reference section for more
details).   Once  the  page has been defined, it can be saved as a template
using  the  Page/Make  Template item, and called up later.  Using grids and
templates helps you lay out pages quickly and consistently.

Organizing the Page
-------------------

Before  you  place anything on a page, ask yourself some questions.  First,
how  important is this element?  If it is important, then it should be in a
prominent  place  on the page, like the above-the-fold picture on the front
page of a newsletter.  What should this element line up with?  Finally, how
does the entire page look with the element in this position?

The  grid  makes  these  decisions  very  easy.   If your text boxes have a
default  width that is an even division of the page width, page composition
is  much  easier.  Each box should also have internal margins that maintain
the proper spacing between columns.

Design  elements  can cross grid lines.  Consider a page wAth two pictures.
The most important picture should be in a prominent place, illustrating the
article  directly below it.  A less important photograph for this story can
be  tucked  into  a  less  prominent part of the page.  The photographs are
cropped  to  the  edges of the internal margins.  The left edge of the page
has  the  ends  of two articles from previous pages.  (An article continued
from a previous page is called a "jump".)

It  is  possible  to mix grid sizes on a page, although this should be done
cautiously,  and  only if you wish to emphasize a division of the page into
separate  areas.   For  examlple, the top portion of a page could have five
grid  rectangles  across, while the lower page, perhaps featurig an article
by  a  different  author or on another subject, could have only three grids
across.

Paragraph and Column Layout
---------------------------

After  you  have  selected a layout style, you will spend most of your time
composing pages of the document.  There are a few tricks that can speed the
process.   One  common  device  is  a  dummy.  This is a small model of the
doculent.  For a newspaper or newsletter, the dummy can be made from sheets
of  typing  paper  folded  in half and nested together.  The grid lines are
marked  on  the  dummy  in  advance.   You can make these dummy sheets with
Professional Page by making boxes with frames.

Block  out  the elements of your layout that are are never moved, such as a
name plate or a masthead.  Then place the other articles on the dummy pages
by measuring or estimating their length.

Headlines
---------

Headlines are commonly set in bold or bold italic.  A common practice is to
have  the  headlines  in  a  sans  serif  typeface, and the text in a serif
typeface.   Headlines are most easily read when composed in mixed upper and
lowercase,  just  like  body  copy.  The largest headlines should be placed
high on the page because they draw the eye to them.

Never  "butt"  (position)  two  headlines  horizontally.   This is called a
"tombstone."  The  reader  may  read  both  headlines  as  one.   If butted
headllnes  are  unavoidable, be sure to use diffeent typefaces to make them
distinct.

Gray and White Space
--------------------

White  and  gray  space are aesthetic terms for the overall appearance of a
layout  element.  Body copy is gray space.  Viewed from a distance, columns
of text look gray.  Margins are white space.

A  good  layout artist seeks a balance between white and gray space because
readers  ignore  large areas of gray space.  Pictures and graphics are good
for breaking up large gray spaces.

Another  easy  wvay  to  break  up  gray  columns of text is the quote box.
Choose  a  particularly  interesting quotation from the text.  Make a small
box  to break up a long column of text, and give it a simple border.  Place
the  quote  in  the box in a type size between body copy and headline size.
The  reader's eye is drawn to the quote, and it may induce them to read the
story.

Fit to Print
------------

Fitting  an  article  to  available  space  is a valuable skill.  There are
several  ways  to  stretch or shrink the length of an article.  The crudest
way  is  removing sentences or paragraphs from the article.  Two other ways
were mentioned above, the addition of pictures and the quote box.  can also
adjust spacings within the text itself.

Spacing
-------

Spacing within text can be adjusted both horizontally and vertically to fit
the  text  into  a  specific  area.   Horizontal  spacing acts on the space
between characters and words.  Vertical spacing acts on the spacing between
lines.

Horizontal Spacing:
-------------------

Horizontal spacing within text can be adjusted by setting or re-setting any
of the following type options:

*  Hyphenation.   If  ON,  hyphenation  shrinks  the  size  of  a column by
increasing the number of characters which fit on each line, thus decreasing
the  number  of lines (of depth) in each column.  Hyphenation should always
be ON in flush justified copy.

*  Inter-word  spacing.   The  default  inter-word  spacing is preset to be
proportionally  correct for each typeface.  Using other units of inter-word
spacing  (for example EM, EN, or Thin spaces) between words will adjust the
number  of  words  which  fit  on  each  line.   (See  Glossary section for
definitions).

*  Tracking.   Another form of horizontal spacing control which adjusts the
constant  space  between  all  characters  in  a line or block (the default
setting  is zero).  If you "track in", space is reduced between characters,
while  "tracking  out" adds space between all characters on a line (or in a
highlighted block).  Tracking is adjustable in units of 1/100 of an EM.

*  Kerning.  A vanation of tracking that operates on specific letter pairs.
Kerning  can  be  set  to  ON  within an entire text block to automatically
adjust  all  pairs  set  within  the  program, or can be controlled between
individual letter pairs.

Vertical spacing:
-----------------

Vertical  spacing within a text block can be controlled by adjusting any of
the following:

*  line  spacing  (or  leading)  to  change the anaount of vertical spacing
between  each  line  of  text.  It is recommended that line spacing for all
columns of text of the same point size and typeface sbould be consistent on
any one page.

* paragraph spacing.  To fill (or reduce) the amount of text within any one
column, adjust the amount of inter-paragraph spacing.

* fixed spacing.  The most aesthetically pleasing way to adjust the overall
depth  of text within a column is to adjust the anount of spacing above and
below headings or sub-headings within the column.

After  the  article  is  fitted  into the space allotted, look for what are
called  "rivers of white".  These can be eliminated by adjusting either the
inter-character  and  inter-word spacing, or by manually hyphenating a word
at the end of the line using the discretionary hyphen.

Borders
-------

Boxes  and box frames highlight text.  They should not dominate the page or
overshadow  the  text  inside.   The  border of a box should be achieved by
adjusting  the inner margins of the text boxes if required.  Your choice of
box should become part of the consistent layout style you use.

Summary
-------

The  layout  of  your  documnent  affects  whether your message effectively
reaches  the  reader.  By improving your layout, you improve the quality of
your  document as a form of communication.  The simpler and more consistent
your layout style, and the clearer the emphasis on the main ideas contained
in the text, the better your documents will be.


6. TECHNICAL REFERENCE...
------------------------

This  section  provides  a  detailed  explanation  of  all elenaents of the
Professional  Page program.  Each menu selection and gadget is exhaustively
examined,  with  explanations of what it does, how it can be accessed, what
it  looks  like  on  the screen, and how it works.  You should re@er to the
Technical Reference section when you have a question about where to find an
item, or what some part of the program does.

The Professional Page Screen
----------------------------

The  Professional  Page  screen  is  the  Amiga  equivalent of a designer's
drawing  table.   The strip along the top displays the menus which give you
access to various parts of the program.  The strip down the right hand side
has a variety of tools to assist you in laying out pages.

This  reference  begins at the top left corner of the screen, and works its
way  across  the top and down the right hand side to the bottom, explaining
each feature along the way.

For  many  menu  selections,  there  are  keyboard  equivalents.  These are
summarized  in  the  Appendix B:  Keyboard Equivalents as well as the Quick
Reference Guide.

COMMON ELEMENTS
---------------

Let's  look  at some common elements before getting to the main body of the
Technical   Reference   section:    using  requesters  and  using  extended
selection.

Using Requesters
----------------

Requesters   are   used   whenever  additional  information  is  needed  by
Professional   Page.    Requesters   prompt  for  required  information  or
acknowledgement  of an action.  There are several types of input components
that  requesters use, including:  listings, booleans, strings, buttons, and
slider requesters.

Listings:   Listings  are  displayed  in  a small window.  They may contain
directories  and file names, color names, or font names.  If there are more
entries  than can fit into the window, the scroll bars (to the right of the
window)  can  be  used  to  diaplay different sections of the list.  Scroll
arrows  (above and below the scroll bar) can also be used for this purpose.
To  select an entry in the window, click on the entry.  In most requesters,
it  is  possible to select an entry and acknowledge the requester by double
clicking on the entry.

Boolean:   Booleans  are  "ON/OFF" type requesters.  "ON" (a filled circle)
shows  that  a particular feature is active.  "OFF" (an empty circle) shows
that a particular feature is inactive.  Generally speaking, clicking in the
circle will change a "ON" to a "OFF" state and vice-versa.

Strings:   String  requesters  expect information to be typed in.  To enter
information,  click  the text line associated with the string requester and
use the normal Amiga editing features to enter the information.  Text input
should be terminated by pressing the RETURN key.

Buttons:   Button requesters are used for selecting a further requester and
for  acknowledging  the current one.  They are rectangular in shape and are
activated by clicking on them.

Sliders:  Sliders are used to input values on a scale.  For example, in the
color  definition  requester, there is a scale for the percentage of red to
use  on  the  screen.   Adjusting  the slider will adjust the amount of red
used.

File Requester
--------------

In  Professional  Page,  all  access  to  disk files is done through a file
requester.  The file requester has the following components:

*  Listing:   All  directories  and files are listed in the listing window.
Clicking  a  directory  or file will place the name into the Drawer or File
string  text  line.   Double  clicking  on  a file will select the file and
acknowledge  the  requester.  Chicking on a directory will open that drawer
on  disk.   To  close  a  drawer,  jugt  click  on "/<PARENT>" entry in the
listing.

*  String  Components:   Drawer and File names can be entered directly into
the appropnate text lines.

*  Buttons:   Drive  selection and acknow;ledgement buttons are also in the
file requester.

Moving Requesters
-----------------

If the requester obstructs your view of a part of the page, simply grab the
requester  box by the moving gadget (the horizontal lines at the top of the
requester).

Extended Select
---------------

This  technique  greatly  speeds  up the process of making a series of menu
selections  using the mouse.  This offers the ability to make several mouse
selections with one pass of the mouse across several menus.

* Pull down a menu, and, keeping the right mouse button pressed, click with
the  left  mouse button on several items and sub-items as you work your way
down the menu.

*  When  you  release the right button, the various items and sub-items you
selected will be enacted in the order in which you selected them.

*  For  example,  if  you  have  selected  the  Text  tool, and then select
Type/Typeface/New,  Type/Size/New,  and  Type/Style/Bold  all  in one pass,
those  items with requesters will automatically present their requesters in
sequence,  while  the  items  which  toggle on/off will have changed to the
setting you desire.

PROJECT MENU
------------

The Project menu is the most general menu, consisting of nine items.

New
---

Creates an environment for a new document.

*  Clears  the  existing  document  from  memory.   There can only have one
document open at a time (though that document can have many pages).

* New is automatically executed upon startup.

* The name of document is changed to "Untitled".

* Any material which is located on the art board is not deleted.

Open
----

Opens an existing Professional Page document, reading it from a floppy disk
or a hard disk.

*  Open  deleted  the  document  in memory.  A warning requester appears to
confirm that the current document should be deleted.

*  Opens  the file requester to allow you to enter the name of the document
to be loaded.

*  Any materials located on the art board will be deleted.  This is because
you  are  loading an entire document, including a saved art board which may
have materials already on it.

Save
----

Saves  the  version  of the document that you've been working on, using the
current  document name as the filename.  If no name has been specified, the
document will be given the file name "Untitiled".

*  Select Save frequently while working on a document, to ensure not losing
data because of a power failure or a system crash.

* The art board is saved as part of the document.

*  See  Project/Information  and  Project/Save  As  to  change  the current
document name.

Save As
-------

Saves the current document under a new name.

* The file requester is used to select a new filename for the document.

* The art board is saved as part of the document.

* The new filename becomes the current document name.

Information
-----------

Displays information related to the current document.

*  The  "Document Information" requester includes user-definable text lines
for  the  document  name  (file name), author's name, comment, and revision
number.

*  Type  in  any  changes  necessary.  Changes made with this requester are
saved with the document.

* Two dates/times are saved with each document:  the date/time it was first
created and the date/time it was last saved.

*  The  List  Bitmap  Files gadget calls up another requester which shows a
list  of  the bitmap graphic files used in the document.  Professional Page
may  prompt  you  to  make these files available when you load or print the
document.

Import
------

Import  is  used to import box components (such as text, bitmap graphics or
structured drawings) into the document.

Import/Text
-----------

Imports text generated by various word processors and text editors.

*  Imported  text  sits  in  the  text paste buffer until the Paste item is
issued from the text editor.

* The file requester will ask you which file to import.

*  The  requester's title tells you which type of file the program expects.
(See  "Preferences/Text  Format"  later in this section regarding importing
specific files saved by word processor programs).

*  Text files can have native and imbedded formatting codes.  See the Using
Professional  Page  secting  and  Appendix  F:   Formatting  Text  for more
details.

Import/Bitmap Graphic
---------------------

Imports  a  bitmap picture.  A "bitmap" is a computer picture composed of a
pattern  of  pixels of colors or gray tones.  The Amiga has a standard file
format,  called IFF, for all bitmap pictures created by paint programs such
as  Deluxe  Paint II or video digitizers such as Digi-View.  The resolution
of  a  bitmap  picture is determined when it is created:  Professional Page
cannot change it.

*  An  Import  IFF Bitmap?  file requester prompts you for the desired file
name.

*  Imported  bitmaps  are  placed directly into the active box, so you must
have an empty, active box before you can import a bitmap graphic.

*  Any IFF including HAM mode graphics can be loaded into Professional Page
with any number of colors from two to 4096.

*  All  resolution  modes are supported.  A bitmap picture on the Amiga can
range in size from a single pixel to as many as 1024 by 1024 pixels.  Since
any  picture can have a different color map and Professional Page uses only
16 colors on the screen, the colors from the imported graphics are rendered
in  8 gray scales when displayed.  The original color information, however,
is  retained  in the graphic's original data file and will be used when you
print or color separate the page.

*  Since  color  must  be  converted  into gray levels for display, a large
bitmap picture takes time to load:  so be patient.

*  Depending on how much memory you have on your Amiga, you may face limits
on the number of graphics you can have in a document.

*  In  order  to load the document or to print the page in black and white,
you  must  have all the original picture disk files available.  You will be
prompted for the appropriate disk when needed.

*  It  may  be desirable to place all the images for a document in the same
directory  of a disk so that they can be found again easily when it is time
to print the document (with fewer disk swaps).

* Proof printing does not require the bitmap disks.  (See "Project/Print".)

*  For  information on sizing, cropping, and moving bitmap graphics see the
Using Professional Page section.

Import/Structured Drawing
-------------------------

Imports a structured drawing.  A "structured drawing" differs from a bitmap
in  that  instead  of  being composed of a mosaic of dots, it is made up of
"vectors"--mathematical descriptions of line direction, width and so on.  A
structured  drawing  can be printed out on a laser printer or a typesetting
machine  at  the  printer's maximum resolution.  This means that structured
drawings can be very smooth without the "jaggies" of a bitmap image.

* The Import Drawing?  requester prompts you for the file name.

*  Similar  to  the bitmap graphic, a structured drawing is placed directly
into the empty active box.

*  All  of  the  graphic  elements,  line  weights, fill shadings, and fill
patterns, from Aegis Draw Plus are supported.  The drawing is automatically
sized  so  that  it  is entirely visible, and occupies the largest possible
area of the active box, while maintaining the aspect ratio of the drawing.

Print
-----

Print  is used to get hard copy output from a PostScript device.  The Pring
item  has  three  sub-items  which give you a choice as to what you want to
send  to  the  laser  printer or typesetting machine.  These sub-items are:
Current  Page,  Entire  Document,  and Thumb Nail.  (See Using Professional
Page for more information on printing.)

Print/Current Page, Entire Document, Thumb Nail
-----------------------------------------------

Generates hard copy output.  A requester will prompt for:

* the number of copies you wish to print.

*  the  printer  port or disk file you wish to send the output to (click on
the ser:, par:, or disk gadget).

* Manual or Automatic paper Feed.

*  Proof  mode.   This  is  used  if  you  wish  to print only the text and
structured drawings without the delay of printing bitmap graphics.

*  Override  Custom  Spece.   This  is  used to override the special output
settings specified in the Page requester.

*  The  Print  Entire  Document requester also asks for a range of pages to
print.

*  The  Print  Thumb Nail requester asks for a range of pages to print, and
whether there shoudl be 2x2, 3x3, or 4x4 thumb nails per output sheet.

About
-----

Brings up an information window displaying copyright messages and credits.

Quit
----

Exits  from  Professional  Page.   A requester asks for confirmation of the
action.

PAGE MENU
---------

The Page menu allows operations on individual pages or template.  Pages and
templates  may  be  created  or  deleted,  saved or retrieved from disk, or
modified.

Template Pages
--------------

Template  pages  are  individual  pages  that  are used as a prototype when
creating other pages.  The newly created page will have the same dimensions
and  contain  the  same  boxes  and contents as the template page.  You can
specify  separate  even  and  odd  template pages, to allow for the way the
final  document will be printed and read.  The newly created page takes the
attributes  from  the  appropriate template.  note that all boxes on a page
creted from a template are locked, but can be unlocked if desired.

Pages may be inserted at specified location in the document.  If necessary,
pages are shifted upwards, to accommodate for the newly created pages.

Create
------

Creates  a  new  page,  either from an existing template, or from a default
page that can be tailored to the requirements of the job being done.

Create/From Template
--------------------

Creates  a  number  of  pages to be inserted into the document.  Pages will
take  on  the  attributes and contents of the appropriate template page.  A
requester  will  prompt for the page range and for the desired action.  The
options are:

*  Use Page Numbers:  Pages will be created using the Odd or Even template,
depending on whether the page number is odd or even.

* Use Odd:  Pages will be created using only the Odd template.

* Use Even:  Pages will be created using only the Even template.

Create/From Default
-------------------

Adds  a  range  of  pages to a specified location in the document, from the
default attributes.

*  Brings up the New Page requester so tha you can change the attributes of
the new page.

Load
----

Loads  a  saved  page  into  the even or odd template, or directly into the
document  as  the  current  page.   The Load item has three sub-items:  New
Current, Even Template and Odd Template.

*  Loading  a page file into a template replaces the existing template with
the page just lo9aded.

*  Loading  a  page  file  into  current  adds  that page to the end of the
document.

Save
----

Saves a particular page separately from the rest of the document.  The Save
item has three sub-items:  Current, Even Template and Odd Template.

NOTE:   A  page file only holds one page at a time; it does not contain any
information on the page number or the art board.  it is a good idea to give
your  page  files  a  suffix  like ".page", ".even" or ".odd" so that it is
easier  to  find  them  in  the  future, and not confuse them with document
files.   Finally,  the  page  and  document files have completely different
formats - pages cannot be loaded as documents and vice-versa.

Delete
------

Removes the current page from the document.

*  If  there  are  boxes on the page, you will be asked whether you want to
continue or abort the deletion.

*  If  any  of  the  deleted boxes contain text which is linked to boxes on
other  pages,  the text is not deleted, but flows into the next linked box.
If  all  of  the linked boxes are on the deleted page, however, the text is
deleted along with the page.

* Pages are resequenced after the current page is deleted.

Alter
-----

Alters the parameters of the current or default page.

Alter/Current
-------------

Alters  the  page  parameters of the current page.  You can change the page
size,  page  number,  number  of  columns,  the width of the gutter between
columns,  and  margins  of the page.  When you change the attributes of the
current  page,  only  one  page  is affected so you can have different page
formats in a document.

*  The  requester consists of five page format options which determine page
dimensions  (four  predefined,  and  one  user-definable):   a  Page Number
gadget,  four  margin  text  lines,  a column numbering text line, a gutter
width text line, and a PostScript Output Specs gadget.

* To move a page within the document, change the Page Number gadget.  Pages
are resequenced after the move.

*  The  Output  Page Specifications requester appears when you click on the
PostScript  Output Specs gadget.  It allows you to set the position, scale,
rotation  and  orientation  of the current page output.  Type the numerical
values  for  Position,  Scale and Rotation into the appropriate text lines,
pressing  RETURN  after  each  entry.  The outline of your modified printed
page  will be superimposed over the white rectangle of the printer's output
dimensions.

Alter/Default, Even Template, Odd Template
------------------------------------------

Changes  the  parameters  of  the default, even or odd template page (which
will be used to create new pages).

*  A  page  format requester pops up, almost identical to the Alter/Current
Page  Format requester in appearance and operation.  The only difference is
that it lacks a page number gadget.

Make Template/Even, Odd
-----------------------

Template  pages  are useful if many pages share common design elements such
as  headers,  footers,  and page numbers.  Once you have created a template
page,  new  pages can be created with all of the template's design elements
already  on  them.   There can be two template pages in a document, one for
odd-numbered pages and one for even-numbered pages.

*  The  Make  Template item replaces either the odd or even of the template
pages  with  a  copy  of the current page.  All of the boxes on the current
page  are  copied to the template page(s).  The links between text boxes on
the  current  page  are  kept  in  the  template, but any links between the
current page and other pages are broken.

Visible
-------

Hides the current page from view temporarily.

BOX MENU
--------

Allows operations on individual Boxes in the document

Show Active
-----------

The outline of the active box flashes so that it can be quickly identified.
The view is repositioned so that the active box is visible.

Clone Active
------------

Makes  a  duplicate  of  the  active  box.   All  of the box's contents and
attributes  are  copied  except  the position.  The cloned box overlaps the
original,  slightly lower and to the right.  If the active box is linked to
other text boxes, the cloned box will have the same visible box contents as
the active box, but will not be linked to anything.

Delete Active
-------------

Deletes  the  active box.  Where this box is part of a chain of linked text
boxes,  the box will disappear, but its contents will be distributed to the
following  boxes.   If  the box is not empty and is not lined in a chain, a
requester appears to confirm the deletion.

Alter/Active, Default
---------------------

Changes  the  attributes of the active box.  The various attributes are set
in a requester.

*  An  Active  Box  requester  appears,  consisting of a row of icons, four
Margins text lines, four Position text lines, and the Set Tabs gadget.

*  There  are  five  gadget  icons  at the top of the requester.  They are:
Lock-Unlock,   Transparent-Opaque,   Permeable-Impermeable,  Quick  Display
on-off, and Frame on-off.

*  Lock-Unlock:  A Locked box cannot be moved, resized, or deleted.  Locked
boxes  are easy to identify because they don't have sizing handles on their
outlines.   When  the lock "opens", the box is unlocked.  When it "closes",
the box is locked.

NOTE:   All boxes from a template page are locked automatically, but when a
page  is created from a template, you may then unlock the boxes you want to
edit.

*  Transparent-Opaque:   Makes  a  box  transparent  or  opaque.   This  is
especially  useful  if  you  have one box on top of another (for example, a
line  of  text  on  top  of a scanned photo).  Clicking on the icon toggles
between   transparent  and  opaque.   The  active  box  is  opaque  if  the
solid-outline icon obscures part of the dashed-outline icon behind it.

*  Permeable/Impermeable:   If a permeable box is placed in front of a text
box,  the  text will intrude into the box, and may be obscured depending on
whether  the  front box is transparent or opaque.  If the front box is made
impermeable, the text flows around the front box, making a "runaround".  If
the  impermeable  box  is  behind  the  text  box,  there  is no runaround.
Clicking  on the icon toggles between the two settings.  If type is visible
through  the  small  square,  the  active  box is permeable.  If not, it is
impermeable.   Changing the permeability of a box causes runarounds in text
boxes behind that box, but has no effect on text in the box itself.

NOTE:   You  may  want  to  set  a  margin  around  the  image  area of the
impermeable  box,  to  give  it  some "breathing room" from the surrounding
boxes.

*  Quick  Display:  If Quick Display is on, the contents of the box are not
displayed.   This  greatly  speeds up normal operations (i.e.  you can move
the  box around without having to wait so long for the page to be redrawn.)
The  box is displayed, although its contents are not visible on the screen.
Graphic  boxes  are  depicted  with  an  X and text boxes are filled with a
pattern.

*  Frame:   Causes  the  frame  to  be  turned  on.  The frame takes on the
attributes currently set in the Draw menu (see "Structured Drawings" in the
Using Professional Page section).

NOTE:   Box  frames  cannot  be  attached  to  boxes  containing structured
drawings.

*  Margins:   Selects  a  margin  around  the image area of a box.  You can
specify  the  top,  bottom, left, and right margins separately.  No text or
graphics  appear  outside  these  margins in a box.  To change the margins,
type the desired margin widths into the appropriate margin text lines.

*  Position:   Specifies the position and size of a box precisely.  You can
enter  the position of the top left hand corner and the height and width of
the  box.   When the requester first comes up, these text lines contain the
position  and  size  of the active box.  These parameters cannot be set for
the default box and are not shown in the Alter Default requester.

* Graphic Scale:  Scales bitmap graphics or structured drawings in both the
X  and  Y directions.  This technique is useful to resize images to fit the
layout.   Enter  the  desired X and Y sacling values into the Graphic Scale
string gadgets.

NOTE:   The Graphic Scale parameters only appear if the active box contains
a graphic or a drawing.  You cannot scale text with this option.

*  Set  Tabs:  Defines up to fifteen different tabs, plus paragraph indent.
This  makes  it  simple for you to import text and insert it at the correct
tab  location  relative  to  the left edge of the box.  Select the Set Tabs
gadget in the requester and a Set Tabs requester appears.

NOTE:  The Set Tabs gadget and requester will only appear if the active box
is a text box or is empty.

GROUP MENU
----------

A group is a collection of boxes on either a page or the art board.  Once a
collection  of  boxes  has  been grouped, it can be treated as a unit.  The
group  can  be  moved  as a single unit (all boxes keeping the same spatial
relationship),  cloned  (copied), deleted, or aligned.  If a group is moved
such that there are boxes on and off the page, the boxes completely off the
page  will drop to the art board and the boxes on the page will remain as a
group.   If  the  entire group is moved to or from the art board, the group
remains intact.  Only one group can exist at any given time.

To create a group, select the Make Group tool (discussed later in "The Tool
Palette") and drag a outline around all the boxes to be grouped.  Note that
after  the  group has been created, the cursor reverts automatically to the
Null  Pointer.   All  of  the  non-active boxes in the group now have solid
black outlines.

To  add  a  box to the group, click in the box while holding down the SHIFT
key.   To remove a box from a group click in the box while holding down the
CTRL key.

To move a group, hold down the SHIFT key while dragging one of the boxes in
the  group.  To move an individual box within the group, select the box and
drag it, in the normal fashion.  The box will remain in the group.

Clone
-----

Creates  a  new group of boxes identical to the original in both attributes
and  content.  The new group appears slightly beside and below the original
group.   The original group is "forgotten", and the newly cloned boxes form
the  new  group.   If any of the boxes in the original group were linked to
other  text  boxes,  those  links do not exist in the clones group, and the
contents  are  limited  to  what  ws in its member boxes at the time it was
cloned.

Delete
------

Deletes  all of the boxes in the current group.  If some boxes in the group
are  not  empty, a request is made to confirm the delete.  If some boxes in
the  group  are  linked  to others, the text is not deleted, but remains as
part  of the linked series.  If, however, text is not linked to outside the
group, it is deleted.  Graphics and drawings will always be deleted.

Forget
------

Undoes   or  "forgets"  the  current  group,  without  changing  any  other
attributes of the boxes in the group.

Align
-----

Aligns  all  boxes in the group with the top, botom, left, or right side of
the  active  box.   This  gives  you  a very quick way of reorganizing your
group.

*  Make  active  the box (by clicking on it) that you wish the others to be
aligned with.

*  Select any one of the four available Group/Align sub-items (Top, Bottom,
Left, and Right).

Center
------

Centers  all  boxes  in the group either vertically, horizontally, or both,
with the center of the active box.

*  Make  active  the box (by clicking on it) that you wish the others to be
centered with.

* Select any of the three available Group/Center sub-items.

Merge
-----

Merges  all  structured  drawing  components  within  the  group  into  one
structured  drawing  box.   This  is  very useful for combining a series of
structured  drawing segments or parts into a unified illustration.  It also
stabilizes   your   structured   elements  into  one  unit  that  can't  be
accidentally   disrupted.    (See   "Structured   Drawings"  in  the  Using
Professional Page section).

* Ensure all desired structured drawing elements are in the group.

* Select Group/Merge.

*  The  new structured drawing can be manipulated in the same manner as any
other structured drawing.

NOTE:   Once  a  group of structured drawings has been merged, it cannot be
undone.   If you're not sure whether a particular box should be included in
the  merge, leave it out.  You can always use Merge again later to add more
boxes.

TYPE MENU
---------

The  Type  menu  contains most of the typographic controls for the program.
Professional  Page  has  two methods of assigning typesetting parameters to
text.   First,  when  you  create text with a word processor, you can embed
special  codes  in  it, which Professional Page interprets when the text is
imported.   (For  an  explanation of this, refer to Appendix F:  Formatting
Text.)  The second method is through the use of the formatting tools in the
Type  menu.   All  text creation and editing can be done in the active box.
To  enter  the text edit mode, select the Text tool.  The items in the Type
menu operate in conjunction with marked text blocks.  If a block of text is
marked,  selections  made  from the Type menu will affect the entire block.
If  no  block  is selected, any changes in the Type menu take effect at the
next  typed  character.   Attributes shown in the Type menu are that of the
character preceding the cursor if there is no marked block, and that of the
first  character  in  the  block  if a block exists.  The method of marking
blocks of text is described in Edit Menu.

Typeface
--------

Selects  the  current  typeface.   In  the  Typeface item, a list of active
typefaces  is  shown  (by default, only Times will be active when you start
up).

Typeface/New
------------

If the desired typeface is not shown, choose a new one by selecting the New
sub-item.  This will bring up a requester listing all the available fonts.

*  All the typefaces for which you have Metric Files (font width tables) on
your  fonts:   directory  (usually on the fonts and Utilities disk) will be
listed in the requester.

* Select the typeface you want by double clicking its name.

NOTE:   Professional Page comes with nineteen metric tables loaded.  if you
wish  to use other typefaces, it is simply a matter of loading other metric
tables onto your Fonts and Utilities disk.  This program demands to see all
the fonts for a given document on a single disk.  If you do not have a hard
disk, and still wish to use many fonts, you may find it useful to make up a
set  of  metric file disks with different combinations of fonts on each.  A
maximum of 127 typefaces can be used within a single document.

Size
----  

Selects  the current size of the typeface choses (a point size of 12 points
is  selected  by  default  when  you start up).  In the Size item a list of
active  sizes is shown.  If the desired size is not shown, a new one can be
chosen by selecting the New sub-item.

* A Point Size requester appears.

*  Delete  the  current point size listed in the requester, and type in the
new one.

NOTE:   point  sizes  up  to  127  points  in  increments of 1 point may be
specified.

Style
-----

Allows  you  to  select  text  styles:   Plain, Bold, Italics, Outline, and
Underline.  To undo all of the selected styles, select Plain.

Kerning
-------

Turns  kerning  off and on.  Selecting Type/Kerning toggles kerning off and
on.  A check mark next to Kerning shows that it is on.

Tracking
--------

Sets the tracking.

*  Select  Type/Tracking  and  the Tracking requester appears.  Type in the
numeric value for tracking desired.

* You can also track a selected block by using the left ad right arrow keys
(which shifts in 2/100 of an Em space for each keystroke).

Line Spacing
------------

Sets spacing between lines of type.

* Select Type/Line Spacing and a Line Spacing requester appears.

*  Click  on  the Fixed, Relative, or Leading gadgets.  Type numeric values
into the text lines.

*  Fixed  spacing  is  spacing between lines, independent of the text point
size.

*  Relative  spacing is specified as a percentage of the largest point size
on the line.

*  Leading is the amount of extra space to add to the largest point size on
the  line.   It  is  expressed  in points, and can be negative or positive.
Only one of these can be in effect at a time.

*  Paragraph  spacing  is specified as a percentage of the line spacing you
have  chosen.   It  is  always  operative,  regardless  of whether you have
selected Fixed, Relative, or Leading.

*  The linespacing attributes of the last character of the line is used for
the entire line.

Baseline
--------

Moves the baseline of a block of text up or doen.

* Select Type/Baseline and a Baseline Shift requester appears.

*  Enter  the desired baseline shift into the string gadget.  Both positive
and negative values are acceptable.

*  Baseline  shifts  can  also  be changed (in increments of 0.5 points) by
using the up and down arrow keys for a selected block.

Hyphenation
-----------

Turns hyphenation on and off.  Prefix and Suffic parameters for hyphenation
are  specified  through  the  Preferences menu (se "Preferences/Hyphenation
Contol"  later  in  this section).  If there is a check mark to the left of
the Hyphenation sub-item, then hyphenation is on.  See Design section.

Justification
-------------

Selects the justification of the text:  Left, Right, Center, or Flush.  The
justification  of  the  first  character on the line is used for the entire
line.

Paragraph Indent/In, None, Hanging
----------------------------------

Selects  how paragraphs are to be handled.  A RETURN n the text indicates a
paragraph break.  Paragraphs indents can be:

* None:  The start of the paragraph lies flush with body of the text.

*  In:  The start of the paragraph is indented in from the rest of the body
of the text.

*  Hanging:  The start of the paragraph is indented in from the rest of the
body of the text.

NOTE:   the amount of indents is determined by the paragraph spacing in the
Set Tabs requester selected from the Box/Alter/Current sub-item.

EDIT MENU
---------

This  menu  is  used  to  access the text editing functions of Professional
Page.   Editing  text  is described in the Using Professional Page section.
The items of the Edit menu are used to enter and edit text in the manner of
a  word  processor, and also work hand in hand with the typographical tools
found in the Type menu.

Cut
---

Cuts  out  the marked block of text.  The cut block will be kept in a paste
buffer to await pasting.

Copy
----

Copies the marked block of text to the paste buffer.  This differs from the
Cut item in that the Cut removes the block from the current box, while Copy
leaves it there.

Paste
-----

The contents of the past buffer are placed at the current cursor position.

Unmarked Block
--------------

The current block is unmarked.

Save Block
----------

Saves the marked block as an ASCII text file.  A file requester will prompt
for the file name.  All typographic information is translated into imbedded
ASCII codes.

Select Box
----------

Blocks  all  visible  contents  of the current text box where the cursor is
located.

Select All
----------

The  entire article is selected as a block.  If the box containing the text
cursor  is  linked  to  other boxes, all of the text in these boxes will be
blocked.

Find
----

Searches  through  the  entire article associated with the active box for a
text  string.  If there are any embedded ASCII formatting commands (such as
style or font size changes) in the search string the search will match only
those strings with the specific attributes.  If there are no embedded ASCII
formatting commands, the search will match text with any attributes.

*  Select  Edit/Find and a Find requester appears which has a string gadget
for  specifying  what to search for, a directional gadget (an arrow), and a
button which allows you to ignore letter case in the search.

*  Click  on  the  arrow  to  choose  the  direction  of  the  search,  and
Professional Page will search through the article in the desired direction.
If a match is found, it will be blocked.

Replace
-------

Searches  through  the entire article and replaces one string with another.
This  may  be  done  once,  or  for all occurrences of the Find string with
optional confirmation before each substitution.

*  A  Find/Replace  requester,  similar to the Find requester, appears.  It
contains  the  same  gadgets described under Find.  In addition, there is a
Replace  with string gadget.  If an occurrence of the Find string is found.
it will be replaced by the contents of this string.  If Global is on, every
occurrence  of  the  Find  string  from  the  text cursor to the end of the
article  (in  the  specified  direction)  will  be  replaced.   If Query is
selected,  you  will be asked, at each occurrence of the string, whether to
replace  it  or  not.   As with the Find item, you may wish to use embedded
ASCII formatting commands.

Find Next
---------

Finds  the  next  occurrence  (in the current search direction) of the Find
string.

Replace Next
------------

Finds  the  next  occurrence  of  the  Find string and replaces it with the
Replace  string.   If Query is selected, you will be asked for verification
before the replacement is done.

DRAW MENU
---------

Drawing  parameters  apply  to  both  structured  drawings  and box frames.
Select  the Box Create tool or nay of the structured drawing tools, and any
changes  to the drawing parameters take effect upon the cretion of the next
structured drawing or the frame of the next box created.

If you are not in the box create of structured drawing mode, changes to the
drawing  parameters affect the active box.  The attributes in the Draw menu
are those of the active box.

Line Weight
-----------

Lists the line weights for the drawing tools or box frames.  You can choose
None  (zero  width),  1/2  point, 1 point, 2 points, 3 points, 4 points, or
Hairline (which prints out at the minimum width your printer is capable of,
but is shown on the screen with a single pixel width).  You can also choose
a Custom line width sub-item.

* Select Draw/Line Weight/Custom.

* A Line Width requester appears.

* Type in the desired line width in points (to the nearest 1/2 point).

Line Patterns
-------------

Allows  yu to select various line patterns for use by the drawing tools and
the box frames.

Fill Patterns
-------------

Lists fill patterns, including None if no fill is desired.

COLOR MENU
----------

Professional  Page  keeps  track  of  and  handles colors to be used by the
Professional  Color  separator.   Colors  can  be  selected  for structured
drawings,  frames,  and  text.   Color information is maintained for bitmap
graphics, but not displayed.  A database of colors may be defined and saved
for later use.  A color is specified by a name, now it should appear on the
screen,  and  how it is to be printed (eg.  separated or mechanical colors)
by the Professional Color Separator.

Ink Color
---------

Selects  the  ink  color  from  the  list  of  available colors or from the
submenu.   The ink color is used in text, structured graphic lines, and box
frames.

* Selecting Color/From List produces a requester asking for a color name.

Fill Color
----------

Allows you to select a fill color from the list of available colors or from
the  submenu.  The Fill colors are used to fill structured drawings and box
frames.

Define
------

Defines a new color for use with text or structured drawings.

*  Select Color/Define to bring up a list of available colors and a plaette
to  change  an  existing  color  or define a new one, which is added to the
available  colors  list.   The new colors will not be added to the submenus
until  it  is  used  by  choosing  Color/Ink  Color/From List or Color/Fill
color/From List.

Load
----

Loads  from  disk  a set of previously defined colors.  In this way you can
set  up  a database of useful colors which can be loaded into a document at
will.

Save
----

Saves to disk the set of colors currently defined in this documnt.

NOTE:  You can use up to 127 colors in a document.  although only 16 colors
are  displayed  on  the screen (9 of which is used by bitmap graphics), all
colors will print correctly using the Professional Color separator.

PREFERENCES MENU
----------------

This  menu  lets  you  set  a  number  of  the environment parameters for a
document.   Many  of  these  affect  the appearance of the screen, or other
aspects of Professional Page's operation.  These settings, however, have no
effect  on the appearance of the document when printed.  These settings are
saved with the document.

Magnification
-------------

The  regular  Amiga  high  resolution  screen display (typically 640 by 400
pixels)  is quite detailed for an off-the-shelf personal computer.  Despite
this,  it  is  impossible  to show an entire typeset page on screen in full
detail.   To  allow  you  to view individual letters, as well as to see the
whole   page,   there   is  a  zoom  option.   There  are  five  levels  of
magnification:   25%,  33%,  50%, 100%, and 200%.  These magnifications are
presented  as sub-items.  A check mark identifies the current magnification
level.

Layout Tools
------------

Brings  up  a  requester with several features that help you lay out a page
precisely.   The Layout Tools are divided into several sections, including:
Units, Grid, Ruler, and Outlines.

Unit
----

Defines the unit of measure in your document.  You have a choice of inches,
centimeters, or picas to use as your measurement units.  The one you choose
is used throughout Professional Page whenever you are asked for a size or a
position.

Grid
----

Rules the page into a precise grid, to position elements accurately.  Grids
can  be  turned  on or off.  They can be user specified in both the x and y
directions, or selected from any one of four predefined grids.

Snap to Grid
------------

If  this  is selected all positioning and sizing will snap precisely to the
intersection  of the two nearest grid lines.  This makes precise placing of
boxes with the mouse very quick and easy.  If Snap to Grid is on, grid snap
occurs whether or not the grid is visible.

Ruler
-----

Allows you to turn the ruler on or off and to specify its units.

Outlines
--------

Normally,  every  box is surrounded by a dotted border (solid if the box is
active),  and  may  have handles.  If Outlines is turned off, these borders
are not drawn.  Turn Outlines on when editing a page, and off to see how it
will look as output.

Columns
-------

If  this  is  turned  on,  the  page  margins  and  columns  (as set by the
Page/Alter  items)  are displayed as dashed lines.  Columns are only visual
indicators.   They  can be used as guides for the placement of boxes on the
page (see the Tutorial and Design sections).

Text Format
-----------

There  are a wide variety of word processors and text editors available for
creating text on the Amiga.  In addition, you may wish to import ASCII (raw
text) files from other machines such as MacIntoshes, IBMs, and so on.  Many
of  the  Amiga  text  editors  have  particular  file formats which require
special   interpretations   to   import   them   into   Professional  Page.
Professional Page understands several of these formats.

*  Always  check  what  sort of text file you are importing, and select the
text  format  accordingly.   If  there isn't a format which exactly matches
your file, use the generic setting.

* You may embed a wide variety of formatting codes in your file at the word
processing   stage   (see   Appendix   F:    Formatting  Text  for  further
information).

*  In addition to their own formats, many word processing programs can save
a  "text  only"  version of the file.  If your word processor is not one of
those supported, use text only if you can.

Hyphenation Control
-------------------

Sets  the  previx and suffix parameters for hyphenating text and allows you
to load or change the current exception dictionary.  Hyphenation Control is
located  in  the  Preferences  menu rather than the Type menu because it is
global,  set  once,  and  not usually reset in the course of the document's
production.   To  add to, or load a new exception dictionary, type the name
of your list in the string gadget and click either Load or Merge.

Print Specifications
--------------------

Sets  up  the  global  output  device  environment.   Print  Specifications
requester will provide the following information:

*  Output  Page  Size:   specifies  the  physical  sheet size of the output
device.  For example, a laser printer.

* Roll Paper Size:  specifies the roll size for a continuous output device.
For example, a laser typesetter.

*  Negative  print:   indicates  whether  the  image should be printed as a
negative.

*  Mirror  print:   indicates  whether  the image should be mirrored before
printing.

* Halftone Screen:  specifies the density and angle of screen.

QuickMove
---------

Controls  whether  the  contents of your box are visible while being moved.
By  default,  when  you pick up a box to move it, only the outline acutally
moves.   The  contents stay where they were, and only move when you put the
box  down.   Sometimes  it  is convenient to see the contents while you are
moving  the  box.  If the QuickMove is turned off, the box contents will be
picked  up  and moved around.  This item toggles QuickMove on and off.  The
contents  of the Box do not show even when the QuickMove item is off if the
system is low on memory.

Memory Warning
--------------

If  at  any  time  you are low in contiguous chip memory, Professional Page
gives  a  "low memory" warning.  his item allows you to turn the low memory
warning  on  or off.  Note that if you do get this warning, you should save
your document to be on the safe side.

Black & White
-------------

This  option  switches  Professional  Page into a black and white operating
mode.  This results in increased speed and memory efficienty.  If you don't
require Professional Page's color capabilities this option should always be
on.   In  black  and  white mode, bitmap graphics are dithered for onscreen
display.  Output is not affected.

FRONT-BACK GADGETS
------------------

This  standard  Amiga  gadget  allows  you to toggle between one screen and
another.   For  example,  you  may  be running another Amiga program in the
background,  and wish to go from the Professional Page screen to this other
program  without  rebooting.   Just  click  on  the  left  gadget to switch
screens.

THE TOOL PALETTE
----------------

The tool palette contains a variety of layout and structured drawing tools.
The  palette  is  divided  into  five  parts:   The Page Number gadget, the
General  Tools  palette, the Screen Position gadget, the box Control tools,
and the Structured Drawing tools.

NOTE:   Once you select one of these tools, it will generally stay selected
until  you  specifically  select  another  tool.  Note that the tool gadget
stays highlighted and the mouse pointer changes to reflect the state.

PAGE NUMBER GADGET
------------------

The  Page  Number gadget allows you to view any page in your document.  The
gadget indicates the page number of the currently visible page.

* Pressing the top arrow will ring up the next page in the document.

* Pressing the bottom arrow will bring up the previous page.

*  Pressing  the  down  arrow  from  the first page, shows the "even", then
"odd", template pages.  Template pages can be edited exactly like any other
page.

*  The  text  line  in  the  middle of the gadget displays the current page
number.   To  go  directly to another page, delete the current page number,
type in the number of the page you wish to view, and press RETURN.

* Type "e" or "o" to see the even or odd template.

THE GENERAL TOOLS PALETTE
-------------------------

Box Create Tool
---------------

Makes boxes anywhere on a page or on the art board.

*  Click  on the Box Create Tool icon.  This turns on Box Create mode.  The
pointer turns into crosshairs on the screen.

*  Click  and drag a box to the desired size.  You can create more than one
box by just clicking and dragging each box in turn.

*  Make  sure  you  return to the tool palette and exit from the Box Create
mode if you want to use some other tool.

*  Using  Augo  Box,  a box can be automatically created to the size of the
particular  column.   It  will  take  on  the maximum possible size in that
oclumn  without  overlapping  other  boxes.   To use Auto Box in Box Create
mode, ho9ld the CTRL key down while clicking in that column.

Null Pointer
------------  

The  Null mode is used to move and size objects on the screen.  Clicking in
this  gadget  turns  off the current mode and returns it to Null mode.  The
mouse pointer changes to an arrow.

Make Group
----------

Selects one or more boxes as a group.

*  To  make a group, drag out an outline around the boxes to be included in
the  group.   Those  boxes that are completely contained within the outline
will form the new group.

*  After  a  group  is  made,  the  Group tool automatically turns off, and
returns to the Null mode.

Hand Move
---------

Turns  on  Hand Move mode.  If you are in a higher magnification mode where
not  all  of  the page is visible, this mode allows you to pick up the page
and drag it around to see other parts of it.

* Drag the page in the direction that you wish the page to move relative to
the screen.

Text
----

Turns on Text Edit mode.

* Select the Text tool

* Select the box to edit by clicking in that box.  To select another box to
edit, simply click in the other box.

*  Using  Auto  Box,  a  text  box  can  be  created in a particular column
automatically.   The  text  box  will  be  the largest possible box in that
column  without  overlapping  other  boxes.   To use Auto Box, click in the
desired column while holding the CTRL key.

Mop
---

Mops up or deletes the contents of a box or a series of linked boxes.

* Select the Mop tool, and click in the box whose contents you wish to mop.
The contents of the box will be deleted after confirmation.

WARNING:  If the box is a text box linked to other text boxes, the contents
of the other linked boxes will also be deleted.

PAGE POSITION GADGET
--------------------

Scrolls  around  a  magnified  page.   The gadget shows a white positioning
rectangle  representing  the  screen image, inside a larger black rectangle
indicating  the  entire  page.   The  positioning  rectangle  indicates the
location  of  the  visible portion of the page in the current magnification
mode.

*  To  change the position, simply drag the smaller rectangle around within
the representation of the full page.

NOTE:   You  can  use the Page Position gadget to find the general area you
want, and then Hand Move for fine adjustment.

BOX CONTROL TOOLS
----------------

This  group  of  gadgets represents functions that affect the relationships
among boxes.

Box to Front/Box to Back
------------------------

Reorders the layering of overlapping boxes.  The boxes are normally layered
in  the  order in which they were created.  Each box is created in front of
all  the  others.   You  can  change the order of the boxes by bringing the
active box to the front or sending it to the back.

Next Linked Box
---------------

If the active box is in a text chain (linked to other text boxes), clicking
on  the  Next Box gadget will activate the next box in the chain.  The view
will shift to show the next box if it was not previously visible.

Previously Linked Box
---------------------

Similarly,  the  Previous  Box gadget will activate the previous box in the
current chain of text boxes.

NOTE:   These gadgets will only work on text boxes that are linked to other
text boxes.

Link
----

Creates a chain of text boxes.

*  The active box must be a text or empty box either isolated or at the end
of an existing chain.

*  Select  the  Link  tool.  Click in the box you wish to add to the chain.
This box will now be added to the chain and will become the active box.

*  An Auto Box can be created and linked by holding the CTRL key down while
clicking the mouse button.

Unlink
------

Breaks a chain of text boxes.

*  Select  the Unlink tool.  Click in he box which you wish to unlink.  The
chain  will  be  broken  at  the  beginning of this box.  This box will now
become the first box in a new chain which contains the rest of the previous
chain.

DRAWING TOOLS
-------------

These  gadgets  enable you to draw structured or object oriented (CAD type)
drawings,  anywhere on the page or art board.  Professional Page allows you
to create shapes in a variety of line weights and colors.  The line weight,
line color, and fill pattern can be changed from the Draw menu.

Straight Line
-------------

*  Click  on the page and while the left mouse buton is still down move the
mouse to drag out the line.  Once you are satisfied with the positioning of
the line, release the mouse buton to put the line on the page.

*  If  you  hold  down the ALT-key when you put down the first point of the
line it will be constrained to the nearest 45 degrees.

Rectangle
---------

* Click on the page; this anchors one corner of the rectangle.

* Drag the opposite corner to the required size.

*  Holding  down the ALT-key while drawing the rectangle constrains it to a
square.

Ellipse
-------

* Click on the page, the location of the center of the ellipse.

* Drag the corner of the ellipse box out to the desired size.

*  Holding  down  the  ALT-key while drawing constrains the ellipse to be a
circle.

Bezier Curve
------------

Draws  curves  in  a  manner similar to the "rubber band" curves that Amiga
users are familiar with from bitmap paint programs such as Deluxe Paint II.

* Draw a line as described in the Line tool

* A "rubber band" curve will follow the cursor.

*  Click and release the left mouse button when the curve looks the way you
want it.

* Holding the ALT-key while drawing the initial line constrains it to be at
the nearest 45 degrees.

Free Hand Drawing
-----------------

Draws freehand shapes.

*  Press the left mouse button.  As long as you keep it depressed, you will
draw wherever the mouse moves.

* As soon as you release the button, everything drawn is placed in a box.

Polygon
-------

Draws straight line polygonal shapes.

*  Click and release the left mouse button to start the first line segment.
Move  the  mouse to the next point.  Clicking and releasing draws the first
line  segment and starts rubber banding the second, continue as long as you
want.   Double-clicking the left button ends the polygon (after drawing the
last line segment).

*  Holding  the  ALT-key  before  drawing  the  initial point will close he
polygon regardless of where the last point is.

APPENDICES....
-------------


APPENDIX A:  TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE
----------------------------------

This appendix provides solutions to common problems and some suggestions on
how to avoid them.

Save Your Document
------------------

The  best insurance against unexpected problems is to save your work often,
so  that  if  your  system  crashes  or  hangs up, you will only lose a few
minutes of work.

Memory Warning
--------------

If  the  memory  warning  requester  appears, you are running low on "chip"
memory.   Even  if you have several megabytes of RAM, it is possible to use
up  your  512K  of  Amiga  chip  memory while you still have plenty of fast
memory unused.  You should:

* Save your work to disk by selecting Project/Save.

* Close any windows on the Workbench screen.

*  Stop  any  multitasking  (terminate any programs other than Professional
Page)

* Break up a long document into several short documents.

Won't import text, graphics, or drawings
----------------------------------------

* Check to see that you are using the right import format (for example, you
may   have   tried   to   import   a   structured  drawing  file  with  the
Project/Import/Bitmap Graphic sub-item).  If you are importing a text file,
ensure  that  Preferences/Text Format has been set to accept the particular
file format that you wish to import.

*  Be  certain  that  you have selected an empty, active box to receive the
file  for  bitmap  and  structured graphics.  If the active box already has
contents, the file won't laod.

Won't Print
-----------

* Be sure the printer is turned on.

*  Check that the printer and the Amiga have the correct baud rate set (eg.
9600).

*  Ensure  that you have the proper cable (eg.  null modem cable), and that
it is connected properly.

Waiting
-------

If  you  have  selected  Load, Save, or Print, and nothing is happening, be
patient.   It  takes time to load and print large files, and to load bitmap
graphics.

Fills don't work in High Magnification
--------------------------------------

Any structured graphic fill (including box frames) that exceeds the size of
the  screen  will not be filled in on the screen.  The attributes are kept,
and will show up in lowe magnification mode.


APPENDIX B:    KEYBOARD EQUIVALENTS
-----------------------------------

Many  of  the  gadget  and  menu  functions  can be accessed using keyboard
shortcuts.   The  following  list contains all the menu items and sub-items
and  their shortcuts, if available.  Note that the same convention followed
in the rest of the manual is followed here:

* A x Hold the right Amiga key down and press key "x"

* a x Hold the ALT key down and press key "x"

* c x Hold the CONTROL key down and press key "x"

* s x Hold the SHIFT key down and press key "x"

RETURN KEY
----------

Generally  when  a  requester  asks for information to be typed in pressing
RETURN after the text will select the OK gadget on that requester.


APPENDIX C:   UTILITIES
-----------------------

MAKEFONT
--------

The MakeFont program is used to make new screen representations of existing
fonts  in  different sizes.  For example, to make Helvetica 13 point, use a
different size (such as 12 point) and expand it to 13 point.

The  user  need not create a screen representation for every font size they
wish  to use.  If Professional Page cannot find a screen representation for
a  given  size  on  disk  it  uses  the  next smalles size and scales it up
on-the-fly.   However,  this  degrades  the performance of the system.  For
often  used  sizes,  it  is  recommended  that  MakeFont  be used to create
permanent representation.

Users  will  note  that  fonts  which have been greatly expanded from their
original  size  will be jagged and missing pixels.  Your WorkBench 1.2 disk
contains  a  FontEd  program which can be used to tidy up your new sizes if
desired.  It is generally better to expand a font than to contract.

To use MakeFont
---------------

* Double click on the MakeFont icon.

*  Once  the program starts up, enter the name and size of an existing font
in  string  gadgets on the top half of the screen.  This font must exist in
your current fonts directory.

*  Enter the name and size of the font you wish to create in string gadgets
on the lower half.

* Click OK

* The new font will be created and saved in your current fonts directory.

APPENDIX D: CONNECTING YOUR AMIGA TO A PRINTER
----------------------------------------------

*WARNING*  Before  connecting  your  Amiga  to  any printer, check with the
vendor(s)  of the Amiga and the printer for instructions on how to make the
connection  safely.   The  Amiga  1000  has a non-standard RS-232 connector
which will feed a 5-Volt current through a standard printer cable.  This is
enough  to  damage  or destroy your printer!  You will need a special Amiga
1000  printer  cable  in  order to avoid this.  The Amiga 500 and the Amiga
2000  use  standard  cables.  If you have a mixture of Amiga 1000's, 500's,
and  2000's,  ensure  that  you  have all the proper cables, and label them
correctly.   Gold Disk Inc takes no responsibility for damages and injuries
that may arise from installation or use of hardware.

This  appendix in intended as a brief guide to help Professional Page users
connect  their  computers  to  various  printers  or  typeseting  machines.
Remember  to turn the power off on the computer and printer when connecting
cables.   Professional  Page  will output to all PostScript output devices.
Generally,  a  Null-Modem  cable  is  required  between  your  computer and
printer.

LASER PRINTERS
--------------

You may want to connct your Amiga to a PostScript compatible Laser Printer,
such  as  an  Apple LaserWriter or a QMS PS/800+.  In this case connect the
serial port of your Amiga to the serial port of the printer.  Some printers
may  require  special  gender  changer  plugs or cables.  Ensure your laser
printer is configured to accept PostScript input.

TYPESETTERS
-----------

You  may want to connect your Amiga to a Raster Image Processor (RIP) and a
PostScript  compatible  typeseting  machine  such  as a Linotronic 300 or a
Linotronic 100 typeseter.  Again check that you have the correct cables and
plug converters (if necessary).  Check that the RIP is configured to accept
PostScript output at the same rate as your Amiga serial port is sending the
data.  The serial port transmission rate can be set from Preferences.  Plug
the cable into the RE232C port on the RIP.

NOTES
-----

Questions  of  what  sort  of  paper  or  file  to  use, and what fonts are
available,  are  beyond  the  scope  of  this appendix.  The vendor of your
printer  should be able to give you information in this area, and books and
magazines  on  desktop publishing, as well as the Gold Disk periodical "The
New Laser Times" contain specific information on these subjects.


APPENDIX F:  FORMATTING TEXT
----------------------------

Many  users  will  want  to  enter  large  quantities  of text using a word
processor.   This leads to the problem that a given program may not support
many  of the formatting commands used in Professional Page.  To work around
this  Professional Page supports imbedded ASCII formatting codes.  If these
codes  are  put  into the original file Professional Page will import these
codes  as well as any word processor specific codes according to which file
format you have selected under preferences.

Note  that all formatting commands consist of a backslash (\) followed by a
number  of  codes.   No  space should be left between the backslash and the
code.  Some codes are followed by a parameter, either a number (fixed point
or  float)  or  a name given further information.  If a parameter is needed
type  the less than sign (<), the number, and the closing greater than sign
(>).  Also the case of the formatting code is significant.

LINE SPACING
------------

Fixed Linespacing: A specific point size can be given.

* \lf<point size>

* eg. \lf<24> for 24 pt fixed spacing

Relative  Linespacing:  A percentage of the largest type size appearing ona
specific line can be used.

* \lr<percentage>

* eg. \lr<120> for 120% relative spacing

Leading:   The  size of the typeface being used plus (or minus) a specified
amount of leading can be used.

* \l1<points of leading>

* eg. \l1<2> for 2 pt leading

BASELINE
--------

Additionally the baseline can be shifted a given number of points.

* \ls<points of shift>

* eg. \ls<2> for a 2 pt baseline shift

TYPE
----

Typeface:   A  particular  typeface  can  be specified.  This typeface must
exist in your fonts:  directory.

* \ff<font name (from directory)>

* eg. \ff<helvetica>

Size: A particular type size can be specified.

* \fs <size (in points)>

* eg. \fs<24>

JUSTIFICATION
-------------

Various justification modes can be specified.

* Left: \jl

* Right: \jr

* Centered: \jc

* Flush: \jf

PARAGRAPH INDENT
----------------

Various paragraph indents are possible.

* indent: \pi

* outdent: \po

* no indention: \pn

Paragraph break size: This is set as a percentage of the line space.

* \ps<percentage>

* eg.  \ps<150> to indicate paragraph spacing to be 150% of current line
  spacing.

TYPE STYLE
----------

Various styles can be selected.  These codes toggle these modes on and off.

* Bold on: \B

* Bold off: \b

* Italics on: \I

* Italics off: \i

* Underline on: \U

* Underline off: \u

* Outline on: \O

* Outline off: \o

This code turns oall the above styles off giving plain text.

* \n

COLOR
-----

A color form thos contained in the color database may be selected.

* \c<color name>

* eg. \c<Red>

LETTER SPACE CONTROL
--------------------

These codes turn automatic kerning on and off.

* Kerning on: \K

* Kerning off: \k

These codes turn automatic hyphenation on and off.

* Hyphenation on: \H

* Hyphenation off: \h

This code sets tracking in 100ths of em spaces.

* \t<tracking>

SPACES
------

The following codes insert EN, EM, and thinspaces respectively.

* EN: \N

* EM: \M

* thin: \T

OTHERS
------

This code is used to indicate the end of the text to be imported it it is
not the end of the file.

* \.

This code indicates a soft (discretionary) hyphen.

* \-

APPENDIX G: USING OTHER AMIGA PRODUCTS WITH PROFESSIONAL PAGE
-------------------------------------------------------------

Professional  Page  is  designed  to  allow you to take advantage of a wide
range  of  other Amiga software.  Many word processors and text editors are
supported.   In addition, the Amiga's superb graphics are available for you
to  use in your documents, either in graytones within Professional Page, or
in full color using the Professional Color separator.  The program also has
its own full-featured word processor.

We recommend the use of some of the graphic software described below.  Once
the  picture  has  been  created,  Professional  Page  has many options for
scaling, sizing, screening, combining with type, and printing out.

Word Processors
---------------

The  Text  Format  item in the Preferences menu allows you to select from a
variety  of  word  processing support programs.  Generic ASCII text is also
supported  so  that  text  from  virtually any Amiga word processor or text
editor,  or  from computers other than the Amiga, can be used.  Some of the
Amiga file format supported are:

* WordPerfect
* Scribble
* TextCraft
* Generic

You  may  need  to  test  how  ASCII  files  from various sources come into
Professional  Page.   Not  all  word  processors produce identical raw text
files, and there may be undesired characters in the file when it comes into
Professional Page.

Remember  that  formatting  codes can be inserted into the text at the word
processing  stage, greatly simplifying your task of using Professional Page
to typeset a document (See Appendix F:  Formatting Text).

Bitmap Graphic Software
-----------------------

Professional  Page  supports  the full range of Amiga IFF graphic software.
Any  size  of bitmap up to 1024 by 1024 pixels, and any number of colors up
to  4096  in  Hold  And  Modify  (HAM)  mode,  can  be  accommodated.   The
Professional  Page  screen display is in high resolution (640 by 400 pixels
on  NTSC  Amigas),  and  pictures  created  in  this  resolutin  or  in low
resolution  or  in  low  resolution  will  appear  on  screen in the proper
proportions.   Pictures  created  in  medium  or interlace resolutions will
appear  distorted when they are imported into Professional Page.  Using the
Graphic  Scale  values  in  the  Box/Alter/Active sub-item, you can rescale
pictures  to the correct proportions.  Examples of bitmap graphics programs
supported by Professional Page are:

* Deluxe Paint II paint program
* Aegis Images paint program
* Digi-Paing Hold And Modify (HAM) paint program
* GraphiCraft paint program
* Digi-View video digitizer
* Easyl pressure sensitive drawing tablet
* 3D or animation software, such as Sculpt-3D, Videoscape, Animator's
Apprentice, or any animation program which can save and export IFF imaages.
* Grabbit screen capture utility.

If  you  are interested in using Amiga graphics in your documents, you will
probably  want  to  combine  several  of the above mentioned packages.  For
instance,  a  photograph  scanned  into  the Amiga with the Digi-View video
digitizer  can  be retouched or composited with other scanned photos, using
Deluxe Paint II or Digi Paint.

Digital Photography Tips
------------------------

Any  photographic  print  or  line  art  can be scanned into the Amiga with
Digi-View  and  a  video  camera.  What yields the best results is to use a
film  negative  or  transparency  rather than a print.  Lit from underneath
using a light box with a color-corrected bulb, better detail, contrast, and
tonal or color values are captured digitally.

Easyl tips
----------

The  Easyl  pressure  sensitive  drawing pad can be used with its own paint
package  (Easyl  Paint),  or with any other paint package (so, for example,
you  can  draw or trace directly into Deluxe paint II with the Easyl and an
ordinary  pencil and paper).  The Easyl is an excellent tool for tracing as
well  as  freehand drawing.  Maps and photos can be traced very rapidly and
accurately.

Image Processing Software
-------------------------

There  are  also Amiga programs which will allow you to edit images created
with  the  products  mentioned  above  in  very  usefulways.  Butcher is an
excellent  graphic  editing  utility.   It  allows  you  to view and change
palettes  with  ease, converts size formats, and allows you to perform many
other manipulations with ease and speed.

Interlace Flicker Reducers
--------------------------

If  you have a long persistence phosphor monitor, then the flicker produced
by  the  Amiga's interlaced high-resolution display won't be a problem.  If
you  have  a regular Amiga monitor, you may find it irritating to work with
an   interlaced  display  for  long  periods.   A  simple  and  inexpensive
alternative  is a tinted screen, which will greatly reduce monitor flicker,
such as Jitter-Rid, Flicker-Master and EYE-RESolution screen covers.

Memory Expansions
-----------------

If  you  have  an  Amiga 1000 or an Amiga 500 with 512K of memory, you will
need  to  expand  your  memory  to at least one megabyte to use Professinal
Page.   The  larger  the documents you wish to produce, and the more bitmap
graphics  you  use, the more memory you'll need.  Memory boards are made by
companies  like  Comspec,  Alegra,  Amega,  and Microbotics.  For the Amiga
2000,  one  or  two  megabyte RAM expansion cards can be inserted into card
slots inside the computer, to give you up to a maximum of nine megabytes of
memory.

Hard Drives
-----------

If  you  are  using  Professional  Page with your Amiga to do a significant
volume  of  commercial production, you will find a hard drive to be useful.
Hard drives are available for the Amiga 1000 and a variety of 5 1/4", and 3
1/2" hard drives and hard cards are available for the Amiga 2000.

* Warnings.

CORRECTIONS TO THE MANUAL
-------------------------

TUTORIAL - Using "Save As"
-------------------------

During  the Tutorial, you are asked to select PROJECT/SAVE AS.  Immediately
after  the  "Save Document As" requester appears, a System Request may also
appear, asking you to "Please replace volume PPage in any drive".  Just hit
the "Cancel" gadget in this System Request.

TUTORIAL - Coordinates
----------------------

The  manual  states,  "when  you  are  resizing  your  box  (the  menu  bar
coordinates  represent) the box dimensions, not its position." This is also
the case when you are creating a box.

TUTORIAL - Group outlines
-------------------------

Boxes  in  a  group  (other  than  the current box) are displayed with long
dashed lines, not with solid black lines as stated in the manual.

TUTORIAL - Locked Boxes on Pages created from Templates
-------------------------------------------------------

When  you create a page from a template, all of its boxes are automatically
locked.   In  order  to  perform  any  operation  on  a  locked  box  (like
repositioning,  resizing,  or deleting it), the box must first be unlocked.
The operations found in the "Onto the Art Board" and "Rearranging the Page"
sections of the Tutorial require this additional step.  To UNLOCK a box:

* Make the Box Active

* Select the BOX/ALTER/ACTIVE sub-item

*  Click  on  the  LOCK  gadget  (an  unlocked  box is indicated by an open
padlock)

* Click on OK

TUTORIAL - Hidden boxes behind opaque boxes
-------------------------------------------

You  are  requested  to  delete one of the boxes.  When you do this, notice
that there was another box, containing a bar graph, behind the one you just
deleted.

TUTORIAL - Scaling Bitmap Graphics
-----------------------------------

You are told to adjust the graphic scale to 0.8.  The values for both X and
Y should be adjusted.

USING PROFESSIONAL PAGE - Show Active Boxes
-------------------------------------------

BOX/SHOW  ACTIVE  will flash the border around the active box in black, not
green.

USING PROFESSIONAL PAGE - Text in Aegis Draw Plus drawings
----------------------------------------------------------

Text  is not supported in Aegis Draw Plus drawings under structured drawing
import.

TECHNICAL REFERENCE - Group outlines
------------------------------------

Group  outlines  are  displayed  as  long  dashed lines, not as solid black
lines.

TECHNICAL REFERENCE - Edit/Replace
----------------------------------

The  requester for Replace now has an "Ignore Case" option, similar to that
for Find.

TECHNICAL REFERENCE - Text Formats
----------------------------------

IFF text is not supported.

TECHNICAL REFERENCE - Hyphenation Exception Dictionary
------------------------------------------------------

Only  one  exception  dictionary  is  allowed.   Its  name is kept with the
document,  and  the  dictionary will be loaded upon reloading the document.
There  is  no  "merge"  option on the "Hyphenation Control" requester.  The
options  are  "load",  which loads the named dictionary, and "clear", which
tells the program not to use any exception dictionary at all.

TECHNICAL REFERENCE - Printer Output Specifications
---------------------------------------------------

Output  size  must  be  specified,  even  if  roll  paper is selected.  All
document pages will be clipped to this paper size.

APPENDIX B - Keyboard Equivalents
---------------------------------

Corrections  to  the Quick Reference Card (listed below) also apply to this
appendix.

APPENDIX B - ALT keys
----------------------

The  phrase "(only available with Professional Page text editor)" should be
ignored.

CORRECTIONS TO THE QUICK REFERENCE CARD
---------------------------------------

RightAmiga-L key:  This is a shortcut for TYPE/JUSTIFICATION/LEFT.
                PREFERENCES/LAYOUT has no keyboard shortcut.

BOX/DELETE ACTIVE:  Both SHIFT-BackSpace and SHIFT-DEL are shortcuts for
                         BOX/DELETE ACTIVE.  RightAmiga-X is not.

NEW FEATURES
------------

No-Eject Option
---------------

There is a new option in the Output Specifications in the PAGE/ALTER/ACTIVE
requester  which specifies that the current page is not to be ejected after
printing.   This  option  enables  you to combine several pages on a single
output sheet.

Bitmap Loading Enhancements
----------------------------

If  a  box containing a bitmap graphic is set to Quick Display, the graphic
will  not be loaded into memory.  This reduces both the time needed to load
a  document  and  the  amount  of memory needed to hold it.  When opening a
document,  you  have the option to sel all of its bitmaps to Quick Display,
and hence not load any of them.

If, when the program tries to load a bitmap, the appropriate file cannot be
found,  you  will  be  asked for a substitute bitmap.  This can happen when
loading a document, or when printing it.
