                  CHAPTER II - Requirements & Installation
 __________________________________________________________________________
 __________________________________________________________________________


 2-1  Software Requirements
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      A) Kickstart
         ~~~~~~~~~
         Tempest requires kickstart 2.04 (V37) or greater to run.
         If you don't have kickstart 2.04 or greater, you can try kicking
         a rom image file into memory to upgrade your system to a newer
         kickstart.


      B) Stack Size
         ~~~~~~~~~~
         Stack is handled by Tempest completely, you don't have to worry about
         it at all.  If your stack is too low for Tempest to run, Tempest
         sets it for you internally, worry free.  Tempest runs in an 8k stack.


      C) Fifo-Handler
         ~~~~~~~~~~~~
         Tempest requires that you run the fifo-handler in your
         startup-sequence BEFORE you try to load Tempest.  Tempest will
         not load if you have not run this handler.

         You must have the fifo-handler installed in your L: directory
         and the fifo.library installed in your LIBS: directory.

         After you have installed the handler and library you need to add
         the following line to your startup-sequence.

         RUN <nil: >nil: L:fifo-handler


      D) SF (Serial Flusher)
         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
         If you are running your bbs with an A2232 Serial Card you will
         need to run the SF (Serial Flusher) Util.  Use the following
         template in your startup script for the bbs.

         Run >NIL: SF 2,3,4,5,6 60 45 TEMPEST:
                 \ \ \ \ \  \  \   \_ Path to BBS Setup Directory
                  \ \ \ \ \  \  \____ Buffer
                   \ \ \ \ \  \______ Delay
                    \_\_\_\_\________ Device Numbers of all Nodes

         Make sure to use a delay of 60 and buffer of 45, they have been
         tested as the best possible results that I can find.

      E) Required Libraries
         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
         asl.library           : Used for requesters in Tempest.
         Fifo.library          : Used for Remote Shell & Dos Doors.
         rexxsyslib.library    : Used for Arexx Doors & Interface.


      F) Font Requirement
         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
         Tempest Requires a 8 point font!  If you use anything bigger and
         you are in NTSC mode, you will find the screen too small!



 __________________________________________________________________________


 2-2  Hardware Requirements
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      A) C.P.U.
         ~~~~~~
         If you want to run more than 1 node and you have high speed
         modems of 14.4+ it is suggested that you have an accelerator.

         Tempest has been tested on: 68000 / 010 / 020 / 030 / 040
         Tempest also works with full copyback mode on 040's.
         Looking forward to testing Tempest on 060 card!


      B) Hard Drive
         ~~~~~~~~~~
         Not needed but to run a good system you need one.


      C) Memory
         ~~~~~~
         You will need no more than 150k of memory per node when Tempest
         is made resident.  Otherwise it will take around 400k per node.


      D) Operating System
         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
         Tempest works on operating systems running at least 2.04(v37)!
         Tempest will not work on kick start 1.3 machines, unless they
         are using a kick program to kick a rom image file into memory.
         NOTE: Workbench v3.0+ is the best operating system.

         Tempest has been tested on: v2.04 / v2.1 / v3.0 / v3.1

      E) Serial Cards
         ~~~~~~~~~~~~
         Any serial card will work with Tempest, however you must consider
         different things  like max DTE rate when considering which serial
         card to buy.

         Tempest has been tested on the following cards:

         A2232, GVP I/O, Multiface III, ISDN Cards, ASDG.

         The best card I have found overall is the GVP I/O Externders.  The
         A2232 would be the best if it only supported more than 19.2 dte rate.


         Advantages/Disadvantages of serial cards I have used and know about:

         o A2232 Serial Card  (GOOD, EXCEPT FOR LOW DTE!)
           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
           (Advantages)

            - Has 7 serial ports.
            - Does not slow up the machine at all!!!
            - Easy to hook up and install.

           (DisAdvantages)

            - Can only use 5 of the ports at 19.2 dte rate.
            - Maximum DTE rate of 19200 baud which is too
              low for most new modems such as 28.8's.
            - Has some other problems with ascii sending
              to the bbs too fast.
            - Requires the use of the Serial Flusher to
              maintain the lines properly.
            - The serial card has been disconntinued a long time ago.


         o Multiface III Serial Card  (DON'T BUY THIS CARD)
           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
           (Advantages)

            - Supports High Dte rates up to 115,000 baud.

           (DisAdvantages)

            - Has only 2 serial ports per card.
            - Slows up the machine a lot!!  More than any other card!
            - Crashes the machine 10% of the time from a cold boot when you
              try to access the ports.


         o GVP I/O Extender Card  (GOOD CHOICE)
           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
           (Advantages)

            - Supports High Dte rates up to 115,000 baud.
            - Slows up the machine but not near as bad as the multiface iii.

           (DisAdvantages)

            - Has only 2 serial ports per card.
            - Second serial port is a simple custom cable that you have to
              buy seperate just to get the 2 ports out of the card.
            - Slows up the machine, but not as bad as the multiface iii.

 2-3  Installation
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Step 1: Unarchive the BBS Software on your hard drive into its own directory.
 Step 2: Make an assignment to the directory you just made.  Example: Tempest:
 Step 3: Make an assignment of NODE: to your T:  Example:  Assign NODE: T:
 Step 4: Load the BBSConfig Utility to configure your BBS.  This is
         REQUIRED to be able to run the BBS.  To load the config util you type
         the name of the config util followed by the node number to edit,
         followed by the assignments of your bbs files that you made above.

 Template:  BBSConfig [NODE] [PATH TO MAIN BBS FILES]

  Example:  BBSConfig 1 TEMPEST:

 Consult the BBSConfig docs to understand how to use it.


 After setting up the bbs in the bbsconfig program, you are ready to load
 the bbs.

 Template:  Tempest [NODE] [PATH TO MAIN BBS FILES]

  Example:  Tempest 1 TEMPEST:


 - After setting up the software through the BBSConfig util, and loading
   the bbs software, you can get into the program by first un-iconifying
   the software (If it is in iconify mode).  To un-iconify the bbs you must
   click on the close gadget of the Tempest iconify window and the bbs will
   un-iconify.
   After you have the main Tempest window opened up you can logon one of
   2 ways.  You can hit the F1 Function key to do a sysop logon or hit
   F2 to do a local login.  You can also use the pull down menus to do
   sysop/local logins.  Read the docs referring to the function keys
   for more commands to access the bbs software.

 - The demo contains a pre made accounts.data file for you, the sysop
   account is already created!.. All you must do is hit F7 to access
   account editor and edit the account to your handle and stats, or you
   can do a sysop logon (F1 Key) and type 'TS' to edit your personal
   information.  The pre-made sysop account has full access to everything
   on the bbs.

 2-4  Directories & Assignments
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      A) Directories  (Some Required, others definable)
         ~~~~~~~~~~~
         ACCOUNTS    -- Defineable path, Used by all nodes.
                        Contains 2 sub directories:
                        APPLICATIONS - New User application answers.
                        FLAGGEDFILES - Lists of user's flagged files.
                        Both sub-directories are hard coded names!

         BULLETINS   -- Contains all your bulletins.
                        HardCoded name, Used by all nodes!

         CATALOGS    -- Contains all file listings / Catalogs.
                        Definable path, Used by all nodes!

         DESCRIBE    -- Contains text files describing areas.
                        Definable path, Used by all nodes or can define
                        a different describe dir for every node.
                        If you are using languages.opt file for multiple
                        languages then you need to put a set of the text files
                        in a sub-directory for every language you use.

         DOORS       -- Contains your doors.
                        Definable path, Used by all nodes!

         FILES       -- Contains directories for all uploaded files.
                        Definable path, Used by all nodes!

         LOGS        -- Contains your log files.
                        Definable path, Used by all nodes!

         MODULES     -- Important doors needed for the bbs to operate.
                        Definable path, Used by all nodes!

         MSG         -- Contains directories for all messages.
                        Definable path, Used by all nodes!

         OPTIONAL    -- Contains many important files for the bbs including
                        files to re-define commands throughout the bbs.
                        Definable path, Used by all nodes!

         RIPGFX      -- Contains all .rip files for rip graphics.

         SCRIPTS     -- Contains all scripts and batch files used by
                        Tempest.
                        Definable path, Used by all nodes!

         SETUP       -- Contains all .data files needed by bbs.

         TEXT        -- Contains most text files viewed through out the
                        bbs. Definable path, Used by all nodes or can define
                        a different text dir for every node.
                        If you are using languages.opt file for multiple
                        languages then you need to put a set of the text files
                        in a sub-directory for every language you use.

      B) Assignments
         ~~~~~~~~~~~

         NODE:   (must be assigned).
                 T: in RAM would be best place.


         You must also have an assignment for your main bbs files.  This
         assignment must contain the Setup directory.
         For Example you could call it TEMPEST:
         Whatever you choose to call it is fine.

         It is also a good idea to make a few other assignments for the
         locations of your files, doors, and messages.

         Examples:

         Assign DOORS: TEMPEST:DOORS
         Assign MSG:   TEMPEST:MESSAGES
         Assign FILES: TEMPEST:FILES

         These are just suggestions so that defining things in the bbsconfig
         can be made easy and if you ever change where your files are to
         another hard drive, this makes it easy to make the switch.

      Global Default File.

      DownloadPaths-X.opt
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      also used for duplicate upload checking as well.

        sub-dir already created for that language and all text files
        within it.

      - If the languages.opt file is not found, Tempest will look for text
        files in the root directory of Text and Describe dirs, just like

      be used if the original path for a file area is full and there is no
      room for storing the file on that hd.  In that case the bbs will scan
      this file, checking the paths to see if there is room to store the
      file and will place it in the first path that has room.


      UploadPaths-X.opt

      to send mail to and select 'Y' yes when asked if you want to make the
      message private.

    - To post anonymous message, if the system flag allows it and the user's
      user flag is set to yes, you simply select 'Y' yes when asked if you
      want it anonymous.

  * - To post priority messages (message to all users) you enter 'EALL'
      when asked who to enter message to.  User must have user flag on
      to be able to do this command.

    - To post password protected messages, if sysop allows it and the
      user's flag is on, you simply say 'y' yes to the prompt asking if you
      want it password protected.

    - When asked who to enter a message to if you enter a pattern with a
      '*' wildcard the bbs will go through all accounts finding matches and
      asking the user if that is who he wants to post mail to.

 COMMANDS Available:  KILL,PRINT,MACRO,CLONE,T-DOOR,P-DOOR,D-DOOR,MODULE,REXX,
                      ECHO,FORCE,EXECUTE,DOWNLOAD

 Command Types
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 - CLONE:
   ~~~~~
   [*,*,*,*,*] = FILES | CLONE | F

   Tells the BBS to accept the Command 'FILES' and make it do the same thing
   as the internal 'F' command would have done.


 - D-DOOR:
   ~~~~~~
   [*,*,*,*,*] = info | D-DOOR | C:Info

   If a user types 'info' it will run the info command in C: and display the
   output just like it would in a regular shell.


 - DOWNLOAD:
   ~~~~~~~~
   [*,*,*,*,*] = RIP | DOWNLOAD | DL:Rip.lha

   With this command you can setup a command to send a file to the user
   with zmodem.


 - ECHO:
   ~~~~
   [*,*,*,*,*] = HELLO | ECHO | Hello World
   Prints a one liner to the screen.


 - EXECUTE:
   ~~~~~~~
   Ability to execute a script with a command.

   [255,*,*,*,*] = UPDATE | EXECUTE |S:UpdateScript.bat


 - FORCE:
   ~~~~~
   This is a slightly dangerous command.  If not used properly it can disable
   many of your commands.  This command is designed ONLY for sysops
   who have their msg and file areas linked together.  Basically this command
   will take whatever was entered and throw it into the opposite area.  So
   if the user was in the Msg Area and typed in 'D file1.dms' it would
   normally not work!  But if you had the following line at the bottom of your
   mainmenu.opt file:

   [*,*,*,*,*] = D | FORCE |

   .. Then the command 'D' would force the user into the file area and it
   would then use whatever was on the command line as if you entered it from
   the file area.  Same process works the other way as well.

   Typical MainMenu.opt file entries:

   [*,*,*,*,*] = D | FORCE |
   [*,*,*,*,*] = Z | FORCE |

   Typical FileMenu.opt file entries:

   [*,*,*,*,*] = E | FORCE |


 - KILL:
   ~~~~
   [*,*,*,*,*] = @ | KILL

   Removes the '@' command from this prompt.


 - MACRO:
   ~~~~~
   [*,*,*,*,*] = rz | MACRO | f;u;;

   Tells the BBS, if some one starts an upload right here, jump to the
   file area, and start an upload.

   [*,*,*,*,*]    = NF         |MACRO |F;N;;G
   Tells the BBS to jump to the File Area, and start a 'New' file search
   globally.


 - MODULE:
   ~~~~~~
   [10,*,*,*,*]   = Edit  | MODULE | Config.mod
   [10,*,*,*,*]   = Arc   | MODULE | MsgArc.mod
   [255,39,*,*,*] = Config| MODULE | BBSConfig.mod

   The above 3 commands would run the modules located in the
   'Modules' Directory.


 - PRINT:
   ~~~~~
   [*,*,*,*,*] = Rules | PRINT | Bulletins:rules.txt
   If a person types the command 'Rules' it will display the following
   text File.


 - P-DOOR:
   ~~~~~~
   [*,*,*,*,*] = Time Bank | P-DOOR | Doors:timebank

   If a user types 'Time Bank' it will run this door, in [partial paragon,*]
   mode.


 - REXX:
   ~~~~
   [*,*,*,*,*] = Time Bank | REXX | REXX:tbank

   If a user types 'Time Bank' it will run the Arexx Script Door.


 - T-DOOR:
   ~~~~~~
   [*,*,*,*,*] = Empire | T-DOOR | Doors:Empire/Empire

   Runs a Tempest Door, when a user types 'Empire'



   [-254,*,*,*,*]    = REMOVE OTHER COMMANDS |
   ; Disables the internal BBS commands with people the security level of
   ; 254 and below.  But the '255' level sysop still has all the internal
   ; commands.

   This command placed in your 'optional files' will allow you to disable

   all the commands that follow this line.  Including the BBS's internal
   commands, so it is very powerful for letting you define your commands.
   Please note the trailing seperator '|' is mandatory.

   PLEASE NOTE, this command will ignore all internal BBS commands so if you
   wish to use them, you must 'clone' them in the optional file before the
   'REMOVE OTHER COMMANDS' line.


   ** NOTE **

   All extra comments and blank spaces will slow up the speed of the bbs when
   it scans through the optional files.  So keep your comments, blank lines,
   and extra spaces to a minimum.

 Special Control Codes to place in Text Files   (case sensetive)
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 TextFiles , Arexx(tm) , Tempest Door
 ------------------------------------
 How to use the following commands:

  1) as a '~' command in a text file.  Use the letter(s) that defines
     the action you wish to use.  For our Example, lets say you want to
     show the Users Computer Type.  (just use the letters not the Number)

     Your Computer is a: ~CT

  2) In Arexx you would use the GetStr Code like so:

     GetStr 73
     transmit 'Your computer is a : ' result

  3) In a Tempest Door you would use the GetStr Command like so:

     char s[60];
     GetStr(s,73);
     pl("Your computer is a: ");
     pl(s);

 *** NOTE ***

 If you see a '!' in the first column, that means this command can only
 be used through the '~' (Text commands), and not Arexx or the Doors
 The LIST TO FOLLOW is in no order except for the lenght of characters in
 the command name.

                         CHAPTER XI - Door Formats
 __________________________________________________________________________
 __________________________________________________________________________


 11-1  Tempest Doors
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Tempest has its own Door format, see Programmers-Docs for Door Code.
 When defining Tempest doors in .opt files, use 'T-DOOR' to define the
 door as a Tempest door.

 __________________________________________________________________________


 11-2  Paragon Door Support
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Tempest Supports Paragon doors internaly.  You only have to specify the
 door as a paragon door, (see 4-12).

 __________________________________________________________________________


 11-3  Arexx Door Interface
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Tempest has a full set of arexx commands to create scripts and doors in
 arexx.  Tempest emulates most commands from all other bbs packages.
 A complete list of arexx commands are listed in the Programmers-Docs file.

 __________________________________________________________________________


 11-4  Dos / Shell Door Interface
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 With Tempest you can run any cli program that uses STANDARD INPUT/OUTPUT.
 If the program does not use Standard Input/Output, the program will lock.
 All you have to do is define the command in the .opt files with the 'D-DOOR'
 command for Dos Door.  Look at section on re-defining commands.

               APPENDIX A - Error Return Codes & Explanations
 __________________________________________________________________________
 __________________________________________________________________________

 If the BBS gives you an error return code, then this is the look up table
 for finding the explanation of the problem.


 Code  Explanations
 ~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   5   Error, could not create message port.
  10   Error, could not allocate enough memory.
  20   Error, could not load data files from setup directory.

                        APPENDIX B - Troubleshooting
 __________________________________________________________________________
 __________________________________________________________________________


 __________________________________________________________________________

 - PROBLEM: Users are entering descriptions for files that were uploaded
            by another user on another node and at the same time.

   ANSWER:  You must have a different work directory for every single
            node you have online, including your local node.  You must
            also have a done directory inside of every work directory.
 __________________________________________________________________________

 - PROBLEM: The bbs is allowing anyone logon without asking for any
            passwords.

   ANSWER:  You are not registered or you don't have your register.data in
            the setup directory.  Another possiblity is that the user who
            didn't have to enter a password had the optional flag disabling
            password entry to Yes, Set it to NO!
 __________________________________________________________________________

 - PROBLEM: The bbs open's the iconify window on the screen then it
            closes and disappears.

   ANSWER: 1) That node's Node Number is the same as another.
           2) Your definition of the serial device name in the
              BBSConfig is different than the actual serial
              device on disk. (THEY ARE CASE SENSITIVE!!!!!!).
           3) Invalid serial device number.
           4) Can't open screen size or font specified.
 __________________________________________________________________________

 - PROBLEM: The user's activity is getting cut off on the iconify window.

    ANSWER: This must be taken care of by increasing the size(length) the
            window opens up as.  It is definable in the BBSConfig program
            under the major paths page.
 __________________________________________________________________________


 - PROBLEM: Your BBS seems to be running slower when a low baud rate user
            is online.

    ANSWER: You need to turn your DTE Rate to FIXED, instead of VARIABLE.
            Modem Settings in BBSConfig util.
 __________________________________________________________________________

 - PROBLEM: Your modem is not reseting properly or is reseting over and
            over.

    ANSWER: Check your Modem RESET STRING in the BBSConfig.
 __________________________________________________________________________

 - PROBLEM: You can not un-iconify Tempest.

    ANSWER: You probably don't have enough chip memory to open the screens
            or a user is online performing a hydra transfer.
 __________________________________________________________________________

 - PROBLEM: Users try to do a new file scan from a date, and the bbs returns
            saying there is no new files, when in fact there is.

    ANSWER: Your file listing MUST be in date order, if it has files that
            are out of order by date, the smart routine for finding the
            date fast will not work.
 __________________________________________________________________________

 - PROBLEM: If your prompts in the BBS are not matching with the options
            and everything looks messed up.

    ANSWER: When re-defining your text / prompts in the promnpts.set file,
            you may of messed up by deleting an line or adding lines.
            Restore the defaults prompts.set file or refer to the
            propmts.set docs to try to locate where you messed up the file.

         APPENDIX D - Auto Description Detection / Creation System
 __________________________________________________________________________
 __________________________________________________________________________

 I would like to start off by saying that Tempest BBS Software was the
 first in the world to offer file_id.diz,disk.id, & desc.sdi auto
 description Detection/Creation on an Amiga run BBS Software Package.
 In fact Tempest had it 5 months before anyone on amiga even attempted to
 install a file_id system.

 - Universal   Detection on (dms,doc,dox,txt,nfo,exe,mod,gif)
 - File_id.diz Detection on (lha,lzh,zip)
 - Desc.sdi    Detection on (lha,lzh,zip)
 - disk.id     Detection on (lha,lzh,zip)
 - Optional Ansi Stripping function to strip ansi out of file_id's
 - Optional pattern match stripping for unwanted bbs ads or text.
   see FileIdStrip.opt file in the optional directory.

 Suported Detection Formats:
 ==========================

 .dms                = DMSDESCRIPT util is required for this format.
 .doc .dox .txt .nfo = TXTEXTRACT  util is required for this format.
 .exe                = EXEDESCRIPT util is required for this format.
 .lha .lzh           = LHA         util is required for this format.
 .zip                = UNZIP       util is required for this format.
 .gif                = GifDesc     util is required for this format.
 .mod                = ModCheck    util is required for this format.


 Suported Creation Formats:
 =========================

 .dms                = DMSDESCRIPT util is required for this format.
 .doc .dox .txt .nfo = TXTEXTRACT  util is required for this format.
 .exe                = EXEDESCRIPT util is required for this format.
 .lha .lzh           = LHA         util is required for this format.
 .zip                = ZIP         util is required for this format.

                 APPENDIX E - Hydra Bi-Directional Protocol
 __________________________________________________________________________
 __________________________________________________________________________

 I would like to start off by saying that Tempest BBS Software was the
 first in the world to offer Hydra Bi-Directional Protocol on an Amiga
 ran bbs.


 Features:

 - Upload / Download / Chat with sysop all at the same time or just
   do single transfers as well.
 - Duplicate Uploaded checking through Uploads.opt file in the optional
   directory.
 - Upload resume supported.
 - Live cps report for both uploads and downloads.


 Notes:

 - You MUST use the CUSTOM THydra made for Tempest to use Hydra on
   Tempest.  If you are wanting to call a BBS and use Hydracom however you
   will use the standard Hydracom for Amiga, and not! the CUSTOM one for
   Tempest.  They are completely different!

 - The special THydra file for TEMPEST must be in the Root directory where
   the Tempest exe is found.

 - To do successful bi-directional transfers, the callers must have the
   Hydra line setting set at 2400.

 - Users wanting to use the Hydra Protocol must first go to the 'TS'
   Terminal Settings Menu and change their protocol types to Hydra or
   at the last transfer prompt is the choice to change protocol.

 - Hydra transfers can only be performed on v32 standard, HST standard does
   not have a back channel fast enough for bi-directional transfers.

 - If a user is doing bi-directional transfers and you enter chat with the
   user it can cause transfer errors.  So if you see transfer errors while
   doing bi-directional and chating, it is normal.

 __________________________________________________________________________
 __________________________________________________________________________

                    APPENDIX F - Archive Checking System
 __________________________________________________________________________
 __________________________________________________________________________

 Archive checking on Tempest is handled by the ArcCheck.mod program found
 in the Modules directory.  Programmers can code their own version and
 replace this util if they choose.

 The default archive checker which comes with Tempest has the ability to
 check, strip, and add files to any archive format you choose, fully
 defineable.

 The files that control the archive checking are found in the scripts
 directory of your tempest files.

 FORMATS:

 test_(archive extension)
 strip_(archive extension)
 add_(archive extension)

 EXAMPLES:

 test_lha
 test_lzh
 add_zip
 add_zoo
 strip_lha
 strip_zip

 Inside these files is where you define the actual archive utility to be used
 and its commands.

 The test_xxx format must have both the '>%s' and the '%s' in the first line
 and the '>%s' must be directly after the archiver util, look at the examples.
 The following lines after the first line that defines the command, are for
 any error messages that are to be checked for to determine that an archive
 is corupted.

 Example test_xxx file:

 --- cut here ----
lha >%s t %s
Operation not entirely successful
 --- cut here ----

 add_xxx and strip_xxxx files contain only the '%s' in the first line and
 there are no additional lines after the first line that defines the
 command line to be used.

 Example add_xxx file:

 --- cut here ----
lha -z a #?%s BBSADS:AddFiles.lha/*
 --- cut here ----

 Source code to the default archive checker can be obtained by asking the
 programmer of Tempest.

 __________________________________________________________________________

                    APPENDIX G - New User Questions File
 __________________________________________________________________________
 __________________________________________________________________________

 The file 'NUQuestions' is the new user questions file, which is stored in
 the text directory of tempest.  In this file you can define any number of
 questions that you wish to ask new users.  With this file you can define the
 questions, how many lines for answers are available for every question, and
 how many characters must be entered for every answer line.

 The 2 types of lines start with either (Q) = Question line, or
 (A) = Answer line.  After this there are 2 spaces for a number value.
 If the line is a question line, then the number provided represents how
 many answer lines are available for this question.  If the line is an
 answer line type then the number will represent the minimum characters
 that must be entered by the user for that answer line.  You must have
 an answer line for every answer line you want the user to have.

 EXAMPLE:

(Q) 1:Where did you find this bbs number -[1 line]
(A) 0:
(Q) 1:Enter Your Real Name and Voice Number -[1 line]
(A) 0:
(Q) 1:Are you a sysop [1 lines]
(A) 0:
(Q) 3:List some of the other boards you call -[3 lines]
(A) 0:
(A) 0:
(A) 0:
(Q) 3:Now tell me about yourself, if you want to -[3 lines]
(A) 0:
(A) 0:
(A) 0:

                  APPENDIX I - Making Tempest & Utils Resident
 __________________________________________________________________________
 __________________________________________________________________________

 Tempest, BBSConfig, EAE, THhdra as well as all Utils, Doors, Modules that
 come with the Tempest Package can all be made resident.

 The resident command is a little  tricky however.  This is an example:

 resident Tempest Tempest:tempest
    ^        ^          ^
     \        \          \_ The actual path and file to load & make resident.
      \        \
       \        \_ Actual Resident Name that you must load tempest with.
        \
         \_ Resident Command in your C:


 Now after running a command like this your Tempest will be resident in
 memory.  However watch these examples:

 run >nil: Tempest 8 Tempest:

 This ^ example works! since you have used the 'Tempest' name which matchs
 the resident name we gave above.  Now watch the next example which does NOT
 work and loads Tempest regular instead of using the resident one.

 run >nil: Tempest:Tempest 8 Tempest:

 This ^ example does NOT load the resident tempest and in fact loads a new
 one normally.  The reason is because we didn't use the resident name, we
 used a path 'Tempest:tempest' which does not match 'Tempest' so it does not
 load the resident one.

 If you keep this in mind and make sure your calls to the programs match the
 resident name you give there should be no problems.

 Another possible problem is if your 'P' Pure Bit is not set on the file
 you are trying to make resident.  If by chance this flag gets turned off
 you will have to turn it back on with the Protect command or a directory
 tool.
