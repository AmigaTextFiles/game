NEW FEATURES IN THIS RELEASE
----------------------------

Improvements - CrossDOS
Improvements - CrossPC
Improvements - Configure an MS-DOS Hard Drive
Improvements - Dr CrossDOS
Improvements - Install
Improvements - READ.ME

Improvements - CrossDOS
CrossDOS  now  has  its  own  disk icon!  When CrossDOS recognizes an MS-DOS
disk,  a disk icon appears with "CrossDOS TM" on the label.  That's not all!
If you are using 2.0 or higher, opening the disk icon will display icons for
files and directories without needing to perform a Show/All Files first.

We  now  support  disks  formatted to 10 sectors per track used primarily on
Atari systems.

Improvements - CrossPC
We've  significantly  increased the speed of the serial port emulation.  Our
tests  show  the  serial  port  to  be  reliable up to the baud rates on the
machines listed below.

    Machine  CPU Speed  CPU Type    Baud
    -------------------------------------
    A3000       25MHZ   68030       38.4K
    A500         7MHz   68000        4.8K

Your  machine  may  exhibit  higher  or  lower  values   depending   on your
configuration.  The general rule-of-thumb to use is: the more CPU power, the
faster the speed.

We've successfully used the following communication programs on CrossPC.

    Procomm
    Telix
    Compuserve Information Manager
    Prodigy
    Laplink

We  now display the information in the CrossPC debug window on the PC screen
at boot time.

We've increased the MS-DOS hard drive speed by about 10%.

We've  improved  the  mouse  driver  emulation to be compatible with more PC
applications.

Improvements - Configure an MS-DOS Hard Drive
We've improved the MS-DOS hard drive configuration program.  It now tries to
support drives that are non-RigidDiskBlock formatted.  It also displays more
information at each step for your peace of mind.

Improvements - Dr CrossDOS
We've  made Dr CrossDOS more intelligent in its diagnosis.  If you're having
difficulties, please use it before calling our technical support line.

Improvements - Install
We now provide an Uninstall option to try to remove as many files associated
with CrossDOS and CrossPC as we can find.  Use this option sparingly.  There
is  NO  need  to  do  an  uninstall before doing an install or reinstall.  A
reinstall  will copy over the earlier releases of files with later releases.

Improvements - READ.ME
We  have  converted  our  READ.ME files into AmigaGuide documents for easier
searches.


RUNNING CROSSDOS OR CROSSPC FROM THE PRODUCT DISK
-------------------------------------------------

Both  CrossDOS  and  CrossPC  can  be  executed   from   this   product disk
(particularly  if  you  are  running  on  a  floppy   based   system).  Just
double-click on the appropriate icon.

To  start:  double-click on the "PC0" icon.  Your internal floppy drive will
now be configured as an MS-DOS drive with the name "PC0:".  You can now read
and write preformatted MS-DOS disks.

If you need to format an MS-DOS disk, double-click on the Format icon in the
system  drawer.  Choose the device to format from the device list and answer
any of the questions and options given.

Double-clicking  on  the  CrossPC icon begins the PC-XT emulation.  Place an
MS-DOS 720K boot disk in your internal drive and it should boot up.  (Please
note  that  68000  users  are  only configured with 256K of PC memory in the
emulation.)

It's that simple.


INSTALLING CROSSDOS OR CROSSPC
------------------------------

You  may  choose  to  install both products using the Install program on the
disk.    This is particularly efficient if you have a hard drive.  If you do
wish  to  install, DO NOT move the files over manually!  The Install program
makes many intelligent choices depending on your system configuration.

Once  installed, you can use most features immediately.  A few features such
as  MS-DOS  hard  disk access may require additional operations be performed
before  you  use it.  For further information see Configuring an MS-DOS Hard
Drive


UNDOCUMENTED CROSSPC FEATURES
-----------------------------

New ToolTypes
Obsolete ToolTypes
Mouse Software
 
New ToolTypes  
Although  CrossPC  and  CrossDOS  can  share data from the same MS-DOS disk,
there  can  be  problems if it is accessed at the same time.  To reduce this
risk  significantly,  we implemented a 'lockout' feature as the default when
using CrossPC.  When CrossPC is running with a CrossDOS device (such as PC0:
or  PCC:)  we  disable  access  to  it from the Amiga side.  When CrossPC is
rebooted (CTRL-ALT-DEL), it will free the CrossDOS devices to be used by the
Amiga.

If  you  wish to share the disks simultaneously between CrossPC and CrossDOS
you  can  set  the  DISKSHARE ToolType in the CrossPC icon.  CAUTION: If the
proper precautions are not followed YOU WILL CORRUPT THE DISK.  See Appendix
C  in the manual called Hard Drive Considerations for an in-depth discussion
about this problem.

It is recommended that you do not use DISKSHARE unless you are confident you
know  what  you  are doing.  Since AmigaDOS and CrossPC both don't know when
the  other is writing to the drive, it is possible to corrupt your floppy or
hard  drive  partition,  losing some or all of your data.  If you do need to
use  the  partition  from both AmigaDOS and CrossPC simultaneously, remember
that  whenever  you  write  to  the  disk, you must make the other operating
system  aware  that  you have changed the disk.  Under AmigaDOS a Diskchange
command  to  the  drive will work, under MS-DOS a CTRL-C or executing CHKDSK
has a similar effect.

STARTPRI=xx
The  default  priority  of CrossPC is -10.  By specifying STARTPRI=xx in the
ToolTypes  of  the  CrossPC icon, the priority of CrossPC is set to xx.  The
limits  for  this  are  -100 to 0.  CrossPC will ensure that the priority is
between  these  two limits.  Increasing the priority may not provide you any
more speed unless you are running other tasks.  You will probably never need
to use this ToolType.

Obsolete ToolTypes CPU1 (Manual Edition 1 only)

This  is no longer used.  If it is present, it is ignored.  The only use for
the CPU1 ToolType was if you had an early GVP accelerator card.  Now CrossPC
automatically  detects  this,  and executes the appropriate code.  If you do
have  one  of  these GVP cards, CrossPC will state that it is using CPU type
68010 instead of 68030.

Mouse Software
It is no longer necessary to use MOUSE.COM.  The equivalent code is executed
whenever  RightAmiga-Help is pressed.  This makes it easier to use the mouse
if you haven't put MOUSE.COM onto an MS-DOS disk.  MOUSE.COM is still useful
if you want the mouse to be enabled automatically from the AUTOEXEC.BAT.

You  can  disable  the  mouse  driver by pressing RightAmiga-Shift-Help.  We
recommend that you do not enable or disable the mouse within an application.
This insures for proper recognition of the mouse by applications.

NOTE:  PC  applications that can use the mouse REQUIRE that the mouse driver
be active before executing the application.


CONFIGURING AN MS-DOS HARD DRIVE
--------------------------------

CrossDOS and CrossPC now support MS-DOS formatted hard drives.  If the drive
you  configure  is  already  formatted, there are certain hard drive formats
that  are  not  'true' MS-DOS.  In this case, we do our best to decipher the
disk but 'all bets are off'.

We  do  require  that  you  install both products using our Install program.
Also,  select  Configure  MS-DOS Hard Disk for CrossDOS & CrossPC to have us
try to create a proper mountfile to match.

You  will  be asked in the Install program whether you want to configure one
of two types of hard disks.

One:  A 'true' MS-DOS hard disk configured as the entire disk.  This type is
useful  if you wish to transfer data between the Amiga and a stand-alone PC.
We  do  HIGHLY  recommend that this type of hard disk be formatted on the PC
first then brought to the Amiga for configuring.

Two:  An 'image' of an MS-DOS hard disk within an Amiga hard disk partition.
This type is particularly useful with CrossPC.

Once  the  hard  drive  is  configured, DO NOT use our Format command or the
standard  Amiga  Format  command  to  format  it.  Instead, treat it like an
unformatted  MS-DOS hard disk.  This means you must use the FDISK and FORMAT
commands  provided  by  MS-DOS  to  partition  and  format  the  hard   disk
respectively.  Failure to heed this warning may cause unpredictable results.


For example, if the configured hard disk is to be used with CrossPC, perform
the following steps:

1. Execute CrossPC and boot off an MS-DOS boot floppy.

2. Run  FDISK  to  partition  your  configured hard drive.  It will reset
   CrossPC after FDISK.

3. Execute CrossPC and boot off an MS-DOS boot floppy again.

4. Run "Format C: /s/v" to format the C: partition and place system files
   on it.

5. Transfer other files from the MS-DOS boot floppy to the C: partition.

6. Reboot CrossPC you should be able to boot off your hard drive.

For  further  information  refer  to  Appendix  C  in  the manual Hard Drive
Considerations  that  discusses  the  different hard drive types and special
considerations.


CHANGES FROM VERSIONS 3 AND 4 OF CROSSDOS
-----------------------------------------

This section is important for users who have an earlier version of CrossDOS.

There  have  been  changes  to  CrossDOS  for a multitude of reasons.  These
reasons range from efficiency, speed, robustness and more.  We hope you like
the  changes.    Most  of  the code is more efficient in both speed and code
size.  Those code pieces that are larger are due to feature additions.

The CrossDOS product has two versions of code for most of its programs.  One
version  is  Amiga 1.3 and 2.0 compatible.  The other is 2.0 ONLY compatible
(identified  by a ".2" on the end of the name).  The 1.3/2.0 code is fatter,
as  you  would  guess,  and generally has a few less features.  We recommend
that  you  install  CrossDOS on the operating system version you wish to run
on.   If you wish to use it under both operating systems, you should install
it under 1.3.

New CrossDOS Utilities
We've Renamed the Default Floppy Devices
MountMF is Gone!
MFORMAT, MDISKCOPY and Kill are History!
TxFilter and IntlTrans have been Combined!
TDPatch12 and TDPatch13

New File System Name
The  file  system code (the cornerstone of the CrossDOS product) has changed
name  from  MSDOSFILESYSTEM  to CrossDOSFileSystem.  If you install CrossDOS
onto your system we will copy this new file system to your L: directory.  We
also copy this same code to L:MSDOSFileSystem so that your old configuration
may still work.

We've Renamed the Default Floppy Devices
The old MS-DOS devices defaulted to the names DI0: through DI3:.  We now use
PC0:  through PC3:.  If you like the old names better, all you have to do is
rename  the  mountfile  from  PC0  to  DI0.   This rule applies to the other
devices  too.  You can name the floppy mountfiles to virtually any name that
does not conflict with any other device name.

New CrossDOS Utilities
We  include  new utilities to support CrossDOS better as well as benefit the
entire  Amiga  system.  We have utilities such as Mount, Format and DiskCopy
that  are  designed  to replace the system utilities of the same name.  They
will  operate  on MS-DOS disks as well as Amiga disks.  They operate just as
the  commands  they  are replacing but they have some additional features to
make life easier.

Although  they are designed to replace the standard Amiga utilities, you can
elect  to  rename  these  utilities to CDMOUNT, CDFORMAT and CDDISKCOPY.  We
recommend that you replace your system commands to utilize these commands to
the fullest.

MountMF is Gone!
We've  replaced  this  command  with  an  advanced  Mount  command that uses
mountfiles.  It can be used by either double-clicking on the mountfile (such
as PC0) or executing a mount of all the devices in a drawer at boot time (we
can do this in the Install program).

We  do not encourage using MountMF but we do have a new replacement for it. 
Our  install program will try to find your old MountMF and replace it.  This
allows you to use it if it is already used in a boot script.

MFORMAT, MDISKCOPY and Kill are History!
MFormat  and  MDiskCopy have been replaced with the full-featured Format and
DiskCopy respectively.  Alternate floppy formats used with MFormat have been
replaced  by special project icons located in the system/Alt_Formats drawer.
We  do  not encourage using these alternate formats unless you have to.  The
Format  utility  will automatically sense the optimum disk format unless you
override  it  by using one of these alternate formats.  We also recommend it
be used from the product disk.  Refer to the READ.ME file in that drawer for
more information.

The  Kill  utility  has been somewhat dangerous to use in the past and it is
now  somewhat  useless.    CrossDOS  is  now more efficient.  If there is no
MS-DOS  disk  in the drives, we try to deallocate all the memory we can.  In
fact, CrossDOS uses no CHIP memory unless it senses an MS-DOS floppy disk in
the drive.

Our  Install  program  will  delete these files as well as the project icons
that are associated with them (such as Kill.DI0).

TxFilter and IntlTrans have been Combined!
We've  combined the functions for setting the text filters and international
translation  tables.    In fact, they should be even easier to use with more
features.    These  functions  have  been  combined  into a commodity called
CrossDOS  located  in  your system drawer.  Refer to the manual in Chapter 4
for more details.

Our  Install  program  will  delete  TxFilter  and  IntlTrans as well as the
project icons that are associated with them.

TDPatch12 and TDPatch13
The  trackdisk.device  code  resident in Kickstart code versions 1.2 and 1.3
has  a couple bugs that need fixing as well as adding a new feature found in
version  2.0  of the trackdisk.device.  TDPatch12 and TDPatch13 correct this
problem  for KickStart V1.2 and V1.3 respectively.  The installation program
will detect the version of KickStart you are running and transfer the proper
patch  version  to  your  C:  directory.   The mfm.device will automatically
execute this file for you if it is needed.

NOTE: TDPatch will not work in conjunction with NOCLICK or TRACKSALVE or the
Applied  Engineering  device  driver  earlier then Version 1.2.  we supply a
small  program  called KillClick (in the diag drawer) to stop the 'clicking'
on the drive for KickStart 2.0 ONLY!

NOTES FOR FLOPTICAL USERS
-------------------------

CrossDOS  and  CrossPC  now support floptical drives.  If you do not know if
you  have  a floptical drive you probably don't have one.  A floptical drive
can  support  the MS-DOS 720K, 1.44M and its own 20M floptical disk format. 
It can also support an Amiga 20M hard drive format.

We  do  recommend  that you install both products using our Install program.
Also,  select  the  Configure  MS-DOS  Hard Disk for CrossDOS and CrossPC to
allow  us to attempt to create a proper mountfile.  When you are configuring
the floptical, make sure you have a preformatted MS-DOS disk in the drive at
the time.  Any MS-DOS disk should do (such as an 720K disk).  This is needed
to sense the proper information from the drive.

Formatting  with  the  floptical  drive  is slightly different too.  This is
because the floptical cannot properly sense the size of the unformatted disk
in the drive.  There are two ways to format in the floptical drive.

One:  Insert a preformatted MS-DOS disk in the drive with the same formatted
size  as  you  want  to  format.    If  you want to format a 1.44M disk, for
example,  insert a preformatted MS-DOS 1.44M disk in the drive first.  Then,
execute  the  Format  program.   Proceed with the program until you come the
requester  that says "Ok to format volume ...  " then insert the actual disk
to be formatted and proceed.

Two:  Double-click  on  the  format  project icon in the :system/Alt_Formats
drawer that corresponds to the desired format.  For example, double-click on
the  MSDOS  720K.Format  icon  to  'force'  the  format of the disk to 720K.
Proceed through the format.

Choose  the method that makes you comfortable.  Experimentation is your best
teacher.

NOTE:  At  this  time,  GVP  controllers will not permit a format of a blank
floppy  using  the  Format  program.    In order to low-level format a blank
floppy  you  need  to  use  their   FAAASTPREP   program,   select   "Manual
Installation"  then  select  "Low  Level  Format".    When   completed, exit
FAAASTPREP and perform a Format with the "Quick Format" option.

TROUBLESHOOTING - CROSSDOS
--------------------------

Here are some ideas to help you should you have trouble using CrossDOS.

General
Ensure  you  have  configured  the drive in which you wish to use the MS-DOS
disk  by Mounting it.  The device names correspond to the device names given
by  Commodore.  For example, PC0: is the MS-DOS device name corresponding to
DF0: and PC1: is the MS-DOS device name corresponding to DF1:.

Avoid file names longer than 8 characters. 

Avoid file extensions longer than 3 characters. 

Avoid space in file names or file extensions. 

Make  sure  you do not mix disk types and format types.  For example, do not
do a low density format on a high density disk or visa versa.  Do not try to
read a high density formatted disk in a low density drive.

When using Workbench, avoid transferring files with file extensions.  Rename
them first if necessary.

Ensure  the  file formats you want to use between both the Amiga program and
the  MS-DOS program are compatible.  For example, an Amiga FinalCopy file is
not readable by an MS-DOS WordPerfect wordprocessor.

Should  you  exhibit  read  or  write  errors  with no specific pattern, try
cleaning the floppy drive heads of both the Amiga and MS-DOS computers.

The easiest way to check an MS-DOS disk from the Amiga is to run the DiskChk
program  included  with  CrossDOS.    The following is a list of most of the
CrossDOS error codes.

Error Messages

No.     Name                    Description

38  MDERR_IndexNotSync      index signal not available
39  MDERR_WrongTrack        drive head on wrong physical track

Possible Problems and Solutions

I  changed  the  MS-DOS  disk  on  the  5  1/4"  drive and still get the old
directory from the previous disk.

    The 5 1/4" drive doesn't support the disk change signal.  When you
    change disks, execute the CLI DiskChange command or our DiskChg command
    on the drive before your next access of the new disk.

I copied a file to an MS-DOS disk but can't find it when reading the disk on
my PC.

    Avoid using spaces in file names.  The MS-DOS computer ignores
    everything after the space character.

I  opened  the MS-DOS disk from Workbench but I see none of the files that I
know are there.

    MS-DOS files don't usually have icon files associated with each file.
    The Amiga uses these icon files to draw the icons in Workbench.  You
    can access the files by either selecting the Window/Show/All Files from
    the Workbench menu (not available under 1.3) or use any application
    file requester or directory utility. Improvements - CrossDOS

DF0:BAD. or DF0:????

    This is OK.  The task that handles the AmigaDOS device called DF0:
    can't recognize foreign disk formats such as MS-DOS.

Disk Ejected Too Soon.

    Disk removed before all information was written to it.  Put the disk
    back into the drive and Retry might recover without corruption.  We
    recommend you wait at least 3 seconds from the last disk access before
    removing the disk.

Disk Full.

    Exceeded the capacity of the system disk.  Remove unnecessary files
    from the disk.

Error=-4.

    TDPatch13 needs to be applied.  Ensure you aren't running NoClick or
    TrackSalve. TDPatch12 and TDPatch13

Error=21.

    Could not find any sectors on the specified track.  Probably not an
    MS-DOS standard density formatted disk readable by your drive.

Error=22.

    Sector not aligned with index signal from disk.  Usually not
    disastrous.  Retry might recover.

Error=23.

    Sector not found.  Disk might be corrupt.  Retry might recover.

Error=24.

    Sector identification information corrupt.  Retry might recover.

Error=25.

    Sector data might be corrupt.  Retry might recover.

Error=38.

    Index signal from the drive not received.  Amiga needs service to
    correct a hardware problem.

Not a DOS Disk.

    Ensure the disk is an MS-DOS disk capable of being read by your drive.
    The disk may be an AmigaDOS disk or MS-DOS high density formatted disk
    in a low density drive.

CrossDOS Plus -- Alternate Floppy Formats
-----------------------------------------

The  advanced  Format  utility (the 1.3/2.0 version only) allows a different
format  to  be  forced  on an MS-DOS floppy disk.  Forcing a format on other
disk types such as AmigaDOS will not succeed.

Forcing  a  format is optional.  Normally the Format utility will format the
disk  to  the optimal size.  If you can, don't force a alternate format.  If
you  do need to force a format, make sure you know what type of disk you are
planning to use.  Forcing a format will override disk size checking.

Floptical  drive  users may need to force a disk format because the software
mechanisms  for  checking  the  size  of  the  media  in  the  drive are not
available.    Follow one of the two procedures detailed in the section Notes
for Floptical Users for formatting disks.

We  recommend that if you must force a format, that you use the icons on the
product  disk.  Installed versions can be used if the 1.3/2.0 version of the
Format command is installed.

Alternate Format Types

The following are the types of alternate formats supported.  Double-click on
the  icon  that  matches  the  format  desired.    Do  not modify any of the
ToolTypes in the icon.  This may result in an improper format.

MSDOS 720K.Format
This  is  the standard format for an MS-DOS 3 1/2" low density disk.  If you
are  using  the  standard Amiga drive don't use this icon but rather use the
Format utility instead.

This  format is useful for floptical drive users because the software cannot
sense when a low density disk is in the drive.

MSDOS 1.44M.Format
This  is the standard format for an MS-DOS 3 1/2" high density disk.  If you
are  using  the  standard  Amiga  high density drive don't use this icon but
rather  use  the  Format  utility instead.  If you do not have an Amiga high
density drive, forcing this format will fail.

This  format is useful for floptical drive users because the software cannot
sense when a high density disk is in the drive.

Floptical 20M.Format
This is the format for a MS-DOS 20 Meg floptical disk.  This format is not a
hard drive format but a compatible floppy format.  Do not use this format if
your floptical device is configured as a hard disk.

If  you  do  not  have  a floptical drive, forcing this format will probably
fail.

This  format is useful for floptical drive users because the software cannot
sense when a disk the size of a floptical is in the drive.

ATARI 720K.Format
This  is  the  standard format for an Atari ST 3 1/2" low density disk.  Use
this  if  you  must  but  most  Atari-STs  can read the standard MS-DOS 720K
format.

MSDOS 360K.Format
This  is  the standard format for an MS-DOS 5 1/4" low density disk.  If you
are  using  the  standard Amiga drive don't use this icon but rather use the
Format utility instead.


Notes for Floptical Users
Formatting with the floptical drive may require forcing a disk format.  This
is  because  your SCSI host controller cannot properly sense the size of the
unformatted  disk  in  the  drive.    There are two ways to format using the
floptical drive.

One:  Insert a preformatted MS-DOS disk in the drive with the same formatted
size  as  you  want  to  format.    If  you want to format a 1.44M disk, for
example,  insert a preformatted MS-DOS 1.44M disk in the drive first.  Then,
execute  the  Format  program.   Proceed with the program until you come the
requester  that says "Ok to format volume ...  " then insert the actual disk
to be formatted and proceed.

Two:  Double-click  on  the  format  project  icon in the system/Alt Formats
drawer that corresponds to the desired format.  For example, double-click on
the  MSDOS  720K.Format  icon  to  'force'  the  format of the disk to 720K.
Proceed through the format.

Choose  the method that makes you comfortable.  Experimentation is your best
teacher.

NOTE:  At  this  time,  GVP  controllers will not permit a format of a blank
floppy  using  the  Format  program.    In order to low-level format a blank
floppy  you  need  to  use  their   FAAASTPREP   program,   select   "Manual
Installation"  then  select  "Low  Level  Format".    When   completed, exit
FAAASTPREP and perform a Format with the "Quick Format" option.
