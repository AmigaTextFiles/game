INTRODUCTION
------------

Welcome
Thank  you  for  purchasing  MaxonMagic,  the screen saver and system audio
manager for your Amiga.

With  its  combination  of  useful,  amusing  screen  modules and fun audio
samples  for  system  events,  MaxonMagic is an ideal addition to any Amiga
setup,  saving you money and allowing you to personalise the look and sound
of your computer.

Please  read  through  this  manual  carefully  before  attempting  to  use
MaxonMagic  -  if  you experience any problems or incompatibilities you may
call  on our technical support services as described in the Appendix but it
will  help us, and you, if you are fully aware of MaxonMagic's capabilities
before contacting us.

Good luck, and have fun!

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
-------------------

MaxonMagic needs the following:

. Amiga computer (A500-A4000) with 1Mb of RAM or greater.

. Keyboard.

. Floppy disk drive; 2 drives or a hard drive recommended.

. Workbench 1.3 or higher (Some effects require Workbench 2.0 or higher).

MAKING A WORKING COPY
---------------------

Before  using  MaxonMagic you should make a backup copy of the distribution
disks  and  put the originals away in a secure place; safe from extremes of
temperature  ,  magnetic  fields,  moisture and children!  The disks can be
backed  up  using  the  Workbench or any backup utility - before making any
backup always write- protect the master to prevent accidental erasure.

The  disks  are  not  copy  protected  to  allow  easy  backup and to avoid
inconvenience;  remember  though  that  the  software  and  this manual are
protected  by  international  copyright  laws and you are only permitted to
copy  the software for you own personal use.  If this sounds officious look
at  it  another way - if you give away copies of MaxonMagic to your friends
we  will not receive enough revenue from the sale of the package to improve
this and other products.  We want to help you, please help us in return.

REGISTRATION CARD
-----------------

Enclosed  with  this manual is a registration card which you should fill in
and  return  to  us in order to register your purchase of MaxonMagic.  This
will  entitle  you to a free period of technical support and will enable us
to keep you informed of future developments to our software.

For  details  of  our  technical  support  services,  please  refer  to the
Technical Support Appendix in this manual.
 
You  will  need to quote your serial number (to be found on the disk label)
to obtain technical support and you may find it useful to make a note of it
here:

INSTALLATION ON HARD DISK
-------------------------

After  you have booted your Amiga from hard disk, insert your backup of the
MaxonMagic  program  disk  into  df0:  and start the program Install-MM-HD.
The  installation  is  done with Commodore's installer program; just follow
the  instructions that appear.  At any time during the installation you can
obtain assistance by selecting the help gadget.

Once the installation program is running, the first thing you must do is to
enter the name of the directory to which MaxonMagic will be copied.  Please
note  that  the installer does not create the directory itself!  Select the
Make  new  drawer  gadget,  type in the directory's name (e.g.  MMAGIC) and
select Proceed.

Before  the  screen-saver  effects  can  be  installed you have to tell the
installer  which  Amiga hardware you are working with.  If you own an Amiga
without  a  graphics  board,  select OCS/ ECS/AA, otherwise choose Graphics
board.

After  this  is  done  you can choose which screen- saver modules are to be
installed.  You can select each screen saver by clicking on its check mark.
Then  click  on  Proceed  and  the selected modules are copied to your hard
disk.

If  you  would like to have all effects installed select all.  In this case
you  must  decide  yourself  which  effects  are suitable for use with your
hardware - the use of some of them with certain hardware configurations can
lead to bizarre results.

Now  the  rct.library is copied to the LIBS:  directory if it isn't already
there.   Afterwards the command PlayHSN (see Chapter 5) is copied to the C:
directory and the samples from the two sample disks are also copied.

Finally   you   can  choose  if  you  wish  to  have  MaxonMagic  activated
automatically  after  booting your Amiga.  If you select yes a command line
is inserted in s:user-startup or s:startup-sequence.

The   installation   is  now  finished.   Reboot  your  Amiga  to  activate
MaxonMagic.

The nominated directory should include the following files or directories:

MaxonMagic      the main program
MM_Prefs        the preferences file
MM_Effects      directory with screen-saver modules
MM_Sounds       directory with samples
MM_SModuls      directory with FTM-songs.

INSTALLATION ON FLOPPY DISK
---------------------------

For  floppy  disk installation it is best to have at least two disk drives.
If  you  just  have one drive you will need to copy the parts of MaxonMagic
you  want  to  use onto a Workbench disk that you have previously prepared.
But  even  with  only  one  disk  drive  You  can  have  a complete look at
MaxonMagic; just boot from your backup of the first MaxonMagic disk.

After  you  have  booted from a Workbench disk, insert the first MaxonMagic
disk  in  your  second  disk  drive.  Open its window and start the program
Install-MM-disk.  Just follow the instructions of the installer.

The  installation  is  very similar to the hard disk installation described
above.   Instead  of  the  directory  you have to enter the name of a blank
formatted  disk  to which MaxonMagic will be copied.  The samples contained
on  the  sample-  disks  are  not  installed,  instead a short selection of
samples  are  copied.   You  can  also  choose  to  have MaxonMagic started
automatically,  in  which  case the s:user-startup or s:startup-sequence of
your Workbench disk is changed.

Every  time  you  boot from this disk you will have to insert the installed
MaxonMagic disk in your second disk drive.

NOTE
----

If  you  would like to start MaxonMagic from a directory other than the one
in  which  the directories MM_effects and MM_Samples are installed you have
to  tell  MaxonMagic  where  to  find the screen-savers and samples.  To do
this,  simply  click on the MaxonMagic icon and select Information from the
Workbench  Menu  Add  the  path  which  leads  to  the  directories  to the
Tool-Types:  e.g.

PATH = "WORK : MaxonMagic"

Don't forget to enter the keyword PATH!

If  you  would  like  to start MaxonMagic from the CLI or Shell you have to
make sure that the directories MM_Effects and MM_Samples are located within
the same outer directory.

THE MAIN WINDOW
---------------

After  MaxonMagic  has  been  executed, press the keys Shift-F1 to open the
main window of MaxonMagic.

This window allows access to all necessary settings and commands.

THE OPTIONS
-----------

Within  the main window, there are three gadgets Global, Hotkey and Modul ;
these  let  you  switch  between, and gain access to, the different program
settings, which are described below.

When  you  click  on one of these gadgets, the display beneath them changes
appropriately.

As their names suggest, Global settings affect all modules, Hotkey lets you
choose  MaxonMagic's  "start"  key,  and Modul allows customisation of each
screen-saver.

GLOBAL SETTINGS
---------------

TIME
This  slider  lets  you adjust the time after which the chosen screen saver
will be activated.  The display to the left of the slider shows the minutes
and  seconds  after  which  the  selected  module  will  start, if no input
(keyboard  or mouse) is made within the defined time.  Every input activity
resets the time counter again.

VOLUME
With this slider you can adjust the volume of samples or FTM-songs.  If set
to 0 the sound is turned off while 64 is the maximum volume.

PRI
Every  task within the Amiga's multi-tasking system gets a certain priority
which  defines  how  much CPD-time it is allowed.  The higher the priority,
the  more CPU-time the task gets.  This slider lets you adjust the priority
of  MaxonMagic.   If you feel MaxonMagic is slowing down other programs too
much just set a lower priority.  In general, this shouldn't be necessary.

MOUSE 
MaxonMagic has a built-in mouse accelerator.  You can set a speedup rate of
between 0.25 and 4.00, so you can even slow down the mouse.

CPU IDLE
If  you  are  working  with  programs  that  have  a  high  CPU_usage  like
raytracers, an active screen blanker which also has a high CPU_usage may be
disturbing.   This  slider  lets you adjust at which level of CPU usage the
blanker  will not be activated.  The display shows CPU-time in percent; 40%
means that the saver is started if the CPU is working at 60% or less.  If a
screen- saver isn't installed the screen will still turn black, which takes
no CPU-time at all.

HOTKEYS
-------

Selecting Hotkey will bring up this requester:

HOTKEYS START
Choose  the key combination which opens the main window.  Every key has its
own name.  The default key is set to SHIFT-F1.

The following table shows the name of all qualifiers and keys.

You  can combine any qualifiers you like, but you can only use one key.  Be
sure not to use the following combination:

CONTROL LCOMMAND RCOMMAND!!

NOTE
Under  AmigaDOS  2.O or higher you can also use the program Exchange (found
in your Workbench) to activate, de-activate or remove MaxonMagic.  Also you
can open MaxonMagic with the Tools menu of the workbench.

HOTKEY EFFECT
In this box you can enter the hotkey which will activate the current screen
saver module.  Do this as described above.  The default is SHIFT- F2:

MOUSE IN CORNER
Another  way  of  activating  a  module  is to place the mouse pointer in a
certain  corner  of  the screen.  This cycle gadget lets you choose between
the  four corners or none.  If you move the mouse pointer into the selected
corner the module is started after a short time.

MODULE OPTIONS
--------------

This  part  of  the main window of MaxonMagic (the Module button) brings up
the settings for the installed screen-saver module.

See  a  particular  module's description for more details of which settings
can  be  found, and altered, here.  If a module's settings are accessed via
this  button,  we  will  show  this  by  the words via Module button in the
Settings  title.   Some  settings are available from within the demo mode -
via Demo mode indicates this.

LOADING A SCREEN SAVER
----------------------

You  can select any of the available modules by clicking on its name in the
Effects window.  The name of the selected module is shown below this window
if  the module has been loaded correctly.  You can also use the cursor keys
and Return to choose.

AUDIO AND EFFECT SWITCHES
-------------------------

In the top right corner of the main window are two switches which allow you
to switch the saver and the audio on or off.

THE DEMO GADGET
---------------

Every  screen-saver  can be played in demo mode by clicking on this gadget.
Some  modules  offer  additional settings in this mode - this will be shown
against  the  Settings  title  for  each  saver by the words via Demo Mode.
Normally  you  leave  the Demo mode by clicking on the OK button - if there
isn't one in a particular demo, just left-mouse click to exit.

THE OK GADGET
-------------
 
Clicking on this gadget closes the main window and activates all settings.

THE SAVE GADGET
---------------

This  gadget  saves all current settings of the main program and the chosen
screen-saver to disk.  The settings are stored in a file called MM_Prefs.

THE QUIT GADGET
---------------

MaxonMagic  is de-activated and removed from memory.  Its effects will also
be turned off.

THE CANCEL GADGET
-----------------

This gadget closes the main window and leaves MaxonMagic active.  The close
gadget of the main window has the same function.

THE INFO GADGET
---------------

The MaxonMagic logo at the top of the window is also a gadget.  Click on it
to  brings  up  information  about  the program version, the author and the
copyright status of MaxonMagic.

THE CLOSE GADGET
----------------

This gadget duplicates the Cancel button.

THE SCREEN SAVER MODULES
------------------------

Every  screen  saver has been programmed as a module which is loaded by the
main  program.   All  modules  are placed in the directory MM_Effects.  The
filename  of the module itself ends with .mod, the filename of the module's
settings ends with .mpf

As  described  already, every saver can also play a sample or FTM-Song when
runing.   Almost  every module has two string gadgets in the module options
for  selecting a sample or a song.  The song is played prior to the sample.
The gadgets to the left of the string gadgets open the file requester which
lets  you  select  the  files  easily.   Samples  are  placed in the drawer
MM_Samples  and  should  have an extension of snd, FTM Songs in MM_SModules
end in ftm.

FTM-Songs have been composed with the program Face The Music and are played
with  up  to  eight channels.  Please note that these songs use substantial
CPU-time.   We  do not recommend the use of these songs on a standard Amiga
with a 68000-CPU.

NOTE
----

Some modules may not run on your Amiga.  If you installed the screen savers
with  the  installer  you  should  already  have the right modules for your
system.

If  you  have  an  Amiga  with an AA chipset (A1200, A4000) and a multisync
monitor  you  have to be sure that your monitor supports a 15kHz horizontal
frequency to use savers like Aquarium and Blanctris.

If  you  are  using  a graphics board you can only use the savers marked as
usable  with  such  boards.   Your  board must offer a Workbench emulation.
Also  we  cannot  guarantee that all marked modules run on your board since
there are many different ways to implement a graphics board.

Some screen savers may require at least AmigaDOS 2.O.

AQUARIUM
--------

Control the fish in your aquarium - but watch out for the fishing line.

This  effect  brings  up  a real aquarium with lots of fish on your screen.
From  time  to  time  a  fishing  line  appears  and  catches  a fish.  The
background  graphic  (stones  and plants) is moved every now and then.  The
demo mode is exited by pressing the left mouse button.

Settings                                              via Module button

Breakfast bites back - but wheres the toasters?

You  always  wanted to see a complete breakfast flying across your computer
monitor,  didn't  you?   No problem, this module makes it happen.  There is
everything  belonging  to  a real breakfast:  toast, cups of tea or coffee,
eggs,  marmalade  and  of  course  an  alarm  clock  so you won't miss your
breakfast!

This  module  has two setting points, one in the Module options and another
in  the  Demo  mode  In the former you can only change the number of flying
objects (from 0 to 39).

In Demo mode you have more choices:

In  the demo mode you can change the parameters that directly influence the
look  of the module.  At the left hand edge all available display modes are
listed.   The  module  can have its own screen resolution (independent from
your Workbench resolution).

In  the  middle  of  the  window  there are the color controls for all four
colours.   Above  them  there is the Use button; click it and your settings
will  become effective.  Next, on the right, there is a kind of preview for
the objects; you can toggle between them by clicking on the cycle gadget in
the lower right corner.

PASSWORD
--------

Protect your computer from prying eyes with this control panel.

This  module is nearly the same as the messages module.  So you can type in
some short reports.

But  here  the possibility of protecting your computer from unwanted access
is  added.  Once the module has become active it only can be interrupted by
typing  in  the  correct  password.   The  input  of the password has to be
confirmed with Return.

All the other keyboard sequences are the same as in the Messages module.

STARS
-----

A must for all Astronomers - sit back and watch the stars go by.

Stars  generates an animated starry sky that seems to move to the observer.
Alternatively,  horizontal  moving  stars  are  possible.   There  are  two
versions of this module:

Stars  ECS  only  runs  on  OCS/ECS  machines Starsruns on AA computers and
Amigas with graphic controllers, too.

Settings                                                via Demo mode
Mode                   2D or 3D for different effects.
Number                 Determines the number of stars.
Speed                  This slider controls the speed of the stars.
Move                   Controls the movement of the stars - the effect
                       depends on the mode:
3D Mode                left -  the stars will rotate counter-clockwise,
                       right - the stars rotate clockwise,
                       none  - no rotation.
2D Mode                left -  the stars move from right to left,
                       right - the stars move from left to right.

THE AUDIO MENU
--------------

OVERVIEW
Did  you  ever  fancy  the  sound of Big Ben in your sitting-room, striking
midnight?   Or  maybe  you  miss  the  sharp, clack clack sound of that old
typewriter?   Or  do  you  want  to hear a little melody when starting your
favourite program?

No problem, you've got MaxonMagic!

In  the  main  MaxonMagic window you click on the gadget labelled Audio.  A
new window appears:

This  is  the  control  window where you assign sampled sounds to different
events.   At  the  left  you  choose  the  event, to which a sound is to be
assigned.   You  can move through the list of events with the scroll bar or
the scroll arrows at the right side.

On  the  right  side  in the control window you see a list of the available
samples.   To be precise, you will only see files with the extension ".SND"
and  all  drawers  of  the  MM_Sounds directory.  Drawers are marked with a
leading  double  arrow.   As  in the event list you can move through a long
list here with a scroll bar or scroll arrows at the right side.

To  assign a sound to an event first left-click on the event and then right
click on the chosen sample.  In front of the event's name there will appear
either an up-arrow or a check-mark (see below).

If  you  have  clicked  on a drawer containing some samples instead of on a
single  sound file, MaxonMagic will randomly play one of these samples when
the event occurs.  So it can happen when you first press the Return key you
will  hear  a  submissive "Your wish is my command".  The next time perhaps
you  may  listen to a grumbling "Leave me alone" ...  or a phaser disrupter
blast.

If  you  are  a prolific writer you will soon get mad when hearing over and
over  again "You pressed my return key again my dear".  A single sample can
be  switched  off  and  on again- with a click on the On button beneath the
sample list.  The status of a single event can be seen by a symbol in front
of  the events name; if the sound for the event is turned on, a little bell
will appear.

Next  to  the  on-and-off-switch  on  the right you can choose from where a
sample  shall  be loaded when needed.  You can switch between Disk and RAM.
If  you have chosen RAM, all those marked samples will first be loaded into
memory  when MaxonMagic is started.  There they stay all the time until you
leave MaxonMagic.

A  click on the gadget toggles to Disk.  This means that the sample will be
loaded from disk every time the event occurs.

To  be able to differentiate between the two options immediately there is a
second  symbol  in  front  of  the event's name - either an up arrow if the
sample  will be "up"-loaded from disk or a check mark, if it will be played
out of memory.

If you assign samples to keys or to the events open windouw or close window
(i.e.   events that occur often) it is better to load the samples into RAM.
Rarer  events  (for  example the start of a program) are better loaded from
disk (preferably hard disk).

If  your computer has limited chip RAM you should use this method too.  But
if you have not got a hard disk and use MaxonMagic from disk, after a while
you  won't  need a sampled groan, when requested to insert the samples disk
ten times in two minutes!

EVERYONE CAN MAINTAIN ORDER (ONLY A GENIUS RULES CHAOS)
------------------------------------------------------

With  your  new sound sampler (such as Megalosound!) you have recorded your
grandmother's  old  cupboard  door and a frog's song in the late afternoon.
The  cupboard  sound  is assigned to the event open window, the frog to the
ASL file requestor.  Now from your word processing program you want to load
a previously written letter.  The program uses the ASL file requester.  The
ASL  window opens and greets you with a wonderful "quaaaak" .  On the other
hand a window was opened.

So "squiiiek" or "quaaak"? 

Yes,  that's  right.  You can decide what will happen; below the event list
is a cycle gadget.

Next  sample  waits  means, that the first sample will be played completely
and  then the second (also completely).  In our example that means that you
will first get a frog's concert and then a door screaming for oil.

A  mouse click on the gadget leads us to Next sample cancels.  In this case
the  second  event cancels the first at its occurrence.  So when the window
opens  you  will  hear "QuaSquiiiiek" (the frog sharp but painless and then
the old oak chest).

Oh,  you  preferred to hear the frog concert (open file requester) than the
screaming  door  (open  window)?   Another  mouse click on the cycle gadget
shows  Ignore  next  sample.  If there is a second event before the first's
sample has finished, the second will not be played at all.

NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE
---------------------

Now  you  perhaps want to know to which events you can assign samples.  Use
the  five  buttons  at  the lower border of the audio window.  According to
your choice the event list on the left hand changes.

ACTIONS
-------

The  following  table  gives  all  possibilities  and  when the events will
happen:

ALERT
The alert used when the system crashes.

ASLReq
A  program  opens  a  file  or  font  requester window with the help of the
system's asl.library.

AutoReq
The operating system opens a message window.

Close Screen
A screen is closed

Close Window
A window is closed.

Disk
A  disk  (also  a  removable  cartridge) is inserted or removed from a disk
drive.

Left Button
Pressing the left mouse button.

Open Screen
Opening a screen.

Open Window
Opening a window.

Right Button
Pressing the right mouse button

KEYS
----

All  in  all you can assign samples to 11 different keys or key areas.  The
sample  sounds  when  the  corresponding  key  on  the keyboard is pressed.
Though  the  samples  can  be  uploaded from disk it is better to move them
permanently  to RAM.  By doing this there won't be disk activity every time
you press a key.

PROGRAM
-------

After clicking on this button you will see an empty event list.  MaxonMagic
cannot know which are your preferred programs.

Click  on the symbol to the left of the string gadget below the event list.
A  file  requester  will  be  opened from where you can choose programs.  A
click on the file requester's Load button forces the program name to appear
in the event list.  Now a sample can be assigned to this program.

TEXT
----

As  with the program event you will see an empty list here.  Enter any word
into  the  string gadget.  After pressing Return this word will be put into
the event list.  Now, every time this word appears somewhere on screen, the
assigned sample will be played.

A click on the "N" (for "new") to the left of the string gadget cancels the
actual entry and clears the field for another entry.

Let's have an example:  Assign the word "work" to whatever sample you like.
Now,  click on a free space of your workbench.  The sample is played.  Why?
Well,  take  a look at the headline of the workbench screen.  There you can
read  "Amiga  Workbench ..." You see, it's enough to enter just a part of a
longer  word  to  get  the sample played.  MaxonMagic is not case sensitive
i.e.  instead of "work' you also could have typed "WORK" or "wOrK".

Now you are able to assign samples to nearly every operating system output.
All  you  need is a little bit of fantasy.  The more assignments you do the
more varied and personal your computer becomes.

It is useful to assign samples to words like "error" or "software failure".
The  first  appears  in  many  programs  when  an error occurs, the last is
included  in  the system error information.  We recommend that you create a
directory  and  assign  this  directory  to  the  two words.  Then you copy
matching  samples  into this drawer, e.g.  something like "shields failing,
captain" , "I'm afraid, I can't do that" , the Beatles' "Help" or the death
melody from "Once upon a time in the west"

Keep  an  eye  on  the  contents  of  your  drawers so that they fit to the
assigned  events.   Only then will the audio part of MaxonMagic really make
sense  and  you will see your computer as a somewhat intelligent life form.
Maybe someday not only will your Amiga talk to you but you will talk to it.

TIME
----

In  the  list  you  can  assign  a  sample to sound on any particular hour.
Beyond  this  there are more entries at the end of the list.  There you can
choose  events  that  appear  every "quarter past" (1/4), every "half past"
(1/2), every quarter to (3/4) or every hour.

For  example  you  can  choose Big Ben every hour, but at 10pm (22:00) your
son,  who  is  busy  playing the latest monster game, will be advised "It's
pillow time, young man".

AUDIO SAMPLE FORMAT
-------------------

MaxonMagic's  .HSN  sound  files  are  only  compatible with the MaxonMagic
program.   This  does  not  mean  that you are limited only to the supplied
samples;  MaxonMagic  also  supports  .SND  files, standard Amiga IFF sound
samples  -  such  as  those  created  by the popular sound sampling package
Megalosound.

To  use  an  IFF sample with MaxonMagic, simply rename the sample to have a
.SND  extension and copy it to your MaxonMagic sound drawer The sample will
then appear in the list of available samples

PLAYHSN
-------

As mentioned before, MaxonMagic uses standard IFF samples beneath so called
HSN  samples.  The HSN file format is used by the program CrazySounds which
is available for Atari and Windows computers.

The  advantage  of  this  format  is  that the samples can be moved between
different  computer systems without changing the file format.  But there is
a  disadvantage that we will not hold back from you:  on the Amiga platform
there is no program that understands this file format!

But  do  not panic, we thought about that and will give you a small program
called  "PlayHSN".   With this program you can play all the HSN sounds from
our  disks.  "PlayHSN" is a CLI command and has to be called out of a shell
in the following manner:

1> PlayHSN <sample>

<sample>  is  the  sample's  name  with  its path (if it is not the current
directory).

There  are  many  directory  tools, using which a button can be assigned to
this  command.   For  that  please  refer  to  the manual of your preferred
directory tool.

NOTICE
------

All  HSN  sounds  on  our  disks  have icons Double clicking on them causes
"PlayHSN" (as the default tool) to play the relevant sample.
