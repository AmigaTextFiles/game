1. ABOUT THIS MANUAL....
------------------------

This manual is divided into the following sections:

GETTING STARTED:
----------------
This  section  outlines the steps needed to back up Professional Page, what
you  need  to use it, and how to start up the progrann.  It also includes a
list of conventions used in this manual.

INTRODUCTION:
-------------
This  section  explains  the  fundamental  concepts  behind  the  design of
Professional Page

TUTORIAL:
---------
This  section  takes  you  through  the  production  of  a  simple two page
newsletter, from importing the various elements, editing them, and creating
new  ones,  to  getting  the final output.  When you complete the tutorial,
which we strongly suggest even for seasoned computer users, you should have
a  good  "feel" for the progran, and be able to go straight to work without
referring too much to the manual.

USING PROFESIONAL PAGE:
-----------------------
This section is the heart of the manual.  It describes all aspects of using
and manipulating boxes from importing text and graphics to final output.

COLOR:
------
This  section outlines the steps necessary to include and maintain color in
Professional  Page  documents.   The color information will be used by Gold
Disk's  Professional  Color  separator to produce four color and mechanical
separatAons.

DESIGN:
-------
This  section  discusses  typographical and layout considerations.  General
rules  for  successful page layout are outlined, as well as a discussion of
what to avoid.

TECHNICAL REFERENCE:
--------------------
Refer  to this section for explanations on specifc features in Professional
Page.

In  addition  to  these  sections,  we  also  provide  a  complete  set  ot
appendices.  Of particular interest are:  the technical support information
appendix,  the  troubleshooting  guide,  and  an  appendix  how to best use
Professional  Page with other Amiga software.  There is also a glossary and
comprehensive index at the end of the manual.

UPGRADES:
---------
There  will  be  constant improvements in the Professional Page system, and
information about additions, revisions and other developlents will be vital
to  allow  you  to  make best use of the product.  Please fill out and mail
your  registration  card without delay, so that we can keep you up to date.
Also, there is a bug/suggestion form at the very end of the manual.

In  the Professional Page window, there is a Read_Me icon.  Double clicking
on  this  icon will display notes of interest about your particular release
of Professional Page.

2. GETTING STARTED...
---------------------

Support Infomation.)

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
-------------------

Computer:
---------
Professional Page is designed to work on any properly configured Amiga 500,
1000, or 2000.

Operating System:
-----------------

Kickstart 1.2 or higher. Workbench 1.2 or higher.

Memory Requirements:
--------------------
A  minimum of one megabyte of memory is required.  If you have an Amiga 500
or  1000  with  only  512K  or RAM, for example, Professional Page will not
load.   For  large  complicated  documents,  especially  those usig lots of
bitapped graphics, more than one megabyte of memory is recommended.

Display Monitor:
----------------
Any  Amiga compatible monitor.  Since Professional Page uses the interlaced
high   resolution  mode  (which  produces  an  annoying  flicker),  a  high
persistence   monitor  is  ideal.   Flicker  reducing  tinted  screens  are
available  for  standard  Amiga  monitors  at  a nominal cost (see Appendix
G:Using Professional Page with Other Amiga Products.)

Disk Drives:
------------
One  Amige  3.5" floppy disk drive is required.  A dual drive or hard drive
configuration is recommended.

Output Device:
--------------
Professional Page outputs to PostScript compatible printers and typesetters
(see Appendix D:  Connecting Your Amiga to a Printer.)

Disk Contents:
--------------
There  are  two disks contained in the Professional Page package.  One disk
is  labelled  "Program".   It contains the actual Professional Page program
and all of ahe data that the program uses.

The  other  disk is labelled "Fonts and Utilities".  This disk includes all
of  the  files  used  in  the  Tutorial section plus all of the sample page
layouts  used  in  the  Design  section.   You  will  also  find samples of
bit-mapped  graphics  and structured drawings.  In addition, there are some
grids or page templates for your use.  These templates are examples of some
common  design  fomats  for  different  types  of documents.  The disk also
contains  special  Professional  Page screen fonts.  These fonts are in the
standard  Amiga  format,  and are specially designed to show on screen what
the  actual  laser printer or typesetting machine output will look like.  A
utility  called MakeFont is also included.  It will allow you to create any
point size of any font included on the disk.  (See Appendix C:Utilities for
a complete list of the utilities and their uses.)

CONVENTIONS USED IN THIS MANUAL
-------------------------------

The  Professional Page manual and the software it describes conform closely
to  many  of  the  standard Amiga conventions.  It is assumed that you have
some familiarity with basic Amiga procedures.  To help novices in the early
stages,  some basic procedures are descnbed in detail even if that may seem
redundant  to  experienced  Amiga  users.   Some  of  the basic conventions
adhered to throughout the manual are:

*  The  use  of  "bullets"  (*)  to  indicate related information, lists or
sequences.

*  Use of the Amiga hierarchy of terms for pull down menus.  Main menus are
called  "menus", sub-menus are called "items", and options of sub-menus are
called "sub-items".  The terms "gadgets" and "tools" are also used.

*  Menu  selections  are  often  listed  in  this  manual using the format:
Menu/Item/Sub-Item.   For example, Page/Alter/Current refers to the Current
sub-item in the Alter item of the page menu.

*  Where  keyboard  equivalents  are  found, the following notation is used
(where "x" is a specified character):

A x - Depress x while holding the Right Amiga key.

C X - Depress x while holding the CTRL key.

a x - Depress x while holding the ATL key.

s X - Depress x while holding the SHIFT key.

*   All  manual  references  to  Professional  Page  screen  menus,  items,
sub-items, gadgets and tools are in italics.

*  Moving  the  mouse  pointer  to a desired location and pressing the left
button to make a selection is called "clicking" or "selecting".

*  Moving  the mouse pointer to a desired location, pressing the button and
holding  it  down  so  as  to  move  some  screen  object is referred to as
"dragging".

*  Keyboard  equivalents  are  graphically  depicted in dhe pictures of the
pull-down menus.

* Text in BOLD type is used to highlight important information.

* The COURIER font indicates text that you should type in via the CLI or in
the text line of a requester.

Many  of the terms used in this manual come from the publishing field, such
as pica and leading, or are Amiga specific, such as menus and gadgets.  For
a complete explanation of these terms, consult the Glossary.

MAKING A WORKING COPY OF PROFESSIONAL PAGE
------------------------------------------

You  should  not  use  the  original  disks  which  you  received  with the
Professional  Page  package  other  than  to make working copies from them.
Instead, immediately make a backup copy of each disk to use as your working
disks.   Put  the original program disks away in a safe place, and only use
them  to  make replacements if your backup copies are lost or damaged.  For
your  convenience, Professional Page is not copy-protected.  Please respect
the  fact  that Gold Disk Inc.  has made it easy for you to make backups of
this program.  Don't sell, lend, give, or otherwise distribute this program
to  anyone.   Please  read  the Program Licence agreement and the copyright
information relating to unauthorized copying.  Remember, software piracy is
a  crime,  and  it  discourages the development, improvement, and technical
support of good software.

Making a Backup
---------------

(See  "Duplicating  Your  Disks"  and  "Copying  a Disk" in your Amiga user
manual).

It  is  easier  and  quicker to make a copy using the CLI, but a novice may
want to use the mouse and the icons in Workbench.  Using Workbench is a bit
slower  and  more  cumbersonae  than using CLI, but it's more intuitive and
less intimidating for a new Amiga user.

From CLI (Command Line Interface--the AmigaDOS):
------------------------------------------------

*  Use  the Amiga Workbench disk, your Professional Page program disk, (the
"source"  disk)  and a blank 3.5" disk (the "destination" disk) on which to
make your copy.

* Boot up with the Workbench disk.

* Open up the CLI as described in your Amiga manual and type:

    DISKCOPY DFO: TO DFl:

*  The  Amiga  will  request that you insed the "source", and "destination"
disks into the appropriate drives.

*  Place  the Professional Page program disk in the first drive, (DF0:) and
be certain that the disk is write protected.

*  Place  your blank disk into the second drive, DFl:, and press the RETURN
key.  Your Professional Page disk will now be duplicated.  l"dl lleG

*  To  copy the Fonts and Utilities disk, repeat the above steps, using the
Fonts and Utilities disk as the "Source" disk.

From the Workbench:
-------------------

*  Boot  up  with  the Workbench disk that came with your Amiga.  Place the
Professional  Page  program disk in the first dnve, and a blank disk in the
second dnve.  Be certain that the program disk is write-protected.

*  Move the mouse pointer over to the icon of the Professional Page program
disk  and  "grab"  the  icon  by  pressing  and holding down the left mouse
button.

* Still holding down the left mouse button, move the Professional Page icon
over on top of disk icon for the blank disk, and release the button.

* The Amiga will provide the necessary instructions to complete the backup.

* After the disk copy is finished, you must rename the copy of Professional
Page.   To  do  this,  select  the backup disk by clicking on its icon, and
activate  the  Rename  item  from  the Workbench menu, as described in your
Amiga manual.

*  The  backup  disk  will  have automatically been given the name "Copy of
PPage".  Rename the disk "PPage".  Similarly, when you make a backup of the
utilities disk, rename it "PPageUtil".

WARNING:  NEVER REMOVE A DISK FROM ANY DISK DRIVE WHILE A DISK LIGHT IS ON!

If  you  do,  you  may destroy the infomnation on the disk.  Until you have
made  a  backup  of  your Professional Page program and utilities disks, be
extremely cautious.

STARTING PROFESSIONAL PAGE
--------------------------

From the Workbench:
-------------------

*  Insert the Professional Page program disk "PPoge", in the lirst dnve and
boot the system.

*  Double  click  on  the  Professional  Page  disk  icon  to  bring up the
Professional Page window.

* Double click on the Professional Page program icon to start the program.

From the CLI:
-------------

*  Insert  the  Professional  Page  disk  in  the  second drive, while your
workbench disk is in the first dnve.  Open up the CLI, as described in your
Amiga manual.  Change directories by typing:

    CD DF1 : and press the RETURN key.

* Assign the special Professional Page fonts by typing:

          ASSIGN FONTS: PPageutil:FONTS and press the RETURN key.

* When the prornpt reappears, run the Professional Page program by typing:

    PPAGE:PPAGE

3. INTRODUCTION....
-------------------

Professional  Page  is  a  powerful,  versatile  and simple to use "desktop
publishing"  program.   It is page-oriented, rather than document-oriented.
This means that the intention of the program is to allow the user to create
pages  one by one, with the maximum of flexibility to make design decisions
at  every  stage.   A  document-oriented  program  is more suited for long,
relatively uniform documents.

It  is  quite feasible to create long documents such as books and magazines
using  Professional  Page,  (such  as  this  manual), but Professional Page
excels  in  situations  where varied layouts with extensive use of graphics
are   typical   (for  example,  newsletters,  ad  designs,  brochures,  and
educational materials).

If  you  do  wish  to  create  a  longer  doccument,  Professional Page has
procedures  for formatting or coding text at the word processing stage (see
Appendix F:  Formatting Text), and powerful template features which make it
very  productive  while still keeping page makeup very interactive and open
to changes.

ABOUT DESKTOP PUBLISHING
------------------------

Although  electronic  /  computer-aided publishing has been around for some
time,  the technique has required expensive equipment and specially trained
operators,  similar  to more traditional forms of publishing.  With desktop
publishing  you  can  perform  the functions of graphic designers, writers,
editors,  layout people and typographers yourself.  This not only saves you
money,  but  drastically  reduces  the  turnaround time needed to prepare a
professional quality document.

The  phrase  "desktop  publishing" is often used in a rather misleadng way.
Logically, the publishing process includes all "pre-press" operations, from
writing  and  editing to page assembly and platemaking.  Desktop publishing
programs,  though,  are  more accurately described as "typesetting and page
assembly" programs.  Professional Page allows the user to integrate all the
stages  of  publishing  on  a  personal computer, even though many of those
stages involve other software products.

The  text  and  graphic components of a document can be gathered from their
various  sources  (word  processors,  scanners,  paint  programs, etc.) and
assembled  into  a  complete document, and then output in camera ready form
from a laser printer or typesetting machine.  With Gold Disk's Professional
Color  separator  (sold separately), pages can be output as screened, color
separated  film,  ready for platemaking and printing.  Despite its relative
simplicity  and  economy,  typesetting  and  page  assembly  with a desktop
publishing  systen,  is  still  a  skilled process.  To create professional
quality  documents,  some  knowledge  of typography and design priciples is
essential.

To  help  the  experienced  designer  relate traditional methods to the new
technology, and to give the novice a workable basic understanding of how to
create  attractive  and readable pages, refer to the Design section of this
manual.

In the same way that microcomputers unleashed computing to a mass audience,
desktop  publishing has offered access to publishing tools to a larger base
of  users  through  personal  computers  and  laser  printers.  As the term
suggests,  it  is  possible  to fit all the necessary equipment for desktop
publishing on a desk and with it to produce near-typeset quality documents.

In  its  fullest  sense, publishing involves more than just typesetting and
page  make  up,  though.   Writing, editing, photography, illustration, and
many  other  processes  are  involved.   Professional  Page  allows  you to
integrate the pre-press stages of publishing on your Amiga.

DESKTOP PUBLISHING VS. WORD PROCESSING
--------------------------------------

Desktop  publishing  is  often  confused  with a sophisticated form of word
processing.   It  is true that a desktop publishing system performs many of
the  same  functions  as a word processor.  More than that however, desktop
publishing  is  a  process  for laying out pages and this often requires as
much manipulation of graphics as of text.  Even with traditional electronic
typesetting,  word  processors  are used as a front-end to prepare copy for
page  layout.  Similarly word processors are often used to create the first
draft of text for a desktop publishing system.  It is important, therefore,
that the system can import text from many different word processors.

Professional  Page has a full featured word processor.  For short projects,
it  is  preferable to create copy from within the desktop publishing systen
to  eliminate  the  extra steps of importing the text; but if more than one
person  is preparing the copy it is more practical to prepare the text on a
word  processor  because  only  one page layout can be worked on at a time.
The features that you require for your project will also affect whether you
use  Professional  Page's  word  processor  or  a  separate word processing
package.

ABOUT PROFESSIONAL PAGE
-----------------------

Professional  Page  is  designed  for  professional  quality  page  layout.
Included  is  a  full set of typographic controls for manipulating text and
halftoning  bitmapped  graphics to take full advantage of the resolution of
PostScript    output    devices.    We   understand   the   importance   of
What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get,  and  have  all  the  tools  for  editing and
creating both text and structured graphics available right where you layout
the  page.   There  are  also  numerous  other  advanced  features such as:
automatic  hyphenation,  kerning, wrapping text around boxes, and retention
of  full-color  information  for  four color separation.  Professional Page
will prove to be a powerful yet intuitive tool for page layouts.

SAVING PROFESSIONAL PAGE DOCUMENTS
----------------------------------

If there is one point that should be stressed when using Professional Page,
or  any  software  product for that matter, it is that you should save your
work  often.   This  "insurance" will pay for itself the first time you run
into  any difficulty.  For example, saving a document before a major layout
change will give you the option of going back to the original layout at any
time.   Especially  when  you  are  first  learning  to use a computer or a
particular  program,  you could manage to "crash" the system.  Saving files
frequently will make sure you only lose, at worst, a few minutes of work.

Another   important   suggestion   is   to   print  your  documents  often.
Professional  Page  attempts to provide the most accurate representation of
your   page   possible  on  the  Amiga,  but  it  is  still  just  that,  a
representation.  If you have access to a PostScript laser printer where you
can  print  your  document  several  times  during its creation, your final
product  will  take  form  more  quickly,  and more accurately.  It is more
desirable  to  alter  only  one  element on your page at a time rather than
modifying many, which may change the overall design of your document.

COMPATABILITY
-------------

Professional  Page  allows  you  to  import  files from many other software
packages.    Imported   text  from  WordPerfect,  Scribble!   ,  TextCraft,
TextCraft Plus, and many others (in ASCII format).  Graphics can be created
with graphic software such as DeluxePaint II, Aegis Images, and Digi-Paint,
and  from  hardware  peripherals  such  as  the  Easyl  pressure  sensitive
digitizing  tablet  and the Digi-View video digitizer.  Structured graphics
can  be  impoAed  from  Aegis Draw Plus.  Any IFF compatible package can be
used  to  import text or graphics.  (See Appendix G:Using Professional Page
with Other Amiga Products).

4. TUTORIAL...
--------------

The  best way to learn Professional Page is to use it.  As described in the
Introduction  section,  Professional  Page  emphasizes a natural, intuitive
equivalent  to  traditional  design tools and methods.  With some practice,
assisted  by the tutorial and reference information in this manual, you can
learn  to  use  all  the  features of Professional Page for a wide range of
design  Jobs.   In  this tutorial we will create a two page newsletter (see
Appendix H:Newsletter).  In the course of creating the newsletter, you will
use  many of the basic tools of Professional Page, and you'll go a long way
toward becoming comfortable with using the program.

The principles you are introduced to in this tutorial will give you a sense
of how to go about organizing any similar project.  At all times, feel free
to experiment wAth the various commands and functions of Professional Page.

Don't be afraid to experiment.  You can always restart the tutorial and try
again if the situation becomes too confusing.

The tutorial is divided into two basic parts.  The first part shows you how
to use all of the tools and features that you need to make a simple layout.

Once  you  know how to manipulate the basic tools, you can start laying out
the sample newsletter in the second part of the tutorial.

The   tutorial  is  only  a  first  introduction  to  the  capabilities  of
Professional  Page.   Many  specific examples of the program's features are
found  in the Design section of the manual.  Other examples of text, bitmap
graphics  and  structured  drawings  are  also to be found on the Fonts and
Utilities  disk  included  in  the Professional Page package.  These can be
used  to  modify the newsletter example in this tutorial if you wish.  Good
luck!

To run the tutorial, you need:
-----------------------------

* A working copy of the Professional Page Program disk.

* A working copy of the Professional Page Fonts and Utilties Disk.

* A blank, formatted data disk.

*  A  suitable  output  device,  if  available  (preferably a 300 dpi laser
printer).

If you are not already in Professional Page, boot up the Program in the
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
following way:
--------------

*  At  the  Workbench  prompt,  insert  your  copy of the Professional Page
program disk into the internal drive.

* Move the mouse pointer over the PPage disk icon, and double click.

* Double click the Professional Page program icon.

If  the  program  does not completely load, it may be because you only have
512k of memory.  Professional Page is designed to work with one megabyte or
more  of  RAM  (for  information on memory expansions, see Appendix G:Using
Professional Page with Other Amiga Products).

ANATOMY OF THE SCREEN
---------------------

Before  you  begin,  you  should  famliliarize  yourself  with  the various
elements  on  the  screen.   The  Professional Page screen should look like
this:

Professional Page  Gold Disk Document: Untitled

For  a  more  detailed explanation consult the Technical Reference section.
Once  the  Professional  Page  art  board is on the screen, you're ready to
create a page.

CREATING A PAGE
---------------

*  Hold  down  the  right  mouse button, and the menu strip becomes visible
along the top of the Amiga screen.

* Keeping the right mouse button pressed down, move the pointer to the Page
menu  (the  second  menu from the left).  When the pointer touches the word
Page,  a  "pull-down menu" appears.  Still keeping the mouse button pressed
down, move the pointer down to the Create item, presenting two "sub-items",
From  Template  and  From  Default.   Still  keeping the right mouse button
pressed  down,  move  the  pointer  to the From Default subitem and let go.
This procedure is called "selecting a menu".

*  A  "requester  window" appears, showing a number of adjustable settings.
For the moment, use the default settings, which creates a letter-sized page
(8.5"x  11") with no columns.  Click once with the left mouse button on the
OK  gadget  in  the  lower  left hand corner of the requester to create the
page.

A  representation  of the page appears on your art board.  Also, at the top
of  the  gadget strip on the right hand side of the screen, the page number
(page 1, in this case), is displayed.

KEYBOARD COMMANDS
-----------------

The  New  Page  Format  requester that you called up with the mouse and the
pointer  can  be accessed directly with a keyboard equivalent, in this case
(CTRL N).  Call it up again, this time using the keyboard equivalent of the
mouse command.  Hold down the CTRL-key and press the N-key.

The  New  Page  Format requester pops up again.  Click the OK gadget at the
bottom  left  of the requester.  The page number changes to 2 (you now have
two  pages  in  memory  -  see  "Page  Numbers"  in the Technical Reference
section).   Most  of the commonly used features of Professional Page can be
accessed  with  either keyboard or mouse.  The mousepointer/ pull-down menu
system  is  the  simplest  and most natural way to get at Professional Page
features,   especially  for  a  novice.   When  you  become  profient  with
Professional   Page,   especially  if  you're  using  it  in  a  production
environment where speed is important, you will want to make more use of the
keyboard  equivalents.  A full list of keyboard equivalents can be found in
Appendix B:  Keyboard Equivalents and on the Quick Reference Card.

THE NEW PAGE
------------

The  new  page appears on the screen as a white rectangle with rulers along
the  top  and  the  left  side.  By default, the page appears on a standard
Amiga  monitor  screen at 33% of its actual (printed) size, so that you can
see the entire page at one time.

SAVING AND OPENING (LOADING) YOUR DOCUMENTS
-------------------------------------------

Before  you  begin the second part of this tutorial, you should know how to
save and load your documents.  Professional Page loads and saves files in a
manner famliliar to users of other Amiga programs.

Saving a Document
-----------------

Although  this  tutorial  is short, you may not be able to, or not wish to,
finish  it  in  one  session.   You  should  know  how to save your current
document  so that you can continue from where you left off at a later date.
Also,  saving  your  document  where you leR at a later date.  Also, saving
your  document  to  disk  at frequent intervals is a very good habit to get
into.  Especially while you are learning to use Professional Page, you will
want   to  protect  your  work  from  destructive  features  that  you  may
accidentally  invoke, such as the power OFF switch.  Even as an expert, you
are still capable of makLng mistakes, and will be subject to acts of God or
the electric company, such as power failures.  Even if you have a hard disk
for  your Amiga, continue to make backups of your documents on floppy disks
as well.

Before  saving  a document, make sure that a formatted data thsk is in your
Amiga,s internal disk drive (DF0:).

Since  we  have  already  created a page, let's demonstrate how to save the
blank  page  as a docunment on disk.  There are two ways to save a document
to thsk.  The first is the use of Save As.

To use Save As:
---------------

* Make sure your data thsk is in the internal drive (DF0:)

* Select the Save As item from the Project menu.

* When the Save Document As requester comes up, click on the DF0: gadget.

*  In  the  File  text  line, type the name for your document, TESTSAVE for
example.

* Click OK to save the document.

For  more  information  on  the  file  requester,  see  Technical Reference
section.   The  name  of the document (visible from the status line) should
change to the name that you specified with the Save As item.

The  second  way  of  saving your document is to select the Save item.  The
Save  item  is  very  convenient  when you are updating a file that you are
working  on.   You  could save modifications to the file frequently without
the hassle of re-entering the same file name information.

WARNING:  the Save item overwrites the previously saved file.

Selecting  Save  causes  your file to be saved immediately to whatever disk
and  directory  was  used in the Save As operation or the default drive and
directory  if  the Save As operation hasn't been used.  If no file name has
previously  been  specified  using the Save As item, Professional Page will
automatically  name  the  document  "Untitled"  and store it in tbe default
directory.

To give the file a name:
------------------------

* Select the Project/Information item.

*  Delete  the  default  file name "Untitled", and type in the name of your
file.

From  now  on, if you make any changes to your document, and wish to update
it  to  disk,  simply  select  the  Save  item,  and Professional Page will
automatically  use  the  given file name, and the previously specified disk
drive and directory.

Loading a Document
------------------

If  you want to load a previously saved file, use the Open command from the
project  menu.   To  demonstrate  this,  clear  the document in memory, and
restore the document that you already saved.

To clear the document in memory:
--------------------------------

* Select the New item from the Project menu.

* A "Warning" requester will appear.

*  Click  Yes,  and  the  page  on  screen will be erased.  The name of the
document will go back to being "Untitled".

To load the previously saved document:
--------------------------------------

* Select the Open itemn from the Project menu.

* A requester similar to the one used in the Save As item will appear.

* Select the disk drive and directory, if necessary.

* Professional Page will give you a list of all of the documents located on
that  disk  (in  this tutorial there will only be one).  Click on your file
with  the  mouse  pointer.  Professional Page will take your selected file,
and transfer the name to the "File:" text line.

* Click the OK gadget to load the file.

NOTE:   the previous two steps can also be achieved by double-clicking with
the left mouse button on the file name.

Professional  Page  will  load that file, and you will see your document on
the  screen.  In this case, you will see the blank page you created earlier
For  more  information  on  the  file  requester,  see  Technical Reference
section.

Now that you know how to save and load liles, we can start on the tutorial,
keeping in mind that you can stop and restart any time you wish.

Once  again,  you should frequently save your document.  It is very easy to
load  a  previously  saved  document,  but  much harder to recreate it from
scratch if something should go wrong.

MAKING AND USING BOXES
----------------------

The  most  important  idea  behind Professional Page is its use of "Boxes".
Once  you  fully  understand  boxes,  you  have grasped the main concept of
Professional Page.  Every object on the page is placed in a box, Whether it
is  text,  structured  drawings, or bitmap graphics.  Boxes can be any size
and, as the name implies, are rectangular in shape.  But a box is more than
just  a  defined  holding  area.  You can change many attributes associated
with  that  box.  For exanaple, a box can have visible frames, or be filled
in  with  a  shade  of  gray,  which can be printed as a halftone screen or
pattern (see "Printing" in the Using Professional Page section).  Boxes can
even  have margins internally for your text to follow (much like a page has
margins).   Boxes  can  serve as windows for your graphics, allowing you to
crop the graphic to any size.

Start  by  experimenting  with creating and manipulating boxes.  For now we
will  just experiment with empty boxes.  We will fill them with text later,
but it helps if you know how to handle them.

To create a new box:
--------------------

*  Click on the Box Create tool frorn the general tools section of the tool
palette (see Tool Palette" in the Technical Reference section).

*  Move  the  mouse to the position on the page where you want the top left
hand  corner  of  the  box to appear (place it anywhere inside the top left
hand page).  For our purposes, the exact position doesn't matter.

* Press the left mouse button and drag the mouse over to the position where
the bottomn right hand corner of your box is to be placed, approximately at
the  7.5" x 3" setting, and release the button.  The outline of a large box
will now be visible.

*  Professional  Page remains in the Box Create mode to allow you to create
more boxes.

Go  ahead  and  experiment  by  placing  a  couple  of  boxes on your page.
Professional  Page  will  remain  in  the  Box Create mode until you select
another tool.

To help you when creating a box, the position of your mouse is always shown
as  a  thin line on the rulers around the page.  Also, the position of your
mouse  in  relation to the top left-hand corner of the page is indicated by
the two coordinate numbers on the menu bar (when you are resizing your box,
the  figures  will change to represent the box dimensions, not its position
on the page).

To  return  to the mode of operation that you were in before activating the
Box  Create tool, click on the Null Pointer tool.  Boxes are displayed with
thin  oulines around them.  These outlines will not print out on your final
page.   They  are  only  a visual guide for you.  You will also notice that
only  one box, the one created last, has a solid outline, while other boxes
have  broken  (dashed)  outlines.  The box with the solid outline is called
the "Active Box".

The Active Box
--------------

The  Active Box is the one that you are currently working on.  To work on a
different  box,  simply  click  in  the desired box, and it will become the
Active Box.

To quickly locate the Active Box:
---------------------------------

* Select the Show Active item in the Box menu.

*  Professional  Page  will  position  the page such that the Active Box is
showing on the screen and flash the outline of your Active Box.

Moving and Resizing a Box
-------------------------

After you have created a box, you can change the position or the size of it
with ease.

To move a box:
-------------

*  Press the left mouse button anywhere in the interior of the box and keep
it  pressed.   The  pointer changes into a hand shape, telling you that the
box is ready to be moved.

*  Drag the box to its new position.  The outline of the box will move with
your  mouse.   The coordinates of the top left corner of the box appears on
the  right  side  of the menu strip, corresponding to the ruler cross hairs
that are visible on the top and left edges of the page.

* Release the mouse button to let go of the box.

Handles
-------

Box  outlines  have  eight  "handles"  (one  on each corner, and one in the
middle  of  each side).  These handles can be grabbed with the Null Pointer
tool, and moved, causing the box to change size and proportion.

To resize a box:
----------------

*  Move  the  pointer  to any of the handles on the box, depending on which
dimensions  you  wish  to change.  For example, if you decide that you want
the  bottom  of  the  box  to drop lower but are satisfed with the left and
right sides, drag with the middle handle on the bottom of the box outline.

*  Move the pointer up or down, causing the box to change size, and release
the button at the desired location.

*  For  precision control of positioning and resizing of boxes, you can use
the  Active  sub-item  of the Alter item in the Box menu (see the Technical
Reference section for details).

Deleting a Box
--------------

Deleting a box is very easy.  First make the box you wish to delete active,
and then select the Delete Active item from the 80K menu.

NOTE:   If  the box that you wish to delete contains any information (text,
graphics,  or  drawings), Professional Page will pop up a warning requester
for a confirmation before deleting the box and its contents.

A CLOSER LOOK
-------------

At  the  default  magnifcation  (33%),  it  would  be  quite  difficult  to
accurately  position  boxes manually, nor could you read any text.  You can
zoom  in  for  a closer look, so that any information that you place in the
box  will  be  readable.   There are five magnification modes available for
your  use.   They are:  25 %, 33%, 50%, 1OO% and 200%.  You can change your
magnification at any time without losing any information.

To change your magnification level to 100%:
-------------------------------------------

*  Select  the  100%  sub-item of the Magnification item in the Preferences
menu.

NOTE:  to the right of every magnification option is a keyboard equivalent.
You  will  find it a lot quicker and easier to use the keyboard equivalents
for changing magnification rather than the mouse (See Appendix B:  Keyboard
Equivalents).

You  will see that the page zooms in and fills the screen, and only a small
part  of  your  page is visible at one time.  The part of your page that is
visible is displayed in the Page Position gadget.  You can move your screen
around to view other parts of the page at this level of magnification.

To move about the page:
-----------------------

* Move the pointer over the Page Position gadget.

*  Drag  the  small  white  rectangle  in  the  Page  Position gadget (this
represents your screen), releasing the button when you have moved it to the
area of the page that you wish to view.

Try  the  other  magnifications.   Experiment, using both the mouse and the
keyboard.   Thus,  to  attain  the  100% magnification level, hold down the
Right  Amiga  Key and depress the "2" key.  For a list of other conventions
used  in  this  manual, consult the Getting Started section.  For a list of
all  keyboard shortcuts, consult Appendix B :  Keyboard Equivalents and the
Quick Reference Card.

From  this  point  on,  you  should  freely use any magnification level you
desire  to perform any of the functions in this tutorial.  The tutonal will
prompt  you  to  set  a  particular  magnification  level  only  when it is
necessary  that  you  be in that level to complete a part of this tutorial.
Otherwise, use your discretion All features of the progran will work in any
given magnification level.

USING THE ART BOARD
-------------------

Essentially,  the  art  board  is  the  Professional  Page  equivalent of a
designer's  drawing  table  or light table.  The art board can be used as a
storage  location  for  boxes that you wish to keep off of the page for one
reason or another.  If you have a very complex page, and wish to reorganize
the  format,  but  maintain  the  boxes  and  their  information,  you  can
temporarily move any, or all of the boxes to the art board.

The  art  board serves as more than just a storage place.  You can actually
create  boxes  directly  on  the  art  board  and  place text, graphics and
drawings in those boxes.  All of the box resizing and manipulating features
work on the art board as well as the page.

Professional  Page  tells  you if you are over the art board, or the actual
page.   If you move a box on the page, the pointer turns into a hand.  When
moving  that  box  off  the  page  and onto the art board, the pointer will
change to thumb tack.

The real power of the art board lies in allowing you to move boxes from one
page  to  another.   Although  the  page will change, the art board and its
contents  remain.   See the Using Professional Page section for more on box
manipulation.

NOTE:   At  100% and 200% magnification levels, you may not see any part of
the  art  board.  This does not, however, prevent you from placing boxes on
the art board.

To place a box on the art at 100% magnification:
------------------------------------------------

* Switch to 1OO% magnification.

* Create a box.

* Grab the box and drag it over the ruler at the page edge.

*  Move  the  hand  pointer to the edge, over the ruler.  At this point the
hand  changes into a thumb tack, and if you place the box on the ruler, the
box is placed off of the page, and onto the art board.

You can confirm this by switching back into the 33% magnification level.

To make the page invisible:
---------------------------

* Select the Visible item from the Page menu again.

The  page and its contents will disappear, leaving only the art board, If a
box  seemed  to disappear when you moved it off the page, it probably "fell
under" the page and becomes visible when the page is made invisible.

To bring the page back:
-----------------------

* Select the Visible item from the Page menu again.

The page will now reappear with all its contents intact.

When  you finally save your document, your art board will be saved with it,
thus  allowing  you  to safely save half finished documents.  Experiment by
creating and manipulating boxes on and off the art board.  Once you realize
how  easy  it is, you will use the art board quite frequently (refer to the
Design section for some examples).

USING THE GRID
--------------

As  you  have  found  out,  it  is  difficult  to position boxes with great
accuracy  using  the  mouse.  You can use a grid to help you position boxes
more  precisely.   In addition to being a visual guide, and unlike grids on
paper  the  grid  in Professional Page can automatically align boxes to the
grid  line  intersections.  The grid lines will not print out on your final
page.  Grid lines can be chosen in several units of measures, Inches, Picas
(for  more  information  on  the  Pica  measurement  consult the Design and
Technical  Reference  sections),  and  Centimeters.  We will use the Inches
unit of measurement for this tutorial.

To set grid spacing:
--------------------

* Select the Layout Tools item in the Preferences menu.

*  You  will  see  that  the  unit  of  measurement  is Inches (the default
setting).  You willl need a grid spacing of 1/2 inch for this tutorial.

* Click on the X:  spacing text line to change the spacing.

* Delete the contents using the backspace and DEL key.

*  Type  in  0.500 and press RETURN.  Do the same with the Y:  spacing text
line.

* Make the grid lines visible by clicking the Grid ON gadget.

*  Turn  on the Snap to Grid to force all future boxes on the page to align
to the grid line intersections.

* Click the OK gadget when you have set the desired options.

Create a box or two to see the effect of using the Snap to Grid item.

GROUPS
------

In  much the same manner as you move one box, you can move several boxes at
one  time,  keeping  their  positions  rela  tive  to each other unchanged.
Grouping allows you to manipulate one or more boxes in many different ways.
As  well  as  having the ability to move several boxes at one time, you can
clone,  delete,  align,  and  center  groups.  You are also free to add and
subtract boxes to and from a group.

Making and Moving Groups
------------------------

To  demonstrate grouping, make sure that you have three or four boxes drawn
close together on your page.

To make a group:
----------------

*  Select  the  Group  tool from the tool palette.  This tool allows you to
select a number of boxes which Professional Page will remember as a group.

*  Drag  an  outline around the boxes you want to group.  Every box that is
completely enclosed by the outline is grouped.

NOTE:  Only one group can be active at a time, and after you have created a
group, the Group tool is cancelled and replaced by the Null Pointer tool.

Before  you selected the group, the active box had a solid grey outline and
the other boxes were outlined witn broken, dotted outlines.

When you select a group, the active box remains as before with a solid grey
outline  but  the  other  boxes in the group are now represented with solid
black outlines.

To move a group:
----------------

*  To  move  the  group (all of the boxes at the same time), hold the SHIFT
key, and grab any box in the group.

* Move the box and the grouped boxes will move together.

*  Release the mouse button when you are satisfied with the position of the
group.

Rearranging Groups
------------------

It  is possible to rearrange the position of boxes from within a group, yet
still keep the group intact.

To change the position of a box from within a group:
----------------------------------------------------

*  Grab the box that you wish to move within the selected group and move it
as if you were to move the box on its own.  Don't use the SHIFT key.

Adding Boxes to a Group
-----------------------

You can add boxes to an established group at any time.

To add a box to the existing group:
----------------------------------

*  Press  the  SHIFT  key, and click on the box that you wish to add to the
group.

*  The  new  box is now a part of the group.  You can verify this by moving
the group.

Removing a Box
--------------

*  To remove a box from the group, use CTRL-select.  Press the CTRL-key and
click on the box that you wish to remove from the group.

Deleting a Group
----------------

*  To delete all boxes in the group (and their contents), select the Delete
item  in the Group menu.  If any of the boxes in the group are not empty, a
warning requester will ask for confirmiation of the action.

CREATING THE NEWSLETTER
-----------------------

For  this  newsletter,  you should start off with a clear page.  Select the
Project/New  item followed by a Page/Create/From Default sub-item.  It's OK
to use the default settings.

Preparing a Masthead
--------------------

Now that you have practiced the basics of creating boxes and activating the
tools necessary to create a layout, you can go on to create the newsletter.

To create a box for the masthead:
--------------------------------

*  Create  a box starting at the 1" x 1 " ruler setting.  You don't have to
position  it  exactly at the grid intersections.  Remember, we have Snap to
Grid enabled so the box will automatically place itself at exactly the 1" x
1" location and make the box.

*  Stretch  the  box over until it is one inch in height, and 6.5 inches in
width.   Don't  forget  to  select  the Null Pointer tool to get out of Box
Create mode.

Entering Text in Your Box
-------------------------

Professional  Page ia capable of importing text from a variety of different
word  processors.  But there are situations, such as a newsletter masthead,
where  you  may  wish  to add text at the last minute, without going to the
inconvenience  of  using  a word processor where you can type and edit your
text at any time right on the screen.  In fact, if you wish, you can create
the text entirely Professional Page.

To enter text into a box:
------------------------

* Select the Text tool from the general tool palette.

*  Click  inside  the masthead box.  A small line cursor will appear in the
top left hand corner of the box.

* You can now type in the headline of the masthead (try "New Laser Times"),
correcting any mistakes with the backspace and cursor keys.

The  text  is  displayed  on  screen in the default Times font style at the
default point size of 12 points (for more information about fonts and point
sizes  consult  the  Design  section  and  the Glossary).  The text for the
masthead  of  the  newsletter  should  acutally  be  48  point type, in the
Helvetica font style.

Changing Point Size and Typeface
--------------------------------

To change the text to 48 point Helvetica Bold centered text:
-----------------------------------------------------------

*  Select  the  Edit/Select  Box  item.   All  the text in that box will be
highlighted.   This  is  called  a  marked block of text.  While there is a
marked  block of text, changes to the text attributes through the Type menu
will affect the entire block.

*  Select the Type/Typeface/New sub-item.  A requester will display all the
available typefaces in the fonts:  directory.  Select Helvetica by clicking
on the Helvetica line of the directory and clicking OK.  Use the scroll bar
as  necessary.  Using this requester is similar to using the file requester
(see Technical Reference section).

* To change point sizes, select the Type/Size/New sub-itern and enter 48 in
the  requester's  text  line.  You now have 48 point Helvetica.  The Screen
representation uses the closest available screen font and then scales it to
the required size.

* Select Style/Bold sub-item in the Type menu to bold the block of text.

*  Select  the  Type/Justification/Center  sub-item  to center the block of
text.

* Select the Null Pointer to exit Text mode.

Changing Box Attributes
-----------------------

You  can change many aspects of the box that you have just created, guch as
background color, border style, margins, and positionlng.

In  the  newsletter  many of the box attributes are different than the ones
Professional Page has given you by default.

The  newsletter uses a top margin of 0.250".  Margins in boxes do not refer
to  their positioning on the page.  The Position control has that function.
Rather,  margins  refer to the positioning of text and graphics in the box.
You  will notice that the text in the masthead box is positioned at the top
center  of  the  box.   To move the text lower in the box (i.e.set up a top
margin), you must change the Top Margin value from "0" (its default).

To change the Top Margin:
------------------------

* Select the Box/Alter/Active sub-item.

* Click on the Margins/Top text line, and change the value to 0.250 inches.

* Select the OK gadget.

Creating Columns for the Body Text
----------------------------------

Looking  at  the example, you see that there is a bitmap graphic picture in
the  center of the two columns.  We will ignore the bitmap picture for now.
We will create the two straight columns first.

Just  as you created a box for your masthead, now you must create a box for
your  body  text.   Referring to the illustration of the newsletter, we see
that  there  are  two columns.  You could just create two boxes, in the way
you  created  one for the masthead, and use your resizing and repositioning
skills to eventually match up the boxes, but there is an easier way.

Earlier  when  you  created  your  page, you stayed with all of the default
settings.    Professional   Page   allows   you  to  make  changes  to  the
specifications of that page at any time, without losing the contents of the
page/.

First,  reduce  the magnification back to 33% so that we can see the entire
page.

The newsletter has two columns.  Each one is 3.000 inches in width, staring
2.500 inches from the top, and ending 1.000 inch from the bottom.

To  redefine  your  page  with guidelines for two columns use the following
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
steps:
-----

*  Select  the  Page/Alter/Current sub-item in the Page menu.  The familiar
Current Page Format requester will appear.

*  Click in their string gadgets and change the Margins Top to 2.500 inches
and Margins Bottom to 1.00 inches.

*  Make  sure  the  Margins  Right and Margins Left text lines are set to a
value of 1.000 inch.

*  Change  number  of  Columns  to  2.  Set the Gutter (the amount of space
between columns) to 0.500 inches.

* Select the OK gadget.

The page looks a lot like it did before.  To see the columns, activate them
the same way as you activated the grid.

To activate column outlines:
---------------------------

* Select the Layout Tools item under the Preferences menu.

*  At  the  bottorn  of the Layout Tools requester, click on the Columns On
gadget, and then click OK.

The columns are now visible as dotted lines.

NOTE:   the columns are not boxes, but outlines.  You can not directly move
or  resize  columns.   The outles are just there to make your job easier by
giving  you  accurate precise guides.  You should also note that you do not
have  to  stick  to the margins or placements of the columns, they will not
restrict  you  in any way, they are just visual guides.  To use the columns
to  hold  text, you will have to place boxes over the outlines.  Tere is an
easy way to accomplish this, called Auto Boxing.

Auto Boxing
-----------

Before  you can fill your columns with text, you must import that text into
Professional Page, or write in Professional Page's built-in word processor.
On  the Fonts and Utilities disk is a text file created for the newsletter.
You can now import that file.

To import text:
---------------

* Select the Project/Import/Text sub-item.

*  The default requester is titled "Import ASCII file?".  Professional Page
will  permit you to import text from a wide variety of Amiga and other word
processors.   In  this case, the text file was created with WordPerfect, so
you don't want to use the default ASCII import.  Select Cancel.

* From the Preferences menu, select the Text/Format/WordPerfect sub-item.

* Now select Project/Import/Text again.

*  The  Import  WordPerfect  File  requester  will  appear.  Click the DF1:
gadget and click on the NEWSLETTER directory.

* Click on the first file NEWSLETTER1.txt

* Press the OK gadget to import that file.

You now have a text file waiting to be placed on your page (actually, it is
sitting in the text paste buffer).

* Click the Text tool to indicate where you wish to place text.

*  Move  the  pointer on top of the first column outline and press the left
button  while  holding  down  the  CTRL  key.   The largest possible box is
created inside the column.  You want the text to be 12 point, Times, plain,
flush justified (see the Design section).

*  Change  the  typeface  to  Times  by  selecting  the Type/Typeface/Times
sub-item.

* Select the point size of the text by selecting the Type/Size/l2 sub-item.

* Select plain text by using the Type/Style/Plain sub-item.

* Select flush justification by using Typeq/Justification/Flush sub-item.

*  Select  the  Paste  item, in the Edit menu.  That's it, your text is now
placed on the screen.

* Select the Null Pointer to exit Edit mode.

NOTE:   If  you  are  at  33%  magnification  or less, the text will appear
"greeked"  and you must view the page at a higher magnification if you want
to see the text.

You  used  the  Auto  Box  feature  to  place your text.  Professional Page
created  a  box for you with the same dimensions as the column that you had
specified  earlier.   If  you change your mind, you can resize and move the
box  as  you  please.   Auto Boxing allows you to fill pages with text very
quickly and with precision.

Increase  the  magnification, and move the Page Position gadget in the tool
palette  to view the part of the page with the copy that you just placed on
the page.

Linking Text Boxes
-------------------

Set  the  magnification  back  to 33%.  The bottom right hand corner of the
text  box is highlighted with an invertd "L".  Professional Page is telling
you  that all of the text will not fit in the first box that you specified.
what  you  want to do now is to link the first column with a second column,
so that the text that would not fit in the first oclumn will spill into the
second one.

To link two boxes:
-----------------

* Make sure that the first column is selected as the Active Box.

*  To link two boxes, Select the Link tool.  The pointer will change to the
link pointer.

*  Move  the pointer over the second column outline and click while holding
down  the  CTRL  key (using the Auto Box feature again).  The text that did
not fit in the first column will appear at the top of the second column.

* Select the Null Pointer to exit the Link mode.

Before  you finish with text, take a closer look at how your flush justifed
text  actually  appears.   When you change magnification level to 1OO%, you
will  notice  many  large  gaps  in the text.  To eliimnate these gaps, you
could haae Professional Page automatically hyphenate your text.

To hyphenate text:
------------------

*  Select  the  Text tool and click inside a text box.  Since the boxes are
linked, you can click on either box.

* Select the Edit/Select All item.

*  Select  the  Type/Hyphenation  item and all your text will be hyphenated
automatically.

You can see the changes flow through your text.  Notice how this eliminates
the many gaps throughout the un-hyphenated flush-justified text.

Now, let's take a look at the graphic.

Importing Graphics and Drawings
-------------------------------

You  can  import  graphics and drawings in much the same way as you you are
able  to  import  text.   There is a big difference between a graphic and a
drawing.   A  graphic is a picture that is stored as a bitmap.  Any picture
created in DPaint, DPaint II, Aegis Images, GraphiCraft, using the mouse or
a graphic tablet such as the Easyl pressure sensitive drawing pad, or which
was created with a scanner such as Digi-View', is considered a graphic.

A  drawing  is  a  picture that was created using structured graphics.  The
picture  is  stored as a mathematical representation of what is seen on the
screen.   Any  picture  created in Aegis Draw or with the Professional Page
structured  drawing  tools  is  considered a drawing.  For more information
about  drawings  and  graphics,  consult  the  (Using Professional Page and
Technical Reference sections.

The  graphic  used  in the sample newsletter is also on the Utilities disk.
In this newsletter, it will be located near the center of the page.

To make a graphic box:
---------------------

* Use the Box Create tool from the general tool palette.

* Create a new box for the graphic.  The graphic must have an empty, active
box ready to receive it in order to load.

* Create a box starting at the 3" x 5" grid location.

* The bottom right hand corner of the box should extend to the 5.5 " x 7.5"
grid locations.

* Once your box is created, select the Null Pointer tool to exit Box Create
mode.

To load a graphic into the graphic box:
--------------------------------------

* Select the Project/Import/Bitmap Graphic sub-item.

* A file requester appears.

* Click on DF1:, then click on the NEWSLETTER directory.

* Select the file NEWSLETTER1.pic.

* Select the OK gadget.

After  a  moment,  a  grey-toned  image  of the graphic appears in the box.
Looking  at  the newsletter, you see that at this point, the graphic box is
in the middle of the page, overlapping parts of the other two columns.

You  could  use your editing skills to laborously add spaces to the text in
the  overlapped parts of the columns, so a box would fit in a cleared space
in  the  center  of  the  page.   Professional Page gives you a much easier
solution:  text runaround.

Text Runaround
--------------

Text runaround is a feature that will wrap text around any box overlying it
so that the text and box won't overlap each other.

To activate the Text Runaround:
-------------------------------

* Click on graphic box to make it active.

*  Select  the  Box/Alter/Active  sub-item  from the Box menu to change the
graphic box's attributes.

* The Active Box requester will pop up.

* Select the Impermeable Box gadget.

* Set all box margins to 0.100 inches.

* Click OK.

The  text  in  the box below your new graphic box reflows itself around the
graphic  box.   The text runaround feature can be used to create drop caps,
or to insert any pictorial element anywhere into columns of text.

As  it happens, the graphic is actually larger than the box it is displayed
in.   Parts  of it are not visible to you, since they extend past the edges
of the graphic box.

To position the graphic within the box:
--------------------------------------

* Move the pointer over the graphic in its box.

* While pressing the ALT key, press the left mouse button.

*  Moving  the pointer, while keeping the button pressed, will allow you to
move the graphic around inside the box without changing the position of the
box.

* Release the button when you are satisfied with position of the graphic.

The  same  routines that were available for sizing text boxes are available
for  sizing graphjc boses.  When resizing a graphic box, the graphic inside
will  keep  its prevaous position relative to the page.  There is, however,
one  new  feature  that is applicable to graphic or drawing boxes.  This is
graphic  scale.   More  on  graphic  scale  a little later, when you do the
second page.

Structured Graphics
-------------------

Your  first  page is almost complete, minus a few cosmetic additions in the
form  of  horizontal lines which you wi11 now draw on the page.  Adding any
straight  lines,  at  any  angle,  is  a very simple process.  So is adding
rectangles,  ellipses, free hand drawing, polygons, and bezier curves.  All
of the structured drawing tools that you require are available right on the
screen, in the structured Drawing Tool palette (see the Technical Reference
section for a description of the structured graphic tools).

The  real  advantage  in  using  the  structured graphic tools is that they
produce "Drawing" quality results.  This means that the structured graphics
will  output  in the highest resolution of printer that you have available.
A  straight  line at a 45 degree angle will look very straight (no jaggies)
when  output to a 300 Dot Per Inch laser printer.  The same is true for the
Ellipse tool, Bezier Curve tool, the Polygon tool, and Free Hand Draw tool.

These  tools  can be used anywhere on the page without creating a box prior
to  their placement.  Professional Page will automaatically create an exact
fitting box for your structured graphic upon completion.

Back  to  the  newsletter.  Let's draw a one point horizontal line at the 2
inch  mark.   Since  you  have  the  Grid  Snap enabled at 1/2" increments,
positioning the graphic at the precise location desired will be simple.

To place the structured graphic:
-------------------------------

* Select the Line tool from the structured graphic palette.

* Select the Draw/Line/Weight/1 point sub-itern.

* Position the pointer at the 1" x 2" location.

* Drag the line horizontally out to the 7.5" x 2" mark and let go.

You  may  have  noticed that the line drags out and follows your pointer at
any angle.  You may have also noticed that it required a bit of patience in
order  to  create  a perfectly horizontal straight line.  In this case, the
snap  to  grad  ensured  that you created a perfectly straight, level line.
But  many  times you will work without any snap to grid.  Creating straight
lines  is  much  more  difficult  under  these  conditions.   That  is  why
Professional Page provides you with a constraining feature for drawjng with
structured graphics.

Constraining Structured Graphics
--------------------------------

Constraining  Graphics  will  limit  the shapes or angles of the structured
drawing  tools to certain predefined values.  For example, constraining the
straight line drawing tool will only allow you to create lines at 45 degree
angle  increments.  Constraining the rectangle drawing tool will only allow
you to create squares.  Constraining the ellipse drawing tool, you can only
create circles.  Constrained beziers will allow the start and end points of
the  curve  to  always  be  at  45  degree increments.  And by constraining
polygons,  you  get  a  closed  polygon.  The free hand drawing tool is not
affected by the constraining feature.

To  demonstrate  the  constraining  feature, and how easy it is to create a
perfectly  horizontal  line,  please delete the line that you just created,
even if it was conrect.

To delete a structured graphic:
------------------------------

* Click on the structured graphic box to make it active.

* Select Box/Delete Active.  A warning requester appears and click Yes.

To  further  demonstrate  the  use of constraining graphics, deactivate the
Snap to Grid.  The process of disabling the Snap to Grid is similar to that
of  enabling  it  as  you  did  at  the  beginning of the tutorial.  Select
Preferences/Layout Tools and when the Layout Tools requester pops up, click
the Snap to Grid gadget OFF.

Placing Constrained Graphics:
----------------------------

* Start by selecting the Line tool as you did previously.

* Move the pointer over to the begiming location of the line.

*  Before  pressing  the left mouse button to start drawing, press and hold
down  the  ALT  key.   This  key informs Professional Page that you wish to
enable the constraining feature.

*  Now,  simply press and hold the left mouse button and drag out the line.
You  will  notice that the line will remain horizontal, even if the pointer
moves  up  or  down  slightiy.   To  further  demonstrate  the constraining
feature,  move  the  pointer around the first anchor point of the line (the
point  where  you  began  to  draw).  The line will jump at 45 degree angle
increments.

* Release the mouse button when the line is at the desired location.

Again,  boxes  containing structured drawings can be moved and resized just
like any other box that you would create yourself with the Box Create tool.
In  resizing the box, the graphic will always keep its relative position to
the page, unless, of course, you move the entire box.

In the illustration of the newsletter, there is a similar line located 10.5
inches down the page.  Draw a similar line on your own page.

Printing Newsletter Page One
-----------------------------

This  concludes page 1 of the newsletter.  Before you go to Page 2, print a
copy  of  page 1, just to prove that the printed copy really does look like
your  screen  image of the newsletter.  Assuming that you have a PostScript
laser printer connected, tne process to print a page is as follows.

To print a page:
-----------------

* Select the Project/Print/Current Page sub-item.  The Print Page requester
will pop up.

*  Leave  the  number  of  copies at 1 (the default).  With most PostScript
compatible devices, you will Output to:  with the text line set at the ser:
selection,   representing  your  Amiga's  serial  port.   Check  the  Using
Professional  Page  section,  and  Appendix  D:  Connecting Your Amiga to a
Printer, if your laser printer is somehow different.

NOTE:    some   additional   printing   options   can   be   found  in  the
Page/Alter/Current  sub-item.   They  are  discussed  in more detail in the
Technical  Reference  section,  and  Appendix  D:Connecting Your Amiga to a
Printer.

* After making sure that your laser printer is ready to receive data, click
on the OK gadget.

In a few seconds, your laser printer will produce your first page.

Check Appendix A:  Troubleshooting Guide if you have and difficulties.

NEWSLETTER PAGE TWO
-------------------

The  second  page  uses more boxes then the first one.  Because of the more
complicated  design,  it would not be possible to change the page format as
you  did  to create the columns for the first page.  The only way to create
this  is  to  manually  place the boxes in the desired fashion on the page.
Describing  the  actual  layout  would  be  time  consuming,  and  not very
informative,  considering  that  you  already know how to manipulate boxes.
For  this  tutorial,  you  have an alternative to creating all of the boxes
from scratch.  You can import the page as a Template.

Templates
---------

Template  pages  are  essentially  individual  pages  that you have created
earlier  and  saved to disk as pages.  They can contain boxes, either empty
or with information inside them such as graphics, drawings or text.

Templates  can  be  very useful when repetition of a layout is common.  For
example,  say you are writing reports that share many common elements.  You
could  define  all of the standard layout elements (dimensions of the page,
number  and  dimensions of columns, levels of indents, crop marks) and save
that  as a page.  Then, to create a particular document, you can recall the
appropriate template, and add the specific information for that document to
it.

The  template that you will be using in this tutorial consists of a pattern
of empty boxes already arranged as a layout.

Importing a Template
--------------------

*  Select  the  Page/Load/Even  Templates sub-item.  The Load Even Template
Pages requester will pop up.

* Click the DF1:  gadget in the requester.

* Click on the NEWSLETTER directory.

* Double click the Page2.template file.

The  template  is  now  loaded into memory.  Once loaded, all pages created
From Template will look identical to this particular template.

Professional Page allows you to define two different templates at any given
time.   Under  normal circumstances, they are used for the even and odd (or
left  and  right  hand)  pages  in  a  document  and  are labelled as such.
However, you are not restricted to using the templates in this way.

Creating a Page from a Template
-------------------------------

* Select the Page/Create/From Template sub-item

* A requester appears.

* Click on Use Even

* Click on OK

The  page  will  then  appear on your art board.  The Page Number Indicator
value, at the top of the tool palette on the right edge of the screen, will
change to the number two.

Examining the second page more closely, you will notice that each box has a
number  inside  it,  intended  to  identify  each  box that the tutorial is
referring  to.   Before  you actually place any information in the box, you
will want to erase the number, without affecting any of the box attributes.
This is accomplished with the Mop tool.

Mopping Up
----------

To  demonstrate  mopping  in Professional Page, let's erase the contents of
Box #1, located at top left corner of the page.

To Mop up:
---------

* Select the Mop tool from the General tool palette.

* Select Box #1. A warning requestor will pop up.

*  Press  the  YES gadget to confirm that you wish to erase the contents of
the box.  The number will disappear, but the box will remain.

That's it, the contents have been "Mopped up".

NOTE:   You can not enter anything (text, graphic, drawing), in a non-empty
box.  You will always have to mop it first.

WARNING:   Mopping  a  box that is part of a linked chain of boxes (i.e.  a
text  article)  will  delete  the  entire  text contents.  The links remain
intact.

Switching Between Pages
-----------------------

Flipping between pages is very easy.  There are two ways of doing it.

To flip back or forwards one page:
---------------------------------

*  Click  while  your  mouse  pointer  is over the bottom arrow of the Page
Number  Indicator  gadget to flip back one page, and click on the top arrow
of the Page Number Indicator gadget to flip forward one page.

NOTE:   the  Page  Number Indicator gadget can be operated using any of the
tools selected.

To jump directly to any page:
-----------------------------

*  Click on the text line in the Page Number Indicator and erase the number
you find there.  Type in the page number that you wish to jump to and press
the RETURN key.  Now, please return to Page One.

Linking Text from one Page to Another
-------------------------------------

If you look at the bottom right hand corner of your second column, you will
notice  the  "L"  shaped  gadget  indicating that there is extra text which
could not be fitted nto your first two linked boxes.  This text is still in
memory,  waiting  for  a  box  it  can  be  flowed  into.  You can flow the
additional  text  into  Page Two by linking Page One's second column with a
box on the next page.

To Link the pages:
------------------

* Make the second column active.

* Select the Link tool from the tool palette.

* Flip to Page Two using the Page Number Indicator gadget.

* Click onto the original box #1, which you mopped up earlier.

This  procedure  links  colunn  2  from Page One to the box #1 on Page Two,
allowing text to pour out into the newly linked box.

You  will  see that Page Two has entirely changed.  A sequence of boxes has
been flled with text automatically.  How did this happen?

Linked Boxes in Templates
-------------------------

The  template  used  to create Page Two was constructed with several boxes,
some  of  which were linked.  When the template was loaded, and text poured
into the first box, it continued to flow through the entire series.

Go  into  a higher magnification mode to view the type that flowed into the
boxes  on Page Two.  You will see that the type is in several typefaces and
point  sizes  without  you  having  set  any  of the typesetting parameters
yourself.

Embedded Codes
--------------

This  pre-formatting  of text was done using "embedded codes", instructions
inserted  into  the  text  at  the  word  processing stage and picked up by
Professional  Page  when  the text was imported.  The use of embedded codes
means  that  anyone wijth a word processing program can do much of the text
formatting  which you would otherwise have had to do with the mouse and the
pull-down menus in Professional Page (see Appendix F:  Formatting Text, for
more information on formattjng text).

You  will notice, though, that your text does not completely fill the page.
There is still a structured graphic to import to finish the page.  Import a
structured graphic into the middle left hand box, which is labelled box #2,
and was not filled with text like the other boxes.

Mop  up  the number identifying box #2, using the Mop tool, so that the box
will  be  active and empty.  Select the Null Pointer when you are finished.
Now you can import a drawing into this box.

Importing a Structured Drawing
-------------------------------

* Select Project/Import/Structured Drawing.

* When the Import Drawing?  requester pops up, click the DF1:   gadget.

* Select the NEWSLETTER directory.

* Select the NEWSLETTER.DWG file.

* The drawing will load into box #2.

Unlike  the graphic that you loaded into Page One, this drawing fits snugly
within  the box outline.  Professional Page will always import a structured
graphic  at  a  size  that fits the box while maintaining its proper aspect
ratio.

Onto the Art Board
------------------

* Switch your magnification mode to 33%, and, using the Null Pointerr, move
the  structured  graphic  onto the art board.  Notice that the Null Pointer
tums  into  a  hand  while dragging the structured graphic's box across the
page.   The  hand  icon then turns into a thumbtack icon when it moves onto
the art board.

*  "Pin"  the  box anywhere on the art board.  The drawing will wait safely
out of the way while you reorganize the page.

Rearranging the Page
--------------------

*  To  make box #1 larger, drag the bottom middle handle of box # 1 down to
the  bottom of the page.  Text will flow from other boxes in the chain into
the newly enlarged box.

Deleting the box:
----------------

* Select the upper right hand box.

*  Select  Box/Delete Active item, and the box will disappear The text will
flow into the next box.

Finishing the Page
------------------

*  Drag  the  drawing off the art board, and drop it into the middle of the
page.

* Select the Box/Alter/Active sub-item.  The requester will pop up.

* Click the Impermeable Box gadget on.

* Set all box Margins at 0.250 inches.

* Set the Position and Size to left 2.5, top 7.5, width 3.5 and height 2.5.

* Adjust the Graphic Scale to 0.8

The text will run around the drawing, which will have resized to the center
of the page.  You'll notice that the text fits the page quite comfortably.

That's it, your complete newsletter iS finished.

Viewing the Newsletter
---------------------

You  can  view  the  newsletter  without  the  distracting  rulers,  or box
outlines.  After all, they do not print on your page.

To disable all of tbe non-printing outlines:
-------------------------------------------

*  Select  the  Preferences/Layout  Tools item.  The Layout Tools requester
pops up.

* Set all of the follow;ing to OFF:  Grid, Ruler, Columns, Outlines

* Click OK.

Professional Page will now show you the page without any outlines or grids,
This will give you a better preview of the final output.

NOTE:  You can switch between page one and two, and fully edit the pages as
before.

Printing the Complete Newsletter
--------------------------------

Professional  Page  gives  you a great deal of flexibility in printing your
document.  For example, each page can be rotated and/or scaled to any size,
using  the  PostScript  Output  Specifications  in  the  Page/Alter/Current
sub-item.   These  features  are discussed in the "Printing" sub-section in
the  Using  Professional Page section.  For this tutorial, though, you will
first print the newsletter using the basic default settings.

To print the entire newsletter:
------------------------------

*  Select  the  Project/Print/Entire Document sub-item.  The Print Document
requester  will  pop  up  (for a full discussion of printing options within
this requester, see the Technical Reference section).

* Select OK.

After a few moments, each page will be printed.

CONCLUSION
----------

Let 's review what we have learned.

On  the  first  page,  we  created and deleted boxes, delined columns, used
groups,  created  and  used  grids,  imported  text  from a word processing
program  and  created text with Professional Page's own text editor, linked
boxes,  styled  and  hyphenated and justified text, imported a graphic, ran
text  around it, created some rules with structured graphics, practiced the
use of constraints, and practiced outputting the page.

With  the  second page, we went on to use templates, learned about mopping,
flippang  between  pages, linking text between pages, learned the existence
of  embedded  text codes, imported and manipulated structured drawings, and
learned how to print an entire document.

Where do you go from here?  Experiment.  There are many other features that
weren't  discussed  in  this tutorial.  Only through experimenting with the
various  features  listed  in  the  Technical Reference section, and in the
Using  Professional  Page section, will you actually acquire skill in their
use.   After  the  Using  Professional  Page  section, you should study the
Design section.  Although the Design section is not a hands-on tutorial, it
does  discuss  Professional  Page  from  the  point  of  view of design and
production.   The  Design section also explains some of the finer points of
typography, an area which we did not cover in great detail in the tutorial.
It  will  also  explain the principles of good design, and tie that in with
the information that you have learned in this tutorlal.

On  the  Fonts  and  Utilities  disk,  there  exists a copy of the finished
newsletter.   If  in your experimentatlon, you destroy part, or all of your
newsletter,  you  can  always recall the original stored on the disk.  This
newsletter  that  you  have  just  created  is a great test bed for further
experiments   with   more   advanced   features.    The   file   is  called
NEWSLETTER.FINAL,  and  can  be loaded from the NEWSLETTER directory of the
Fonts and Utilities disk with the use of the Project/Open item as described
earlier in this tutorial.

5. USING PROFESSIONAL PAGE...
---------------------------

The  aim  of  this  section  is  to help you learn to use Professional Page
effectively, by showing you the concepts underlying the program, and how to
use  them.   It  is assumed here that you have worked through the tutorial,
and  have  a good idea of how to find your way around the Professional Page
screen  and  menus.  By the time you finish this section, you should have a
much  clearer  idea  of  how Professional Page parts work together, and you
will be able to take the initiative in terms of starting your own projects.

The section is composed of four parts:
-------------------------------------

*  "Using Boxes" concerns how boxes are created and used singly, in groups,
and in linked sequences or chains.

* "Text" is a descnption of how text is created, imported, and manipulated.
It  is  mainly  concerned  with  the  text editor, and leaves typographical
considerations for discussion in the Design section.

* "Bitmap Graphics" covers the use of Amiga bitmap graphics.

* "Structured Drawings" describes the use of Amiga structured drawings.

*  "Printing"  discusses  how  you  can  output your documents from various
PostScript compatible laser printers and typesetting machines.

HOW TO USE THIS SECTION
-----------------------

This  section  is intended to give a general picture of how the eleMents of
Professional  Page  can  be  used.   It  is not a hands-on tutonal like the
previous  section,  nor  is  it  a series of definitions like the Technical
Reference.   Rather,  it  is  intended to integrate the concepts behind the
separate  operations.   You should refer to it whenever you want to refresh
your understanding of Professional Page's conventions.

THE PRODUCTION PROCESS
----------------------

"Desktop  Publishing"  has  to  encompass  the  entire "pre-press" world of
publishing,  which means understanding and managing a variety of skills and
a  variety  of  tools  outside  of  Professional Page.  For the experienced
designer  using new technology, or for tne novice wishing to understand the
steps  involved  in  putting  together  a document, this section provides a
general perspective on the effective use of Professional Page.

Traditionally,  publishing  involved  several  distinct  steps  peformed by
people  with  widely  varying  skills,  separated  from each other by craft
traditions  and  technology.  The magazine publishing process, for example,
often went something like this:

Writing - Editing - Layout - Typesetting - Photography and Illustration

The  editor  would  commission  articles  and illustrations for an upcoming
issue.   The  publication's art director or designer established the design
standard for the publication.  Writers, artists, and photographers produced
stories  and graphics.  Advertisers submitted ads either camera ready or as
text and graphics for the magazine's art department to assemble.

The  editor  read the typewritten stories and manually corrected them.  The
graphics went to the editor, art director, or designer for approval.

The  edited  text  was  manually  retyped  into  a typesetting machine by a
typesetter,  who  ofen  worked  for  a company separate from the publishing
company.

The typeset text was output from the typesetting machine as a long strip or
column  of  type,  referred to as a "galley".  The galley was proofread and
corrected, and then the art director or designers would wax the long strips
of type and past them onto an art board.

Photos  and illustrations were enlarged or reduced to the concect size with
a  stat  camera and photos would be "screened", or turned into a pattern of
dots instead of continuous-tone photographic print.

The  graphics were pasted onto art boards, and the finished art boards were
sent to the printer's for platemaking and printing.

Under  the  old  systern,  there  was a great deal of repetition and manual
labor  (for  example, a story might have to be retyped two or three times).
The  typesetting  equipment  was  often too expensive and complicated for a
publisher  to  own  "in-house", which meant using an outside company, which
often  resulted  in  extra delays, costs, and communication problemS.  Many
times,  people  were  effectively  prevented  from  publishing high quality
documents  by  the  cost  and coplexity of phototypesetting and its related
services.

The Professional Page Method
----------------------------

With  Professional  Page, the production process can be greatly streamlined
and  made  less expensive.  For a modest investnent, and with some training
and practice, almost any publisher can concentrate most or all of the steps
in  the production of high quality documents in-house.  A designer can have
the  computerized  equivalent  of a design studio and a typesetting shop at
his  or  her  fingertips.  Again, using the example of a magazine, an ideal
production process using Professional Page might look like this:

              Writing - Editing - Layout and Type  -  Output
                 |          |             |              |
               Disk       Disk          Disk            Disk
                 |_________| |___________| |_____________|

            Photography and   Professional Page  PostScript Printer
                  Illustration                  |
                          |_____________________|

First of all, authors write their stories on personal computers (using word
processing  programs  on Amigas, or on any other computers which can export
text to Professional Page.

The  editor  receives  the  stories on floppy disk, or by telecommunication
using  a  modem, and edits them using a personal computer (again, either an
Amiga,  or  any  machine  which can export text to Professional Page).  The
writer  or  the  editor  can  also  put in the typesetting codes or formats
stating  what typeface, point size, and style the type is to be set in.  An
author  who  regularly  writes  a column for the magazine, for example, can
easily learn the few basic codes for formauing his or her own articles.

The magazine's art director or designer also uses Professional Page.  He or
she  sets  up the "templates", or grids, of the magazine's standard layout,
perhaps  based  on  rough  sketches  created  with a pencil and paper.  The
Professional  Page templates are similar to blank art boards.  The designer
uses Professional Page to rough out pages, reserving space for the ads, and
then  begins  pouring  columns  of  text  into  the  boxes, fine tuning the
typographical features, and editing copy to fit.

Photos  and  other artwork can be scanned into the Amiga as bitmap graphics
with  the Digi-View digitizer (see Appendix C; Using Professional Page with
Other Amiga Products).  The digitized photos are imported into Professional
Page,  cropped  and  resized,  given  margins  and  frames  as desired, and
screened  for  output  as  halftones.  For many applications.  Professional
Page  completely  eliminates  the  need for a stat camera.  In other cases,
scanned  photos  can  serve  as  guides  showimg  position and cropping for
traditionally  produced  halftones.  If the designer wishes to use halftone
or  line  art  froml non-computerized sources, he or she can leave an empty
space  in  the  layout to manually paste in the illustration after the page
has  been  output.   Similarly,  if an advertiser is supplying camera ready
art,  the  designer  simply  leaves an empty space for the ad to be dropped
into place manually.

Columns  of  galley, or entire pages, can be output from a laser printer at
any  stage  of  the  process  for  proofreading  and  editor  or advertiser
approval.  The final pages can be output from a high-resolution typesetting
machine   (see  "Printing"  later  in  this  section).   With  Gold  Disk's
Professional  Color  separator  (sold  separately)  pages  can be output as
screened  and  color  separated  film.   Here  are  the advantages of using
desktop publishing with Professional Page:

*  A  complete  design  and typesetting studio can be set up by a publisher
in-house at a fraction of the cost of traditional equipment.

*  Professional  Page  and  its Professional Color separator offer the most
comprehensive capabilities available in a desktop publishing system.

*  The  amount of manual typing, editing, retyping, and keying of text into
the  typesetting  machine  is  greatly  reduced.   This saves much time and
money.

*  Proofreading can be greatly simplified by using spelling checkers and by
printing out clear legible proofs for correcting.

*  The  number  of  times  that the text has to be output from an expensive
typesetting  machine  can  be  greatly  reduced  by using a laser pmter for
galley and page proofs.

*  For  some  purposes,  laser  printer  output is of sufficient quality to
eliminate the need for typesetting machine output.  Even if high-resolution
typeset  output  is  required,  a designer using Professional Page has full
control  over  typesetting,  rather  than  having  to  rely  on  an outsjde
typesetter to interpret the dummy pages and specs that the designer created
and sent with the typewritten copy.

Desktop  publishing  with Professional Page still relies on human skill and
artistry, and on traditional writing, editing, and design skills.  However,
it  combines  typesetting, design, illustration, and color separation tools
in an inexpensive, and easy to use personal computer.

The Operating Environment
-------------------------

As stated at the beginning of the manual, this program is a "page oriented"
typesetting  and  page  assembly program.  It allows great flexibility when
creating  a document one page at a time by not automatically paginating the
entire document.  Professional Page duplicates in computer form many of the
traditional tools and methods of graphic designers.

The Screen
----------

The screen is your art table, with a representation of your current page on
the right hand side of the screen.  The normal screen display is 640 by 400
pixels  on an ordinary NTSC (North American Video Standard) monitor.  Using
an  "overscan"  utility  such  as  "More  Lines"  (see  Appendix  C:  Using
Professional  Page with Other Amiga Products), you can display up to 704 by
442 pixels at once, although this takes more memory.

PAL Support
-----------

Professional  Page  looks  to  see  if your Amiga has a PAL (European Video
Standard)  chip.   If it does, Professional Page operates in PAL resolution
(640 by 525 pixels).

Multitasking
------------

Professional  Page  suppods  multitasking,  up  to  the  limits of chip and
overall  memory.   This  means  that  you may be able to run other programs
simultaneously  with  Professional Page.  In a case where the programs take
up  a lot of chip memory (such as Professional Page and Deluxe Paint II, or
Professional  Page and WordPerfect), there nay not be enough chip mleory to
support both.

Artboard
--------

Any  area  of  the  screen  outside  the  current page is known as the "art
board".  The art board is a convenient area to store parts of the document.
If  you want to have text flowing into boxes on widely separated pages, you
can keep a box with overflow text sitting on the art board until you find a
space  for  it  on another page.  If you wish to reorganize a page, you can
remove parts of the page onto the art board until you need them.

Grid
----

You  can  set  up  grids  on  your  page  to create a consistent, organized
framework  for  positioning  text,  drawings,  and graphics (See the Design
section for some examples of grids).

Snap to Grid
------------

Selecting  the Preferences/Layout Tools/Snap to Grid sub-item automatically
causes  boxes  or  structured  graphics  you  create or move to snap to the
nearest grid intersection.

Rulers
------

There  are  rulers  on the top and the left side of the page, marked out in
whatever  units of measure (inches, picas, or centimeters) you select using
the Preferences/Layout Tools/Units sub-item.

Quick Move
----------

You  can  select  whether  or  not you wish to have the contents of the box
visible while you are moving a box by turning Quick Move on or off.

Tools
-----

There  are  several  general  tools  (Box Create, Null Pointer, Group, Hand
Move,  Text,  and  Mop)  that  you  must specifically turn on and off.  For
example,  if you wish to create a box, you must select the Box Create tool.
If  you  wish to type text into the box, you must select the Text tool.  If
you  wish  to  move  the box, you must select the Null Pointer.  This seems
simple,  but  if  you forget which tool is cunrently in use, you may become
confused.   The  only exception to this convention is the Group tool, which
automatically  turns itself off and selects the Null Pointer after you make
a  group.   This happens because Professional Page only allows one group to
be active in the document at one time.

Tool Pointers
-------------

Several  tools have pointers to help you see which one is currently in use.
The  Null  Pointer is an arrow.  When you move a box on a page, the pointer
turns  into  a  hand.   When you move a box onto the art board, the pointer
turns  into a thumb tack.  The Text tool pointer is a vertical line showing
the  exact  point  where  text will be inserted.  The Mop tool pointer is a
mop.   The Hand Move tool pointer is a hand.  The Box Create and Group tool
pointers  are  a  set  of  crosshairs, to allow you to drag your box to the
precise  location.   To  let  you  see  the  location  of  the  crosshairs,
guidelines  on  the  rulers  on the top and left of the page show where the
pointer  is  located.   On  the  top  right  of  the  menu strip, the exact
coordinates of the pointer's location are displayed in the current units of
measure.

Requesters
----------

Making  menu  selections often causes a requester to appear.  The different
types  of  requesters are:  File requesters with a standard layout; Warning
requesters  with  simple  Yes/No!   options;  and  Specialized  requesters.
Requesters  are  one  way  Professional  Page  asks  for  instructions, and
presents choices for you to select.

Keyboard Shortcuts
------------------

Professional  Page allows you to use the mouse to make menu selections, but
also  offers  keyboard  equivalents  to allow users to make selections more
quickly.

There   are   some  general  shorcuts  useful  in  making  selections  from
requesters.   For  instance, press RETURN instead of clicking OK to cause a
file  to  load or save and double click on a file name to cause the file to
load or save.

Many  of  the  keyboard  equivalents  are  grouped  to  make them easier to
remember:


*  CTRL  x:  Holding down the CONTROL key and pressing a second key usually
selects a non-menu item.

* ALT x:  Holding down the ALT key and pressing a second key usually alters
something.

*  A x:  Holding down the Right AMIGA key and pressing a second key usually
selects a general menu.

* F:  Pressing a function key selects a text editing item.

*  SHIFT  x:   Holding down the SHIFT key and pressing a second key selects
everything not assigned to the keyboard equivalents listed above.

For  a complete list of keyboard shodcuts, see the Quick Reference Card, or
Appendix E:  Keyboard Equivalents.

UNDERSTANDING THE PAGE
----------------------

Pages are kept in consecutive order within Professional Page.

When  the Load/New Current sub-item is chosen the new page is loaded at the
end  of  the  document.   The  Page/Create/From Template sub-item creates a
range  of  pages  using  the odd or even templates or the appropriate pages
based  on  page  numbers.   Creatjng  a  range  of pages in the middle of a
document  shifts the existing pages up automatically.  The Page/Create/From
Default   sub-item   also   fits   a  range  of  pages  into  the  document
automatically.    The   Page/Delete  item  resequences  page  numbers  upon
deletion.

The Magnified Page
------------------

When  you  are working on a page in one of the higher magnification levels,
you  may find it useful to be able to see where you are on the page, and to
scroll around the magnified page with some degree of precision.

The  part of the page you are in is indicated by the white rectangle in the
Page Position tool.

There are three ways to move around a magnified page:

* Select the Hand Move tool and use it to drag the visible part of the page
around the screen.

*  Use  the  white  rectangle on the Page Position tool to drag the visible
part of the page around the screen.

* Use the cursor keys to jump around the page.  One press of a cursor moves
the  visible  part  of  the  page  four  inches  in the selected direction.
Pressing  SHIFT/cursor  jumps  to  the  end  of  the  page in the direction
selected.   Pressing  CTRL/cursor  jumps  to  the  end  of  the page in the
direction selected.

Changing Pages
--------------

The  Page  Number  gadget has two ways of changing the current page.  Click
the  Up  or  Down  arrows  to  select  the  next page or the previous page,
respectively.  Pages can also be selected by using a keyboard entry.

USING BOXES
-----------

A  box  is  a  container  of  text, bitmap graphics or structured graphics.
Boxes are the building blocks of your finished documents.

The  box is an amazingly flexible and powerful tool, and when you have made
yourself  fully  proficient  with  all  its  uses,  you will be able to use
Professional  Page  very  profuctively  as  a  versatile, high quality page
design system.

This  sub-section is devoted to the uses of the box in conjunction with the
text, graphics, and drawings it can contain.

What is a Box?
--------------

A  box is a precisely defined area which can serve as a container for text,
bitmap  graphics,  or  structured  drawings.  A box can exist anywhere on a
page, or on the art board.

The Anatomy of a Box
--------------------

The box appears on the Professional Page screen with a rectangular solid or
dashed  outline.  The outline is solid in the active box (the last one that
the  mouse  was  clicked on), and all other box outlines are dashed.  Every
box  has  eight  handles on it, one in each corner and one in the middle of
each  side  of the outline.  These handles can be used to resize the box by
clicking  on  a handle with the Null Pointer and dragging.  The only time a
box does not have handles is if it is a locked box.

The  appearance  of  the  box  outline changes when a box is made part of a
group.   A  box  containing  text  or a bitmap graphic can be automatically
given  a  perfectly  fitted  frame using the Box/Alter/Active/Frame gadget.
Boxex  can also be given margins of clear space to separate them from other
boxes using the Box/Alter Active/Margins gadget.

Creating Boxes
--------------

Boxes  can  be  created with the Box Create tool of the tool palette, or by
means  of the Auto Box feature.  When you have created as many boxes as you
need,  be  sure  to  turn  off  the  Box  Create tool by selecting the Null
Pointer.   Otherwise,  you  will continue creating boxes whenever you press
the left mouse button.

Moving a box
------------

There  are several ways to move a box.  The most simple is to grab it using
the  Null Pointer.  The pointer turns into a hand shaped icon if the box is
on  the  page,  or  into  a  thumbtack shaped icon if the box is on the art
board.   Drag the box around the page or the art board to where you want it
and release.

Positioning the Box
-------------------

Positioning  boxes with the mouse is very intuitive, but may not be precise
enough.   Professional  Page  offers  several tools for positioning the box
more  precisely.   They  are:  Rulers and Coordinates, The Box/Alter/Active
Position  gadgets  and  the  Preferences/Layout Tools/Grid and Snap to Grid
gadgets.

Using the Rulers
----------------

Rulers  are  on  by default, and unless you specifically turn them off they
will  be visible on the top and the left side of your page.  As soon as you
start  moving the box around the page, the precise location of the top left
hand  corner  of  the box is indicated by the ruler lines along the top and
the  left  side  of  the  page.  The exact coordinates of the top left hand
corner are also displayed on the nght of the menu strip.

Snap to Grid
------------

You  can  lay  out  a  grid on your page using the Preferences/Layout Tools
item, and turn on Snap to Grid (see the discussion of the Layout Tools item
in  the  Technical  Reference  section, and the parts of the Design section
concerned with the use of grids).  From then on, whenever you create a box,
it  will automatically adjust itself to fit its corners to the nearest grid
line  intersection.  If your grids are measured in 1/2 inch increments, you
can  drag  your box to approximately the right location and size.  When you
release   the  mouse  button,  the  box  will  snap  to  the  nearest  grid
intersections.

The Active Box
--------------

Only  one  box is "active" at a given time.  The active box is the one most
recently  clicked  on with the mouse pointer.  The active box is where most
user-initiated  operations  take place (for example, enterig text, drawing,
loading  graphics  and  drawings).  You can locate the active box easily by
selecting  Box/Show  Active.   The  active  box  will  flash in green for a
moment.

Active Box Positioning
----------------------

In  the Box/Alter/Active requester, there are four Position settings.  Type
in  the locations of the top left corner, the width and the height, and the
box will be resized and located as required.

Filling A Box
-------------

A  box  must be empty before it is filled with any imported element whether
text,  graphic  or  structured  drawing.   You  must first select it as the
active box (see Project/Import in the Technical Reference section).

Mopping a Box
-------------

To  delete  the  contents of a box while leaving the box intact, select the
Mop  tool  from the general tools palette, and click on the box you wish to
empty.   A  warning  message  will appear, asking for confirmation, and the
contents  can  be  deleted (see Tool Palette/Mop in the Technical Reference
section).

Deleting a Box
--------------

The active box can be deleted by selecting the Box/Delete item.  If the box
has  contents,  a  warning message will appear, following which the box and
its  contents  disappear.   Howvever,  in the case of bitmap graphic boxes,
this  is only true if the box was not cloned.  For examlple, if the box was
cloned  several  times,  the  warning  message  will only appear if you are
deleting  the  last copy of the box.  In the case of a text box, if all the
contents  of  the  text file are in the box, a warning message will appear,
after  which  the  box, and the contents will be deleted.  If the text file
extends  through  a  series  of linked boxes, no warning will appear if you
delete  a  box,  until  you  delete  the last box in the linked series (see
Box/Active/Delete in the Technical Reference section).

Grouping
--------

Grouping means that the boxes designated as a group can be moved as a unit,
keeping their position relative to each other.

Any  combination of text, graphic, and drawing boxes can be designated as a
group.

Using  groups  can  save  you  a  lot of time.  For example, if you want to
reorganize  the  layout  of a page, you can remove a large part of the page
onto the art board, empty, or replace the remainder of the page layout, and
then move the group back onto the page.

Creating a Group
----------------

Select  the Group tool from the general tool palette.  The Group pointer is
a  set  of  crosshairs.  Go to the upper left hand corner of the area whose
boxes  you wish to group, and draw a group outline around the collection of
boxes.  When you release the mouse button, the Group tool switches off, and
reverts  to  the  Null Pointer.  All completely enclosed boxes will be made
into a group.

Adding to a Group
-----------------

Hold the SHIFT key and click on a box.  The box must be on the art board or
the same page as the main group to be added to it.

Removing a Box From a Group
---------------------------

Hold the CTRL key and click on a box.

Cloning a Group
---------------

Select  the  Group/Clone  item and all boxes in the group are cloned.  Only
the  visible  box  contents  are  copies,  including all graphics and text.
Article  chains  are  not  copied.   Once the group is cloned, the original
group is forgotten, and the newly cloned boxes form a new group.

Deleting a Group
----------------

Select  the  Group/Delete item and all boxes that are part of the group are
deleted.  A warning message appears if any of the boxes has any contents.

Forgetting a Group
------------------

Select  the  Group/Forget  item and the group is forgotten (ungrouped).  At
this point, no group exists.

Aligning a Group
----------------

Selecting  the  Group/Align  item  and  one  of Top, Bottom, Right or Left,
correspondingly  aligns  the group with the active box.  (See the Technical
Reference section for details.)

Centering a Group
-----------------

Select  Group/Center  and one of the sub-items and all members of the group
are  centered  vertically,  horizontally,  or  both  with the center of the
active box.

Merging a Group
---------------

Select  Group/Merge  and  all  structured  drawing  boxes  in a group merge
together  into  one  box.   This allows sizing and moving of the structured
graphics as a single unit.

NOTE: A merge cannot be undone.

Linking Boxes
-------------

Boxes  may  be linked together into a series or chain of boxes to allow you
to  flow  text  articles  across  a  page or pages.  Only text boxes can be
linked.

To  line  one box to another, use the Link tool.  Make the first box of the
article  active  and  select the Link tool.  Click on the second box in the
series,  then  the third, and so on.  The text will flow to fill the boxes,
until  all  the  text  has  been poured.  If there is more text than can be
accommodated  in  the linked series, the last box will have its lower right
hand  corner  highlighted  by  an  L-shaped  handle.   (See  the  Technical
Reference section for information on the Link tool.)

Unlinking
---------

A  series  of linked boxes can be unlinked by selecting the Unlink tool and
clicking  on a box.  The box in the series prior to the one clicked on will
be  the  last  box  in  the  preceding  series.  The box clicked on and any
subsequent  boxes  in  the  series  will  now  be a second, separate linked
article chain.

Deleting a Linked Box
---------------------

You  can  delete  a linked box by clicking on it to make it the active box,
and  then  selecting the Box/Delete item.  The box will desappear without a
warning  requester,  because  as  long  as there is at least one box in the
series  still  intact,  the text isn't deleted from memory.  When you go to
delete  the last remaining box in a series, a warning requester will pop up
asking for a confirmation.  When the last box is deleted, the text contents
will be deleted as well.

Layering Boxes
--------------

Boxes  are  layered  one  on  top of each other based on the order of their
creation.   The last box created is automatically placed on top.  To change
the  order  of  boxes, use the Box-to-Back gadget to move the active box to
the back of all other boxes.  Use the Box-to-Front gadget to bring a box to
the front of other boxes.

Auto Boxes
----------

Boxes can be created automatically using Auto Box.  The size of this box is
determined by where you click.  Boxes created by Auto Box take on the width
of  the column where the click was made.  They are made as tall as possible
without  running over any other box in the column.  A box is created (using
the Auto Box technique) when:

*  in Box Create mode:  the left mouse button is clicked while the CTRL key
is held.  An empty box is created.

*  in  Link  mode:   the left mouse button is clicked while the CTRL key is
held.  A text box is created and linked to the currently active box.

*  in  Text  mode:   the left mouse button is clicked while the CTRL key is
held.  A text box is created for text editing.

TEXT
----

 Professional Page is a page design and layout program, and is not intended
to  compete  with  dedicated word processors.  Rather, Professional Page is
designed  to  work  with text from a wide range of both word processors and
text editors, whether generated by the Amiga or by other computers.  Once a
document  is created, there is a need to be able to edit or create new text
without  exiting  the  program.   Professional  Page  handles  text  in the
following manner:

*  Text  can  be  imported into Professional Page as ASCII files, or in the
formats  of particular Amiga word processors such as WordPerfect, TextCraft
Plus, Scribble!, and others.

*  Professional  Page  accepts  native  style  parameters of word processor
files, such as:  italics, bold, underline, tabs, and others.

*  Special  formatting  codes  may  be  embedded  in  the  text at the word
processor  level.   These  codes  are  interpreted  by Professional Page as
instructions for such characteristics as typeface, point size and leading.

* Professional Page has its own WYSIWYG (What-YOu-See-Is-What-You-Get) text
editor  which  fnctions  as  an  adjunct to the page layout and typesetting
features.   Professional Page's text tools allow you to manipulate imported
text  and  to  compose text while working on a document.  The typographical
controls  are mentioned briefly in this section (see the Design section for
more information.)

Pre-planning Your Text
----------------------

To  make  the  most  productive use of Professional Page, the computer, and
your  time,  you  can  do  a  little  advance  plaming  to ensure that word
processed files come into the program in their most useful form.

You  may  ask  the  author  or  editor  of  an  article to insert the basic
typographical  specifications  (point  size,  typeface,  and  leading  as a
minimum)  for  you, using the Professional Page formatting conventions (see
Appendix  F:   Formatting).   Formatting at the writing or editing stage is
easy to do, and will save everyone both time and money.

Text File Translation
---------------------

If  you are using a text file from an Amiga word processor not specifically
suppoded  by  a Professional Page (or from a computer other than an Amiga),
you  should  test  how cleanly a file from that particular computer or word
processor  comes  into  Professional Page in generic mode.  Some may import
more  easily  than  others.  Some word processed files may be imported with
unwanted  characters  or control codes.  Try to avoid surprises, especially
if you're working to a deadline, by conducting tests ahead of time.

Importing Text
--------------

Typically,  users  tend  to  use a favorite word processor.  Therefore, the
Preferences/Text Format item only needs to be set once.  If you must import
a  file  from more than one word processor into a document, just change the
Text  Format  to the appropriate setting just before you import them.  Once
the  file  has  been  imported into Professional Page, it sits in the paste
buffer for processing.

ASCII files
-----------

Word   processed   files   from  non-Amiga  sources  can  be  brought  into
Professional  Page  in  generic  ASCII  format.   It is helpful to have the
particular  woru  processor  save  the contents in plain ASCII (text only),
rather than its native form.  ASCII files can be transmitted via a modem or
a null modem cable from another computer.

Native Style Parameters
-----------------------

Styles  (bold,  italic,  etc.) are imported into Professional Page from all
supported   word   processing  packages.   This  speeds  up  production  by
eliminating the need for you to manually insert style parameters.

Embedded ASCII Codes
--------------------

Any  writer  or  editor  can  produce  galley  by  inserting  typographical
formatting  codes  into  a  word  processor file.  This greatly reduces the
operator's burden of inserting typographic codes manually after the text is
imported.   Any  text  editing  terminal  thus becomes part of Professional
Page's production process.

Text Editor
-----------

The  text editor is invoked in Professional Page by selecting the Text tool
from  the  general tool palette and clicking into a text box.  Professional
Page  uses a "point and shoot" format to input and edit text.  Click in the
text  box  where  you  want to place your text cursor and you are ready for
editing.   You  can  perform  block  operations  by  marking  a  block  and
manipulating  it.   A  block of text is some portion of your text which you
have  delined for the purpose of changing a specific characteristic in some
way.

Buffers
-------

Aside from the screen itself, Professional Page has two additional internal
buffers  to  hold  text  --  the  paste  buffer and the undo buffer.  These
buffers  oeerate in conjunction with block operations.  The paste buffer is
used  to  temporarily  hold  text  in "Cut and Paste" operations.  The undo
buffer temporarily holds deleted blocks of text.

Creating A Block
----------------

While  in  Text  mode, there are several ways of marking a block.  A marked
block is highlighted on the screen in reversed text.  The following methods
can be used:

*  Move  The  Text  pointer  to the word, and double click to mark a single
word.

*  Click  in  a box and select the Edit/Select Box item to mark the visible
contents of the entire box.

*  Click  in a box and select the Edit/Select All item to mark the contents
of an entire series of linked boxes.

*  Click  on the beginning of the box you want marked with the Text pointer
and  drag the pointer to where you want the block to end.  All text between
where you started to drag and where you released the pointer will be marked
as a block.

*  To  mark  a  block  extending from one box to another, or across several
pages, click with the Text tool where you want the block to start.  Move to
the  end of the block (which can be several boxes or several pages from the
beginning),  and  click  while holding the SHIFT key.  All text between the
two clicks will be defined as a block.

Block Operations
----------------

Once  you have marked a block, you can manipulate the block in several ways
with the items in the Edit menu.

Cut
---

Selecting  Edit/Cut  deletes  the  block from the page and places it in the
paste buffer.

Copy
----

Selecting  Edit/Copy  places  a  copy  of  the  block into the paste buffer
without deleting the block frorn the page.

Paste
-----

Click  on  the spot where you want to insert a block from the paste buffer,
and  then  select  Edit/Paste.   The block will be inserted just before the
text cursor position.

Unmark Block
------------

Selecting Edit/Unmark Block umnarks the marked block.

Save Block
----------

Selecting  Edit/Save  Block saves the marked block to disk as an ASCII text
file.   All  typographical information is translated to imbedded formatting
commands before saving.  See Appendix F:  Formatting Text.

NOTE:   This  is  the only way that you can easily save a Professional Page
document as text only, and as such it is a valuable technique to use if you
wish  to  break  a  long text file up into several shorter files, or if you
wish  to  re-edit  a  document  in  a  word processor and re-import it into
Professional Page.

Select Box
----------

Selecting  Edit/Select Box marks all the visible contents of the individual
text box as a block.

Select All
----------

Selecting  Edit/Select  All  marks  all  the contents of a series of linked
boxes as a block.

Find and Replace Operations
---------------------------

The  find  and  replace operations have two functions.  They can be used to
find  and modify text strings in the conventional sense or they can be used
to  find  and  replace  text  with  specific typographical characteristics.
Typographical  codes (see Appendix F:  Formatting Text) are only applied to
the  first  character of the string in the find operation.  The replacement
strig  can  contain  any number of embedded formatting codes.  For example,
you  can  search  for  all  occurrences of the BOLD strig "PPage" (by using
BPPage")  and  replace  them with Italic underlined Helvetica "Professional
Page" (by using "\I\U\ff<Helvetica>Professional Page").

Find
----

Selecting  Edit/Find finds the next occurrence of a particular string.  You
have  the  option of search direction and whether to ignore the case of the
string.

Replace
-------

Selecting  Edit/Replace  replaces  a specified strig with another specified
string.   You have the option of search direction, whether to change one or
all occurrences of the search string, and whether to query each change.

Find Next
---------

Finds the next occurrence of the search string in the indicated direction.

Replace Next
------------

Replaces  the  next  occurrence  of  the  search strig with the replacement
string.   A  query  is  made  if it was selected as a option in the Replace
item.

DELETE OPERATIONS
-----------------

A marked block is deleted by:

* pressing the backspace key.

* typing a character.

* using the paste operation.

The  marked  block  is placed in the Undo buffer and the typed character or
pasted  block  is  placed in the location of the previously marked block on
the screen.  To get the deleted block back, place the text cursor and press
the ESC-key.  The deleted block will be placed in front of the cursor.

Text Boxes
----------

All  text  must  be  placed  into an empty or text box.  Once text has been
placed  into  an empty box, Professional Page marks that box as a text box,
and  will not allow you to put a graphic or a drawing into it.  Conversely,
you cannot enter text into a box already containing a graphic or a drawing.
Text  boxes  can, however, be overlaid on top of graphic and drawing boxes.
Text boxes can be located on a page or on the art board.

Viewing Text
------------

Professional  Page displays text on screen using special screen fonts whjch
simulate  serif  and  sans  serif  fonts.   Screen fonts are displayed with
reasonable  accuracy  for all available fonts found in the fonts directory.
Text  whose  fonts  do  not  have  a screen representation will not display
correctly  in  form,  but  will  be scaled to take up the correct amount of
space on the screen.  For example, to display 30 point Times on the screen,
Professiona] Page will scale the closest available font (likely 24 polnts),
to  the  correct size.  Upon output, the text will be printed in the proper
font  and  size.   Text  can  be  viewed  letter  by  letter  in the hjgher
magnification  levels.   In the lower levels of magnification, text will be
"greeked", that is, shown as lines rather than letters.

Colored Text
------------

Text can be colored using the Ink Color item in the Color menu.  Colors can
be  created  with  the  CreateColor  requester  or  loaded  from an already
established color database on disk (see the Color section).

Transparent and Opaque Text
---------------------------

Text  boxes  can  be  selected as either transparent or opaque by selecting
Box/Alter/Active  and  clicking on the Box Opaque-Transparent gadget.  Text
in  a transparent text box can be overlaid on bitmap and structured graphic
boxes wjthout showing the box and its outline by using this gadget.

Halftone Screens on Text
------------------------

To  cause  text to be output as a screened halfone, select Color/Ink Color,
and   pick   a   gray   value   for  the  type.   Select  Preferences/Print
Specifications/Halftone  Screen to speci@y the Density (lines per inch) and
(in degrees) for the halftone.

BITMAP GRAPHICS
---------------

Professional Page allows you to make use of any compatible bitmap graphics.
Graphics  can  be  any  size, ranging from one pixel to 1024 by 1024 pixels
(depending  on  available  memory),  in  any  resolution mode (Low, Medium,
Intelace,  or  High),  and  with any number of colors from 2 to 4096 at one
time.  See rippendix E:  Examples of Graphics.

Black and White Output
----------------------

Graphics  can be output as black and white halftones in sixteen gray scales
from any PostScript compatible laser printer or typesetting machine.

Color Separated Output
----------------------

With the Professional Color separator color graphics can be color separated
onto  positive  or negative film, or onto positive or negative resin coated
paper from a PostScript compatible typesetting machine such as a Linotronic
100 or 300 typesetter.

Screen Display
--------------

Color  bitmap graphics are not displayed on the Professional Page screen in
color.   An  eight gray-tone representation of the graphic is created.  The
full-color information remains stored on the original data disk.

Importing
---------

An  empty  active  box must be available on the page to receive the graphic
(see Project/Import/Bitmap Graphic in the Technical Reference section).

Default Size
------------

When the graphic is imported, it appears at a default size of 75 pixels per
inch  (for example, a 640 by 400 pixel picture will fill the whole widdh of
an 8.5 inch page).  The graphic can then be rescaled or resized.

Altering the Graphic Parameters
-------------------------------
You   can   crop,  resize,  frame,  and  screen  your  bitmap  graphics  in
Professional  Page.   As  well, you can run text around the graphic box, or
lay black and white or colored text over the graphic.  If you wish to alter
some  feature  of  your  graphic box, make sure the box is active, and then
select the Box/Alter/Active sub-item.  In the requester, you can adjust the
Location,  Margin,  and Graphic Scale of the graphic (see "Box Menu" in the
Technical Reference section).

Location
--------

The precise position of the box on the page can be determined by typing the
location  of  the top left corner of the box and the box's width and height
in the requester that appears when Box/Alter/Active is selected.

Frames and Margins
------------------

Bitmap  graphic  and  text  boxes can be supplied with a structured drawing
frame.   Professional  Page  will  draw  the frame in whatever line weight,
pattern, ink color, and fill color that has been selected from the Draw and
Color  menus.   All boxes can have margins for white space along the inside
edge   of   the   frame.    Frames   and   margins  are  specified  in  the
Box/Alter/Active sub-item.

Cropping
--------

Using  the  handles  on the graphic box, you can adjust the box to cover or
reveal as much of the graphic as you wish.  If you need to move the graphic
within  its box, drag the graphic around with the pointer while holding the
ALT-key  down.  This moves the graphic around inside the box without moving
the box outline.

Sizing
------

To resize the graphic box, hold down the ALT-key and change the size of the
box  by dragging a handle.  Sizing can also be done by changing the Graphic
Scale in the Alter Active Box requester.

Storage
-------

Unlike  text  files or structured drawings, the acutal bitmap graphic isn't
stored  as  part of your document.  Whenever you load or print the document
(whether in black and white or color separated), Professional Page will ask
for the original graphic file from its original data disk.

Aspect Ratios
-------------

You  may  find  that there is a difference between the aspect ratio of your
bitmap  graphic  on  the Professional Page screen and its appearance on the
output.   They  may  appear  slightly  condensed (see "Printing").  You can
correct  this by adjusting the Graphic Scale gadget in the Box/Alter/Active
sub-item.   For example, graphics created in the Medium (640 by 200 pixels)
or  Medium  Interlace  modes  (320  by  400  pixels)  will  appear  on  the
Professional   Page  screen  distorted  but  can  be  corrected  using  the
Box/Alter/Active Graphic Scale gadget.


STRUCTURED DRAWINGS
-------------------

What is a Structured Drawing?
----------------------------

Structured   drawings   are   images   created  from  components  that  are
mathematically  defined.   These components can be lines, arcs, and curves,
each with line weight, line pattern and pattern attributes.

Structured  drawings  are  printed  at the maximum resolution of the output
device,  such  as  300 dpi from a laser printer or as high as 2540 dpi on a
laser  typesetter.   Structured  drawings are often used for computer aided
drawing and design (CAD).

Structured  drawings  are  also  ideal for a designer or typographer.  They
quickly create clean shapes such as lines, cmcles, and patterned fills.

Importing Aegis Draw Plus Files
-------------------------------

Structured  drawings can either be imported into Professional Page from the
Amiga CAD package Aegis Draw Plus, or can be Created with Professional Page
structrred  drawing  tools  and  Color  and  Draw items (see Project/Import
Structured  Drawing  item  and  the  Draw  menu  in the Technical Reference
section).

An  imported  structured  drawing  file  requires an empty active box to be
imported  successfully.   The  drawing  is  fit  into  the  box as large as
possible  and  in the correct proportions.  The box can be resized manually
using the mouse, but to avoid distorting the aspect ratio it is a good idea
to use the Box/Alter/Active sub-item.

Colors
------

A  multi-colored  drawing  will  be  displayed  with the xProfessional Page
screen palette of up to eight colors.  Professional Page documents can have
a total of 127 colors defined for use in structured drawings or text.  (See
the Color section for more details.)

Professional Page Drawing Tools
-------------------------------

The  Drawing  Tools  subpalette  of  the Tools palette contains six drawing
tools.  They are:

*  Line  Tool:   A line is drawn by clicking where the line is to start and
dragging to the end poAnt.

*  Rectangle  Tool:   A  rectangle  is drawn by clicking for one corner and
dragging to the opposite corner.

* Ellipse Tool:  A ellipse is drawn by clicking for the center and dragging
to the corner of the box that will contain the ellipse.

*  Bezier  Curve  Tool:  A Bezier curve is drawn by clicking and dragging a
line  to  represent  the start and end points of the curve, then moving the
pointer  to  "pull" the curve in a rubberband fashion, and then clicking to
anchor the curve.

* Free Hand Tool:  A freehand drawing is made when the left mouse button is
depressed.

* Polygon Tool:  A polygon (series of continuous line segments) is drawn by
clicking  on  a  series  of  points  to  which line segments are connected.
Double click to complete the polygon.

When  drawing  with Professional Page drawing tools, each drawing operation
creates  its  own box.  You can group several structured drawings and merge
them into one box.  Drawings can be freely grouped and merged together, but
they  cannot be subsequently "un-merged" (see "Group Menu" in the Technical
Reference section).

Constraining Keys
-----------------

When  using  Professional  Page  drawing  tools,  holding  down the ALT-key
constrains  the  shapes  drawn  by  the  tools.   Constraining  causes  the
following reactions:

* the Straight Line tool draws only at 45 degree increments.

* the Rectangle tool draws only squares.

* the Ellipse tool draws only circles.

*  the  Bezier  Curve tool places endpoints at 45 degree increments to each
other.

* the Free Hand tool is unaf&ected by the constraint.

* the Polygon tool always produces closed polygons.

Using Attributes
----------------

Structured  drawing  elements  can  be  created  with  attributes like Line
Weight, Line Pattern and Fill Pattern from the DRAW menu as well Line Color
and   Fill   Color   from   the  Color  menu.   The  Frame  gadget  in  the
Box/Alter/Active item automatically draws a structured box outline around a
bitmap graphic or text box.

Attributes of a structured element can be determined in two ways:

*  In  Drawing  mode:  After selecting a drawing tool from the drawing tool
subpalette,  Draw  and  Color  menu  attributes can be set so that the next
element drawn takes on the attributes.

*  In  Null Pointer mode:  The attributes of the active box are in the Draw
and  Color  menus.   Attributes  are  flagged  with  a checkmark beside the
applicable  item or sub-item.  For those cases where there is no checkmark,
select the sub-item to bring up a requester, and the value in the requester
will reflect the value for the active box.  Changing attributes in the Draw
and  Color menus changes the structured drawing or box frame to the current
attribute settings.

NOTE:   A quick way to duplicate drawing parameters for creating additional
elements  is  to  select  the  box  with  the  necessary  attributes before
selecting  one  of  the  drawing  tools.  The drawing tool will take on the
attributes of the active box.

The Draw Menu
-------------

This menu displays the drawing tool parameters for structured drawings.

Line Weight
-----------

Line  weight  is the width of line that a structured drawing is drawn with.
There  are  seven  predefined  settings,  ranging from None to four points.
There  is also a Custom sub-item which allows you to select any line weight
up  to  127  points in 1 /2 point increments.  If you select Custom, a Line
Width  (Pts.):   requester appears.  Delete the current line weight setting
from the text line, and type in the line weight necessary.

Line Pattern
------------

Several  predefined  line  patterns  are available in the Draw/Line Pattern
item.   Any line pattern used by an Aegis Draw Plus drawing can be imported
as a part of the drawing.

Fill Pattern
------------

Several  predefined  fill patterns are available in Draw/Fill Pattern item.
As  with  Line Pattern, you cannot create a custom fill pattern but you can
import  fills  created  with  Aegis Draw Plus.  In Professional Page, fills
larger  than  a  screen  in  the  higher  magnification  modes, will not be
displayed,  but  will  print properly.  Fills are always displayed in lower
magnification modes.

Color Menu
----------

All  of  the structured drawing tools can be colored using the Ink Color or
Fill Color items in the Color menu (see the "Color" section).

NOTES ON USING STRUCTURED TOOLS
-------------------------------

Tracing From Bitmap Graphics
----------------------------

A  bitmap  graphic  can  be  brought  into  Professional Page and used as a
template  for a structured illustration, diagram, or map.  Simply draw over
the  outlines  of  the graphic as desired, using the various drawing tools,
and  then  mop the graphic box to get rid of it.  Merge the elements of the
structured  drawing  into  one  box,  and  finish  it  with type, fills, or
patterns.

Using Snap to Grid
------------------

To get different line segments to join neatly, adjust the Snap to Grid at a
line  setting,  and  set  it On.  It will be much easier to get the ends of
lines  or  curves  to join neatly if they are automatically snapping to the
same grid intersections.

Freehand
--------

It  is  difficult  to  draw  smoothly  with  the Freehand tool, since it is
sensitive  to  even  slight  deviations  of  the  mouse  or drawing tablet.
Rather, use Bezier curves or straight lines when possible.

PRINT
-----

It js easiest to learn and use Professional Page if you have easy access to
a printer to output your pages regularly as you create them.

Output Service Bureaus
----------------------

If  you  do  not  own  a PostScript compatible laser printer or typesetting
machine,  you  can find instant printing or typesetting shops in most major
centers  which  will  sell  PostScript  output  or rent output time.  If an
output  service  does  not have an Amiga to hook up to their printer, it is
possible  to  transmit a Professional Page file as an ASCII PostScript file
to  whatever  personal  computer  the  output service uses (such as a Apple
MacIntosh or an IBM PC) which can then send the file to the printer.

If  you find yourself using a number of output services, make sure that the
output  service  you  are  using  is  loaded  with  all the fonts you need.
Different  companies have different selections of fonts.  Collect different
output  bureaus'  typeface  samplers,  and refer to them regularly (see the
Design section for information regarding the selection of typefaces).

PostScript Compatibility
------------------------

Professional  Page  will  output to any PostScript compatible laser printer
such  as  the  QMS  PS  8OO+  and the Apple LaserWriter, or to a PostScript
compatible  typesetting  machine,  such  as a Linotronic 100 or 300 that is
equipped with a PostScript RIP (Raster Image Processor).

Connecting Your Amiga to a Printer
----------------------------------

For more informmation, see Appendix D:  Connecting Your Amiga to a Printer.

Setting Printer Specifications
------------------------------

Professional  Page  gives you a wide variety of printing options, including
halftone  screening,  a variety of film and paper sizes, and page rotation.
There   are   three   menus  that  affect  printing:   Project,  Page,  and
Preferences.   Some  parameters  affect  the  entire document, while others
afrect individual pages.

Printer Specifications in the Preferences Menu
----------------------------------------------

Adjust the Preferences/Printer Specifications item to let Professional Page
know  what  kind  of output you want from the printer.  You can specify the
size  of  paper or film, whether it is sheets or rolls, whether you want to
print  positive  or  negative, and right reading or reversed.  You can also
specify  the  density and angle of halftone screens for printing graytones,
color bitmap graphics, colored text, and structured graphics.

Printing a Document or a Page From the Project Menu
---------------------------------------------------

Select the Project/Print item to output pages to a PostScript printer.  The
Print  item  has three sub-items:  Current Page, Entire Document, and Thumb
Nail.   For  all  of  these  sub-items  number of copies, where to send the
PostScript  output,  automatic  or  manual feed, proof mode, and whether to
override custom specifications is requested.

Project/Print/Current   Page   will   print  the  current  displayed  page.
Project/Print/Entire  Document  will  print  the  document; allowing you to
specify  the  range  of  pages  to  print (default is the entire document).
Project/Print/Thumb  Nail  will  print  either  4,  9, or 16 pages onto one
output page.

Changing the Printing Specifications of a Single Page
-----------------------------------------------------

You  may  find it useful to change the print specifications of a particular
page.   You  can rotate individual pages, and adjust the scale and position
on the output page or film.

In the Page/Alter/Current requester, select the Output Print Specifications
gadget.  The requester contains a Page Position gadget for viewing the size
and  orientation  of the page.  The printer output dimensions are indicated
by  a white rectangle.  You can also select the X and Y position, and scale
the page.

Type  the  numerical  values for Position, Scale, and Rotation (in degrees)
into  the  appropriate  text lines, and press RETURN after each entry.  The
outline of your modified page will be superimposed over the white rectangle
of the printer's output dimensions to show you what the page will look like
when printed.

6. COLOR...
----------

From  within  the  Professional Page program, you can print black and white
halftones  in  sixteen  gray  shades  from  any PostScript compatible laser
printer  or typesetting machine.  In addition to sophisticated use of black
and  white graphics and text, you can make use of color in the Professional
Page  systen  in  a  variety  of  ways.  This section describes how you can
create  and  maintain  a  color database, and use color within Professional
Page docunments.

Importing and Creating Color Information
----------------------------------------

Professional   Page  provides  facilities  to  manipulate  and  save  color
information for later output using the Professional Color separator.  Color
information can originate from three sources:

*  Amiga  color  bitmap  graphic  images.  Amiga graphics can be created by
painting,  animation,  or  any  IFF compatible graphic programs or by video
digatizers such as Digi-View (see Appendix G:  Using Professional Page with
Other Amiga Products).

*  Structured drawings from CAD programs such as Aegis Draw Plus, which can
have a variety of colored lines and patterns.

* Color information created within Professional Page using the items in the
Color menu.

Displaying Color
---------------

The  Professional  Page  screen can display up to sixteen colors at a time.
Nine of these colors are predefined as shades of gray.  The remaining seven
are  used  to  represent  user  defined  colors.  Full color information is
maintained for the Professional Color separator.

Color Bitmap Graphics
---------------------

Professional  Page  can  import  any  Amiga bitmap picture so long as it is
saved  in  the  IFF  file  standard.  This includes pictures ranging from 1
pixel  square  to 1024 by 1024 pixels.  Any number of colors from 2 to 4096
can  be  used  including  Amiga HAM format pictures.  These bitmaps will be
converted  to  8  grey  levels  for  screen  display  but  all of the color
information  is  retained  by  Professional  Page for later printing.  (See
"Bitmap Graphics" in the Using Professional Page section.)

Aegis Draw Plus Structured Drawings
-----------------------------------

Aegis  Draw  and  Aegis  Draw  Plus  CAD (Computer Aided Design) structured
drawings   can   also  be  imported  into  Professional  Page.   The  color
information in the drawing will be retained, but Professional Page will use
its internal color palette to represent the colors.

Color Created Within Professional Page
--------------------------------------

Color information can be created in Professional Page in a variety of ways.
Professional  Page  maintains  a data base of up to 127 colors which can be
defined  within  the  program and saved to disk.  Colors can be assigned to
text and structured graphics through the Color menu.

Using Color
-----------

Professional  Page  treats  color  much  like  any  style  or typographical
attribute  of  text  (see  "Typography"  in  the  Design section).  It also
affects  the  active  box  in  terms  of frame colors or structured drawing
colors.   Any type, structured drawings, or frames are then depicted in the
chosen Ink color.  Fills are displayed with the Fill Color.

THE COLOR MENU
--------------

The  Color  menu is composed of five items:  Ink Color, Fill Color, Define,
Load,  and  Save (see the "Color Menu" in the Technical Reference section).
You can work with two Professional Page colors simultaneously, one for text
and structured drawing tools, and one for filled patterns.

Ink Color
---------

The  Ink  Color  item  specifies the color of any defined block of text, or
oftext  you  type in with the Text tool.  You can also specify the color of
any  of the structured graphic tools you draw with, or of structured frames
for graphic or text boxes.

By  default,  the ink colors immediately available in Professional Page are
nine  shades of gray, from black to white.  However, if you select the From
List  sub-item,  a  requester  will appear, giving you access to all of the
colors  in  the  current color database.  You can select an already defined
color, or you can define a new ink color of your own using Color/Define.

Fill Color
----------

The Fill Color item works exactly the same as Ink Color item, but it allows
you to specify the color of patterns and fills for structured drawings.

Defining a Color
----------------

You  can  create  almost  any color to use with the Ink Color or Fill Color
items.   If  you  select  Define,  a  requester appears and you can specify
custom colors for display and printing.

RGB Color
---------

Screen  colors are defined in terms of RGB values.  On the left side of the
requester  is a set of Red, Green, and Blue sliders.  These sliders let you
set any color from the Amiga's palette of 4096 colors.  For example, moving
the  Red  and  Green  sliders to the top, and the Blue slider to the bottom
creates a yellow color.

The  color  you  define  appears in the Current Color Display gadget in the
lower  right of the requester.  You can name the color by clearing the Name
text line and typing in the name of the new color.  Ust the standard naming
conventions of your choice.

Yellow, Magenta, and Cyan
-------------------------

In  printing,  yellow/magenta/cyan colors are used.  Below and to the right
of  the RGB sliders are three small text lines labelled Y, M, and C.  These
are  linked  to the RGB slider, and show the color separation equivalent of
the  computer's  video  colors.   The  Yellow, Magenta, and Cyan text lines
allow  you  to  specify  color  information  more  precisely than it can be
displayed  on the screen.  Type in the precise color values ror each of the
three  color  components,  name  the  color, and save it to your document's
Color database.  When color separating the document, the Professional Color
separator  will  generate  the  black, yellow, magenta, and cyan components
from the yellow, magenta and cyan information.

Custom Color and Mechanical Color
---------------------------------

There  are  two  circular  gadgets  in  the  middle  of  the  Color Palette
requester, labelled Custom Color and Mechanical Color.

A  Custom Color is a Yellow, Magenta, or Cyan combination to which you have
assigned  an  arbitrary  screen  color.   For instance, if you have created
three  very  similar  shades of blue by typing in the Y, M, and C values in
the  text  lines,  you can assign them radically different screen colors so
that  the  shades  will be easier to distinguish.  The proper color will be
used in printing.

Mechanical  Color  indicates that the color that you select is not intended
to  be separated into Black, Yellow, Magenta, and Cyan components.  Rather,
any  page  elements  given  a  Mechanical  Color value will be saved as one
completely  separate  color,  for  printing as part of a two or three color
job, or as an extra, solid color in a four color process run.

Loading Colors
--------------

Select  the  Load  item.   This  will  call up a Load Color file requester.
Select  the  disk  drive and directory you have designated for storing your
color  databases,  and  select  the  color  database you wish to load.  See
"Using file requesters" in the Technical Reference section.

Saving Colors
-------------

When  you  select  Save, a file requester appears.  Select a disk drive and
directory, and save the new color database.
