1. INTRODUCTION TO UROPA2



1.1  BACKGROUND



Intercorp is the largest galactic peace keeping force in our Galaxy. 
During the intergalactic wars, damage to a vast majority of their 
defense systems was sustained. When the wars had ceased, repair 
work began. 



The moon of Europa, which orbits the planet of Jupiter, was 
partially destroyed during the wars. Intercorp decided to re-build the 
moon.  The rebuilt moon was named 'Uropa2' and because of it's 
strategic position, has been set up as a major link in 
communications and detection of hostile fleets entering our solar 
system.



There are twelve bases, scattered across Uropa2, which are the 
control centres for the Moon's detection systems.  Each of these 
bases generate their own internal atmosphere through use of 
oxygenator machines.  These oxygenators are required to sustain 
human life inside the bases without the use of oxygen suits.



Uropa2's detection systems were placed under the control of human 
colonists. These colonists have no weapons or defence training 
and as a result of their peaceful nature, the protection of the colony 
was charged to Tekite and Kapone droid warriors.



The Kapones have rebelled against Intercorp and have gained 
command of the moon.  Communications with the moon have 
ceased and the fate of the Colonists is unknown. It would seem that 
the Kapones are acting as mercenaries for one of Intercorps 
intergalactic enemies and have been tasked with the destruction of 
Uropa2.





1.2  OBJECTIVE



Time is limited. You have twenty-four hours to restore the 12 
Bases.  Failure to do so in this time will mean the depletion of the 
Uropan atmosphere and the death of any remaining colonists.



Your overall game objective involves three related tasks, which 
must be completed for each base on the Uropa2 moon.



∑	To rescue as many of the colonists as possible from each 
base.  They should be returned to your Star Ship above the 
planets surface via the main transporter room for each base.	 
This is necessary so that they may be returned to their 
normal functions on Uropa2 once the battle for its control has 
been won.



∑	To repair the oxygenator in each base on the moon and 
enable restoration of the atmosphere for that base. To do 
this you will have to seek out each oxygenator control room, 
repair and activate the oxygenator if necessary. Each control 
room has a password which is supplied on a corresponding 
key. This key should be present in the base, but most likely 
the Kapones will have hidden it.



∑	To destroy all Kapone warriors within each base. If you fail to 
do this, it will prevent the safe return of the colonists at a 
later time.



There will be a number of smaller base dependant objectives 
involved in getting to the final stage.



You have been supplied with a laser sword for use in stunning the 
Kapones, but it will be necessary to obtain more powerful weapons 
in your quest to restore Uropa2.



For travel between bases, we have managed to obtain an Eagle 5 
hovar. It appears in good working order and should enable you to 
travel from base to base quickly. You need all your skills to survive 
any enemy attacks however.



So, as your Commissioner says, "Be careful out there".



 



2.  GENERAL SPECIFICATIONS



The game is divided into two main sections.



Firstly, each base on the moon is represented by isometric 3D 
graphics. The view will be of you in each room as you wander 
around the base. Each base is located under ground and can only 
be entered by transport from a floating base station on the moons 
surface. 



The second section involves the moons surface. It is represented 
by 3D vector light-sourced graphics. The view will be from inside 
your Hovar vehicle looking out. This is the only way to travel from 
base to base.



Each base station on the surface provides the link between a base 
and your hovar. Transportation from a base to the base station will 
enable you to replenish your hovar before embarking on base to 
base travel.





2.1  DASHBOARD DISPLAY



2.1.1 STATUS BARS



There are two status bars, one on the left and one on the right of 
the dash. The left bar indicates your current energy level. When full 
it will be a complete long green bar. When your energy reaches a 
critical low level it will begin to flash red.  If this occurs, it's time to 
bail out of any battle you are fighting.



The bar on the right indicates the status of the current weapon you 
are carrying. In the case of the standard laser whip, it indicates the 
current energy level, but with other weapons it will indicate the 
weapon temperature.  When it reaches minimum effectiveness it 
will begin to flash red and the fire rate will slow until it cools down 
again.



2.2 DASH ICONS



There are six operational icons on the dashboard. These icons are 
selected by clicking on them with the mouse or by using the 
matching keyboard function keys. (See 6.1.1)



The icons from the far left are: Communications, Load/Save/Info, 
Status, Weapon select, Inventory and Base map.



2.2.1 COMMUNICATION ICON



Selecting this icon will bring up a display of all the current 
messages you have received. These may be internal or external 
messages depending on how you obtained them.



This icon will flash when a broadcast message has been received. 
Simply click on the gadget to bring up the communication window. 
The left list of names refers to the disks or broadcast messages to 
read. If the message is from a message disk, then it will say "DISK". 
If the message is from a broadcast reception, then it will say 
"BCST". The number after each of these refers to the datestamp 
associated with that message.





Selecting one of the messages in the list will be highlighted and the 
message will be displayed in the read area on the right. You can 
use the gadget scroll bar and up/down gadgets to view long 
messages.



2.2 LOAD/SAVE/INFO ICON



2.2.1 GENERAL INFORMATION



This icon will bring up the information window. This window 
displays information regarding your general status on the left and 
the personal modules you are currently using on the right. The 
information supplied is as follows;



∑	Current room

The name of the room you are currently in.

∑	Credits

The amount of credit you have. You must have a 
credit card before you can collect and use credits. 
Some computer systems will not function until you 
insert a credit card.



∑	Data Downloaded

The amount of data that you have downloaded from 
enemy droids. See section 3.7.1



∑	Order ranking

This is your ranking from 1 to 100. It represents how 
well you are doing in the game. Once you have 
reached number one, you have attained the highest 
accolade a Tekite can reach.



∑	Time left

The time you have left to complete the current 
mission. Failure to do so will result in the destruction 
of the moon and the Tekite empire.



∑	Legal status

Your current legal status could either be "lawful", 
"rogue", or "criminal". Inadvertent shooting of 
colonists will bring about a "rogue" rating. Continual 
killing of colonists will inevitably bring the wrath of 
other Tekites upon you.



∑	Colonists left

The current number of colonists left in the base to 
save.



∑	Kapones left

The number of Kapones left in the base to destroy or 
capture.





2.2.2 LOAD/SAVE



Selecting either of these gadgets will bring up a file requester. This 
allows you to save or load the game at it`s present stage. Note that 
the gameplay still continues while the requester is displayed.



2.2.3 PREFS



Selecting this gadget will bring up the preferences window. You can 
control some in-game functions such as the sound effects and your 
Centurion name. The default name is "Blackbeard".



The non-active window pause mode is used whenever you want to 
switch to the Workbench screen and automatically pause the game.

When you click the left mouse button in the game window, the 
game will resume.



2.2.4 INFO



Selecting this gadget will bring up information on the selected 
personal module, shown by a red box around the module area on 
the right side of the window.



2.2.4.1 PERSONAL MODULES INFORMATION



There are up to eight different personal enhancement modules that 
can be attached to you.  Some of these are;



∑	Map sensor.

Used to display information about objects when the 
map is displayed.



∑	Energy enhancer.

This module will decrease the energy drain when 
being attacked.



∑	Energy regenerator.

This module increases your energy at an accelerated 
rate.



∑	Graviwarp.

This module is used to increase your height 
momentarily.



∑	Optic enhancement.

The optic module increases your perception of 
holographic images.









2.3 WEAPON INVENTORY ICON



This icon will bring up a window containing your current inventory of 
weapons, weapon enhancements and rounds of ammunition.



The top row of selection boxes can each contain a weapon. The 
small indent bar above each of these boxes indicates the amount of 
effectiveness the weapon has. The bar below each of these boxes 
indicates the rounds of ammunition that weapon contains.



The second row of selection boxes can each contain up to nine (9) 
weapon enhancement modules. Each of these modules can be 
attached to any of the weapons in the above row.



To add a weapon enhancement to a weapon, you click on the box 
containing the enhancement, and by dragging the mouse whilst 
holding the left mouse button down, you move the icon image of 
that module over to the weapon you wish to enhance. Simply let go 
of the left mouse button  once you have the enhancement icon over 
that weapon, it will then be attached to that weapon.



Each weapon may be reloaded with ammunition via the reload 
button at the bottom of the window. Simply select the weapon you 
wish to reload by clicking on it's box, then press the reload button.



2.4 WEAPON SELECT ICON



Each weapon contained in your weapon inventory (See 2.3) can be 
selected for use by clicking on this icon. Next to each of these icons 
will be a number referring to the amount of ammunition left in that 
weapon, except for the laser sword (the weapon given to you by 
default), which uses no ammunition as such.



2.5 INVENTORY



Selecting this icon will bring up the inventory window. This window 
contains all the objects you carry in the main inventory hold. Each 
box in the window can contain one object that was either found or 
bought. 



Selecting an object in the inventory will cause a simple descriptive 
text to be displayed in the beveltext box towards the bottom of the 
window. Once an object is selected, you may then proceed to use, 
insert or drop that object.



Insertion of most objects can only be achieved by being physically 
next to a computer with special object access. In most cases, a 
message will be displayed within the  window if an error occurred 
during insertion. If you are not next to a computer or accessible 
device, then the insertion gadget will be disabled.



Using an object is more commonly done with objects that have a 
special interface, such as the T.E.D (Timed Explosive Device) or 
the LockPik Device (See 4.1). Any object that can not be used, will 
bring up an error message.



Weapons Cannisters (blue cannisters), and Weapon Enhancement 
modules (yellow cannisters) will first appear in your inventory.  
Selecting any of these cannisters and then pressing the use button 
will cause the item to be transferred to your Weapons Inventory 
ready for use. (See 2.3).



Personal Enhancement modules (red cannisters) also appear firstly 
in the inventory, "using" these cannisters will activate them and 
they will appear on the Personal modules in the General 
Information window (See  2.2).



Objects can be dropped just about anywhere. If there is no space to 
drop the object, then the drop gadget will be disabled. 



NOTE: By dropping the T.E.D. You actually activate the device. Be 
careful...



2.6 BASE MAP ICON



Activating this icon will bring up the base map window. This window 
will display the current map of the base you have currently 
explored.  You can zoom in and out using the IN/OUT gadgets. The 
CENTRE gadget will re-draw the map with the room in the centre of 
the map being the current room you are in.



You can scroll around the current base area by using the arrow 
gadgets. The size of this scroll area depends upon the amount of 
the base area you have explored.



3. BASE ROOMS



3.1 TRANSPORTER



The first room you will start at will be the transporter room. From 
this room you can travel back to the StarShip, Base Station (on the 
surface) or to any other translink rooms. To transport, you need to 
access the transport computer located in the room. Use the access 
gadget when the transport window appears and select you 
destination. 



Once the transporter starts, you should hear the sound of the 
transporter device working. You must be standing in the centre 
area defined by the four transporter pylons to be transported. 



You may transport any creature/droid using this device.



3.2 SUPPLY



Most bases will have a supply room from which to purchase 
miscellaneous goods. These rooms will contain various items from 
food to personal enhancement devices.



To use buy goods from this room, you need to have a U.C.C. 
(Uropa Credit Card). Insert this card into the supply computer to get 
access to the supply menu. Supply menu will list the item types 
available in the current room. Selecting one of the item types will 
then bring up a sub-menu which will list all the items of that type 
with the prices and quantity available. Selecting on each item will 
add one to the amount you want whilst subtracting the quantity left. 
The total price will increase accordingly.



You may either accept the order or cancel at this stage. Once an 
order has been accepted, the items will be placed in you inventory 
and credits deducted from you credit card. If there is no room left in 
you inventory for these items, then an error message will appear.



3.3 SECURITY



Each base has areas which require security access. The doors 
could either be locked or unlocked according to the security 
computer status in the room. 

If a security door is locked, you can either walk through by having 
the base ID card in you possession, by blowing open the door, or 
by using a Lock pick device.



Once inside the room, accessing the security computer will allow 
you to lock or unlock the doors. Colonists will only come through 
these doors if they are unlocked, whereas Kapones have security 
access to most of the rooms in the base.



3.4 LIVING QUARTERS AND WORKERS QUARTERS



These rooms are quite common and are the places where most 
colonists will be found. They may contain objects hidden by the 
colonists when the base was attacked and by searching all the 
objects in a room, you may find something which could be of use.



3.5 OXYGENATOR CONTROL



The oxygenator control room is usually guarded by some Kapones. 
These will have to be destroyed before accessing the control 
computer. Once you access the computer, you will need to enter 
the oxygenator control code found on the appropriate key. This key 
may be given to you, or hidden somewhere within the base.



Once you enter the code, you will have access the control menu. If 
the oxygenator is working, then you can enable it, by selecting the 
<enable oxygenator>  option.



If it is not working and requires repair, you can select the <examine 
oxygenator> option. This will give a detailed examination of the 
oxygenator sections and a report on the findings. Once you have 
determined the fault(s), you will need to repair the unit, and then 
return to this menu.



3.6 OXYGENATOR



The oxygenator unit supplies oxygen for the entire base. The repair 
of this unit is vital to the success of the each mission you perform.



The oxygenator may be faulty and require repair. You may need to 
find the fault by accessing the control computer in a nearby room. 
(See 3.5) Once the fault has been determined and you have 
worked out the object(s) required for repair, you may insert them 
into the unit to activate the auto-repair sequence.



3.7 INTELLIGENCE EXCHANGE CENTRE (IEC)



These rooms contain computer units which let you gain credits for 
information. It is a U.C.C. device and therefore requires the 
insertion of a credit card. Any information you have from 
downloaded droids (See 3.7.1) can be uploaded into these 
computers.



Most bases will give around 1 (one) credit for each megabyte of 
data uploaded.



3.7.1 DOWNLOADING DATA



Data can be downloaded from most droids once they have been 
stunned (See 4.1.1). Access to a droid after stunning will bring up 
the download window. Select the start gadget to initiate to 
download procedure. As the data is transferred, a bar indicates the 
progress. Once the data has been downloaded, the droid may be 
destroyed by minimal shots to its shell.



3.8 ARMORY



The ARMORY room is similar in operation to the supply room (See 
3.2). By inserting your credit card, you may access the available 
items for purchase. Once these items have been selected from the 
menu, they will appear in the weapon holder units nearby. 



To pick up the objects from purchase, you need to access the 
appropriate holder and take the objects inside. If your inventory is 
full, you will get an error message.



4. GAME FIGHTING



4.1 BATTLING AND WEAPONS



Battles are the most predominant occupation for the Tekite droid. 
The better the weapon(s) a Tekite has, the greater the chance of 
defeating the Kapone empire.



4.1.1 LASER SWORD



This is the weapon that most Centurions will have. It is the weapon 
that is supplied to you before transportation down to the first base. 
It is a simple weapon and is one of the few that can cause droid 
stunning. It uses low power and provides an effective means of 
destroying Kapones.  This weapon is a single beam, chest firing 
weapon with a short range.



The sword supplies an electrical charge to its tip, this can be used 
to damage the control of enemy droids.  When droids are damaged 
they will become erratic in their movement for a short time.  If you 
continue to use the sword on them in this state you will eventually 
destroy their internal circuitry causing them to become inactive.  
When they are in this state, you may access their download 
circuitry and perform a data download. (See 3.7.1)



4.1.2 PHASER GUN



The phaser gun is a fast single shot firing gun that supplies short  
phaser blasts from the chest centre.  It is a longer range weapon 
and has more power in its shots than the sword but is not able to 
stun, only destroy.  It can be quite useful when fully enhanced. 



4.1.3 BLASTER



The blaster is a very good weapon for quick battles. It uses a twin 
firing mechanism from the Tekites arms and is best used with both 
shots lined up on an enemy.  It has far more power then a phaser 
but over-heats quicker.  This weapon will quickly dispose of most 
enemy droids.



4.1.4 MEGA-BLASTER



The Mega-Blaster is a similar weapon to the blaster but fires six 
blasts at a time in a spread fashion.  This is very useful when 
attacking or defending against multiple enemies.  However care 
should be taken if you have allies in the same room as they spread 
effect may hit them.



4.1.5 FLAME THROWER



This weapon will fire a blast of flame from both arms.  It is very 
effective in short range combat destroying most enemy very 
quickly.  However, without a heat resistant barrel it is only usable 
for a few shots. It is also limited by range.



4.1.6 DISRUPTER



The disrupter fires a twin ball of plasma from the Tekites arms.  
This will have a similar effect on the enemy as the sword.  However 
the disrupter is a long range weapon and far more powerful.  It is 
quite capable of damaging a Kapones circuitry with a single hit.



4.1.7 ROCKETS



The Tekite is capable of rocket fire similar to that of the Kapone 
warrior.  Also like the Kapone, only one arm can launch a rocket at 
one time.



4.1.8. DESTRUCTA BOLT



This is the most powerful weapon of them all. It is a long range 
weapon which fires a bolt from both arms at the same time.  This 
weapon has a two-phase firing method.  The first phase builds up 
the strength of the bolt, and the second phase fires the bolt.  If its is 
fired immediately without a build up of power then its will only be of 
equivalent power to the Mega-Blaster (4.1.4).  However when 
allowed time to build to full strength (about 2 seconds) it has more 
power then a rocket and will destroy all enemies currently known to 
by Tekite Intelligence.



4.2	WEAPON ENHANCEMENTS



There are eight different weapon enhancements. Any combination 
or all of these can be added to any weapon.  Adding enhancements 
to a weapon is explained in section 2.3. 

Some of these are;



∑	Auto-Fire

This will enable the weapon to fire continuously by 
holding down continuously on the fire button.  Without 
this added, it will be necessary to continually press 
the button for a weapon to fire.



∑	Weapon Coolant

This enhancement allows the weapon to cool down a 
lot quicker.



∑	Heat-resistant barrel

This enhancement will stop the weapon from heating 
up quickly. It allows more shots to fire before the 
weapon starts to over-heat.



5. BASE STATION



Each base station floats above its corresponding base which is 
buried deep underground. Each station contains holding bays for 
hovar vehicles, maintenance depots and supply terminals.



By moving the mouse over the presented screen, you can select 
one any of three actions that may be performed whilst in a base 
station. 



These are;



∑	Beam down to the base below. Your hovar is left in the base 
	station while you go about your mission.



∑	Access a computer terminal for operations such as weapon 
	supply and hovar maintenance. Follow the menu options and

	make sure you have enough credits!



∑	Transport your hovar down to the surface for travel to 
	another base.



While on the moons surface, all that is required to beam into a base 
station is to position your hovar under  a base station, come to a 
complete stop and wait for a few seconds. The transporter needs a 
steady subject for matter transformation.
