        ======================================================
        
                                                TYPED BY SHARD - DTL        
CONTENTS
--------

Your  UFO  Enemy  Unknown  package  should contain a Player's Handbook, this
Technical Supplement, a set of 3.5" game disks and a registration card.

REQUIRED EQUIPMENT
------------------

.Computer
UFO  Enemy  Unknown  requires a Commodore A1200/ A4000 with at least 2 Mb of
RAM, AGA chipset and Workbench 3,0 or better.

.Controls
You can play UFO Enemy Unknown entirely from the Keyboard and Mouse.

DISK DRIVES
-----------

UFO  Enemy  Unknown  can  be  played  from  copies  of the 3.5" game disks. 
However, the game works best if installed onto a hard disk drive.

You  are  advised not to play from the original UFO Enemy Unknown disks.  If
you  attempt  to  play  from  the original disks they may become permanently
altered.

To make back-up disks, follow the procedure below:-

1. Load Workbench

2. Locate  an  icon  called Shell (in the System drawer of your Workbench
   disk)

3. Double click on this icon to open an AmigaShell window

4. Type "DISKCOPY ?"

5. Place your original game disk into the internal drive

6. At the prompt, type "DF0: TO DF0:" and press the Return Key

7. Follow  the on-screen instructions and repeat steps 4, 5 and 6 for all
   the disks.

COPY PROTECTION
---------------

UF0 Enemy Unknown has no disk copy protection.  This means that you can copy
the game files onto blank disks or install the files from the original disks
to  a  hard  disk.    However, the progranm asks you to enter an eight-digit
number  from  the Player's Handbook.  This number can be found in the bottom
left  of  the  requested page.  MicroProse regrets that casual and organised
software  piracy  requires  that  we  retain  this  minimal  form  of   copy
protection.

INSTALLATION
------------

UFO  Enemy  Unknown has been left unprotected for your convenience in making
back  up  copies  and  when  playing  from  a  hard  drive.  However, making
additional  copies  to  give away or sell is a Copyright Violation.  See the
Copyright Notice in the Player's Handbook.

INSTALLING ON HARD DISK
-----------------------

Boot up vour hard disk as nornmal and insert UFO Enemy Unknown Disk 3.  Open
this disk and double click on the "INSTALL UFO" icon.

You  will be given several options during Installation - select "Procced" at
all  times.    A  drawer  will  be created on your hard disk, containing all
necessary files.

MAKING A BOOT DISK FOR HARD DISK USERS
--------------------------------------

If you have an A1200 with a Hard Disk and a maximum of 2 Mb of RAM, you will
need  to  use a Boot Disk.  You will ueed a blank floppy disk ready when you
install the game.
 
Follow  the on Screen prompts and the Installation Programme will create the
Boot Disk for you during the Installation process.

your Amiga.

double-click on the "UFO" icon

SAVING GAMES
------------

Floppy Disk
Games or game configuration files are saved onto a save game disk.  You will
need a pre-formatted floppy disk called "UFOsaves".

Hard Disk
Games  or  game  configuration files are saved into the "UFO" drawer on your
hard drive.

OPERATING PROBLEMS
------------------

Memory
IMPORTANT:  If  you  have  insufficient  graphics  memory, you may encounter
graphics  or  sound  problems.  If this happens you must remove all external
peripherals  and try again.  You may not be able to play from the hard drive
if  the  problems  persist  after removing external drives etc (See Making a
Boot Disk).

Virus
Computer  viruses  can  also cause problems with graphics and sound.  There
are  many virus checking utitities available that can be used to check for a
virus.    Also,  pirated  copies of games are an incredibly common source of
virus problems.  It always pays to own

UPDATES AND ENHANCEMENTS FOR THE AMIGA VERSION OF UFO ENEMY UNKNOWN

each  wound decreases Health by one point per turn.  If Health reaches zero,
the soldier dies from the wounds incurred.

Fatal Wounds

used to heal Fatal Wounds.

swing  in  the  alien's  favour.   If the Morale falls below 50, the soldier
could panic.

opportunity  fire - taking a shot during the alien's turn (see section 3,2,6
of the Player's Handbook for full details).

gains battle experience.

Amp in mental combat.

EXPLANATION OF TERMS
--------------------

AmigaDOS
This  is  the  Operating  System used by the Amiga computer.  The operatinng
system  tells  the  respective  parts  of  the  computer  what to do when it
receives a command from programs.

AmigaShell
This  is  a  direct  way  of  issuing commands to the AmigaDOS.  It can be a
little  confusing  or  daunting as the syntax for commands must be accurate.
It is advisable to be famniliar with as many Shell commands as possible.

Kickstart
This  is  the  bulk of the Amiga operating system and is stored on a chip in
the computer.  There are three major versions, 1.3, 2.x, and 3.x.

WorkBench
This  is  a  graphic  interface  for  AmigaDOS.   It consists of small icons
(pictures)  that  replace  the  sometimes  complex  commands  used  in   the
AmigaShell.    WorkBench  was  designed  very much with user-friendliness in
mind.

Peripherals
Any external add-on such as a disk drive that plugs into your Amiga.
