MENUTITLE PROJECT:
-----------------

NEW
Opens  a new, empty sheet window.  This sheet will receive the name "Sheet1"
(1,2...)  and  the  standard  settings.      If   a   file   with   the name
"S:TurboCalc.CFG"  exist,  it  will  be loaded and the settings and also the
contents  will  be  taken  over into the new sheet.  In this way the user is
able  to  define his personal standard settings and stan- dard sheets (refer
to <Options-Config-Save>).

OPEN
Opens  a new sheet window and loads an already existing TurboCalc sheet.  If
this  item  is  called from a new sheet, where no input has been done so far
(e.g.    after  a  <Project-New> or the start of TurboCalc) the opened sheet
will  be  loaded  in this window (this will avoid the confusing, unnecessary
<Sheet1>  window,  if  a  file  is  loaded  right  after  the  start).   The
standard-file  requester  of  Commodore  will  be opened and the file can be
selected  with  the  mouse.   Select the path and file name with a click and
confirm with >Ok< (For detailed usage, see user manual of your Amiga).

CLOSE
Closes  the  current  sheet and all corresponding windows.  If there are any
changes  since  the  last  saving,  a  re-  quester  will be opened with the
possibility to save the file before closing or to abort the whole operation.
If  you  try  to close the last sheet window, TurboCalc will ask you, if you
really want to quit or whether a new, empty sheet window should be opened.

SAVE
Saves  the  sheet under its current name (this is the name by which the file
was  loaded,  or  by  which it was saved the last time - it is shown as menu
title).    If  this  file is a new one and has not been saved yet (e.g.  the
name is Sheet1), <Save as> is automatically called so that you can determine
a file name.

SAVE AS
Saves  the  sheet  as  a  TurboCalc-sheet on diskette or hard- disk...  .The
standard-file  requester  of  Commodore  appears  to enter the file name and
path.  The new name will be used as new sheet name (for the next <Save>) and
also be shown in the window title.

IMPORT FROM
ProCalc  -  SYLK  (Excel)  - CSV (ASC) Allows the import (loading) of sheets
which have not been created by TurboCalc A requester is opened to select the
desired file.  (For de- tails see appendix "Foreign Formats")

EXPORT TO
SYLK  (Excel)  - CSV (ASC) Tab This menu item allows to save the data of the
current  sheet  in  a foreign format, so it can be used by other pro- grams.
This is the counterpart of <Project-Import from>.

PRINT
This  opens  a window to set some printing parameters and the gadget <Print>
down  on  the  left,  which starts the print-out.  For further settings also
refer to <Format- Print Format> and <Options-Print Range>.  A description of
all possible parameters can be found in the user manual.

ABOUT
Gives information about version number, author and dis- tributor.

ICONIFY
With  this  item  all  TurboCalc-windows  will  be  closed temp- orarily and
TurboCalc  will be put to the background.  On the workbench a TurboCalc-icon
(up  to  kickstart  1.3:  a  window)  appears.    With a double click on it,
TurboCalc  is  "awakened"  again.    The windows will be opened as they were
before  the  iconification  and  the work can be continued.  From OS2.0, you
will  also find an entry in the workbench menu "Tools".  Its selection calls
TurboCalc  again.  This can be very meaningful if you have started TurboCalc
on  the  workbench and you decide to do something else for a while.  In this
case  you  can  hide  TurboCalc and work with the workbench.  If you want to
continue  your  work  with  TurboCalc, a double click on the above mentioned
icon (or window) or a simple menu selection will be suf- ficient.

QUIT
This  menu  item  terminates  the  work  with TurboCalc.  If you have opened
unsaved  sheets  you will be reminded that you still have the possibility to
save them.

MENUTITLE EDIT:
--------------

CUT
Copies  the  marked  range  into  the  intermediate memory (for <Paste>) and
empties the selected cells.This operation can be made undone with <Paste>.

COPY
Copies  the  marked  range  into  the intermediate memory (for <Paste>).  In
contrast to <Cut> the source range is not changed by this operation.

PASTE
Inserts  the  buffer,  which  was created by <Cut> or <Copy>, at the current
position  -  already  filled cells will be overwritten.  If a block has been
marked  before  <Paste>, exactly this block will be filled up now.  If it is
smaller than the copied range, the superfluous part will be left out.  If it
is  larger, the copied range will be added, as often as necessary, beside or
below,  until  the  block  is filled.  While inserting formulas the relative
cell  references  will be adapted automatically.  This can also be performed
between  different  sheets,  that  means  <Copy> in one sheet and <Paste> in
another - to transport the data.

PASTE ONLY
With  this  command  you  can  paste only a part of the infor- mation of the
block  you  have  cut  or  copied  (e.g.  only the values or the formatting)
FORMAT:  Only the format of the block is pasted to the new block, the values
and  the  formulas  of the new range will not be changed.  This is useful if
you  want  to refor- mat a range.  VALUES: With this command only the values
will  be pasted.  (Existing formulas of the new block will be removed).  The
format  of the new block will be kept.  VALUES & FORMULAS: With this command
only  the  values  and  the formulas will be pasted.  The old format will be
kept.  This is useful to copy data to an already formatted block.  It is the
counterpart to Format; both together re- sult in <Paste>.

CLEAR CONTENTS
Deletes  parts  of  the information of the marked block or the current cell:
ALL:  Deletes  the  whole  cell  inclusive its formats.  This corresponds to
<Cut>,  but the range will not be copied to the buffer and therefore <Paste>
is not possible.  FORMAT: Deletes all format instructions and puts them back
to  standard;  the  cell  contents and the formula stay preserved.  FORMULAS
(VALUES  REMAIN):  Deletes  only  existing  formulas.    The value which was
calculated by the formula stays pre- served (see hint).  VALUES: Deletes the
complete  contents  (that  means  values and formulas) - only the formatting
stays preserved.

REMOVE CELLS
Removes  cells,  complete  columns or rows.  A window for the selection (and
for  a  security  request) appears.  COMPLETE COLUMNS: Deletes the column in
which the cursor is located and all columns, which belong to one block.  The
other  columns  move up accordingly.  COMPLETE ROWS: Like "Columns", but for
rows.    BLOCK  LEFT: Deletes the block (or the current cell) and shifts all
data  on  the  right of the block automatically to the left.  BLOCK UP: Like
"Block  left", but only the data below will be shifted upwards.  At the same
time  all  relative cell references will be adapted in a way that they refer
to  the  correct  cells.    (A  reference  to  a deleted cell is replaced by
#REFERENCE!).

INSERT CELLS
Inserts  (in  contrast  to  <Remove cells>) cells or complete columns/rows. 
COMPLETE  COLUMN:  Inserts one column (or a few, correspond ing to the block
width)  at  the  cursor/block  position.    The  other   columns   move down
accordingly.  COMPLETE ROWS: Like above, but for rows.  BLOCK RIGHT: Inserts
an  empty field in size and place of the block (or current cell), and shifts
all  data  below  and to the right of the block automatically to the right. 
BLOCK DOWN: Like above, but the data will be shifted down wards.

FILL
Fills in a block according to the entry of the first cell.

INSERT DATA
TURBOCALC  -  PROCALC  -  SYLK  (EXCEL)  -  CSV  (ASC)  With  this menu item
previously  saved  sheets  can  be  in-  serted into the current one: A file
requester  appears  to select the file, which will then be inserted from the
cur-  rent  cursor  position  on  (or  from  the top left corner of a marked
range).  "TurboCalc" is the standard file-format of TurboCalc, which is read
with <Project-Open> and written with <Project-Save>.  All others are foreign
formats.

SAVE BLOCK AS
SYLK  (EXCEL)  -  CSV  (ASC) TAB - CSV (ASC) This menu item works similar to
<Project-Save as> or <Project-Export as>, but only the current block will be
saved as a new sheet.  Hence, parts of the sheet can be saved as a new sheet
or as data (e.g.  in the format CSV for a word-processing program).

TRANSPOSE
This  instruction  transposes  a  square range, that means the block will be
mirrored at the diagonal.


TRANSLATE FORMULAS
  TO GERMAN
  TO ENGLISH
TurboCalc  allows  the  input of formula- and macro-instruc- tions in German
and  English.    With  these two instructions the formulas and macros can be
transferred to the appro- priate language.

MENUTITLE COMMAND:
-----------------

PASTE
FORMULA, MACRO AND NAME
Inserts  a  formula, a macro instruction or a definite name into the current
input  cell  and changes automatically to the editing mode.  A window with a
list  of  all  existing  formulas (with pa- rameters) appears.  With a click
upon a formula and >Ok< the formula will be inserted at the current position
(if you have not started an input yet, a "=" will be inserted automatically,
which  is  obligatory  at  the  beginning of each formula).  If the inserted
formula needs a parameter, the cursor will be located behind the "(" opening
bracket, otherwise the cursor can be found behind the ")" closing bracket.

DEFINE NAMES
Here,  names  for  cells, ranges or constant data can be de- termined.  This
instruction  is also used to change or de- lete names!  This is of advantage
if you deal with frequently used cells/ranges.  It facilitates the input and
readability.    (e.g.  totalkm for C10 and in C12: =0.5*totalkm) To define a
name a window appears, where all existing names are listed on the left side.
On  the  right side, there are two text fields: the first is >Name< with the
(new)  name  and  the  second is >Contents< with the con- tents, that is (or
should be) assigned to the name.  In the >Type<-field, you can determine the
type  of ob- ject, which receives the specified name (macro, criteria, etc).
With  a  click  on >Ok<, this assignment (name->contents) will be stored (if
the  name  has  already  been  defined  be-  fore,  the old contents will be
overwritten).    The  same is done by >Add<, but the window stays opened for
further entries.  >Delete< will delete the current name from the list, if it
existed  there.   With a click on an entry of the list, names- and contents-
fields  will  be changed according to the entry (like this, an easy changing
or deleting is possible).

FIND
Allows  the search for a special string in formulas and texts of the sheet. 
If  the  operation  was successful, the cursor will be moved into this cell,
otherwise  it  remains  unchanged.    If  a block is selected, the search is
limited to the cells within the block.  The following window is opened:

TEXT: Here, you enter the text which shall be searched for.

BY  ROWS/  BY  COLUMNS:  Determines  if  TurboCalc  searches   linewise   or
columnwise.  The standard search is line-by- line, but if you want to search
in a database-column, it is advisable to select columns.

COMPARE  PART/ALL: Using "Part" it is sufficient that the text -as a part of
a  text  or  formula- is a component of a cell.  if you have selected "All",
the text must be identi- cal in all characters.

CASE  SENSITIVITY:  If  selected,  capitalization and use of initial letters
must  be  same,  otherwise  it  is  sufficient,  if  only  the  letters  are
corresponding.

GOTO
Opens a window that allows to change the current cell.  Se- lect a name from
the list or enter the cell or the block (or the name) directly.

Hint: Instead of selecting this menu item, you can also press <F5> or simply
click  on  the  "status-field" (i.e.  the field the cell-position is printed
in).

SHOW ACTIVE CELL
Scrolls  the  visible  range,  so that the current cell is visible again (In
case  the  screen has been scrolled be- fore with the scrollbars at the left
and bottom margin).

RECALCULATE
Recalculates  the  sheet  with  all  its  formulas.  Above all, this is very
useful if >automatic recalculation< (in <Option-Sheet>) is switched off.

MENUTITLE FORMAT:
----------------

With  the help of the following instructions you can deter- mine the sheet's
format,  that  means the appearance of cells or cell ranges.  All menu items
refer  to  the  current cell, or if a block is marked to that block (thus to
all cells of the block).

If  complete  rows or columns are marked (e.g.  with a click on the line- or
column titles) and a certain format is se- lected afterwards, the formatting
only  refers to the occu- pied cells of this range.  The corresponding line-
or  col- umn format will be changed accordingly.  If you create new cells in
this row or column (e.g.  text input), they will be formatted accordingly.

NUMERIC FORMAT
With  "numeric  format"  you  determine  the  format  that should be use for
displaying  numbers,  time, date.  For this purpose, the following window is
opened:  On  the left you find some gadgets.  Selecting one of these gadgets
sets  the  list  to  the  beginning  of the appropriate numeric type (normal
notation,  scientific  notation,  per-  cent notation, currencies, date- and
time  formats).    On the right you find a list of all available numeric for
mats.  Select the desired format with a double click (or click and >Ok<)

ALIGNMENT
Here,  you  can  select  the  vertical and horizontal align ment of the cell
contents  resp.    the block.  With the se- lection of a block you determine
the  format  of  the  whole  block  (In  this case, TurboCalc preselects its
settings  in  the  requester.   If the formats are different no item will be
marked).    A  click  on  >OK<  only  changes those settings, which had been
explicitly  selected  before.  If you did not determine a new formatting and
click on >OK<, the previ- ous alignment settings are kept unchanged.

FONT
With  this  item  you can select the font and the font-style of the selected
cell  or block.  With the selection of a block the format of the whole block
is  determined.  (In this case, TurboCalc preselects its settings in the re-
quester.   If the formats are different no item will be marked).  A click on
>OK< only changes those settings, which had been explicitly selected before.
If  you did not determine a new formatting and click on >OK<, the previ- ous
alignment settings are kept unchanged.

COLORS
Here you can change the text- and the background color of a cell or a block.

A  window  with colored rectangles appears, containing a >Default< field for
text-  and  background  color.   "Default" ("Dft") corresponds to the normal
text-  and  background color (black-and-white respectively).  A click on the
desired  color  (or  >Default<)  makes it appear on the left, in the preview
field.  A click on >Ok< accepts the new color(s).

PATTERN
Here you can change the background pattern of a cell or a block.

A  window  with  16  different  patterns  appear.    The  first  (black) one
corresponds  to  "no pattern", i.e.  the back ground will appear white or in
the  color  selected  via  <Format-Colors>  (although  you  will see a black
preview- field).

A  click on the desired pattern makes it appear on the right, in the preview
field  (for  this preview the back ground-color is expected to be white - in
your  sheet  this  will  change to the cells' background color).  A click on
>Ok< accepts this (new) pattern.

FRAME
With this option you can determine the frame of a cell or the current range.

Here you can select the thickness of the respective frame part (left, right,
above,  below)  >Ok<  changes  the  frame  thickness for all cells.  <Around
block>  changes  the frame thickness for the mar- gins of the selected block
only.

CELL PROTECTION
With  this menu item you can change the protection fea- tures of the current
cell or the current block.

WRITEPROTECTION  ENABLED:  If  this  item  is selected and the protection is
switched  on  with  <Options-Protection  Flags>,  this cell can no longer be
overwritten  or  de-  leted.  (This flag is by default set to "on" for every
cell,  the  flag  has  to  be  deleted  only  for  those, which shall not be
protected - and most of the time there are only a few!)

HIDE  FORMULA:  If  this  item is selected and the protection is switched on
with  <Options-Protection  Flags>,  there  will  be  no formula shown in the
status  line.    The  field remains empty.  This is very useful, if only the
value  of  a  formula should be available for others, but the formula itself
should  stay  private.  Hint: As mentioned above, both features are sensless
if  you  do not activate >Enable Protection< in the menu <Options-Protection
Flags>.    Otherwise  (which  is the regu- lar case) all cells can be edited
freely.

COLUMN WIDTH
With  this  option  you  can  set  the  width  of  the  current col- umn(s).
TurboCalc  asks  for the width in characters.  Num- bers with decimal points
can also be entered (.0, .125,25,...) to define the width more precisely.

If the value is specified too low (<1) or too high, it will be ignored.

0 means standard width.

ROW HEIGHT
Here  you  can set the height of the current cell(s).  You will be asked for
the  height  in  lines.    Numbers with deci- mal points can be entered (.0,
.125,25,...) as well to de- fine the height more precisely.

If the value is specified too low (<1) or too high, it will be ignored.

0 means standard height.

FREEZE
With  this  command you can define rows and/or columns that shall be frozen,
i.e.  these lines/columns will be dis- played on top/left of the window even
if  the  range  (below)  is scrolled.  Thus it is a kind of "Title".  Before
selecting this menu item, put the cell cursor in the cell below and right to
the  lines/columns  that  shall be frozen.  All lines above the current cell
and  all col- umns on the right will get the new title (In other words: Move
the cursor to the first cell that is outside of the range to be fixed.).

UNFREEZE: Put the cursor in cell A1 before selecting <Freeze>.

FREEZE  LINES  ONLY:  Move the cursor to the column A one line below the new
"title-lines".

FREEZE COLUMNS ONLY: Move the cursor to line 1 and "Column+1"..  of the part
to be frozen.

HIDE
COLUMN(S) - ROW(S)
With  this menu item you can hide columns resp.  rows.  Move the cell cursor
to the column/row you want to hide and select the respective menu item.  (If
a block is marked when executing this command, all columns/rows hav- ing one
(or more) cells marked will be hidden.)

SHOW
COLUMN(S) - ROW(S)
Columns  or  rows  which  were  hidden  before  (see  above)  can  here   be
redisplayed.    For  this,  move the cursor to the de- sired column/line (or
mark the range) and then call up the corresponding menu item.

DEFAULT FONT
Here  you can determine the standard font for the current sheet.  It will be
used  in  all cells that have not re- ceived a distinct font or the "default
character-set".

PRINT FORMAT
Here  you  can  define  some settings that determine the print image.  (This
windows can also be called from the <Project-Print>-requester).

MARGINS:  In  the  four number fields you can enter the re_ spective margins
(in  centimeters  or  inches, see below).  This allows a precise positioning
within the printout- page (The paper format must be set before the print-out
is started with <Project-Print>).

FONT:  Here  you  can  choose from three printer fonts, which become smaller
from  the  top  to  the  bottom.    Pica  (10 characters per inch) Elite (12
characters per inch) and Condensed (15 characters per inch)

HEADER/FOOTER:  Here  you  can  set,  whether  a top or bottom line shall be
printed  and (behind that) determine the text of this line.  You can use the
following "control characters" in the texts:

%P prints out the appropriate page number instead of these two letters

%D  will  be  replaced  by  the current date 

%N  results in the name of the file, which will be printed.  

%%  results  in  a percent character (if you should need one for your text).

TITLES:  Here,  you  can  determine  that  the  corresponding  column titles
(A,B,...)  appear  in the first line of each page on the print.  Furthermore
you can provide the print- out with the line numbers (1,2,3...) on the left.

With  the  next  gadget  you can create the following 3 lines (with repeated
clicks):  

NO  GRID:  Prints the normal sheet (without raster).  

GRID  (LINE): The sheet is printed with a raster.  As verti- cal separator a
special  character  is  inserted  ("|").    The  whole  line is horizontally
underlined.  Underlined text will thus not be visible as underlined.  

RASTER (UNDERL.): This also adds a raster, but the hori- zontal line will be
produced  as  a  line  of  minus  charac  ters  "-".   The advantage is that
underlinements  are  also  visible  in this case (but it needs twice as much
lines  and therefore pages for the print).  Most of the time the print image
gets more illegible.  

MENUTITLE DATA:
--------------

FIND
Searches  for  the  next  entry  in  the current database, which matches the
current  criteria.    Therefore database- and search-criterion-range must be
defined,  see  below.    If  the  cursor is located in a database range, the
search  starts  in  the line below the cursor.  If the end of the da- tabase
range  is reached without a result, TurboCalc asks whether the search should
be  continued  from  the  beginning (if the search has been started from the
beginning,  it will be indicated that no matching entry could be found).  If
a corresponding line is found it will be marked as a block and the search is
stopped.  Another <Find> continues the search for the next entry.

EXTRACT
Copies  all database lines, which matches the current cri- teria (see there)
to  a  new  position, in fact to the cur- rent cursor position!  (The former
contents of the data- base range stays preserved!).

DELETE
Deletes  all data records which conform to the current search criterion (see
there).    The remaining data records move up accordingly and the da- tabase
range is reduced.

SORT DATABASE
ASCENDING - DESCENDING
Sorts  the  current  database  range in ascending (or in de- scending) order
depending  on  the  column where the cursor is located (the location must be
within the database range, otherwise the instruction will be ignored).

DEFINE DATABASE
Defines  the current marked block as database range.  It re- ceives the name
"DATABASE"  (see  "Names").    The  cells  in the first database line should
contain  the  row-titles  of  the  data-structure  while the remaining lines
represent the database contents.

DEFINE CRITERIA
Defines the current criteria range.  It receives the name "CRITERIA".

The  first  line  should consist of row titles (as used in the database) and
the  remaining  lines  should consist of comparative criteria.  Here a short
summary:  Empty cells: are always identical Number, date, time or text: need
complete  identity  (texts allow the search with the patterns "*" and "?"). 
Comparisons: Start with ">",">=", "<", "<=" or "<>", fol- lowed by a formula
expression.

If  all cells of one line of the criteria range correspond to the respective
values of its title field, this line will be marked as "found"

SORT RANGE
Allows  the  sorting  of  any  range except databases (which are sorted with
<Data-Sort  Database>).    This  command  re-  quires  a block as parameter,
otherwise the selection of this menu item will be ignored.

The following window appears:

SORT  DATA  (ROWS/COLUMNS):  Here you can choose between sorting of lines or
columns.    The  setting  adheres  to the size of the block: If the width is
bigger  than  the  height,  it  will  be  assumed that the columns should be
sorted,  otherwise rows is selected (In most cases this presetting should be
suitable.   

DIRECTION: toggles between ascending/descending sort-order.  

BY  COLUMN/ROW: Normally the sorting adheres to the line totally on the left
or the column on top of the block.  If you want to sort a block according to
a  different line or column, you may change this information here: Enter any
cell of the line or column the sorting shall adhere to (if you sort linewise
only the leading column letter is of importance while the columnwise sorting
requires  the  rownumber  only.   The rest can be chosen at will and even be
outside the sort range).  If the important component for the sort-process is
out side the sort range, the sorting will be aborted.

CREATE SERIES
Allows  the  automatical  fill-in  of changing values (e.g.  number- or date
sequences).    Select the block to be filled (with initial data in the first
column/line), then call his menu and set parameters as desired:

DATA IN (ROWS/COLUMNS): Here you can determine, if the data-series should be
calculated  line-by-line  or  column- by-column (This flag will be preset by
TurboCalc accord- ing to the size of the block.)

INCREMENT:  The increment represents the unit by which the starting value is
raised  step-by step (negative values for diminishing are possible as well).

DATATYPE: Determines, by which method the initial value should be increased:

Arithmetical:  The  increment  will  be  added  to  the  start  value (e.g.:
1,3,5,7,9...; with an increment of two).

Geometrical:  The  start  value  will  be  multiplied  con-  stantly  by the
increment (e.g.: 1,2,4,8,16 - increment two).

Day, Weekday, Month, Year: This method requires a date as initial value.  It
will  be  increased respectively dimin- ished by the selected preiod of time
(days,  month...).   If you have activated the weekdays option, Sundays will
be left out (counting sequence: Saturday, Monday, Tues- day...).

CREATE CHART
Select  a  block  first  and  then  call this menu item.  A win- dow for the
selection  of  the  chart type appears and fol- lowed by a second window for
the  setting  of  the  parame- ters.  Finally a new window with the chart is
opened.      Details   about   both   requesters   can   be   looked   up in
"presentation-chart type" and "presentation-parameter" in the description of
the chart menu or in chapter "Chart".

SHOW CHART
Already  created  charts  can  be  closed temporarily with <Chart-Hide> or a
click on the "close-gadget" of the chart-window.

With  this  instruction all charts of the sheet (the opened and the "closed"
ones) will be shown in a list-window and can be selected with a double click
or a click on >Ok<.

If  the  window  is  open at the moment, it will be activated and put to the
front, otherwise the window will be re- opened.

MENUTITLE OPTIONS:
-----------------

PRINT RANGE
These  two  menu items set the print range, that means the part of the sheet
which should be printed by <Project- Print>:

(The  print  range is determined by these options only and not by a simple
selection  of  a  block  before printing.  Thus, you can determine the print
range  for  several print-outs.  Of course, the last setting stays preserved
after saving and reloading.)

CURRENT BLOCK
The currently marked block becomes the actual print range.  The print-out is
now  limited  to  this  block.  If no block is marked, an error message will
appear.

ALL
The  whole  sheet will be marked as print range.  The print starts with cell
A1  and  ends  in  the last data-filled cell at the left bottom (You can get
there with <Ctrl>-<Down> followed by <Ctrl><Right>).

SHEET
With  the  help of this menu item the general parameters of the sheet may be
set:

MAX.    SHEETSIZE:  Here you can determine the maximum sheet size.  Although
the  size  of TurboCalc is theoretically un- limited, a top boundary must be
entered.   This has been done mainly for your own protection, be- cause very
large sheets could need a lot of storage ca- pacity (This can be the case if
large ranges have been formatted by mistake).

Therefore it is advisable not to select an unnecessary size for the sheet at
the  beginning.   If the sheet is (or becomes) too small for your needs, you
may increase this value later (also in an already existing sheet.)

WIDTH:  Determines  the  width  of  the  sheet between 20 an 700 (700 is the
highest value you can express with two letters, column ZY).  Default is 400.

HEIGHT: Indicates the height of the sheet (between 40 an 9999999, that means
nearly  unlimited.   Even if you like to use only one cell in every row, you
will need more than 200 MB of memory!!!).  Here, default is 4000.

CALCULATION:  MANUALLY: Switches off the automatical calcu- lation.  That is
advisable  for larger sheets or many in puts.  When all inputs are made, the
calculation  can  be  started  manually with <Command-Recalculate> or simply
with <Shift>-<F1>.

<RETURN>:  MOVE  CURSOR:  Determines,  whether  (and in which direction) the
cursor should be moved when you press <Return>.  Default is "Down".

GENERATE  ICONS:  If  an icon should be added to the file when you save your
sheet,  you  have  to  select  this  option.    The  icons  allow  an   easy
file-handling  using the work bench, but need diskspace as well.  So, if you
always  start  TurboCalc  before  and  read the files from there by means of
<Project-Open>, it will be advisable to switch off this option.

DISPLAY
This  instruction  opens  a window to determine the display- options for the
current sheet-window.

SHOW  TITLE: Here it can be determined if the row- or col- umn titles (A, B,
C, 1,1,3,...) shall be shown.  Normally set to "on".

SHOW  GRID:  If  selected,  the cells will be bordered by aux- iliary lines.
This  facilitates  the  location  of distinct cells, but can be confusing in
some sheets.  Furthermore it reduces the scrolling speed.

SHOW  TOOLBAR:  Shows  the  toolbar to allow an easy selec- tion of the most
frequently used commands.

SHOW  FORMULA INSTEAD OF VALUES: If selected, TurboCalc displays the formula
instead  of  the values in all cells containing such a expression.  This can
be  very  useful  for  the  input or the editing of formulas.  If macros are
entered,  these  will  be  shown  (and  not the result as most macros do not
return one).  If this option is activated, the values (mostly Booleans) will
be shown here (e.g.  the result of LOAD; REQUEST...).

SHOW ZERO: Here, it can be determined, if zero values should be displayed (0
or 0.00), or if the cells should stay empty.  Normally they are shown.

LOCALE
These  options  allow  the adaptation of TurboCalc to differ- ent countries.
They mainly refer to the output, the input remains as usual:

NUMERIC  FORMAT:  Here, the character of the decimal point or -comma and the
separator  for  the  thousands  can  be   de-   termined.      The different
possibilities should be presented sufficiently in the requester.

SEPARATOR: Determines one out of three different formats for date values.

ORDER:  Here you can choose the order in which the date should be presented.

CURRENCY:  Determines the currency symbol that appears for numbers which are
formatted as a currency value.  You can choose among the standard currencies
or  define  your  own  individual  format  with  a click on >Prefix<: Prefix
determines  the  part,  which should stand in front of the number and suffix
the part behind it (One of them or perhaps both can be empty).

MEASURE:  With this gadget you can choose whether the widths and heights (in
<Project-Print>  and <Format- Print Format>) shall be measured in cm's or in
inches.

PROTECTION FLAGS
Here  you  can  protect the whole sheet -or only parts of it- from write- or
read access.

ENABLE  PROTECTION  OF "PROTECTED" CELLS: If selected, cells which have been
protected  with  <Format-Protection>  (by  default  all cells are protected)
cannot  be overwrit- ten any longer.  Furthermore, formulas can be protected
against  displaying  with  <Format-Protection>.  If it is not activated, the
limitations of <Format-Protec tion> are not valid and the cells are editable
without re- strictions (For further details see <Format-Protection>).

NEED  PASSWORD  TO  OPEN  THIS FILE: Here you can enter two passwords, which
will  be  required when opening the file.  The file will be loaded only when
the entered password is identical with one of these two.

PASSWORD  FOR FUTURE CHANGES OF THIS OPTIONS: Here you can enter a password,
that  you  have  to reenter if you call <Options-Protection Flags>.  Only in
case  of  identity  this  window will be opened.  This will be useful if you
have  protected the file (>Enable Protection of protected Cells<) and you do
not want to have this option removed by somebody else.

SHOW SHEET-WINDOW
This  menu  item  allows  the  fade-in  of  hidden windows or a quick change
between windows in general.

After  calling  this  item  a  requester  will  be opened with a list of all
available windows (including hidden ones).  Just click on the desired window
followed by >Ok< or per- form a double-click on the desired name.

If  you  have  selected  a hidden window, it will be reopened and put to the
front.  Non-hidden windows will be put to the front only.

HIDE SHEET-WINDOW
Calling  this menu item makes a certain window invisible to the user's eyes.
You  can  hide  special views of the current sheet created with <Options-New
Window> or the last (original) window of the sheet.

Of  course, all the data, which belong to the sheet will be kept in memory. 
Only  its  visualization -the window- is faded out but can be redisplayed at
any time by <Options- Show Window>.

NEW SHEET-WINDOW
Opens  a  new (second, third,...) window of the current sheet and puts it to
the  foreground.   - It can now be used for input or editing in the same way
as  the first window.  The display-options (see above) can be set separately
for every window.

ARRANGE WINDOWS
If  you  have more than one window opened at the same time(of one or several
sheets),  you  may  want to rearrange them.  With the following instructions
the windows can be arranged in a new order.

SHOW ALL
Arranges  all windows side by side.  This is very suitable for a survey, but
will lead (in case of many windows) to very small windows.

STANDARD
Arranges  the  windows  in  overlapping  order,  so  that they are as big as
possible.  All windows further in the back ground only show their title-bars
(or  a part of it).  Each window can be put into the foreground with the "to
front" gadgets (in the right top corner of the windows).

SCREEN - INDIVIDUAL
With  this  menu  item you can select the screen-type on which the TurboCalc
windows  should  appear.   From OS2.0 on, a requester will be opened (if the
"asl.libary"  V38 does exist) where the screen type, the size and the number
of  colors  can  be  determined.    It is built up similar to the setting of
<Prefs>, see user manual.

Otherwise  only  a  window  with  a string gadget appears.  Here you have to
enter the height, width and depth of the screen (each separated by a comma).
For further informa- tion, see appendix 'Screen modes'.

SCREEN - ON WORKBENCH
TurboCalc  opens  its  windows  on the workbench.  If a screen was kept open
before, it will be closed (the window posi- tions stay preserved).

SCREEN - AS WB-COPY
TurboCalc opens a screen, which is identical in size and color number to the
workbench-screen.

SCREEN - FONT
This  menu  item  is provided for the setting of the charac- ter set for all
windows  and menus.  Therefore, a list with all available character sets and
type sizes is shown.

Please select the desired character-set and the size by mouseclick (or input
in the text fields).  For details about this requester, see <Format-Font>.

SCREEN - COLORS
Here, all colors of TurboCalc can be changed (and also the workbench colors,
if TurboCalc should be located there).

Simply  click  on  the  color  you  want  to  change  and then use the three
proportional-gadgets  (shift  regulators)  for red, blue and green to adjust
the color as desired.

SCREEN - DEFAULT COLORS
Sets the colors according to the "TurboCalc standard-set ting".  This may be
useful  if  you  have  mischanged  the col- ors, or if the TurboCalc windows
should be located on the workbench screen and strange colors are shown (e.g.
for 1.3 users).

SCREEN- SMARTREFRESH
Selecting this item opens a window in which the smartre- fresh option can be
turned on/off.

SHEET-SMARTREFRESH: Enables the smartrefresh for sheet- windows.

Once  activated,  it  saves the contents of windows overlaid by others in an
internal  intermediate  memory.   Thus, the window need not to be rebuilt so
many times, which speeds up the screen refresh.

The  hook  to  this  process  is  that  the  buffering  of the win dow needs
additional memory space.

If  you  have  enough storage capacity (more than 1Meg), you should activate
this option.

CHART-SMARTREFRESH:  Enables  the  smartrefresh  for  chart-  windows.  This
option  does  not  consume the memory the screen smartrefresh may require so
you  can  leave  it  acti-  vated  even  on a machine with minimum equipment
(512K).

CONFIG - LOAD
Loads  a  setting  that was saved with <Config-Save>.  (The settings will be
loaded  automatically  when  starting Turbo Calc, so you have to select this
item  only  in case of a change during a TurboCalc session and you want them
back to standard.)

CONFIG - SAVE
Saves  the current configuration which will be loaded auto- matically during
the  next  start  of  TurboCalc.    The  configu-  ration  will  be saved as
"S:TurboCalc.CFG".    Whenever  you start TurboCalc, the program will try to
load  this  file and use these settings.  If this file cannot be opened, the
standard configuration will be used instead.

CONFIG - DELETE
Deletes  the  file  "S:TurboCalc.CFG"  which  was  created  be-  fore   with
<Config-Save>  (see  above).  The internal "standard"-file of TurboCalc will
be used automatically when starting TurboCalc the next time.

MENUTITLE MACRO
For     details     about     macros,      please      refer      to chapter
"Macro/ARexx-Instructions".

PLAY
Opens a window and shows all available macros of Turbo- Calc.  With a double
click on the name (or click on >Ok<), the appropriate macro will be started.


STOP PLAYING
If  you are executing a macro (recognizable by the changed screen title), it
can  be stopped with this menu item.  Nevertheless the last instruction will
be finished.

RECORD
Opens  a  window  for the setting of the macro characteris- tics and accepts
the following instructions as a new macro.  For details, see chapter "Record
Macro".    

MACRONAME:  Please  enter  the macro-name here.This is the name that will be
shown  in  the <Macro-Play> requester later.  Try to choose a clear name, so
that  you  can  easily  recognize  the macro.  

WRITE  MACRO  TO: Here, you can select, if you want to rec- ord the macro to
the  current  sheet  or to a new macro work- sheet.  TurboCalc provides both
recording  types  (in  con-  trast  to  other  spread-sheet  programs).  The
recording  in  the  current sheet is suitable, if only a few macros shall be
recorded.    In  this  case  you do not need an extra sheet, which has to be
loaded  and  saved to gether with the one that is affected by the macro.  If
you  intend  to  create a lot of macros, or use macros in gen- eral for more
than  one  sheet,  you may prefer the saving of macros in an external sheet.
Please note that you have to save and load this sheet separately.  

POSITION: Here you can determine a definite position (the cursor position is
preset),  where  the  macro  shall  be  writ-  ten  to.   As default setting
TurboCalc  selects  the next new and unoccupied column (in the current sheet
from  column  BA  on,  if  this  column  is  not  occupied  yet).    

To  SAVE CURSORMOVEMENTS RELATIVELY determines, whether the cursor positions
shall  be  saved  absolutely  (e.g.    C5)  or  relatively  (e.g.  3 down, 2
left...).  If you have set all parameters, click on >Ok< and the re- cording
will  be  started  (if  necessary,  the new macro sheet is opened)!.  In the
screen  bar  appears a corre- sponding text indicating that the recording is
in  prog-  ress  (if  the  bar is not overlaid by a window).  After you have
recorded  all necessary steps, you can stop the recording with the menu item
<Macro-Stop Recording>.  The message on the screen bar disappears.

STOP RECORDING
If  you  are  running  a macro-recording (recognizable by the changed screen
title), it can be stopped with this menu item.

DEFINE NAME
This  menu  item corresponds to <Command-Define Name>.  It has been added to
the macro menu to shorten the defini- tion procedure.

MENUTITLE HELP:
---------------

INFO
Opens  a  window  which  displays  some  information  about  the version and
revision of your TurboCalc copy and the current sheets.

HELP ITEMS
The  selection  of  an item in this pull-down menu opens a window in which a
brief summary of the most important points of the respective topic is given.


A more detailed explanation and further information about a certain function
of TurboCalc can be found in this manual.
