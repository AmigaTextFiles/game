two worlds: Inferia and Celestia. Could they save the world? It's up to you to control them to
save this world.

Prologue

You will see a nice opening FMV. An old man is passing through the bushes in a forest with a
flashlight in his hand. He will spotted a strange machine and cute animal that looks like a
rabbit but with along tail next to the machine. Next he will spotted a young girl with strange
outfits. They will speak in some strange language.

Old Man : You're up early.

Girl : I couldn't sleep very well.

Old Man : Have you packed? Are you ready for your voyage?

Girl : I'm packed and ready to go!

Old Man : Please be careful.

Girl : I will...but I must succeed.

Old Man : I understand...Good luck.

Girl : Thank you! It's time for me to go.

The girl will get inside the machine and fly to the sky.

Old Man : Ah... We are in grave trouble... Please be safe...

Enemies : Night Raid, Beast Bear, Rocky Hawk, Slime
Items : Spectacles, Wooden Shield, 2x Apple Gel
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now we switch to a boy walking down the path in a forest. He will notices there is something
strange with the sky today.

Reid : Hmm?

He will comes to a tower and he will notices a girl at the top of the tower.

Reid : Huh? Is that...

The girl will notices Reid at the bottom of the tower.

Farah : Reid!!

Reid : ...Farah?

Reid will climbs the tower.

Farah : Hey! Long time no see! How's it going? Did your hunt go well?

Reid : I just took what I need for today. Nothing hard about that.

Farah : Wow! I have to admit it. You sure are handy with your sword.

Reid : Farah, it sure is a surprise to see you here.

Farah : Yeah. Lately I've been busy in the fields. Reid, do you still come here every day?

Reid : Yeah.

Farah : You've liked this place, ever since we were small.

Reid : ...So what's up today? Playing hooky?

Farah : Of course not! There's something different about the sky, so I came to take a look.

Reid : The sky?

Farah : Don't the colors look different?

Reid : ...Do they? Can't say I've noticed.

Farah : It's definitely weird!! I think something's going to happen...

Reid : Yeah, like what?

Farah : I don't know...! maybe something is about to come falling from Celestia?!

Reid : Don't sound so thrilled. Anything coming from there is bound to be bad news.

Farah : How would you know? There hasn't been contact between our worlds for 2000 years.

Reid : ANYWAY! Life is meant to be simple. When things stay the way they are, THAT"S true
       happiness.

Farah : Here we go again! Reid's philosophy! You never change.

Reid : Oh yeah? Well maybe I'm just that way cause of all the trouble that a certain somebody
       caused! ...Farah?

Farah : Hey, over there! What's that?!

You will see something shiny coming from the sky to the ground.

Reid : Uh-oh! Farah! Run!!

Farah : Reid!!

Now you will see the tower is destroyed by something unknown coming from the sky.

Reid : ...Whew! Farah, are you okay?

Farah : Yeah, I'm okay! But something came down, didn't it? I'm gonna have a look!

Farah will runs off to check out something coming from the sky.

Reid : Hey, Farah! Wait! It's too dangerous!! ...Argh! She's always like this!

Now you can control your character. Go down two screens and pick up a Wooden Shield and a
Spectacles. Here you can see a green crystal. This green crystal is the place you will start
if you load the game. Go up first to the next screen to get a Apple Gel. Now go back to the
previous screen and this time go to the left. There are 3 paths in here: up, middle and down.
You can't take the down path; up and middle path will take you the same screen. Take up or
middle path and after that take the upper path to the next screen. Here you will find a statue
and a Apple Gel at the upper right. Now go back to the place where you can find a green
crystal. This time take the right path. Here you will find a rabbit that you saw in the
opening FMV.

Rabbit : Kuweeekeee!!

Reid : Huh? What are you? You're a peculiar looking thing...

If you get near the rabbit, it will run. It looks like it is trying to make you follow it.

Rabbit : Kwekee!

Reid : You want me to follow, is that it?

Go to the upper path. Here you will find Farah and the strange girl from the FMV. There is a
broken machine next to them.

Reid : Farah!

Farah : Reid? Over here!

Reid : What...is this? Who's...that?

The girl will speak in some strange language.

Girl : (Talking in some strange language.)

Reid : ...What?

Girl : (Talking in some strange language.)

Farah : I can't understand a single word. What do we do?

Girl : (Talking in some strange language.)

Farah : Umm...I...err...aah...

The machine is starting to glow.

Reid : A...anyway, it's dangerous here. Let's get her out of here.

Farah : Why?

Reid : Because!

Reid will carry the girl to get away from the machine. When Reid is near the girl, you can see
something shiny from the girl. After that the machine blow up.

Reid : Ouuccch. Farah, you okay?

Farah : Yeah, I'm fine. What about her?

The girl will wake up and you can see the shiny thing again.

Reid : What is this? This...rainbor light?

The girl will hug Reid.

Girl : Feeebreeel!

You will see the shiny thing again.

Rabbit : Ku...ku...kwee...kwekeee!

Reid : Ow! Ow!!

Girl : (Talking in some strange language.)

Reid : I...I got it, I got it. Can you let go of me now?

Farah : Hmmm... We don't know who she is, but one thing's for sure.

Reid : And what would that be?

Farah : She likes you.

Reid : D...don't be stupid. That's silly! She wants help...from BOTH OF US!

Girl : (Talking in some strange language.)

Farah : Help? Oh, I see! We can't understand her, but we sure can help!!!

Reid : How?

Farah : Hmmm, I wonder...

You will be in Elder's house now.

Farah : And so that's what happened. We wanted to ask you for your advice...

Khamran : ...We'll search the site of the explosion immediately. It might still be dangerous.

Farah : Right! And umm... What about her...?

Khamran : She must be cast out. It might seem cruel, but it is my duty to protect this
          village.

Farah : That's no excuse! You're saying we just turn our backs on a girl in trouble?

Reid : Farah!

Khamran : Look at the color of her skin. Strange clothes, unintelligible speech... She could
          be the seed of disaster!

You will see a guy blows up the wall.

Khamran : Wh...what's going on?!

Guy : (Talking in some strange language.)

Then he will disappear.

Reid : What was that?

Farah : Are you oksy?!

Girl : (Talking in some strange language.)

Farah : That man... Was he after her?

Reid : It didn't look like a father greeting his lost child, that's for sure.

Khamran : Ugh...

Farah : Ah...Elder! Are you all right? ...Are you all right?

Khamran : You two...again? are you two bringing disaster upon us...?! ...Just like before?!

Farah : You're wrong!

Reid : Elder! This has nothing to do with back then!

Khamran : Cast the girl out! Banish her!

Farah : ...I understand. We'll do as you order. However...! I'm going with her as well.

Khamran : ...Do as you wish.

Farah : Goodbye!

Reid : H...hey!

Now you will be in Farah's house.

Farah : Thanks for waiting. Tada!

Girl : (Talking in some strange language.)

Farah : She's wearing my old clothes. Whaddya think? Now when we leave the village, we won't
        attract attention.

Girl : (Talking in some strange language.)

Reid : Do you really plan to leave the village?

Farah : Yeah! I've decided! First, I need to find someone who can understand her.

Reid : ...Any ideas?

Farah : Ummm... Ah, got one! How about Keele?

Reid : Keele? By Keele, you mean that crybaby good-for-nothing Keele Zeibel?

Farah : That was when he was small! He's become a student at Mintche University! Aren't the
        students there well respected? He might be able to understand her!!

Reid : But it's Keele we're talking about. I wonder...

Farah : No problem! It's decided! Our destination is the Town of Academia, Mintche! Well let's
        go! My little lost bird.

The girl will go closer to Reid. It looks like she doesn't want to leave without Reid.

Girl : (Talking in some strange language.)

Farah : Umm... We need to leave now. We...leave...this village. But he stays here...
        Understand?

Girl : Feebureel! Feebureel!

The girl will hug Reid and you can see the shiny thing again.

Reid : Ow ow ow! My name isn't Feebureel.

Farah : Hmmm... What now? Reid, what do we do? It looks like she wants to stay with you.

Reid : What do you mean, what do we do?

Farah : Well, she needs to leave the village, but she doesn't want to be separated from
        you... That's all I'm saying!

Reid : ...Just as I thought. I knew this would happen. I have a bad feeling.

Farah : Here we go again. It isn't that bad being needed by such a cute girl, is it?

Reid : ...Whatever. Don't forget that it's dangerous out there. We'll need to be well
       prepared.

Farah : Right!

Now go outside from Farah's house. If you search the ground where you can see the farmer atop
of it, you can get Kirima. Now go inside the left house. Here search the pink pig. The pink
pig will changed into Wonder Chef. He will teach you how to make Sandwich. Now take the upper
left path to the next screen. Search the two barrels to get two Apple Gel. Search the barrel
again next to the old man to get a Apple Gel. There's nothing you can find in the barn, the
house behind the old man. Search the barrel in front of the left house to get another Apple
Gel. You can't take the left path. Now go inside the left house. This is Reid's house. Search
the basement of Reid's house. Here you can find a Lens if you search the yellow box. Now go
outside from Reid's house and enter the middle house. It's Elder's house. You can find 500
Gald if you search the cupboard next to the plant. Now go upstairs, search the bookshelf for a
Collector's Book. Now go outside from the Elder's house and take the down path. You can change
your Hand Axe with Short Sword or Short Spear if you talk to the man near the windmill. Now
search the door of the abandoned windmill to get another Lens. The right house is the
Traveller's Shop. You can buy items and equipments here. You can find the Wonder Chef if you
search the armor in this shop. This time he will teach you how to make Omelette. After you
finished all the things you have to do in this village, go to the bridge and you will have
some conversation. After that, go outside to the world map.

Farah : It's finally here... ...the day we leave the village.

Reid : Don't sound so happy about it. Mintche is far to the south. We've got some distance to
       cover.

Farah : No proble! Especially with your help... Right?

Reid : Whatever...

Farah : Let's go!!

Girl : (Talking in some strange language.)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Enemies in this continent :
Day : Arrow Tail, Rocky Hawk, Slime, Mahogany, Bandit, Archer, Evil Needles, Sword Soldier,
Witch, Beast Bear, Rocky Hawk
Night : Zombie, Sprite
Beach : Sea Slug, Harpy, Red Sizzer
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now go to the bridge, south of Rasheans.

Farah : Hey, you know... We haven't introduced ourselves yet.

Reid : It's too bad we can't communicate.

Farah : My name is Farah. Understand? Farah... Farah.

Girl : (Talking in some strange language.) Farah?

Farah : Yes, Farah! And this is Reid! Reid... Reid.

Girl : (Talking in some strange language.)

Reid : It's Reid... Reid!

Girl : Reid!

Farah : Yeah! She said it! She said it!!

Girl : Meredy, Meredy, Meredy!

Farah : Meredy?

Meredy : (Talking in some strange language.)

Meredy : Kuweeeky...kuweeeky... Kuweeeky!

Redi : I guess its name is Quickie, huh.

Quickie : Kuweeekeee!

Reid : Well, that's an easy name.

Farah : Hey! This is working fine!! Understanding Meredy might be a lot easier than I thought.
        Maybe we won't have to go to Mintche!

Meredy : (Talking in some strange language.)

Farah : ...Guess we'd better go see Keele after all.

Reid : Good idea.

Go south from the bridge. You can't go to Regulus Knoll for now, but you can go to Regulus
Dojo. I suggest you go to Rasheans River Pier first because you will be back to Regulus Dojo
later. Rasheans River Pier is to the south of Rasheans. Just follow the river after you cross
the bridge. From the entrance, go down two screens. Here you will find a lot of people working
to make the road cleared from the rocks.

Farah : Excuse me. Could you tell us how to get to Mintche?

Man : You have to take this road to get to Mintche, but as you see, there's been a
      landslide...

Reid : There isn't much we can do, Farah. Let's just rest here for today.

Meredy : (Talking in some strange language.)

Farah : Even if the path is a little rough, it's not impossible to travel across, is it? We'll
        give it a try!

Man : B...but...

Farah : Let's go!

Reid : Hey, Farah! Hang on a second!!

Farah : No problem! It might be a bit rugged, but we can do it!

You will see a FMV about a mysterious light coming from the sky. This makes another landslide.
So it's impossibe for you to go this way to Mintche.

Meredy : (Talking in some strange language.)

Man : There it goes again... I wonder what's happening to the Orbus Barrier...?

Farah : Ummm... Maybe this is... ...a little dangerous...

Reid : What did I tell you?!

Man : If you're in a hurry, why don't you try our Dojo? The Master might know a different way
      to get to Mintche.

Farah : Really?!

Man : Yes. The Dojo is only a little ways back from here.

Farah : Regulus Dojo? I know where it is. I used to be a student there.

Man : Oh, is that right?! Well, take care...

Farah : Thanks for helping us! Okay, let's go!

Now go back to the world map and go to Regulus Dojo.

Man : A cute girl like her... ...a martial artist?

Man : I wonder if she's strong?

Paollo : Sh...she's really strong! She's an amazing girl...

On the way to the world map, they will have some conversation.

Farah : This girl... Who exactly is she?

Reid : Strange-colored hair. Clothes I've never seen. And a weird stone on her forehead.
       ...Maybe a travelling performer?

Meredy has earned the title of Travelling Performer?

Farah : Ummm, ahhh... Meredy, where di you come from? Why did you come here?

Meredy : (Talking in some strange language.)

Farah : Well... If we can't understand her, we'll never get anywhere.

Meredy : Reid...

Meredy will hold Reid's hands and you can see the shiny thing again.

Meredy : Feebureel...feebureel!

Reid : Ow ow ow! What's this light? What's a feebureel?

Farah : I don't know, but it's obvious she wants your help.

Reid : Is she afraid that the one who attacked us will return?

Farah : Maybe...

Reid : Well... No point in worrying. We'll let Keele figure it out.

Farah : I guess so. It's been so long since we saw Keele! I bet he's become a great scholar!

Reid : I wonder...

Farah : This place hasn't changed at all!

Reid : Weren't you a student here not long ago? Of course it hasn't changed.

At the front of the Dojo.

Reid : So this is the Great Dojo.

Farah : Let's go in.

Quickie : Kwekeee, kwek kwek, kwekeee!!

Meredy : (Talking in some strange language.)

Franco : Ho ho ho...enough! That was quite impressive!

Reid : Wh...what?

Franco : You have great skills for one so young. The decision has been made. Welcome to our
         dojo!

Reid : J...just wait a second. I don't want to join any dojo.

Franco : Then why did you fight?

Reid :  I was just defending myself!

Farah : It's been so long, Master Franco!

Franco : Ahhh, Farah! What brings you here? Do you wish to train with us again?

Farah : Well...no. Actually, we wish to go to Mintche as soon as possible. But the path has
        been blocked by a rockslide, so...

Franco : So that is your reason...

Farah : Yes...one of many.

Franco : ...Very well. Let us talk in my room. And you young man, what is your name?

Reid : Me? ...Reid Hershel.

Franco : Ahem...Reid. Perhaps you wish to join my dojo?

Reid : Well, actually, I...

Franco : no need to hurry. Join us after your business is settled.

Reid : Well, I'm really not interested.

Franco : I see... Ahem...right.

If you search the red thing at the left of the entrance, you will get a Leather Helm. You can
get an Apple Gel fi you search the red thing at the right of the entrance. You can get another
Apple Gel if you search the vase at the upper left. Go up to the next screen. First enter the
far right door. You can find an Orange Gel if you search the vase near the entrance. You can
get a Lens if you search the thing next to the vase where you find the Orange Gel. Now go to
the second room from the right. Here you can find another Lens if you search the table. You
can get Manual if you talk to the right monk and choose "Manual Mode". Now enter the third
room from the right. Here you can have a fight with 8 monks like the previous fight, but this
time you will not alone. Before talking to Franco, there's two pillars outside Franco's Room.
Search pillar on the left to get a Wristband and you can found new path to get a Ribbon. Now
talk to Franco.

Franco : Let us talk in my room.

In Franco's room.

Meredy : (Talking in some strange language.)

Farah : Ah, she is... Umm...

Franco : Hmm. I know you not, but your eyes do not lie. Follow your heart's path. That is
         best.

Farah : ...Yes!

Franco : Well then, I shall teach you a useful skill.

Farah : Thank you very much!

Farah learned Healer.

Franco : Hmm. And Reid... Your swordplay is quite impressive. Where did you learn it?

Reid : Where? Well, I just go out and hunt every day for food, that's all...

Paollo : E...excuse me!

Franco : Ah, Paollo. I'd like you to use your Craymel Artes to help them get to Mintche. After
         all, you're the only one in this dojo who knows the Water Craymel Artes.

Paollo : G...gladly!

Franco : Then I'll leave the rest to you. Now if you'll excuse me, it's time for training. If
         you want to learn more about fighting or wish to learn higher level skills, go next
         door.

Farah : Thank you for everything.

Franco : Hmm...and Reid. Are you sure you don't want to join my dojo? Uh...forget I mentioned
         it.

Reid : So, what do we do now?

Paollo : W...w...w...well... W...will you come with me to the Craymel Artes training room? I
         need to make preparations.

Now go to the far right room.

Paollo : The Rasheans River is a shortcut to Mintche.

Farah : But...isn't that river pretty rough?

Paollo : No problem. We can borrow the strengths of the Water Craymels.

Reid : Cray...mel?

Farah : Reid, don't tell me you don't know what a Craymel is?

Reid : I don't have interest in anything that doesn't fill my stomach.

Paollo : Craymels are not material beings. Fire, wind, water, light... They reside within all
         things and have many manifestations.

Farah : And like Paollo, those who have the ability to control Craymels and their phenomena,
        are called Craymel Mages. Right?

Paollo : Uh, well... With a little training, anybody with a Craymel Cage can learn...

Reid : Is that thing in your hand a Craymel Cage?

Paollo : Ye...yes. That's right. By sealing Craymels within this Craymel Crystal, you can
         perform various Craymel Artes.

Reid : Ahh...I see. Just stick the Craymels in there...

Farah : ...Many ages ago, it is said there were many Craymel Cages and many knew how to use
        Craymel Artes.

Reid : Wow...

Paollo : W...well then. I'll be waiting for you at Rasheans River Pier. Please come when
         you're ready.

Behind Regulus Dojo, you can find a big round green plain. If you walk around, you will go to
a screen where you can find old soldier who will teach you Range Attack command.

Farah : He's our childhood friend! We'll recognize him in an instant! Hopefully... Well,
        first... ...Let's try Mintche University!

The house on your left is Mintche Inn. There's nothing you can found here. Go to the north
house, it is a bit to the right. This is Student Store. The house to the left is Cafetaria.
You can get a recipe from Wonder Chef if you search the red flower. This time he will teach
you how to make Hamburger. There are 2 roads in here. Left road is the way to University.
Right road is the way to the harbor. There's nothing you can find at the right road. But if
you want to see the right road, the big house to the north is a church. If you go the right
again, it is the harbor. So let's take the left road. There are 2 roads in here : up and left.
The big house in the middle is a library. There's nothing you can find here, in this room or
in the next room. So let's take the upper path. You will get a sequence in here.

Katrine : Pierre, don't worry and go on ahead! As soon as I've gathered the research
          materials, I'll go straight to Inferia City.

Pierre : Thank you. I'll be waiting at the Observatory. Let's get married after the Academic
         Conference!

Katrine : Yes!

Pierre : Katrine! I love you!

Katrine : I love you, Pierre!

Farah : Say, is anything wrong?

Reid : Hey, Farah! We should mind our own business...!

Katrine : There's an important Academic Conference coming up in Inferia City, but I haven't
          completed preparing the paper to be presented yet...

farah : Uh-huh.

Katrine : So we decided to have Pierre go on ahead, and I would follow after him after I
          prepare the paper.

Farah : I see. Will you make it on time?

Katrine : Yes. I don't have that much more to do.

Farah : It sounds like you'll be okay!

Katrine : Well... You see, I've never been outside of Mintche... I don't know if I can get to
          Inferia City all on my own...

Farah : Don't be so negative. You can do it! You can do anything if you put your mind to it!

Katrine : I...I guess you're right! Thank you! All right! No problem!

Farah : It must be so nice to be in love...

Girl : Pardon me, but what is your relationship with the student?

Reid : We're childhood fr...

Farah : We're his family!! Our father is sick, and we have to get in touch with him right

Girl : Just a moment, please. ID Number 34604, Keele Zeibel. Light Craymel Department.

Girl : What do you think you're doing?!

Farah : Th...Thanks for everything!

The right room is Fire Craymel Laboratory. The middle room is Light Craymel Laboratory. The
left room is a classroom. Go to the middle room.

Farah : So this must be the Light Craymel Laboratory. Wait, okay? We'll be right back.

Meredy : (Talking in some strange language.)

Farah : Let's go in.

Reid : They look quite busy...

Farah : Let's look for someone who's willing to talk to us.

Now go talk to the girl at the north.

Farah : Um, excuse me. Do you know Keele Zeibel?

Girl : Keele? Are you friends of his?

Farah : Yes! So you must know Keele!

Girl : My name is Zank. I'm a research assistant, just as he was.

Reid : And where is Keele now?

Zank : Well...

Meredy will enter the room and something happened in this room.

Reid : What's happening?

Farah : Meredy!

Meredy : (Talking in some strange language.)

Quickie : Kweke, kwekeee!

All the machines in this room blow up.

Farah : Meredy, did you do that?

Meredy : (Talking in some strange language.)

A man will enter the room.

Zank : Oh, Dean Carlyle...

Carlyle : Are you responsible for this?!

Reid : Well, not exactly... You could say it was our fault, but, then again...

Carlyle : I don't want to hear any excuses! What are you going to do about this damage?

Farah : Well, we... I don't know...

Carlyle : Zank! Show these outsiders to the exit! Kick them out of school grounds!

Zank : Y...yes, sir.

Your party will exit the room and go to the classroom.

Zank : Don't worry about what the dean says. Carlyle has a short temper, but he'll forget all
       about it soon...

farah : I'm sorry.

Zank : Can I ask you a question? Was that the Melnics language she spoke?

Meredy : (Talking in some strange language.)

Farah : The Melnics language?!

Zank : I'm sure of it! All the Craymel Mage spells are in the same ancient language she was
       using! I'm studying about it in school now.

Reid : Does that mean you can understand what Meredy says?

Zank : I'm afraid I can't... Your average Craymel Mages shouldn't be able to speak such pure
       Melnics language... I...is she a...?! Excuse me... I hope my question isn't rude, but
       might you be an Imperial Craymel Mage?

Reid : An Imperial Craymel Mage? Her...?

Zank : But why would an Imperial Craymel Mage come here? Does she have some connection with
       Keele?

Reid : Well, you see...

Meredy : (Talking in Melnics language.)

Farah : Oh, no! the Imperial Craymel Mage has divine messages for us!

Zank : Huh? What? Divine messages...?

Farah : We must find Keele now! Where do you suppose he is?

Zank : He's at the Mt. Mintche Observatory.

Farah : Mt. Mintche is the mountain southwest of Mintche, isn't it? Thank you! Oops! I almost
        forgot... Why isn't Keele at the university?

Zank : Oh, that's because he's been suspended from school... He started spouting about the
       theory of World Chain Destruction, and turned Carlyle and everyone else in the school
       against him.

Farah : World destruction...? Why would Keele think of such a thing?

Zank : Even if you do go find him, he might refuse to see you. He's even turned me away a few
       times.

Farah : Anyway, we've got to meet him in person! Thanks for all your help. Thanks for waiting.

Meredy : (Talking in Melnics language.)

Reid : Her...an Imperial Craymel Mage? I can't imagine...

Meredy has earned the title of Craymel Mage?

Farah : Well, it's certainly a big step forward for us to learn that she speaks Melnics! No
        problem! What we have to do now is head for Mt. Mintche Observatory to the southwest
        from here!

If you go to the second floor, you will find Water Craymel Laboratory to the right and Wind
Craymel Laboratory to the left. In the third floor, you will find Exam Room - Intermediate to
the right and Exam Room - Beginner to the left. If you enter Exam Room - Beginner and talk to
the man, you can try to answer the questions from Chelsea about Namco's games. If you win, you
will get the title of Namco Teacher and Melange Gel. You can find Exam Room - Advanced at the
fourth floor. You can get a Lens if you search the machine at Water Craymel Laboratory(2nd
floor) after you get Keele. After you finished all the business at Mintche, now go southwest
to Mt. Mintche Observatory.

your HP. After that, go up to the next screen. Get Apple Gel near the entrance. Drop the rock
like before to prevent monsters from appearing. Get 600 Gald and Pole Axe above the place you
get Apple Gel. After get all the items, go left to next screen. Here, just go left again
across the bridge to get back to the world map. Now just go up a little to reach Mt. Mintche

Mt. Mintche Observatory

Items : Holy Bottle

Reid : It looks like nobody is here.

Farah : HELLO!! Keele!!

Keele : It's useless I tell you!!

Farah : Aaah!

Meredy : (Talking in Melnics language.)

Keele : Craymel movements are causing a buildup in the Grobule distortion field. And if you're
        sating that the Orbus Wave has no relationship to the Doctark Effect, you need to
        rethink  the basics of Craymelology.

Farah : ...Keele?

Keele : Huh? You're not from Mintche University?

Farah : It's me, Farah Oersted! Farah, your childhood friend! It's been a long time. How are
        you?

Keele : Farah...?

Farah : You've really grown! For a minute, I didn't recognize you.

Reid : Well it's been 10 years. Of course he's changed.

Keele : Is that you, Reid?

Reid : Hey there.

Farah : Yippee! The old gang is back again!!

Meredy : (Talking in Melnics language.)

Keele : Who's this?!

Farah : Her name is Meredy. We came to see you because we want to help her.

Reid : She only speaks Melnics. Can you help?

Keele : Melnics language? Who is she anyway?!

Reid : We don't know. That's why we're here.

Keele : Melnics language, huh... Okay!

Keele will drag Meredy.

Farah : Keele has really made something of himself. I'm so proud of him... Don't you think so
        too, Reid?

Reid : Let's catch up to them.

Farah : Umm, okay.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Keele : (Talking in Melnics language.) <<My name..Keele Zeibel.>>

Keele : (Talking in Melnics language.) <<You...who?>>

Meredy : (Talking in Melnics language.)

Keele : Ah, ahem!

Keele : (Talking in Melnics language.) <<You... Who? Where?>>

Meredy : (Talking in Melnics language.)

Keele : (Talking in Melnics language.) <<Come...from... Come from?>>

Reid : Hey, hey. Are you getting anywhere?

Keele : No... You can't be!!

Farah : You understood?! I knew you could do it!

Keele : She said... She's from Celestia...

Farah : Celestia?!

Reid : Celestia?!

Farah : You mean she's from that world hanging in the sky upside down?!

Reid : Oh, come on, now! Meredy is a little weird, but she's obviously a regular person...!

Farah : That's right! Celestians are supposed to be...

Keele : Volume 2, Chapter 2 of the Leonoa Encyclopedia says that Celestians are a ferocious,
        man-eating race...

farah : She couldn't possibly...

keele : Well, true or not, that's what she said.

Meredy : (Talking in Melnics language.)

Keele : What's that thing on her head? It looks like...a stone.

Meredy : (Talking in Melnics language.)

Meredy will hit Keele because he is so rude touching her head.

Keele : Ow!!

Farah : Keele!

Reid : I think I know what she just said. She just called you a pervert.

Quickie : Kwek...kwek!

Keele : Anyway... We have to find out what she wants. Hmm... Oh, here it is.

Keele : (Talking in Melnics language.) <<Why Meredy come?>>

Keele : (Talking in Melnics language.) <<Why...come?>>

Meredy : (Talking in Melnics language.)

Keele : Um...

Reid : He's lost...

Farah : It's an ancient language. Even Keele can't get it all at once...

Keele : I...I can do it! This is no different than all the research that I've done!

Meredy will spotted something.

Meredy : (Talking in Melnics language.)

It turned out to be a map.

Meredy : (Talking in Melnics language.)

Keele : Yes, that's right! On the bottom is Inferia, and on the top is Celestia. In the middle
        is the Orbus Barrier. All of this collectively is called Eternia. This is the world we
        live in.

Meredy : In-fe-ri-a! Ce-les-ti-a! Boom!!

Farah : An explosion?

Reid : ...No way.

Meredy : In-fe-ri-a! Ce-les-ti-a! Boom!!

Reid : Hey, Keele. Explain for us.

Keele : Come over here. Look through here.

Reid : What does this have to do with anything?

Keele : Just look!

Reid will look through the telescope.

Keele : Can you see the Orbus Barrier?

Reid : ...Yeah. So?

Keele : I'll enlarge it. Wait.

Keele will enlarge the focus and you will see a dark hole in the sky.

Reid : What's this?

Keele : The dark matter... It seems to be growing bigger by the day.

Farah : ...And that must be why the color of the sky is different.

Reid : So, what's that dark matter...?

Keele : A sign of world destruction. It's possible that Meredy is here to warn us of the
        danger. We should look into this further.

Reid : Look into it? How?

Keele : We've got to go see Professor Mazet. He's an authority on the Melnics language. He
        left Mintche University, and he's currently living in Morle Village.

Reid : You're kidding, right...? Morle is on a whole different continent! This is getting
       ridiculous!

Farah : I'm going with Keele! I can't just ignore Meredy.

Meredy : (Talking in Melnics language.) Reid,...

Keele : We're leaving! Are you ready?

Reid : Keele, you're not much of a traveler. Are you sure you're going to be okay?

Keele : That was when I was a little kid! I...I'm fine, now!

Reid : We'll see...

Farah : Well, let's go!

Keele : Hmph!

Reid : This is going to be one long trip...

Farah : Don't worry! It'll work out somehow. No problem!

Keele : Farah. To get to Morle, you have to go through Nostos Cave located to the east of
        here.

Reid : I dunno about this...

Enter Mt. Mintche Observatory again to get Holy Bottle from the chest and a Lens if you search
the box next to the Holy Bottle. Now go back to the world map and go back to Mt. Mintche. Now
go to the place where you can camp, you will have some conversation here.

Keele : W...wait...

Reid : What? Out of breath? Heh...as weak as ever.

Keele : Gimme' a break! I've had insufficient sleep lately.

Farah : Why don't we camp here? We still have long ways to go...

Now you will be in front of fireworks at night.

Meredy : (Talking in Melnics language.)

Keele : Don't touch me!

Farah : Keele, you don't need to speak like that!

Keele : You can't be too careful around people you don't know. But she could be useful. At the
        very least, I hope to build a solid bridge of communication.

Reid : Useful?

Keele : Once I gather enough evidence about the dangers of the dark matter, I can return to
        Mintche University. Better yet, I might even be invited to join the Royal Observatory
        of Astronomy.

Reid : So the only reason why you're so cooperative is for your own benefit... You've become
       quite the opportunist.

Keele : You're wrong! I'm simply searching for the truth. And for that, I need the best
        environment possible!

Meredy : (Talking in Melnics language.)

Keele : Don't touch me!

Keele will hit Meredy away.

Reid : is that a Craymel Cage? You have one, too?

Keele : D...don't be stupid! I'm not like those rogue Craymel students! Unlike them, I've
        actually studied the Light Craymels. Grobule distortion and Kaloric flow fundamentals
        suggest a practical scientific application. For instance...

Reid : I got it, I got it. You're something else!

Keele : Hmph.

Farah : No problem...?

Now just follow the way to get back to the world map. Go east to reach Nostos Cave.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In front of the cave, you will see a man came out from the cave.

Reid : Wow! Those eggs look good...

Man : I won't sell these even for ten thousand Gald! Yes, even that! They came at the cost of
      my partner's life...

Farah : What kind of eggs are those?

Man : Egg Bear's. Egg Bear eggs fetch a high price as miracle cures. I got them form the
      mountain, but we were spotted by the Egg Bear parents...

Reid : You weren't very lucky.

Man : But my merchant spirit won't die here. For my partner, I will earn, earn, and earn some
      more! ...Are you interested in anything besides Egg Bear eggs?

You can buy some items from this man. After finished buying, enter the cave. Upon enetring,
you will have a little conversation.

Keele : It seems that the tidal movement here is affected by time.

There are 2 paths in here: up and right. Take the upper path first to get an Orange Gel in the
next screen. Get back to the previous screen and take the right path. You will get a sequence
in the next screen.

Farah : Hey, Keele. Are you okay? Should we camp?

Keele : N...no... I'll be fine...

Farah : Hee hee hee. We've grown and learned to say complicated stuff. But when you get right
        down to it, we never really change, do we?

Reid : You can say that again. Nothing at all.

You will be in the past when the three of you were chased by a monster.

Keele : Waaahhh!

Farah : I'll fight you!

Reid will throw something to the monster and the monster will chasing Reid.

Farah : It's all right now, Keele.

Keele : Waaaahhh...

Farah : I said it's all right... Um, ah, waaaahhhh!

You will be back to the present.

Farah : Well, at least it looks like he doesn't cry anymore.

Keele will fall down again.

Farah : Keele! Are you all right?

Keele : Of...of course!

Reid : But his adolescent charm sure is gone...

Get Panacea Bottle from the pouch and Protector from the chest in this screen. Now go to the
next screen from upper right path. Get Buckler and Chain Arms from the chests in this screen.
Go to the north to the next screen and you will be confronted by a Bear.

Keele : An Egg Bear!!

Farah : Aaah!

Meredy : (Talking in Melnics language.)

Reid : Leave it to me! An Egg Bear should be an easy kill!!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss : Egg Bear
HP : 3200
EXP : 32
Gald : 90
Attack : 130 (Physical Attack)
Defense : 120
Intelligence : 50

Strategy : The easy way to defeat this boss is use Lightning Blade and Demon Hammer
           continously.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Keele : Huff...ha...hah. An...easy fight.

Reid : Then why do you look so tired?

Farah : Why don't we camp here?

Reid : ...Yeah. I'm starved!

Your party will be in front of fireworks and Reid will hold his sword.

Keele : What are you doing?

Reid : Huh? I'm making jerky. If you dry Egg Bear meat, it makes good emergency rations.

Keele : I'm afraid I can't agree. Over time, Eggbear meat undergoes a chemical transformation
        and loses much of its nutrients.

Reid : What're you talking about, Keele? You've never even eaten it!

Keele : I don't need to eat it to know. It's explained in detail in Volume 3, Chapter 21 of
        the Leonoa Encyclopedia.

Reid : Humph! I don't care what it says. I eat it all the time and I know I'm right!

Farah : Boys! Calm down. Does it matter either way?

Reid : Keele, don't even think I'm sharing this with you!

Keele : Fine. I could care less.

Farah : ...Boys will be boys.

If you see the message "It's now high tide", go back to previous room. This time you will see
the cave is full by water. Now you can get the treasures that before you can't get. Get
Circlet and Life Bottle from the chests. Now head to the very first entrance. Then head left
and go past the smaller pool of water. It will then say that the tide is high. Then proceed
upper right. The level of the water will be even higher. There will be a log for you to get
the Rapier from the chest. Now go back to the place where you camp before. Take the north
route. Get a Battle Axe from the chest. Take the right route where you see the blood. Here you
will find a man and 3 egg bear. Go to the north and get an Orange Gel from the pouch. Now go
to the north cave and search the wood for a Lens. Get back to the room where you got the
Battle Axe and take the north route to get back to the world map.

From the entrance, go up two screens. Climb the ladder. The house to the left is Traveler's
Shop. Climb the ladder again to the next screen. The first house is Morle Inn. The second
house to the left is Treetop. Here you will get a sequence.

Farah : Huh? Aren't you...

Old Man : All right, Simone! Grandpa will buy you anything you want!

Reid : Simone? Wasn't your name Katrine...?

Katrine : I guess Simone is the name of this man's grandchild. When I asked for directions to
          Inferia City, he thought I was her!

Farah : And you've been stuck here ever since...?

Katrine : He seemed so happy, I couldn't disappoint him...!

Farah : Simone suddenly has some urgent business in Inferia City! Is it all right if she goes?

Old Man : Is that so? Well, I guess Simone's all grown up now and has more important things to
          do. Take care of yourself, Simone!

Katrine : I...I will! Thank you for your help! I thought I might end up as Simone forever! I
          must be on my way now!

Katrine will leave them.

Reid : ...I wonder if she knows the way from here to Inferia City?

At Treetop, you can get a Holy Bottle if you search the barrel, not the big one. If you search
the small pumpkin, you can get another recipe from Wonder Chef. This time he will teach you
how to make Garden Salad. Now go to the bottom of the stairs and continue up. Go up again in
the next screen. There are two routes here : left and down. Take the left route first and
continue up. The big house at the top of tree belongs to Professor Mazet.

Keele : This is certain to be it. The domicile of Professor Mazet.

Reid : ...How long has it been since you've seen this professor of yours?

Keele : About three years.

Reid : Why does he have to live way out here like this?

Keele : I'm not certain. But if I know the Professor, I'll bet he's got some sort of good
        reason.

Now enter Mazet's house. You will see an old man.

Keele : Professor Mazet!

Mazet : Why, if it isn't Keele!

Keele : How have you been? I've come with a favor to ask of you!

Mazet : Calm down, now...! you haven't changed at all, Keele! Whenever you discovered
        something new, you never could contain your excitement.

Reid : Heh, heh. He knows you pretty well.

Farah : Leave it to the professor!

Keele : I...I apologize for my rudeness. Ummm...have you been well?

Mazet : Ha ha ha! That's quite all right. So tell me what brings you here.

Keele : Thank you! Well, the reason why...

Meredy : (Talking in Melnics language.)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
mazet : I see... So she says she's a Celestian?

Keele : Of course., I don't believe everything she says... But I would like your advice on how
        we may be able to communicate with her.

Mazet will take something from the cupboard.

Mazet : I would like all of you to have one of these.

Farah : They're pretty!

Mazet : It is called an Orz Earring.

Keele : Orz Earring...

Reid : Have you heard of it?

Keele : All high-level Craymel Mages wear it. They say that putting it on your ears allows you
        to communicate with Craymels.

Farah : Communicate? With...Craymels?!

Reid : Okay... But what does the Orz Earring have to do with Meredy?

Keele : I get it! Craymels speak the Melnics language, too!!

Mazet : Correct. The concept might be applicable to this instance as well.

Reid : But we aren't Craymel Mages...

Mazet : Try putting them on. Then listen carefully to what Meredy says.

Farah : It sounds easy! Let's try it!

They will wear the earrings.

Farah : Okay, I'm ready! Meredy, can you understand me? Answer me if you do!

Meredy : (Talking in Melnics language.)

Farah : Reid! Keele! Did you understand what she said?

Reid : Not a thing. It's not working at all.

Farah : Meredy, say something again. Tell me if you understand me!

Meredy : (Talking in Melnics language.)

Mazet : It may take some time. The Orz Earring will not work unless you are all on the same
        psychic wave...

Farah : Psychic...wave?

Reid : Doesn't sound easy...

Meredy will notice something missing.

Farah : What's the matter? Calm down...

Reid : Did you eat something bad?

Meredy : (Talking in Melnics language.)

Meredy will leave Mazet's house.

Reid : Hey, what do we do?

Farah : We can't let her go off by herself!

Reid : I guess not.

Keele : I don't understand! What's the matter with her?

Mazet : Keele. Listen... She's human, just like you. Remember... Okay?

Keele : Y...yes. I understand.

Reid : Where could Meredy have gone?

Now go to the backwoods of Morle. It's just down three screens from Mazet's house.

Enemies : Mocking Plant, Mahogany, Marcroid, Minicoid, Woods Worm, Evil Needles
Items : Knight Saber, Chirp Whistle, Iron Helm
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

At the entrance, you can see Meredy go down to the next screen, follow her. At the next
screen, Meredy will go to the left. Before following Meredy, get Knight Saber from the chest.
In the next screen, you can camp here to restores your HP. After that, go down to the next
screen. Now follow Meredy again to the next screen. Don't forget to take Chirp Whistle from
the chest. At the next screen, get an Iron Helm from the chest. Climb down the rope and go to
the left. You will see Meredy and Quickie here with a monster.

Farah : Look, over there!

Reid : Meredy!

Quickie : Kweekeeeeee!!

Meredy : (Talking in Melnics language.)

Farah : There's Quickie! Meredy's trying to save Quickie!

Reid : She was looking for Quickie...

Farah : We've got to save them!

Now go near the monster to make the battle occur.

Strategy : The Insect Plant is very big and have a lot of HP but it isn't very strong. Just
           hit him with your skill and the battle will be over in no time. I suggest you kill
           the Evil Needles first so you can concentrate your attack on Insect Plant.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Farah : Meredy! Everything's fine now. Meredy, I'm sorry. I didn't realize Quickie was gone.

Keele : Hey, do you understand?! Monsters are vicious and dangerous! You put us in danger,
        too! As part of the group, you don't go off alone like that! Got it?!

Farah : C'mon that's enough! After all, we're all fine.

Meredy : ...Sorry.

Keele : Hmph. Anyway, next time...

Keele and Farah will notice they can understand what Meresy said.

Meredy : Okay! You saved Meredy and Quickie. Thank you!

Reid : No need to thank us. Let's get back to Professor Mazet's house.

Meredy : You bet!

Farah : Reid?

Reid : What?

Keele : The earrings? Are you wearing them?

Reid : Yeah.

Meredy : Pretty!

Reid : Hey, stop that! Th...that tickles!

Meredy : Same as Meredy!

Reid : Well, yeah. We put these on so that we can communicate.

Farah : ...Reid?

Keele : Not a very sharp guy!

Reid : Huh?

Reid : I...I'm talking to Meredy???

Finally Reid understand what they are surprised about.

Meredy : Hweel! Yes you are talking ! It's Meredy. Reid, not too sharp.

Reid : Ow ow ow!

If you search the crystal, your HP will be restored. Now get out from this forest. On your way
to Mazet's house, in the place where you can camp, you will have some conversation.

Keele : Tell me! Have you really come from Celestia?

Meredy : You bet.

Keele : Let me see some evidence.

Meredy : (Talking in Melnics language.) What's eveedensh?

Keele : Then, is it true the world is in danger? What kind of technology does Celestia
        possess? What exactly is that stone attached to your forehead? Do all Celestians wear
        such a stone?! C'mon, tell me!

Meredy will push Keele down.

Meredy : Keele, ruuuude!

Keele : Wh...who's the rude one?!

Farah : Come on, cool down. Say, Meredy. Can you tell us the reason you came to Inferia?

Meredy : You bet. Ummm...Meredy...wanna stop the Grand Fall. Need help...

Keele : Grand Fall? ...That's something not found even in the Leonoa Encyclopedia.

Meredy : The Grand Fall is when Celestia and Inferia come closer together...and then... BOOOM!

Keele : inferia and Celestia, colliding?!

Meredy : (Talking in Melnics language.) You bet. Going to collide. Collide is very bad.

Farah : Th...that can't be...

Reid : Th...there and here, colliding?! Are you serious? What's gonna happen? Are we all gonna
       be flattened?!

Keele : Why had the balance collapsed? Was it a side effect of the raised Craymel pressure
        caused by Grobule distortion? Or is it that the localized stress from the Craymel Zone
        has caused a Doctark Effect in the Orbus Barrier?

Farah : Meredy, are you here because you know how to prevent the Grand Fall?

Meredy : You bet! Gather the Greater Craymels in Inferia. If we do that, the collision will
         stop.

Keele : Form a pact with the Greater Craymels? What nonsense! It's impossible! Craymels and
        people live in different worlds. That's especially true for Greater Craymels. Making
        contact is hard enough. A pact? Forget it!

Meredy : (Talking in Melnics language.) No problem!

Meredy : Celestian Craymel Cage! Greater Craymels enter from here.

Keele : Are you suggesting that Greater Craymels can be captured in a Celestia-made Craymel
        Cage?

Meredy : No, no! Craymel Cages work the same way as Inferian ones do. But Parasol is
         different! With this, Greater Craymels can enter the Craymel Cage!

Keele : So...if I use this, even my Craymel Cage will work?

Meredy : You bet! Greater Craymel can enter.

Farah : In other words... We cab save the world!

Meredy : You bet!

Farah : Maybe we can become heroes! Yeah, no problem!

Reid : Keele, can you bring them back to reality?

Keele : We'll ask Professor Mazet the whereabouts of the Greater Craymels.

Reid : Hey, you can't be serious... Go seek the Greater Craymels?

Keele : If we can meet the Greater Craymels, the truth about the Grand Fall may come to light.
        After all, the Greater Craymels do not lie.

Meredy : Keele! Help Meredy. Will you help? Please, please?!

Keele : Let me make it clear that this does not mean I believe all that stuff you've said! I
        only do this to discover the truth!!

Farah : How stubborn can you get? Come on, let's go!

Now go to Mazet's house.

Keele : As far as I know, this thing she calls a Parasol... ...doesn't have any special
        features or functions that enable its use with the Greater Craymels. What do you
        think, Professor?

Mazet : You must meet the Greater Craymels. There is nothing more I can tell you.

Keele : I understand...

Mazet : Take the Parasol.

Farah : Professor... Can you tell us where we can find the Greater Craymels?

Mazet : ...I know of one place where you might... Go out of Morle and go northeast for a
        little way and you'll see Undine Stream.

Farah : Undine...Stream...

Mazet : If it's true that disaster is upon us and that Meredy is the key to saving the world,
        I'm sure the Greater Craymels will appear before you.

Farah : Then... They must know much more than we do...

Mazet : Have you decided?

Keele : Of course! We'll find them!

Meredy : You bet!

Mazet : Take this map. I'm sure you'll find it quite useful!

You will received Inferia Map.

Farah : Thank you, Professor Mazet!

Mazet : Farah, I sense that you have the innate power to heal... I will teach you a new skill.

Farah : I don't know how to thank you...

Farah learned Detoxify.

Mazet : Keele. It seems you've learned to communicate with Meredy quite quickly...

Keele : Huh? Oh, yes. We had help from alittle incident...

Mazet : Remember those feelings. And pursue the unknowable. That...is true learning.

Keele : The unknowable?

Mazet : Heh heh heh. Maybe someday, you too will understand why I left the university...

Reid : After Morle is Undine Stream... I never meant to come this far.

Farah : Well... We've come this far. We can't go back to Rasheans now!

Meredy : Meredy sorry. It is Meredy's fault... Farah and Reid thrown out of the village
         because Hyades attacked.

Reid : Hyades, is he the one that smashed the Elder's house?

Farah : So, he was after you?

Reid : But why...?

Keele : Huh? What's wrong?

Farah : It's nothing. C'mon let's get going! The Undine Stream is northeast of Morle.

Enter Mazet's house again. Check the fireplace to get a Lens. Talk to Mazet again to get a
Monster Collection book. Now go to the second floor. Check the treasure chest. It's Wonder
Chef again! This time he will teach you how to make Fruit Juice. Now get back to the world map
and head northeast to reach Undine Stream. You can get a Poison Charm if you go north from
Undine Stream and walk inside the area surrounded by mountains.

Undine Stream
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Secret Area : North of Undine Stream, surrounded by mountain (Poison Charm)
Enemies : Egg Bear, Mounticore, Scorpion, Evil Needles, Starfish, Forest Hawk, Kick Frog, King
          Frog, Red Roper, Crusher, Warbear, Sea Slug
Items : 2x Poison Charm, Feather Robe. Silk Cloak, Mace, Iron Wrist, 2x Melange Gel, Hydra
        Dagger, Apple Shield
Lens : 1
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From the entrance, go up and get Poison Charm from the chest. Walk across the shallow water
and go up to get a Feather Robe from the chest. Now go down to get Silk Cloak from the chest.
Before crossing the shallow water to next area, get a Lens by searching the tree near the
shallow water. Now go north to the next screen. Get Mace and Iron Wrist from the chests in
this screen. After that, go up to the next screen. Here get another Poison Charm from the
chest. You can see a cave behind the waterfall a little north from the chest. Enter the cave.
You will see Undine here.

??? : You have done well. You have done well to come this far.

Reid : This is...

Farah : Could it be...?

You will see a lot of pink bubbles floating in the air.

??? : It has been a long time since I last saw a human.

Keele : T...the Greater Craymel! Undine?!

Farah : Whew... It's the real thing?

Keele : Greater Craymel Undine, keeper of the Holy Waters. Forgive us for treading upon this
        land. Oh Greater Craymel Undine, please tell us! Is it true that the Grand Fall will
        come to this world?

Undine : Do you think a Greater Craymel such as I would deign to converse with humans without
         reason?

Keele : Th... Then, it is true...

Meredy : Hweel!

Undine : Let me ask you then. What are your desires?

Meredy : I want you to go in here.

Farah : To save the world... We need the Greater Craymels' power. Won't you...help us?

Keele : I understand how rude this request must seem. But there is no other way!

Undine : ...In that case, I shall see if your actions speak as loud as your words. This is
         where the Craymels sleep. If you are prepared, venture further within.

The floating ball will be disappeared.

Reid : If you are prepared? Keele, what does she mean?

Keele : ...She wants us to fight her.

Reid : Fight?! She's a Greater Craymel! We can't win...

Keele : Undine... She's testing our power. We've got to give it our all.

Farah : Yeah! Nothing ventured, nothing gained! No problem!

Get Melange Gel from the chest. You can camp here to restores your HP, but you must get out
from this cave first and then enter again. Now go to down right direction to get to the next
screen. You can get Hydra Dagger from the chest, a little bit right, hidden by the leaves
after you across the water. Go up and get Melange Gel from the chest. Across the river and go
down to get Apple Shield from the chest. Now go up to the next screen and be ready for the big
battle against Undine. You can save your game first before fighting Undine.

Undine : I assume you are here because you are ready to fight me. There is no turning back...

Undine will appear in front of you.

Farah : We're ready!

Meredy : Ready!

Reid : How about you, Keele?

Keele : I'm...I'm ready!

Undine : Very well. Let us begin!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss : Undine
HP : 6800
EXP : 1360
Gald : 0
Attack : 100 (Spear of Baptism, Subterranean Divide, Aqua Edge)
Element Attack : Water
Defense : 268
Intelligence : 50
Strong : Water, Wind, Fire, Earth, Ice
Weak : Lightning
Rewards : Talisman(100%), Mental Bracelet(100%)

Strategy : This battle is very hard. If she use Spear of Baptism, you can't attack her because
           there is a water shield blocking your attack. She can do a lot of damage with Spear
           of Baptism and hit more than one character with this attack and she will cast it
           over the time. Bring a lot of Life Bottle in case one of your character died, you
           can revived him/her. Her weakness is lightning, so use lightning spell. Reid can
           use Demon Lightning Hammer or Lightning Blade to make a lot of damage.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Undine : You work together well. ...I will help you.

Keele : Thank you!!

Undine : However... ...I am merely one of the Primary Craymels of Inferia. In order to achieve
         your goal, you need all of the Greater Craymels.

Farah : All of the Greater Craymels...

Keele : Where are the other Greater Craymels?

Undine : I will now enter the Craymel Cage...

Keele : Please wait! Tell us where to find the other Greater Craymels!

Meredy : Undine... ...in the Craymel Cage.

Keele : Let me see, Meredy.

Meredy : You bet!

You will be prompted with Craymel Cage option.

Keele : What does the Vitality gauge mean?

Meredy : It shows how much energy the Greater Craymel has. Undine is the Greater Craymel of
         Water, so if you use Water Artes, her Vitality goes up.

Farah : What happened when the gauge is full?

Meredy : You can Summon the Greater Craymel, itself!

Reid : Wow! That's incredible! I can't wait to see!

Now get back to the world map. When you reach the waterfall, you will have some conversation.

Keele : This place looks safe, and the air seems really nice.

Reid : Yeah? What about it?

Farah : Why don't we take a little break here?

Keele : That doesn't sound like a bad idea.

They will enter the cave.

Reid : Hey, Keele? How many Greater Craymels are there?

Keele : I'm not quite sure. But it's said that there are generally four main types. Water,
        Fire, and Wind... the three basics Craymels, ...and the Light Craymel, which unifies
        them all.

Reid : Hmmm... And, where are the other Greater Craymels besides Undine?

Farah : Undine didn't tell us.

Keele : The planes of existence for humans and Craymels differ. Just for them to appear in
        front of humans is an extraordinary event.

Farah : Wow...really?

Reid : Hey! For our next destination... Why don't we head for Inferia?

Farah : Inferia...? You mean the King's castle?

Reid : Yeah. Gathering all the Craymels is way beyond our abilities. There isn't much more we
       can do, other than inform the King about the Grand Fall. Am I wrong?

Farah : But...we established a pact with Undine all on our own.

Reid : That was just plain luck. We can't afford any mistakes. We've gotta know our limits!

Keele : That's true...we do have an obligation to report this to the King.

Farah : Keele!

Keele : Imagine the consequences of seeking the Greater Craymels without the King's
        permission. We might attract needless suspicion.

Farah : ...I see your point.

Reid : It's decided, then. Our next destination is Inferia City.

Meredy : What about the Greater Craymels?

Reid : Don't worry. Once the King learns of the Grand Fall, he'll mobilize the army and find
       all the Greater Craymels.

Farah : Meredy, have faith in our King. Okay?

Keele : You have to go through the Forest of Temptation to get to Inferia City. Go southeast
        along the river. It's across the bridge.

So get back to the world map and go southeast across the bridge to reach the Forest of
Temptation.

Meredy : We can go further from here.

You will go to area 7.

Farah : The air here is so pure.

Reid : It looks like a rest area.

Keele : L...let's say we rest here. The place looks to be safe.

Farah : Say, Meredy. If we somehow gather all the Greater Craymels... What do we do then?

Meredy : (Talking in Melnics language.) Return to Celestia.

Farah : To Celestia...? How?

Meredy : I do not know!

Reid : It sounds as though that may be a bigger hurdle than gathering all the Greater
       Craymels.

Keele : ...If that's true, how did you come to Inferia? The two worlds have been out of
        contact for 2000 years.

Meredy : I came on a Craymel Craft. It can fly in the skies.

Keele : That's nonsense! That kind of technology is impossible.

Reid : Maybe you've never heard of it, but we saw it with our own eyes.

Farah : It was flying, but then it crashed.

Meredy : It is true!

Keele : ...Then take me to the crash site. I can't believe it unless I see it myself.

Farah : Keele, ummm... I don't want to disappoint you, but...

Keele : Well, let me first see the craft. After I measure the Craymel density in the area, I
        should be able to derive a hypothesis. Well, where's it at?

Meredy : Impossible. Craymel Craft explode into many, many pieces.

Keele : ...No.

Farah : It's true. Reid and I were there.

Reid : It was pretty scary.

Keele : It can't be destroyed! A flying machine... A revolutionary technology...

Farah : Well, I'm sure we'll find something to get us to Celestia. Yeah! No problem!!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Quickie : Kwekeee...kukuku.

Meredy : The air, feels unsafe...

Keele : This forest is where all the lost souls gather. If you're not careful, spirits hungry
        for a body could drain your life dry.

Reid : D...don't scare us like that.

Farah : No problem! Monster, pirate, whatever... I'll take 'em all on!!

Houses you can enter :
   -  Golden Dreams -> the only house in this area

At the entrance.

Reid : Whoa! This place is huge!

Farah : I thought Mintche was big, but this place is bigger yet!

Keele : Of course. It's the capital of the Inferia Empire.

Meredy : Hweel! There are so many people! They are all...umm... ...Inferians?!

The townspeople will surrounded you because Meredy acting strange.

Keele : Meredy, from here on, you can't dance, scream, or do anything out of the ordinary. The
        city is congested with people. Even the slightest awkwardness might cause people to
        suspect that you're a Celestian.

Meredy : Is being Celestian bad? They cannot suspect?

Keele : NO! Historically, Celestians have visited numerous disasters upon us. I'm quite
        certain that there are many who hold hatred for Celestians.

Meredy : Baiba! Celestians not responsible for causing disasters!

Keele : You need our help, right?

Farah : Meredy. It's unfortunate, but there's no question that there are a lot of people who
        dislike Celestians. Let's be careful, okay?

Meredy : You bet.

Keele : Don't forget.

Reid : All right...all right. Let's go and meet the King.

You will get a sequence if you go a little bit to the left from the entrance.

Man : Hey! You! You're from Rasheans, right?!

Farah : Huh? How did you know?

Man : I'm a tailor. I can tell just by the clothes you wear. You're wearing an incredibly old-
      fashioned Easheans dye.

Farah : What do you mean, old-fashioned?!

Man : You're from Rasheans. You should know. The popular fashions in this city were all
      originally based on Rasheans dye.

Farah : Really?

Man : Uh-huh. But it's been modified so much, it's not easy for an amateur to tell.

Farah : I see... I had no idea Rasheans dye was this well-known...

------

Houses you can enter :
   -  Hotel Inferia -> the big house at the bottom left
        * Bellebane -> 2nd floor if you search the vase between two doors
        * Cream Stew -> if you search the second vase near the man at 2nd floor
   -  Winner's Shop -> a little bit right from Hotel Inferia

Houses you can enter :
   -  Shop of Valor -> the house at the bottom right

   -  Imperial Playhouse -> a house north of Seyfert Sanctuary
        * a Lens -> if you check the plant near the stairs
        * Softcake -> if you search the plant near the left entrance

You will get a sequence with an old man near Sayfert Sanctuary.

Old Man : Wait!

Farah : What is it?

Old Man : You aren't accompanied by a Celestian, are you?

Reid : Of course not.

Old Man : Hmm. I guess you're right. If all Celestians were little girls like her, we wouldn't
          have any trouble at all.

------
Area 5
------

Houses you can enter :
   -  Street Vendor -> talk to the man with white clothes
   -  Royal Observatory of Astronomy -> the only house in this area

After get all the items you can find in the city, go north from area 5 to Inferia Castle and
talk to the guards.

Guard : What do ya want?

Farah : Er... We would like to see the King.

Guard : The King?!

Keele : This is a matter of grave concern for Inferia. The details are written in these
        papers. It's imperative that we see the King at once.

Guard : Hahaha-ha! You can't be serious?! Insolent fools! You want a trip to the dungeon? Or
        perhaps a beating right here?

Keele : Whoa!

Reid : We're leavin'!

Farah : Goodbye!

Back at area 5.

Keele : That's how guards are... They're all muscle and no brains. To think that our
        illustrious King is protected by those dingbats.

Meredy : Illustrious? Does that mean great?

Farah : Yeah. After all, he is the King!

Meredy : Why is he great?

Keele : I guess a Celestian wouldn't understand.

Meredy : What?!

Keele : The King is a sacred, noble presence. He's fundamentally different from people like
        us!

Farah : Meredy, doesn't Celestia have a King?

Meredy : No! We are all equal. No special people!

Farah : I see...

Keele : Perhaps the reason Celestia is so barbarous is because they've never known the rule of
        a King.

Meredy : Celestians not barbarians!

Reid : C'mon, stop the fruitless debate. We should be figuring out what to do next.

Keele : Let's go to the Royal Observatory of Astronomy.

Farah : You mean the tall building over here?

You will see the top of the building open, reveal a telescope.

Keele : That's right. It boasts the world's most precise telescope. Should they allow us to
        use it, we may be able to objectively determine if the Grand Fall is actually true or
        not.

Reid : How do you know we won't get kicked out again?

Keele : Top scientists from all over are gathered in the Observatory. They're not musclebound
        guards.

Farah : Then we should have no problem getting in. Let's go!

Now go enter Royal Observatory of Astronomy.

Reid : Should we be in here?

Farah : If it isn't okay, someone'll tell us, right?

Go to the fourth floor of this building.

Reid : Hey, Keele. It's off-limits to visitors!

Keele : We're not visitors. We have a purpose.

??? : Stop right there!

A man will go down the stairs and stand before you.

Man : No unauthorized persons are allowed inside.

Keele : Let us go to the Observation Room! We absolutely must us the telescope!

Man : ...What are you going to do?

Keele : I want to measure the change in distance between Inferia and Celestia!

Man : The change? The distance between Inferia and Celestia never changes! Taking the
      measurement is pointless!

Keele : How can you be so sure? Do you take periodic measurements?

Man : Well...no, but we did take one about two years ago...

Reid : Aren't those measurements a little outdated?

Man : Watch who you criticize! All measurements are carried out systematically under
      Chancellor Zosimos's orders! If you come anywhere near the Observation Room, I'll call
      the guards!

Keele : Please at least read my thesis! Anybody familiar with the Light Craymel theory would
        understand its significance immediately!

Man : Stay back! What is your problems?!

The man didn't read the papers and throw it out.

Keele : Let's go. We'll be in serious trouble if he calls the guards.

Farah : Keele!

Keele : There's still a way!

When you go down the stairs, an old man will appear from up the stairs.

Old Man : What was all that ruckus?

Man : I'm...I'm very sorry! I'll clean up right away!

Go outside this building. They will have some conversation outside.

Keele : ...Argh! It's appailing to think that an idiot like him is a researcher at one of the
        finest institutions...

reid : Keele, before you blame others, maybe you ought to admit your failures. You haven't
       been correct with any of your predictions up to this point!

Farah : Hey, watch what you say! Keele is trying as hard as he can to help Meredy and save the
        world! Right?

Keele : Er...right.

Reid : So what should we do? Are there any other ways we can meet the King?

Keele : There is. The Seyfert Sanctuary.

Reid : So we pray for Seyfert's help?

Keele : The church worships the Seyfert Ring as a symbol of their faith. Surely, they must
        have noticed the unusual appearance of the Seyfert Ring. We'll be fine this time.

Farah : Okay, no problem! Let's do it!

Keele : Let's head for Seyfert Sanctuary on the east edge of the town.

Now go to Area 4 and enter Seyfert Sanctuary.

Meredy : The glass... It is so pretty!

Keele : It's stained glass depicting the god of creation, Seyfert.

Meredy : Sey...fert...

Quickie : Kwekuuuu...kwe!

Now go a little deep inside.

Keele : Sorry to bother you, but... I'd like to speak to the archbishop.

Galvani : I am Archbishop Galvani.

Keele : Archbishop! My apologies! How rude of me!

Galvani : That's all right. So, what would you like to talk about?

Keele : I would like to speak to you about the peculiar change in the Seyfert Ring...

Galvani : Ah...

Keele : Do you know about the dark matter in the Seyfert Ring? It seems to be expanding at the
        rate of 300 langes a year.

Galvani : Yes, of course. The Sanctuary is aware of the change. Amd...?

Keele : I believe the Grand Fall will occur because of the change in the dark matter. Inferia
        and Celestia are coming closer to each other. Collision appears to be inevitable.
        Please...could you report this matter to the King and...?

Galvani : What idiotic nonsense!! How dare you associate the dark matter, the sign of the
          second coming of Seyfert, with such disaster!

Reid : Wha...?! the dark matter is a blessing?

Keele : ...So that's why my theory was rejected at the university...

Galvani : Seize them! Hand them over to the guards!!

Bishop : Yes, sir!

Reid : Uh-oh! Let's get out of here!!

Galvani : Seize them! Don't let them escape!

Outside Seyfert Sanctuary.

Roen : There they are! Grab them!

Farah : You're joking?!

Keele : Damn!

Meredy : No, no! I'm scared!

Meredy : (Talking in Melnics language.)

Farah : Reid, what now?

Reid : Good question.

Roen : I'm Captain Roen Lamoa of the Imperial Guards!! Surrender. Resistance is futile and
       will only hasten your deaths.

Reid : What are you gonna do with us?

Roen : Spreading lies all over town about the destruction of the world... Kneel before the
       King! And accept your death sentence!

Farah : Death sentence? Y...you mean...?

Reid : What do we do? Shall we take a chance and rumble?

Keele : Let's surrender quietly.

Keele : Think about it. It's a chance to gain the ear of the King.

Reid : Yeah, and receive the death sentence.

Keele : It's a one-shot chance to turn the tables...

Farah : ...I got you. I hope this works.

Meredy : ...I hope too.

Keele : I...I promise it'll work.

Reid : ...We surrender.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Reid : Hey, Keele. When's it going to happen?

You will be in a jail.

Reid : When are we going to get our chance to turn the tables?

Meredy : What will happen to us?

Farah : We're going to be all right... Right?

Keele : Damn it! I can't believe we got thrown in here like this!

Farah : Shh! I can hear voices above us!

King : I shall pass sentence. You have deceived us in an attempt to throw our country into
       turmoil... The spreading of sedition is a crime of the highest order. You are hereby
       sentenced...to death!

Reid : DEATH sentence?!

Meredy : What does death sentence mean? Are we in trouble?

Keele : P...please! Listen to what we have to say! If you would investigate, you'll see what's
        really causing the Grand Fall!

Arende : ...They seem to be shouting something.

Roen : Nothing but the blather of foolish criminals. It is not for you to hear, Princess
       Arende.

Arende : What are they saying? Father, what are they saying?

King : Hmm...

Queen : Arende! You should pay no heed to the talk of commoners. Your beautiful heart will be
        sullied! They are rude and violent ruffians who live in a different world from yours.

King : Roen! Quit your dawdling! Silence the criminals at once!

Roen : Yes, M'lady! Prepare to flood the tank!

Arende : I'm feeling faint...

Queen : Roen!!

Roen : Begin flooding!

Water will be flooding the tank.

Meredy : Baiba!

Keele : Urk! Let go of me!

Keele : Damn it! Let us out of here!

Keele : (Talking in Melnics language.) Undine! Undine, help us! Help! We're going to drown! I
        guess we can't call on the Greater Craymels as if they're servants.

Farah : I've found it!

Reid : What?

Keele : Let's stop struggling. We can't escape our fate. We might as well face our deaths with
        peace and tranquility.

Farah : Keele! Don't give up now! I'm not going to die in a dark and gloomy place like this!
        Look! Down here! There's a valve!

Keele : A valve? To drain the water?

Farah : Maybe... Let's dive under and see!

Reid : Hey! Wait! It's dangerous!

Farah : Yeah, but somebody's got to do it.

The water will be flooding half the tank.

Reid : Okay... I'll do it!

Farah : Thanks, Reid!

Reid will swim under the water and try to move the valve. But he can't do it so he return
above the water. You will see a ladder hanging from above.

Reid : *Gasp*...! It won't open! Huh? Where's Keele and Meredy?

Farah : Oh... They left before us...

Reid : Left?! You mean they're...

Farah : A rope dropped down from above. See?!

Reid : Huh? You mean... ...my effort was for nothing?

Farah : Uh... Well...thanks for trying. Hey! Reid!!

Above the tank.

King ; Be grateful! Your sentence has been commuted, thanks to Chancellor Zosimos of the Royal
       Observatory of Astronomy.

Keele : You are... Chancellor Zosimos?

Zosimos : Are you the one responsible for writing this treatise?

Keele : Yes, sir. You've read my paper, sir?

Zosimos : We measured the distance between the worlds and discovered the worlds to be 2000
          langes closer than before...

Keele : Just as I thought!

Zosimos : So long as we fail to understand the cause of this phenomenon, we cannot pass final
          judgement. As such, it would be regretful to let the death sentence stand.

Keele : Th...thank you!

Arende : That's wonderful.

Meredy : That is wonderful!

Arende : Heehee...

Queen : Arende! Don't interrupt!

Zosimos : Your Majesty, I shall now assume full responsibility for these individuals.

King : ...Very well. Take care to remain vigilant.

Zosimos : Yes, Sire! There is still much that needs to be investigated. Will you cooperate
          with me?

Keele : Yes, of course! Gladly!

King : You may all remain within the castle for the time being.

Farah : Yes, Sire!

Roen : The guest room is on the second floor of the west tower. Go when you wish. I will
       follow later.

Go to the guest room. Go right and down the stairs and enter the big door.

Meredy : It's fluffy and soft!

Roen will enter the room.

Reid : There are only two beds?

Roen : Of course not. This isn't a peasant house.

You will go to the next room.

Meredy/Farah/Reid : Whoa...

Meredy : This is nice and soft, too!

They will go back to the previous room.

Roen : Listen up, commoners! Henceforth, discussion contrary to Inferia Empire doctrine will
       not be tolerated! If you disobey me... You shall be sentenced to death immediately! Is
       that clear?

Farah : Crystal clear.

Reid : Okay, okay.

Meredy : The death penalty is scary...

Roen : Hmph! I want you out of here as soon as possible. It's starting to stink like peasants!

Roen will leave the room.

Reid : Whew. We're finally done!

Meredy : Huh? Done?

Reid : There's nothing to worry about anymore. Keele and Zosimos are going to figure out
       what's behind the Grand Fall. And when they do, the King will do something about it.

At Observation Room.

Man : I'm finished with the adjustments!

Zosimos : Good job. What's your name?

Keele : Keele Zeibel!

Zosimos : If the distance between the two worlds is changing, we'll have to recalculate a
          large variety of measurements... Keele, will you help us?

Keele : Me? Of course!!

Back at guest room.

Reid : And so, we've accomplished our role. Our long journey is over! Now we can sit back and
       relax!

Meredy : It is not over! Meredy must return to Celestia with the Greater Craymels! Return to
         Celestia. Reid not over yet!

Meredy will jump above Reid.

Reid : urk...! Can't...breathe!

Farah : That's right... There's still work for us to do. We shouldn't be relying on the King
        for everything. We have to at least find out how to get Meredy home to Celestia.

Reid : That's easier said than done.

Farah : no problem! We can do it if we work together! Right, Meredy?

Meredy : No problem! Thank you, Farah!

Farah : Meredy, let's go sleep in the other room.

Meredy : No! Meredy want to be with Reid! We all sleep together!

Farah : N...NO!

Meredy : Why?

Farah : No is no!

Meredy : ...Why not?

Reid : G'night!

Farah : See? Reid says he's going to sleep.

Meredy : ...Okay.

They will go to the other room.

Reid : Now I'm wide awake...

At Observation Room.

Zosimos : I'm a little tired. Keele, take over for me.

Keele : Y...yes, sir!

Zosimos : Do you know how to operate it?

Keele : Yes, I learned how at the university.

Keele will see through the telescope.

Keele : In...incredible!!

Keele : So this is...Celestia...

Zosimos : Keele. Keele...

Keele : Oh... My apologies! I got a little carried away... Can...can I help you?

Zosimos : Yes, I've been wondering... What lead you to predict the Grand Fall in the first
          place?

Keele : Well, it was Meredy... Um, no, I mean... It just hit me all of a sudden.

Zosimos : I see. Well, you'll have to tell me all about it some time. But first we have to
          finish our work.

Back at guest room.

Reid : I guess Keele stayed up all night.

Farah : He's probably caught up in his research. I'm sure Keele can...

Keele will enter the room.

Meredy : Keele!

Reid : Did you figure out what's causing the Grand Fall?

Keele : Not yet... But we're getting there.

Farah : I knew you'd be giving it your all! You must be tired. You should sleep.

Reid : ...Shh! Someone's coming!

Roen : Please... If the Queen should see you here... I beg of you! I want to speak with the
       commoners just this once.

Roen and Arende will enter the room.

Roen : ...! You are all awake.

Reid : What an honor... To have the princess come along to awaken us.

Roen : The...the reason why...

Arende : I asked him to let me come along. I was...worried about all of you.

Farah : Thank you for your concern. Thanks to you, we've been able to get plenty of rest.

Meredy : You are pretty. More pretty than the stained glass in the sanctuary.

Roen : Why, you... You impertinent little dog!

Arende : ...Thank you. I am Arende, the Princess of Inferia.

Meredy : A...rende? Me Meredy!

Meredy/Arende : Heehee!

Roen : The King is about to make an important announcement in the Audience Chamber. Usually,
       only nobles and royalty are invited, but Chancellor Zosimos has seen to it that you
       can attend. If you have no objections, come now!

Search the drawer beside the bed for a Lens. After that, go down the stairs and enter the
door. It is a kitchen. You can get a Pine Gel if you search the basket with fruits. Go down
the stairs again and search the chest for a Lemon Gel. Now go back to the tank place and go
down the stairs. Go down again and get Dark Bottle if you search the vase near the stairs. Now
go outside from the tower and you will see Arende and Roen.

Arende : I would like to speak to them a little more.

Roen : You mustn't, my lady. The commoners were allowed within the castle walls because we
       have a crisis. By no means is this a standard practice.

Arende : Crisis? We have a crisis?

Roen : Er...well...

Arende : When will he return? If he were here, we wouldn't have anything to worry about...
         *Sigh* Oh, how I want to see him again.

Roen : He is surely a great Senior Knight. However, I'm confident that my swordsmanship,
       lineage, and loyalty are just as impressive. I, Roen Lamoa, am ready to travel to the
       ends of Orbus for the Princess.

Arende : I must be on my way now. I wouldn't want to be late and upset Mother. Farewell.

Farah : I wonder what the King has to say.

Keele : He'll likely reveal the plan for dealing with the Grand Fall...

Meredy : We need Greater Craymels!

Keele : I've discussed it with Chancellor Zosimos, but I don't know if he managed to gather
        sufficient objective evidence...

Now enter the main hall.

Knight : Long live the King of Inferia! Long live the Inferia Empire!

Knight : Long live the King of Inferia! Long live the Inferia Empire!

King : Listen to me well, all of you. Inferia is facing a terrible danger. The Royal
       Observatory of Astronomy has conducted an investigation of the situation. A plan has
       been decided as of this morning. You shall now be given an explanation. Chancellor
       Zosimos, come forward!

Zosimos : Yes, your majesty. The two worlds, Celestia and Inferia, are shifting closer and
          closer together even as we speak. Based on the measurements taken at the
          observatory, we can expect impact some 100 sohme from now. We believe that a
          malevolent Celestian plot is at the root of this situation! Not satisfied with the
          numerous disasters they have previously visited upon us, they plan to annihilate the
          entire world!

King : We pledge to thoroughly resist this Celestian campaign of destruction with all of our
       might. My good Inferians... Prepare for battle!

Zosimos : According to the ancient scriptures, there exists what is called the Bridge of
          Light... It is the only known means of crossing over to Celestia. If the Bridge of
          Light can be discovered, we can send a contingent of our elite troops to Celestia
          and prevent the Grand Fall.

King : I expect your unwavering support during this time of crisis. We shall show the
       Celestian barbarians the true might of the Inferia Empire!

Knight : Long live the King of Inferia! Long live the Inferia Empire!

Knight : Long live the King of Inferia! Long live the Inferia Empire!

King : This meeting is adjourned.

All the people will leave the main hall.

Meredy : Baiba! No...no...no! That is not right!

Reid : Hey, Keele! What does this mean?!

Keele : ...I don't believe this. Chancellor Zosimos! What is going on?! Just yesterday, didn't
        you say that it's impossible for anybody to cause the Grand Fall on purpose?!

Zosimos : Keele, you could become a magnificent scholar some day... ...But first, realize that
          academia must also obey the King's will.

Farah : What is the Bridge of Light? Where is it?

Zosimos : It's a bridge to Celestia that was discovered some 30 years ago by a Craymel Mage
          named Balir. We don't know its location or method of operation as of yet.

Farah : So this person crossed over into Celestia using the Bridge of Light? That's amazing! I
        never heard this story!

Zosimos : It's no surprise that you do not know. He never returned.

Roen : Haven't you already overstayed your welcome?! You have served your purpose. Leave the
       castle immediately.

You will be out of Inferia Castle.

Roen : Hmph! Take this and get out of my sight!

Reid : Is this...a boarding pass?

Roen : With this, you can board any of our Inferia ships. A precious item like this isn't
       something normally bestowed upon a commoner. You should be grateful.

You will received Boarding Pass.

Farah : So...do you really believe that the Celestians are causing the Grand Fall?

Roen : Of course. That's what the King said.

Farah : Don't you think it's strange that the barbarous Celestians are capable of doing
        something that Inferians can't do?

Roen : Are you saying that the King is wrong?!

Farah : N...no! Of course, not! I'll be on my way now. Goodbye!

Roen will called Keele.

Roen : Hey, you! Wait.

At Area 5.

Farah : Since the King isn't going to help us, I guess we have no choice but to do it
        ourselves.

Reid : Are you serious?!

Meredy : Let's collect Greater Craymels. Then we go to Celestia!

Farah : Right. We know the Bridge of Light is the passage to Celestia. All we need to do now
        is to find the Greater Craymels!

Meredy : Keele, you are late! We are leaving now!

Keele : Uh...right...

Farah : Say, why don't we go to the Port of Inferia and put the Boarding Pass to good use?

Now go to Observation Room, fifth floor of Royal Observatory of Astronomy. Search the paper
south of the telescope for a Lens. Now get back to the world map and go north to reach Port of
Inferia.

Sailor : Will you take this ship to Barole Port?

Choose yes.

Farah : Yes, please! We want to go!

Sailor : We'll be departing soon! Hurry on aboard!

Reid, Farah and Meredy will aboard the ship but Keele didn't.

Meredy : Keele?

Reid : Did you forget something?

Farah : What's the matter?

Keele : I...I can't go.

Farah : What? What do you mean?

Keele : Chancellor Zosimos is asking for my help...to find the Bridge of Light...

Farah : You can't be serious!! You're going to help with the war effort? You still trust them

Meredy : Baiba!

Keele : It was my dream to work at the Royal Observatory of Astronomy.

Farah : ...Fine. do what you want, Keele.

Keele : ...Goodbye.

Keele will leave the party.

Meredy : What?!

Farah : What can we do? It's his life. C'mon! We can do it on our own! No problem!

Sailor : Come on, now! It's time to depart. Getting on or staying off?

Farah : We're getting on!

Reid : Let's go, Meredy!

Meredy : You bet...

You will received Keele's equipment.

You will see the ship is sailing off. Now you can see your party in a cabin.

Farah : I wonder what Keele is doing?

Reid : his dreams came true. He's probably having a great time.

Farah : Meredy, forgive him. Keele also has things he wants to do.

Meredy : Meredy already forgive him. But... Meredy is Celestian. And so maybe Keele will
         become my enemy?

Farah : N...no at all!

Meredy : Re...really? No?

Farah : Keele just wants to learn many things. He won't be your enemy. ...Trust him.

Reid : Trust...?

The house behind the guy who offer Arithmetic contest is Heavy Arms. Go outside Heavy Arms
through upper left door. Talk to the girl to get an Elixir. Search the chest for Shamsel. Now
go to the left screen and you will see an event and Farah will rushed over to the place of
event.

Reid : It looks like trouble. We better not get involved... Farah?!

Meredy : Too late.

Man : what do you want?! Get out of my way now!

Farah : No! I'm not going anywhere. Don't you think it's pathetic for a grown-up to bully a
        kid?!

Man : What're you blabbering about?! Look! He's infamous around here for...

Kid : Boo hoo! He was mean to me! I'm just a little kid! Boo hoo...boo hoo!

The man will beating the kid.

Farah : What are you DOING?!

Farah will beating back the man and the kid will run away.

Kid : Serves you right!

Farah : Huh? What...?

Man : You let him get AWAY! That brat's a habitual thief!!

Farah : HUH?! But he's just a kid...

Man : Bad kids are bad! To think that we finally got him today... What's your problem, girl?!

Farah : Ah, er, well, it was like... I just didn't know...

Man : What kind of excuse is that?! That's right!! We want payback!!

Man : Come to think of it... We can use you...

Reid : We're sorry, really! We just came into port...

Man : That's a lame excuse!

Reid : That's true...

A mysterious man will come to help your party.

Mysterious Man : Article 87 of Inferia Trading Law. Employment is only to take effect when
                 both parties are in accord... In other words, you can't force her to work for
                 you without her consent.

Man : D...do you have a problem?!

Mysterious Man : It's the King's law. Your crates are sticking out 1.5 Lange into the public
                 street. That's either 3 years in jail or a fine of 1,000 Gald. On top of
                 that, double pricing...? There are no defenses for such violations... Before
                 you punish a child, maybe you should follow the law yourself, don't you
                 think?

Man : Okay, okay. Please! Forget this happened!

All the men will run away.

Farah : We're saved! ...I think.

Reid : Farah! Stickin' your nose in when you don't even know what's going on!

Farah : ...Sorry.

Meredy : (Talking in Melnics language.) Wait!!

Farah : Uh...um, thank you so much! My name is Farah. Please let us repay you somehow.

Ras : I am...Ras. That was an amusing diversion. It is I who should thank you.

Farah has earned the title of Reckless.

You will be at Scaroni Grill.

Farah : Umm... Thank you so much for helping me!

Meredy : Thank you!

Farah : When I thought the kid was getting bullied, I couldn't stand to just watch.

Ras : Are you always so...single-minded?

Farah : ...Huh?

Reid : She's been that way forever!

Ras : Well. I'm very sorry... I feel sorry for those around you.

Reid : So you understand?! ...Understand the trouble I have to deal with?

Farah : When did I ever cause trouble for you?

Reid : It's not the first time something like this has happened! When she heard a kid was
       drowning, she jumped right in and nearly drowned herself! Do people who can barely swim
       normally do that? And the time before that, she felt sorry for an Egg Bear caught in a
       trap and...

Farah : Are you finished? Why do you still remember all of this?

Reid : Because I had to clean up after you EVERY SINGLE TIME!

Ras : I enjoyed the meal.

Meredy : Meredy done too!

Farah : Ahem. You seem quite knowledgeable about the law. What is your profession, if I may
        ask?

Reid : A pot?

Ras : It's a double metal pot, made as a decoration for the Royal Family in the late Melnics
      Civilization period. Normally 10,000 Gald, it's now only 5,000!

Reid : Are you a merchant?

Ras : You could say that... It's a real bargain. This beauty was found while exploring Sylph
      Cavern.

Farah : Sylph Cavern!

Ras : Ah. It's a cave west of Barole. The characteristics of this pot are evident on the
      surface.

Farah : Take us there!

Ras : This pot...

Farah : I don't want it! Will you show us the way to Sylph Cavern?

Ras : 50,000 Gald. If you pay me 50,000 Gald, I'll show you the way to Sylph Cavern.

Select "Don't Pay".

Farah : I can't pay that kind of money.

Ras : I see... In that case, I'll show you for free this time. I've been thinking of going
      back to Sylph Cavern again, anyway.

Farah : Thank you!

Ras : When you are prepared and ready, meet me in front of the Inn. I'll be there after I take
      care of some business.

Farah : Ras! I've been wondering... What is that wonderful scent surrounding this town?

Ras : Oh, that? That's the fragrance of the Donies flowers.

Meredy : Is it the flower on Ras's hat?

Ras : Yes. It's my favorite flower.

Farah : Donies...

Ras : Well, I'll see you later.

Ras will leave your party.

Farah : We should get ready, too!

Now get back to the place where the previous event occur. Search the box with red fruits near
the way you came in for Water Crystal. The house at upper screen is Shop of Desire. Search the
gold vase near the entrance for a Lens. The house in the middle is Shop of Need. Now go to the
bottom right screen.

Meredy : Ras!

Meredy will hug Ras.

Meredy : Baiba!

Ras : Watch out!

You will see the shiny thing again just like Reid.

Ras : ...What is this?

Farah : It's the same light as you, Reid.

Meredy will hug Ras again and you will see the shiny thing again.

Quickie : Kweeek, kweee, kweee, keee!

Meredy : Hweel!! Ras has Fibrill, too! Let's go together! For sure! Together!

Quickie : Kweeek, kweee, kweee, keee!

Ras : What in the world is this light...?

Farah : Hmm? I don't know. Anyway! C'mon, let's go!

Farah : Reid?

Reid : Ah...right.

The first house at upper left is Barole Bookstore. You will find Katrine again there.

Katrine : Thank you very much.

Farah : Katrine?! Weren't you supposed to go to Inferia City?

Katrine : Uh, well... I thought I was in Inferia City, but...

Reid : It turned out to be Barole.

Katrine : But I'm fine! I now have the map of the world memorized. This time, I'll be sure to
          reach Pierre and Inferia City!!

Reid : Is she really going to be all right?

Farah : She's memorized the entire map of the world. No problem!

Shopkeeper : Excuse me... This map is a city guide map for Barole...

The house at upper right screen is Barole Inn. You can find a Dark Bottle if you search the
middle north vase. Go to the left door to the bedroom and search the wooden cupboard at the
upper right screen. It's Wonder Chef again. This time he will teach you how to make Pot Pie.
Now get back to the world map and go southwest to Sylph Cavern.

Go north from the entrance and you will be in an open area. Go north again and you will see
two guards.

Reid : Hey, those are Inferia Guards.

Ras : Let me speak to them. Wait here for a moment.

Ras will talk to the guards.

Farah : I wonder if Ras can convince them to let us through...?

Reid : I don't know...Inferia Guards can be as stubborn as mules.

Ras : Sorry to keep you waiting. Let's enter, shall we?

Farah : How did you manage to reason with them? You're such a salesman! You must be a great
        talker.

Ras : Is that supposed to be a compliment?

Meredy : You bet! Ras is really something!

Farah : Let's go, Reid.

Reid : Don't you find this strange? It shouldn't be this easy to enter land annexed by the
       King..

Farah : It's his aura. The guards probably trust his aura.

Reid : Aura?

Farah : Come on, Reid! Hurry! First thing's first. Let's go find the Wind Craymel!

Go north along the way to find a hole with wind come out of it. Go to the hole when the wind
come out of it and you will be taken up above. Go a little bit to the left to get Storm Shield
from the chest. Go through the little typhoon, be careful not to hit them because it will
decrease your HP then go down the hole. Now go a little bit to the left and you will be taken
outside. Go to this area again and you will have some conversation.

Ras : You can't cross here. The wind's too strong.

Reid : So what are we supposed to do?

Ras : Stand back.

Ras will throw a rope to the other side.

Ras : Now if we hold onto the rope as we cross, we'll be fine.

Reid : Pretty handy item you've got there.

Now go across with the help of rope to the other side. Go to the hole and you will be taken
above. Get Melange Gel from the pouch and go down the hole. Go to the left to the next screen
and you will have some conversation down there.

Ras : Being exposed to wind for a long time can take a lot out of you. What do you think?
      Maybe it's time to get some rest.

Reid : Huh? I'm still feeling great.

Ras : When you push too hard you wind up having accidents. Let's get some rest!

Meredy : You bet!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ras : Reid... Your swordplay is impressive. You have a unique style. Where did you learn it?

Reid : ...Self-taught. I'm a hunter.

Meredy : Hey, hey. Ras, what are you wearing? It's pretty...

Ras : Aaah. This is a Compass Key.

Meredy : Com...pass...key?

Ras : Yes. A Compass Key. It's a key with mysterious power that leads you to the right path.

Farah : Hey, I've heard about those! So that's what they look like...

Reid : ...Ras. So where does your path lead you?

Ras : Earning money, of course. After all, I'm a merchant. If I may ask...why do you all want
      to meet the Greater Craymels?

Farah : Huh? Is that strange? To want to meet them?

Ras : It doesn't seem to be mere curiosity. I feel that there's a... A sense of purpose.

Meredy : (Talking in Melnics language.) Ras knows much. With Greater Craymels, we will...

Reid : W...wait a minute, Meredy!

Farah : Why not? Let me explain to Ras. I'm sure he will be able to help us. Right?!

Ras : You wish to form a pact with the Greater Craymels to save the world from the Grand Fall?

Farah : Please believe us. I know this goes against all reasoning, but...

Ras : You seem joyful somehow.

Farah : ...I may have been waiting for a day like this to come for a long time. It makes me
        happy to think that I just might save the lives of people around the world. And...

Ras : Yes?

Farah : It makes me feel at ease.

Ras : Oh...?

Farah : Knowing that my efforts helped to bring happiness to others makes me
        feel...comfortable. I've always felt this way.

Ras : I see. Those are deep wounds... What is it that has made you so downhearted? From what
      do you run?

Farah : Run? Me? ...How rude!! Nothing would make me run!!

Ras : Really?

Farah : Well...dried-up slug carcasses aren't exactly my favorite... But that's about it.

Ras : ...Heh. I understand. I will broach the subject no more.

Farah : But it's the truth!

Ras : I'm sorry, my dear. Thank you for the interesting chat. Let us sleep...we have an early
      morning.

Farah : Yeah... Good night.

Now go all the way to the right to the next screen. The upper right screen will take you back
outside, so go to the hole at this screen to get above. Take another Melange Gel from the
chest and go down the hole at this screen. Go up above the hole at this screen. Up ahead, you
will see 3 routes. Take the middle one and you will fall down. Get Mental Ring from the chest.
Now move a little to the left and you will be taken outside. Now get back to the screen where
you fell down. This time take the upper route or the bottom one to get Assault Dagger and 1800
Gald. Don't go down the hole yet but go to the right edge to get a Lens. Now go down the hole
and get an Orange Gel and Lemon Gel from the pouch. Now go to the hole that take you above and
then go down the hole at this screen. Get Needle Glove from the chest at the upper left screen
and go above from the hole to get Arc Wind from the chest. Go down the hole again and this
time enter the bottom cave. Get a Life Bottle from the pouch and just follow the way to the
next screen. Here you will fight the Greater Craymels, Sylph.

Farah : Yoo-hoo! Where are you, Greater Craymels...?

Reid : Shhh, not so loud!

You will see a green typhoon and reveal a little green fairy.

Sylph : Hey there!

Meredy : The Greater Wind Craymel!!

Reid : This twerp?

Sylph : I am Sylph, the Greater Wind Craymel. I congratulate you for making it this far.

Meredy : Sylph. We have request.

Sylph : I know. You want me to get onto that cage, right?

Farah : Please. Undine is already inside.

Sylph : Hmm, what should I do? It's not as if I have nothing else to do.

Reid : If you'd like, we can show you our strength.

Sylph : Not wasting any time, are you? But what I want to see is your heart, not your
        strength.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss : Sylph + 2z Arms(HP: 4500, STR: Wind)
HP : 6600
EXP : 1929
Gald : 0
Attack : 170 (Air Thrust, Sylphid Arrow, Sagittarius Arrow, Wind Blade)
Element Attack : Wind
Defense : 200
Intelligence : 80
Strong : Wind, Water, Fire, Lightning, Ice
Weak : Earth
Rewards : Protect Ring(100%), Life Bottle(100%)

Strategy : Kill the two Arms first to make this battle a lot easier. It's so hard to hit Sylph
           because Sylph is very small and floating in the air. Use jumping attack to make
           damage on it. Be careful with its spell because it can make a major damage. Bring a
           lot of healing items and Life Bottle just in case one of your character died.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sylph : Hey...you're pretty tough for a bunch of humans!

Meredy : Can you enter the Craymel Cage?

Sylph : Hmm... What should I do?

Reid : Damn it! We have no time to be fooling around!

Ras : Oh great Sylph. We humans are without power. In order to save the world, we beg you to
      lend us your power.

Sylph : You're lost without me?

Ras : That is correct. You are our only hope.

Sylph : All right... Fine. I'll get into that thing.

Reid : ...Good grief! He's a real/ handful.

Sylph : By the way, the Greater Fire Craymel lives in a really hot place. He's not mature like
        me, so good luck getting him to cooperate.

Reid : Whew... I'm exhausted.

Meredy : Now Undine and Sylph on our side!

Farah : The Greater Fire Craymel is the only Primary Craymel left. I wonder if he really is
        more immature than Sylph?

Reid : At any rate, let's get out of here.

Farah : Good idea.

Now get back outside and you will have some conversation.

Quickie : Kueeekeee, kwwwkeee, kwwwkeee, keee...

Meredy : What is it, Quickie?

Reid : you hungry? I'm hungry, too.

Guard : Excuse me...

Ras : Huh? Oh...excuse me a minute.

Quickie : Kweeek, kweeekeee, keee, keee!

Farah : Are we in trouble? Do they know we have Sylph?

Ras : Huh? No, I don't think so.

Reid : What's going on? What did the Inferia Guards say?

Ras : I have a customer. There's someone who is interested in my pot... I am sorry, but I must
      be going.

Farah : Huh? You're leaving us, Ras?

Meredy will hug Ras.

Meredy : Noooo! Do not go! Please help, Ras! Ras has lots of Fibrill!

Ras : I must follow the path to which I am called. I am sorry...

Farah : Come on, Meredy! Mustn't be selfish now.

Meredy : Baiba!

Farah : It's okay! We can manage by ourselves. That's right! No problem!

Meredy : You bet...

Farah : Ras, thanks a million for showing us the way. Good luck with your business!!

Ras : ...Thanks. All of you...take care.

Ras will leave your party.

Meredy : Hween... So painful...

Farah : What you mean to say is 'sad'. ...He was a good person. Though he could be awfully
        rude...

Reid : ...And just when I thought I could leave the rest to him, he leaves.

Meredy will hug Reid.

Meredy : Nooo, nooo! You can't go away too, Reid!!

Reid : Do you need this weird, glowing thing? What the heck is it, anyway?

Meredy : Strong Fibrill!

Meredy : (Talking in Melnics language.) ...Sorry. Not know how to explain...

Farah : But, you know, Reid, don't you think it's a good thing to be needed?

Reid : I wonder...

Quickie will run away.

Meredy : Quickie!

Meredy will follow Quickie.

Farah : Uh-oh! Come on, Reid! We better hurry, too!

Farah and Reid will follow Meredy. You will received Ras's equipment.

Quickie : Kweekee, kweekee!

You will see Keele.

Meredy : Keele!! What are you doing here?

Quickie : Kweeekeee!

Keele : I learned of your whereabouts in the town of Barole. It's a long story... By the
        way... I saw an unfamiliar face go by... Who was that?!

Meredy : That was Ras. A new member of our party. ...Was anyway.

Keele : A new member...? You didn't go and tell him everything, did you?

Meredy : You bet! We told everything.

Keele : Why did you do that for?! Are you crazy? Do you want to make us criminals again?

Quickie : Kweekee keee...

Meredy : But Ras has strong Fibrill...

Keele : So what?! Explain it to me so I can actually understand!

Reid : Keele! Stop scaring Meredy.

Farah : Ras is just a merchant. He wouldn't report us to the King.

Reid : Hey, what I want to know is why you're here. Why aren't you at the Royal Observatory?
       Did they send you packing already? W...wait a minute. Are you serious...?

Farah : I'm so glad you came back to join us. I mean, it was really hard without you, Keele.

Keele : Sorry...

Farah : No, no. You don't need to apologize. Everything is A-okay. Right?

Reid : So, what do we do next?

Farah : We have to find the Greater Fire Craymel, of course. ...In some really hot place.

Sylph : Here! You can have the Aerialboard. It's one of the Craymel Artes. If you press square
        at the Map screen, it's on the menu. It can travel over flat land, rivers, and oceans
        in any world where there are Wind Craymels. Press circle if you want to walk again.

Keele : Are you suggesting we use the Aerialboard to find the Greater Fire Craymel ourselves?

Sylph : You're a sharp one. I'll give this Arte to you. I wish you well. Bye now!

Go down one screen and you will have alittle conversation.

Keele : It's hard to believe we now have Sylph's cooperation, too.

Meredy : We have two greater Craymels. Now we can Fringe!

Keele : Fringe?

Meredy : Make new Craymel Arte! Except, it is no good if Greater Craymels are all in one
         Craymel Cage. Separate the Greater Craymels, then Fringe! Give it a try.

Keele : I get it... Depending on how you combine Greater Craymels, different Craymel Artes are
        formed. If we find more Greater Craymels, we should try out different combinations.

Farah : So if they aren't kept separate, will the Craymel Artes that have already formed
        become useless?

Meredy : You bet. Keep Greater Craymels divided. To be strong, that is the secret.

Reid : Can you imagine how many different Craymel Artes can be formed by trying different
       combinations? Keele, you figure out the rest!

Keele : What's the Lv that appears when you view a Greater Craymel?

Meredy : Lv? ...Oh! You mean Level! If Greater Craymel gains experience and Level goes up, we
         can form many more Craymel Artes.

Keele : That must mean... If we raise the Levels and then Fringe, we can form more powerful
        Craymel Artes!

Meredy : You bet! Right, Reid?

Reid : It's no use asking Reid. All this stuff probably goes right over his head.

Reid : Oh, yeah?!

Now go to Chambard, it's in the large desert, west from Sylph Cavern.

Sailor : Whatever your excuse, a crime's a crime!

Farah : Hey, isn't that Katrine, from Mintche University? This girl must attaend the Academic
        Conference in Inferia City! Couldn't you just let it pass this once?

Sailor : No! I can't overlook a crime! But I might reconsider if you take the punishment in
         her place.

Farah : All right. I'll do it!

Sailor : You don't even know what the punishment is! You're gonna regret it!

Katrine : Oh, no! I'll take the punishment myself.

Farah : Don't worry! No problem!

Sailor : ...You are noble. There aren't many people who'd go this far for someone else! Out of
         respect for your courage, I'll let you and the stowaway go free.

Katrine : I'm so grateful! I don't know how to thank you!

Farah : I'm glad I could be of help!

Reid : Man, it's hot!

Keele : Chambard is famous for its extreme heat, but I never thought it'd be this bad.

Farah : It seems silly to even be wearing clothes... Don't you think, Meredy? Meredy, are you
        all right?!

Meredy : ...Meredy...all right.

Farah : Is the climate in Celestia different from Inferia?

Meredy : It is a dark, cool world. Very cool.

Reid : I'm starting to wish I were there now.

Meredy : Celestia is nice place. You should visit.

Farah : Meredy! Don't faint on us!

Meredy : You bet...

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now go up to the next screen. The house at the bottom is Bikini. You will see Katrine again
here.

Farah : Isn't that Katrine, from Mintche University?

Katrine : It's been such a long time!

Reid : Hey, there. Did you make it to Inferia City?

Katrine : No, I just now learned how to get there.

Shop Attendant : Our exclusive dress and a Rasheans dye Hawaiian shirt. That'll be 30,000
                 Gald, please.

Reid : Do you have time to be shopping right now?

Katrine : The storekeeper suggested that I would need really nice clothes if I'm going to
          Inferia City.

Farah : They're way too expensive, and you don't need them anyway! No thank you.

Store Attendant : Right now, you can pay in twelve easy installments...

Farah : No thanks!

Store Attendant : I'll knock 50 Gald off the price.

Farah : No thank you!!

Store Attendant : A...all right.

Katrine : Thanks so much. I was about to lose my travel money to go to Inferia City. Uh-oh, I
          better hurry!

The house at upper right screen is Hot Shot. The house at the upper middle screen is Chambard
Bistro. It is the place where you can compete with your cooking skill. The bottle at left

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Reid : Whew! It's hot here! There's no way we can stand this heat. It's too intense!

Farah : You always give up way too easily! We'll find a way!

Reid : How?

Farah : Well, um...

Keele : (Talking in Melnics language.) Undine!!

Undine : So, you have arrived at Efreet Gorge...

Keele : Yes. We're here to find the Greater Fire Craymel. Can you help us get through?

Undine : You cannot touch the fire?

Reid : We'd get burned.

Farah : Undine, aren't you hot?

Undine will cool down this place.

Undine : Craymels can cross freely between the physical and spiritual worlds. We do not feel
         heat.

Reid : Huh... How convenient.

Meredy : How lucky!

Keele : Undine, I thank you for helping us.

Meredy : Thank you!

Undine : I will use my power to protect you from the heat as long as I can. But be careful. I
         can only suppress the heat. It may still be quite hot.

Farah : Summoning Undine was a great idea, Keele!

Keele : Let's hurry. We don't know how long Undine's effects will last.

Go north to the next screen and get Venom from the chest above. Go to the upper right screen
to the next screen. Get Sage from the chest a bit to the right then go north to the next
screen. Get Flare Cape from the chest above and Lemon Gel from the chest to the left. Now go a
little bit north and follow the way left through the burning fire to the next screen. You will
be in some place and there is no lava river in there.

Farah : Keele! Are you all right?

Keele : I...I'm fine.

Reid : Let's take a break.

Keele : Really! I'm fine!

Reid : I don't want to wind up carrying you.

Farah : I'm tired, too. We've been walking for ages. Let's rest!

Reid : Keele, are you weaker than you were back when we were kids?

Farah : Reid, I told you to quit it! Keele has been busy with his studies, you know. It's
        natural for him to get tired with all this sudden exertion. Keele...are you really
        okay?

Keele : ...Heh. Boy, I'm pathetic. I've got Farah worrying about me again, like I'm still a
        snot-nosed kid.

Farah : That's not true, Keele! I know you're not a kid anymore.

Meredy : You bet! Keele knows very many things! You are very, very wise but not perfect. I can
         help. We are friends. Pals!

Farah : Right! Just like Meredy says! We all help each other. Nobody is good at everything.

Keele : You've always been so nice, Farah. Always trying to help out strangers. You weren't
        just a mean boss.

Farah : Really...? I don't know... Hey, wait a minute Keele! Who was a mean boss?!

Keele : I...sorry, sorry!

Reid : As mighty as ever...

Now go north and you will see three doors but you can't open them so go north to the next
screen. Here get Lavender, Life Bottle, Square Shield and Cross Helm from the chests and go
north to the next screen. Undine will show up again.

Undine : Even my powers are not enough to protect you from those flames. Pass through quickly
         when the flames go out. Please be careful...

Get Bracelet and Blue Ribbon from the chests and go north. You will fight Efreet here.

Reid : Oww! Sooo hot!

Farah : This heat is terrible!

Keele : Shh! The Greater Craymel should be around here somewhere...

You will see a blazing fire and a creature is inside the fire.

Meredy : Eek!

Reid : Gasp!

Keele : Aaahhh!

Farah : Help!

Efreet : Reckless, foolish humans! Remember your place!

Strategy : Be careful with the fire below Efreet, it can damage you. Efreet will try to make
           you cornered, so be careful. Have Meredy/Keele use Spread because the weakness of
           Efreet is Water. Have Reid use Demon Lightning Hammer.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Farah : Meredy! Be careful!

Efreet : Rahrr!! Come!!

Meredy : Baiba!!

Undine will show up.

Undine : Efreet, stop! How disgraceful...

Efreet : Undine... Have you become a slave to these humans?!

Undine : I entered the Craymel Cage of my own free will. Surely you must know the
         situation...?

efreet : I'm the Greater Fire Craymel! I can't simply leave and abandon my duties here!

Undine : It is precisely because you are a Greater Craymel that we need you. Raise the Craymel
         Cage!!

Choose Keele's or Meredy's Craymel Cage. It's up to you to chose whom.

Meredy/Keele : Ready!

Undine will force Efreet inside the Craymel Cage.

Efreet : Aaarghhh!!

Reid : Hey, wait a minute... Is it really okay to just force him in?!

Keele : Undine! Are you all right?

You will see a light come out from the Craymel Cage.

Reid : Wh...what? What's happening?

Farah : We're not getting punished, are we?

Meredy : Eek!!

The light will transform into an angel.

Keele : You...you are... The Greater Light Craymel...Rem?!

Rem : That is correct.

Meredy : The greatest Greater Craymel?!

Keele : That's right. Rem is a Governing Craymel that unifies the three Primary Craymels under
        her.

Farah : Rem, we have a favor to ask you! We would like you to stop the Grand Fall!

Rem : That, I cannot do.

Keele : NO...

Rem : You, the humans alone, have caused this problem. It is a problem that must be solved by
      humans.

Keele : Are you saying the Grand Fall is caused by humans?

Rem : Here. Take this.

You will received Sorcerer's Ring. With this, you can use R1 to fire a laser beam.

Rem : It's a Sorcerer's Ring! Use the ring to cross the Bridge of Light.

Farah : The Bridge of Light?!

Keele : Rem, wait!! We have many more questions to ask!

Rem will disappear leaving Undine, Efreet and Sylph behind.

Sylph : Ha ha! What's the matter?!

Keele : Where did Rem go?

Efreet : Who knows?

Efreet will enter the Craymel Cage.

Farah : Is Rem in the Craymel Cage?

Sylph : Of course not! Don't you know? Rem is a Governing Craymel.

Sylph will enter the Craymel Cage.

Keele : Undine!

Undine : Rem is no longer here. You must trust in what she said and continue your duties.

Reid : Continue our duties? But...

Undine : Take very good care of the Sorcerer's Ring.

Undine will enter the Craymel Cage.

Now go down the stairs and Meredy will explain about Fringe.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Water + Wind -> Heal
Fire lv 5 + Water lv 7 -> Sharpness
Wind lv 6 + Fire lv 5 -> Concentrate
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now go to the place where you saw three doors. Use R1 in front of the door and the door will
be opened. Inside use R1 again to the switch and the monsters will be appeared. After you
defeat the monster, a chest will be appeared. Get Rune Bottle from the door above. Get Fire
Shard from the middle door. Get a Lens from the bottom door. Now go down to the camp point and
you will ahev some conversation.

Meredy : Keele...?

Keele : Meredy! Did you know? The Grand Fall is the work of humans! You knew it, didn't you?

Meredy : ...It was Balir.

Keele : Balir? Who exactly is that?

Meredy : Celestia's (Talking in Melnics language.)

Meredy : He is like a King. It is Balir who is behind the Grand Fall.

Farah : So the Celestians do want to destroy Eternia?

Keele : The Celestians... It was the Celestians after all... They were the masterminds behind
        the Grand Fall!

Meredy : Not true! Balir did it all alone! Inferians and Celestians both in danger!!

Keele : Oh yeah? So then why have you kept silent up til now?

Quickie : Kuweekeee...

Meredy : ...I could not explain well. Was afraid... I am sorry! Please! Trust me?

Reid : Say... Do all Celestians have dark skin and glass beads on their heads like you?

Meredy : You bet... All have Elara.

Reid : Even Balir?

Meredy : ...No. Balir has none. His forehead is light. Like yours.

Reid : Say...do you remember the name of the man who crossed over to Celestia?

Farah : Umm...wasn't it...

Keele : Balir...?

Reid : Do you think that's just a coincidence?

Keele : It can't be!! The mastermind behind the Grand Fall is... Balir...? An Inferian?!

Reid : I don't know... ...but I think it's too early to assume that the Celestians are the bad
       guys.

Farah : Meredy... ...I believe in you. I trust you all the way.

Meredy : Thank you!

Reid : Well then, why don't we begin our search for the Bridge of Light?

Meredy : Reid...

Reid : No, all I meant was that we'll stick by you until we find the Bridge of Light. I didn't
       mean anything serious...

keele : ...Mt. Farlos. The Bridge of Light is on Mt. Farlos.

Reid : how do you know, Keele?!

Keele : I heard it...at the Royal Observatory.

Reid : Good job!

Meredy : Keele... Thank you.

Keele : Let's just get going.

Keele : I dislike intuition and inferences. I need to confirm the cause of the Grand Fall with
        my own eyes.

Farah : Okay! Let's head for Mt. Farlos. No problem!!

Meredy : I...I like you all...so much.

Meredy : (Talking in Melnics language.)

Quickie : Kuweekeee, kuweekeee!!

Now get back to the world map and go to the middle of Inferia Map to Farlos Sanctuary.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Keele : So this is the famous Mt. Farlos sanctuary, the birthplace of Seyfert's Teachings.

Reid : That is one BIG stained-glass window!

Keele : I gather it's a picture of the god of creation, Seyfert, descending from the heavens.

Farah : Wow...it's breathtaking.

Now go enter Farlos Snctuary. The right door will take you to a fortune teller. The door to
the left is a bedroom. Enter the door to the left.

Keele : Let's rest first. Mountain climbing and exhaustion don't exactly mix well.

Choose to rest in here.

Farah : Meredy...

Meredy : Hmm?

Farah : Celestia... What kind of place is it?

Meredy : It is very much darker than Inferia. Winds not blow, but very, very cold. And...many
         many many machines!!

Keele : Machines? Are you telling me the technology is more advanced than Inferia? That's
        impossible!

Meredy : It's true!

Keele : Well...we'll know when we get there. If we ever reach Celestia, we'll know everything.

Reid : You all...are really planning on going to Celestia?

Farah : ...Reid, you're not...going?

Reid : Didn't you listen to Zosimos? That guy Balir...he crossed the Bridge of Light and never
       came back!

Farah : But Meredy came to Inferia, so don't you think we can make it, too?

Reid : But even if we can make it to Celestia... It's a totally unknown world! We don't know
       WHAT might happen!

Keele : That's exactly why I want to go.

Reid : Arrghh! Haven't you guys ever heard of better safe than sorry?

Meredy : Reid, let's go together. We need you.

Reid : GOODNIGHT!

Search the wardrobe for a Lens. Now get out from this room and try to go outside. The priest
will stop you and teach Farah Life spell. Now go outside and take the left exit. Just follow
the way to the next screen and you will reach Mt. Farlos.

Reid : It's tall!

Farah : Even up close like this...

You will see a very tall mountain.

Reid : Keele, are you all right?

Keele : All right what?

Reid : It's pretty steep. Do you think you're tough enough to make it?

Keele : The legendary Bridge of Light is up there! I'm going, and that's all there is to it!

Reid : Well...hang in there.

Farah : Okay, let's go!

Now go north to the next screen. Get Crystal Robe from the chest near the trees. Get Duel Helm
from the chest a little north from the first chest. Go to the lower right screen first to get
Omega Shield from the chest. Now get back to the previous screen and enter the upper right
screen. Go follow the way leading up. Get Flare Bottle from the chest below and go north.
There will be a rockslide and Farah will get separated from the party.

Reid : ...Are we all okay? Hey! Are you all right? Did you hurt anywhere? Can you understand
       me?

Meredy : Meredy was so scared!

Keele : ...Where's Farah?

Reid : Farah!

Meredy : Quickie, do you smell Farah?

Quickie : Kwee...

Meredy : Doesn't look like she'a here...

Reid : Farah! Farah!

Keele : Hey, that's enough! All you're doing is attracting monsters!

Reid : If we don't hurry up and find her, Farah could be attacked by monsters, too!

Keele : Well, then don't just run around like an idiot. Let's figure this out logically, all
        right?

Reid : Yeah...okay.

You will see Farah in a cave and she was thinking about the past when she still a little girl.

Farah : Wait, wait!

Reid and Keele will leave Farah alone.

Farah : Reid? Keele? Where are you? Come back!

??? : Farah...

Farah : That voice... Ras?

??? : Farah... Thank goodness...

Farah : Ras... Is it you, Ras?

You will be back to the other party.

Meredy : Reid?

Keele : What's the matter?

Reid : huh? Oh, I dunno... I'm just getting a bad feeling...

Keele : Don't be stupid! I'm sure she's fine! It's Farah we're talking about here, remember?

Reid : Yeah... I guess you're right. Who knows? She might be waiting for us at the top
       already.

Meredy : Yeah, Meredy bet she is!

Now take the lower road to the next screen with a bridge. Go across the bridge to the next
screen. Get Apple Gel from the pouch here and take the far right road. At the next screen
Keele will notice something.

Keele : *Gasp!*

Reid : Do you see her?!

Keele : Look at this volcanic rock! See how the Craymel Stone element in it is in a swirl
        pattern? This is an extremely rare form! It's the first time I've seen a specimen like
        this in person!

Reid : Hey! We're looking for Farah, remember?! Yo, Keele!

Keele : It's Farah!!

You will see Farah with Ras at the bottom.

Keele/Meredy : Farah!!

Farah : Reid! Keele! Meredy!! You're all okay!!

Reid : Never mind us! What about you?

Farah : Look who saved me!

Keele : Isn't that the guy from Sylph Cavern...?

Reid : Yeah, it's that merchant, Ras.

Meredy : Ras! You're back?

Farah : We ran into each other coincidentally! Ras just happened to be on the mountain!

Keele : Coincidentally, huh...

Reid : How do we get over there?

Ras : It doesn't look like you can with this terrain condition! Let's all head for the top!
      The paths should meet up there!

Reid : How can you be so sure?

Ras : I come up here all the time to dig up ancient treasures!

Farah : Don't worry about me! We'll meet you at the top!

Farah and Ras will go to the north.

Keele : Doesn't that guy seem awfully suspicious?

Reid : Anyway... We'd better head for the top...

Keele : Right.

Now go to the north two screens. Get Emerald Ring from the chest and go up two screens
following the way. Now the screen will change into Farah and Ras. Farah will tripped.

Ras : Watch out!!

Farah : Sorry! I tripped.

Ras : Your leg msut still be hurting... Shall we take a break?

Farah : No, I'm fine. Really. The fate of the world depends on this little adventure. I've got
        to keep going.

Ras : Farah, why are you so determined? You're a talented amrtial artist. And I admire the
      unselfish way you're devoting yourself to helping the world. But... You are just a
      commoner. Even if you're right about the Greater Craymels being able to stop the Grand
      Fall, it's still the Empire's responsibility. You shouldn't get so involved.

Farah : We went to the King first, but nobody believed us. So we decided that we had to do
        something on our own!

Ras : So you don't mind if you end up as an enemy of the Empire and get killed?

Farah : Of course not! This is for the good of everyone! It's the right thing to do! Am
        I...strange?

Ras : Uh... No. it's just that I never met anyone who thinks like you.

Farah : So I am weird then. Is that it?

Ras : Maybe a little. But that's also what makes you fascinating...

Farah : Don't look at me like I'm some kind of rare animal!

Ras : I'm sorry. I'm in no position to psychoanalyze you or anything. Don't take it to heart,
      okay?

Just follow the way to the north two screens. You will be in a foggy place and there are a lot
of rocks falling from above. Avoid the falling rock, it can damage you. Get Warrior Symbol
from the far left chest and after that go all the way up to the next screen. Get Orange Gel
from the chest below and go north to the next screen. Avoid the falling rocks and go all the
way up to the next screen. Get Lemon Gel from the pouch and after that go north. Get Trident
from the chest a little bit to the left. Avoid the falling rock and go all the way up to the
next screen. Get 2600 Gald from the right chest and go up to the next screen. Go up again to
the next screen and you will reach the camp point.

Reid : Whew! We've come a long way!

Meredy : Whew! Meredy is beat!

Reid : Guess we'll rest.

Keele : Okay.

Reid : Keele, why are you quiet?

Keele : Why should I speak without reason?

Reid : I'm just concerned. I thought you might be fatigued.

Keele : I don't need you worrying about me. What about you? You've gotten quiet yourself since
        Farah disappeared.

Meredy : That is true. Reid is much more quiet.

Reid : That's got nothing to do with this!

Keele : That guy Ras, he's a handsome guy...

Reid : I guess so...

Keele : Very graceful gentleman... Almost a regal quality to him... I suppose a hot-tempered
        girl like Farah needs an older, more experienced man of the world.

Reid : Why are you looking at me like that?!

Meredy : Why is Reid so angry now?

Reid : I...I...I'm not angry! It's just that Keele is... He's... Aw! Forget it!

Keele : I was just stating that Farah is 17 years old. It's natural for a girl to...

Reid : AAAAAAGH!! SHUT UP!!

Meredy : ...Reid is angry.

Now go to the north and go all the way up at the next screen. The screen will change into
Farah and Ras again.

Ras : When did you first meet your Celestian friend?

Farah : You mean Meredy?

Ras : Hmm? Yes, her. Did you really run into Meredy purely by chance?

Farah : Yeah, completely by chance. I mean...literally...she just dropped right out of the
        sky! It was wild. Her flying ship blew up, and we couldn't even communicate with her
        at first...

Ras : So you believed her right from the start, even though you couldn't understand what she
      was saying? Why do you believe her?

Farah : I don't know why, exactly... Do I have to have a reason to believe her?

Ras : If you believe everyone indiscriminately, you'll get hurt someday. But ironically, you
      can't live without believing in someone. That's the paradox of believing in others.
      Don't you think?

Farah : What about you, Ras? Do you believe in someone?

Ras : I believe in...my mother.

Farah : Your mother?

Ras : She died when I was little...but...

Farah : What was she like? Will you describe her to me?

Ras : She was a wonderful person... *Cough* ...Excuse me. I'm talking nonsense. We should get
      going.

You will control Reid again. You will be in a cliff with a lot of ropes to climbed.

Keele : There are many ropes here that somebody must have left.

Reid : Too bad we can't reach them.

Quickie : Kweee, kweeekeee!!

Meredy : Quickie! Will you go for us?

Quickie : Kweeekeee!

Meredy : If Meredy says There, check the area. If Meredy says Now, try to climb, okay?

Quickie : Kweeekeee!

Meredy : And jump when Meredy says Go. Okay, Quickie?

Quickie : Kwee kweeekeee!

Reid : Does Quickie really understand? ...I guess we have no choice but to rely on Quickie.

Quickie : Kweeekeee!

Now you must control Quickie to release all the ropes. Here's the commands :
Right! -> Go! -> Now! -> Now! -> There! -> Now! -> Go! -> Now! -> There! -> Go! -> There! ->
There!

Now climb the rope and get to the upper right screen to get you to the next screen. Get a Life
Bottle from the pouch and go north. Go north again in this screen.

Keele : There it is! I see the summit!!

Meredy : Is Farah there?

Reid : She'd better be!

Finally you reach the top of the mountain. You will see Ras and Farah there waiting for you.

Meredy : There she is! Farah!! We found you, Farah!

Farah : I'm sorry for making you worry! We're back together again!

Keele : I'm glad you're okay.

Reid : We thought you were a goner!

Farah : Same goes here! I had Ras with me, so I had nothing to worry about.

Keele : So you're Ras? I'm Keele. I'm a student at Mintche University. We're indebted to you
        for saving Farah.

Ras : No need to thank me.

Keele : Well, we must part with Ras now and continue forward. Shall we move on?

Meredy : Let Ras help us! Ras has amazing Fibrill!

Keele : What lies ahead is our problem. Ras isn't involved in this!

Farah : But Ras is involved now!

Ras : That's okay, Farah. Actually, I saw an interesting spot on the way up here. Let us part
      now. I'm sure we'll meet again someday, just like we did today.

Farah : ...I hope we do. Thank you for everything!

Ras : Well, if you will excuse me, I'll be on my way.

Ras will leave your party.

Meredy : We need the...Fibrill.

Keele : Huh? This door won't open...

Press R1 in front of the door and the door will be opened, go inside to the Stone Sanctum.

Reid : I don't see any bridge around here!

Meredy : Baiba! Meredy's Craymel Cage is glowing!!

Keele : Mine too. It seems to be resonating... Meredy! Come over here!! ...Be careful though.

Meredy : You bet.

Farah : Both of you, be careful!

Keele : There! That's good. Now, on the count of three, we place our hands on the stone
        monument. On the count of three, okay? You got it?

Meredy : Meredy got it! Meredy is not stupid!

Keele : ...Hmph! Well, here we go. One, two...

Meredy : Three!!

You will see a bright light surrounding Keele and Meredy.

Farah : Keele! Meredy!

Reid : What's going on?!

Meredy : Aaah! Meredy melt in the light!

Keele : Don't...worry... If that journal is correct... ...there should be...

You will see three lights come out from the Craymel Cage and Rem will appeared again.

Reid : Rem?!

Rem : You must be prepared to cross over to the other world. There's no returning from the
      Bridge of Lught. Do you understand?

Farah : Of course! We've made up our minds!

Keele : Rem! Please allow us to cross the Bridge of Light!

You will see a bright light in the middle of the room.

Keele : This is it! This is the Bridge of Light!

Reid : It's really...just a light.

Keele : That's right. If we go into the light, the path to Celestia will reveal itself. That's
        what it said in the research journal that Balir left.

Meredy : the Bridge of Light! Yay! Meredy can go back to Celestia!!

Ras will come out from behind the pillar.

Ras : Hold it! I can't allow you to go any further.

Farah : Ras?!

Meredy : What's...wrong?

Keele : What's the meaning of this?

Ras : As an Imperial Knight, I cannot allow Celestia to have such power.

Reid : Imperial Knight?

Ras : My name is Rssius. I am the Senior Knight of the Inferia Empire, Rassius Luine!

Farah : You're...not...serious...

Keele : I thought you seemed suspicious, but I never would have guessed you to be that
        renowned Senior Knight!

Ras : You're just as famous as I am! The traitor, Keele Zeibel!

Reid : A traitor? Keele, just what did you do at the Observatory?

Ras : He burned Balir's research journal on the Bridge of Light. But the information is all
      right there in his head.

Farah : Keele... Is that why you stayed behind at the Observatory?

Reid : So you've been tailing us all along, haven't you, Ras?!

Ras : That may be the way it turned out, but that's not exactly right.

Meredy : Compass Key?

Ras : I was simply being guided by this Seyfert Key, entrusted to me by the King.

Keele : I've read somewhere that since the founding of the Empire, a Compass Key was kept at
        the castle as an Imperial treasure.

Ras : Exactly. This key, which has always remained silent, started to point to a particular
      location a few months ago. Under the King's orders, I've been investigating what the
      Seyfert Key was trying to tell us. And during my investigation, I ran into you again and
      again. Is this merely a coincidence?

Keele : What are you trying to say?

Ras : What you are doing is a threat to the peace of the Empire. The Seyfert Key has been
      trying to warn us of that. That is the obvious conclusion.

Farah : But listen, Ras! The reason we're going to Celestia is to stop the Grand Fall! This is
        also to protect Inferia! You've got to believe us!

Ras : I believe in the word of the King! Not you commoners!

Farah : I'm sorry it has to be like this, Ras... But, if you're not going move out of our way,
        we'll MAKE you move!

Ras : Face me!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ras : Urg...!

Keele : This is not good. His reinforcements are coming this way!

Meredy : Everyone go! Hurry! Hurry!

Keele : Cross the Bridge of Light!

Reid : Are you serious? I...I'm not ready!

Guards : There they are! Get them!

Reid : Oh man! Come on, Farah!

Farah : ...Okay! Let's go!!

You will saw a FMV about the Bridge of Light carrying your party to Celestia.

Meredy : We're finally here!

Keele : This is...Celestia!

Meredy : Hweel! Celestia. Meredy born here, grow up here.

Keele : And that's Inferia above. ...It makes me dizzy.

Meredy : From Celestia, it's Inferia that is upside-down world.

Reid : Wow...

Keele : The colors of the sky and the sea are both different from Inferia. The sun is dark...
        ...and there's no wind. But the greatest difference is...the air! The air feels
        different from that of Inferia!!

Meredy : Just like The Craymel scholar. You are correct!

Keele : ...That's it! The Craymels are different!! Are the Craymels that reside in Inferia and
        Celestia different?!

Meredy : You bet! Correct!!

Keele : ...Meredy! You really ARE a... ...a Celestian!

Meredy : Whaaat?! I've said that so many times! You did not believe?!

Keele : How could I believe it until I... I stood on the very ground.

Reid : Hey... Are we... going to spend the rest of our lives here?

Keele : Reid! I can't believe you! We've come all the way to Celestia and that's all you can
        say?

Farah : Why did we come here? I... Oh, it's nothing... It's just that... we've come so far...

Meredy : Tired bodies must rest. Let's go to the Town of Imen. All will be welcomed. Imen, the
         place where Meredy grew up. A nice place.

Keele : Even if it's your hometown, we are Inferians. ...Will we be okay?

Meredy : Not matter. No worries!

Keele : Well... Staying put isn't going to help us any. Let's go.

Meredy : Hweel! (Talking in Melnics language.)

Reid : Are you okay?

Farah : Huh?! What? I'm okay! This is only the beginning! It's no time to be down.

Save your game, it's the end of Disc 1.

Meredy : This is Imen!

Farah : This is Meredy's hometown.

Meredy : Meredy introduce everyone. Wait here, Meredy go get!!

Keele : So this is where Celestians live...

Meredy : Listen! Meredy introduce them.

Sagura : You're all Inferians?

Keele : We can understand them! The Orz Earring really works well!

Sagura, Bulenda and Hamilt suddenly hold their weapons.

Keele : Waaaaah!

Sagura : I'm Sagura. I make things like this at my weapon workshop. Pretty nice, don't you
         think?

Bulenda : I'm Bulenda. I'm in charge of making explosives.

Hamilt : ...Hamilt. I'm currently in training, so...I mostly deal with customers.

Meredy : They always take good care of Meredy. ...What's wrong?

Keele : Y...you make weapons? This is the first time I've seen anything like this. What kind
        of weapon is it?

Sagura : What kind? It's just a Craymel weapon. You mean to tell me that you don't have them
         in Inferia?

Keele : A weapon that utilizes Craymels? In Inferia, we barely started research on such
        things! I can't believe how advanced Celestian technology is...

Sagura : Technology, you say? Don't know about no techno-mumbo-jumbo, but all I know is that
         I've been crankin' these out for almost 30 years.

Meredy : Anyway! Come to Meredy's house!! We talk there.

Keele : Oh, you have to tell me more about it later.

Sagura : Sure thing! Come visit my weapon shop anytime. It's right in front of the town's
         water tower. Ya can't miss it!

You will be in Meredy's house now.

Reid : There's no one else here? What about your family?

Meredy : Fa...mi...ly? you mean Meredy's birth parents? Celestians live on their own once they
         are ten years old.

Keele : So, Meredy... You lived here all by yourself?

Meredy : Yes... Once Meredy was alone and once Meredy was with another.

Reid : Keele! That's a private matter! It's none of your business!

Keele : Oh, I...umm...true.

Meredy : There are many beds here. They are a bit lumpy, but... Make yourselves at home!

Farah : Thanks Meredy.

Keele : There's still some daylight left. I want to go see the city... Can you show me around?

Meredy : You bet! This is where Meredy grew up. Meredy wants everyone to see.

Farah : Oh, umm... Is it okay if I stay here and rest? I'm sort of tired.

Meredy : You bet! Okay then, Keele, Reid, follow Meredy!

Reid : Hey Farah, have a nice rest, okay?

Farah : I will. Have a good time.

The guy above Meredy's house will sell you foods. Search the jar next to the man to get
Melange Gel. You won't find anything inside the house above Meredy's house. So go down from
Meredy's house to the next screen. Search the basket near the right house for an Orange Gel.
You won't find anything inside the house above. You will get a sequence if you enter the house
below it. It's Alchemy Workshop & Guerudu : Imen.

Kukurle : Hey, Meredy! It's been a while. Where did ya go?

Meredy : All the way to Inferia! Reid and Keele are Inferians.

Kukurle : Reeeaaally?! Inferians? Are you really Inferians? Y...your skins are plae! And you
          have no Elara?

Keele : Elara... You mean that stone on your forehead? Inferians don't have Elara. By the way,
        just what are Elaras for anyway?

Kukurle : As you can see, it emits light. Also, in dark places, we use it for telepathic
          communication. My theory is that resident Craymels react with the changes to the
          organic ions in the body.

Keele : ...That could mean they're crystals with qualities similar to Orz.

Kukurle : Wow! Amaaaazing!! You really know your stuff. Are you a scientist?

Keele : ...Oh, I'm Keele by the way. I studied Light Craymelology at the university.

Kukurle : I'm Kukurle. Pleased to meet you, Keele!

Keele : Yes. Nice to meet you, too.

You can buy items here if you go outside and enter again to talk to the guy near the entrance.
Now go north to the next screen. The house above is weapon workshop where you will find
Sagura, Bulenda and Hamilt.

Bulenda : Welcome! Sagura is waiting for you.

Sagura : Hey hey hey! You came!

Keele : Please explain about the weapons.

Sagura : Sure. Let's start with the Craymel Guns. There are two types, Dark and Lightning.
         Both have unique qualities.

Keele : Even though they look the same?

Sagura : Oh yeah. The exterior shell is the same. The difference is the Dark and Lightning
         Craymel used inside the Craymel Cage.

Keele : I get it! You're utilizing the Craymel Cages as parts.

Bulenda : And they're tailored to the customer's physique. We also have many types of guns.
          This is a lightweight model, good for a child up to about 12.

Reid : Even children carry such dangerous weapons?

Hamilt : It's a dangerous world. They've got to protect themselves.

Reid : Who would carry something as big as this one?

Hamilt : ...That's fuel used for the Craymel Express. It's not a weapon.

Reid : The Craymel Express?

Hamilt : It's a means of transportation used in Celestia. It used to go everywhere, but now
         it's only used for travelling across Dragon Rock Mountain.

Keele : A train powered by a Craymel Cage... ...It must be big.

Hamilt : Oh yeah. It's quite big.

Talk to Hamilt to buy weapons and armors. Now go back to Meredy's house.

Meredy : Let us call it a day!

Keele : Hey, Meredy. Is there anything else to see?

Meredy : Nope. Nothing. ...Oh, actually, there is old library outside town...but it is not
         very interesting.

Keele : LIBRARY?! There's nothing more fascinating to me than a library! Please! Take me
        there!

Meredy : Ah...um...okay... What do you want to do, Reid?

Reid : Sorry, but I'm tired. I'm gonna call it a day, okay?

Meredy : Sure. Good night!

Reid will enter Meredy's house.

Reid : Whoa...totally dark! Let's see here... Where's the light?

Reid will turn on the light.

Reid : Farah? What's wrong? Why are you in the dark...?

Farah : Oh...nom reason. I was just... I was just thinking.

Reid : So much has happened... Meredy falling from the sky, meeting the Greater Craymels,
       climbimg Mt. Farlos... We beat the royal soldiers... And made it all the way to
       Celestia...

Farah : I feel so...so completely lost. Why... Why am I trying to help Meredy?

Reid : That's your nature... You're the kind of person that just can't sit and watch people in
       trouble...right?

farah : I don't know. I've always used that as an excuse. Not thinking... Just acting on
        instinct. But maybe it's just like Ras said. Maybe I'm just running away...

reid : From what?

Farah : I don't know! I don't even know myself. I don't...trust myself.

Reid : Ras couldn't get himself to take the final swing. I was defenseless. He had plenty of
       chances to counter my attack, but...he never did. I think he was doubting himself. Even
       with all of his intellect and power, he still doubted himself. There isn't a person
       alive who knows everything about himself. You can't always know what's right or wrong.

Farah : ...Yeah. I guess so.

Reid : Besides... It's unlike you to think so hard. You might break something in there.

Farah : What did you say? You're gonna get it!

Reid : I'm going to sleep. G'night!

Farah : Good night...Reid.

Now go outside of the bedroom. Search the table for a Lens. Now enter the door above the
stairs.

Farah : Hey! I'm awake. Come on in. Good morning!

Reid : Did you sleep well?

Farah : Yeah, with a good night's sleep, I feel so much better!

Reid : That's good to hear... Oh yeah, Keele hasn't come back yet.

Farah : What?! Then Meredy didn't just wake up early either...

Reid : She hasn't come back since last night...?

Farah : I'm going to go look for them!

Reid : Why? Just leave them alone. They'll eventually come back.

Farah : No, we have to go look!

Search the jar beside the right bed to get a Striped Ribbon. Now go outside of the bedroom,
search the robot in the living room to get a recipe from Wonder Chef. This time he will teach
you how to make Sweet Rice. Farah will wait for you outside.

Farah : You'll go with me, right?

Now go to the area where you can find a pump. Go directly left from the pump to the library.

Meredy : (Talking in Melnics language.) ...Yaaawn.

Keele : Wah...ergh...hm, I see! This word means change!

Farah : Keele! Heeey Keele!

Keele : ...Yeah? What is it?

Farah : What is it?? Haven't you forced Meredy to stay up with you long enough?

Keele : I had many questions concerning Celestian culture. We had a fascinating talk, didn't
        we?

Meredy : You bet. Yaaawn.

Reid : It's already morning.

Keele : Morning? Already? Well, good. I'm just about finished here.

Meredy : Morning? That was fast. Yawwwn...

Meredy fell asleep.

Reid : H...hey, Meredy?

Keele : HEY?! What's wrong?! Meredy!!

You will be in front of Meredy's house.

Keele : How is Meredy?

Farah : Don't worry. She's fast asleep. I'm sure she's exhausted.

Keele : Well, that's good... She makes me worry so much! She's such a trouble maker.

Farah : Meredy stayed up all night for you, Keele.

Keele : W...well, I'm very grateful for that...

Reid : She must have been really happy that you showed an interest in Celestia and all...
       Especially because of all that's happened until now.

Keele : I finally understand what Professor Mazet meant by what he said.

Reid : What did he say?

Keele : Pursue the unknowable. Books and the university can't possibly teach you everything
        there is to know, so use your own eyes to see the world...

Reid : Hmmm...

Farah : Oh... Well, let's get ready so we can leave as soon as Meredy wakes up.

Reid : Let's eat, too.

Now go back to the library. Search the white book at the upper left for Wonder Chef. This time
he will teach you how to make Fruit Cocktail. Now get inside Meredy's house and you will see
Meredy has already awake.

Reid : Meredy! What are you doing?

Meredy : (Talking in Melnics language.)

Keele : What's that?

Meredy : Elara Phone. Can talk to people far away.

Farah : Is that Celestian technology, too?

Meredy : Yes. Galenos invented it. The Elara Phone is only at Luishka and here now.

Keele : Galenos? Luishka? I don't understand. Explain to me.

Meredy : I...umm... You will understand when we go.

Reid : Right now?

Meredy : Yes! He is in a village called Luishka. We will go and see Galenos. Galenos is
         studying how to defeat Balir. He is friend. He helped send Meredy to Inferia.

Keele : A researcher who knows how to use the Craymel Craft...

Meredy : Luishka... We must go east and climb over Dragon Rock Mountain.

Farah : Okay! It's decided then! Let's go!

Before you exit the town, Hamilt will call Meredy.

Hamilt : Meredy!

Meredy : Hmm? Something wrong?

Hamilt : Are you going somewhere with them again?

Meredy : You bet. Meredy leaving again for a while.

Hamilt : I see... T...try to hurry back, okay? I'm going to finish training as quickly as
         possible, and I'll...

Meredy : Yeees?

Hamilt : ...I'm gonna make you a custom-made weapon that'll fit you perfectly.

Meredy : Wow!! Thanks Hamilt! Meredy cannot wait!

Hamilt : Well, so long for now!

Now go east to Imen Station.

Mini Game : Craymel Express
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Farah : ...Seems like a lonely station.

Meredy : Imen Station. It used to be beautiful. But nobody goes to Luishka now because of the
         earthquakes...

Keele : So this is a train!

Meredy : You bet! We can ride this to Luishka!

Train Staff : To go whereever you want... That's some wishful thinkin'... The real world ain't
              like that.

Keele : Are you telling us we can't ride on this train?

Train Staff : A train don't move on its own. If ya want to ride, bring some fuel.

Farah : Fuel, huh...? Maybe we can find some in Imen.

Now go back to City of Craymel, Imen.

Keele : Meredy?

Meredy : Huh?

Keele : Meredy, this Galenos guy... what is he like?

Meredy : ...Like?

Keele : He has the knowledge and the skills to make a Craymel Craft, right? Is he a famous
        researcher in Celestia?

Meredy : Fay...mous? I do not know... But he knows much of the Craymels. He invented the
         Craymel Express.

Keele : Hmmm... How did you come to know such a famous researcher anyway?

Meredy : Galenos is Meredy's teacher.

Keele : You're a researcher? I don't believe it...

Meredy : No, just apprentice. Galenos do very difficult research. Meredy help him.

Keele : Oh, I get it. You're not really an apprentice. You're more like a helping hand. So
        Galenos asked you to go to Inferia?

Meredy : (Talking in Melnics language.) Galenos is doing very difficlut research. But Meredy
         cannot help with that...

Keele : Division of labor, huh?

Reid : Doesn't Galenos have any other apprentices?

Meredy : ...Now, only Meredy. Meredy owes very much to Galenos.

Meredy has earned the title of Craymel Engineer. Now go to Bupumu : Imen and search the train
cage and talk to Sagura. You can buy it for 2000 Gald. Now go back to Imen Station and talk to
the train staff. After that, get inside the train.

Meredy : Sagura's Craymel Cage goes here.

Keele : Are you inserting the Craymel Cage? Let me! How fast can the Craymel Express go?
        Whoa!!

The machine is start working.

Reid : It looks like...it's working.

Keele : I...I don't feel so good.

Farah : Why don't you rest in the passenger car, Keele?

Keele : I...I think I'll do that.

In the passenger car.

Farah : Are you all right, Keele?

Back at the machine car.

Train Staff : Say, since you're taking the Craymel Express, can I ask you to deliver some mail
              for me?

Reid : Deliver mail with the Craymel Express?

Train Staff : Why not?

Meredy : You bet! Meredy will deliver! Leave it to Meredy!

Train Staff : Glad to hear it. There's someone waiting for mail at each station. Be sure to
              stop and hand each of them a letter. Thanks for your help.

Reid : So... How do we get this thing to go?

Meredy : Don't think too hard. Let's just go!

The train will start moving and the mini game will start.

Farah : Reid is pretty rough on the controls!

Reid : ...Hey, where's Keele?

Farah : Huh?

Reid : Hey, Keele! What's wrong?! Are you...sick?

Keele : Of...of course not!! I was feeling so good, I slept through the entire ride!

You have reach . Go down to the next screen.

Meredy : Luishka is east from here.

Keele : All right, let's go.

Keele will fall down again.

Farah : Keele! Are you all right?

Keele : Ha ha... Looks like I'm still feeling a bit sleepy.

Meredy : Do all Inferians turn green from sleepiness?

Ruined Village, Luishka
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Recipe : 2 (Bitter Tofu and Hot Borsch)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Reid : What...happened here?

Keele : The building foundations are blown away. There must have been an explosion of
        unimaginable force...

Meredy : This is the...Aurora Arte.

Keele : Aurora Arte...? What is that? Are you still keeping something from us?!

Meredy : No! The Aurora Arte... The Aurora Arte is... Sorry. Meredy cannot explain well.
         Please meet Galenos. You will understand everything...

Keele : Whre is he, this Craymel Mage...?

Meredy : The biggest mansion in town. He is busy doing research.

Reid : All right, let's go.

Now go up two screens and cross the bridge to enter the mansion.

Reid : Does he really live...here?

Meredy : You bet. Heeey!! Maybe in basement lab.

Now go to the right two screens to see Galenos.

Meredy : Galenos!!

Galenos : (Talking in Melnics language.)

Meredy : (Talking in Melnics language.)

Reid : Wh...wh...what is it? What did you say?

Meredy : (Talking in Melnics language.) I am sorry. Meredy is sick home... Oh! No! No!
         Homesick!

Galenos : I am Galenos. I have heard most of what has occurred. It seems that you have
          gathered the Greater Craymels of Inferia... I humbly thank you.

Galenos will look closely to Reid.

Reid : Wh...wh...what is it?

Galenos : Hmmm...ha!

Meredy will get closer to Reid and you will see the shiny light again.

Reid : Ow!!! That hurts!

Galenos : You must be Reid? Hmmm...yes, it is true.

Meredy : (Talking in Melnics language.)

Keele : Please enlighten us. We want to know the truth. Who is this Balir? What is the Grand
        Fall? What is the power of the Aurora Arte?

Galenos : I will explain as much as I can.

Keele : I still can't believe that the Grand Fall is the work of a human. The Kaloric flow due
        to Craymel expansion far exceeds the logical limit of the Human Focular Effect!
        According to the Orenash equation, it's impossible to stop the Orbus wave before
        cellular collapse occurs!

Galenos : I too thought that when I was young, but reality is not always what we expect.

Reid : You understood what Keele said?

Farah : Wow!

Meredy : Galenos knows much.

Galenos : The Grand Fall was started by the ruler of Celestia, Balir. That is a fact.

Farah : But how?

Galenos : By using the Aurora Arte, the Fibrill of the gods.

Keele : What is a Fibrill?

Galenos : Fibrill is...Fibrill. A broad definition of the word would be power. There is no
          equivalent word in Inferia.

Reid : The gods...?

Galenos : Do Inferians know of Nereid?

Keele : The God of Destruction, Nereid? He was the one who led the destruction of the Melnics
        civilization.

Galenos : God of Destruction... That is not far from the truth. The Aurora Arte is free
          Fibrill that can both destroy and create.

Reid : So Balir has this power of Nereid? If that's true, we can't win.

Galenos : I too have tried at great length to explain the Aurora Arte, but I have had little
          success... What I do not know is that Craymel Artes of Celestia are no match against
          its power.

Farah : So that's why you sent Meredy to Inferia?

Galenos : Sending Meredy to Inferia was our only hope for a breakthrough.

Keele : Unfortunately, we have nothing to offer.

Galenos : No. The results are good. She has brought back Inferian Craymels as well as a person
          with unknown Fibrill.

Farah : Unknown Fibrill...?

Reid : What? ME?

Meredy will get closer to Reid and you will see the shiny light again.

Reid : Whoa! Ow ow ow!

Keele : What does this light mean? What kind of power is it?

Galenos : I do not know. What I can say is that the light is very similar to the glow of the
          aurora. Reid, will you let me run some tests on you? I may see a prospect for hope.

Farah : Why are you hesitating? Only you can do this, Reid.

Reid : ...No painful experiments, okay?

Galenos : Well then... I'll head down to the basement laboratory. Come when you are ready.

Now go upstairs and enter the bedroom. Search the green thing near the bed. It's Wonder Chef.
This time he will teach you how to make Bitter Tofu. Now go downstairs and go to the place
where you first saw Galenos.

Galenos : Ahhh, Reid. You've come.

Reid : You are only going to examine me, right?

Galenos : Of course. Please, remove your clothes and lie down on the bed.

Farah : Well...umm...we'll be going back to the room now.

Reid : Sure.

Meredy : Galenos, please take care of Reid.

Galenos : Of course.

Farah and Meredy will be in bedroom.

Farah : What's wrong, Meredy?

Meredy : Huh? This room... It's...nostalgic.

Farah : Have you... been in this room before?

Meredy : N...no. Ha ha. I'm very silly.

Farah : Hee hee. Well, I don't want to be rude to Reid, but why don't we go to bed now.

Meredy : You bet!

Farah : Hey, Meredy. Can I ask you something?

Meredy : Hmm?

Farah : Your parents... Your mother and father, where are they?

Meredy : I don't have a mother or a father.

Farah : Oh... I see...

Meredy : You bet...

Farah : My mother nad father died a long time ago, too.

Meredy : Huh?

Farah : But I still remember. The smell of my mother's soap... The feel of my father's beard
        when he kissed me.

Meredy : Ye...yeah...?

Farah : Meredy, what kind of memories do you have?

Meredy : Memories...? Hmm... M...memories...

Meredy will thinking something of her past.

Meredy : None!

Farah : You don't have any memories of your parents?

Meredy : It is not none, ...but sad...

Farah : I get it... It hurts to remember. ...Sorry.

Meredy : It's okay. I am fine! I have Galenos, Reid, Keele, and Farah!

Farah : Hee hee, thanks. You're very tough, Meredy.

You will see the past of Meredy.

Meredy's Mother : (Talking in Melnics language.) <<Aren't you cold?>>

Little Meredy : (Talking in Melnics language.) <<...A little.>>

Now you will be back in Galenos laboratory.

Reid : ...Huh? Where am I?

Galenos :m Ah, you've awoken. Thank you for cooperating.

Reid : Oh...that's right. The examination... ...So what did you learn?

Galenos : Hmm...I apologize. As I thought, the truth lies in the Orbus. I simply cannot draw a
          conclusion from one night of study. But...it is certain that within your body sleeps
          incredibly powerful Fibrill.

Reid : Yeah?

Galenos : The Fibrill is still latent. Some condition must be met before it will awaken.

Reid : What kind of condition?

Keele : That's exactly what Galenos is investigating now! Why not think before asking a
        question?

Galenos : I've taken samples of your blood. This should help with our research.

Now you will be in the main hall.

Galenos : So you will help us to face down Balir?

Farah : Of course!! We can't abandon this world!

Keele : Galenos, I have great respect for your vast knowledge. Please tell us if you learn
        more about the Aurora Artes. I, too, will travel the world and gather information.

Meredy : Keele is serious now! ...Meredy glad!

Keele : I...I just have a purely scientific interest...

Farah : Reid, what will you do?

Reid : Do I have achoice? ...You need my body. Right?

Galenos : Good... Now... In regards to Balir Castle... I do not know of its whereabouts, so
          you must first gather information.

Keele : Information? Where? From whom?

Galenos : I know not...but there must be others who wish to defeat Balir. Make contact with
          them. They may know where Balir Castle can be found.

Farah : And we might make new allies.

Galenos : Hmmm. Yes... May I suggest you begin your search from the Port City, Peruti to the
          far west from here? It's fastest if you take the Craymel Express. Take the one bound
          for the Abandoned Mine Station.

Keele : ...I understand. We'll do as you say.

Meredy : Bye Galenos!

Galenos : Be very careful...

Now go outside the mansion and go left to the next screen.  Look at the ruin of the house, you
can see a wooden box there. Search it and you can see Wonder Chef again. This time he will
teach you how to make Hot Borsch. Now go west to Luishka Station.

Keele : Are we riding the Craymel Express... Again?

Reid : We have no other options.

Meredy : We still have plenty of fuel. We will be okay.

Now talk to the train staff and choose to go to Abandoned Mine Station.

Keele : Ah!! WAIT!

Reid : W...what?!

Keele : Do you remember how to control it?

Reid : ...I think so.

Keele : B...be more careful this time!

Meredy : Keele such a grump.

Farah : Your legs must be asleep. Why don't you try moving your legs around a bit?

Keele : Okay...

Farah : I don't understand... We're so deep underground, yet it's light in here.

Keele : ...The rocks here appear to be suffused with Earth Craymels.

Meredy : Meredy remembers Kukurle said... Where there are Earth Craymels, there is light.

Farah : Really?! Then we just might meet the Greater Earth Craymel!

        cave goes on much deeper...

Reid : Keele, you're tired, aren't you?

Keele : Ridiculous! What do you think, Farah?

Farah : ...Yeah. why don't we rest?

Meredy : Yes, rest!

Keele : The Greater Earth Craymel!

Reid : He's big. He should go on a diet.

Meredy : Shhh! Who will speak?

Keele : Since this is Celestia, Meredy, you speak to him.

Meredy : You bet! Ah, um... ...Please listen to Meredy. Umm... We know the world is in
         danger... Do you know, too?

Gnome : Yawn. Huh? I can't understand what you're saying.

Meredy : Um...well...you see... Meredy want you to go inside the Craymel Cage.

After you defeat him, Efreet and Sylph will come out from the Craymel Cage.

Sylph : Hey! Gnome!! Don't act so tough!

Efreet : Indeed! Stop your chatter and enter! You understand the situation.

Gnome : Ahhh! You!

Efreet : It has been 2000 years!

Gnome : The Craymels of Inferia are helping, too?

Sylph : Undine's here, too!

Gnome : Yaaawwwn. I see. Everyone's together. Then, what's wrong with just staying here alone?
        You don't need me. After all, the humans started it.

Sylph : Oh, c'mon!

Undine will come out too.

Undine : It's been a long time, Gnome.

Gnome : Aaah, Undine? Heeello. Long time no seee.

Undine : This time, the crisis is indeed the work of humans. But you are aware that harm will
         befall even the Craymels, are you not?

Gnome : Well...

Undine : This is a grave matter. Unless we Craymels act in unison, we cannot resolve the
         crisis at hand.

Gnome : Reaaallly?

Undine : Gnome...can you not spare some of your time for the humans?

Gnome : Do I have a choice? I'll do as you say... ...for now. But being with Sylph could be a
        handful.

Sylph : What?! That's my line!

Choose Meredy's or Keele's Craymel Cage. All the Craymels will enter the Craymel Cage.

Farah : ...That was very entertaining.

Reid : I guess even Craymels have their own set of problems.

Keele : Well, I'm just glad everything worked out. We should be grateful to the Inferian
        Craymels.

Meredy : Meredy worked hard, too.

Keele : Y...yeah, that's right.

Now go back to the previous room before Gnome's village. Gnome will come out from the Craymel
Cage.

Gnome : Yawwwn... Going baaack?

Farah : We're in a hurry. We need to return to the surface now.

Gnome : Yawwwn... Then leave it to meee.

Gnome will summon his friends. You will see a lot of gnomes.

Farah : Aaah!

Meredy : Baiba!

Reid : What the...?!

Keele : Gnome! What is this?

Gnome : Go through that hole! It leads to the outside.

So go to the hole and you will be taken outside.

Reid : ...Where are we?

Farah : Hey! There's a house over there.

Reid : ...And maybe, that means there's food! I'm sooo hungry!

Keele : We're surrounded by the sea... How do we get across?

Meredy : Let's check out the hut! Maybe someone can tell us how to get across. Let's ask how
         to get to Port Peruti.

Reid : So it's decided! We'll go and check it out. Let's get some FOOD!!

Now go west to the Hut.

Now go outside the room and go upstairs. You will know you are in Basement Level 8.

Reid : What is this?

Farah : It looks like a water way. There's a switch at the very end.

Meredy : Quickie, can you reach the switch?

Quickie : Kweee, kweeekeee...

Quickie could not enter the hole because the hole is too small.

Quickie : Kwww...

Meredy : Quickie cannot do it...

Keele : I wonder what the switch is for? It could be a trap... Anyway, let's continue to look
        around.

You could not open the door upstairs but you can enter the door to the left and right. For now
go to the door to the right and enter the furthest door. You will get Pine Gel from the chest.
Search the yellow toy duck in the middle.

Reid : ...What's this?

Meredy : Toy duck! When Meredy was little, Meredy play with toy duck all the time. It floats
         on water and is fun to play with!

Keele : All it does is float on water? Doesn't sound like much fun.

Farah : Anyway, let's take it along. It could come in handy.

You will take the toy duck. Now go outside the room and take the door leading to above room.

You will take toy duck spring. Now go back the place where the hole can be found. Now search
the hole.

Reid : Isn't there some way to push the switch at the end?

Keele : Hey...

Meredy : Hey hey! Maybe use the spring and toy duck to push switch?

Keele : That's what I was going to say!

Reid : I get it. Let's give it a try.

Reid will use the spring and toy duck. You will see the toy duck moving inside the hole.

Reid : Did anything happen?

Farah : I heard a noise from the top of the stairs.

Keele : Let's go have a look!

Exit the room and enter the door to the left. The door to your right is a fake. If you search

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now enter the door above you and go upstairs. You will be in the Hut again.

Reid : All right.

Meredy : The exit?!

You will see someone coming from inside.

??? : Well done. You all passed the test. You must be strong and wise, as well as a little bit
      lucky to have made it past all of Aifread's traps safely.

Reid : Who are you, boy? Is this annoying house yours?

Chat : My name is Chat. I'm a descendant of the great and honorable pirate, Aifread.
       Besides...considering my sex, boy is hardly the appropriate expression.

Meredy : A descendant of Aifread?

Reid : Huh...you're a girl?!

Chat : Hmph... I will forgive your rude manners this once and allow you to join me as deck
       hands.

Keele : You expect us to play pirates and dig for treasure in your backyard? Come on. This is
        a waste of time.

Chat : Only if it were in my backyard... Unfortunately, the Legacy of Aifread is scattered
       throughout the world. That's why I need a crew for my ship!

Keele : A ship! You've got a ship?! Show us!!!

Chat : I'm afraid I can only show it to you if you agree to become my deck hands.

Keele : Hey, what do we do? Do we listen to the kid?

Farah : Do we have a choice? With a ship, we can cross the sea! We can even go to Peruti.

Meredy : The Legacy of Aifread! It is one of the Seven Treasures of Celestia!!

Keele : But... We've got no spare time for treasure hunting...

Reid : It's okay. Once we have the ship, we'll be able to seize the initiative.

Keele : You're pretty wicked...

Chat : Well? Will you be my deck hands?

Keele : Uh, well... Give us a minute to think.

Chat : No problem. It would be painful for anybody to swallow their pride and work for someone
       younger... I'll be waiting in the reception room. Give it a thought, and then let me
       know what you've decided.

Now enter the room behind and talk to Chat.

Chat : That was surpisingly fast. Now, let me ask you. Will you become my deck hands?

Choose Yes.

Keele : Sure. We'll be your subordinates, so hurry up and show us the ship!

Chat : Correction please. Not subordinates, but deck hands. And you will address me as
       Captain!

Reid : Yeah, yeah, whatever you say.

Chat : The correct response is aye-aye, Captain!

Reid : A...aye aye, Captain? That's a bit old-fashioned, don't you think?

Chat : I would prefer that you call it traditional.

Reid : Grrr...

Chat : Now then. Since you seem to have all caught your breath, let us go to the ship.

Reid : Yeah.

Farah : Aye-aye, Captain!

Keele : Aye-aye, Captain!

Meredy : Aye-aye, Captain!

Reid : I...I mean, aye-aye, Captain!

Chat will turn the picture and the room is going down.

Keele : I see... The whole house is rigged.

Chat : I made it myself.

Meredy : Amazing!

Chat will remove the blue big glass and put it to the other side and a stairs will revealed.

Chat : I made it myself.

Farah : Wow! C...captain! impreeessive!

Chat : It's no big deal. Now, this way, please.

Now your party will go downstairs to Aifread's Transformation Dock.

Reid : Wow, I can't see anything!

Meredy : It's cooold!

Chat : Please calm down!

Chat will turn on the light.

Farah : How beautiful!

Chat : This is the Van Eltia.

Meredy : Van Eltia...is Celestian word for wealth.

Chat : It's been told my great-grandfather Aifread used this ship to wreak havoc all over the
       world. I never got to meet my great-grandfather, but his ship, the Van Eltia, has
       always been with me. That's why the Van Eltia is like a great-grandfather to me...
       ...and proof of my heritage! I wish you would listen to what the Captain has to say.

Reid : Can you show us the inside of the ship now?

Chat : Did you really understand what I just told you?

Reid : I know! I know! Your great-grandfather ruthlessly stole treasures all around the world,
       right?

Chat : Wrong! Aifread never took anything from the poor. The truth is, he gave things to them.

Farah : He was a generous pirate?

Chat : Yes! Precisely! ...Now, let's take a look inside the ship.

You will be inside the ship.

Reid : It must be that way...

Get outside the ship for a second and search the upper right machine to get All-Divide. Now go
inside the ship again. Now go follow Chat to the machine room.

Keele : This has an even bigger Craymel engine than the one on the Craymel Express.

Chat : Beautiful, isn't it? It's a '43 model, 12 cylinder, horizontally-aligned Craymel Engine
       designed by the legendary Craymel Mage, Maxton. 8,000 zaks maximum revolutions. With
       the super-charger, it kicks out a peak torque of 28,000 este. Not only does it have
       power, its elegant design is nothing short of perfection. Machines are...beautiful!

reid : ...She's a bit weird...

Keele : ...She might be a little too obsessed with machines...

Reid : So...when can we set sail?

Chat : Oh, that's right. This way please.

Search the big engine here for a Lens. Now follow Chat upstairs to the Control Bridge and talk
to Chat to depart. You will see a nice FMV about the departing of this ship.

Keele : ...Captain. now, regards to hunting for Aifread's Legacy...

Chat : I can't tell you anything yet.

Reid : Huh?!

Chat : You lack the pirate spirit. I would like to observe your actions first...

Farah : So...?

Chat : Go ahead and proceed with your business. In time, I will decide if you can be trusted
       with the knowledge of the Legacy.

Farah : That's good to hear, but...

Reid : What an insult...

Chat : Where shall we go?

Meredy : Let's go to Peruti!

Chat : Peruti? No problem! The coordinates of its location are already logged, so we can go
       there on automatic control. Well, then. I'll go to the Engine Room to check the engine.
       By the way, that isn't a living thing, is it? What is it? WAAAAAAAAAH!! NO...no...no...
       no...! Animals are prohibited on this ship!

Meredy : Why?

Chat : Because I HATE ANIMALS! That's why!

Meredy : You will learn to like.

Quickie : Kweeekeee!

Chat : Aiieee! Eeeeek! Take...take it away! *Sob* *Sob* I HATE YOU!

Reid : As expected...

Keele : Kids will be kids...

Farah : ...And do you think you're mature enough to be calling someone else a kid?

The ship will automatically go to Peruti. But on the way...

Farah : Eeek!

Meredy : It's bouncy!

Keele : Doog... I feel sick...

Reid : Is the ship going to hold together...

Chat : The Van Eltia won't be damaged by ice that easily. Go ahead and enter the port.

The ship will finally reach Port City, Peruti.

Chat : We have arrived at the Port City, Peruti.

Farah : Okay, let's go ashore. I hope we can find information about Balir's location...

Chat : It seems to be very cold outside.

Reid : Are you coming with us?

Chat : No. No thank you. I'm too young to be exposing myself to unnecessary risk. Keele,
       what's wrong?

Meredy : No need to worry about Keele. Keele just a little sea-sick, that's all...

Chat : Keele, you can't live without Meredy, can you?

Keele : W...w...what are you talking about?! *Ugh*...I think I'm going to throw up...

Chat : I was just calling it as I saw it. Anyway, I'll see you again when you return.

Now you will be outside the ship.

Meredy : Oooh! It is cold! Huh? What is wrong?

Farah : It's f...freezing!!

Reid : Cold is an understatement. I'm going to FREEZE!!

Meredy : Peruti is always cold. But this cold seems not natural...

Farah : Aren't you cold, Meredy?

Meredy : Meredy cold, but not feel really, really cold. Keele?

Keele is frozen.

Meredy : Uh-oh! Keele frozen!

Farah : Let's find someplace warm right away!

Reid : ...Man, it's always Keele!

Farah : Wow! The town looks completely different!

Meredy : So this is real Peruti.

Guston : Hey! The heroes who saved Peruti are back!

Reid : Hey! You're the...

Guston : Ha ha ha! The name's Guston.

Farah : Thank you very much for paying for us.

Guston : No need to thanks! By the way, are you hungry?

Reid : Yeah! I'm about to starve to death!!

Guston : Great!! In that case, I'll treat you to a delicious feast!

Reid : Sounds great!!

Farah : Reid!

Inside Peruti Inn.

Keele : I tell you... Reid has no will power when it comes to food.

Reid : ...Hmm? Hey, I don't see any food here...

Guston : Just have a seat for a second. I have a favor to ask.

Reid : You tricked us!

Guston : You've got it wrong. I just want to ask you to join the Shileska Freedom Army. The
         Shileska Freedom Army was formed to defeat Balir, the current ruler. If you join us,
         I know we'll be successful!

Farah : So does that mean you know where Balir is?

Guston : You were all planning to...?!

Meredy : You bet! Defeat Balir!

Guston : Miacis to our hearts! Well, that's wonderful! We're seeing eye-to-eye already! Now
         that's what I call true Celestians!

Meredy : Actually, everyone Inferian, except Meredy...

Guston : What are Inferians doing here?

Keele : It's a long story...

Guston : ...Right. anyway, please go see Max, the leader of Shileska. He knows the whereabouts
         of Balir Castle.

Farah : Where do we find this Max guy?

Guston : It's a bit far, but he's in Tinnsia, the City of Artisans, on the continent to the
         west. That's where our hideout is located.

Keele : I don't know about this...

Guston : Come on, you've got to do it!

Meredy : More people against Balir is better.

Reid : Well... It is a bit disconcerting with just the four of us...

Farah : And there's no harm in meeting him. Let's go!

Keele : ...Fine. Let's go to Tinnsia!

Guston : Take this Miacis Badge with you. Show it to them and tell them that I sent you.

You will received Miacis Badge.

Guston : Ha ha ha! Now brothers and sisters, enjoy yourselves tonight!

Reid : Is it finally time to eat?

Guston : Yes, that's right! It's my treat tonight! Eat all you want and stay here for the
         night!

At night, inside Farah's and Meredy's room. You will see a light coming out from Meredy's
head.

Farah : Meredy, where are you going?

You will see a light coming out from Meredy's head.

Farah : What's that light...?

Meredy : Meredy hear voices from Imen. That is why Elara shining now.

Farah : What are they saying?

Meredy : Meredy not too sure. But Meredy hear cries... ...and screams. Meredy must go to Imen!
         Meredy go to Tinnsia later.

Farah : No way! Do you really think we'd let you go alnoe? ...But what about Shileska?

Farah : Shileska can wait. You can rely on us, you know. ...That's what friends are for!

Meredy : ...Thank you.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Keele : ...So that's the reason. Tinnsia will have to wait for now, but we will go there
        immediately after. Please let Max know.

Guston : I understand. Hold on to the badge. We'll be waiting for you. Please, take this map
         with you. I'm sure it'll come in handy if you ever get lost.

You will received Celestia Map.

Guston : Now, go on! ...And head to Tinnsia as soon as you can!

Meredy : Thank you, Keele.

Quickie : Kuweeeky!

Keele : Stop thanking me for every little thing!

Reid : Wow Keele, you can actually be nice sometimes.

Keele : W...what? Leave me alone!

Now go outside the Inn and go to the left screen. Search the statue near the pond for Wonder
Chef. This time he will teach you how to make Cold Noodles. Search the tree at upper left
screen for a Lens. Now go back to the previous screen and go downstairs to the right. Search
the cart with crabs inside for a Lens. You can talk to the three men near the cart. Now go to
the left to the port. You can see a painter here. Her name is Lesitia. Now go back to the
ship, Van Eltia then go to the engine room.

Reid : Hye, Chat. I mean...Captain! Let's hurry and head for Imen.

Chat : Aye aye. The town is lively. It looks like the ice has started to thaw.

Keele : We know. We're the ones who melted it.

Chat : You... You're all surprisingly good-natured.

Now go up to the Control Bridge.

Farah : Hey, let's go!

Choose yes to depart.
Controls : X = Move forward
           O = Move backward
           Directional button = Turn around
           Square = Open Travel Menu
Go to the engine room again and have Chat joined your party.

You can play a mini-game Around the Celestia! if you enter Peruti again. Talk to the captain
in the pier to play it.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mini-Game : Around the Celestia!
Rules : The race begins and ends at Peruti. First one back to Peruti is the winner. Easy,
        right? But there's a catch. You need to go through the check points in the correct
        order. If you miss them, you can't win. The controls for your ship are the same as
        usual. If you wanna quit, push Square.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can win this minigame easily if you has GPS at your valuables inventory. You will get it
later in the game.
1st Checkpoint : 31,75

You will see the city is destroyed and the townspeople died.

Reid : This is horrible! Who could have done this?!

Meredy : Where is everyone...?!

Meredy will leave the party.

Farah : Meredy, wait!

You can buy weapons, items, food if you talk to the man hidden by the wreckage at the first
screen. You can find Apple Gel if you search the crystal inside Kukurle's place. Search the
display case at Bupumu : Imen to get a Lens. Now go inside the library, you will see a
familiar face here.

Reid : Whoa!

Farah : Sagura?!

Keele : Meredy...

Farah : Meredy!

Keele : One of Balir's underlings?!

Reid : Haydes!!

Hyades : Hee ha ha ha ha! So you are Meredy's companions? Welcome to the party! You will soon
         be destroyed!

Reid : So you were the one? The one who did this to the town?! ...You're gonna pay!!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss : Hyades
HP : 45000
EXP : 4000

Attack : 500 (Cursed Roller, Ground Shake, Death Finger)
Defense : 800
Intelligence : 100
Strong : Water, Wind, Fire, Earth, Ice, Lightning
Weak : Light
Rewards : Mental Bracelet(100%), Egg(100%)

Strategy : He will often use Cursed Roller at the beginning, nothing to worry, because it can
           only do a little damage. Have him cornered and attack him continuously. But after
           you make a lot of damage on him, he will often use Death Finger, you must be
           careful with this attack; don't get cornered.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Farah : Did we...get him?

Keele : Hey, now just who was that?

Reid : Hyades. We fought him in Rasheans once before. Persistent guy...

Keele : ...Meredy, are you the one he's after?

Meredy : Meredy do not know...

Keele : You don't know? From the way he spoke, it seemed as though you knew each other!

Quickie : Kwww...kwww...kwww...keee...keee...

Meredy : Hyades...did not use to be like that. He could not be...

Keele : The village was almost completely destroyed! Answer me!

Farah : Stop it, Keele! Don't talk to her like that. ...Don't place the blame on Meredy!

Keele : I'm sorry...

Meredy : When Meredy was young, Hyades cared for Meredy a lot. But that was a long, looong
         time ago. That Hyades and this Hyades are not the same. It must be Balir's fault...
         Hyades changed. Sagura...?

Sagura : Bulenda! Hamilt!!

Bonz : Hey, hey, what about Lotte?

Now go to Bupumu : Imen.

Sagura : Heh. That poor Hamilt... He died before he became a full-fledged man... He hadn't
         even held a screwdriver... Bulenda too... What were you doing? She should have saved
         herself before she even tried to save me. Damn it all... Damn! Damn! Damn it all! If
         only I were stronger... If only my weapons had been more powerful...

Farah : It wasn't your fault. Don't...blame yourself so much.

Keele : We'll avenge them, I swear! We won't forget this!!

Sagura : ...Revenge? There's no point. The strong prey upon the weak... That's the way the
         world works.

Keele : Even if it is, it's Balir's fault!! All Balir's fault!!

Bonz : Hey, hey, what about Lotte? Where's Lotte?

Reid will go to the entrance alone.

Reid : I won't forget this...

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Farah : Well, good luck...

Sagura : Yeah, you too... I'll be okay now. I can't survive by myself, ...but I have Bonz
         here.

Meredy : ...Take care! When this is all over, Meredy will come back.

Keele : Yes. We will return! I promise...

Sagura : We'll be waiting! We'll try to get the town back on it's feet by then.

Reid : Be careful now. Don't overdo it and hurt yourself.

Sagura : Hey, watch it. Don't underestimate me just because I'm old!

Farah : All righty! Let's get going. To Tinnsia, City of Artisans!

Meredy : It is on the continent to the west.

Now go outside to the world map and enter Imen again. Talk to Bonz at the water pump to get
Technical Ring. Now go to Tinnsia, City of Artisans on the continent to the west.

Reid : H...hey...! what's with this town? It's full of machines!

Meredy : Tinnsia is the most technologically advanced city in all of Celestia!

Keele : With a hideout in a city like this, Shileska must be quite technologically advanced
        themselves.

Farah : So... ...where's the hideout?

Reid : Who knows...? It could be anywhere.

The house above is Fuedo : Tinnsia. There's nothing you can find here. So go upstairs by using
the moving platform. The house above is Carousel Sushi. Enter it and you will have a mini
game.

Reid : What is this...?

Man : Hey...are you hungry?

Reid : Yeah. I'm always hungry.

Man : Then let's have an eating contest! If you win, I won't charge you.

Reid : Yeah?! Really?!

Man : Yep. But there's a 2,000 Gald entry fee to participate. If you lose, you won't get it
      back.

Reid : Oh...

Man : So, are you up for the challenge? C'mon, hurry up and decide!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mini-Game:How to Play

Sushi
X : Select a sushi   Circle : Drink
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eat more expensive sushi than Kong the Man. Pace of eating will deteriorate as the upper-right
gauge fills. Drink to reset the gauge.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Points vary according the colors of the plate. More expensive plate fills the gauge faster.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GAME START -> START BUTTON

Yellow Plate worths 800 Points. Red Plate worths 300 Points. White Plate worths 100 Points.
You must have points more than 4300 to win this mini game. You will earned the title of King
of Hunger if you win this mini game. Now go to the right screen. The house above is Adetusu :
Tinnsia. You won't find anything here, so go outside. Search the statue near Lesitia at far
right for a Lens. Now go down to the screen below. The house far below is Ship Chandler.
Search the cat statue above for Wonder Chef. This time he will teach you how to make Broiled
Sandwich. Now go outside. The house above Ship Chandler is Teeru : Tinnsia. Search the wooden
box in the rack for Rune Bottle. You can see Irene again here. I wonder how she got here. At
this time you have collected more than 30 Lens if you follow my walkthru, so you will get
Celesti Cape from Irene. Now go outside and go to the right. The big house here is Hotel
Tinnsia. Search the red thing at the upper left screen for Wonder Chef. This time he will
teach you how to make Sweet Parfait. If you rest here, you will have some conversation.

Farah : Good night!

Reid : Yeah.

Inside the girl's room.

Meredy : Sooo soft.

Chat : Jumping on a bed like a trampoline... So childish...

Farah : Let's chat for a while before we go to sleep!

Chat : Chatting in bed... So childish...

Meredy : Okay! Let's sleep now!

Chat : Ah! D...don't turn off the light!!

Farah : So childish!

Now go outside to the far right. You will be stopped by a man from entering the ship.

Man : Where do you think you're goin'? You can't go in there without permission. Hmm...?

The man noticed Miacis Badge that Reid wore.

Man : Is that a...Miacis Badge?! Miacis to our hearts! Follow me.

??? : Miacis to our hearts! Forgive this rudeness. We heard the news from Guston, but we
      wanted to test you ourselves.

Keele : So what's the next test?

??? : That was enough. Welcome to Shileska's Headquarters. We are the revolutionary army
      fighting for the freedom of men's souls.

Reid : I guess that's one way to define freedom.

Farah : We came here to find out the whereabouts of Balir's castle. Do you know?

Ayla : You may call me Ayla. Please, come this way.

Now follow Ayla, go downstairs.

Ayla : Please take a look at this. This is our current location, Tinnsia. And that is Balir
       Castle.

Reid : It's surrounded by water!

Ayla : Yes. That is why we must use ships to carry out the attack.

Keele : Does Shileska have ships?

Ayla : Certainly. They aren't battleships... but in time of need, we can call for several
       dozen ships from all over Celestia. ...The problem is here. There is a wall surrounding
       the gate of Balir Castle, protected by an impenetrable barrier. No matter how many
       ships we have, we can't launch an attack against Balir Castle until we find a way to
       destroy that gate.

Farah : A barrier...?

Keele : It must be the power of Aurora Arte. It's probably also why we couldn't calculate
        their location accurately.

Ayla : Aurora Arte?

Meredy : It's the power of Balir's Fibrill. It's much, much more powerful than the Craymel
         Artes.

Reid : We don't know much about it, either.

Ayla : Please follow me.

Now follow Ayla downstairs. You will see a huge Craymel Cannon in the middle of the room.

Ayla : I'm sorry to have frightened you. We're conducting a firing test of the Craymel Cannon
       here.

Farah : Craymel Cannon?

Ayla : Think of it as an oversized Craymel Gun. But because we house Craymels in the largest
       possible Craymel Cage, its destructive power is hundreds of times stronger.

Reid : Sheesh... So even with a weapon this powerful, the gates of Balir Castle won't budge?

Ayla : Well... We don't know yet. If we make a Craymel Cannon to match the large Craymel Cage,
       the cannon becomes too big to carry on a ship.

Meredy : It's that...big?

Ayla : Yes. What you see here is just the barrel of the cannon. Altogether, it's larger than a
       house. This way, please.

Now follow Ayla again downstairs.

Ayla : Boss? It's Ayla. The people Guston spoke of are here. May we enter?

Max : Yeah!

Ayla : Please. You may enter now.

Go inside the room.

Ayla : Miacis to our hearts!

Max : Yeah!

Ayla : This is the leader of Shileska, Max. we have been waiting eagerly to meet face-to-face
       with the ones who tamed the mighty Ice Craymel.

Max : Yeah!

Ayla : We know your objective is Balir's Castle... Please! We would like you to join
       Shileska... Or if that is not possible, please consider an alliance.

Max : Yeah.

Ayla : We undoubtedly would like your assistance on the battlefield, but could you also assist
       us with your knowledge? Unless we build a small but powerful Craymel Cannon,
       penetrating Balir's Castle would be impossible.

Max : Yeah!

Ayla : Would you like to say something, Boss?

Max : That's the size of it. Defeat Balir and conquer the world!!

Farah : We don't really care to conquer the world... But we both want Balir defeated. So!
        We'll help Shileska.

Ayla : Thank you.

Keele : I may have an idea pertaining to the construction of a small-scale cannon.

Ayla : Really?

Keele : Using the device known as a Parasol, we can capture the Greater Craymels in a Craymel
        Cage.

Ayla : What?!

Max : So what?

Meredy : Umm, this is a Parasol. Specially made by Galenos.

Ayla : Galenos...? The renowned Craymel scientist? One Greater Craymel is worth ten thousand
       Craymels! So a small Craymel Cage would suffice our need!!

Max : ...Yeah!

Ayla : What about the Lightning Craymel?

Meredy : Unfortunate. We have not found.

Ayla : Be at ease. Every Shileskan knows where the Greater Craymel sleeps.

Keele : All right, let's head there immediately.

Ayla : Sorry to trouble you, but... May I ask someone to remain here to supervise the
       refitting of the Craymel Cannon?

Keele : I see...why don't I remain? I should be of some use. Besides, I'd like to examine the
        theory behind the Craymel Cannon.

Farah : So we'll be down to three...

Max : Don't worry. I'll come along with you. Ayla! Take care of my Miacis, Dede. She doesn't
      like pickles on her burgers. She's kind of...well you know.

Ayla : Delicate.

Max : Yes, that's it!! All right, let's move!

Ayla : How fortunate! The Boss is worth a hundred men.

Max : Mwah ha ha ha!

Meredy : Well, Keele. You take care.

Keele : Aa, aah. Um... You...too.

Ayla : Miacis to our hearts! Please be well.

You will received Keele's equipment and Max will joined your party.

Exit the room and enter again. Search the chest here for a Lens. So go outside the ship and
left to the next screen.

Max : Go southeast across the ocean. Eventually, you'll see land. You'll find the ruins there.
      You can board the ship from the pier.

At Control Bridge inside Van Eltia.

Max : Yo. Nice meeting ya, boy.

Chat : From a gender standpoint, calling me a boy isn't appropriate. And my name is Chat. And
       since I'm the owner of the Van Eltia, call me Captain from now on.

Max : All right, Chat.

Chat : To clarify, reid and his friends are my subordinates, and you...

Max : Who's going to steer? I can steer. Where's the steering wheel?!

Chat : If you don't listen to me...

Quickie will jump at the top of Max's head.

Max : You're a cute one!

Chat : ...Let us set sail.

Reid : This is where the Greater Lightning Craymel is...?

Max : Yeah.

Farah : It says something on this stone marker. Can you read it for us, Meredy?

Meredy : You bet! It says...when ancient tree in west is touched by dawn, stand in eye of
         dragon and sing emerald song.

Reid : ...I don't get it.

Farah : The ancient tree in the west... I bet it's the clue to opening the door.

Reid : Keele was always the one to figure these things out.

Meredy : If only Keele was here...

Max will tried to open the door with force and he succeed.

Max : Rrrrrrrnnnnchhh! ...All right!

Farah : I hope Max knows what he's doing...

When you near the door, you will see Max covered with dust.

Farah : Max?!

Max : Yeah.

Reid : Are you all right?

Max : Yeah.

Farah : You're Mr. Carefree, aren't you? Let's be careful, everyone.

Max has earned the title of Mr. Carefree. Now enter the ruins. Avoid the lightning and
continue upward. Search the stone tablet, it has a Lens. There are three ways here: left,
above and right. Take the above road first and enter the door. Here you will see 6 buttons in
the middle and three doors. The red door will be opened if you accumulated 15 points, blue
door -> 14 points, White door -> 17 points. The point is accumulated from the button that
going under.

                         X (Red Door)

                         O (6)

               (11) O         O (2)

(White door) X                  X (Blue Door)

                (5) O         O (3)

                     (4) O

At first, all the buttons are going under. Now to open blue door, you must make just button
6,5, and 3 going under. 14 = 6 + 5 + 3. Inside the blue door, get Stun Charm from the chest
and enter the door above. Enter the next door and go to the right, don't enter the door for
now. Get Pine Gel from the chest and go to the bottom. Press the bottom here until it's going
under and enter the right door. Go above to the next screen and get Big Bag from the chest and
go to the left. Press the bottom here until it's going under and go to the bottom two screens.
Now go to the left and get All-Divide from the chest. Search the shiny thing to get a fuse.
Now go back to the previous screen and go to the far right and then go to the bottom. Here
take the left below door and get Pirate's Hat from the chest. Go to the bottom and press L1 in
front of the fire to distinguish the electric barrier. Now go all the way back to the place
with 6 buttons and three doors.

Now let's try to open the white door. Try to make button 11, 4, and 2 going under. 17 = 11 + 4
+ 2. Inside the white door, go to the left. Go above and then go to the right. Press L1 in
front of the fire to distinguish the electric barrier and enter the door behind. Now insert
the fuse you got before and you can use the moving platform. Try to get above the stairs to
the next screen and you will reach the camp point.

Reid : I'm hungry...

Max : Yeah.

Farah : Shall we stop and rest?

Reid : Meredy is sound asleep.

Farah : She must be exhausted. Especially since Imen, she's been so... It's almost hard to
        watch...

Reid : Hey, there's something I've been wondering for a while.

Farah : What is it?

Reid : Why do you suppose Meredy is so driven to stop the Grand Fall?

Farah : She wants to save the world, right?

Reid : I guess so, but... Would any normal girl come this far alone?

Farah : Hey you never know. She's human. People can be complex, you know.

Reid : You too, Farah?

Farah : ...Maybe. Well, anyway. We're not the only ones worried about Meredy.

Reid : Oh yeah. There was someone else, wasn't there?

Farah : Everyone loves Meredy. Right?

Reid : I don't particularly...

Farah : Oh, Reid. Fess up!

Reid : But I...!

Farah : Hee hee! I'm just joking! Don't get so excited!

Go to the right three screens and you will reach a room full of electricity.

Reid : What IS this room?

Farah : We better be careful.

Max : Leave it to me!

Max will get electrified.

Max : I see. This ain't gonna be easy.

Farah : ...I don't think brute force is going to get us through. We need a clue...

Reid : Let's look around. Figuring this out is going to be tough without Keele to help us.

Now go back to the camp point and go above two screens. Get Pine Gel and Panacea Bottle from
the chests and enter the room above -> Control Room. Here you will get a hint about what you
have to do, you must insert something to the slot here. Now go back to the previous room and
go right two screens. You will see three buttons here: red, blue and green. Press just the
green button and enter the green and red doors. Here get Thunder Cape from the chest and go
above. Get Rune Bottle and Red Sage from the chests. Go above and then go to the right to get
Holy Staff and the pink thing. Go back to where the buttons are. Return the green button above
and this time press blue and red bottons. Get Voltic Sword from the chest and go to the right.
Get WakeUp Charm from the chest above and go to the Control Room. Search the panels here.

Farah : Reid! That thing we picked up!

Reid : Right.

Reid will put the pink thing he picked up before.

Farah : It worked! I wonder what it did?

Reid : Let's go back.

Now go to the camp point and go right three screens.

          O
        O   O
      O   O   O---(3)
(1,4)---O   O---(2)
          O

Just follow the order of the buttons you must pressed : 1, 2, 3, 4. Enter the door and just
follow the way into the room with strange purple thing in the middle.

Reid : It...it doesn't look like it's in a very good mood.

Meredy : Meredy scared...

Farah : We have no choice but to approach him.

Volt : WH...SWITCH, WHITE, SWITCH, WH...WHITE...SWITCH...

Max : ...It must be broken.

Max will get near the Volt.

Meredy : Baiba?!

Max will get electrified.

Farah : Here he comes!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss : Volt
HP : 54321
EXP : 3600
Gald : 0
Attack : 218 (Family Reunion, Lightning)
Element Attack : Lightning
Defense : 508
Intelligence : 160
Strong : Lightning, Wind, Fire, Earth, Ice, Light, Shadow
Weak : Water
Rewards : Holy Symbol(100%), Rune Bottle(100%)

Strategy : This boss is hard to defeat, not only he has a lot of HP but it floats in the air
           too. Reid can use Demon Twist. Meredy use Spread. The other can helped with healing
           HP and attacked too. Be careful with his skill Family Reunion, he will split into a
           lot of small Volt and damage you.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Max : Whew! ...I thought I was a goner.

Reid : You were asking for that one.

Meredy : Oh, no! the Greater Craymel in pain!

Celsius will come out from the Craymel Cage.

Max : Yeah?! ...Who are you?

Celsius : Something is not right.

Farah : What do you mean?

Celsius : I can tell. ...I sense his pain. He wants you to save him...

Celsius will go inside the Craymel Cage.

Reid : Celsius!

Farah : What do we do?

Volt : WH...SWITCH, WHITE, SWITCH, WH...WHITE...SWITCH...

Meredy : The words must be clues to help Volt!

Search the shiny thing in the back. It will START THE SLOT!! Just select the slot like the one
that Meredy said.

Volt : I...VOLT... WILL COOPERATE WITH...YOU.

Meredy : Thanks!

Volt will get inside the Craymel Cage.

Max : Well, blow me away!

Rem and Shadow will appeared.

Shadow : I am Shadow, the governing Craymel of Celestia! You have successfully gained the
         cooperation of all of the Primary Craymels. In recognition of your deed, I grant you
         this sword.

Rem and Shadow will fused together and you will received Excalibur.

Farah : Wow! The sword looks mighty!

Meredy : You bet! Maybe defeat Balir!

Max : Yeah! And take the throne!

Reid : All right! Let's head on back to Tinnsia! Keele should have the Craymel Cannon built by
       now.

Now go outside the world map and go back to Tinnsia. After that, go to Shileska's Hideout.

Inside Shileska's Hideout.

Chat : I'll wait for you at the ship.

Reid : All right.

Now go downstaits and you will see many peoples.

Reid : Whoa! Look at all these men! I didn't realize Shileska had this many soldiers...

Max : Yeah!

All the peoples : Miacis to our hearts!

Farah : Wow! I would have never guessed Max to be so popular!

Reid : They probably don't know the real Max like we do...

Meredy : Hey, hey! Let's go see the Craymel Cannon!

You will received Max's equipment. Go downstairs to the room with Craymel Cannon.

Keele : Meredy! Do we have the cooperation of the Greater Lightning Craymel?

Meredy : You bet! And we got more, too! Received the Excalibur from the Greater Dark Craymel,
         Shadow.

Ayla : Wonderful! With this, we're sure to beat Balir! But...why are the Greater Craymels
       being so cooperative?

Reid : Probably because they want to protect the world too.

Ayla : The world?

Keele : Balir wants to destroy the entire world. He's trying to annihilate Eternia. That's why
        we're fighting.

Farah : Ayla, we'll leave the decision to report this to the people of Shileska up to you.

Ayla : What about Boss?

Farah : He's celebrating with the others in the storeroom.

Ayla : ...I'm glad to hear he's okay.

Reid : Okay is hardly the word to describe him. I don't think there is a thing in the world
       that could stop Max.

ayla : Miacis to our hearts! Well, then. Let us install the Craymel Cannon on the Van Eltia at
       once.

Keele : The installation will probably take all night.

Ayla : All of you should try and get some rest to prepare for tomorrow morning's assault.
       Please accept this coupon for Hotel : Tinnsia.

You will received coupon for Hotel : Tinnsia.

Farah : Thanks. Sorry for all the trouble.

Ayla : Keele... You have a wonderful analytical ability.

Keele : Likewise, your observation is very insightful. You've taught me a lot. ...Thank you.

Now go to Hotel Tinnsia.

Meredy : Hey...where is Chat?

Reid : She's probably at the dock supervising the installation of the Craymel Cannon. She is
       the Captain of the Van Eltia, after all.

Now go inside Hotel Tinnsia and talk to the receptionist.

Receptionist : Welcome!

Keele : We have a coupon.

Receptionist : Certainly. You're staying in a suite. Please use the elevator on your right.

Now use the elevator. You can choose Guest Room, Suite or Rooftop. Choose Suite.

Reid : Wow, this is really something! Ahh! Feels great.

Quickie : Kuweeeky!

Meredy : Meredy's a bit sleepy. Can I sleep?

Reid : Uh...sure... ...Good night. What's wrong with Meredy? She seemed a bit down.

Farah : She's nervous. Thinking about tomorrow makes even me...

Reid : Wow, what a view! I can see the whole town!! Once tomorrow's battle is over, let's stay
       in this lavish suite again. All of us. Together...

Farah : Yeah! Let's do! I wanna be well rested for tomorrow. I'm going to bed.

Keele : I'm so pathetic. Things have come to a head, and all I can feel is fear. Can't even
        spare a thought for the others...

Reid : Look. Even I haven't stopped shaking. Any sane person would be afraid... All right. I'm
       going to sleep now. If Balir hits us with 100% of his power, we'll take him on with
       400% of ours. Isn't that what fighting with friends is all about?

Keele : The calculation is a bit simple... But you're right!

You will see the past memory of Reid. A monster will kill the townspeople.

Reid : A giant monster!

Bitz : Reid, what are you doing?! Get over here!!

You will be in basement of Reid's house.

Bitz : Reid! Tell me. Did you go to Regulus Knoll? Listen. Stay inside. Father will return
       later.

Bitz, Reid's father will lock the door.

Reid : Father?! Don't go!!! It...it's my fault. My...myfault. My fault... All my fault!!
       Father!! Faaather!!!

You will be awake from the dream.

Reid : That dream again...

Now go to the girl's room. Reid will notice Mere3dy is missing.

Reid : Meredy's missing.

Now go to the Rooftop. You will see Meredy and Quickie here.

Reid : Can't sleep?

Meredy : Reid?!

Farah will come to the rooftop too.

Reid : I couldn't sleep, either. A dream about my father woke me up.

Farah will hide near the stairs.

Meredy : Your father...is not here?

Reid : ...Yeah. He and my mother died when I was two years old.

Meredy : Mother and father not here. Like Farah.

Reid : And Meredy.

Meredy : Hey...Reid?

Reid : Hmm?

Meredy : Does Reid have memories of father and mother?

Reid : Usually, I don't think about them much... It's sad, but my memories have faded with
       time. But sometimes I feel them. Warm, calm, like a light... Always protecting me. So I
       guess those are my memories... Ha ha... I... I don't really get it myself. Hey, why are
       you so quiet? You're making me blush.

Meredy : So are those memories?

Reid : Huh?

Meredy : Reid's memories, Meredy understands. Warm and calm inside... Meredy has them too. So
         those are memories!

Reid : Meredy...?

Meredy : All right! Let's go back. Meredy is sleepy now.

Reid : Yeah. Tomorrow's the big day. Let's get some sleep.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Keele : You haven't left anything behind, have you?

Reid : Left anything? This isn't a field trip, you know.

Keele : It's important to be prepared.

Farah : Anyway, let's go see Max! We can get ready afterwards.

Now go to Shileska's Hideout and you will see Ayla in the storeroom.

Keele : Ayla!

Ayla : Good morning. The Shileska Army has already boarded the vessels.

Meredy : Ayla is not going?

Ayla : My duty is to stand guard here while everyone is away.

Keele : I see. Well...we're leaving now, too.

Ayla : Please take care.

Now go back to your ship, Van Eltia through Ship Chandler.

Chat : Good morning. There's a magnificent Craymel Cannon on board now. It was all completed
       under my close supervision.

Max : Yeah! If you're all ready, hurry up and get on aboard! We're gonna carry out that thing!

Chat : Operation Invade Balir Castle!

Max : Yeah, that! Grind Balir to the ground!

Farah : ...It seems Ayla didn't tell Max about our purpose.

Max : Yeah! I heard. I conquer the world, and save it as well, right?

At the control Bridge.

Chat : Enemies sighted!

Max : Yeah! Let's get ready for...

Chat : Naval battle!

Max : Yeah, that's it! All we have to do to win is totally destroy the enemy ships! Piece of
      cake, huh?

Chat : All right, Reid. I'll leave the steering to you.

Reid : Right!! Let's do it!!

Farah : Max! Are you leaving?

Max : Yeah. My men are waiting.

Keele : Right...

Reid : Okay, change of plans. Good luck, Max. We'll meet in front of Balir.

Max : Yeah.

Search the barrel above you for a Lens. Now go to the right. You can buy items and weapons
here. After finish your business, enter the castle.

Reid : What a mess... This is Balir's home?

Keele : This...is the place? Balir rules over all of Celestia...from here?

Meredy : Balir lets nobody come. Balir trusts nobody...

Keele : Let's proceed with caution.

You can't get the treasure to your right, so go to the left through the door. You will see 4
monsters in glass cages. Ignore them, get Pretty Ribbon from the chest. If you search the
machine above and press the console button(choose Yes), the monsters will be unleashed and the
elevator will be activated. I suggest you not to press the console button(Choose No), so go
upstairs. Go to the right first and get Dragon Vein from the chest. Now go back to the
previous screen, go upstairs and then go to the right two screens. Go get Elixir from the
upper left door but you have to fight Fake for it. You can get Rare Shield from the other
upper left door. The middle door won't open. Go get Scale Robe and Dragger Lance from the two
upper right doors. Go to the right two screens and you will reach a camp point. You can rest
here to restore your HP. There is a teleporter here but it isn't active, so go above through
the door. Get Lapis Bracelet from the chest and use Freeze Ring(press L1) to the blue thing to
make the barrier move. Use Freeze Ring again(press L1) to another blue thing to make the
barrier move and get the white card. Now go down two screens and after that go above two
screens. Get Silver Cloak from the chest and then go down and to the left. Ignore the monster
for now and take the upper left door. The chest here is a Fake but you will get another Elixir
if you defeat it. Now go down and get Silver Plate from the chest. Go to the right and fight
the monster.

Gald : 3000
Attack : 230 (Vertical Spin)

Strategy : This monster is very easy to defeated. Just use Demon Twist all the time and you
           will defeat him.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Go downstairs and go to the left. Get Black Onyx from the chest and go back to the hall. This
time go to the right two screens. Search the panel at upper right and you will use white card
you got earlier. Now go to the teleporter at the upper left and use it. You will be back at
the camp point. Shoot the red crystal with Sorcerer's Ring(press R1) and the door will be
opened. Enter the door and go upstairs two times. Get a Lens from the chest and go above.
Check the computer here and you will input the code. Now go back to the camp point and go to
the left four screens to the left tower. Shoot the red crystal with Sorcerer's Ring(press R1)
and the door will be opened. Enter the door and go upstairs. Get Mythril Arms from the chest
and go upstairs. Enter the door and check the computer again to input the code. Now go
downstairs to the place where you shot the red crystal and then go to the right two screens.
Enter the middle door and prepare yourself for Boss battle.

Reid : There he is!!

Keele : Balir?

Farah : Wait! Something's wrong!!

Meredy : Ba...lir?

Keele : It's a mummy. Could this be Balir?

Meredy : No...!

Reid : Does this mean Balir is dead? If so... Who's behind the Grand Fall?

??? : Balir is dead. Balir died 10 years ago. But his soul lives within me.

Meredy : Shizel?!

Shizel : ...Oh, so it's you. It's been a long time, Meredy.

Farah : Meredy, do you know her?

Reid : Who is she?

Meredy : Shizel is... Balir's consort.

Keele : Consort...? You mean Balir's wife?

Farah : Are you the one causing the Grand Fall?!

Shizel : Of course. Could any other?

Farah : But why?!

Shizel : What is the value in a world choking in the miasma of its own sickening desire? It
         was also the dying wish of Balir against all those whose obsession with material
         possessions took his life.

Reid : That's no reason... We can't just let you destroy Eternia!!!

Shizel : You fool... It isn't destruction, it's rebirth! Balir and I will allow none to stand
         in our way.

Reid : So we have no choice... ...but to fight!

You will see someone shot Shizel.

Reid : Max?!

Max : Ho! Looks like I was a step late for the big dance. Leave Balir to me! ...Oh? Balir's a
      woman? No matter! Victory will be mine! CHARGE!!!

Shizel : Fool!!

Shizel will use her spell against Max and his subordinates.

Farah : Max! Are you all right?!

Max : ...Yeah?

Reid : Not much for small talk, is she? Let's do it!

Shizel : A waste of time...

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss : Shizel
HP : 120000

Gald : 0

Strategy : Wow! She has a lot of HP. If she uses Eternal Finality, your HP will drop into 1.
           Just let her kill you.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Shizel : Heh heh heh heh... I did not wish to waste my true power on the likes of you, ...but
         you give me no choice.

Reid : What?!

Ras : Run! You mustn't fight!!

Farah : Ras?! ...How?!

Ras : Your powers are no match for her Aurora Arte! Run!!

Reid : How would you know?!

Shizel : Heh, heh, heh... Too late. I say again...vanish yonder into Vatenkeist! Face the
         baptism of the Aurora!!

Ras : Aurora Wall!

You will see a nice FMV about Shizel going to the Inferia. You will be outside the castle.

Reid : Am I...alive? Hey! Is everyone all right?!

Meredy : I'm alive. I wonder why?

Keele : I'm okay, too.

Reid : Farah?! Farah, Farah!! No...

Farah : Hey, Reid. What's wrong?

Reid : Whaddaya mean what's wrong?

Keele : How did we survive... ...a full impact of Aurora Arte?

Reid : Ras! Ras!

Ras : Reid...

Reid : Why! Why...did you save us?!

Ras : there was something I needed to...give you.

Reid : Is this the...Seyfert Key?

You will see the shiny light.

Reid : This light...what is it?

Ras : It is the Divine Aurora.

Reid : Divine...Aurora? What is Aurora anyway? What does it have to do with me?

Ras : Meet with Galenos. He will tell you the rest. It looks like... this is the end for me.

Farah : Ras!

Ras : Reid... Protect those you love. Aurora Artes exist for that purpose.

Reid : Ras!!

Keele : Ras...

Meredy : Ras...

Farah : Noooooo!!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Meredy : Farah...are you okay?

Farah : I...I'm fine! I'm ready to go all the way. ...I'm fine.

Reid : ...Then, let's go. Let's go see Galenos in Luishka and find out what Ras was trying to
       tell us.

Farah : The Divine...Aurora...

Reid : Yeah. It looks like it's our role to search for it.

Farah : Right! No problem!

Meredy : You bet!

Now go aboard Van Eltia and go to Ruined Village, Luishka to meet Galenos.

Keele : Meredy, I have a question for you.

Meredy : ...Yes?

Keele : What is your relation to Shizel?

Meredy : Shizel is Meredy's mother.

Farah : Huh? What? Then... Balir is your...?

Meredy : Father.

Reid : ...I see. No wonder. Now it makes sense why you've been so determined.

Keele : Why didn't you tell us?! Are we really that unreliable? Can't you trust us? If you
        don't trust me, then how am I supposed to trust you?!

Meredy : I am sorry. H...How do I say? I did not know. I'm sorry...

Farah : It's all right, Meredy. Having to fight your own mother... I can't even begin to
        imagine the pain.

Keele : Was Shizel always like that?

Meredy : Balir and Shizel... They were kind, long ago. Long, long ago. But Meredy remembers.
         Warm light, memories...

Farah : Then, why is she doing this?

Meredy : I do not know. Meredy...away from them for long time.

Reid : This may all be tied in with the Aurora Arte.

Keele : Right. Once we meet Galenos we might learn something.

Galenos : I see... So Ras wasn't in time.

Reid : Tell me, Galenos. Why did Ras save us...? How did you know him...?

Galenos : All is due to the key's guidance.

Reid : This Seyfert Key's...guidance?

Galenos : It holds the will of the god of creation, Seyfert. To follow this key is to follow
          the will of Seyfert.

Farah : Was Ras... guided by Seyfert to visit you?

Galenos : Yes, and to learn the Aurora Arte, he passed the Trials of Seyfert.

Keele : The Trials of Seyfert?

Galenos : There are two forms of the Aurora Artes. There is the Dark Aurora of Nereid, and
          there is the Divine Aurora of Seyfert.

Farah : The Divine Aurora... ...Aurora Arte of Seyfert... So if we have that, can we beat
        Shizel?!

Galenos : Perhaps... But it cannot be acquired unless one bears the Fibrill.

Meredy : Fibrill? ...Strong power!

You will see the light came from Reid.

Galenos : Yes. That light has taught us this... That both Reid and Ras share the same
          essence...

Farah : Then why? Why did Ras lose to Shizel? Didn't he undergo the Trials of Seyfert and
        acquire the Divine Aurora Arte?

Galenos : Ras... ...had not completed the trials.

Meredy : Because he came to save us?

Galenos : That was the decision he made of his own free will.

Reid : Where is it, Galenos? The place where I can undergo the Trials of Seyfert?

Farah : Reid!

Galenos : You will...try for us?

Keele : Reid...

Reid : I'm the only one with the Fibrill, right?

Galenos : Indeed. The trials are at the Seyfert Shrine. The Seyfert Key will show you the way.

Reid : I got it. We'd better get going. We've got no time to waste.

Meredy : You bet. Let's go!

Farah : No problem!

Reid : Galenos...what will you do?

Galenos : It's a bit out of your way, but could you take me to the Shileska's Hideout?

Meredy : Going to meet Shileska?

Galenos : I would like to join forces with them to find a way to defeat Shizel.

Reid : I understand. Let's visit Tinnsia first.

You will be back at Van Eltia and Farah is on the Deck alone.

Galenos : Thinking about something?

Farah : Yeah. ...I am. Why did...Ras save us?

Galenos : ...Ras felt grateful to you. You taught him to see the world as it is, with
          unclouded eyes.

Farah : That can't be... Ras was the one who did all the teaching.

Galenos : He said that he had changed too. That he had learned to become an individual, ruled
          by no one, and stand on his own two feet. So when he saved you, it was for the sake
          of the world. Ras wanted to save the world.

Farah : He wanted to save the world, too?

Galenos : Ras did not die in vain. ...Isn't that so?

Farah : Yes, I won't let it be in vain. Not on my life!

Now go to City of Artisans, Tinnsia.

Galenos : What do you think? I believe my knowledge of Aurora Arte should be of good use.

Ayla : Miacis to our hearts! I am honored to meet a famous Craymel Engineer such as yourself,
       Galenos. I humbly beg for your assistance. Boss? Will it be all right with you?

Max : Yeah!

Farah : Yeah!! All right!!

Galenos : Then shall we negin our research of the dark matter that Shizel disappeared into?

Ayla : Yes.

Reid : Well, we'll be leaving now.

Meredy : We will return as soon as Reid gets the Divine Aurora!

Galenos : Meredy... Please be very careful. When you're unsure of your destination, hold the
          Seyfert Key and recite your wish calmly in your mind.

Farah : Reid, don't lose it.

Reid : Don't worry. I made sure to put it in the bag of valuables.

Now talk to Max to make him join your party. Now talk to the man where there is a Craymel
Cannon.  Choose "Yes, I'll donate 20000 Gald" and you will receive Plasma Cannon. Now go to

Keele : Reid, try using the Seyfert Key.

Reid : Sure. ...Where did I put it?

Quickie : Kuu...Kweee, Kuweeky!

You will see a light coming out from Seyfert Key and the light will direct to south.

Reid : WOW.

Chat : What was that light?!

Farah : Seyfert is guding us! Seyfert's Shrine must be at the end of that light!!

Now go to Peruti. Search the pink Miacis in the barrel.

Max : Yeah! It's the Courier of Fortune, Miacis!

Meredy : Hweel! Meredy always wanted to pet Pink Miacis...

Max : Bwa ha ha ha! Leave this to me! Whoa!

The Pink Miacis will use lightning spell on Max.

Max : Yeah? Why do you run from me?

Reid : Because you scared it, Max!

Max : Yeah? Did I? No matter! I just got an idea for a new skill! What luck, what luck! Bwa ha

Keele : I wonder how many others have made it this far?

Reid : Ras has definitely been here. And I'm next. That's all that matters. Let's continue
       forward.

Inside Seyfert Shrine.

Meredy : Who is this?

Reid : ...Maybe the person who came up with this whole idea about the trial?

Farah : Seyfert? But...he doesn't look at all like the bronze statue we saw in Inferia.

Keele : This one seems to be much older. In Inferia, as the legend passed down from generation
        to generation, the image of Seyfert probably changed to look more heroic.

Meredy : He...ro...ic?

Keele : Seyfert sacrificed his life to defeat Nereid. Thanks to him, the long war came to a
        close.

Meredy : Huh? Did not Nereid rise to free the oppressed...?

Keele : What are you talking about?

Meredy : That's what Meredy was taught.

Farah : There seems to be a difference between the history taught in Inferia and Celestia. I
        wonder which one is correct?

Keele : We may find the answer here.

Keele try to enter the barrier but he can't go in.

Keele : Huh? I can't go in.

Farah tried too but she can't go in.

Farah : You're right.

Meredy tried too but she kicked out away.

Meredy : Baiba!

Keele : Meredy!

Meredy : N...no worry! Meredy just tripped!

Keele : How could you fly all the way over there by just tripping?!

Meredy : Meredy said Meredy OKAY!!

Keele : I was worried about you!

Reid : Are you sure you're all right?

Meredy : You bet.

Reid : All right! Let me try.

Reid tried too and he can go inside.

Reid : This is Seyfert's will. I'll do what I have to do.

Farah : Be careful.

Reid : I know. I promise I'll come back.

Keele : Well...uh... ...Good luck to you. What you learn might help my research.

Reid : I got it, I got it.

Reid will go inside.

You will be inside Trial Room. Go above and you will see a shadow.

Reid : W...What's going on?

??? : You have come.

Reid : That voice...?

??? : You cannot touch me. For I am... not here.

Reid : Who...the hell are you?

??? : I am the Messenger of Seyfert.

Reid : The Messenger of...Seyfert.

??? : Even for those with Fibrill, the Trials of Seyfert are cruel. Are you prepared?

Reid : I'll pass any Trial you throw at me.

??? : Then I shall ask but one thing... Why do you desire the Aurora Arte?

Reid : There's only one reason. To defeat Shizel.

??? : Why defeat her?

Reid : Because! She's trying to destroy all of Eternia! ...That's not a good thing.

??? : Eternia... Why would you sacrifice all that you have to protect it? The Trial is cruel.
      If you are half-hearted, you will only destroy yourself.

Reid : There are people I love that live in this world. I'm not letting them die!

??? : ...Continue onwards and open the door with your heart. The first trial awaits.

Reid : Huh?

The Messenger of Seyfert will be disappeared leaving yellow feathers behind. Go inside the
circle. You will be transform into an Egg Bear.

Egg Bear : Is this me? A monster!

Go down two screens and you will see three dead eggbears.

Egg Bear : My family...killed.

Two Egg Traders will come to this screen.

Egg Trader : Ah, finally the boss appears. But I won't lose to the likes of an Egg Bear!

Egg Bear : S, stop. I'm a human!

You will have to fight the Egg Trader. Defeat him.

Egg Bear : H...have I killed? ...A human?

Egg Trader : Heee, heeelp! Let me go!

The Egg Trader will run away, dropping the EggBear's egg.

Egg Bear : Aaaah! Our eggs! This place is...dangerous?

Now go to the left.

Egg Bear : My, my...eggs!

Now go down to the next screen. Here you will see your party.

Egg Bear : Live...I will live!

Farah : Aaaah!

Keele : An Egg Bear!!

Meredy : (Talking in Melnics language.)

Reid : Leave this to me!

You will have to fight Reid and Keel. You can't win this battle, so just let them defeat you.

Egg Bear : I...I... want to...live.

Farah : Why don't we camp here?

Reid : ...Yeah. I'm starved!

Your party will be in front of fireworks and Reid will hold his sword.

Keele : What are you doing?

Reid : Huh? I'm making jerky. If you dry Egg Bear meat, it makes good emergency rations.

Keele : I'm afraid I can't agree. Over time, Eggbear meat undergoes a chemical transformation
        and loses much of its nutrients.

Reid : What're you talking about, Keele? You've never even eaten it!

Keele : I don't need to eat it to know. It's explained in detail in Volume 3, Chapter 21 of
        the Leonoa Encyclopedia.

Reid : Humph! I don't care what it says. I eat it all the time and I know I'm right!

Farah : Boys! Calm down. Does it matter either way?

You will be back to the Trial Room.

Reid : I'm...? This is? Waah!

The Messenger of Seyfert will appear again.

Reid : Y...you're... The Messenger of Seyfert.

??? : You have returned alive.

Reid : Wait a minute... Was...that the trial?

??? : The whirling thoughts now within your heart must not be forgotten. They are that which
      you are not aware of or have avoided.

Reid : I'm ahunter! I...had to do that to live!

??? : It is all right. No one can blame you for what you have done. Facing the truth...in
      time... ...those will be your trials.

Reid : ...I understand. I won't seek false justification. I'll accept fact as fact.

??? : It is well. You have overcome Seyfert's first trial. Receive the Aurora Wall.

Reid : Aurora Wall?

??? : An Aurora Arte which protects by forming a quasi-space barrier.

Reid : Oh, that was the skill Ras protected us with.

??? : Now, seek the path to your next trial.

Reid : There are more Trials? Will I become a monster again?

??? : ...The Trials are not predetermined... It simply opens a passage to the conflict within
      your own heart.

The Messenger of Seyfert will be disappeared leaving yellow feathers behind. You have mastered
Aurora Wall. It can be activated during battle by pressing Circle, X, and Square
simultaneously when Reid's HP is flashing. It's a Sacred Skill that will nullify the actions
of everyone, including any uses of Craymel Artes. HP will decrease during its use. Once the
skill is used, it cannot be used again until your HP is recovered above a certain level. Now
go back to your party.

Meredy : Reid? What is matter? Are you all right?

Reid : S...sorry. I'm still kinda dazed.

Keele : Did you complete the trial?

Reid : I completed the first trial. There's still more.

Meredy : Really?!

Reid : Don't worry. I'm not going to give up.

Farah : Reid...

Reid : I was given the Aurora Wall by Seyfert's messenger. It's the skill that Ras used to
       save us...

Farah : ...I see.

Meredy : Yaaay, Reid! Let's hurry back to the Van Eltia!

You will be in the Deck of Van Eltia.

Meredy : Where is next trial?

Reid : This will tell us.

The Light will pointed out above to Inferia.

Keele : So the next test is going to be in Inferia?

Farah : How do we get there?!

Reid : We'll search. If the Seyfert Key is pointing to Inferia, there's got to be a way to get
       back!

Meredy : ...Meredy agree. There might be something like Craymel Craft somewhere.

Keele : I doubt it. It would be quicker to ask Galenos to make one for us.

Meredy : Galenos said it takes years and years.

Farah : No problem! If we look, I'm sure we'll find something that will take us back to
        Inferia!

Inside the Control Bridge.

Chat : Inferia? I'm afraid that's not possible. Van Eltia is only a ship.

Keele : Of course it can't. I want to gather clues about how to return to Inferia. Take us
        ashore at the nearest town.

Meredy : We find something like the Bridge of Light!

Chat : A bridge...? Let's go and search for Aifread's Legacy.

Reid : Um...why NOW?

Chat : You do want to go to Inferia, right? You do know who my Great-Grandfather is, don't
       you?

Farah : It's Aifread, isn't it? The Great Pirate who struck fear into sailors all over the
        world?

Chat : That's right! And all over the world means all of Eternia.

Farah : Are you suggesting that one of Aifread's Legacies may be a tool for us to get to
        Inferia?

Keele : Are you sure?

Chat : First of all, let's go back to my mansion. Leave it to me.

from the upper left chest and after that go down the ladder to the next screen. Get Saint
Halberd from the upper right chest and after that go down to the next screen. Get Holy Circlet

           let him cast his spell on you. Equip Excalibur to make a major damage because Light
           is his weakness. Empty Doll is very annoying too because beside it has a lot of
           HP(60000), it can recover its HP(3000) too. The good skill for Reid to use is Demon
           Twist. Just concentrate your attack on Shadow, don't bother with Empty Doll.

Reid : Oh yeah. Let's go to the deck.

You will see the light pointed to northeast.

Go down and go to the left door. You will be in a room with a statue in the middle.

Keele : What is this? Talk about poor taste! The interior decoration has absolutely no sense
        of order nor unity. And this horribly amateurish nude statue of a middle-aged man
        couldn't possibly be any further from what art should be. Who could have designed this
        abomination?

Farah : Do you really think it's that bad...? I think it looks sort of fun and exciting!

Reid : This place looks scary... I get a feeling that this place is haunted.

There are 6 doors in here. You can only enter the three doors: left, middle, right. Go through
the left doors first. This section looks like a traditional Japanese house/oriental house.

because it can decrease your HP. The treasure chest here is a Fake, you can get a Elixir if

Chat : Looks like the ship sank a long time ago.

Keele : Yeah. But in comparison to the decay of the exterior, the interior of the ship is
        surprisingly clean.

Reid : You think so? It smells moldy to me!

Chat : This could well be the Cursed Sea, responsible for sinking countless ships... I've read
       about it in my great-grandfather's log.

Reid : Hey, hey! Don't talk about curses! It's CREEPY in here already as it is!

Keele : Hmm... It may be worth looking around.

Chat : I agree. We may be able to find the reason why this ship sank.

Reid : I'm really not interested in finding out...

Go downstairs and you will see three paths in here. Go to the far right first. There are three
doors in here: down, middle and above. Enter the above door first and get Cute Mitten from the
chest. Now enter the middle door, the treasure chest here is a Fake. You will get a Elixir if
you defeat it. Now enter the door below and get Bulkhead Key from the chest.

Now go back to the first screen and this time enter the far left door. There are four doors in

the chest. Now enter the middle door and get WakeUp Charm from the chest. There's nothing you
can find inside the door below and far below, so get back to the first screen.

Now enter the middle door and use Bulkhead Key to open the door. Go to the next screen and get

Reid : ...What is this song?

Chat : You mustn't listen to it! I read about it in my great-grandfather's logbook! It's
       coming from the one who sings to lure mariners, and sends them to their graves deep
       within the ocean...

Keele : You mean the Siren?! ...That's impossible! Volume two, Chapter 12 of the Leonoa
        Encyclopedia clearly states that the Siren is nothing but a mythological creature.

Chat : The Siren is a pirate's real-life nightmare!

Siren : Come. Dreams await you in the depths of the seas...

           because the rock below her will swallow you. I assume you already have a high level
           now, so this enemy is not so hard to defeated.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chat : This is a dark and sad place. Please release the souls of those who have died in the
       sea. And then, release yourself as well...

Siren : Thank you.

Siren will be disappeared.

Chat : Keele? It looks like Aifread the pirate is innocent after all.

Keele : Y...yeah.

Chat : Is that a proper response?

Keele : Aye aye, sir!

Get 14305 Gald, 15365 Gald, 10655 Gald and 12245 Gald from the pouchs. Now go back to the
world map and go to Celestia by using Bridge of Expedition. Now go to Chat's Hut.

Chat : This is terrible!

Reid : What's wrong?

Chat : Someone switched the monument with a fake!

Meredy : 120:128. It's true! The numbers are different from before!

Chat : I must get the real one back! It is an irreplaceable monument left by my great-
       grandfather!

Keele : If 120:128 is our clue... Then this doesn't appear to be the work of an ordinary
        thief.

Chat : Is somebody deliberately challenging me, the descendant of the Great Pirate, Aifread?
       If we use GPS, we can go to that location! Let's get going right away! What's the
       problem? Let's get going!

Now let's go to GPS(120,128). You will found Pico Revenge. Now go back to Chat's Hut and enter

Keele : Is everything in this house from the Aifread Era?

Chat : Yes, most of it anyway.

Keele : The year is written on the barrel.

Chat : S.E. 2208

Keele : S.E. 2208...in Celestian years? How many years ago would that be?

Chat : Huh? Let's see... It's S.E. 2296 this year, so... Hold on a minute. Ummm...Do you have
       a piece of paper?

Keele : If it's S.E. 2296 now, then it must be 88 years ago. Can't you do the calculation in
        your head? You'd better study more math.

Chat : Please... You sound like my mother.

Keele : ...That's interesting. I haven't heard you talk much about your mother.

Meredy : Hey! Hey! Meredy found this paper stuck in the back!

Reid : What does it say?

Chat : Do you have what it takes to be a great pirate? Take my challenge and test your
       worthiness! Those who manage to clear my obstacles will earn their just reward!

Farah : A challenge?

Meredy : From who?

Chat : Isn't that obvious? It's my great-grandfather...the Great Pirate, Aifread. It says to
       go to Aifread's Hideout.

Keele : You mean that hideout at 204:98?

Chat : Yes! We have no choice! We MUST go!

Now let's go to Aifread's Cavern(204,98). Chat will face this challenge alone. You will have a

Priest : You possess the Seyfert Key?!

Reid : Yeah. I'm holding it for someone. Well... What should we do now?

Priest : There's no question! You MUST proceed. That is Seyfert's will.

??? : Ah. I am the Greater Elemental Craymel, Maxwell.

Maxwell : Few humans come to this faraway place. What exactly do you wish of me?

Farah : We require your help to save the world!

Maxwell : Well, well! It's been hundreds of years since humans made a request of me! But I do
          hope you are aware... When you make a request of a Greater Craymel, there may be

Now let's talk to the old man in front of Arena at Area 3.

Old Man : Young ones! Did you happen to come across a Grip Sword by any chance? It's a sword
          with a special grip.

Reid : Nope. Haven't seen it.

Farah : You're looking for a weapon called the Grip Sword?

Old Man : I must have dropped it somewhere in this town... For this is my first time here, I
          can't find my way through the city without getting myself lost as well.

Farah : That's a shame.

Reid : Farah! We don't know the city any...

Farah : Leave it to us! We'll find it for you! Right, Reid?

Choose Yes.

Reid : Awww right.

Old Man : Thank you! I truly appreciate your help! I'm going to give this area another once-
          over.

Now go to Area 4 and talk to the woman in the middle screen in front of Seyfert Sanctuary.

Woman : A Grip Sword? I'm afraid I've never heard of it. ...Oh, wait! I did overhear an
        announcement about a lost item at the Royal Playhouse... Why don't you go to a window
        and ask about it?

Now go inside Imperial Playhouse, it's the building above the woman. Talk to the man up the
stairs.

Man : A lost item? It was just claimed by the customer over there...

Man : W...whaddya want? This is mine! It's true, I tell you!

Farah : What did you drop?

Man : D...don't look! I told you, don't look!

Farah : Huh?

Man : Ah!

Reid : What was it?

Farah : ...Well, it wasn't a sword.

Man : I can't believe I let a girl see this... T...this is too much!

I wonder what's the thing that embarassed the man.

Farah : Okay, let's keep moving.

Reid : O...kay...

Now go outside and go down the screen to Area 2. Talk to the first man you encountered.

Man : I just saw a soldier holding a sword with a big grip...

Now talk to the soldier inside the Arena at Area 3 in front of the left lady.

Farah : Excuse me...

Soldier : What?!

Reid : We're looking for something an elderly gentleman dropped...

Soldier : Something he dropped? Are you talking about this?

Farah : Yes, that's it! The Grip Sword!

Soldier : Such a fine sword! I wanted to try it out once... Well, I can't keep what's not
          mine. Here you go.

Reid : Great! Let's hurry up and get it back to the old man!

Farah : Okay!

Now talk again to the old man in front of the arena.

Reid : Hey, is this the sword that you lost?

Old Man : Oh! You found my Grip Sword! I'm deeply indebted to you! Without this sword, my
          student can't enter the Arena!

Farah : Your student?

Old Man : I don't look like much, nonetheless I am a teacher. I am truly grateful for your

Farah : I just remembered! I heard a story once... They say you can hear voices from the hotel
        walls in the middle of the night... The voice would say... Give me your legs... Give
        me your legs!

Reid : Hey! Which hotel are you talking about?!

Farah : Hmm... I don't know... They say when you hear the voice, you have to cover up your
        legs or they'll get taken away! Anyway...good night!

Reid : Why did you have to tell me the story now?!

Keele : Aaahhh!

Reid : What's the matter, Keele? Did you see a ghost?!

Keele : What a discovery! This will revolutionize the Craymel theory!

Reid : Don't babble in your sleep!

If you enter Scaroni Grill, you will find Katrine and Pierre again.

Farah : Katrine! Pierre?! What are you two doing here?

Reid : Did you make it in time for the Academic Conference?

Katrine : It's my fault. It's because I have absolutely no sense of direction!

Pierre : Katrine! There's no point in crying about it. After we save enough money for school,
         let's go back to Mintche University to study again.

Katrine : I'm so sorry.

Pierre : You don't have to keep apologizing. It's not the end of the world. I missed my chance
         to work at the Royal Observatory of Astronomy... And our wedding day won't be anytime
         soon, but... But you're here. And that's all I need.

Katrine : Oh, Pierre! I love you!

Owner : Hey! Kid! Get back to work! If you don't bust your butt, your salary's getting docked!

Reid : I suppose this is also a part of the life-learning experience...

There's nothing more in here, so let's go to Seyfert Garden. It's at GPS(166,18), you must use
Aifish to reach it.

Seyfert Garden(166,18)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Farah : Strict security...

Keele : This is a place meant to be visited by only a few select people.

Now search the door to open it.

Reid : I see... The Seyfert Key must go in here.

Meredy : Let's hurry.

Now let's go inside. You will be in Projection Room.

Keele : Hey, what is this crystal? It can't be just an ordinary light fixture.

Quickie : Kwek...kwekekeke!

Farah : Comeon, Keele. Let's go already.

Now go upstairs and enter the door. Just follow the way down and you will reach a mirror.

Reid : Is something wrong, Meredy?

Meredy : N...no, it is nothing!

Keele : Reid, while you're taking the trial, I'll check out the crystal we saw in the other
        room. It may reveal something.

Reid : Right.

Keele : Meredy, can you help me read the Melnic writings?

Meredy : Just leave to Meredy!

Keele : Reid... Good luck with your trial.

Reid : Thanks! All right then. Farah, I'm going in.

Farah : Reid, promise me you'll come back!

Now you will see Keele and Meredy in Projection Room.

Meredy : Keele... Thank you.

Keele : Meredy... Don't forget. You're not alone.

Now go upstairs and like before the Messenger of Seyfert will appear.

Messenger : I have been waiting.

Reid : Sorry for the wait, but leaping from one world to the next takes time.

Messenger : Are you prepared?

Reid : If not, why would I be here? But... Why are the trials necessary? If this world is
       destroyed, wouldn't it be a problem for you, too?

Messenger : My existence is not here. I have said as such.

Reid : So, you don't care what becomes of Eternia? You don't care much for humans, do you?!

Messenger : Aurora Arte is the power of the gods... It is unrestricted power which, dpending
            on its use, can either destroy or create. I cannot simply give that power.

Reid : I understand. So how many more times do I have to I meet you?

Messenger : that I cannot say. It will depend on you. Now, close your eyes and proceed.

Now go to the middle and you will be little Keele.

??? : Keele! Wake up. Time to eat.

Keele : This body...isn't mine. It's Keele...as a kid!!

Now go downstairs. You will see Keele's parents.

Mother : You overslept again, Keele. You sleep like a baby.

Gizro : Oversleeping is fine, but you have to stop wetting your bed. You're almost seven years
        old!

Keele : Ummm...ahh... Father...Mother...?

Mother : Oh my, he's still half asleep...Gizro, say something.

Gizro : Get your head in gear, Keele. Great people all wake up early. Lamina! Let's eat. This
        looks good!

Lamina : Chow down, boys. ...You seem to be eating well this morning, Keele.

Keele : This is really good. It's really, really good.

Gizro : Hahaha. Boys have to eat a lot to be big and strong.

??? : Keele! Let's go play! Let's play!

Keele : That voice...

Lamina : Keele? Farah and Reid want you to come out and play.

Keele : Okay...!

Lamina : Don't do anything too dangerous. Remember, you're not tough like Reid.

Gizro : Farah is the Elder's daughter. Don't cause trouble, you hear?

Keele : I know!

Outside Keele's house.

Reid : Yo!

Keele : ...Huh? Where's Farah?

Reid : She said something about getting ready and went to Regulus Knoll. We're going to play
       there today.

Keele : Eh? But it's dangerous there and her father said...

Reid : Mine said the same. But Farah is there waiting... I'm going. What about you, crybaby?

Keele : I'm not a crybaby!... Let's go.

Now go down to the next screen to meet Keele at the entrance. When they about to leave, you
will see someone coming.

Norris : Ah, Keele and Reid. Farah isn't with you?

Reid : Um, well...

Keele : Maybe she's at home. Well, we're in a hurry!

You will be in Regulus Knoll now and Farah is waiting there.

Farah : You're laaate!

Keele : Well... Your dad saw us at the village and...

Reid : But we didn't say anything. He doesn't suspect a thing. Well, let's play!

Farah : Today's plan! We go to the cave for a stone-collecting contest!

Reid : Whaaat?! That doesn't sound fun!

Farah : Not regular stones! Shiny sparkling pieces of fallen stars!

Keele : Star fragments?

Reid : No, really?!

Farah : Really! I saw them when I went there with my Dad!

Reid : Pieces of the stars...

Keele : But if I remember, that gate is locked and won't open!

Farah : TA-DA! I snuck into my dad's room and got the key!

Farah will unlock the gate.

Keele : B...but my dad told me that only the Elder is allowed to visit Regulus Knoll...

Farah : It's fine! If the Elder's daughter says it's fine, then it's fine!! All right, let's
        start the contest! Who's gonna be the first one to get the stones and come back?
        Ready...go!

Reid : See ya later Keele!!

Farah : Reid's already left! What about you?

Just run away from any battle you encountered. Go all the way to the left until you reach the
camppoint where you will see Reid.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is how to esacpe from battle :
Just go to the left end or right end. You will see an arrow bar above. Keep going to the
left/right and the bar is filling. If the bar is full, you can escaped.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Reid : Heh. So you managed to get here, too.

Keele : Of course!

Reid : But shouldn't you head back? The going gets rougher the further you go, y'know.

Keele : ...Don't worry about me.

Reid : Hmph. Well, you're on your own. Don't come crying to me.

Keele : I...I can do it, too.

Now just go to the left and downstairs. You will be in Regulus Tomb. Just follow the way until
you saw Reid again.

Keele : Here I am!

Reid : Keele?!

Keele : Now let's see who can find the star fragment first!

Reid : Forget it. I've been looking all over, but I can't find any! The star fragments are
       probably further in. Keele, I bet you're too afraid to go there. It's daaark and
       spoooky!

Keele will satrt looking and he found something shiny on the ground.

Keele : Reid, look! This rock is saprkly!

Reid : Yeah right! Lemmse see! You're right! It's the star fragment! I found it!

Keele : Hey, no fair! I'm the one who found it!

Reid : The winner isn't the one that finds it. It's the one that brings it back first! See ya!

Keele : Reid!! Wait!!

Norris : Stop right there!! Didn't anybody ever tell you you're not supposed to come here?!
         This place is dangerous! There's a mosnter sealed in here! I heard everything from
         Farah... Now, get back to the village! If you ever pull a stunt like this again,
         you're going to get it!

Keele : What about you?

Norris : Just to be on the safe side, I'm going to check around...

Norris go deeper inside and he found the seal has been broken.

Norris : Th...This can't be! The Seal... When did it...?! Wh...what is this?! Aargh!

You will be back in the Trial Room.

Reid : Uncle... Tell me! What happened to Farah's father? What happened at Regulus Knoll after
       we returned home?!

Messenger : The answers lie within you. ...Is that all you learned from the trial?

Reid : Keele... He was raised in a nurturing environment and always excelled in his studies. I
       never stopped to think that he had worries of his own, but...

Messenger : Every human bears pain. If one cannot see the pain in others, then one knows
            nothing.

Reid : Pain... Is there anything I can do to ease the pain of others?

Messenger : One can save others simply by understanding their pain. You have passed the second
            Trial of Seyfert. Receive the Aurora Sword.

Reid : Aurora...Sword.

Messenger : Now, proceed. The final trial awaits.

You have mastered Aurora Sword. It can be activated by pressing X repeatedly while you are
attacking the enemy with Aurora Wall. Although it is a powerful skill, HP will decrease during
its use.

Now go back downstairs to your party.

Farah : You're back!

Reid : Farah...

Farah : What's wrong? Are you hurt?

Reid : Uh, no. ...I'm fine. I learned from Seyfert the second Aurora Arte, the Aurora Sword.

Farah : Wow! That's wonderful!

Reid : Come on. Let's go find Keele and Meredy.

Now go to Projection Room to see Keele and Meredy.

Keele : Reid!! You're back!

Reid : Of course. And now, I have only one trial left.

Meredy : Just one more! Hooray!

Keele : I've made progress here, too! I think I can manage to get this working.

Reid : Wow! You are a genius, Keele!!

Keele : Are you feeling all right? This is no time to be fooling around.

The screen will go black.

Reid : Huh?!

You will see a FMV.

Keele : Our... ...current world?

Farah : So there was Nereid's spirit world, Vatenkeist, before Seyfert's world even existed...

Keele : So Shizel isn't trying to change the world. She's trying to restore it to what it was.
        Restore it to the immaterial, spirit world it once was...

Farah : Now that you mention it, she did say it was 'rebirth', not destruction.

Reid : It doesn't matter which was first. I believe in Seyfert. I believe what he did was
       right. If not, then why do we continue living with all the pain, suffering, and worry?

Farah : I believe in Seyfert, too. ...Because I love this world and its people.

Keele : I have no intention of rushing to any conclusions until we have objective evidence.
        ...That's what I should say, but I also support Seyfert. A world without matter
        wouldn't be any fun to research.

Farah : Oh, listen to you!

Reid : Keele, I know you feel the same way as we do. I believe in you. Well, let's go! What's
       the matter, Meredy?

Meredy : What about...Shizel? Will Shizel...change?

Keele : Huh?

Meredy : Never mind. We go!

Now go outside and go back to Van Eltia.

Reid : Phew! It feels like it's been forever since I last felt the sun.

Farah : It sure is comforting to see the sun...

Keele : We don't have time to dillydally. There's only one trial left. We've got to
        concentrate.

Chat : ...I know it's a bit sudden, but can you all start concentrating now?!

You will see Van Eltia was surrounded by battleships.

Keele : Inferia warships...

Reid : Warships?

Keele : There's no mistaking it.

Meredy : Inferians...coming to greet us?

Farah : ...Let's hope so.

You will be taken to the throne room of Inferia Castle.

King : Celestian dogs! You've finally shown your faces. Where is Ras?!

Farah : Ras... has passed away.

King : WHAT?!

Arende : NO!!

Queen : Put them to death! Don't waste our time! Put these criminals to death immediately!

King : Not only have you committed treason, but you murdered our Seniour Knight, Rassius
       Luine!

Keele : That's not true!

Farah : This is a mistake!

King : Are you not cooperating with the Celestians?! Do you expect us to believe anything you
       say?! Bah! This is pointless... It is merely a matter of time before the Celestians are
       tamed. By now, the Craymel Mage squad led by Captain Roen has undoubtedly landed on
       Celestia. I am looking forward to hearing the news of their retaliation against
       Celestia.

Reid : What?!

Meredy : That will not help!!

Queen : Silence! Traitors are lower than insects!

Farah : I beg of you! Please listen to us!

Keele : Chancellor Zosimos!! I did betray you! But you must have also realized the truth!

King : The whines of thses dogs is boring me. Take them to the dungeon! I shall put you to
       death at first light.

Now you all are in the prison.

Chat : Why?! Why do I have to be executed in atotally strange world for a crime I didn't
       commit?

Meredy : No worry. Meredy will fix this misunderstanding. Hey! Is there anyone out there?

Soldier : You! Shaddup in there!

Reid : Let us out of here! We don't have time to be hanging around!

Soldier : Do you really think that I would listen to your excuses? Are you an idiot?!

Keele : Looks like there's only one guard.

Reid : All right. If that's the case...

Chat : What are you planning to do?

Reid : Let's do this the pirate way. Meredy, call the guard over here one more time.

Meredy : You bet! Heeey! Mister!

Chat : Pirates aren't sneaky like this...

Reid : Shh! ...Here he comes! ...Huh?! Princess Arende?!

Soldier : What's wrong? Princess Arende?! It's safer if I come along...

Arende : I'm perfectly fine. Please stay back. Umm... Well... There's something that I...
         ...simply must ask you about.

Farah : Yes?

Arende : It's about Rassius... Do you know anything about Rassius' final moments?
         Please...tell me anything you know.

Reid : It's a long story... ...is that all right?

Arende : I don't care. I want to hear everything you know about Rassius. Rassius had certainly
         traveled far...

Reid : Perhaps. Unfortunately, that's all we know about Rassius. Whether to believe us about
       the crisis facing Eternia... We leave the decision to you.

Arende will open the prison.

Soldier : Princess Arende! Please don't do this! How will I explain it to the King...?

Arende : My decision has been made. I shall make arrangements to absolve your responsibility.
         Now, leave me!

Soldier : ...Understood, M'lady.

Meredy : Do you believe us?

Arende : Although the others lost contact, Rassius had sent private messages to me. There was
         much that I didn't understand about Balir, the Dark Aurora and such. But now
         everything has become clear.

Farah : Why did Rassius divulge all of this to you...?

Arende : He probably sensed that this would occur. No matter what the situation, Rassius was
         always a knight that was prepared for anything. As long as he was in the castle, I
         felt at ease. He always watched over me... with his gentle kindness. I depended on
         Rassius so much... I suppose I must have looked like a childish princess to him...

Reid : I disagree.

Arende : Huh?

Reid : Rassius believed in you. He sent those messages to you because he believed that you'd
       understand him. In case he died...

Arende : Rassius' dying wish... I shall give you back your weapons.

Keele : Princess Arende?

Arende : How I longed for Rassius... But desiring only his affection, I never did anything for
         him myself... And now I can finally do something for him. I'm thankful that I can
         help.

Farah : ...Thank you.

Now go to Port of Inferia. Your ship will be guarded by a soldier. You will have to fight him
to get back your ship.

Chat : Oh! There she is! My good ol' ship!

Soldier : You?!

Farah : Colud you move out of the way?

Soldier : What impudence, coming from a bunch of criminals!

Keele : It looks like he's not willing to listen.

Reid : It sure doesn't look like it. Oh well... Here we go!

This fight is very easy. You shouldn't find it any trouble.

Meredy : Sorry.

Reid : He'll forgive us someday...

Keele : Now, I wonder where we go for the next trial?

Back at the Deck of Van Eltia.

Reid : I'm counting on you, Seyfert Key!

This time the light pointed above again.

Keele : Did the Seyfert Key point to the skies because we should go to Celestia? Or...the
        Orbus Barrier?!

Farah : No problem! We'll know when we get there.

Reid : Either way, it's bye-bye to Inferia.

Farah : I wonder if Princess Arende is okay.

Keele : She's not a princess anymore. She's a great queen. She'll be just fine.

Meredy : Finally...the last trial! Let's go!

Reid : Chat, it's all yours.

Chat : Aye aye, sir! Then let's return to Aifread's Platform.

Now go back to Celestia first to get skill for Max. Go to Cape Fortress and you will see a
pink Miacis again. This time Max will learned Rage Laser. Now go back to Bridge of Expedition
and choose Barrier Surface. Go to Seyfert Observatory at GPS(20,44).

Seyfert Observatory(20,44)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Reid : I can't believe that a facility so big has been floating here on the Orbus Barrier. How
       come no one ever noticed?

Keele : It's probably manipulating the surrounding Light Craymels to make it appear invisible
        from the surface. The technology is far beyond our comprehension.

Go to the right and search the door.

Reid : I found it! It's a keyhole for the Seyfert Key! It opened.

Farah : Well, let's go then!

Now use the elevator at far right. Choose Seyfert Observation Room.

Farah : Look! ...Look at the view!

Keele : Look at this device!

Reid : This must be the observatory for the Orbus Barrier...

Farah : It's so beautiful. It's hard to believe I'm...here!

Reid : Yeah. Who would have ever thought we'd end up here.

Farah : Hey... That ring beyond the horizon... Is it...

Reid : It must be the Seyfert Ring. I doubt many people have seen it from this close...

Meredy : The Dark Matter is beyond the Ring.

Reid : Right. Shizel is there. That's where we need to go.

Keele : Damn...

Reid : Did you break it?

Keele : I can't do anything with it... It's extremely complex. It's not going to be easy to
        figure out this device.

Farah : I bet it's a machine that can do something amazing... Too bad we can't use it.

Keele : I'm not giving up yet. I'll get it to work by the time Reid completes the trial!

Meredy : Keele can do it. Meredy know.

Reid : All right. Good luck, Keele.

Keele : Leave it to me.

Meredy : Meredy will help!

Farah : Then I'll go to the Trial Gate with Reid.

Now use the elevator again and you will be in Trial Gate.

Reid : I'll see you later. What's the matter?

Farah : Nothing! But...

Reid : But?

Farah : I was just thinking... I didn't notice until now how big you've gotten.

Reid : Are you telling me I'm getting fat? That can't be. I haven't had a decent meal in ages!

Farah : Yeah...you're right. Be careful...okay?

Reid : I will.

Now go inside to the Trial Gate.

Farah : ... Please be safe...

Now you will see Reid inside the Trial Gate.

Reid : I'm here.

Messenger : The final Trial will be the most cruel. Your life is not assured. Will you
            continue?

Reid : ...Of course. The Aurora Arte is Eternia's last hope. That's why Ras sacrificed his
       life. Princess Arende has put all her trust in us too. There's no turning back now!

Messenger : Obtaining the Divine Aurora will not be easy. No one will blame you if you do not
            face the Trial.

Reid : I don't care! I want to live. And I want those that I love to live! That's why...that's
       why I'm going to do what I can. That's all.

Messenger : ...It is well. Become a drifting soul within Vatenkeist and embrace the truth. In
            doing so, you will find your answer. Now go. I will show you the way.

??? : Meredy! Meredy!

Reid : What? Meredy is with Keele.

This time you will be a little Meredy.

Meredy : Ah, um...mmm.

??? : Meredy, wake up! Something is wrong. Balir went to see what is happening.

Meredy : Meredy...? Then you are...

??? : Shizel! You must run now! Birial has betrayed us!

Shizel : Balir? What are you saying?

Balir : This is no joke! Someone has set me up to look like I've plotted to assassinate the
        ruler.

Shizel : Tell them you were framed.

Balir : It's too late. They'll use treason as an excuse to kill us all. We have no time!
        Meredy!

Meredy : What happens to Meredy?

Balir : Do not fear. I'll protect you and Shizel.

Shizel : Birial... That underhanded weasel...

Balir : I have no Elara, but I am a Celestian at heart. I will face them head on.

Shizel : Balir... You're outnumbered.

Balir : I know the odds don't favor me. But this is my plan... I will be the decoy. Take
        Meredy and run! Hyades should be somewhere in the village, so search for him. He will
        give you aid.

Shizel : I cannot! Did you not promise, Balir, that our destinies would be forever together?

Balir : My beloved! To realize our dreams, you too must not perish here. Nor must Meredy be
        caught up in this...

Shizel : ...I understand. Balir, until you return, I swear to work tirelessly to make our
         dreams a reality.

Balir : Damn it! They're here... Shizel! Meredy! Live! For our dreams! For the fate of the
        world!

Shizel : ...We must escape from Luishka. Meredy, hurry now! Meredy, quickly!

Meredy : Balir not come with us? No! Meredy stay with Balir. Meredy won't go!

Shizel : Meredy... Farewells are not the end. His thoughts will be with you for eternity. All
         right, let us go.

Now go downstairs and enter the door to main hall. You will have to fight 4 Birial Guards.
Just escape this fight and go inside again.

Shizel : This way is dangerous. Let's look for another way.

Go back to the bedroom and go outside through the window. Just go to the right and go down the
chimney. You will fight 4 Birial Guards again. This time you can't run away. Defeat them all.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shizel Spell
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Circle -> Spark Wave
Down + Circle -> Cure
Left/Right + Circle -> Grave
Up + Circle -> Prism Sword
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Shizel : It's me! Galenos!! Can you hear me?! ...We're in trouble. Birial has betrayed us.
         Please... We need shelter... We need a place to hide. ...Thank you. Meredy. We're
         going to go see Galenos in Imen. The journey will be long, but you have to survive.
         ...Understand?

Now enter the left door and you will have to fight 4 Birial Guards again. Defeat them and
Shizel will locked the door. Search the control beside the glass cage to open the hole. Now
get inside it and escape through the hole. You will be in a sewer and you have to fight 4
Birial Guards again. Go to the far left and you will be outside the house. Go down to the next
screen and you will have to fight another 4 Birial Guards again. You will see Hyades at the
entrance.

Meredy : Uncle!

Shizel : Oh...Hyades! We are in trouble. Balir is...

Hyades : I know.

Shizel : Then please! Call for reinforcements.

??? : You still don't get it, do you?!

Shizel : You are...?! Birial?! What is the meaning of this?

Birial : Hyades is an excellent man. Once the traitor Balir is dead, we will rule this land.

Shizel : Are you betraying us, Hyades?!

Birial : Grab them!

You will be in Main Hall again.

Birial : Balir! Come out if you do not wish harm to come to Shizel and Meredy!

Meredy/Shizel : Balir!

Birial : ...Such good girls.

Balir : Please... ...Let them go.

Birial : Hmm? Finally...the time has come to unmask the man who bullied the throne and reveal
         the evil-doer beneath. What's wrong? You have many regrets for someone who is always
         prattling on about the material world, no?

shizel : Don't worry about me. Balir! Run!

Balir : I cannot.

Shizel : You filth! Unhand me!

Birial : KILL...KILL...! Kill them all!

Balir will protect Shizel from gunshots.

Shizel : BALIR?! Balir! Balir! Oh, please!

Balir : ...Shi...zel. what you see with your eyes... ...is not...all...

Shizel : Shhh... Say no more, Balir. I...understand!

Balir : Our ideal world... is one that lies beyond what you can touch...

Shizel : Ohhh, Balir!

Guard : Prepare to fire! FIRE!

The guards will shot Shizel.

Shizel : Aaaaaaugh...!

??? : Entrust thy heart to mine...

You will see a Dark Aurora anove Shizel and it destroy all the village. Now you will be back
at Trial Gate.

Messenger : You have survived the Trial.

Reid : It's...over?

Messenger : Yes. You have overcome the third Trial of Seyfert. I hereby acknowledge you as the
            wielder of the Divine Aurora. Receive the Aurora Wave.

Reid : Tell me! What is Aurora Arte! Why do you show me all these cruel pasts?!

Messenger : The Divine Aurora is the skill born when Human and Craymel become one. But
            Craymels will only listen to a pure soul. Therefore, the wielder of Divine Aurora
            must have the power of understanding to grasp the true form of existence.

Reid : The power of understanding... In this trial, I understood Shizel. I felt her pain. I
       now know that we both follow our own form of justice. ...Does that mean I should stop
       fighting?

Messenger : What will be, will be. Believe in what you see and proceed along the path you
            choose. Even if that means... ...turning your back on Seyfert.

Reid : Really? As the Messenger of Seyfert, are you sure you should be teaching me this?

Messenger : Those are the teachings of Seyfert.

Reid : ...I understand. I believe you.

Messenger : Then go forth. And Reid... protect those you love.

Reid : Ah! Wait!!

You will learned Aurora Wave. It cannot be used under normal circumstances, but it is the only
skill that can neutralize the Dark Aurora. It can be performed by holding down X, Circle, and
Square when the enemy unleashes the Dark Aurora.

Now go back to where Farah is.

Farah : Reid... Reid? Reid!! Are you okay?!

Reid : ...Yeah. Sorry... ...I'm okay.

Farah : So how did it go?

Reid : It's all over. I've been granted the skills of the Divine Aurora.

Farah : That's great! That's absolutely wonderful! I mean it, Reid!

Reid : I did what I could do...that's all.

Farah : Reid... You're my hero.

Reid : S...stop teasing me!

Farah : No, I really mean it. Look at you. You're giving it your all to... ...to save the
        world!

Reid : The world... All I really want to do... ...is to protect someone important to me.

Farah : ...Huh? What was that?!

Reid : I don't know. Let's go see Keele!

Now use the elevator and choose Seyfert Observation Room.

Reid : Keele?!

Meredy : Keele amazing! Machine is moving!

Farah : So what does it do?

Keele : I don't know. But it's a frighteningly large system.

Reid : Hmm?

Keele : What's this hole for...? Reid, the Seyfert Key!

Reid : I get it. It's a keyhole.

Now use the Seyfert Key at the machine.

Reid : What's going on?!

Keele : L...look! The Seyfert Ring!

You will see another nice FMV.

Keele : This was a control device for the Seyfert Ring...

Farah : Now that the Ring is broken, we can enter the dark matter where Shizel is, right?

Reid : Right. Finally...the last battle!

Meredy : Shizel...

Reid : Hey... There's something I want to ask you. Suppose we take a direct hit with the Dark
       Aurora...

Keele : You mean if we were to be swallowed by the dark shadow?

Reid : ...Yeah. do we have any chance of surviving if that were to happen?

Keele : Not a chance! It's destructive powers are enormous! You saw what happened at Balir's
        Castle. Not even Ras...

Reid : Yeah, I figured...

Keele : Wait. It may be possible for someone who is predisposed to darkness to absorb the
        destructive force... But there's no way that someone like that... What did you see
        during the trial?

Meredy : Meredy ready!

Reid : Right! Let's go back to the Van Eltia!

Now go back to your ship, Van Eltia and head to Seyfert Ring.

Reid : There it is! The dark matter...

Keele : What a strange object... It looks like it's made of pure energy with no real physical
        form.

Farah : Shizel...is in there?

Keele : ...Probably.

Reid : All right, fire the Craymel Cannon!!

Chat : Aye aye, sir!

Now you will see Galenos and Ayla in front of Craymel Cannon.

Galenos : Oh my! Isn't that the Van Eltia I see heading toward the dark matter?

Ayla : Everyone...positions! Ready the Craymel Cannon!

Man : But... Isn't it still in the testing stage?

Ayla : Doesn't matter. This may be the only chance we get. It is Shileska's duty to support
       Reid and his friends. Prepare to fire the Craymel Cannon!

You will see a long FMV about both Craymel Cannon shot to the Dark Matter.

Save your game, it's the end of Disc 2.

==========
DISC THREE
==========

You will start as a child in the event of your village destruction. Now go to the right screen
and then down to the next screen. Talk to Farah in front of the windmill.

Reid : Farah?

Farah : I killed everyone. It was my fault. It's all because I was selfish and wanted the star
        fragments.

Reid : Farah?!

Farah : It was me. Nothing to do with Reid and Keele. I forced them to go because I wanted the
        star fragments.

Reid : Farah, answer me!

Farah : Father, mother... the whole village. I killed them. I KILLED THEM!!!

Reid : Farah!

You will be in a bed and Farah is beside you. It's just a dream.

Farah : Reid, Reid!

Reid : Farah, are you all right?

Farah : Me? What about you? ...You must have hit your head really hard.

Reid : Huh? Wait... Where am I? What happened..? The ship flipped, and then...

Farah : We were rescued by Shileska! They even fixed the Van Eltia! We were all waiting for
        you to wake up!

Reid : ...Oh, I see.

Farah : Were you just half asleep? Don't scare me like that!

Reid : Farah... There's nothing... Nothing I can do for you... ...but I'll always be there for
       you.

Farah : I think we should have you checked once more.

Reid : I'm fine! Let's go see the others.

Farah : All right. We should go see Max and thank him.

Now go downstairs and see Keele and Galenos.

Reid : Keele!

Galenos : Ah! You have awoken!

Farah : Yes. And now, we'd like to thank Max for helping us out.

Galenos : That is a good idea.

Reid : Hey, Keele!

Keele : Uh...what?

Farah : Let's go see Max.

Keele : Sure...

Galenos : Keele, take care of Meredy for me.

Farah : Did something happen to Meredy?

Keele : No, it's nothing. Let's go see Max.

Now go to the right to Max's office.

Quickie : Kweeek, kweee, kweee.

Max : Hi, Dede! You're such a goood girl! Bwa ha ha ha!

Reid : I don't think it's the right time to thank him...

Farah : Don't be silly. He did more for you than any of us! You're our representative.

Meredy : Baiba! Reid is awake!

Max : Yeah!

Reid : Ummm...we caused so much... ...trouble for you...and... we are very grateful and...
       ...offer our thanks to you!

Max : Yeah? Good to hear!

Man : Miacis to our hearts! We have an emergency! The Craymel Cannon ay Balir Castle has been
      overrun by the Inferia Army!!

Farah : The Inferia Army...in Celestia?!

Keele : Princess Arende must have been unsuccessful at convincing the King.

Reid : I'll bet Roen is the commander of the army.

Man : I do not know his name... They spoke in a language I couldn't understand.

Max : What about Ayla?

Man : She has also been taken hostage...

Max : Yeah! Let's go!

Reid : No objections here!

Now try to go outside, Galenos will enter the room.

Galenos : I will accompany you as well. Ras asked me to deliver a message to Roen.

Farah : A message from Ras? ...Okay. Let's hurry to Balir Castle!

Now go back to Van Eltia and go to the engine room. Talk to Chat to make him join you. Now go
to Balir Castle.

Balir Castle
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Go to the right and then go above. You will see a lot of dead soldiers.

Farah : Why are monsters here?

Reid : The top level! Hurry!

Now climb the ladder and go to where Roen is.

Hyades : Hee hee hee. DIE!

Roen : Damn you, Balir!!

Reid : Hyades!! You returned from the dead again?!

Hyades : I will return as many times as it takes... Hee hee hee. UNTIL YOU'RE ALL DEAD!

Roen : Damn...looks like I'm being pinched. Come, end it! I'd rather die by your hands than
       those of that Celestian savage, Balir!!!

Keele : That's not Balir.

Roen : What? Then who is it?

Farah : That's your enemy... ...and ours!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss : Hyades
HP : 128000
EXP : 30000
Gald : 0
Attack : 380 (Ground Shake, Charge Laser, Thunder Blade, Earth Shaker)
Elemental Attack : Shadow
Defense : 800
Intelligence : 73
Strong : Water, Wind, Fire, Earth, Ice, Lightning, Light, Shadow, Elemental, Time

Strategy : This enemy is not as hard as it look. If you have already skill Omega Demon Chaos,
           use it all the time. Make him cornered and attack him continuously, so he doen't
           have chance to attack you.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hyades : Meredy...prepare... Someday you too... will taste this agony I feel...

Meredy : Uncle Hyades...

Roen : Hm, hmph... What's going on here? Explain it clearly. How I deal with you shall depend
       on what you say.

Galenos : Whew...! Well, well... ...You are Roen I presume?

Roen : What?

Galenos : Ras asked me to give you this message... Ultus Veigh is entrusted to you.

Roen : My Orz Earring isn't working.

Roen : Translate. What is this old man saying?

Reid : Ultus Veigh is entrusted to you. It was the final message to you from Ras.

Roen : It can't be... Ras, you... Is it true? Did Ras really say that?!

Galenos : My memory is not wrong. Each word is as he spoke it.

Roen : ...I see.

Ayla : Boss, I apologize. We were caught off guard.

Max : Yeah... Are you okay?

Ayla : Yes.

Max : That's good.

Galenos : Will you help? The cooperation of both Inferia and Celestia is needed.

Back at Shileska's Hideout.

Man : They're here, sir!

Keele : Chancellor Zosimos?!

Roen : Galenos needed knowledge from Inferia, so I requested his cooperation as a
       representative of the Craymel Engineers.

Zosimos : ...It's hard to believe that this civilization and technology belong to Celestia.

Galenos : My name is Galenos. Let us work together. We do not have much time.

Zosimos : I never in a million years thought we would cooperate with the Celestians.
          But...there is no choice, as this is an order from the King. The King of Inferia has
          granted you full authority over the negotiations with Celestia. do you understand
          the weight of your responsibility?

Roen : Leave it to me!

Zosimos : I'm looking forward to performing genuine research.

Ayla : As I read the agreement aloud, leaders of both parties please shake hands for approval.
       The parties of Celestia and Inferia hereby pledge to cooperate in order to defend
       Eternia from the threat of Shizel.

Max : Yeah! Let's do it! Let...uh...

Ayla : ...Action speak for itself?

Max : That's it!!

Roen : Ooof!

Ayla : Galenos and Keele will explain the final battle plans against Shizel.

Galenos : To be honest, I have yet to establish any objective plans, but... ...With
          technological cooperation between Celestia and Inferia, I am certain that we can
          realize an unimaginable potential.

Roen : And what would that be?

Galenos : A Fringe Cannon.

Keele : Let me explain the specifics. I would like Shileska's engineers to rebuild the Craymel
        Cannon at Balir Castle and convert it to allow the Inferian Craymel Cages to be
        connected. I would also like to ask the Craymel Mages of Inferia to allocate the
        Craymels in their Craymel Cages to the Craymel Cannon.

Zosimos : You fool! Do you seriously intend to mix the energy of different worlds? They're
          certain to reject one another!

Keele : If we use a special Lens, we can mix them together without repulsion. This is called a
        Fringe. We will Fringe the Craymels of Inferia and Celestia together.

Zosimos : Fringe...

Keele : The effect will generate an intense Craymel flux.

Galenos : That is the concept behind the Fringe Cannon. It will be ten times more powerful
          than the Craymel Cannon of Van Eltia.

Roen : ...I understand. We will go back to Inferia to collect Craymel Cages. Let's move!

Guard : Yes, sir!

Ayla : Our duty is to rebuild the Craymel Cannon. Let's hurry!

Guard : Miacis to our hearts!

Galenos : Now all we can do is pray that we have enough Ribavius Ore, the raw material that is
          necessary to make the special Lens.

Keele : Ribavius Ore?

Galenos : It's a spherical, milky-white crystal with silver particles that sparkle on the
          surface. It's quite a rare stone. We've searched all over Celestia, but we've yet to
          find it...

Zosimos : There's no record of such a stone... ...At least not in Inferia.

Meredy : A sparkling light? Like a star?

Now talk to Max to make him join you, after that talk to Farah.

Reid : Farah, let's go.

Farah : Uh...okay.

Now go upstairs.

Reid : Farah, what's wrong?

Farah : ...There's a place I want to go. I think I have an idea where the Ribavius Ore might
        be. Can we go there?

Keele : What?! Are you certain?

Farah : I asked Galenos about it... ...I'm pretty sure I'm not mistaken.

Reid : So where can we find the ore?

Farah : Inferia.

Keele : Inferia?! But Chancellor Zosimos said there is no record of its existence there... Did
        you really see it? When did you see it?

Farah : If we go, you'll understand. Will you come with me?

Meredy : You bat! Meredy go with Farah!

Reid : All right, then! Let's get back to the Van Eltia!

Now go back to your ship and head to Bridge of Expedition. Go to Inferia and you will have
some conversation.

Keele : Say...Farah, isn't it about time you tell us where you saw the Ribavius Ore?

Farah : ...A place close to Rasheans.

Reid : Huh? Did you see it in our village?

Farah : No... ...Regulus Knoll.

Keele : At Regulus Knoll? ...Really?

Now go to Regulus Knoll at GPS(17,118) near Regulus Dojo and Rasheans.

Enemies : Rooter, Ranger, Duelist, Beast Ogre, Jin, Flying Pulp, Medusa, Buffalo, Red Pudding,

Items : Mythril Plate, Elixir, Mythril Mesh, Shadow Crystal, Volt Crystal, Mystic Symbol,
        Flame Spear, Mythril Bracelet, Diamond Fist
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Reid : Let me try something I learned from Max...

Reid will barge in and the gate will be opened.

Reid : It's open.

Now go all the way to the left until you reach camp site.

Keele : Why don't we rest?

Farah : ...Yeah. we still have a ways to go.

Keele : Are we really going to find Ribavius Ore in a place like this?

Farah : Do you remember? What we saw here long ago...?

Reid : ... That stone...back then?

Keele : Back then...stone... Long ago? Long ago... We were... ...I remember!

Meredy : What are you talking about? Tell Meredy.

Keele : Nothing important. All right, let's keep moving!

Farah : Wait! Meredy has a right to know. ...and I want you all to listen to what I have to
        say...

Keele : One day, we came here to play, although it was off limits. As a result, we unsealed
        the monsters that attacked Rasheans. That's the past the three of us share. That's it.

Meredy : Attacked...the village? Like...Imen?

Keele : We were just seven years old then! We couldn't help it!! No one knew about the Seal.

Farah : I knew!

Keele : ...What... do you mean?

Farah : I knew that was a dangerous place, but I made Reid and Keele go ...because I wanted a
        star fragment. I was selfish. Because of my selfishness...everyone was killed! That's
        why my sin is much, much heavier than Reid's or Keele's... I'm so sorry...

Meredy : Farah...?

Reid : Farah. That's enough. It's okay. Farah, even if your sins were greater than ours,
       haven't you made up for it? You've suffered enough. We left the tragedy in our past. We
       know it's a mistake we made as kids. But Frah, your wounds... They never healed... It's
       been ten years!! And now, you've exposed your pain... ...to save the world!! You've
       paid enough already.

Farah : Reid...

Keele : We always enjoyed your games, Farah. That's not a lie. In good times and bad times,
        you were there, Farah. You were our kind leader... We've got no time to waste. If we
        don't hurry, it'll be the end of the world.

Meredy : You bet! C'mon, Farah, let's go!

Farah : ...Yeah!

Now just follow the way to the left until you reach Regulus Tomb. Search the writing on the
wall and Meredy will tried to translate it.

Meredy : Um... Uh...

Reid : Can you read it?

Meredy : Sorry... It is very old, and there's a big crack. ...Meredy cannot read it.

Now go down two screens and get Mythril Plate from the chest. Go above to the next screen.

Meredy : Hweel! Pretty!

Keele : Hmm... It definitely fits the description of Ribavius Ore that Galenos specified...
        But the ones here seem to be of low purity.

Reid : Let's go in further.

You will see something strange with Meredy.

Quickie : Kweekeee! Kwee!

Meredy : Something... Something escaped this place...

Farah : You're right. The monster that attacked Rasheans came from here...

Meredy : Monster? No, it is something worse. ...Something much scarier, and stronger!

Keele : Y...you're giving me the shivers!

Farah : But it's gone, right? It should be safe...

Reid : Meredy?

Meredy : ...Huh?

Get Elixir from the chest and go down.

Undine : Wait!

Undine will come out from the Craymel Cage.

Keele : Undine!

Meredy : Hello...!

Undine : Be careful if you're going to use Craymel Artes inside the cave.

Reid : Why?

Undine : Because Ribavius Ore can amplify or decrease the effects of Craymels. You must
         consider its effects during battle.

Keele : I see... So I suppose we can't rely simply on Craymel Artes alone...

Farah : Thank you for the advice, Undine. Let's be careful, everyone!

Green means TP is being recharged and Red means TP is being drained. There are four roads in
here: left(where you came from), right, above and below. Go to the below first and get Mythril
Mesh and Shadow Crystal from the chests. Go to the right screen and get Volt Crystal and
Mystic Symbol from the chests. Go back to the first screen with four roads. This time take the
road above. Just follow the way to get Flame Spear from the chest. Now go back to the first
screen with four roads. This time go to the right two screens and go to the right cave first,
Get Mythril Bracelet from the chest and push the rock. Go above and follow the way to the
left. Push the rock again and going back three screens. This time enter the left cave. Just
follow the way to the place where you drop the second rock. Get Diamond Fist from the chest
above and take the far left below path. Just follow the way and you will reach some strange
place. Rem will appear again in front of you.

Rem : Do you know what lies ahead? What you see before you is the seal Seyfert created!

Farah : So then beyond here...

Keele : ...is where Nereid, the God of Destruction, was sealed?

Reid : Regardless of what's in there, I'm going forward! There's no stopping us!

Rem : Then, you must first defeat me. Now, show me your strength.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss : Rem
HP : 100000
EXP : 40960
Gald : 0
Attack : 500 (Ray, Shining Flare, Prism Sword)
Elemental Attack : Light
Defense : 700
Intelligence : 125
Strong : Light, Water, Wind, Fire, Earth, Ice, Lighting
Weak : Shadow
Rewards : Reflect Ring(100%), Rune Bottle(100%)

Strategy : The floating ball near Rem is very annoying. You can't destroy it so avoid it the
           best you can. Rem is easy to defeat. Just use Omega Demon Chaos all the time and
           use Dark Force to make a major damage on him.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rem : ...I see. I feel your determination in your strength. I will help you.

Choose Keel's or Meredy's Craymel Cage.

Keele : I can't believe it! The Light Craymel is going to cooperate with us!

Rem : Even I do not know what lies ahead. Proceed with caution.

Now go inside the sealed place.

Keele : It's... It's the Ribavius Crystals! It's brilliance... It's like no other! It's 100%
pure. No mistake about it. Now we can complete the Fringe Cannon!

You have found Ribavius Crystal.

Reid : So, this is...the place.

Farah : ...The place where the God of Destruction, Nereid, was sealed for 2000 years. No
        wonder it was off limits...

Reid : Keele, how do you suppose the seal broke? We never came this far... I don't think we
       could've broken the seal.

Keele : The cause? I don't know, but I can say this much. Seyfert's seal couldn't be broken
        just by a bunch of kids.

Reid : Did you hear that?

Farah : ...Yeah. I'm relieved.

Keele : We've got all we need! No need to hang around now. Let's go back.

Quickie : Kwek, kwek, Kweekeee!!

Farah : Meredy? What's wrong?

Keele : Hey, Meredy! What's the matter?!

Meredy : This feeling... Like before...! Help...Meredy...!

Reid : Do you... sense something?

Meredy : Damn you...Seyfert!!

Meredy : (Talking in Melnics language.)

Farah : Snap out of it, Meredy! I can't... I can't understand what you're saying!

Rem will come out from the Craymel Cage.

Rem : NO!

Keele : This darkness...!

Rem : You must leave this place!

Meredy : (Talking in Melnics language.)

Keele : We have to get Meredy out of here! Hurry!

Now you'll be in Farah's house.

Quickie : Kwek...

Reid : So you're saying... Nereid nearly took control of Meredy because she has the power of
       the Dark Aurora?

Keele : That's right. Well...Meredy IS Shizel's daughter, and according to Galenos, Shizel
        studied Meredy's body to learn about the Aurora Arte.

Reid : Human experimentation... What kind of mother would...?

Farah : Hey, wait a minute. Those that possess the Dark Aurora are susceptible to Nereid's
        control, right?

Keele : Y...yes. that's the conclusion according to Galenos.

Farah : So can't we say the same thing about Shizel?

Reid : You're saying Shizel was also under Nereid's control? It's possible...

Farah : Right?! Meredy's mother would NEVER do such horrible things to her own daughter!

Keele : Perhaps. But don't speak to Meredy about this. At the moment, words of encouragement
        are more likely to be hurtful... What?

Farah : Keele...you're much kinder than I thought.

Reid : Really. I never thought I'd hear you say stuff like that...

Keele : Well... Surprise!

Farah : Meredy?

Reid : Since when?

Meredy : ...Thank you.

Keele : How are you feeling?

Meredy : Meredy is fine. No matter who Shizel is now, Meredy's feelings will not change.
         Meredy want to stop the Grand Fall. And for that reason... Meredy feels the same as
         you all.

Farah : Meredy...

Keele : ...Looks like you're as undutiful a child as I am.

Farah : Keele!

Keele : Don't forget, there's still a chance. We'll know when we meet Shizel, whether she's a
        monster controlled by Nereid, or Meredy's...mother.

Meredy : You bet.

Reid : Okay, let's go!

Keele : Yeah. We need to get the Ribavius Ore to Galenos as soon as possible.

Reid : All right. Let's get back on the ship and head for Balir's Castle courtyard.

Now go back to your ship and head to Bridge of Expedition. Go to Balir Castle in Celestia.

Go to Balir's Castle Courtyard.

Meredy : Hweel! It's big!

Ayla : I'm glad that you are well!

Reid : Same to you, Ayla. By the way, we brought this back...

Zosimos : This is...!

Galenos : Ribavius Ore!

Reid : We found it in Inferia. If this isn't enough, we can go back for more.

Zosimos : What? You found it in Inferia?! Hmmm...

Galenos : Well done. Ayla! Process the ore into a lens and install on the cannon.

Ayla : Understood. Good work everyone. By morning, we should be ready to fire the Fringe
       Cannon. Please rest while we prepare for the battle.

Farah : Thank you. That's exactly what we'll do.

Galenos : I'm sorry to disturb you, but could I ask you to take me to the Seyfert Observatory?
          I'm in a bit of a rush to investigate something. Do not worry about the Fringe
          Cannon. Leave it to Zosimos and Ayla. Roen is working hard as well.

Reid : Okay.

If you talk to Zosimos, he will mention that Ribavius Ore is a good material to make a sword.
Sagura is the only one you can find in Celestia who can make a sword. So let's go to Imen
first.

Now go to Sagura's place. You can find Zosimos there.

Reid : Zosimos! You're here already!

Zosimos : Not a bad workshop at all. We are making good use of it.

Sagura : Us? The only one who works around here is me.

Zosimos : Come now, don't be like that. The fate of the world is at stake here.

Reid : Are you making weapons?

Zosimos : Yes. We thought we would utilize the Craymel amplification effect of the Ribavius to
          create the sword. I'm certain that we will create an incredible sword!

Now go in and out the city for five times and enter Sagura's place again.

Reid : Are you okay?!

Sagura : Master Zosimos! This has to be it!!

Zosimos : Yes, this is it! It is finally complete!!

Sagura : Here. This is for you. This sword is the ultimate combination of Celestian and
         Inferian technology.

Zosimos : Let's name it the Last Fencer.

You will received Last Fencer. Now go to Seyfert Observatory at Orbus Barrier.

Galenos : Thank you. I will be heading to the Observation Room.

Chat : Let's get going.

Reid : I'm coming.

Inside the engine room.

Chat : Well, let's go!

Keele : Sorry, but can you give me a little time? I want to help Galenos.

Reid : Sure.

Keele : I'll be back later.

Meredy : Meredy cannot help, but Meredy want to go!

Farah : Reid, what should we do?

Reid : Ummm... Why don't we make sure the ship is in good working order? Chat, let's take the
       ship out for a spin.

Caht : Good idea. All right, let's set sail.

Now you will see Fringe Cannon at Balir Castle.

Roen : Quite impressive.

Ayla : Yes, truly. But it would have been impossible with Shileska alone. Inferia's help is
       what made all the difference.

Roen : I have something I want to ask. I hear Celestia is a place of war. Have you considered
       becoming the leader of Shileska? In essence, aren't you already the leader?

Ayla : No, I could never be... Boss is the reason I can lead the men with poise.

Roen : ...You like him, don't you? Forgive my bluntness. Surrounded by bureaucrats, I've grown
       tired of small talk.

Ayla : ...the Miacis that the Boss loves so dearly was raised by his long lost wife. For as
       long as I live, I wish to be with this man of incorrigible passion, ...as his loyal
       Sub-Commander.

Roen : ...You are very strong.

Back at the engine room of Van Eltia.

Chat : Huh? Ahhh!! Wh...what's this?! Animal fur! What is the meaning of this?! My precious
       Craymel Engine has been dirtied! I'll deal with that little vermin, Quickie. ...Meredy
       can be a very irresponsible master! At the very least, she should understand these
       machines are extremely delicate and need to be kept away from wild animals.

Quickie : Kuweeky.

Chat : It can't be... Ahh!! There's fur here too!! This can't be!! I thought it went to the
       observation deck with Meredy?! It can't be...

Quickie : Kuku...kuweeeky!

Chat : Aaah! W...w...wh...why are you in here?!

Quickie : Kweeeky, kweeeky, kweeeky...!

Chat : Waaah!! Someone save me! My machines... A...err...um...ahh... Be a good little guy and
       go outside. There's nothing here for you. Meredy is out there!

Quickie : Ku, ku, kuweeky!!

Chat : Eeek!! I told you to stop!! You're shedding all over!! Please... Stop!

Quickie : Kuweeky, kuweeky, kuweeky!!

Chat : I'm begging you. Please...! Waaaa...waaa!!

Now you will see Keele and Galenos in observation room.

Keele : It can't be!

Galenos : Is the analysis complete?

Keele : Yes...and it doesn't look good. At most, it's three Suom to the Grand Fall's critical
        point. Maybe even shorter.

Galenos : As I thought, quite a situation... If the critical point is passed, the gravity of
          the two worlds will pull with greater force and accelerate speed to such that...

Keele : That's right! Even if we defeat Shizel, there's no way to stop the Grand Fall! Damn!!

Galenos : Is there no other way?

Keele : We've exhausted every option. ...It's useless. Galenos, you should know that better
        than anyone.

Meredy : Have you finished your...research?

Galenos : We've just concluded. I'm going to rest up a little bit.

Now Keele and Meredy will look at the Seyfert Ring.

Keele : ...It's quiet, isn't it?

Meredy : You bet. ...Beautiful.

Keele : I just wish that all of this... ...the Grand Fall, Nereid, all of it... I wish it were
        just a dream.

Meredy : It's not like Keele to talk like that.

Keele : I really feel that way. If it were just a dream... ...nobody would get hurt, right?

Meredy : If all a dream...Meredy never meet everyone. I would not be able to talk with Keele
         like this... I'm glad it's not a dream. Even though it's very sad, Meredy happy about
         now. Everyone alive...

Keele : Meredy... You're really incredible.

Meredy : You say compliment?

Keele : Yeah. Is that strange?

Meredy : Strange! Yes! Because I think Keele is always angry. That is usual and so today is
         very strange.

Keele : Am I really like that? Angry all the time?

Meredy : Yes, but it is okay. I like it when Keele is strange!! Compliment makes me happy!!

Now you will see Farah and Reid at Observation Room of Van Eltia.

Farah : How long have you known?

Reid : ...Hmm?

Farah : What I did ten years ago... You knew, didn't you?

Reid : ...Yeah. I learned it during the Trials of Seyfert.

Farah : Oh... So you did know.

Farah will punch Reid.

Reid : Ow!

Farah : You kept it a secret? Why didn't you tell me?

Reid : Farah, you haven't changed much, have you?

Farah : I haven't. it's because of you.

Reid : Huh?

Farah : When I laugh, or get really mad, or even occasionally cry... The only reason I can be
        the person I am... ...is because of you, Reid. I'm who I am today because you were
        always there... ...looking after me.

Reid : Protect those you love... That was what Ras said. He said that the Aurora Arte exists
       for that purpose. If it's to protect people you love, the will of the people is
       limitless. That's why I'm here. I'm here... Undaunted, and with no regret or
       hesitation...

Farah : ...Those you love, huh? I want to protect you, Reid. I can't do it alone, but there
        are the others. With friends by our side, there's nothing to be afraid of, right?

Reid : Yeah, you're right. I'm starting to think maybe we can do it.

Farah : Of course! Yeah! No problem!!

Next you will see Max on the Deck. After that you will see all the six Craymels. Then you will
see a FMV. Now go to the Seyfert Ring. You will see Fringe Cannon is being readied at Balir
Castle.

Ayla : Celestian Craymel!

Shileska Guard : Miacis to our hearts!

Ayla : Inferian Craymel!

Inferia Guard : Roger!

Ayla : Ribavius Lens!

Engineer : Ready to fire!

Back at Control Bridge.

Reid : There it is! The dark matter!!

Chat : Charging Craymel Energy into the bow Craymel Cannon!

You will see FMV about both Cannon shot to the dark matter and this time it destroyed.

Ayla : Did it work?

Roen : All right!

Zosimos : Wait...! What is that?

Back at Control Bridge.

Chat : Something new has appeared.

Farah : It looks...strange.

Keele : That must be its true form. It finally shed its disguise.

Reid : We got her now. Shizel's in there...

Keele : I don't know what it is, but there's got to be something in there...

Farah : Only way to find out is to climb the tower!

Meredy : Let's go!

Reid : We shouldn't! This is probably a place where a noble person lives quietly. Besides,
       it's locked tight! There's no way we'll get in!

The door will be opened and your party will get inside the tower.

Reid : I guess I'm hearing things...

Now go inside the door.

Second Floor
------------

Go to the middle and you will see the order of the ball you must light up. So light up the
ball in order like you saw before. The ball you must light up will be random, so you have to
try it yourself. Write the light ball in paper or something else to make this puzzle is easy.
If you succeed, the teleporter will active. Use it to go above.

-----------
Third Floor
-----------

First you must use Freeze Ring(Press L1) at the thing where you can see the wind blows. Then
use Sorcerer's Ring(press R1) to light up the torches. You will see a platform appear. Go to
the platform and use Freeze Ring again(Press L1) to make the stairs appear. Now use the
teleporter to go above.

Now use the teleporter to go above. When you search the door, you will hear voices again.

??? : Go back.

Keele : What's wrong?

Reid : ...Nothing. ...But something tells me that we're upsetting the tower keeper...

Keele : Since when did you become so timid?

Reid : D...don't get me wrong! I'm not scared!

Keele : I didn't say you are.

-----------
Fifth Floor
-----------

In this room, you must move the invisible tile to all 3 lights(red, green, blue). Now go to
the visible tile. If you move the visible tile, the invisible one will move too. You should
try this yourself. Now use the teleporter to go above.

-----------
Sixth Floor
-----------

There are a lot of platforms here with three different colors: red, green. Blue. You must
light up all the light bulbs.

      BLUE        GREEN

Now just go to the teleporter at the other side. You will be in a room with many treasure
chests and you will see someone down from above.

??? : Humans have their own place to live. If you fail to realize your rank and encroach upon
      this place, you will be mercilessly punished.

Farah : ...Who are you?!

Keele : You're neither human nor Greater Craymel. What are you?

??? : I am known as Valkyrie.

Valkyrie : I advise you not to ask any further questions.

Reid : So was it you? Were you the one I kept hearing...in my head?

Keele : ...Reid! You...heard her?

Valkyrie : I see... You heard my warning.

Reid : Yeah...but I thought it was just my imagination...

Valkyrie : How would you like to fight me?

Reid : Huh?

Valkyrie : I am a little curious about you. If you manage to meet my expectation, I will give
           you a reward.

Farah : Reid, you don't have to do this...

Reid : Of course I'll do it!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss : Valkyrie
HP : 32000

Attack : 250 (Wind Blade, Guard Impact, Fireball, Valkria Strike, Sonic Blade, Valkrie
         Protector)
Defense : 1000
Intelligence : 100
Strong : All

Strategy : You will really hate her Guard Impact. If you attack him when she guard, you will
           be counterattacked with Valkria Strike. It's best to attack her from far away. The
           good skill to use is Sonic Chaos. Don't get cornered; you will be attack
           continuously if this happen.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Valkyrie : I see... There was something to be learned from your erratic fighting technique. I
           shall thank you. I shall give you a reward as promised. Take this, a sword beyond
           human comprehension, the S.D.

reid : H...how is this a sword?

Valkyrie : I wove the flow of your power and made an invisible key with it. When you go to the
           appropriate place, the seal of the sword will be broken, and it will be yours.

Reid : An invisible key...?

Keele : I'm completely lost.

Farah : Since it doesn't seem to be anything harmful, let's not worry about it.

Now get all the treasure chests. The items are Savory, Water Shard, Tuna Gel, Earth Shard,
Golden Armor, Wind Shard, Beam Shield, Sage, 17595 Gald, Crystal Rod, Rune Bottle, Fire Shard,

Katz : Hello!

Reid : Wh...what are they?!

Keele : Meredy! Who are they?!

Meredy : Um...probably...

Farah : Probably...what?

Meredy : The legendary tribe known as the Katz.

Reid : The Katz?

Katz : Hey! Tell me a story! Tell me! Story! Story!

Reid : Wh...what do you want?!

Katz : Tell me a story.

Farah : Sure! I've got one! I'll tell you a story!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Farah : The jail was narrow and long, and had no ceiling. It was as if we were at the bottom
        of a well.

Katz : Ahhh.

Farah : And just as I started thinking things weren't right, all of a sudden... Water started
        pouring in from above! Keele tried to climb the wall, but he slipped and fell. Reid,
        on the other hand, had already given up. So, I knew I had to do something... ...and do
        it quick!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Katz : Please... Please tell me a story! Tell me as story!

Reid : Yeah...yeah.

Katz : Tell me!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Keele : In other words, the theory on Grobule Distortion of Light Craymels does not hold
        because of the tendency toward dynamic motion.

Katz : Ahhh.

Keele : Focular's Theory on the existence of group rather than individual knowledge can be
        convincingly applied to Craymels, which are believed to be a type of elementary
        particle.

Katz : Ahhh.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Farah : As soon as I heard the rumbling noise, everything became clear to me. Hyades was
        attacking the Fringe Cannon! But when we reached the top, we discovered another
        surprise. We saw none other than Captain Roen fighting Hyades! It seems that Roen saw
        the Fringe Cannon and assumed it was built to attack Inferia.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Reid : Right then, I told her she shouldn't do that. But when it comes to Farah, the advice of
       others falls on deaf ears. You knew what was going to happen next the minute she
       started to climb the tree. A swarm of killer bees poured out from their nest!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Keele : You might think that in measuring spatial displacement while varying a type of Craymel
        being stimulated, the formula would thus be derived despite of minor differences,
        correct?

Katz : Ahhh.

Keele : But things aren't quite that simple. The very act of measuring a Craymel's location
        can create a secondary Doctark Effect.

Katz : Ahhh.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Reid : Whew! I can't believe I talked all night long.

Keele : I've come to one realization from contact with the Katz... As fundamental as it seems,
        listening to others is something that we truly lack in our daily lives.

Farah : After talking myself out... I feel great! Say, Meredy. Wasn't one of the Seven
        Treasures of Celestia a paradise where non-humans live?

Meredy : You bet. Meredy think so.

Farah : I wonder... ...if this is the place?

Meredy : Probably!

Farah : Yeah! This must be the place!

Now enter Katz Village again. You will get a funny scene with the Katz pretending to be your
party. Go to the first house. Search the pot near the ladder to get a Lens. Now go above to
the next screen. Go inside the pink house. Search the pot beside the sink to get a Lens.

Sekundes : I will fight you anytime you wish. But it does not need to be now. ...But if you
           waste any more of my time, I may just crush you where you stand!

Reid : B...by all means, please enter the Cage!

Choose Keele's or Meredy's Craymel Cage. Whoever you choose will earned the title of Craymel
Master.

Reid : Whew! I can't believe we got his cooperation without having to fight!

Keele : Indeed. If we had fought, there's no way we could have beaten him... ...Not against
        the Greater Time Craymel.

Farah : It seems like each Greater Craymel has their own view of the world.

You can choose to fight him or not. Sekundes is the strongest of all the Craymels. Believe me,
it's better not to fight him.

Shizel in her throne.

Meredy : Shizel?!

Reid : In the name of Seyfert, I have come to stop the Grand Fall!!

Shizel : Heh heh heh. Too late. The Dark Aurora shall now reach it's completion with Nereid's
         Fibrill.

Keele : What?!

Shizel : Hmm...a bearer of Fibrill. The one you call Reid... Can you not feel it? The powers
         of Eternia's Craymels are flowing into me!

Shizel will absorb the darkness above her.

Keele : ...I understand now. The Grand Fall's true purpose!

Meredy : What...do you mean?

Keele : The destructive power of the Aurora Arte is in direct proportion to the amount of
        Craymel absorbed.

Reid : You mean she's absorbing the power of the Craymels around the world?

Meredy : Why complete Dark Fibrill to destroy Eternia?!

Shizel : I shall become...the master, defeat Seyfert, and become the creator of a new world!

Reid : Defeat Seyfert?!

Shizel : Once the Dark Aurora is completed, that too shall be easy. The events 2000 years back
         shall be reversed.

Keele : Are you...Nereid?

Shizel : What if I am?

Meredy : Where is Shizel?!

Shizel : Shizel? ...A struggling soul trapped within me. One shamed by her own actions... May
         that be her?

Meredy : That Shizel's body! Give it back!!

Shizel : Impossible. It is her hatred for this material world that allows us to unite under
         one strong will. Vatenkeist is the world as it should truly be. Without material
         matter, jealousy and hatred will cease to exist. Greed that causes suffering and the
         grief of losing a loved one will be no more...

You will see all the dead people and after that the ground will shaking.

Reid : The Orbus is moving?!

You will see both Inferia and Celestia are shaking too.

Shizel : Heh heh heh... It seems that it has begun.

Reid : Meredy!

Meredy : Shizel is dead. The one that is here... is our ENEMY!

Shizel will cast a spell on Meredy.

Meredy : Baiba!

Reid : Meredy!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss : Shizel
HP : 120000
EXP : 50000
Attack : (Eternal Finality, Fireball, Prism Sword, Summon Demon, Indignation)
Rewards : Elixir(100%), All-Divide(100%)

Strategy : Shizel will cast spells all the time. You must be careful with her spells because
           it can do a major damage, especially Eternal Finality. This spell will decrease all
           your HP to 1. Try to attack her continuously so she can't cast a spell.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Shizel : ...Ugh. The bug is resisting. ...An ugly bug. What...is this? What does she desire?

Reid : Nereid... Don't you understand Shizel's feelings? If you don't...you can't win.

Shizel : What?!

Reid : Like you said, Seyfert's world is imperfect. There are many who live believing in their
       own justice. Because of that, endless strife, sorrow, and chaos will always rule. But!
       That's why people can change. By exploring their differences, they learn and change. If
       people can change, the world can change too... We don't need the Grand Fall!

Shizel : I see. So that...is the Divine Aurora. Mwahaha...mwahahaha!! Worthless!

Reid : What?!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Boss : Nereid
HP : 300000
Attack : (Eternal Finality, Dark Force, Lightning, Soul Shot, Nihilistic Night, Holy Lance,
         Fear Flare, Fireball, Grave, Wind Blade, Ice Needles, Summon Pluto, Absolute, Thunder
         Blade)

Strategy : Nereid will cast spells all the time. You must be careful with the spells because
           it can do a major damage.. Try to attack Nereid continuously so he doesn't have a
           chance to cast a spell. Warning! If Nereid's HP reaches zero, he will use the final
           attack. Press O+X+Square continuously to counter this attack. If you didn't do it,
           it will be game over.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Reid : We've won. ...We beat Nereid.

The darkness will come out from Shizel's body and Shizel Castle will be disappeared.

Keele : We seem to have slipped out of Vatenkeist...

Farah : What is this...?

Keele : The core of Seyfert Ring.

Reid : To think this place had always existed...

Meredy : Shizel!

You can feel the ground is still shaking.

Farah : What's going on? The Grand Fall isn't stopping...

Reid : Not only that... It's gaining speed!

Keele : ...We weren't in time. It's beyond the critical point. At this distance, the force of
        gravity will only draw the two worlds closer. No one can stop it now...

Farah : No, it can't be... Can't we do anything?!

Keele : ...Unfortunately...no.

Reid : ...Keele. if I destroy the core with my Aurora Arte, the Seyfert Ring will dissolve...
       right?

Keele : W...what are you saying?! The Seyfert Ring is the lock which keeps Celestia nad
        Inferia bound together. If we destroy it...

Farah : ...What would happen?

Keele : Even if it all went well, Celestia nad Inferia would have no spatial relation.

Reid : In other words! A complete division?!

Farah : And if...it doesn't go well?

Keele : Both would be annihilated in a second. Far worse than the Grand Fall.

Reid : If it all goes well... ...Can we stop the destruction?

Keele : ...Yes. but that theory is meaningless! Using the Aurora Arte given to you by Seyfert
        to destroy his own creation...

Meredy : Can it...be done?

Keele : Meredy?!

Meredy : Let's Fringe the Aurora Artes.

Reid : With the Aurora...that's it! If we fringe the Divine and the Dark Aurora, ...we can
       generate a devastating force!

Keele : No! Meredy, your body can't handle it!

Farah : That's right! If you do that, you'll destroy your soul... ...and become like Shizel!!

Meredy : I know. But, but...I don't mind.

Reid : ...Meredy.

Meredy : I decided. When time came, I would use this power. I decided long before. Meredy
         loves everyone. The world where everyone lives... I will save it.

You will see a FMV about the destruction of Eternia.

Meredy : We have to hurry! We have come very far. Do not waste it!!

Keele : Why did you have to be like this?! Lets' do it. Meredy's not gonna change her mind.

Meredy : Keele...

Keele : Meredy... Are you sure?

Meredy : You bet!

Farah : Thank you...Meredy.

Reid : We're not giving up. We're gonna live!! All of you... Stay alive!!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Meredy : Thank you, Keele.

Keele : D...don't be stupid! I should be thanking you.

Meredy : Hmm? Really? ...But, Meredy is happy now... Thank you. Take care...of Quickie.

Quickie : Kweeeky!

Keele will hug Meredy.

Keele : Don't say that! We'll always be together. ...No matter what!

Meredy : ...Thank you.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Reid : Farah, help me! Hold me up.

Farah : O...okay. What's wrong?

Reid : I can't wait to get home... ...to stuff myself with your omelettes!

Farah : Leave it to me!

Reid : All right! Let's do it, Farah! We're going back! Together!!

Farah : Yeah! No problem!

You will see Reid use Divine Aurora and Meredy use Dark Aurora on Seyfert Ring.

Meredy : Nnngggah!

Reid : Meredy?!

Keele will hold Meredy and behind them you will see Shizel.

Shizel : ...Stand back.

Meredy : Baiba!

Keele : Shizel!

Shizel : Meredy, do not fear. Farewells are not the end. We will be together for all eternity.

Shizel will replace Meredy using Dark Aurora on Seyfert Ring.

Meredy : ...Ah.

Shizel : Meredy...

You will see a FMV about the destruction of Seyfert Ring and Reid & Farah falls down toward
Inferia. After that you will see the credits. After it finished, you will see Farah and Reid
in Town of Academia, Mintche. Farah will be in Student Store and after that she ran toward the
port to see Reid.

Farah : Thanks for waiting!

Reid : ...What's that? Some baggage you got there.

Farah : They're souvenirs... I didn't think it would take this much space.

Reid : You're gonna sink the ship!

Farah : No problem! This much should be okay. I hope we can meet them.

Reid : ...Of course.

Farah : ...Yeah. Yeah, we will!

You will see Chat approaching Farah and Reid.

Chat : Do you have everything you need? It looks to be a long trip. We should double-check...
       Ahem. I think we ready to go! Let us set sail!!

Farah : Chat, you look happy.

Reid : She'll be meeting her friend. Her cute, little furry friend.

Chat : Wh...wh...who would be friends with such wild animals?! And I'm certainly not excited!

Farah : Okay, okay. There's no need to get all bent out of shape.

Reid : All right! Let's head for Celestia!!

Farah : Yeah!

Chat : Aye aye, sir!

You will see the last FMV about Van Eltia leaving Mintche Port to go to Celestia. Celestia and
Inferia now seperated. You can save your game after the credits finished.
