Typed in by SKID ROW. Edited by PARAISTE.

THIS IS HOW TO USE GAMES SUCH AS FUTURE WARS AND OPERATION STEALTH, AND
HOPEFULLY, FUTURE RELEASES.


We recommend that you make safety copies of your original disks and use
these when you are playing.

Note: Before you start playing, it is advisable to make sure that you
have a blank formatted disk at hand so that you can save games part way
through.

HOW THE GAME WORKS
You can move the figure that represents you around the screen at will.
All you have to do is make him move is to move the cursor and press the
LEFT mouse button.  The hero will then walk towards the spot you have
chosen.

The figure will stop if an obstacle en route blocks his way.  Choose
another point that will allow him to get round the obstacle.

THE ACTIONS MENU
You can carry out numerous and varied actions, by using the hero, even
though the actions menu is very simple.

The actions menu is displayed if you press the RIGHT mouse button.  Move
the menu bar until it highlights the action you desire and press the
mouse button.

The actions activated by the LEFT button are as follows:

EXAMINE: Lets you get more information about an object in your vicinity.
When the cursor changes to a '+', point to the object you want to
examine and press the LEFT mouse button.

TAKE: Use this command when you want to pick up an object which you
think may be useful.  When the cursor changes to a '+', point to the
object you want to pick up and press the LEFT mouse button.

INVENTORY: Shows you the objects you hold.  Press on either mouse button
to quit the inventory.

USE: Lets you use an object you possess, to carry out an action on any
object or person in the vicinity.  When the cursor changes to a '+',
choose the object in the list then click on the object or person you
want to use it on.

ACT: Lets you carry out an action on any object or person.  When the
cursor changes to a '+', point to the object or person to be affected
and press the LEFT mouse button.

SPEAK: You use this to speak to the people you will meet.  When the
cursor changes to a '+', point to the person you wish to speak to and
press the LEFT mouse button.

The actions activated by the RIGHT button are as follows:

EXAMINE: Lets you find out more about an object you possess.  Move the
menu bar until it highlights the chosen object then press the LEFT
mouse button.

another object you have.  Move the menu bar until it highlights the
chosen object then press the LEFT button.

THE USER MENU
This menu provides additional functions.  The menu is displayed when
you press on both buttons at the same time.

PAUSE: Stops the game until you press one of the mouse buttons.

RESTART: Allows you to restart the game from the beginning.

DISK DRIVE: Use this to tell the program which disk drive you want
to use for savings games.

LOAD A GAME: If you wish to rename a saved game, when the program
asks you, insert the disk containing your saved games.  The list of
games saved on a disk will be displayed.  Move the cursor to the name
of the game to be loaded and confirm.

SAVE A GAME: To save a game, when the program asks you, insert your
saved game disk.  A list of all the games already on the disk will be
displayed.  Choose an empty space and confirm.  Type in the text box
the name you wish the game to be saved under, and confirm.  If there
is no free space, either use a new disk or save it over an existing
game.

NOTE: As long as your hero is alive, you can save the game.  We
recommend that you use this option frequently, especially if facing
a dangerous situation.  In the course of certain animation sequences,
you cannot guide your figure or save the game.  But don't worry,
nothing really dangerous can happen to you during these sequences,
or if it does, it is already too late to take any action.

HINTS
o Examine all the objects in your vicinity.
o Get close to objects to examine them.  No one is infallible and our
  hero cannot see certain details unless he examines them closely.
o Read the comments that are displayed carefully.  They may contain
  clues which may be important later.
o Pick up the greatest number of objects possible.
o Think about all the possible different uses of the objects you possess.
o Act on everything you see.
o Speak to as many people as possible, they may give you a lead.
o Make a copy immediately you sense danger.

If, after all this, you get stuck at a certain point in the game, try
and remember if you have forgotten an object, or if you did not do
something earlier on...

HARD DISK INSTALLATION
o Check that the number of bytes available on the hard disk is larger
  than that used by the game.
o Create a new directory and copy the contents of each disk into it.

LOADING FROM THE HARD DISK
o Double click on the hard disk icon.
o Double click on the icon of the directory that contains the game.
o Double click on the icon DELPHINE.PRG.
o The game will load and run automatically.
