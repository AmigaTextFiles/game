CARRIER COMMAND.
     Whilst in the Walrus arming section, select nine Harbanger
surface to surface missiles and put them in the AAV. Select the
Avatar Chemical Laser and place it over the missiles. Then select
the pod you want (ACCB, Virus Bomb,Fuel) and place it in the AAv.
Then when you have launched the AAv look at it's weapons and you
will find you have BOTH missiles and laser! On returning to the
carrier any missiles you have left will be added to the ship's
stores.Carry on doing this and hundreds of missiles can be yours.

     For those of you who find Carrier Command just a little bit
too taxing, there is a great in-built Cheat routine. This is how
you get into it: go into the pause mode and type:
 "GROW OLD ALONG WITH ME" (include the spaces).
You should now see the message 'Cheat mode active' displayed.

     Pressing the + key on the numeric pad protects your Mantas
and AAVs from missile attacks. The - key can be used to turn this
off. With the cheat mode active, pressing the following keys in
sequence: 'Help', Q, S, Control, Alternate, gives you a little
message. Pressing the 9 key on the numeric pad displays the
current difficulty level, and the keys 6 and 8 have some other
effect. Press key 7 and time will  fly by saving both boredom and
patience.

Also, at the start of the game, press F10,F9,F8 ect, until you
reach F1. Now press Backspace, the screen will show:

ENEMY CARRIER DESTROYED!

Remaining islands can be captured for maximum points.
Do you want to continue ?

Now click on "NO" and the congratulatory screen will appear.

takes all the fun out of it dosn't it ?

Lastly this little tip.

Returning to the title screen, press the + and - keys to
view all the objects within the game.
