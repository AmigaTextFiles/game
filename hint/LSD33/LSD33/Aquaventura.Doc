   ONE LINE GREET TO PAZZA,VAG,DRAGONLADY,TALLY,METTY,JOEL,ROSS & WILS (TP).
     WITH THANKS TO DINASCOUSEjnr FOR SUPPLYING THE INSTRUCTIONS.

YOUR OBJECTIVE ON EACH LEVEL IS TO DESTROY THE SOLAR PANELS THAT PROTECT THE
SPURCIAN PYRAMID,THEN ATTACK THE PYRAMID AND DEFEAT ITS GUARDIAN TO GAIN
ACCESS TO THE AQUATUNNEL AND THE NEXT CONFRONTATION.

ON EACH LEVEL YOU ENCOUNTER THE ENEMY GENERATORS THAT CREATE SPURCIAN ATTACK
FORCES.THE GENERATORS LAUNCH ALIEN CRAFT AND THEN SINK INTO THE WATER FOR
PROTECTION.HOWEVER THEY QUICKLY REAPPEAR TO LAUNCH FURTHER CRAFT.GENERATORS
HAVE ONLY ONE LIFE.ONCE DESTROYED THEY STAY DESTROYED.THE MORE YOU DESTROY
THE MORE YOU REDUCE THE ALIEN THREAT ON EACH LEVEL.
WHILE FENDING OFF ALIEN CRAFT YOU ALSO SHOULD ATTACK THEIR SOLAR PANELS.
HAVING DESTROYED THESE,YOU MUST THEN DESTROY THE PYRAMID TO EVOKE ITS 
GUARDIAN.
HOWEVER, THE PYRAMID IS DEFENDED BY FOUR FORCEFIELD GENERATORS WHICH CHARGE
IT WITH SUFFICIENT ELECTRICAL POWER TO COUNTER ANY ATTACK YOU MAY MAKE ON IT.
THESE GENERATORS MAY ONLY BE DESTROYED ONCE THEIR OWN PROTECTION SYSTEMS,
THE SOLAR PANELS,HAVE BEEN ANNIHILATED.DEFEAT THE GUARDIAN TO GAIN ACCESS
TO THE AQUATUNNEL AND THE NEXT BASE.THE TUNNEL IS PATROLLED BY ENEMY FORCES
WHICH MUST BE DESTROYED IF YOU ARE TO GET THROUGH.

AT THE FAR END OF THE ACCESS TUNNEL LIES THE ENEMY WEAPONS DEPOT.
HERE YOU ARE AWARDED AN ADDITIONAL WEAPON,AND YOU ALSO HAVE YOUR CRAFT'S 
ENERGY REPLENISHED AND MISSILES RESTOCKED,READY FOR THE NEXT LEVEL.
