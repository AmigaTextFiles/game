INTRO

'Allo! 'Allo! Reading this book and using this software can change
your life, like computers changed mine! Before computers, I was
learning the life of a vet, how to inject vaccine and clean cow's foot.
Then I did a big mistake, I bought me some old fashion computer. It
was fantastic. My programming passion grew. By the time I
graduate, I did not practice as vet at all ! And here I am, comfortably
sat with my keyboard, writing an intro for Easy AMOS!

So, I warn you, my friend, you may discover a passion for
programming Lying inside you, and this passion has a lot more
chance to grow with a computer like Amiga and a program like Easy
AMOS. What you have in your hand is the result of ten years
learning. Ten years spent with ugly technical manuals, ugly tools,
ugly syntax, ugly programming. But now I have put in this product
all I wish I had before. With Easy AMOS, I expect you to become a
programmer in a few weeks. Truly. Easy AMOS is more than a
learning tool. It is a full language with 350 commands, full help
features, examples, programs, musics, graphics, datas. We have
crammed in your discs hundreds of hours of entertainment.

So stop reading all this intro. Easy AMOS is your entry ticket to the
private club of programmers. Hope to see your name in a commercial
game very soon.

Francois Lionet
Easy AMOS programmer


This Guide Book is the one I needed when I began programming,
back in 1966. I could have let Easy AMOS lead me by the hand for
abitofinstantsatisfaction. IcouldhaveflickedthroughtheGlossary
and begun to understand what all the jargon meant. But in those
days computer manuals were less friendly than rat poison and not
as effective. If you th nk I've devoted too much space in this book
on the needs of absolute beginners and indulging in cartoons, you're
probably right. Enjoy it anyway, because I reckon Easy AMOS is a
wonderful system. If only it had been around when I was you.

Mel Croucher
Easy AMOS book author


I cut my computing teeth in 1982 at the age of 22, on an Atari 400.
There was very little entertainment software then, so I spent a lot of
time trying to program. The manuals and books I bought weren't
very good, but I kept at it and found programming an absolute thrill.
I got a genuine kick out of writing games and practical programs
over the following year or two, and my hobby introduced me to
many new friends.

The Easy AMOS team members have brought together their
combined experiences to produce the ideal package which would
have excited, stimulated and encouraged them to learn to program.
I am sure you will get a lot out of Easy AMOS. You will have a lot
of fun and feel a tremendous sense of achievement as you work your
way through this manual. Take it at your own pace and I can
guarantee that you will amaze yourself! Happy programming.

Chris Payne,
Managing Director. Europress Software


I spent most of my teens learning to program on an antique 48K
Atari-400. Countless hours were spent trying to harness my
computer's power, but only short snippets from magazines and
highly technical manuals were available to me. Perseverance paid
off, and after years of studying and lots of head scratching I managed
to master the beast. This taught me a great deal, but it would have
been a much easier journey if a detailed manual had been available
to explain everything. So knowing how difficult it can be to learn
such concepts, please believe me when I tell you you've got it easy!
The Amiga 500 may be the most powerful home computer to date,
but all the hassle of controlling it is handled by Easy AMOS.

Take your time over learning Easy AMOS. Some concepts will take
longer to understand than others, but eventually all the pieces will
fit into place and you will become a competent programmer. Who
knows, you may be the next Fransois for Europress!

Richard Vanner
Projects Manager, Europress Software




Before testing Easy AMOS, I had only ever used my Amiga for playing games.
I was a total beginner when it came to programming and an ideal candidate
to be a guinea pig. I was told that the package would live up to its name and
be easy. Not only was it easy and completely painless, it was also FUN! If I
can understand Easy AMOS I'm sure that anyone can! As I was testing the
Chapters out of order I tried to make sure that each stood on its own, but if you
do find yourself struggling over a particular Chapter don't worry, you can
always go on to other Chapters and come back to it later. Whatever you do,
make sure you try the "Sound" Chapter: it was amazing~ when I found out that
my computer could talk to me! And even more amazing when I reached the
end. I felt I understood how to program! There can never have been an easier
way to learn. I hope you enjoy using Easy AMOS as much as I en joyed testing
it.

			  Chapter 1


			 INTRODUCTION

"The words of Amos:
proclaim free-will
and publish!"
   (Old Testament,
       Amos 4.5)

INTRODUCTION


Hello. By the time you finish this book, you will have
become an accomplished computer programmer. In
fact, before you finish this Chapter you'll be a
programmer of some sort! You are going to make your
Amiga obey all of your desires and fancies and perform
incredible tasks. You are going to create original
entertainment and produce useful programs. And best
of all, we reckon that you'll enjoy it.

To tell the truth, computer programming is dead easy,
but the Amiga has never been the friendliest machine to
control. Programming the Amiga used to be plagued by
mysterious processes and boring routines, but then
something wonderful happened in the world of Amiga
programming. We named it AMOS.

AMOS has already been used by tens of thousands of
experts and beginners to create superb programs, and
one day you may want to explore its wonders too. But
now something even better has happened. Easy AMOS!

Easy AMOS is a special version of its big brother AMOS.
It doesn't matter if you know a bit about programming
already, and it doesn't matter if you are an absolute
beginner. The only limit to what you can create with
Easy AMOS is your own imagination, because Easy
AMOS saves you the time and trouble of having to use
out of date ways of programming. The hard work has
already been done for you, and Easy AMOS is packed
full of expert ideas and brilliant routines all ready to use,
either by typing in simple instructions on your keyboard
or by selecting from choices on your screen. So get ready
for this step-by-step guide to the easiest and most
enjoyable way of programming that your Amiga has
been longing for.

PLEASE READ THIS CHAPTER BEFORE USING
YOUR EASY AMOS DISCS. It will only take a few
minutes, and you'll be glad you took this advice.

			-=- 2 -=-

Computer programs
-----------------
A computer program is simply ac ollection of instructions
telling a computer to perform a list of tasks. Programs
used to be stored on punched cards, which worked very
slowly and couldn't be changed after use. Then magnetic
tape came along, which was still slow, but at least it was
cheap and you could record over it. Modern computers,
like your Amiga, use magnetic discs housed in thin
wafers of plastic. These are fast, reliable and tough, and
they can hold more programs than a mile of tape or a
cartload of punched cards. But there are still a few
hazards to watch out for.


Care of Disks
-------------
Because disc programs are stored magnetically, you
must keep them clear of any magnetic objects, like
loudspeakers, television sets and microwave ovens.
Leaving plastic discs exposed to sun and heat at home or
in the back window of a car can warp them beyond use.
Contact with sticky fingers, spilled liquids or puppy
hairs is not a good idea either. Apart from physical
damage to a disc, you can loose whole chunks of work by
doing something silly like erasing a program by mistake,
or suffering a power cut. So for all these reasons, we
want you to take the information and examples that
make up EasyAMOS, and make a copy for your personal
use. Then the original Easy AMOS discs can be put away
somewhere safe without any risk of accidental damage.


The drive light
---------------
In the plastic casing of your Amiga keyboard are two
small light panels. The main one is marked "POWER",-
and it is illuminated all the time that the computer is
switched on. The other one is an information light
marked "DRIVE u, and it lights up whenever your internal
disc drive is in use. NEVER remove a disc when this
drive light is illuminated, or you may damage your disc!
"Hard driveU systems will have an extra drive light,
which is illuminated when data is saving or loading
from the hard disc.


			-=- 3 -=-

Easy AMOS discs
---------------
Everything you need to create brilliant programs is on
the two discs that come with this guide book. What's
more, they contain a load of instant examples ready for
you to learn from, adapt and use.


Create your disks now!
----------------------
Before you go any further, we want you to do some
work! Make sure that your Amiga is connected up in the
usual way, and get ready to prepare all the Easy AMOS
information for your personal use.

Your Amiga comes with a built-in disc drive, where you
insert the program discs that communicate with the
machine. This drive is called the "internal drive" or "Disc
Floppy number 0". We can abbreviate this to "DF0".

You may be lucky enough to have extra disc drives
plugged into your computer, and there can be one or
more "floppy" drives, which take exactly the same sort of
3.5-inch square discs as the built-in drive, or you may
have a "hard" drive as well, which has a permanent
large-memory disc inside. If you're a hard drive user,
and you prefer to install Easy AMOS straight onto that
drive, miss out the next section of this Chapter and skip
straight to the "HARD DRIVE USERS" heading.


Floppy drive users
------------------
How to install Easy AMOS using the Amiga's internal
floppy disc drive, "DF0"

The instructions you are about to be given are incredibly
simple. The stages of the installation process will appear
on your screen automatically, and all you have to do is
follow them step by step.

You will need three blank discs on which to make your
copy of Easy AMOS, so make sure you have them ready
now. If you really want to plan ahead, have an extra disc
ready to use for experimenting with your own programs.
You'll be writing home-grown programs sooner than
you think! That makes four blank discs in all.

			-=- 4 -=-


"Flops are part
of life's menu,
and I ain t missed
a course yet

(Rosalind Russell,
        1957)

Take out the pair of discs in the Easy AMOS package,
labelled:

"Easy AMOS Master Disc 1" and

"Easy AMOS Master Disc 2".

There are also four labels ready to stick on your blank
discs, marked:

"Easy AMOS Programs"

"Easy AMOS Examples"

"Easy AMOS Tutorial"

"My Programs"

If your Amiga is switched on, make sure the drive light
is not illuminated and take out any disc that may be in
the drive. Switch off the computer and count to ten
slowly. This gives the computer time to clear out its
memory and forget any bad habits that might be lurking
there. Make sure that the "mouse" is plugged into its
socket at the back of the machine, and get to wo'rk.

Take the disc marked "Easy AMOS Master Disc 1" and
look at the small tab in its top right-hand corner. Slid'e
this tab downwards so that it covers the small square
hole. Your disc is now "write-enabled", and this will
allow you to make a special personalised copy of Easy
AMOS with your own name appearing on your television
screen. Slide the disc into the internal floppy disc drive.
Switch on your Amiga, and after a few clicks and whirs
our Welcome Screen will appear on your TV screen
looking like this:

			-=- 5 -=-




After ten seconds, or as soon as you press a mouse
button or a keyboard key, a new screen will appear
headed with these words:

              Easy AMOS Work Disc Creator

       Before proceeding, you need to select the
         nationality of your Amiga's keyboard.

Did you know that the Amiga has all sorts of different
keyboard layouts, depending on the country where it is
marketed? Easy AMOS does, and now he wants to
know which nationality keyboard you are using, so he
can talk with the right accent! Slide your mouse around

			-=- 6 -=-

a bit, and identify the mouse pointer as it moves across
the screen. Look at the selection of nationality panels on
this screen page, and use the mouse to click on the one
that suits your machine. For example, if you have an
English Amiga, click on the [English] panel.

Now Easy AMOS is satisfied with his accent, he'd like to
get to know you better and asks you to type in your
name. Two name boxes are provided on your screen,
one for your First name and one for your Surname. If
you have remembered to "write-enable" your Master
disc, type in your first name and press the large left-
handed arrow key (the [Return] key), then do the same
for your surname. You have just "written" your name
onto the disc electronically, and after a few seconds the
next screen appears.

Your screen will now ask you to "write-protect" your
Master discs, so make sure that the plastic tabs in the
disc'stopright-handcornerareslidupwardssothatyou
can see through the small square hole. This makes sure
that you can't harm the information on your discs by
mistake.

When you're happy that everything is in order, move
the pointer over the [Okl panel, and click a mouse
button.


Your registration number
------------------------
Your own unique Registration Number will appear on
the screen, and we want you to copy this number onto
your Registration card, onto your three Easy AMOS
blank disc labels, and into the space provided at the front
ofthisbook. Doitnow! Please.

Click on [Ok] and you'll be taken to a screen with three
control panels, containing the words:

[Install on floppy]

[Install on hard drive]

[EXIT]
			-=- 7 -=-


Move the mouse pointer over the panel that says
[INSTALL ON FLOPPY], and click one of the mouse
buttons. This kicks off the automatic installation process
and changes to a new screen with a reminder that you'll
need three extra blank discs. When you've read the
introduction words and you are happy to continue,
move the mouse pointer over the little [Ok!] panel and
click a mouse button to progress to the next screen page.

You have probably realised by now that all the
instructions you need to install Easy AMOS are provided
on your TV screen, but keep reading anyway, just to
make sure.

Easy AMOS should now be on screen with an offer you
can't refuse, "Let me install your software."

			-=- 8 -=-

Making your Easy AMOS Programs disc
-----------------------------------
Insert a blank disc, and click on the left mouse button. If
your disc is not blank you'll be asked to confirm with
another [Ok!], or click on [Abort] to select another disc.
This disc will now be "formatted", and given the name
"Easy AMOS:".

From now on, simply follow the instructions as they
appear on your screen. There is an information line at
the bottom of the screen which reports on exactly what
wonders are being transferred onto your discs, and just
above that there is a black Knowledge Transfusion Bar.
As soon as Easy AMOS's knowledge begins to flow from
disc to disc, you can watch its progress as the bar
changes colours.

You'll be told when to remove the blank disc and insert
"Master Disc 1" into the drive. Your Amiga will now
automatically put Easy AMOS knowledge into its own
"memory", and when this has been done you are asked
to insert your newly formatted disc.

Now the screen will ask you to repeat the knowledge-
transfer process from the Master Disc into the Amiga,
then onto your new disc. When the last section of the red
line turns to blue, you'll be greeted by a celebration
screen telling you that your new disc is now ready.

Remove your brand new disc copy, and stick the "Easy
AMOS Programs" label onto it. NOW WRITE PROTECT
IT! When you're happy, click on the [Ok!] panel again.

If you think you've made a mistake at any time during
this installation process, there's nothing to worry about.
At the bottom of the screen is a message saying that if
you press the [ESC] key, which is at the top left-hand
corner of your Amiga's keyboard, you can stop the
installation process and start all over again. OK? Good.
It's very unlikely that anything can go wrong if you
follow the instructions on the screen.


			-=- 9 -=-


Now that your first new disc is full of Easy AMOS
delights, put it to one side along with your Master Disc
1, so as not to mix them up with "Master Disc 2" and your
other blank discs.


Making your EASY AMOS Examples disk
-----------------------------------
AMOS should be back on screen, asking you to insert
your next blank disc for formatting, so do just that and
click the left mouse button. This disc will be given the
name "Easy EXAMPLES:". When prompted, insert
"MasterDisc2", followed by your second newly formattcd
disc. You have to swap over these discs twice more. The
screen will tell you when.

You'll soon be greeted with a message saying that your
Easy AMOS Examples disc is ready. Remove it from the
disc drive, WRITE PROTECT IT NOW, and stick on the
label printed "Easy AMOS Examples". Click on [Ok!] to
proceed.


Making you Tutorial Disk
------------------------
One more transfer of knowledge to go! So follow the
instructions as they appear on the screen once again for
your remaining blank disc. When the bar has transformed
from black to red then to blue, the screen informs you
that your Easy AMOS Tutorial disc is ready. Remove it,
WRITE PROTECT IT and stick its label on.

Finally, one more click on the [Ok!] panel brings you to
your first big decision.


Making a disk for your own programs
-----------------------------------
You'll be writing your own computer programs very
soon, and you can "save" them by storing them on disc.
We do not advise you to "save" programs on your three
new discs, but we DO advise you to format another
blank disc NOW, to use for storing home-grown
programs. Click on [Format] to do this, or choose [PASS]
if you decide to skip our advice!

If you choose to [Format], you'll be asked to type in a
name for your programs disc. We suggest that you call
it My Programs, and then press [Return]. Insert a blank

			-=- 10 -=-

disc and then click on the left mouse button to format it.
Don't forget to stick on the ready-made "My Programs"
label as soon as you remove it from the disc drive. You
can format another disc after this if you like, by clicking
on [Yes] when the screen offers you the chance.

If you click on ~No], you have a choice. If you want to
make another set of your three Easy AMOS discs as a
back-up in case of accidents, choose the [Create again]
box, which will take you back to the [INSTALL ON
FLOPPY] screen. If you can't wait to get on with the
show, slip your NEW "Easy AMOS Programs" disc into
the drive and refresh your Amiga's electronic mind by
pressing the [Control] key on the left-hand side of your
keyboard, at the same time as pressing both of the two
special "Amiga" keys [A] either side of the long [Space
Bar]. This "reboots" the machine, and automatically
loads up Easy AMOS. Loading Easy AMOS from scratch
is explained later.

The next section is only for users who have hard drives.
Floppy drive users should now skip to the last part of
this Chapter, headed "Loading Easy AMOS".


HARD DRIVE USERS
----------------
How to install Easy AMOS onto hard drive, using the
Amiga's internal floppy disc drive, "DF0".


The instructions you are about to be given are incredibly
simple. Every stage of the installation process will
appear on your screen automatically, and all you have to
do is follow them step by step.

Take out the two discs in the Easy AMOS package
labelled:

"Easy AMOS Master Disc 1" and

"Easy AMOS Master Disc 2".

			-=- 11 -=-

If your Amiga is switched on, take out any disc that may
already be in the internal drive, switch off the computer
for ten seconds to clear its memory of any bad habits.
Make sure that the mouse is plugged in, and get to work.

Boot the hard disc as usual. Insert "Easy AMOS Master
Disc 1" into DfO, and double-click on the resulting disc
icon of Master Disc 1. Then double-click on the
"Easylnstall" icon.

Select the nationality of your keyboard. For example, if
you are using an English keyboard, click on [English].

Follow the prompts and enter your first and last name.
Your Easy AMOS registration number will be generated
automatically.

Now write-PROTECT the Master Disc and click on
[Ok!]. Copy your registration number onto your disc
labels, registration card, and into the space provided at
the beginning of this book. Please. Trigger [Ok!] to
proceed.                             

Move the mouse pointer to the [INSTALL ON HARD
DRIVE] option, and click a mouse button. This kicks off
the automatic installation process.

You are presented with 12 option panels, each one
representing a different device name. Click on the
device name that you intend to use. For example, if you
want to install Easy AMOS on drive DhO, choose the
[Dh0:] option.

From now on, simply follow the on screen instructions. It's as
easy as that! You can select via a file selector or enter a specific
device name if you wish.

Once you have selected your hard drive destination, AMOS
appears saying "let me install your software" . Let him have his
way with your system. Once the data hasbeen copied across
from both of your Master Discs, the screen will tell you about
our automatic assign feature. Click on [Ok!] if you ares atisfied,
and then select [Exit].

			-=- 12 -=-

Loading Easy AMOS from the Workbench
------------------------------------
For those of you who are familiar with the Amiga "Workbench",
you may want to load Easy AMOS directly from that. When
Workbench is running simply insert your "Easy AMOS
Programs" disc and click on the Easy AMOS icon with your left
mouse button. If you've installed Easy AMOS onto hard disc,
select the appropriate icons until the Easy AMOS icon appears.
Of course, Workbench eats up memory that is much better
used for Easy AMOS programs!

More experienced users may choose to select Easy AMOS
from the CU, which uses "command lines" typed in from the
keyboard . In this case, enter the world of Easy AMOS with the
following

  EASYAMOS


Loading Easy Amos
-----------------
If you have made a copy of Easy AMOS onto your new disc
labelled "Easy AMOS Programs" disc, test-load it now by
following these steps:

- Switch off your Amiga for about ten se~nds.

- Put your "Easy AMOS Programs" disc into DF0.

- Switch on the computer.

- Easy AMOS will automatically load into memory.


Easy AMOS AND YOU
-----------------
You are now ready to follow our little AMOS character along
the programming path. Like you, he is setting out free from
complicated notions, and lilce him, we hope you will end up
brirnming with wisdom. You will meet AMOS throughout
this guide book, and he'll be making guest appearances in the
computer programs we have prepared for you to learn from
and enjoy.

Thank you for taking the time and tr~uble to read this
introduction and make your personal copies of Easy AMOS.
The time has come to write your first computer program using
the system. So, if you're ready, let's go!

			-=- 13 -=-

LET'S GO
--------
Leave the computer connected up in your usual way for
games or practical software. If you use a television set for
picturesandsound,that'sflne. If youusearnorutorforvisuals
and a hi-fi system for audio, Easy AMOS will take full
advantage of your system



Easy AMOS is probably the friendliest system you'll
ever come across, so you won't be at all surprised to be
welcomed with your own name after a few seconds,
before getting down to business!


			-=- 14 -=-

To create a computer program with Easy AMOS, you are
given a working area called the EDIT SCREEN. Press a
mouse button or any key on your keyboard, to reveal it
now. Or simply do nothing but wait. It will appear
automatically.


The edit screen
---------------
There's a guided tour of the Edit Screen in Chapter 2, but
you probably want to see some action straight away! So
instead of explaining what everything does, just identify
the bits that you need for making contact with Easy
AMOS immediately. At the top of the screen is an
assortment of control panels that are triggered using the
mouse. Below that is an Information Line where Easy
AMOS keeps you up to date with exactly what's going
on in your programming efforts. The main part of the
Edit Screen is the working area. This is the Edit Window
where you actually write your programs, and there is a
little flashing bar waiting to act as your Edit Cursor.

Press the [A] key on your keyboard, and a little "a" will
appear in the Edit window. Now hold down one of the
[Shift] keys and press [A] again. There should be a
capital "A" next to the little "a" on screen. This [Shift] key
is used if you want to type in any capital letters or
symbols that are marked above numbers and punctuation
marks on your keyboard. So to type in a "$" symbol, you
would press [Shift] and [4] together. Type in a "4" and a
"$" now.

Now locate the big key with a turn-left arrow on it,
on the right-hand side of the main block of keys,
and press it once. This is the [Return] key, and it is
used to start a new line when you write your
programs, so now the little Edit cursor should be
waiting at the beginning of the next line.

			-=- 15 -=-


Trying to communicate with Easy AMOS by typing
in "aA4$" is just about as daft as it sounds, so now
locate the [Delete] key marked by a left arrow,
which is just above the large [Return] key. Press it
as many times as you need to get rid of the characters
you've typed on the Edit Screen, until the cursor is
back home in the top-left corner of the Edit Window.


Next, locate the little cluster of four "cursor keys"
that are marked with direction arrows, just to the
right of your main keyboard. When you play with
these, the movement is duplicated by the flashing
Edit cursor as it moves around the Edit Window,
and this is how you can move quickly if you want
to change any of the characters that will make up
your first Easy AMOS program.


So, if you're ready to begin, copy the following
lines of program EXACTLY as they appear into the
Edit Window. Don't worry if you make a mistake,
because Easy AMOS is ready and able to help.
Start typing now. Good luck.

If you think every character in that program is now
faithfully reproduced in the Edit window, move the
mouse pointer up to the centre of the top line of little
panels, and click on the one that says [Test] with your left
mouse button.

Easy AMOS reads through your work instantly, and can
spot any mistakes. If all is well, the magic words "No
errors" have just appeared in the information line, but
the chances are you have put in the wrong character
somewhere, or left something out. This is where Easy
AMOS starts getting friendly, by displaying a little help
message in the information line, as well as moving the
flashing Edit cursor to the nearest point in your lines of
program where it knows the mistake is lurking. So put
any mistakes right until your [Test] delivers the "No
errors" message. Please insert your "Easy AMOS
Examples" disc into the internal drive.

Now get ready to see and hear the results of your first
effort. Move the mouse pointer to the box that says
[Run], and click the left mouse button. When your
Amiga asks you for your name, type it in and press the
[Return] key. And if you can do this with your first
program, no wonder your Amiga thinks it will never be
the same again.

You've already realised that writing programs with
Easy AMOS is not only simple, it's fun. If some of those
lines in your program seemed to make sense as you were
typing them in, you are well on the way to being a
programmer! Easy AMOS is a very sensible and very
direct "language" that allows your Amiga to understand
anything and everything you want to make it do.

Now [Run] your masterpiece again. In fact [Run] it as
many times asyou like. Just one more word before you
move on to the next Chapter. Congratulations!

				CHAPTER 2

				FIRST STEPS




"A journey of a
thousand miles
must begin with
the first step."
(Mao Tse-tung, 1947)
Chapter 2


The Easy AMOS discs
-------------------
Easy AMOS is an amazing package. You will use it to
write the sort of games and programs you have always
dreamed of. Hard drive users should now have all of
Easy AMOS stored on their system. For floppy disc
users, the three discs you have just created are filled with
everything you need to allow you to become a superb
computer programmer. Here's how.


The "Easy AMOS Programs" disc

This disc holds your tool-kit for manipulating graphics,
text, music, sound effects and most important of all,
ideas!


The "Easy AMOS Examples" disc

Of course you want to see and hear examples of what
Easy AMOS can do, and the pro~rams on this disc have
been specially designed foryou to learn fromand adapt,
as you progress through this guide book.

The"EasyAMOSTutorial" disc

The Tutorial disc will help to teach you how to use Easy
AMOS in the most practical ways. There's even a Quiz
to check on your new knowledge.


This book is written for absolute beginners, but it will
also help more experienced programmers. To get the
best out of Easy AMOS,try to read through each Chapter
in order of appearance but don't worry if you get stuck
along the way, you can always skip through a Chapter
and move on at your own pace.

			-=- 20 -=-

By following this guide book step-by-step you can take
full advantage of everything on offer. If there are any
words or ideas that you don't understand, or if you want
a quick reference guide, there is a Glossary at the end of
this book where you can find explanations of keywords,
technical terms and jargon. There's also a list of what
tricks and short-cuts the keys on your keyboard can
perform using Easy AMOS.


To make things as clear as possible in these pages, when
we refer to a key on your computer keyboard, it appears
like this [A].

In the same way, the little option boxes that you can
select on your screen by using the mouse pointer are also
given square brackets to separate them from the rest of
the text. For example: [Test]

Try out all the examples as they appear, and have as
much fun as you can while learning. Lines of computer
program that can be typed in, tested and run are shown
like this:


	Print "Hello"

When you see the <Hand> symbol, you will know that the
example that follows it can be typed in to your Edit
Screen, and the result will appear on your screen when
the example is [Run] . Feel free to experiment and change
these examples to see what happens. You can't harm
your computer by changing Easy AMOS examples!


			-=- 21 -=-

Now that's clear, let's get programming! Load Easy
AMOS as explained in the last Chapter, or if you've
already been experimenting and the machine is still
switched on, leave your "Easy AMOS Programs" disc in
the computer and reboot the machine by pressing the
[Control] key at the same time as both of the [Amiga]
keys. AMOS will soon appear to greet you.

Click a mouse button or press a key to display the Edit
Screen, which looks like this:


  _______________________________________________________________
 |    E A S Y    | Run   | Test  | Indent | Blocks |  Search	 |
 |    A M O S    |-------|-------|--------|--------|-------------|

			-=- 22 -=-

If you copied the example at the end of the last Chapter,
you will already have written your first program. This
next one should be easy in comparison. l'ype in the
following line exactly as it is printed below, and leave it
at the top-left comer of the Edit Window. Don't press
lReturn] yet:

print "Hello"


Easy AMOS programs use all sorts of instructions to tell
the Amiga what to do. Many of these instructions take
the form of special "keywords", and Easy AMOS
recognises them instantly. Now press the [return] key,
and look at that line you typed in. Easy AMOS has
already examined itand spotted a keyword. The keyword
has been automatically given a capital letter and
separated from what follows it by a space, so your line
now looks like this:

  Print "Hello"

Wherever possible, Easy AMOS will look at what you
type in, and try to make sense of it, even if it's not typed
in perfectly. But if you use the wrong keyword or make
an error in the spelling, you will be informed that there
is a mistake. Now add another two lines to your program
and press the [Return] key after each line, so that it looks
like this:

 Print "Hello"
 Wait 50
 Print "I am your program."

There are two keywords used there, and they have the
same sort of meaning as in normal English.


			-=- 23 -=-

PRINT
~~~~~
This is an instruction that tells the computer to print
some information on the screen. In this case the
information is a list of characters that make up words.
You have put the words inside inverted commas to tell
the computer what to print on screen.

WAIT
~~~~
This keyword is a command that tells the computer to
stop the program and wait for as long as you want before
moving on to the next instruction. The number that
follows it is the number of 50ths of a second to wait, so
in your example the program will wait for one second.

Now move your mouse pointer up to the [Run] option
at the top of the screen, and click on the left mouse button
to see the results of your work. As soon as you [Run]
your program, the blue Edit Screen disappears and a
new screen takes its place ready to display the current
program. In the case of your example, the word "Hello"
should appear on screen in the top left-hand corner, and
after a one second wait, "I am your program" appears
below it.


When the program has been completed, Easy AMOS
gives you a report which is automatically displayed
outside of the working area, at the bottom of the screen.
There should be a flashing message telling you at which
line your program ended, and below that you are told
how to get back to the editing process. If all is well, the
following report is now sitting centrally at the bottom of
your screen:

                  End of program at line 3
         [ESCAPE] to direct mode, [Space] to editor

			-=- 24 =-

Chapter 2


Editing
-------
To adapt or change your work, return to the Edit ~screen
by pressing the [Spacebar]. Change the characters to be
printed and the value that controls the waiting time, and
[Run] your edited program. You can alter your program
to something like this:

Print "Hello again!"
Wait 150
Print "I am your edited program."

That little program will now stay in your computer's
"memory" all the time that you leave it switched on, but
as soon as the power is turned off, the machine will
forget all about it and your work will disappear down
the electronic waste pipe. This is annoying, but not a
disaster if your program only took a minute to write and
another minute to edit. But supposing you write a
program that takes hours of work with hundreds of
instructions in it: the last thing you want to do is lose it.
To store programs on disc, they must first be "saved",
and then they can be "loaded" for later use.

Take the blank disc that you were asked to "format" in the
last Chapter, and get ready to use it. If you have not yet
prepared a formatted disc for your own programming
examples, do it now and label the disc something like
"My Programs", to use for storing examples that you
want to keep for later. When you've done that, reboot
Easy AMOS, go to the Edit Screen and type in and [Run]
this program:

Print  "I am test number one"

After checking that your example works, return to the
Edit Screen, remove your "Easy AMOS Programs" disc
and insert the new disc that you've prepared for storing
your programs.

Saving a program
----------------
"Half our life
is spent wishing
we'd saved half
our life."
   (Will Rogers,
        1927)

Saving an Easy AMOS program is very simple. Press an
[Amiga] key and the [S] key together, and a "FileSelector"
automatically pops up on the screen.


The little flashing cursor at the bottom of the File Selector
panel is waiting for you to give a name to the program
you want to save, so type in this name and then press
[Return]:

Testl.AMOS

That's it! Your test program has been saved onto the
disc, and you have been delivered back to the Edit
Screen.

			-=- 26 -=-

Keyboard short cuts
-------------------
Make sure that the edit cursor is in your line of program
and press [Shift] and [Del] together. Your program has
just been wiped off the screen. This is a good illustration
of how Easy AMOS uses certain keys acting together to
produce short-cuts in your editing. For example, pressing
[Del] on its own will delete the character at the current
location of the edit cursor, but if you press [Shift]+[Del]
together, the whole line in which the cursor is sitting will
be erased. There is a long list of similar key presses that
provide editing short-cuts, and you can find them at the
end of the Glossary.


At the moment, there should be nothing in your Edit
Window except the edit cursor. Let's prove that your
program has gone by trying to [Run] it. Nothing? Good.
Now press [Spacebar] to return to the Edit Screen and
look at the information line below the panel of options.
At the right-hand side, the following report is given:

  Edit: Test1.AMOS

This means that Easy AMOS is still expecting you to edit
the program you have just saved, named "Testl .AMOS".
But let's forget about this program for a while and write
another one.


Hold down the [Shift] key and look for a new option that
has appeared, called [New]. This option vaporises your
current program from the computer's memory
altogether, so it is very powerful! Trigger it by movi'ng
the mouse pointer to [New], then press the left mouse
button. A message appears in the Information Line,
saying:

  Please confirm ( Yes or No )

			-=- 27 -=-

This is provided to double-check the fact that you want
to get rid of your current program altogether, and waits
for you to press either lY] or [N]. Press [Y]. You may not
realise it yet, but you are using the Easy AMOS system
like an expert! Choices can be made straight off the
screen by triggering various options provided by
"menus", or by typing in instructions using the keyboard,
and you are already doing both.

The Information Line will ask if you want to save your
program, press [N] and it should now report that your
last program has gone, and that your next program has
yet to be given a name. Type this in:

Print "and I am test number two"

this time, don't run your new program by selecting the
[Run] option with your mouse, but press the [F1] Key
instead. This "function" key has been preprogrammed
to run the current program, and you have just been
introduced to another range of Easy AMOS short-cuts,
which use the function keys at the top of your keyboard
to perform special tasks. We'll take a look at what all
these keys can do later on, and they are all catalogued in
the Glossary.


If you are satisfied that your Test Number Two program
is all in order, get ready to save it, but DO NOT press
[Amiga]+[S]. Instead, hold down the [Shift] key and
look at the top of the Edit Screen. A [Save] option has
appeared where the [Test] option normally sits. Use
your left mouse button to click on the [Save] option, and
the file selector pops up again . Now name this program:

test2.AMOS

and press [Return]

			-=- 28 -=-


This is your final introduction to the way Easy AMOS
allows you to carry out your wishes. Wherever possible
you can choose between using the mouse to trigger
options from the screen menus, or type in instructions
via the keyboard. You can also use the right mouse
button to act as a [Shift] key. It can be easier and faster
to operate like this.

Get rid of your current program with [New] followed by
[Y] to confirm your action.

Loading a program
-----------------

"Well, punk? Is
it loaded?"
(Clint Eastwood,
        1971)

Easy AMOS programs are loaded via the File Selector.
You can either press [Amiga]+[L] or call up the [Load]
option on the Edit Screen by holding down [Shift]. This
time, when the selector appears, type in the name of the
program you want to load then press [Return]. Try
loading your "Testl.AMOS" program, and it should
appear in the Edit Window. Now load in "Test2.AMOS".

There can be no problem in remembering the names of
one or two programs or "files" on a disc. But when you
have dozens of discs each holding several groups of
files, you cannot rely on your own memory to sort
through them.


Imagine you are running a radio station, and you have
a load of music tracks that you want to store for easy
reference. Several tracks can be held on an album, and
each album is held in a sleeve that gives details about the
tracks. You can keep your albums in separate boxes,and
you can put a label on each box. If you keep the system
up to date, you'll be able to play any track on any album
in any box you like, without having to rummage through
your whole record library.

			-=- 29 -=-

THE FILE SELECTOR
-----------------
A computer "file" is just like a track of music. It is self-
contained, it has its own name, but it can also be held in
a "folder" along with other files.

You are now going to learn how to search through and
select files, so let's use some ready-made examples.
Insert your "Easy AMOS Examples" disc and call up the
File Selector with [Load] or [Amiga]+[L]. The main
window of the File Selector should now be filled with
the names of Easy AMOS examples.

Scrolling Through Files
------------------------
When there are more file names on a disc than can be
fitted into the window display, you can use the vertical
bar on the right-hand side of the window to "scroll" up
and down through the list of files. Simply place the
mouse pointer in the bar and drag it in the direction you
choose, using the left mouse button. There are also four
small icons that show direction arrows, with "up"/
~down" at the top of the scroll bar, and "left"/"right"
below it. Use the mouse to move through the list of files
in any direction you want, by selecting an icon and
clicking the left mouse button.

Folders
-------
Any names in the listing that begin with an asterisk, in
other words the * character, are the names of "folders".
These are like album sleeves that hold the titles of
several different tracks, or the equivalent of a cardboard
folder that contains various named documents. You can
open any of these folders and take a look at the names of
the files\ inside them by moving the mouse pointer over
the name of the folder, and clicking on the left mouse
button. It's a bit like examining a family tree, where the
name of the folder is the original "parent".

[Parent]

To come out of any folder, and get back to the main list
of files, simply click on this option with the left mouse
button. You also use the left mouse button to select the
following options.

			-=- 30 -=-


[Discs]
Change the file list to a list of the available devices (such
as disc drives).

[Ok]
This confirms that the file you have highlighted is the
one to be selected for loading.

[QUIT]
Use this to leave the File Selector and jump straight back
to the Edit Screen.

[SORT]
Normally, filenames are displayed in the order they
have been saved onto the disc. This option will perform
an automatic A-to-Z sort through all the files on the disc,
and display their names in alphabetical order.


DIRECTORIES
------------
If you get lost and want to check and see what files are
on a particular disc, there is a simple command you can
use directly from the Edit Screen.

DIR
This command tells Easy AMOS to display a "directory"
on screen of all the files and folders that are currently
saved on a disc. Go to the Edit Screen now, and make
sure that your "Easy AMOS Programs" Disc is in the
internal disc drive DF0. Now lRun] this:

Dir Df0:

The disc's directory should now appear on your screen,
with each file name on a separate line, and all folders
marked with the "~" character. Information is also ~iven
in the form of numbers, that tell you how big each file is.
Full details about directories and the names of their
"paths" can be found in Chapter 16.


			-=- 31 -=-

THE EDIT SCREEN GUIDED TOUR
---------------------------
If your directory listing i5 still on screen, press [Spacebar]
and welcome back to the Edit Screen! The time has come
for you to enjoy everything it has to offer, so here is a
short guided tour around its amazing features.


			  -=- 32 -=-

The Default Menu
-----------------
At the top of the screen, the Menu Window displays all
the commands that are currently available. This is your
entry to the Easy AMOS editing features, and it's the
menu that always appears when you first enter the Edit
Screen. We call it the "Default Menu~. You have already
used some of the items on offer, and a full list of what's
available in all the editing menus appears at the end of
the Glossary in this book.

The blocks menu
---------------
Hold down the [Ctrl] key, and you will see that the
Default Menu hasbeen replaced bya new set of options.
This is the Blocks Menu, and it provides everything you
need for manipulating blocks of computer program.

The system menu
---------------
This is called up from the Default Menu by holding
down one of the [Shift] keys, and it contains a selection
of important commands for handling complete
programs.

The search menu
---------------
When you hold down the [Alt] key, the Search Menu is
called up, and its various options are used to handle text.

The information line
--------------------
This line is below the Menu option panels, and it's where
Easy AMOS gives a running report on the editing process.
The report on the left-hand side of the Information Line
is a single letter that tells you what editing "mode" you're
using.

I means that new characters will be Inserted wherever
the edit cursor is on the screen. That's the normal state
of affairs. An O can also appear here. See below.

O means that new characters will Overwrite characters
that are already displayed in the Edit Window.

L: tells you which Line you are editing.

C: shows the number of the Column the edit cursor is in.

Text: Chip: Fast: report how much memory is
available for various tasks.

Edit: displays the name of the program that you are
editing.


			-=- 33 -=-

The Edit Window
---------------
You have already used the main Edit Window for short
home-grown programs that only use a few lines, but
most program listings will take up several screens or
"pages". If you remember how you scrolled through the
File Selector window, you will recognise exactly the
same facility here. The right-hand side of the Edit
Window features a vertical scroll bar, with a pair of Up/
Down options, and at the bottom of the screen is a
horizontal scroll bar with Left/Right icons in the corner.
Use your mouse to scroll through program listings.

Get rid of anything that is in the Edit Window now by
deleting it or selecting the [New] option followed by [Y]
to confirm your action. If a program is still in your
computer's memory, you will be asked if you want to
save it. Press [N] to confirm that you don't want to save
any current programs.

Direct mode
-----------
Easy AMOS is designed to allow you to test out ideas
without interfering with your program listings in the
main Edit Window. While editing, you can press [Esc]
at any time, and jump to "Direct Mode". This provides
you with a special screen that appears at the bottom of
your display, and you can move it vertically with the
arrow keys on your keyboard. Press [Esc] now, and
move the blue panel up and down, then position it in the
lower half of your screen. Now give Easy AMOS a direct
command, like this:

 Print "I am in Direct Mode!"

Try another one. For example:

 Wait 250 : Print "A five second wait."

			-=- 34 -=-

Function keys
-------------
When you enter Direct Mode, a list of special pre-set
"functions" is displayed in the blue panel. These functions
can be called up by various key-presses to perform
specific tasks, and full details of what they do can be
found in the Glossary. At the bottom of the blue panel
there is a "prompt" where your typed commands will be
displayed one after the other. Every time you press the
[Return] key to test out one line of direct commands, a
new prompt appears, and the list of functions moves up
one line in the panel's display.

Before we end this Chapter, here are three keywords
that you can use anywhere in your programs to jump
straight back to the editing process.

END
---
As soon as this command is recognised, it stops the
program, and you can either press [Esc] to go to Direct
Mode, or [Spacebar] to get to the Edit S~reen. Try this
example:

Print "Easy AMOS"

End

Print. "This line will be ignored."


EDIT
----
Similarly, this instruction tells your computer to leave
the current program and return you to the Edit Screen,
like this:

Print "Wait three seconds"

Wait 150

Edit

Print "I'm still waitingto be printed!"

			-=- 35 -=-

DIRECT
------
Use this command to jump out of your programs when
you want to test an idea in Direct Mode. For example:

    Print "Take me to Direct Mode"

    Direct


In the next Chapter, you'll learn how to ask Easy AMOS

		       UP AND RUNNING

"All I do is
get the big
fireworks up
and running."
 (Werner von Braun,
          1958)


This is where you use Easy AMOS'to take real control of
your Amiga. In this Chapter, you will write a simple
program and learn how to reorganise it to your liking.
Before beginning, treat yourself to a little friendly magic!

Easy AMOS provides you with hundreds of keywords,
and each one tells the computer to perform a specific
task. You can't be expected to learn them all straight
away, so they will be introduced in the most logical
order as you work your way through this book. It has
already been explained that you can check out anything
you don't understand in the Glossary, but Easy AMOS
is designed to help electronically too.

Display the Edit Screen, and if you are already editing a
program, get rid of it with [New] followed by a [Y] to
confirm. Now look at your Amiga's keyboard and locate
the [Help] key. Press it, and the Easy AMOS Help
Window will appear, ready and willing to give you
advice!


The easy AMOS Help system
--------------------------
At any moment, during editing, you can get information
about Easy AMOS keywords that are typed in the Edit
Window. To do so, just put the edit cursor on the FIRST
LETTER of the keyword you need help with, and press
[Help]. Easy AMOS will then try to find information
about this keyword, and display it in the Help Window.

There's a vertical scroll bar on the right-hand side of the
Help Window, and if the help information is too big to
fit in the window, simply click your left mouse button in
the scroll bar to drag the text into view. You can also
move the whole Help Window up and down your
screen, by clicking on its top border with the left mouse
button and dragging it vertically.

			-=- 38 -=-

You can either call for help about a keyword that is
already in the Edit Screen, or if you just want information
about a word you're not sure about, type it in and trigger
the help system. You don't even have to type in the
whole word, because Easy AMOS will try to recognise it
from the first few characters. ~or example, you can get
information about the keyword "Print" by using the
system on any of the following characters:
  Pr
  Pri
  Prin
  Print


If the word you are looking for is NOT a genuine Easy
AMOS keyword, an apologetic message appears at the
top of the Help Window. For example, if you ask for help
with "Banana", the following report is given:

  Help keyword:  "BANANA"

  Sorry, help not found!


To get back to the Edit Screen from the Help Window,
trigger the [Quit] option with your mouse, or press
[Return] or [Esc] or the [Help] key again. Try out the
Help System now with the keywords you already know.
We told you Easy AMOS was friendly!


Here's a new keyword you can ask Easy AMOS to [Help]
explain. It tells the program to wait until a single key is
pressed on the Amiga's keyboard before going on to the
next instruction.

			-=- 39 -=-


WAIT KEY
--------
Type in and [Run] the next example. Don't forget, you
can press [F1 ] to run a program, instead of triggering the
[Run] option with your mouse. When the first line has
appeared, the program will wait for you to press a key
before printing the last line on screen.

 Print "Wait"
 Wait Key
 Print "Continue"

Now delete those three lines, and [Run] or [F1] this:

          Print "Wait" : Wait Key: Print "Continue"


Separating commands in a line
------------------------------
So far, you have separated individual instructions by
typing them in and then pressing [Return] to put them
on a new line of program. But it is perfectly acceptable
to give several commands in a single line. They MUST
be separated by a colon, just like that last example. As
you might expect, Easy AMOS provides short-cuts
wherever possible, and you don't have to worry about
typing in correct spacings, as long as you stick to the
rules. When you use a colon to split up your commands,
spacing is automatic, in the same way that keywords are
recognised and given a capital letter and a space. Type
this in, [Return] and [Run]/[F1] to prove it:

print "I'm so": waitkey: print "neat !"


Now you are a genuine programmer with at least a
couple of hours experience, here's a trick of the trade
that the experts use to prevent amnesia.

			-=- 40 -=-

Rem statements
--------------
Imagine that your latest programming masterpiece is so
long, and so clever that you can't remember where
everything is and what anything is supposed to do!
What you need is a way to remind yourself what to
remember. This is where "Rem" statements come in.

REM or '
You can leave a little message anywhere you like in your
programs to jog your memory as to what that particular
chunk of program is designed to do. This is the last time
your intelligence will be insulted by telling you to [Run]/
[F1] a routine. From now on you are considered to be a
genuine Easy AMOS programmer, and you know how
to make an example work! Run this:

    Rem This reminder is for me not my Amiga

    Print "I am an Easy AMOS expert !"

When you begin a line with a Rem statement like that, it
is completely ignored as far as the Amiga is concerned,
but it can be a great help when you are scrolling through
your program and looking for reminders. If you put an
apostrophe character (') at the beginning of a line it acts
in exactly the same way as a "Rem", and that line is also
treated as a comment for your own use and not as a part
of your program. For example:

    ' This line is a comment

    Print "Easy"  : Wait 100 : Print "AMOS"

A Rem statement can be placed at the end of a line if you
prefer, but you are ONLY allowed to use the apostrophe
for this purpose at the beginning of a line. So this
example is fine:

           Print "This example is fine" : Rem Fine

But this example will create an error:

          Print "Whoops ! ": 'I am illegal

			-=- 41 -=-

MENUS
-----
The various options that can be selected at the top of
your Edit Screen are just like the menus offered in a
restaurant. You make your choice from the list on offer,
and Easy AMOS serves it up!

The default menu
----------------
You have already selected from the tasty dishes in the
"Default Menu" that appears when you enter the Editor,
by choosing options like [Run] and [Test].

The system menu
---------------
You have also had a brief look at what's on offer in the
"System Menu", by holding down a [Shift] key, and
selecting options like [New].

The search menu
---------------
Let's take a closer look at the Search Menu next, and see
how it can be used to manipulate your program listings.

When editing your own programs, or adapting some of
the ready-made examples on your Easy AMOS discs,
you will want to be able to find particular characters
such as keywords, numbers, Rem statements, and so on.
Once they have been found, you can change them. But
in a very long program listing, this could get very
tedious and there is no guarantee that you would spot
the characters you are looking for. Easy AMOS allows
you to spot characters you want to search for
automatically! Type in this example now.

    Print "One man went to mow,"
    Print "Went to mow a meadow."
    Print "One man lost his dog."
    Print Went to mow a meadow."

			-=- 42 -=-

Finding a string
----------------
Place the flashing "text cursor" back at the beginning of
the first line of that example on your Edit Screen, then
call up the "Search Menu". You can do this by clicking on
the [Search Menu] option, or by holding down the [Alt]
key. The top left-hand menu option should now say
[Find] . Trigger it with your left mouse button, and these
words will appear in the Information Line:

	Enter string to search:


A "string" is simply a number of characters strung
together, and you are about go on an automatic search
for some characters in your last example. Type in the
following characters, then press [Return]:

   -> mow


Easy AMOS will now make a search from the position of
the text cursor, forwards through your current program,
looking for the string of characters that make up "mow".
If the search is successful, the text cursor will jump to
that location in your listing.


Make sure you are still in the Search Menu and trigger
the [Find Next] option. Your text cursor will jump
straight to the next location of the characters you are
trying to find. Try that again, to jump to the third
occurrence of the characters that make up "mow". If you
attempt a further search and there are no more instances
of this string of characters, a "Not Found" report will be
given. Now trigger the [Find Top] option to jump to the
highest location of your string in the program, and press
[Return].


			-=- 43 -=-

Replacing a string
------------------
Once you've found a string, it's just as easy to replace it
with another one. Activate the [Find] option again,
delete the "mow" string in the Information Line, and
type in "lost" instead. Now hit [Return]. This time,
activate the [Replace] option, and you will be prompted
with this line:

Enter string to replace with:

Type in the following replacement string, then press
[Return]:

-> found

The "lost" string should now be replaced by "found"!

The full list of options on offer in the Search Menu can be
found at the end of the Glossary Chapter. But for the
time being, let's move on to the choice of options waiting
to be used in the "Blocks Menu".


The blocks menu
---------------
Call up this menu by selecting it from the Default Menu,
or by holding down the [Ctrl] key. As with all the other
menus, you can look up how everything works in the
Glossary, when you've got the time. As for now, let's
have some fun.

With your text cursor at the first character on the top line
of your current program, select [Block Start]. It will
come as no surprise to learn that you've just marked the
beginning of a block of program, ready to be manipulated.
Now move the text cursor below the last line of the
current example, and click on [Block End] . The program
block you have marked out should now be highlighted.
Are you ready for a little more Easy AMOS magic? Select
the [Block Paste] option from the menu, and you will
paste a perfect copy of your program listing block into
the Edit Window. In fact, [Block Paste] it as many times
as you like!

			-=- 44 -=-


Now mark the [Block start] and [Block end] of a few lines of your 
program, then, [Block cut] it to cut it out and make it dissappear.
Next, highlight another block, move your cursor anywhere you fancy in
the listing and [Block move] it! You can mark a block by using your right
mouse button for setting the start point in the listing, keeping it 
held down and dragging the cursor through the program lines. RElease the 
right mouse button to set the end of your block.

Experiment with the search menu as well as the Blocks menu and have some 
fun. If you get as far as ninety nine men moving meadows, it might 
be time to move onto the next chapter.

			  -=- 45 -=-

for help, and then take a closer look at the various
menus.


			   CHAPTER 4

			 THE BARE BONES

"Nothin' but a
rag, a bone an'
a hank o' hair."
  (Amos and Andy,
          1941)

This Chapter provides you with the bare bones that
support Easy AMOS programming. These bones are
used to build program skeletons, so you have to learn
what they do and how they work before you can add on
all the juicy chunks and hairy bits that give a program its
own look and feel.

Bones that make up a skeleton have some rather peculiar
names, but you'll be pleased to learn that Easy AMOS
avoids difficult words and ideas wherever possible, so
let'sstartwithoneofthesimplestconceptsincomputing,
known as "strings".


STRINGS
-------
A "string" is a number of characters all strung together
like beads on a necklace. If a string of beads hasn't got
a clasp at either end, all the beads fall off, and the
necklace ceases to exist. In much the same way, we put
a set of quotes at either end of a string of characters, to
hold them together and separate them from the rest of
the program. We also like to identify each string we
create with its own name, not just to give it a sense of
belonging, but also so that we can call it up by name and
use it later on. We attach a "dollar" symbol $ on the end
of a string name, to mark the fact that the name refers to
a string.

Characters in a string can be letters, numbers, symbols,
or even spaces. Think up a simple string now by giving
it a name, followed by the special $ symbol which you
type by pressing the [Shift] and [4] keys together. Then
define it, by letting the name of the string equal the
characters enclosed in quotes. You type in the quote
marks by pressing the [Shift] and [2] keys together.
Here's an example:

A$= "Easy AMOS"

Print A$

			-=- 48 -=-

Here's another, using three different strings:

 A$= "Easy"

 B$= "   "

 C$= "AMOS"
    
  Print A$+B$+C$

Strings are very useful creations, and they can act on
their own or work together, like that last example. Run
this example just for fun:

    A$= "EASY AMOS" - "S"

    Print A$


Easy AMOS allows you to play with strings in all sorts
of useful ways, and we'll come across them later on in
this Chapter. Before that, you need to understand one of
the most powerful sets of bones in the programming
skeleton. These are called "variables."


Variables
---------
There are certain parts of a computer program that are
set aside to store the results of calculations. We call the
names of these storage locations "variables." If you can
think of a variable as the name of a place where a value
lives, and that the value can change as a result of a
calculation made by your computer, then you will begin
to see how useful they are. Like strings, variables are
given their own names too, and once a name has been
chosen it can be given a value, like this:

    SCORE=100

    Print SCORE

That example creates a variable with the name of SCORE,
and loads it with a value of 100.

			-=- 49 -=-

Naming Variables
----------------
The rules for naming your variables are very easy to
follow. Firstly, all variable names must begin with a
letter, so you can name a variable like this:

  AMOS2=1

but the following name is not allowed:

  2AMOS=l


Secondly, you can't begin a variable name with the
letters that make up one of the Easy AMOS "keyword"
instructions, because this would confuse your Amiga.
Soalthough thefollowingnamewouldbealright,because
the first letters don't make a keyword:

  FOOTPRINT=1

this one is not acceptable, because the computer
recognises the first five letters as the keyword PRINT:

  PRINTFOOT=1

Try typing in those last two examples, then press the
[Return] key. In fact, Easy AMOS has spotted the illegal
name for you, and pointed out the mistake by splitting
the keyword away from the rest of the name.

The next naming rule is very easy. Variable names can
be as short as one character and as long as 255 characters,
but they can never contain a blank space. So the following
name iS fine:

  EASYPEASY=l

But this is an illegal variable name:

  EASY PEASY=l


			-=- 50 -=-

If you want to split your names up, use the "underscore"
character instead of spaces, by pressing the [Shift] and
[-] keys together, for example:

  I_AM_A_LONG_LEGAL_VARIABLE_NAME=l


Types of variables
------------------
There are three types of variable that you can use in your
programs.

WHOLE NUMBERS

The first type is where the variable represents a whole
number, like 1 or 666. These variables are perfect for
holding the sort of values used in computer games. For
example:

 HISCORE = 1000000

 Print HISCORE

Whole numbers are called "integers", and integer
variables can be as high as 147,483,648 and as low as
-147,483,648.


REAL NUMBERS

Variables can also represent fractional values, such as
1.2 or 99.9 and results from this sort of variable will be
accurate to seven decimal places. Real number variables
must always have a "hash" symbol tacked on to the end
of their names, which looks like this #. For example:

 REAL_NUMBER#=3.14

 Print REAL_NUMBER#

			-=- 51 -=-


String Variables
----------------
This type of variable holds text characters, and the 
length of that text can be anything from 0 to 65,500
characters long. String variables are distinguished from 
number variables by a $ character on the end of their 
names, to tell easy AMOS they they will contain text
rather than numbers. For example:

	NAME$ = "Name"
	
	GUITAR$ = "Twang"

	Print NAME$,GUITAR$

Inputting values
----------------
If you want to put information into a variable while a 
program is running, there is a special command that 
loads values typed directly from the keyboard.

INPUT
-----
When you use the input command, you can invent some text to act as a 
"screen prompt" if you like, in which case
you must put a semi-colon between the text and your variable list 
like this :

	INPUT "TEll me your name .... ";name$

	Print "Hello ";NAME$

To make that work, [Run] it, answer the screen prompt and
then press the [Return] key. Now add a semi-colon to the end
of the first linem and notice how your text appears at the
position of the flashing text cursor, after you have typed in 
your data. When you understand how that works put your computer
to work with this:

	INPUT "Give me two numbers to add";A,B
	
	Print A;" plus";B;" Equals ";a+b

			-=- 52 -=-

See how Easy AMOS automatically provides question
marks to prompt your next input. Now try and input a
text character instead of a number, and Easy AMOS will
spot the mistake and ask you to go back to the beginning
of the input process with this message:

  Please redo from start

ARRAYS
------
Supposing you want to use a whole set of similar variables
for something like a table of football results or a catalogue
for your record collection. No problem. Any set of
variables can be grouped together in what is known as
an "array".

Creating an array
-----------------
Let's say you have 101 titles in your record collection,
and you want to tell Easy AMOS the size of the table of
variables needed for your array. There is a special
keyword for setting up this dimension.

DIM

This is used to dimension an array, so the variables in
your record collection table could be set up like this:

         -> Dim ARTIST$(100),TITLE$(100),YEAR(100)

Element numbers in arrays always start from zero, so
your first and last set of entries might contain these
variables:

ARTIST$(0)= "AC/DC"
TITLE$(0)= "Blow Up Your Video"
YEAR(0)=1988
ARTIST$(100)= "ZZ Top"
TITLES(100)= "Afterburner"
YEAR(100)=1985


			-=- 53 -=-


To extract elements from your array, you could then use
something like this:

    Print TITLE$(0),YEAR(0),ARTIST$(0)

    Print TITLE$(100),YEAR(100),ARTIST$(100)

These tables can have as many dimensions as you like,
and each dimension can have up to 65,000 elements.
Here are some modest examples:

     Dim ARRAY(5),NUMBER#(5,5,5),WORD$(5,5)


FUNCTIONS
---------
There is a whole set of bones in your Easy AMOS
skeleton known as "functions". These are keywords that
have one thing in common: they all work with numbers
in order to give a result. To make it easy to recognise a
new function when it appears in this guide book for the
first time, we have placed an "equals" sign in front of it,
like this:

=FUNCTION

Easy AMOS provides you with a range of functions used
with strings, so let's go back to your record collection
and start manipulating some strings.


Finding the length of a string
------------------------------
=LEN

To discover the number of characters stored in a string,
in other words to find out its "length", the LEN function
looks at the string and tells you this number. See how
this works with the following example:

 Dim TITLE$(2)

 TITLE$(0)= "These"

 TITLES(1)= "Titles"

 TITLE$(2) = "Get bigger and bigger !"

 Print Len (TITLE$(0))

 Print Len (TITLE$(1))

 Print Len (TITLE$(2))

			-=- 54 -=-

Finding characters in a string
------------------------------
Supposing you want to search through your data, and
find out all the records you bought in a particular year,
or all the albums recorded by a certain artist, or even all
the titles in your posession containing the word "burn".


=INSTR

This function looks to see if a particular string occurs
inside another string. If the search fails, a result of zero
is given, but if the search is successful then its position is
reported. Type in this routine:

    Input "Give me an album title: ";A$
    Input "What word am I searching for?";BS
    Print Instr(A$,B$)


Now [Run] that routine, and experiment with your
input strings to test the searching process. For example,
you could type in these inputs and see the results:

AFTERBURNER

BURN


BURNING LOVE

BURN


BERNADETTE

BURN

			-=- 55 -=-

Normally the search will start from the first character in
your text string, but you can start the process from any
positionyoulikeinthestring. Thisisdonebyaddingthe
number of characters from the left of the string which is
to become the new start position for the search. For
example:

Print Instr("EASY AMOS BASIC", "SIC")

Print Instr("EASY AMOS BASIC", "SIC",14)

Reading characters in a string
------------------------------
There are three sets of functions that are used to read
certain characters in a string, and their names give clues
to what they are used for.


=LEFT$

=RIGHT$

=MID$

See what result these three lines give:

    Print Left$("Easy AMOS",4)
    Print Right$("Easy AMOS",4)
    Print Mid$("Easy AMOS",3,5)


Notice how Left$ and Right$ return the number of
characters given in the brackets, starting from the left-
hand and right-hand end of the string, respectively.
Similarly, Mid$ returns characters from the middle of a
string, with the first number in the brackets setting the
offset from the start of the string and the second number
setting the number of characters to be fetched.

			-=- 56 -=-

Replacing characters in a string
--------------------------------
These three functions can also be used to tell Easy AMOS
to replace characters in one string with characters copied
from another string. For example:
A$= "Very Dull BASIC"

  Left$(A$,9)= "Easy AMOS"

  Print A$

  B$= "means streets"

  Right$(B$,8)= "superb"

  Print B$

  C$= "AMOS Basic"

  Mid$(C$,6,3)= "Mag"

  Print C$


Placing characters in a string
------------------------------
=INPUT$

To enter characters into a string variable straight from
the keyboard, this function will wait patiently for you to
type in the number of characters you specify in brackets.
Press [Return] after you enter each character when you
[Run] this routine:

    Print "Please type in ten characters"


    A$=Input$(10) : Print "You typed ";A$

This can be used for inputting passwords, which
shouldn't be seen on screen.

			-=- 57 -=-

Copying characters from a string
--------------------------------
=STRING$

If you need to create a new string full of copies of the first
character in an existing string, this function does just
that. Simply include the number of copies you want, like
this:

-> Print String$( "Easy AMOS", 10 )

That example produces a new string containing ten
copies of the character "E".


Converting strings
------------------
=VAL
=STR$

This pair of functions is used for string conversion . VAL
will convert a list of decimal digits already stored in a
string, and change them into a number. For example:

X=Val ("1234")

Print X

To perform the reverse task, STR$ converts a real number
variable into a string, like this:

X$=Str$ (1234)

print x$


Now that your programming skeleton is ready to obey
your commands, the next Chapter will show you how to
give it a logical brain!

				Chapter 5


				  LOGIC	

"I been wrestlin'
and prayin' and I
know th' truth at
last. "
  (Amos, Cold
Comfort Farm,
1932)


DEcisions
---------
A computer program is nothing more than a bunch of
commands that tell your Amiga what to do. If the
computer only obeyed a list of instructions one after the
other, programs would be very limited and very boring.
The magic begins when you teach your machine to think
for itself and start making decisions!

The simplest way to get a computer to make a decision
is to show it something, and then offer it a choice of
things to do depending on what it sees. If computers
understood plain English wewould say somethinglike,
"Look out the window. If it's daytime then go to San
Francisco. But if it's not daytime, go to bed."


When this sort of choice is given with Easy AMOS, the
computer looks at the condition on offer, and decides if
that condition is true or false. If it's true, then the Amiga
decides to take one course of action, but if it's false
another course of action will be taken.


Labels
------
One course of action could be to jump to a new place
somewhere in the list of commands. So you need a way
of marking parts of your program with a "label" before
telling the computer to go to that label marker and carry
out whatever instructions are there. This is dead easy. A
label is setup by giving it a name,then tacking on a colon
character so the computer can recognise it and not
confuse it with anything else. You can use any letters or
number characters you like, including the ~underscore"
character. Here's an example of a label:

SAN_FRANCISCO:



			-=- 60 -=-

Going to a label
----------------
GOTO

By using label markers, you can now jump to anywhere
you like in the program with a GOTO command. Type
in this routine which includes the label in that last
example, and make sure you understand how it works.
Normally, you would have to wait for three minutes to
find out if it's day or night:

    Print "What time is it?  ": Wait 100

Goto SAN_FRANCISCO
Wait 180000
SAN_FRANCISCO:
Print  "It must be daytime !"

Going to a numbered line
------------------------
Any line in your Easy AMOS programs can be identified
by a line number, and you can command the program to
GOTO a particular line number too. Here is an example
of jumping to a line number:

    Goto 5

    Print "I am being ignored."

    5 Print "I am line 5"

Don't confuse the numbers that you give your lines with
the number of lines in your programs. In the last
example, line 5 is obviously not the fifth line in the
routine! In fact this is an old-fashioned way of
programming, and labels are much easier to remember
and to spot when you look through your programs


Going to a variable
-------------------
You can command the program to GOTO a variable as
well, and that variable can be any normal "string" or any
number. This example uses one label marker to BEGIN
the routine over and over again, and another one to jump
into the BED with the right number.

			-=- 61 -=-


Begin

Goto BED + 2

End

BED1:

Print "This Bed will never be used"

BED2:

Print "Welcome to Bed number two"

Goto BEGIN


Making decisions
----------------
The time has come to let your Amiga begin to think for
itself, and make a decision without any help from you.

IF

THEN

These two command words have a similar meaning in
Easy AMOS as they do in normal English. IFa condition
is true THEN the computer will decide to take one
course of action. If it is not true, the machine does
something else. Run this little routine, then watch the
computer decide what time it is.

NIGHT=1


DAY=1

Print "What time is it now?  ": Wait 150

If NIGHT=DAY Then Goto BED

Print "Time I bought a watch"

Goto WATCHMAKER

BED:

Print "I think it is bed time"

WATCHMAKER:


			-=- 62 -=-


Now change the value of NIGHT to another number,
and run that routine again. IF you are sure you
understand how the computer reaches its decision THEN
GOTO the next paragraph, or ELSE try again.


ELSE
----
Your computer also understands the word ELSE when
making decisions as to whether something is true or
false, so you could change that last routine to something
like this:

   NIGHT=0

   If NIGHT=DAY Then Goto BED Else Goto POT

   Print "True " : End

   Print False

There is an even better way to use IF that can trigger off
a whole range of instructions, depending on the outcome
of a single decision. The jargon for this sort of process is
a "structured test".

IF

END IF

In a structured test, you don't use THEN at all. The test
is set up with an IF, and ended with END IF. Every IF
statement in your program must be paired off by i ts own
END IF, to tell the computer exactly which bunch of
instructions get carried out inside the test. Try out a
structured test now, by typing this in exactly and then
running it:


			-=- 63 -=-

Input "Type values for A,B and C ";A,B,C
If A=B
    Print "A equals B ";
  Else
    Print "A is not equal to B ";
    If A<>B and A<>C
	Print "or to C"
    Endif
Endif

In that last example you used the characters "=" and "<>" 
instead of words, as a sort of short-hand, which your
computer had no trouble in understanding. So you
better understand what they mean too!  

  =  means "is equal to"
  <> means "is not equal to"
  > means "is greater than"
  < means "is less than"
  >= means "is greater than or equal to"
  <= means "is less than or equal to"

How about writing a simple computer game to test out
what you've learned so far! It's a genuine game of logic
and the computer responds to anything that you throw
at it. Look at the way the program uses those short-hand
symbols to make a decision, then jumps back to the
SECRET label until it is satisfied. Notice how each IF has
its own END IF, and how ELSE is used. There's a new
command near the beginning too. CLS stands for "clear
the screen", and you'll be learning more about that in the
next Chapter. As for now, write this game, then go and
find some friends to inflict it on!

Print "Ask your friends to shut their eyes."

Print "Now you think of a number between"

Print "1 and 100 and type it in secretly."

Input A

Cls

Print "Ask your friends to open their eyes."

Wait 250

SECRET:

Print "FIND THE SECRET NUMBER"

Input B

If B=A

   Print "WELL DONE!"

Else

   If B<A

      Print "WRONG go higher  ": Goto SECRET

   Else

      If B>A

         Print "WRONG try lower  ": Goto SECRET


      Endif

    Endif

Endif

			-=- 65 -=-


Now have a try at injecting some extra fun into the game, and
add as many ELSE . ..IF.. .END IF tests as you like after the Print
'WELL DONE" statement. For example:

Else

If B>=101

Print "Keep your guesses below 100"

Goto SECRET

Don't forget to add another END IFat the end of the program.


Loops
-----
To write a separate routine for each choice of the 100 numbers
in that game could get very tedious, and to end up with 100
END IFs is not a very neat way of programming. Thankfully
Easy AMOS offers all sorts of short cuts to help you repeat
sections of your computer program. These "loops" repeat a
routine for as long as necessary.

DO

LOOP

This pair of commands will loop a list of statements forever!
DO is used as a marker position in the program for the LOOP
to come back to. Try this:

  Do

   Print "INFINITY  ": wait 25

  Loop


Leaving a loop
--------------
Now that you've locked yourself into an infinite loop,
you better learn how to escape from it.

EXIT

This little command word tells the program to leave a
loop right away, and you can use it to escape from any
of the sorts of loops you will come across in this Chapter.
Because you can have lots of loops inside one another,
when you use EXIT by itself only the innermost loop will

			-=- 66 -=-


be given a short circuit to stop it. But by adding a
number after EXIT, the program will understand how
many loops you want to leave. Here's an example:

Do
 Do
   Input "Type in a number ";X
   Print  "I am the inner loop"

   If X = 1 then Exit

   If X = 2 then Exit 2

 Loop
 Print  "I am the outer loop"
Loop
Print "And I am outside both loops"


Conditional loops
-----------------
WHILE

WEND

This pair of commands makes the program repeat a
group of instructions all the time a particular condition
is true. The condition is checked at the start of the loop.
WHILE marks the start of this sort of loop, and WEND
must be used to position the end of it. Try this simple
logic routine:

BLAZES:
Print "Please type in the number 9"
Input X
While X=9
 Cls : Print X : Wait 50 : Goto BLAZES
Wend
Print "That's not a 9!"

                       
			-=- 67 -=-



All the time you obey the screen's wishes by typing in 9,
the routine will be repeated. But as soon as you type in
another number, you jump out of the loop.

  REPEAT

  UNTIL

Unlike that last example, instead of checking if a condition
is true or false at the start of a loop, this pair of commands
is used to check at the end of the loop. As you might
expect, REPEAT marks the start of the loop, and it must
be paired by UNTIL at the end of the loop. This example
will go on and on, waiting for you to press a mouse
button:

   Repeat

      Print "I can wait forever": wait 15

   Until Mouse Key<>0

Easy AMOS is continually checking the state of the
mouse, so the only way to activate the Until condition in
that example is to press a mouse button.



Numbered loops
--------------
It's all very well handing over the business of making
decisions to the computeis own logic, but what happens
when you want to repeat a loop for the number of times
YOU want? No problem. Sections of your program can
be looped to order!

  FOR

  NEXT

This pair of control words is one of the programmer's
classic tricks. Try this now for an instant demonstration
of a FOR...NEXT loop:

   For X=1 To 7

    Print "SEVEN DEADLY SINS"

   Next X


			-=- 68 -=-


Now try this:

    For DAY=l To 365
       Print DAY
    Next DAY


Steps
-----
TO

The number of DAYs that have just been printed run
from the first TO the last value that you have set.
Obviously, the numbers go up one at a time. But
suppose you want to change the rules,and only print out
one day for every week of the year. Imagine you are
climbing a long staircase, one step at a time. Now
imagine that you can change the length of your legs to
any size you feel like!

STEP

All you have to do to change the size of your step is this:

    For DAY=1 To 365 Step 7
     Print DAY
    Next DAY

Now change the size of your step to once every 28 days,
or whatever you like, and see the result.


Subroutines
-----------
Little groups of dance steps in a stage show are sometimes
called "routines". Packages of program instructions that
do a speciflc task can be thought of as routines too. In
which case, it's not too hard to think of little packages of
instructions as "subroutines".

GOSUB

RETURN

GOSUB is a command which is short for "GO to a
SUBroutine", and Easy AMOS has stolen it from the
antique days of programming. It works in much the
same way as GOTO. For example, if you wanted to jump
to a routine marked by a label, you could use this:

			-=- 69 -=-


  Gosub LABEL

Alternatively, you can force your program to jump to
the group of instructions that start with a particular line
number. For example to jump to a subroutine labelled
line 10, you would use this:

  Gosub 10

Labels and line numbers don't have to be invented by
you. The computer is quite capable of creating them as
the resul t of an expression, and you can get your GOSUB
to jump to the result of any expression you want, like
this:

  Gosub X+10


When your program obeys a GOSUB instruction, you
can't leave it hanging around there wondering what to
do next, so it has to be told to RETURN to the main
program. This example demonstrates how:

Print "This is the main program"
For HOW=1 To 3
 Gosub TEST
Next HOW
End
TEST:
Print "Here we go GOSUB  ": Wait 50
Print "How equals ";HOW
Return

			-=- 70 -=-

Conditional jumps
-----------------
So far, you have learned how to let the computer work
out when to jump to another part of the program by
taking logical decisions based on all sorts of situations
that are either true or false. Now you need a way of
planning ahead, and getting the program to make the
same kind of jumps whenever it recognises a particular
variable. In normal English this would be like saying
"Jump to where I tell you ON the following occasion." In
Easy AMOS, it's just as simple.

ON

This control word can be used to force the program to
jump when it recognises a particular variable. But even
better than this, the program can be made to jump to all
sorts of different locations, depending on the value the
variable holds when it is spotted.

ON...GOTO

Try out this little program. It will jump to any of the four
possible labels, depending on what value you give X.


 Print "GIVE X A VALUE FROM 1 TO 4"

 Input X

 On X Goto LABEL1,LABEL2,LABEL3,LABEL4

LABEL1:

Print "One for the money"

LABEL2:

Print "Two for the show"

LABEL3:

Print "Three to get ready"

LABEL4:

 Print "Go cats go"

			-=- 71 -=-


For that to work properly, X must have a value from 1 up to
the nurTiber of the highest possible destination, so if you give
X a value of zero or five, for example, things will go wr~ng. In
fact the third line of that program is a very economical way of
writing the following lines:

If X=l Then Goto LABEL1

If X=2 Then Goto LABEL2

If X=3 Then Goto LABEL3

If X=4 Then Goto LABEL4

Now change the program by swapping around the label
numbers, and see what happens.

ON...GOSUB

Exactly the same system can be employed with a GOSUB
instead of GOTO. To get the program to jump back to the next
instruction after an ON...GOSUB statement, use RETURN in
the usual way.

PROCEDURES
----------
'We have
procedures
for everything.
Even going to
the bathroom!'
(J. EdgarHoover,
1955)

This Chapter is all about giving your program skeletons a
logical brain, so what can be more logical than concentrating
on one problem at a time to avoid getting into a complicated
mess! This is exactly what "procedures" are used for. They
help you avoid side-tracks and wrong directions by creating
small, independent program chunks.

PROCEDURE

END PROC

A procedure is created in exactly the same way as a normal
variable, by giving it a name. The n arne is then followed by a
list of parameters, and the procedure must be ended by an End
Proc command. Procedure and EndProC commands MUST
be placed on their own individual lines. For example:

 Procedure HELLO

   Print "Hello, I am a procedure !"

End Proc

			-=- 72 -=-


If you try and [Run] that example, nothing will happen.
This is because a procedure must be called up by name
from inside your program before it can do anything.
Now add the following line at the start of that last
example, and [Run] it.

 HELLO

To help you find the starting positions of procedures in
a very long program, Easy AMOS offers a simple short-
cut, using two keys. By pressing the [Alt] key and the
[Down Arrow] key together, your edit cursor will jump
to the next procedure definition in your programs. To
jump to the previous procedure, simply press [Alt] and
[Up Arrow] together. This short-cut works equally well
with labels and line numbers!


Local variables
---------------
All the variables that are defined INSIDE a procedure
work completely separately from any other variables in
your programs. We call these variables "local" to the
procedure.

Global Variables
----------------
All the variables OUTSIDE of procedures are known as
"global" variables and they are not affected by any
instructions inside a procedure. So it is perfectly possible
to have the same variable name referring to different
variables, depending on whether or not they are local or
global.

GLOBAL
------
In a large program, it's often convenient for different
procedures to share the same set of global variables,
because this offers an easy way of transferring large
amounts of information between the procedures. The
Global command sets up a list of variables that can be
accessed from ANYWHERE in your program. Try this
example:


			-=- 73 -=-

a=5: b=10

Global A,B

TEST1

Print A,B

TEST2

Print A,B

Procedure TEST1

  a = a+1 : b = b+1

End Proc

Procedure TEST2

 A=A+B : B=B+A

End proc

Returning values from procedures
--------------------------------

=PARAM

If you want to return a value or a "parameter" from inside a
procedure, you need a way of telling your program where to
find this local variable. The Param function takes the result of
an expression in an End Proc statement, and returns it to the
Param variable.

PARAM$

If the variable you are interested in is a string variable, the $
character is used. Also note how the pairs of square bracket
are used in the following example:

JOIN STRINGS["one","two","three"]

Print ParamS

Procedure JOIN_STRINGS[A$,B$,C$]

Print A$,B$,C$

End Proc[A$+B$+C$]

PARAM#
------
For real number variables, the # character must be used. For
example:

			-=- 74 -=-


      JOIN_NUMBERS[1.5,2.25]
         Print Param#
      Procedure JOIN_NUMBERS[A#,B#]
       Print A#,B#
      End Proc[A#+B#]


Jumping into a procedure
------------------------

ON.. PROC

You have already learned how On can be used to jump to a
Gosub routine, and it's just as easy to use On for jumping to a
procedure. In this case, if a variable holds a particular value,
you set up the instruction as follows:

  On X Proc PROCEDURE1,PROCEDURE2

Which is the same as saying:

  If X=1 Then PROCEDURE1

  If X=2 Then PROCEDURE2

Of course you can have as many values triggering off jumps
to as many procedures as you want.

Jumping out of a procedure
--------------------------
POP PROC

Procedures will only return to the main program when the
End Proc instruction has been reached. But supposing you
need to jump out of a procedure immediately. The Pop Proc
instruction provides you with a quick getaway! Try this:

Procedure ESCAPE
     For PRISON=l To 1000000
       If PRISON=10 Then Pop Proc
     Next PRISON
     Print  "I am abandoned."
End Proc
Print " I'm free !"

"My record
stands for
itself."
     (Margaret
 Thatcher, 1990)

In the next Chapter, you will discover how to handle
text. As a prelude to that, here's a demonstration to try
out using procedures as well as some new text
commands. Type it in stage by stage.

The first line turns off the cursor, and sets the colour of
the background screen. Then data is placed inside the
square brackets, ready to be sent to a procedure. In this
case, our data will be a record of some incredibly famous
people, giving their first name, surname, age and
occupation.

  Curs Off: Paper 0

  RECORD[ "Francois", "Lionet ",28, "Genius "]

Leave that on screen, and now call the same procedure
with different parameters, by adding these lines:

  RECORD[" Easy"," AMOS" ,1,"Computer Cult" ]

  RECORD [ "Mel", "Croucher", 43, "Unemployed" ]

Now set up additional data in variables, by adding these
lines:

A$= "Richard"

B$= "Vanner"

AGE=24

OCC$= "Projects Manager"

RECORD [A$,B$,AGE,OCC$]

Here comes the procedure. Add these lines to your
example, and then [Run] the program.

			-=- 76 -=-


 Procedure RECORD [NAME$, SURNAME$, AGE, occ$]
     Cls 0
     Locate 0,3
     A$=NAMES+" "+SURNAMES
     Centre A$
     Locate 0,6
     A$="Age: "+Str$(Age)
     Centre A$
     Locate 0,9
     A$= "Occupation:  "+OCC$
     Centre A$
     Locate 0,16
     Centre "Press a key"
     Wait key
 End Proc


NESTING
-------
Many of the examples in this book are set out in a rather
fancy way. Little blocks of the programs have been
"indented" by placing extra spaces at the start of their
lines. This isn't just to make them look prettier (although
there's nothing wrong with beautifying the way your
programs look) it helps to identify certain routines in
your listings.

By pressing the function key [F3] while in the Edit mode,
Easy AMOS automatically indents your program listing.
When programmers place a block of program like a
subroutine inside another block, they call it "nesting",
and these nests can be marked by indenting them.

			-=- 77 -=-

Because you are well on the way to being a computer
programmer, you can start taking the ideas shown in
these Easy AMOS examples and use them, change them,
link them up and expand them for your own
programming ideas. Sooner or later your home-grown
programs will consist of a lot of routines, and they will
take up a lot of lines, so don't forget to make use of Rem
statements, labels, and indented nests to find your way
around. You won't regret it.


Now that you've got the idea about making the layout of
your programs easy to read,the next Chapter is all about
how to work wonders with the appearance of the text
you see on the screen.

			-=- 78 -=-


              		    CHAPTER 6
		
			      TEXT

"The secret of all
good writing is
sound judgement."
(Horace, 13 B.C.)



This Chapter explains how to use the advantages of Easy
AMOS for handling written text.

Old-fashioned typewriters use tiny hammers to bash
out preset characters, and more modern machines allow
you to swap between a series of different factory-made
character designs called "fonts". The trouble with
typewriters is that if you make a mistake on paper or
want to change text around, you have to use erasers,
scissors, glue and a lot of wasted time.

Easy AMOS gives you the freedom to use and create all
sorts of text characters, and to handle text as you please,
whether you want to design your own newsletter, put a
hi-score table in a game, invent dialogue boxes, make a
schedule for the tax man or write a letter to Santa Claus.

The character set
-----------------
Let's see what pre-set characters are available, by running
the next routine using a For...Next loop that you learned
about in the last Chapter:

   For C=0 To 255
     Print Chr$(C);
   Next C

You should now have six lines of characters on your
screen, containing symbols, letters, numbers and graphic
characters. If you want to take the time to count them all,
you'll discover that the first 32 are invisible. That's
because they are reserved for Easy AMOS to use for
special purposes.

Computers need some way of recognising what
characters are being used, so each character has its own
code number from zero to 255. "Ascii" stands for
American Standard Codes of Information Interchange,
which is the code your computer uses for recognising
characters and talking to other machines like printers.

			-=- 80 -=-

=CHR$
-----
You have just asked Easy AMOS to Print Chr$ in that last
example line of code, in other words "please print me a
string that contains a single character with an Ascii code
number ranging from 0 to 255". Find out which characters
have which Ascii codes now, by calling up different code
numbers like this:

 Print Chr$(97)

=ASC
----
Next, try it the other way around, and use this function
to discover the Ascii code number of any character you
are interested in. For example:

Print Asc(A)

Print Asc(M)

Print Asc(O)

Print Asc(S)


If you want to see the entire visible character set along
with their Ascii code numbers, run this routine:

For C=32 To 255

Print Chr$(C) ; "  =Ascii Code ";

Print Asc(Chr$(C)) : Wait 50

Next C

If your typing speed is not too brilliant, you are going to
impress yourself by using your own typing tutor in the
next Chapter! Meanwhile, why not cheat a little.

During editing, a character or cursor movement is
repeated for as long as its key is held down. This can be
a bit frustrating when it causes unwanted characters or
cursor movements.

			-=- 81 -=-



KEY SPEED
----------
Is the command that changes the repeat rate while a key
is held down. Just say what time lag you want to use,
measured in 50ths of a second, followed by the delay
speed between each character you type, also in 50ths of
a second. Slow things down a lot by running this:

  Key Speed 50,50 : Rem One second delay

Now see what effect this has when you hold down a key
while editing.

When you are tired of each repeat keystroke taking one
second to complete, type the next example:

  Key Speed 1,1 : Rem My brain hurts


Now run that example, then try to edit the key speeds
again. It's almost certain that your reflexes will have just
crumbled and you'll have to reset your Amiga!


Setting Text colours
--------------------
The appearance of text can be changed in two main
ways: colour and shape. As you would expect, Easy
AMOS allows you to alter the way your text looks
simply and quickly.

This a good opportunity to go to the toilet, make a cup
of tea, switch off your computer, then reload Easy
AMOS when you're comfortable. Then you can be sure
that the colour presets are all in order.

Are you sitting comfortably? Then imagine that you
have a selection of up to 16 different coloured electronic
pens, along with 16 different coloured sheets of electronic
paper to write on. In fact, there is a much larger selection
than this, but we won't worry about that for now. Each
colour has its own index number, starting from zero,
and when you select colours you just call them up by
putting their index number after a Pen or Paper
command.

			-=- 82 -=-


Using Text   
----------
PEN
This command sets the colour of your text. Try this:

 Pen 4 : Print REDFACES

Now see what current choice there is in your colour
index, using this routine:

  For INDEX=0 To 15
    Pen INDEX
        Print "Pen number ";INDEX
  Next INDEX

PAPER

Use this command to set the colour of the background
electronic paper on which you write text. Change paper
colours like this:

 Paper 4 : Pen 2 : Print White on Red


INVERSE ON
INVERSE OFF

This is an easy way of swapping over whatever Pen and
Paper colours are in use. Prove how simple this is by
running the following routine, choosing your own colour
index numbers:

Pen 2: Paper 4: Print "I am normal"
Inverse On : Print "I am inverse"
Inverse Off : Print "I am normal again"

There are two useful little functions you can play with to
change strings of text, and you may want to make more
practical use of them for handling strings in your own
programs.

			-=- 83 -=- 


=LOWER$
=UPPER$

This pair of functions do what you might expect, by
changing all the characters in a string into lower case
(small letters) or upper case (capital letters). Type in and
run this little routine to see how they work:

    Print Lower$("Easy AMOS")

    Print Upper$("Easy AMOS")


Screen text coordinates
-----------------------
When you tell Easy AMOS to Print some text, the
characters will be printed starting from wherever the
flashing line called the "text cursor" happens to be. For
example, when you begin some fresh printing, characters
appear starting at the top left-hand corner of the screen.
If you think of the screen as being divided up into a grid,
with each line of text forming the horizontal grid lines
and each character space forming the vertical grid lines,
then it is not difficult to think of the positions of each of
the grid spaces having their own reference point. We
call these screen positions the "text coordinates".


To establish the position of a character, the "x-coordinate"
is the number of character spaces from the left-hand side
of the screen, and the "y-coordinate" refers to the number
of spaces from the top of the screen. So the top-left hand
corner would have x,y-coordinates of 0,0. Similarly, the
text coordinates 10,5 refer to a position on the screen that
is 10 characters to the right and five characters down
from the top left-hand corner. You will come across
different sizes of characters and even different sizes of
useable screen, but this general rule applies to them all.

When the screen displays text or graphics that you no
longer want, there is an instant way of wiping the screen
clear.

			-=- 84 -=-


Clearing the screen
-------------------

CLS
This command stands for CLear the Screen, which is
exactly what it does. Print some characters now, then
wipe the screen clean before you give your next print
command, like this:

    Print "A load of rubbish  ": Wait 100

    Cls : Print "ALL CLEAR  ": Wait 100


You can also clear a screen by filling it with your choice
of colour, using an index number from colour zero to the
maximum colour number available. Try doing it now,
like this:

    Print "I've got the blues  ": Wait 200


There is no need to clear the whole screen. If you prefer
to clear part of the screen and leave the rest as it is, you
must type in special x,y-coordinates of the rectangle to
be cleared after you select the colour that will fill it. Tell
Easy AMOS the location of the top-left hand corner of
the new rectangle, then draw this rectangle TO wherever
you want the bottom right-hand corner to be. Cls uses
"graphic coordinates" instead of character coordinates,
and they are explained a little later. Don't forget to put
in the commas, even if you don't specify a particular
colournumber.  For example:

    Print "This is a black out" : Wait 175

    Cls ,80,0 To 120,10


Moving Text
-----------
Sooner or later, you will want to make your text look
more attractive by locating it at various screen positions.
To save you the trouble of measuring out spacings, Easy
AMOS gives you a whole series of simple short cuts.


			-=- 85 -=-

LOCATE
------
This command moves the text cursor to whatever x,y-
coordinates you choose. The new location sets the
starting point for all your text printing until you
command some other position. You are free to save out
the x or the y-coordinate, but remember to use a comma
in place of their location number. So to print at a
particular place on the current line,omit the y-coordinate
and try using something like this:

 Locate 5, : Print "Five from the left"

In the same way, to print at the existing distance across
the screen but on different lines, leave out the x-
coordinate, like this:

 Locate ,6 : Print "Six from the top"

Now experiment by printing at your own choice of
coordinates, anywhere on the screen. For example:

 Locate 7,8 : Print X


More text locations
--------------------
If you need to move the text cursor back to the top left-
hand corner of the screen in a hurry, simply command
it to go Home!

HOME
----
Here is the command that automatically locates the
cursor to coordinates 0,0. Try this now:

  Cls : Locate 10,10 : Print "I am going"

  Home : Print "home"

CENTRE
-------
Centre is another useful command for locating text. In
this case a string of characters is placed at the centre of
the screen on the current cursor line, and you don't have
to use the Print command. For example, type this in:

			-=- 86 -=-

Locate 0, 10

Centre "I am in the centre"

There is a special Easy AMOS function that lets you
change the position of where text is to be printed
whenevera particular string of characters crops up. This
is perfect for things like titles and hi-score tables.

=AT
---
This is the function used to set up this type of character
string, and all you have to do is select the x,y-coordinates
for your characters by placing them in brackets, like this:

    A$=At (10,5) + "Hello"+At(20, 20) + "again"

    Print A$

Once you understand how this works, try positioning
you own title or hi-score string, then call it up with a
single Print statement. For example:

   HI SCORE$=At (5,10) + "Today' s HI SCORE"
   SCORE= 1234
   Print "HI SCORE$"; SCORE



The text cursor
---------------
There will be times when you need to know exactly
where the text cursor is located. Nothing could be easier.

XCURS
YCURS

These two commands are used to act as variables for
holding the current location of your text cursor. So you
can call them up like this:

   Locate 10,10: Print Xcurs

   Locate 20, 20 : Print Ycurs


			-=- 87 -=-

CURS ON
CURS OFF

These two commands can be used if ever you want to
hide the text cursor and redisplay it later on. This will
have no effect at all on your text or other cursors such as
the one used by the mouse. Make the text cursor
disappear and reappear now.


Setting the text cursor
-----------------------
Do you want to change the appearance of the text cursor
and set it to something a bit more personalised?

The shape of the text cursor is made up in exactly the
same way as the shape of any other character: a little grid
of picture elements, called "pixels" for short. A pixel is
the smallest point on your screen that you can
communicate with. Imagine it as a dot with its own
location reference. Each of the pre-set characters that
you see on screen is a little block made up of a grid of
pixels eight across and eight high. You have probably
guessed that you can change the shape of any character,
not only the text cursor, by changing the arrangement of
its pixels. You may also have realised that there is a
much more accurate set of coordinates using pixels
instead of text characters. But for now, let's concentrate
on understanding how pixels make up an individual
character.

Look at this diagram showing the individual pixels that
could make up the letter "A". Next to it, the same
character is represented by numbers.

			-=- 88 -=-


Every pixel that is filled in with the current Pen colour
can be represented by a 1, and every pixel that has
nothing in it except the current Paper colour can be set
with a zero. So the bottom two lines of pixels in the text
cursor grid are filled with ones, and the rest with zeros.
The text cursor character also brings attention to itself by
flashing on and off.

SET CURS
--------
This allows you to set the shape of the text cursor to
anything you want. Change the list of pixels for each
numbered line of the grid using a special code, like this:

   Ll = % 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1

   L2 = % 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0

   L3 = % 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0

   L4 = % 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0

   L5 = % 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0

   L6 = % 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 

   L7 = % 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 

   L8 = % 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Set Curs Ll, L2, L3, L4, L5, L6, L7, L8

If you have typed that in exactly and run it, your text
cursor will have altered shape, and turned into a triangle.
Now try and change its shape to the first letter of your
name. When you've done that, turn it into anything you
want, like a stick man or a rocket.

Try and input this sort of number and make its sequence
begin with zeros, like this:

    L1 = % 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 

			-=- 89 -=- 


Easy AMOS will automatically remove the zeros, and
change the appearance of the number. For example:

   L 1 = % 1 0 0


This is quite normal. Easy AMOS prefers to strip away
these leading zeros in the display, but their values are
completely unchanged.

FLASH
FLASH OFF
---------
If you don't want your text cursor to flash, you can turn
it off and then turn it back on again by using the
commands Flash or Flash Off, like this:

Flash Off: Set Curs Ll, L2, L3, L4, L5, L6, L7, L8


Setting text style
------------------
Time for some fun. You are now going to change the
entire appearance of your text characters by mixing any
one of eight selections that combine these three styles:

  Underline
  Bold
  Italic

You can choose from a range of zero to 7 to mix and
match these style combinations, using the Set Text
command.


SET TEXT
--------
This is the command that changes the appearance of
your text, and all that's needed is a style number to
follow it. Display the available choice now, by typing in
this routine:

Cls: For S=0 To 7: Set Text S

Text 100,S*20+20, "Easy AMOS  ": Next S

			-=- 90 -=-


If you ever need to know which text style is being used
at any time, all you have to do is ask.

=TEXT STYLES

This is the function that reveals theindex reference of the
text style you last selected using Set Text.

  Set Text 2 : Text 50,50, "Style two"

  Print Text Styles

Graphic text
------------
You may have spotted the fact that a new command
called Text has been introduced in those last two
examples, and that the coordinates seem to be much too
wide to fit on the screen. This is because you have started
to use what is known as "graphic text" instead of the
normal pre-set characters, and graphical text is positioned
using x,y-coordinates numbered in pixels, not characters.

All the drawing and graphics operations are explained
in Chapter 8, along with easy-to-use ways of getting the
best out of graphic text. For the moment, try to
understand that there are two different types of font for
use in Easy AMOS. "Text fonts" are used for sets of
characters that can be used by the Print command.
"Graphic fonts" are much more flexible in terms of style,
size and shape.

Now it's time to reveal a little bit of Easy AMOS text
magic.

TEXT FONTS
----------
The designs of the characters that appear on your screen
makes them easy and practical to use and read. In the
old days, sets of characters werecast in metal moulds for
printing onto paper, and each set of designs had its own
font name. If you wanted to change fonts, all you had to
do was design new shapes, carve them into stone, boil
up a cauldron of molten lead and cast each character in
a new mould. It only took a few days.


			-=- 91 -=-

And now for some good news. There are hundreds of
different fonts available for use with Easy AMOS at the
touch of a button!

GET FONTS
SET FONT
----------
Your "Easy AMOS Program Disc" contains new fonts
ready to be used, and as you would expect, each font has
its own index number. The Get Fonts command sets up
a list of the different fonts available on your current disc,
and you must use it before making any changes to font
settings. Then use Set Font to select the style of text to be
used. For example:


For A=0 To 100
   Set Font A: T$="Easy AMOS Font" +Str$ (A)
   Text 50,100, T$
   Wait key: CLS
Next A

In practice, you will probably want to Get Fonts at the
beginning of a program, so that you can use Set Font
later on as many times as you need.

=FONT$
------
If you want Easy AMOS to give you details about the
available fonts, use this function followed by a pair of
brackets containing the font number you are interested
in. Add the following line to the last routine:

   Get Fonts: Set Font 2

   Print Font$(2)

There should now be a report line at the top of the screen
describing font number two, as follows: the name of the
font, the height of the font in pixels and the status set to
either Disc or Rom (meaning held in memory).

			-=- 92 -=-


Adding more fonts
-----------------
Your Amiga "Workbench" disc may well have a whole
range of extra fonts on it, and Easy AMOS is happy to use
them. In addition, there are hundreds of different fonts
available on commercial and public domain discs, and
you may even want to design your own. New fonts can
be installed on your "Easy AMOS Program" disc, and
remember never to use the original, but your own copy
for this purpose! Copy new font files into the FONTS:
directory of the disc.


Clearing fronts from memory
---------------------------
Here is a neat way to clear any fonts from memory that
are not being used. It's a procedure that tries to reserve
a huge amount of memory, and creates an "out of
memory" report. This forces the Amiga to perform a
"garbage collection" which gets rid of your unwanted
fonts automatically.


Procedure WIPE_FONTS
  On Error Goto SKIP
  Erase 15 : Reserve As Work 15,10000000
  SKIP: Resume SKIP2
  SKIP2:
End Proc


Selecting a font by name
------------------------
To see how fonts are selected by name, open the
"Text_Tutorials" folder on your " Easy AMOS Tutorial"
disc, and load this ready-made example:

 Text Tutorial01.AMOS


Creating you own fonts
----------------------
There are two amazing programs on your "Easy AMOS
Examples" disc, that make superb use of home-grown
fonts. First of all load:

 Font Creator.Amos

			-=- 93 -=-

As you can see from the listing, this program will transform a
normal font into a giant graphic font. You can select anything
from simple black and white characters, to cut-outs of fully
coloured pictures2. Whenyou [Run] the Font Creator, youll be
asked to select an available font from your "Easy AMOS
Programs" disc, and then you can enlarge it with a built-in
zoom" facility. Everything is explained on screen or in the
listing.

If you want to see some even more superb effects, load
up this example program next:

  Scrolling Text.AMOS

This demonstration scrolls special effects across your
screen, and is guaranteed to give you some instant fun.
You can use your own fonts, made with the Font Creator,
and all the practical steps are set out in the listing. Any
keywords or programming ideas that you haven't yet
come across will soon be explained in this book.

			Chapter 7

		WORKING WITH THE KEYBOARD

"I like the
keyboards, you
get to sit down
more."
  (Paul McCartney,
          1990)


This Chapter explains some of the tricks of the
programmer's art which control the way information is
printed, and it also explains how you can exploit the
keyboard in your programs. Let's start with a very
simple example:

 Print  "I have been printed"

Now try this:

 ?  "I have also been printed"

PRINT or ?
-----------
The question-mark character acts in exactly the same
way as the Print command, when you use it at the
beginning of a line. Easy AMOS will automatically turn
"?" into "Print" when the line is recognised. The list of
items to be printed can be up to 255 characters long, and
it will appear starting from wherever the text cursor is.
You can break up your list into separate elements by
putting them inside their own pair of quotation marks,
and linking them together with a semi-colon, like this:

 ? "Easy" ; "AMOS"



Moving the text cursor
----------------------
Now change that example by linking your elements
with a comma instead of the semi-colon;

    ? Easy","AMOS"

Using the semi-colon causes your data to be printed
immediately after the previous value, but a comma
moves the cursor to the next "Tab" position on the
screen. A tab is an automatic marker that sets up a
location for printing, and is often used to lay out columns
of figures, or to make indentations in text. The use of the
[Tab] key is explained in a moment.
 
			-=- 96 -=-

"A kiss can be
a question mark
or a comma.
That's the only
punctuation I
ever learned."
(Madonna, 1991)


Normally, the cursor is advanced downwards by one
line after every Print command. But by using the semi-
colon or comma, you can change the rules. Here's an
example:

Print "Easy"

Print "AMOS"

Print "Ea";

Print "sy",

Print "AMOS"



Setting tabs
------------
The [Tab] key is the large key above the [Ctrl] key on the
left-hand side of your keyboard. Go into the Edit Screen,
and try out the [Tab] key now. Every time you press it,
the edit cursor jumps forwards to the next tab marker.
Now press [Shift] and [Tab] together, which causes the
cursor to jump backwards one tab.

To change the tab settings, press [Ctrl] and [Tab] at the
same time, look at the prompt in the Information Line,
type in your choice for a new tab value, and then press
[Returnl. Test out various tab settings now.


Checking for a keypress
-----------------------
As well as using your keyboard for typing in programs,
it can also be used to interact with your routines once
they are running.

=INKEY$
-------
This function checks to see if you have pressed a key, and
reports back its value in a string. For example:

Do

 X$=InkeyS

   If X$<>"" Then Print "You pressed a key!"

 Loop

			-=- 97 -=-

Now use the Inkey$ function to move your cursor
around the screen, like this:

   Print Use your cur~or key~


X$=Inkey$
  If X$<>"" Then Print X$;
Loop

Try typing in characters as well as moving the
cursor, and see what happens. The Inkey$
command doesn't wait for you to input anything
from the keyboard. If a character is not entered, an
empty string is returned.

Inkey$ can only register a key-press from one of
the keys that carries its own Ascii code, and the
Ascii numbers allocated to each character are
explained at the beginning of the last Chapter.
This is fine if you want to use Inkey$ for giving the
value of most key-presses, but what about the keys
that don't carry an Ascii code, such as [Helpl? If
Inkey$ detects a key-press from this type of key, it
will report that it's come across a character with a
value of zero.


=SCANCODE
---------
This function helps to check for keys which don't
cause a character to be printed. It returns a special
key code, known as the "scan code" of a key which
has already been entered using the Inkey$ function.
Try out this example:


			-=- 98 -=-


DO
  While K$=""
    K$=Inkey$
  Wend
  If Asc(K$)=0 Then Print "No ASCii Code"
  Print "The Scancode is";Scancode
  K$=""
Loop

Test out that example by pressing various keys
including [Del], [Help] and the function keys [Fl]
to [F10]. When you have had enough, interrupt the
program by pressing the [Ctrl] and [C] keys at the
same time.


Interrupting a Program
-----------------------

BREAK OFF

If you ever need to turn off the [Ctrl]+[C] facility in
order to stop a program being interrupted while a
particular routine is running, the Break Off
command can be included in your listings. To
restart the interrupt feature, use Break On. But BE
WARNED, never run a program you are still editing
with Break Off activated, or you will lose your
work. Make a back-up copy first. If you insist on
ignoring this advice, try running this:

Break Off
Do
  Print "Get out of that!"
Wait key

			-=- 99 -=-


THE EASY AMOS TYPING TUTOR
--------------------------
Here's a great way to improve your keyboard skills. The
Easy AMOS Typing Tutor not only helps you to improve
the speed of your typing, it also learns how well you are
performing and adapts itself to suit your progress. Load
it from your "Easy AMOS Tutorial" disc now:

  Typing_Tutor.AMOS

Take a look through the listing and read the comments
to see how the program has been organised. There are
two levels, the "Typing Tutor Letter Game" which uses
single key presses, and the "Typing Tutor Phrase Game",
where you have to type in the words or phrases that
appear on screen as fast as possible.

You'll find examples of how Inkey$ and Chr$ are used
with Ascii codes, as well as a simple system for giving
you extra time if you press the wrong key and less time
when you type in the correct character. Although this is
a simple idea, it means that the Typing Tutor will always
push you to your maximum potential!

Don't forget to turn up the volume on your system to
hear the sound effects, and [Run] the game. Select [1]
first, and giant individual letters will appear above a
timer-bar. Your score and speed are displayed at the
bottom of the screen. Keep a record of your best scores,
and see how they improve. Later on in this book, you'll
learn how to include your own hi-score routines and
title pages to turn this sort of practical program into a
proper game. You can always quit a game by pressing
[Esc] or [Ctrl]+[C].

Only the additional routines have been commented in
the "Typing Tutor Phrase Game~ listing. You'll find a
bonus score, and a long list of "Data" statements where
all the phrases to be typed are held. You can change
them if you want. To try your hand at typing in whole
words and phrases, select option [2] when the title
screen appears. Good luck!


			-=- 100 -=-

Keyboard short cuts
-------------------
You have already used several keyboard short-cuts,
such as [F1] to run a program, and the [?] key instead of
typing "Print". Make sure you have saved any important
programs that may be currently in memory, and get
ready to try out some more Easy AMOS techniques.

If it's not in place, load your "Easy AMOS Programs"
disc, go into Direct Mode, and look at the list of twenty
instructions displayed in the panel. You won't recognise
most of them, but they will become familiar as you
progress through later Chapters.

Each of these instructions can be called up from anywhere
in the Easy AMOS system by pressing just two keys.
They can be called while you are in Direct Mode, or if
you are using the Edit Screen, or even from inside an
Easy AMOS program. To select one of these instructions,
you must press one of the [Amiga] keys either side of the
[Spacebar] at the same time as one of the function keys.
By pressing the LEFT [Amiga] key at the same time as
keys lF1] to [F10] the flrst ten instructions are called.
When you press the RIGHT [Amiga] key with keys [F1]
to [F10] the instructions numbered 11 to 20 are given.

For an instant demonstration of this feature, press the
left [Amiga] key and [F3] together. This calls the Dir
command, which prints a directory of all the files held on
your current disc. Now go back to the Edit Screen with
F19, by pressing [F9] and the right [Amiga] key at the
same time.

If you press the left or right [Amiga] key while in the Edit
Screen, the same definitions will appear in the edit area.

Are you ready to go graphical? Then you're going to
enjoy the next Chapter!

			Chapter 8


			GRAPHICS

"Art is a lie."
(Pablo Picasso, 1958)


Welcome to the artists Chapter.


You are a computer-graphics artist! Your electronic
canvas is 320 pixels wide and 200 pixels high. Your
artist's palette can hold several pots of ink, and there are
over four thousand bottles of different colours waiting
in the art shop. So clear your canvas now with a Cls
command, and get ready to create instant computer
graphics with Easy AMOS.


GRAPHIC COORDINATES
-------------------
Every artist wants to put the right blob of colour at the
right point on the canvas,to make up shapes and patterns.
As a computer artist, you need to know the coordinates
of each available pixel. You should already be familiar
with the idea of x,y-coordinates, and as long as you don't
confuse graphic coordinates with text coordinates all
will be well.

PLOT
----
This is the straightforward command for filling a single
pixel with whatever colour is ready to use on your
electronicbrush. Plota point now, whereveryou choose
on the electronic screen, using any graphic x,y-
coordinates between 0,0 and 319,199 like this:

 Plot 160, lO0

Now give your screen a different coloured pimple. All
you have to do is set the graphic coordinates, then
specify the number of one of your paint pots, and see
what colour is in it. For example:

 Plot 160, 100, 6

Not very exciting is it. Never mind. Try giving the
screen animated bubonic plague! Copy the next routine
exactly, and then run it. It uses a new command called
Rnd, which makes things happen at random.

			-=- 104 -=-


Don't worry how that works for now, put your trust in
Easy AMOS and take it for granted that paint pots
numbered from zero to 15 are to be used for throwing
colour all over the screen at random. Here goes:

Curs Off : Flash Off
Do
  Plot Rnd(319),Rnd(199),Rnd(15)
Loop

Later in this Chapter, you can learn how to change the
colours in your ink pots, and use them for instant graphic
effects. As for now, there should be sixteen different
colours speckling all over the screen in a random mess.
It would be impossible to establish what colour is sitting
at any coordinate simply by looking at the screen, so
Easy AMOS gives you a command to help.

=POINT
------
This is the command used to tell you the index number
of the colour occupying the x,y-coordinates. Try this
example:

  Plot 160,100

  Print The colour is;Point(160,100)


Drawing lines
-------------

DRAW

Line drawing is extremely simple. Pick two sets of
coordinates, and use them to tell Easy AMOS to Draw a
line from one To the other, like this:

 Draw 50,50 To 250,150

If you want to draw a line from wherever the graphics
cursor is set at the moment, just give the Draw To
command followed by a single set of coordinates. For
example:

 Draw To 275,175

			-=- 105 -=-

When you have done that, experiment with line drawing
anywhere on the screen, like this:

Draw 10,0 To 319,199

Draw To 275,50

Draw To 0,199

Line styles
-----------
Changing the style of straight lines is very simple. You
may remember that there is a way to make sure which
pixels are to be filled and which pixels are to remain
empty, using the twin or "binary" numbers zero and one,
and that a binary number can be introduced by using the
% symbol.

SET LINE
---------
This command tells the Amiga what style of line you
want to create, using a binary number made up of 16
Ubits". So a normal line, with no gaps in it, can be
imagined as a binary number where all the bits are set to
ONEs, like this:

 %1111111111111111 

But as soon as you introduce ZEROs into the pattern,
you set up a dotted line for your drawing operations.
Experiment with your own patterns, along these lines:

 Set Line %1100000101010011

 Draw To 319,199

 Draw 160,0 To 160,199

 Draw 0,100 To 319,100

			-=- 106 -=-

Try this example, which draws a range of spider's webs:

Flash Off : Palette 0, $FFF

SPIDERWEB:

Cls 0

Pen 1: Paper 0

Locate 0, 0

Input "Enter a number between 5 and 50." ;S

Curs Off

If S<5 or S>50 Then Goto SPIDERWEB

Cls 0

' This is where the web is drawn

' using variable S from Input

For Y=0 to 200 Step S

  Plot 0,Y

  Draw To Y, 200

Next Y

Locate 10, 3 : Print "Press a key to";

Locate 10, 4: Print "spin another web!;

wait Key

Goto SPIDERWEB


The first time you weave your web, input the number "5", and
draw a dense pattern Then try and understand why the
pattern is so expanded when you input "50". Experimentby
changing the Plot coordinates to something like:

Plot 100, Y

Draw To Y, 150

and input "5" again, to see how your web has been twisted.
Now use Set Line to change the style of your web strands.


			-=- 107 -=-


Drawing shapes
--------------
Here are some Easy AMOS short-cuts for drawing line
shapes on the screen. You can even use Set Line with the
first one, called Box.

BOX

draws the outline of a rectangle, from wherever you set
the coordinates of the top left-hand corner To the bottom
right-hand corner. For example:

    Set Line %1010101010101010

    Box 50,50 To 275,100


When it comes to circles and ellipses, graphic coordinates
are used in much the same way. This time, the x,y-
coordinate sets the centre point around which your
shape is going to be drawn. The "radius" is the distance
from the centre of the shape to the "circumference" or
rim of the shape, and it is set by giving the number of
pixels making up that distance. Obviously, a circle only
has one radius, but an ellipse has two: one for the radius
from the centre of the ellipse to its nearest side and one
for the radius from the centre to its furthest side.

			-=- 108 -=-


CIRCLE
ELLIPSE

Draw a circle now, by setting the coordinates of its
centre, followed by the length of its radius. Then draw
an ellipse in the same way, not forgetting to set the
length of both the short and the long radius. Try this
example:

 Circle 100,100,45

 Ellipse 250,90,30,70


With drawing commands, remember that if you leave
out the coordinates from where the shape is to be drawn,
it will appear from the current cursor position. You still
have to include the correct number of commas, like this:

   Draw 0,100 To 160,100

   Circle ,,45


Setting the graphics cursor
---------------------------
GR LOCATE

The graphics cursor sets the starting point for drawing
operations. Gr Locate places the graphics cursor at the
x,y-coordinates you choose, in the usual way. Try out
this example:

X=150 : Y=10
For R=3 To 87 Step 3
   Gr Locate X,Y+R
   Circle ,,R
Next R

			-=- 109 -=-


Setting graphics areas
----------------------
CLIP

This command is used to mark out an invisible
rectangular area of the screen using the usual graphic
coordinates, so that all drawing operations will be clipped
off when they reach the boundaries of the rectangle. To
restore the normal screen display, simply use Clip again,
leaving out the coordinates. Areas that are preserved
outside the clip zone can be used for items such as
borders and control panels. To see how this works,
insert the following line at the beginning of that last Gr
Locate example, and see what effect it has on the circles:

 Clip 100, 30 To 205,140

Colour
------
One of the best features of Easy AMOS is the way it gives
you the freedom to exploit your Amiga's superb colour-
handling features. The next part of this chapter tells you
how.


Choosing colours
----------------
So far, you have been stuck with a pre-set colour for your
ink. The next command explains how to take control
and change ink colours to your own preferences.

INK
---
This is the command for filling the ink pot you are using
with your choice of colour from a selection of zero to 64
colournumbers. Forexample:

   Ink 5

   Draw to 319,199

The Ink command can also be used to set colours for
borders around shapes and whatever fills up those
shapes, and this will be explained later. Before that, you
should understand how different colours are mixed.


			-=- 110 -=-

Mixing colours
---------------
Every shade of colour displayed on a television set or a
monitor is composed of various mixtures of the same
three primary colours: Red, Green and Blue, or "RGB"
for short. There is a range of 16 strengths available for
each of the RGB levels in every colour. A zero level is
equivalent to "none" of that colour, in other words
"black", and the maximum intensity is the equivalent of
"all" of that colour.

Because there are three separate components each with
16 possible strengths, the maximum range of shades
available is 16 times 16 times 16, which equals 4096
possible colours!

The Amiga likes to recognise colours by their RGB
components. Unfortunately, it isn't too keen on the
normal decimal system of numbers, which we have
evolved based on the ten digits we carry around at the
end of our arms, known as our "fingers". Your computer
prefers to use a system called Hexadecimal ", based on 16
digits. Of course, we haven't got 16 different numbers
to match up with this way of thinking, so we use all the
numbers we have, plus a few letters to make up the
difference. Look at this table and try to get familiar with
hexadecimals. The top line shows digits in the
hexadecimal system, ~hex" for short, and the bottom line
shows the decimal equivalent.


    HEXDIGIT 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0  A  B  C  D  E  F

    DECIMAL  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16

It is not difficult to take a look at what colours are sitting
in your first 16 ink pots, and find out how much Red,
Blue and Green is being used to make up each colour.

			-=- 111 -=-

=COLOUR
-------
This function takes an ink pot index number enclosed in
brackets from zero to 31, and tells you what colour value
is sitting in that pot. Try and understand what this
routine is doing when you ask the Colour function to
report on a hexadecimal string of colour value. We use
Hex$ for this purpose, in the following way:

Curs Off: Flash Off

For C = 0 to 15: Ink c

  Print Hex$ (Colour (C), 3)

  Circle 160, 75 , 10+C

Next C


There should now be a list of 16 colour values in hex
code, alongside a bunch of 16 circles using those colours.
Every hex number is introduced by a dollar sign. $ is not
only used to represent a "string". When used with
numbers like this, it introduces a hex number for the
Amiga to recognise. So wheneveryou usea hexnumber,
always put a $ in front of it.

Look at the first hex value, and the innermost circle. Sure
enough, $000 means that there is no Red, no Green and
no Blue component in ink pot number 0. It is drawn with
black ink.

Here are some other values, which should be easy to
understand if you refer back to the hex digit/decimal
table above.

  COLOUR HEX VALUE RGB COMPONENTS

  Green  $0FO      R=0 G=F B=0
  White  $FFF	   R=F G=F B=F
  Violet $FOF      R=F G=0 B=F
  Sickness $A91    R=A G=9 B=1

			-=- 112 -=-


'You can have
any colour you
want, so long
as it's black!'
   (Henry Ford,
        1924)

If that is clear, you are ready to mix your own coloured
ink and pour it into whatever ink pot you want. There
are 32 pots, called "colour registers" waiting on your
palette.

COLOUR
------
This command is used to set a new colour ready for use.
Follow the command with the colour index number,
then the new hex value introduced by the $ symbol, like
this: $RGB. Run this example from Direct mode:

 Colour 0, $FF0

If you have made that last example work, colour register
zero no longer holds black ink, but bright yellow.
Experiment with mixing your own shades now, and try
loading them into different ink pots.

COLOUR BACK

This command is used to set the background colour of
the screen, that is to say, the areas of screen that are not
in use, such as the very top and bottom. The $RGB value
is set in hex as usual, so try changing the background
colour now, like this:

 Colour Back $666

Instead of mixing new colours, existing colours can also
be used, like this:

 Colour Back Colour (1)


Setting several colours
-----------------------
Spectacular effects can be achieved by multicolour
changes, but assigning individual colours to every paint
pot would be a tedious business. Never fear, Easy
AMOS has a suitable short cut.

PALETTE
-------
This is a much more powerful command than Colour, and it
can be used to set as many or as few colours in your artists
palette as are needed. Your program always starts off using a
list of pre pr~grammed or "default~ colours sitting in the
existing palette. Run this line now, then draw something on
the screen:

 Palette , $F00

The second palette collour has changed to red, but all the other
colours retain their original settings. Now try this routine,
which changes the first five colours in the palette with a
hexadecimal poem, and displays the result on the screen. If
you don't like the colours or the poetry, feel free to change the
values!

 Pa1ette $FAB, $F1B, $BAD, $0DD, $B0D

Curs off: Flash off

For c=0 To 4: Ink C
   Print Hex$ (Colour(c),3)
   Bar 50,8*C To 150, 8*C+8
Next C

There is a new command in that last example called Bar,which
is a good introduction to the next section. Reset your colours
now, by getting rid of any of your new Palette commands,
before you go on.

Filled shapes
-------------
You should now be familiar with drawingbasic shapes, and
setting choices of colour. The next stage explains how to
combine these skills.

PAINT
-----
Using this command will fill any section of your screen with
a solid block of colour. All you have to do is include this
command in your program, followed by a set of coordinates
located anywhere inside the area of screen you want to paint
with the current ink colour. Try this:

			-=- 114 -=-



 Palette 0, $f00

 Circle 160,100,50

 Paint 50,50

If that has worked properly, you have just drawn the Japanese
national flag on screen.

BAR
---
This is used to draw solid bars of colour by setting up the top 
left-hand graphic coordinates to the bottom right hand coordinates 
in the normal way like this:

  Bar 50,50 to 125,175

Shapes with many sides are called polygons, and Easy AMOS lets
you draw coloured shapes with as many sides as you want, using a 
single command.

POLYGON
-------
The polygon command sets up any size and shape if you tell it the
coordinates for the beginning and end of each on of its sides as 
usual. If the first pair of graphic coordinates is left out, then your
shape will begin from the current graphic cursor position. Try and
build up different geometric shapes like this:

 Polygon To 250,150 to 135,175 to 200,75

Now fill the screen with intergalactic stalagmites by running the
next routine, using random colours, coordinates, heights and widths 
of triangles. When youve seen enough, try changing the values of the
numbers in brackets...

   Do
     Ink Rnd(15)
     X1 = Rnd(250) : Y1=Rnd(150)
     B  = Rnd(200) : W = Rnd(150)
     Polygon = X1,Y1 to X1+W,Y1 to X1+W/2, Y1+H To X1,Y1
   Loop

			-=- 115 -=-

Type in and [Run] this example, which creates a mosaic
pattern with painted grids ranging from red through to
blue. See how it makes use of the graphic commands
Palette, Ink, Plot, Draw To and Paint:

  Curs Off : Cls 0 : Flash Off
  Rem Type in next line as one long line

  P=P+l
  Wait Vbl
  Screen Swap
  Next D
  Ink 15
  Paint 0,0
  Ink O
  Paint XA,YA

			-=- 116 -=-

SET PAINT
---------
This is a simple command that switches outlines on and
off for any shapes drawn with Polygon and Bar
instructions. Follow Set Paint with a value of 1, and
borders appear in the previous Ink colour. Follow it
with a zero and you are back to normal, with no borders
showing. For example:

        Ink 0,1,2 : Set Paint 1

        Bar 5,5 To 200,100

	Set Paint 0: Bar 210,75 To 310,190


More inking
-----------
Look at the three numbers that follow the Ink command
in that last example. After the number that sets the new
ink colour there are two more settings.

INK
---
The Ink command can also have optional settings for
paper and border colours. You don't have to set them,
as long as commas are used in the right place. The paper
colour sets a background colour that will be used for any
filling-in patterns. The border colour selects what colour
is used for any outline borders on bars and polygons.
Try using the following settings in turn for drawing
bars, and see the effect, one after the other:

  Ink 3 : Rem Set ink colour
  Ink ,,5 : Rem Set border outline only
  Ink 0,8,2 : Rem Set ink,back,border
  Ink 6,13 : Rem Set ink and background


Filling shapes
--------------
Filling shapes with plain colours is all very well, but
Easy AMOS allows for a much wider choice of filling
effects.

			-=- 117 -=-


SET PATTERN
-----------
This is used to select from a whole range of pattern
numbers. The normal or "default" state of affairs fills
shapes with the current ink colour, and is set with a zero,
like this:

  Set Pattern 0

If Set Pattern is followed by a POSITIVE number from 1
to 34, shapes are filled from a ready-made selection of
patterns. Take a look at them now by running this
routine:

    Do
      For n = 0 to 34
        Set Pattern N
        Ink 0,1,2 : Set Paint 1
        Bar 50,50 To 150,150
        Locate 0,0 : Print N;" "
	Wait 50
      Next n
    Loop


If Set Pattern is followed by a NEGATIVE number,
shapes are filled by an image held in a special memory
bank. These images go by the name of "Bobs", and "Bob"
images can be very complicated. So in order to use them
as a fill pattern, the Set Pattern command automatically
simplifies their colouring and their dimensions. The
whole of the next Chapter is devoted to "Bobs", so wait
until you understand them before trying Set Pattern
with a negative number. For the moment, let's take a
look at some ways of changing the appearance of
graphics.

			-=- 118 -=-

Overwriting styles
------------------
When graphics are drawn, they normally get "written"
over what is already on the screen. But there are four
alternative drawing modes that change the way graphics
appear, and they can be used one at a time, or combined
to generate a whole range of effects.

GR WRITING

This command is used to set the various modes used for
drawing lines, shapes, filled shapes and graphical text.
There are several alternative modes which can be used
singly or combined to create dozens of different effects.

Settings are made using a "bit pattern", where the
following values give the following results:

Bit 0=0 only draws graphics using the current INK
        colour.

Bit 0-1 replaces ANY existing graphics with new
        graphics.

Bit 1=1 changes old graphics that OVERLAP with new
        graphics.

Bit 2=1 reverses ink and paper colours creating
        INVERSE VIDEO.

The normal drawing state is where new graphics
overwrite old graphics, and replace them. Like this:

Ink 2,5 : Text 100,80,  "NORMAL TEXT"
Wait 100 : Gr Writing 1
Text  100,80,REPLACE

By setting the Gr Writing bit pattern to zero, only new
graphics that are set to the current INK colour will be
drawn. This allows you to merge new graphics with an
existing background. Try this example:

Ink 2,5 : Text 100,80,"NORMAL TEXT"
Wait 100 : Gr Writing O
Text 100,80, "MERGED"


			-=- 119 -=-


The next examples reverse an image before it is drawn,
creating INVERSE VIDEO effects. Add the following
lines to the last example to see the result.

   Wait 100 : Gr Writing 4
   Text 100,90,  "STENCIL"
   Wait 100 : Gr Writing 5
   Text 100,100,"REVERSE"

Experiment now with your own values, and see what
effect the various overwriting techniques can provide.


Flashing
--------
Now for something flashy. You will have noticed during
your programming that colour number 3 automatically
flashes on and off. You also came across the Flash Off
and Flash commands when you were learning about the
text cursor.

FLASH
-----
is a command that can do much more than affect colour
number 3. When Flash is followed by the index number
of any colour, that colour will have animated flashing
every time it is used, until you command the program
otherwise. What's more, you can flash between as many
as 16 colours, and set the flash rate to any length that
pleases you. It works like this:

  Flash 1,"(0A0,50)(F0F,50)"

Let's decode that line of program. The colour to be
affected follows the Flash command, in this case colour
number 1. After the comma, the set of quotation marks
can contain up to 16 pairs of brackets, and inside each
pair of brackets there are two components. Each pair of
brackets represents the colour that is next on the list to be
flashed, and how long it will appear for. Colour is set in
RGB component values, like the ones in the right-hand
column of the table earlier in this chapter. Delay time is
set in 50ths of a second.


			-=- 120 -=-

So the last example has the effect of flashing colour
number one between a green value and a violet value
once every second. See if you can create some special
effects using this method, such as flashes of lightning
and starbursts. Don't forget Flash Off to prevent these
experiments affecting other parts of your programs.


Rainbows
--------
The electronic canvas of a computer artist doesn't have
to be blank or boring. Imagine painting on shadows and
rainbows! The next command lets you do both.


Copy and run the following program, then get ready to
understand how it works. It could be the opening scene
of your first artistic production. Where it says "MY
NAME presents", you are welcome to insert your own
name!

  Set Rainbow 0,1,16,"(1,1,15)","",""

  Rainbow 0,56,1,255

  Curs Off : Flash Off

  Locate .12 : Centre "MY NAME presents"

  Wait Key


SET RAINBOW
-----------
This command creates a sort of Venetian blind effect
which alternates light and shade and can create some
excellent rainbows. It works with these parameters, in
the following order:

Set Rainbow is followed by an identification number
for this rainbow, then a colour index number, then the
length of the colour storage table, then the "(Red
string)","(Green string)","(Blue string)"


Look at your last example, and identify each part of the
Set Rainbow process as they are explained.

			-=- 121 -=-

The rainbow identification number can be between zero
and 3. In other words, you can set up to four different
rainbows for later use, and number them 0,1, 2 or 3.
Your example sets rainbow number zero.

The colour index number sets the colour to be affected
by the rainbow.


Next is the colour storage table size, which can range
from 16 all the way up to 65500, with each unit ready to
hold one "scan" line of colour. If this value is less than the
actual height of your rainbow, the colour pattern gets
repeated down the screen.

Finally, the Red, Blue and Green components of the
rainbow are set up as "strings", each within their own
(brackets). Your example leaves out any reference to the
Green and Blue components, which is why your rainbow
effect is completely in the Red. The three values in
brackets represent this:

  (number,step,count).

  Number refers to the number of lines assigned to one
  colour value. Think of it as controlling the "speed" of
  the sequence.

  Step is a value to be added to the colour, which
  controls the change in this colour.

  Count is simply the number of times this whole
  process iS performed.

The best way to understand all this is to change the
values in the Set Rainbow line of the example, and see
what happens.


			-=- 122 -=-


RAINBOW
-------
Now for the command that is used to display one of your
rainbows on screen. Again, let's work through its parameters
in order of appearance. They run like this

    Rainbow number,base,vertical position, height

The rainbow number should be obvious, and refers to one of
four possible patterns created with Set Rainbow.

The base number is a sort of offset value for the first colour in
the Set Rainbow table, and it governs the cycling or repetition
of the rainbow on screen.

The vertical position is a coordinate with a minimum value of
40, and it affects the starting point of the rainbow's display,
vertically, on the screen.

Finally,the height number sets the rainbow's vertical height in
screen "scan" lines.

It is worth knowing that only one rainbow at a time can be
displayed at a particular scanline, andt he one with the lowest
identification  number will normally be drawn in front of any
others.

RAINBOW DEL
-----------
This is short for rainbow delete. The Rainbow Del comrnand
will get rid of all rainbows that have been set up. If you add a
rainbow identity number, then only that particular rainbow
will be flushed down the electronic toilet. For example:

 Rainbow Del 0

RAlN
----
is a very power ful rainbow instruction, because it allows you
to change the colour of any rainbow line to any value you
choose. Rain must be followed by a pair of brackets containing
the number of the rainbow to be changed and the scan line
number that is to be affected, like this

  Rain (number, line)=colour

			-=- 123 -=-

"Enjoy a rainbow
without
forgetting
the forces that
made it. "
   (Mark Twain,
        1897)


The next example works in the following way. Rainbow
number 1, with colour index 1, is given a colour table
length of 4097 (one entry for every colour value that will
be on the screen). The RGB values are left blank, to be set
up by the first For. . .Next routine that contains the Rain
command. The second For...Next routine uses Rainbow
to display a pattern 255 lines long, starting at scan line
40. Do. . .Loop is used to repeat this process.

Curs Off : Centre "OVER THE RAINBOW"
Set Rainbow 1,1,4097,"","",""
For l = 0 to 4095
  Rain(1,L)=L
Next l  
Do
  For C=0 To 4095-255 Step 4
    Rainbow 1,C,40,255
    Wait Vbl
  Next C
Loop


The stage is fast approaching when your graphics
programming will cease to be a bunch of little exercises,
and you will have the confidence to start linking several
routines together to create original computer art. Many
of the techniques you can already use will play a part in
creating electronic backdrops, instruction panels, title
screens, and special effects, no matter what sort of
computer programs you are interested in. Easy AMOS
can help you release your creative talents, and if you still
think that your efforts so far don't begin to compare with
your favourite programs, think again.


			-=- 124 -=-

The last part of this Chapter deals with some practical
information before you enter the incredible world of
animated computer graphics. It will be worth your
while to read through it, if you have any intention of
mixing text and graphics in your own programs.


Converting coordinates
----------------------
When text and graphics need to be displayed at the same
time, you want to be able to relate both the text coordinates
and the graphic coordinates together. As you already
know they use two different systems, so Easy AMOS
provides instant conversion functions.


=X TEXT
=Y TEXT

Supposing you want some text to hit a certain graphic
target. All you need to do is tell the commands X Text
and Y Text the graphic coordinates you are interested in,
like this:

Circle 116,99,45

X=X Text(116) : Y=Y Text(99)

Locate X,Y

Print +

=TEXT LENGTH
------------
Use this function to discover the graphical length of a
string of characters. This is important when different
sized fonts are involved, and you need to know exactly
how many pixels wide a string of text will be.

T$= "Easy AMOS
L=Text Length(T$)
Print L

			-=- 125 -=-


=TEXT BASE
----------
This is used in much the same way to work out the
height of the "baseline" of the current font. The baseline
is the number of pixels from the top of a character set,
down to the point where the characters sit on the screen.
Obviously, letters that have little tails on them (g, j, p, q
and y) dangle below the baseline.

  Get Fonts : Set Font 2

  Print Text Base


Because graphical text fonts have various shapes and
sizes, the Print command cannot be used to position
graphical text on screen. Once Text Base has revealed
the baseline of a font, this can be used as a graphic
coordinate.

TEXT
---
Is the command that prints a string of text at graphic x,y-
coordinates. So your text can be printed at any pixel
position on screen. Like this:

 Text 123,123, That's all folks
