			Chapter 9

			  BOBS

"There's a little
red faced man,
which is Bobs."
  (Rudyard Kipling,
          1901)

This is where Easy AMOS takes off and flies through the
realms of computer animation. The good news is that
you are at the controls! Anyone who has skipped
straight to this Chapter can hardly be blamed, it contains
some of the most spectacular tools in the Easy AMOS
treasure chest.

BLITTER OBJECTS
---------------
Your Amiga contains a chip that goes by the name of the
"Blitter". This can copy images to a screen at a rate of
almost one million pixels per second, which allows
highly professional moving graphics to be displayed.
Easy AMOS uses the Blitter to create moveable graphics
called "Blitter OBjects", or Bobs for short.

Bobs can be moved around the screen without affecting
any other existing graphics. They can feature up to 64
colours and there is no limit to their number, apart from
the amount of memory available. You can control them,
track them and give them special characteristics if they
collide with one another. Best of all, a Bob can be
animated to make moving cartoon characters or lumps
of exotic machinery, flying text, intergalactic phenomena,
in fact anything that your imagination can dream up.

The bob bank
------------
Bobs are held in special blocks of computer memory
called "banks". Several different banks can be used, but
Memory Bank 1 is always reserved to hold your Bob
data. Once they have been set up, you can deposit and
withdraw Bobs from any suitable bank, to use ready-
made designs, adapt existing ones and best of all, you
can create your own design images.  

There's a whole host of Bobs waiting to be called up on
your "Easy AMoS Tutorial" disc, so make sure that this
disc is in your disc drive and let's display a Bob now!


			-=- 128 -=-

Displaying a BOB
----------------
The following program loads a Bob file from your "Easy
AMOS Tutorial" disc. After removing the cursor and
stopping colour 3 from flashing, the screen's palette is
set to the palette used by the Bob, and then the screen is
cleared to display colour zero. You then position Bob
number 1 at selected x,y coordinates, using "image
number 1" from the Bob Bank. This is explained in detail
later. Finally, the program waits for a screen "vertical
blank". Here goes:

Load "Easy_Examples:Bobs/Baby_AMOS.Abk"

Curs Off : Flash Off

Get Bob Palette

Bob 1,160,130,1

Wait Vbl

Our favourite cartoon character should now be displayed
on screen, ready to stride through this Chapter. The
Bobs Chapter is split into two sections. The first part is
a guided tour of the Easy AMOS Bob Editor, which is an
amazing electronic tool-kit for creating, transforming
and animating Bobs, simply by selecting options from
the screen with the mouse! The second part of this
Chapter includes all the Bob commands you will need
for making the best use of your own creations in your
own programs.

Loading the bob editor
-----------------------
The best way to understand the Bob Editor is to go right
ahead and use it. It's ready and waiting on your "Easy
AMOS Programs" disc. You can select [Bob Editor] from
the Systems Menu by pressing [Shift] and [F7] together.
Alternatively, make sure that your "Easy AMOS
Programs" disc is loaded, and select the following
program using the File Selector:

Bob_Editor.AMOS


			-=- 129 -=-


When you select the Bob Editor from the Systems Menu,
any program you are working on that is still in the main
editor will be saved to disc before the Bob Editor is
loaded and run automatically.

The Bob Editor is jam packed full of data. In fact it
contains so many features that they won't all fit in the
amount of memory reserved for the editingbuffer if you
load the Bob Editor using the File Selector. Don't worry,
the Information Line will display a message and ask you
to press [Yles to change the buffer size. When this
happens,simplypress [Y] and then [Run] theBobEditor.


Setting up
----------
Welcome to the Main Menu Screen of the Bob Editor.
Before you go any further, let's load some Bobs into the
Bob Editor so that you have something practical to work
on. For the rest of this Chapter, everything you need is
on the "Easy AMOS Tutorial" disc, so have it ready in
your disc drive now. For the time being, simply follow
these instructions, all will be explained in detail as you
progress through this Chapter.

Look at the line of boxed images at the top of the screen.
In the top left-hand corner is a panel that says "EASY
BOB ED". Next to that is a panel that displays a picture
of a disc drive. Click on the disc drive box with your left
mouse button, and leave the mouse cursor exactly where
it is.

A new range of images should now be displayed at the
top of the screen, and next to the image of a "pointing
finger" click on the box that shows a floppy disc with an
arrow pointing to the right towards a "storage bank~,
using the left mouse button.

A file selector should now appear headed "Choose a Bob
bank". Select the folder marked "*Bobs", then load the
"Baby AMOS.Abk~ file. The Main Menu Screen will
now fill with various Bob images.

			-=- 130 -=-


After this happens, move your mouse pointer to
anywhere in the top line of images, and click on your
RIGHT mouse button. You are now ready to work some
small wonders, so let's get going!


The Main Menu Screen
--------------------
The illustration shows each part of the screen marked
with a number, for easy reference. Please identify each
of the numbered zones as they are explained.

			-=- 131 -=-


1.MAJOR OPTIONS
---------------
The line of large icons across the top of the screen
represents all the major ways of importing, handling
and exporting bobs.

2.INFORMATION LINE
------------------
This line gives a running commentary on what's
happening. It tells you how much memory is
available, reminds you what you are doing, and
provides helpful prompts while creating graphic
marvels.

3.DRAWING TOOLS
---------------
Each of the smaller icons provides one of the special
drawing tools for creating and changing the
appearance of Bobs.

4.MOUSE COLOURS
---------------
The first two double-height colour blocks show the
colours currently used by the LEFT and RIGHT
mouse buttons when drawing. The third colour
block shows the colour currently used when BOTH
mouse buttons are pressed when drawing.

5.COLOUR PALETTE
----------------
A vertical display of all the colours in the current
palette. The number of colours depends on what sort
of "resolution" you are in, and if 64 colours are
available, then colours numbered from 32 to 63 will
appear side by side of colours 0 to 31. To select a
colour, place the mouse pointer over your choice,
and click the left or right button. You can even select
a THIRD colour by pressing BOTH mouse buttons
together, and use that colour in the same way, by
pressing both buttons. Of course, if you have a
mouse with three buttons, choosing and using a
third colour is easier. Select a pair of contrasting
colours now, such as white and bright red.

6.CURRENT DISPLAY
-----------------
The box near the top right of the screen reports on the
fill pattern that is ready for use. Place the mouse
pointer inside it now and run through all the fill
patterns available, using the LEFT button to move
forwards or the RIGHT button to go backwards
through the list. The coordinates of the mouse pointer
are also displayed in the middle of this box when you
edit Bobs.

7.BANK DISPLAY
--------------
Bobs held in the "bank" are displayed here, underneath
their own number. Each Bob is shrunk in size so that
you can view all of it in the display. A Bob is selected
for attention by clicking the mouse pointer on it, and
its number becomes HIGHLIGHTED. Any Bob that
is currently being edited is marked with a STAR in
front of its number.

8.BANK SLIDER
-------------
Because there can be dozens of Bobs in the bank, and
there is only space to view a few of them at a time, this
slider is pulled up and down with the mouse pointer
to display other Bobs in the bank. Use it now to view
all the Bobs currently loaded.

9.SCREEN SIZER
--------------
Drag this bar to the left or right using the mouse
pointer, if you need to change the proportions of the
edit screen. The right-hand zone is the EDIT window,
the left-hand zone is the ZOOM area where you can
view your work in close-up.

10.ZOOM WINDOW
--------------
This is the area that displays a blow-up version of the
Bob. It is provided to allow greater accuracy and ease
of use while editing your work . The zoom is normally
set to twice the size of the original graphics, and there
is an option to make this four times the size, which is
explained later.


			-=- 133 -=-



11.EDIT WINDOW
--------------
Like the Zoom Window, this is a work area. The
mouse pointer changes to a cross when inside either
the Zoom Window or the Edit Window, and drawing
operations will have the same result in both windows
no matter which one is being used.

12.VERTICAL ZOOM
----------------
When the Zoom Window is unable to show all of the
Edit Window, this slider indicates other available
areas of the Bob. By moving the slider vertically,
these areas are displayed in the Zoom Window.

13.HORIZONTAL ZOOM
------------------
This has the same function and operation as the
Vertical Zoom, and moves the display horizontally.

14.SIZER
--------
The size of the current Bob is displayed in the
Information Line. To change the size of a Bob, lock
the mouse pointer on this gadget and drag it to a new
position. You can have Bobs as large as 320 pixels
wide by 200 pixels high, if memory allows. Obviously,
you should keep the boundary size of Bobs as tight as
possible, to save memory.


MAJOR OPTIONS
-------------
Here is your guided tour of all the Major Options in the
Bob Editor, as they appear from left to right along the top
line of the Main Menu. Please try out each option as you
go along, by clicking the left mouse button on the icon
shown in the page margin. This will take you to the
appropriate Sub Menu.

You can get back to the Main Menu by clicking the left
mouse button on the top-left icon on the screen, or by
clicking the right mouse button anywhere along the top
line of icons. For most operations, stick to the left mouse
button, unless told otherwise. If your "Easy AMOS
Tutorial" disc is still in its drive, you are ready to begin.


			-=- 134 -=-

DISC OPERATIONS
---------------
As soon as you click on this option, the original disc icon
appears at the top left-hand corner of the screen, and five
new icons are revealed along the top of the screen. From
left to right, they perform the following wonders:

Load New Bank from Disc
------------------------
This prepares the Bob Editor to load a new bank of Bob
images. A series of helpful messages is provided in the
information line, and AMOS himself makes an
appearance to ensure that you make the right decisions.
If the "Easy AMOS Tutorial" disc is ready in its disc drive,
click on this icon, and then trigger the [YES] option. A
file listing will appear, with the request:

  Choose a Bob bank

You will normally make your choice by clicking on the
folder of Bobs, choosing the file of Bobs that takes your
fancy and confirming your choice by clicking on the
[OK] option. The Bobs will load automatically, and you
will return to the main Edit Screen. If you have already
loaded "Baby AMOS.Abk", simply click on [Quit] to
return to the Bob Editor. Please try to resist the temptation
of exploring icons at random, and take a little time to
follow this guided tour step by step.

Merge New Bank
--------------
This is used to insert a complete new bank of Bob images
at the position of the selected Bob in the current bank.
Experiment with this option, and merge a new bank of
Bobs with your existing Bobs. Use exactly the same
method as you did for loading your original choice, but
select a different file of Bob images. When you return to
the Edit Screen, click on the slider bar to the right of the
vertical block of Bobs on screen, and run it up and down
to display the current Bob images in memory. You can
see where the new bank has been merged with the
original bank. The Colour Palette will change to the
palette used by the newly merged bank of Bob images.

			-=- 135 -=-

Save Bank
---------
Please DO NOT use this option while your "Easy AMOS
Examples" or "Easy AMOS Tutorial" discs are in the disc
drive! To save edited Bobs, insert a suitable WORK disc
such as the one you were asked to label "My Programs",
and get ready to save the current bank of Bob images.
This option will display a file selector if your Bob bank
has no name. When you are satisfied, save the current
bank to the appropriate disc for later use, by following
the simple on-screen instructions.

Save As
-------
Once again, only use a WORK disc such as
"My Programs" when experimenting with this option.
Unlike Save Bank, when you select Save As, a file
selector will always be displayed before saving the
current bank to the appropriate disc. As with all of these
options, Easy AMOS will give you plenty of opportunity
to change your mind or [Quit] at any time during the
current process. So there is never any need to panic if
you make a mistake.

Grab Palette
------------
When this icon is selected you won't see anything happen
immediately,but the colour palette will be automatically
updated to the colours of the new bank, when that bank
is loaded or merged. If you do not select this option, the
original palette will remain when you load or merge a
new bank. To deselect this icon, simply click on it again.

If you've been experimenting, the colours on your screen
may be looking a bit messy, so reload the Bobs in
"Baby AMOS.Abk" with their original palette before
continuing.

We now move on to the second Major Option, so move
the mouse pointer to the top line, and click the right
mouse button to return to the Main Menu. Then choose
the Bob Bank Operations icon.


			-=- 136 -=-


BANK OPERATIONS
---------------
When you select this Major Option, you take control of
all aspects of the Bob bank. The Bank icon moves to the
top-left corner of the screen, and the Major Option top
line is replaced by a series of eight new Bank icons, as
follows:

Get Bob
-------
First, HIGHLIGHT the Bob you are interested in by
clicking the mouse pointer over its image in the Bob
display on the right-hand side of the screen. Now, click
on the Get Bob option, and the highlighted Bob appears
in the large Zoom Window and the smaller Edit Window,
ready to be worked on. It's highly probable that you
really can't wait to have a go at changing the appearance
of whatever is sitting in the edit window right now, and
there is no harm in experimenting. Please be patient
though, and take the trouble to work through this Chapter
step by step. There's much more enjoyment to be had in
knowing what you are doing. For the time being, try
clicking on the small icon showing a pair of arrows
pointing up and down, in the line of drawing tools. This
will turn the current Bob upside down! Leave it like that.

Put Bob
-------
Once you've changed the appearance of the edited Bob
by flipping it on its head, this option puts it back into its
memory bank. It will go back to its original location, if
the location has been defined. You can see the original
location by looking for the Bob with the highlighted
identification number, marked with an *.


Put Bob To
----------
You can select a new Bob to highlight simply by clicking
on its image. Use this option if you want to force the
edited Bob into the currently highlighted location of the
bank, and replace whatever is there. You will be asked
to confirm your actions, just to make sure.

			-=- 137 -=-

Insert Bob
----------
This is a fast way of inserting the Bob from the editing
window straight into the highlighted position of the
bank, without replacing the Bob that is already sitting in
that position. The other Bobs in the bank will then shunt
along to make room for it. Try using this option now.

Delete Bob
----------
This will flush the highlighted Bob down the electronic
waste disposal unit, so take care when using it. As a
safety measure, Easy AMOS will not be happy about
deleting any Bob that is not displayed on screen, and
even then it will ask you to confirm your wishes. Use it
now and delete a Bob.

New
---
This is even more dramatic than Delete Bob, because it
gets rid of ALL the Bobs in the entire memory bank. As
usual, AMOS asks you to make sure of your actions
>before you commit them. If you use it now, you will
ave to load a new bank before you can continue
experimenting with Bob images.

Auto
----
This option is enabled and disabled by clicking the
mouse pointer over it, and popping it in and out like a
radio button. It affects the AUTO-GET feature which
automatically places data into the memory bank by
licking twice on a stored Bob image. You may want to
use this option to avoid grabbing hold of some garbage
Ind automatically placing it in amongst your Bobs.

Conf
----
When editing Bobs, there are times when Easy AMOS
tries to be helpful by making a personal appearance in
cartoon form and asking you to confirm your actions.
For example, when you want to ERASE a Bob or use the
PUT TO option. If these reminders cause any annoyance,

			-=- 138 -=-


you can click on this icon to disable the Confirmation
reminder. To reactivate it, simply click on the icon again.

THE GRABBER
-----------
Once you are familiar with all the Bank operations, you
can move on to the next Major Option, the Grabber! This
grabs images from IFF pictures, that is to say, graphic
screen images saved in a special "Interchangeable File
Format" used by graphics packages like Deluxe Paint.

Grab Bob
--------
Make sure your "Easy AMOS Tutorial" disc is ready to
load from, and select Grab Bob. This time, you will be
reminded to load an IFF file only, and we have provided
you with a suitable picture for loading. The file requester
only appears if there is no picture currently selected.
Please select the following file now:

  Easy_Tutorial: Iff/Grab_Me.Iff

When you have confirmed your choice with an [OK], the
chosen IFF picture is shown on the screen. As you move
the mouse, coordinate lines will follow your movements.
Position the mouse pointer at the top left-hand corner of
the part of the image you want to use as a Bob, then using
the LEFT button keep it held down until you have
chosen the bottom right hand corner. If you make a
mistake, click on the RIGHT button. When you are
happy with the rectangle of graphics to be grabbed, click
the LEFT button again. The Edit Screen now holds your
new image. There is an auto-resolution mode that is
explained later, which will ensure the best graphics
mode is used.

Put Bob
-------
This works in the same way as the "Put Bob To" option in
the BANK menu. It lets you grab an image and put it into
memory instantly, without having to wander from one
menu to another.


			-=- 139 -=-

Load Picture
------------
This time, when the file selector appears, you will be
reminded to save any current image in the editing area
that has not been saved to the Bob bank, then you can
select the name of a new picture to load.

Grab Palette
------------
This is one of those on/off options, enabled and disabled
by a mouse click. If it is ON, the current palette will
automatically change to the palette used by the current
picture. If it is OFF, no change to the palette will be
made.

Reload Picture
--------------
This icon is linked up to the next two icons, and the three
of them act like radio station selectors. In other words,
only one can be pushed in at a time, and when any one
is activated the other two will click off. With Reload
Picture, the graphic image gets completely erased when
you go back to the Main Menu, allowing you to create
more Bobs. This is useful if you don't have much
memory available, and a large IFF screen may be taking
up a vast chunk of it.

Pack Picture
------------
This is also a memory saver. It takes the current screen
picture, and packs it into a memory bank using "fast
RAM~, which doesn't eat up display memory. When
you leave the Grab menu for the first time, this will take
a little while to perform.

Keep Screen
-----------
This option will keep the entire screen exactly as it is,
providing you have enough memory available in "chip
RAM."

			-=- 140 -=-

THE HOT SPOT
------------
The next Main Option, concerns setting up any Bob "hot
spots". In most computer games and in several practical
programs, hot spots can be set up inside moving images
as coordinate reference points. When these coordinates
are recognised, they are used to trigger preset reactions.
Because Bobs can vary greatly in size, it's very useful to
be able to place a hot spot precisely. Once inside the Hot
Spot sub menu, you can go straight into the Zoom or Edit
window and use the mouse to place and set the
coordinates. Otherwise use one of the automatic settings,
as explained next.

Auto Off
--------
If you click on this icon, so it looks as if it has been pushed
IN, you can use any of the hot spot presets to position a
hot spot by hand for the current Bob. If it is not used, you
will be in Auto mode, which means that every Bob you
GET into the edit window will have a hot spot
automatically set to the last preset position. This is
useful if you want a whole range of Bobs to have their hot
spots in the same place.

Hot spot preset
---------------
There are nine icon boxes, each showing a preset hot spot
position. If the Auto option is OFF, you can select the hot
spot of the current Bob by clicking on any one of them.
They are, in order of appearance, Top Left, Top Centre,
Top Right, Centre Left, Centre, Centre Right, Bottom
Left, Bottom Centre and Bottom Right. Select a preset
now, and check its setting by moving your cursor into
the Zoom or Edit window. When you want to get back
to the Main Menu, click the right mouse button in the top
line of icons, as usual.

You'll be coming across hot spots again, later in this
Chapter, along with a ready-made demo program.

			-=- 141 -=-

PALETTE COLOURS
---------------
Here's a chance to see all that palette theory you met in
the last Chapter put into practice! Click on this Major
Option icon for the Palette, and get ready to mix some
new colours. A colour requester appears over the editing
screen, alongside the vertical display of all the colours in
the current palette. The colour requester is laid out like
this.


			-=- 142 -=-


The colour requester acts like a colour mixing box. If the
box obscures the images on display in the editing area,
you can drag it around the screen by clicking on the top
bar to reveal the images. Let's look in the colour requester
box now.

On the left are the sixteen values for colour saturation,
given in hexadecimals from zero up to F. Next come
three sliding bars, one each for the Red, Green and Blue
components of each colour. On the right of the panel are
four boxes.

[OK] is triggered when you are happy with any colour
changes, and want to keep them.

[UNDO] will ignore any of your colour changes, and
return the palette to whatever it held before your latest
experiments.

[QUIT] leaves the colour requester, and ignores any
changes you may have made.

The Colour Code box, shows the value of the RGB
components of the current colour, in hexadecimals.

The Colour Panel at the bottom right of the colour
requester displays the current colour that is receiving
your attention.

To change colours in the current palette, first select one
by moving the mouse pointer over any of the colours in
the vertical palette display at the left-hand side of the
screen. Now click inside any of the RGB slider bars and
move them up and down until you have mixed the new
colour you want. Then mix another colour, or use [OK],
[UNDO] or [QUIT], as described above.

			-=- 143 -=-

If you alter the colour used for the "framework" outlines
used within the editing area, be careful not to merge it
with the background colour and cause confusion on
screen. If this does happen, Easy AMOS will get you out
of trouble. Although you use the left mouse button to
click on colours of your choice, if you go straight to the
vertical palette display and use the right mouse button,
you can change the colours of the edit screen directly.

The vertical palette display may show 64 colours
instead of 32 in certain modes, and you are welcome to
display colour numbers 32 to 63 in the requester and
take a look at them. But you can only change colours in
the range from zero to 31. This is because the 64 colour
mode, known as Extra Half Bright mode, takes the first
32 colours in the palette and creates 32 new colours
which are half as bright as the originals. These new
colours will only change when their "original" neighbours
are changed.



SCREEN RESOLUTIONS
------------------
This is the Menu in charge of the screen colour resolutions.
It controls the number of colours used by your Bobs,
which you may have to adjust to suit various screen
formats. To see how powerful it is, have some high
definition IFF images displayed in the Bob windows,
before you start experimenting.

Adjust
------
This is a very powerful option. If it is ON, any Bob you
GET from the bank will adjust the current palette to its
own resolution preference. If it is OFF, the number of
colours is unchanged. This can have one of two effects.
Either the Bob has LESS colours than your current
screen, and nothing is lost. Or the Bob has MORE
colours than the current screen, and the higher value
colours are lost. The bank will remain unchanged until


			-=- 144 -=-

you deposit the Bob back into it. The Adjust option is
norrnally ON.

HI-RES
------
Also an ON/OFF switch, this one selects the current
screen mode, with the maximum number of colours in
high resolution being 16. Everything else in the program
remains unchanged, except for the colour resolution.


Number of Colours
-----------------
A choice of six options, instantly selecting the number of
colours displayed on the edit screen, as follows: 2, 4, 8,
16, 32 or 64.


ANIMATION
---------
This is a great way to test animated movie sequences of
Bob images that are currently loaded. Try out the
Animation system now, using the "Baby AMOS.Abk"
Bobs. When you click on the Animation icon in the
Major Options row, the editing screen gives way to your
very own movie animation suite! Animation is merely
the eye tricking the brain into believing that a series of
still images is continuous movement, just like the crude
"flick-art" images in the bottom corner of the left-hand
pages of this book.

			-=- 145 -=-


If you are using the standard European screen system,
known as PAL, there are 16 individual movie ''framesU in
the "camera", that can take one Bob each. If you are using
the American NTSC system, there are eight frames
available. Below them is your "movie screen", showing
the individual frames animated one after the other.
Next to that is a slider bar for adjusting the Speed of
animation, from zero for "still video" up to 100 for a
"turbo" speed of 50 frames per second (PAL) or 60
frames per second (NTSC) for superfast animation. The
"Quit" box is down in the bottom right-hand corner. To
the right of the animation frames, the current Bob bank
can be examined as usual, by running up and down its
slider.

			-=- 146 -=-

To put any Bob into the animation sequence, all you
have to do is click on it and it will appear in a camera
movie frame. As soon as more than one Bob image has
been transferred, your animation sequence begins to
move, in the same order that you transferred your
images.

To take out any individual Bob from the animation
sequence, click on its movie frame image in the "camera"
sequence and it will disappear, causing all the following
frames to shunt backwards towards the beginning of the
sequence and fill the gap.

The position of the Bob animations on the "movie screen"
is changed with the mouse pointer, and its hot spot will
be automatically positioned beneath the mouse button
click.

After you QUIT the animation suite, the sequence is held
in memory. So next time you use the Animation icon,
your last sequence will come running to greet you.

To delete the sequence from memory, one of three things
must happen:

- One of the animation Bobs is deleted from the memory
  bank.

- A new bank is loaded.

- The original bank is erased.

QUIT
----
Sure enough, the white flag icon gives up the Bob editing
process and surrenders to your next bout of
programming. Just in case you have forgotten to save
anything you may want to use in the future, AMOS
appears with a timely reminder. If you called up the Bob
Editor from the Systems Menu, Easy AMOS will
automatically clear the Bob Editor from memory when
you quit, and reload any program that you were
previously editing.


			-=- 147 -=-



But don't quit yet. There's a whole line of smaller icons
to explore, containing all of your drawing tools. This
menu line is completely independent from the Major
Options above it, and you can use these tools at any
suitable time. All of these drawing operations ONLY
effect the visible part of the Bob being edited. You are
invited to tackle them now, from left to right.



DRAWING TOOLS
=============

DOT PLOT
--------
The Easy AMOS dotted plotter! Click on this icon now,
and experiment by clicking the mouse button in the
editing window to plot single pixels. Then keep the
button held down and move the mouse around at
different speeds. Now try the other mouse button, then
both buttons together to remind yourself that the top
three colours in the vertical palette display refer to the
left, right and combined mouse buttons. If your mouse
has threebuttons, the third one will make use of the third
colour automatically.

LINE PLOT
---------
This gives you a continuous solid line plot, no matter
how fast you use it.


DRAW
----
Before you can use this drawing tool effectively, you
have to design it yourself! First of all, set the size and
positioning of your own "line~ by clicking anywhere in
the edit window, holding the mouse button down,
dragging it and then letting go. Now use your own
shape to paint and draw with. Further along the line of
drawing icons, you will see how the MODE button
changes certain drawing operations. If it is selected and
used with DRAW, then lines are drawn as soon as the
mouse button is released.

			-=- 148 -=-

Box
---
Easy! Click the mouse button to set a corner of the box,
keep the button held down while you locate the
diagonallyoppositecorner,thenletgo. Oneboxappears,
ready to use as a brush or paste again as many times as
you like by moving the mouse and clicking a button.
Don't forget that a third colour is available for drawing
operations by using both mouse buttons together.

ELLIPSE
-------
This works in exactly the same way as BOX, except that
ellipses don't have corners. So set the boundary points
instead. Of course, there is nothing to prevent you
drawing circles with this method.

AIR-BRUSH
---------
One for all you street artists. Different sprays can be set
by clicking the RIGHT mouse button on this icon,
revealing a selector menu to customise your airbrush
spray can. Both the power of the air supply and the
width of your spray nozzle can be adjusted from one up
to 99, with an [OK] button to getback and start spraying.
Experiment, and see the results for yourself. If you want
to spray without customising your own air-brush, click
on the air-brush icon with the LEFT mouse button.

BAR
---
Set up the diagonally opposite corners of a bar in the
usual way, and then release the button to fill it with the
currentcolour,orselected pattern. Theoutlineof thebar
can be toggled OFF and ON by clicking on the border
section of the Current Pattern Display window.

PAINT ROLLER or FILL
--------------------
Nice and dramatic, this one. Position your paint roller
cursor anywhere inside an enclosed shape, and it will be
instantly covered with the current fill colour or pattern.
Select new patterns from the Pattern Display window.


			-=- 149 -=-

TEXT CAPTIONS
--------------
Select this icon, click the mouse button in a likely position
inside the editor window, and start typing one line of
text. Of course you can't fit much text inside a Bob,
unless it's a very wide one! Now reposition your text by
moving the mouse, and paste it in as many times as you
like. Try and create some outline and shadow effects,
using different colours.

COPY BLOCK
----------
This is used to copy a block of graphics from one Bob to
another. Click on, hold, move and click off to open the
box in your picture, ready for pasting.

PASTE BLOCK
-----------
This grabs the previous block that you cut out, and
restores it wherever you want within the editing area.
Paste a few blocks now.

OPAQUE
------
All the time this option is OFF, colour zero of the block
you are editing will be transparent. If you click the
Opaque button ON, colour zero will be filled by the
colour used by the right mouse button.

CLEAR
-----
OK, so we all make mistakes. One of the most popular
options available: the one that clears all your current
efforts away, and leaves you with a blank editing
window. OK, so we all make several mistakes. Use the
UNDO option to bring it all back again!

The next block of five drawing icons affects the entire
image with dramatic results.

			-=- 150 -=-

SCROLL 1
--------
After selecting this option, grab the image in the editing
window with your mouse and scroll it anywhere you
want. Release the button to leave it in its new position.

SCROLL 2
--------
This not only scrolls the image, but also wraps it back
around itself when you hit the borders of the editing
window.

HORIZONTAL FLIP
---------------
One click will cause an instant flip about the horizontal
axis of the Bob. Another click will flip it again. This
works equally well on blocks.

VERTICAL FLIP
-------------
This is similar to the last option, and reverses the image
about its own vertical axis.

ROTATE
------
This is used to rotate the whole Bob through ninety
degrees clockwise. It takes a few seconds to compute the
new image, and can be used again to keep the rotation
going all the way back to the original image.

The next pair of options is provided to help you get a
better view of your work.

GRAB
----
If the Bob is too large to fit inside the Edit Window, select
this icon and then use the mouse to drag the image into
view.

ZOOM
----
Click on this icon to double the size of the graphics in the
Zoom Window to four times the size of the original Bob.
Click again to return to an image twice the size of the
original. Don't forget that you can adjust the size of
Zoom and Edit screens by dragging the central Screen
Sizer bar to suit your needs.

  
			-=- 151 -=-

The final group of three options each perform general
tasks.

BACKGROUND FRAMEWORK
--------------------
Every click on this icon selects the next colour in the
palette for use as the framework of the edit screen

MODE
----
Presents an UP/DOWN icon that sets the mode for
certain drawing operations. UP gives Mode 1, where an
object is drawn as soon as you release a mouse button.
DOWN selects Mode 2, where you set the shape of a
brush before using it to draw with.

UNDO
----
This is the fail-safe icon, allowing you to scrap the last
drawing procedure, or cancel a CLEAR operation.

[SPACEBAR]
----------
Pressing the [Spacebar] key on your Amiga will select
the LAST drawing tool that you used. This is a short cut,
allowing you to re-use an item without having to go
through the menu process.

MEMORY ALERTS
-------------
Because Bobs nibble away at available memory, and
because graphic screens eat up large amounts of the
stuff, a low-memory alert system is built in to the Bob
Editor. These alert messages will automatically appear
to help you. Chapter 17 is devoted to the computer's
memory, and the Memory Alerts are fully detailed
there.

			-=- 152 -=-


Using bobs
----------
After creating all of these splendid Bobs, you'll want to
be able to use them in your own programs. The next
section deals with all the commands that help you do
just that. Once you understand how to use them, get
ready for the next Chapter, when you will be invading
the brain of a computer games designer! So if you can
drag yourself away from the Bob Editor, get ready to try
out the Easy AMOS Bob commands.

Quit the Bob Editor and save your work if you want to,
giving your edited Bob bank a new name using the [Save
As] icon. When you are satisfied, have the "Easy AMOS
Tutorial" disc in your disc drive, because you'll be using
some of its ready-made demo programs in the final part
of this Chapter.

Call up the File Selector, and open this folder:

*Bob_Tutorials

There they are! Sixteen lovely ready-made demos, to
save your time and your fingertips, and if the first one
seems familiar it's because you used it at the start of this
Chapter! Load it now, examine the listing and then run


Bob_Tutorial01.AMOS


Drawing bobs
------------
BOB

To draw a Bob on the current screen, first create it by
givingita number, then specify the screenx,y-coordinates
where you want it to appear, followed by the image
number of the Bob in the bank that you want to assign for
this purpose, like the line of the last example which
reads:

Bob 1,160,130,1

			-=- 153 -=-


That example creates Bob number one, positions it at
coordinates 160,130 and uses image number 1 from the
Bob bank. Easy isn't it.

Bob numbers normally range from zero to 63, and once
a Bob has been created you can leave out the coordinate
parameters and the Bob bank image number, and just
call it up using its own number. The parameters you
leave out will keep their original values. You can also
change its appearance or its position by including the
right number of commas but leaving out either of those
parameters. For example, to change the image of Bob
number 1 to the second image in the Bob bank, but keep
it at its current screen position, add these lines to your
example:

  Wait 50

  Bob 1,,,2

  Wait Vbl


Did you notice that horrible flickering effect? When a
Bob moves around the screen, the graphics underneath
it are replaced at their original position. Because of
technical limitations, using a large number of Bobs on
the screen at the same time can cause an ugly flickering
effect, due to the fact that Bob images are updated at the
same time as the screen image. Don't panic. Easy AMOS
has a great way of solving this problem, called a "double
buffer". This creates a second invisible copy of the
screen, and all graphic operations are performed in this
invisible screen without interfering with your screen
picture at all. Let's take a look at an example of the "Bob
flicker problem" in more detail. Load the next example,
read the listing and then run it:

 Bob_Tutorial02.AM0S


			-=- 154 -=-


Curing screen interference
--------------------------

DOUBLE BUFFER
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
After you use this command, Easy AMOS will create an
invisible screen and use it automatically. There is nothing
to worry about, except for the fact that the Double Buffer
uses up twice the amount of screen memory. So don't
use it for too many screens. To see "the Bob flicker
problem solved", try out the next example:

  Bob_Tutorial03.AM0S

The next example demonstrates flicker-free Bobs moving
over background graphics:


  Bob_Tutorial04.AMOS


=X BOB(n)
=Y BOB(n)
---------
These two functions report the current coordinates of
the Bob number you are interested in. Because Bobs can
zoom across several screens, the coordinates are
measured in relation to the current screen. Take a look
at a practical example by examining the next ready-
made example in the "*Bob_Tutorials" folder on your
"Easy AMOS Tutorial" disc:

 Bob_TutorialO0.AMOS

After looking at the listing and running the program,use
your mouse to drag our floating cartoon character around
the screen, and the Bob coordinates will be displayed
automatically.

LIMIT BOB
----------
This command keeps all Bobs restricted to moving inside
an invisible rectangular area of the screen, whose
coordinates are set in the usual corner To corner way. If
you follow Limit Bob with a Bob number, then only that
Bob will be restricted to the boundaries of the rectangle.


			-=- 155 -=-

The width of the rectangle must always be wider than
the width of the Bob, and the x-coordinates are always
rounded UP to the nearest 16 pixel boundary. To keep
Bob number 1 trapped inside an area, you would use
something like this:

       Limit Bob 1,0,0 To 320,100

See that in action now, by loading the next Bob example:

       Bob Tutorial06.AMOS

Remember that the Bob must be called up with the Bob
command before Limit Bob is used, otherwise the limit
will have no effect. To restore your Bob's freedom to
move around the whole screen, use this command
without any coordinates, like this:

 Limit Bob


Handling Bobs
-------------
The next four commands are used to handle Bobs. When
you understand how they work individually, you can
see them working together in our next spectacular demo
program.

PASTE BOB
---------
This copies an image from the Bob bank and draws it on
the screen immediately. Simply follow the command
with the screen coordinates where you want the image
to be pasted, then the number of the image. For example:

  Paste Bob 60,50,4

GET BOB
-------
This command is used to grab an image from the current
screen, and load it into the Bob bank. The command
must be followed by an image number to be loaded with
the grabbed image, and then the coordinates for the
corners of the rectangle that you want to make use of.


			-=- 156 -=-

For example, if you wanted to load a block of graphics
into Bob number 1, you could use:

                 Get Bob 1,Xl,Y1 To X2,Y2

You can select an optional screen number from which
the image is to be taken, by inserting that number in front
of the Bob number. For example, if the image you want
is on screen number 0, you could use something like:

      Get Bob 0,1,Xl,Y1 To X2,Y2

BOB OFF
-------
If you want to remove all Bobs from the screen, use this
command. By following it with the number of a particular
Bob, only that Bob will be removed. For example:

    Bob Off

Any animations and collision routines associated with a
Bob that has been removed will no longer operate.

DEL BOB
-------
This is used to delete one or more numbered Bobs from
the Bob bank. For example:

      Del Bob 1

This would just erase Bob number 1 from the bank, but
if you want to delete Bobs 4, 5, 6 and 7, for example, use
this:

      Del Bob 4 To 7

When the last Bob is deleted from a bank, the whole bank
will be removed from memory.

Load the next example program now, to see how Paste
Bob, Get Bob, Bob Off and Del Bob can be used.

      Bob_Tutorial07.AMos

			-=- 157 -=-

INS BOB
-------
The Ins Bob command is used to insert a numbered Bob
into the current Bob bank, like this:

  Ins Bob 63

=I BOB

Use this function if you need to know the current image
number being used by a Bob. For example, if you are
interested in Bob number three, you could ask:

  Print I Bob (3)

Make sure that the Bob has been drawn, otherwise an
"illegal function" message will be displayed.


Flipping Bobs
-------------
Suppose you are designing a computer game, and
suppose you have an animated cartoon character or an
intergalactic ice-cream van moving from left to right or
from top to bottom of the screen. Among the drawing
tools in the Bob Editor, there is a pair of icons that can flip
a Bob horizontally and vertically. You may think that
you have to create a whole load of reversed Bobs to make
your animations move from right to left or from the
bottom to the top, and use up lots of precious memory.
Not so!

Easy AMOS gives you three wonderful memory-saving
functions to flip your Bobs any way you want ~
horizontally, vertically or a double mirror image. When
Bobs are flipped in this way, any hot spots are flipped as
well, so take care. Either set the original hot spots
centrally, or change them in the flipped Bobs as necessary
using the Hot Spot command, which is explained later.

			-=- 158 -=-

=HREV
-----
This is used to tell the Bob generator to display a reversed
Bob by flipping it over its own horizontal axis (the x-
axis).

=VREV
-----
Same process, different axis. The Bob can be flipped
over its own vertical axis.

=REV
----
This is used for a full reverse, both vertically and
horizontally.

To make any of these three functions perform their
particular flip, identify the Bob by its number, follow
that with the x,y-coordinates for where the flipped Bob
will appear, then give the appropriate Reverse
instruction, followed by the new image number in
brackets. For example:

 Bob 2, 121, 100,Hrev(4)

For an instant demonstration, take a look at the next
example in the "*Bob Tutorials" folder:

 Bob Tutorial08.AM0S


Detecting Bob collisions
------------------------
When dealing with Bobs, perhaps the most important
thing your program needs to know is if or when a
collision takes place.

=BOB COL

This is the function that checks to see if a numbered Bob
has collided with another Bob. If a collision is detected,
the value -I (true) is given, otherwise zero (false) is
reported. So if you wanted to check on the progress of
Bob number 1, you might use this:

C=Bob Col(1)

			-=- 159 -=-


That would check for collisions with any other Bob, but
you can specify a range of Bobs to watch out for by
including their numbers, 1ike this:

  C=Bob Col(1,2 To 4)

The status of these Bobs can be examined individually
by the Col function, which is explained next.

=COL

This tests the status of a Bob after a Bob Col test. You set
up an array of the Bob numbers you are interested in,
and the position of that Bob number will report back
with a -1 for a collision, or a zero for no collision. For
instance, if you wanted a report on the Bob Col example
above, you would use:

  C2=Col(2) : C3=Col(3) : C4=Col(4)

A report may then be given, something like this:

  C2=0, C3=0, C4=-1

meaning that Bob number 1 had collided with Bob
number 4, but Bobs 2 and 3 had avoided any collision.

Try the next ready-made example, which displays a
continuous collision report at the top of the screen when
you run the program:

  Bob Tutorial09.AMOS

Setting hot spots
-----------------
Collisions are searched for by referring to Bob hot spots.
You have already seen how hot spots can be set up in the
Bob editor, either freehand, or by using one of nine
preset positions. Whether a hot spot lies inside or
outside of the visible Bob graphics, it is always used as
the reference point for coordinate calculations. So if hot
spots have to change~e while a program is running, you
will need to know how to set hot spots from inside your
programs.

			-=- 160 -=-


"The Hot Spot.
Like you've
never seen. "
     John Lee
  Hooker, 1990)


HOT SPOT
--------
To use this command for setting up a new hot spot,
simply follow it with the Bob number and the hot spot
coordinates measured from the top left-hand corner of
that Bob's image. For example:

  Hot Spot 1,5,10

You can also use one of nine preset positions which
match up with those in the Bob Editor presets. They are
represented by the following values, running from the
top-left preset through to the bottom-right preset:

   $00 (top left)   $10 (top centre)    $20 (top right)

   $01 (mid left)   $11 (mid centre)    $21 (mid right)

   $02 (bottomleft) $12 (bottom centre) $22 (bottomright)

So to set the hot spot of Bob number 5 to its bottom left-
hand corner, you would use this:

  Hot Spot 5,$02

See the Hot Spot command in action by loading the next
example:

  Bob Tutorial10.AMOS

It is important to understand that every Bob automatically
has a priority of importance, and that this priority is
based on the Bob's number. So a Bob carries a priority
value from zero to 63, and Easy AMOS uses this value to
decide in which order Bobs are displayed and which
Bobs barge their way in front of others when flying
around the screen.

The general rule is that a Bob with a higher priority
number will be displayed in front of one with a lower
priority number. For example, Bob 5 would cut across
Bob 4, but be obscured if Bob 6 crossed its path. So it is
clear that this priority system should always be
remembered when you number your Bobs.

			-=- 161 -=-


Easy AMOS allows changes in the priority system to suit
your needs, by offering an alternative based on the
position of Bobs on the screen.

PRIORITY ON
PRIORITY OFF

When you use Priority On, Bobs with the HIGHEST Y-
coordinates take priority on the screen. It is usually best
to set hot spots at the bottom of Bobs to exploit this
priority, and some great perspective effects can be
created. All that is needed to reset the original Bob
number priorities is to use the Priority Off command.
Get your priorities right by examining the next demo:

Bob Tutorial11.AMOS

PRIORITY REVERSE ON
PRIORITY REVERSE OFF

The Priority Reverse On command changes around the
entire priority table based on Bob numbers. Not only
does it give a lower Bob number priority over a higher
Bob number, when you use it with Priority On, it also
gives priority to a Bob with the LOWEST Y-coordinate.
As you would expect, Priority reverse Off sets the priority
system back to normal.

Bob control commands
--------------------
More experienced programmers may want to make use
of the next three commands. You'll have to understand
a bit of theory first, concerning "logical" and "physical"
screens, and this is covered in the next Chapter. For the
time being, it's enough to know what these commands
can do, and there is a full explanation in the Glossary at
the end of this book.

BOB UPDATE
BOB UPDATE OFF

These commands are used to change the automatic
speed at which Bobs are redrawn on the screen.

			-=- 162 -=-

BOB DRAW
--------
This can be used to redraw Bobs when certain movements
have to be synchronised.

BOB CLEAR
---------
This command can be used with the BobDraw command,
and removes active Bobs from the screen then redraws
the background graphics beneath them.

Once you have got your Bobs on screen, you may want
to change the way they react with the rest of your
graphics. The final part of this Chapter explains how to
achieve some special effects.

SET BOB
-------
This command is used to change the Bob's drawing
mode, and it has the following parameters:

Set Bob number,background,planes,mask

Let's look at those parameters one by one.

Number. This is obvious, and refers to the numberof the
Bob you are setting.

Background. This sets the way the graphics underneath
the Bob are redrawn. There are three values to choose
from: zero, a positive number or a negative number.

Zero automatically replaces the old background image
when the Bob moves on. This gives a smooth animation
effect.

A positive number, such as 1, causes the original
background graphics to be forgotten and replaced by a
solid block of the background colour. This is much faster
than the usual drawing method, and can be used for
moving Bobs aaoss areas such as plain blue sky.

A negative number, such as -1, turns off the redrawing
process, and allows you to fill the old graphic image with
special colours or patterns.

			-=- 163 -=-          


Planes. This takes the form of a "bit-map" which consists
of a "binary" number, where each digit represents one
plane of the screen, and each plane represents one bit of
the final colour displayed on the screen. Normally, a
Bob is drawn in all of the bit planes, with a pattern of
%111111. By changing some of these bits from ones to
zeros, selected colours are left out and this will generate
various special effects.

Mask. Again, this is a bit pattern. All you need to know
for now is that normally there are two options. If the Bob
is to be used with a mask, use this:

  %11100010

If the Bob is to be used with NO mask set, then use this:

  %11001010

It is best to use Set Bob BEFORE displaying Bobs on the
screen. The following example would set Bob number
I moving across the original screen colours, with no
mask set:

  Set Bob 1,0, %111111,%11001010

Take a look at the next set of examples in the
"*Bob Tutorials" folder on your "Easy AMOS Tutorial"
disc:

  Bob_Tutorial12.AMOS

The background graphics in that demonstration are not
replaced where the upper Bob moves, while the lower
Bob is left in its normal mode and the graphics are
redrawn.

For a detailed demonstration of the plane parameter, try
the next example:

  Bob_Tutorial13.AMOS

			-=- 164 -=-

Similarly, the following example displays some effects
created with the mask parameter, with their titles and bit
patterns displayed at the top of the screen when you run
the program:

  Bob_Tutorial14.AMOS

GET BOB PALETTE
---------------
This command is used to load the whole colour palette
used for your Bobs into the current screen. A mask can
be added if you like, which will load a selection of these
colours only. Each individual colour is represented by
one "bit" of the mask set to a zero for OFF and a one for
ON. Colours run from right to left, so colour zero is
represented by the bit at the right-hand end of the mask,
colour 1is the second from the right, and so on. Supposing
there are 16 colours in your Bob palette. You would copy
the first four colours like this:

Get Bob Palette %0000000000001111

Have a look at a ready-made demonstration using Get
Bob Palette by trying the next example in the
"Bob Tutorials" folder:

  Bob_Tutorial15.AMOS

Bob masks    
---------
"A mask tells
us more than
a face. "
  (Oscar Wilde,
        1891)

A "mask" means that the background colour (colour
zero) around your Bob is made transparent, so that the
screen graphics show through. The mask is also used by
certain collision detection routines. A mask is
automatically set up for every Bob, and the No Mask
command takes this mask away, so the entire Bob image
is drawn on the screen, including its original background
colour and any other graphics in colour zero. To remove
a mask, simply use this command followed by the Bob
image you are interested in, like this:

No Mask 1


			-=- 165 -=-


Load the following example for a demonstration:

  Bob_Tutorial16.AMOS

NEVER remove a mask from a Bob while it is on screen,
or you'll scramble its image. Use the Bob Off command
first. We will now bob off to the next Chapter, and
explain the mysteries of the screen!

                   UNDERSTANDING SCREENS


Easy AMOS Screens
-----------------
Think of your television set or monitor as a glass window,
through which you can view whatever Easy AMOS is
displaying on its own 'screen~. The ~screen" used to
show Easy AMOS images is not the same as your TV
display, because your Easy AMOS screen can be changed
in all sorts of ways, while the glass window of your TV
set remains fixed.

So far, you've learned how Easy AMOS can show text,
graphics and special effects, as well as import spectacular
graphic pictures. Up to now, everything has been
displayed on a single Easy AMOS "screen" that appears
in the glass window display of your TV set. To help you
understand all the ideas involved with screens and see
the theory put into practice, we've provided another
batch of ready-made example programs on your "Easy
AMOS Tutorial" disc. You can find them in the folder
named:

*Screen_Tutorials

Imagine a computerised game of football, where the
playing area is represented by a screen. This screen
could use a plain green background colour with the
pitch marked out in white, or it could use a detailed
multi-coloured background image, like the "IFF' pictures
explained in the last Chapter. Now imagine your Bobs
are used to represent the football players, and that the
Bob palette is set up for the various coloured kits worn
by the players.

The good news is that you are not restricted to playing
on your home pitch, because there are other screens
available for you to use!

			-=- 168 -=-

The default screen
------------------
When you run an Easy AMOS program, a screen area is
automatically set up to display the results of your work.
We call this the "default screen", and it's the Easy AMOS
screen you've been using since you first started learning
and experimenting. The default screen is given an
identity number known as screen zero. It is 320 pixels
wide, 200 pixels high and it can display 16 different
colours.

Additional screens
------------------
Apart from the default screen, seven more screens can be
set up and used for Easy AMOS programs, and each new
screen is given an identity number from 1 to 7. When a
new screen is set up, it has to be "opened", and this is
done by giving it a number, followed by its width, its
height, the number of colours to be used and finally the
size of the little dots of colour across the screen called
pixels. You will open some new screens a little later on.

Screen Resolution
-----------------
Until now, you have been looking at a screen that is 320
pixels wide, but this "resolution" can be doubled to 640
pixels across the screen. When the screen is 320 pixels
wide it is in "low resolution" or "Lowres" for short. If this
is changed to 640 pixels wide, the screen is in "high
resolution", known as "Hires".


DEFINING A SCREEN
-----------------
SCREEN OPEN

You are now ready to "open" additional screens, using
the Screen Open command followed by these parameters:

   Screen Open number,width,height,colours,mOde

Let's look at each parameter one by one.

Number is the identification number of the new screen,
ranging from 0 to 7. If a screen with this number already
exists, it will be scrapped and replaced by this new
screen.

			-=- 169 -=-


Width sets up the width of the new screen in pixels.
There is nothing stopping you opening a screen that i5
wider than the physical limit of the television or monitor
display, and extra-wide screens can be manipulated
with a Screen Offset command.

Height holds the number of pixels that make up the
height of the screen. Like the width, this can be larger
than the visible screen height, and scrolled into view.

Colours sets the number of colours to be used for the _
new screen. The choice for the number of colours that
can be selected is 2, 4, 8,16 or 32. (How to make use of
even more colours is explained in the next Chapter). .

Mode is your choice of the width of the pixel points on
the screen. Lowres is the normal status, allowing 320
pixels to be displayed across the screen. Hires halves the
width of each pixel and so allows 640 to be displayed.

When the default screen is automatically opened, screen
zero is equivalent to this:

  Screen Open 0,320,200,16,Lowres

To open screen number 1 as an oversize high-resolution
screen with eight colours, for example, you would use
something like this:

  Screen Open 1,600,400,8,Hires

Here is a little routine that opens all eight available
screens for you to view. Try it out now:

			-=- 170 -=-


 Curs Off : Cls 13 : Paper 13

 Print : Centre "Hello, I am SCREEN 0"

 For S=1 To 7

    Screen Open S,320,20,16,Lowres
 
    Curs Off : Cls S+2 : Paper S+2

    Centre "And I am SCREEN "+Str$(S)

    Screen Display S,,50+S*25,,8
 Next S

SCREEN CLOSE
------------
This is the command that erases a numbered screen, and
frees up the memory it was using for the rest of your
programming needs. To get rid of screen number 1, for
instance, add this line to the end of the last example:

Wait 50 : Screen Close 1


DEFAULT
-------
To close all currently opened screens and restore the
display back to its original setting, use the Default
command. Add another line to your last example, and
see the result:

Wait 50 : Default


IFF SCREENS
-----------
In Chapter 9, you came across pictures saved in "IFF"
format and learned how to use them for grabbing Bob
images. IFF images can also be loaded directly into your
programs.

LOAD IFF
---------
To load an IFF screen from a disc to your current screen,
make sure that your "Easy AMOS Tutorial~ disc is ready
in the disc drive and give the command, followed by the
IFF fllename. Remember to give a Flash Off command
too, to stop unwanted flash effects:


			-=- 171 -=-

Flash Off
--------
Load Iff "Easy_Tutorial:Iff/Grab_Me.Iff"

If you want to load the picture to any other screen,
simply include the number of that screen after the IFF
filename. You would load the picture to Screen 1 like
this:

Flash Off

Lcad Iff "Easy_Tutorial:Iff/Grab Me.Iff",1


SAVE IFF
--------
Use this command to save the current screen as an IFF
picture file onto a disc. Easy AMOS automatically saves
all the screen settings along with the picture, so that
when you load this file again it appears in its original
state,including any offsets and instructions for "hiding"
and "showing" the screen. Use the command, and give
the current picture a filename, like this:

Save Iff "My_Programs: Iff/Picture_Name.Iff"

To save precious disc space, Easy AMOS will compress
the data that makes up your IFF picture. If you prefer to
save the picture as it is, without using this standard
compression system, then you have to add a little "flag"
after your filename. If this flag has a value of 0, the
screen will not be compressed, for example:

Save Iff "My_PrograMs:IFf/Picture_Name.Iff,0"

The Save Iff command will work with any screen.

			-=- 172 -=-

Hiding and showing screens
---------------------------
So far, the only command you have used for hiding a
screen display is the one that clears a screen by erasing
it, which is the Cls instruction.

SCREEN HIDE
SCREEN SHOW
------------
To remove the current screen from view, the Screen
Hide command is used to whisk it away. It can then be
restored using the Screen Show command like this:

    Print "THE CURRENT SCREEN  ": Wait 100

    Screen Hide : Wait Key
 
    Screen Show

You can temporarily hide any screen you like by including
its index number after the command. For example:

    Screen Hide 1

The screen can then be revealed with a request to show
it, like this:

  Screen Show 1


SCREEN PRIORITY
---------------
Because screens can be different sizes, and because they
can be displayed at different positions on the TV by
offsetting or overlapping them, and because there can be
up to eight electronic screens queuing up one in front of
the other, you need a way of instantly kicking any one of
those screens to the front of the display, in other words,
giving it priority.

SCREEN TO FRONT
---------------
This command moves the numbered screen of your
choice to the front of the display queue. For an instant
example, open the "*Screen Tutorials" folder on your
"EasyAMOSTutorial" disc and load the following demo:


			-=- 173 -=-



  Screen_Tutorial01.AMOS

If the screen number is left out after a Screen To Front
command, then the current screen will be brought to the
front, otherwise type in and enter the number of any
screen you like when you try out the last example.


SCREEN TO BACK
--------------
Use this instruction to move a screen to the background
of your display. If another screen is already there, it will
be displayed in front of the screen you select. Again, if
you omit a screen number after the Screen To Back
command, the current screen will be relegated to the
back of the display queue. Get rid of any new screens
now by [New]ing the last example, and try this:

 Centre "Hello Again, Screen 0 here"

 Wait 200

 Screen Open 1,320,200,2,Lowres

 Centre "Excuse me, make way for Screen 1"

 Wait 200 : Screen To Front 0

 Screen 0

 Wait 200 : Screen To Back

SCREEN
~~~~~~
This is the command that allows you to direct ALL
graphical and text operations to the screen number of
your choice, like this:

 Screen Open 2,320,32,l6,Lowres

 Screen Display 2,,130,,

 Screen 0

 Plot 0,0 : Draw To 320,200

			-=- 174 -=-

Of course, if the screen you choose is outside of the
current display area, or is currently hidden, there will be
no visible effect. But the graphics will be drawn in
memory, waiting to be displayed whenever that screen
comes into view or comes out of hiding after a Screen
Show command.

=SCREEN
-------
Use this function to find out the number of the screen
that's currently active, whether or not it is visible:

MOVING SCREENS
--------------
Once you have set up a screen with Screen Open, it can
be positioned and moved anywhere you like on the
television display. This means that screens can be made
to bounce, slip, slide, flip over, sink out of sight, and
behave in all sorts of odd ways. This also means that
screens can overlap, or be displayed alongside one
another, and it is not difficult to understand that several
different screen modes can be shown at once in separate
areas of the display.

SCREEN DISPLAY
--------------
To position a screen, the Screen Display command is
used, followed by these familiar parameters:

  Screen Display number, x, y, width, height

Let's examine the parameters one at a time.

Number refers to the number of the screen from 0 to 7.

The x,y-coordinates are given as "hardware" coordinates,
which refer to physical positions on the television screen,
not the area used by Easy AMOS screens. These set the
position from which your Easy AMOS screen will be
displayed on the TV screen.


			-=- 175 -=-


X coordinates can range from 0 to 448, and they are
automatically rounded down to the nearest 16-pixel
boundary. Only the positions between coordinates 112
and 448 are actually visible on the TV screen, so avoid x-
coordinates below 112.

Y coordinates can range between 0 and 312, but because
every TV set displays a slightly different visible area, it's
sensible to keep your range between 30 and 300. A small
amount of experimenting will reveal what suits your
system.

Width sets the width of your screen in pixels, starting
from the top left-hand corner of the display. Screen
width will also be rounded down to the nearest 16
pixels, and if the width is lower than the original setting,
only a part of your image will be shown.

Height is used to set the height of your screen in the
same way.

Apart from the screen number, any of the other
parameters can be left out provided that the commas are
kept in the right places. If parameters are omitted, then
the default settings will automatically apply. For
example, to display screen zero and keep its original
height and width, you could use this:

  Screen Display 0,112,40,,

Only one screen at a time can be shown on each horizontal
line of the display, but several screens can be put on top
of one another. If screens are placed next to each other,
in other words if they are sewn together to make a
continuous display, there is one line of pixels where the
screens meet that plays "dead". You can see the effectby
moving your mouse pointer now between the editor
window and the menu line, where a line of "dead" pixels
occurs.

			-=- 176 -=-

One way of getting over this "dead" area is to create an
extra-large screen that is bigger than the TV display, and
then move the visible display area around inside its
boundaries. When extra-large screens are used, you set
the area to be viewed using the Screen Offset command.


SCREEN OFFSET
-------------
Look at the diagram below, where the area of the visible
screen is shown as a sort of "port-hole" 320 pixels wide by
200 pixels high, inside a much larger Easy AMOS screen.
Of course, you can make the port-hole smaller if you
prefer, using the Screen Display command.

The Screen Offset command is followed by the number
of the screen to be displayed, then the x,y-coordinates of
the "offset" which is the point where the top left-hand
corner of the visible display is to start, measured from
the top left-hand corner of your extra-large screen. For
example:

 Screen Offset 1, 200, 200


			-=- 177 -=-

"A wide screen
makes a picture
twice as bad. "
 (Sam Goldwyn,
        1953)


For a ready-made example using Screen Display and
Screen Offset, look through the listing of our next demo
program after loading:

  Screen_Tutorial02.AMOS

The visible area can be moved around the extra-large
screen by changing the offset coordinates, and some
very smooth scrolling effects are created like this. These
can be used for background graphics in leisure programs,
as well as more serious applications like geographic
maps or star constellations.

If you are not quite sure about the "hardware coordinates"
used with the Screen Display command, don't worry.
Easy AMOS provides a full set of functions that convert
between screen coordinates and hardware coordinates.

=X SCREEN
=Y SCREEN

These functions convert a screen coordinate into a
hardware coordinate. Try this:

Do
 Print At(0,0); "Mouse Hardware X coord.="
 Print At(O,l);X Mouse;" "
 Print At(0,4); "Mouse Software X coord.="
 Print At(0,5);X Screen(X Mouse);" "
Loop

=X HARD
=Y HARD

This pair of functions work in exactly the same way, and
are used to convert screen coordinates into hardware
coordinates. Type in the next example, and make sure

			-=- 178 -=-


the mouse pointer is in the middle of the screen before
you [Run] it.

   X Mouse=X Hard (0)

   Y Mouse=Y Hard (0)

That routine will force the mouse pointer "home" to
screen coordinates 0,0 (the top-left corner).

Now that you understand what Easy AMOS screens are
how about using them to give your own programs the
professional touch. The next Chapter is packed full of
practical ideas, and your "Easy AMOS Tutorial" disc
provides all the ready-made examples to demonstrate
their use.

			-=- 179 -=-


			CHAPTER 11

		       USING SCREENS


"I makefull
use of the
silver screen,
especially when
I'm drying out."
(W.C. Fields, 1937)


This is where the Easy AMOS screens come alive. Have
the "*Screen Tutorials" folder opened on your "Easy
AMOS Tutorial" disc, and get ready to make the screen
commands work for a living.

SWITCHING SCREENS
-----------------
When you flick the cartoon panels down in the left-hand
corner of this book, and when you use the animation
tools in the Bob Editor, you can understand that moving
images don't move at all. Graphical movement is an
illusion created by a fast sequence of still pictures.
Television screens don't display moving images either.
They fool the eye and the brain by updating still images
on the screen, fifty times a second.

In order to create really smooth moving graphics, your
computer has to complete all new drawing operations in
less than one fiftieth of a second. So if your program
can't achieve this, animated graphics will suffer from an
ugly little flicker. Easy AMOS solves this problem by
using a technique that switches between screens during
drawing operations.

This is how it works. Let's call the actual area where
images are displayed the "physical screen" . Now imagine
that there is a second screen which is completely invisible
to the eye, and it's where new drawing operations get
done. We'll call that the "logical screen"

Flicker-free movement is achieved by switching between
the physical screen and logical screen. The physical
screen is displayed as usual, then once the new drawing
has been completed on the logical screen, they are
swapped over. The old physical screen now becomes
the new logical screen, and is used to receive the drawing
operations that will make up the next picture. This
whole process is automatic when using the Double
Buffer command that you came across in Chapter 9.


			-=- 182 -=-


Easy AMOS provides a group of four functions that can
be used to give information about the physical and
logical screens. You don't have to understand how they
work for now. PHYSIC and LOGIC are used to find the
identification numbers of the physical and logical screens,
whereas PHYBASE and LOGBASE reveal the "address"
in the computer's memory of the "bit-planes" of physical
and logical screens. Advanced users can look these
functions up in the Glossary.

SCREEN SWAP
-----------
This is the command that swaps over the physical and
logical screens, so that the display is instantly switched
between the two of them. You can try a ready-made
example in a moment, but you need to understand one
more bit of theory first.

It has already been explained that the image on your
screen is updated fifty times every second. Every fiftieth
of a second, an image is drawn by an "electron beam"
scanning across every line of the screen at incredibly
high speed, until it reaches the bottom right-hand corner,
at which point the beam switches off and jumps back to
the top left-hand corner to start all over again. The
period between the completion of a screen and the
beginning of the next one is knows as the "vertical blank"
period, or VBL for short, and this is when Easy AMOS
leaps in to perform important jobs like moving Bobs and
swapping screens.

Although a fiftieth of a second seems a very short period
to human beings, Easy AMOS thinks of it as a huge
waste of time and is eager to get on with any tasks that
need doing. This means that your programs could get
out of synchronisation with what is actually happening
on screen, so Easy AMOS has to be told to wait for the
next vertical blank period sometimes, in order to keep in
step.


			-=- 183 -=-

WAIT VBL
--------
This simple command can be included in your programs
to achieve perfect screen synchronisation, and it's
especially useful after a Screen Swap. See it in action
now, by loading this example from the
"*Screen Tutorials" folder:
  
screen_Tutorial03.AMOS

AUTOBACK
---------
You may have noticed a new keyword in the listing of
that last example. The Autoback command is used to set
one of three automatic screen copying modes,depending
on what mode number it's followed by. Autoback can
be used anywhere in your Easy AMOS programs, to
achieve the following results:

  Autoback 0

This turns off the Auto back system,and sends all drawing
operations straight to the LOGICAL screen as fast as
possible. It can be used where you want to redraw large
chunks of a background screen over and over again.
This allows you to perform Bob collision detection
routines at regular intervals, without destroying the
overall quality of animation effects.

  Autoback 1

In this mode, each graphical operation will be performed
in BOTH the logical and physical screens, without taking
into account the position of your Bobs at all. This means
you should only use this mode for drawing OUTSIDE
the areas where Bobs may be active, and it's ideal for
sections like control panels and hi-score tables, which
need to be continually updated during a computer
game.

			-=- 184 -=-

  Autoback 2

This Auto back mode (which is the default mode) automaticaUy
combines aU drawing operation with Bob updates. All sa een
updates are performed once for the LOGICAL screen and
then once again for the PHYSICAL seen This means that
anything drawn on the background screen is displayed directly
underneath your Bobs. The obvious result of using this mode
is that your graphics will take at least twice as long to be drawn,
because the program will grind to a halt for at least two vertical
blanks each time something is output to the screen.

Any rectangular part of a screen can be copied and moved
almost instantly. It can be copied onto the current screen or any
other screen, time and time again.

SCREEN COPY
-----------
Screen Copy is the most important screen command of all It
can be used to achieve classic screen techniques like "wiping"
from one screen to another, as well as providing all sorts of
special effects.

At its simplest level, Screen Copy copies one screen to another,
like this:

 screen Copy source To destination

Source is the screen number that holds the SOURCE of the
image to be copied. This can either be a standard screen
number or the number of a logical or physical screen, created
using the Logic or Physic commands.

Destination holds the DESIINATION screen number,which
is where the image is copied to.

Draw some graphics on screen number zero now, so that you
can see the results of the screen Copy process. First define an
area of the screen to be copied, by setting the coordinates of its
top left-hand and bottom right-hand coordinates, as usual.
Then give the position of its new location by setting the new
top left-hand coordinates on the current screen. For example:

			-=- 185 -=-


    Circle 50,50,10 : Wait 100

    Screen Copy 0,20,20,70,70 To 0,100,100


There are no limits to the settings for your coordinates, and any
parts of an image that fall outside of the current visible screen
will be chopped off.

For an instant demo, load up this program from the '*Screen
Tutorials" folder on your "Easy AMOS Tutorial" Disc:

  Screen_Tutorial04.AMOS



When graphics are copied and arrive at their destination,they
normally overwrite anything that is already displayed there.
By adding an optional "blitter mode" after the destination
coordinates, you can change the way in which the new
graphics combine with any original graphics. In fact thereare
255 possible modes, but don't panic. Here is a list of five of the
most common modes, along with their binary bit-map patterns.

Mode     Bit-pattern    Effect
~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
REPLACE  %11000000      Replace destination graphic with a copy of
			the source image.

INVERT   %00110000	Replace destination graphics with an inverse
			video image of the source.

AND      %10000000	Combine together the source and destination 
			images.

OR       %11100000	Overlap source and destination images.

Exclude OR %01100000	Overlap inverse source with normal destination
			image.


If that sounds like mumbo jumbo don't worry. Load
the next ready-made example, and take a look through
its listing:


			-=- 186 -=-


Now [Run] the program to see Screen Copy in action,
using each of those masks. After the Bob of our cartoon
character has been loaded, it will appear in the top-left
corner of your screen. Use your mouse pointer to copy
the Bob wherever you like with a single click of the left
mouse button. Now keep the button held down and
move your mouse pointer around the screen to see the
full potential of Screen Copy When you've seen enough,
press any key to call up the next mask, and repeat the
process. Impressive, isn't it.


SCREEN CLONE
------------
To create an identical copy of the current screen, and
assign the "clone" to the screen number of your choice,
use this command followed by the destination screen
number. Try this example for a multi-cloned screen:

  Screen Open 0,320,20,4,Lowres

  Flash Off

  Screen Display 0,,70,,

  For S = 1 to 7
  
    Screen Clone S

    Screen Display S,,S*20+70,,

  Next S

  Print "Start typing> ";
 
  Do
    A$=Inkey$
   
    If AS<>  Then Print A$;

  Loop

			-=- 187 -=-


Screen Cloning is an ideal technique in computer games
for two players, with each player having half of the
visible display area. There's a working example of this
on your "Easy AMOS Examples" disc, which you can
examine at your leisure:

  Tricycle_Race.AMOS

Your clone uses the same memory area as the original
screen, and will be displayed at the same place as the
original. You can use any of the usual screen operations
with the clone, such as Screen Display and Screen Offset.
But because there is only one copy of the original screen
data in memory, it's impossible to use the Screen
command with the cloned copy.

Screen colours
--------------
GET PALETTE

This command copies the colours from a numbered
screen and loads them into the current screen. The next
instant demo on your "Easy AMOS Tutorial" disc
demonstrates this, so look at the listing to see how Get
Palette sets the palette of screen 1 to that of screen 0
before you [Run] the program:

  Screen Tutorial06.AMOS


This is useful when data is being moved from one screen
to another with a Screen Copy command, and you need
to share the same colour settings for both screens. An
optional "mask~ can be added after the screen number,
which will only let selected colours be loaded . Please see
the Get Bob Palette command in Chapter 9 for full details
of how to create a "mask", or refresh your memory by
looking at the masks in Screen Tutorial05.AMOS" again.


			-=- 188 -=-

FADE EFFECTS
------------
When the image on one screen dissolves and melts into
the image of another screen, the effect is called a "fade".
Easy AMOS lets you produce some superb fade effects,
and we've supplied you with two of our ready-made
demos to prove it

APPEAR
-------
This command creates a fade between two pictures.
Choose the number of the source screen where the
picture comes from, then the number of the destination
screen whose picture it fades into. Advanced
programmers can use the Logic and Physic functions
instead of screen numbers. Then choose what sort of
fade effect you want, by setting a value that ranges
between the number of every pixel on the screen all the
way down to one. The next demo program shows a
simple but very effective fade, using Appear:

  Screen Tutorial07.AMOS

Normally the Appear command will affect the whole of
-the screen area, but this can be changed so that only part
of the screen is faded. All screens are drawn from top to
bottom, so you can set the area to be affected with the
fade by adding the number of pixels of that area, like
this:

Load "Easy_Tutorial:Bobs/Baby_AMOS.Abk"

Flash Off : Get Bob Palette

Paste Bob 100,0,1
 
Wait 100

Screen Open 1,320,90,16,Lowres

Flash Off : Get Bob Palette

Appear 0 To 1,1,13900

			-=- 189 -=-

That would fade the top part of the default screen into
screen 1. For something much simpler followed by
something much more spectacular, read on


A completely different set of fade effects can be created
using colours instead of pictures.

FADE
----
The classic "fade to black" movie effect takes the current
palette and gradually fades their values to zero. Set the
speed of the fade by choosing the number of vertical
blank periods between each colour change. Try this
now:

Flash Off : Curs Off

Centre "GOOD NIGHT"

Fade 5

It is sensible to wait until the fade has ended before going
on to the next program instruction, and you can calculate
the length of the wait with this formula:

  wait = fade speed * 15

So the last example is sure to work with the rest of your
program if the third line is changed to this:

  Fade 5 : Wait 75

By adding a list of colour values the fade effect will
generate a new palette, and it is used like this:

  Flash Off : Curs Off

Centre "RED SKY AT NIGHT"

Fade 5,$100,$F00,$300

			-=- 190 -=-


You can set up any number of new colours like-this,
depending on the maximum number allowed in your
current graphics mode. Any settings that you leave out
will leave those colours completely unchanged by the
fade, as long as you include the right number of commas.
For example:

  Fade 5,,$100,,,$200,$300

There is an even more powerful use of the Fade command,
which takes the palette from another screen and fades it into
the colours of the current screen. You set up the speed in the
same way as before, and then add the number of the screen
whose palette is to be accessed. By using a negative number
instead of a screen number, the palette from the Bob bank will
be loaded during the fade.

This next ready-made example will knock your socks off! It
was written in less than an hour by Richard Vanner, and the
Author of this Manual must confess that Richard is responsible
for all the best demos in the Bobs and Screens Chapters. Get
your sunglasses ready and enjoy this one:

  Screen Tutorial08.AMOS

There is one more parameter you can add if you like, and this
creates a mask that allows only certain colours to be faded in.
The mask is a bit-pattern from O to 15, and any bit that is set to
1 will be affected by a colour change. For example:

  Load Easy_Tutorial:Bobs/Baby_AMOS.Abk

  Screen Open 1,320,90,16,Lowres

  Flash Off

  Paste Bob 100,0,1

  Wait 100

  Fade 1 To 0,%1111000011001010


			-=- 191 -=-

ZOOMING
--------
One of the most spectacular screen effects is also one of
the simplest.

ZOOM
----
This command takes a rectangular block of graphics,
shrinks it or magnifies it and then deposits the new
image wherever you want. Follow the Zoom instruction
with the number of the screen from where the image will
be grabbed, then include the coordinates of the image
with the top left-hand coordinates followed by the bottom
right-hand coordinates, next specify the number of the
destination screen where the resized graphics are going
to end up and finally give the new corner-to-corner
coordinates of the zoomed image. This example takes
an image from screen zero, changes its width and then
deposits it on screen number 1. After checking the
listing, [Run] the program, and then keep pressing a key
to stretch our cartoon character to his limits:

  Screen Tutorial09.AMOS

The zoom effect depends entirely on the sizes of your
source and destination rectangles, and because Easy
AMOS will automatically resize these images, you can
stretch them, squash them or zoom them in proportion
to one another as you please.

Screen Zones
------------
Rectangular chunks of screens can be turned into special
numbered "zones". These act as detection areas, and
they are very useful in both practical programs and
computer games. For example, they can be used to
check on the activities of a Bob in a part of the screen, to
detect if it has entered or left the area, or collided with
another Bob. They can also be used to set up control
panels and dialogue boxes, with individual zones
representing buttons, switches and triggers for all sorts
of options.

			-=- 192 -=-


The only limit to the number of these detection zones is
the amount of available memory, so you could create
hundreds of them if necessary. Before screen zones can
be set, the right amount of memory has to be reserved for
their use.

RESERVE ZONE
------------
Memory is reserved using this command. Reserve Zone
allocates the exact amount of memory for the number of
zones you want to set up. For example, if you wanted to
create a dozen detection areas on the screen, you would
use this:

 Reserve Zone 12

To restore the reserved memory back to your main
program, you simply use this command with no number
parameter. Likethis:

  Reserve Zone

SET ZONE
--------
Each zone needs eight "bytes" of memory, and once the
memory has been reserved, rectangular zones can be set
ready to be tested in action. A number is allocated to the
zone, followed by the zone coordinates from the top left-
hand To the bottom right-hand corners, like this:

  Set Zone 1,50,150 To 75,160

=ZONE
-----
You now need a way of testing to see if an object's
coordinates are inside any particular zone. Use the Zone
function like this:

  Z=Zone(x,y)

After that line has been called, Z will hold the number of
the zone at coordinates x,y. If more than one zone has
been set up there, the number of the first zone will be
held. If no zone has been set up there, a value of zero is
held.

                              -= 193 -=- 

These graphic coordinates normally relate to the current
screen, but another screen number can be included in
front of the coordinates, like this:

 Z=Zone(l,x,y)

You can also use the X Bob and Y Bob functions together
with this function to detect the number of any zones
visited by a particular Bob. So to keep track of Bob
number 5, you would use something like this:

  Z=Zone(X Bo~(5),Y Bob(5))

=MOUSE ZONE

This function works in much the same way, and is used
to check if the mouse pointer has entered a zone. For an
instant example, take a look at the next demonstration
program in the "~Screen Tutorials" folder:

  Screen Tutorial10.AMos

RESET ZONE
----------
This comrnand switches off all the detection zones created
by SetZone, but it does NOT return the memory allocated
by Reserve Zone back to the main program. If you
follow Reset Zone by any zone number, then only that
numbered zone will be switched off. For example:

  Reset Zone 1

You can also surround a string of text with a screen zone.
This allows you to set up your own menus and dialogue
boxes on screen, which will act like the option "buttons"
used throughout the Easy AMOS menus.

ZONE$
-----
The Zone$ function works with the following parameters:

  X$=Zone$(text$,number)

where text$ contains the string of characters for one of

			-=- 194 -=-

your "buttons", and number refers to the number of the screen
zonetobedefined. Inthiscase,the"button"wouldbeactivated
automatically if X$ was printed to the screen.

SCREEN BLOCKS
-------------
If you have used all the wonders of the Easy AMOS Bob Editor,
you should be familiar with the idea of grabbing a block of
graphics from a screen. To get the best results from this part
of the Chapter, open a suitable screen now and load in your
&vourite IFF picture, or draw some shapes on the screen and
fill them with different patterns, ready to grab and use as
blocks.


Graphic Blocks are not saved along with your programs, so the
following Block instructions are used to hold and manipulate
temporary graphics data. Blocks are very useful for setting up
items such as dialogue boxes, by saving background areas
before new graphics get displayed . They can be used to create
the "parts" for all sorts of entertainment programs like visual
puzzle games, as well as more serious programs such as
designing kitchen plan layouts.

GET BLOCK
---------
To grab a rectangular area from the current screen graphics,
and turn it into a block, the Get Block command is used,
followed by your choice of a block number ranging f~m one
all the way up to 65535 You then set the coordinates of the
block to be grabbed as follows: the x,y coordinates for the top
left-hand corner of the block, the number of pixels making up
the width, then the number of pixels making up the height of
the block

A "mask" code number can be added to the end of these
parameters if you like. If the mask code is set to Q the block will
destroy and replace any graphics that used to occupy its
position on the screen. If the mask code is set to 1, the block is
given a background mask and colour "zero" will be handled as
if it is transparent. Here's an example creating block number
1 with the mask code set to zero.

			-=- 195 -=-


 Get Block l,x,y,width,height,0

PUT BLOCK
---------
To redraw a block at its original coordinates on the
current screen, simply add the block's identification
number to the Put Block command, like this:

 Put Block 1

If you want to draw the block at a new position, then add
the new x,y-coordinates after the block number. For
example:

 Put Block 1,x2,y2

The next ready-made example demonstrates how Get
Block and Put Block can be used to create a very silly,
very amusing game. First of all, it pastes four creatures
on the screen, ready to be dismembered. Then the Bobs
representing heads, bodies and legs can be rearranged
at random by pressing a key. Try it out now:

 Screen Tutorial11.AMOS

Blocks will normally be displayed using all the available
screen "bit planes". This is the same as a "bit pattern" of
%111111. Ambitious programmers may want to reset
the bit planes to create various special effects, so refer
back to the different settings in the section of this Chapter
that deals with the Screen Copy command. As usual, the
best way to get to grips with different settings is to
experiment with them. This example would put block
number 1 at coordinates x2,y2 in inverse video:

 Put Block 1,x2,y2,%00110000

DEL BLOCK
---------
To delete all of your new blocks, and return the memory
they used back to the main program, use this command:

 Del Block


			-=- 196 -=-


If you only want to get rid of a single block, then all you
have to do is follow the command with that block's
identification number, like this:

  Del Block 1

Here is a pair of simple, useful and highly effective
commands for reversing the image of a whole block.

HREV BLOCK
----------
This command reverses any numbered block by flipping
it over its own horizontal axis. Try grabbing a block
now, then put its image back on screen alongside its
reversed image.

VREV BLOCK
----------
As you would expect, this is used to flip a block over its
own vertical axis. For example:

  Vrev block 1

It's all very well wanting to use spectacular electronic
pictures in your programs. But the idea is not so attractive
when you find that large amounts of your program
memory get gobbled up every time you include a graphics
screen. What you need is a way to crunch the data that
makes up the screen graphics and pack it into a smaller
amount of memory. Then you need a way to unpack it
ready for use again. Easy AMOS helps you to do just
that.


SPACK
-----
This command stands for "screen pack", and is used to
crunch down the memory of the screen you select from
screen zero to screen 7 into a file in one of the memory
banks from bank zero to bank 15, like this example:

			-=- 197 -=-


If the bank you choose doesn't already exist, EasyAMOS
will reserve it for you before packing in the screen data,
which includes everything about the image including
its mode, size, and any offsets and display positions.

If you only want to pack a part of a screen and not bother
about the rest of it, simply add the top-left and bottom-
right corner coordinates, as usual. For example:

  Spack 7 To 15,50,50,100,100

Easy AMOS will round off the x-coordinates to the
nearest pixel boundary,and then try all sorts of methods
to pack the screen data into the smallest amount of
memory. This will take about five seconds to work out.

The next ready-made example loads an IFF picture from
your "Easy AMOS Tutorial" disc, packs it, erases the
original and then unpacks it to a new screen. Try it out
now:

  Screens Tutorial12.AM0S

PACK
----
The Pack command is slightly different from Spack,
because it only compresses the image data. This means
that the image must be unpacked into an existing screen.
Also there will be a slight flicker when the image is
unpacked, unless the screens have already been "double
buffered." It's better to use Spack for single buffered
screens. Screen numbers, memory bank numbers and
coordinates for sections of the screen to be packed are
used in exactly the same way as with the Spack command,
and x-coordinates are rounded to the nearest 8 pixel
boundary too.

			-=- 198 -=-


UNPACK
------
As you might expect, this is how a packed image is
unpacked. Using double buffered screens will give
smooth results, otherwise the unpacking can get a bit
messy. ALWAYS make sure that the destination screen
is in exactly the same format as the packed picture,
unless you want to cause an error message on your
screen.

To unpack screen data at its original position, simply say
which memory bank you want to unpack, like this:

  Unpack 15

To redraw the image starting from new coordinates,
include them after the bank number, like this:

  Unpack 15,x2,y2

To unpack the image To a particular screen, just give its
number, like this:

  Unpack 15 To 1

If the screen you select already exists, it will be replaced
by the new image. Unpacking normally takes about a
second until the image is ready to appear.

There is no point in wasting the computer's memory by
having loads of colours sitting in your paint pots if you
are only going to use two of them for some simple text.
On the other hand, there is no point restricting yourself
to 16 or 32 colo~rs if you want to create images that are
as realistic as possible. Good news. There are two
special screen "modes" that change the number of colours
for use.

			-=- 199 -=-

EHB Mode
--------
Extra Half Bright Mode

This screen mode doubles the number of available colours
to 64, by creating two colours from each of the 32 colour
registers. Colour numbers 0 to 31 are loaded straight
from one of the colour registers, as normal. But the EHB
mode creates an extra set of colours alongside the
originals, by looking at their values and dividing them
in half. This makes the new set of colours exactly half as
bright as the originals. The new set of colours are given
numbers from 32 to 63.

Obviously, you can take full advantage of EHB by
loading the 32 colour registers with the brightest colours
available, so that pastel shades are automatically
generated. Alternatively, if you were trying to create
graphics like an old fashioned photograph, you might
want to restrict your 32 colour registers to reds and
browns.

Have a look at a demonstration EHB screen now, by
loading the next example routine:

  Screen Tutorial13.AM0S

Using the EHB mode makes no difference at all to any
other parts of your programming, and EHB screens are
treated exactly the same as your normal default screen.

Hold And Modify Mode
--------------------
For an artist to carry 4096 pots of different coloured
paint around would be costly, heavy and silly. So an
artist uses common colours and mixes them together to
get the exact shade needed. Con puters use exactly the
same trick, allowing you to hold onto an existing colour
and modify it very slightly, time and time again. This is
the theory behind the Amiga's Hold And Modify mode,
or HAM for short.


			-=- 200 -=-




HAM mode splits up colour values into four separate
groups. Colours registers O to 15 are normal, and all the
others exploit the way that all colours are made up from
Red, Green and Blue components.

Before you get too excited, it must be said that HAM
mode is very difficult to use It's useful for displaying
digitised colour pictures, and there are special packages
such as the HAM version of "Dpaint 4" which fully
exploit the Amiga's colour capabilities.

Thelastready-madeexamplethatgoeswiththisChapter
opens a HAM screen ready to display all 4096 available
colours, like this:

  screen Open 0, 320, 260, 4096, Lowres

Look through the listing to see how the Red, Green and
Blue components are combined, then [Run] the program
to see the result:

  screen_Example14.AMOS

And if you think that's impressive, just wait until you
hear what Easy AMOS can do with the Amiga's sound
capabilities All is revealed in the next Chapter.

			-=- 201 -=-


			CHAPTER 12 

			   SOUND


"Music has charms
to soothe a
savage breast."
 (William Congreve,
          1697)


Your Amiga cannot generate good sound effects. Your
Amiga can generate absolutely amazing sound effects.
It can also play music like a maestro and deliver synthetic
speech. Unfortunately, trying to get the best out of its
audio output via a dwarf television speaker is like
boiling water in a chocolate kettle: pathetic. Do not
despair, there is a pair of stereo phono sockets on the
back of your machine just waiting to release superb
stereo sound into your eardrums. Connect them to a
personal stereo or a hi-fi system to liberate the full range
of sound frequencies, and Easy AMOS can guarantee
that you won't be disappointed.

All Easy AMOS sound commands operate independently
from your gameplays and utility routines, so they will
never interfere with your programMing. On the contrary,
they can enhance your work in any way you choose,
acting as markers, adding realism, soothing, shocking
or providing comic relief.


Built in Sound Effects
----------------------
You can enhance and enliven your programs with any
sound effect you like, but to get you started, Easy AMOS
comes equipped with a few built-in routines:


Try this on for size:

Boom : "Print On a stormy night."

Wait 100

Bell 1 : Print "AMOS swatted a bat."

Wait 50

Shoot : Print "Ouch!"

			-=- 204 -=-


Easy AMOS uses a clever interrupt system to
manufacture "white noise" for explosive sounds like
BOOM and SHOOT, but BELL is a simple pure tone that
you can massage by changing its "pitch", varying from
BELL 1 for a very deep ring, all the way up to BELL 96 for
the sort of high pitched sound that will drive the nearest
bat into a frenzy. Now try this:

  Boom: Wait 100 : Boom

  Print "On a stormier night  ": Wait 50

  For  F=1  To  96

     Bell F : Wait F/10+1 : Rem Vary delay

     Next F : Print "the bats had revenge."

     Wait 50 : Shoot : Wait 50 : Shoot

  Print "Ouch!"


SYNTHETIC SPEECH
----------------
You are not restricted to printing words up on your
screen. Your Amiga can say them! Before Easy AMOS
gets verbal, a NARRATOR device will automatically
load off disc in a few seconds. After that, speech is
almost instant.

SAY
---
Simply use the SAY command followed by the words
and punctuation you want Easy AMOS to speak, inside
inverted commas:

 Say "Welcome Everybody!"

Normally, any other instructions, music or sound effects
in your program will wait until Easy AMOS has finished
speaking before they start up again, and this speech
mode carries a value of zero. If you set this mode to a
value of 1, Easy AMOS is able to speak while executing
the rest of your program, although this will result in
your basic routines slowing down. Changes in mode
value are placed after a phrase, using a comma, like this:

			-=- 205 -=-


   Say "a phrase.",1

OK, have some fun getting Easy AMOS to say anything
that you want with this simple routine, but mind your
language!

   Do

   Input "Please tell me what to say:";T$

   T$=T$+

   Say T$

   Loop

SET TALK
--------
Changing the style of your synthetic speech is very easy,
using the command SET TALK followed by four
parameters separated by commas:

  Set Talk sex, mode, pitch, rate

Sex can be male (0) or female (1), or you can create
zombies, leprechauns, and much else besides by playing
with the pitch parameter.

Mode has a normal speech setting (0) or a bizarre
rhythmic pattern (1).

Pitch changes the audio frequency of the voice from bass
(65) up to soprano (320).

Rate tells Easy AMOS how many average words to
recite per minute, ranging from a slow drawl (40) to
gibberish (400). All or any of these four parameters can
be left unspecified as long as you keep the commas in
their normal positions. For example:


   Set Talk 1,1,, : Say "A rhythmic lady."

   Set Talk 0,0,320,350 :Say "Fishbubble."

   Set Talk ,,65,40 : Say "Lazy bullfrog."


			-=- 206 -=-


Now try and mix speech with sound effects and text,
something like this:

Boom: Wait 25

Print "It was the stormiest night"

Print "in the mad professor's lab."

Say "It was the stormiest night,

in the mad professor's lab."

For f = 1 to 5

  Shoot : Wait 7

  Set Talk ,1,320,50 : Say "oh no"

   Bell F : Wait 5
Next F

Wait 50

Boom


MUSICAL PITCH
-------------
Try out the second example in this Chapter again. Musical
ears may have already guessed that the numbers from 1
to 96 that are used to control the "pitch" of your BELL
correspond to the notes on a piano keyboard. 1 is the
lowest note you will hear by pressing the furthest left
white key on a piano, known as a Bottom C. 2 is
equivalent to the black note next to it, which is a C#, and
soonto "MiddleC" at 37, then all the way up to 96. Grand
piano keyboards run out of notes after 88, and most
synthesisers have a lot less than that. In Western music,
notes are given their own code letter so that musicians
can all refer to the same pitch when they are trying to
play together. These letters repeat themselves after
twelve notes, and each group of twelve is known as an
"octave".


			-=- 207 -=-

Pitch values
------------
Here is a table of pitch values, along with their musical
note equivalents and octave groupings.


                OCTAVE
      O   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
NOTE
C     1   13  25  37  49  61  73  85
C#    2   14  26  38  50  62  74  86
D     3   15  27  39  51  63  75  87
D#    4   16  28  40  52  64  76  88
E     5   17  29  41  53  65  77  89
F     6   18  30  42  54  66  78  90
F#    7   19  31  43  55  67  79  91
G     8   20  32  44  56  68  80  92
G#    9   21  33  45  57  69  81  93
A     10  22  34  46  58  70  82  94
A#    11  23  35  47  59  71  83  95
B     12  24  36  48  60  72  84  96


Imagine that your Amiga produces sound like a wide
river, flowing out from its innards. Easy AMOS lets you
split up this river into four separate channels of sound,
all pouring out at the same time. You can enjoy them
separately, or mix them together, directing the channels
straight ahead, to the left, to the right, increasing and
decreasing their volume or blocking them off altogether.
Now imagine that each of these channels can be given a
different voice. Finally, consider the possibilities of
controlling the volume and direction of each channel or
voice.


			-=- 208 -=-

Changing channel volume
------------------------
VOLUME
The VOLUME command changes the level of sound
flowing through one or more channels, ranging from 0
for complete silence up to 63 for ear-splitting, like this:

  For B=0 To 63 : Rem B sets volume

     Volume B : Bell 80 : Wait 5

  Next B

As soon as you set a VOLUME level, all future sounds
and music will flow out of your speakers at that level,
acrossall fourchannels. So you need a way to change the
volume of each voice independently from one another.

VOICE
Soundtracks are made up of one or more voices that can
act independently or together, and the VOICE command
is used to activate them. To specify which voices you
want to play, VOICE needs a "bit mask" immediately
after it, with each bit representing the state of one of the
four available "channels" through which the voices can
flow. The bit pattern is standard, with the first four bits
representing the Amiga's four possible voices. To play
a particular voice, its bit must be set to 1, otherwise it will
remain silent.


  Bit0-> Voice 0

  Bit1-> Voice 1

  Bit2-> Voice 2

  Bit3-> Voice 3

So the following VOICE commands will have these
results:
  
  Voice %0001 : Rem Activate Voice O

  Voice %1111 : Rem Activate all Voices

  Voice %1001 : Rem Voices 3 and O


			-=- 209 -=-


You can control the volume of each voice by following
the VOLUME command with a chosen voice followed
by a level of sound, like this:

    Volume voice, sound level

Now try allocating different sounds to various voices,
and change their volumes in the following way:

   Volume %0001,63

   Boom : Wait 100 : Rem Channel 1 loud

   Volume %1110,10

   Boom : Wait 50 : Rem Channels 2,3,4 soft

   Bell 40 : Wait 30 : Volume 50 : Bell 40


PLAYING NOTES
-------------
PLAY

Single notes can be played, allocated to any voice, given
a pitch and paused with a delay, all with one PLAY
command, like this:

  Play voice,pitch,delay

Voice is set in the usual bit-map format and the pitch of the
note is set by the numbers from 1 to 96 in the Octave/Note
table above. Delay sets the length of any pause between this
PLAY command and your next Basic instruction, with a delay
of zero kicking off your note and immediately jumping to the
next Basic instruction. You can now start to create some stereo
harmonies. Forexample:

    Play 1,40,0 : Play 2,50,0 : Rem No delay

    Wait Key : Rem Hit the keyboard

    Play 1,40,15 : Play 2,50,15 : Rem Delay

    Rem Play a random sequence of notes
    
    Do
    
       T=Rnd(96): V=Rnd(151: Play V,T,3
    Loop


			-=- 210 -=-


MAKING TRACKER MUSIC
--------------------
If you can't write your own musical masterpieces, don't
worry. Easy AMOS lets you take another composer's
musical sound tracks and add them to your home-grown
games and utility programs. There are thousands of
public domain soundtracks written with systems like
Soundtracker, Noisetracker and StarTracker. To make
life really easy, we have provided you with special
commands that will play any Tracker modules.

TRACK LOAD

is used to load a Tracker module into the memory bank
number of your choice. Be careful, because the first
thing it will do is erase any existing data in this bank
number before loading the new data. The new bank will
be called "Tracker".

  Track Load "modulename", banknumber


TRACK PLAY

To start your Tracker music playing, simply give this
command, followed by the appropriate bank number.
Try out a song now. Load this off your "Easy AMOS
Examples" disc:

   TrackLoad "Easy_Examples:Songs/mod.laugh",6

   Track Play ,6

If you leave out the bank number, bank number 6 will be used
as a default anyway. Most computerised composers use sets
of patterns to make up their tunes, which can be repeated in
any order that pleases the ear. You can kick off a Tracker
sequence from any one of these patterns, providing you know
what they are of course. All you have to do is add the pattern
number after the banknumber. Change the second line of that
last example and add a third line as follows. You'll be laughing
all the way to the bank:

   Track Play 6,12

   Track Loop On

			-=- 211 -=-


TRACK LOOP ON
TRACK LOOP OFF
TRACK STOP

Use these commands to make Tracker music loop over
and over again, to stop a particular loop, and to stop all
of the Tracker music currently being played.

A Tracker module can only be played while all other
Easy AMOS music is stopped. Please note that you
should ONLY use Tracker instructions while a Tracker
module is playing, so don't mix them up with other Easy
AMOS sound commands, otherwise you may get some
very peculiar noises.

Also, Easy AMOS music controls like Volume and Tempo
will have no effect on Tracker modules, which have all
of their own controls built in.

MUSIC                               

This command allows you to load and play music
created with the AMOS system, EasyAMOS's big brother.
Any pieces of music that you want to use must be held
in the music bank, which is normally bank 3. You can
play these pieces without affecting any other part of
your Basic program, because Easy AMOS the musician
is highly intelligent. For example, if any sound effects
are triggered on a channel currently playing music, that
tune will be suspended while the sound effect is playing
and will start again from its previous position once the
effect is over. You can store several musical arrangements
in the same bank, provided there is enough memory, so
to tell them apart each melody must be given its own
number.


			-=- 212 -=-

Up to three different melodies can be started at a time,
but each new MUSIC command will stop the current
song and hold its status in a stack. When the new song
has ended, the original music will start again exactly
where it left off. If you do not want your music to play
through to the end, you can halt it in one of two ways:

Stuffing up your passage
------------------------
MUSIC STOP

will bring the current single passage of music to a halt.
If there is any other active music waiting to be played,
that music will begin to play at once.


MUSIC OFF
~~~~~~~~~
is used to completely turn off all music in your program.
After using this command, you can only restart your
sound track by executing your original MUSIC
instructions all over again, right from the beginning.

MVOLUME
~~~~~~~
This command is used to set the volume of a piece of
music, or to change its volume. It must be followed by
a number between 0 for silence, up to 63 for as loud as
possible. Obviously, by setting up a simple loop, you
can fade your music up or down.

TEMPO
~~~~~
Changing the speed of a piece of music or sound effect
can enhance the mood of most programs. The TEMPO
command is used to modify the speed of your current
tune, and must be followed by a number ranging from 1
for as slow as possible, up to 100 for incredibly fast.

This will work fine unless you have taken music created
by the Soundtracker system, which may include its own
tempo labels. Any such labels will override TEMPO
settings in Easy AMOS.

			-=- 213 -=-


Volume meter
------------
=VUMETER

Most of us are familiar with the sight of Volume Meters
(Vumeters) jumping up and down on hi-fi displays.
Easy AMOS is not only able to respond to volume, but
also uses this function to make your graphics dance
around in response to the intensity of your soundtrack.
It is used like this:

  s=VUMETER(v)

where v is the voice (from 0 to 3) being tested and
returning the volume of the current note being played,
and s is an intensity value between 0 and 63.


SAmpled sound
-------------
Modern computers are able to store sound frequencies
in the form of digits. Your Amiga is a digital sound
synthesiser and Easy AMOS is ready, willing and able to
exploit its wonders. There are many digital sound
samplers on the market, and all you have to do is plug
them in to your computer, grab sound samples off CD,
cassette or radio and use them. Unfortunately there are
two problems in enjoying these sources of superb sound:
firstly sampler cartridges are rather expensive, secondly
stealing someone else's audio creations is illegal! No
problem. There are thousands of public domain sound
effects and musical instrument samples that Easy AMOS
can import and transform for your own purposes,
perfectly and legally. A tiny selection of typical samples
is included on your "Easy AMOS Examples" disc, and
we'll be loading them in a moment.

			-=- 214 -=-

Playing a sound sample
----------------------
SAM PLAY

This command squirts a lovely sampled sound through
your audio system. It can be qualified in any of the
following ways:


SAM PLAY s
SAM PLAY v, s
SAM PLAY v, s, f

where s is the number of the sample to be played,
please read on for full details.

v is a bit-map holding a list of all the voices the
sample will use, as already explained.

f sets the speed at which the sample will be played
back. This setting is given in Hertz, which is a
professional standard of measurement, but all you
need to know for now is that a rate of 4000 will do
for simple sound effectsand understandable speech
needs a rate of about 10000. Experiment and decide
what suits your samples best, then experiment again
and hear how different playback rates can create
different effects from your original sound samples.

If you can't wait to collect your own sound samples,
have some fun now with this wonderful little program.
It loads up a bank of ready-made samples from your
"Easy AMOS Examples disc, and allows you to play
them in random order:

			-=- 215 -=-


  Load "Easy_examples:sounds/Block_Samples.abk"

Try playing them rapidly like a mini-drum kit, as
well as holding down the keys to get some hammer-
drill effects. Good, isn't it.

Changing a sample bank
----------------------
SAM BANK

Digital sound samples are normally stored in
memory bank 5, but you can assign a new memory
bank to hold your sound samples with the SAM
BANK command. Just include a bank number after
this instruction and all future SAM PLAY
commands will suck their sounds from that bank.
If you set up several parallel banks, Easy AMOS
can exploit their delights at any time with a simple
call such as:

Sam Bank 4

Time for some more instant sound effects. The next
program plays the bank of samples stored on your
"Easy AMOS Examples" disc that are used in the
"Tricycle Race" game. Load this file first from
direct mode:

  Load "Easy_Examples:sounds/tricycle_samples.ab"

Now hear what's stored in that memory bank, using
this:

  For a = 1 to 11

    Print "Sample Number ";A

    For b = 1 to 3

      Sam play A 

      Wait 20
 
    Next B

   Next A

Playing a sample from memory
----------------------------

SAM RAW

You don't have to hold a sound sample in a special
bank. In fact, it can be stored anywhere that suits you
in the computer's memory, loaded using BLOAD, then
played with the SAM RAW command. When this type
of sample is called up, it is known as a "raw sample", and
it's up to you to enter the sample parameters longhand
so you can scan through any sound library discs. The
parameters are as follows:

  Sam Raw voice,address,length,frequency

Voice has already been explained.   

Address refers to the location address of your sound
sample, and the simplest location is within an existing
Easy AMOS memory bank.

Length confirms the digital length of the sample that
you want to play in bytes.

Frequency dictates the playback speed of the original
sample in Hertz, please refer to SAM PLAY above. A
typical raw sample command looks like this:

  Reserve as work 10,39852

  R$="Easy_Examples:Sounds/tricycle_samples.abk"

  Bload R$,start(10)
  
  Sam Raw 15,start(10),length(10),1000


Repeating a sample
------------------
SAM LOOP

If there is any reason that you need to repeat samples
over and over again, Easy AMOS can help you with a
single command.

  Sam Loop On

ensures that all sound samples which follow will be
looped continuously, whereas

   Sam Loop Off

deactivates the routine.

THE SAMPLE BANK MAKER
---------------------
The whole purpose of Easy AMOS is to make all aspects
of computer programming as simple and friendly as
possible. That's why we've provided you with a ready-
made recording studio for creating your own sample
banks! Load it from the "Easy AMOS Programs" disc
now:

     Sample_Bank_Maker.AMOS

The working screen looks like this, so get ready for your
guided tour around its amazing capabilities:

			-=- 219 -=-

Current sample window
---------------------
The top of the screen is divided into two. The left-
hand side is a special window where the current
sample is displayed as a visual "wave pattern".
You can load an example and view it in a moment.
Silence is represented as a straight line, and sound
frequencies are displayed as jagged patterns of
vertical lines from the beginning to the end of the
sample. As the sample is "played", you will see
how the wave pattern corresponds to what you
hear. The name of the current sample will be
displayed above this window, along with its length
in bytes.


Sample bank
-----------
The right-hand side is where the contents of the
sample bank is displayed. Each sample is listed
with its own number, name and length in bytes. As
usual, a slider-bar and slider arrows are provided
to display any parts of the contents list that are too
big to fit into the display.

Between the Current Sample Widow and the list of
samples in the bank are two big buttons. These are
used to transfer a sample from one side to the
other. So you can pull a sample from the bank, test
it or work on it while it's in the Current Sample
Window, and then transfer it back at the selected
position in the bank. If a copied sample is
positioned as the last one in your bank, it becomes
a new sample to be added at the end of the bank.

An Information Line runs across the whole of the
screen. Below that isyour panel of workingbuttons.
Let's load up some samples to work on now.


			-=- 220 -=-


Use the mouse to trigger all of the control buttons, as
usual. Have your "Easy AMOS Examples" disc ready in
the drive, and get ready to edit "Easy Examples:sounds/
Block Samples.abk" after pressing [Load Bank]. The
numbers, names and lengths of all the samples should
appear in the sample bank.


Now load a sample into the Current Sample Window.
Try selecting "Quackers", by highlighting it and then
[Left]. When a "raw" sample is loaded, its name is
computed from the file name, and its frequency is
automatically set to 8363 Herz (the Soundtracker default
setting.) If a sample is held in "IFF", its own name and
frequency are automatically grabbed. As soon as a
current sample has been loaded, all the other control
buttons become active.


If your audio system is ready, [Hear] the current sample
now. See how the frequency pattern is shown between
the "start" and "end" borders of the Current Sample
Window as the sample plays. You are now ready to start
editing the sample.


Trigger the ~Start] and [End] arrows to move the settings
for the beginning and end of the current sample. As soon
as these settings are moved off the window boundaries,
vertical lines appear to mark the new start and end
positions. You can also click directly on the start and end
lines in the Current Sample Window, and drag them to
change their positions. If you are using "Quackers", try
to isolate a single "quack" and [Hear] the result.

			-=- 221 -=-


The frequency at which a sample is played is measured
in Hertz, and by changing this frequency you can create
wonderful effects. Thispanel contains "plus" and "minus"
buttons with the [+++] button for rapid raising of the
frequency, the [-] button for fine-tuning downwards,
and so on. Try changing the frequency of the current
sample by decreasing the Hertz setting now, and [Hear]
it. Next, raise the frequency until your duck sounds
demented. If you use the RIGHT mouse button when
setting frequencies, you will get rapid level changes.

Trigger this button if you want to rename your edited
sample. You can type in up to eight characters after the
prompt, and the new name will appear.

When you've finished editing the current sample, you
can [Save] everything that is held between the start and
end lines in the Current Sample Window as an "IFF" file.
These "Interchangeable File Formats" are commonly
used to store data that can be read by different machines.
Any changes you have made to the sample's frequency
and name will be saved as well.

Finally, let's look at the remaining buttons that control
the Sample Bank Maker.


Thisinsertsan "empty" sample at the highlighted position
in your bank, where it waits to be filled. Use it to copy
the current sample to anywhere you like in the bank.


This is a powerful setting, so be careful when you use it.
The highlighted sample isdeleted from the samplebank
when you press this button, and it can NOT be recovered!

			-=- 222 -=-


To clear the entire sample bank, use the [Clr Bank]
button.


To give your sample bank a new identity, use the [Save
As] option, otherwise [Save Bank] will commit your
edited sample bank to the safe-keeping of the current
disc. The [Quit] button is at the top of the screen, and will
take you back to the Edit Screen. Let's go back now and
look at some audio waves.


Twiddly Bits (FUCKING LAME OR WHAT!)
------------------------------------
It has been explained how pure notes are summoned up
using the PLAY command, but Easy AMOS is happy to
PLAY much more complex sounds using professional
twiddly bits like wave forms, white noise, filters and
envelopes.

Making waves
------------
Every individual sound has its own identity pattern; a
sort of audio fingerprint. That is because each sound is
composed of its own special frequencies. We have all
seen a hospital monitor screen with a moving wave
pulsing in time to the frequencies of a heartbeat. Different
sounds create different waveforms in exactly the same
way: a cymbal crash has a waveform of jagged peaks
very close together, whereas the smooth harmonics of a
cello make much more rounded waves.

SET WAVE
--------
This command is used to set up the waveform for any
sound that you want Easy AMOS to PLAY. Each wave
carries its own identity number followed by a string that
defines the shape of the wave, like this:

  set wave 2, s$

			-=- 223 -=-

Wave number 0 has already been allocated to the
sort of random noise shape that produces
percussion effects, wave 1 has been preprogrammed
with a smooth shape for generating pure tones, so
start your own WAVE numbers from 2 onwards.
Shape strings are set using a list of 256 numbers,
with each number representing its own part of the
complete waveform. Each number can range from
127 at the peak of any part of the wave, down to -
128 at the bottom of a wave pit. Don't forget that
Easy AMOS strings can only hold positive numbers,
but the solution for entering negatives is easy:
simply add 256 to any negative number. Before
you can play a waveform, Easy AMOS must be
instructed which channels are going to be used for
pumping out the sound.


Assigning waves to channels
---------------------------
WAVE

The WAVE command assigns whatever wave
number you specify to one or more sound channels,
in the following way:

  Wave 2 to 15

Remember that voices contain a bit-map pattern,
and will be unaffected by any wave unless a bit in
the pattern is set to 1. If this is done, the appropriate
voice will be triggered by PLAY. This can be
demonstrated by:

 Wave 0 To %1111 : Rem Play all voices

 Play 20,10

 Wave 1 To %0001 : Rem Assign voice zero

 Play 60,0


			-=- 224 -=-


Assigning samples to waves
---------------------------
SAMPLE

To PLAY one of your samples stored in the sample bank
directly in your program, a very powerful command is
provided. SAMPLE assigns the specified sample number
to the current wave, like:

  Sample 1 To 15

And you can choose a range of voices to be set by the
SAMPLE command with a standard "bit-map".

You must experiment with the range of notes that any
particular sample can handle, but anything between 10
and 50 seems to be satisfactory.

DEL WAVE
--------
To get rid of a wave that has been set up with a SET
WAVE instruction, simply use this command followed
by the number of the wave you wish to vaporise. When
this has been done, all voices will be set to the standard
default sine wave. The pre-set waves 0 and 1 cannot be
eradicated, so you can only delete waves 2 and upwards.
For example:

  DEL WAVE 2


NOISE
-----
This command has the same affect as assigning the white
noise waveform zero to the selected voices, and is used
to form the foundations for a whole range of special
effects such as explosions and percussion drumming.
For example:

   Noise To 15
   Play 60, 50
   Play 30, 0


			-=- 225 -=-

Making an audio envelope
------------------------
SET ENVEL

An envelope is audio jargon for the life cycle enjoyed by
individual sounds: the way they are born, live and die
away. Like waveforms, envelopes have their own distinct
shapes, usually seen as having four parts: attack (how a
sound builds up), decay (the way it fades), sustain (how
long it hangs on) and release (the manner in which it
ends.) Easy AMOS uses envelopes to change your
original waveforms during their short life, according to
a set pattern, and they have the following parameters:

SET ENVEL wave,phase TO duration,volume

Wave is simply the number of the waveform you are
targeting. Any number can be used, including the 0 and
1 pre-sets.

Phase refers to a particular chunk of the original
waveform that is to be defined, ranging from 0 to 6.

Duration controls the length of this particular chunk or
phase of the waveform, and is expressed by each unit
representing one fiftieth of a second. This is how you
control the speed of a volume change in any phase of
your waveform.

Volume specifies the volume to be reached by the end of
this phase, ranging from 0 for silence to 63 for full blast.
So that:

Set Envel 1,0 To 200,63

will affect waveform number 1, and act on chunk zero
(its first phase, lasting 4 seconds), ramping it up to full
volume by its end, no matter what its original volume
was.


		 	-=- 226 -=-

Filtering sounds
----------------
LED

Most tape recorders and hi-fi systems have some sort of
filtering system to filter out unwanted hissy frequencies
and clean up sound . When you use filters there is always
a trade off between quality against audio definition.
You will have to experiment with the LED function and
decide for yourself if you want to sacrifice natural high
frequencies in order to reduce distortion, and Easy
AMOSmakesyourdecision incredibly simple. Its LED
ON with your music and sound effects to see if they are
more pleasing. If it works for certain sequences but not
for others, allow the original sounds to come through
with LED OFF.

In the next Chapter, you will enhance your home-grown
creations with your new knowledge, and turn them into
audio-visual spectaculars.

			Chapter 13


			   MATHS

"I don't believe
in mathematics."
   (Albert Einstein,
          1954)

ARITHMETIC
-----------
Easy AMOS isn't proud, and is happy to perform the
most humdrum maths operations. Nothing can be
simpler than running this wee sum:

 Print 2+2

Arithmetic operations are dead easy, provided you use
the right symbols:

+ the plus sign always signals addition
- the minus sign is used for subtraction

*  but for multiplication an asterisk must be used
/  and division is made using this slash symbol

^ in Easy AMOS maths, this character is what is known
  as an 'exponential symbol'. It means 'raise a number
  to a given power', which is exactly the same as
  multiplying a number with itself, so that:
  Print 3"5

  is the same as typing in:

  Print 3*3*3*3*3

Now run this calculation:

  Print 2+2*2

Something appears to have gone horribly wrong!
Everyone knows that 2 plus 2 is four, times two equals
8, but Easy AMOS reckons the answer is 6.

Philosophers might argue that both answers are right,
but this would lead to arithmetical chaos. In fact Easy
AMOS is only taking your instructions literally, and
working on a set of built-in priorities. Make your
intentions clear with this:

 Print (2+2 ) *2


			-=- 230 -=-
                                               

Expressions
-----------
A combination of calculations is called an expression,
and Easy AMOS handles expressions in strict order of
priority. Any 'exponentials' arecalculated first. Then
any multiplications and divisions are calculated,in order
of appearance from left to right. Only after these have
been dealt with will additions and subtractions be
attended to, again in order from left to right.

You can get round thi s rigid system by using brackets (),
and anything inside your brackets is evaluated first and
treated as a single number.

The following calculation gives a result of 43

  Print 10+2*5-8/4+5^2

because it is evaluated in the following order:
   
   5^2    = 25
   2*5    = 10
   8/4    =  2
   10+10  = 20
   20-2   = 18
   18+25  = 43

If you add two strategic pairs of brackets to the same
calculation, you transform its logical interpretation,
resulting in an answer of 768:

   Print (10+2)*(5-8/4+5)^2

because it is now calculated in this order:

  10+2   = 12
  5-8/4+5 =  5-2+5
  5-2+5   =  8
  8^2     = 64
  12*64   =768

			-=- 231 -=-

VALUES
------
It is obvious that every expression has a value, but
expressions need not be restricted to whole numbers
(integers), or any sort of numbers. Expressions can also
be made up of real numbers or strings of characters. If
you need to compare two expressions, Easy AMOS has
a pair of functions that will look at them and work out
which has the maximum or minimum value.


Comparing values
----------------
= MIN
= MAX

Different types of expressions cannot be compared in
one instruction, so they should not be mixed. If you
want to compare the values of two integers, or fractional
numbers, or character strings, and find the maximum
value, use:

  v=MAX(x,y)
  v#=MAx(x#,y#)
  v$=MAX(x$,y$)

In the same way, if the minimum of two values is wanted
from a similar pair, use:
  
   v=MIN(x,y)
   v#=MIN(x#,y#)
   v$=MIN(x$,y$)

Try to understand why these comparisons give the
results listed on the next page:

   Print Max(99,1)

   A=Min(99,1) : Print A

   Print Max("Easy AMOS", "AMOS")

   Print Min("Easy AMOS", "AMOS")


			-=- 232 -=-


   99 

   1

   EASY AMOS

   AMOS

Finding a sign
--------------
=SGN

Any number can have one of three values: negative,
positive or zero. Easy AMOS uses the SGN function to
discover and tell you the sign of any integer or fractional
number.

  s=SGN (v)

  s=SGN (v#)

The three possible results are these:

  -1 if the value is negative

  1  if the value is positive

  0  if the value is zero


Absolute Values
---------------
=ABS

This command is used to convert arguments into a
positive number. ABS returns an absolute value of an
integer or fractional number, paying no attention to
whether the number is positive or negative, in other
words, ignoring its sign.

r=ABS (v)
r#=ABS (v#)

for example

 Print Abs (-1) ,Abs (1)

will result in

  1 1

			-=- 233 -=-

=SQR
----
This function calculates the square root of a positive 
number. That is to say, it finds out what number has to
be multiplied by itself to give the requested value. So the
value of 5 will be given for this:           

 print sqr(25)

 
FLOATING POINT NUMBERS
----------------------
Arguments that consist of a load of numbers either side
of a decimal point can often give very messy results in
Basic programming. The decimal point floats backwards
and forwards along such calculations, slowing things
up and usually giving levels of accuracy way beyond
your needs. Easy AMOS can change these "floating
point numbers" to make them more useful in terms of
programming speed or accuracy.


Making integers
---------------
=INT

In an expression like i=INT(v#), the INT function rounds
down a floating point number to the nearest whole
number, the nearest integer. So that:

 Print Int(3.99999)

will be rounded down to 3, whereas:

 Print Int(-1.1)

is rounded down to -2



Setting Accuracy
----------------
FIX

Supposing you are computing your bank balance, but
you only want to see your money displayed to the
nearest penny, or cent, or pfennig. Easy AMOS uses the
FIX instruction to change the way floating point numbers
are displayed or printed out.

FIX (n)


			-=- 234 -=-


If n is bigger than zero and smaller than 7, then that will
be the number of figures shown after the decimal point.

If n is greater than 15, any trailing zeros will be removed.

If n is less than zero, the absolute value of n will determine
the number of digits after the decimal point, and all
floating point numbers will be shown in 'exponential'
format.

Try these examples:

   Fix(2): Print PI#

   Rem Two digits after the decimal point

   Fix (-4) : Print PI#

   Rem Exp with four digits after point

   Fix (7) : Print PI#

   Rem Revert to normal printout


Trigonometry
-------------
Although you used PI# for the last examples, you may
not understand why the number beginning 3.14 popped
up. PI is the Greek letter that is used to summon up a
number which begins 3.141592653 and goes on for ever
and ever. In trigonometry, PI is the tool for calculating
aspects of circles and spheres, so it can be very useful for
working out angles, distances over curves, trajectories
in gameplay, or even musical waveforms.

             
			-=- 235 -=-

Using Pi
--------
=PI#

To avoid any clashes with your own variable names, use
the # character as part of the PI token name.


Supposing you need to know more about a circle. Look
at the diagram, where a point has moved from the right-
hand side of the x-axis up along the perimeter for a
distance a, and stopped at position b. Really, we would
not refer to a as the number of degrees in the angle
between the x-axis and the line from the centre of the
circle to point b, because computers normally use units
known as 'radians' instead of degrees.


Using Degrees
-------------
DEGREE

If you are unhappy with the complexities of radians,
Easy AMOS is happy to accept instructions using degrees.

Once this instruction has been given, all further calls to
trigonometry functions will expect to use any angles to
be given in degrees, like this:

   Degree

   Print Sin (45)



Using Radians
-------------
RADIAN

As has been explained, your Amiga uses a default by
which it expects all angles to be given in radians.

If you have used DEGREE and you want to get back to
normal using radians for all future angles, simply give
the RADIAN instruction.


			-=- 236 -=-

Finding Signs
-------------
=SIN

This function calculates how far point b is above the x-
axis, and this distance is known as its sine. It always
returns a floating point number, for example:

    Degree
    
    For X=0 To 319

      Y#=Sin(X)

      Plot X,Y#*50+100

    Next X

Finding Cosigns
---------------
=COS

The distance that point b is to the right of the y-axis is
known as the cosine. If b goes to the left of the y-axis, its
cosine value becomes negative.

Similarly, if it drops below the x-axis, the sine results in
a negative value. Try adding the following two lines to
your last example between the Plot and Next instructions.

    Y#=Cos(X)

    Plot X,Y#*50+100


Going off at a tangent
----------------------
=TAN

For any angle, when you divide its sine by its cosine you
get what is called its tangent. TAN is the function that
gives this tangent. Supposing that a is 45 degrees,
making its sine and cosine equal in length. See if you can
manipulate the floating point number to give the correct
answer for:

    Degree

    A#=45 : Print Tan(A#)

			-=- 237 -=-


RANDOM NUMBERS
--------------
Creating
random
sequences

Imagine greeting Easy AMOS every morning with "How
areyou today?" and the answer always cameback, "Very
well, thank you." What a predictable relationship that
would be. The easiest way to introduce an element of
chance or surprise into a program is to throw some
numbered options into an electronic pot and allow Easy
AMOS to pull one out at random. After one has been
selected and used, it gets thrown back into the pot and
has an equal chance along with all the others of being
used again.


=RND
-----
You can generate integers at random between zero and
any number you place in brackets after the RND function.
If this number is less than zero, RND will return the last
value it pulled out of the pot. Try generating random
colours and positions with this:

 Do

   C=Rnd(15): X=Rnd(320): Y=Rnd(200)

   Ink c: Text X,Y, "Easy AMOS AT RANDOM"

 Loop

If the number you choose to put in brackets after Rnd is
greater than zero, a "real" random number will be
generated. If the number equals zero, then the last
random number is generated.

Using the random number generator, you can turn Easy
AMOS into a card dealer, the creator of an ever-changing
galaxy or much more interesting and unpredictable
when you ask the question, "How are you today?"

			CHAPTER 14

                      CREATING A GAME

"Games are a
serious business."
(Anacharsis, 600 BC)


Wouldn't it be amazing if you could get inside another
programmer's head and see how the brain works. Impossible?
Anything is possible with Easy AMOS, even a brain transplant!

The time has come to use all of your new knowledge and
experience for the serious business of examining some not so
serious games, written by the experts. This Chapter gives you
background information about the example games to be
found on your Easy AMOS discs. The authors have included
loads of helpful notes and comments in their listings, and you
can almost hear them thinking aloud, as they explain their
techniques to you. Follow this Chapter as you go through their
ideas on screen, and enjoy the games as you learn from them.

Any keywords and techniques you are not sure about can be
examined using the [Help] feature, or you can look them up
in the Glossary. Lets start with a computing classic!


Blockbuster
-----------
Please load this game from your "EasyAMOSExamples" disc,
using the File Selector:

Block Buster.AMOS

It has been written for you by Ronnie Simpson, and you are
invited to use the "bat" at the bottom of the screen to bounce the
"ball" and knock "bricks" out of the wall. After playing it a few
times, go into the Editor and look through the ]listing to
examine how everything works. There are some very useful
notes and tips at the end of the listing but in case you get lost,
these are the main points you should look for.


PROCEDURES
-----------
First of all identify all these procedures and see what each of
them is used for:

Variable list
-------------
Here is a table of the variables in the game, to help you
understand what they are used for.

A   makes a "hard" ball if A=-1
B   creates a "magnetic" bat if B=-1
C   is the bonus number you have won
DC  delay count to control ball speed
DX  amount to be added to the ball's X
DY  amount to be added to the ball's Y
E   is the number of "bricks" in the level
H   is the zone number under the ball
I   is the size of the bat being used
M   indicates the number of lives left
Q   counts the number of "bricks" that have been
    removed, before raising your bonus number
S   is the score for the current level
ST  is the score total for all levels
SH  is the highest score so far
TI  dictates the image number for ~Smiley"
TX  is the amount to be added to Smiley's X
TY  is the amount to be added to Smiley's Y
U   refers to Smiley's X position
V   refers to Smiley's Y position
W   is the number of the current level
X   refers to the Ball's X position
Y   refers to the Ball's Y position
Z   has various non-global uses, such as For/Next
    loops


			-=- 241 -=-
Arrays
------
Now look for these three arrays, and see how they hold
the coordinates of the "bricks".

x() holds the X coordinates of all possible brick
    positions

y() holds the Y coordinates of all possible brick
    positions

n() holds the number of "hits" needed for each
    brick position.

The Bobs have been allocated these numbers:

  1 the ball
  2 the bat
  4 the bonus pointer
  5 speed number
  6 "Smiley"

Programming hints
-----------------
This section is a brief tour of some of the most important
parts of the program. The "line numbers" referred to are
displayed in the Information Line of the Editor Screen,
as you scroll up and down the listing. Make sure you
have opened all the procedures with [Alt]+[F7]. Instead
of going through them in order of appearance, let's look
at them feature by feature.


Setting up the screen
---------------------
(line 218) The screen is loaded from the disc using Load
Iff, and then packed to Bank 5.

(line 127) This unpacks the screen at the start of each
level of play.

(lines 135 to 146) The data for the "bricks" is held in Bank
9, and this data is read before each level of play is started .
After establishing the brick's colour and the number of
"hits", a screen zone is set up for each brick.


			-=- 242 -=-

Moving the bat
--------------
(line 202) Here's where the mouse is made invisible.

(line 109) This limits the mouse to a small area of the
	   screen.

(line 31) The mouse coordinates are transferred to the
          bat.

(lines 109 and 111) When a different sized bat is selected
as a bonus, the Limit Mouse command must be updated
to make sure that the bat is kept inside the playing area.

Moving the ball
---------------
(line 41) The ball is moved by changing the X and Y
variables, using DX and DY as the amount to be added
in either direction. This is how the different angles of
"bounce" are calculated.

(lines 36 to 38) This is where checks are made while the
main loop is active, to see if the ball has hit the sides of
the playing area, or missed the bat.

(line 39) A test is also made to check if the ball has entered
any of the screen zones that represent a brick. If it has,
the appropriate brick is removed, otherwise a short
delay loop is used to make up for the time it would have
taken to erase the brick.

Speeding up the ball
--------------------
(line 49) The program is slowed down to playing speed
by a delay loop inside of the main loop.

(line 34) When the DC counter reaches its target, the
delay loop is shortened and so the ball speeds up.

Animating Smiley
----------------
(line 46) Four different images of the "Smiley" Bob are
held in the Bob bank, and these are displayed in turn to
give the illusion of movement. A random number has
been used to slow down the speed of the animation.
Remember, Smiley's images are in bank areas 14 to 17.

(Lines 44, 45 and 47) A similar routine to the one used for
moving the ball is used to control Smiley's movement
and restrictions.

We have provided a useful help file for you to examine,
on the "Easy AMOS Examples~ disc:

     Block_Buster_HELP.AMOS

Feel free to adapt and change this game in any way you
want. Later in this Chapter you'll be offered hi-score
and title sequences if you want to make use of them.

BUILDING A TWO-PLAYER GAME
--------------------------
After that ready-made example, would you like to
witness the whole creation process of a computer game,
from start to finish? Better still, after learning from the
experience of a professional, do you want to rip his game
to bits and adapt it for your own use? We thought you
would.

"Tricycle Ball" has been written just for you, by the father
of Easy AMOS, Francois Lionet. The object of the game
is to use your weird tricycle to bump a ball into your
opponent's goal. Play time is split into two halves of two
minutes each, and there are several modes of gameplay
to choose from. You can struggle against another human
being or a robot player, and there is even a demonstration
mode, where two robots play against one another. There
is also a built-in facility to select an easy or a difficult
standard of skill. Best of all there are no rules at all, so
anything is allowed, including using your opponent as
the ball!

All the facilities of arcade games have been included:
timers, on-screen messages, music and sound effects.
Best of all, Francois has prepared no less than eight
separate files showing exactly how he has built up the
program, stage by stage. There are eiE~ht files that
demonstrate the build-up of the gameplay and the title
sequence.


			-=- 244 -=-


As you would expect from such a friendly programmer,
Fransois has included an automatic method of spotting
each new stage in his creation. So, before you wander
through his brain, play the completed game by loading
and running TB_Step_8.AMOS which is waiting on
your "Easy AMOS Tutorial" disc. Select a human or a
robot opponent, or choose the demo mode. You need
one or two joysticks to play the game, unless you select
demo mode.

When you are satisfied with that, load the first step of the
game's creation from the same disc:

  TB_Step_1.AMOS

and get ready to have fun as you learn.

The automatic learning system
-----------------------------
Here's how to use the automatic learning system. Start
with the first Step of the program you have just loaded.
When you have worked your way through it, move on
to Step 2, and so on until you reach Step 8. [Run] and
play with each Step as you go along, and then return to
the Editor to examine the listing.

Francois has marked each of his new features with a
special code that looks like this:

 ****

All you have to do is jump to wherever this marker
appears, using the [Ctrl]+[F] keys or call up the [Find]
option from the Editor menu by pressing the [Alt] key,
triggering [Find] and typing "***" after the prompt.
Once this sequence has been initialised, use [Find Next]
or [Ctrl]+[N] to jump to the next original idea. In this
way, you don't have to cover old ground as the program
Steps build up, and you will be taken directly to new
routines as they occur.

STEP ONE    
--------

The first moves

Welcome to the first step in this series of "Tricycle Ball"
programs. At this stage, the program is only an idea
firing across a few French brain cells, and jotted down on
the back of a dirty Metro ticket. Before any games
programming can be achieved, we need some graphics
to work with, so "our ugly Bobs" are called up. By
closing the Editor we can save some memory, and
because there is no mouse pointer required, we hide it.
Now we specify where the files are to be loaded.

Are you using [Find Next] or [Ctrl]+[N] to jump to the
next * * * marker? Then let's continue.

Now we dimension the arrays. Simply read the notes in
the listings to see how this works for the coordinates of
the player's Bobs, the direction and speed of movement,
and how the animation is set up. Next the variables for
the Bobs are initialised.

After the "playfield" is unpacked into Screen 1, look at
the table that contains all the images to display the
player's tricycle. Notice how we check to see if the game
has been interrupted, how we synchronise the display
using three Wait commands, and how we go faster,
slower, turn left, right, brake and move the player. Now
you've got the idea of how the [Find Next] works, all we
need to tell you in this Chapter is what each Step of the
game's evolution contains. Check out all the notes for
yourself and explore the author's brain!

STEP TWO
--------

Thecollisions. Load:

        TB_step_2.AMOS

All the old *** markers from TB Step 1.AMOS have
been erased in this listing, and the *** marker is only
used to locate the new features included in this step of
the game's construction.

This stage includes the most important feature of any
arcade game:using collision detection to make the game
playable. We can exploit three types of collision in this
game:

- the relationship between the playeis Bob and the
  field of play. For example, what happens when you
  crash into the boundary wall of the playfield.

- the relationship between two opposing players' Bobs.
  For example, what happens if you avoid or collide
  with the other "tricyde".

- the relationship between the players' Bob and
  the Bob representing the ball.

STEP THREE 
----------

The scrolling screen. Load:

        TB_Step_3.AMOS

As before only the new features in this step have been
commented with the *** marker. Up to now, all the
Bobs have been moving around the full-sized Screen 1,
but now we focus our viewpoint by making the players
the centre of the action using a Screen Copy command.
This gives perfect scrolling, but we still have to exploit
the Double Buffer command to prevent flicker problems
and then synchronise the display. Finally, we are able to
create three different windows centred on each of the
two players as well as the ball, for a multi-camera effect.

STEP FOUR
---------

The Ball. Load:

   TB_Step_4.AMOS

To make the ball as realistic as possible, it has to be given
its own speed and direction and the capability to fly
through the air as well as move along the ground. This
step also shows how the ball has been made to bounce
and appear to change in size by "zooming" it. Don't
forget the whole point of these example programs is that
you are invited to change and adapt them, and it is very
simple to experiment with the values of the arrays and
variables. For example, try changing ZBALL to a different
value, and alter the zoom effect.

STEP FIVE    
---------
The robot. Load:

   TB_Step_5.amos

This kind of arcade game is more entertaining when two
humans play against one another, but it must also allow
one human to play against the computer. This step
shows how a robot player is created, and how the robot
is made "intelligent" . See how it decides if it should wait
and do nothing, or try and hit the other player or go for
a goal. It is also demonstrated how the robot can be
made more skillful to give its human opponent a tougher
challenge, but not so clever that it would be impossible
to beat it.

STEP SIX
--------

Cleaningup. Load:

  TB_Step_6.AMOS

This is where the twiddly bits are added to the gameplay
parameters. Goals need to be detected and displayed, a
timer must be included and the speed of play needs to be
controlled. Players also need to come on and leave the
playfield at the appropriate time.

			-=- 248 -=-

STEP SEVEN
----------
The final game. Load:

   TB_Step_7.AMOS

This step is where all the sound effects and music get
added, and includes the various on-screen messages
that you would expect to see in an arcade game. Also,
you can learn how different procedures are used to
choose playing modes, in other words, your choice of
demo mode or a human/robot opponent, and the level
of difficulty.

STEP EIGHT 
----------
The title. Load:

   TB_Step_8.AMOS

This is a completely independent program, and you are
welcome to adapt it for your own creations. The
TITLE PAGE procedure is a neat package that
demonstrates how to manipulate a screen by reversing,
cloning and pasting images, and then animate the result.
But we're not quite finished yet.


HI-SCORES
----------
For the finishing touch, load up the ready-made hi-score
program written by Francois and J.P. Cassier.

Load this program from your "Easy AMOS Examples"
disc.

      HiScores.AMOS

As you would expect, all the information you need is
fully commented in the listing, so feel free to use and
adapt this colourful program or simply insert the whole
routine into your own games!

			-=- 249 -=-


Other games
-----------
There are some other fully commented example
programs on your "Easy AMOS Examples" disc. They
have been designed so that you can bolt on your own
titles and hi-score routines. Use the knowledge you
have gained from earlier Chapters to change the graphics
and create your own Bobs, as well as trying out different
sound effects, samples and music. Simply load and play
them, then examine the listings of these example
programs.


Tricycle Race
-------------
In this horizontal bike race, use the mouse or joystick
buttons to move your animated Bob from left to right.
Load:

  Tricycle_Race.AMOS
