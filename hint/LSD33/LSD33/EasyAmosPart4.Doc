		    THE EASY AMOS TUTOR



Do you think you've learned everything Easy AMOS
has to offer? This is the last Chapter featured in our very
~wn "game show" that tests your knowledge of Easy
AMOS. "Challenge AMOS" is to be found on your "Easy
AMOS Tutorial" disc, and if you haven't already played
it, treat yourself to an audio-visual extravaganza by
loading:

  Challenge.AMOS

It's even better than being on a TV quiz show, because
when you have proved your knowledge, you will become
a genuine Easy AMOS Graduate. Full details on your
Graduation Screen! The Challenge questions start on
subjects that are covered way back near the beginning of
these pages, all the way through to this Tutor Chapter.
And don't worry if you get the answers wrong, because
you can play the Challenge as many times as you like.
All the answers are to be found somewhere in this book,
and we wish you every success and look forward to
welcoming you on your Easy AMOS Graduation Day!

You are coming to the end of your course in Easy AMOS
programming, and we hope that you've found it clear,
easy and entertaining. There's one more feature to help
you monitor your new knowledge, and we've saved the
best until last! If you want to become an Easy AMOS
Graduate, you need a Tutor.


The tutor
---------
A tutor is a personal teacher who is employed to educate
and guide a student. Ideally, a tutor should be available
at all times to help the student understand anything
from basic words to complex ideas. This book can help
you in most cases, but it can never get inside your own
programs and explain what's going on. Believe it or not,
Easy AMOS can!

			-=- 328 -=-


The Easy AMOS Tutor is a very simple idea, but it's
incredibly powerful. You can call it up and use it to
examine any Easy AMOS program, any Easy AMOS
routine or even a single expression, and find out exactly
what's happening, and why.

Calling the tutor
-----------------
To call up the Easy AMOS Tutor from the Editor simply
click on the [Tutor] option in the Default Menu, or hit the
[F6] key.

TUTOR
-----
Tutor is also a command in its own right, and can be
typed from Direct Mode, or included anywhere in your
program listing. When called from inside one of your
Easy AMOS programs, this command stops the program
and summons up the Tutor screen. The tutoring process
will then start from the location immediately after the
Tutor command, ready to step on through your program
one instruction at a time. For example:

Print "	Time to call the Tutor!"

Wait 100

Tutor

Print "THIS IS IN THE NEXT INSTRUCTION"

Before the next instruction is executed, Tutor takes you
straight to its own screen, which is a monitoring system
completely controlled by the mouse. You don't even
have to type anything in! Try to resist the temptation to
start experimenting just yet. Let's go on a proper guided
tour by analysing a more complex program.

Trigger the quit icon [Q] in the top right-hand corner of
the push-button control keypad on the Tutor Screen,
and load up one of the games from your "Easy AMOS
Examples" disc now, such as:

	Tricycle_Ball.AMOS

			-=- 329 -=-


[Run] or [Fl] the game, to remind yourself how it looks.
After the title sequence, let the game play in Demo
mode. Break into the game with [Ctrl]+[C] and then
press [Spacebar] to return to the editor.

Now trigger the [Tutor] option or press [F6], and the
Tutor Screen will appear.


			-=- 330 -=-

Graphic output window
---------------------
The window in the top left-hand quarter of the Tutor
Screen is used to display the graphic output of the
current program screen, with the Screen Number
displayed above it. It reduces Lowres screens to exactly
half of the original size, so that a 320 x 200 screen fits
perfectly into this window. If a screen is larger than this
default size, you can explore it using the four directional
arrow buttons in the push-button panel. Hires screens
are NOT reduced, and you can look around them using
the direction arrows as well.

All colour animations such as Flash and Fade will be
shown during the monitoring process. If the current
screen features more than 16 colours, then colours 16 to
31, 32 to 47 and 48 to 63 will each be converted to colours
0 to 15, so HAM pictures may well produce some bizarre
results!

Now try clicking with the left mouse button in the
Graphic Output Window, and you will be returned to
the original program display for as long as you hold
down the button. This is a very useful service, to remind
you of exactly what's on the screen you are dealing with.

Each of the push-buttons in the control keypad is
triggered via the mouse.

Scrolling the screen output

The four directional arrows are used to scroll the reduced
screen in the graphic output window. Try scrolling
down and back up again. The central button in this
group selects the screen to be displayed starting from
Screen zero and then in order through any additional
screens. Flick through the screens now, until you get
back to Screen zero again.

			-=- 331 -=-


Initialising the Tutor
----------------------
This is the Initialisation button, and it has exactly the
same effect as using [Run] from the Editor. Firstly, a
[Test] of the program is performed. If Easy AMOS
comes across an error, the faulty line will be displayed in
a display window at the bottom of the screen. If the
[Test] proves successful, and there are no errors to be
reported, a [Default] command will be given to the
display, and a program pointer will be initialised at the
first instruction in the program. If you are using
"Tricycle Ball.AMOS" to test with theTutor, chances are
that no errors will be reported!

If you don't click on the [INIT] button first, you will not
be able to check through the program's instructions step
by step.

How the tutor Works
-------------------
The Easy AMOS Tutor has been designed to perform all
of these useful tasks:

To look at the instructions in your program, one at a
time, and to display a report showing the result of
what happens when its parameters have been
evaluated. In other words it can test out any
instruction in the program.

- To display Help information about any instruction
  you select.

- To supply you with the result of any expression in
  your program where possible. If there is an error in
  the expression, the offending line will be marked out.

- To provide error message reports.

The Tutor uses two windows, which take up the bottom
half of the Tutor Screen. The upper window displays the
program listing and the lower window provides all the
information on offer.


			-=- 332 -=-

The Program Listing Window
--------------------------
This window gives you a view of the current program
listing. You can look at it, and mark out items to be
examined, but you can't change anything in it. Once the
Tutor has been [INIT]ialised, helpful markers will be
shown in the program listing to remind you of the
following points:

The current program location is marked by a black
CURSOR with three little arrow-heads. It always
appears before the NEXT instruction to be examined .

- You are allowed to set a "break point" in the listing,
  and these will be marked in INVERSE VIDEO.

- Any item that you want information about will be
  UNDERLINED.

The Information Window
-----------------------
This is where all the Tutor information appears. It starts off by
displaying the next instruction to be examined, but as the other
Tutor features come into play, information is displayed in the
following order, from top to bottom in this window:

  Error messages

  Information on instructions

  Information on expressions

  Next instruction to be examined

  First parameter of the next instruction

  Second parameter, and so on.


Changing the window displays
----------------------------
Scroll bars are provided to move the display of the program
listing, vertically and horizontally in the Program Listing
Window. The "centre' button at the top right-hand corner of
the Program Listing Window is used to centre the display on
the NEXT instruction to be executed. A vertical saoll bar is
also available for the Information Window.

			-=- 333 -=-


If you click on the line between the Program Listing
Window and the Information Window you can enlarge
one window and reduce the other to a minimum of three
lines. simply drag the window boundary up and down
to change size.

Let's examine the bottom line of buttons on the control
keypad next.

One step control
----------------
Clicking on this button tells the Tutor to examine the
next instruction, give a report and then go back and wait
for your next action. The black program cursor will now
be pointing to the next instruction, and the Information
Window will also show the next instruction and give its
parameter list, if there is one.

Slow-run control
----------------
When you trigger this button, the Tutor will interpret
instructions one at a time, and redraw the whole display
after each examination. By using this option you can
follow the progress of the program listing in "slow
motion". To stop the slow-run, click on the stop button.

Stop button     
------------
The stop button brings the interpretation process to a
halt, and returns you to the Tutor. Pressing [Ctrl]+[C]
has the same effect, and so does a "break point" which is
explained in a moment. If a non-trapped error is come
across, it will be displayed in the Information Window
and you will also be taken back to the Tutor.   

Normal-run control
------------------
This button will [Run] the program from the Tutor and
update the display every 50th of a second, allowing a
faster speed of operation. To stop the process, use the
stop button.


			-=- 334 -=-

Fast-run button
----------------
When fast-run is used, the program's own display is
used and it is [Run] at full speed. If an error is not found,
the only way to come back to the Tutor during a fast-run
is to press [Ctrl] and [C] together, or use break points.


How to set a break point
------------------------
Click on the break point button with the left mouse
button as usual, then click on the instruction in the
program listing wherever you want to set the break. The
instruction will be highlighted in inverse video.

The evaluation button
---------------------
The button marked [VAL] allows you to use a very
accurate setting for the evaluation process. Click on the
button and then use your mouse to set the precise
character that marks the beginning of the expression
you want to evaluate. With the button held down, drag
it to the character in the listing to mark the end of the
expression you are interested in, and release the button
to underline the expression. That's it. The evaluation
will be reported in the Information Window.


Calling for Help!
-----------------
You need help? You get help! Click on the help button,
click on the keyword you need help with to underline it,
and the trusty Easy AMOS Help Window will appear at
your service.


Quitting the Tutor
------------------
This button takes you back to the Editor. If the system
has been called up from inside a program using the
Tutor command, you'll be returned to the program at
the instruction immediately after that command.

			-=- 335 -=-

Evaluating expressions
-----------------------
The Tutor may be simple to use, but it is incredibly
skillful in the way it analyses expressions and reports the
results back to you. Here are the ground rules for a
simple demonstration. Run this example to give yourself
something to work on, then call up the Tutor:

	A=1 ; B=2 ; C=3

	D = A+B*C-1

        Print D

Firstly, the program must be initialised. So press the
[INIT] button. Secondly, the expression must be valid,
so if you press [VAL] and asked for an evaluation of A+B
without initialising B, then you would be asking for the
impossible! Also, if you ask for an evaluation of "~", you
will told that it's impossible to evaluate something that's
plainly idiotic. On the other hand if you ask for an
evaluation of something obvious like " 1", it will be given.
Lastly, the expression must be at the same level of
procedure as the program pointer.  

With the black program cursor still on the first line of the
program listing. Trigger [VAL] and ask for an evaluation
of D by clicking on "D" in the last line of that example.
Result zero! D will only be equal to A+B*C-1 when all
the expressions have been evaluated.

Advance the process by one step, and the cursor moves
to the next expression on the first line. Now advance two
more steps, and get the correct evaluations for A, B and
C from the second line of the program. D will still come
back as zero. But by advancing another step, D is given
as 6.

The [Spacebar] can be used as a keyboard short-cut, to
advance a single step every time it is pressed.


			-=- 336 -=-

To get rid of an expression from the Information Window,
just click on it with the mouse cursor.

That was a very simple example, of course. But when
you are dealing with complex programs, you can use the
Tutor with the greatest of ease to extract all sorts of
interesting result ts from the expressions in the listing. Go
exploring one of the Easy AMOS example programs
now, and test out the Tutor on the juiciest expressions
you can find.

Happy Graduation Day!

			CHAPTER 20

			 Glossary


This Chapter is your reference guide to all the words, characters and
abbreviations you are likely to need when you use Easy AMOS. It includes 
all the Easy AMOS instructions, functions, reserved variab1es, keywords 
and controls, as well as technical terms, jargon and computer gobbledegook. 
The easiest way to understand what these terms mean is to show them who's 
boss. Use the commands fearlessly in your programming and see what 
happens, because you can't harm your Amiga by experimental programming.

All the words and abbreviations that can be used in Easy AMOS programming
are printed in bold upper case letters, like this:

APPEAR.

If any of these headings is a function, it has an equals sign in front of 
it (and if you don't know what a function is, look it up in this Glossary!). 
For example:

=ABS

Other words and jargon are shown in bold lower case, for example,

address.

Certain examples of the use of programming words are shown indented in a
different typeface, looking like this.

  Print Asc(A)

If any parts of the program examples are optional, in other words if you can
choose whether or not you want to leave them out, they are printed in 
italics like this:                                      

  Ink colour,paper,border

Obviously these are simplified examples, often using a Print statement for
instant understanding. All the uses and subtleties of the programming words
are to be found in their appropriate chapters.

When Amiga keys are indicated, they are shown inside square brackets, like
this:

[Escape].

GLOSSARY OF WORDS, CHARACTERS AND ABBREVIATIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

=ABS

Gives the ABSolute value of a number, taking no account of whether it 
has a positive or negative sign. The number must be in brackets.

  Print Abs (-5)

abk

is short for Amos memory BanK, and is used as an extension at the end of a
filename to show that the file contains one or more memory banks, like this:

  save "filename.abk"

address

is where a unit of data has taken up residence in the computer's memory. It
is just like a human address, because you need to know the number before
you can make contact.

APPEAR

fades between two graphics screens. You must specify the numbers of the
source screen and destination screen, as well as the effect you want 
ranging from 1 for a single pixel up to the maximum number of the pixels 
on your screen. Finally, you can state what area of the screen is to be 
affected, by giving the number of pixels from top to bottom of the screen.

 Appear source To destination,effect,pixels


APPEND

adds information to the end of an existing sequential file, allowing you to
expand your file after it has been defined.

  Append channelnumber, name$


AREG

creates an array of three "pseudo" variables, used to hold copies of the 
chip's first three Address, REGisters A0 to A2.

  Areg(r)=a

			-=- 341 -=-


AS

please see RESERVE


=ASC
gives the Ascii code of a character.

  Print Asc(A)


ascii

stands for American Standard Codes for Information Interchange, a 
widely used system of character codes for transferring data between 
computers, and between computers and other machines like printers. It 
can also be written as Ascii, or ASCII, but it is always pronounced 
"Asskey".


=AT
is used to position text on screen from inside a character string.

  T$=At(x,y)+ "Moved Text"


AUTOBACK

sets the automatic screen copying mode. Mode number 0 sends all 
graphics to the logical screen. Mode 1 performs each graphical operation to 
both the physical and logical screens. Mode 2 (the default) combines 
all drawing operations with the Bob updates.

  Autoback modenumber


BAR

draws a filled rectangle at the screen coordinates you want.

  Bar x1,y1 To x2,y2


Basic

nearly stands for Beginners All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code, and is
still the single most popular computer language in the world. Easy AMOS is
a very friendly and very advanced version of Basic.


BELL
plays a tone of pure sound, from a low pitch of 1 up to a very high 
pitch of 96.

  Bell pitchvalue


			-=- 342 -=-


binary

is a system of numbering using only the the two digits 0 and 1.


=BIN$
converts a number to a BINary String. An optional length parameter can
dictate the number's format.

  Print Bin$(number)

  Print Bin$(number,length)


bit

is the smallest piece of data that can be represented in the computer's 
memory by a 1 or 0.


bit-maps

and bit-patterns are little patterns of binary data consisting of a 
fixed number of bits of memory that control a specific item. You can 
select if the bits in the pattern are set to a 1 or a zero, and this 
will change the way they control the item.

blitter

is jargon for the Amiga silicon chip that can copy images to the screen 
at a rate approaching one million pixels per second.


BLOAD

LOADs Binary data into a specified address or bank number.

Bload file$,address



bob

is short forBlitter Object, a very fast-moving graphic image of up to 64 
colours. The only limit to the number of Bobs on display is the amount 
of available memory.


BOB

draws a Blitter OBject at given coordinates on the current screen. The BOB
must have an identification number, followed by the screen coordinates and
its image number assigned from the memory bank.

Bob number, x, y, imagenumber

BOB CLEAR

removes all active Bobs from the screen, and redraws the background 
graphics. It is used with BOB DRAW (see below).

  Bob Clear


=BOB COL

detects COLlisions between the Blitter OBject whose identification number
you specify in brackets, with another BOB. If a collision happens, -1 will 
be returned, if not 0 will be given.

BOB DRAW

is used after a BOB CLEAR command, which removes all active Bobs from the
logical screen. BOB DRAW then lists all Bobs that have moved since the
previous update, saves the background beneath the new screen coordinates
and then redraws all active Bobs at their new positions on the logical 
screen.


BOB OFF

removes a numbered Blitter OBject from the screen, or removes all Bobs if 
you leave out the individual number.

  Bob Off bobnumber

BOB UPDATE
BOB UPDATE OFF
