SOME TACTICS:

BATTLE:

When attacking a Smaller town with a nice size army, use passive posture
allowing for less people to be killed, then change your agression to
AGRESSIVE when the battle is won and choose recruit on the town, less men
killed more men to join your army!

When Attacking keep the CLOSE UP Map located on your leader, then if any 
enemy men are approaching without one of your soldiers to intervene then
choose camp quickly and move away from the town, wait until your health
bar is full again and resume attack!

Once you capture a town close to a dense forest or High Mountain Area,
make an allaince with the remaining enemy forces, then INVENT catepults,
CANNONS, SWORDS, etc. Then once you have Superior firepower built
pick it up then attack your weakest allianced enemy!
To speed up production change the game speed for a while to GREATEST!

If you succesfully build an IRON CLAD Ship called (LITE or HEAVY IRONSIDE)
Approach a town close to the edge of the sea, then attack, the ship will
bombard the town with cannon shots (MAKE SURE AND BRING CANNONS WITH YOU)

When you have gained soldiers and still have an excess of equipment held
by your captain, drop all the equipment and pick it back up, this will
better equip your soldiers, and you will again pick up the excess goods!

RECRUITING:

When recruiting remember all soldiers want to be feed, so the more food
you have the more soldiers will join and stay while attacking!

FOOD SUPPLY:

Any Lamb you see out Side of a City Limit, Attack it and this is a Great
Source Of Food!

At the beginning of the game GET FOOD from your home tower to give you a 
better start!
