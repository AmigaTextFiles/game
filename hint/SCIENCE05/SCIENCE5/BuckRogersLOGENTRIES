Why use Lharc on single document files when a single document file is
normally powerpacked if it is kept? POWERPACK all single document files
then lharc them if there are a series of them! Anyone who keeps large

With all this effort, did you honestly believe

giant acid frog to slob down and try to
sneak into the base. The Frog King makes a
loud noise of objection and barges forward.

  "The Frog King fearss nothing," translates
the Lowlander atop its head. "Hhe will pro-

Desert Ape Pilots

  You cross the scorching Martian desert to
return to your ship, but find hundreds of
gibbering desert apes where your ship used
to be. They ignore you, jumping up and
down and screeching at the sky. You look
up and see your ship wavering through the
atmosphere. The apes are ecstatic.

  Before you have time to formulate a plan,
the ship angles downward and dives for
the surface of the planet. There's no longer
any doubt that a desert ape is somehow
piloting it.

  Flame trails behind it as it screams towards
the ground. The desert apes shriek and
scatter, and you run for shelter, You watch
in horror as your ship impacts and
explodes. You'll have to find some new
method of transportation if you ever want
to leave Mars.

in the face of great adversity and changes.
Everything humanity has done up to now

2.As there is no need for another cradle or
  back-up aiming mechanism at this time,
  all assembly work is halted.

3.There are recurring delays at the lens 
  manufacturing facility. If these delays
  persist, a black mark may appear on your
  work records and on the achievement
  log for this base. I expect all personnel to
  volunteer for duty at the Venus Lens
  Facility. A shuttle will be departing soon.

RAM Venus Duty Memo

  "NOTICE: To Technikis volunteering for
  Venus duty
  FROM: Management, Gradivus Mons

  All Technikis bound for the Venusian Lens
Facility are to be alerted that the situation
there has worsened. Unless the lens
receives final treatment and is shipped
soon, the Project deadline will be delayed.
If the Project misses its planetary alignment
target date we will all be demoted.

  We urge you to do your utmost for the suc-
cess of the Project and the profitability of
the Company."

(The information listed underneath this bul-
letin includes flight coordinates to the
Venusian Lowlands. The date indicates that
the support shuttle left Mars two days ago.)

Lens Treatise

  You scan through a long treatise on bio-
optics citing `energy retention rates' and     
`wavelength amplification' figures for a       
material first developed on the Venusian       
Aerostate St. Croix. RAM scientists have       
developed a method for shaping lenses out      
of this material which absorb energy. The      
power builds within the material until it      
reaches a `flash point' and expels in one      
focused, incredibly potent blast. The trea-    
tise concludes that if acceptable results are  
achieved on Mars, a larger lens situated       
much closer to the energy source could be
greatly more efficient.

mation we've gathered so far, I'm prepared      
to speculate about the effects of a full-sized 
lens used by RAM control.                      
                                               
  "One full-size lens near the sun could pro-    
duce an energy bolt with enough power to       
reach Earth and sterilize a hole continent.    
The deep shelters beneath the cities will be
of limited effectiveness."

RAM Retinal Scan Memo  
                        
 "NOTICE: To all Blue Code Technikis           
  FROM:  Project Security

  We have implemented top-level security
measures. Primary security is provided by
Blue Passcards. Top-level security is provid-
ed by a sealed system utilizing retinal scans.
The retinal imprints of Blue Code agents
have been loaded into the scanner com,         
and it has been sealed against tampering or
outside communications.

  When supplying additional personnel to
the Project, do not send any who are
not Blue Code as of this date. Because a
retinal `lockpick' could defeat the top-level
security, all such devices have been sent to    
the Venusian Facility for immediate
destruction."

Desert Runner Departure

  "I will travel no further with you. I tell you  
truly that I cannot find it in my heart to care
about your land, which is so far away from       
us and our struggle. We have been made
with the love of this pure land next to our     
hearts, and so great is it that little else can
intrude. Yet I wish for you silent stalking
and true shooting, for you have been a
friend to us, and we have stood together
against our common enemy. Farewell."

Test Room Description

  The walls here are lined with specialized
test equipment. Above the walls, the pyra-
mid's glass peak soars high overhead. In
the middle of the floor is a gaping hole, the
shaft by which the RAM test weapon is low-
ered for modifications on the various lev-
els. It rests right now at floor level, sus-
pended just above the shaft hole on a
freefloating magnetic-levitation platform.
The aiming mechanism cradles a huge
pitch black lens.

  There are RAM technicians swarming over
the weapon platform and manning the
consoles. Evidently some sort of test is
about to begin.

Ability Scores. These numbers define the 
basic character, The seven attributes are:
Strength (STR), Dexterity (DEX),
Constitution (CON), Intelligence (lNT),
