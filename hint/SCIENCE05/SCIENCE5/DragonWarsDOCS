                                 INTRODUCTION 
                                 ~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
 
Orbiting the star Sirius, millions of miles away from any other 
intelligent life, a tiny ball of hot water is home to amazing adventure.  
Sirius is three times the mass of our own star, and sixty times brighter; 
its huge bloated mass spans the entire horizon of the humid world of Oceana. 

Oceana is a world 85% of water and getting wetter, as the baleful fury of 
Sirius erodes her diminutive polar ice caps year by year.  Oceana is a 
world burning the candle at both ends, enjoying twice the light in half the 
time, and spinning all the faster toward annihilation and the Void.  
Her surface is dotted with ten thousand islands.  Some are home to thriving 
civilization, while others are all that remain of greater achievements 
long since sunk beneath the waves.  Oceana is a violent world of 
capricious storms, where natural geographic barriers and hostile sea life 
hold people and empires apart.  In no time of her history has Oceana known 
unified rule. 
 
Of all the islands of Oceana, the most fabled by far is Dilmun, "The Land 
Where The Sun Sets".  Located on a score of nautical charts, each time in 
a different place, Dilmun is always just over the horizon.  It is the 
home to all that is best of Oceana - the home of her eldest empire; the 
seat of her finest culture; the lair of her most terrible beasts.  It is 
an isle of dragons and a destination of pilgrims.  Beneath Nisir, "The 
Mountain of Salvation", is the secret heart of Magan, the Underworld. 
 
 
As your adventure begins, you find yourself aboard an armored pilgrim's 
barge, nosing through the still waters of a silent fjord, nearing the 
moment you will drop the plank on an isle you believe to be Dilmun.  
Perhaps you are a pilgrim in search of peach and enlightenment, or an 
adventurer on the trail of fabled treasure, or a weary mercenary seeking 
retirement and eternal slumber in vaults held high above the waves.  Hopes 
are high as the incredibly ancient architecture of this isle's lone port 
swims into view.  Rapture is just off the bow. 
 
As it turns out, Purgatory is just off the bow...rapture may or may not 
lay beyond the walls of the port city.  No sooner does the pilgrim's 
barge enter the harbor than she is boarded by city officials, who 
quickly put all crew and passengers under arrest.  Stripped of all 
possessions and wealth, one pilgrim in every ten is separated from the 
pack for sacrifice to the Dragons.  Your party is among the fortunate 
remainder dropped naked and defenseless into the slums of Purgatory, 
there to fare as you will.  The armored barge is confiscated and made a 
part of Dilmun's rapidly growing navy - a navy that will one day sally 
out across the seas of Oceana, at long last bringing her beneath the heel 
of a single ruler: Namtar, the Beast From The Pit. 
 
Back to basics in one of the most dangerous neighborhoods anywhere, you 
know only you've been had.  A well-intentioned traveller, you've been 
treated like a beast by Namtar, and consigned to a life of perpetual 
poverty in Purgatory. No one escapes Purgatory alive, and few know the 
luxury to die in bed within her walls.  Starting hip-deep in mud, you 
must use every trick just to stay alive, much less worry about sticking 
it to The Beast From The Pit. 
 
 
 
                                 OBJECTIVE  
                                 ~~~~~~~~~  
 
You and your party are adventurers in the magical land of Dilmun, an 
island of salvation perverted into a world of horror by Namtar.  You 
begin the game armed only with your wits in the savage streets of 
Purgatory.  You must find a way to survive in Oceana's most dangerous 
slum, locate a way out of the same, and accept the impossible task of 
toppling Namtar.  Vengeance must be yours! 
 
Examine your reference card to determine how your mundane computer 
becomes a portal to the mystic world of Oceana.  The card will show you 
both how to boot up your game and what keys to press to execute game 
commands and summon various menus.  Once the game is up and running, 
you'll find a party waiting to begin the adventure in the middle of the 
stinking city of Purgatory.  We'd tell you to watch your purse - but you 
don't have one!  Nor do you have a belt from which to hang a purse, or 
pants from which to hang a belt, or...you get the idea. 
 
 
                                  THE PARTY 
                                  ~~~~~~~~~ 
 
A party can have up to four characters, plus up to three non-player 
characters.  Non-player characters are summoned creatures or heroic 
individuals you may meet in your travels.  Everyone else is one of your 
own people. 
 
The game provides a beginning batch of characters for your use should 
you wish to jump directly into the adventure.  All characters are able-
bodied and have no brain damage - use them, or create your own.  If 
you'd like to create your own characters, read the "Creating Characters" 
section. 
 
It may also be possible to transfer characters from other computer 
games into DRAGON WARS - check the reference card for details.  Be 
warned that such translation is inexact...characters arriving in this 
game from other "worlds" will find none of their magic objects and few 
of their spells make the journey with them. 
 
 
                             CREATING CHARACTERS 
                             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
 
When the game fires up, you'll see the names of the default characters 
displayed on the screen.  If you want ot create your own characters, 
you'll have to delete those already present to make room.  Type the 
number of the character you want to delete and follow the screen 
prompts - when you open a space in the party, the computer will offer 
you the chance to create a new character. 
 
There's also an option to rename the default characters, which allows 
you to personalize your party without having to create a whole new batch 
of heroes. 
 
The process of character creation requires you to spend points to custom-
design your character.  You are provided fifty character points to spend 
on attributes and skills.  Characters begin with a default value of ten 
in all attributes, and have no skills.  By following the prompts, you 
can page through the character creation menus to modify attributes and 
purchase skills. 
 
Character creation is an art, and you'll have to experiment if you want 
to arrive at the "perfect" design (if such a thing exists).  To get you 
started in the right direction, consider the following design guidelines. 
 
o  No one character can do it all...nor should they.  While everyone will 
   benefit from weapon and magic skills, it helps if your characters 
   specialize. It's better to have a character who is very good at something 
   and useless in other fields than to have one who can do a little bit of 
   everything. 
 
o  This is a game of slow character growth.  Don't expect your characters to 
   change very much, even if they earn vast amounts of experience. 
 
o  When buying skills for beginning characters, it is rarely wise to purchase 
   more than one level.  Situations requiring skill levels of two or higher 
   are rare in the game, and you'll know them when you find them. If you find 
   an instance where your skills are insufficient, you can always pursue 
   another path, then return later when you've improved the relevant skill 
   through experience. 
 
o  Finally, be aware that a character must master Low Magic before any other 
   variety of magic can be learned. 
 
 
                              CHARACTER PROFILE 
                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
 
See your reference card on how to view a character's profile.  After a 
character is called up, you can perform a variety of functions, such as 
viewing statistics and managing your inventory of gold and items.  As 
with character creation, just follow the prompts.  A few minutes of hands-
on experimenting will show you everything you need to know about the 
character profile. 
 
Characters are represented by a series of words and numbers, the 
significance of which are illuminated below: 
 
STRENGTH (STR):  The most immediate effect of great strength is the 
ability to cause additional damage to foes.  Strength is also useful 
for breaking things, lifting heavy objects, and opening stubborn pop bottles.  
High strength is required to use certain weapons; strength in excess of 
what a weapon requires provides additional damage.  Inquiring at a weapons 
shop will sometimes tell you the strength required to user certain weapons. 
 
DEXTERITY (DEX):  A high dexterity makes you light on your feet, improves 
your chance of hitting the bad guys, and diminishes the chance of getting 
nailed yourself.  Dexterity also determines the order in which a character 
acts in combat, starting with the highest dexterity and moving down to 
the lowest.  Consider designing some magic-users with low dexterity, so 
they can cast healing spells at the end of a combat round. 
 
INTELLIGENCE (INT):  Ultimately, your characters are only as intelligent 
as are you.  This statistic measures a character's abstract intelligence; 
it is important for learning spells and solving puzzles.  Intelligence 
also affects your chance of successfully hitting an opponent with a spell. 
 
SPIRIT (SPR):  On Oceana, the mundane realm is just one part of life.  
Spirit reflects the strength of a person's soul, and is important for 
casting spells and resisting evil spirits.  Spirit also determines the 
number of power points retained by magic-users. 
 
POWER (POW):  Power is derived from spirit, and represents spell points 
used for energizing magic spells.  Once spent on a spell, power points 
do not naturally regenerate...you will need to use a Dragonstone or 
find some other means of regenerating Power.  For this reason, power 
points should be used with discretion.  Power is twice your Spirit. 
 
HEALTH:  Health is terrifically important for when health is reduced to 
zero, the character dies.  Health can be restored only by certain spells, 
retaining the services of a healer, or through use of the Bandage skill.  
Death is usually permanent on Oceana, but legend holds that somewhere in 
the depths of the Magan Underworld can be found the Well of Souls, within 
which resurrection is possible. 
 
STUN:  Stun is derived from health, and represents the ability to resist 
damage before a character falls unconscious at a stun value of zero.  
Characters generally run out of stun before they run out of health.  Stun 
fully regenerates following every melee - you'll find yourself taking a 
lot of stun damage in the game, but it isn't really serious unless the 
whole party gets stunned all at once. 
 
SEX:  Male, female, sometimes, or never. 
 
EXPERIENCE:  Experience points are an abstract measure of a character's 
activity.  The more things a character does - the more monsters he slays, 
the more secrets he discovers - the more experience points will be earned.  
Experience points translate into levels. 
 
LEVEL:  Levels are gained automatically as a character earns experience 
points.  The computer will let you know when a character attains a new 
level.  Initially your characters will rapidly gain levels, but after 
the fourth or fifth level you'll notice character growth is considerable 
slowed.  This is because it requires progressively greater and greater 
amounts of experience to reach the higher levels.  When your character 
reaches a new level, he receives two new character points that can either 
be saved or spent on skills and attributes. 
 
ARMOR CLASS (AC):  This rating indicates the quality of your armor.  The 
more (and better) armor you wear, the more damage it can absorb before it 
starts counting against your health and stun.  Armor does not make it 
harder for opponents to hit you.  It does increase your life expectancy 
by taking damage that would otherwise be taken by your skull, ribs, etc.  
Remember, armor does not contribute to your DV - it may actually reduce 
AV.  But your AC will rise if you wear armor, and it will help you survive. 
 
ATTACK VALUE (AV) & DEFENSE VALUE (DV):  These factors are based on your 
dexterity value divided by four, and are the basic statistics influencing 
combat.  You'll want these numbers to be as high as possible, as they 
determine how often you will hit your enemies with weapons and spells, and 
how often you will be hit by the same.  Some items increase or decrease 
AV and/or DV.  Weapons usually improve AV, while armor actually decreases 
your combat values - armour will encumber you and may impair your 
performance slightly. 
 
Your AV is different for magical combat and weapon combat, depending on 
your magical skills and weapon skills.  These skills do improve your AV 
but the improvement is not shown on the AV gauge.  For example, Raggletok 
has a Dexterity of 16 and a crossbow skill of 1, and no other weapon skills.  
His base AV is 4; that's his Dexterity divided by four.  When using a mace 
in combat, Raggletok's AV is 4, since he has no weapon skills to increase 
his combat proficiency.  However, when using a crossbow, his AV is 5 
because of the influence of the crossbow skill.  Remember, whichever 
skills he may be using at the time, Dragon Wars will display only his 
base AV without skill modifications - modifications for actual weapons 
or armor will be reflected. 
 
 
                                   SKILLS 
                                   ~~~~~~ 
 
Skills reflect a character's areas of expertise.  Correct selection and 
use of skills is the key to completing the DRAGON WARS adventure. 
 
Skills are defined by  type and level.  In most cases a skill need not 
exceed level one to be useful, but to complete the game certain skills 
will have to be higher.  For instance, a single level of skill is 
perfectly adequate for most of the LORE skills.  Eventually attaining 
tow or three levels of skill in LOCKPICK, BANDAGE, CLIMB, and the weapons 
and magic skills is recommended.  Skills always begin at level one, but 
can be initially purchased at higher levels, or improved during play by 
the accumulation of experience points. 
 
It isn't necessary for every character to have every skill.  You can divide 
the labor to your advantage if you decide to have one LOCKPICK specialist, 
for example, a couple of characters with BANDAGE skill, and a CLIMBer.  
As long as you work as a team, specialization will help you survive. 
 
 
                             SKILL DESCRIPTIONS 
                             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
 
BANDAGE:  A very important skill, as healing services are scarce in Dilmun.  
With greater skill, more health can be restored to an injured character. 
 
CAVE LORE:  Many of Dilmun's dangerous and exciting places are found 
underground, and having this skill may yield important information at 
appropriate moments. 
 
CLIMB:  Use this skill to climb over rocks, up into trees, and down to 
certain doom.  Some obstacles require high levels of skill to overcome. 
 
FOREST LORE:  Dilmun is largely a wild place, and this skill yields 
knowledge of how to operate in a wooded environment.  This skill is 
important to the Druids, who inhabit the forest lands of Dilmun's 
wilderness. 
 
HIDING:  If you can't kill something, and you can't outrun it, your 
only hope is to hide.  Note that once you're in combat, it's too late. 
 
TRACKER:  While your characters' mundane eating and sleeping concerns 
are invisibly maintained by the game, you might find it useful to hunt 
every now and then.  Using this skill allows you to track various 
creatures, be they men or beasts. 
 
LOCKPICK:  Valuable objects are usually locked within chests or behind 
doors. Seeing as how Namtar robbed you of all your worldly goods, you'll 
doubtless want to engage in a little first hand social reform by robbing 
from the rich (everyone else) to give to the poor (yourself).  Knowing 
how to pick a lock is important to resolving your quest. 
 
MAGIC SKILLS:  The skills of LOW MAGIC, HIGH MAGIC, DRUID MAGIC, & SWORD 
MAGIC are required to learn spells of a specific type.  Furthermore, you 
must have the LOW MAGIC skill before you can learn any of the others.  
High levels of magic skill are useful, as they determine the maximum 
number of power points you can invest when casting a spell - the higher 
your applicable magic skill level, the greater the potential of your spells.  
A higher level of magic skill also increases the chance your spells will 
accurately hit their targets. 
 
MOUNTAIN LORE:  Fabulous treasures and fearsome beasts reside in Oceana's 
mountainous climbs.  Knowledge of the world's high mountain places might 
save your life. 
 
FISTFIGHTING:  Adds to your ability to hit when using fists. 
 
ARCANE LORE:  Dilmun is a magical place, and it's important to know about the 
world's magic, mysticism, and gods.  A well-rounded sorcerer will combine 
magical might with arcane lore. 
 
BUREAUCRACY:  To liberate Dilmun from Namtar's foul grip, you will need 
to sway hearts and minds.  To this end, skill in public speaking is 
important, as represented by the BUREAUCRACY skill.  You might also have 
success using this skill on stubborn guards and petty officials. 
 
SWIM:  While it is generally not possible to swim between the islands of 
Dilmun, this skill will help you should you find yourself unexpectedly 
underwater.  A character who can't swim could find himself in deep water. 
 
TOWN LORE:  You will visit many of the towns of Dilmun in the course of 
your adventures - this skill will provide you with local legends and 
history. 
 
PICKPOCKET:  Times are hard in Dilmun, but there may still be a few 
unwary folk that you can practice this age-old skill on. 
 
WEAPON SKILLS:  You need not have the relevant skill to use a weapon, but 
doing so will improve your performance with the weapon in question.  Each 
level of weapon skill adds 1 to your AV when you use that type of weapon.  
Note that the effects of weapon skills are not shown on the display of your 
AV, but rest assured the additional effects of your weapons skills are 
invisibly maintained by the computer. 
 
For example, if Muskels the Barbarian has a 20 Dexterity, he'll have a 
base AV of 5.  Armed with a flail and a Flail skill of 1, his AV with 
the flail will be 6, but Dragon Wars will only display his AV as 5, 
because the effects of weapon skills are not shown on the display. 
 
When creating characters, there are several ways to get your AV up.  You 
can either have a high Dexterity, which will increase both your AV and 
DV, or you can choose to add to your weapon skills, which will increase 
only your AV at a cheaper cost.  Adding to weapon skills also restricts 
you to a certain weapon if you want the additional AV. 
 
 
                                  SKILL USE 
                                  ~~~~~~~~~ 
 
In some cases, merely knowing a skill will be enough to benefit from it.  
This is sometimes the case with the Lore skills, which yield useful bits 
of knowledge at the appropriate time if a sufficient level of Lore 
knowledge is present.  If on of your characters suddenly notes an odd 
detail and you didn't select the USE command, then a Lore skill has 
kicked in. 
 
Other skills will require that you actually use them to be effective.  
If you're confronted by a puzzle or obstacle which you think can be 
solved by skill use, select the skill you want (see the reference card) 
and follow the prompts.  You can use items and attributes using the same 
prompts.  If you fail, but are still convinced you've used the proper 
skill, you probably need a higher proficiency level in the skill in 
question - come back and try again after you've learned a thing or two. 
 
                                    MAGIC 
                                    ~~~~~ 
 
Namtar, the Beast From the Pit, is the mightiest sorcerer of Dilmun.  
Smart boy that he is, Namtar has manipulated King Drake of Kingshome 
into declaring a general ban on magic, thus giving Namtar a monopoly 
on this world's true power.  The City States of Dilmun, none too closely 
allied to begin with, did not take kindly to this decree, and open warfare
resulted.  Spellcasting legions were chewed  up in the opening weeks of 
the war, while conventional forces continue the struggle to this day.  
Namtar's Stosstrupen, a sort of magical secret police, eliminated most 
of Dilmun's top individual sorcerers before an effective resistance could 
be organized. 
 
Namtar has all but won the war, and the formal practice of magic has 
been outlawed in Dilmun.  Rumors persist that magic is still taught 
in secret out-of-the-way places, and it is one of your tasks to recover 
the world's lost magical knowledge. 
 
Learning a spell always entails using magic scrolls.  After a scroll 
is used, it vanishes forever, although the character reading the scroll 
will remember the spell for the rest of his life.  Using scrolls is 
easy - finding them is the difficult part, but no one said the life of 
a hero was simple. 
 
There are four branches of magic in DRAGON WARS.  All wizards must begin 
with Low Magic.  There is no established school of Low Magic; teaching 
chores are handled by assorted bush wizards and holy men.  Because 
teaching of Low Magic is so widespread - and because Low Magic is 
relatively mundane - Namtar has done little to shut it down.  There's 
actually a functioning Low Magic shop in Purgatory. 
 
The acknowledged master of High Magic was Lanac'toor, a dangerously 
unstable being formerly in residence in the City of the Yellow Mud Toad.  
Lanac'toor was the Strosstrupen's first target - he was ambushed while 
torpid following an excessive feast of lampreys.  Lanac'toor's body was 
first turned to stone and then smashed to pieces.  With Lanac'toor's 
demise, the practice of high magic all but vanished from Dilmun, but 
rumors persist lanac'toor himself had a teacher, and that the teacher 
resides somewhere in the Eastern Isles. 
 
Oddly, Sun magic remains public and legal.  The Master of Sun magic is 
Mystalvision, a great public hero in residence at the Temple of the Sun 
in Phoebus.  Sun Magic has gained popularity in recent years as the great 
star Sirius gradually drowns the planet by melting the polar icecaps.  Sun 
magic combat spells are the most potent in the game. 
 
Druid Magic is the way of the elements and the beasts, and is the purest 
of all magic, although not nearly so powerful as high magic.  The most 
skillful druid is Zaton the Displaced, of which the current whereabouts 
are unknown.  The Druid Magic cult has been driven underground by namtar's 
persecution, but worship of the cult's patron deity, the beast-man Enkidu, 
continues at the various Druid shrines. 
 
There is one further "class" of magic in Dragon Wars: that which is 
called "Miscellaneous Magic."  These three spells are usable by anyone 
who has skill in any of the four standard classes of magic. 
 
When you cast a spell, the computer always deducts a certain number of 
Power points from the caster.  In some cases, you'll be prompted to 
indicate the number of points you want to invest in a spell.  In such 
cases, the extra points will increase the duration of the spell or its 
damage or effectiveness.  The number of points you can invest in these 
spells is limited to twice your current skill level in that area of magic. 
 
The following few pages contain descriptions of all the world's known 
spells.  Although many spells are well-documented through centuries of 
use, some descriptions are incomplete because of the spells experimental 
or foreign nature.  And, perhaps, because some spellcasters have placed 
themselves in great peril by playing with forces they do not know... 
Because of this, you will have to experiment with spell use to learn 
the best application of magic in each situation.  In fact, creative use 
of spells may be a vital element necessary to solve the game.

A note on spell icons:  The computer shows you that certain spells (most 
notably the light spells) are active by displaying an appropriate icon 
on the screen.  When the icon vanishes, the spell has run out of juice 
and is no longer active.  In the case of light spells, this usually 
results in the sudden onset of darkness.  For the detect spells, it 
means you're no longer likely to detect danger at a distance. 
 
Monster Summoning: A word is warranted on the subject of conjuring up 
creatures from other locales or dimensions for use in combat.  Several 
High Magic and Druid Magic incantations bring forth creatures of this 
sort to do your bidding.  All of these spells have some things in common: 
you must have an open character slot in your party to accommodate the 
summoned creature.  You should also be aware that summoned creatures do 
not last forever, and will eventually return to the magic worlds from 
which they appeared, leaving a lifeless husk behind.  The more Power 
points you invest in summoning a creature, the longer you can expect 
it to stick around.  Finally, the lengthy and precise summoning spells 
cannot be cast in combat.  Although summoned creatures come complete 
with their own armor and weaponry, you may be able to equip them with 
any items you choose. 
 
 
 
                                   COMBAT 
                                   ~~~~~~ 
 
Unless you're willing to roll over and die, you're going to have to fight.  
Fortunately, you have lots of options during combat, and if you exhibit 
the proper mix of prudence and courage you should emerge victorious more 
often than not. 
 
You'll know a fight is brewing when a picture of some nasty being appears 
on the screen.  The computer will tell you what you've encountered, and 
set the range at which the encounter begins.  You'll have to close to 
within ten feet of the enemy before you can enter hand to hand combat, 
but spells and missile weapons can be used at varying ranges. 
 
When facing a battle you can always run away, but it's more fun to fight.  
The game offers you two types of combat: Quick Fight, and Fight. 
 
Quick Fighting gives you more limited combat options to speed encounters 
along. 
 
If you choose Fight, instead of Quick Fight, you have a few more options.  
First off, you'll have the option of striking a normal blow (just like the 
quick fight option), a mighty blow (reduced chance of hitting, but improves 
damage done to the target), or a disarm blow (try to knock your opponent's 
weapon away without doing much damage).  You also have a chance to 
rearrange your party, which is important if one or more characters have 
been incapacitated or killed - only the first four characters in the 
party order can actually fight in hand-to-hand combat.  Finally, you 
can attempt to block, which improves your DV against the attack of a 
single foe. 
 
In either type of combat, you always have the option to use an item, 
run (shame on you!), dodge, or cast a spell.  Dodging is similar to 
blocking, but it works against all enemies in the combat and is less 
effective. 
 
Note that if you run from an encounter, the computer will actually run 
you across the map you are on for several moves...if you return to the 
scene of your defeat, don't be surprised if you run into the same enemies 
again.  Just because you turned tail doesn't mean the bad guys are going 
to pack it in! 
 
 
 
                               GETTING AROUND 
                               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
 
The computer simulates the perspective view available to your characters.  
Think of the computer as a window to the world of DRAGON WARS.  Check 
your reference card for specifics on how to navigate around the world. 
 
If you lose track of where you are, or start to develop a dangerous case 
of tunnel vision, try using the automap feature.  (See your reference card 
for how to invoke automap.)  You'll call up a top-down vies of your 
character's present position, showing exactly where you are in relation 
to the local terrain.  Black areas on the map represent areas you haven't 
explored yet - you must actually move through a square with your party 
to fill it in on the automap.  Black areas that you cannot reach may 
indicate secret adventure areas worthy of  further investigation.  Then 
again, they may be solid rock. 
 
Speaking of secret stuff, you'll find plenty of it in the game.  Secret 
doors are indistinguishable from normal walls...until you walk through them.  
Clever use of the automap may reveal where secret doors "should" be.  
You'll know a locked door when you bump into it - try battering the 
door down with strength, or maybe use your lockpick skill.  The game 
also features exotic and rare one-way doors, teleporters, spinners, 
and...well, find out for yourself. 
 
 
 
                            PARAGRAPHS EXPLAINED 
                            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
 
Frequently you will be instructed by the computer to read a certain 
numbered paragraph.  The paragraphs are printed in the paragraph text 
section of this manual, and supplement the briefer on-line text present 
in the program.  Paragraphs frequently elaborate on the information 
provided by the computer, but are an important source of clues and 
are not to be overlooked. 
 
You'll greatly increase your enjoyment of the game by only reading those 
paragraphs to which you are specifically referred by the game.  "Reading 
ahead" could spoil some of the surprises that await you in DRAGON WARS.  
Don't try to read the paragraphs consecutively, as they are printed out 
of order and will prove confusing. 
 
Ultimately, you put down your hard earned cash for this game, and you can 
of course do what you damn well please with the paragraphs.  However, 
should you use the paragraphs as a free "cheat book", beware the wrath 
of Namtar...and be advised certain paragraphs are pure ya-ya that will 
do nothing to improve your performance in the game.  In fact, acting on 
ill-gotten information could prove hazardous to your health.  You have 
been warned. 
 
 
                                    ITEMS 
                                    ~~~~~ 
 
Almost as important as your attributes, spells, and skills are the items 
you will discover during your quest.  An item is anything you can pick up.  
A very few items are worthless, but everything else you find, buy or steal 
in DRAGON WARS could be important to completing the game. 
 
Simple items are things like weapons (used to do mayhem to the bad guys) 
and armor (used to prevent the bad guys from doing the same to you).  
Magic armor and weapons can also be found in Dilmun - and there are no
cursed magic items.  Certain weapons could actually decrease your AV, but 
this means they're harder to use, not that they are imbued with evil magic.  
As Muskels the Barbarian said of his Crush Mace, "Yeah, it was harder to 
swing, but boy did it crack skulls!" 
 
The use of many items may not be immediately obvious.  Sometimes you will 
need to discover secret knowledge or clues to determine what to do with 
an item.  Other times an item may be useful only in some part of the world 
you have not discovered.  Keep track of the items your party carries, and 
try to use them in novel ways.  The secret to item use is to consider all 
the things an item can do...if you find a key, it is probably used to open 
a lock.  If you haven't yet found a lock, remember you have a key, and
keep your eyes open for locked doors or chests as you explore.  No 
character can carry more than twelve items. 
 
IMPORTANT:  If you "discard" an item, it is gone forever...and along with 
it may go your only hope of solving the game, so manage your items 
carefully. 
 
The various stores in Dilmun can only keep certain mundane, plentiful 
items in stock; there is high demand for the unusual.  If you find unique 
items during your adventure and sell them to a store, they will be sold 
to other adventurers, and you cannot buy them back. 
 
To use an item, follow your reference card's instructions on the "Use" 
command, and follow the menus.  Select the item you want to use and give 
it a try.  The worst that will happen is you'll look silly, and most of 
the time no one is looking anyway.  Actually, that's not exactly true.  
Some magic items have limited uses.  Once you've shot up an items's 
charges it usually cannot be recharged, so a certain amount of resource 
management should be applied to item use. 
 
 
 
                                A FINAL NOTE 
                                ~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
 
DRAGON WARS is as much a story as a game.  To complete your quest you 
must pay careful attention to your environment, and realize you are in 
the middle of a fully-developed fantasy world.  Very little happens in 
this game without a reason.  Take note of details, consider what 
motivates your enemy, and keep your eyes open.  Finally, don't be 
afraid to take control of your own life.  You are the hero of this 
saga, and without you there is no adventure. 
 
Good luck. 


                      HOLIDAY GUIDE TO OCEANA AND DILMUN,
                          THE LAND WHERE THE SUN SETS
                          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"Dilmun" is the name used to refer to the group of islands where the
Dragon Wars adventure is set. Collectively, Dilmun is viewed by the residents
of the planet of Oceana as a place of salvation and retirement. Under 
Namtar's fould rule, this formerly fair land has been twisted into a place of
ruin and death. In better times, the Navigational Guild compiled this map of
Dilmun for the benefit of Pilgrims.

Well, there is a map here and I do not like to do ansi shit. I will try to
do some of it but forgive my crudeness at it since I did this whole fucking
thing for you!

Legend: the symbol  is used to indicate the location of a city
        The areas inside the "lines" are islands and those out of the
        lines are meant to be the seas/oceans/whatever.
