<OL>

<LI> Move alot! The enemies will not be able to hit you if you run around the
stage like a lunatic :) Hold down the shiftkey (=run) as much as possible.
It is important tha you master the "strafe" technique! Preferably use the
"real" strafekeys, ie "." and "/". You could also use the "force-strafe"
technique ("right Amiga"), but then you will have to keep up the
fingerwork! Anyway, the important this is for you to take the corners,
without loosing the view forward, to always be prepared if an enemy should
turn up and ruin you day. It is possible if you use the "strafe" keys in
the right way: eg, to take a 90° corner to the left in a small corridor.
When turning press "left arrow" and "/" at the same time, and you will
slide around the corner like never before! And the front-view was clear all
the time! Remebmer: practice makes perfect; don't give up!<P>

<LI> Configure the control so that it fits you perfectly! I for example don't
like jumping with "0", so I use "/" instead, since I think you get much
better control in the air that way! Furthermore I use "Del" and "Help" to
look up or down! It is very personally how one likes the controls.
Experiment! The reward is perfect control over the game, and maximum
playability! <P>


<LI> If the ammo or energy should run out: play a couple of stages behind you again, or 
start from scratch again! Du will notice that you have gained experince,
and you will have fun when with ease playing stages you before thought of
as impossible; the result is more ammo and health! <P>

<LI> You have to learn every stage by heart, where the enemies are hiding
and how many they are. One tip is to start every new stage with running and
fooling around as far as possible (ie until you die) the first times, to
get a picture of the stage before taking on the task of completing it. Mae
sure you know were the "big and bad" enemies are, so that you don't get
surpriced and loose control over the situation. <P>

<LI> Use the map! Let the map be your eyes when you cannot see whats
infront of you. The map can also reveal secret rooms (ie walls that can be
opened)! If you can't find a way of opening such a room, it's probably not
a bonusroom, but a room filled with horrible enemies that will open when
you least expect it!!! (never forget such a room!) <P>

<LI> If you thinkteh game is to hard on you, you can play the 2meg version!
Ok, it might not be quite as good looking as the 4meg, but it's easier;
First of all the cool lightning effects dissapear and the floors turn into
one colour and everything gets lighter. All this makes it easier to see
what's in front of you! The best thing though, is that the gray and teh
green robots gets exchanged with only one type of robot; the blue (and
easy) robots are all that is left! This will make the game alot easier! The
red robots with the assualt rifles are still there though :( If you still
can't complete a stage, then download AB3DII-Ed
from Aminet. With this you can edit your saved
games, and for example give yourself 10000(!) in health. <P>

<LI> Secure the areas you have been to. You have to make sure 100% that
there are no enemies left behind! There is nothing worse than a red rodent
from behind when trying to fight a priest! Avoid fighting against many
enemies at once in a big open space. The best thing is to fight one enemy
in a small area where you are in full charge over the situation! <P>

<LI> The enemies can't shoot you though walls! It may sound obvious, but it
gives us the best technique when slaughering aliens; araound corners! Use
your strafe-knowledges and take a peek around teh corner, shoot and then
back again! Make sure you are using the correct weapon, and be prepared to
back if the alien should come to close! Use the same technique with doors
that are automaticly closed! Often when you get hit by an enemy bullet, you 
are turned around a random number of degrees. It is important to quickly
beeing able to straighten up and continue fighting in such a situation.!
<P>

<LI> The degree of difficulty seems infinite at the beginning, and is
increasing (hmmm... bigger than infinity :) until stage 8, to lower quite a
bit, and then increase again until stage 15, where it is <I>really</I>
difficult. When playing stage 15 you think that stage 3, wich is very hard
the first time, is a piece of meat! <P>

<LI> When opening a door *or in any other way entering an unknown
territory) you should back out of it right away. Many aliens seem to hear
you and are standing there waiting for you! Back out quickly and be ready
to squeeze the trigger! If you come out of a teleporter you can, when
entering it, turn so that you come out of it in the best possible angle!
<P>

<LI> The jetpack can take you to places never seen before. Experiment and
use the map to eg find bonus rooms ! When flying you may look up or down to
get a better view. <P>

<LI> For maximum effect play the game a dark autumn-night with the wind
blowing outside your window, in a completely black room. Turn down the
brightness on your 28 inch tv and turn up the volume. Enjoy!!! You will
loose the grip on the keyboard every time you bump in to an enemy! Oooky
Spoooky... <P>

<FONT COLOR="#c80000"><CENTER><I><H1>Weapons, hehe:</H1></I></CENTER></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#c80000"><H3>Shotgun:</H3></FONT>
<UL>
A very good weapon. Make sure you always have ammo for the shotgun, since
it's needed everywhere in the game. Use the fact that the bullets hit their
targets immediatly, and that the weapon aims automatically. Good
"acute-weapon", ie have it ready when you don't know what's in front of
you.
</UL>

<FONT COLOR="#c80000"><H3>Plasma/Tripple Plasma:</H3></FONT>
<UL>
Quite slow, but very powerful! Most efficiant in close up situations; it
mashes your opponent fast! Use the tripple plasma in emergencies, when
hords of enemies are attacking. This too is a weapon you should always have
ammunition for.
</UL>

<FONT COLOR="#c80000"><H3>Grenades:</H3></FONT>
<UL>
Together with the rocket launcher this is the most powerful weapon. Try to
gather many aliens at one place then launch a grenade towards them for
maximum destruction :D Beware of the explosion; it will hurt you. If you
look up or down you can controll the grenades flight in a better way. Eg
look up and the grenade will fly further away.
</UL>

<FONT COLOR="#c80000"><H3>Assault rifle:</H3></FONT>
<UL>
Like the shotgun, only much faster. The best place to use the assault rifle
is in small and narrow corridors where enemies rush towards yo.
</UL>

<FONT COLOR="#c80000"><H3>Blaster:</H3></FONT>
<UL>
Weak and slow weapon. Fits best when you can hit the baddies and they
cannot hit you. Since you often have a lot of ammo for this gun it is
recommended to use it when you need to save your other ammo, or as a long
distance weapon when it's hard to get a clean hit!
</UL>

<FONT COLOR="#c80000"><H3>Rocket launcher:</H3></FONT>
<UL>
Powerful and fast! Goes in a straight line until it hits a wall or an
enemy. Use it one the big and bad enemies. Be careful so that you not
launch a round straight into the wall in front of you in a stessy situation :o
</UL>

<FONT COLOR="#c80000"><H3>Laser/Mega Laser:</H3></FONT>
<UL>
Mmmmm, you enjoy using this weapon. It kills most things in its way, and it
does it <I>quickly</I>. Play Eraser and use the mega laser; nothing
survives! Unless the ammo runs out... save up and only use in emergencies!
The laser bounces on walls, which makes it a "tactics-weapon", with which
you can perform funny things. Observe: Mega laser is very fast, but not the
standard laser. This really makes them two different weapons that are to be
used differently!
</UL>

<FONT COLOR="#c80000"><H3>Mines:</H3></FONT>
<UL>
A powerful explosive with a delay. Best tactics: Run in front of a door
with hords of enemies behind that is automatically opened when you pass,
and put a mine there. Hopefully you will kill every single baddie when they
run out the door chasing you! Beware of the explosion!
</UL>


<CENTER><IMG SRC="images/tkg_bar.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="TKG_BAR" WIDTH="493" HEIGHT="39"></CENTER>


<FONT COLOR="c80000"><CENTER><I><H1>Enemies:</H1></I></CENTER></FONT>


<FONT COLOR="#c80000"><H3>Arnie the alien:</H3></FONT>
<UL>
Cute little rodent... or? Arnies favourite occupation is to gnaw and to
howl! Give him a mine to gnaw and he will stop howling... hehe. Seriusly,
Arnie howls when he sees you. If you can hear him, but not see him, turn
around quickly! Shoot him at long distances with the shotgun (one shot) or
with the assault rifle (two shots)! Don't let him come near you. Sometimes
he is impossible to hit when he is gnawing your leg...
</UL>

<FONT COLOR="#c80000"><H3>Triclaws:</H3></FONT>
<UL>
This modest little creature can be a real pain in the ass. Use the shotgun to
blow him away. But even though hotgun aims pretty goot, he can be really
hard to hit. If he comes to close to you he will eat up your energy
quickly... he <I>has</I> got three mouths :) Beware of leaving one of
these behind you... eventually he will find you!
</UL>


<FONT COLOR="#c80000"><H3>Blue robot:</H3></FONT>
<UL>
There is not much to say about the blue aliens. Use as weak weapon as
possible (eg the blaster), to save up ammunition. Two shots from the shotun
is enough to kill the sucker. Use the strafe-technique to avoid his shots.
</UL>


<FONT COLOR="#c80000"><H3>Gray robot:</H3></FONT>
<UL>
These have shotguns and are very dangerous, as they can hurt you the moment
they see you! Kill them <I>fast</I>. Use a powerful weapon if needed.
</UL>


<FONT COLOR="#c80000"><H3>Green robot:</H3></FONT>
<UL>
not as dangerous as the gray, but quick! They shoot plasma-shots, and many
at a time! Use eg the shotgun at a far distance, and avoid their shots by
strafing sideways, or by using a corner.
</UL>


<FONT COLOR="#c80000"><H3>Red robot with headlights:</H3></FONT>
<UL>
Shit! Not good... One of these can kill even the most skilled player! If
you see the corridor in front of you beeing lit up (not in the 2meg verion)
I suggest you <I>RUN</I>. The robots havee automatic weapons that will hit
you at once. And they shoot alot too! If you use the strafe-technique
around a corner togehter with a weak weapon, it is almost impossible to
avoid beeing hit! A wellthrown grenade, or maby a bazookashot, and you will
come home for dinner alive! If you stand in front of them, or try to strafe
in front of them, you will be a red spot on the floor in a matter of
seconds!
</UL>


<FONT COLOR="#c80000"><H3>Blue Insect:</H3></FONT>
<UL>
Like the blue aliens, only faster and they shoot more! At a very close
distance they can be really annoying, so make sure you shoot them before
the reach you! If you blow them full of lead they may some times have
difficulties shoting back at you!
</UL>


<FONT COLOR="#c80000"><H3>Yellow insect:</H3></FONT>
<UL>
Woops, you will wet you pants the first time you get blown away by one of
these. They shoot very quick, and their shots take a great deal of your
energy, as well as they spin you around 5¼ turns :) Therefore you will have
to shoot them before they can manage to throw a couple of rounds at you.
Best put to death using a well aimed bazookashot!
</UL>


<FONT COLOR="#c80000"><H3>Red insect:</H3></FONT>
<UL>
Shoot plasmavballs, and lots of em' if he sees you! Can only be found on
two stages - D & O (I suppose thats a goot thong!).
</UL>


<FONT COLOR="#c80000"><H3>"Floating ball of jelly with arms":</H3></FONT>
<UL>
This one shoots plasmaballs at you, and you shound do the same thing
against it. They will quickly float towards you, so be prepared for a
closeup fight with lot of strafing. Watch out when you can't see the one
you where just chasing... he might be just above you!
</UL>


<FONT COLOR="#c80000"><H3>Killer Bees:</H3></FONT>
<UL>
Can take a great deal of damage! And they are quick too. Try to throw
grenades towards them (look a bit up) and get a rythm. Plasma does also
work. If you get the right rythm, the bee cannot shoot back. If not it will
shot cascades of plasmaball towards you that may be hard to avoid (although
strafing works mostly).
</UL>


<FONT COLOR="#c80000"><H3>Inca-priest:</H3></FONT>
<UL>
Dangerous fellows... They can shoot directly at you with no visible bullet;
 and the shot takes a temendous amont on your life! Best way to avoid the
shots is to stand in a narrow corridor, with the priest outside in an open
area. He may then have difficutlies aiming at you; he will hit the wall
instead. If he sees you he will shoot directly! Take him out with the
rocket launcher, or with grenades if possible. Best though, is to avoid him
completely and take another way ( although this is not possible most od the
times :~( ).
</UL>


<FONT COLOR="#c80000"><H3>Spiders:</H3></FONT>
<UL>
Like the yellow insects, but more agressive and shoots cascades of the powerful
shots at you! There are only three of them in the entire game, but thats
enough for me :) The first one is quite simple to take out, bu the next two
are a bit more difficult! My technique was: run, pull 20 mines (ie all I
had at the time) out of your pocket and put them on the ground after you,
run, bazooka a little here and a little there, waste all of you laser... in
short: find out new things to do until they are dead (or more likely:
<I>you</I> are dead :).
</UL>


<FONT COLOR="#c80000"><H3>The boss:</H3></FONT>
<UL>
Not Springsteen, but the grean mean bastard in the end of the game :) He
will throw hords of bazookashots at you in he sees you! Read more about him
on the last stage.
</UL>



<CENTER><IMG SRC="images/tkg_bar.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="TKG_BAR" WIDTH="493" HEIGHT="39"></CENTER>

<FONT COLOR="c80000"><CENTER><I><H1>The stages:</H1></I></CENTER></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#c80000"><H3>Level A:</H3></FONT>
<UL>
This level shouldn't be <I>too</I> hard to manage. A good practice stage
before the real stages. If you can't complete this one you should go back
to Tetris, level one ;)
</UL>

<FONT COLOR="#c80000"><H3>Level B:</H3></FONT>
<UL>
Now the degree of difficulty increases strikingly! I have heard of many not making 
it beyond this stage. You must first take cover somewhere. Run to the left
at once, after killing the first robots. You should come to a room in which
you will find a robot and a rodent. Kill them (what else :) and wait for
the enemies/carefully go back to clean out the corridor. The next problem
is the red robot. He cannot go very far, so if you are a bit lucky you can
quickly strafe infront of him and then back out again to the "entrance"
where he cannot see you. If you stand infront of him he will splatter you,
so don't do so! You might want to use the map to orientate on this stage.
Remember that aliens like attacking from behind on stages designed like
this one; be on you guard!
</UL>

<FONT COLOR="#c80000"><H3>Level C:</H3></FONT>
<UL>
Beware of the green jellyblobz that lure behind the door! Open it and run
like hell. They will probably come after you, so back of and shoot when
they are approaching. Strafe to avoid their plasmaballs. From the blue room
insects are pouring out! I think that it's best to stand in the corridor
before the room and blast every so of a bitch that comes out of it. When
noone else is coming you just walk into the room until yoou see some more,
and run back to your hideout! Then we have the priest left... You better
avoid him completely; Stand in the corridor, so he can't shoot you. When
you see him walking around the pedestal (he will stop attacking you!), wait
a bit and then follow him. He can't see you - thus not shoot you - if you
keep to the opposite side of the pedestal. When you are at the back of it,
jump up and grab the key and <B>RUN</B> towards the exit! Observe: Don't
forget that there is a hidden door, and behind it loads of goddies. It is
to the right of the little staircare inside the "maze".
</UL>

<FONT COLOR="#c80000"><H3>Level D:</H3></FONT>
<UL>
The best teqnique is to try to gather every alien in a lump beneath your
ledge and give then a grenade to chew on :D It is almost impossible to
<I>not</I> getting hit by the fire from the robots. When Mr. Red appears
you may either stay upon the ledge, and try to shoot him when he pops up
infront of you (it takes time; watch out for him bullets - he shoots quite
a few), or run into the room and directly left (watch out for the
teleports), where a door has opened. Grab the rocket launcher and blow him
into small red slimy alienparts, hehe =:)
</UL>

<FONT COLOR="#c80000"><H3>Level E:</H3></FONT>
<UL>
Good, You made it here! Now things get harder. First of all, don't wait for the red 
robots. Instead quickly jump over the ravine. Get rid of all the trash and
grab the first key. Now go stand next to the door that is furthest away
from the starting point, with the yellow insects behind. Open the door and
step aside. Be ready with the bazooka; fire if you should see an enemy. You
don't have any time to think, so don't stand still too long, or you'll be
barbeque! Don't waste your ammo, especially not on one of the triclaws, which 
are also in the room. Repeat the "sidestepping" procedure until all the
three insects are dead. You'll now get the next key. In the next room you
will find a door that is automatically opened when you pass infront of it.
Behind are loads of enemies that pour out of it (I bet you'll find it :).
you should run infront of this door and place a mine outside. With any luck
you'll kill all of the enemies in one big blam! After this shoot the yellow
insects with the bazooka, and locate the switch. Just beside this is a
secret room filled with goddies! Pull the switch and seek cover in the
secret room. From here you can fairly simple kill the two priests with
grenades!
</UL>


<FONT COLOR="#c80000"><H3>Level F:</H3></FONT>
<UL>
After the first teleporter run to the "room". Stay here and try to kill the
enemies; they will come to you! When finished go to the next teleporter,
but continue straight on, and then up the wall using the jetpack, and
you'll find a nice place... In the labyrinth you should use the assault
rifle. Learn to orientate and use the map. There are two red ones that may
cause trouble, and an extra one in one of the rooms! 
</UL>


<FONT COLOR="#c80000"><H3>Level G:</H3></FONT>
<UL>
When you've shot the first robot his buddies come to the rescue, and
they're <I>red</I> of anger... Make sure you quickly run to the
ventilator-systems (duck to get through), don't care about the buddies. Go
and shoot the generators, but don't get down in the lava - you won't get up
again! You can then relatively easy kill alot of aliens from the tunnels.
In the "last" room, shoot the green jelly things before you open their
doors when pulling the switch! the last key is located on a ledge in the
room closest to the switch; fly up there!
</UL>


<FONT COLOR="#c80000"><H3>Level H:</H3></FONT>
<UL>
Look out in to the freedom for one nanasecons, and then avait the enemies.
Kill them all from the "startroom". The bees has alot of stamina; use the
grenades and try to paralyse them! If you are very short of ammo, you
could start the stage with <I>running</I> out and gathering as much as
possible from the middle of the yard, and then return home to the "base".
There is alot to pick up on the stage; search carefully!
</UL>


<FONT COLOR="#c80000"><H3>Level I:</H3></FONT>
<UL>
Now thing get a bit easier! Start off with walking straight forward as much
as possible; there are no enemies in the first part of the stage. There are
alot of rodents here, so use the shotgun of assault rifle and make sure to
kill every sucker before advancing! Don't just walk in to a big room.
Instead stand at a distance and try to blow the enemies to hell, also, let
<I>them</I> come to <I>you</I>! Carefully search for small, and maby hidden
paths; there are quite a few of them. Eg at the end of the stage, where you
are about to jump over some walls, you can pull down a BIG wall, and in
that way avoiding confrontation with some real bad guys! This is a stage
where yo ushould try to avoid as much as possible!
</UL>


<FONT COLOR="#c80000"><H3>Level J:</H3></FONT>
<UL>
Take out the red robots with a grenade or the bazooka, otherwise you may
get in trouble. When you take the green key, a door very close by opens and
a red one gets out. Put a mine in front of the door before you quickly take
the key! In the "elevatorroom", kill the insect with a basookashot, aim
carefully. In the same place there is a "jelly", that seems to be stuck
behind an elevator. Either you will have to wait him out, which may take a
while, or just ignore him! With a little luck he won't see you! In the
second part of the stage the plasma gun is prefered. Don't forget the
hidden room with the medipac. Not to forget too is the water, that's a
sight you won't see everyday!
</UL>


<FONT COLOR="#c80000"><H3>Level K:</H3></FONT>
<UL>
This is one of the hardest levels in the game! The stage is <I>too</I>
symetrical, and thus it's very hard finding your way around it! Draw a map
with all the rooms, keys and the way of doing everything, or have a look at
mine below! Be careful, as soon as you take a key, new doors open and
enemies ooze out. :( Be extra careful when you teleport somewere... The
green key in the oval in the middle can be tricky the first time; run arond
the big square in the middle once and the key will appear! The three
priests you kill with alot of bazooka shots. You should stay and await the
enemies in most rooms after taking a key. You will loose a lot of energy on
this stage, but don't give up; you <I>can</I> complete it with a bit of
practice, and some luck on top of it!Just make sure you always know where
all the bad guys are<BR>
</UL>

<FONT COLOR="#c80000"><H3>Level L:</H3></FONT>
<UL>
This is a battlearena! Start with collecting the ammunition and medipacs
(ofcourse), and then go and try to shoots as many slimy aliens as possible
from your legde. Beware of bullets from far far away. When you think you've
mashed enough enemies, jump down and run around shooting everything that's
moving. Now go for the tough bit :) Place yourself on one of the platforms
that are right next to the big one in the middle. You should now be halfway
up compared to the one in the middle. Up there are two red robots and one
spider(!). They can hardly ever see you where you stand right now! Quickly
jump up into the slime. If you think you see an enemy right in front of
you, fire a bazooka and something towards it! With any luck you'll hit the
sucker. Time for a quick retreat! Stay down until the shots fired at you
have all passed, and then repeat the procedure again until all three are
dead. Never stay in the slime! You'll get badly hurt either by the enemies,
or by the slime! The exit is in a tunnel in the middle of the slime. It
will not open until all enemies are dead.
</UL>


<FONT COLOR="#c80000"><H3>Level M:</H3></FONT>
<UL>
You can avoid large part of this stage by doing it in this way: Star with
going into the slime, straigh ahead to the right (yes, I know, it stinks!
=:). Here are two important things; a teleporter and a key. the key might
be hard to find; when walking around, look up for a tunnel into the wall 
above you. When you've got the green key, teleport back and go into one of
the tunnels right after the slime. You'll get a yellow key. Now head back
to the start position and go straigh ahead to the left. Here are two doors
with yellow insects behind, that opens by pressure sensitive buttons in the
floor. If you sneek right next to the left wall all the time you can avoid
opening these doors! Take the red key, and walk back to the room before the
slime. Here is the "exclamation mark" key to the right. Now you can open
the door that is straigh to the right from the start position. Beware of
the priest! Never bother going to the left from the start, there are only
trouble in there. By The Way: Charge up the jetpack before you exit the
level; you'll need it soon!
</UL>


<FONT COLOR="#c80000"><H3>Level N:</H3></FONT>
<UL>
Pretty tough stage, but there is a way of cheeting: if you have a fully
charged jetpack you can avoid big parts of the stage! In the "silo" you
shall fly up to the to ledges. Ohterwise you would have had to activate the
elevator in the silo, and that requires more rooms to visit. With a little
training I don't think this stage should cause any trouble. You should do
the stage this way (in order to "cheat"): Start with cleaning out the
enemies that are rushing from the tunnel infront of you. The go down into
the silo. Kill the baddies and teleport up again. Now fly to the higher
ledge of the two in the silo. Take everything. Go down into the silo again
and take everything here aswell. Now fly up to the lower of the ledges, and
once again grab all that you see. Now go straight ahead from the start, 
detroy the communication-centre, and wander on the next level!
</UL>

<FONT COLOR="#c80000"><H3>Level O:</H3></FONT>
<UL>
A very hard stage! Just like in the first Alien Breed 3D, stage 15 is
almost impossible to conquer. But just "almost". You can do it if you put
you heart into it! There are four directions to choose from from the
starting point:
<OL><BR>
<LI><I>"Two Spiders"</I><P>
No tactics here, just run and waste all of your
power-weapons. You will loose <I>alot</I> of energy here, and most often
die. Thats why you should take this one first!<BR>&nbsp;
<LI><I>"Two killer bees"</I><P>
The bees are a bit tricky. Run around alot like a lonantic until they are
both down at your level, otherwise they will hurt you alot. Try to
cocentrate on one at a time, and paralyse him. With one dead there should
not be to much fuzz about destroying the other one.<BR>&nbsp;
<LI><I>"Two killer insects"</I><P>
In this room you'll bump in to two red insects, like the one at stage four.
This means that they are really quick and they shoot <I>alot</I>. Run to
the left or right and in to a teleporter. You'll appear at the teleporter
on the other side. Stay and wait until you see an insect, fire a couple
bullets and then quick into the teleporter again, otherwise you'll get
hurt. Repeat this until the two are blown away. Go down into the slime and
destroy the communication-centre to get out of the unplesant
place!<BR>&nbsp;
<LI><I>"Lotsa rodents"</I><P>This is the easy one of the four. To get to the
ending you will have to choose the right teleporter, otherwise you'll
teleport to the beginning again :( This is the right way:<BR>&nbsp;

Not to hard when you know how...<P>&nbsp;
You should do the stage in this order. After every part you'll recieve a
key in the middle of the stage! After four keys you are ready for the final
stage!

This stage is "square circular" :) Keep to the outer limits. Try to get our
green friends attention, and make him follow you round, round... Walk
<I>backwards</I>, and always be "one length" infront of him. If you do the
right thing, you will always be at a corner and you will see him coming
round the corner "over there" . He wil fire at you, and yo uat him. Use the
bazooka and fire one or two times. Back around your corner and run to the
next one. Await him and repeat it all over again, until he is spacegarbage!
Then you kill the four priest that like tho hang around in the middle of
the stage. Use every signle piece or heavy weaponry you've got, after all,
these are the last enemies you are to eliminate! When they are gone, walk
into the newly opened door. <B>CONRATULATIONS</B> You have just  finished
one of the hardes and enoyable games ever made for your beloved Amiga! Now,
just lean back and enjoy the final words (I you can't keep up the reading,
don't worry, the text will loop when finished!).
