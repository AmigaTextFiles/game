@node Intro "Introduction to the Foundation Hints guide."

 What is Foundation
 ------------------

Foundation is a strategy game based in a fantasy world full of magic and war. You
control a race of people brought together from different times in history. The aim -
to be victorious over your enemies by taking over the land.

The gameplay of Foundation could be described as a cross between The Settlers,
Warcraft and Megalomania - containing the best elements of each to make a truely
magnificant game. 


 What is the purpose if this guide?
 ----------------------------------

The main purpose of this guide is to collaborate all the available information on
Foundation into a compact, readable document. Information is primarily from the
@{"Foundation Mailing list" link mailinglist}. The author of Foundation, Paul Burkey, has also
contributed a lot to the guide.

The guide will be updated and released after a suitable accumulation of information.

@node buff "Technical info on the game"

 Techinical info section (Correct from V1.7)
 -------------------------------------------

@{b}Maximum number of buildings in any game@{ub}: 250
@{b}Maximum number of people in any game@{ub}: 1400

This section contains detail on various aspects of the game FOUNDATION.

@{b}Reproduction: @{ub}Reproduction occurs in any building that contains
Maidens and `Male Units'. The ratio of female births against male births
depends on the number of females (Maidens) in storage.

For example:

 1 female  left:  1:0 female/male ratio
 2 females left:  1:1 female/male ratio
 3 females left:  1:2 female/male ratio
 ...
 20 females left: 1:19 female/male ratio

The birthrate is twice as high in the peasant huts compared to the HQ.
The birthrate is higher if there are more males in a building (up to about 10).
Maidens can give birth at any age.
Maidens will only give birth if both their morale and energy is above 40%.
After a birth, the father and mother of the child will loose 10% energy and
gain 10% morale and the new born will take the fathers surname.
The new born will have the same energy/morale levels as the mother at the
time of birth.

The fact that both mother and father loose 10% energy for each new born means
approx 1 unit of food is needed to recover that energy loss. This means a
population growth of 50 will require 50 items of food to keep ballance and
general food usage will rise by approx 15 items of food per year.

@{b}Life Span@{ub}: If kept healthy, people live to around 60-75 years. If
they are unhealthy, they will probably not live to 60 years. And if morale
is low, it is likely that they will start committing suicide. Health problems
are more serious above the age of 50.

@{b}Food@{ub}: Food increases the amount of energy a person has. Each person eats the
same amount of food, and looses about 5% energy each year. Once the energy level of a
person drops below 80%, they will look for food to eat. The choice of food is
random, and is made from the menu of a particular building. If the chosen food is
not there, the person will go without food for another year and morale will suffer.
This means that a building with only half the food items available will force the
occupeants to go without food quite often. So it is best to try and keep all food
items in stock in a building, although it is not neccesary to provide all food items
all of the time.

@{b}The power of Food@{ub}: Most types of food will give a person 20% of a extra
energy. Eating food will also raise morale by 5%. In some buildings the power of
food is different:-

  Hospital = 40% energy, 10% morale
  Tavern   = 15% energy, 25% morale
  Church   = 20% energy, 20% morale

If a person drinks Wine you can add an extra 10% to the morale figures above and
subtract 10% from the energy figures above so for example drinking Wine in the
Church will give a person 10% energy and 30% morale. Drinking Wine in a regular
building eg, Headquarters will give a person 10% Health and 15% morale.

@{b}Travelling Speeds@{ub}:

Peasants/Maidens/Wizards generaly walk at speed 2
Guards and Knights walk at speed 3
Black Knights walk at speed 4

The percentage of energy and morale will affect these speeds but as an
example, the Black Knight will walk twice as fast as a Peasant.

@{b}Relative strengths@{ub}: All people in Foundation have 'Attack Powers' and
'Shield Powers'. If you divide the Attack Power of the 'attacker' by the
Shield Power of the 'victim' you can work out approximate damage levels. Here
is a chart showing the Attack and Shield powers.

               Attack ¦ Shield
               -------¦-------
  Maidens         -   ¦   1
  Scientist       -   ¦   1
  Peasant         4   ¦   1
  Wizard          -   ¦   2
  Guard          10   ¦   2
  Knight         14   ¦   2.5
  Black Knight   18   ¦   3

  (extra attack points are added for extra experience levels of soldiers but
  the values are lowered as energy and morale are lowered.)

  Now for a few examples of typical attacks.

  Peasant attacks Guard;   4  / 2  = 2  hit points.
  Guard attacks Peasant;   10 / 1  = 10 hit points.
  Knight attacks Peasant;  14 / 1  = 14 hit points.

  The above figures would 'even out' a little when morale and energy levels
  are brought into the calculation but generaly a Peasant has about 30%
  of the attack power of a Guard and a Black Knight should kill a Peasants
  in less than 5 hits.

If you're running the AGA version then avoid using a menu screen
bigger than 640x256 an avoid using a game screen bigger than 320x256.
Once you get that running you can experiment with bigger screens. If
you still have problems then send me details of the screen modes you're
using, the available chip ram before running the game, any important
settings you have chosen eg, AHI on/off and also a SnoopDOS report
will always help m to locate the possition where the suspend error
occurs.

I currently run Foundation in RTG mode with a 030/25 pending the arrival of
my 060. Its quite playable. In fact back in the days when I had a 040/25 on
my A1200 and doing Foundation beta testing it was really cool.

The current version is slower in RTG mode because it makes OS calls to do
this. However I think Paul has plans to do direct calls which will make it
a lot faster than AGA. Correct me if I'm wrong Paul! :)

It's not too bad at all really ..

I have 040/25 and I'm using HiRes 720x283 resolution. It's  playable as long
as there's not a huge number of people on the screen. Sometimes I have to
smaller the main-view, though.

lowres 320x256 will be okay. I never run it on any other size screen
myself despite the fact I have a more powerfull system. I prefer the
game to be smooth rather than just nice to look at.

@node GENstrat1 ""
Hello,

I noticed someone on the list requesting some general hints for Paul's
masterpiece of a game ;-).. Anyway, here's some general things I've
made up on my way to mission 28....


General Mission-types:

Fast/smart (0->2 years)
(Most rescue missions)

Fast strike (4->8 years)
(A few rescue, prisson-breaks, 'destroy-enemy-something', the later can/
must sometimes be played 'long')

Long and tough (+40 years)
(Destroy one/all enemy)..

----

Fast/smart strategy:
(Only rescue-missions, I think the first prisson can be done with this)
Find a safe path and guide your people that way, normaly it includes
finding no-man-land or walking along borders.. (Usualy takes a couple
of attempts before it works..)

Fast Strike:
Build 2 or 3 barracks, trade iron/wood/stone/ore/coal/oil for gold and
armour and make all your pessants into soldiers, then go for the target.
On later rescues you'll need to take a few strategic buildings to get
your people home. On later prison-breaks you MUST make a secure path
to the prison as you need almost all the men safe home.. (This type
takes a first attempt where you only send your knights out to locate
the target(s), then restart and build the army..)

Long:
Start by building a farm, a pessant-hut and some water-supply. The next
step is to find what you can produce easy. If you are near water, you
can make some water-pumps and trade water for what you need, if you're
near mountains build mines.. Try and produce as many things as possible
yourselve, it's however often a waste to build 'masons' and 'forresters','
as they 'run out', rather use your men and resources on mines, water and
food that last forever, then trade for wood..
Always have spare men in your HQ to do transports, 2 or 3 is enough at
all times, be sure to construct pessant-huts as you go on, a base ready
for battle should have at least 5 pessant-huts with plenty supplys..
Don't build warehouses unless you REALY need them, due to bugs in the
game they usualy gives more trouble than good..
If you have more than one mine, then have only ONE producing oil for
your labs, don't produce oil if you don't have any labs.. Same for
farms, only produce grain if you have baker or brewery..
Build a lab early on and make sure it's filled with scientists, you'll
need the 'tourch' command to make a good battle..
Barracks can usualy wait until year 20, the soldiers you have from the
start is enough to guard until that time..
Don't put guards in houses build 'away' from the enemy, they'll serve
much better in the HQ if you get attacked..
If you choose to build an armoury early in the game, you should only
put 2 people at work there, more will use you your iron-supply. When
you build barracks you don't need to have 5 people in them from the
start, 2 is enough until you begin preparations for battle..

Don't start battle until you know how to tourch the enemy, then set
off with a good bunch of soldiers and 3->7 pessants, have the soldiers
distract the enemy and send in your pessants and burn everything. It's
importaint to burn down barracks, refinery, armoury and farms (yes !!)
belonging to the enemy, it might also be good to burn the water-supply.
When you tourch, then remember to keep tourching a building until it's
destroyed, simply done by: Everytime a pessant has tourched a building
and he leaves it, quickly select him and ask him to do it again, now he
will walk into the building (the guards won't attack him) and wait until
a wizard appears and puts out the fire, then he'll tourch again, keep
doing it as long as the building stands (Don't worry, the pessant won't
die when the building drops..)..
When the 'primary-supply' of the enemy is knocked down, go on and burn
the rest of his houses. When that's done (enjoy the pessant-huts, sounds
so funny..) send the pessants and soldiers home to relax a bit, wait 1
or 2 years and make the attack on the enemy HQ.. Repeat for all enemy if
needed... ;-)

Hope this helped someone ;-)

@node MISCtips1 ""

 Tips for improving your gameplay
 --------------------------------

Tip #1: Try and keep your people INSIDE a building. If they are outide, they
will lose health because they have no food to eat.

Tip #2: Try to keep your population level UNDER CONTROL. A population of around
200-250 will most likely be the most efficient level for most circumstances. If
you have too many peasants, you will need more food, and more water, and more
peasants to get the food and water..... So keep the population DOWN and you will
find you can comfortable supply everyone with what they need.

Tip #3: Do not overuse the speed-time functions. You can do productive almost
all of the time. Speeding up time while you are doing 'housework' enables the
enemies to become stronger, faster. Be wary of this feature.

Tip #4: If you are runing short of peasants, check your wood levels. If you have
enough wood to get by, reduce the number of WORKERS in the forestors hut to one or
two. This will reduce the number of forestors required and you will end up with
extra peasants to send elsewhere
@endnode

@endnode

@node MAIDUSE1 ""
Here's another tip about maidens - when you are getting ready to attack an
enemy building, send 6 or 7 maidens in first to draw the guards away.  Then
when the guards come out, send the maidens away from the building and the
guards will follow them.  Your soldiers and peasents now have an easier time
to attack the building.
@endnode

@node MAIDENS1 ""
  Maidens can produce offspring in ANY building as long as they have food,
water, and a mate. ;)  They do it faster in peasant huts, but by keeping
some in other buildings you assure that those buildings get replacement
workers even if there are no 'spares' in the castle and also you increase
the moral of the workers in that building so they stay healthier and don't
want to kill themselves.  Happy workers are good workers as long as they
are also healthy and well fed.  That's all maidens do but these functions
are totally critical to your society.  Keep maidens in every building if
you can, but especially in your most important buildings.  Put maidens
where the men are in other words.  Your men will thank you by living and
working better and your tribe will increase faster.  Just make sure
everybody has food and water, and preferably all the foods they like.
@endnode

@node STARTNOUT ""
> I NEED a good starting formula. I worked out settlers. But, with
> Foundation, it seems very hard to get resources!!

To start Most  levels, I build a Water Tower, then a Farm, and put Wheat
production to Nil in the Farm.  This seems to give the required start.

Then Build a Peasant Hut.

If you have enough resources left, build a Refinery, to convert ore/coal to
gold/steel.

Still got 15 Men spare ? Now build a Forresters Hut

THEN WAIT.

Keep an eye on your food/water stocks, if either start to drop, build another
Farm or Water Tower.

If the number of Maidens exceeds 14, send the excess off to explore the land.
If they get killed, the lower numbers will allow more food/water to your
remaining people.

Wait untill you have 18 Men spare, build another Peasant Hut ..

Fixed it:))

It was a patch called NewWPA8 i had in User-startup, i had forgotten
it was installed.  I've also found it was making Doom and some other
things behave in a nasty way too.

Got Foundation running in 640x480 and i like it:))

I have just completed this level, Obviously you know where the prison is
now. What I did was to ignore the needs of the people (in a fashion) in
stead of steadily building up I instantly built Barracks and turned all the
current male population and recruited all people possible from buildings
already started to the army. Once I had a large army, march to the enemy
camp take the prison first then attack the enemy head quarters, the enemy is
destroyed remove prisoners and walk back to own camp. That's what i did and
it seemed to work.

The only problem with completing this level is the next one, (Dual Battle)
Im getting seriously nadged as I cant stop the enemy peasants knicking all
my stuff. Anyway another week beckons on this level, hopefully you will be
on it soon to give me advise.

Well, ok it is possible to do this; I can build Barracks, convert all my
men into Knights and send all my people (about 60) to the enemy to disturb
things enough to get my prisoners home safely. My question is now more
like: Is there a more, well if not realistic than at least "less cynic"
way to solve this ?

No, there's not really a fixed time limit. But as you have seen, prisoners
a) won't live forever and b) weren't necessarily captured as babies. :) In
other words: Rescue them ASAP! Extincting an opponent is generally nice,
but if the briefing reads "Rescue x people", then grab your army and run!

Although it can help if you take over buildings that are in your way (hint,
hint).

It's probably just a distance problem. All calculations for the
Gun Tower are based on distance so the water would make no
difference. If the enemy is too far away the tower won't shoot.

They may die of a loss of food or they could die of old age depending
on just how long you take. In one of the recent updates I made a small
change to the game which alows the "special rescue" people to survive
without food. This isn't very realistic but it avoids all the rush for
rescuing people, especially when they are located in a remote hut on
a small island with no food supply. 12 people with 3 items of food don't
last many years :)

Don't build too many buildings in the beginning. First get your population
growing steadily; get your peasant huts full and make sure they get enough
food and water. I'm sure someone who is better than me in this game can give
some more tips (I'm only up to mission 5 ;-) ).

I use this strategy to kill off peasants stealing with me:

- First I wait. Usually, the peasants use always the same route. So I
sit and wait and when I know where they come from, I put a building with
a knight (works, but not so good) or a tower (small or large doesn't
really matter). The only important thing to take care of are these:
Put the building/tower at some distance of your warehouse/HQ. Otherwise,
the knights don't have enough time to kill the intruders before they
reach the HQ and begin to steal.

- Raise the agressiveness (klick on the knight on the building and
raise the 40% to 90%). This way, knights leave the building when
some enemy walks by instead of sitting and watching.

- Be sure to have some knights on the warehouse/HQ itself. Then, they
come out or kill the thieves when they enter the WH/HQ.

- Sometimes, it happens that a knight is just not able to kill the
intruder. This is dangerous because of two things: First, the intruder
can loot and second, sometimes, the knight will follow the intruder
into enemy land and being killed there. To avoid this, you have
two options: Always check what your knights do or if you see that
a knight can't cope with an intruder (he runs into them for several
times but can't hit them), select a building with a better knight
(eg. a black knight), call him out, select him and then right-click
the intruder. The better knights walk faster and kill better :-)

Build a GunTower close to the enemy boarder, then build more foreward ..

You're probably building too quickly - this often happens with peasant huts
- and the people are all stuck inside the buildings waiting for food/whatever.

Try reducing the number of people in each building as low as you can so you
can get some transportation back. This is not always easy, and when you get
to the stage where your people are dying, you're probably in trouble :) You
may have to restart this - it depends how bad the situation is.

How many people do you have? How many buildings? For early missions, you
don't need many buildings at all, just a decent supply of knights. Don't be
tempted to build loads of everything to increase production, because it's
so easy to overstretch yourself. And don't think that you have to be
producing everything in any real quantities - as long as you've got food
and materials, you're okay. These are all the mistakes I made :)

Be creative!

Don't try to burn it, invade it.  Then send a wizard along with some guards and
get the wizard to cancel the building - you get al lot of resources that way.

Mind you, I didn't come up with that nifty plan until ma few missions later

I had some problems with this level too. I tried to build everything up, to
have all the resources and everything, but I always ended up failing. Then I
found that it really doesn't matter if you build all those buildings. Just
make knights out of all your peasants and then, with 10 or 12 or something,
just go attack the enemy and take one lab a the time. Actually, I had to do
it in two rounds; take one lab first, and then train some more knights and
then take the other one. If you don't have enough resources, just trade some
of which you have for gold or similar.  
@endnode

@node MIS3-6 ""
Alright. Here comes a special for our friend who's stuck in level 3. :)

[Let's see. Level 1... finished, level 2... finished, level 3... finished.]

Ok, the problem seems to be the red opponent. He has a nice amount of
people and goods, he replaces lost labs quickly and builds very dense.
A conservative approach took me 26 years. I conquered the red's lab and had
my wizard tear it down. One enemy lab less and some resources for free.
Then I had to look for the other opponent. First, I conquered the tower,
had my wizard tear it down... and the way was more or less open. Same
procedure for his lab. Meanwhile, our red colleague has two new
laboratories. Grmpf. And now we're running into trouble. This guy's
buildings stand so close to another that you cannot access any of them
without defenders rushing out of the neighbor buildings. If this is your
major obstacle, there is a cure. :) But some general help first.

- In order to get the necessary army ASAP, you need to generate lots of
  offspring. The ideal place is the peasant's hut but one of them won't get
  you too far. Since you normally have more maidens than you'd ever need,
  you should build two peasant's huts and fill them with 6 maidens and 3
  peasants each. (You know that the male:female ratio affects the
  preferred gender of the offspring, don't you?) That ensures that you have
  enough workers as well as a nice reproduction. And it makes the guys in
  the peasant's huts damn happy. ;)

- If you want to approach a building, avoid passing other buildings too
  close. You will have enough to do with the defenders of your target.
  There is no need to attract the attention of third parties.

- The same is true when you are passing enemy #1's territory to get to
  enemy #2. Don't call your troops over long distances. The pathfinding
  routine might take them to a sightseeing trip through an enemy city
  center. (Hi Paul! :) ) Call them to a point on the way, wait until they
  arrive, then proceed to the next waypoint and finally to the target.
  Control is everything.

- Avoid erecting buildings you don't need. It is nice to have four
  laboratories, a brewery, a fishery, sure. But they bind workers you
  need elsewhere. One farm, one water source, that should be enough for
  level 3. Although I had to exchange some spare goods for food from time
  to time.

- If potentially dangerous buildings (barracks, towers) are in your way,
  consider an attack. And to make a counter attack impossible without the
  need of keeping guards and/or knights inside, have a wizard ready, send
  the inheritants back to the HQ and tear it down. No, not the HQ. :) This
  is even more attractive now that we get some resources back when we scrap
  a building.

And here comes the promised secret master plan for level 3:

a) You know where the red enemy resides.
b) Now that your population rises faster than those of your opponents,
   you can have loads of soldiers in a very short time.
c) He doesn't have that many soldiers in early stages of the game.
d) Forget the task! Take some troops and invade the red enemy's HQ!

His lab is lost, he will never build another one, and you can relax and
care about the yelloy enemy. The whole level is possible in less than 20
years. :-O

HTH.

@node LEV6-1 ""
 To complete the mission you only need to rescue a certain amount of
 people, but if you wait to long some of the people in the hut will
 die of old age or missing food and the you can't complete the mission.

 The fastest way to do it is:

 1) Ask all the people of the hut to get out, then select them all as a 
   group..
 2) Have them walk to southwest-corner of your land around the hut, see
   that border-line going north-south ??
 3) Have the people walk on the western side of the border all the way
   down to your main land, then ask them to enter the HQ (By RMB on the
   door) and you're done :-))

 (That worked for me, you might have to walk on the eastern side of the
 border, or even ON the border to avoid attacks. Keep your people walking
 by clicking in front of them, if they reaches your last click they'll
 stop and spread out, most likely crossing the border and alerting the
 enemy..)
+++++
if you send your soldiers up to meet your men then they can protect them.
@endnode

@node MIS3-7 ""
Right, mission 3 is the lab attack, you got two enemies (red and yellow).=
=2E

When you start you're at the remote end if the island..

First ensure growth by building a pessants house, a water source and a
farm. That should provide a supply of men, until you build a baker and/
or a refinery the farm should not use time to make wheat..

Then you must think of resources, find a place with some trees and build
your lumberjacks there. Then find some mountains and build a mine and a
refinery. You'll proberly need some materials to build this so sell the
gold and get wood and stones to build. Finaly you need a science-lab to
get valuable new techs..

Now sit back and wait for some resources, you should at this time remove
all guards from buildings north of your HQ as that place is ony towards
the coast, you'll need to have guards on the enemy side. Use the waiting
time to send a maid out and explore the area around, find your border lin=
e
all across the map and explore. Using a maid for this is an advantage
as you'll need your men to work..

When you've got some resources build an extra mine and consider to make
an extra pessant-hut to increase the number of men..

=46rom now on you should keep an eye on your stock of magic and wizards,
if the number of wizards begin to drop you must build a barracks, but
don't fill all 5 men into it for now (You'll need a barracks to train
wizards and scientists)..

REMEMBER: Don't be affraid to sell things for wood, in the beginning
of a mission you might wanna sell for stone also. Just don't sell
magic, any foods, water and wine

As time passes you should build at least 2 more pesants huts, 2 mines
2 refineries and an armoury.. At some point you might also build an
additional lab. Don't waste time and resources to build forresters,
rather rely on producing gold, iron and ore and exchange it with
wood. Also remeber to build a crematorium when you're about to run
out of magic. Another thing to watch is the food, when you scientist
come up with the fisher and baker you must build them, after the baker
is built you'll usualy need aditional water supply, and when your
population is +100 you should also need an aditional farm.

The armoury should not be filled with all 4 people, they'll use up
your iron and create more weapons than you can ever need.. Set only
one or two people to work there that's more than enough..

When your forresters has taken all the trees in their reach, empty
the hut for people, it's a waste of people to have them sitting
there doing nothing..

Make sure that only one mine uses time to produce oil, one can
easily supply the scientists with what they need..

When you can increase the workers in the mines or farms then do so
for all your buildings..

Also remember that you don't need to guard buildings on the north
side of your area, there's only coast-line above anyway..

If all goes perfect you should begin to get free people when your
population reaches 160 or so, then begin to produce a few soldiers
to replace the ones that has begun to die, don't ask the barracks
to just produce soldiers, control the number to your needs..
(This should normaly take place at around year 34-40..)

Also remember to produce new scientists to replace them in the labs,
but you don't need to have some sitting in your stock. As long as
you have 4 in each of the labs that's fine.. The same goes for
wizards, when you get a bit into the game, it's enough to have 2
or 3, you don't need to rebuild to the original amount..

Build new farms and water supplies when you need them and also
create a brewery to raise the moral a bit..

Now sit back and enjoy the goods roll into your stock, await when
your scientists finds out how to tourch buildings, and when you
have a good surplus of men you make a large production of soldies,
for the first run you should need about 30, then take off with the
30 soldies and a few plain men. Walk into the enemy camps and have
the soldies keeping the defenders busy while the simple men burn
down the labs. Keep producing soldiers at home and send them to
the battle in groups of app. 10 (never alone) to make sure you can
protect the unarmed men you've got. Simply walk through the enemy
lands and burn down what you think might be fun. You only have to
take out the labs to complete, but it's sure fun to burn other
things too..


The first time I played this mission I used time to build a country
with +300 people before going to war, and it took about 100 years,
I've replayed it with the above notes in mind, and I made the attack
when I had app. 170 people and it took less than 50 years to pull
off :-)..

>So i'm now looking for Tips on level 16

This level should really be named "dash of the madman" or something.... :))

Okay,,,, I built a barracks, and an armoury, a farm and a pumphouse!
I trained every peasant to become a soldier! I did as well return the peasants
in the forresters hut and the mason's hut back to the hq. So I had about 50
or so soldiers.....

Then head for the prision.... But don't go straight to it... Wait, and fight
the guards..... you get a hell of a beating and probably lose over the half of
your soldiers..(but that isn't that important). When you feel the time is
right then go for the prision. When you take it then make every prisioner go
outside... then select them all, and make the destination your HQ... if you
have killed most of the yellow soldiers.... then at least 10 of the prisioners
will reach the hq... thus ending the mission :)

@endnode

@node LEV15-1 ""

I'm also working mission 15... some start hints on this mission 
are:

Send out a scout and go north from your HQ, some place up there is
a mountain area, now go east and find the coast-line (which is in
the red area).. Between the mountains and the coast you build a
warehouse, quickly get some soldiers up there to defend it. Also
move most of your men, women and wizards up there. Build your
area around the warehouse to get access to the mountains and the
vital supplys (This is a long-play-war-level)..
- As I think you'd like to work from here, good luck -

BTW: I can tell you that where I stand now I'm in year 76 and 
I've almost completed the war, so it's a long one..

Oh yes, a general hint if you don't know it, always have spare
men in your stock to do transports, else your people won't get
what they need. If you build 3 breeding-huts (Can't remember
the real name) in the beginning, you should ensure a good flow
of men, and by using the materials for the huts you delay some
of your building plans a bit..  It's perfectly possible to
build large populations without fish, meat, wine and bread, you
can run streight on Vegetables, Fruit and Water. But make sure
you got enough of that...

Mission 23 hints:

- Start a new mission and build two or three barracks..
- Empty the buildings you have from the start for men..
- Set the barracks to produce 'full' soldiers..
- Sell iron/wood/stone/ore/coal for gold and armour until you have enough
  to turn all your pessants into soldiers..
- When you have app. 30 soldiers ready you head off, remember to take
  the knights with you, follow the coast along the bay going west and
  then south until you see a red gun-tower..
- Attack and take the guntower to protect the return trip, leave 2 or
  3 soldiers to guard and bring in some extra soldier from your base..
- If ANY guards approach you from other buildings then kill them at
  once, you might only get that one chance..
- Continue south to a red farmhouse, then a bit into the land you'll
  find the HQ. DON'T attack it, but put your soldiers outside and kill
  the guards approaching your men (Direct your people in the battle,
  send at least 4 soldiers on each enemy, more if the enemy is a 
  knight, to reduce your losses. DON'T count on the inteligence of
  your soldiers in battle)..
- (You might wanna call your last soldiers down to the enemy here, I
  didn't need to...)
- While the gurads are kept busy or dying, send some good (healthy)
  soldiers (I used the 6 knights) to the prisson and rescue your people.
- Gather all the people from the prisson with a few soldiers and GUIDE
  them to your HQ (Don't just send them off, but click them home a
  screen at a time) folowing the now secured bay-coast, with a bit of 
  luck you should be able to bring the 20 needed people home..
