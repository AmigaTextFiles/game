THE BIONIC COMMANDO STORY

The time is the future.  It has been ten years since The Admiral brutally
destroyed our defenses and enslaved our people.  The people still resist,
but the enemy is much better armed and has no mercy.

When news of the attack came, a small group of scientists managed to seal
themselves away in a secret underground laboratory set up by our military. 
The enemy has not discovered the lab yet but is getting closer every day.

Working with limited resources, the scientists soon realized that they
needed to design a small but effective weapon.  They decided on bionics. 
They finally designed a pair of specialized bionic arms and tireless bionic
legs.  Unfortunately, they only had enough material for one set.  The
scientist asked for a volunteer from their elite guard to use the equipment
and you were selected.

Now, the surgery has been performed, and you must fight.  One man against
an army. But, if you can just infiltrate the enemy complex and defeat The
Admiral, we will have a chance.  You must use all of your exceptional
skills and advanced bionics to their limits.

Your mission: Simply to save civilization.
