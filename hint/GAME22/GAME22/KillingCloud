   The Killing Cloud - typed by Fryer
   -----------------


   Setting
   -------
    Ok this game takes place sometime in the future (obviously)
, after something has happened and a "Killer Cloud" of poisonous
gas has settled over San Fransisco.  You play a police officer
who is out to stop the ever present crime element...Well thats
about all i can make up...On to the weapons and cool things.


   Weapons & Cool Things
   ---------------------
    There are several weapons that you will use throughout the
game.  All of which play an important role in the game itself.
Listed below are as many as i have seen and some which are
suggested by pushing miscelanious (however thats spelled)
buttons.

    Machine Gun - Purchased from the super-niffty arsenal vending
machine.  This is the most used and effective weapon in my opinion,
you really dont need to get more than 100 lbs. worth of it though.

    Cannon - Also found in the vending machine.  not very useful
except for situations when your machine gun jams...

    Net Missle - Placed duringthe meeting at the begining of all
missions.  Using these are explained in the how to use and control
your shit section.


    Equipment Section
    -----------------
    Suit - I don't remember the exact name of the suit but it's in
the vending machine...If you plan to get out of your hoverbike and
walk around for a while you will need this.

    P.U.P. - A thing that picks up all the criminals you arrest.
You place these at the begining of the game in the meeting when
you place the nets.

    Extra Fuel Pod - This just gives you more fuel to cruise around
with.  I suggest getting this whenever possible.

    A few tips and hints
    --------------------
    * You must be within a certain distance whenever you are on foot
trying to do something...I.E..Arrest,Re-Enter Vehicle..ETC...

    * Run over Net Pods to pick them up.

    * Don't run over P.U.P.s they will be destroyed and you will
be fucked...The net pods look like a box...the PUPS look like a
new wave box...Be aware.

    * Make sure all of the susspects are in custody before you
attempt to re-enter your base...

    * When all of your objectives have been rechead,,,Land on the
station (anyone) and turn get out of your bike..Then hit I to go
inside.

    * Don't hit buildings after level 1 they kill you with 1 hit.

    * Use the external view when attempting to land F6...Also use
this when helping or waiting for the PUPS to land on the Station
it seems to work better for reasons i dont understand.

    * Place your net pods in the section by the station then
you can scoop down and pick up the nessesray amount and not
worry about it when you see an enemy.


                           MORE TIPS 


    RADAR  BLUE DOTS ARE YOUR NETS & PUPS
    RADAR  BROWN DOTS ARE DRIODS
    WHEN MENU COMES UP GOTO BACKUP AND LAY 4 NETS AND 4 PUPS ONTO MAP
    WHEN IN ARMOURY MAKE SURE YOU GET THE SUIT OR WHEN WALKING ABOUT
    YOUR AIR SUPPLY WILL RUN OUT FAST.
    ON TAKE OFF PRESS E FOR ENGINES.H FOR HOVER.PULL BACK MOUSE AND
    PRESS B FOR SPEED ONCE YOUR ABOVE BUILDING PRESS F FOR FLIGHT MODE
    FIRST HEAD FOR YOUR BLUE DOTS ON THE RADAR.
    FIND THE NET MISSILE PODS AND HOVER ABOVE THEM TO PICK THEM UP
    BE CAREFULL NOT TO HOVER ABOVE THE PUPS OR YOU WILL DESTROY THEM
    ONCE YOU HAVE PICKUP THE NETS PRESS N TO USE THEM.THEN FLY TOWARDS
    THE BROWN DOTS TO FIND THE DRIODS USE THE ROADS ITS SAFER.HIT TO
    MANY BUILDINGS AND YOUR DEAD DUDE!  ONCE YOU FIND A DRIOD WHEN YOUR
    CLOSE IT WILL LOCK ON THEN LET THE BASTARD HAVE IT IT WILL THROW A
    NET OVER THE DRIOD.CUT ENGINES AND LEAVE THE SHIP PRESS S TO ARREST
    AND THE P.U.P WILL BE SUMMOND.THATS ABOUT AS FAR AS I KNOW TRY WALKING
    INTO THE DRIOD ALSO DONT TRY WALKING ABOUT AT THE TOP OF BUILDINGS
    YOU MIGHT FALL OFF.
