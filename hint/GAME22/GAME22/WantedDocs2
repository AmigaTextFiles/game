	This is a list of documentation needed from games that I know exist
as of August 1,1991. Obviously docs to newly released games after this in
1991 are also requested. Several games are preceeded by an * symbol. Those 
are games where the docs are definitely needed to play the game and are
important to this disk series. Obviously, most of the shoot-em-ups and some
of the other simplistic games don't need docs to play, but I included the
entire list of missing docs for completeness.
	I need help! Less than half of the docs for the games released in 
the last three months have been found. Send docs, preferably on disk, 
although if you are lazy and you wish to send a Xerox of the manual, it is 
acceptable. Send to:
