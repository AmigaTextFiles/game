Insert disk one into the internal drive and boot it till you get a screen
with some icons. Just use the cursor keys to move to the check mark and
hit return.

After some titles load up just hit return and you will be taken to the
player selection menu:


               ----------------------------------------
                             INDTAST DIT NAVN
                             (enter your name)

               Spiller (Player) 1:
               Spiller (Player) 2:
               Spiller (Player) 3:

                                      OK

                                            ABCDEFGHIJK
               ----------------------------------------

Use the up/down cursor keys to select which player and the left/right keys
to scroll through the letters at the bottom of the screen. Hit return to
select a letter and continue till you fill up as many slots as you like.
When done with this hit return.


Now you have a screen that looks something like this:

                -------------------------------------
                JANE      TRINE      SOFIA     SIGNE
                MARIA     DONNA      GINNY     AMANDA
                -------------------------------------

Choose whoever you wish to play against with the cursor keys and hit return.

After some disk access you will probably be prompted for another disk with:

         Indsaet disk 2 og tryk return
         (Insert disk 2 and press return)

So do so and you will soon be facing your opponent.

The screen is divided into four areas. Like so:

           ---------------------------------------------
           |                    |                      |
           |                    |      The Cards       |
           |                    |                      |
           | The Woman          |                      |
           | (hopefully) in     |                      |
           | various states of  |                      |
           | undress            |                      |
           |                    |                      |
           |                    |                      |
           |                    |                      |
           |                    |                      |
           |                    |----------------------|
           |--------------------|                      |
           |                    |                      |
           |     Selections     |                      |
           |                    |        Money         |
           |                    |                      |
           |                    |                      |
           ---------------------------------------------

While on this screen you may use the number keys to zoom in on the woman
and have a look, scrolling around.

As you begin the game you will each have $2500. Your cards will be revealed
but hers will be hidden of course. Each time you make her loose all her money
she will do a little strip revealing a bit more, then be given some more
money. When you have completely stripped her you win the game. If you lose
all your starting money you just loose the game.

Now some options from the Sleection menu:
(Very hard to read so this is what I think it says...)

        ---------------------------------
        |         HAVE INDSTATS         |   -----> Raise
        ---------------------------------
        |          BYTTE ADORT          |   -----> Sorry, can't remember
        ---------------------------------
        |            SE KAIT            |   -----> Call
        ---------------------------------
        |             ORGIV             |   -----> Fold
        ---------------------------------

Choose the first option and you get this:

        ---------------------------------
        |                               |   -----> Place Bet
        --------------------------------- 
        |            GLEM DET           |   -----> Return
        ---------------------------------

On PLACE BET you can just hit return and bet the default. Entering a number
bets that amount of money. RETURN takes you back to the main options.

If you CALL all cards will be revealed and the one with the best hand wins
the pot.

Selecting FOLD means you quit the hand and she gets all the money no matter
who had what cards.



After some time of betting you will have the option to discard. Just use
the keys to move through your cards, and press the left/rights keys to
highlight cards you want to discard. Now hit return and get some new cards.



That's just about it, and all I know about it. Be sure to call...
