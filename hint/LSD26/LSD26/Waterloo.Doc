INTRODUCTION

Welcome to Waterloo.  Unlike other wargames you may have played,
Waterloo dispenses with the rather unreal 'overview' normally given to
wargames' commanders who are allowed to simultaneously examine troop
dispositions, movements, combat results, etc., and usually, to order and
move every aspect of an army with seemingly godlike powers.  So often,
many wargames ignore the difficult realities of, for instance, pre-radio
communications, and elaborate chain of commands through generals and
colonels of varying degrees of intelligence and skill, involving varying
degrees of success when the commander-in-chief's orders are executed, or
even the time delay between the occurrence of events in the field and the
relevant information being relayed back to your headquarters.


THE FOG OF WAR

In Waterloo, you are the Duke of Wellington, or the Emperor Napoleon,
and the price of such responsibility is high, since you, like them must
suffer the trials of a commander-in-chief of the Napoleonic era.  Your
view of the battle will be limited by the point at which you stand.  To
see more you will have to move around.  Your battle orders, though
written by you, will be executed by your subordinate corps commanders
who will, in turn, order their divisional general to move their
infantry, cavalry, and artillery units.  At the lowest level, regimental
colonels will make decisions over which you will have little control.

At each level of command, it is possible that the various commanders may
ignore your orders, either as a result of better local knowledge, a
surplus/surfeit of courage or skill.  Finally, all your own orders are
relayed by rider, involving a time delay between the issues of those
orders and their execution.

Waterloo is not so much a simulation of an existing wargame, as a
simulation of war itself.


PLAYER'S GUIDE

1. LOADING THE GAME

Load the game as normal.


2. SETTING UP THE GAME

Next you will be asked a number of questions.  If this is your first
game, the following should act as a guide.

(1) HUMAN TO PLAY NAPOLEON, WELLINGTON, OR BOTH COMMANDERS?
    You may select either side.  However, time is in Wellington's
    favour.  He can afford to sit tight at the very beginning of the
    battle, and the defensiveness of his initial stance should allow you
    a little breathing space while you try to guess the French
    intentions.

(2) MESSAGES BETWEEN GENERALS TO BE DISPLAYED?
    Although this would not be realistic it will be helpful to see how
    orders are interpreted by the computer.  Answer Y.

(3) PLAYER TO BE ALLOWED TO VIEW BATTLEFIELD FROM DIFFERENT PLACES THAN
    COMMANDER'S POSITION?
    For the purpose of familiarising yourself with the battlefield, its
    locations and how they are represented by the computer graphics,
    this is a must.  Realistically, of course, this would not be
    possible.  For the time being; answer Y.

(4) CANNONS FIRING?
    Answer Y to be able to see the puffs of smoke from cannons as they
    fire.

(5) NOTE WHAT THE PROGRAM IS DOING TO APPEAR AT BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN?
    Answer Y.

(6) CHANGE HISTORICAL ORDERS?
    At the start of the game both sides have been issued with the same
    orders as the actual battle.  Until you have familiarised yourself
    with the game, it is best not to change these, or you could end up
    in a mess.  As a starting point the historical orders are sufficient
    for most purposes.  Answer N (see section 6, when you wish to change
    them).

(7) SAVE GAME EVERY HOUR
    This is a precaution against the computer being accidentally switched
    off and refers to a simulated hour of game play.  Answer N.


3.  STARTING THE GAME.

With the Game set up, you may now turn your attention to the
battlefield.

Game Time starts at 11.30 in the morning and will end at 9.30 that
night.  Depending on which commander-in-chief you have chosen to play,
your view will either be from Wellington's start position looking south,
or Napoleon's looking north.  An approximate map has been supplied
indicating the initial dispositions of both armies lined from east to
west along opposing ridges.

If you have selected to play Napoleon, you will be asked if you are
ready to issue your Orders.  If you have chosen Wellington, you will
have to wait while the French move first.  Before issuing any Orders,
take this opportunity to examine the view, to look around the screen,
and familiarise yourself with the battlefield.


4.  OBSERVATIONS

Your initial view is from your commander's position (Napoleon or
Wellington).  Your commander is always located at the bottom of the
screen, no matter which direction he is looking in.  You can see as far
as one and a half, to two miles in any direction, bearing in mind that
the entire battlefield is five miles from east to west, and four miles
from north to south.


4.1  LOOKING AROUND

You may look in any one of four compass directions (North, South, East
or West) following the 'Orders' prompt at the bottom of the screen.  To
do this, simply type Look and give the compass direction you require.
Compass directions can be abbreviated to their initial letters.

For example:  Look East or Look E.

You will be given a perspective view of what the commander can see from
his present location.


4.2  THE MOUSE

The Mouse acts as a pointing finger from this perspective view.
Clicking on the mouse over villages, terrain features, army units, etc.,
will return names of various locations, the names of generals, unit
types and also the range and direction.  For a close up view (if the
view is obscured), just click the mouse on any obscured part and the
whole scene will appear.


4.3  LOOKING FROM OTHER POSITIONS

If, when answering the questions concerned with 'Setting Up the Game',
you answered Y to option (3), allowing you to Look from other positions,
you will be able to see what is happening from other battlefield
locations.

To do this, type Look, the compass direction you want to look in, then
From, and the name or point of location you want to look from.  For
example: typing 'Look S From Hougoumount', will show the view south from
the chateau of Hougoumount.

You could also type: 'Look E From Reille'.  This would show you that
corps commander's view east, though bear in mind that when viewing from
another general's position, you may only choose one from your own side.


4.4  MOVING THE HEADQUARTERS

One final way of altering what you can see on the battlefield is to move
your HQ.  During your army's movement phase you will be asked if you
wish to move your HQ.  If so, you will be asked the main compass
direction you wish to move it to, and having selected N, S, E or W you
may use the mouse to pick out the required direction.

The change of location will not take place immediately.  Your HQ will,
like other troops, move as far towards your named direction as time
allows.  You will then be able to view from your new position(s).

Please note that you will not be able to move if you are caught up in a
disordered retreat, or are mortally wounded.  For more on movement see
section 5.


4.5  RECOGNISING UNITS

Units can be identified by their different uniforms.  Point at a unit
and click the mouse to pick up details of what you can see.  Each
regiment is represented as a block of units led by a colonel.  Colonels
can be identified by their triangular flags.  During the course of the
game, units will change formation and direction.  The infantry, for
instance, will form into squares if threatened by cavalry, or guns will
be seen to be towed, or will be lined up to fire.

There will also be individual horsemen, either generals or riders
(messengers).  Generals will be carrying a flag; riders will not.
Senior Generals are colour coded and a square flag indicates a division,
corps, or commander-in-chief's position.


5.  ORDERS

You can type in your Orders in lower or upper case.  Also, spelling
mistakes, incorrect sentences and semantic errors are picked up.  In the
event of an error, the order is left on the screen with the cursor at
the word that the program thinks is out of place.  The order can be
edited using the cursor, backspace, or delete keys.  A pattern matching
routine will also allow words to be shortened to their shortest
identifiable sequence.  For example, the farm 'La-Belle-Alliance' can be
entered as La-Belle, since no other words start with these letters.

There are 7 main Order types available to you.  These can be typed in
following the 'Order' prompt when it appears on the screen.
They are:

     Basic Orders
     Battle Orders
     Support Orders
     Report Orders
     Transfer Orders
     Strategy Orders
     Defence/Attack Line Orders

In game terms, the Orders that you issue will follow a strict chain of
command, starting with you, the Commander-in-Chief, and following down
through the military hierarchy; first to the respective Corps
Commanders, then to their Divisional Generals, then to Regimental
Colonels.

The Commander-in-Chief (you) can only order their divisional generals
under them, and so on.  You will see how this works later in this
section.

Both players are able to enter a maximum of 8 Orders before the program
moves on to the next Turn and implements those Orders.

Each turn represents 15 minutes of simulated game time.

Whenever 'key' appears in red at the bottom right hand corner of the
screen, either click the mouse, press any key, or wait for time-out
(about 20 seconds), to go back to the 'Orders:' prompt.

The Orders that can be sent to your Corps Commanders are quite varied
and sophisticated.  However, there are also a number of Basic Orders
designed to help players.  These are detailed in the following section.


5.1  BASIC ORDERS

LOOK  -  The Look Order requires a compass direction, and can be
         combined with From which is the location you wish to Look
         (compass direction) From (place or name) - see section 4:
         'Observation' for more details.

NAME  -  This Order will detail the command structure of Corps
         Commanders of Divisional Generals, depending on which name is
         typed in.  The names of all subordinates and the troop type
         they control (i.e. Infantry, Cavalry, etc.) will be shown or,
         simply type, Corps.

POINTS - A running total of how well you are doing.  Points are given
         according to the current size of your army, the prisoners and
         casualties you have caused, and the farms and villages you
         control.

X or ESC Stops the computer from waiting for more Orders, allowing the
         program to move on to the next Turn, with less than 8 Orders
         submitted, which it can then execute in the next 15 minute
         period of battle.

PAUSE -  Freezes the game until you are ready to continue.

SAVE  -  Saves the current situation at the end of the next period of
         battle, but continues with the game.  Players willing to Save
         the game after every round could, if they wished, play
         'Waterloo' by mail; one player making his moves, and then
         posting the disk to his opponent, who likewise issues his
         Orders, saves the data, and posts the disk back.

QUIT  -  Abandons game.


5.2  BATTLE ORDERS

All Orders are merely sentences containing instructions for your Corps
Commanders.  These are typed into the computer and acted upon by your
units in the following turn.  The sentences that you type in must
contain certain instructions for it to be understood.

Battle Orders and every other type of Order described in the following
sections, consist of 2 components.
These are:

     Actions
     Conditions

For your Battle Orders, you have a choice of 6 Battle Actions.
These are:

     Move
     Attack
     Defend
     Shell
     Stay in Reserve
     Retreat

('Shell' means the firing of artillery batteries, the rest are self-
explanatory).

These 'Actions' are the commands that concern the movement and combat of
your units.

Once you have chosen a desired Action for your Battle Order, you must
then determine the 'Order Conditions' that will affect how, and by whom
it will be carried out.  For this, you will use some or all of the
following available Order Conditions.
These are:

     Who
     Place
     Time
     Duration
     All Corps

Order Conditions determine your troop's targets and objectives.

Let us assume that you wished an entire Corps to move to a specific
location.

First, state to whom your Orders are addressed (this must be the name of
a Corps Commander), then the time at which you wish them to Move, the
Battle Action they must perform (in this case they must Move), the place
they must move to.  So for example, you could type in:

     (Who)        (Time)        (Battle Action)        (Place)
     'Reille    at 12.30 pm          Move             to Pospol'

When stating who is to follow an order, remember that you may issue
direct Orders to Corps Commanders only.  If you want a specific unit to
follow an order, you must first type in a Corps Commander's name,
telling him to Order the unit for you.
The place need not be a named village or farm - it could be a General,
or a description of some terrain feature or enemy force, or simply a
distance and direction relative to one of these names.  To give a
relative position, type in a distance, then a direction, one of the
eight compass directions, then a place.  For example, '1.5 miles east of
Plancenoit'.  The time of the action is optional, it is merely when you
want the Orders to take effect.  Also, there is the duration, also
optional.  Its form is:

     'for (x) hours (y) minutes,' or
     'for (x) hours,' or
     'for (y) minutes'

A particularly powerful and useful Order Condition is 'all corps',
especially when combined with some of the Order types you will come to
later, for example the Battle Report Order, as in:

     'All Corps send me your Battle Report'

There is a vast number of possibilities, and all the Order Conditions
could apply to the 6 Battle Actions.  But you may wish to be more
specific.  You may, for instance, only wish for a Corps Commander to use
a specific type or number on his troops.

In that case, you must instruct him to 'Order' the Divisions to troop
types of his Corps with which you are concerned.  Let us assume you
wished one of your Corps Commanders to hold a hill with only two
infantry divisions.  Your instruction might be:

     'D-Erlon at 1.15 pm Order 2 infantry division to
     Defend the hills 1 mile south of you.'

Remember that it was necessary to use the word 'Order' in the sentence
because specific divisions were concerned.  It would be the same if you
wanted to move the Division under the command of General Donzelot.

Because Donzelot is subordinate to Corps Command D'Erlon, it would be
necessary to state:

     'D-Erlon at 1.15 pm Order Donzelot to Defend the hills
     1 mile south of you.'
     'D-Erlon Move Donzelot 1 mile south,' would be illegal.

If, in your Orders to a Corps Commander, you do not specify any forces,
he will select one or more of his own choice.  He will, at the same
time, be acting on his own initiative, issuing his own Orders within the
bounds of the strategy he is working in, and any attack/defence line
that may have been specified.

Here are some of the examples of a range of Battle Orders, using a
number of Battle Actions and Order Conditions:

     D-Erlon order your artillery to move 1/2 mile north
     Reille move to Mon-Plaisir
     Lobau Shell Mont-St-Jean Farm for 3 hours
     Drouot shell the enemy cavalry 1 mile north of you
     D-Erlon order your infantry to move to the HQ
     Reille at 2.30 pm Retreat


5.3  SUPPORT ORDERS

When a Corps Commander supports another, he transfers his own divisions
to the Corps he is supporting when requests for assistance are received.

Support Orders tell a Corps to give, take, stop giving, or stop taking
support from another Corps Commander.

There are 4 Support Actions:

     Give Support To
     Take Support From
     Stop Giving Support
     Stop Taking Support From

If a Support Action is taken, the corresponding Action is sent back
automatically.  So that if the Order:
'Lobau Give Support To Reille' is entered, then the commander's
staff send the Order:

'Reille Take Support From Lobau'

The conditions listed in 5.2 (Battle Orders) also apply to Support
Orders.  As with Battle Orders, you must state which Corps Commander
should perform the Action and you have the option of stating the time
when it should begin.

Added to the list of available Conditions previously given in section
5.2 is: (Assign Corps) which is the Corps a Commander will give support
to.  You may give support to more than one corps.

Here are some examples of Support Orders:

     Lobau give Support to Reille
     Lobau stop giving support
     Drouot at 6.30 pm give support to Reille, D-Erlon and Milhaud


5.4  REPORT ORDERS

A Report Order requests the Corps Commander to ask all subordinates for
details of men, guns, casualties, prisoners, etc. and to pass that
information back to you, the Commander-in-Chief.

The Report Action is:

     Send Me Your Battle Report

Examples:

     D-Erlon send me your battle report
     All Corps at 8.30 pm send me your battle report


5.5  TRANSFER ORDERS

This tells a Corps Commander to Transfer one or more of his divisions to
another Corps Commander.  There is only one Action to the Transfer Order
and that is, of course:

     Transfer

To the previous Conditions is added:

     Division

To Transfer a division to another Corps Commander, you may type in the
name of its General, or its type, and a specified or unspecified number
of divisions.  If you are not using the name of the division's general,
you must indicate its type, e.g.: infantry, etc.

Here are some examples of Transfer Orders:

     Lobau Transfer Domon to Reille
     Lobau Transfer your cavalry to Reille
     Lobau at 6 pm Transfer 2 divisions of infantry to D-Erlon


5.6  STRATEGY ORDERS

Corps Commanders will operate on one single strategy.  This Order will
probably only be issued at the beginning.  There may also be a need to
use it if things go very well, or very badly.

The Strategy Actions are:

     Change Your Strategy To Attack
     Change Your Strategy To Defend
     Change Your Strategy To Stand-By
     Change Your Strategy To Reserve
     Change Your Strategy To Retreat

Also, if you wish to minimise the level of control a Corps Commander has
over his divisions, in order to take direct control of them, change the
Corps Commander's Strategy to STAND.

Some Examples:

     D-Erlon At 1 pm Change Your Strategy To Attack
     Reille At 7 pm Change Your Strategy to Defend


5.7  ATTACK & DEFENCE LINE ORDERS

This is a strategic Order to those Corps Commanders who are to make up
the front line.  It is important that the front line is complete, as it
is in the historical Orders both armies start with by default.

A Corps Commander on the front line is given two places to form a line
between, and the two Corps Commander's names to be linked with at these
places.  Alternatively, a flank can be specified that does not require a
place or general to be named.

This Order need not be issued if you wish to use the historic Orders -
the Corps Commanders will adjust the line specified to ensure a firm
link with the named Commanders.  If a defence line is specified, the
Commander will make the best use of the surrounding terrain and
buildings, and an attack line will be pushed forward.

Your Choice of Strategies is:

     Form An Attack Line From
     Form A Defence Line From

Additional Conditions are:

     linking with
     the west flank
     the east flank

Examples:

     'Reille form a defence line from the west flank to La-Belle-
     Alliance linking with D-Erlon'.
     'D-Erlon form an attack line from La-Belle-Alliance linking with
     Reille to Frichermont linking with Lobau'.
     'Lobau form a defence line from 1/2 mile south of Frichermont
     linking with D-Erlon to the East Flank.

GENERAL

6.  HISTORICAL ORDERS

Obviously, the Orders you send are the key to the game.  However,
assuming that in the Set-up phase you answered N to the question 'Change
historical orders?' then the Corps Commanders and their Generals will
have already received the Orders they were historically given.  Fighting
will start even if no new Orders are sent.

If you choose to change the initial Orders, you may enter up to 30 new
ones for either side.  The Corps Commanders will keep their historical
Orders unless you change them, so their is no need to re-enter Orders a
Commander already has.  Your new Orders, if any, will take immediate
effect.


6.1 HISTORICAL EVENTS

Note that this simulation represents events as they were in history.
For that reason, the French will be unable to recall Grouch's Corps
which was, on that day, fighting some distance away in Wavre.  This also
means that the Prussians will arrive in the afternoon/early evening.


7. ASPECTS OF GAMEPLAY

The game works along basic Napoleonic principles.  The various movement
and combat results are calculated according to extreme detailed rules,
similar to those found in the more complex of Tabletop Wargames.  The
following are an indication of the more important aspects of play
represented within the simulation.


7.1  TROOP QUALITY

Logically enough, the best units on either side are in the guard units.
Line and Light units are regarded as professional soldiers with
appropriate training, whereas Landwehr or Militia are hastily assembled
forces, and not full-time soldiers.


7.2  ARTILLERY RANGES

Artillery Range is approximately 1/2 mile.
A battery of guns can only fire at a target it can see.
The artillery officers in the field select the most effective ammo types
according to the range and target.


7.3  MORALE

Units may be forced into disorganised retreats or temporary routs, and a
retreating unit can spark off several units into a major retreat.
Militia and Landwehr units have a fairly brittle morale, while others
can sustain more punishment before breaking.  Some routed units will
eventually reform, though their morale is likely to be shaky still.


7.4  MESSENGER RIDERS

The horsemen carrying messages are treated as units themselves.  They
can therefore get shot, or caught up in routs and lost.


7.5  OFFICER'S INITIATIVE

All commanders interpret their orders.  There are three levels of
'Intelligence' below the Commander-in-Chief: at Corps, Divisional and
Regimental level.  A Commander will attempt to use the terrain features
to his advantage and he may not obey an Order if he considers it
suicidal, out of date, or irrelevant to the local situation.  Corps
Commanders have a high degree of flexibility and can advance, retreat,
support each other, and make similar decisions without consulting with
the Commander-in-Chief.

The regimental commanders will order infantry into the optimum formation
for their relevant situation, i.e. forming square when faced by enemy
cavalry, line to maximise fire-power, column for heavier impact when
attacking.


7.6  EXCLUDED GAME ASPECTS

A few aspects of napoleonic Warfare have been excluded.  These are: smoke
blocking the line of sight, the breaking down of regiments into long
lines of skirmishers, and promoting or demoting of staff.


8.  THE END OF GAME

The battle ends at 9.30 pm.  Full battle reports will become available
and the result assessed.  You are also given the option of looking
around the battlefield.


9.  HINTS ON PLAY

TIME
One very important aspect when issuing Orders is to be aware of the time
delay that ensues while riders carry your messages to the relevant
commanders, and those commander's attempt to carry them out.  If you see
a crisis develop on the battlefield, think twice before acting upon it.
Be sure that what you are attempting can be achieved in time to be of
some use.  Perhaps the General in command will be able to sort it out
anyway.  Don't waste good troops sending them off on hopeless mercy
dashes that will weaken your army's cohesion.

ISSUING ORDERS
Make your Orders clear: 'Lancey move to La-Haie' is vague.  How many
divisions do you want to move to La-Haie?  Unless you want Lancey to
make the decision you'd best be more specific:
     'Lance Order 2 Infantry and your Cavalry to Move to La-Haie'

Don't use the 'Strategy' or 'Form Attack/Defence Line' Orders until you
are sure of what you're doing.  These Orders have a major effect on how
the game is fought.

SETUP OPTIONS
Be sure to use option (5) in section 2. - 'Setting Up The Game', which
allows you to see a note on what the programme is doing, especially when
you are learning.

ARTILLERY
Be sure to fully exploit the 'Shell' order.  Units behind hard cover may
be difficult to dislodge without an initial artillery barrage.  Don't
waste potential gun power on targets on the edge of their 1/2 mile
range.  Make sure your firepower is as effective as possible.  You may
consider massing the fire on many batteries against 1 target.  Try to
ensure that you support infantry or cavalry attacks with artillery.

RECONNAISSANCE
Keep 'Looking' at every opportunity.  Never forget that the battle is
going on all around you, and in places you cannot see.  Make sure you
ask for reports every hour or so.

'All Corps send me your Battle Reports' is well worth giving a sensible
schedule time, say, at halfway through the day.

PLANNING AHEAD
Don't try to do too much at once.  It is very easy to get in a muddle.
Set yourself an objective and a strategy, and try not to let unexpected
events distract you from your purpose.

Included in the following pages is some background to the nature of
Napoleonic warfare, the composition of its armies and the tactics they
actually employed in battle.  Obviously it will help if you know
something about how a Napoleonic army was led and how it fought.  The
section entitled 'The Hundred Days' traces the events that led up to
Waterloo and includes an account of the battle itself, all of which
should be of some help.


ARMY LISTS

UNIT STRENGTHS
Unit strengths are as follows:

     1 Infantry Regiment      1,000 men
     1 Cavalry Brigade        600 horsemen
     1 Artillery Battery      400 crew
                              16 guns

Prussian Brigades are approximately the size of British or French
Divisions.  The terms Regiment and Brigade can be applied to Infantry or
Cavalry.

The Prussian Landwehr are the equivalent to Militia.

NOTE: If you are familiar with the events of Waterloo you may notice the
absence of Marshal Ney on the French Army List.  Those wishing to play
the French are possibly quite relieved!  Since Napoleon gave Ney the
role of battlefield commander, charged with acting out Napoleons plans,
he might possible be leading any French units into battle.  He has not
been listed as any particular Corps commander, to reflect his semi-
independent status as Napoleon's 'right hand', as it were.
