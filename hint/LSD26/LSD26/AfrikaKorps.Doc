ABOUT THIS GAME

Afrika Korps is a strategic war game, simulating the desert theatre of
the Second World War.  The game involves one person playing against a
computer opponent.  This computer opponent has taken years of
development and testing - and the result is a system which offers three
real difficulty levels.  The first level is designed to be easy enough
to offer a challenge to newcomers to wargames; more experienced gamers
should try level 2, or, for a real challenge, level 3.


INTRODUCTION

Afrika Korps is an historical simulation of the campaign fought in the
western desert during World War II.  You can command the Axis forces of
Erwin Rommel, or the Allied forces of the British Army.

The game is played in turns, from two principle screens - the tactical
and the strategic maps.  The tactical map covers a far larger area and
gives you an overall perspective.

Your objective is either to defeat the opposing army, or to reach either
El Agheila or Alexandria, depending on which army you are commanding.
You control the divisions forming your army by issuing orders to each
individual divisional commander.  This involves an attack and/or defence
line for their divisions.  The computer-controlled intelligent commander
will then direct their units with their new objectives in mind, thus
enabling you to influence your commander's strategy.

Each division can be directed to a new area of operations or a new axis
of attack and defence by changing the front line of parameters.

Divisional commanders will tell you of their intentions using a series
of messages, and your own General Headquarters will advise you in the
same manner.  At the end of each game turn you have a number of
indicators providing information on reinforcements, division strengths,
commander's plans and the relative effectiveness of both armies.


LOADING

Insert the disk and turn on your computer.
To start a brand new game, press return when the game has finished
loading.
To load a previously-saved game, follow the on-screen menu instructions.


SAVE GAME

Follow the on-screen menu instructions to save a game to disk.  You will
need a blank formatted disk for this purpose - the game disk may not be
used.  Note that the save game option is not permitted before the first
turn is completed.


DIFFICULTY LEVELS

Afrika Korps has three difficulty levels: 1 is the easiest, 3 the
hardest.  You must select the level you wish to play.


PLAYING AFRIKA KORPS

There are two main modes of control in the game - Map control, and Menu
control.  When in Map control, moving your mouse/keyboard scrolls around
the map; in Menu control, you move between the different command
options, all of which are available from a menu.

You play the game by assigning units to divisions (if you wish to
reallocate strength from one place to another) and setting attack and
defence lines for each division.  You then instruct each division
whether to advance or defend, and thus move your forces around with a
view to defeating your computer opponent.


GAME CONTROL

you may play Afrika Korps using either the mouse or keyboard.  You are
given the option to toggle between these two control methods at the
start of each game turn.  Press RETURN to select keyboard control, or
click the left mouse button to select mouse control.

Where these instructions say 'select' something, this means moving the
mouse pointer to that item, and pressing the left mouse button (unless
specific instructions say otherwise).  For users wishing to use the
keyboard, selecting menu options is done simply by pressing the
appropriate letter on the keyboard.  If in keyboard mode, use the cursor
keys to move the mouse pointer around the map.


KEYBOARD CONTROL

You may scroll the maps using either the cursor keys or the mouse.

Single letter keystrokes should be used to avoid the possibility of
skipping the next section if that section responds to the same letter
key.  (Cursor can, though, be held down for scrolling the maps) The game
automatically sets Caps Lock on; if this key is inadvertantly pressed,
the keyboard will not respond - simply press Caps Lock to rectify this.


MOUSE CONTROL

Movement of the mouse scrolls both maps.

The right hand button is used to switch between map and menu control.

In menu control, mouse movement will highlight the various section names
on the menu.

The left hand button will access the section highlighted.  When you exit
a menu section, control automatically reverts to map control.  If you
wish to access another section, press the right hand button again to
regain control.

Armies are accessed by moving the mouse pointer to your desired army,
and clicking the left mouse button.  Please ensure that the mouse is
stationary when you click the left button, and do not hold the mouse
button down - or you may skip the next section.


MAIN MENU

This is the first of two control menus.  It provides the following
functions:

     Scrolling of strategic and tactical maps
     Direct access to any part of the tactical map
     Access to the army menu
     Access to Army Re-Organisation
     Start Next Game Turn

With Keyboard Control:

     Use the S and T keys to switch between maps
     Use appropriate letter keys to access functions
     Press Zero key to start next game turn

With Mouse Control:

     When in map control use the left button to switch between maps
     Move the mouse to highlight differnet options, and click the left
     button to access that option
     While in Menu Control, clicking on MAP and then T or S changes the
     map.

In order to avoid accidentally starting the next game turn, you must
press the left mouse twice (when MOVEMENT 0 is highlighted) to start the
next turn.


ARMY ORDERS - A

This option allows access to the army menu, for the purposes of issuing
orders, or reviewing unit details, current orders, road move, and army
information.


REORGANISATION - R

Press the R key or use standard mouse procedure to access this option.

Then select R to access strategic reserve, or M for strategic movement.
Initially there are no units in either of these sections.


STRATEGIC RESERVE

In between game turns 8 and 24, you will receive a number of
reinforcement units.

Units in strategic reserve with a strength below 100% will amalgamate
with other similar units to form new full-strength units.

For each turn that a unit spends in strategic reserve, its morale is
increased by one step, to a maximum of excellence.


UNIT ASSIGNMENT:

To assign a reserve unit to a division, highlight it on the map, then
press the U key, and then enter the appropriate division letter key for
your chosen division for that unit.

If there are more than 12 units in strategic reserve, access the second
page of them via the P key.

Under mouse control, highlight the unit you wish to assign, from map
control, then select your chosen division from Main Control, using the
left mouse button.

To abort the command, simply select EXIT at any time.

Note that you cannot assign units to a division that has lost all its
units, and you can only assign units to divisions of the same
nationality.

You can check that this assignment process has been carried out
satisfactorily by accessing the strategic reserve - the newly units
should no longer be there, but should instead be seen in the strategic
movement section.


STRATEGIC MOVEMENT

This section contains details of all units moving between divisions and
strategic reserve.  The time this travel actually takes depends upon the
units distance from the appropriate map edge; the maximum delay is
twelve game turns.

A unit moving to a division will show that division's colour code
alongside the unit details.

A unit arriving at the division to which it has been assigned, will
appear on the map if:

     the division has less than six units on the map
     AND
     the division has a supply rate greater than 25%
     AND
     the HQ symbol of that division is not already covered by another
     unit.

The unit will then appear over the HQ symbol.  Any number of units can
be assigned to a division, although only six will appear on screen; the
rest will form a tactical reserve for that army.


DIVISIONAL REINFORCEMENTS

During the course of the game, both armies will receive reinforcements,
which will arrive at either El Agheila or Alexandria.


TO START A NEW GAME TURN

When you have given all the orders you wish to give, start the movement
and combat again by pressing/highlighting and clicking on, MOVEMENT-0.


THE ARMY MENU

This second control menu allows you access to the following functions:

     Army Orders
     Unit details
     Army information
     Current orders
     Road Move
     Main Menu (via EXIT X)

Access each section in the same way as for the main menu options.

Please note that only the tactical map is displayed when using this
menu; to view the strategic map, you must return to the main menu.


ORDERS - O

Each division is allocated both a letter and a colour code.  To select a
division, simply highlight the division on screen, and either click the
left mouse button or press the appropriate letter key.

Select A to change the attack front line, or D to change the defensive
front line of the individuaol army.

You can change just the division commanders mode without changing either
of the front line parameters, by selecting X.


CHANGING THE FRONT LINE:

After access, a cross-hair cursor will appear on the divisional HQ, an X
on one unit, an R on a second unit, and an L on a third unit.

For the first unit, move the cursor to the position you wish that unit
to move to, and press the T/left mouse button.  Then repeat this
procedure for the R and L units, forming the three points to your
desired new front line.

Repeat this procedure again for all units in the division (in batches of
three units at a time).

Should you wish to retain a previously issued order to any unit, press
the X key rather than the T key, or press the right mouse button to skip
a unit.  This allows the player to change one or more unit's orders
without needing to reset all units.


ATTACK (A)      DEFEND (D)      DISCRETION (E)

To instruct your divisional commanders whether to attack or defend, or
whether you wish to leave it to their individual discretion, simply
press one of the A, D or E keys (as appropriate) or use standard mouse
procedure.

These 'modes' for divisional commanders have the following effects:

ATTACK:

The divisional commander is biased in favour of an attack, but is not
forced to do so.  The division commander can decide either to move
towards his attack front-line, or towards any enemy units in his
immediate proximity.  If the commander feels that his position is
particularly hopeless, he may still decide to defend, when he will use
the rules governing a defend order.

DEFEND:

The divisional commander here has just two options - to move all units
towards their defensive front line positions, or, if he thinks his
positions hopeless, to retreat.  In retreat, the divisional commander
will use his defence front lines as a guide as to where to retreat to.

DISCRETION:

While still using the front lines set by the player as a guide to
movement, the divisional commander will decide himself whether to
attack, defend or retreat.

Clearly, the player has most control over divisional commanders when
they are in defend mode.


UNIT DETAILS D

Select D, followed by either A(llied) or G(erman) to access the
respective armies.  Computerised opponents army units will not be shown
if the units are too far away from the player's army units.

The numbers at the bottom of the player units display the current morale
levels.

If one screen will contain an entire division's units, then the whole
division's details will be shown at once.  Select X to access another
division of the same side, or X twice to access one of the other side's
divisions.  Return to the controlling menu screen by selecting Z.


ARMY INFORMATION (I)

Press I and then use control as for unit details; army information,
including the supply situation, will then be shown.

Unit details and army information sections can be used for general
information purposes, or for specific comparisons of two opposing
divisions.  Scroll the map so that two opposing divisions are displayed
in the centre of the screen, then access unit details or army
information for both divisions.

The screen will now show both relative positions, and information about
the two divisions for detailed decision-making purposes.


SUPPLY STATUS

The higher the supply status of a division, the more effective its units
will be in combat, the more individual combats the units of a division
indulge in per game turn, the more likely the supply status is to
decline.


SUPPLY RATE

The supply rate of a division is determined by the distance each
division is from an 'in-supply' road position: the greater the distance,
the lower the rate of supply.  Road supply is cut if an enemy unit is
on, or adjacent to, a road position.  All road positions after the point
at which supply is cut, will be out of supply.

The supply rate is used to top up the supply status of a division.  If
the supply status used as a result of combat is less than the supply
rate, then the supply status will be increased by the difference, to a
maximum of 100%.

The units of a division with less than 30% supply rate, will suffer a
one step reduction in mmorale per game turn.  The units of a division
with abysmal supply rate will progressively lose effective strength.


CURRENT ORDERS (C)

Select G or A to access respective armies, then the code letter of the
army required.

For the Player's units, the current movement order of each unit will be
displayed by a series of arrows.  Should the arrows extend off screen,
scroll the map to the required position, and press a key other than the
X key, or click the right mouse button.

The arrows are not printed if movement extends through another units.
The short arrow denotes the objective position of a unit.

For Computer-Opponent units, the arrows represent the previous turn's
incomplete movement.  They indicate what the opponent was trying to do
on the previous turn.  The computer opponent may or may not continue
along similar lines.


ROAD MOVE (R)

Select R to access this section.  Select the appropriate division, then
select R to move the division towards the right hand map edge or L to
move towards the left.

To allow the road move, the following conditions must be met:

     The division HQ is within 4 units of the road
     No enemy HQ is within 10 unit positions of the friendly HQ
     All units of the division are within command radius of the HQ

You will not be allowed to access a division in this section if any of
these conditions are not met.


MOVEMENT

Each player unit is allocated a number of movement points each game
turn, dependant upon its type (see unit chart).  These points are used
up according to terrain crossed, according to the rates shown on the
terrain chart.

Each unit exerts a degree of control over adjacent positions; as a
result, no unit next to an enemy unit may move directly to a position
that is also adjacent to an enemy unit.


COMBAT

After each unit's movement, the units of that army are considered
attacking units during combat and the opposing units as the defenders.
Combat occurs between adjacent enemy units, including diagonal
adjacency.

Combat terrain adjustments are applied as shown on the terrain charts.
Units with a Defend order will not attack and, when themselves attacked,
will defend with a 15% bonus added to their effectiveness.  Units will
attack only at the discretion of their respective division commanders.

Units receive a combat bonus according to their type - see unit chart.
The supply status of a division adds a combat bonus to each unit up to
25% of the unit's current strength; the lower the supply status, the
lower the combat bonus.

In a single combat phase, each unit will have its effectiveness reduced
by one quarter of its current strength in its second and subsequent
combat in that combat phase.

Combat losses are shown as a percentage loss to their effectiveness
within each unit's symbol as combat occurs.


ADVANCE AND RETREAT DURING COMBAT

Defending units may retreat, and attacking units advance, depending upon
the results of combat.  A retreating unit will move in a direction
determined by the relative positions of the two units.  An advancing
unit will move towards the position set by its current movement order.
An attacking unit advancing after combat will still resolve combat with
all enemy units it was adjacent to before the advance took place.


DISBANDMENT

At the end of each game turn, each unit is subject to a disorganised
test.  Passing the test is based on the unit's strength, but more
significantly on the unit's morale.  A unit failing this test will
disband and be sent, via strategic movement, to strategic reserve if its
army has a supply rate of more than 25%.  If the unit's supply rate is
less than this, the unit will be lost.

An army containing just one unit will automatically disband at the end
of each game turn.


ARMY HEADQUARTERS

The player's HQ are for purposes of access and control.  The computer's
HQs provides the player with limited intelligence regarding the position
of the computer's forces.  It must be stressed that an HQ is not a
physical unit - units may move freely through the HQ, with no effect.


COMMAND RADIUS

A unit more than five unit positions from its HQ at the start of a
movement phase will move towards its HQ.  It is effectively out of
command.  The position of an HQ is the centre of each divisional
calculated on the average line and column number of all units in each
division.


LIMITED INTELLIGENCE

Computer units whose exact positions are known are displayed on the
screen.  Units whose positions but not type are known are displayed by
an HQ symbol.  Divisions whose general whereabouts are known have their
HQ displayed.


MORALE

The morale level of a unit adds to the overall effectiveness of each
unit as follows:

     Excellent -          +30%
     Very Good -          +25%
     Good -               +20%
     Fair -               +15%
     Low -                +10%
     Poor -               +5%
     Abysmal -            Nil

Any unit suffering 15% or 20% loss in a single combat will have its
morale reduced by one step.


VICTORY CONDITIONS

The game ends when either army is reduced to less than 30%
effectiveness, or when the Axis army reaches the right hand edge of the
map, or the Allied army reaches the left hand map edge.

At this stage, select Y to continue the game, or reset the computer to
play again.


End.
