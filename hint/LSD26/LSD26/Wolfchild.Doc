INTRODUCTION
------------

Sometime in the future....


For threee decades, Kal Morrow has been regarded as one of the worlds
leading scientists, pushing back the barriers of biogenetic research
with a force that few have equalled.


His many medical breakthroughs have resulted in the eradiction of
several major diseases, and have increased human longevity by over
forty years.


His research has had far reaching effects, touching the areas of
agriculture, deep sea and space exploration, sport and military
technology.


For the past five years, Morrow has worked for the government,
perfecting advanced gene splicing techniques which allow the
alteration of the human form in ways never before imagined.


In particular, the developement of physic powers such as, telekinesis
and levitaion, and the combination of human animal physiologies to
create a new breed of life form.


A perfect war machine; Argmented human intelligence complimented by
animal instinct, within a body that is immune to pain and capable of
incredible feats and psyhic power.


Totally adaptable to their environment, a force of such warriors would
be unstoppable.


Morrows research has been conducted at the Keppler observatory, on a
remote island somewhere in the southern pacific.


His location has been kept secret due to the sensitive nature of his
work, and to that end, his family:  His wife and two sons have lived
with him, under constant guard.


However, his whereabouts were uncovered by the international terrorist
organisation CHIMERA.


Led by the fanactical Karl Draxx, a confirmed sociopath, he posses's
natural telekenetic abilities, CHIMERA have perpetrated many acts of
terrorism through out the world.


Analysis of Draxx's own persona and the nature of these incidents has
led experts to one conclusion - That through CHIMERA, Draxx is
persuing his own megalomaniac fantasy of world domination.

Until recently it was never believed that Draxx could ever realise his
dream.


Thirty Six hours ago, CHIMERA made an attack on the Keppler
observatory and kidnapped Kal Morrow.


The attack was swift and totally overwhelmed Morrows security force.


There were no survivors.


Unpon entering Morrows private quarters, his wife and eldest son were
brutally murdered before his eyes.


At the time of the attack, Morrows youngest son Saul, was at sea
conducting oceanagraphic research for his father.


But, by the time he had reached the island, CHIMERA had long gone
leaving the island in ruins.


Frantically he searched for his family, finally discovering his
mothers bloodstained body in a corridor.


Through tears of grief and anger, he clutched her broken form,
swearing vengance on the perpetrators of this terrible act.

Making his way to his fathers secret laboratory, concealed deep below
the island, he reviewed the security tapes of the attack.


His rage grew as he saw his father being dragged away helpless, his
family slaughtered in full view of the camera's impassionate gaze.


There was no choice.


Saul was going to rescue his father, and seek vengeance on CHIMERA.


But, allthough he was a considerable athlete, he was no match for
them.


Unless he made himself so.


Accessing his fathers computer files, he uncovered PROJECT WOLFCHILD -
A genetic program designed to create a lycanthropic warrior.


A human with the ability to transform into a powerfull Man - Wolf with
awesome psychic powers.


With such strength, he will have a fighting chance.


Activating the program, he stepped into the transmutation booth...
