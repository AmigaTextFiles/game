ABC'S WIDE WORLD OF SPORTS BOXING PRESENTS

THE HISTORY OF BOXING

ABC'S Wide World of Sports Boxing captures the challenge, thrill and
excitement of a sport that dates as far back as 1750 B.C.  Winding its
way through many cultures and centuries - from the original leather-
fisted warrior matches of Mesopotamia (modern Iraq) to the Olympiads
of ancient Greece to 17th-century England - prize fighting's endless
popularity truly makes it the sport of the ages.

The American boxing story begins officially in the late 1800s, when the
first United States-born fighter claimed a world championship.  The
amazing John L. Sullivan - who lost only one fight in 75 career matches -
was the first link in an almost-unbroken chain of American dominance 
in the professional boxing ranks since then.

Sullivan and his primary adversary of the time, Gentleman Jim Corbett,
launched a tradition of legendary boxing confrontations that
continues to this day - with each generation bearing witness to
classic duels with legacies that will live forever:

JACK DEMPSEY VS. GENE TUNNEY

Dempsey and Tunney fought a combined total of 157 career fights -
getting knocked-out only once between them.

JOE LOUIS VS. EZZARD CHARLES

Louis reigned as champion for more than a decade, while Charles' 122
career fights still stand as a heavyweight record for most professional
bouts.

JERSEY JOE WALCOTT VS. ROCKY MARCIANO

Marciano, the original Rocky, retired undefeated after 49 bouts and
seven title defenses.

FLOYD PATTERSON VS. INGEMAR JOHANSSON

Swedish-born Johansson was only the fourth non-American to ever hold
the heavyweight title.

SONNY LISTON VS. CASSIUS CLAY

Liston dropped Patterson in a first-round knockout to claim the title 
before getting pounded by Clay, who later, as Muhammad Ali, was known
as The Greatest.

Ali was banned from boxing for not accepting a U.S. Army draft.  But
following his return, Ali's legendary confrontations with Smokin'
Joe Frazier, George Foreman and Ken Norton established him as the most
recognized and popular boxer of all time.  In recent years, only Iron
Mike Tyson's reign of terror has come close to equalling Ali's
accomplishments in the ring.

STARTING A CAREER

ABC's Wide World of Sports Boxing goes far beyond the basic in-the-ring
action detailed in the Boxer's Notebook.  The game allows you to create
your very own boxer from scratch and direct his entire boxing career -
both in and out of the ring.  This role-playing element takes you through
a boxer's rise up the ranks: from unknown to world champ.  To start a
career, SELECT the Career Option at the Main Menu.

CREATING A NEW BOXER

At the Career Options Menu, SELECT New Career to create a new boxer.
You will be taken to the Career Boxer Profile Screen, where you will
type in the Name and Hometown of your new boxer on the keyboard -
press ENTER after each item has been input.

PHYSICAL ATTRIBUTES

Next you will have the opportunity to choose the physical attributes
of your new fighter.  In each category, LEFT will decrease the
number for that category and RIGHT will increase it - except for
Stance, where LEFT and RIGHT are Left-Handed and Right-Handed,
respectively; and Style, where LEFT and RIGHT will toggle you through
four types of Boxers.

UP or DOWN lets you move from one category to another.  When you have
made all your choices, SELECT Save and Continue to move on to Build
Your Boxer.  These are your physical attribute choices:
 
AGE: Ranges from 18 to 35.  Younger fighters are less mature and lack
experience, but are generally closer to peak physical condition.

HEIGHT: Ranges from 66 inches to 78 inches.  Taller fighters will be
harder to cut, but will lack the footwork and agility of a short boxer.

WEIGHT: Weight: Ranges from 190 lbs. to 250 lbs.  Weight means power,
but it also means less stamina and speed.

REACH: Ranges from 68 inches to 86 inches.  Longer reach clearly
means a defensive advantage in keeping your opponents at bay.  The
advantage to a shorter reach is a more compact and powerful punch.

STANCE: Either Left-Handed or Right-Handed.  Not all boxers have to be
right-handed, so use this option to throw your opponents off guard.
This choice impacts your Joystick controls and what punch each 
Joystick/Button movement results in - punches will be opposite for
Left and Right Handers.  Note: If you choose to be left-handed, your
left hand will be stronger than your right.

STYLE: There are four basic styles of fighting:

Brawler: Always tries to move in - usually never gives ground.  Will
tend to trade punches rather than try to defend.

Dancer: Tends to move in and out quite a bit.  Usually well balanced,
although at times may be slightly more defensive than offensive. 

Boxer: A cross between a Brawler and a Dancer, with qualities 
of both but not as extreme as either.  He tends to be more offensive
than defensive.

Dodger: The most defensive of the styles.  He will tend to move around
a lot, especially up and down.

Note; Style is only used if you choose to have the computer control
your boxer during a fight (see Trainer - Fighting Mode).

BUILD YOUR BOXER

Apart from physical attributes that impact what happens in the ring,
you have an image to maintain as an up-and-coming young boxer.  Do
you want to strike fear in your opponents, or would you rather go
for the clean-cut look that will make you a crowd favorite?  At 
the Build Your Boxer Screen - which operates exactly like the Physical
Attributes Screen - you have several different options in each of
the following four categories:

Head: Choose a profile and hair-style for your boxer.

Skin: Determine the skin coloring of your boxer.

Hair: Determine your boxer's hair color.

Trunks: Finally, choose the color of your boxer's trunks.

Remember, you're going to be with this boxer his entire career, so
build one you'll be proud of.  When you have made all your choices,
SELECT Save and Continue.

BOXER RATINGS

There are ten basic ratings that you will initialize for you boxer.  As
you will learn in Training Camp, there are three ways to increase your
ratings during your career: participating in a fight; buying equipment;
and hiring a trainer.  Your initial settings, however, will determine
the foundation of your boxer's entire career.  You have a total pool of
500 points that you can distribute among the following ratings, as you
best see fit for your desired boxing style:

Stamina: The boxer's overall resistance to fatigue and an opponent's
punches.  This is one of three ratings that appears during a fight -
if it is taken down to nothing, your boxer will be knocked down.

Power: Your boxer's overall punching power.

Defense: Your boxer's ability to withstand punishment.

Chin: Your boxer's resistance to hits to his head.  This rating also
appears on the screen during a fight as the Knockdown Head Gauge,
which when decreased to zero means your boxer will get knocked out.

Body: As with Chin, Body indicates resistance to body punches and also
appears on the screen during a fight.  If your gauge decreases to zero,
your boxer is knocked out.

Footwork: Your boxer's speed and movement around the ring.

Hand Speed: The speed at which you can throw consecutive punches.

Cuts: Your boxer's resistance to getting cut during a fight.

Killer Instinct: Your boxer's ability to sense when an opponent is hurt
and to put a little extra into each punch he throws - looking to end
the match right there.  When your boxer goes into Killer Mode during a
match, his name will start flashing on the screen.

Conditioning: Your boxer's ability to regain Stamina, Head and Body
points on the gauges between rounds of a match.

OFFENSIVE PUNCH POWER

Finally, you will be given a pool of 40 percentage points to add to the
minimum values of any of the three types of punches your boxer can throw:
Jabs/Straights, Hooks/Crosses, and Uppercuts.  This distribution of your
power lets you determine what kind of balance you want in the strength
of the punches you throw.  For example, applying 40 points to your
minimum uppercut value of 25 will provide your boxer with a lethal weapon
in that particular punch, but will result in an extremely weak 10-
point jab, and a mediocre 25-point hook.

Once you've set your punching percentages, SELECT Save and Continue.

TRAINING CAMP

After creating a boxer, go to the Training Camp to meet your manager
and trainer - and to schedule your first bout.

YOUR MANAGER

Each manager takes a certain percentage of the boxer's purse, with the
better managers getting more of your money because they can schedule
you better matches.  Also, the better your manager, the bigger 
percentage of the total fight purse he can get for you, and the more
hometown matches he can schedule for you.  (Hometown matches are 
important since many judges tend to favor the hometown boxer.)

Each manager has a certain range of possible opponents they can set
you up against, but only the best can get you a match with the champ.
All managers are contracted for a specified length of time, and most 
require a signing fee up front.  You can fire your manager before his
contract is up, but it will cost you.  The buy-out fee is based on the
number of fights remaining in the contract, the manager's cut of those
purses, and the boxer's current rank.  The managers can also fire their
boxers, but only when their contracts have expired, and only if the
boxer's ranking is too low for that manager.

555-6466
"I will show you the path to enlightenment and the championship title."

There are six managers in the game:

JOHN DANIELS:

John is known to spend most of his time at the local tavern.  All new
fighters start the game with him in their corner.  
Contract length: 2 fights
Signing fee: None

HOLLYWOOD HOWIE:

A flashy manager who is usually more show than go.
Contract length: 3 fights
Signing fee: $250

FIFI LAMORE:

Fifi is a knockout!  She doesn't know a lot about boxing but she's
a decent manager.  She uses her good looks and sex appeal to sweet
talk other managers and promoters.

Unfortunately, she likes to prey on amateur boxers.  A single night
with Fifi has ended more than one aspiring champion's career.
Contract career: 5 fights
Signing fee: $5,000

TONY CAPPUCCINO:

Tony is a traditional Italian with a mama in the Old Country.  He's
known to have a gambling habit.
Contract length: 4 fights
Signing fee: $1,000

GUS DONOVAN:

Comes off like a cranky old man, but is extremely fair and trustworthy.
He keeps his word and sticks with his fighters through thick and thin.
Contract length: 6 fights
Signing fee: $20,000

DON MCQUEEN:

Very flamboyant and powerful.  He is untrustworthy and will do anything
to make a buck, but he's still the best manager around.  
Contract length: 8 fights
Signing fee: $50,000

To enter your manager's office, SELECT the Manager sign.  Your manager
will offer you several items you can discuss.  After you are through
with your manager, SELECT Nothing from the list of things to Talk About
to return to your main Training Camp Screen.

ARRANGING NEXT FIGHT

SELECT Arranging Next Fight to see a list of all available matches
you can schedule.  As you move higher on the rankings, the bouts 
may be scheduled a month or two in advance.

As other fighters get involved in the game, schedules in your area
of the rankings will tighten up and there may be no matches available
for you.  In this case, you will be given a Bye month during which
you will not have a match.  You may also choose to have a Bye month
if you feel the need to sit one out.  However, if you select a Bye
and are challenged by a boxer the next month, you must fight.

Note: If your manager schedules a fight after a Bye, when you next
visit the Training Camp, the Trainer's sign will be highlighted 
instead of the Manager's sign.  Ask your Trainer for the Fight
Strategy to see who will be fighting.

While the major impact on increasing your ratings will come from 
fighting, it is actually wise not to fight each and every month,
as some ratings will increase with rest and recuperation.

PURSES

The purse is determined by the rankings of the two boxers involved;
each boxer will take out a percentage based on 1) the two managers
involved, and 2) the difference in ranking.

READING THE MAGAZINE

This option takes you into the Wide World of Boxing Magazine which is
discussed in detail later in this Guide.

FIRING YOUR MANAGER

You must continually keep an eye on your manager's ability to guide your
career.  There are a number of different managers in the game.  The 
better your manager, the higher the caliber of competition you'll be
able to schedule vital as you climb the ranks - and the bigger the
payoff of each match.

If your manager is not living up to your expectations, you can fire
him once you've completed the number of fights required in your
contract.  He may also give you the option to buy your way out of
the contract.

In order to sign better managers, you will need to pay them an initial
signing bonus and be willing to offer a bigger share of your earnings   
to them.  After you've accumulated some bucks and are ready to sign
a new manager, SELECT Firing Manager to see a list of all the 
managers currently available to you - initially not many.  SELECT a 
new manager from this list and you'll go to your new manager's office.

LOCKING YOUR CAMP

When more than one human-controlled boxer is playing the game, you may
want to lock others out of your training camp to prevent spying or
tampering.  To set up a password for your individual training camp, 
SELECT Locking Camp.  You will then need to type in your password
(up to 8 characters), which you'll be asked to type in next time you
want to enter this boxer's camp.

Note: If you forget your password, type DELETE when asked for it.
Caution - this will delete your boxer.

RETIRING

You can have as many as 10 human-controlled boxers active in the game at
one time.  In order to create new boxers after the initial 10 slots have
been filled, you will need to retire one or more of the boxers you
created.  Retiring also lets you get rid of boxers you no longer want -
like those who go 0-37.

Even great boxers must hang it up some time: Toward the end of a boxer's
career, you'll notice that his ratings - which gradually increased 
throughout his career - will suddenly begin to decrease.  This is a 
good time to start thinking about another line of work.

When you retire your boxer, you have the option of placing him on the
Open Exhibitioners List.  Computer-controlled boxers at the end of their
careers will automatically retire and will be replaced by new computer-
controlled boxers at the bottom of the rankings.

YOUR TRAINER

When you hire a trainer, he will bring with him certain points that will
be added to each of your ratings.  When you change trainers, most, but not
all, of your old trainer's points are lost, but you gain the points of
your new trainer.  Like your manager, each trainer will take a certain 
percentage of your winnings, the exact amount depending on how good the
trainer is.  Unlike managers, you cannot fire your trainer.  They are
with you for the duration of their contract.  At the end of each month,
when the contract is up, new trainers will present themselves to offer
their services.  Make your choice by comparing your weaknesses with the
improvements that each trainer will guarantee you.  The better your
trainer is, the more he will be able to tell you about the next opponent.

SELECT the Trainer sign to enter your trainer's office.  As with your

trainer.  When you are through, SELECT Nothing to leave his office.

EXHIBITION MATCH

This selection lets you fight one of the boxers from the Exhibition
Screen without it affecting your record or rankings.  This is a great 
way of matching your boxer against opponents that you're not allowed
to challenge in a real fight.

The opponents you will find on this list consist of 20 predetermined
boxers and up to 10 gamer-created boxers.  These 10 slots can also
be occupied by retired career boxers.  The 20 others are split into
two groups: the Sparring Partners and the Specialists.  The Sparring
Partners have their ratings set to simulate boxers that a career boxer
would meet during his journey to the championship ring, with the best
ones at the top of the list.  These are best for use in your training
camp when you want a good workout.  The Specialists have one or more 
of their ratings much greater than their others, making them awesome
in one category, but pretty average in the others.  These are good for
a concentrated workout in a particular area.

SPARRING PARTNERS' PROFILES

The Champ - Nearly perfect in every category; killer right hand uppercut
(1-4 ranking)

The Challenger - A brilliant fighter who dances circles around opponents
(4-7 ranking)

Red Ryder - Red's his favorite color from his head to his trunks, mean
hook/cross (7-10 ranking)

Miguel Mauler - Cuba's finest, loves cigars, loves to brawl (10-13
ranking)

Goldenboy Gwynn - So Cal surfer dude spars on the side (13-16 ranking)

Thai Quando - An up and comer from Korea; loves to weave and bob (16-19
ranking)

Terrible Ivan - From Russia's hot spot comes a mean-spirited brawler
(19-22 ranking)

Baldy Boone - A skinhead lefty whose bark is meaner than his bite
(22-25 ranking)

Herman Saweeny - Poor reach, poor defense contribute to this fighter's
identity crisis; why didn't he take up knitting instead? (25-28
ranking)

Clay Pijin - A sitting duck for enemy blows; makes a great body bag
(28-31 ranking)

SPECIALISTS' PROFILES 

Lightning Lewis - A right handed dancer with incredible handspeed/
footwork.  Good stamina and conditioning make him a very strong
contender.

Marvin Meane - This right handed brawler from Detroit eats nails for
breakfast.  He has awesome power and a wicked killer instinct.

Guts Goodbody - After years of training this boxer from Muscle Beach
is the best conditioned fighter on the circuit.

Prettyboy Price - This 24 year old "dodger" from the Bay Area has a
steel jaw and rarely suffers a cut; an opponent will have to work
on the body to bring this contender down.

Lefty Long - A strong left handed brawler, this 29 year old from New
Orleans has a mean uppercut and likes to use it.

Brains Bowery - The smartest boxer on the circuit, Brains knows how
to work the ring, dance in and out, land a punch and protect his body.

Bobbin Brown - Talk about your moving targets, Bobbin loves to bob and
weave, take a shot at his opponent and slip away.

Jethro Hicks - All those years on the farm have paid off with tremendous
power, but this boy is just a tad slow both mentally and physically.

"Slow" Moe Jones - Opponents think he's moving in slow motion, but
they can't afford to become dazed by cerebral movement.  One punch
from this brute can leave you black and blue.

"Bull" Leider - Known for his frequent contributions to NYC blood banks,
this bleeder virtually cuts if you so much as breathe on him.

NEXT FIGHT STRATEGIES

Here, your trainer will give you a scouting report on your next match
and offer some advice.  As you hire better trainers, the advice you
receive will improve.

YOU'VE GOT WHAT IT TAKES, SO TAKE IT TO THE TOP!

I can't make the call 'till you make the call.

BUYING EQUIPMENT

Every boxer starts his career with $100 and earns money as he wins
fights.  Use this money to buy equipment or services that will 
increase your rating points.  For example, each month ballet lessons
will increase your footwork rating slightly.  You can only own 3
pieces of equipment at one time, and no 2 pieces can work on the
same rating.

To buy equipment, SELECT this option at the Trainer Screen, and then
SELECT the item you want to buy from the Classifieds Section of Wide
World of Boxing Magazine.  Note that each piece of equipment is
guaranteed for a certain period of time.  The guarantee period is
how long the rating increase will continue.  Again, in the case of
ballet lessons, your footwork rating will increase each month for
six months, until the guarantee ends for the lessons.  After the
guarantee ends you will retain the points added to your rating.

To return to the Trainer Screen, SELECT Talk To Trainer at the bottom
of the Classified Screen.

CURRENT EQUIPMENT

This option lets you view all the equipment currently in your possession
and the remaining length of the guarantee on each piece.

PERSONAL STATISTICS

This choice lets you view your current statistics, including:

o Personal Boxer Data
o Career Winnings
o Cash on Hand
o Current World Ranking
o Fight Record

SELECT Next Page from the Boxer Data Screen to view your current ratings.
You'll note that the ratings are higher than they were when the boxer
was created.  Trainers and equipment add points to your ratings, and
the points accumulated from fights are parceled out over time, with the
remaining balance shown as Extra Punch and Ring ratings.  Each boxer has
a maximum potential for each rating.  Once a given rating reaches this
maximum it will not climb higher.  Keep track of these ratings 
throughout your career, but be patient - it's a long way to the
championship belt.

To return to the Trainer Screen, SELECT Talk To Trainer.

FIGHTING MODE

The Fighting Mode sets the default for how your boxer will be controlled
during a fight.  This mode automatically defaults to Human unless you
select otherwise.

Human - Human-controlled boxer

Computer - Computer-controlled boxer.  When the computer controls a
boxer it uses a style (brawler, dancer, boxer, dodger) and experience
to determine the boxer's skill and intelligence.

Ask Me - Choice of Human- or Computer-controlled boxers.  Before each
bout the computer will ask you if you would like the boxer to be
human- or computer-controlled.

the month.

If it's human vs. computer or human vs. human, you can SELECT either
Participate In This Bout to fight the match or Continue to skip the
fight - in case the person who controls a boxer in the current match
is not around to fight, and someone else wants to move ahead to fight
their bout for the month.

The game will not move beyond this month's matches until all fights
have been resolved.

RULES OF THE RING

o The number of rounds depends on your boxer's ranking.
o The rounds are 3 minutes long.
o A boxer cannot be saved by the bell.
o There is a 10-point MUST system.  The judges award 10 points to the
  winner of a round and fewer to the loser.
o 3 knockdowns in one round is a technical knockout.
o Depending upon the referee, 3 or 4 cuts stops the fight.
o You have until the count of 10 to get up after a knockdown.

THE JUDGES

Three judges will be chosen at random to score your matches.  Out of the
eight possible judges, all have different criteria for scoring and their
own personal tastes.  Some prefer finesse over brute force, whereas others
favor power over technique.  In addition, judges tend to be swayed by the
hometown crowd, some more than others.

The judges are:

BENNY MARTINEZ: Benny is of Mexican descent and favors quickness and speed.
Technique and points are more important criteria for his judging than
power and domination.  He likes to see a good power punch, and usually
favors the underdog.

BORIS NIKOLENKO: A Russian judge, he likes to see a lot of power punches
and uppercuts.

ARCHIE "BUD" HANEY: Archie is an old timer who looks like he's already
got one foot in the grave.  His scoring is the most erratic and
unpredictable.

JOYCE VELARDO: Joyce is the only female judge, but that doesn't
diminish her appreciation of the sport.  As a matter of fact, she sees
it as a "sport" and places emphasis on points and style, not on power.

EMMET O'BRIEN: An Irish chap who has been a boxing fan for years.  He
tends to favor power over style but is much more balanced than
Nikolenko.

HURRICANE HOLLAND: Hurricane is a former champion.  He took a few too
many shots to the head so he is a little unpredictable.  He favors
power over points.

R.J. "DOC" WALKER: The most scientific judge.  R.J. is a balanced
scorer, and is very fair and predictable, favoring neither power
nor points.

LELAND FARNSWORTH: A "proper" Englishman, he favors points over power
and is moderately predictable.
