Here is a very large amigaguide document listing 438 ZX Spectrum cheats for
various games.

It covers both multiface pokes which can be used with ZXAM and AsP Spectrum
emulators, as well as for original cassettes and lists many multihackers
for Speedlocks, and other turboloaders.

Most of the cheats I typed from Smash Tips, which was a booklet which was
collected with Your Sinclair magazine, the rest I got from other
magazines. Hope somebody finds it useful. The guide is a bit buggy, I
wrote it back in 1997 when I was first getting to grips with Amigaguide
programming.
