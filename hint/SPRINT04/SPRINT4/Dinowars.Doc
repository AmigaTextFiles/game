        Directions for DYNO-WARS by Frank Goepfert


     DYNO-WARS is a two player game based on checkers.
Menus are used to reset or quit the game as well as to turn
the sound on/off. It is forced jump and no illegal moves are
allowed by the computer.  Instead of the customary circle-
type playing piece, a triangular piece is used in its place.
When a king is attained it will be the original color, either
red or black, with an off-color border around it.

     But, it is not the appearance alone which sets DYNO-WARS
apart from checkers. In checkers the object of the game is to
totally wipe out your opponent, DYNO-WARS however has a
scoring system -- the last player left on the board will not
necessarily be the winner.  DYNO-WARS requires more strategy
and thought than checkers does.  Each player has his choice
of 0 to 10 bombs, each of which may be placed at his/her
discretion.  Since scoring is inversely related to the number
of bombs each player chooses, it is important to judge
wisely.  A player with ten bombs is almost certain to be the
last left on the board, but is also doomed to loose by score.

     The mouse is used to select and move pieces.  Bombs are
set by first selecting the piece you desire to move, then
pressing "B".  When the new location for the piece is
selected, a bomb will be left in it's wake.  Even though you
set the bomb it is still as deadly to you as it is to your
opponent.  When a piece lands on a bomb, both are destroyed,
giving the other player points and leaving radioactive waste
in their place.

     Though radioactive waste is not an instant cause of
death, each time a piece lands on one of these waste sights,
the piece's radiation level is incremented by one.  When a
piece's radiation level (RL) reaches three, that piece is
destroyed unless it is a king.  When a king reaches a
radiation level of three, it is demoted to a regular piece
and its radiation level is reset to zero.  Radiation level is
indicated in each player's separate section of the screen by
"RL:".

     DYNO-WARS is a forced jump board game.  If a player has
a jump, DYNO-WARS will not let him make any move other than a
jump. If you would land on a bomb or radiation by taking the jump,
DYNO-WARS will force you to take it just the same. 
If you have more than one jump then you are free to choose which 
jump you'd rather take. 
In the case of multiple jumps DYNO-WARS will automatically reselect
the man you jumped with after the first part of the jump, so all
you have to do is click on the next square you want to move to.
If while having a legal jump, you select a man to move which
has no jump, you may press upper or lower case "e" to unlock
the game and reselect a man.  The same will work if you
select a man to move and simply change your mind. But in
the case of multiple jumps, after the first jump has been
taken the jump must be completed.

     DYNO-WARS has a scoring system which in itself
demands a certain degree of strategy from the players.

Scoring is as follows:

                  DYNO-WARS Scoring System

-------------------------------------------------------------

x=number of bombs+1

-------------------------------------------------------------

Jumps:         (500/x) pts

Kill by bomb:  (300/x) pts

kill or
demotion by
radiation:     (1000/x) pts

-------------------------------------------------------------



     The game ends when one player completely wipes out the
other.  The player left on the board gets a bonus score of
one hundred points per piece left on the board divided by the
number of bombs actually used.

     DYNO-WARS has a "top ten" list which is saved at the end
of each game, provided the top ten scores have been changed.
