Colonization playing tips by Colin Attle.

1.When choosing a skill level remember that everyone will be less friendly and less 
tollerant of your mistakes the higher the skill level,even your king,so think before 
you choose.As to nationality,each has its pros and cons.English produces more 
immigrants thereby more colonists,which cant be a bad thing.French live more 
peacefully with the native indian population,so peacefull times ahead if you choose 
the french.Dutch has a more stable economy,which cant be bad(you will appreciate 
this if you see a certain cargo plummet in price in 5 years).Spanish has a better 
attack bonus on indian villages,which will help if you're after loot.Each one has its 
advantages and disadvantages.Its a close run thing between the english and the 
dutch.The french has no colonists because of immigration at the start and the 
Spanish can only hope to capture at the most 100,000 gold(thats only 100 
points).The best place i've found is south america,lots of place to grow sugar,some 
tobacco which can be turned into proccesed goods.

2.When you meet the native population for the first time go for peace.Dont think 
that just because you've got a soldier you can wipe out an indian village,you might 
be able to but other unarmed colonists will be killed.If you can see a special 
resource square grab it,these can be rare and at the start of a game it never hutrs 
to have ahelping hand.Always lookout for an indian village and if you have an 
unskilled colonists,you can send them there to be trained You dont always get the 
same skill from a village so beware,although dont send criminals there its a waste 
of time.If you can put colonists in the town hall to make bells,and thereby get a 
founding father fairly quickly making sure that your food supply doesnt suffer,if 
you can find a statesman on the dock grab him.jefferson and pocohontas are all 
usefull at the start depending on circumstances with foreign powers and 
indiains.Without a carpenter,a lumber mill is a good building to have for increasing 
hammers and speeding up subsequent building work.Another good building to 
have is a church.Why pay for colonists to come across to your new land when 
they'll come of their own accord?.

3.When you've got you're first colony up and running bring more colonists in and 
put them to work in various jobs.A hardy pioneer is a bonus to have because of 
increased crop production and roads.If you want to trade in furs then Henry hudson  
 is your man to double production of fur trappers.When you feel your first colony 
can sustain itself,build a second not to near to the first,go inland if you want wagon 
trains are very easy to build and dont worry to much about roads you will need to 
have a ship to every port ratio,but i find a ship to 4-5 colonies is ok(a merchantman 
or above).If you want indian land Then Peter Minuit is the fellow you'll want in the 
congress.You can take it by force,but watch out for angry indians.You may feel 
tempted to go out after rumours of lost cities because of been taken by other  
nationalities,dont,they only find them if they are going somewhere else,but be sure 
to have Hernan Cortes if you want to go after them,just have enough money to buy 
a galleon if you find lost treasure.As time passes you will be bound to meet other 
europeans,who will be persuasive to say the least.Hope that you have Benjamin 
Franklin in your congress,thats what.As long as you keep your distance they 
shouldn't bother till about 1580-1590.If you have to pay a fee to keep them out of 
your hair,grin and bear it,if you dont,depending on your difficulty level,you could 
be in for a tough time.

4.Mother england.Hmmmm.When his royal Highness decides to increases your 
taxes,there aint a lot you can do but save just before and hope you get 1-2 
increase in your taxes,or else lose whatever you boycott.You could however chuck 
them into the sea(good job the colonists didn't get taxed for boats!),but then you 
cant trade in them.On the other hand,if you have Peter Stuyvesant you can trade 
with other europeans,and sometimes get a good price(but dont flood them,unles it 
the Dutch)and dont forget Jakob Fugger(what a guy,gives a king memory loss).How 
do you know who you'll get on the docks.You can stop criminals and servants 
coming to the dockside by getting William Brewster in your congress,so that will 
narrow things down a little,but if you're waiting for someone(firebrand 
preacher,Elder Statesman,)you could wait 5 years,you could wait 50.Another good 
thing is to bless colonists as missionaries,they wont be effective as the jesuit ones 
unless Jean de Brebeuf is in your congress,and be sure to have Bartolome de Las 
casas so that you can squeeze a few more points from the game.Also Juan de 
Sepulveda can help to persuade the indians to join your colonies.If you do manage 
to see a soldier on the dockside(yes it does happen!)equip him with horses.He'll be 
better in battles and even if you dont use the horses,put them in a stable to 
breed(how do you know that you're not getting all mares?)If you are desperate,go 
to the royal university and buy a certain profession,If you've got money to burn 
they'll have the matches.                        
           
5.Back at the colonies,by 1600 you should have about 4-5 colonies each with about 
7-8 colonists.Remember about religious unrest back in your homeland.these will 
come to dockside if you've got people in your churches,making your job easier in 
the colonies with more people(actually,its a snowball effect once you've got more 
people there,more will come.Its hard at first but persevere)HINT:-William Penn can 
be of help here.Another good idea in this regard is to build cathedrals,which will 
speed up immigration,and by the way the program lies when it says you need 8 for 
a cathedral,you need 16,how do you remedy the situation,search and you will 
find.How do you increase your colonies quickly i hear you say.Attack other 
europeans cities thats how.Its immoral i know but without this you cannot hope to 
reach a high score.Francis de Corando helps you to highlight exactly where in the 
new world they're hiding otherwise youll lose years looking for them.As well Jan de 
Witt will tell you how many colonies everybody has got,hopefully you've got the 
most,if not put matters right pronto.When negotiating After taking cities of fellow 
europeans,choose peace,dont get cocky and push others around unless you want to 
wake up one morning and see enemy troops outside the city's walls.To trade or not 
to trade with indians is up to your discretion.It brings in money and if you make a 
gift of goods you can calm tension between you and them.The things the indians 
want goes from one thing then back to another,so be ready to find other things to 
trade with.Sieur de La Salle is good to have if things aren't going to well with the 
indian populace or fellow europeans ,having some protection is better than none at 
all.Want to get rid of those enemy frigates and troops nearby your colonies.It can 
happen if a european power wants another power wiped out at a price and offers 
ships and troops to help you,just dont get in too deep or you might lose it all,and 
use Francis Drake and George Washington and Paul Revere to help you if you want 
to start a ruccus.Why do ships take so long to make the crossing to the old 
world.Because you probably haven't got Ferdinand Magellan thats why,with him in 
the congress time will be halved.Also dont forget Hernando de Soto.Timely when 
you miss a colony by 1 or 2 moves.Very helpful.

6.We'll now fast-forward to 1670.By now you should have plenty of colonies and 
everything should be like clockwork(almost).If you haven't built schools by now,do 
it,and get those unskilled colonists a trade.Each time you do this you will gain 2 
points.Not very much you say,but do this plenty of times and you'll be on to a 
winner.This is where the main body of points comes from so dont take it 
lightly.Simon Bolivar is great.Sons of liberty up by 20%.YES PLEASE.You should 
have most of your founding fathers in by now,but dont slacken off on the 
bells,you'll need them to keep all colonies at 100% independant from the home 
country.For that last bit of money,try Adam Smith in your continental congress,and 
you'll get 1&half goods for each raw unit(if only in real life).

7.Well this is it,whats its all been building up to-INDEPENDENCE.Keep all ships out 
of europe and off high seas or theyll be captured.Now the kings troops haven't got 
much experience on the new world terrain,so youve got an advantage here and get 
a bonus when fighting,But the kings troops and cavalry is slightly stronger than you 
so select you terrain wisely.Also dont forget your custom houses which can give a 
little more cash,for some more points or whatever.On the water there's a new 
menace,Man of War,an absolute bruiser of a ship,3 times more powerful than your 
frigate,Heeeeellllpppp.If you can produce enough liberty bells another european 
power will send you Man o Wars,troops and cavalry,phew.The king will try and pull 
an indian tribe in to the fray as well,just to spice things up(isnt that nice)so just 
hope you're on good terms with our native friends.The REF will land at a port thats 
not 100% keen on independence,so you can try and turn things your way a bit by 
lowering independence in a colony,and hoping the kings troops will land 
there.Liberty bells produced after another foreign power has stepped in to help you 
will give a maximum of 100 points.Keep training unskilled colonists a trade,to keep 
those points rolling in,dont let the war completely take over the game.To win you 
need to destroy/capture all cavalry,troops on land,even those which have been 
reduced to colonist staus(even more points).If you dont do this there will always be 
more landings on your coastline.With this done you should win the battle,and now 
the king can kiss your pinky ring.After this sit back and enjoy your victory,you 
deserve it.

Thats about it,hope these tips help you get a better score.This is Freeware.
