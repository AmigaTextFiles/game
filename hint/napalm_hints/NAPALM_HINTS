To upgrade a Light Factory and construct more oil drillers,first you need to

a blue arrow appears then left click to start upgrading a progress bar
shows the extent of upgrading and you should hear"UPGRADE INITIATED"This works
the same way with the Barracks and can be done more than once! but only when you
are on higher tech.levels.YOU ONLY NEED ONE OF THE SAME TYPE OF FACTORY

@NODE "WS02"
to neutralize these mothers destroy the buildings next to them,as the shrapnel
will weaken them so that you can attack with about 9 light tanks:) When you have
rocket launchers approach them from the South East so that you can fire rockets
at them to weaken them b4 attacking with heavy guns.Protect your lone launcher
though.So far up to and including Mission 8 for the Humans the Robot defences
aren't replaced so once destroyed you can wade in.Some news just in these
defences can fire at airborne units as well!!!!

This is a HARD mission (as reported by Simon on #Amiga} and I agree.Firstly the
oil driller will only arrive in ten minutes from NE.just South of the Command
base down a slope is an oil deposit but don't send the oil driller there just
yet.Build a solar powerplant and Refinery and send the oil tanker past an oil
deposit to the East of your base and slightly N out of harms way.If you do not
drill this site first the Robots will claim it first.Back at base make some
preparations for defence by building two cannon nests.If in general you try and
spread your base SE. down the slope towards the oil deposit nearby.At about the
five minte interval you will be attacked but don't be tempted to
build,build,build just yet! save your credits to repair your cannons.Position
your light tank and armoured vehicles in front of your cannons but not out of
their firing range.this will give them some protection.position your bazookers
so that they can protect close quarter combat with your cannons.However be aware
that the robots will destroy your soldiers if they break through.Watch out for
sneak attacks and repel them by using your light tank(it's faster!)By now you
would have realised that the enemy has some mean heavy vehicles and in fact it
has a medium factory which can be upgraded to a heavy factory.This means that
they will throw Medium tanks,Rocket launchers,Tiger tanks and laser tanks
    When your oil driller arrives save the game and send it to the oil next to
its entrance.Do not forget to send the oil tanker to the oil tower as soon as
it's built ;-/.When your first shipment of oil nears your base protect it with
any vehicle which isn't heavily damaged(common sense i know but save your
damaged vehicles by putting them towards the N of your base.Start building a
repair centre to get them repaired.Next try and build a Barracks and light
factory before you add any more cannon nests to protect them.otherwis you will
have nests not being used effectively.keep an eye on that oil tanker if you lose
it you'lll have to wait until you build a research centre and upgrade your
factory to replace it.
    when you there is "no more oil available" manufacture another oil driller
and erect your tower,you've guessed it,near your base.Make sure you send the oil
tanker to the new tower asap. Build cannon defenses next to your Oil tower and
near to prevent incursions and sneak attacks.Everything goes along
swimmingly until you run out of oil again.if an rocket launcher or laser tank
singles out a light tank it is doomed so as soon as its armour is red lined select
it and press "R" to send it to be repaired.
    By now the Robots will be fully charged and seething with rage and want that
oil tower .This is where i am up to now but wait they
have Mobile Bomber(capable of really having your eye out!) now then if only
they'd stop shooting me...Right I have played this level several times nearly
completing it only the once.For me the best way to win seems to be patience
Try and build up defences of cannon nests with a couple of rows of light tanks
surrounding them and any soldiers behind them.If you attack any enemy oil tower
the Robots retaliate in FORCE and you will have to retreat.It's best to sit back
and absorb any punishment they can dish out at your base.At all costs watch your
oil tanker if it gets damaged you may be hindered so repair it when it smokes.
    They keep on coming for your oil but if defended well enough you will almost
wipe out their heavy units.After an hour and twenty minutes or so(depending how
quick you are)You will be tempted to approach the enemy base to the South.Attack
the defense en masse.make sure you have made them form a group so you can send
them back for repair if need be quickly.Next attempt to acquire their refinery
for if you do so you can build cannon nests next to it(he says... as if it's
easy :-))and this is as far as i've got to date... Until now:)))) I have to say
on and off this has taken me 2 weeks but i have completed this mission.When
time=roughly1hr 20min you should be in a position to pester the enemy.Its base
is South of a large spaceship wreck and you will encounter resistance near oil
towers (empty aren't they) but ignore them for now.attack their defences and
regroup and or repair before advancing some more.Your next target should be the
Command base,but the Robots still have full silos and several oil towers so it
takes time but destroy it.next target the medium factory(there is a light one
also).Be aware of rocket launchers and mob them if they attack.the refinery and
silos should be captured for the booty.All should be plane sailing until the
Barracks which has a sting in it's tail.if attacked or approached in the wrong
way it unleashes a stream of foot soldiers who advance on your base(oh are my
defences ok?)

good news i am back and even though i lost some save games i will endeavour
to catch up and advise anyone who needs it @16/7/99 i can give you hints
towards the first 5 robot missions as follows...

this is quite an easy introductory level just send your buggee to scout and
when you spot an enemy send reinforcements and attack en masse.try to use
your flamers to take out bazookers.you should be able to get the first shot
in or even kill the bazooker before he kills you.attack jeeps with
minigunners as they are quick firing and despose of them quickly

there is oil to the se. and nw but they are only half full

@endnode
@node "RobMission 4"
Protect the convoy(arrival in twenty minutes)

there is oil to the east.after 4mins the enemy attacks from the jungle to
the nw.try to block this gap connecting the desert with the jungle.when the
area is secure send a bugee east then south along the southernmost edge to
find oil.send an oil driller and escort of two light tanks and two flamersto
ensure safe passage of the oil driller and later the oil tankers.Position
these units at the midpoint between the trees and southernmost edge of the
jungle
   When you have enough resources block the gap connecting the jungle and
the enemy base to the north.East of the enemy base is another oil patch/well
if you secure this well you can proceed North and atack the enemy from the
rear destroying another well.If you now leave units covering this patch then
the enemy throw themselves at you
   When the convoy appears to the extreme SE of the battlescape allow them
to filter into the nearby trees and then STOP! them.If not they will proceed
on course and be destroyed by cannon nests in the enemy base b4 you have had
chance to neutralise them.cannon nests require about ten lightg tanks to
destroy them efficiently.Try to capture enemy repair centre so you can use
it for your battle worn tanks.As long as your convoy is intact AND you
DESTROY the enemy base you will complete the mission
@endnode

@node "RobMission 5"
You need to capture an informant and destroy the enemy base for this one.
Your base is located to the south of the map and the humans' to the far NE.To
the West of your base is a Ramp down which the humans constantly attack.Firstly
send your oil driller East to find oil.Then build a solar plant and refinery.So
far so good.This oil tower to the east is the only one that is freely available
so you need to go hunting asap.
    Send your armour to the base of the slope and file your soldiers behind them
as soon as you can build a barracks and a technician and assign him to the group
by the slope.Now advance North until you come across an enemy oil tower to the
East.This is your target!
    If you managed to secure this tower build another oil tanker and send them
both to this tower to suck it dry.Send your group back to guard the base
When it is half empty the humans decide they want it back and attack.Now send
your group to the tower and fend them off.By this time u will need a repair
centre and to build more units.
    If you're like me one of your oil tankers would of been destroyed by now but
there is a safer passage for them..
you can either a) build two tunnels and send your tankers through them
or             b) watch the tankers like a hawk and if they get caught then move
them off to the west(in the trees) or down a twisting back way to your base to
the east.If the humans overwhelm you by the captured tower then retreat and
repair as they do not try to claim this oil very quickly.You may have noticed
another well NW of the one you captured but don't touch it ??!!
    As at 16/03/99 i have 14000 credits and have retreated to my base.I have
laid structures to the slope by my base and put three defences there.South of
them is a platoon of light tanks which,as a group,i play hit and run with the
oncoming Marauder tanks.When a marauder attacks my nests and starts to smoke i
close the door with my light tanks and pick them off one by one.If you spot a
rocket launcher attack it like a wolf pack b4 it can fire on your nest.
    Now here's the sly part;-/ You know that original oil tower you had well
build up towards it and put a defense ws02 there to partially protect it.When
the oil in the second tower is exhausted DO NOT destroy it yet if you do the
humans will flatten you to try and get it.instead empty your original
tower,destroy it and send a new oil driller to build a new tower there.after it
is empty destroy it again and wait...Soon enough the humans send an advanced
party and one of their oil drillers,but let them build uninterruptedly.Assuming
your defense is in range of the tower it will automatically fire thereby
draining the humans credits be aware that this is a lengthy process i am talking
2 and a half hours,but to attack their base now is mass suicide.
    To the west of your base build three defenses by that slope.Try and put a
group of 9 light tanks in the gaps of the trees and use the techniques mentioned
above.REPAIR any damaged units or they'll be singled out.Gradually their attacks
subside but watch for sneak attacks.the computer will let you know if the energy
is low on any structure as an insurance.When you need more oil attack that
second tower and carefully shepherd your oil tankers to and fro.If you then
destroy the tower you will bait them out so that some of their units will then
move on and throw themselves at your defenses.
    To attack their base approach and destroy a rocket nest and head north
around the base but don't consider this until the coast is clear.Firstly take
their refinery luverly 6000 credits for me:) then build a new barracks next to
it for more technicians.then take the three silos it took me up to 24k from 2k
credits.By now the humans should be penniless so take out the command base
etc...
@node "RobMission 6"
You have to send a spy to the enemy base.In actual fact it is a technician you
need to send into the enemy command base.This is proving to be a taxing mission
as you only have thirty minutes to complete this task and it just doesn't seem
long enough for me.When you start the Mission there is no near oil patch the
nearest one is around the coast to the NE so immediately send your oil driller
and rocket launchers north as they are slow moving vehicles.When you hear" new
buildings available"start the usual routine of building ie Solar pwer plant the
Refinery at the same time send a buggy ahead to scout for that oil patch.
    My tactics are that you send all initial units to the SE of the oil well you
will notice that the enemy attack you from the south so try and form a two rows
of units to block their exit.If you do not they will sweep around and attack
your unguarded base.send the bugees East of this oil to find another patch.The
Humans are trying to gain possession of it and may have already done so.if
they haven't you will need to keep sending units South of the second patch to
guard it until it is needed.Incidentally this is the only other exit the Humans
have from their base.Eventually you can build a medium factory which will allow
you to build medium tanks and rocket launchers.Remember to dismantle units which
are weaker and replace them with harder options.Build two more oil tankers to
speed up the production rate.When you hear "no more oil available from the first
tower send your tankers to the location of the second.ENSURE that your line of
defence SE of that first tower is forcing your tankers to pass behind it ie send
it south a bit if it is not.
    Now you need to keep amassing forces south of the second tower and advance
South eventually your forces will come into range of the human cannon
nests.there are three of them just west of them is the Radar and command base
the command base is guarded by another cannon and lots of heavier units swarm at
you I am sure someone has finished this level if they have any better tactics
please feel free to spill the beans.If you manage to weaken the command base
enough send in a technician (good luck)
@endnode
@node "RobMission 7"
destroy the human's research center.
There is oil available to the West and further away to the NE of your mobile
CV.The enemy base is NW up a path which swings East and finally North until
it reaches the Mid entrance to the base.Try to carefully ammass forces on
this path and move them quickly towards the enemy base.The laser tank is a
fast firing beast and appears to have slightly more range than the Tiger
tank and has more armour so it may be best positioned nearer to the enemy than the tiger to
catch them with a volley sooner.The enemy research is well defended by a
rocket nest and a few canon nests which will need removing before you can
enter the center.position a wall of forces stopping any enemy coming out
of their base from the south,there is another exit to the East but the heavy 
factory is nearer to the southern one.Build a tunnel just nearby.Importanly
because of the distances covered in getting to the enemy research center you
will need a transporter to carry a couple of saboteurs to destroy it.To ake saboteurs you will need to upgrade the barracks twice.
   Block off the way towards the eastern entrance of the human's base
and start to send forces north.You will come across two oil towers,but their
oil is depleted so pass them by if possible.There is a rocket nest up here
and can easily be taken out by positioning a couple to the top right
   to head towards the research center you will need to enter the base and turn south then east past the entrance to their heavy factory.here you
will encounter harsh resistance so be prepared!further to the west are silos
and the center itself

@endnode
@node "RobMission 8"
In this mission you are required to destroy everything and this is where
things start to get a little tricky.Obviously you will need to make room and
send your oil driller west until you find oil.Just South of this oil is a
way into your base,which is used by the humans and must be blocked off.There
are three main ways into your base from which the humans attack,but start
with the southern one.try and build towards this gap and block it off with
say a heavy fatory and a nuclear power plant.Obviously you will need to have
a couple of rows of friendlies paving the way infront of your
structures.then put up four staggered defenses.In my strategy this
completely seals off access to my base for both sides,but you could always
put a lone unit in place of one defense but run the risk of it moving or
being compromised.The next plan is to search ahead for more oil and this can
be found to the East of your base and then south.if you send a couple of
bugees and lght tanks you will come across three oil patches; the first is
half full the second three-quarters full and the third is full so head for
that one and build there first if you can.Keep sending forces to this
position to watch over your supply lines.WARNING!!! you will come under
heavy fire so send lots of armour here!You will essentially need a tunnel
behind your units at this location due to the long distance back to be
repaired.
   For the gap to the west i sent many forces here,destroyed the first
well and built a tunnel there.then i sent a mobile cv to the site to block off 
gap with a new comm.center with two defenses in front of it(Again
completely sealed off.Now unless your lines are breached the only way in and
out of your base is using tunnels,or the entrance by the three oil deposits
to the east.I chose not not seal off this part....
   As long as you keep refreshing your frontline units try and move
south from that western approach .laser tanks are very useful here as there
is a special factory nearby throwing out sioux helicopters so put them on
the front row.Don't forget to send saboteurs to take out buildings which are
difficult to destroy.
   The enemy base is situated in the se corner of the map and you will
need to negotiate several canon/rocket nests.If you take out the power
plants,in theory,enemy rejuvenation should slow down.When attacks towards
the three oil wells cease then move those forces west to attack human defenses and take out the silos
@endnode
@node "RobMission 9"
You have to destroy the enemy oil towers,BUT,not all of them!If you find the
pyramid on the surface of the desert there are five oil wells south of it
and one to the east of it which need destroying to win.I find the best way
is to send a transporter with saboteurs to the well,destroy it and then
claim the remaining oil with an oil driller.
   When you begin there is oil to the immediate south.but also send
units to the east to guard another oil patch.Laser tanks seem to have a
problem in targetting sioux from below so if the 'copter is south of a
building send the tank north of it and then it can fire.Between the oil to
the east and your base is a path south with a full well.This well is one of
the six you need to complete the mission and that direction is the one to
follow to the other 4 to the south of the pyramid.
   The humans have a habit of sneaking into your base by copter from
the north and past the pyramid through the trees.I placed two ws01 defenses
between the trees and the pyramid and a couple of tiger tanks and rocket
launcher behind them.When you can build an antigrav factory construct about
9 antigrav an use them to ambush oil tankers.Watch out for rocket launchers
though.

@node "RobMission 12"
Well this is were i decided a couple of pics may be in order.You are given
an oil well and simply need a solar plant and refinery to make use of
it.Basically you are attacked from the NE and SE and so need to block these
points and eventually build defenses to protect them.To the NE i recommend a
ws01 and to SE a couple of ws03 try and place your units behind
the buildings to the NE as the ws01 can hurt you.From the very beginning you
can start to deplete the Humans' energy supply by looking for a rapid fire
nest to the north of your confines and attacking it with a rocket
launcher.Really try to position your units inside your base perimeter ready
to fire upon approaching enemy without hurting each other don't put your
heavy weapons in a block or they will trip over each other.Take the enemy
oil well NE of your base but not b4 producing a mobile cv. which you should
deploy north of this well,applying a ws01 on the SE corner only when there
is enough power.when you have the cosmic center produce a spy plane to give
a complete map of the battlefield.If you produce giant antigrav you can
finish off the mission easily
@endnode
@node "RobMission 13"
I have noticed that when you start the Mission it is called Mission 14 and
not 13*DUH*.Before you start this mission make sure that you have the
crimsoncrisis patch from clickbooms portal or you cannot finish it.This
mission appears hard as you start to run out of oil quite quickly.The enemy
can gain access to your base from the north and SE.They have a tendency to
attack your barracks with Sioux so send a laser tank near to it.generally
keep an eye on your base to watch for sneak sioux attacks.Artillery are a bi
your defences,they can destroy ws02 and ws01 easily with one shot if you do
not keep your defences repaired.When you start running out of oil send a
saboteur and oil driller to that well NE.there is also another well SW,but
to utilise this efficiently you will need a mobile cv so you can place
defenses nearby.A mobile cv. is obtained by upgrading the light factory i
beleive.i shall try to provide .gif of my ase etc to aid ppl.when placing
ws01 place them all alone.the reason for this is that if triple tanks come
right next to them and there are two ws01 they may destroy each
other.Eventually the constant attacks wil cease and this is the right time
to produce {"thunderbolt" link "thunderbolt"}.to take out enemy derfences.The oil wellsx2 to the NE
of the map are full so take these first b4 other wells.The enemy silos are
full so take them with technicians and be careful with the thunderbolts
around them they have a nasty habit of destroying stuff.

I may have found a bug on Mission 4 of the Robots.I cannot finish This level and
it is not through bad Strategy.In this mission you are to protect a convoy which
arrives in twenty minutes.Despite playing the game several times and,protecting
the convoy trucks and jeep without damage or loss,the jeep will not leave the
screen so that the Mission is complete.I will keep you informed of my progress
on this one
    *CORRECTION*Apparently the Human's base needs to be destroyed as well but
it doesn't say so in the mission briefing and it doesn't matter if the jeep is
destroyed

@node "worth it?"
If you are deciding to capture an enemy Refinery or Oil tower for example,check
how full it is first.It is a senseless waste of human or robot lives to attack
if they are empty you may as well capture a full one.As you may have realised by
now you can tell by the row of dots below the building's energy bar.
@endnode
@node "tips"
RUN AWAY AS FAST AS YOU CAN!!... oh hang on,that's not it.
1)Watch your back.When you are busy pummelling the stuffing out of the enemy
they will sneak up to any vulnerable structure and attack.
2)Try not to let your oil tankers be destroyed stop them if you need to and move
them to a refinery later.
3)The robots are oil crazy so let them come to you unless you have a mobile cv
and can build defences around an isolated oil tower.
4)The computer AI is high not only do individual units defend themselves when
ordered to attack,but the enemy knows how to find weaknesses.It will atack
weakened units to destroy them and concentrate fire on an annoying structure
5)The Robots will not build on top of you to replace a destroyed building so you
can occupy it's space
6)When you want to attack a building with several units make sure you give them
a group number so that you can quickly press a function key to send them away
from the building when it is destroyed.Do not approach the smouldering heaps in
a hurry(especially oil towers and defences)
7)factories produce vehicles which are specific ie you cannot build a medium
factory and produce all the units you can in a light factory you have to upgrade
each type of factory.eg oil tankers can only be built in upgraded light
factories.
8)When the enemy singles out one of your units in front of your main wall of
defence move your unit back this makes the enemy advance and easy pickings for
bazookers.
9)Only order your unitsto destroy a structure once as the second time takes the
to witin point blank range of explosion when the building blows.

Up until (3/3/99) I have been trying several strategies to complete mission
5 on the side of the Humans and i have noticed a weakness of the Robots.They
apparently like oil a bit and go mad when they don't get a fix.So you can rely
on them coming to you and plan defences.When you have "no more oil available"
from a tower destroy it by forcing your units to attack it.If you replace the
tower with a new one you can get about 3 tankers of oil out of it you may only
get about one tanker full if you repeat this process.

@node "Cheyenne"
As you may have guessed this is my favourite unit.You need a Special factory
which is upgraded to produce these.They have powerful rockets and are fast
moving they are extremely useful for picking off say antigrav which are out of
range of your defences but are happily firing upon your base.also they can be
used in hunter/killer raids tackling predator,plasmer and other annoying units
before they have any chance to fire a shot on your expensive defences.They are
vulnerable to @{"laser tanks" link "laser tank"},rocket launchers,Bram and
antigrav so they must be watched frequently incase a unit attacks your Cheyenne
when your not looking.Another use for these helicopters is to "close the door on
groups of units" which attack en masse.If say a Bram,rocket launcher,laser tank
and a couple of antigrav decide to pummel a rapid fire nest let them but attack
their rearmost unit once they have selected their targets,obvious may be but can
help if you are limited to surviving on low funds.this way you should be able to

your first shot advance one position to finish him off.
    Send the jeep NE to scout for the enemy base and pull it back to the trees
west of the base.Now send the rest of your group to the jeeps location.Form a
group out of your infantry and jeep as this will be your main force.Send a
bazooker to the NW and SW of the enemy base and gradually send each closer.soon
they will spot flamers if you are lucky you can take them out without loss if
not send the main force ti finish them off.make sure you don't leave the force
next to the base as the robots will now advance.now pull those bazookers back to

repel it.Re-position afterwards or you'll lose the bazookers.Eventually their

@node "HumMission 3"
Ah well now i've just retried this mission and not completed it.This i think is
because i tried to capture some enemy buildings and not simply destroy them.But
i may be wrong :(
    Here are some tips to get you going on this mission anyway...
Build a solar power plant,then a refinery,barracks and light factory.Also build
more power plants and a RADAR! The Radar is essential for picking out enemy
sneak attacks,without it you will be taken by surprise.Leave about 3 armoured
vehicles and protect them with Bazookers behind them at your base.At this level
you cannot upgrade your barracks or light factory as you cannot build a research
centre.
    The main object(as in all missions) is to starve the enemy of oil.The
simplest way would seem to be to attack and destroy its oil towers,but as you
will have noticed it will send oil drillers etc to get this back.On this level
you are in luck because the Robot's only have one Refinery.This is situated to
the SE. If you can mass vehicles and bazookers near the entrance to the Refinery
you can prevent any oil tankers from unloading.This is not easy as the Robots
have a significant amount of credits already and send tanks at you.Keep
pumelling the refinery replacing and reinforcing your forces.Eventually with
enough bazookers the refinery will blow.Now attack the command base and or
silos.The rest is history.Above all persevere it will take time to deplete its
reserves
@endnode
@node "HumMission 6"
"Destroy all oil towers"
You start this mission off with 3000 credits and you can find oil to the SW.
    Your Medium factory cannot be upgraded on this mission.Oil can be observed
SW and East of your base,but the oil to the East is already occupied by enemy
forces so it needs to be attacked first.Blockade your SE. entrance.
    It apears that some of the oil towers are fake.If your Technicians cannot
seem to capture oil towers send them as close to the Northern most point of them
and then send them into the structure to capture it.
The oil towers which must be destroyed are North,East and North East.Once these
are destroyed then you win!.
@endnode
@node "Tunnels"
Have you noticed that when you move your cursor over the Tunnels that they are
all "Tunnel entrances"?.The reason for this is to be able to select the exit you
need.Once you have sent a Tunnel CV unit to the required entrance/exit and
deployed it you need to LMB twice to hear "Primary set".This means that the
Primary exit has been set.If you want to send vehicles back for repair then set
the Tunnel entrance near your base as "Primary".You can have many
entrances/exits
    In addition to this you don't have to wait for the ability to build a tunnel
via the command base options.all you need to do is build two tunnel cv's send
one to your required exit and one to the entrance you want.Oviosly there is a
catch and that is the cost.A tunnel costs 480 credits and a tunnel cv costs 720

The enemy base is to the SE.There is a lot of oil scattered about but you shoul

just wade in and hope for the best,Keep to the diagonal approach ie approach
from SW,NW,NE,SE and you can launch rockets at it to destroy it.

Survive for ten minutes then destroy the base.You start off with 5800 credits
find oil to the north.To the south is a bottleneck to send your first wave of
units to stop enemy entering your base.Below and right of the bottleneck isan
oil tower.Napalm launchers would be useful for this but you will need to upgrade
your medium factory to be able to do so.The Robots have a refinery and lots of
silos seperated from their main base and are the obvious first target.However
they are defended by Nests which respawn(the first time i have noticed this)
@endnode
@node "HumMission 9"
You can build a "Special factory" which at this level enables you to produce
Sioux helicopters.Protect the South and West of your base with Rocket
launchers.These are required to down antigrav craft whose laser can be very
destructive.Antigravs are fast and are best attacked whilst hovering.three sioux
helicopters make short work of them.Don't forget you have oil to the North.
    The enemy base is split into two sections to the West and South west and
most of its oil is pumped from the far SW,so attack the oil first then the
Command base etc.Take the refinery near the base and build new oil towers over
the enemys so your oil tankers can ship oil to this refinery.
    At the junction where you can head towards the oil or enemy base build a
tunnel entrance so you can send units quickly to the front.
@endnode
@node "HumMission 10"
This is the Robot's second line of defence.Just before 3min antigrav attack from
the South as well as Threelers so put a couple of Rocket nests to the South of
your base.Wtch out for Plasmer as they are very destructive.Take the oil to the
NW.first and the oil to the South second.The robot's have an oil tower further
south than that patch to the S but protects it with antigrav so send rocket
launchers to neutralize them.The heavy factory can produce triple tanks and
artillery.Towards the end of the mission try to capture the silos one after
another until your credits stop increasing then destroy the rest.

- build the oil tower     (o)
- build a solar powerplant  (s)
- build a refinery          (r)
- build cannon nests until you have no money left (t)

The my base looked as this: Command Centre (c)

                rr ccc
                   ccc  t

                t t t t t
                 t t t t

I sent the bazookers to defend the oil tower until it's dry.
I placed the other units in the gaps between the cannons.
Place them wisely, i.e. make sure you have a rocket or ion launcher
on each side to defend against air units. When you finished placing
all the units and cannons then always have the Cheyenne selected
and use it to attack all Antigravs and all heavy units that can't
attack an air unit (like Predator).
I finished the mission with still 7 cannons, 5 vehicles and the Cheyenne
left.

Yes 11 is a toughie. The secret i found was to try
to protect your oil well as much as possible with a few units on the left
while fending off the attacks from the right.The most important thing is to
build the radar outpost as you can then build a couple of rocket nests and
a rapid fire nest to protect your buildings. stay with it and leave a
little money to keep up the strength of the nests. After a while the robots
run out of money and the attacks become less frequent then you can wander
off and go for the kill.

good luck!

    From the word go send the oil driller to the North West to build an Oil
tower.Also send the two bazookers and the infantryman north of this tower just
b4 the trees.Immediately build a Solar plant and refinery as quick as they are
available.At the same time organise your forces like so...

Whilst all this is going on send the Cheyene West until it tracks a Mobile
bomber.Destroy the bomber as we don't want any nasty suprises.At this time you
may also see a Robot oil driller so destroy it if you have the time
Set the 'copter to a group and withdraw it immediately the bomber explodes.
    When the Refinery is built start building a radar outpost.When built start
building a rapid fire nest.I found that these nests are tough and can take a
good pounding from the enemy @{"Plasmer" link "Plasmer"} as well as being able to take down
Antigrav.The Rocket Nests seem to be singled out and won't last long.The Cannon
nests cannot defend themselves against antigrav.
    If you arrange your units like so you will survive but only just.Be prepared
to break formation to gang up on a Bram vehicle or dodge the dangerous
@{"Predator" link "Predator"}
tanks.Before you can place your first Rapid fire nest Two Bram,a Plasmer and a
Predator or two show you what kinds of forces you will encounter during the 15
minutes,thankfully the Brams will not appear in such forces again,however one
will attack from the West later.Your Cheyenne crew is going to need eyes in the
back of its head.This sole unit will mean the difference between success or
failure.The most important fact is if you lose both oil tankers b4 the well is
empty you are napalmed(couldn't say doomed in this game:))so you basically need
to keep an eye on the West first and foremost to protect your tankers then the
South of your base,followed by the East
    Keep that Cheyenne busy and learn when you can disengage it to select
another target.You need to do this to conserve every morsel of credits you have
by stopping your reserves being wasted on repairs If you attack slightly above
the horizon at your maximum range you will find that the cheyenne delivers 5
quick firing rockets but basically keep it at the limit of its firing rangeIf
the Cheyenne is singled out then retreat it for later!You may notice lone
antigravs penetrating your perimeter without being harmed and this is the job
for your 'copter.Remember to keep your 'copter busy all the time
    @6 mins to go i lost my Cheyenne put its downhill from there and if you
managed to conserve some credits then you are laughing.the enemy's intensity of
attack will diminish now until you win

@node "HumMission 12"
Wait ten minutes for a secret agent to be airlifted in then send him into enemy
base in twenty minutes.This first time limit of ten minutes was just about right
for me :).At the start you only have access to one oil patch and this is SE of
base
immediately send the oil driller,the two triple tanks and ion launcher to the
trees and when you spot the oil order driller to build there.In the meantime
build a Solar power plant east of your base followed by a refinery east of
that.Send the two bazookers to the northern edge of your base by the cliff as if
any antigrav sneak through you can bring them down.You may want to build a
nuclear power plant at this time and then a barracks east of the refinery.If you
build a radar outpost stick a rocket nest by it and a rapid fire nest or two
south of it.Remember the first part of the mission you need to build an
Aerospace centre to receive your agent.You need to build a light factory,medium
factory and special factory first.If you feel the need to order a supply ship
make sure its arrival does not coincide with your agents' ship or it will not
land!
     When you upgrade that special factory it  allows Cheyenne to be built.
Sioux 'copters are useless at this level.Build one and send it NE across the
water, Hmmm a luvverly Tropical island,not.swarming with tinheads.Heavily
guarded but beatable! this is where the Command base is located.You may need to
destroy your barracks and replace it with a research centre nnd also i recommend
replacing the light factory with a repair facility(once you have built an xtra
oil driller).Send that Cheyenne to the west Coast of the Island and attack the
nearest Silo to the shore.Build more Cheyenne,4 will do,to help you to do
this.Once accomplished there is a defense with a couple of bram behind it
This is how To take out the @{"bram" link "BRAM"}Basically try to clear away as
many defences as possible to the West,North And South of the base.
     To get your agent to this enemy base you will need a Transporter
helicopter.This can be built if you upgrade that Special factory twice.just send
your agent into it after the copter has landed and to send him out wait until
the 'copter has landed and left click on it.Keep pounding the base and its
defences with your Cheyenne but don't destroy the base of course.position your
transporter near to the shore but beware of bram and rocket launchers
approaching the shoreline to attack your Cheyenne.When time is almost up send
your transporter to the western edge of the base and wait for it to land as you
drop off the agent use the 'copters as decoys constantly flying them over any
defenses which could harm your agent.He should with any luck enter the base into
the NE corner.The base stayed brown but the glorious "mission completed" will be
heard
@endnode
@node "HumMission 13"
Much like Robots level 4 where you need to protect the convoy.You don't need to
destroy the base though;/Your first oil can be found far to the north.Send an
oil driller an ion launcher and bazooker to guard the oil tower you are going to
build.Notice that to the West is a clearing in the Jungle and the nearby enemy
base. Build towards this clearing and when you can build defenses eg, three
rapid fire nests and a rocket nest.It's up to you which defences you prefer,but
i think the rapid fire ones are best.Very near to your new oil tower to the
North are the two robot oil towers.Send your ion launcher to attack this as well
as a triple tank and artillery when you have built your defencesnear that
clearing to the west.If your sneaky you can stick a rapid fire nest in range of
the Robots' heavy factory so it will constantly deplete their energy as will the
units attacking the towers to the north in order to get Bastard tanks you will
need to upgrade your heavy factory twice IIRC.After twenty minutes the convoy
arrives from the SE corner of the battlefield.Move each convoy truck to the East
side of your base and make them stop! if you just move them they will default to
there destination and roll towards the enemy guns.
     The enemy Base is built in a narrow passage from North to South.To the
North of this passage are two oil refineries capture one for loads of credits
and a nearer place to accomodate oil tankers from the two towers to the NE of it.Now
the Enemy command base is Right/middle of this strip and protected by defense
ws01,the beam firing defence.The land juts out If you take out the defense with
a Bastard tank from this place you can then bombard the base without trawling
through the whole base-A piece of cake:)Your convoy wants to head NW off the
battlefield but its exit is guarded by a lonely turret which needs taking out
.once the path is cleared of defences you can send your convoy on its merry way
by simply moving it anywhere

You need to survive for one hour*gulp* this time.the clock is counting down
You already have an Aerospace center and plenty of power.Send one of your oil
drillers East with some protection.Build a refinery as close to the oil tower as
possible to enable defences to protect it when built.This oil is about the only
oil you have until late in the game!Then build a radar outpost and start putting
up rapid fire and rocket nests strategically around your base.At the asame time
order a supply ship because initially you will need all the firepower you can
muster.do not be tempted to move your forces away from your base and its
defences as they will be lost hopelessly.make us of the Cheyenne and make sure
they are repaired when heavily damaged.Don't put your Bastard tanks on the front
line but a couple of rows back to act as a hammer if enemy forces come too close
Antigrav will try to deplete your energy by hiding behind the small clump of
trees just south of your base so take them out with a çheyenne.As long as you
manage to keep your Cheyenne healthy you should survive.
     If you're after points then you can attack the enemy base but leave this
until the enemy stop coming.As usual when your oil is depleted build another
tower and when that is depleted lleave it.the robots are drawn to it like moths
to a lamp.If they manage to build a tower there you can deplete their reserves
by puttting a rapid fire nest or two in range of it.SE of your base is a robot
tower and you can slow down their onslaught by interrupting their supply of oil
taking out as many tankers as you can.The Robots are wise to this sooner or
later.just hang in there until the clock turns to zero.Don't be tempted to
build,build ,build  as you will not have enough energy to keep your defences in
healthy state.

nearly there.unfortunately you only have 30 mins.in which to destroy
everything and it's a tall order.first of all the oil is far east and you
will need to send your oil driller there asap. as the robots are sending one
at the same time.send support including ion launcher,threeler and rocket
launcher or your well WILL be attacked and destroyed.You may now realise
that antigrav are dangerous and insidious.leave an ion launcher near their
prefered attack target,probably the com.center or radar.Eventually place
a rapid fire nest there for a more permanent defence.the most important fact
is to build rapid fire nests surrounding your base before deciding to build
the barracks,light factory etc.When you can build build East towards your
well.You will run out of oil and the easiest capature is south of your base
destroy it with a Bastard tank and build with an oil driller.You will need
to defend this position with a couple of triple tanks and ion launchers
especially as the robots' have an antigrav factory nearby.
	The enemy have two Command centers,one is in the extreme top left
corner of the map.The other is South West.You will find that the enemy base
is divided into four sections and you are best assigning a Bastard tank to
each to destroy the remaining buildings.
If you succeed then part of the final message reads....

use them as a last line of defence guarding my base.They can be squashed by
medium and heavy units.Under no circumstances let them attack enemy buildings if
it's about to blow as they will be shredded by the shrapnel.

@node "NPALMlaunch"
Ha ha this is what we've been playing for.These are awesome but slow and need
protection.They can single handedly destroy buildings but there destruction can
affect close allies especially soldiers.These launchers are more suited to long
range shots and seem to be able to fire as far as rocket launchers
@endnode
@node "Sioux"
Vulnerable towards rocket launchers and defence WS02.They are fairly fast and
only safe against antigrav if in groups of 4-6.Their strength lies in speed and
destructiveness.
@endnode
@node "WS01"
These can annihilate your forces.You can atack them from N,E,S,W but not always
successfully. it is best that a half dozen helicopters take them out quickly and
without damage.They are very destructive but dangerous to your friends and
family.You will need to position them on the outskirts of your bases
perimeter,as they damage or destroy anything in their beam and will do more
harm than good in between buildings.Two side by side can destroy
rocket launchers and medium tanks with one shot but not always.There is a
mistake in the manual despite what it says ws01 cannot fire on aircraft
If you place a ws01 too close to buildings when it discharges it takes
damage

@node "CAPTURE"
To capture enemy buildings...
1)Send a formidable force including engineers or technicians close to the
entrance of the structure(if possible).Flamers/grenadiers/bazookers all cause a
lot of damage to buildings but are vulnerable to attack especially wehn moving
to the front line.
2)Arrange your force so that the NW in close proximity to the required structure
is clear and place a technician or engineer there.Otherwise your units may kill
him with friendly fire.
3)Attack the structure until its energy bar is in the red then send your man in
as close to the structure as possible with the animated cursor.
4)if the structure is not repaired send your man into the structure when you
have the two green cursor arrows showing over it."building captured"

@node "AUTOMAN"
As far as i am aware you cannot automatically produce new units from the
barracks or factories,However you can order a certain amount to be built one
after the other.For starters make sure you have enough power.Then click on the
unit you want to produce.then hit the RMB the number of units less one you want
to produce.

@node "triple tanks"
triple tanks have greater velocity than ion launchers and are therefore
quicker to attack and move to far off places so prefer them to ion
launchers when sending out heavy scouting parties
@endnode
@node "antiantigrav"
have you ever noticed that when enemy forces approach your bases sometimes
they halt and an antigrav hovers over the top of them?well if the antigrav
is shot down it drops vertically onto any unit below it causing severe or
critical damage to that unit
@endnode
@node "napalm strike"
this is particularly effective.I managed to destroy a heavy factory with
this as the plane makes three passes over its target and is very accurate

It came to my attention that someone was stuck on the humans mission 4 so i have decided
to include my way of completing this mission.Hopefully it will be "take 
over the enemy radar":)There is oil NW but as you can see it is only 
about a quarter full so you will have to put priority into building another oil driller
Arrange your forces so that you have one group west of your oil tower and another to the south east
as it is from these directions that the robots come send one unit NE to dscover 
the location of another oil patch.On this level you can only upgrade the barracks and 
light factory once but if you upgrade the barracks you will get pyro units which can 
effectively destroy oil towers if guarded by light tanks.When you have the dosh 
send about three light tanks West to where the forest meets the desert.
SW of this join are two rocky outcrops SE of the southernmost one is a well that you should capture
	Send your two engineers West straight into the thick of the trees through
the gap.Then slowly send them south towards the well.The other well,slightly SE
of your second well will be empty by the time you come to capture it so switch tactics.
	Now send a force,with pyro,south and then Eastinto the enemy base.You may conflict 
with the Robots but eventually you should have enough firepower there to blow the well
(assuming you keep making fresh units)Always leave a force defending your
freshly claimed towers.As you can see the towers are all only about one quarter 
full.	
	Once these two new oil towers are established start massing for an
attack on the Robots base.Use half a dozen tanks,4 bazooker and a couple of pyros to destroy 
the com.center then destroy the light factory followed by the barracks.Once there is no opposition
weaken the radar outpost and send in an engineer to capture it.
