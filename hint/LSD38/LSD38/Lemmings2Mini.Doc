      MINI DOCS (YOU WANT THE TRIBES STORY - YOU TYPE EM!)


LOADING
AMIGA
PUT DISK 1 IN THE INTERNAL DRIVE.  PUT DISKS 2/3 IN EXTERNAL DRIVES IF
AVAILABLE.
LEMMINGS 2 WILL NOW LOAD.
IF ONLY ONE DRIVE IS USED, FOLLOW ON SCREEN DISK-SWAPPING PROMPTS.



OBJECTIVE
BY NOW, YOULL PROBABLE VE AWARE OF THE HORRIBLE PLIGHT THE LEMMINGS FACE.  NOT
ONLY DO THEY HAVE TO LEAVE THEIR LOVELY HOMES FOR GOOD, BUT THEY ALSO HAVE TO
ESCAPE THEIR ISLAND BEFORE THEY PERISH IN THE DARKNESS THATS COMING.  MUST BE
ONE OF THOSE DAYS.



YOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO SAVE AS MANY LEMMINGS AS POSSIBLE FROM EACH TRIBE AND HELP
THEM ESCAPE THE ISLAND, ALTHOUGH IF YOU`VE ALREADY READ THE STOREY AND DECIDED
THAT SOME OF THE LEMMINGS ARE A LITTLE TOO SELF-CENTRED TO BE GIVEN A PLACE ON
THE ARK, DONT WORRY, WE QUITE UNDERSTAND.



LEMMING ISLAND IS MADE UP OF 12 LANDS, EACH HOLDING A PIECE OF THE TALISMAN AND
CONTAINOING A TRIBE OF LEMMINGS WITH A DISTINCT, ER,  CULTURE.  YOU MUST GUIDE
AT LEAST ONE LEMMING FROM EACH TRIBE THROUGH 10 LEVELS.  THAT WAY AS YOU
PROGRESS EACH TRIBES PIECE OF THE TALISMAN WILL BE TAKEN TO THE ARK WHICH, WHEN
JOINED TO THE REMAINING ELEVEN PIECES, WILL FORM THE COMPLETE TALISMAN AND
ALLOW THE TRIBES TO ESCAPE.  BUT BE WARNED, ONLYT THE NUMBER OF LEMMINGS
RESCUED ON LEVEL 1 WILL PROGRESS TO LEVEL 2!!



BRONZE, SILVER, OR GOLD TALISMAN
THRE NUMBER OF LEMMINGS SAVED TROUGHOUT THE TRIBE DETERMINES WHAT TYPE OF
TALISMA PIECE (BRONZE, SILVER, GOLD) THE PLAYER IS AWARDED.  IF THE TRIBE IS
SAVED WITH ONLY A FEW LEMMINGS REMAINING, THEN ONLY A BRONZE IS AWARDED.  IF
THE TRIBE IS SAVED WITH SUPERB PLAYING THEN A GOLD IS AWARDED.  SILVER COMES
BETWEEN THE TWO.  AFTER PLAYING EACH LEVEL, YOU ARE AWARDED A MEDAL WHICH
INDICATES WHETHER YOU ARE ON COURSE FOR A GOLD, SILVER OR BRONZE PIECE.  THE
ULTIMATE ACCOLADE IS TO HAVE A GOLD PIECE OF TALISMAN FOR EVERY TRIBE.  GOOD
LUCK!!
