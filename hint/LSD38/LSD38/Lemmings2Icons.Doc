WIND SKILLS


BALLOONER:

RISING.  A BALLOONER CANT BE CHANGED TO ANYTHING ELSE UNLESS THE BALLOON
BURSTS.

MAGIC CARPETS FLOAT ABOVE THE GROUND AND ADJUST THEIR HEIGHT TO FOLLOW THE
TERRAIN. IF THEY GO OVER THE EDGE OF A CLIFF THEY WILL SINK DOWNWARDS UNTIL
THEY SETTLE AGAIN.  THEY ONLY CHANGE BACK WHEN THEY HIT SOMETHING.


JET PACK:
JET PACKERS FLOAT ABOVE THE GROUND AND ONLY MOVE WITH THE AID OF THE FAN. 
THERE IS A TIME LIMIT FOR THE JET PACK FUEL OF ABOUT 10 SECONDS.


TWISTER:
TWISTERS SPIN ROUND VERY QUICKLY AND STAY ON ONE SPOT.  WHEN THE FAN IS USED
THEY CAN BE BLOWN INTO THE GROUND WHERE THEY SPIN DOWNWARDS LEAVING A TUNNEL
BEHIND THEM.  IF THEY ARE BLOWN OFF THE GROUND THEY WILL STOP BEING A TWISTER.


SURFER: 
A LEMMING WHOS DROWNING OR SWIMMING CAN BE TURNED INTO A SURFER AND WILL ONLY
MOVE BY USING THE FAN.  A SURFER WILL AUTOMATICALLY JUMP OFF HIS SURFBOARD WHEN
HE HITS THE EDGE OF THE WATER.


PARACHUTER:
A PARACHUTER FLOATS DOWNWARD AND CAN BE BLOWN HORIZONTALLY WITH THE FAN AS HE
DESCENDS.  THIS IS A PERMANENT SKILL.


HANG GLIDER:
A HANG GLIDER WILL SAIL DOWNWARDS AT AN ANGLE UNTIL HE HITS THE GROUND AND CANT
BE CHANGED INTO ANYTHING ELSE WHILST STILL HANG GLIDING.


ICARUS WINGS:
LEMMINGS WITH WINGS FLY HORIZONTALLY UNTIL THEY ENCOUNTER AN OBSTACLE AND CAN
BE BLOWN IN ANY DIRECTION BY THE FAN.

HE CARRIES ON DOING HIS STUFF FOR FIVE SECONDS BEFORE EXPLODING.  ANY LEMMING
CAN BE CHANGED INTO THIS.


BOMBER:
WILL LAY DOWN A BOMB AT HIS FEET.  THE BOMB WILL THEN EXPLODE LEAVING A CRATER
IN THE LANDSCAPE.  THE LEMMING SURVIVES THE EXPLOSION.



BUILDING SKILLS:
FILLER:

GROUND AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.  IT HARDENS WHEN IT COMES TO REST.  HE CANT BE
INTERRUPTED WHEN HES POURING.

ALTHOUGH HE WILL STOP IF HE HITS AN OBSTACLE OR WALL.


SAND POURER:

ONCE THEYVE STARTED.


GLUE POURER:
SIMILAR TO A FILLER BUT WITH ONE MAJOR DIFFERENCE.  THE CEMENT FROM A FILLER
THATS POURED WILL DRIP DOWN THROUGH A HOLE, BUT GLUE FROM A GLUE POURER WILL
NOT.  GLUE WILL STOP WHEN IT REACHES THE UNDERSIDE.



SHOOTING SKILLS:
ARCHER:
ONE CLICK FOR A LEMMING TO LOAD HIS BOW.  MOVING THE CURSOR WILL MAKE THE
ARCHER AIM AT THAT POINT, AND THE LEFT MOUSE BUTTON WILL MAKE HIM FIRE THE
ARROW WHICH WILL STICK IN THE LANDSCAPE.  THE DISTANCE FROM BOW TO CURSOR
DETERMINES THE POWER OF THE SHOT.


THROWER:
THROWS A ROCK WHICH STICKS TO THE LANDSCAPE.  HE THROWS IT A BIGGER DISTANCE IF
HE WAS A RUNNER TO BEGIN WITH.


BAZOOKA:
FIRES A SHELL IN AN ARC ACROSS THE LANDSCAPE.  WHEN THE SHELL LANDS, IT BLOWS

MOVEMENT SKILLS:
WALKER:
STANDARD LEMMING.  DAWDLES ACROSS THE LANDSCAPE, BUT CANT CROSS ANY OBSTACLES
THAT ARE TOO STEEP.


RUNNER:
MOVES FASTER THAN A WALKER.  WHEN A RUNNER IS MADE INTO A JUMPER, HE JUMPS
FURTHER THAN IF HE WAS A WALKER.  THIS IS A PERMANENT SKILL.


JUMPER:
JUMPS ONCE WHEN IT IS CLICKED.  DISTANCE OF JUMP DEPENDS ON WHETHER THE LEMMING
WAS WALKER, OR RUNNER WHEN SELECTED.


HOPPER:
HOPS UNTIL HE HITS AN OBSTACLE OR IS GIVEN ANOTHER SKILL.  CAN ONLY BE CHANGED
WHEN HE IS ON THE GROUND.


SKATER:
CERTAIN AREAS OF ICE CAUSE LEMMINGS TO SLIP AND FALL OVER.  SKATERS CAN
OVERCOME THIS PROBLEM BY STAYING UPRIGHT AND SKATING OVER THE GROUND.  THIS IS
A PERMANENT SKILL.


KAYAKER:
CAN CROSS WATER USING A KAYAK.  CAN ONLY BE SELECTED WHEN THE LEMMING IS IN THE
WATER.  HE THEN MOVES ACROSS THE WATER AND STOPS WHEN HE REACHES LAND.


SWIMMER:
SWIMS THROUGH THE WATER AND CLIMBS OUT OF IT.  THIS IS A PERMANENT SKILL. 
WHENEVER HE ENCOUNTERS WATER HE WILL SWIM, NO MATTER WHAT HE DOES IN BETWEEN
SWIMS.


ROLLER:
ROLL ACROSS THE LANDSCAPE.  THEY CAN BUILD UP SPEED AND TAKE OFF INTO THE AIR
IF THERES A RAMP, ALLOWING THEM TO CROSS GAPS.  CAN BE CHANGED TO ANOTHER

RAMPS TO CLEAR GAPS.


POLE VAULTER:
LIFTS HIMSELF INTO THE AIR WITH A POLE AFTER A SHORT RUN.  IF THE POLE TOUCHES
AN OBSTACLE, THEN THE ATTEMPT FAILS.


SLIDER:
LIKE A CLIMBER IN REVERSE.  WHEN HE COMES TO AN EDGE HE WILL FLIP OVER AND
SLIDE DOWN AS LONG AS IT IS A VERTICLE SURFACE.  IF A SLIDER DROPS OFF ONTO THE
GROUND, HE WILL MOVE THE OPPOSITE WAY THAT HE WAS FACING ORIGINALLY.  WHEN HE
COMES TO A DROP, HE WILL HANG THERE FOR A SECOND, GIVING THE CHANCE TO CHANGE
HIM INTO A SHIMMIER.  THIS IS A PERMANENT SKILL.


ROCK CLIMBER:
CAN SCALE VERTICLE SURFACES, AND ALSO GET AROUND OVERHANGS OF UP TO 45 DEGREES.
 THIS IS A PERMANENT SKILL.


SHIMMIER:
WILL JUMP INTO THE AIR, AND TRY TO GRAB ONTO A CEILING.  HE THEN SHIMMIES ALONG
THE CEILING FOR AS LONG AS POSSIBLE.  IF HE RUNS OUT OF ROOF THEN HE STAYS
THERE FOR A SECOND ALLOWING FOR A CHANGE OF SKILL.


DIVER:
TAKES A PLUNGE OFF CLIFFS.


ATTRACTOR:
MAKES THE LEMMING PLAY MUSIC AND CAUSE OTHER LEMMINGS CLOSE BY TO STOP AND
DANCE.


FLOATER:

PERMANENT SKILL.
