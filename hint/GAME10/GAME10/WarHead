BASIC CONTROLS:-
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
THE MOUSE:-
            Mouse operates in two modes.
As a conventional mouse pointer,or as the spacecraft yoke.

1 - As a mouse,there is a circular crosshair resembling a gunsight serving as
the on screen mouse pointer.Moving the mouse moves the pointer - pressing the
left button selects whatever is being pointed at. The mouse pointer is centred
on the screen before mouse operations.

2 - As a yoke,the movements of the mouse control the rolling and pitching of
the vessel.
As a yoke the left mouse button operates the ships main engines,giving 6.3Gs
of forward thrust.The right button operates 1g retrothruster.

KEY CONTROLS:-
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The keys are bunched into sections...Numerical keys(not on keypad) select
autopilots.

Alphabetic keys select screens and modifiers...Function keys launch weapons.

F - 	forward view (through windscreen,looking forward).For most of the 
                game this screen is the default. It shows the forward view 
                of the foe-57 pilot looking from the front of his craft.
                This display may be modified as follows:-
H - 	headup display (toggle on/off).
		The headup display is superimposed on the outside view.
                A crosshair appears at the centre of the display and flecks 
                which represent fixed spatial points in the outside world 
                permitting the pilot to visually understand his velocity.
W - 	weapons headup (toggle on/off).
		The weapons display is another layer of headup.A graphical 
                repesentation of the ship showing the position and number of
                remaining weapons appears.
		The crosshair is modified to also show weapons and mdc ammo.
		Identification tags appear on any vessels visible.
Z - 	zoom in
X - 	zoom out
		These keys alter the magnification of the forward-view image.
T - 	tactical screen
		The ship's computer knows the position and orientation of 
                every vessel in the surrounding space.Therefore it is 
                possible for it to generate a  Real-time image of space from
                any vantage point.Including (not surprisingly)
		The vantage point of the front of our own ship.Pressing 't' 
                initially does just that.It brings up the computer generated
                view of space from the front of	your foe-57.Planets are not 
                shown.Like screen 'f',the weapon display can be	toggled on 
                or off and the zoom keys still work.The headup flecks cannot
                be removed.

Unlike screen 'f' this image is generated by the ship's computer and can
therefore be presented looking from any arbitary vantage point.
Enter - (on the numeric keypad) will alter that vantage point.What it will 
do is give the image from the nose of any other object or vessel.Repeated
pressing of 'enter' will cycle through all objects in the vicinity.You can
see what the space station sees - see what an attacking alien sees or even
look out from an asteroid or the nose of a missile. If the object you are
viewing from 'dies' in the course of viewing from it - then the screen will
flash and the next object will be selected.The technical term for the object-
you-are-viewing-from is the eye-partical.

The computer has another way of depicting space around the vessel.Pressing
't' again from within the tactical screen will bring up the tank screen.
At the centre of the screen is the token representing the eye-partical.
Space around the vessel is shown as a sphere of points - other vessels are
shown as tokens.As the eye-partical rotates the ship at the centre appears
to stay still but the sphere around it rotates.'Enter' still works, allowing
any ship to become the eye-partical.

A zoomed-in view of the eye-partical ship is shown in the centre of the 
circle at the bottom left of the screen.

The z and x keys work in this screen but in a slightly different manner.
Bringing the sphere closer and further away. The tank-screen enables the 
pilot to have an overview of three-dimensional space.

The tactical screen and the forward screen both feature annunciators.These
flashing mnemonics are superimposed on the display to inform the pilot of
some matter. 

ANNUNCIATORS:-
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
PWS - MEANING PROCEED WITH SORTIE
NOR - MEANING NEW ORDERS RECEIVED
ICM - MEANING INCOMING MISSILE 
FMO - MEANING FRESH MESSAGE OUTSTANDING

NOR and FMO both prompt the pilot to consult the message screen. In fact, 
close examination of some annunciators will reveal a small letter m. This 
is to suggest to the pilot that he consults the message-display screen.

Pressing the m key ...M - brings up the message screen.

Message screen (read orders and incoming messages).

The message screen is shock-mounted electoluminescent display mounted beneath
the main viewing screen.Its purpose is to display incoming messages - both
from solbase and from other vessels.

D - data on other vessels

The D screen brings up a menu of names of all known vessels.As we learn about
our alien adversaries this list grows to include them.Pointing and clicking
on any of these will bring up a technical description sheet of that vessel.

N - navigational starchart

this navigational screen shows a 3-dimensional representation of all of the 
known star systems around the earth's sun. A flashing blue highlight indicates
our present position.The mouse pointer can be used to select any of the 
control buttons to manipulate the screen.

Clicking on any star will select it.

Selecting a star - will track this screen onto that star - such that it now
appears at the centre of the screen.Selecting a star has the effect of 
locking it into the navigational computer - hence making it the destination
of any future quad-jump.

There is another way to select a desired star: by name.Pressing the space-bar
brings up a small dialogue box.Typing the name - or the first part of the 
name - followed by return will select the named star, exactly as if the star
were clicked upon.

Text at the bottom of this screen shows present location and selected 
destination.

S - solar system chart.

This is the other complementary half of the navig screen,permitting fine
destination control.

Pressing 's' will display the solar system of the navig screen selected star.
If no such star has been selected - then the solar system shown will be the
current one.

This screen displays the planets and their orbits.Satellites(moons) and their
orbits are also shown.Because of the hugh difference in scales, this screen
dynamically alters scale.

Selecting any body makes it the destination for the quad-jump.


NAVIGATIONAL CONTROLS:-
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The fist-of-earth interstellar attack craft is piloted, employing a fly-by-
wire system.All the pilot has to fly is the computer - the computer flies
the ship. The ship may operate a selection of automatic pilot options.Some
offer full manual control whilst others are fully automatic - permitting
the pilot to attend other tasks.Experienced pilots employing manual modes
will be able to out-perform the computer on basic manoeuvres.

The mouse-yoke controls the rotational movement of the vessel. Left-right
movement proportionally determines the roll.Up-down controls pitching.
There is no direct yaw control.

The mouse buttons activate primary and retro-thruster,this way the vessel
either accelerates exactly along the forward axis or accelerates along the
reverse axis.Pilots of terrestrial aircraft are often disoriented when first
flying a spacecraft. There is no necessity for a spacecraft to point in the
direction of motion. Often in combat it is advantageous to be travelling in
one direction and pointing the weapons in another.

The piloting computer has ten operation modes which the pilot may select,
depending upon the circumstances.

Numerical keys(not those on the keypad)select different piloting modes
(autopilots):

                             ORIENTATION/THRUST

MODE 4)                         COMPUTER/COMPUTER

0.RE-CENTRE YOKE 

Mode 4 is most important when trying to establish an exact position.It
simulates an inertialess movement system where the ship only moves when under
thrust and stops instantly. Only low velocity movement is possible in this 
mode.This mode cannot be entered unless the ship is stationary.

L - when in the solbase launch bay.This key initiaties the launch sequence.

Q - quad jump

This key initiaties the quadspace jump to the selected location.This will not
operate in the launch bay. If quad space motors are not attached, this key 
will not effect a quad jump.

Esc - launch the pilot recovery vehicle. If the explosive bolts have been 
primed,this key will fire the cockpit and primary life support pod out of the
nose of the ship and hopefully to safety. The micro-quad leaper pack will
automatically return the pod back to solbase. The intelligence division have
insisted that an abandoned ship be destroyed to prevent it from getting into
enemy hands - so this proceedure will also initiate the self-destruct
sequence in the fusion system.


WEAPONS SYSTEMS:-
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There is provision for five classes of weapon aboard the vessel. Each class 
is tied to a separate launch circuit. Each launched weapon may have an
independent target.


WEAPON SYSTEMS OVERLAY:-
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The W key - in tactical or forward screens brings up the display from the 
weapon system computer.The display shows number and type of weapons remaining
as well as their position on the hull pylons. This display also shows 
possible targets known to the system. Target tokens appear as green boxes and
are placed over possible targets. Symbols - within the boxes aid identi-
fication of the target type:
If a vessel is overlaid with a gunsight symbol,then that is the current 
primary selected target.

The primary target.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To select a new primary target, point the ship at a new vessel and press the 
space bar.

When a weapon is launched - the current primary target is what that weapon
will be attempting to destroy.

Skilled pilots will be able to rapidly launch 3 missiles at 3 different 
vessels by targetting,firing and rapidly re-targetting and re-firing. Once a
weapon is launched it cannot be recalled or re-targetted.

FUNCTION KEYS LAUNCH WEAPONS:-
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
F1 - LAUNCH PSEUDO-STELLAR MISSILE

F2 - LAUNCH STINGER MISSILE

F3 - LAUNCH DATA GATHERING PROBE

F4 - LAUNCH MINE

F5 - LAUNCH X-RAY LASER MINE

Missiles are launched at any selected target.Missiles are piloted like
mini-spacecraft. They take time to orient themselves and fly a path to their
targets. When launched they are accelerated forwards by mini-thrusters. It 
may take some seconds for the missile to orient itself towards their chosen 
path before their main thrusters are ignited. It is therefore useful but not
essential to launch a missile in the direction it wants to go. Missiles can 
be even launched at other missiles.

Each vessel class is unique.Some vessels are heavily armoured and can only be
destroyed with the appropriate weapon.

Pseudo-stellar missiles are the most powerful and the most dangerous.Not only
will they destroy the target vessel but will also destroy any other vessel
within the kill-radius including the vessel which fired it. If you fired-off
one of these - get well away.

Stinger missiles are general purpose missiles and are indentical in most 
respects to the ship-to-ship missiles used by the alien forces.

The probe or reconnaissance missile simply gathers data on its target. On 
impact, it deep-scans the target and relays the data back to the ship. Once
scanned in this way the examined vehicle will appear in the data-screen.

RETURN FIRE MDC:-
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The mdc or mass-driver cannon provides limited anti-missile fire,as such it 
is classified as an entirely defensive weapon. It fires iron slugs at high-
kinetic energies which vaporize any small targets. Beam and particle weapons
have proved ineffective for this task.Effective use of this weapon demands
that the pilot attempts evasive manoeuvres before trying to shoot down a
missile.

GAME OPERATION:-
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The game starts with the pilot sitting inside the FOE-57 which is docked in
one of the four launch bays of solbase.

Solbase is rotating to provide artificial gravity. Text on the headup display
prompts the player to raed the message screen. This can be viewed by pressing
the `m' key.After the orders have been received - the player can launch the
craft. It is launched by dropping out of the bottom of the launchbay.If 
weaponry is loaded onboard - then the ordinance screen appears, showing the 
weapons as they are laoded. Once in space - the yoke controls motion. Pilot 
mode 1 is selected by default.The player can tumble the craft around and 
view the large solbase structure rotating. A series of four blue-flashing
navig markers indicate the solbase docking axis.

Solbase is in a polar orbit around the sun,some 90 million miles out. Turn
on the headup-display to see movement queues.Turn weapon systems on and off.
Accelerate the creaft up to blue speed (the headup queues turn blue to 
indicate a higher speed).Use autopilot 9 to stop the craft. Practice stopping
and turning. This is not an aircraft! Turning without acceleration does not
result in a change in velocity! The `s' key brings up the solar system chart.
The mouse now operates a cursor. Clicking on the buttons results in rotation
or zooming. Clicking on a planet causes the planet to be selected as a quad 
space destination.The name of selected planets appears on the screen.The 
screen tracks so as to place the selected planet in the centre of the 
display.The `n' key brings up the star navigation screen.This permits the 
selection of other star systems as destinations. The present selected
destination is shown flashing. The `m' key brings up the message screen.
This is the pilot's way of receiving text information from the outside world.
Ignoring the messages will result in game penalties being incurred.

DOCKING:-
~~~~~~~~~
Docking with solbase is not difficult but demands patience and attention to
detail.So pay attention.Dynamic magnetic buffers prevent slight inaccuracies
from damaging the ship or solbase. It is important that the ship is on the
precise axis and moving precisely along it. The orientation of the ship is 
unimportant. There is an easy way to dock. There are four flashing navig 
markers which indicate the exact docking axis of solbase.The outermost of
these is important. For some people it helps if they select it as primary 
target.That way it is always marked with a cross and is harder to lose.
