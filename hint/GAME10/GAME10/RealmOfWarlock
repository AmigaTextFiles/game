   Ashton, now a desolate place ruled by the strongest, was once a land of
tranquility and peace. Before the region was seized, several wise elders
controled the land. One elder was selected by his peers from each kingdom,
and together they guided the nation. The elders met at each change of
season and carefully planned what was to be done throughout the next phase.
Using peace and tranquility as guides, Ashton flourished and its people
were all untroubled. As Ashton matured, word of its prosperity spread
thoughout the world, and many came to ponder this glorious land.
   One year, as winter set in, the elders of Ashton all gathered in the
town of Fairshire. The meeting began and the doors of their hall blew open
and the room filled with smoke. When the cloud vanished, a mysterious
scroll remained. Zandar, the wisest of the Elders, opened the scroll and
quietly read the contents of the paper. It demanded that the people of
Ashton erect a palace for a new leader and for all the elders to resign
their positions immediately. There was also a small crest burned into the
scroll which Zandar recognized as an ancient symbol of the black arts. The
elders, although concerned, ignored the demands of the parchment and
claimed that the forces of good would always prevail.
   At the next seasonal change, the Elders again travelled to Fairshire.
When they were seated in the hall, the doors again blew open and smoke
filled the room. When the smoke cleared, however, the room was completely
empty.
   Without the wisdom of the Elders, Ashton quickly became troubled. The
strong took control, and greed and ignorance became commonplace. You alone
decide to search the hall in which the Elders were last seen, and come
across the mysterious scroll. Upon opening it you notice, that the black
symbol has a faint glow surrounding it. You touch the symbol with your
finger and the room around you transforms into some sort of laboratory.
   Now, it is up to you to exorcise this wasteland, and return the elders
to Ashton.

and what happened as a result.

   To move around, just type the direction you want to go. Direction can be
abbreviated: North to N, South to S, West to W, East to E, or use the arrow
keys for directions, North (up arrow key), South (down arrow key), East

several examples that might help in the story.
>TAKE THE BOOK

SHIFT 5 (FIVE) UP ARROWS would move you five rooms to NORTH if the moves

For example:
