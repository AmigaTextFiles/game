                        ===============

A Programmer's Plea
-------------------

  DungeonMap is shareware.  If you find this program useful, please send $ to:

      Bill Elliot
      727 94 Ave SW.,
      Calgary, Alberta
      T2V 0X8

  Some suggested amounts are as follows:

       $5 - You like the software
      $10 - You like the software, and would like a copy of the next upgrade.
      $25 - You like the software, and would like a copy of the next upgrade
            and a copy of the source.

      If outside Canada and the US, and are choosing the $10 or $25 option,
      please add an extra $4 for the extra international postage & handling.

  Even if you think that DungeonMap is terrible, I would appreciate a letter 
  giving me CONSTRUCTIVE ideas on how I can improve it.

  Please promote the shareware system by making a contribution to the authors
  of the shareware products you commonly use.  There are many advantages to
  the shareware system:

      -- You can receive quality programs at a decent price.  Had this been
         a commercial program, you could expect to pay at least $19.95.

      -- You can thoroughly examine a shareware program before reimbursing
         the author.  Once you've purchased a commercial program, however,
         you're stuck with it.

      -- You promote the creation of a number of exciting and diverse
         programs that would otherwise not reach the public if commercial
         marketing was the only alternative.

  Along with your $, please send your name, address, and the version number
  of DungeonMap that you are currently using.  This can be found by displaying
  the Information requester located in the Program menu.

Software Requirements
---------------------

  This software was written and tested on AmigaDos versions 1.3 and 2.0. So
  it should run on most machines. It has not been tested with ENFORCER, as I
  don't have an MMU (If any one does test it with ENFORCER and finds a 
  problem, please drop me a note and tell me).

  DungeonMap uses the REQ.LIBRARY. Since I hate getting shareware software
  that requires some special library and does not include it, I have included
  the library and a routine to install the library for those that don't have
  REQ.LIBRARY. Future releases may not need this library, as I intend to
  convert over to use the new ASL.LIBRARY of AmigaDos 2.0.

Using DungeonMap
----------------

  DungeonMap is intended to be used as an aid to Dungeon Masters (DM's) © TSR
  for creating dungeons for use in Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (AD&D) © TSR.
  But, you can use it for what ever you like.

  The legend says "Door" and "Arch". But, these can be interpreted any way you
  please (Eg. Door's could be locked or secret doors, and Arch's could be open
  or unlocked doors). Just use your imagination. For the most part the program
  is self explanitory.  I'll just cover some of the more subtle points/features.

  Loading Saved Maps...
  
    DungeonMap will first look for a directory (in what ever directory you
    ran DungeonMap from) called DungeonMapData.  If DungeonMapData is found 
    DungeonMap will display the files in this directory. Otherwise, it will
    display the files in the current directory. NOTE: All files saved by
    DungeonMap are forced to have a suffix of ".DAT". Therefore, only files
    ending in ".DAT" are  displayed.  This helps save some time scrolling 
    through other unrelated files.

    As the dungeon data is loaded, messages are displayed in the drag bar
    after every 100 nodes are loaded.  This gives you some idea of what is 
    happening during those long loads (Eg. a 1400 node map).

  Saving Maps...

    The same proceedure as above is used for selecting which directory to
    display files from.  But, this selection process is only for the first
    save or load.  The requester will keep the directory you may change it
    to (at least till you quite the program).

  Choosing a Map format...

    This allows you to chose the style of map to generate. You can chose a
    dungeon style that is irregular in shape. Or, you can create a town, which
    is rectangular, and where you can control the straightness of the roads
    (among other things).

  Creating new Dungeons...

    This is really what your here for.  You will be presented with a 
    requester which asks how for the size of dungeon to create and how you
    want it created. (IE. What proportion of the exits will be OPEN, WALLS,
    DOORS, and ARCHS).  Just a warning on size.  I would not try anything 
    larger than say 2000 nodes.  Even this will take a fairly long time.

    If you get tired of waiting for the dungeon to be completed, or you feel
    enough dungeon has been created, then the process can be stopped.  Just
    select the "NEW MAP" option again.  You will notice that while creating
    a map the "NEW MAP" option will read "STOP MAP".

    Here are a couple of the messages you wll see displayed in the drag bar,
    while the Map is being created. They, and their meanings are as follows:

      "Creating dungeon of xxx nodes. yyy nodes created."

      This is just a progress report saying that xxx nodes of the requested
      yyy nodes have been created. You will also see the dungeon being drawn as
      it is created.

      "No undefined exits. Choosing a new start point for dungeon generation..."

      If there are no more undefined exits, a new one is created, at random,
      on one of the outside edges. Then the dungeon creation will continue from
      there.

  Editing the Dungeon...

    Just click the mouse close to a wall, door, arch, or opening to change it
    to the item selected under menu item "Change to". The selection process
    looks at each node like it had a diagonal cross through it, and selects
    the exit from the node that it is in. This is easier to visualize with a
    picture. So....
    
                  Exit
               +--------+
               |\      /|
               | \    / | <------- Entire square is a node on the map.
               |  \  /  |
         Exit  |   \/   |  Exit
               |   /\   |
               |  /  \  |
               | /    \ |
               |/      \|
               +--------+
                  Exit

    If you try to create an exit on an undefined node, the node will be made
    defined (IE, turned grey).  If this was an accident and you want the node
    to be undefined (IE. white), then just select "Change to - Undefined" and
    click the mouse anywhere on the node.

    A future zoom option will make this easier to edit.

  Creating new Towns...

    The requester will ask for the width and height of the maze. These values
    must be an odd number. The maximums are calculated based on the amount of
    overscan you are using.

    Then there are 3 controls for steets. The straightness must be between 1
    and 99%. Te straighter the streets must be the slower the town creation
    will be. The other 2 street controls (Start at wall, & Start at courts)
    control where the streets begin, and how many there are. The limits on
    these values vary depending on the size of the town (the larger the town
    the more streets there can be). If you ask for too many the program will
    let you know.

    The final 2 controls control the number of Gates into the town there will
    be (upper limit is less than or equal to the number of streets starting at
    the wall), and the number of unused cells in the town (eg. pillar, rock,
    etc). Again these are limited based on the size of the town.

    The generation of a town can be stoped in the same way as with the dungeon
    map creation (select STOP MAP). But, this option is only checked between
    major steps of the town creation (IE. it may not be as quick to respond).
    In a future release I'll probably make this more responsive. But, it wll
    probably slow down the creation of the town.

    I would very much like to thank Kent Paul Dolan for presenting his
    algorithm for creating a town map in his program TownMaze.

  Editing the Town...

    Editing towns is easier than dungeons. The cells contain only one object
    (a wall, open space, or door). There is no need to select a specific 
    portion of a cell. The entire cell is changed to the selected type.

  Choosing the size of the print...

    There are 2 sizes or formats for printing the maps. The first I call
    "Fixed Size Cell", has all maps regardless of size having each cell
    printed the same size. The second format is called "Max Cell Size". This
    prints the map as large as will fit on the paper (paper size is controled
    via Preferences).

  Printing the map...
  
    While the dungeon map is being printed, you sometimes want to cancel the
    printout.  This could be because you chose the option by accident or
    because it is taking too long (due to the print density chosen).  Well,
    this is no problem.  While a dungeon is printing the print option will
    read "STOP PRINT".  Just select this option again and the print will be
    stopped.  This should happen immediately.  The only output that should 
    still be printed is just what is already in the printers internal buffer.

    The maps (dungeons & towns) are all printed in the background. So, while
    it is being printed, you can continue with loading, or creating new maps.

    The printing controls for DungeonMap are all controlled via your 
    preferences (set through Workbench). Note: that B/W gives a much better
    print out over grey scale, and that density 2 is usually good enough.

  Displaying the legend...

    The legend is an option, that when selected, will display a small window.
    This legend window can be moved to anywhere on the screen, so you can
    keep it out of your way. It will not be printed if it is displayed.

  Exiting from DungeonMap...
  
    If you are printing, creating a new map, or haven't saved your most
    recent creation/change, them you will be told this, and asked what you
    wish to do about it.  I believe in graceful exits.
