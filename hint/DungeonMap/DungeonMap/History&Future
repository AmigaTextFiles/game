                        DungeonMap V1.1
                        ===============

Future Plans for DungeonMap
---------------------------

  I have a lot I would like to do with DungeonMap.  The following are a few
  of my ideas and a rough grouping of them into releases.  This is only
  tentative.  So if you would like to see an option sooner, or have any
  other ideas, just drop me a note and I'll see what I can do.
  
  V1.0
    - First release with dungeons only..

  V1.1 
    - Creation of town type mazes with streets, buildings, and town squares.
    - Allow background printing of one maze while the next is being created.
    - Improved the speed and quality of the creation method.
    - Added a title to the printout.
    - Allowed for 2 types of printout (Fixed cell size, and maximum cell size)
    - Automatically adjust window size to your overscan settings.
    - Moved the legend into an optional window to make more room for drawing.
    - Some internal restructuring to ease future additions.
    - The format of the saved dungeon files, has been changed. DungeonMap will
      still read version 1.0 format dungeon files. But, it will save them in
      the new format. To avoid future problems, please load and save all files
      you may have created using DungeonMap V1.0.
    - The default data directory was changed from "DATA" to "DungeonMapData".
      There were just too many programs looking for DATA.
    - The auto-centre option, and the centre edit command no longer modify the
      actual map data. It only modifies how the map is displayed.
    - Program now contains a version string. So you can find the version of
      DungeonMap by typing "VERSION DungeonMap".

    - This will be the last version which will save or print without 
      registering. I don't like doing this. But, not enough registrations
      are being sent in. To those who did, my heart felt thanx. You will notice
      some of your ideas were added to the list

  V2.0
    - This version forward will REQUIRE ADOS 2.04 or higher.
    - Convert to ADos 2.0 ASL.LIBRARY from REQ.LIBRARY.
    - Convert appearance to conform to 2.0 look and feel. Some of this will
         be done throughout the prior releases. But, this will be a complete
         review to ensure it conforms to the Amiga Style Guide.
    - Allow the random creation and editing of encounters in dungeons & towns.
         These encounter decriptions will be able to be specified by the user
         & the user will be able to specify a maximum number of occurances in
         the map.

  V2.1
    - Create Icons for data files, and allow starting of DungeonMap from the
         data file Icon.
    - Save the configuration options in the program Icon.
    - Allow for mazes which are larger than a single screen. This will 
         require the ability to scroll the maze on the screen.
    - Add a zoom feature to enlarge sections of the map.

  V2.2
    - Add ability to lay down a series of walls, instead of single wall cells.
    - Add ability to insert previously designed mazes or maze portions.
    - Maybe, add ability to have roaming monsters, to simulate random 
      encounters.
    - Additional ideas that people may request.



Another Way to Contact Me + An Ad
---------------------------------

  I am also on the Amiga Users of Calgary (AMUC) bulletin board on a fairly
  regular basis. This is the first BBS to use the full power of the Amiga's
  ability to multitask.  Some of it's features are:
  
      - It has a mouse and pull-down menu driven interface.
      - A 2.0 look and feel.
      - Can download, upload, read your messages, take part in an on-line
        conference ALL AT THE SAME TIME.
      - While a file is downloading, and you see another file you want, you
        can just add it to the list to be downloaded.
      - There are already 2 offline readers available for it, with the
        ability to do offline responding.
        
  You can use a regular ASCI terminal package to access the BBS initially to
  get a copy of the special required terminal package. This term package is
  what gives all the above features. Just look for a file called "TERMnn.LZH".
  The most current version, as of this writing, is TERM92.LZH.
