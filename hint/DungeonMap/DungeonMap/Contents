This little tool will create maps of dungeons and towns which  can be used by
a Dungeon Master (DM's) © TSR for use in a Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) © TSR
game. These maps can then be saved, edited, and printed. This is version 1.1,
an update to the version on FF 603.  But, there are more versions coming (See
documentation).

This library is being submitted to the Fred Fish collection. So remember you
saw it here first.

PS. If anyone with an MMU on their machine would like to test this with the
    ENFORCER, please do, and let me know the results.
