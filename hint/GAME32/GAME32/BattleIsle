                        ***********************

     BATTLE ISLE by Ubi-soft is a one or two player war game. Unfortunately
it has eluded most players on how to play against the computer. I'm sure it
is buried somewhere in the long documentation file. The game defaults to a
two player mode.
     Select OPTIONS with the mouse to get to the options screen. Click on the
word FIRST. That is the first level of the two-player codes. Type in CONRA
or code for any other game level that you wish to play. The select EXIT to
play the game.
