NOTE: The tricks to Football director 2 is to be very careful with the
clubs money and build up a good youth team.  Try and rely on your Youth
team for new players by only buying very occasionally from other clubs.

WARNING: The levels in the game are supposed to move if you buy a far too
good a player for your division.  Try to work out a system to stay on the
easy level with a reasonably good team (It is possible).

End.
