	BLUE MOON is a 2 player dogfight-game. Both players are controlled
by joystick, you turn the spaceship by pulling your joy left or right,
accelerate forward by pulling forward and backwards by pulling backwards.
I suppose you can figure out yourself what the firebutton is good for.

	Beside theese very normal functions, BLUE MOON have a few other
features like :

1)	Gadgets (Power and Beam) - Theese give the players a chance of
	"repairing" their ships, and get new beams.. (The round one with
	the ZAP on it is extra beams, and the triangle with the "P" is
	extra power.)

	There's a special way of picking up theese gadgets :

	Beam :
	- When the gadget first appear, it is just the round plate
	- The first time it is touched by one of the 2 players, a yellow
	  ZAP appears on it.
	- Next time it is touched, it turns either RED or BLUE 
	  (depending the ship that hit it (Blue ship -> Blue zap,
	  Red ship -> Red zap )).
	- Now the zap is either RED or BLUE, if the same ship hits
	  it again, it picks up the gadget (F.ex. the RED ship hits RED ZAP)
	  If the other ships hits it, the gadget turns yellow again.

	The reason for this strange "PICK-UP-SEQUENCE", is that it adds a
	lot of fun to the game, fighting about theese gadgets.

2)	Asteroids - Small rocks moving from right to left at different
	speeds and positions, able of hitting both players.

3)	Gravity - Pulls both ships and asteroids down.

4)	Borders
