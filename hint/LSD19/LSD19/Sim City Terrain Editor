                        SIM CITY TERRAIN EDITOR
                        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ABOUT THE TERRAIN EDITOR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
THE TERRAIN EDITOR HAS TWO MAIN MODES OF OPERATION;A MODIFIED RANDOM TERRAIN
GENERATOR AND A TILE BY TILE PAINTING MODE WITH A SMOOTHING FUNCTION.

THE MODIFIED RANDOM TERRAIN GENERATOR IS LIKE THE ONE BUILT INTO SIM CITY,
BUT WITH SLIDER CONTROLS THAT LET YOU CONTROL:THE SIZE AND AMOUNT OF TREE
GROUPS,THE AMOUNT OF LAKES,AND THE WINDINESS OF RIVERS.YOU CAN ALSO SELECT
BETWEEN THREE MAJOR TYPES OF TERRAIN: WOOD,RIVER,AND ISLANDS.IN PAINT MODE,
YOU START WITH 10 MILES BY 10 MILES AREA,AND TILE BY TILE PLACE TREES,WATER,
BOATPATHS,AND BARE LAND.THEN YOU CAN PERFORM A SMOOTHING FUNCTION TO GIVE
THE FOREST EDGES AND COASTLINE A MORE "REALISTIC" LOOK.
THESE TWO MODES CAN BE USED TOGETHER: GENERATE A TERRAIN WITH THE PROPER
AMOUNT OF TREES,LAKES,RIVERS,ETC..,THEN ENTER PAINT MODE AND "FINE TUNE" YOUR
TERRAIN.
IN ADDITION TO GENERATING NEW TERRAINS,THE TERRAIN EDITOR ALLOWS YOU TO
MODIFY THE TERRAIN OF YOUR EXISTING CITIES.ADD AND REMOVE TREES AND WATER TO
OR FROM YOUR CITIES.YOU CAN EVEN CLEAR AWAY ALL MAN-MADE OBJECTS FROM THE 
MAP WITH A SIMPLE MENU CHOICE.
AS AN ADDED FEATURE,THE TERRAIN EDITOR ALLOWS YOU TO CHANGE THE GAME PLAY 
LEVEL AND YEAR OF AN EXISTING CITY.
THE TERRAIN EDITOR MAY BE COPIED TO, AND RUN FROM YOUR HARD DISK.
